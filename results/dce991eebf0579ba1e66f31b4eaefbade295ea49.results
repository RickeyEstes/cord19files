3.1. Alanine substitution of cysteine 547 facilitates partial recognition of the uncleaved S, abolishes the recognition of the cleaved subunit by anti S neutralizing antibodies and prevents recovery of a viable recombinant virus An alignment of the MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM S protein amino acids sequences to the mFc␥RII IgG binding domain revealed several short regions with modest sequence similarity ( Fig. 1A) , the most robust of which corresponded to residues 546-548 in MHV-A59 (Oleszak et al., 1990) . We selected this region of the MHV-A59 S protein for our initial studies and created a plasmid, designated pCAGGS-S (546-548), for expressing a mutant S protein in which residues R546/C547/Q548 were changed to alanine. To determine the effect that this mutation had on the overall conformation of the protein we compared its expression and its immunoreactivity with two different conformationally sensitive anti-S monoclonal antibodies, known to neutralize MHV-A59 infectivity and block infection with virus like particles containing the MHV-A59 structural proteins (Gilmore et al., 1987; Bos et al., 1997) compared to that of wild type S protein expressed in the same vector. Replicate cultures of 293 T cells were transfected with pCAGGS-S or pCAGGS-S (546-548) and after 24 h post transfection the cells were metabolically labeled with 35 S (cysteine and methionine) for 9 h, harvested, cytoplasmic extracts prepared and then immunoprecipitated with the anti-spike monoclonal neutralizing antibodies A2.1 and A2.3 (Gilmore et al., 1987) or with a polyclonal rabbit antispike antibody, B46 (kindly provided by Dr. John Fleming and Dr. K. Holmes, respectively). As shown in Fig. 2A , the S (546-548) mutant protein was barely recognized by both antibodies; signal corresponding to the complete 180 kDa protein was barely discernible compared to the robust signals obtained from the wild type glycoprotein either similarly expressed by transfection, or from cell lysates prepared from MHV-A59 infected DBT cells. Moreover, the cleaved 90 kDa S1 and S2 subunits could not be detected. In contrast the B46 polyclonal antibody strongly immunoprecipitated S (546-548), making it unlikely that the weak reactivity with the A2.1 and A2.3 antibodies was due to decreased stability of the mutant protein relative to wild type S protein ( Fig. 2A) . Together, these results suggest that alanine substitution mutations at positions 546-548 produced a major change in the conformation of the S protein. We then considered the possibility that this major change in conformation may have largely been due to our mutation of C457, a residue that could play a role in maintaining the overall conformation of the protein through a disulfide bridge. Therefore we made a second construct, containing the R546A and Q548A mutations into pCAGGS-S [pCAGGS-S (546/548)], and transfected it into cells in parallel with the parental pCAGGS-S. After radiolabeling for 9 h, starting at 24 h post transfection, lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with A2.1, A2.3, or with a polyclonal B46 An expansion of the region of weak sequence similarity between MHV S protein and the Fc␥RII protein is shown below the schematic.

As shown in Fig. 2B , both the 90 kDa cleaved S1/S2 subunits and the uncleaved full length 180 kDa forms of the S protein were immunoprecipatated by the two monoclonal antibodies as well as the uncleaved protein by the polyclonal B46 antibody (data not shown), suggesting that the R546A/Q548A mutations did not alter the overall conformation of the S protein and allowed it to fold properly. The R546A/Q548A mutations were introduced into the plasmid pMH54 and subsequently into a recombinant MHV-A59, rA59/S (546/548), by targeted recombination. A viable recombinant virus expressing these mutations was recovered without difficulty and achieved titers somewhat lower (∼1 log) but not statistically different than those achieved by the isogenic control virus rA59 (pMH54) and had a plaque size that was statistically indistinguishable from that of wild type plaques (Fig. 2C) . Immunoprecipitation of lysates prepared from DBT cells infected with rA59/S (546/548) and labeled for 1 h from 7 to 8 h.p.i, with the A2.3 monoclonal antibody confirmed this mutation did not interfere with the overall conformation of the protein (Fig. 2B) . Similarly, the S protein carrying the R546A/Q548A mutations was immunoprecipitated by the anti-Fc␥RII/RIII monoclonal antibody 2.4G.2 (Fig. 3A) , making it unlikely that the amino acids in positions 546 and 548 were part of the epitope responsible for the Fc␥RII molecular mimicry by the S protein. In contrast, multiple attempts to recover a virus containing a C547A mutation in addition to the two alanine replacement mutations in rA59/S (546/548) were unsuccessful and this included an attempt to recover temperature-sensitive viruses by performing targeted recombination at 34 • C or 39 • C. Within the S protein region with the greatest sequence similarity to the Fc␥RII/RIII proteins (546-556) there was a second trio of amino acids, L554, L 555, and N556, with perfect sequence identity amongst these proteins, A mutant S protein containing alanine replacement mutations at these 3 positions were expressed in pCAGGS-S [pCAGGS-S (554-556)]. Immunoprecipitation with the A2.1 and A2.3 monoclonal antibodies gave results similar to those obtained with pCAGGS-S (546/548), namely the mutant protein was precipitated by these conformational dependent antibodies as efficiently as wild type S protein (data not shown), indicating that the mutant protein was likely able to fold correctly. Sequences encoding the alanine replacement mutations . DBT cells were mock infected, infected with either the isogenic control virus rA59/S(pMH54), or infected with a recombinant virus containing a mutation in S. The cells were incubated until CPE was apparent at 8 hpi and metabolically labeled with [ 35 S]-methionine and cysteine for one hour, after which lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal anti-Fc␥RII antibody 2.4G2 as described in Materials and Methods. S uncleaved denotes the 180 kDa uncleaved spike protein, and S cleaved denotes the 90 kDa cleaved S1 and S2 subunits. were introduced into plasmid pMH54 by restriction fragment exchange and we subsequently performed targeted recombination to introduce these mutations into MHV-A59. A recombinant virus, designated rA59/S (554-556), containing the desired S protein mutations was successfully recovered. However, unlike the previous recombinant, this virus formed plaques with a mean diameter of 1.17 ± 0.18 mm whereas the plaques formed by the isogenic control virus containing the wild type S sequence had a mean diameter of 2.36 ± 0.20 mm (P < .001). The rA59/S (554-556) virus grew to titers that were equal to those achieved by control virus. Sequencing of the S gene failed to reveal any second site compensatory mutations, and this sequence and plaque phenotype was stable over three passages. Immunoprecipitation of lysates prepared from DBT cells infected with rA59/S (554-556) and labeled for 1 h with [ 35 S] methionine and cysteine from 7 to 8 h.p.i, with the A2.1 and A2.3 monoclonal antibody confirmed that this mutation did not interfere with the overall conformation of the protein. Both the non-cleaved and cleaved subunits were recognized by the monoclonal antibodies A2.1 (Fig. 3B ) and A2.3 (data not shown). Similarly, immunoprecipitation with the anti-Fc␥ receptor antibody 2.4G2 brought down the 180 kDa non-cleaved S protein, making it unlikely that these residues by themselves were involved in molecular mimicry of Fc␥RII by S protein (Fig. 3C) .
