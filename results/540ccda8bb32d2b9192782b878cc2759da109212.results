The C Proteins of Paramyxovirinae Cluster in three Groups: the Measles, Nipah and Sendai Groups On the basis of sequence analyses (see Methods), the C proteins of Paramyxovirinae can be divided into three groups: the measles, Nipah and Sendai groups ( Figure 1B ). The measles group is composed of morbilliviruses, of the unclassified Salem virus, and of a subgroup comprising the unclassified Tupaia paramyxovirus, Mossman virus and Nariva virus. The Nipah group comprises henipaviruses and jeilongviruses. Finally, the Sendai group is composed of respiroviruses and of the recently described genus aquaparamyxovirus, composed of fish viruses [83, 84, 104] related to respiroviruses [105, 106] . The classification of C into measles and Nipah groups is supported by an examination of the PNT domain of P, which is encoded by the same region as C but in a different frame ( Figure 1A) . Indeed, the PNT of all species in the Nipah group differ from the PNT of the measles group in having a soyuz2 motif (see Introduction) [14] . We found that other Paramyxovirinae that do not not express a C frame [2, 107] can be classified in two groups based on the phylogeny of their P gene: the mumps group (comprised of the sister genera rubulavirus and avulavirus) and the Fer de lance group (formed by the genus ferlavirus [108] ). This classification corresponds to that of previous analyses [105] .
