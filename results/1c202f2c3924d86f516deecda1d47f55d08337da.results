Of a total of 65 clinically suspected cases, 21 infants (32.3%) were enrolled to be the confirmed cases of B. pertussis infection in this study. The age range was from 22 to 198 days old with a mean age of 2.5 months old. There were 11 males and 10 females. All were born full term at birth. Nine patients (42.9%, average age: 47.4 days) had not received any DTaP vaccinations, 9 (42.9%, average age: 77.2 days) received 1 dose, 2 (9.5%, average age: 104.5 days) received 2 doses, and 1 (4.8%, age: 198 days) received 3 doses of DTaP (Table 1) . Pertussis occurred mostly in spring, summer and early fall, peaking in April, June, and September. There was no patient in the winter month from December to February (Fig. 1) . Although paroxysmal cough manifested for more than 1 week in all cases, whooping cough was present in only 3 cases (14.3%). There were 4 cases (19.0%) of pneumonic infiltration, 3 cases (14.3%) of hyperinflation on radiologic examinations. Four patients with abnormal chest radiographic finding were not immunized with DTaP vaccination, and remaining 3 patients were received with 1 dose of DTaP vaccination. All patients except 2 cases were examined by multiplex PCR for respiratory virus identification. Two patients had concomitant infections of rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, respectively, and severity was not increased in these patients. Absolute lymphocytosis was noted in 12 patients (57.1%). Of note, absolute lymphocytosis was found more commonly in patients (8/9, 88.9%, average age: 45.8 days) who did not receive DTaP vaccination than patients (4/12, 33.3%, average age: 88.0 days) who did receive DTaP vaccination (P = 0.024, Table 2 ). The mean length of hospital stay among all patients was 11.7 days. However, the mean length of hospitalization for patients without DTaP vaccination was 15.4 ± 6.6 days, which was significantly longer than the 8.8 ± 3.8 days of patients with DTaP vaccination (P = 0.009, Table 2 ). Two patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU); both of them did not receive DTaP vaccination, and one of these patients treated with a mechanical ventilator. There were no deaths due to pertussis during the study period (Table 1) . On the result of diagnostic methods, PCR had the highest sensitivity showing positivity for all 21 cases (100%), however, confirmed cases with culture were 9 (42.9%) which showed the lowest sensitivity. Although RT-PCR and serological test were not performed in all patients, high sensitivity was observed in all patients done with these tests. Total of 72 family members and long-term guardians of index infant cases were enrolled in this study for confirming household transmission. The composition of those members were as followings; 42 parents, 20 siblings, 10 relatives. Seventy members (97.2%) showed respiratory symptoms, and 42 members (60%) with respiratory symptoms had a history of antibiotics use. Of these 72 family members, 38 members (38/72, 52.8%) were confirmed with laboratory criteria of pertussis as followings; all 38 members were positive by PCR, 31 members (who received ELISA assay) were all positive serology, 12 members were positive culture. Finally, a total of 18 potential family sources (18/21, 85.7%) were identified for confirmed cases, of which 20 mem-bers (20/38, 52.6%, 15 family) were parents and 8 (8/38, 21.1%, 6 family) were siblings. Other 10 members (6 family; 6 grandparents, 4 aunts) accounted for 26.3% (10/38). In particular, mothers provided the highest proportion (13/38, 34.2%) of presumed sources of infection (Fig. 2) .
