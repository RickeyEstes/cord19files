One hundred and ninety-eight patient radiographs were selected and each had digital camera and film digitizer images taken, for a total of 594 images. The panel's perception of image quality differed according to modality. Of the original 198 radiographs, 163 (82%) were judged to be of adequate quality, 31 (16%) were suboptimal, and 4 (2%) were unreadable compared to 150 (76%), 44 (22%), and 4 (2%) of film digitizer images and 123 (62%), 70 (35%), and 5 (3%) of digital camera images, respectively. The differences in perceived image quality between the original radiographs and the film digitizer was not statistically significant; however, the differences between the original radiographs and the camera, and the film digitizer and the camera, were statistically significant ( p < 0.05). The 13 unreadable images from 6 persons were removed from further analysis, leaving 192 patient radiographs for comparison across all three modalities. Among the 192, 103 (54%) were from men and 62 (32%) were from children of less than 5 years old. Of 192 hard copy chest radiographs, 185 (96%) were classified as showing evidence of possible, probable, or definite pneumonia, 166 (86%) of probable or definite pneumonia, and 120 (63%) of definite pneumonia. For the remainder of the results, pneumonia is defined as the 166 cases with either probable or definite pneumonia. There was moderate agreement between the two primary radiology readers on evidence of pneumonia (0.44), and almost perfect agreement on alveo-lar consolidation (0.89), infiltrates (0.90), and pleural effusion (0.85). The agreement between the readers on other findings is shown in Table 1 . The radiographic findings of the 166 pneumonias are shown in Table 2 . Seventy-eight (47%) of the pneumonias had alveolar consolidation. A comparison of the test characteristics of the digital camera and the film digitizer to the hard copy gold standard on various radiographic findings for pneumonia is shown in Table 3 . For pneumonia, the sensitivity of the digital camera was 89% and of the film digitizer 90%; specificities were 73% and 65%, respectively. An ROC curve was generated comparing the radiologists reading of pneumonia on the original films (i.e., gold standard), digital camera, and film digitizer. The value for the area under the curve was 0.86 (95% CI = 0.78-0.95) for the digital camera and 0.91 (95% CI = 0.87-0.95) for the film digitizer ( Figure 1 ). There was no statistically significant difference between the two curves ( p = 0.29). The cost of the film digitizer was $3000; the camera and tripod cost $965.
