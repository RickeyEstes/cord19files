Parenteral immunization of two rabbits each with CCV or TGEV resulted in high homologous VN titres as shown in Table I . The rabbits immunized with uninfected DK/2 or APT/2 cells did not develop VN antibody. Neutralization of the heterologous virus occurred with each antiserum but the titres were at least ten-fold higher for the immunizing virus. As previously reported (Garwes et al., 1978 (Garwes et al., /1979 ) serum from rabbit 5, immunized with TGEV surface projections, resulted in TGEV neutralizing antibody. CCV was also neutralized but with a sixteen-fold lower titre. Neither CCV nor TGEV were neutralized by serum from the rabbit immunized with TGEV subviral particles. aExpressed as log~o of the reciprocal of the end-point dilution. bSp (surface projections); SVP (subviral particles). The results of infection and hyperimmunization of cats with TGEV are shown in Table II . All three cats were seronegative when first infected. In two cats convalescent sera which had log10 TGEV VN titres of 2.05 and 2.25 did not neutralize CCV. The TGEV VN titre of 2.55 in cat 3, however, did neutralize CCV to a titre of 1.56, approximately 10-fold lower. After hyperimmunization with TGEV, this cat showed a 100-fold increase in titre to both viruses. Means and ranges of VN, CCV and TGEV titres in serum samples collected from cats, dogs and pigs are shown in Table III . The regression analysis carried out on titres for the canine, porcine and feline sera showed that separate regression lines could be fitted to each of the populations (Fig. 1) . These lines were found to be significantly different in their displacement (P 0.001), yet all could be considered parallel. Comparisons between two lines showed that the intercepts for the canine and feline sera were both significantly different from the porcine sera (P < 0.001 ), and were also significantly different from each other (P < 0.001). The three regression lines had the following equations: Cats y = 1.09 (+ 0.11) + 1.00 (-+ 0.06)x Dogs y = 0.44 (-+ 0.11) + 1.00 (-+ 0.06)x Pigs y = --0.72 (+ 0.18} + 1.00 (+ 0.06)x These lines had a slope of unity. For a given titre against TGEV, therefore, CCV titres were respectively 12.3 (antilog 1.09) and 2.7 (antilog 0.44) fold higher on average for the feline and canine sera and 5.2 (antilog 0.72) fold lower for the porcine sera. The correlation coefficient for each of the equations is given in Table III. No neutralizing activity was detected in antisem to BCV, HEV, IBV or 229E against either TGEV or CCV; these were all screened at a dilution of 1 in 2.
