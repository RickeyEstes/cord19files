The average age of the 257 students participated in the research was 20.54 Â± 1.87 years, 44.7% of them were females and 77.1% of them were first-year students. Of the students, 23.3% said that they made direct contact with patients 1 to 5 times a day while this number was 6 to 10 times for 38.9%, 11 to 15 times for 14.8%, and > 15 times for 23%. An analysis of the frequency of applying HH in the clinic indicated that 14.8% of the students applied it 1 to 5 times a day, and this number was 6 to 10 times for 32.3%, 11 to 15 times for 23.3%, and > 15 times for 29.6%. The percentage of students who said that they washed their hands to maintain HH was 90.3%, while 8.2% of the students noted that they preferred using antiseptic solution, and 1.6% chose to use gloves. According to the self-statements of students, the duration of handwashing < 20 s was 20.2%. This rate was 21 to 40 s for 52.9%, 40 to seconds for 19.5%, and longer than 60 s for 7.4%. In addition, 19.8% of the students said that they dried their hands as long as they could, while 0.8% noted that they did not dry their hands at all. Among all students, 3.5% noted that they had dermatological problems on their hands. Concerning the usage of gloves and hand-washing, 66.9% expressed that they washed their hands before and after wearing gloves; 28% said that they washed their hands only after taking off their gloves, 3.9% did not wash their hands at all; and 1.2% highlighted that they wash their hands before wearing gloves. Besides, 18 students said that it was unnecessary to wash their hands when wearing gloves. The students who stated that they always applied hand-washing procedures constituted 85.6% of the participants, and the percentage of those who did not regularly comply with hand-washing procedures due to limited time was 10.9%. Of the students, 76.8% thought that sufficient supplies and resources (e.g., washrooms) were provided for hand-washing. In addition, 24.9% of the students thought that their hands could dry and their skin could be irritated if they applied hand-washing procedures regularly and 20.6% claimed that washing hands after each patient contact was unpractical. The analysis of hand antiseptic use found that the percentage of covering both hands with alcohol hand rubs was 82%. The lowest percentages were found on the metacarpal II areas, which are far from the fingers. The percentages of covering the dorsal and palmar surfaces of right and left hands with alcohol-based hand rubs were similar at 74% and 89%, respectively (Fig. 2) . The median of AHR use points for the two hands was 3.380 (2960-4000), while it was found 1.710 (1491-1849) for the right hand and 1.695 (1452-1865) for the left. No difference was found between right and left hands in terms of their AHR points (p > 0.05). The median of disinfectant use points for the dorsal surfaces of hands was 1.616 (1222-1805) and 1.830 (1688-1945) for palmar surfaces. There was a significant difference between the dorsal and palmar surfaces in terms of their AHR use points (p < 0.01) ( Table 1 ). The practice of hand-washing was not analyzed for 70 people due to their insufficient AHR use (the surface covered with AHR was below 75%). The analysis of effectiveness of hand-washing found that the percentage of fluorescent traces after hand washing was 55%. The highest percentages were found on the metacarpal I areas, which are close to the fingers. Hand-washing effectiveness decreases as percentages increase. The percentages of hand washing points the dorsal and palmar surfaces of right and left hands were different, right hand points were higher than the left hands' (Fig. 2) . Evaluating whether there is a difference between right and left hands in terms of hand washing effectiveness, the median of points for fluorescent remains on hands after washing both hands was found 2.205 (1780-2625), while it was 1181 (955-1384) for the right hand and 1050 (798-1328) for the left (p < 0.01). There was a difference between the right and left hand hand-washing points ( Table 2 ). The median of points for washing the dorsal surfaces of the hands was 890 (550-1200) and 1.355 (1010-1595) for palmar surfaces. There was a difference between the dorsal and palmar surfaces hand-washing points (p < 0.01) ( Table 2) . It was found that the fourth-year male students' AHR use was worse, while effectiveness of their hand-washing was better than the other groups (p < 0.05). The female nursing students' AHR points were higher than male students (p < 0.05). There was no difference between the use of AHR and the practice of hand-washing by frequency of patient contact (p > 0.05) ( Table 3) .
