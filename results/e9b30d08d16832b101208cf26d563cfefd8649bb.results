Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Infectious Diseases 7 The probability of extinction, π 1 , given a single child index case, reached a minimum with θ in the range of 0.4-0.5, although this probability was not very sensitive to θ. Such θ may lead to a "well-mixed" population, thereby allowing the child index case to involve both child and adult secondary cases effectively. Figure 5 examines the probability of extinction given 10 index cases as a function of θ and the proportion of adult index cases. With random mixing, the probability of extinction given a single index case is (100/R)% (e.g., 71% with R = 1.4). The extinction probability given 10 index cases in the randomly mixing population was independent of the proportion of adults, (1/R) 10 = 0.035 (with R = 1.4), indicating that a major epidemic is almost unavoidable without any intervention. However, as assortativity increased, the increase in the proportion of adult index cases promoted extinction. The vertical reference line of 63% indicates the empirically observed proportion of adults (i.e., those aged ≥15 years in (7) as defined by [6] ) among all imported cases in Japan [30] . At around that proportion, the probability of extinction was estimated to be 1%-58% over the full range of θ from 0 to 1, for 10 index cases. Given 10 index cases with θ = 1, the results were independent of the proportion of adult index cases, because a 1 + a 2 = 10 and π 2 = 1 (for θ = 1), whatever the number of adults, a 2 , the extinction probability is That is, as mixing becomes more and more assortative, the contribution of the initial number of adults, a 2 to the risk of a major epidemic becomes less important, and moreover, an increase in the proportion of adults indirectly reduces a 1 , leading to an increase in the probability of extinction. Even when we divide the entire population into many more subpopulations, this argument holds as long as the host type of interest i is incapable of maintaining disease by itself, that is, when the host-specific reproduction number, R ii < 1 [42] . Of course, if a 2 = 10, p(0, 10) = 1 for θ = 1.
