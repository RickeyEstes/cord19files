All of the collected beetles from the pigeon house were identified as Alphitobius diaperinus ( Fig.1) , due to the characteristics of adults, described by Dunford et al. 2004 Dunford et al. , 2009 . Adult beetles are broadly oval, moderately convex, black or brownish-black in color and usually shiny in appearance. Color can be variable depending on the age and size. Antennae are densely clothed with short yellowish hairs, with the terminal segment lighter in color. The head is deeply emarginated in front, has a distinct clypeal groove, and the surface is coarsely punctured. Eyes are emarginated approximately one-half the length of eye, and prosternal process is horizontal between forecoxae (23, 24) . Average length and width of the collected adult beetles were 6.31 mm (5.54 to 6.96mm) and 2.88 mm (2.50 to 3.20 mm) respectively. The number and percentage of infected adult beetles, their nematode burden and type of larvae (free or cystic forms) (Fig.  2 ) are summarized in Table 1 . Average length of the nematode third-stage larvae were 4.44 mm (range 3.8 to 4.95 mm). Furthermore, 3 out of 51 (5.9%) beetle larvae were infected with larvae and mostly cysts, with the mean of 1.6 larvae (ranging 1 to 3) per each larva. The maximum prepatent period recorded in experimentally infected pigeons was 50 days. Infection rates of pigeons are summarized in Table 2 . The percentages of the male and female adult nematodes collected from the pigeons were 38% and 62% (with the approximate proportion of 1 to 2) respectively. The nematode eggs were oval and light green, measuring 42×27µm and containing embryos.
