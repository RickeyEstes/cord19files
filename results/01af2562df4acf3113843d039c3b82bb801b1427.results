The patients' background characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory data, and findings from chest imaging are shown in Table. Seven cases (88%) received various immunosuppressive treatment, and none had airway diseases, such as bronchial asthma. Five cases (63%) had newly appearing abnormal findings on chest CT; however, no abnormal findings were detected by chest X-ray in 3 of those 5 patients (60%). Most cases had upper respiratory symptoms, including rhinitis and sore throat. However, lower respiratory symptoms, such as wheeze, sputum, and hypoxemia, were only seen in patients with newly appearing findings on chest CT. Bacterial culture for respiratory specimens was performed in six cases, and bacteria were detected in three cases; however, no patient was diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia or treated with targeted antibiotics against these detected bacteria. In addition, no cases received antiviral therapy against RSV. Chest CT findings for the five patients are shown in Figs. 1-5. The most common finding among these patients was bronchial wall thickenings; seen in 4 of 5 patients (80%). In terms of the findings in the parenchymal lesion, the patterns and distributions were varied and inconsistent. Two cases showed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) along the bronchi; however, the distribution differed, as one was a localized GGO and the other a multilobar GGO. One case showed ground-glass nodules with a tree-in-bud pattern. The remaining case showed diffuse GGOs with centrilobular septal thickening, also known as the "crazy-paving" pattern. Three cases underwent two or more CT scans during the course of their disease, and the abnormal findings on chest CT disappeared (Fig. 1, 2, 5 ).
