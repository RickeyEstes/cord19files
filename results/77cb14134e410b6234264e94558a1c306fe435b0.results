We begin by presenting results of in-situ data collection with the focus on the data used to calibrate multi-zone models. Further, the calibrated models provided seasonally averaged ventilation rates for all dormitory rooms in the studied buildings. These datasets provided a foundation for the analyses of a relationship between the ARI incidence and ventilation rates. Finally, a case study with two influenza A cases provided data to investigate potential for infectious bioaerosols to expose occupants of neighboring dormitory rooms.
