In all horses hematological and serum biochemical parameters determined before the physical effort fell within relevant reference intervals [2] . During the 7-month training season, TSP was the only blood parameter that significantly increased, while the rest remained unaffected by the number of efforts the horse had undergone ( Table 1) . The significant interaction between type of effort and time of blood collection was observed only for WBC and SAA adj (Table 1 )-they significantly increased after competition, whereas remained unchanged after training (Table 2, Figure 1 ). The highest individual SAA concentrations after competition reached 10.6 mg/L. All remaining hematological (RBC, HGB, PCV) and serum biochemical parameters (CPK, AST, TSP) slightly rose both after training and competition (Table 3) . Table 3 . Other hematological and serum biochemical parameters before and after the effort (training and competition).
