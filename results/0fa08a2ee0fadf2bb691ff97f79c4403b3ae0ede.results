Significant differences in patient characteristics were observed (all P<0.0001) before propensity score matching (Table A , see online supplementary material). Inpatients admitted via EDs were more likely to be older and male, have medical aid, live in rural areas, visit university hospitals and have higher CCI scores than those admitted via outpatient clinics. Table I compares the baseline characteristics of the two inpatient groups after propensity score matching. In total, 64,017 inpatients admitted via EDs were matched with 127,980 inpatients admitted via outpatient clinics, where the matching ratio was 1:2. There were no significant differences between the two inpatient groups in terms of age, sex, type of beneficiary, residential area, type of hospital and CCI (P>0.05). The matched samples showed negligible imbalance in the baseline characteristics between the two inpatient groups (standardized difference <0.1) ( Table C, see online supplementary material) . Regarding disease prevalence, the highest proportion of patients were hospitalized via EDs because of trauma (18.4%), followed by gastrointestinal disease (15.2%) and cardiovascular disease (12.3%). In contrast, the highest proportion of patients were hospitalized via outpatient clinics because of musculoskeletal disease (14.9%), followed by trauma (11.1%) and cardiovascular disease (10.8%). The proportion of inpatients hospitalized via EDs because of pulmonology disease (ICD-10 codes J00eJ99) was higher (7.3% vs 6.6%) than that of patients hospitalized via outpatient clinics (Tables D and E, see  online supplementary material).  Table II shows HRs for TB occurrence (ICD-10 codes A15eA19) between 15 and 90 days after the first day of hospitalization. The HR increased with the increase in each 10year age category. For sex and type of beneficiary, females (HR 1.42; 95% CI 1.22e1.65) and inpatients with medical insurance (HR 2.28; 95% CI 1.86e2.80) had higher HRs than their counterparts. HRs for TB occurrence increased gradually with CCI: HR¼1.98 (95% CI 1.51e2.60) for a score of 1, and HR¼5.24 (95% CI 4.15e6.63) for a score >2. Table III shows the percentage of cases and HRs for the occurrence of TB in inpatients who were hospitalized via EDs between 15 and 90 days after the first day of hospitalization. The percentage of inpatients with TB admitted via EDs was higher than that of inpatients admitted via outpatient clinics: 0.42% vs 0.35% for all TB (ICD-10 codes A15eA19), 0.35% vs 0.30% for pulmonary TB (ICD-10 codes A15eA16) and 0.07% vs 0.07% for extrapulmonary TB (ICD-10 codes A17eA18). Compared with inpatients admitted via outpatient clinics, inpatients admitted via EDs had significantly higher HRs for the occurrence of all TB (HR 1.30; 95% CI 1.12e1.52) and pulmonary TB (HR 1.30; 95% CI 1.10e1.53). In contrast, no significant risk was detected for the occurrence of extrapulmonary TB. Figure 1 shows the survival curves for TB occurrence in inpatients admitted via EDs or outpatient clinics between 15 and 90 days after the first day of hospitalization. The KaplaneMeier survival analysis indicated that the difference in cumulative probability of TB occurrence between the two hospitalized groups was significant for all TB (stratified log-rank test; P¼0.0008) and pulmonary TB (stratified log-rank test; P¼0.0025), but not extrapulmonary TB (stratified log-rank test; P¼0.2048).
