VP24-1160 was the most effi cacious siRNA at silencing ZEBOV VP24 gene in HepG2 cells, and VP35-855 was most effi cacious at silencing ZEBOV VP35 gene (fi gure 1). These sequences, and EK-1, 11 were selected as the siRNAs of the ZEBOV SNALP cocktail. Since non-selective chemical modifi cation might attenuate the potency of the siRNA, we selectively modifi ed lead siRNAs by substituting 2´-O-methyl guanosine or uridines in both strands to eliminate the immune stimulatory capacity of the siRNA duplex, [13] [14] [15] and confi rmed the gene silencing activity of the modifi ed versions using the in-vitro plasmid-based ZEBOV gene expression system (data not shown). SNALPs containing modifi ed ZEBOV siRNAs did not induce interferon α or interleukin 6 in the plasma of mice, whereas SNALPs containing chemically unmodifi ed Luc siRNA induced high concentrations of both plasma cytokines (fi gure 2A and B). Analysis of liver IFIT1 mRNA showed no diff erences between SNALPs containing PBS (negative control) and those containing the 2-O-methyl-modifi ed Luc or ZEBOV siRNA cocktail, whereas the SNALPs containing unmodifi ed Luc induced high levels of IFIT1 mRNA (1169-fold greater than the PBS control; fi gure 2). No diff erences were noted in clinical signs and organ weights of mice treated with SNALPs containing siRNAs or PBS. Native (chemically unmodifi ed) versions of Luc, EK-1, VP24-1160, and VP35-855 siRNAs also induced high levels of interferon α in cultures of human PBMCs, whereas the 2´-O-methylmodifi ed versions of siRNAs at up to 400 nmol/L did not induce any interferon α (fi gure 2). Figure 3A shows that SNALPs containing ZEBOV siRNAs substantially reduced ZEBOV produced in supernatants of Vero E6 cells 48 h after infection. Figure 3B shows that SNALPs containing EK-1-mod, VP35-855-mod, or VP24-1160-mod induced specifi c mRNA cleavage only of their target mRNA in the cells, whereas all three PCR products of the correct predicted size were present in cells treated with SNALPs containing the ZEBOV cocktail of siRNAs (fi gure 3B). No 5´RACE PCR products of the predicted size were noted in cells treated with SNALPs containing PBS or Luc mod (fi gure 3B), further showing the specifi city of the assay. The sequences of the 5´RACE PCR products (data not shown) corresponded to the specifi c cleavage products of polymerase L protein, VP24, and VP35 mRNAs, thereby confi rming the specifi c mechanism of RNA interference. To show that our anti-ZEBOV siRNAs targeted populations of cells that were relevant to fi lovirus infection, we assessed the uptake of the SNALPs in livers of mice and in human CD34-derived myeloid cell cultures. The SNALPs enabled entry of siRNAs into cells of the reticuloendothelial system as shown by the uptake of fl uorescent SNALPs into Kupff er cells in the murine liver (data not shown), and into subsets of human myeloid cells that were positive for CD14, CD11b, and CD11c (fi gure 4). These data showed that SNALPs were actively taken up by the reticuloendothelial cell populations most relevant to EBOV infection. In the tolerability studies, activities of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate amino transferase, and sorbitol dehydrogenase remained unchanged 48 h after the mice were given the fi nal dose of SNALPs containing ZEBOV siRNAs, even at the highest cumulative dose (fi gure 5A). Complete blood cell and diff erential counts were also unaff ected at the doses tested in the mice (fi gure 5B). All three macaques given four treatments of SNALPs containing pooled siRNAs, and the control, developed clinical symptoms that were consistent with ZEBOVinduced haemorrhagic fever by day 6 (table 2). The control animal succumbed to ZEBOV infection before blood collection on day 6 (fi gure 6). One treated animal (number 3) developed a high ZEBOV viraemia on day 6 (table 3) and succumbed on day 10 (fi gure 6). ZEBOV was detected in the plasma of one of the remaining treated animals (number 2) on day 6, but we were unable to detect ZEBOV in the plasma of the other table 3 ). Both of these animals survived. Seven doses of SNALPs containing pooled siRNAs were more eff ective because clinical symptoms of ZEBOV infection in the treated macaques were less severe than in those given four doses (table 2) . The control animal injected with SNALPs containing Luc mod succumbed to haemorrhagic fever on day 10, whereas all four animals given the pooled anti-ZEBOV siRNAs survived (fi gure 6). ZEBOV was detected in the plasma of the second control animal on days 3, 6, and 10 (table 3) . Low levels of ZEBOV were detected on day 6 in the plasma of all four macaques injected with SNALPs containing ZEBOV siRNAs, and on day 10 in one of these animals (animal 6), whereas we were unable to detect ZEBOV in any of these animals on day 14 (table 3) . Peak viraemia in surviving siRNA-treated macaques never exceeded 2·4 log 10 pfu/mL (table 3) . Clinical assessments also showed that this aggressive SNALP treatment regimen was well tolerated in macaques with only minor changes in liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase <2-fold increase, aspartate amino-transferase <6-fold increase), possibly related to viral infection. All six animals that survived the ZEBOV challenge in the two studies were healthy on day 40 and were euthanised on days 40-43.
