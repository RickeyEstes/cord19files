During the study period 424 children with asthma exacerbations were hospitalized, 28 of whom could not be enrolled due to lack of consent or because they were admitted during the weekend and could not be investigated in time by the research team, resulting in a final sample size of 396 patients. The hospitalization characteristics are presented in Table 1 . Most patients belonged to the public health system and were living in the central zone. The rate of asthma hospitalization was significantly higher in the central zone than in the north and south zones (p < 0.001). The median length of stay was four days (range 3---6). Patients treated in the public health system were hospitalized for one additional day compared to patients in the private health system, and patients in the north region were hospitalized for two more days compared to patients of the central and south zones (Tables 2 and 3). 69 patients (17.4%) required initial management in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). The median length of hospital stay in these patients was four days, comparable to those not requiring initial PICU treatment (p = 0.110). The north zone showed a significantly higher PICU admission rate compared to the central and south zones (p = 0.005).
