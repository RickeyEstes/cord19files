The initial search identified 234 sources (156 from PubMed, 73 EMBASE and 5 from other sources). Following screening of titles and abstracts and removing duplicates, we evaluated eight articles in full text. Among these, we found six relevant articles (one narrative letter, one research letter, one editorial, one expert consensus paper in Chinese, one national guideline document in Dutch and one in Italian) [3, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] ]. Twenty-three trials were found in the trial registries (Table 1) .
