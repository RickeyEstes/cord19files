The first step of this carbohydrate microarray analysis was to characterize the global antibody profiles of all subjects. These profiles were measured as the relative serum antibody reactivities (IgG scores) with a diverse panel of antigens spotted in the same carbohydrate microarray (Figure 2 ). Statistical analyses were followed to identify the glycan markers that detect significant levels of autoantibodies in human circulation ( Figure 3 ) and further to those that capture PCa-associated autoantibody signatures ( Figure 4 ). In Figure 2 , the antibody profiles are illustrated as overlay plots with IgG scores on the Yaxis and antigen probes aligned on the X-axis. Each colored symbol represents the IgG score of a given antibody specificity detected from a sera sample. The anti-self-antibody activities, including anti-carbohydrates and anti-lipids, are plotted to the left of a dashed line. Antinon-self-antibodies, mainly anti-microbial polysaccharides, are plotted to the right of the line. Although the sera from the BPH and PCa subjects illustrate general similarity in their global antibody profiles, antibody reactivities targeting Man9 clusters spiked in the PCa sera ( Figure 2A) . Figure 3 and 4 further examined statistically significant detection of autoantibodies by this microarray assay. In these figures, each dot represents the mean value of triplicate array detection of a sample. The mean of given group of subjects (represented by the green bar) and standard deviations (shown as a green diamond around the mean value) are shown to describe the size of the difference in relation to the distribution of values in each group. The comparison circles for Student's t-tests appear to the right of the diamonds. The intersection of the circles illustrates the significance of the difference; the more the circles intersect, the less the significance of difference and vice versa. Figure 3 addressed whether a given autoantigen detected antibodies in human sera. One-way analysis was performed to examine the significance of the differences of IgG scores among pairs of antigens. For examples, we examined pairs of OR-AGOR, OR-ASOR and AGOR-ASOR, respectively. OR, ASOR and AGOR are identical in their protein component but differ in the glyco-epitopes they express. AGOR and ASOR display Tri/m-Gn and Tri/m-II, respectively; OR do not surface-display either of the two glyco-epitopes. Thus, their pairwise comparison is sufficient for revealing the carbohydrate-specific binding signals. As shown in Figure 3A and 3B, OR did not detect measurable antibodies. By contrast, its asialo form, ASOR (Tri/m-II) and agalato form, AGOR (Tri/m-Gn) captured highly significant amounts of IgG antibodies. Figure 3C and 3D show one-way analysis among KLH, Man9 (2G12) and Man9 (TM10). These antigens share the KLH carrier but differ in carbohydrate units. Man9 (2G12) and Man9 (TM10) display Man9 in different cluster configurations. By comparing antibodies captured by these conjugates with those of the KLH control, it was determined that the two Man9 clusters detected highly significant amounts of IgG antibodies in both the PCa and BPH groups. Figure 4 examined whether a detected serum autoantibody differed significantly between the PCa and BPH groups in order to identify potential "signatures" of PCa. For this purpose, autoantibodies detected in the PCa group were compared to those detected in the BPH group. The two Man9 clusters detected significantly increased levels of autoantibodies in the PCa group ( Figure 4C and 4D). Man9 (TM10) appears to be more effective than Man9 (2G12) in capturing serum IgG. AGOR and ASOR did not detect significantly different levels of IgG between the PCa and BPH groups. However, a wide distribution of IgG ASOR scores among samples from PCa patients was observed with a significant proportion of samples producing elevated levels of IgG ASOR ( Figure 4B ).
