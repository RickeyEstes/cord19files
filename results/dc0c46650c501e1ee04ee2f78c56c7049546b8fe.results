The experiment lasted for 9 days. The shrimps in groups NW and W began to die 4 days after WSSV infection per os. No mortality of shrimp occurred in group N and untreated control. The shrimps in the control group and group N had similar feeding behavior. It seems that the ammonium-N concentration of 5 mg l À1 had no dramatic impacts on the shrimps' appetite. Fig. 1 shows that the THC of healthy P. japonicus (control) in the experiment was in the range of 5.5F0.6Â10 7 and 4.9F0.4 Â10 7 cell ml À1 ( PN0.05). From 0 to 6 h of experiment, the THC of P. japonicus in N declined significantly to 4.5F0.2Â10 7 cells ml À1 ( Pb0.01); afterward, it declined slowly in contrast to the controls. At 102 h, the haemocytes declined to the minimum (2.3Â10 7 cell ml À1 ) ( Pb0.001). At 6 h, the THC of P. japonicus in W had decreased to 2.2F0.9Â10 7 cells ml À1 ( Pb0.01) and that of P. japonicus in NW to 2.9F0.2Â10 7 cells ml À1 ( Pb0.01), then the THC of NW and W reduced further. At 102 h, the THC of W has decreased to 1.9F0.7Â10 6 cell ml À1 and that of NW was 3.1F1.9Â10 6 cell ml À1 ( Pb0.001). Afterwards, the THC of NW and W remained relatively stable but the THC of NW was higher than that of W ( Pb0.05).
