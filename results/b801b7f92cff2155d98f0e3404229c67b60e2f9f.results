It . https://doi.org /10.1101/476341 doi: bioRxiv preprint In the absence of methods to monitor 2-5A without cell disruption, the cellular dynamics of this second messenger are poorly understood. Here we developed a biosensor for continuous and non-invasive 2-5A monitoring in live cells. The biosensor was designed based on the crystal structures of the cellular 2-5A receptor RNase L 22, 24 ( Fig. 1A) , which indicate that the N-terminal ANK domain of RNase L is sufficient for 2-5A sensing and provides a minimal dimerization module 24 . In a single ANK protomer, the N-and C-termini in cis are separated, but upon dimerization of two ANK domains, which bind notably head-to-tail, the C-/N-termini become positioned in trans next to each other (Fig. 1B) . We employed this in cis vs in trans N-/C-distance decrease to drive a dual-split-luciferase sensor. The combinatorially optimized sensor has two halves, which consist of the core ANK domain fused to a modified split firefly luciferase (Fluc) 29 (Fig. 1B) . We modified Fluc by replacing the published overlapping split junction N416/C415 with a nonoverlapping junction ( Fig. 2A) . Due to the head-to-tail structure, the sensor was encoded as one polypeptide, which simplified its use compared to usual two-protein split systems. We optimized the reporter by engineering the linker regions and selected variant V6 with the highest luminescence response to 2-5A for further work ( Fig. 2A) . We determined that V6 was suitable for 2-5A detection over a range of 2-5A and V6 concentrations from ~ 10 nM to at least 1 μM (V6) and 3 μM (2-5A) ( Fig. 2B-C) . This luminescence response was specific and abolished by a control mutation Y312A, which removed the key 2-5A-sensing tyrosine 24 (Fig. 2B-C) . The reporter V6 had sufficient sensitivity to detect low amounts of 2-5A purified from human cells treated with poly-Inosine/poly-Cytidine (poly-IC) dsRNA (Fig. S1A ). These reporter measurements closely agreed with the standard endoribonuclease readout based on RNA cleavage (Fig. S1B ). To determine whether V6 was sufficiently bright and stable in live cells, we expressed FLAG-tagged V6 in HeLa cells and stimulated these reporter cells with poly-IC. Poly-IC treatment conditions were selected to produce cleavage of 28S rRNA in the conventional end-point assay using cell disruption 22 . 28S rRNA cleavage was noticeable after one hour of poly-IC treatment and further increased after three and four hours ( Further evidence for specific 2-5A detection was obtained in cells with 2-5A synthetases knocked out. It has been shown that knockout of OAS3 is sufficient to inhibit 2-5A synthesis in human cells 11 . We found that biosensor exhibited a robust response to poly-IC in OAS1-KO and OAS2-KO cells. In contrast, the response was lost in OAS3-KO cells ( fig. S2 ), providing a confirmation that 2-5A synthesis gave rise to the reporter activity. RNase L may be activated by local production of 2-5A 30 , at secrete sites inside cells (the cytosol). Notably, OASs are present not only in the cytosol, but also in the nucleus [31] [32] [33] , which further supports that 2-5A accumulation could be nonuniform with subcellular spaces. The availability of live cell 2-5A sensor offers an opportunity to evaluate 2-5A accumulation in individual cellular compartments in situ. Toward this end, we engineered tagged versions of V6 with nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES). Both variants localized to the expected sites ( Fig. 3C ). In the presence of poly-IC, NLS-V6 and NES-V6 produced nearly identical luminescence profiles, which are similar to the trace obtained with untagged V6 (Fig.   3D ). This similarity is most simply reconciled with a model of rapid 2-5A equilibration between the two compartments due to diffusion. Indeed, 2-5A produced at the center of a HeLa cell, may take only several seconds to diffuse across the nucleus, through the nuclear pores, and to become evenly distributed between the nucleus and the cytosol ( Fig. 3E ). Our measurements did not support localized 2-5A action and indicated that 2-5A was poised to establish communication between the OASs and RNase L across the cell. Translational arrest by 2-5A precedes the IFN response The pathways of 2-5A and IFNs are closely interconnected. IFNs stimulate 2-5A production by transcriptionally inducing the OASs 3,34,35 . Conversely, 2-5A can amplify 36 and suppress 37 IFN-β protein production. Considering that RNase L stops translation and ultimately causes apoptosis 38 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/476341 doi: bioRxiv preprint contrast, transcription of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) measured by qPCR of OAS1/2/3/L and the helicases RIG-I and MDA5, developed with a lag of 2-4 hours and became strong after maximal 2-5A production (Fig. 4, A and B) . Rapid 2-5A synthesis before the IFN response was confirmed by cleavage of 28S rRNA in A549 cells (Fig.   4C ), and in HeLa cells using a combination of biosensor and qPCR readouts ( fig. S4 ). These observations suggest that 2-5A production may precede the IFN response and that 2-5A is supplied by basal rather than IFN-induced OASs. Therefore, 2-5A/OAS activation does not require IFN stimulation, as reported 39 . Similarly, basal OASs are solely responsible for protection of mouse myeloid cells from murine coronavirus 40 . We also found that the OAS/RNase L activation was not inhibited by pre-treatment with a To determine whether cellular 2-5A dynamics corresponds to a rapid arrest of translation by RNase L, we measured nascent protein synthesis by puromycin pulse labeling in WT and RNase L -/-A549 cells 5 . Treatment of WT, but not RNase L -/cells with poly-IC halted global translation before ISG induction ( Fig. 4F and 4B ). RNase L -/cells exhibited a delayed and incomplete translational attenuation, presumably due to PKR. Translational arrest ahead of ISG induction was also present in HeLa cells (Fig.   S4 , B and C). Disengagement of basal protein synthesis before the IFN response was further confirmed using metabolic labeling of nascent proteome with 35 S (Fig. 4G) .

To examine IFN protein production under these conditions, we treated WT and RNase L -/cells with poly-IC and assayed the media for IFN activity (Fig. 5A) . These tests revealed a time-dependent increase of media antiviral activity and media ability to induce ISGs, which developed after RNase L-mediated translational arrest (Fig. 5B, and fig. S8 ). At time points well beyond translational arrest, we observed an increase in antiviral activity (Fig. 5C ) and ISG induction by two orders of magnitude from media of poly I:C-treated WT and RNase L -/cells (Fig. 5D ). In agreement with the ISG induction readout, media from WT and RNase L -/cells exhibited comparable antiviral activity and similar time-dependent increase of IFN potency (Fig. S9) . These data suggest that shutdown of bulk translation by RNase L thus does not inhibit IFN production. To test whether IFN arises from actively ongoing translation rather than from other potential mechanisms (e.g. delayed secretion of pre-translated IFN stores), we used pulse-treatment with a translation inhibitor, anisomycin (Fig. 5E ). In this setting, cells were first treated with poly-IC for three hours, which stopped protein synthesis but did not yet activate a strong transcriptional IFN response. Next, anisomycin was added to arrest all protein synthesis and the cells were kept for three additional hours. Control cells were kept for the same duration without anisomycin. During the last hour, media was changed to remove poly-IC, but anisomycin treatment was continued to keep the cells translationally arrested. When IFN activity in the media was assayed, we found The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

A control experiment showed that anisomycin was compatible with IFN sensing by naïve cells (Fig. 5F ). Of note, anisomycin had a mild stimulatory effect on ISG mRNAs due to an unknown mechanism; this effect acted in the opposite direction from blocking IFNs and thus did not affect the suitability of anisomycin as a control in our tests. Together, our experiments indicated that IFNs are indeed translated when the bulk of protein synthesis remains silenced by 2-5A. A549 cells treated with poly-IC express both type I and type III interferons ( Fig.   6A ). To determine which of these IFNs escape RNase L in our experiments, we employed hamster CHO reporter cell lines developed previously for specific detection of human IFNs of type I and type III. Hamster cells do not respond to human IFNs, however the reporter cells are rendered sensitive via expression of chimeric type I and type III human IFN receptors fused to a potent STAT1 docking domain 41, 42 . The reporter cells analysis, based on readout of phospho-STAT, indicates the presence of type I and type III IFNs, exhibiting strongest p-STAT response to IFNs- ( Fig. 6B and fig. S10 ).
