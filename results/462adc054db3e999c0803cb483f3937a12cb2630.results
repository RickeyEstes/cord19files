One hundred and one patients were recruited. Patients were excluded due to surgery without CPB (n = 7), death before the seventh day post-surgery (n = 6), absence of a temporal acoustic window bilaterally (n = 10), or poor quality recordings (n = 11). The 67 patients (51 male) included in the study were aged 64.3 Â± 9.5 years. EuroSCORE was 5 (3-7) and echocardiogram LVEF was 40% (35-45). Patient demographics and baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1 .
