During the study period, the air temperatures and relative humidity were 16.1-26.6uC and 42.5-77.7%, respectively, in the pediatric emergency room, and 13.7-24.8uC and 50.4-84.7% in the pediatric outpatient department. The CO 2 concentrations were 404-704 ppm in the pediatric emergency room and 372-2,575 ppm in the pediatric outpatient department. The mean concentrations of 10 mm (PM 10 ) and 1 mm (PM 1 ) particles were 8.9 mg/m 3 and 17.0 mg/m 3 , respectively, in the pediatric emergency room, and approximately 105 mg/m 3 and 167 mg/m 3 , respectively, in the pediatric outpatient department. Filter samples without airflow passage were selected as negative controls. The adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were not found in the blank filters. Also, PCR positive rates of the positive controls containing adenovirus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae in the sampling filters are 100%. The monthly detection rate (18.3%) of the adenovirus in the air samples of the pediatric emergency room of the medical center was clearly higher than that of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (0.9% of the air samples) (p = 0.009) (Fig. 1) . Around 45.8% of the air samples from the pediatric outpatient department contained Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Other pathogen, adenovirus (9.8% of the air samples), was also found in the pediatric outpatient department. In this study, airborne particles that contained adenovirus were detected in the pediatric emergency room throughout the year except in March to May, and October ( Fig. 2A) . Detection rates of airborne adenovirus DNA products in the filter samples in the pediatric emergency room were high in July (33.3%) and August (66.7%). The airborne Mycoplasma pneumoniae DNA products were detected in the pediatric emergency room only in July (11.1% of the air samples). The airborne particles that contained adenovirus concentrations ranged between ,10 copies/m 3 and 104 copies/ m 3 in the pediatric emergency room. The median concentration of airborne adenovirus DNA was highest in December. Only one air sample in the pediatric emergency room was positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae DNA product (645 copies/m 3 ). The detection rate of adenovirus-containing particles in the air samples in the pediatric outpatient department peaked in July (66.7%) (Fig. 2B) . However, airborne particles that contained Mycoplasma pneumoniae were found in the pediatric outpatient department throughout the year except in February to June. High detection rates of airborne Mycoplasma pneumoniae DNA products in the filter samples were found in August (83.3%), September (100%), October (88.9%), and November (100%), and January (100%). The detected concentrations of adenovirus in the air in the pediatric outpatient department ranged from 48.4 copies/m 3 to 461 copies/m 3 , and the median concentration was highest in March. The concentrations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in airborne particles ranged between 114 copies/m 3 and 9.9610 4 copies/m 3 in the pediatric outpatient department. The median concentration of Mycoplasma pneumoniae DNA product in the air of the pediatric outpatient department was highest in October.
