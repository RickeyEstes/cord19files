If not specified, the evaluation results in this section only came from the WTP regions of each IRT or ST. The WTP of IRT-1/ST-1 was the whole FOV and the WTP of IRT-2/ST-2 was only part of the FOV where the uniformity was the best (Fig 3) . If the WTP regions are defined in a different way, the evaluation results might be different.
