Out of a total of 14,560 pediatric patients seen during the research period, 502 multiplex RT-PCRs were performed on hospitalized patients. Altogether, 82 were excluded because the test had been performed on a patient without a diagnosis of acute respiratory infection or the patient had traveled outside of Bogotá during the 2 weeks prior to being hospitalized. A total of 420 patients were included; the median age in the analyzed group was 43 months (IQR 9-101) in the HMPV positive group and 21 (IQR 6-57) in HMPV negative group (P = 0.08). The proportion of affected girls and boys was similar between groups (P = 0.51) ( Table 1) . In 291 (69.3%) cases, at least one microorganism was detected, the most frequently isolated etiological agents being rhinovirus/enterovirus (30% (CI 95 25-34%)), RSV (19% (CI 95 15-23%)), parainfluenza 3 (7.4%), and adenovirus (5.7%). A 5.2% (CI 95 3.3-7.8%) HMPV infection prevalence was found (22 patients), making it the fifth most frequently isolated virus ( Table 2) . Within this group, in 17 out of 22 cases, HMPV was the only virus detected. Viral coinfection was documented in 22.7% of cases. The most frequent viral association was with the rhinovirus/enterovirus complex in 60% of children, followed by influenza A/H1-2009 and parainfluenza 3. In this regard, the frequency of HMPV viral coinfection is greater (22.7 vs 14% P = 0.03) than the viral coinfection of the other viruses detected. Bacterial coinfection was documented in 27.3% of patients with HMPV and in 38% of children with other infections. Of the patients studied, 26.6% (n = 112) were previously healthy and had no chronic medical conditions. The following comorbidities were found in the entire study group: congenital heart disease (16.2%), prematurity (13.1%), liver disease (12.6%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (12.4%), cancer (11.9%), transplant (11.2%), kidney disease (9.5%), and malnutrition (35.9%). No statistically significant differences were found between those with or without metapneumovirus infection and the presence of any of the described comorbidities ( Table 1) . The most frequent diagnoses for both groups were pneumonia (50%), bronchiolitis (18.3%), and rhinopharyngitis (14.1%). Altogether, 77.3% of metapneumovirus infections were community-acquired, as well as 69.4% of other respiratory infections ( Table 1) . The median hospital stay for the group with HMPV infection was 10.5 days (IQR 6-26) and for those without HMPV infection was 12 days (IQR 6-27) (P = 0.42). Of the patients with HMPV infection, 54.5% required admission to the intensive care unit, and in the group without this infection, the rate was 48.5% (P = 0.58). The need for mechanical ventilation showed a similar behavior between both groups. Therefore, 66.7% (n = 8) of patients with HMPV infection required ventilatory support (58.3% invasive and 8.3% non-invasive) with a median duration of mechanical ventilation of 7 days (IQR [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Similarly, 48.2% (93) of children without HMPV infection required mechanical ventilation (20.9% invasive and 2.5% non-invasive) with no significant difference in terms of need (P = 0.88) and duration of mechanical ventilation (6 days, IQR 3-14) between the groups ( Table 3 ). The global mortality was 7.1% of the study sample (HMPV 13.6% vs non-HMPV 6.8%, P = 0.2). Out of the 22 patients with HMPV, 54% were found to have severe respiratory infection (Table 4 ). This group with severe HMPV, 58.3% were under 2 years old, while only 20% of those without severe HMPV infection belonged to this age group (P = 0.27). Viral coinfection was more frequent in the group with severe HMPV infection (n = 12) (33% vs 10%, P = 0.32), compared to those who did not have it. Likewise, the bacterial coinfection rate was considerably greater in patients with severe infection (50%) compared to those who did not have severe infection (10%) (P = 0.16). The rainfall in the city of Bogotá was analyzed using the average rainfall reported by the 14 IDEAM (Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies) monitoring stations (Fig. 1) . Typical tropical zone behavior was observed with a greater frequency of viral infections during the rainy season. The Spearman Rho correlation analysis showed a moderate correlation (r = 0.44, P < 0.02) between the presence of HMPV infection and the highest rainfall peaks, just as occurs with RSV (r = 0.32, P < 0.02) (Fig. 2) . However, this correlation was not seen with the rhinovirus/enterovirus complex, which was the most frequently detected co-infecting agent for HMPV (r = − 0.13).
