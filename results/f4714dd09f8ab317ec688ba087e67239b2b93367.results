The few CEA gene families that have been studied in detail revealed a perplexing diversity, the reason for which is still unknown. In order to elucidate the forces which shaped the CEA gene families in mammals, we analysed all publicly available whole mammalian genomes with high (5-12X) as well as with low coverage (~2X) for the presence of CEA gene family members (Table 1) . We used the sequences from known members of the CEA gene family of humans, mice and dogs to search for CEACAM genes in other species, assuming that the CEACAM genes of all mammals are composed of the principle exons found in these species [4, 5] . Our exon predictions were validated by a comparison with EST information when available. With the possible exception of exons encoding cytoplasmic domains with ITAM in marsupials (see below), we did not find any new exons that had not been seen before in humans, mice, rats and dogs, indicating that the variability of the CEA gene families in eutherians is due to the different arrangement of these basic exons.
