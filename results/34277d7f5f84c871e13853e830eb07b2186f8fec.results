Advax-formulated vaccines induce polyfunctional CD4 + T cells. CysVac2, a fusion protein comprising the M. tuberculosis Ag85B and CysD antigens, was previously found to provide protective immunity against pulmonary M. tuberculosis challenge in mice when formulated with MPL combined with dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DDA) 23 . Because of its high adjuvanticity, MPL is reported to be highly reactogenic 24 and does not adequately stimulate long-term T cell memory 25 . As concerns of MPL-DDA toxicity make the combination unsuitable for human use, there was a necessity to identify an alternative safe and effective human adjuvant for CysVac2 to advance to human trials. Advax adjuvant has proved safe and well tolerated in human influenza vaccines 20 and hence we sought to test its ability to enhance CysVac2-induced protective immunity. Mice were vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 3 doses of CysVac2/Advax or CysVac2/Advax incorporating CpG (Advax CpG ) and immunogenicity was assessed by examining CysVac2-specific responses in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 4 weeks after the last vaccination. The CysVac2/Advax CpG group showed a high frequency of triple positive IFN-γ + IL-2 + TNF + and double positive IFN-γ + IL-2 + producing CD4 + T cells in antigen-stimulated PBMCs (Fig. 1A,B) . By contrast, the levels of these poly-functional T cells induced by CysVac2/Advax were much lower (Fig. 1B) . Examination of the frequency of IFN-γ-secreting cells by ELISPOT demonstrated that both CysVac2/Advax and CysVac2/Advax CpG induced comparable IFN-γ responses (Fig. 1C) . No IL-17A production was detectable from PBMCs from mice vaccinated with either CysVac2/Advax formulation (data not shown). Together, these results show that vaccination with CysVac2/Advax CpG , and to a lesser extent CysVac2/Advax, induces a vaccine-specific Th1-like response. Protection afforded by CysVac2/Advax against aerosol M. tuberculosis infection. Considering the Th1 response elicited by the Advax-adjuvanted vaccines, we next determined if they could afford protection against low dose aerosol challenge with virulent M. tuberculosis. Vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with BCG, CysVac2/Advax or CysVac2/Advax CpG resulted in an approximate 1 Log 10 reduction in lung M. tuberculosis CFU counts compared to unvaccinated mice, and this difference was statistically significant ( Fig. 2A ). CysVac2/ Advax CpG induced the greatest level of protection, although this was not significantly greater than that seen in CysVac2/Advax-vaccinated mice. The protection afforded by CysVac2/Advax CpG was equivalent to that observed with BCG (Fig. 2) . The lungs of unvaccinated mice were characterised by large unorganised areas of inflammatory infiltrate mostly composed of cells with large amounts of cytoplasm, most likely macrophages (see Supplementary  Fig. S1 ). In the lungs of BCG-vaccinated mice there was generally less tissue involvement with smaller lesions of macrophage-like cells and high numbers of lymphocytes. Lungs of both CysVac2/Advax-and CysVac2/ Advac CpG -vaccinated animals demonstrated reduced cellular infiltration with more organisation and were characterised by the presence of higher number of lymphocytes compared to the unvaccinated group. These results indicate that CysVac2 when formulated with Advax adjuvant formulations can reduce pulmonary bacterial load and infection-induced pathology in mice challenged with aerosolised M. tuberculosis. Post-challenge immune response induced by Advax-formulated vaccines. We next looked for the pattern of post-challenge immune responses that correlated with protection in Advax-vaccinated mice, initially by the determination of cytokine-release by cells taken from mice 28 days post-challenge and stimulated ex vivo with CysVac2 or its individual protein components (Ag85B or CysD). The highest level of IFN-γ production was observed upon CysVac2 or Ag85B re-stimulation of cells from CysVac2/Advax CpG -vaccinated animals (Fig. 3A) . IFN-γ responses were next highest in cells from CysVac2/Advax-vaccinated animals, which were higher than the levels for unvaccinated mice (Fig. 3A) , correlating with the general pattern observed in the pre-challenge cytokine profiles (Fig. 2) . Re-stimulation with CysD protein induced lower levels of IFN-γ release, with the highest response measured in the CysVac2/Advax vaccinated group (Fig. 3A) . While TNF release was low (pg/ml range) in all groups, nevertheless it was increased for CysVac2/Advax and CysVac2/Advax CpG -immunised mice (Fig. 3B) . No increase in IL-17A production was detected for any group (Fig. 3C ). SCIEnTIFIC REPORTs | 7: 8582 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-09119-y To further characterise immunity post-challenge, the frequencies of antigen-specific, multi-cytokine-secreting CD4 + T cells were compared between groups. CysVac2/Advax CpG -vaccinated mice had the highest frequency of multifunctional IFN-γ + IL-2 + TNF + and IL2 + TNF + CD4 + T cells (Fig. 3D) . A similar profile was observed for CysVac2/Advax-vaccinated mice, albeit at a lower frequency. This expansion of multi-functional cells was The number of IFN-γ producing cells after CysVac2 re-stimulation was determined by ELISPOT (C). Data (average ± SEM) is representative of two independent experiments. Statistical significance between the groups was determined by ANOVA (*P < 0.05, **p < 0.01; **p < 0.001).
