Sequence 2,975,516 bp and 381,545 bp sequences were assembled for two FLA regions on the pericentromeric and subtelomeric positions of feline chromosome FcaB2. The first sequence covers from KIFC1 gene in the extended class II region through the entire class II, class III and a part of class I regions from the point adjacent to BAT1 gene through HLA-B, -C class I corresponding region, TRIM39 plus HLA-92 (HLA-L) region to alpha satellite-rich region. The second sequence covers from telomeric repeats rich region through TRIM 26/15/10 genes to the third olfactory receptor like gene (GenBank accession Nos. EU153401, EU153402).
