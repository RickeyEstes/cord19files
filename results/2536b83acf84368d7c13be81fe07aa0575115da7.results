In Figure 1 we present the results of a null-model in which there is no age-specific susceptibility (z i 1), and plot the associated scaling factor Ïƒ for each of the 152 countries included in Prem et al.'s study. That is, we assume that the reproduction matrix R is directly proportional to the contact matrix K. The constant of proportionality will be the ratio between the leading eigenvalues of the two matrices, i.e. R 0 divided by the leading eigenvalue of K. To obtain the reproduction matrix for some other country, we just multiply its contact matrix by the constant of proportionality we estimate for China. Figure 2 presents the estimated scaling factors based on the age distribution reported by two studies of the early dynamics in China: Li et al. [1] which reports on the first 425 confirmed cases; and Yang et al. [2] which examines data from the first 4021 confirmed cases. (Our estimates of the scaling factors for each of the 152 countries is given in the Supplementary Material.) In Figure 3 (a) we plot the scaling factors obtained through our consideration of age-dependent susceptibility (figure 2) against the factors obtained by assuming homogeneous susceptibility across age groups (figure 1). Allowing for age-dependent susceptibility substantially increases the amount of variation in scaling (and thus in basic reproductive ratio) by country, and in particular can lead us to predict much larger scaling factors. When the transmission structure is modelled as a simple scaling of a population's contact patterns, the variation in scaling is driven by the variation in average intensity of contacts (captured by the eigenvalue of the contact pattern matrix K) by country. When we incorporate age-dependent susceptibility, contact patterns involving members of highly susceptible age classes becomes particularly important -generating a 3 .

For COVID-19, this means that we see higher scaling factors in countries with older populations, since this usually means contacts involving older individuals are more common. In countries with comparitively younger populations, contacts involving older individuals are less common and so the capacity of the infection to spread is reduced relative to the purely-contact pattern based transmission model. Figure 3 (b) illustrates this principle for Niger (which is predicted to have one of the lowest scalings of the reproductive ratio) and Poland (which is predicted to have one of the highest scalings) in comparison to China. The population pryamid of Niger is dominated by young children; China has a relatively stable agestructure although there are more individuals in 30-54 age classes than in younger age-groups; the pryamid for Poland shows even fewer children and substantial proportions into older age-classes. We therefore observe 5 .

This point is seen to hold for all countries investigated (Figures 1 and 2) . In Figure 1 , we see that without age-dependent susceptibility transmission is low in many European countries as well as in South Korea and Japan, and high in many African countries, consistent with the differences in daily number of contacts predicted by Prem et al driven by the proportion of children. However, the maps in Figure 2 demonstrate that when age-specific susceptibility is taken into account, the pattern of infectious potential by country is generally reversed. We then expect to see higher transmission in Eastern Europe (including Italy which had the largest number of cases in Europe in late February 2020) and Japan, and reduced transmission across Africa, central America, the Middle East and India.
