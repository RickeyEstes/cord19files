This study aims to identify a cross-reactive and conserved potential vaccine candidate with the help of a comprehensive bioinformatics approach. In silico approach may prove as a beneficial and directive approach, whereas conventional methods focus more on pathogen cultivation and protein extraction, where testing of these proteins on a large scale is expensive and time-consuming 27, 28 . Several in silico vaccine candidates have been reported by researchers which were known to produce promising preclinical and clinical trial results 29, 30 . In the present study, putative antigenic protein has been identified, of which B-cell (linear and conformational) and T-cell epitopes (HTL and CTL) have been predicted for the designing of peptide vaccines against leptospirosis. Identifying the highest antigenic protein. The selection of optimal immunogen is the first step for vaccine design; hence, to identify the most probable antigenic protein, the whole proteome of LIC constituting a total of 3654 proteins was analysed using VaxiJen v2.0 server. An overall score depicting antigenicity for each protein sequence was evaluated which indicated their potentiality to induce immune response; from which, 21 proteins having highest antigenicity score (>1.0) were selected for further analysis (Supplementary Dataset Table S1 ).
