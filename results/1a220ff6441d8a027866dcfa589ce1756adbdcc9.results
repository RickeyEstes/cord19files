Although the health of the animals was generally good throughout the study several deaths occurred. These were confined to females at the time of parturition, mainly in F l generation animals (Table 1 ). In addition a number of females from both F~ and F2b generations failed to nurse their litters, resulting in pup deaths. The occurrence of these changes was not related to treatment. The loss of litters following the first mating of the F 1 generation was so great that insufficient pups survived for a full continuation of the study. The F1 animals that survived were remated and despite the recurrence of the signs of ill-health in a number of pregnant females, a sufficient number of young and range of litters survived to allow the study to be continued. There were occasional differences between treated and control groups, but overall there were no adverse treatment-related trends in either food or water consumption or in body-weight gain. Calculation of Brown HT intake, based upon body weight and food-intake data, indicated that the dose received by the treated groups was within 10% of that intended.
