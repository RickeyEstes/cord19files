RNF166 rather than its homologous proteins potentiates RNA virus-induced IFN-β production. RNF166 is closely related to RNF125, which has been reported to negatively regulate RIG-Imediated anti-RNA virus signaling by conjugating ubiquitin chains to RIG-I and leading to the degradation of RIG-I by the proteasome 23 . RNF125 and its homologous proteins RNF114, RNF138, and RNF166 form a subfamily of small C3HC4 RING ubiquitin ligases 28 , so we investigated whether RNF114/138/166 also play a role in RNA virus-induced IFN-β production. We transfected plasmids that encoded RNF114, RNF125, RNF138, and RNF166 into HEK293T cells to perform reporter assays. We found that overexpression of RNF166 but not it's homologous RNF114, 125, and 138, potentiated Sendai virus (SeV)-induced activation of the IFN-β promoter. However, RNF166 had no apparent effect on the overexpression of cGAS and the STING-induced activation of the IFN-β promoter (Fig. 1A) , suggesting that RNF166 specifically enhances RNA but not DNA virus-induced IFN-β production. Overexpression of RNF166 can also enhance the transcription of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like ISG15 and MX1 (Fig. 1B) . To determine whether endogenous RNF166 is involved in anti-RNA virus signaling, we generated stable RNF166-knockdown cell pools using shRNA plasmids that targeted five sites on human RNF166 mRNA. Two shRNA plasmids (#4 and #5) markedly inhibited the expression of endogenous RNF166 mRNA in HEK293T cells, whereas the #1, #2, and #3 shRNA plasmids had little effect on RNF166 mRNA (Fig. 1C) . We found that knockdown of RNF166 significantly inhibited the activation of the IFN-β promoter, transcription of IFN-β mRNA, and the secretion of IFN-β triggered by SeV infection (Fig. 1D,E) . We also generated stable RNF114-, RNF125-, and RNF138-knockdown HEK293T cell pools to determine their functions (Fig. 1F ). Consistent with a previous report that RNF125 acts as a negative regulator of the RIG-I-mediated signaling pathway 23 , knockdown of RNF125 slightly enhanced the SeV-elicited IFN-β production compared to the control cell pool, while knockdown of RNF114 clearly enhanced the SeV-induced IFN-β production, and knockdown of RNF138 had no appreciable effect (Fig. 1G) . We further generated stable RNF166-knockdown cell pools with HeLa cells and obtained similar results; the production of IFN-β induced by SeV, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and human influenza A virus infection, as well as poly (I:C)-transfection notably decreased when endogenous RNF166 expression was knocked down (Fig. 1H-K) . However, knockdown of RNF166 had no effect on DNA analog-induced activation of IFN-β (Fig. 1L) . These results suggested that RNF166 rather than its homologous proteins physiologically potentiates RNA virus-induced IFN-β production. RNF166 targets TRAF3 and TRAF6 to potentiate VISA-mediated antiviral signaling. We next determined which molecules are targets of RNF166 in the anti-RNA virus signaling pathway. In reporter assays, overexpression of RNF166 potentiated VISA-, but not the downstream kinase TBK1-mediated activation of the IFN-β promoter ( Fig. 2A) . Repoter Assay and Bioassay results showed that RNF166 but not the other RNFs potentiated VISA-mediated transcription and secretion of IFN-β , while the overexpression of RNF114 or RNF125 had inhibitory effects (Fig. 2B) . Accordingly, knockdown of RNF166 inhibited VISA-but not TBK1-mediated activation of the IFN-β promoter (Fig. 2C) . These data suggested that RNF166 acts on signaling components that are downstream of VISA and upstream of TBK1. We next used co-immunoprecipitation to determine whether RNF166 interacts with VISA and its downstream components. Overexpressed RNF166 markedly associated with TRAF3 and TRAF6 in 293T cells, and also interacted with VISA, but had no detectable interactions with RIG-I, MDA5, TBK1, and IRF3 (Fig. 2D) . RNF166 was subsequently shown to co-localize with TRAF3 and TRAF6 in co-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2E ). Overexpressed RNF166 localized predominantly in the cytosol as dots which were probably aggregates of RNF166 protein. Double immunofluorescent staining showed that overexpressed TRAF6/3, especially TRAF6, had a similar distribution pattern and overlapped with RNF166, while we did not detect co-localization between RNF166 and VISA. To define these interactions under physiological conditions, we set out to determine associations between endogenous RNF166 and the targets. As we could not obtain an effective antibody to detect endogenous RNF166 through preparation or commercial purchase, we performed immunoprecipitation between overexpressed RNF166 and endogenous TRAF3 and TRAF6 with or without SeV infection. Overexpressed RNF166 weakly interacted with endogenous TRAF3 and TRAF6, and SeV infection greatly enhanced these interactions (Fig. 2F) . These data suggested that RNF166 associates with TRAF3 and TRAF6 during viral infection. To further clarify whether RNF166 targets TRAF3 and TRAF6, we used shRNA to knockdown endogenous TRAF3 or TRAF6, and found that RNF166 no longer potentiated VISA-induced IFN-β activation when TRAF3 or TRAF6 expression was suppressed (Fig. 2G) . These data further supported the idea that RNF166 targets TRAF3 and TRAF6 to potentiate RNA virus-induced IFN-β production. Both TRAF3 and TRAF6 play a critical role in SeV-induced interferon-β production in HEK293T cells. That TRAF3 acts as a critical adaptor in RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling has been demonstrated by several studies 29, 30 , but its role has been doubted recently 13 . So we then determined whether TRAF3 or TRAF6 plays a critical role in SeV-induced IFN-β production by using shRNA to stably knock down endogenous TRAF3 or TRAF6 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A) . We found that VISA-mediated activation of the IFN-β promoter, SeV-induced transcription, and the secretion of IFN-β were markedly reduced (Figs 2G and 3B), and SeV-induced phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF3 was apparently inhibited when TRAF3 or TRAF6 expression was suppressed (Fig. 3C) . (C) HEK293T cell pools with stable knockdown RNF166 were generated by shRNA. Knockdown efficiency was determined by RT-PCR (left) and Q-PCR (right). (D) SeV-mediated activation of the IFN-β reporter was inhibited when the endogenous RNF166 was stably knocked down. Transfection and luciferase assays were performed as in (A). (E) SeV-induced IFN-β production by 293T-shRNF166-#4 and #5 cells was lower than by 293T-shGFP cells. Cells (1 × 10 6 ) were infected with SeV. 12 h after infection, cells were analyzed by Q-PCR (left) and the supernatants were collected for IFN-β bioassays (right). (F) HEK293T cell pools with stable knockdown of RNF114, RNF125, and RNF166 were generated using shRNA. Knockdown efficiency was determined by RT-PCR (left) and Q-PCR (right). (G) SeV-induced IFN-β production by cell pools with stable knockdown of RNF114, RNF125, and RNF138. Cells were infected and analyzed as in (E). (H) The knockdown efficiency of RNF166 in HeLa cells was determined by RT-PCR. (I-L) SeV-, EMCV-infection, poly (I:C)-transfection(4 ug) and Influenza A-infection, rather than dsVACV-transfection(4 ug) induced production of IFN-β by HeLa-shRNF166-#4 and #5 cells were lower than by HeLa-shGFP cells. Q-PCR and bioassays were performed at 12 h after treatment as in (E). Each graph represents the mean ± SD of three independent experiments done in triplicate. ***indicates P < 0.001; **indicates P < 0.01; ns (not significant) indicates P > 0.05. To further determine the function of TRAF3 and TRAF6, we generated TRAF3 or TRAF6 knockout HEK293T cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Fig. 3D) . Phosphorylation of IRF3 triggered by SeV-infection was greatly inhibited and the production of IFN-β was blocked when TRAF3 or TRAF6 was deleted (Fig. 3E,F) . These results suggested that both TRAF3 and TRAF6 play a critical role in SeV-induced IFN-β production in HEK293T cells. Functional domain mapping of RNF166. RNF166 contains a RING domain, a zinc finger domain, and an ubiquitin-binding domain (UIM) (Fig. 4A) . To dissect the functional role of these domains, we generated three deletion mutants and assessed their ability to up-regulate SeV-induced IFN-β production. We found that the presence of an intact RING domain is essential for RNF166 function, as overexpression of a RING deletion mutant (RNF166 Δ RING) failed to enhance, but rather inhibited the activation of the IFN-β promoter induced by SeV and the overexpression of VISA, while the UIM (1 μ g) . At 12 h after transfection, cells were infected with SeV, and at 24 h after infection, mRNA of P protein was determined by Q-PCR. (F) RNF166 interacted with TRAF3 and TRAF6 via its zinc-finger domain. Transfection and immunoprecipitation (IP) were performed as in Fig. 2 (D) . Each graph represents the mean ± SD of three independent experiments done in triplicate. ***indicates P < 0.001; **indicates P < 0.01; ns (not significant) indicates P > 0.05. domain deletion mutant (RNF166 ∆UIM) had no apparent effect (Fig. 4B,C) . Consistently, on infection with NDV-eGFP (Newcastle disease virus-enhanced green fluorescent protein), we found that overexpression of RNF166 in HEK293T cells rendered them remarkably resistant to NDV infection and reduced the levels of NDV-eGFP-positive cells, while the RING deletion mutant had the opposite effect (Fig. 4D) ; and the same results were obtained when RNF166 or RNF166 Δ RING were co-expressed with VISA. Also we found overexpression of RNF166 can inhibit the replication of SeV (measured by mRNA level of SeV P protein), while the RING delete mutant enhanced the proliferation of SeV (Fig. 4E) . These data indicated that the RING domain is indispensable for the ability of RNF166 to up-regulate cellular anti-RNA virus activity. We further performed co-immunoprecipitation to detect which domain of RNF166 is required for interactions with TRAF3 and TRAF6. The results showed that the RING deletion and UIM deletion mutants interacted with TRAF3/6 just like full-length RNF166, while the mutant carrying the RING domain only did not (Fig. 4F) , suggesting RNF166 interacts with TRAF3 and TRAF6 via its zinc finger domain, and the RING domain is necessary for its positive regulatory function.
