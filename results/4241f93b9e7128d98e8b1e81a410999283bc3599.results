Most models overestimated influenza effects with a few exceptions observed for the models selected by the minimal GCV ( Figure 2) . Estimates tended to have larger biases as the seasonal confounding of the simulated data increased. Overall the models selected by PACF, QAIC and QBIC had the larger biases (ranging from 0.0022 to 0.2909) than did those selected by GCV (ranging from 0.0008 to 0.007) (Figure 2 ). Standard error of influenza coefficients was comparable between these four criteria, ranging from 0.0012 to 0.0045. RMSE was similar between the models selected by PACF, QAIC or QBIC when the df of smoothing functions for time were less than 5 per year, but dramatically increased when the df increased to 5 or more per year ( Figure 2 ). The RMSE of GCV criterion remained lower than those of the other three criteria (Figure 2 ). Biases and RMSE did not markedly change when the predetermined coefficient for influenza proxy variable of weekly positive proportions changed from 0.33 to 0.1 and 0.5 ( Figure S1 ). Among the four criteria, GCV still provided the smallest bias and RMSE under the different simulation scenario. Sensitivity analysis of a shorter study period of 2003-2008 or 2006-2008 showed slightly higher RMSE than those from the whole study period, but GCV provided smaller biases and RMSE compared to the other three criteria ( Figure S2 ). In the models with the lag effects of up to 3 weeks, GCV still provided the smallest biases and RMSE for influenza coefficients ( Figure S3 ). Figure 3 shows the percentage difference between the estimated excess ARD hospitalization rates and directly observed admission rates of influenza cases in the pediatric cohort from 2003 to 2008. For the age groups of 021and 10218 years, the best-fit models selected by GCV provided the estimates closer to the observed rates than did those selected by QAIC, QBIC and PACF ( Figure  S4 ). Estimates from the four criteria were comparable for the 122 and 225 age groups. All the Poisson models respectively selected by the four criteria slightly overestimated the true rates for all the age groups, except that the PACF and GCV criteria provided the estimates smaller than the observed rates in the 5210 age group. Among the four criteria, GCV had the smallest biases and RMSE, whereas QAIC and QBIC had the largest (Table 1 ).
