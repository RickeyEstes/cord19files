The short peptide P9 exhibited the highest antiviral activity among mBD4-dervied peptides, smBD4, and rmBD4. Eleven mBD4-derived peptides were designed and synthesized (Table 1) . Their antiviral activity against influenza virus H1N1 was evaluated in MDCK cells. Among all short peptides, P9 showed the strongest antiviral activity (Fig. 1a) . Interestingly, the dose-dependent antiviral effect of P9 was stronger than those of synthetic mBD4 (smBD4) and recombinant mBD4 (rmBD4). In particular, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of P9 was 1.2 μ g/ml, which was lower than those of smBD4 (3.2 μ g/ml) and rmBD4 (1.5 μ g/ml) (Fig. 1b) . Furthermore, the 50% toxic concentrations (TC 50 ) of P9, smBD4 and rmBD4 were 380, 280 and 360 μ g/ml, respectively (Fig. 1c) . The selectivity index of P9 was 316, which was higher than those of smBD4 (87) and rmBD4 (240). Notably, both of the liquid form and powder form of P9 demonstrated stable shelf lives as they exhibited similar antiviral activity after storing at − 20 °C for more than 1 year ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Taken together, among smBD4, rmBD4 and the 11 peptides derived from mBD4, P9 exhibited the highest antiviral activity and selectivity index. Thus, P9 was selected for further studies. P9 protected mice against lethal challenge of H1N1 virus. We further evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of P9 in a lethal mouse model of H1N1 influenza (Fig. 2) . The mice were intranasally (i.n.) inoculated with P9 (50 μ g/mouse) or rmBD4 and then i.n. challenged with lethal dose of H1N1 virus. The dose of 50 μ g/mouse was applied for animal experiments because it was shown to protect all mice from lethal challenge of H1N1 virus. The survival rate of P9-pretreated mice (100%) was significantly higher than those of rmBD4-pretreated mice (20%, P < 0.01) and untreated mice (0%, P < 0.0001). Notably, pretreatment with P9 and Zanamivir achieved a similar protection effect (Fig. 2a) . In parallel, when the mice were i.n. inoculated with 3 doses (50 μ g/dose/day) of P9, rmBD4 or Zanamivir at six hours after the lethal challenge with the virus (Fig. 2b) , the survival rate in P9-treated mice (60%) were significantly higher than those of untreated control and rmBD4-treated mice (P < 0.05). In this setting, treatment of zanamivir yielded a similar level of protection (80%) in comparison to P9 (P > 0.05). All infected mice suffered from body weight lost regardless of treatment types. However, the survived mice began to regain body weight at ~10-12 days post-infection (Fig. 2c,d) . The viral RNA copies and viral titers in lung tissues of infected mice were detected by real-time RT-PCR ( Fig. 3a) and plaque assay (Fig. 3b) , respectively. The viral loads in lung tissues of P9-pretreated and P9-treated mice were significantly lower than that of the untreated mice (P < 0.05). Histopathological examinations revealed that the alveolar damage and interstitial inflammatory infiltration in untreated mice or mice pretreated or treated with rmBD4 were substantially more severe than those in mice pretreated or treated with P9 (Fig. 3c) . The stability of P9 in vivo was evaluated by P9 biodistribution in mouse lungs and its antiviral activity at different time-points after P9 administration. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2a , P9 could be detected on the surface of mouse bronchial tubs at 10 min, 2 h and 4 h after P9 administration, but the signal decreased to almost undetectable level at 8 h after P9 administration. In the in vivo protective experiment, when P9 was administrated to mice at 2 h, 4 h and 8 h before the challenge, it protected 60%, 30% and 20% mice from lethal challenge of H1N1 virus, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. 2b ). These results indicated that P9 could maintain more than half of its antiviral activity at 2 hours and about 1/5 antiviral activity at 8 hours after administration. The in vivo toxicity of P9 was also assessed in mice. Each mouse was i.n. inoculated with P9 (50 mg/kg) or intra-peritoneally (i.p.) injected with P9 (500 mg/kg) per day for 3 days. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 3 , less than 10% of body weight loss was observed in the first 3 days and the body weight began to recover when the treatment was stopped at day 3. There was no obvious reduction of food consumption or sickness during the 10-days observation period. Collectively, our data demonstrated that P9 exhibited prophylactic and therapeutic effects against lethal challenge of H1N1 virus in mice, accompanied with a low toxicity in vivo.
