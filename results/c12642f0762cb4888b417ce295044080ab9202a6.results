We previously found that, in OVA-sensitized and -challenged mice with allergic airway inflammation, RV infection increases eotaxin-1, IL-4 and IL-13 production from alternatively-activated (M2 polarized) airway macrophages, further enhancing eosinophilic inflammation and airways hyperresponsiveness [6] . We also found that in vitro exposure of macrophages from naïve mice to IL-4 and IL-13 significantly increased RV-induced eotaxin mRNA expression, consistent with the notion that type 2 cytokines are sufficient to alter the response of macrophages to RV infection. In the present study, we hypothesized that IL-4 signaling determines the state of macrophage activation and pattern of RV-induced exacerbation in mice with allergic airways disease. First, we tested the responses of bone marrow-derived macrophages from naïve wild-type and IL-4R KO mice. We anticipated that the loss of IL-4R signaling would increase type 1 (IL-1β, TNF-α) and IL-17A-dependent (IL-17A, CXCL1, CXCL2, IL-6) responses [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] to RV. Dissociated marrow cells were differentiated to macrophages in L929-conditioned medium [9] . Macrophages from naïve wild-type mice showed significant increases in IL-1β, TNF-α, CXCL1 and CXCL2 mRNA expression in response to RV infection ex vivo (Figure 1 ). Bone marrowderived macrophages from naïve IL-4R KO cells also showed increases in IL-1β, TNF-α, CXCL1 and CXCL2 mRNA expression. However, compared to control cells, IL-4R KO cells demonstrated significantly increased IL-1β and CXCL2 in response to RV infection. Further, in contrast to cells from wild-type mice, RV infection of macrophages from naïve IL-4R KO mice significantly increased mRNA expression of IL-17A and IL-6. These results suggest that, in the absence of IL-4R signaling, macrophages show an exaggerated type 1 phenotype and increased IL-17A mRNA expression in response to RV infection. Next, we examined the effect of IL-4R KO in mice sensitized and challenged with OVA and infected with RV. As previously [17] , RV alone had modest effects on airway neutrophilic inflammation and responsiveness (not shown). As expected, OVA treatment of wild-type mice significantly increased the total number of BAL cells (Figure 2A ), augmenting the number of neutrophils and eosinophils ( Figure 2B and C). RV infection of wildtype mice further increased lung inflammation, resulting in an additional 2-fold increase in BAL cells. Both neutrophils and eosinophils were increased in the BAL following RV infection. In IL-4R KO mice, OVA sensitization and challenge was also accompanied by a significant increase in BAL inflammatory cells (Figure 2A ). The inflammatory cells consisted nearly exclusively of neutrophils, and the number of eosinophils in the airways was significantly reduced compared to wild-type mice ( Figure 2B and C). When OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice were infected with RV, neutrophil infiltration further increased ( Figure 2B ). In contrast to wildtype mice, RV did not induce eosinophilic inflammation. Finally, we found that, similar to wild type mice, IL-4R KO mice showed OVA-induced airway hyperreactivity which was further exacerbated by RV ( Figure 2D and E). (There was no difference in airway reactivity between the wild-type and IL-4R KO OVA/RV groups.) Together, these results show that IL-4 receptor signaling is not required for allergen-induced airway inflammation or hyperresponsiveness. Instead, the immune responses to OVA challenge and RV infection were differentially regulated in the absence of IL-4R signaling, accentuating neutrophilic rather than eosinophilic inflammation. To determine the factors driving neutrophilic inflammation in IL-4R KO mice, we analyzed lung mRNA expression by qPCR ( Figure 3A ). In OVA-treated wild-type mice, RV treatment increased TNF-α and IFN-γ mRNA expression. RV infection of OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice significantly increased TNF-α, IFN-γ, CXCL1, IL-12p40 and IL-17A mRNA levels compared to OVA alone. Finally, compared to OVA-treated, RV-infected wildtype mice, OVA-treated, RV-infected IL-4R KO mice showed increased IL-12p40 and IL-17A mRNA expression. Considering the neutrophil-recruiting ability of TNF-α and CXCL1 [18, 19] , and the capacity of IL-17A to indirectly stimulate recruitment of neutrophils into the airways via the induction of C-X-C chemokines [10] [11] [12] [14] [15] [16] , these results suggest that neutrophilic inflammation in the airways of OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice was mediated, at least in part, by the induction of TNF-α, CXCL1 and IL-17A. We also examined BAL fluid protein levels ( Figure 3B ). We found that, compared to similarly-treated wild type mice, TNF-α and IL-12p40 levels were significantly higher in the lungs of OVAtreated, RV-infected IL-4R KO mice than wild type mice, consistent with an enhanced type I immune response. To examine the specific role of the macrophage in airway neutrophilic responses, we isolated adherent BAL cells (>90% macrophages) from OVA-sensitized and -challenged wild-type and IL-4R KO mice and infected them with RV ex vivo. As shown previously [6] , macrophages from wild-type mice treated with OVA expressed high levels of the M2 marker Arg 1 and Ym-1, and expressed the type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 upon RV infection, typical of alternative activation ( Figure 4A ). In contrast, macrophages from OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice failed to express significant levels of Arg-1 or Ym-1, and did not express IL-4 or IL-13 mRNA with RV infection. IL-4R KO mice also showed reduced expression of the M2a markers CCL17 and CCL24 ( Figure 4B ). There was no change in the response of IL-10 and CD86, M2b markers ( Figure 4C ), or CXCL13, an M2c marker ( Figure 4D ). On the other hand, IL-4R KO macrophages showed more potent "classical" M1 cytokine responses to RV infection, including TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-12p40 ( Figure 4E ). Moreover, the basal level of IL-17A gene expression was increased in macrophages from OVAtreated IL-4R KO mice ( Figure 4F ). Finally, analysis of macrophage supernatants confirmed increased production of TNF-α and IL-17A protein in cells from IL-4R KO Figure 1 Responses of bone marrow-derived macrophages to RV infection. Dissociated marrow cells from wild-type and IL-4R KO mice were differentiated to macrophages in L929-conditioned medium. Compared to control cells, IL-4R KO cells demonstrated increased RV-induced cytokine responses. (Mean ± SEM, n = 3, *different from medium, P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA; †different from wild-type, P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). mice ( Figure 4G ). These results suggest that, upon OVA treatment, IL-4R KO macrophages are polarized towards an M1 phenotype, leading to a differential response to RV infection compared to wild-type mice. Next, we examined the effect of IL-4R KO on macrophage activation in vivo. We reasoned that, in the absence of IL-4R signaling, RV infection of OVA-sensitized and -challenged mice would fail to induce type 2 cytokine production and, instead, increase type 1 and IL-17A cytokine production from conventionally-activated macrophages, augmenting neutrophilic rather than eosinophilic inflammation. Lungs of wild type and IL-4R KO mice were examined by flow cytometric analysis. Lung cell suspensions were stained with antibodies against macrophage surface markers. As we found previously [6] , in wild-type mice, there was expansion of a subpopulation of cells expressing the macrophage alternative activation markers CD206 and CD301 after OVA challenge ( Figure 5A ). Further, IL-13 production by CD11b+ macrophages was increased with OVA treatment and further increased with RV infection ( Figure 5B and C). In contrast, in IL-4R KO mice, there was no appearance of a new population of CD206and CD301-expressing cells ( Figure 5A ) nor was IL-13 increased after OVA treatment or RV infection ( Figure 5B and C). These data suggest that IL-4 signaling is required for alternative activation of lung macrophages and production of effector cytokine IL-13 in this experimental system. We asked whether type 1 cytokine production is increased in macrophages from OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice in vivo. We collected the lungs of wild type and IL-4R KO mice, stained for TNF-α and analyzed with flow cytometry. We sorted for CD11c-CD11b+ non-resident, exudative macrophages [20, 21] . We found that, compared to wild-type mice, TNF-α producing CD45+, F4/ 80+, CD11c-, CD11b+ macrophages were increased in OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice, and these cells were further increased with RV infection (Figure 6A and B) . To test whether macrophages secrete IL-17A in vivo, we examined the lungs of wild type and IL-4R KO mice by flow cytometric analysis. We found that CD45+, TCRβ-, CD68+, F4/80+, CD11c-, CD11b+, IL-17A+ macrophages were increased in naïve IL-4R KO mice compared to wild-type mice, and further enhanced with RV infection (Figure 6C and D) . We also employed immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence microscopy to confirm IL-17A localization in lungs from OVAtreated IL-4R KO mice. IL-17A+ monocytic cells were evident in the subepithelium ( Figure 6E ). IL-17A colocalized with CD68, a macrophage marker ( Figure 6F ).
