During the study period, 10,830 samples were collected, of which 438 were excluded because of coinfection, and 25 because they were caused by influenza C virus. Therefore, 10,367 samples were analyzed, of which 3241 (31.3%) were positive for influenza (2035 influenza A only and 1196 influenza B only), 50.3% were female, 51.7% were aged <15 years, and 10.9% presented comorbidities. The most frequent clinical manifestations were fever (86.3%) and cough (80.9%; Table 1 ). The WHO definition of ILI showed the highest sensitivity (82%) and the lowest specificity (37%), whereas the ECDC ILI case definition showed the lowest sensitivity (58%) and the highest specificity (52%). The most predictive case definition for laboratory-confirmed influenza was the WHO case definition for ILI, in both all weeks (aDOR 2.69; 95% CI 2.42-2.99) and in epidemic weeks (aDOR 2.20; 95% CI 1.90-2.54). The ECDC acute respiratory infection (ARI) definition had the worst performance (aDOR 1.45; 95% CI 1.33-1.58 for all weeks and 1.36; 95% CI 1.21-1.54 for epidemic weeks). The clinical manifestations that were significant positive predictors of laboratory-confirmed influenza were fever, cough, myalgia, headache, malaise, and a sudden onset of symptoms. Fever had the highest aDOR in all weeks (4.03; 95% CI 3.38-4.80) and in epidemic weeks (2.78; 95% CI 2.21-3.50; Table 2 ). The performance of the case definitions and the specific clinical manifestations by age group and the presence of comorbidities for all weeks is shown in Table 3 , and for epidemic weeks in The performance of case definitions and symptoms in all weeks and in epidemic weeks for the influenza A and influenza B cases was similar (Figure 1 ). influenza A and influenza B cases was similar (Figure 1) . For the influenza A virus, the WHO ILI case definition showed the best performance in both all weeks (aDOR 2.81; 95% CI 2.47-3.20) and in epidemic weeks (aDOR 2.16; 95% CI 1.82-2.57). The symptom that performed best in both was fever in all weeks (aDOR 4.29; 95% CI 3.46-5.32) and in epidemic weeks (2.72; 95% CI 2.06-3.59). For the influenza B virus, the WHO ILI case definition also showed the best performance in both all weeks (aDOR 2.47; 95% CI 2.11-2.91) and in epidemic weeks (aDOR 2.23; 95% CI 1.81-2.75). Fever was the symptom with the best performance both in all weeks (aDOR 3.58, 95% CI 2.73-4.71) and in epidemic weeks (3.00, 95% CI 2.11-4.25).
