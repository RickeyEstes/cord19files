Variables affecting the odds of a farm having above-median mortality rates are displayed in Table I . Within-farm factors affecting individual calf survival to weaning and in the prenatal period (~< 28 days) are shown in Tables II and III , respectively, and are discussed in some detail in the next section. In all cases, only odds ratios significant at P ~< 0.05 are shown. For other variables, or levels of variables, only the direction of the effect is shown. A negative sign indicates an odds ratio of < 1, that is, a sparing or beneficial effect. For the subset of 614 calves in which the effect of estimated birth weight could be assessed, it was found that this variable did not significantly affect calf survival. The direction of the coefficient (P <; 0.15) indicated an odds ratio of < 1, that is, that heavier calves tended to survive better than lighter calves. Similarly, in the subset of 682 calves in which housing (CALF-HOUSING) and age at removal (REMOVAL-AGE) could be assessed, neither variable exterted a significant (P ~< 0.05) impact on calf mortality, although both did enter the logistic model. For CALF-HOUSING, odds ratios of < 1 were seen for 'hutches' and 'other' relative to individual pens, and > 1 for group pens. Nevertheless this variable became nonsignificant, even at P ---0.15, once other variables in the model were controlled for. REMOVAL-AGE remained significant only at P ~< 0.15; calves left longer with the dam tended to have an increased probability of dying. No variables had any significant impact on age at death, although calves born in maternity pens tended (P = 0,062) to die younger than calves born elsewhere. aOdds ratio of dying in the time from birth to weaning, controlling for farm, month and year of birth. Only odds ratios significant at P ~ 0.05 are shown. Lemeshow and Hosmer's statistic, p-value = 0.838. A larger p-value indicates a better fit of the model to the data. b See text for details. CThe odds ratio for chlorhexidine was 0.000031, with a 95% CL of (0.0000023, 0.00040), that is, calves whose navels were treated with chlorhexidine were at least 2500 times more likely to live (based on the upper limit of the 959'0 CL) than calves whose navels were not treated at all. They were at least 1800 times more likely to live than calves whose navels were treated with iodine.
