The mean age of Kawasaki group (28 boys and 27 girls) was 28.2±25.2 months, and that of the control group (30 boys and 13 girls) was 28.5±17.2 months. Among 55 Kawasaki disease patients, coronary dilatation was observed in 17 patients (8 boys and 9 girls, Table 1) Frequencies of ACE genotypes (DD, ID, II) were 12.7%, 60.0%, 27.3% in Kawasaki group, and 41.9%, 30.2%, 27.9% in control group respectively, indicating low rate of DD genotype (p<0.01, odds ratio=0.2) and high rate of ID genotype (p<0.01, odds ratio=3.3) among Kawasaki patients (Table 2) . Comparing allelic (I, D) frequencies, I allele was more prevalent in Kawasaki group than in control group (57.3% vs. 43.0 %, p<0.05, odds ratio=1.78, Table 3 ). In Kawasaki group, both genotype (DD, ID, II) and allelic frequencies were not statistically different between those with coronary dilatations and those without (
