Treatment with CQR results in a lower body and visceral adipose tissue weight in an HFD-rat model. After 3 weeks, at the point of CQR intervention, the body weight of rats in the HFD group was significantly higher than those in the ND group (Fig. 1A) . The body weight increase was alleviated by CQR between weeks 8 and 11 and following 11 weeks intervention; HFD+CQR rats had a significantly lower body weight than HFD rats (Fig. 1A) . Food intake was significantly lower in HFD rats compared with ND rats (Fig. 1B) , however energy intake was significantly higher (Fig. 1C) . CQR did not exert a marked effect on food and energy intake. At the end of week 11, HFD+CQR rats had a notably lower visceral (epididymal and perirenal) adipose tissue weight (Fig. 1D ) and a significantly smaller adipose cell diameter compared with the HFD group ( Fig. 1E and F). Subcutaneous adipose tissue weight did not differ significantly across all groups (Fig. 1D) . These results suggest that CQR treatment may inhibit HFD-induced obesity. CQR treatment affects lipid levels in the serum. The HFD group exhibited significantly higher levels of total C, TG and LDL-C in the serum compared with the ND group (Table I) . CQR significantly attenuated these lipid levels compared with the HFD. However, CQR did not reverse the decrease in serum HDL-C induced by HFD (Table I) .
