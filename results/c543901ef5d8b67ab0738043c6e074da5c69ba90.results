Eight variable selection methods were applied in order to find the best GDA equation which is able to discriminate between natural and random chain proteins. Eight models were constructed using embedded/non-embedded Star Graph TIs obtained with S2SNet application and forward, backward and best subset model types. The values obtained for the training/predicting accuracies are presented in Table 1 . The forward stepwise selection variable method conjugated with the nE and E TIs provides the best results for our data set with values of correctly classified compounds of 91.01%, 90.06% and 90.77% for the training, cross-validation and full sets, respectively, and using a minimum number of 12 parameters (Eq. (15)). The embedded TIs have the name of the non-embedded ones plus ''e'' as suffix: Nat=Rnd À score ¼ 0:1 þ 4:8Sh0 þ 254:9H þ 1860:2W À 1931:0S þ 39:4J À 139:2X0 À 73:0X3 þ 146:7X4 À 159:3X5 À 6:6Tr4e þ 7:1X2e, where N is the number of studied protein sequences (Nat+Rnd), R c is the canonical regression coefficient, U is the Wilk's statistics, F is the Fisher's statistics and p is the p-level (probability of error). The present R c value shows a high level of correlation between the input variables and the classification of proteins. Wilk's U is used to measure the statistical significance of the discriminatory power of the model and has values from 1.0 (no discriminatory power) to 0.0 (perfect discriminatory power). The F value shows the statistical significance in the discrimination between groups, a measure of the extent to which a variable makes a unique contribution to a prediction of group membership. The values of the p-level of Fisher's test for the GDA is less than 0.05 and show that the hypothesis of group overlapping with a 5% error can be rejected (Hua and Sun, 2001 considered as excellent in the literature for LDA-QSAR models (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2004; Marrero-Ponce et al., 2004 . The parametrical assumptions such as normality, homoscedasticity (homogeneity of variances) and non-colinearity have the same importance in the application of multivariate statistic techniques to QSPR (Bisquerra Alzina, 1989; Stewart, 1998) as the correct specification of the mathematical form has. The validity and statistical significance of any model is conditioned by the above-mentioned factors. In our study, a simple linear mathematical form of the model has been chosen in the absence of prior information. Figs. 3 and 4 show that the training cases against the residuals did not present any characteristic pattern (Dillon and Goldstein, 1984) . The protein nos. 632 and 864 are the only two cases not shown in Fig. 4 because the corresponding raw residuals are clear distinct from the whole set, ca -7. They correspond to 1QWN, chain A (1014 AAs) and 1JZ8, chain A (1011 AAs). One possible reason for the apparent different statistical behaviour could be the limitation of the model when the length of the chains is greater than 1000 amino acids. It is possible that the star net TIs for large proteins become similar to the TIs of the random proteins. A different and better threshold for the a priori classification probability can be estimated by means of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (James and Hanley, 1982) . As the Fig. 5 clearly shows, one can see that the model is not a random, but a truly statistically significant classifier, since the area under the ROC curve (for both training ¼ 0.98 and validation ¼ 0.96) is significantly higher than the area under the random classifier curve random ¼ 0.5 ¼ diagonal line (Morales Helguera et al., 2007) .
