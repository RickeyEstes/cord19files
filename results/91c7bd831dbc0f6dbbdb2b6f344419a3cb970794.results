Viral safety of biological products derived from equine plasma is verified by testing the starting material of the process (hyperimmune horse plasma) for viral contamination 22 and by assessing the efficacy of the entire production process to inactivate infectious viruses 23 . As part of such a process, batches of plasma obtained from a hyperimmune horse, producing anti-botulinum antibodies, were routinely inspected for viruses by incubating the plasma in Vero and BHK cell lines and monitoring them for cytopathic effect (CPE). In one batch (H234), the presence of a virus was detected. The hyperimmune horse was closely monitored and did not show any clinical manifestation indicating viral infection. Although this batch of plasma was rejected and was not further considered for production purposes, identification and characterization of the virus present in the sample is of major importance for process assessment. For this purpose, we applied a straightforward procedure that has been established in our lab for the detection and identification of unknown viruses. This procedure involves preliminary virus enrichment in cell culture, which is followed by RNA extraction from the growth medium, rapid library preparation, HTS and bioinformatic analyses. Virus isolation and enrichment. Vero cells were infected with the virus-containing plasma and incubated for 6 days until a massive CPE was observed, which was followed by an additional round of viral enrichment. The viral titer in the supernatant was determined by a plaque assay to be 5.7 × 10 7 pfu/ml. TEM revealed the presence of spherical particles that were approximately 100 nm in diameter and had jagged edges (Fig. 1) . These results confirmed the presence of high-titer viruses in the sample. Nevertheless, the morphology observed was not pathognomonic for virus identification and could be associated with several viral families. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing. The SMARTer Pico RNA Kit we used in this study enables rapid and direct library preparation from very low amounts of starting material. This procedure, with adjustments made in our lab (see Methods), was performed by a single-tube process that involved RNA fragmentation, random priming, first-and second-strand synthesis, and depletion of the ribosomal cDNA originating from the Vero cells. The libraries were sequenced as single reads of 60 nucleotides by a MiSeq instrument, and the sequencing resulted in over 10 million passed-filter reads. The whole process, including RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing, lasted less than 12 hours. RNA from noninfected Vero cells served as a negative control for the above procedure. Primary analysis of sequencing results. To identify the virus in the sample, we initially utilized two rapid bioinformatic tools, MetaPhlAn2 and Pathoscope, which profile obtained reads by comparing the reads to databases of microbial genomic sequences. MetaPhlAn2 maps reads against a database of predefined clade-specific genetic markers originating from bacterial, fungal and viral genomes, while Pathoscope uses various databases of whole-genome sequences, containing over 10,000 complete bacterial, fungal and viral genome sequences. However, no significant viral hits were found by either computational method, indicating that the viral sequence is not present in the databases currently used for analysis. Four percent of the reads could be attributed to bacterial and fungal sequences or to controls that were added to the sample (PhiX174 and carrier RNA). Approximately 78% of the reads were mapped to the green monkey (C. sabaeus) genome, while in the negative control sample, over 90% of the reads were mapped, implying that these reads originated from the Vero cells. Notably, a significant portion of the reads (18%) could not be assigned to sequences in the databases. We hypothesized that the as-yet-unidentified viral sequences might be among these reads. To determine the origins of these unmapped reads, we applied a de novo assembly approach in order to obtain long continuous sequences (contigs) and reconstruct the viral sequence. Such contigs may then be subjected to sequence similarity searches against the entire NCBI nr/nt nucleotide collection and to characterization of the genome sequence of the virus. De novo assembly. Following the removal of sequences originating from the Vero host cells, the remaining reads were subjected to analysis by the Velvet assembler using optimized parameters obtained automatically from the multithreaded script VelvetOptimiser (see Methods). The assembly resulted in eight contigs with lengths ranging from 255 to 6834 bases (Table 1 ). In the control sample no relevant contigs were found. Each contig was subjected to a sequence similarity search against the nr/nt nucleotide collection using BLAST. Of these eight contigs, four (contigs 5 to 8) were highly similar to rRNA sequences, while one contig (contig 2) matched the PhiX174 genome. BLAST results for contigs 1, 3 and 4 did not show a complete match with any sequence in the database, with the best hits exhibiting less than 70% identity; contigs 1, 3 and 4 most resembled the L, M and S genomic segments, respectively, of viruses from the Orthobunyavirus genus (Fig. 2) . Notably, the lengths of the contigs were in best agreement with the typical lengths of the Orthobunyavirus genomic segments and substantially differed from those of other genera in the Bunyavirales order (Table 2 ). These results are consistent with the assignment of the generated sequences to the Orthobunyavirus genus, while the low sequence homology to known Orthobunyavirus sequences suggests the classification of this virus as a new species. Notably, the morphology of the virus, as observed by TEM, is consistent with this classification. We named the virus Ness Ziona virus (NZV) after the location it was discovered in. To verify the presence of NZV in the horse plasma, we designed a specific NZV RT-PCR test based on the assembled NZV S genomic segment. The test was conducted on the original plasma before culturing (H234) and after culturing (H234-Vero). A plasma sample taken from the same horse before infection (H210) was used as a control. The presence of the expected 162-bp band confirmed the existence of NZV in the infected H234 plasma and its absence from the preinfection sample ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Refinement of the genome assembly. Orthobunyavirus members are known to possess characteristic short consensus sequences at their termini (5′ and 3′) 24 . In-depth analysis of the NZV sequence revealed that some of the segment termini lacked this consensus sequence. We therefore applied an additional algorithm for de novo assembly using the SPAdes tool. This analysis resulted in contigs that were similar to but longer than those obtained from the Velvet algorithm, and these contigs included the conserved sequences at all termini, which were flanked by short sequences that were apparently host-derived [25] [26] [27] . To further refine and verify the sequences of the three segments, we realigned the original sequencing reads to the longer sequences obtained from SPAdes and removed low-quality alignments. This procedure resulted in high-quality, manually curated, www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ complete genomic sequences of the three segments of NZV. The complete genomic sequences were annotated and deposited in the NCBI GenBank (accession numbers MH018032, MH018033, and MH018034 for the L, M, and S segments, respectively). Comparison of the 5′ and 3′ ends of each of these NZV segments revealed that the novel virus contains a similar consensus sequence as other Orthobunyavirus species (Fig. 3) . These findings support the classification of NZV as an Orthobunyavirus. To further characterize the viral genomic sequence, we predicted potential open reading frames (ORFs) in the sequence. Each segment was found to encode a long ORF spanning nearly the entire segment (Fig. 4) , as expected for an Orthobunyavirus member 24 .
