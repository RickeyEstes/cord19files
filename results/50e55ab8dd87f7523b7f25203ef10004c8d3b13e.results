All the 26 mild cases (Male: Female ratio 12:14, age range 6-51 yrs) had fever/history of fever in last 3 days. The other symptoms included sore throat/cough (14/26), nasal discharge (6/ 24), headache/bodyache (5/26), diarrhea (2/26) and breathlessness (4/26). Radiological examination was not indicated and hence not performed. Nasal oxygen was not required. Of the 15 critically ill patients, 2 survived (Table 1 ). The male:female ratio was 6:9, the age range being 13-53 years. Associated co-morbidities were present in 1/2 surviving and 7/13 fatal patients. Importantly, radiological findings showed that all the fatal cases had $3/6 lung zonal involvement and required ventilator assistance. Both the surviving patients initially needed nasal oxygen but were put on ventilator subsequently. The patients were either treated with Osletamivir alone (n = 7) or in combination with Zanamivir (n = 8). From the endotracheal tubes of 4 patients Acenotobacter was isolated. None of the 26 mild cases had recognizable risk factors. S21, a 36 year female suffering from severe seasonal influenza survived after 39 days of hospitalization.
