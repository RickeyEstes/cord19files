With the dot blot hybridization assay for HSV-1 plasmid DNA, detection limits achieved with the chemiluminescent substrate AMPPD are 1.3 • 105 and 1.4 • 10 4 copies of target HSV-1 DNA, with a 30-min exposure performed 1 hr after substrate addition and a 45-min exposure performed 4 hr after substrate addition, respectively (results not shown). The sensitivity achieved with AMPPD is 25-to 100-fold higher than that obtained with the colorimetric BCIP/NBT substrate system (results not shown). Fig. 4 shows the time course of viral infection assayed by in situ DNA hybridization with chemiluminescence detection. Use of the AMPPD chemiluminescent substrate enables the detection of HSV-1-infected cells within 6 hr postinfection. Again, with this assay format, CCD detection and imaging may provide even greater sensitivity than that achieved with photographic film.
