All submitting veterinarians were personally contacted by telephone, and epidemiologic data were collected for all 62 isolates included in the study. Interviews with the veterinarians indicated that these farms represented a wide range of farm types, from single-site small family farms to multiple-site large corporate operations. Most farms (71%) were farrow-to-finish facilities; 6% were farrow-to-wean facilities, and 23% were wean-to-finish facilities. Farms varied widely with respect to their herd management practices and the clinical signs associated with their PRRS outbreaks (Table 1) . Complete ORF5 gene sequences were obtained for 55 of the 62 isolates, representing 46 of the 52 farms in the study. Genetic similarity between isolates ranged from 84.9 to 100%, with a mean pairwise difference at the nucleotide level of 1.4%. A detailed description of the genetic structure of these isolates is presented elsewhere (Goldberg et al., in press ). The sequences themselves are available through GenBank (accession numbers AF176424-AF176478). Several significant bivariable statistical associations between clinical disease signs were documented. Abortion was correlated with infertility in sows (OR 70; P < 0.001), death of sows (OR 19; P < 0.001) and preweaning mortality (OR 27; P < 0.001). Similarly, infertility in sows was correlated with both death of sows (OR 11; P 0.003) and with preweaning mortality (OR 14; P < 0.001). The presence of respiratory disease in finishing pigs was associated with longer time to market for these pigs (OR 14; P < 0.001). Weaker significant associations were also documented between infertility in sows and longer time to market for grow/finish pigs (OR 4; P 0.04), and between preweaning mortality and longer time to market for grow/finish pigs (OR 4; P 0.04). Abortion was non-significantly associated with longer time to market (OR 3; P 0.09). All other associations between clinical disease signs had probabilities !0.15. Table 2 presents the results of Mantel tests of matrix correlation used for investigating the relationship between the genetic similarity of PRRSV isolates and the similarity of their associated clinical disease signs. Only SOWDEATH was significantly correlated with genetic similarity between isolates (r 0.69; P 0.02). Pairs of farms experiencing deaths in their sow populations were therefore more likely to share genetically similar PRRSV isolates than chance alone would predict. The five predictors (farm characteristics) offered to the logistic multiple regressions (Table 3) accounted for the presence of clinical disease signs in only four cases: abortion, infertility in sows, death of sows, and respiratory disease in nursery pigs. In all cases, the Hosmer±Lemeshow residual test for goodness-of-fit of the logistic regression model was low, with all P values !0.365 (indicating adequate fit of the logistic regression model to these data). Total-confinement housing and PRRSV vaccine use were not associated with the presence of any clinical disease sign. However, larger herd size was associated with increased deaths in the sow population and with higher respiratory disease in the nursery. All-in±all-out management practices in the nursery were protective for abortions, infertility, and deaths in the sow population. All-in±all-out management practices in the finishing stages of production were protective for respiratory disease in the nursery. Paradoxically, all-in±all-out management in the finishing stages of production was associated with an increased risk of abortion and infertility in sows.
