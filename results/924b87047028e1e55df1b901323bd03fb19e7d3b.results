A total of 2221 cases with hospitalized CAP were included, and the most commonly identified pathogen was S. pneumoniae, accounting for 276 (12.4%) cases (Table 1) . After the exclusion of CAP cases caused by an unidentified pathogen, pneumococcal pneumonia represented 36.7% of remaining cases, followed by respiratory viruses and Staphylococcus aureus (Table 1) . Notably, the proportion of pneumococcal pneumonia among CAP cases declined significantly after 2010, when pediatric PCV13 was introduced, representing 15.5% of cases (126 of 814 cases) in 2007e2009, 10.3% (58 of 561 cases) in 2010e2011, and 10.9% (92 of 846 cases) in 2012e2013 (P Â¼ 0.004).
