The model population is structured into two non-mixing 'local' subpopulations, each composed of non-mobile (N M i ) residents in H i and non-mixing commuters (N C i ) moving between H i and S i . The subpopulations are connected by mixing commuters (MC i ) moving between H i and W , and the highly mobile (H M) population. We now examine the role of each of these demographic groups in determining key epidemiological characteristics such as the basic reproduction number, the final epidemic size and the maximum prevalence. We particularly focus on the contrasting roles of the two 'connecting' groups, the mixing commuters and the highly mobile population. To this end, the total population size is held constant, and the proportion of the population in the MC and H M groups combined is held constant at p = p MC + p H M . However, the distribution of the population between these two groups is adjusted with a parameter q where the proportion of the population in the H M group is pq and the proportion in the two MC groups is p(1 âˆ’ q), divided equally between each of them. If q = 0, there are no highly mobile individuals. If q = 1, there are no mixing commuters. The number of mosquitoes in each patch is held constant. Consequently, adjusting the population distribution between the MC and H M groups has two effects. It changes the nature of the connection, and so the dispersal of infection, between the two 'local' populations. It also changes the size of the human population present in each patch. This is important because of the dilution effect (Schmidt and Ostfeld 2001) . If the size of the human population increases, but the size of the mosquito population remains constant, then frequency-dependent biting means that each person is bitten less often. Hence, the expected number of mosquitoes infected by each infectious person decreases. But the expected number of people infected by each infectious mosquito does not change.
