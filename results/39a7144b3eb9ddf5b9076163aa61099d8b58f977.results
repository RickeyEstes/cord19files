From 2010 to 2014, 5662 participants were included in the ILI-002 study. From these, 96.89% had a 28-day interview, 1619 had no virus isolated, and 32 had no sample; additionally, 85 were excluded for other reasons such as bacterial infections (18 subjects), missing covariate information (11 subjects), and >2 viruses (56 subjects). The final data set had 3926 participants. Of the 3926 participants, 1856 (47.3%) were hospitalized, 1411 (35.9%) were <11 years old, and 308 (7.8%) were >60 years old; 1673 (42.6%) were males (Table 1) . Of the 1856 hospitalized cases, 65 died with 1 virus and 12 died with 2 viruses detected. Table 2 shows the distribution of participants with a single virus diagnosis across the covariates used in the logistic regression models. Influenza, HPIV, CoV, and RV were detected more frequently in participants 11-60 years old, whereas RSV, HMPV, HAdV, and HBoV were more common in children <11 years old. One virus was detected in 3285 and 2 viruses were detected in 641 participants (Table 3) . RV (n = 1433), influenza (n = 888), and CoV (n = 703) were the most frequently detected viruses (either alone or in co-infection). The most frequent combination was influenza+CoV (116 of 641 dual infections; 18%). Influenza was found in combination with other agents in 237 participants (37% of 641 dual infections). There were 52 subjects with a combination of >3 viruses. The numbers were too small to perform any statistical analyses but were analyzed descriptively. In the subjects with 3 viruses detected, 56% had RV, 54% had influenza, and 48% had CoV. The combination of 3 viruses that occurred the most often (in 6 subjects) was influenza, HMPV, and HBoV.
