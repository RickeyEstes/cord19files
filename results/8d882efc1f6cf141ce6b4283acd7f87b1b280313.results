Most participants (86%) were women and more than half (54%) were nurses (Table 1) . Of 265 healthcare workers who consented to participate, 158 (59.6%) started the course (recruitment and retention flowchart, Figure 1 ). The proportion of people dropping out, either before or after starting the course, differed by job type and gender (Table 1 ). Among nurses, 58% who consented to participate started the course (84 of 144) compared to 87% (45 of 52) of other professionals and 42% (29 of 69) of non-professional staff. Women were more likely to start the course (62%) than men (44%). Of the 158 hospital workers who started the course, 127 (80%) completed it. There was no significant difference between mid-course drop-outs and course completers with respect to gender or job type. Failure to complete the course after starting occurred in 6 of 51 participants (11.8%) assigned to the short course, 10 of 54 participants (18.5%) assigned to the medium course and 15 of 53 participants (28.3%) assigned to the long course. The trend to greater drop-outs with longer course was nonsignificant (Chi-square = 4.6, df = 2, p = 0.10). The cumulative time required to complete the course is illustrated in Table 2 . Participants showed significant improvements from the start to the end of the course in pandemic self-efficacy, confidence in training and support and interpersonal problems ( Table 3) . Dimensions of interpersonal problems which improved included problems with being socially inhibited, nonassertive, overly accommodating, self-sacrificing and intrusive/needy. Dimensions of interpersonal problems which did not improve were being controlling, self-centered and cold/distant (Table 3 ). It is noteworthy that the severity of interpersonal problems at T1 was mild, with mean scores near a score of 1 on a 0 to 4 scale. For the dimensions of interpersonal problems which did not show a significant overall change, the median score at T1 was 0.25 to 0.5. We therefore tested if there was a change in these dimensions among participants who reported problems (score > 0) at T1. Among these participants there was a significant pre-post decrease in problems with being cold-distancing (n = 104, pre: 0.9 ± SD 0.8; post 0.8 ± 0.8; 95% CI of difference -0.2 -0.0, p = 0.02) and selfcentered (n = 99, pre: 1.0 ± SD 0.9; post 0.8 ± 0.9; 95% CI of difference -0.4 --0.1, p = 0.001) but no significant change in controlling behavior. Coping with stress using problem-solving, seeking support from others or through escape-avoidance did not change over the course (Table 3 ). Since coping with problem-solving and seeking support was common at the start of the course, we tested if there was a pre-post improvement among people who were using less of these strategies (score <1.5). Among those who were under-utilizing problem-solving at T1, there was a significant pre-post increase (n = 72, pre: 0.9 ± SD 0.9; post 1.2 ± 0.6; 95% CI of difference 0.2 -0.4, p < 0.001). Similarly, among those who were under-utilizing support-seeking at T1, there was a pre-post increase (n = 72, pre: 0.9 ± 0.9; post 1.0 ± 0.5; 95% CI of difference 0.1 -0.3, p = 0.003). Among participants who reported any use of escape-avoidance at T1 (score > 0), there was a pre-post decrease in this mode of coping (n = 135, pre: 0.7 ± SD 0.5; post 0.6 ± 0.5; 95% CI of difference -0.1 -0.0, p = 0.01). Comparing the outcomes among the three doses of the Pandemic Influenza Stress Vaccine (Table 4 ) reveals that each course length resulted in improved self- Difference in drop-out status by gender, Chi-square = 6.8, df = 2, p = 0.03 efficacy and confidence in training and support. Total interpersonal problems decreased for participants of the medium and long courses but not for those who took the short course. Although there were trends toward a decrease in improvement in self-efficacy with increased course length, and an increase in improvement in interpersonal problems with increased course length, between-group differences in change scores were not statistically significant.
