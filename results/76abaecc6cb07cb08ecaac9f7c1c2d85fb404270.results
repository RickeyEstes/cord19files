The live body weight of piglets, volumes and weights of ovaries, mean numbers and diameters of ovarian follicles, their oocytes and germinal vesicles after 10-and 24-day (D) period of feeding and not feeding with flaxseed are shown in Table 2 . Flaxseed affected the weight of the piglets positively on both days (P < 0.05) of the supplementation when compared to the control animals. The weight (P < 0.05) and volume (P < 0.001) of the ovaries were higher on D24 of the supplementation compared to the controls, but they were not influenced by flaxseed supplemented milk diet (a shorter supplementation period). The flaxseed increased body weight, weight and volume of the ovaries on D24 of supplementation compared to D10 (P < 0.05; P < 0.001; P < 0.001, respectively). The ovaries of the juvenile piglets looked smooth with no visible follicles on their surface, even though the ovaries on D24 of the supplementation were the largest of all. The primordial, PRF and SF were found in the ovarian cortex. Ten-day flaxseed supplementation (flaxseed supplemented milk diet) in the experimental group of animals led to an increase in the average diameters of PRFs (P < 0.05) and SFs (P < 0.01), although their oocytes and germinal vesicles were not affected significantly. On D24 of the supplementation, an increased (P < 0.001) in size of the PFs and PRFs were recorded relative to the control group. The feeding of the flaxseed modulated the proliferation and apoptosis in the ovaries of problematic gilts treated with probiotics. Fig. 1 shows the photographs of representative ovary sections with IHC localisation of markers of proliferation (PCNA, cyclin B1) and apoptosis (caspase 3, bax). The theca cells were not positively stained. The colour development of the antigen PCNA was more pronounced in the control group of piglets compared to the group with the addition of flaxseed. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen was detected in both follicular cells and oocytes of all follicle types. The intensity of the IHC reaction (ROD) of the proliferation markers is summarised in Table 3. In the control ovaries (no flaxseed), the ROD of PCNA was higher on D24 in the follicular cells of all follicle types (P < 0.05), as well as in the oocytes of the PRFs (P < 0.001). Cyclin B1 was detected in the follicular cells of all follicle types. The ROD of cyclin B1 antigens was not changed significantly in the controls. The flaxseed decreased the ROD of the PCNA with the length of its supplementation from D10 to D24 in the follicular cells of PFs (P < 0.01) and their oocytes (P < 0.01), PRFs (P < 0.01) and SFs (P < 0.05). The ROD of cyclin B1 in the PRFs was affected negatively in a time-dependent manner (P < 0.001, D24 vs D10). When compared to the control animals, flaxseed supplementation increased the ROD of PCNA in all follicle types on D10 (P < 0.001, PFs; P < 0.05, PRFs; P < 0.01, SFs). The ROD of cyclin B1 in all follicle types showed lower intensity in the flaxseed group on both observed days (P < 0.05). The intensity of the ROD of apoptotic markers is summarized in Table 4 . In the control ovaries, the ROD of bax in the SFs decreased from D10 to D24 (P < 0.05), although in other follicle types it was not changed significantly. The ROD of caspase 3 in all follicle types decreased from D10 to D24 (P < 0.01, PRFs and SFs; P < 0.001, PFs). The flaxseed increased the ROD of bax in PFs and PRFs (P < 0.001, D24 vs D10) with the length of supplementation, but not in SFs. The ROD of caspase 3 in all types of follicles was affected positively in a time-dependent manner (P < 0.001, PFs; P < 0.05, PRFs; P < 0.01, SFs). When compared to the control animals, dietary flaxseed decreased the ROD of bax in PFs and PRFs on D10 (P < 0.01), but not in the SFs; however it was higher in all follicle types on D24 of feeding (P < 0.05). Flaxseed feeding decreased the ROD of caspase 3 in all follicle types on D10 (P < 0.05, PFs and PRFs; P < 0.01, SFs) and increased on D24 in PFs (P < 0.01) and SFs (P < 0.05), but not in the PRFs.

Serum steroid hormone levels in the control animals and animals fed flaxseed were more or less similar, thus no significant differences were observed. We measured a positive correlation in the serum level of IGF-I in the flaxseed group on D10 (P < 0.05) and D24 (P < 0.01) compared to the control group; although no significant effect between the groups were demostrated. The concentrations of fatty acids (FA) in the blood serum of the controls and flaxseed fed animals are shown in Table 5 . In the control group there was a significant decrease in the level of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; P < 0.001) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; P < 0.05) and total n-3 PUFAs concentration (P < 0.01) on D24 compared to D10. The ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs increased from D10 to D24 almost by 1.5 times (P < 0.01). Other FAs levels in the blood of the control piglets were not changed significantly. In the group of piglets fed with flaxseed, overall levels of saturated FAs (SFA) decreased, although the levels of the unsaturated FAs (USFA) (P < 0.001) and PUFAs (P < 0.001) increased. The monounsaturated FAs (MUFA) were decreased on D24 (P < 0.01). Particularly, levels of myristic (C14:0) and myristoleic (C14:1 n-5) acid decreased and arachidic acid (C20:0) increased from D10 to D24 (P < 0.05). The length of dietary supplementation by the flaxseed affected the serum levels of the following FAs: palmitic (C16:0), palmitoleic (C16:1 n-7) and osbond (C22:5 n-6) acids decreased, although ALA (P < 0.01), arachidic (P < 0.05), EPA (P < 0.001), clupanodonic (C22:5 n-3; P < 0.001) and DHA (P < 0.01) increased from D10 to D24. When compared to the controls, the flaxseed supplemented standard starting diet increased the concentration of myristic (P < 0.01), palmitic (P < 0.01), palmitoleic (P < 0.001), LA (P < 0.05), total SFA (P < 0.05) and n-6/n-3 ratio (P < 0.01), although arachidic (P < 0.001), eikosadienoic (P < 0.01), DGLA (P < 0.05), AA (P < 0.001), EPA (P < 0.001), adrenic (P < 0.05), osbond (P < 0.01), DHA Values are means ± SEM. x P < 0.05; y P < 0.01 indicating significant differences with the control; Ccontrol group (without flaxseed), Fsupplemental flaxseed group; IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor I. (P < 0.01), total USFA (P < 0.05), and total n-3 PUFAs (P < 0.01) were decreased on D10 (weaning day). The flaxseed supplemented milk diet (D24, 14 days after weaning) increased the levels of LA (P < 0.001), ALA (P < 0.001), EPA (P < 0.001), clupanodonic acid (P < 0.001), DHA (P < 0.05), total PUFAs (P < 0.001) and n-3 PUFAs (P < 0.001), while the levels of myristic (P < 0.05), myristoleic (P < 0.05), palmitic (P < 0.05), palmitoleic (P < 0.01), eicosadienoic (P < 0.01) acids, DGLA (P < 0.05), AA (P < 0.05), adrenoic (P < 0.001), osbond (P < 0.001) acids, total MUFAs (P < 0.01) and n-6/n-3 ratio (P < 0.001) were significantly decreased. The delta-6-desaturase activity was calculated as a ratio between EPA and AA (Table 5 ). In the control animals (no supplemental flaxseed) there was a higher activity of Δ-6-desaturase on D10 when compared to D24 (P < 0.001). The flaxseed supplementation increased the activity of Δ-6-desaturase in a time-dependent manner (P < 0.001). When compared to the control animals, its activity was lower on D10 (P < 0.001), although higher on D24 (P < 0.001).
