cDNA cloning and sequencing of four clones from the 3' end of the genome Starting material for cDNA cloning was approximately 3 pg of rate-zonally purified genomic RNA obtained from 500 ml of tissue culture medium. An estimated 70 ng of ds cDNA was generated and from this 670 white colonies were obtained. By colony screening, 89 colonies gave a strong signal to [32P]~DNA prepared from genomic RNA, and of these, 9 had inserts ranging from 1.2 to 4.1 kb as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis of linearized plasmids. The 9 clones were further analyzed to determine their restriction enzyme maps and poly(A) content. Only one of the clones, an insert of 1.2 kb identified as clone CB9, reacted strongly under hybridization conditions by Southern blotting to 32P-labeled oligo(dT). Three other clones identified as MN3 (2.1 kb), MA5 (2.8 kb), and MA7 (4.1 kb) were found to contain sequences that overlap with CB9 on the basis of hybridization and restriction endonuclease maps (data not shown). The orientation of all four clones in reference to the 20-kb virus genome and the restriction enzyme sites used for sequencing are illustrated in Fig. 1 . Our orientation presumes polyadenylation at only the 3' end of the genome and this is based on the documented 3' polyadenylation site in the avian infectious bronchitis virus and mouse hepatitis virus genomes (Lai et a/., 1981; Stern and Kennedy, 1980) . The strategy used for sequencing is described in the legend to Fig. 1 . Initially, clone MN3 was sequenced completely and was found to contain all of the N and part of the M sequences. Greater than 98% of the sequence containing the complete N gene was determined either by sequencing both strands of clone MN3 or by repeated sequencing of the same strand using different methods of end labeling. Some of the sequences were confirmed from subclones of MN3. To complete the sequencing of the M gene, clone MA5 was sequenced from its second Ddel site and parts of MA7 were sequenced as described in Fig. 1 . The total sequence of the M gene was determined by sequencing both strands of DNA and by repeated sequencing of some fragments using different methods of end labeling. The total nucleotide sequence of 2451 bases from the 3'end of the genome and the deduced amino acid sequences for the three largest open reading frames contained in this sequence are illustrated in Fig. 2 . All possible translation products were deduced for both virus-sense RNA and virus complementary-sense RNA (Fig. 3) because of the precedent that some singlestrand RNA virus genomes are of ambisense polarity (Auperin et a/., 1984) . RNA complementary to coronavirion-sense RNA could therefore theoretically function as mRNA. Figure The largest open reading frame extends from base 817 through base 2 160 and predicts a 448-amino acid protein of 49,379 mol wt. We conclude this to be the coding sequence for the nucleocapsid protein (N) for the following reasons: (i) The only BCV protein de-scribed to date that approaches this size is the 52-kDa phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (King and Brian, 1982) . (ii) The predicted protein is basic, a property expected of nucleic acid-binding proteins. Fifty-nine (13%) of the amino acids are basic whereas 43 (109/o) are acidic, giving the protein a net charge of +16 at neutral pH. (iii) The amino acids encoded by this sequence share extensive (70%) sequence homology with the N protein of the closely related mouse hepatitis virus strains A59 and JHM (Armstrong et al., 1983; Skinner and Siddell, 1983) . The N gene for BCV shares other properties with the N gene of MHV. (i) It is rich in serine. Forty-two residues of serine make it the most abundant amino acid. (ii) It is flanked on its 5'side by the gene for the M protein, and it is flanked on its 3'side by a noncoding region of 291 bases, only 3 bases fewer than that for MHV JHM.

Clone MN3 was sequenced completely and clones CB9 and MA5 were sequenced in part. The internal Ddel, Pstl, Sau3A I, and Xbal sites derived by restriction endonuclease mapping and the HindIll and SalI sites in the multiple cloning region of the pUC9 vector were the sites used for DNA sequencing. n , 0 and a indicate sites labeled at the 5' end using polynucleotide kinase for clones MN3, CB9. and MA5, respectively. l , 0, and 0 indicate sites labeled at the 3' end using reverse transcriptase, and the appropriate labeled deoxynucleotide triphosphate, for clones MN3, CB9, and MA5, respectively. 4 indicates sites labeled at the 3' end using radiolabeled cordycepin and terminal transferase for a subclone of MN3. (B) Strategy for obtaining the M gene sequence. Parts of clones MN3. MA5, and MA7 were sequenced beginning with the second Ddel site from the 5'end of clone MA5.H, Kl, and â€¢l indicate restriction sites that are 5'end labeled with polynucleotide kinase for clones MN3, MA5, and MA7, respectively. l and 0 indicate sites that were 3' end labeled using reverse transcriptase and the appropriate labeled deoxynucleotide triphosphate for clones MN3 and MA5, respectively. Uniquely labeled molecules for sequencing were obtained from gels after electrophoretic separation of restriction endonuclease-treated. end-labeled fragments or after strand separation. The orientation of the clones in the pUC9 vector are as shown except for CB9 which is inverted; i.e., the poly(A) end is next to the HindIll site of the vector. pUC9 sequences are indicated as a bold line at the end of the restriction endonuclease maps. genes is very similar. Beginning with the first base following the M gene termination codon, the sequence is UAUCUAAACUUUAAGG for BCV, and UCUAAAC-UUUAAGG for MHV. (iv) The consensus sequence surrounding the initiation codon for the N gene, AG-GAUGU, is the same, and is a preferred sequence for translation initiation among eukaryotic messenger RNAs (Kozak, 1983) . The second largest open reading frame predicts a protein having properties of the matrix protein and also identifies potential 0-glycosylation sites The second largest open reading frame extends from base 112 through base 804 and predicts a 230-amino acid protein having a molecular weight of 26,376 (Fig.  2) . This protein has extensive amino acid homology with the M protein of MHV A59 strain (Armstrong et a/., 1984) as expected from its close antigenic relatedness (Hogue et a/., 1984) and is therefore the apparent BCV counterpart (Fig. 4) . By maximum alignment of the proteins, 200 of the amino acids (>86%) are the same as 200 of the 228 in the MHV sequence, and another 16 (7%) represent conservative changes. Because of the strong similarity in structure between the BCV and MHV M proteins, the BCV M protein can be expected to have a similar topology with respect to the virion envelope (Rottier et a/., 1986). Namely, the central portion of the molecule would be expected to span the membrane three times, with approximately 28 amino acids (26 for MHV) at the amino terminus being external to the virion and approximately 100 amino acids at the carboxy terminus being internal to the virion. The protein is slightly basic, having a net charge of +9 at neutral pH. The basic amino acids are clustered in the carboxy terminal 40% of the protein. Within the carboxy terminal 100 amino acids are 14 of the 20 basic amino acids and 6 of the 14 acidic amino acids, giving this region of the molecule a net charge of f8. It is therefore reasonable to expect that this part of the molecule might be interacting with the negatively charged RNA as suggested (Sturman et al., 1980) or possibly with an acidic portion of the N protein to contribute to a direct interaction between the M and N molecules. We predict the latter occurs on the basis of a 1 :l molar ratio between the M and N proteins in BCV (King and Brian, 1982) . One hundred thirteen (49%) of the amino acids are hydrophobic and the distribution of hydrophobic amino acids is nearly identical to that for the MHV M protein.
