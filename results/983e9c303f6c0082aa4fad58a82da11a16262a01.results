The introduction of NGS has started a new era for the screening of pathogens carried by vectors like R. norvegicus. In this study, we have conducted metagenomic analyses of reads and de novo assembled contigs, allowing simultaneous identification of both known and unknown viruses. Samples from Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), Kuala Langat (Malaysia), Hong Kong (China) and five locations in the Copenhagen area (Denmark), were subjected to virion-enrichment approaches followed by metagenomic investigations of DNA and RNA. For each sample, sequencing libraries were prepared from both RNA and DNA. Altogether we generated more than 2.2 billion paired-end HiSeq reads and over 32 million paired-end MiSeq reads, from which 415.8 million contigs were generated, using the Ray Meta assembler. The contigs were aligned to genomes in a custom database identifying 2524 contigs mapping to known viruses from eukaryotic hosts and 875 000 contigs with similarity to other species, primarily bacteria. While mapping the contigs to the database can reveal information about the metagenomic diversity, the number of reads constituting these contigs may be used as an estimate of the abundance of the species present in the samples. Consequently, unique reads, mapping back to the contigs, were used to estimate the ratio of the reads classified into taxonomic kingdoms (Figure 1 ). More than 320 million unique reads mapped to the contigs. In libraries from each location, an average of~40 million unique reads mapped to contigs from the RNA libraries, a mean of 1.7% of these reads aligned to eukaryote-specific viruses; this proportion was only 0.015% for the DNA libraries ( Figure 1 ). We found that the greatest proportion of unique reads were either of unknown origin or mapped to bacterial contigs. The number of unique reads varied between the different sampling locations, with CUH and AE yielding the highest number of unique reads from the RNA and DNA libraries, respectively ( Figures 1A and 1B) . Overall, substantially fewer reads from the RNA libraries could be mapped than from the DNA libraries. Despite this, we found 433 times more reads mapping to contigs resembling viruses of eukaryotes in our RNA library data. Although samples were sequenced to different depths, data sets with fewer reads still exhibited a proportionally larger number of reads mapping to viral contigs, for example, AE ( Figures 1C and 1D ). Contigs were grouped by taxonomic identity to genomic reference sequences and sorted according to the average length and the average identity to the closest related reference genome. All the grouped contigs showing identity to a eukaryote-specific viral reference genome are illustrated in Figure 2 . Combining the RNA and DNA data, a total of 169 contigs in 135 groups had an average length exceeding 500 nt and a mean nucleotide identity o70% to known viral genomes as illustrated in Figure 2 (panels A and B, lower right quadrant) and thus may represent sequences of new viruses. To obtain an estimate of the relative virus abundance for each sample we mapped all the unique reads onto the virus-associated contigs. The largest proportion of reads mapping to the contigs showed identity to the family Virgaviridae (n = 1 132 052), followed by Parvoviridae (n = 968 808). The third most prevalent group contained reads that were identified as specific viral species but for which there is no taxonomic family classification (n = 261 382). The fourth and fifth most prevalent families were the Picornaviridae (n = 236 450) and Retroviridae (n = 57 814) ( Figure 3) . Overall, almost 85% of the virusassociated reads mapped to the contigs from the four mentioned viral families. The samples from Hong Kong and the FHMS contained far fewer reads mapping to the viral contigs (only 0.41% of the reads in total). As the picornavirus family comprises many pathogenic species for humans and livestock, we conducted a more detailed analysis on these sequences. Our analysis of RNA libraries revealed 17 cases of contigs resembling putative picornaviruses having a mean length of more than 500 nt with o70% identity to published picornavirus genomes. These were found in samples across all localities except Hong Kong, and as expected, the laboratory rats from FHMS. Ten contigs from these cases showed between 85% and 96% identity (via BLASTn alignment) to the sequence of Boone cardiovirus (BCV) (which was not included in our custom database), apparently isolated from laboratory rat faeces. Hence, one contig covered a near-full-length genome (8485 nt) resembling the sequence of the BCV-1 isolate (GenBank JQ864242). Subsequently, picornavirus-like contigs (excluding the Kobuvirus genus) were aligned and placed onto a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of picornavirus reference sequences, using SEPP (see Materials and Methods section). SEPP analysis showed that 73 contigs across libraries from ten samples resembled Theiler's virus of rats (accession no. BAC58035.1), Rat theilovirus (for example, ACD67870.1) or Theiler's encephalomyelitis virus (for example, AGM61326). The identity of these contigs to the reference sequences ranged from 62% to 100% including a contig spanning 7625 nt with 84% identity to Theiler's encephalomyelitis virus, constituting a novel near-full-length viral genome (Supplementary Table  S1 ). The identified near-full-length genome has a number of indels compared with Theiler's encephalomyelitis virus genomes distributed without disrupting the ORF in each case, while introducing substantial changes in amino-acid residues. This sequence encoded the canonical DVETNPG/P motif at the junction of the 2A/2B protein coding regions. In addition, we found distinctive clustering of 11 contigs among the Boone cardiovirus sequences (Figure 4 and Supplementary Materials), including the 8485-nt near-full-length sequence mentioned above. Likewise, two contigs from data published elsewhere also belonged to this monophyletic group. Five contigs (356-2680 nt) coding for ORFs clustered basal to the Boone cardiovirus cluster and the larger cardio-/ Saffold virus cluster that comprised a total of 87 contig sequences. Four contigs, including one contig from elsewhere, 19 formed a monophyletic cluster with the Saffold virus reference sequences. Interestingly, the Boone cardiovirus and the other contigs within the cluster (n = 13) lacked the sequence encoding the DVETNPG/P motif. As this motif is required for separation of the viral 2A and 2B proteins, this finding was somewhat surprising. To ensure that the lack of cleavage motif was not due to an assembly error, we mapped the reads onto two Boone cardiovirus-like contigs exceeding 46.5 kb, and found that both showed high depth of coverage (mean 4280) that corroborates the findings. We found a total of five ambiguous nucleotide sites in the consensus sequence created from all the reads. None of these ambiguities disrupted the ORF. Furthermore, indels were found in a low fraction of reads (o6.7%), indicating that the contigs may be considered the best assembly from the reads. Hence the lack of DVETPNG/P motif is likely a biological occurrence. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that many of the identified viral contigs originated from novel cardio-or picornaviruses. The results imply that R. norvegicus may be a reservoir of picornavirus species far more diverse than the previously recognized. Outside the ORFs, we conducted consensus RNA secondary structure of the viral IRES sequences in the contigs. The predictions showed that the IRES domain structures were highly conserved among the contigs and the Boone cardiovirus reference sequence, supporting the relationship between these genomes (Supplementary Figure S1 ). In the present study, selected viral sequences identified from assembled contigs were reverse transcriptase PCR amplified from the sample extracts and subjected to Sanger sequencing. In addition, we performed alternative metagenomic analyses on data obtained from a different NGS platform (Ion Torrent) (Supplementary Figure S2) . In all the investigated cases, we obtained confirmatory results. In addition to the metagenomic analyses we applied DNA metabarcoding analysis of the faecal samples collected at six locations to assess the dietary composition of the investigated animals. Overall, the metabarcoding analysis suggested a varied composition of plant species in the rat diet. In the six samples, we found evidence of 22 different plant families including species of cereal or vegetables also common in human or household animal food (Supplementary Table S2 ).
