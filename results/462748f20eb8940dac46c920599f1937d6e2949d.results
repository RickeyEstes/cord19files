It has recently been demonstrated that immunologically na√Øve mice can be protected against challenge with a virulent strain of AHSV-4, by administering serum from mice previously vaccinated with MVA-VP2). This suggests that the protection afforded by MVA-VP2 vaccination is mediated mainly by antibodies (Calvo-Pinilla et al., 2014). However, it was shown in that study that MVA-VP2 vaccination also induced a CD8+ T-cell response. These studies have been extended to determine: (a) whether adoptive transfer of splenocytes from MVA-VP2 vaccinates could protect against AHSV-4 infection; and (b) whether protection by passive immunisation with antibodies from MVA-VP2 vaccinated mice could be observed when administered 48 h before, or 48 h after the challenge.
