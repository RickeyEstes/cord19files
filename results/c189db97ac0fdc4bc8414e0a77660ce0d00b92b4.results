The mean and median mortality on PMWS-affected and -recovered herds before the epidemic were 3.5% and 2.5% (range, 0.5-15.9%) and 3.4% and 3.3% (range, 1.0-10.5%), respectively. The mean and median mortality at the time of the visit on PMWS-unaffected farms were 3.2% and 3.0% (range, 1.0-6.0%). The mean and median peak mortality on PMWS-affected and -recovered farms, were 19.1% and 17.5% (range, 3.0-50.0%) and 19.0% and 20.0% (range, 8.0-25.0%), respectively. All herds had pigs with PCV2 antibody, although not all pigs had PCV2 antibody (Fig. 1) . The PCV2 antibody titre varied significantly between sick and healthy pigs (x 2 = 27.1, 7 d.f., P < 0.05). Pigs with higher or lower PCV2 antigen scores were significantly more likely to have a lower serum PCV2 antibody titre than pigs with middle values for PCV2 antigen (Fig. 2 ) (Kruskal-Wallis K value of 17.91, 5 d.f., P < 0.05). PCV2 antigen score was higher in sick pigs than healthy pigs within farms when adjusted for between farm variability using the sign test (Table 1) . It was also higher irrespective of our classification of PMWS herd status (Table 2), indicating that there was more PCV2 antigen in sick pigs but that this did not correlate with the PMWSstatus of the herd. The majority (90%) of healthy pigs had low PCV2 antigen score (<3+) but approximately 10% of healthy pigs from each type of PMWS herd had a PCV2 antigen score of >2+ (Table 2 ). There was no association between farm status and the distribution of PCV2 antigen among sick and healthy pigs ( Table 2) . The optimal PCV2 antigen score to differentiate sick and healthy pigs was >2+ from the ROC curve. A PCV2 antigen score >2+ was statistically associated with coalescence in the ileocaecocolic lymph node, lymphoid depletion in the ileocaecocolic lymph node and giant cells and absence of germinal centres in all three lymph nodes (Table 3) . These histological signs were also associated with sick pigs compared with healthy pigs (unpublished data). When the current study definition (Table 4 ) of PMWS affected herds was used as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of this cut off was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.49-0.65) and 0.19 (95% CI, 0.11-0.27). The sensitivity and specificity of the Sorden (2000) and Rose et al. (2003) or the Australian definition (Anon, 2005) (Table 4) were 0.90 (95% CI, 0.82-0.98) and 0.22 (95% CI, 0.14-0.29) and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.92-1.00) and 0.43 (95% CI, 0.35-0.51), respectively.
