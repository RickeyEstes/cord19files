To verify that the biological distance obtained in this way truly incorporates biological utility, we 158 A novel construction of genome space with biological geometry [Vol. 17, apply our new genome space to the phylogenetic analysis of organisms. Most existing methods for phylogenetic inference using biological sequences can be divided into two groups. The algorithms in the first group utilize various distance measures 12 -15 which are based on different models of nucleotide substitution or amino acid replacement, and then transform the distance matrix into a tree. In the second group of approaches, instead of building a tree, the tree that can best explain the observed sequences under the evolutionary assumption is found by evaluating of different topologies. This category includes parsimony 16 -18 and maximum likelihood methods. 19 -21 All these methods require a multiple alignment of the sequences and assume some sort of evolutionary model, which require human intervention. Thus, the results are usually controversial. However, our genome space does not need sequence alignment and any evolutionary model. It is totally automatically generated and avoids computation repetition. First, we consider the phylogeny of mammals. Mitochondrial DNA is not highly conserved and has a rapid mutation rate, thus it is very useful for studying the evolutionary relationships of organisms. 22 We extracted 35 complete mammalian mitochondrial genome sequences from the GenBank, each of which has length of more than 16 000 nucleotides. Moreover, they have double-stranded and circular structures. As mentioned in the previous section, because we have already known the gene content of both strands of these genomes, we just treat them as the single-stranded (by using the heavy strand) circular genomes. For this case, we treat every point as the start point in this circular sequence of length n, and then we get n linear single-strand genomes. For every linear single-strand genome sequence, by using the nucleotide vector system shown in Fig. 1 , we can compute its n-dimensional moment vector. Then, we take average by n for these n n-dimensional moment vectors to get a normalized moment vector (M 1 , M 2 , . . . , M n ). Here, we use the first 60 components of the moment vector (M 1 , M 2 , . . . , M 60 ) to characterize these 35 genome graphical curves and obtained 35 points in 60-dimensional genome space. By computing the Euclidean distances between these points, we got the distance matrix for these 35 organisms. The phylogenetic tree for them shown in Fig. 3 is generated using UPGMA program in the MEGA 4 package. 23 The last 10 mammals are grouped into a cluster because they are primates, and the phylogenetic relationship among them coincides with those found by Raina et al. 24 We also found that Norway rat, vole, and squirrel are grouped into a cluster for the reason that they are rodent species. In order to further illustrate the efficiency of our genome space, we then focus on the origins and evolution of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is a lentivirus that can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition in humans in which the immune system begins to fail, leading to life-threatening opportunistic infections. To develop the anti-HIV drugs and vaccines, the research into the origins and evolution of this virus has become very important. Rambaut et al. 25 reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of the primate lentiviruses including HIV-1, HIV-2, and the simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). It was discovered that the two human viruses are related to different SIVs and therefore have different evolutionary origins. However, in Rambaut et al.'s paper, the tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method on an alignment of the nucleotide sequences of polymerase gene in these lentiviruses. Generally, a single-gene sequence does not possess enough information to construct an evolutionary history of organisms, thus we use our new method to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree based on the whole genome sequences. The genomes of lentiviruses are single-stranded linear RNA. RNA has the base uracil (U) rather than thymine (T) that is present in DNA. In fact, these RNA genome sequences downloaded from GenBank have already been transformed into DNA sequences (change U by T). Thus, we treat them as linear DNA sequences. Using the nucleotide vector system shown in Fig. 1 , the sequence graphs of the genomes of the 33 lentiviruses were obtained. Here, we use the first 12 components of the moment vector to characterize these 33 genome graphical curves, and thus we obtained 33 twelve-dimensional vectors. These 33 vectors can be viewed as 33 points in a 12-dimensional genome space. By computing the Euclidean distance between these points, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of these primate lentiviruses (Fig. 4) using UPGMA program in the MEGA 4 package. 23 The figure illustrates that both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 lineages fall within that of the SIVs which are isolated from other primates, thus they represent the independent cross-species transmission events. In agreement with In addition, we apply our genome space to another field of virology: the taxonomy of coronavirus. To study the classification and phylogeny of coronaviruses clearly, we apply our genome space to a large set of 30 complete coronavirus genomes from GenBank, including the two newly sequenced human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, along with four genomes from Flaviviridae and Togaviridae which are not coronaviruses (outgroups). The coronavirus genomes are also single-stranded linear RNA. So, similar to the above lentivirus case, we treat these coronavirus genomes as linear DNA sequences. Their abbreviation, accession number, description, and classification are shown in Table 1 . First, we used our two-dimensional genome space (actually, it is a two-dimensional plane with the first two moments M 1 and M 2 being x-axis and y-axis) to characterize these '34' virus genomes and calculated '34' points in Fig. 5A . Four groups, group 1, group 2, group 3, and outgroups, can be seen in this figure as four distinct clusters. To study the classification for coronavirus clearly, we expanded it and obtained Fig. 5B . Based on genotypic and serological characterization, coronaviruses are divided into three distinct groups, with human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) being a group 1 coronavirus and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) being a group 2 coronavirus. There is one additional branch, the group 3 coronaviruses, which are found exclusively in birds. These three distinct groups of coronaviruses clearly form three distinct clusters in our two-dimensional Table 1 and obtained 34 two-dimensional vectors. These 34 vectors can be directly viewed as 34 points in a twodimensional genome space with M 1 and M 2 being x-axis and y-axis, respectively. (B) Thirty coronavirus genomes from Table 1 are viewed as 30 points in a two-dimensional genome space. No. 3] C. Yu et al. genome space. We also find that the newly discovered human coronavirus NL63 is very close to the human coronavirus 229E, and thus it is classified into group 1. This result is the same as the identification by van der Hoek et al. 27 Our two-dimensional genome space reveals that for human SARS-CoV, the most closely related coronavirus is from a small infected mammal, the palm civet (not a bird as initially suspected). This result coincides with those found by Guan et al. 28 For another newly discovered human coronavirus HCoV-HKU1, Woo et al. 30 classified it into group 2 because HCoV-HKU1 contains certain features that are characteristic of group 2 coronaviruses. However, these authors also stated that the proteins of HCoV-HKU1 formed distinct branches in the phylogenetic trees, indicating that HCoV-HKU1 is a distinct member within the group and is not very closely related to any other known member of group 2 coronaviruses. In our two-dimensional genome space, we found that HCoV-HKU1 is an individual coronavirus between the SARS group (which we suggest as group 4) and the traditional group 2, thus we propose that HCoV-HKU1 belongs to a new group 5. By computing the distances between the genomes in Fig. 5A , we also reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of these coronaviruses (Fig. 6 ) using UPGMA program in the MEGA 4 package. 23 Thus, the evolutionary relationship of these genomes is clearer.
