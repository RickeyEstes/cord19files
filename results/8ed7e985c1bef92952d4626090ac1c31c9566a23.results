The majority (22/34) of our informants for in-depth interviews were aged 18-35 years; approximately 1 quarter were illiterate or could only sign their name. Over two-thirds (13/17) of female informants described themselves as homemakers (Table 1 ). In total, 144 participants took part in our focus group discussions. There were 70 adult males and 32 adult females, and 20 school boys and 22 school girls. Adult male focus group discussion participants were mostly street vendors or laborers in urban sites, and in rural sites most of them were farmers. In both study sites, adult female focus group discussion participants were homemakers. In the analysis of the 34 in-depth interviews, 16 focus group discussions, and six unstructured observations, there were no notable differences in the findings between the heterogeneous groups. We found similar responses and behaviors related to respiratory infections between urban and rural residents, different socio-economic groups, Muslims and Hindus, and school students and trained paramedics and lay persons. Therefore we have provided a summary of the findings aggregated across all study participants.
