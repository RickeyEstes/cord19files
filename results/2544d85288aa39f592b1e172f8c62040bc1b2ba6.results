Virulent ASFV Armenia/07 infection inhibits mRNA production and secretion of IFN-␤. ASFV strains can either cause chronic, subclinical, or fatal, acute ASF disease. In order to study whether differences in ASFV virulence are related to differences in the activation of the innate immune response, we analyzed the level of IFN-␤ produced by porcine alveolar macrophages infected either with NH/P68 (attenuated) or with Armenia/07 (virulent) ASFV strains. For this purpose, a time course experiment in macrophages at 0, 4, 8, and 16 h postinfection (hpi) was performed. Figure 1A shows a higher production of IFN-␤ mRNA in cells infected with NH/P68 compared to those infected with Armenia/07, starting at 4 hpi with a maximum at 16 hpi, a time point where IFN-␤ mRNA was very low in cells infected with Armenia/07. Interestingly, we observed a significant increase of IFN-␤ mRNA in cells infected with NH/P68 from 4 to 16 hpi, indicating that cellular signaling leading to IFN-␤ transcription is activated during the course of the infection with the attenuated virus. Next, the amount of IFN-␤ secreted during attenuated versus virulent infections was determined. Supernatants from either NH/P68-or Armenia/07-infected macrophages were collected, and IFN-␤ levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 1B) . The results show a strong decrease of secreted IFN-␤ at 16 hpi, after an initial increase at 8 hpi, during the infection with the virulent strain, whereas in NH/P68-infected macrophages the amount of IFN-␤ increases over time. These data correlate well with the results obtained regarding IFN-␤ mRNA production (Fig. 1A ). This indicates that virulent ASFV shuts down the IFN-␤ synthesis pathway several hours after infection (Fig. 1A) , although IFN-␤ mRNA production is significantly above the control level at 4 hpi. This effect also translates to IFN-␤ cytokine production, which initially increases and is totally abolished at 16 hpi, when macrophages are infected with virulent ASFV (Fig. 1B) . In addition, we analyzed the expression of IFIT-1 and CXCL10, two IFN-␤-dependent genes (25, 26) at 0, 4, 8, and 16 hpi. Fig. 1C and D, show that Armenia/07 does not activate either IFIT-1 or CXCL10 mRNA synthesis during the course of the infection, whereas, in contrast, IFIT-1 and CXCL10 mRNA level increases during NH/P68 infection. Finally, and as shown in Fig. 1E and F, the p32 mRNA and protein levels were equivalent during the infection with both attenuated and virulent strains, thus demonstrating that same amount of viruses have been used. Taking together, these results reveal two important aspects regarding IFN-␤ production by attenuated versus virulent ASFV strains. First, the attenuated NH/P68 virus induces the production of IFN-␤ in infected macrophages, which in turn stimulates the expression of IFN-␤-dependent genes such as IFIT-1 and CXCL10. Second, the virulent Armenia/07 strain is able to efficiently block IFN-␤ mRNA synthesis and production in infected macrophages. The STING pathway is blocked by virulent Armenia/07, while it is activated by attenuated NH/P68. Given the results described above, we set out to dissect the molecular mechanism of IFN-␤ inhibition/induction by different ASFV strains in infected porcine alveolar macrophages. It has been shown that induction of IFN-␤ synthesis depends mainly on the cGAS-STING pathway, which is triggered by the sensing of dsDNA in the cytoplasm (3). We therefore studied the correlation between IFN-␤ production and cGAS-STING pathway activation in macrophages after infection with attenuated or virulent ASFV. 16 hpi, and lysates were separated by 7 to 20% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-ASFV p32 (viral early p32) and anti-actin antibodies. The data are means Ϯ the standard errors of the mean (SEM; n ϭ 3). Data were statistically analyzed by using a Student t test (*, P Ͻ 0.05; **, P Ͻ 0.01; ***, P Ͻ 0.001). As seen in Fig. 2A , infection with NH/P68, but not with Armenia/07, induces phosphorylation of STING and IRF3 at 16 hpi, indicating that the STING pathway is activated in response to the infection with the attenuated, but not with the virulent, ASFV strain. STING phosphorylation occurs as early as 1 hpi, reaches a peak at 2 to 4 hpi and decreases by 16 hpi during NH/P68 infection (Fig. 2B) . Meanwhile, IRF3 phosphorylation, which controls IFN-␤ transcription (2) , starts at 4 hpi and increases until 16 hpi (Fig. 2B) . These data indicate that STING activation occurs early after NH/P68 infection and before IRF3 phosphorylation and is maintained throughout 16 h of infection; this supports the IFN-␤ production data presented in Fig. 1 . In contrast, infection of macrophages with Armenia/07 produces only a weak phosphorylation signal of STING after 2 and 4 hpi, which decreases at later time points and is almost negative at 16 hpi (Fig. 2C) . A similar activation profile was seen for IRF3 (Fig. 2C ). This demonstrates that-after initial moderate activation-virulent Armenia/07 is able to inhibit STING and IRF3 phosphorylation at later time points after infection; similar results were observed in regard to IFN-␤ synthesis (Fig. 1B) . The specific inhibitor of cGAS, Ru521, inhibits the activation of STING mediated by NH/P68 and Armenia/07 infection. cGAS is a cellular sensor for cytoplasmic dsDNA detection, which further induces STING pathway activation (27) (28) (29) . To test the role of cGAS in sensing of ASFV dsDNA, porcine alveolar macrophages were mock treated or treated with increasing concentrations of the specific cGAS inhibitor Ru521 (30) for 30 min. Cells were then mock infected or infected with NH/P68 and Armenia/07 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2 for 5 h or 2 h, a time by which pSTING was shown to be maximum for attenuated and virulent strains, respectively ( Fig. 2B and C) . The cells were then collected, and the STING phosphorylation level was analyzed by Western blotting. As Fig. 3 shows, STING phosphorylation was not detected in mock-infected cells, independent of Ru521 treatment. As expected by this time of infection, during both NH/P68 and Armenia/07 infections STING was phosphorylated in the nontreated cells; however, interestingly, the level of STING phosphorylation decreased when Ru521 at concentrations of 20 and 50 g/ml was added at the beginning of the infection. These results indicate the involvement of cGAS in the activation of the STING pathway triggered, at early times after infection, either by NH/P68 or Armenia/07 ASFV strains. Infection of NH/P68 phosphorylates IRF3 and induces its binding to chromatin. As mentioned above, we have observed that infection with NH/P68 is able to substantially activate the cGAS-STING pathway. It has been described previously that the activation of STING and TBK1 induces the phosphorylation and then translocation of phosphorylated IRF3 (p-IRF3) to the nucleus (31, 32) , where it acts as a transcription factor for IFN-␤. In order to analyze the phosphorylation status and cellular localization of IRF3 during attenuated versus virulent ASFV infections, we used a specific antibody to detect p-IRF3 in different subcellular locations of the cell. To achieve this, mockinfected, NH/P68-infected, or Armenia/07-infected macrophages were fractionated after 8 hpi, a time point when both STING and IRF3 were found to be phosphorylated by NH/P68 but not by Armenia/07 ( Fig. 2B and C). Cytoplasmic (S2) and nuclear (P1) fractions were obtained from the respective whole-cell extracts (WCE). Next, the P1 fraction was further separated into nuclear soluble fraction (S3) and chromatin fraction (P3) (Fig. 4A ). We used specific markers for each cell fraction to confirm the accuracy of The activation of STING by NH/P68 and Armenia/07 is dependent on the cGAS sensor. Porcine alveolar macrophages were untreated or treated with 1, 10, 20, or 50 g/ml of Ru521 and mock infected or infected with NH/P68 or Armenia/07 (2 PFU/cell). At 2 or 5 h after Armenia/07 or NH/P68 infection, respectively, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and lysates were separated by 7 to 20% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-p-STING, anti-STING, or anti-actin antibodies as a control. Numbers below the bands indicate the relative level of phosphorylated STING. Densitometry was performed using ImageJ. the fractionating procedure: actin for the soluble fraction, histone 3 (H3) for the soluble nuclear fraction, and ␤1-laminin for the chromatin fraction. As shown in Fig. 4B and p-IRF3 is found in WCE from NH/P68 infected cells, whereas it was not found in mock-infected cells or only in small amounts in Armenia/07-infected cells. After cell fractionation, p-IRF3 is mainly detected in the cytoplasmic fraction of alveolar macrophages infected with NH/P68, as well as in the soluble nuclear fraction (S3) (Fig. 4C ). p-IRF3 was also detected in the chromatin fraction (P3) of NH/P68-infected cells, suggesting that at 8 h after NH/P68 infection, functional p-IRF3 binds to chromatin, possibly acting as transcription factor for IFN-␤. Only weak or no bands corresponding to p-IRF3 were detected either in the chromatin fraction (P3) or in the nuclear soluble fraction (S3) in uninfected cells or in cells infected with Armenia/07. These data suggest that the cGAS-STING pathway is strongly activated during NH/P68 infection, resulting in the activation and translocation of p-IRF3 to the nuclear chromatin fraction, where it activates synthesis of IFN-␤. In contrast, ASFV Armenia/07 displays mechanisms which almost completely inhibit p-IRF3 activation and translocation to the nucleus; this resulted in weak or no induction of IFN-␤ synthesis. Armenia/07-induced blockage of the cGAS-STING pathway happens early during viral infection. ASFV displays a very accurate temporal kinetics of replication in the infected cell, producing early-early, early-late, and late viral mRNAs. These differently timed messenger RNAs are the products of viral genes whose transcription is regulated before or after viral DNA replication (8) . In order to determine at what step of the Armenia/07 replication the cGAS-STING route is blocked, we used cytosine arabinoside (AraC), an inhibitor of viral DNA replication, widely used to prevent the expression of late ASFV genes (8) . In order to determine whether the cGAS-STING inhibition produced by Armenia/07 occurs at early or late times of ASFV replication, we infected alveolar macrophages in the presence or absence of AraC and analyzed the phosphorylation of both STING and IRF3. The results showed that the cGAS-STING pathway inhibition by Armenia/07 occurs at a time point prior to the replication of viral DNA. No phosphorylation of STING and IRF3 was observed in the presence of AraC (Fig. 5 ), indicating that early viral genes and/or gene products are involved in this inhibition exerted by the virulent ASFV strain. As a control for both the infection and the effects of AraC on viral DNA replication, we employed a specific antibody to assess the expression of the viral protein p12, a late viral product, which should be only expressed in the absence of AraC. As shown in the Fig. 5 , p12 is only found in the lanes corresponding to infected cells in the absence of AraC.
