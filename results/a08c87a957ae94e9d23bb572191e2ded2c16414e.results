We found 175 records using the search strategy, and 11 additional records by checking references of the included articles. After title and abstract screening, 44 articles were excluded because they were duplicates, and 108 papers were selected for screening by title and abstract. After the examination of exclusion criteria, a total of 47 articles were finally included (Fig. 1 ). All the included articles were published in English, and all of them achieved viral RNA amplification. The assessment of the quality of the information in each article is shown in Fig. 2. A total of 95.7% of the included studies extracted total RNA before targeted amplification of the viral RNA, while the 4.3% directly isolated viral RNA from the FTA card. The studies used a wide variety of sources and samples, which included samples from mammals, birds, insects, plants, cells, and humans ( Table 1 ). The targeted viral genomes belonged to all classes of RNA virus of the Baltimore Classification except Class VI, with 8.5% of the studies reporting amplification of RNA fragments of Class III virus (dsRNA), 68.1% of Class IV virus ((+) ssRNA), 21.3% of Class V virus ((−) ssRNA), and 2.1% of the three classes mentioned above. An animal specimen source accounted for 38.3% of the reports (Moscoso et al., 2005; Maw et al., 2006; Moscoso et al., 2006; Perozo et al., 2006; Purvis et al., 2006; Inoue et al., 2007; Narayanan et al., 2010; Abdelwhab et al., 2011; Kraus et al., 2011; Keeler et al., 2012; Linhares et al., 2012; Madhanmohan et al., 2013; Awad et al., 2014; Biswal et al., 2016; Foss et al., 2016; Jozwiak et al., 2016; Madhanmohan et al., 2016; Manswr et al., 2018) . Among them, twelve reports isolated RNA from viruses that can cause disease in poultry or wild birds, like Newcastle virus disease, avian influenza, or infectious bursal disease (Table 1) . Six reports isolated RNA of viruses that can cause disease in suids or bovids, like respiratory syndrome virus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus (Table 1) . Plant samples were assessed in 31.9% of the included articles, and samples obtained from insects corresponded to 14.9%. These works aimed to amplify viral RNA of arboviruses that can cause disease in humans, and also viruses capable of causing disease in fishes and plants (Hall-Mendelin et al., 2010; Price et al., 2014; Flies et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015; Navaneeth Krishnan et al., 2016; Hall-Mendelin et al., 2017; Melanson et al., 2017; Chikh-Ali et al., 2016) . Viral specimens were derived from cell culture or from a commercial inactivated vaccine in 10.6% of the reports (Muthukrishnan et al., 2008; Li et al., 2012; Bankamp et al., 2013; Sakai et al., 2015; Montmayeur et al., 2017) . Finally, two reports isolated virus using human samples: stool and blood. (Dauner et al., 2015; Tam et al., 2015) . Infectious virus was isolated from one of only fourteen included studies that tested for infectivity of the virus from an FTA card® (Maw et al., 2006) . In this study, ADVANTEC chromatography paper No. 526, (Toyo Roshi, Tokyo, Japan), ADVANTEC filter paper No. 2 (Toyo Roshi), and stationery copy paper were compared with FTA cards® for the isolation and inactivation of the dsRNA from the infectious bursal disease virus, a virus member of the Birnaviridae family, genus Avibirnavirus, with a segmented genome. In this study, every paper-based matrix allowed the isolation of viral RNA and infectious virus. However, virus inactivation was achieved after phenol fixation on the FTA card®. Thirteen other studies demonstrated a lack of infectious virus from the FTA card (Moscoso et al., 2005; Moscoso et al., 2006; Perozo et al., 2006; Muthukrishnan et al., 2008; Narayanan et al., 2010; Abdelwhab et al., 2011; Keeler et al., 2012; Linhares et al., 2012; Bankamp et al., 2013; Awad et al., 2014; Tam et al., 2015; Jozwiak et al., 2016; Madhanmohan et al., 2016) (Narayanan et al., 2010) . Regarding storage of the FTA cards® before further viral RNA purification, the cards were stored for periods that varied from one to eight months (median time: 30 days, IQR 21-90), at temperatures that ranged between −20°C to 37°C (median temperature: 25°C, IQR 4°C-25°C). Three protocols for RNA amplification from the FTA card® were reported: 1. Elution of RNA from the FTA card®, 2. Direct viral RNA purification, and 3. Disk cleaning and soaking. Elution of RNA from FTA cards® before RNA amplification was the most common method for RNA extraction. It was performed in 55.1% of the assessed studies. The elution conditions and eluents used in those studies are summarized in Table 2 . Briefly, viral RNA was obtained by soaking fragments of the FTA card® in an eluent solution, followed by incubation with or without agitation with temperatures that ranged between 4-95°C. After elution, the RNA underwent a purification step using commercial kits (Moscoso et al., 2005; Ndunguru et al., 2005; Maw et al., 2006; Moscoso et al., 2006; Purvis et al., 2006; Abdelwhab et al., 2011; Keeler et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Bankamp et al., 2013; Sakai et al., 2015; Tam et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015; Biswal et al., 2016; Foss et al., 2016; Madhanmohan et al., 2016; Karavina and Gubba, 2017; Manswr et al., 2018) or standard protocols like sodium acetate and isopropanol precipitation (Grund et al., 2010; Price et al., 2014) . In one case, magnetic beads were used for purification and concentration of RNA (Linhares et al., 2012) Direct virus RNA purification was performed in 30.6% of the studies. It consisted of a protocol in which FTA card® punches were used for RNA purification without a previous step of elution from the FTA card®. The punches were directly soaked in the lysis and extraction solutions of different commercial kits, TRIzol reagent® or Guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method ( Table 1) . Most of the studies used methods for total RNA extraction and only one study used a commercial kit for viral RNA isolation (Montmayeur et al., 2017) . In this particular case, the genome of polioviruses, (Enterovirus C, genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae), a virus with a (+) ssRNA non-segmented genome of 6.7-10.1 kb with a poly(A) tail, was isolated from FTA cards®. This method allowed the use of NGS techniques for complete genome sequencing with a total of 206,156 reads (90% of reads mapping to poliovirus, giving 99% genome coverage) (Montmayeur et al., 2017) . On the other hand, 8.2% of the included studies used disk cleaning and soaking for RNA purification, which consisted of punching a disk from the card and placing in a solution to remove contaminants before proceeding one or two-step RT-PCR by placing the cleaned disk into a second solution (the reaction mix). Note that this method did not include an RNA purification step (Roy and Nassuth, 2005; Inoue et al., 2007; Narayanan et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2011) . The third strategy was to perform one or two-step RT-PCR after RNA isolation or preparation from the FTA cards®. In 57.1% of these studies, the targeted viral genes were amplified by one-step RT-PCR. Most of them (96.4%) used specific primers for the RT step and the PCR step. Only one study used random primers for RT and then specific primers for PCR (Yang et al., 2015) . The reaction mix composition, as well as the cycling conditions in each work, varied depending on the PCR kit used and the desired amplicon. Eleven studies quantified the product of the RT-PCR, 26 used the product of these reactions for sequencing, and Quality assessment chart. Each included study was assessed in order to determine the information provided for each variable. Each variable was scored with 2 = green, if the information provided was complete or sufficient to replicate the methods, 1 = yellow, if the information was incomplete or unclear, or 0 = red, if no information was provided. For data visualization a heatmap was generated using the scores (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article).
