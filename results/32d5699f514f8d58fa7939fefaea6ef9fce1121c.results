The N-terminal domain of Gsdma3 harbors the cell death-inducing ability Sequence alignment of human and mouse GSDMA/ Gsdma family members suggests that Gsdma3 consists of highly conserved N-terminal and C-terminal domains that are connected by a variable linker region. Notably, known autosomal dominant mutations, including Bsk, Dfl, Re-den, Fgn, Rco2, Rim3, AE, M1Btlr, and I359N, are located in the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1a) . To investigate the structure-function relationship of Gsdma3, we generated various expression constructs to express wildtype, truncated-type, and mutant-type variants with different tagging sequences (Fig. 1b) . Since Rim3-type (A348T) mutation changes the highly conserved residue in the seventh leucine-rich region (LRR) of Gsdma3 protein and six out of nine dominant mutations are located in this LRR, we used mainly this mutant protein (Gsdma3 Rim3 ) as a paradigm for functional study of the missense mutation. Previous overexpression study of GSDMA and Gsdma3 implicated a role in apoptosis [6, 16] ; we therefore expressed wild-type and mutant Gsdma3 in epithelial cells and examined the cell death phenotypes. HaCaT cells transfected with expression vectors for wild-type and mutant Gsdma3 were first live-cell stained with Annexin V-Cy3 plus 7-AAD, and then immunostained for the tagged protein (Fig. 2a) . We found that the cells expressing wild-type Gsdma3 (Gsdma3 wt ), Nterminal portion of Gsdma3 (N-Gsdma3) or Gsdma3 Rim3 displayed slightly higher levels of early apoptosis staining (Annexin V + ) than that of the cells expressing the Cterminal portion of Gsdma3 (C-Gsdma3) and Cterminal portion of Gsdma3 Rim3 (C-Gsdma3 Rim3 ), but it is not statistically significant (P = 0.47). The expression of C-Gsdma3 and C-Gsdma3 Rim3 induced very little late apoptosis (Annexin V + 7AAD + ), and Gsdma3-expressing cells (16.4 ± 6.1 %), N-Gsdma3-expressing cells (29.6 ± 7.2 %), and Gsdma3 Rim3 -expressing cells (60.5 ± 9.9 %) displayed higher level of late apoptosis staining than C-Gsdma3-expressing cells (P < 0.005) (Fig. 2b) . The TUNEL assays were also performed in transfected HaCaT cells to detect the late apoptosis (Fig. 2c) . Quantification of the TUNEL staining results revealed that Gsdma3-, N-Gsdma3-and Gsdma3 Rim3 -expressing cells displayed a higher level of TUNEL + staining than that of C-Gsdma3-expressing (P < 0.5) (Fig. 2d) . Interestingly, we found that Gsdma3 Rim3 -expressing cells had a higher late apoptosis staining than Gsdma3-expressing cells (Fig. 2b, d) . To quantify the cell death status in a more objective manner, we used flow cytometry to analyze the plasma membrane integrity (7AAD permeability) and mitochondrial membrane potential (△ΨM) in HEK293T cells expressing Gsdma3 and its variants (Fig. 2e, f) . The pIRES-hrGFP-1a vector was used to express flag-tagged Gsdma3 and variants together with internal ribosome entry sitedriven GFP. Twenty thousand GFP+ cells for each transfection were collected for flow cytometry analysis, and we found that N-Gsdma3-expressing cells displayed a significant increase in the fractions of cell death (7AAD + staining) and △ΨM depolarization than Gsdma3-expressing cells or vector-transfected cells. In contrast, the fractions of cell death and cells with △ΨM depolarization in C-Gsdma3-expressing cells were comparable to vectortransfected cells. As the GFP signal in cells transfected with flag tagged-Gsdma3 Rim3 was below the detection limit of flow cytometry, we transfected HEK293T cells with mixtures of the flag tagged-Gsdma3 Rim3 and the V5 tagged-Gsdma3 wt plasmids (1:2 ratio). Interestingly, coexpression of Gsdma3 Rim3 and Gsdma3 wt resulted in greater fractions of cell death and △ΨM depolarization than did expression of Gsdma3 wt alone. Collectively, these results indicate that C-Gsdma3 and C-Gsdma3 Rim3 do not cause cell death, and that N-terminal domain of Gsdma3 harbors the cell death-inducing ability and the Rim3-type (A348T) mutation in the C-terminal domain may play a regulatory role.
