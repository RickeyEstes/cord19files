Disruption of OTU binding to Ub permits rescue of recombinant CCHFV containing a catalytically inactive OTU. Viral DUBs are thought to facilitate viral infection by manipulating host immune responses, but their exact mode of action remains elusive. We previously reported efficient recovery of DUB-deficient CCHFV when Q16 and A129, critical residues involved in Ub binding, were mutated (8) . In contrast, previous attempts to rescue virus containing a mutated OTU catalytically active site (C40A) failed. Unexpectedly, a later attempt to generate a recombinant virus with the OTU-C40A mutation was successful. Sequencing the complete viral genome confirmed the conservation of the C40A mutation and revealed the acquisition of a nonconservative change at position 16 of the OTU (Q16P), indicating that Q16P may serve as an adaptive mutation allowing rescue of CCHFV encoding an inactive OTU. Strikingly, Q16 is a critical residue required for Ub binding (8, 25) , suggesting that Ub binding to the inactive OTU prevents CCHFV rescue. To examine if disruption of Ub binding is critical for the rescue of the CCHFV-C40A mutant, we added the Q16R mutation to disrupt Ub binding to the OTU of the L-C40A mutant. Indeed, combining the C40A and Q16R mutations resulted in efficient recovery of recombinant CCHFV (Fig. 1a) . Sequence analysis of a subsequent passage confirmed the presence of the C40A/Q16R mutations without any additional changes in the viral genome. Next, we examined the effect of disrupting OTU catalytic activity on viral growth in A549 and BSR-T7/5 cells (Fig. 1b and c) . Growth kinetics were assessed using CCHFV-ZsG reporter viruses by measuring ZsGreen1 (ZsG) fluorescence as an indicator of viral infection (26) . Although a minor reduction in ZsG fluorescence was observed for CCHFV-C40A/Q16R, both the Q16R and C40A/Q16R OTU mutants grew efficiently in BSR-T7/5 cells, which are unable to mount an IFN response during infection (27) . In contrast, growth of CCHFV-C40A/Q16R was severely impaired in A549 cells, which do mount a robust immune response during CCHFV infection (8) . To confirm that the reduced growth kinetics of both mutant viruses in A549 cells was due to cellular immune responses, we assessed the growth kinetics of these viruses in A549 cells lacking RIG-I (RIG-I KO [knockout]) (Fig. 1d) and found that both CCHFV-Q16R and CCHFV-C40A/Q16R displayed enhanced growth kinetics in the absence of RIG-I signaling. This suggests that OTU activity is not an absolute requirement for CCHFV infection and specifically supports viral growth in IFN-competent cells. OTU activity is not required for CCHFV lethality in IFNAR ؊/؊ mice. Assessing the role of the OTU in CCHFV pathogenesis in vivo is limited by the fact that only type I IFN-deficient small-animal models (IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ and STAT1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice) are available. While the use of immunocompromised mice presents limitations in addressing the immune suppression function of the OTU, this model can nonetheless provide insights into the effects of altered OTU activity on CCHFV disease progression. To examine the effect of OTU mutations on disease, we infected IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ mice subcutaneously (1 ϫ 10 2 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID 50 ]) and monitored weight and health daily (Fig. 2 ). All mice started losing weight 3 days after infection. Infection performed with CCHFV-Q16R, in which only Ub binding was disrupted, resulted in illness identical to that caused by wild-type CCHFV (CCHFV-wt); mice succumbed to disease at 4 to 5 days postinfection (dpi), and no clinical differences between these two groups were observed ( Fig. 2a and b ). Mice infected with CCHFV-C40A/Q16R lost weight at a slightly lower rate and had a prolonged time to death (6 to 7 dpi); 2 of the 8 animals survived infection. Analysis of viral RNA in various tissues at the time of death or euthanasia demonstrated similar viral loads between all the groups, with the exception of the 2 survivors, in which CCHFV RNA levels were markedly lower (Fig. 2c) . Together, these data demonstrate that OTU catalytic activity is not required for pathogenesis in mice in the absence of type I IFN signaling, although mutating the catalytic site resulted in mild attenuation in vivo in comparison to active OTUs (wt and Q16R). UbV-CC4 blocks OTU activity. OTUs of positive-strand RNA viruses are involved in proteolytic processing of viral proteins required for polymerase maturation and are therefore indispensable for replication. In contrast, OTUs of negative-strand RNA viruses, like CCHFV, are not essential for RNA polymerase activity (18) . However, our data suggest that inactivating the catalytic site of CCHFV OTU also interferes with viral transcription and/or replication, due to its interaction with cellular Ub (Fig. 1) . As a result of its inability to cleave substrates, OTU-C40A may display prolonged binding to ubiquitinated substrates, potentially affecting L protein stability or function and ultimately preventing viral growth. We rationalized that blocking the OTU catalytic site of CCHFV-wt using an inhibitor could impede viral infection in a similar fashion. A synthetic Ub variant (UbV) that binds the CCHFV OTU with high levels of affinity and specificity in vitro was recently described (UbV-CC4) (28) . UbV-CC4 resembles cellular Ub, but the consensus LRLRGG motif required for cleavage and conjugation of Ub to proteins is mutated (Fig. 3a ). This prevents cleavage by the OTU and thus resembles the inhibitory binding of cellular Ub to L-C40A. Furthermore, UbV-CC4 contains an extended C-terminal tail that forms additional contacts with the OTU, resulting in enhanced affinity. Using UbV-CC4, we set out to investigate the potential antiviral effect of blocking CCHFV OTU activity. As a control, a wild-type-like Ub variant was used in which only the C-terminal di-Gly motif was mutated to alanine (UbV-AA). Mutation of this motif in both Ub variants prevents their conjugation to cellular or viral proteins and therefore results in a lower likelihood of interference with normal Ub conjugation. To confirm that UbV-CC4 interacts with both OTU-wt and OTU-C40A, we used time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET). HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing V5-OTU and hemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) or with plasmids expressing V5-OTU and FLAG-UbV-CC4 and were subsequently labeled with a donor or acceptor fluorophore. A plasmid expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a control. Close proximity of proteins, such as protein-protein interactions, results in increased intensity of the fluorescent signal. Coexpression of UbV-CC4 with either OTU-wt or OTU-C40A resulted in an increased TR-FRET signal, whereas coexpression of either OTU with GFP did not (Fig. 3b) . In contrast, only coexpression of HA-Ub with OTU-C40A resulted in an increased TR-FRET signal, whereas coexpression with OTU-wt did not. This supports the concept that cellular Ub (HA-Ub) binds only to OTU-C40A whereas the synthetic UbV-CC4 also interacts with OTU-wt. We reaffirmed the interaction of UbV-CC4 with OTU-wt using coimmunoprecipitation. Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-OTU-wt and FLAG-UbV-CC4 or the FLAG-UbV-AA control. Pulldown of HA-OTU-wt resulted in detection of FLAG-UbV-CC4 but not FLAG-UbV-AA (Fig. 3c) . We then examined the effects of UbV-CC4 on CCHFV OTU deubiquitinase and deISGylase activity. To visualize cellular ubiquitinated and ISGylated proteins, cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-Ub (DUB assay) or V5-ISG15 in combination with the enzymes required for conjugation (Ube1L, UbcH8, and HERC5; deISGylation assay). Analysis of the cellular levels of ISG15 or Ub demonstrates that UbV-CC4 efficiently blocked the OTU-mediated removal of Ub and ISG15 from their protein targets, whereas UbV-AA had no effect on OTU activity (Fig. 3d) . Additionally, blocking OTU DUB activity with UbV-CC4 enhanced ubiquitination of the L protein (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Since CCHFV OTU deubiquitinase activity is sufficient to block RIG-I-mediated type I IFN signaling (8, 9) , we investigated if UbV-CC4 could affect OTU-mediated immune suppression in a reporter assay (Fig. 3e) . RIG-I-mediated induction of beta IFN (IFN-␤) gene expression, measured in cells transfected with plasmids encoding the constitutively active RIG-I CARD domain, and luciferase under the control of the IFN-␤ promoter, was efficiently blocked by CCHFV OTU. As further support for the idea of UbV-CC4 blocking OTU activity, OTU immune-suppressive activity was prevented by coexpression of UbV-CC4. Taken together, these experiments demonstrated the ability of UbV-CC4 to block proteolytic activity of CCHFV OTU and restore cellular RIG-I signaling. UbV-CC4 selectively inhibits CCHFV OTUs. The wide geographic distribution of CCHFV is reflected in its considerable genetic diversity. To assess if UbV-CC4 is able to inhibit OTU activity from divergent CCHFV strains and other nairovirus species, we performed in vitro OTU activity assays. Increasing concentrations of UbV-CC4 were incubated with purified OTUs and a fluorogenic Ub substrate (ubiquitin 7-amido-4methylcoumarin [Ub-AMC]). UbV-CC4 inhibited the in vitro OTU activity of all tested CCHFV strains (IbAr10200, AP92, Hoti, and Oman) with similar levels of efficiency, with IC 50 values ranging from 12 to 23 nM ( Fig. 3f ; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material). In contrast, OTUs from other nairovirus species showed relatively poor or no inhibition by UbV-CC4, demonstrating that UbV-CC4 is specific for all CCHFV strains tested but not for more distantly related viruses ( Fig. 3g ; see also Table S1 ). UbV-CC4 inhibits CCHFV replication. To assess if UbV-CC4-mediated inhibition of OTU activity affects CCHFV replication, we generated A549 cell lines stably expressing UbV-CC4 or control UbV-AA. We analyzed the growth kinetics of a CCHFV-ZsG reporter virus in these cells and measured viral titers and ZsG fluorescence as indicators of viral replication and protein synthesis (Fig. 4a to c) (26) . Strikingly, UbV-CC4 robustly reduced ZsG levels at all tested time points, whereas the UbV-AA control did not affect ZsG fluorescence (Fig. 4c ). In addition, CCHFV-infected A549-CC4 cells produced very low to undetectable levels of viral progeny, whereas A549-AA cells produced titers similar to those measured for the control cells (unmodified A549 cells; Fig. 4a and b). Infectious titers of CCHFV lacking the ZsG reporter (CCHFV-wt) closely matched the curves determined on the basis of ZsG fluorescence, further supporting quantification of CCHFV-derived ZsG fluorescence to accurately estimate viral growth (Fig. 4a to c) . Finally, to ensure that the UbV-CC4-mediated inhibition of CCHFV growth was specific and was not caused by broad antiviral effects of UbV-CC4, we used a Lassa reporter virus (LASV) expressing ZsG (LASV-ZsG) as a control (Fig. 4d) . LASV-ZsG growth kinetics are unaffected by UbV-CC4, confirming that UbV-CC4 specifically and potently inhibits CCHFV. UbV-CC4 inhibits CCHFV replication independently of innate immune responses. Since CCHFV does not require OTU activity for autoproteolytic processing of its viral proteins or for polymerase activity (18), we expected that UbV-CC4 would reduce CCHFV infection by interfering with OTU-mediated immune suppression, which would result in enhanced cellular immune responses. A549 cells display robust IFN responses upon CCHFV infection, and previous studies have demonstrated that RIG-I signaling plays a pivotal role in the antiviral cellular response against CCHFV infection (8, 29) . To investigate if UbV-CC4-mediated inhibition of CCHFV infection depends on enhanced cellular immune responses, we assessed UbV-CC4 antiviral activity in an A549 RIG-I knockout cell line (RIG-I KO). Using the A549 RIG-I KO cells as a basis, we generated additional cell lines stably expressing UbV-AA or UbV-CC4. Interestingly, robust inhibition of CCHFV was noted even in the absence of RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses (Fig. 4e) . This confirms that UbV-CC4 can inhibit CCHFV infection independently of RIG-I. OTU residues required for Ub binding are critical for UbV-CC4 antiviral activity. Our data support a model in which binding of cellular Ub to the inactive OTU (C40A) blocks the recovery of infectious CCHFV and binding of UbV-CC4 to OTU-wt mimics this inhibition (Fig. 1, 3, and 4a to c) . Specific OTU mutations have been described that selectively disrupt OTU interaction with Ub (Q16R) or with ISG15 (P77D) or both (A129R) (8, 25, 30, 31) . Since UbV-CC4 interacts with the OTU in a manner similar to that seen with cellular Ub, we expected that the Q16R and A129R mutations would prevent UbV-CC4 binding to the OTU and therefore would relieve UbV-CC4 inhibition of CCHFV infection. Recombinant viruses containing these OTU mutations were generated and used to infect cells expressing UbV-CC4. As predicted, mutant viruses CCHFV-Q16R and CCHFV-A129R, which are deficient in Ub binding, were not inhibited by UbV-CC4, whereas CCHFV-P77D, which retains significant Ub binding, was inhibited similarly to the wt virus ( Fig. 4c and f to h) . We confirmed the specific binding of UbV-CC4 to the mutant OTUs by performing coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 4i) . Thus, binding of UbV-CC4 to the OTU domain is required for inhibition of CCHFV infection. UbV-CC4 disrupts viral RNA transcription and/or replication. To pinpoint the step(s) in the CCHFV replication cycle that is affected by UbV-CC4, we used a minigenome assay and a virus-like particle (VLP) assay. These systems have the advantage of separating various steps of the viral replication cycle potentially affected by UbV-CC4 and can provide insight into its mechanism of action. The VLP assay allows us to address early steps in the replication cycle, such as entry, uncoating, and primary transcription of the encapsidated minigenome. Interestingly, when VLPs were added to UbV-CC4-expressing cells, only a mild reduction in VLP reporter activity compared to the UbV-AA control was detected (Fig. 5a) . In order to confirm the VLP results with genuine virus, we used a CCHFV reporter expressing NanoLuciferase (CCHFV-Nluc; Fig. 5b ). Overall, UbV-CC4 did not inhibit luciferase expression early in infection, suggesting that UbV-CC4 likely affects viral genome amplification without interfering with entry or primary transcription. Next, we used a minigenome assay to examine whether UbV-CC4 affects L-RdRp activity (Fig. 5c) . UbV-CC4 severely hampered CCHFV minigenome reporter activity, suggesting that UbV-CC4 affects transcription or replication of viral RNA. To confirm that UbV-CC4 interferes with the production of nascent viral RNA, and not simply with the translation thereof, we assessed minigenome RNA levels in the presence of UbV-CC4 (Fig. 5d) . Indeed, less viral RNA was produced in the presence of UbV-CC4, whereas UbV-AA did not affect minigenome RNA levels. These experiments demonstrated that UbV-CC4 affects viral transcription and/or replication. The exact mechanism required for the generation of nascent CCHFV RNA has not been elucidated. However, CCHFV likely replicates its genomic material in a way similar to that of related bunyaviruses. This process entails NP binding to genomic RNA to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, which in turn interact with the L protein, resulting in transcription or replication. Regions required for the L-NP interaction have been identified on both the N and C termini of the CCHFV L protein (32) . We investigated the possibility that UbV-CC4 interferes with CCHFV transcription and/or replication by disrupting the formation of RNP complexes by assessing the interaction between L and NP in the presence of UbV-CC4. Cells were transfected with plasmids expressing CCHFV V5-L, NP, and FLAG-UbV-AA or FLAG-UbV-CC4. Lysates were immunoprecipitated using V5 and were analyzed by Western blotting. This assay demonstrated that less NP is associated with V5-L in the presence of UbV-CC4 (Fig. 5e ), supporting a model where UbV-CC4 interferes with the formation of CCHFV replication complexes.
