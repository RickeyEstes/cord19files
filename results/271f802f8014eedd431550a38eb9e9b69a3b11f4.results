Negative control preparations included (i) uninfected HRT-18 cells that had been incubated with anti-BCV antibody and (ii) infected cells that had been incubated with the IgG fraction of normal rabbit serum. These cells were not labeled by the gold probe, confirming that the antibody bound only to virus-specific antigen. The plasma membrane was not labeled on uninfected HRT-18 cells adsorbed at 4Â°C with BCV and incubated with these immunoreagents. This observation implies that binding of whole virus or subviral components to cellular receptors did not contribute to our observation of gold association with the plasma membrane. Accumulation of BCV antigen in BFS cells. Polykaryocytosis was evident by 18 hr in infected BFS cells incubated in medium with trypsin but cell fusion was not observed in the absence of trypsin. We used immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy to correlate the onset of cell fusion with the synthesis of viral antigen. Faint fluorescence was first recognized in BFS cultures at 9 hr postinfection (Fig. 2a) . Fluorescent cells constituted 25 to 30% of the cell population at 15 and 24 hr postinfection in cultures incubated without trypsin. Cultures that were incubated with trypsin contained large polykaryons with cytoplasmic fluorescence at 24 hr (Fig. 2b) while cultures without trypsin contained only mono-and binucleated cells (Fig. 2~) . Fewer than 10% of the remaining single cells in trypsintreated cultures were nonfluorescent at 24 hr. This decrease in the number of Electron microscopic preparations revealed no evidence of membrane fusion in BFS monolayers fixed after 15 h of infection in the presence of trypsin (Fig. 3a) . At the same time, multiple sites of BCV antigen in the plasma membrane were labeled (Fig. 3b) , indicating that antigen appearance at the plasma membrane preceded the onset of cell fusion by several hours. Viral antigen did not increase in the plasma membrane after the onset of cell fusion in infected BFS cell cultures. Vesicles filled with virus particles and continuous with the plasma membrane were observed as early as 15 hr after infection in BFS cells (Fig. 3~ ). This event appeared to represent exocytosis of newly formed coronavirus particles. The abundance of gold binding sites on polykaryons at 24 hr (Fig. 4a) was approximately equal to the number seen on BFS cells not treated with trypsin (Fig. 4b) . Evidently, the addition of trypsin did not alter the amount of viral antigen at the cell surface but influenced its function.
