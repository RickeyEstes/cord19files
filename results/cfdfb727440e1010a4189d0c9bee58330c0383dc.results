The 39-terminal 55 nts within the individual subgroups of betacoronaviruses were highly conserved Before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), betacoronaviruses were considered to include one lineage. After the discovery of SARS-CoV, other novel subgroups of the betacoronaviruses have been proposed and the original group 2 coronaviruses, which included BCoV and MHV, became designated as 2a coronaviruses [27, 28] . Many cis-acting elements in the 39 UTR of BCoV and MHV-A59 have been characterized [12, 13, 15, 22, 29] . To examine whether the 39-most 55 nts have conserved features within the individual subgroups of betacoronaviruses, the 39-terminal 55-nt sequence was aligned according to the published sequences (see GenBank Accession Nos. in Fig. 1 ) and the sequence identity within the subgroup 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d coronaviruses was 71%, 100%, 88% and 82%, respectively ( Fig. 1) . It is apparent that the aligned 39-terminal 55-nt sequence was highly conserved (identified by shading) across the coronaviruses within the individual subgroups of betacoronaviruses, suggesting that this region may harbor cis-acting elements critical for coronavirus replication. The 39-terminal 55 nts on BCoV DI RNA are required for (2)-strand RNA synthesis as analyzed by head-to-tail RNA ligation and qRT-PCR The coronavirus DI RNA has been employed as a surrogate for coronavirus genome to study the cis-acting elements required for coronavirus replication [3, 5, 6, 11, 15, 20, 22, 29, 30] . The identification of cis-acting RNA elements that are essential for the (2)strand DI RNA synthesis in coronaviruses, however, has been restricted by the low numbers of (2)-strand DI RNA produced from the DI RNA-transfected helper virus-infected cells [23, 24] . Although RT-PCR may be used to detect the (2)-strand DI RNA molecules, a false positive result may occur due to the synthesis of the copy-back (2)-strand DI RNA transcripts generated by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro using plasmid DNA as a template [25] . Thus, to overcome the detection problems caused by the low numbers of (2)-strand DI RNA and to avoid the detection of the (2)-strand DI RNA resulting from the copy-back transcripts, we, based on the previous study [26] , (1) created a hybrid BCoV DI RNA construct marked with the MHV 39 UTR and 25 nts of poly(A) tail ( Fig. 2A) to distinguish it from BCoV helper virus genome during RT-PCR and (2) conducted head-to-tail ligation of RNA and RT-PCR to differentiate the coronaviral polymerasegenerated (2)-strand DI RNA from T7 RNA polymerasegenerated artifact (2)-strand DI RNA (Fig. 2B) , as the primers used in the RT-PCR cannot yield a product from the copy-back (2)-strand transcripts after ligation [26] . Note that the sequence in the 39-termianl 55 nts of the 39UTR between BCoV and MHV is highly conserved (Fig. 1) and it has been shown that the replication efficiency of BCoV DI RNA with the MHV 39 UTR is almost the same with that of BCoV DI RNA with BCoV 39UTR [26] . Accordingly, to test whether the method can be applied to examine the requirement of the 39-most 55 nts for (2)-strand DI RNA synthesis in the context of BCoV DI RNA, BM25A construct in which the 39-most 55 nts were intact and D55 mutant in which the 39-most 55 nts were deleted were created (Fig. 3A ). After transfection of BM25A and D55 transcripts into BCoVinfected HRT-18 cells, RNA was extracted at different time points as indicated in Fig. 3B , head-to-tail ligated, and subjected to RT-PCR. An RT-PCR product with a length of ,150 base pair (bp) was obtained from BM25A-transfected BCoV-infected cells (Fig. 3C) , confirmed that the ,150-bp RT-PCR product obtained from BM25A-transfected BCoV-infected cells was specific from head-to-tail-ligated coronavirus polymerase-generated (-)-strand DI RNA. Because DI RNA may undergo recombination with helper virus genome under select pressure [31, 32, 33, 34] , the detected (-)-strand DI RNA in Fig. 3B may be derived from the recombinant genome rather than input (+)-strand DI RNA. To seek evidence of a DI RNA reporter-containing recombinant genome, the RNA samples extracted from the BM25A-and D55transfected BCoV-infected cells at 8 hour posttransfection (hpt) were tested for a 1,639-nt helper virus genome-integrated reporter-containing sequence between the membrane (M) protein gene and the DI RNA 39 UTR using RT-PCR [26] . No RT-PCR product (Fig. 3D, lanes 2-3) was observed, suggesting that the detected ,150 bp RT-PCR products do not result from a recombinant helper virus genome. To compare the efficiency of (-)-strand DI RNA synthesis between BM25A and D55, head-totail ligated RNA extracted at 8 hpt was subjected to qRT-PCR with the same primer set used for the RT-PCR analysis. The results (Fig. 3E , left panel) suggest that the efficiency of (-)-strand DI RNA synthesis from D55 was significantly impaired in comparison with that from BM25A. Thus, we conclude that (1) using the head-to-tail RNA ligation and qRT-PCR allows us to detect and quantitate (-)-strand BCoV DI RNA and (2) the 39most 55 nts in BCoV DI RNA are required for (-)-strand DI RNA synthesis. Identification of cis-acting RNA elements within the 39terminal 55 nts for (2)-and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis We have demonstrated in the present study that the 39-most 55 nts are required for the synthesis of (-)-strand BCoV DI RNA 39-Terminal Sequence for Negative-and Positive-Strand RNA Synthesis using the head-to-tail RNA ligation and qRT-PCR (Fig. 3) . The map positions of the cis-acting RNA elements required for (-)-and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis within this 55-nt region, however, remain to be determined. To define the specific cis-acting RNA elements within the 39-terminal 55 nts which function in the synthesis of BCoV DI RNA (-) or (+) strands, a series of DI RNA constructs with deletions either from the 39 or 59 end of the 55-nt region were generated by mutagenesis (Fig. 4A) and tested by the methods depicted in Fig. S1 and described as follows. The T7 RNA polymerase-generated transcript of each construct was transfected into BCoV-infected HRT-18 cells and virus within the transfected cells was referred to as virus passage 0 (VP0). The total cellular RNA was collected at 8 hpt of RNA transcript to detect the synthesis of (-)-strand DI RNA by qRT-PCR. Since the transfected transcript was still in the BCoV-infected cells at 8 hpt as shown in Fig. 3E (right panel), it is difficult to differentiate between the coronaviral polymerase-generated (+)-strand DI RNA and T7 RNA polymerase-generated (+)-strand DI RNA by Northern blot assay at this time point. Therefore, to determine whether the detected (+)-strand DI RNA is specifically synthesized by the BCoV polymerase, the supernatant virus collected at 48 hpt, which is now called virus passage 1 or VP1, was used to infect fresh HRT-18 cells (Fig. S1 ). The total cellular RNA collected at 48 hpi of VP1 was used to detect the synthesis of (+)strand DI RNA by the Northern blot assay. If the T7 RNA polymerase-generated DI RNA, which is transfected at VP0, is not able to replicate, the transfected (+)-strand DI RNA cannot be detected at 48 hpi of VP1 [5, 6, 15, 35, 36] . The signals detected by Northern blot assay were quantitated and presented in percentages as a result of (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis [relative to the wt BM25A (100%)]. These results are summarized in Figs 4B and 4C. As shown in Fig. 4B , DI RNA constructs with a 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-nt deletion (constructs D1, D2, D3 and D4, respectively) at the 39 terminus of the 55-nt region still maintained the synthesis of (-)strand DI RNA (Fig. 4B ) although the synthesis efficiency was impaired (,55% to ,80% of the wt BM25A). Among these constructs, BCoV DI RNA with a 1-and 2-nt deletion at the 39 terminus still supported the (+)-strand synthesis (54.9% and 84.7% of the wt BM25A, respectively) ( To further dissect the specific cis-acting RNA motif required for (-)-and (+)-strand RNA synthesis within this 55-nt region, DI RNA constructs with various deletions from the 59 terminus of this region were created and tested (Fig. 4A ). The efficiency of (-)- and no (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis was detected from this deletion mutant (Fig. 4C, lane 14) , suggesting the nts from -30 to -15 are critical for both (-)-and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis. Of these deletion mutants, all of the mutated sequences in the synthesized (-)-strand DI RNA were still maintained at 8 hpt; however, the available mutant sequences in the (-)-and (+)-strand DI RNA at 48 hpi of VP1 showed that all contained the sequence with majority from wt DI RNA except for the mutant D2 in which the sequence of mutant D2 was mixed with that of wt BM25A (Fig. 4C ). Based on these results, the tentative conclusions at this time were as follows: (1) the nts from -1 to -4 and from -40 to -55 are not important for the (-)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis and (2) the nts from -1 to -2 and from -35 to -55 are not absolutely required for the (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis. Therefore, the critical cis-acting elements essential for (-)-or (+)-strand synthesis may reside in the region between the nts -2 and -40. To further determine the requirement of cis-acting elements for the (- Sequencing analysis showed that all of the mutated sequences in these synthesized (2)-strand DI RNA were still maintained at 8 hpt; however, all the mutants reversed back to wt DI RNA at 48 hpi of VP1. The sequencing results acquired from DI RNA constructs D1, D55-45, D55-40, D55-35, and D35-39 at 48 hpi of VP1 (Figs. 4C and 5C) indicate that the (+)-strand DI RNA detected by Northern blot assay may mostly originated from wt DI RNA (BM25A) that likely arose by reversion and consequently the importance of the mutated sequences remains to be determined. To confirm that these DI RNA mutants are able to replicate, the supernatant collected at 48 hpt was used to infect fresh HRT-18 cells. The total cellular RNA was harvested at 24 hpi of VP1 and then subjected to Northern blot assay and sequencing analyses. As shown in Fig. S2 , the relative replication efficiency of these mutants at 24 hpi of VP1 was similar to that at 48 hpi of VP1. Sequencing analysis revealed that the mutated sequences were still maintained in the mutants D2, D55-40 and D35-39. Although the sequencing results presented a mixed population in the mutants D1, D55-45 and D55-35, the majority of the sequences were from the mutants rather than from the wt DI RNA (BM25A). These results suggest that these DI RNA mutants still maintain the ability to replicate although the replication efficiency among these mutants varied. Taken together, based on the deletion mutagenesis experiments and sequence analysis, we conclude that the nts from 25 to 239 within the 39-terminal 55 nts are the cis-acting elements responsible for the (2)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis The effect of the 39-most nucleotide species on the (2)and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis Little is known regarding the mechanism of the initiation of (2)strand RNA synthesis in coronaviruses. Since the last nucleotide of The relative levels of (-)-strand DI RNA synthesis. Total cellular RNA was extracted from DI RNA-transfected BCoV-infected cells at 8 hpt. The synthesis of (-)-strand DI RNA from the deletion mutant was quantitated by qRT-PCR and was compared with that from wt BM25. Control A: total cellular RNA from mock-infected cells. Control B: total cellular RNA from BCoV-infected cells. Control C: total cellular RNA from DI RNA-transfected mock-infected 39-Terminal Sequence for Negative-and Positive-Strand RNA Synthesis PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org the 39 UTR in all coronavirus genomes sequenced to date is cytosine, it was speculated that this conserved nucleotide species may play an important role in coronavirus replication. To test this hypothesis, the cytosine residing at the last nucleotide of the 39 UTR in BCoV DI RNA was substituted with adenine, uracil and guanine to make the constructs BM-39A, BM-39U, and BM-39G, respectively (Fig. 6A) . As shown in Fig. 6B , even though construct BM-39A was still able to synthesize its (2)-strand counterpart (,60% of wt BM25A), its ability to synthesize (+)-strand was significantly abolished (7.5% of wt BM25A) (Fig. 6C, lane 2) . In contrast, the efficiency of the (2)-strand DI RNA synthesis from construct BM-39U was significantly inhibited (,30% of wt BM25A) (Fig. 6B) , but the efficiency of (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis from construct BM-39U was similar to that from wt BM25A (88.1% of wt BM25A, Fig. 6C, lane 3) . The efficiency of both (2)-and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis ( Fig. 6B and Fig. 6C , lane 4, respectively) from construct BM-39G, on the other hand, was significantly blocked (,10% and ,21.8% of wt BM25A, respectively). Sequencing analysis from VP1 revealed that the mutants BM-39A and BM-39G reverted back to the wt sequence, but the mutant BM-39U still maintained the mutated sequence. The results together suggest that (1) the substitution of the 39-most nucleotide cytosine with other nucleotide species is sensitive for (2 )-strand DI RNA synthesis and (2) the substitution of the 39-most cytosine residue by uracil, but not adenine or guanine, is more tolerant for (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis. The nucleotide species at the 39-most position (21) , therefore, is important, but not critical, for both (2)-and (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis.
