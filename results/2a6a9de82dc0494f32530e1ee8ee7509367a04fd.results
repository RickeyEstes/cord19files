We have successfully established genome centers with partner institutions in four different countries: Republic of Georgia, Kingdom of Jordan, Uganda, and Gabon, and developed extensive genomic research collaboration with several other countries. These genome centers are provided with a standardized sequencing platform, standard operating protocols and GLP training, and bioinformatics analysis tools and associated computational hardware.
