For our analytic model, we obtained explicit equations for the mean and median delays for various levels of heterogeneity as well as results for the sensitivity of the delays for all levels of heterogeneity. Recall that the two parameters of our derived density function for delays are the sparking rate a, which is the rate at which infections are introduced from outside of the population, and the sweep rate b, which is the rate of change of R 0 . The parameter p indicates the degree of heterogeneity in secondary cases. For the case p ¼ 1, which corresponds to the heterogeneity caused by the assumption of exponentially distributed infectious period in our simulation model, the mean follows where G denotes the upper incomplete gamma function and the median is equal to ÀW(À1=(2 b=a e)) À 1 b , ð3:2Þ where W denotes the non-principal branch of the Lambert W function. The median is equal to b log 2þ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi ab log 2 p ab , ð3:3Þ when p ¼ 2. Recall that p ¼ 2 corresponds to a Poisson distribution of secondary cases, whereas p ¼ 0.5 corresponds to a highly overdispersed distribution of secondary cases. In the electronic supplementary material, we show that for all p the sensitivity of the mean and median to changes in either the sparking rate or the sweep rate depends only on the quotient of those two parameters. For relatively high sparking rates, the mean and median have a similar level of sensitivity to both parameters. As the sparking rate becomes relatively lower, the sweep rate becomes less important because for a broad range of rates the probability of an epidemic will be close to one by the time the first spark occurs. The level of heterogeneity in the distribution of secondary cases determines how quickly this transition happens by way of its effect on the relationship between R 0 and the probability of an epidemic. Overall, the analytic results provide a rather simple picture of the waiting times. However, in the rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 13: 20160540 electronic supplementary material, we also show that the picture can be rather different if R 0 changes according to a step function instead of increasing linearly. For example, the median delay has the lowest proportional sensitivity to the sparking rate when the median delay just exceeds the time of the jump in R 0 . In the following, we explore the extent to which the picture changes due to the elements included in our more complicated simulation models. With data from stochastic simulations, we found mean bifurcation delay to decrease with increasing values of (i) sparking rate, (ii) population size, (iii) rate of increase in transmission, and (iv) infectious period (figure 2). These qualitative effects were not surprising, although the results highlight the importance of particular combinations of life-history traits. For instance, at a given value for the transmission rate's rate of change (a), different mean infectious periods (1/g) can lead to very different predicted and observed distributions of bifurcation delay (figure 2b-d ) because short infectious periods (i.e. high recovery rates) lead to lower sweep rates for a given value of a. The sparking rate and the sweep rate parameters of the analytic model are thus also important parameters of the simulated delay times. This parametrization also leads to a strong correlation of the delays of the frequency-and density-dependent models, although the delays of the frequency-dependent model are typically a little smaller (electronic supplementary material, figure S2 ). Note that the sweep rate is independent of population size in the frequency-dependent model, so the relationship between life-history parameters and delay is highly dependent on the type of transmission. Closer examination of the sensitivity of the median simulated delay to changes in the sweep rate revealed both similarities and differences with our analytic model. This sensitivity may be quantified as the slope of a least-squares line in the plot of log(median delay) versus log(sweep rate). Such a slope is an estimate of the elasticity of the median with respect to the sweep rate. Consistent with the analytic results, increasing the sparking rate a increases the slope of the negative relationship between median simulation delays and the sweep rate ( figure 3 and table 4 ). However, for large a the elasticity for the simulated delays is much more negative than 20.5, which is the minimum possible value for our analytic model (electronic supplementary material). This discrepancy is due to simulations tending to produce more delay than expected, which is in large part a consequence of the stringent conditions for an epidemic in our simulations. In general, predictions based on theory derived assuming large, fixed population sizes are representative of stochastic simulations (figure 2; electronic supplementary material, figure S3 ). Recursive partitioning shows that approximately 78% of the variation in KL divergence can be accounted for by the sparking (a) and sweep (b) rates. Differences in predicted and observed delay distributions were greatest with slow sweep rates, fast recovery rates, high sparking rates and small population sizes (electronic supplementary material, figure S3 ). For a given combination of host and pathogen life-history parameters, longer delays give rise to larger outbreaks, because R 0 continues to increase ever-higher above the critical value of 1. Thus, a measles outbreak that occurs, by chance, 1 year after the population becomes supercritical will be larger, on average, than a measles outbreak that occurs six months after the population becomes supercritical (assuming the same underlying parameters). The slope of this relationship between delay and prevalence within a life-history parametrization depends on how quickly R 0 changes relative to the sparking rate (i.e. b/a, figure 4) . Note that the relationship between delay and prevalence does not necessarily hold across parameter combinations (i.e. when comparing different diseases; figure 4 ). Systems with shorter delays can have higher peak prevalence if they exhibit a longer infectious period, for instance, and thus a faster change in R 0 over time (which itself contributes to differences in mean delay).
