Thirteen document types were identified in a total of 4729 publications. Articles (3658) were the most commonly used document type which accounted for 77.4% of the total publications. They were followed by reviews (425; 9.0%), short surveys (140; 3.0%), notes (136, 2.9%) and letters (131; 2.8%). For language analysis, 22 languages were used in these publications. English is the dominant language with 4384 (92.7%) publications, followed by French (110; 2.3%), Russian (78; 1.6%) and Spanish (30; 0.6%). The total publications per year are presented in Fig. 1 . The results illustrated that the study of WNV reveals an overall increasing trend in the total number of scientific publications from 1943 to 2016. Our results indicate that this trend is best fit by an exponential model (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.775, versus r = 0.712 after linear adjustment). A moderate positive significant correlation was found between the years and number of scientific publications (P < 0.001). This research trend in the field of WNV can be roughly divided into the following three stages. The first stage was from 1943 to 1999, in which the annual quantity of the number of scientific publications related to WNV published was fluctuated, but was mainly in low rate of research growth. Statistical analysis revealed a low positive significant correlation between the years during 1943 to 1999 and number of scientific publications Furthermore, a total of 106 countries contributed to the scientific output in the field of WNV research from 1943 to 2016. Contributions from LMIC were considerably small, that is, (n = 519; 11%). Table 1 On the other hand, the publication indicators for the top 10 most prolific countries regarding WNV research are presented in Table 2 . The country with the greatest number of scientific publications in WNV research field was the USA with 2304 (48.7%) publications, followed by France with 224 (4.7%) publications, and Canada with 222 (4.7%) publications. The top 10 countries are responsible for 76.2% of the total number of scientific publications. Regarding the international collaboration, the USA collaborated with other countries/territories in 421 publications; which accounted for 18.3% of its total 2304 publications. This was followed by France with 136 (60.7%) publications, and the UK which was collaborated in 87 (64.9%) publications. All publications related to WNV achieved h-index of 140 and were cited 124,222 times. The median [interquartile range] number of citations per article thus amounts to 9 . The USA had the highest h-index of 131, while the other countries into the 10 most prolific countries had an h-index between 18 and 40. It is observed that Italy was ranked 4 th in regards to the number of scientific publications but only 8th regarding h-index; and Israel was ranked 8 th regarding the number of scientific publications but 5 th in regards to h-index. More than 26.9% of the WNV related publications were published in the top 10 journals as listed in Table 3 . Emerging Infectious Diseases is the most productive journal with 227 articles, followed by Journal of Virology with 162 articles, American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene with 161 articles, and Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases with 157 articles. The maps presented in Fig. 2a , b and c show the most frequently used terms in the titles and abstracts of the publications related to WNV from three specific publication time periods (1943-1999, 2000-2006, and 2007-2016) . Figure 2a shows the terms with high cooccurrence frequencies for the period 1943-1999. Here, three loosely connected clusters and scattered were distinguished in which the three most used topics in WNV were signified by three colored clusters: blue, green, and red colors. In this figure, there seems to be two major clusters, one in green color, and one in red color. Green cluster contained terms related to phylogenetic evolution topic, and red cluster contained terms related to transmission topic. Figure 2b shows the terms with high co-occurrence frequencies for the period 2000-2006. Here, six most used topics related to WNV were distinguished which were signified by six colored clusters: blue, green, purple, yellow, cyan, and red colors. In this figure, there seems to be three major clusters, one in green color, one in blue color, and one in red color. Green cluster contained terms related to phylogenetic evolution topic, red cluster contained terms related to transmission topic, and blue cluster contained terms related to signs and symptoms topic. Figure 2c shows the terms with high co-occurrence frequencies for the period 2007-2016. Here four most used topics related to WNV were distinguished which were signified by four colored clusters: blue, green, yellow, and red colors. Blue cluster contained terms related to phylogenetic evolution topic, green cluster contained terms related to transmission topic, yellow cluster contained terms related to signs and symptoms topic, and red cluster contained terms related to ecology and epidemiology of WNV topic. Table 4 lists the 20 most cited publications [8, 9, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . The number of citations derived from each work ranges from 1055 to 341. The top 20 publications were published in 12 journals. The Emerging Infectious Diseases published the most publications among those top 20 cited publications and also achieved the largest number of citations with 4 publications. This journal was followed by the New England Journal of Medicine that generated the largest number of citations with 3 publications with the highest IF value (59.558) among these 12 journals. The most common study design of the list of the most cited publications related to WNV was "laboratory-based
