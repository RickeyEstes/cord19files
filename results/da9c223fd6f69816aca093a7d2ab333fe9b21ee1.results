To enable identification of medium-low abundant proteins, only samples with a total content of hemoglobin lower than 4.52 Î¼g/mL were included in the study. Total hemoglobin absorbance and the resulting hemoglobin content were calculated for all the piglet sera in both discovery (n = 50) and validation (n = 70) phases of the study [Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 2:  Table S2 , respectively]. Fractioning of the sera resulted in six different pH fractions; F1 = pH9, F2 = pH7, F3 = pH5, F4 = pH4, F5 = pH3, and F6 = organic solvent. The fractions F1, F4, and F6 were analyzed on the three surfaces CM10, IMAC30, and H50 at both low and high focus masses. Fractions F2 and F3 were excluded from further analyses because preliminary data with 3 serum samples showed that they still contained elevated quantities of abundant proteins (such as albumin), as well as the quality of the spectra and the number of signals detected were very low. Fraction F5 was excluded because no signals were detected. The fractions F1, F4, and F6 on the surfaces CM10, IMAC30, and H50 showed generally good signal intensities and low coefficient of variation (CV) values (< 30%) in both the discovery and validation phases. Exceptions were fraction F1 on IMAC30 (analyzed at high focus mass) and H50 (both low and high focus masses), as well as fraction F4 on H50 (low focus mass), which were therefore excluded from further analyses.
