Six of ten tested bat cell lines are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection Figure 1A, 1B) . These results were also confirmed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) in cell lines inoculated with MERS-CoV/EMC ( Figure 1C ) or MERS-CoV/Jor ( Figure 1D ). Infected cells were detected by MERS-CoV spike protein IFA. Representative images were picked from those taken on day 1 or day 3 post-exposure, as cytopathic viral effects diminished immunofluorescence in some cell lines (e.g., EidNi/41.3, RoNi/7.1, RoNi/7.2 cells, Figure 1C ). Images of bat cells (day 1 post-exposure) inoculated with MERS-CoV/EMC taken by a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Figure 1E
