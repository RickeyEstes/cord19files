To obtain a general profile of the distribution, we first analyzed all the available cases during this 2019-nCoV pneumonia outbreak 16 . As shown in Figure 1A , the number of cases remained stable from January 11 to 15, 2020, and the number of newly added and cumulative cases increased rapidly after January 16. The first death was reported on January 10, and the number of deaths began to increase rapidly from January 17, with the cumulative death number reaching 312 on January 30 ( Figure 1B ) 6 . After the nucleic acid assay becoming available, suspected cases waiting for laboratory confirmation could now be diagnosed more rapidly 17 . After January 19, suspected cases increased rapidly, and about 40-50% of these suspected cases were then diagnosed as confirmed cases ( Figure 1C ). Before January 19, the number of severe cases, remained at a low level but increased steadily since January 20 ( Figure 1D ). Because Wuhan is the capital city of Hubei province and the cases have spread to the rest of Hubei province quickly, we also analyzed the change in number of cases in Hubei province. On January 9, 41 cases were first reported, and by January 30, 5,806 cases were reported, accounting for 59.91% of the total cases in China ( Figure 1E ). The cumulative number of deaths in Hubei province is 249, accounting for 96.14% of total deaths in China ( Figure 1F ). These data indicated that both the incidence and mortality of 2019-nCoV disease is the highest in Hubei province 18 . Before January 16, cases were mainly reported in Hubei province. From January 17 onward, the outbreak spread to many provinces and the number of cases increased rapidly. Therefore, our spatial and temporal analyses used data from January 17 to January 30, 2020. Location of each case was extracted from official reports and mapped on the national map .
