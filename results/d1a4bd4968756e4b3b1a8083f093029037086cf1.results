Previously published reports have detailed the development and performance of the hRSV high-throughput screen and the identification of hit compounds derived from the screening of the NIH Molecular Libraries chemical collection . The same screening assay and format was used here to screen 100,000 compounds from the ChemBridge Small Molecule Library (Chembridge, 2015) . We selected compounds with EC 50 values <20 lM and selective indices (SI) > 5 as hits. The primary and confirmatory screens resulted in 30 confirmed hits, with EC 50 s ranging from 0.66 to 20 lM and SIs ranging from 6 to 55. Compounds for further characterization were selected based on potency, their previous characterization, reactivity, and tractability for chemical optimization. Compounds characterized in previous hRSV screening campaigns (Matharu et al., 2014; Moore et al., 2012; were not further characterized here. The most potent, novel confirmed compound from this HTS screen was (1-[6-(2-furyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-3yl]methyl-1H-benzimidazole), the structure of which is shown in Table 1 . This compound has not been previously reported as effective against hRSV and was designated as SRI 29365. Based on confirmed and potent in vitro antiviral activity, the lack of previously-reported antiviral activity, ant the potential for chemical modification, SRI 29365 was chosen for further characterization to determine EC 50 , CC 50 , SI, structure-activity relationships, broad antiviral activity, mechanism of action, and in vivo potency.
