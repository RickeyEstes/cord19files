A total of 117 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples were included in our study and tested by Alere i RSV and Altona RealStar RSV RT-PCR. In three samples, the Alere i RSV assay was invalid, as the lyophilized test reagents were not properly dispensed due to a handling failure. These samples were excluded from the analysis. The 114 remaining NPS were collected from patients hospitalized due to lower respiratory tract infection (n ϭ 79), upper respiratory tract infection (n ϭ 12), or nonrespiratory diagnoses, including, e.g., febrile convulsions or gastroenteritis with concomitant respiratory tract infection (n ϭ 14). In 9 patients, the admission diagnosis was not reported. The median age of the patients included in our analysis was 12 months (range, 2 weeks to 17.7 years). Altona RealStar RSV RT-PCR was RSV positive in 43% (49/114) and RSV negative in 57% ( The Alere i RSV test result was true positive in 49 out of 49 samples and true negative in 63 out of 65 samples. We did not undertake comprehensive analytical specificity testing but note that the 65 samples with a negative Altona RealStar RSV RT-PCR result included samples which had previously tested positive for influenza A (n ϭ 10), influenza B (n ϭ 6), parainfluenza (n ϭ 3), human metapneumovirus (n ϭ 9), coronavirus (n ϭ 7), rhinovirus (n ϭ 17), parechovirus (n ϭ 1), and adenovirus (n ϭ 1). Of the 2 samples with diverging test results, 1 test result was interpreted as false positive, whereas the other test result was invalid due to sample interference (Fig. 1) . In both cases, we could not conduct confirmation testing due to limited sample volume. For the calculation of the Alere i RSV specificity, both samples with diverging test results were considered false positive. We thus report a conservative estimate of the Alere i RSV performance. The combined RSV A and B test sensitivity for the Alere i RSV was 100% (95% CI, 89 to 100%). The specificity of the Alere i RSV test was 97% (95% CI, 89% to 100%) ( Table 1) . The Alere i RSV test includes a 3-min step of preheating the lysis buffer, followed by the nicking enzyme amplification reaction with a maximum duration of 10 min. The assay identifies positive test results as soon as an amplification threshold is reached. In this study, the median duration of the nicking enzyme amplification reaction in RSV-positive samples was 1.8 min (range, 1.7 min to 3.9 min). Hence, in RSV-negative samples, the total duration of the test assay was 13 min (3 min of preheating plus 10 min of amplification), whereas it was only approximately 5 to 7 min in RSV-positive samples. Positive test results were identified quicker in samples with high viral load (C T value of Ͻ25), although the absolute differences are small and probably of minor importance in routine care (Fig. 2) .
