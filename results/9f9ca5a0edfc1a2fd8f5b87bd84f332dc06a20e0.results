Interpreting Pauses of Polymerase Activity Observed in High-Throughput Magnetic Tweezers Experiments Using PV RdRp and a Mutator Derivative Since the elucidation of the first kinetic mechanism for a nucleic acid polymerase nearly 30 years ago (Kuchta et al., 1987 (Kuchta et al., , 1988 , the approaches used to interrogate the kinetics, mechanism, and fidelity of nucleic acid polymerases have remained essentially the same. A single cycle of nucleotide addition is monitored. When processive incorporation is monitored, quantitative analysis is only possible when measuring ten or fewer incorporation events. How ensemble measurements made on a short primed template, and corresponding inferences, inform the real-world scenario in which thousands or even millions of incorporation events must occur remains to be determined. Here, we study polymerase kinetics by monitoring elongation for thousands of nucleotide-incorporation events with near-single-nucleotide resolution in relative position. (As absolute position is established at lower resolution, we do not report on the sequence context.) The initial study employing this method used the RdRp from bacteriophage F6, an enzyme for which extensive kinetic data and corresponding mechanistic models had been lacking (Dulin et al., 2015c) . Much of what is known about the kinetics, mechanism, and fidelity of viral RdRps has been learned from studies of picornaviral RdRps, in particular PV RdRp (Cameron et al., 2016) . The PV enzyme therefore permits comparisons between the magnetic tweezers experiment and classical approaches. In addition, PV RdRp derivatives exist to permit kinetic and mechanistic parameters determined by using the magnetic tweezers experiment to be correlated to rate and equilibrium constants obtained by using classical approaches. The experimental design is shown in Figure 1 . Following successful initiation on a short hairpin located at the 3 0 end of the template strand of the dsRNA tether, RNA synthesis by PV RdRp displaces the templating strand from the tethering strand, lengthening the bead-tethered RNA because of its conversion from dsRNA to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) ( Figure 1A ) (Dulin et al., 2015c) . Single, elongating molecules of PV RdRp examined in high-throughput mode ( Figure S1A ) exhibited stochastic dynamics in which bursts of nucleotide addition were interrupted by pauses lasting <10 s ( Figure 1B ). From these time courses, we first extract coarsegrained information pertaining to the processivity of PV RdRp on the dsRNA template. The median processivity was found to equal 1,390 ± 160 bp ( Figure 1C ; unless mentioned otherwise, see Experimental Procedures for descriptions of error determination) at a saturating concentration of nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs; 1 mM of each NTP). Second, we collect more fine-grained information that allows us to extract mechanistic insight from the dataset by recording the dwell times of PV RdRp in consecutive windows of 5-nt-addition cycles (Dulin et al., , 2015c . We fit a general stochastic-pausing model to the data using maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) (Figures S1B and S1C; Supplemental Experimental Procedures) and illustrate the results by showing empirical dwell-time distributions together with the fits ( Figure 1D ). Three distinct kinetic behaviors were observed in the dwell-time analysis: a fast phase of sub-second duration and two slow phases of durations $1 s (termed pause 1) and $5 s (termed pause 2) ( Figure 1D ). The component of the distribution in the time regime less than 1 s is dominated by polymerases synthesizing RNA through the dwell-time window without pausing. In the absence of noise, we expect this portion of the curve to be described by a gamma distribution of an order equal to the number of nucleotides in a dwell-time window (5 nt in this case). Our fits do not consistently yield a number of sub-steps agreeing with the 5-nt dwell-time window; this suggests that noise influences the short dwell times, preventing us from reporting the nucleotide addition rate. For longer dwell times, noise can be suppressed by filtering, and we can determine the fraction of dwell times where RNA synthesis was momentarily paused. We can extract several useful parameters relating to the pause dynamics: the apparent pause exit rates of pauses 1 and 2 (k 1 and k 2 , respectively) and the pause probabilities (P 1 and P 2 , respectively). At saturating nucleotide concentrations (100 mM per NTP), we find that elongating polymerases enter the fast phase with a probability of 83.0% (Figure 1D ; calculated using the integral under the green solid line as detailed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures), enter pause 1 with a probability P 1 of 16.7% ( Figure 1D ; calculated using the integral under the dark blue solid line), and enter pause 2 with a probability P 2 of 0.3% ( Figure 1D ; calculated using the integral under the light blue solid line). To obtain a baseline understanding of PV dynamics, we examine the nucleotide concentration dependence of the overall processivity and the dwell-time distributions. As expected, values of the median processivity decrease with decreasing nucleotide concentration ( Figure 2A ). The largest effect of decreasing nucleotide concentration on the dwell-time distribution is observed in the time regime greater than 10 s ( Figure 2B ). Pause exit rate k 1 is directly correlated with nucleotide concentration, ranging from 0.9/s to 0.06/s ( Figure 2C , dark blue points). Probability P 1 is inversely correlated with nucleotide concentration, ranging from 17% to 41% ( Figure 2D , dark blue points). Pause exit rate k 2 also correlated directly with nucleotide concentration, ranging from 0.2/s to 0.02/s. (Figure 2C , light blue points). Probability P 2 also correlated inversely with nucleotide concentration, ranging from 0.3% to 5% ( Figure 2D , light blue points). As the probability of PV RdRp to engage in only nucleotide addition equals one minus the sum of P 1 and P 2 , this approximates unity at saturating concentrations. Since pause 1 is quite probable, we cannot rule out that the fitted exit rate simply inherits its dependence on nucleotide concentration ( Figure 2C ) from the facts that repeated entries into the pause would extend its apparent lifetime and the probability of repeated entry is determined through a kinetic competition between the pause entry rate and a nucleotide-dependent (A) Schematic of the experimental assay to monitor RNA synthesis. F represents the constant force applied to the (predominantly) dsRNA tether. Apart from a short hairpin to the 3 0 end of the 2.8-kb template strand to enable primed initiation by PV RdR, the dsRNA tether is as described in Dulin et al. (2015c) . During RNA synthesis, the RdRp displaces the template strand from the tethering strand, increasing the end-to-end distance of the magnetic bead from the coverslip surface.

The traces are acquired at an acquisition frequency of 25 Hz and are subsequently low-pass filtered at 0.5 Hz and synchronized, resulting in the representation shown. Collectively, these traces illustrate the variation in the dynamics and processivity of PV RdRp, with the leftmost traces including almost no pauses and the rightmost traces including many short pauses. (C) Histogram of the processivity of 77 PV RdRps under the conditions described in (B). (D) The dwell-time distribution is extracted from 77 time courses of RNA synthesis by PV RdRp acquired at 30 pN applied force and 100 mM NTP concentration. The red circles represent all the data, whereas the black circles represent the data that remain after filtering out the shortest and longest dwell times (0.05% of the total data collected). We fit this distribution to a stochastic-pausing model (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) using MLE (dashed black line). For clarity, we individually plot each contribution to the dwell-time distribution: the gamma distribution (green), the first short pause (pause 1; dark blue), and the second short pause (pause 2; light blue). Error bars are determined as described in Experimental Procedures. catalytic step. Since pause 2 will only have been entered multiple times for a few percent of the scored long pauses ( Figure 2D ), repeated pause entry cannot affect the order of magnitude change seen in the exit rate of pause 2 ( Figure 2C ). We consider whether nucleotide misincorporation by PV underlies the observed pausing behavior. Misincorporation of nucleotides by PV RdRp in vitro and in cells occurs at a frequency no greater than 0.0001 per nucleotide-incorporation event at rates much less than 0.1/s . Therefore, it is impossible to conclude that pause 1 is the result of misincorporation. A state capable of correct nucleotide incorporation, but with low efficiency, is most probable. If pause 2 is a signature of nucleotide misincorporation (Dulin et al., 2015c) , then one must account for the higher frequency and rate observed here relative to classical methods . However, such methods generally only evaluate utilization of a single, incorrect nucleotide , and the experimental configuration employed differs in the use of a dsRNA template under applied force. To explore the potential impact of these differences, we examined the dependence of PV kinetics on applied force ( Figure S2A ). When the applied force is lowered, the exit rates k 1 and k 2 both decrease by a factor of $2 ( Figure S2B , dark blue and light blue points), showing that our experimental configuration impacts the measured rates. However, the probabilities to enter each state are maintained constant over the experimentally accessible force range ( Figure S2C , dark and light blue points). To rule in or rule out nucleotide misincorporation as a contributor to pause 1 and/or pause 2, we exploited the existence of a PV derivative with a mutator phenotype . The H273R PV RdRp increases the frequency of all types of mutations by relaxing one of the fidelity checkpoints used by PV RdRp . When examined at the single-molecule level, H273R PV RdRp exhibited a processivity of ð1; 081 ± 125Þ bp ( Figure 3A ), unaltered within experimental error compared to wild-type (WT) PV RdRp. We also examined the corresponding dwell-time distributions ( Figure 3B ), reasoning that an increased pause probability would be observed if the pause reflected, even in part, nucleotide misincorporation. When the H273R PV RdRp derivative was employed, it appeared that the parameters related to pause 1 (Figures 3C and 3D) do not change relative to WT. The probability P 2 increased by $6.3-fold ( Figure 3F ); a 3-to 5-fold increase in mutation frequency was observed for H273R PV RdRp using classical methods and in cells . The exit rate k 2 increased by $50% ( Figure 3E ); a 20-fold increase in G:U mispair extension is observed for H273R PV RdRp using classical methods (Moustafa et al., 2014) . These observations with H273R PV RdRp point to nucleotide misincorporation as the origin of pause 2 during the elongation reaction observed in the magnetic tweezers experiments. If this is the case, then the magnetic tweezers data suggest that the frequency of mutation may be underestimated by classical methods, perhaps a reflection of evaluating one nucleotide at a time (see probability at concentrations R100 mM in Figure 2D ). In addition, the magnetic tweezers data reveal a higher probability of misincorporation at lower nucleotide concentration (see probability at concentrations %100 mM in Figure 2D ). Based on these findings, we construct a working kinetic model for elongation by PV RdRp that invokes a high-efficiency state favoring nucleotide addition and two paused states, of which at least the longest-lived Figure 3G . The kinetic parameters extracted from these fits are shown in (C) and (D). (C) Exit rates out of pause 1 (k 1 , dark blue) and pause 2 (k 2 , light blue) as a function of NTP concentration.
