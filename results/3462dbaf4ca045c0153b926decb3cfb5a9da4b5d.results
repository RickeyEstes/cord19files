Clinical and laboratory features for 51 CCHF patients in this study are summarized in Table 1 . Nine of the cases died because of CCHF (fatal CCHF group). Forty-two cases were survived (nonfatal CCHF group). The overall fatality rate was 17.6%. Serum neopterin levels raised in all CCHF patients on the first day of hospitalization (>10 nmol/L), reaching a mean concentration of 73.22 AE 54.30 nmol/L. The mean neopterin concentration of healthy blood donors was 4.78 AE 1.26 nmol/L. Thus, the mean neopterin concentration in CCHF patients exceeded that of the controls by approximately 15-fold (p < 0.0001). The mean concentration of neopterin in fatal group (153.66 AE 81.34 nmol/L) was nearly threefold higher than that of nonfatal group (55.99 AE 24.09 nmol/L) (Fig. 1) . The difference between fatal and nonfatal groups was statistically significant (p Z 0.0001). The levels of neopterin at the last day of hospitalization in fatal group (173.14 AE 152.16 nmol/L) were also significantly higher than that of nonfatal group (28.53 AE 17.01 nmol/L) (p Z 0.002). The other parameters analyzed for mortality are also presented in Table 1 . In univariate analysis, the serum level of neopterin on the first day of hospitalization, bleeding, platelet count, AST and LDH were associated with mortality (Table 1) . Multivariate analysis was done excluding parameters with very low odds ratios (AST and LDH). Only, the serum level of neopterin on the first day of hospitalization was associated with mortality ( Table 2) . ROC curves were generated to determine the value of neopterin on the first day of hospitalization as a mortality risk factor. AUC was 0.939 (p Z 0.0001, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85e1.00). According to a cut-off value of 105 nmol/L, the negative and positive predictive values were 95.2% and 77.8%, respectively, with 77.8% sensitivity and 95.2% specificity.
