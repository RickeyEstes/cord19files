In the literature review, there were 1997 and 322 English publications on human studies identified in PubMed when the combination of keywords 'virus, pneumonia, treatment' and 'SARS, treatment' were used on 11 January 2004, respectively. Among the 1997 publications, those related to HIV and AIDS patients (950), cancer and transplant patients (501), and vaccine and immunization topics (287), were excluded. The remaining 259 papers were retrieved and analysed. All the 322 SARS paper were retrieved and analysed. Subsequent PubMed search using the keywords of 'influenza, pneumonia, treatment', 'respiratory syncytial virus, pneumonia, treatment', 'varicella, pneumonia, treatment', 'adenovirus, pneumonia, treatment', and 'hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, treatment' identified another 623, 267, 240, 146 and 83 papers, respectively. The cited bibliographies, if relevant, were also included in this review. However, only 62 of these 1940 papers contained clinical details and information on the medical treatment of viral pneumonia (44 papers) and SARS (18 papers), respectively. Of the 302 patients with non-SARS viral pneumonia in 44 case reports or series (Table 1) , their aetiological diagnoses of human influenza A virus (nZ38), avian influenza A H5N1 virus (nZ12), varicella zoster virus (VZV) (nZ120), adenovirus (nZ29), hantavirus (nZ100), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (nZ1), measles virus (nZ1), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (nZ1), were documented by a combination of clinical features, radiographic changes, virological and serological tests. 6, 7, Demographic details were mentioned in 171 (56.6%) patients. There were 113 males and 58 females, with a median age of 31 years (ranged . The small number of patients suffering from pneumonia caused by RSV, measles, EBV precluded any meaningful analysis or discussion. [56] [57] [58] As for the other agents, the overall mortality ranges from 9.2% (VZV), 20.7% (adenovirus), 31.6% (human In the treatment of human influenza A infection, antiviral agents such as rimantadine (one patient), oseltamivir (five patients), and a combination of rimantadine and oseltamivir had been used at a median of 3 days (ranged 1-7 days) after admission. [20] [21] [22] [23] High dose corticosteroid without antiviral therapy was also attempted. [20] [21] [22] The dose of steroids ranged from hydrocortisone 250 mg IVI every 4 hourly to methylprednisolone 500 mg IVI every 6 hourly. 21, 22 Amantadine (four patients), oseltamivir (three patients), and a combination of antivirals and corticosteroid (three patients) had also been used in the treatment of avian influenza A H5N1 infection. 6, 7 There was no apparent benefit since the antiviral agents were started at a median of 5 days (ranged 0-5 days) after admission. Corticosteroid such as intravenous methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg every 6 hourly for 3-4 days had been given in three mechanically ventilated patients but two of them died of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 6, 7 As for VZV pneumonia, antiviral therapy including intravenous acyclovir 10-15 mg/kg every 8 hourly for 7-10 days was initiated in 66 out of 120 patients. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] Two patients were treated with vidarabine before the widespread use of acyclovir. 27, 38 Corticosteroids were combined with acyclovir in 17 patients. 28, 29, [39] [40] [41] The dosage and duration of steroids were quite variable (Table  1) . 29, [39] [40] [41] Two patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) together with intravenous acyclovir had a favorable outcome. 42, 43 The mortality of patients who received acyclovir or vidarabine alone was seven out of 68 (10.3%), whereas four patients managed with supportive care died. Only one out of 25 patients died if intravenous acyclovir was initiated within 4 days of admission. 27, 34, 35 There was no death in patients treated with a combination of acyclovir and immunomodulators such as corticosteroid and IVIG. 28, 29, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] As for adenoviral pneumonia, no antiviral was ever used for their treatment. Two of four (50%) patient receiving steroid died, which appeared to be higher than patients managed conservatively. 21, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] The mortality for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome treated with intravenous ribavirin (47.7%) appeared to be only slightly lower than those treated conservatively (63.4%). [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] The use of methylprednisolone was associated with a dramatic decrease of mortality to 13.3%. 52, 53 Though there were 849 cases of SARS with treatment details reported in the literature, many of these patients were diagnosed according to the clinical criteria issued by WHO with or without laboratory confirmation (Table 2) . [3] [4] [5] 8, 10, [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] One of the case series was not included because patients treated by different treatment regimens were aggregated together and could not be analysed. 72 There were 349 males and 500 females. Except for 13 (1.5%) patients who were treated conservatively, antiviral therapy and/or immunomodulating therapy were given in all other patients. Of 772 patients receiving specific antiviral therapy and/or immunomodulating therapy, 675 (87.4%) were treated with ribavirin containing regimens and 44 (5.7%) were treated with lopinavir/ritonavir containing regimens during the initial phase of the disease. Immunomodulating therapy without antiviral agents was initiated in 53 of 772 (6.9%) patients. Recombinant interferon alpha, corticosteroid, and a combination of interferon alfacon-1 and corticosteroid were used in 30 (3.9%), 14 (1.8%) and 9 (1.2%) cases, respectively. Of the 64 patients receiving treatment during clinical deterioration, ribavirin or oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and convalescent plasma were given as rescue medical therapy in 32 (50%), 31 (48.4%) and 1 (1.6%), respectively. High dose pulse methylprednisolone was used during clinical deterioration such as oxygen desaturation, worsening of radiographic infiltrates in the chest, recurrent fever without evidence of nosocomial sepsis in some reports. However, the number of patients requiring pulse steroids was not mentioned in most of them. 5, 8, 10, [59] [60] [61] [62] Furthermore, IVIG, thymic peptides, and recombinant human thymus proteins were used in some patients but the clinical details were not sufficient for any meaningful analysis. 61 The overall mortality was 7.7% in these 849 SARS cases. No obvious difference was noted irrespective of whether the patients were treated by ribavirin with or without corticosteroids, corticosteroids alone, or recombinant interferon-alpha given on admission or during deterioration. However, the mortality is only 2.3% in a group of 44 patients treated by lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and corticosteroids, 64 and 0% for nine patients treated with interferon alfacon-1 and corticosteroids. 65 Only one patient received convalescent plasma as rescue therapy. 67 Of the 152 SARS patients in our cohort, their clinical presentation, virological test results, and treatment regimens have been previously reported. 8, 10, 16 The virus load of their nasopharyngeal, serum, stool, and urine specimens collected between day 10 and 15 after onset of symptoms are tabulated in Table 3 . There was no significant relationship between virus load, age, and the presence of co-morbidities. However, significant decreases in virus load were observed when lopinavir/ritonavir was added to ribavirin (Table 3) . It is also interesting to note that stool virus load is significantly higher in males (7.0 vs. 5.5 log 10 copies/ ml, PZ0.02), whereas that of the urine is significantly higher in females (1.6 vs. 0.6 log 10 copies/ml, PZ0.01). Of the 111 (73%) historical controls treated with ribavirin and corticosteroids, 12 randomly selected patients had serial virus load studies performed on their nasopharyngeal specimens; their mean virus loads were 5.2, 7.3, 4.9 and 3.8 log 10 copies/ml at day 5, 10, 15 and 20 after onset of symptoms, respectively (Fig. 1) . The decline in virus load in nasopharyngeal specimens coincided with the appearance of IgG antibody titers against SARS-CoV during the course of infection (Fig. 2) . Since similar clinical studies of other respiratory viral pneumonias were not available in the literature except for a naturally occurring case of influenza, 73 another 12 cases of experimental infection with RSV by artificial inoculation into healthy volunteers were adopted for comparison (Fig. 2) . 74 The virus load of influenza A virus and RSV peaked at day 2 and 3, respectively, whereas that of SARS-CoV occurred at day 10 after onset of symptoms (Fig. 1) . As for the antibody response, baseline antibodies of influenza A virus and RSV were detectable in serum and nasal washings but antibodies against SARS-CoV were not present until day 10 after symptom onset.
