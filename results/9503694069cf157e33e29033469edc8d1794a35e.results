The cost of -1 PRF maintenance Effective -1 PRF events classically comprise three constitutive elements. The first element is a heptameric sequence -the slippery site- (Jacks and Varmus 1985; Plant et al. 2004) . This site has the structure (X XXY YYZ), where X can be any base (A,C,G,U), Y is either A or U, and lastly, Z is either A, C or U (Plant et al. 2004; Plant and Dinman 2006; Ketteler 2012) . The second element is a spacer sequence, separating the slippery site from the third element (Dinman, 2012b) . The spacer sequence typically comprises around 1-12 nucleotides (Ketteler 2012; Dinman, 2012a) . The third element is a pseudoknot, an mRNA secondary structure that is thought to generate a mechanical tension on the spacer sequence when the slippery site is being translated (Ketteler 2012; Dinman, 2012b, a) . To release the tension, the ribosome, while stalling at the slippery site, is pushed one nucleotide back (Dinman, 2012b; Caliskan et al. 2015; Ketteler 2012) . The frequency with which the ribosome is redirected to the -1 frame is called -1 PRF efficiency (Advani et al. 2013; Advani and Dinman 2016) . These criteria were used to generate an extensive database of -1 PRF signals, PRFdb, of the yeast genome by algorithmic search (see Materials and Methods). If PRFdb comprises a sufficiently large set of functional slippery sites, the effects of putative -1 PRF induced costs to translation efficiency should be detectable. To this end, we devised three hypotheses. We derive these hypotheses from the assumption that the maintenance of -1 PRF signals carries an intrinsic cost to the organism. Furthermore, we assume that mutations that alter CUB are accumulated more slowly than mutations that alter -1 PRF efficiency, p. This is because the -1 PRF regulation mechanism is very likely to be affected by only a few mutations, whereas several mutations would be needed to significantly modify CUB. Hence, most short-term changes in protein expression demand in genes with slippery sites are more likely absorbed by -1 PRF. We first introduce a framework to formulate these hypotheses (see Figure 1 ). Let L be the length (in nucleotides) of an mRNA sequence x. A single slippery site is located at site l of x, downstream from the start. Ribosomes are redirected to the -1 frame with probability p, the -1 PRF efficiency. They continue with the mRNA's translation until encountering a premature termination codon (PTC) at a distance l post slippery site. In a first hypothesis, we formed expectations about how the number of slippery sites per gene should vary with the ratio of protein expression to mRNA levels per cell. This ratio has been used as a measure for translation efficiency in past studies (Tuller et al. 2010) . To formulate the first hypothesis, we conduct a thought experiment. Let us assume that an organism's environmental conditions favor lower expression of a protein from a -1 PRF-gene. Then, increasing the average p in that gene will adapt the organism to the new conditions. Conversely, if such environmental changes demanded higher protein expression, genes containing -1 PRF signals may adapt by reducing p. If protein demands exceed the production capacity of a gene with very small p, the -1 PRF mechanism may offer only costs, but no benefits from protein regulation. Then, mutations that remove the heptameric slippery site signature will be selected for. Taken together, these effects imply an asymmetry in the probability of slippery site loss depending on the direction of protein demand changes. Losses of slippery sites are likelier when protein demands increase than when they decrease. -1 PRF signals should thus become rarer with increasing protein expression levels. The second hypothesis states that the costs of -1 PRF maintenance are reduced as slippery sites approach the 59 end or start of the mRNA. Every time ribosomes slip through -1 PRF, the energy of translating Figure 1 Notation for -1 PRF signals. A) The mRNA sequence in which a -1 PRF signal does not lead to ribosomal frameshifting is termed x (green). Arrows indicate the distances in nucleotides. B) The mRNA sequence with -1 PRF is termed x9. This is the concatenation of the mRNA x until the slippery site (green), and the -1 frame after the slippery site until a premature termination codon is encountered (violet). a stretch of length l Ã¾ l of mRNA is wasted for protein production. Since l is roughly constant across within-gene sites (see Fig. S1 ), the cost to translational efficiency incurred from -1 PRF should depend on l. Therefore, diminishing l will minimize cost. Thus, the distribution of slippery site positions relative to the gene length should be skewed toward mRNA starts, that is, small l values. This effect is expected to be weaker than the effect in the first hypothesis. In the first hypothesis, if protein demands exceed yields generated by a gene and p is small, a fitness cost is incurred from i) the reduction of protein expression, ii) the cost of NMD-mediated mRNA degradation and iii) the cost of unnecessary translation of frameshifted mRNA sequences. Displacing the slippery site would only reduce the latter cost. Thus, we expect the signal for this hypothesis to be weaker than for the first hypothesis. The third hypothesis states that a skew in the distribution of the location of the slippery site within a gene (relative to that gene's length) should also become more pronounced with higher expression levels. This is because for fixed p, increasing expression levels should mirror an increase in -1 PRF induced translation costs. Thus, the benefits of slippery sites closer to translation-initiation positions should increase with expression levels. As in the second hypothesis, selection for such an effect is likely to be very weak compared to effects in the first hypothesis. Figure 2 shows the results of testing all three hypotheses. Figure 2A shows that -1 PRF signals in genes become rarer with gene expression, consistent with our first hypothesis. Figure 2B shows that slippery sites positions are more prevalent in the first half of a gene than in the second, consistent with our second hypothesis. The frequency of slippery sites diminishes toward both extremes of mRNA sequences, and more markedly so toward the stop codon of the mRNA. This skew persists when including all genes from the PRFdb (see Figure S2 ). Figure 2C shows that the average slippery site position is displaced toward the 59 end of the mRNA as protein expression levels increase from 10 2 molecules per cell to 10 5 molecules per cell. Above 10 5 molecules per cell, the uncertainty around the averages becomes large due to low sample sizes, and unambiguous deductions become impossible. The decreasing trend in the average l=L with protein expression is confirmed by a linear regression. Lastly, we retested all of the hypotheses with an alternative integrated data set from PaxDB, and obtained the same results (see Figure S3 ). Thus, with increasing demand for protein production, the data suggest that production gains will primarily be attained by disposing of the -1 PRF mechanism present in a gene, rather than minimizing the cost of faulty translation. We speculate that, most likely, this occurs by altering the slippery site sequence. The test of the other two hypotheses involving slippery site displacement (or loss of large-l slippery sites) provide further evidence for an intrinsic -1 PRF cost to translation. The selective pressure on this latter adaptive process appears to be weak. Retesting the translational efficiency hypothesis while accounting for -1 PRF genes Since -1 PRF signals carry a translational cost, their presence in an mRNA sequence changes the meaning of the associated CUB index. In fact, a slippery site may indicate a mismatch between the CUB index of that sequence and the actual efficiency with which it is translated (see Figure 3 ). To elucidate this point, consider an mRNA without -1 PRF signal. In the -1 PRF signal's absence, the CUB index of a translated mRNA sequence appropriately reflects how efficiently ribosomes elongate it in a pre-specified time (see Figure 3A ) (Tuller et al. 2010; Stoletzki and Figure 2 Testing the cost of -1 PRF mechanism maintenance. A) Number of slippery sites -identified by relying on Nupack algorithm for pseudoknot detection (Dirks and Pierce 2004)-per gene and per nucleotide across protein expression levels per mRNA level for genes from the von der Haar data set (von der Haar 2008). The red dotted line is the average number of slippery sites per gene. The blue line is a regression line through the data set. The text in the panels gives i) the Spearman correlation coefficient r and the p-value for the null-hypothesis that the correlation is zero and ii) the slope of the line and the p-value of the t-test for a non-zero slope value. B) The frequency distribution of the within-gene positions of the slippery sites, relative to the length of the gene, l=L: To ensure comparability, only genes from the von der Haar data set are considered. The mean of the distribution, as well as its 95% confidence intervals, are smaller than 0.5 -the expectation in the absence of selective pressure. C) Slippery site positions relative to gene length across protein expression levels in the von der Haar data set. The red line is the average slippery site position (computed across 20 bins of equal width in logarithmic scale) and the widgets are the uncertainty (61:96 standard error of the mean) around the average estimate. Averages with large uncertainties are in violet. Analogously to A), a regression line with the corresponding correlation coefficient r (with p-value) and slope (with p-value) are added. -Walker 2007; Akashi 1994) . However, given a functional slippery site in that same mRNA sequence, the interpretation changes (see Figure 3B ). Let us assume an average -1 PRF efficiency p. Then, a fraction p of the times in which a ribosome is in the process of translating a specific mRNA, it will be redirected to another frame by -1 PRF. This redirection leads to degradation of the mRNA. Thus, the production of the same number of proteins will require more energy and time in the presence of a -1 PRF signal than it would in its absence. However, traditional CUB indices will give no indication of that process. If accounted for, -1 PRF must therefore lead to a downward correction of the mRNA's translational efficiency and with it, of the associated CUB index.
