We estimate losses of US exports associated with Stage I of the illustrative outbreak scenario (outbreak occurring only in Cambodia) to range from US$12.9 million to US$63.7 million and to place 1,491 export-related US jobs at risk (Figures 1 and 2) . If the illustrative outbreak were to expand to all 9 countries in the illustrative outbreak scenario (Stage III), the potential lost value of US exports would increase to a range of US$8.4 billion to US$41.4 billion, with almost 1.4 million export-related US jobs at risk (Figures 1 and 2) .
