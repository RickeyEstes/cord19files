At 37 "C. the wt virus and the ts mutant D85 replicate equally well in DBT cells (Fig. 1A) . However, at the per-missive temperature, the maximum titre obtamed with the ts mutant was approx. IO-times lower than that of the wt vitus. At 39.5 "C, the replication of D8j was completely inhibited (Fig. 1B) . To compare the pathogenicity of D85 to vn MHV 3, groups of twenty mice were inoculated i.p. with 1.10' PFUlmouse. This route was chosen because it had been demonstrated to result in earlier death of sensitive animals. Whilst wt MHV 3 killed 103% of the mice at 5 days p.i., D85 only killed 15% of the mice during the same period (Fig. ZA) . Although the LDm of wt MHV 3 WOE less than 1 PNlmouse. inoculation of as much as 5, IO1 PFUi mouse of D85 only ki!!rd 35% of the mice. Z>aily inspection showed that bath groups of mice erh?:,tted general lethargy. This symptom initially appeared 1.5 to 2 days pi. in the case of the wt virus and 3 days pi. in that of the mutant, and persisted until death or recovery. The bar': temperature of the mice remained at the same level throughout the infection (data not shown) indicating that survival following infection with this mutant was not a result of an increase in body temperature. Viral replicadon in the liver Vim1 titres. Maximal virus titre in liver homogenates was the same with both viruses (Fig. 2B) . However, the maximal titre for the D85 mutant ofcured 1 to 2 days later than the equivalent point fat the wt virus; this coincides with the maximum intensity of the clmical symptoms. During the recovery of D85 infected mice, the viral titre decreased rapidly and was undetectable after day 7. Virus isolated from the livers of D85 infected mice was st~!l thermosensitive. Vim1 RNA defecdon. RNA extracted from liven of two Infected mice at difterent timer p-t_ was hybridized with a specific probe from genomic viral RNA, The dot blot analysis showed that the presence of MHV 3 RNA in Ihe hmng wal w11Ic1im11cs interrupted. In addition, SEM examination rcvcalcd that when endotheiial cells were present in the sinusoids invaded with red blood cells (Fig. 58) . they displayed only a few fensstrae (msert Fig. 5B ) compared to umnfected liver endothehal cells (insert Fig. 4B ). After freeze-fracture, TEM examination confirmed thts wrpriwtg decrease in the number of rndothelial cell fe-nc~trac (Fig. SC) which did not involve wy other apoarent cellular membrane lesions. In this figure only 46 fenestrae were counted for a surface of 32.5#m2. In order to quantify this phenomenon a morphometric study was rifttied out or 41200 wt2 of endothelial cell membranes of both contx,: and infected mice livers and these tesolls ate summarized in Tabic 1. A Z-fold decrease in the mmtber of fenestrae per unit surface was found after 3 days of infection with MHV 3. In addition to these sinusoidal lesions. an itoportant he. patocytolysis was obsuvrd 72 h p.i. (Fig. SA) . Only a few parenchymal cells were still recognizable. They displayed aa &cutniii&on of lipid droplets (Fig. 5A ). a dilatation of the RER ctstetnae and picootic nuclei (not shown). Viral panicles wete sometimes encountered near the large RER but were most frequently observed at the hcpatocyte-sinunotd border (not shown), or in sinusoids associated with fibrin deposits (Fig. SA, insert) . After mfection with Dg5. we were able to observe stmilx necrotic lesions in the sinusoid and to the hepalocytcs. But these lesions wete found only in a few areas. The only nottceable change in the hepatocytes, apatt from glycogen depletion, consisted o. a widespread steatosis observed both under TEM (Fig. 6A ) ztd SEM (Fig. 68) . The majority of sinusoidal cells .uere intact and the endothelial cells exhibited as many fenestrae (Ftg. 68) as those obcetved in uninfected cells (Fig. 4B and insert) . liver was maximal at 3 days p.i.; with DS5 detectton of YI-IBI RNA increased until 5 days p.i. and then decreased (Fig. ZC) . The RNA could still be detected 20 days p.i.. but from 45 days p.i. no RNA reacted with the probe. The probe did not bind to RNA isolated from uninfected mice livers. Viral onripens. In frozen sections of liver, viral anogens could be detected by indirect immonofluorescence 24 h after inlraperitoneal infection of wl virus. Anltgens were prominent in the periportal areas and in sinusoidal cells. After 48 h. large amounts of viral antigens were localized in the hepatic parenchymal cells. The aotount of antigen increased steadily until the death of the animals (Fig. 3A  and B) . In mice infected with mtttant D85. viral antigens .._ E__i ____:__ could bc detcc:;: P: 3: :, p.i.; hj_i-ii, UIC ..,~a a.,...u,=d of limited sire for 5 days following infectioo (Fig. 3D ) and then decreased until the l&h day (Fig. 3E) . For up to 3 months p.i., antigens could s!ill be detected in a very few individual cells (Fig. 3F ). This suggests that liter acute hepatitis, Dg5 induced a pe;;ial;;at ir&ctioir
