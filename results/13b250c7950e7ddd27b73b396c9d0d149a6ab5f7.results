Two steps, the probe immobilisation and the blocking steps, in the design of the genosensor are very important. In the immobilisation step the presence of the thiol group in the probe and the effect of the evaporation during the immobilisation process has been studied. The favourable immobilisation of DNA through its thiol group is observed in Fig. 26 .2. Signals were obtained for unmodified DNA and SH-DNA (both biotinylated) following similar procedures. Although ssDNA adsorbs on gold substrates, it adopts a coiled configuration, and therefore cannot form an ordered structure [53] . An almost negligible adsorption of unmodified DNA is presented, that is very favoured by the insertion of a thiol group. Moreover same results were obtained when DNA immobilisation took place at 41C for 12 h or at 371C for 20 min. Moreover, the evaporation is a critical condition in the immobilisation of SH-DNA. This effect is shown in Fig. 26  Reprinted from Ref. [9] , Copyright 2005, with permission from Elsevier. evaporation occurred, which corresponds to 30, 15 and 10 min for room temperature, 37 and 471C, respectively. When the immobilisation took place at 41C overnight (12 h, attaining evaporation as well) the signal was similar to that obtained at 371C (27 vs. 29 mA, respectively). Therefore, both methodologies could be employed. The repeatability of the signals obtained for both immobilisation procedures was also similar, obtaining an RSD of 9% and 8% for five measurements when immobilisation was carried out at 371C for 20 min and 41C for 12 h, respectively. Considering five different gold films, precision was analogous, with an RSD of 10%. Despite the evaporation that favours DNA adsorption, this effect is the contrary to what occurred when the hybridisation step is carried out, where the evaporation diminishes the hybridisation signal. Blocking the surface is one of the most important steps to minimise and control non-specific adsorption. Two main types of agents were considered: proteins and sulphur-containing compounds. The signal/ background ratio (S/B), and therefore the blocking capacity, was observed for each compound. Among blocking agents assayed, better results were obtained with albumin and 1-hexanethiol. A comparison between the signals obtained for background and immobilised DNA (double labelled with biotin and thiol) when BSA and 1-hexanethiol were employed as blocking agents is shown in Fig. 26.4 . It can be observed that the background with albumin is negligible and the S/B ratio is high (22.4) , but the DNA signal is better defined for 1-hexanethiol where the capacitively current approaches zero. Moreover, when the Thick-and thin-film DNA sensors hybridisation step was carried out the S/B ratio obtained for albumin was much lower than that obtained with a double-labelled DNA strand. This is probably caused by the steric hindrance, due to the large size of albumin, which hinders hybridisation. Repeatability is checked under the experimental conditions explained in Procedure 36 in CD accompanying this book, 1 h of hybridisation and a 2 Â SSC buffer containing 50% of formamide. The value of the RSD was 11% for nine measurements. A complete study on the selectivity of DNA hybridisation has been carried out. It is of relevant interest in the study of SNP as well as for the study of virus mutation. After testing many stringency conditions, it was observed that carrying out the interaction between strands in a medium containing 50% of formamide during 1 h was enough for achieving a high degree of discrimination for all the mutated strands tested. Studies with mutated (base substitution) 30-mer synthetic oligonucleotides revealed differences for 3, 2 and 1 mismatched strands. The type of interaction that disappears and the possible new interactions that are generated when a base substitution occurs are of importance. One mismatch is detected even if it is located extreme far from the electrode, being the attenuation of the signal lower than when the substitution occurs near the electrode surface (Fig. 26.5) . Moreover,  Reprinted from Ref. [9] , Copyright 2005, with permission from Elsevier. mutations that involve deletions and insertions are differentiated from the fully complementary strand. However, although destabilisation of the duplex occurs, lower discrimination than with a substitution mutation is obtained. As a higher number of interactions is present, higher signals are obtained for the base insertion mutation. Hybridisation studies carried out between 30-mer strands were compared with those for 40-mer oligonucleotides. The length of the strand influences the hybridisation in such a way that higher signals are obtained and lower discrimination is achieved when the number of oligonucleotides increases. Experiences with crossed strands (immobilised 40-mer strand that hybridises with a 30-mer target and vice versa, hybrids between immobilised 30-mer strand and a 40-mer one) revealed the importance of an oligonucleotide tail in the immobilised strand for favouring the mobility and therefore the hybridisation. On the other hand, hybridisation is disfavoured when an immobilised strand has to react with another that contains a higher number of oligonucleotides in such a way that a rest near the electrode is present (30-40) (Fig. 26.6 ). Discrimination is seen over a wide interval of concentrations (Fig.  26.7) . Signals are linear for both complementary and one-base mismatched strands, between 0.01 and 1 nM. Detection limits of 5 and 70 pM were, respectively, obtained. determinants exclusively present in the genome of the pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. Orientation of the strands in the sensing phase is achieved by modifying the surface of the electrode with streptavidin by physical adsorption followed by the immobilisation of biotinylated oligo probes. The physical adsorption of streptavidin must be performed at a constant temperature above the room temperature. Moreover, the electrode surface must be previously electrochemically pretreated at an anodic potential in acidic medium to improve its adsorptive properties. In this way, reproducible, sensitive and stable sensing phases are obtained [54] . The biotinylated oligo nucleic acid probes used in this work target the pneumolysin (ply) gene. This target is randomly labelled with the Universal Linkage System (ULS s ). This labelling system consists of the use of a platinum (II) complex that acts as a coupling agent between DNA strands and a label molecule, usually fluorescent. This platinum complex is a monofunctional derivate of cisplatin (a potent anticancer agent used in the treatment of a variety of tumours) that binds to DNA at the N7 position of guanine with release of one Cl À ion per molecule of the complex. The label molecule used in this study was fluorescein (FITC). Electrochemical detection is achieved using two strategies. One of them is carried out using an anti-FITC alkaline phosphatase-labelled antibody and 3-indoxyl phosphate (3-IP) as enzymatic substrate of AP. The resulting enzymatic product is indigo blue, an aromatic heterocycle insoluble in aqueous solutions. Its sulfonation in acidic medium gives rise to IC, an aqueous soluble compound that shows an electrochemical behaviour similar to indigo blue. Both 3-IP and IC have already been studied on SPCEs [55, 56] . However, although these genosensors are stable and sensitive devices for the detection of specific nucleic acid fragments, the need of two additional steps to obtain the analytical signal resulted in a large timeconsuming analysis. This fact can be avoided using the second strategy for detection. In this case the analytical signal is directly obtained from platinum (II) complex, which is deposited on the electrode surface. In presence of the platinum on the electrode surface and after fixing an adequate potential in acidic medium, the protons are catalytically reduced to hydrogen. The current generated by this catalytic reduction can be measured and increases with platinum concentration and consequently with labelled target concentration. Data presented here demonstrate the potential applicability of SPCEs genosensors in the diagnosis of a human infectious pulmonary disease. These electrochemical genosensors are stable and sensitive devices for the detection of specific nucleic acid fragments. Moreover, these devices allow the detection of a one-base mismatch on the targets if adequate experimental conditions are used.  The experimental conditions used to modify the electrode surface with streptavidin by physical adsorption have been studied in detail in a previous work [54] , using biotin conjugated with alkaline phosphatase and 3-indoxyl phosphate (3-IP) as enzymatic substrate. The electrode surface must be pretreated by applying an anodic constant current (+3.0 mA) in 0.1 M H 2 SO 4 for 2 min to improve its adsorptive properties. The use of this electrochemical pretreatment resulted in an increase in the hydrophilicity of the transducer, allowing the adsorption of streptavidin through hydrophilic and electrostatic attraction. In order to avoid repeatability problems associated to the use of streptavidin, the adsorption of streptavidin on the electrode must be performed at 41C overnight. Doing this, repeatable signals are obtained and the streptavidin coated SPCEs are stable for months if they are stored at 41C. Moreover, the significance of the attachment of biotinylated oligonucleotide probes through the streptavidin/biotin interaction has been tested in a previous work [30] . When a double-labelled (biotin and fluorescein) poly-T was attached to the electrode surface through the streptavidin/biotin interaction, the peak currents were much higher than those obtained when it was accumulated on the electrode surface by physical adsorption. This fact means that streptavidin/biotin interaction allows to attach and orient the oligonucleotide strands on electrode surface, whereas the direct adsorption of the oligonucleotide on the electrode surface results in very poor manner. Using this method of immobilisation of the oligonucleotide probes, the genosensor devices are stable for a year if they are stored at 41C. The ply genosensor has been used for detecting oligonucleotide sequences containing a one-or three-base mismatch. Three different concentrations of complementary ply, plymism1 and plymism3 targets were assayed and three genosensors were used for each concentration. Figure 26 .9 displays the results obtained with both enzymatic and electrocatalytic detection. For the three concentrations assayed, the analytical signal obtained for the three-base mismatch oligonucleotide sequence is almost the background signal, indicating that threebase mismatch ply targets can be perfectly discriminated from the complementary ply target. For the one-base mismatch oligonucleotide sequence, the analytical signals obtained only decrease about 30% with respect to those obtained for the complementary target. In the optimised experimental conditions the ply genosensor has been tested for different concentrations of the complementary oligonucleotide target. In the case of the enzymatic detection, a linear relationship between peak current and concentrations of complementary ply target has been obtained between 0.1 and 5 pg/mL, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9993, according to the following equation: Thus, these genosensors can detect 0.1 pg/mL, which is 0.49 fmol of ply target in 30 mL. In the case of the electrocatalytic detection, a linear relationship between the recorded current and the logarithm of the concentration of ply target is obtained for concentrations between 5 and 100 pg/mL, according to the following equation: To improve the selectivity of the ply genosensor, more stringent experimental conditions are tested. A concentration of 25% formamide is added to the hybridisation buffer. It is well known that this molecule hampers the hybridisation reaction. In these more stringent conditions and using the enzymatic detection, a linear relationship between peak current and concentration of oligonucleotide target is obtained for concentrations between 0.25 and 5 pg/mL, according to the following equation: i p ðnAÞ ¼ 29 þ 175½ply ðpg=mLÞ; r ¼ 0:9992 ðn ¼ 5Þ Genosensors can detect about 1.2 fmols of complementary target in 30 mL in these more stringent experimental conditions. In the case of electrocatalytic detection, a linear relationship between the recorded current and the logarithm of the concentration of oligonucleotide target is obtained for concentrations between 50 and 1000 pg/mL, according to the following equation: As expected, the sensitivity decreases in these stringent experimental conditions for both enzymatic and electrocatalytic detection but the detection of one-base mismatch on an oligonucleotide sequence can be performed for any concentration assayed (Fig. 26.10) . Although the sensitivity of the electrocatalytic detection is 50-fold (under non-stringent conditions) and 200-fold (using 25% formamide in the hybridisation solution) lower than that obtained with the enzymatic detection, the analysis time is considerably shorter, because the analytical signal is achieved directly from the platinum complex whereas in the enzymatic detection two additional steps are necessary to obtain the analytical signal: the reaction with antibody anti-fluorescein and the enzymatic reaction. Thus, the overall analysis time of this chronoamperometric method is about the half than that resulting from the enzymatic method. When the PCR products are labelled using the FITC labelled 5 0 -primer the analytical signals are higher and more reproducible than those obtained using the ULS labelling kit. Moreover, the PCR blank is higher in the latter case (see Fig. 37 .2 of Procedure 37 in CD accompanying this book). For PCR products labelled using the FITC labelled 5 0 -primer, a linear relationship between the peak current and the logarithm of the number of copies of plasmid DNA is obtained between 2 Â 10 3 and 2 Â 10 5 copies of plasmid DNA, according to the following equation: i p ðnAÞ ¼ 204 log ðcopies plasmid DNAÞ À 354; r ¼ 0:9998; n ¼ 4 The limit of detection, calculated as the copies of plasmid DNA corresponding to a signal which is the PCR blank signal plus three times the standard deviation of the PCR blank signal, results to be 360 copies of plasmid DNA.
