One hundred seventy-five throat swab specimens positive for any influenza virus were tested to identify coinfection with other possible etiology of ARI. Influenza A virus was detected in 120 (68.6%) specimen, of which 25 ( In this study, influenza-positive children cases (n ï¿½ 175) were divided into three subgroups of age and the positive detection rate of respiratory pathogens, and results corresponding to less than 5 years, 6 to 10 years, and 10 to 12 years age groups are shown in Tables 2 and 3 . Coinfection with multiple respiratory pathogens in influenzapositive cases was predominant in those younger than five years of age followed by 6-10 and 10-12 years, respectively (Tables 2 and 3 ). e proportion of coinfections with rhinovirus 10 (5.7%), respiratory syncytial virus A/B 8 (4.6%), adenovirus 9 (5.1%), and CoV-HKU1 7 (4.0%) viruses was more common in less than five-year-old children with influenza A compared to influenza B-positive cases. Similarly, the rate of coinfections with rhinovirus 6 (3.4%), respiratory syncytial virus A/B 4 (2.3%), adenovirus 3 (1.7%), and CoV-HKU1 2 virus (1.1%) was comparatively found lower among 6-10 year-old children with influenza A and influenza B, respectively (Tables 2 and 3) . Similarly, 38 (21.7%) influenza-positive specimens had been coinfected with two respiratory pathogens; 21 (12.0%) specimens contained three respiratory viruses and 9 (5.2%) specimens contained coinfections of four respiratory pathogens (Table 4 ). e positive detection rate of influenza A was predominantly found in the month of October 2015 to January 2016. Similarly, influenza B infectivity was found peak in the month of Monoinfection of influenza A/H1N1 pdm09, influenza A/H3, and influenza B was 10.3, 29.1 and 21.7%, respectively. Coinfection of influenza A and B with other single pathogen was found in 21.7% cases, double pathogen was found in 12% cases, and three or more pathogens were found in 17.2% cases (Table 4) .
