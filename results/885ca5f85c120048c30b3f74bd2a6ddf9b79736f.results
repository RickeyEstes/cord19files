During the 4 years of the study, of the 592 children (311 boys; mean age ± SD 3AE2 ± 3AE0 years) with radiographically confirmed CAP, 435 (73AE5%) were positive for at least one virus. Viruses were detected in 120 ⁄ 132 children aged <1 year (90AE9%), 235 ⁄ 293 aged 1-3 years (80AE2%), and 89 ⁄ 167 aged ‡4 years (47AE9%; P < 0AE05 versus the <1 year and 1-3 year age groups). Nine children (all negative for respiratory viruses) had positive blood cultures (six for Streptococcus pneumoniae, two for Staphylococcus aureus, and one for non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae). As a preliminary analysis of the prevalence of respiratory viruses showed that there were no statistically significant differences by year of sample collection, all of the data collected in the 4 years were considered together. Table 1 shows the viral findings by age group and the presence of viral-viral co-infections. The most frequently detected virus was RSV, which was found in 188 children (31AE7%), followed by rhinovirus (n = 144, 24AE3%), bocavirus (n = 60, 10AE1%), influenza viruses (n = 57, 9AE6%: six seasonal A ⁄ H1N1, 17 A ⁄ H3N2, eight B, and 26 pandemic A ⁄ H1N1), hMPV (n = 49, 8AE2%), coronaviruses (n = 33, 5AE6%: 20 OC43, five 229E, five NL63, and three HKU1), enterovirus (n = 21, 3AE5%), adenovirus (n = 11, 1AE8%), and parainfluenza viruses (n = 11, 1AE8%: seven parainfluenza-4, one parainfluenza-1, one parainfluenza-2, and one parainfluenza-3). Among the children aged 4-14 years, rhinovirus was the most common cause of infection. All of the studied viruses were found as isolated agents and in co-infections. The incidence of co-infections decreased with age and was significantly lower in the children aged 4-14 years (10 ⁄ 80, 12AE5%) than in those aged <1 year (42 ⁄ 120, 35AE0%; P < 0AE05) or 1-3 years (65 ⁄ 235, 27AE7%; P < 0AE05). The virus causing the highest percentage of co-infections involved coronavirus, which was found together with other viruses in 26 ⁄ 33 children (78AE8%), followed by bocavirus (45 ⁄ 60, 75%), parainfluenza viruses (6 ⁄ 11, 54AE5%), adenovirus (6 ⁄ 11, 54AE5%), enterovirus (11 ⁄ 21, 52AE3%), rhinovirus (66 ⁄ 144, 45AE8%), RSV (76 ⁄ 188, 40AE4%), hMPV (11 ⁄ 49, 22AE4%), and influenza viruses (9 ⁄ 57, 15AE8%). Table 2 summarizes the viral co-infections found in 117 children (19AE7% of the enrolled children and 26AE9% of those with viral infections): 96 were infected by two, 20 by three, and one by four viruses. The most common co-infections were those involving RSV and rhinovirus (32 cases, 27AE3%), rhinovirus and bocavirus (11 cases, 9AE4%), RSV and coronavirus (11 cases, 9AE4%), and RSV and bocavirus (10 cases, 8AE5%). Table 3 describes the characteristics of the CAP associated with single viral infections. In order to be able to evaluate sufficiently substantial numbers, we only compared the single infections detected in at least 15 cases. Analysis of the differences between infections owing to RSV, rhinovirus, influenza, hMPV, and bocavirus showed that the mean age of the children with RSV-positive CAP was significantly lower than that of those with rhinovirus-or influenzapositive CAP (P < 0AE05); high-grade fever ( ‡39°C) was significantly more frequent among the children with hMPVpositive CAP than among those with rhinovirus-positive CAP (P < 0AE05); and rales were significantly more frequent among the children with RSV-, hMPV-, and bocavirus-positive CAP than among those with rhinovirus-positive CAP (P < 0AE05). Influenza-positive CAP cases showed similar diseases among family members significantly more often than the rhinovirus-and bocavirus-positive cases (P < 0AE05). There were no other between-group differences in terms of clinical presentation or outcomes. Among the laboratory parameters, CRP levels were significantly higher in the rhinovirus-positive cases than in the RSV-and influenza-positive cases (P < 0AE05); there were no differences in white blood cell counts. In relation to the radiographic findings, alveolar pneumonia was significantly more frequent in the rhinoviruspositive cases than in the influenza-and hMPV-positive cases (P < 0AE05). Multivariate analysis showed that the rhinovirus-positive cases were significantly less frequently associated with fever (OR 0AE37, 95% CI 0AE21-0AE63), rales (OR 0AE37, 95% CI 0AE21-0AE63), or a similar illness among family members (OR 0AE37, 95% CI 0AE19-0AE72) than rhinovirus-negative cases. On the contrary, hMPV-positive cases were significantly more frequently associated with fever (OR 3AE11, 95% CI 1AE24-7AE80) than hMPV-negative cases, and influenza-positive cases were significantly more frequently associated with a similar illness among family members (OR 3AE24, 95% CI 1AE70-6AE20) and significantly less frequently associated with alveolar pneumonia (OR 0AE38, 95% CI 0AE18-0AE80) than influenza-negative cases. Table 4 shows the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic variables associated with the single viral infections and co-infections. The only significant differences were mean age (which was significantly higher in the children with a single viral infection than in those with coinfections) (P < 0AE001), and the radiographic finding of alveolar pneumonia, which was significantly more frequent in the children with co-infections (P < 0AE05). Multivariate analysis showed that the only significant association was the significantly more frequent radiographic evidence of alveolar pneumonia in the children with co-infections than in those with single infections (OR 1AE72, 95% CI 1AE05-2AE81).
