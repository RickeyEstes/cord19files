A total of 418 hospitals participated in the study (response rate 40.2%). Hospitals that did not meet inclusion criteria were dropped from the statistical analysis, resulting in final respective samples sizes of 252 (24.3%) and 215 (20.7%) for patient safety and infection control. No significant relationships were noted between response rates and hospital demographic information including geographic location (P = 0.24, χ 2 -test) and bed size (P = 0.94, χ 2 -test). A median rather than a mean was taken for the analysis because the distribution of activities was skewed to low figures. The wage-adjusted median person-time per month devoted to patient safety (27.6 person-hours per 100-beds) was higher than that for infection control (19.3 person-hours per 100-beds). Person-time values for each independent variable are presented in Table 2 . Models were created to describe the relationship between the structural hospital characteristics captured by the independent variables, and the person-time values for both patient safety and infection control. No variables were found to be multi-collinear. Table 3 describes the predictive value of each independent variable on person-time values per 100-beds for patient safety and infection control. The relationships between person-time values per 100-beds and the independent variables of hos-pital ownership and location were mixed. The university-associated ownership structure was positively correlated with person-time values in the patient safety model, but showed no association with persontime values in the infection control model. Conversely, location was a positive predictor of person-time val- Note. The dependent variables were volume of patient safety activities and one of infection control activities, in person-hours/(100-beds month).

Smaller hospital size was significantly related to increased person-time values per 100-beds for both patient safety and infection control (P < 0.05), that is, smaller hospital tend to shoulder a higher burden compared to larger hospitals. Hospitals with lower profit margins had fewer patient safety person-time values than those more profitable (P < 0.01). There was no significant relationship between person-time values and the infrastructural variable of facility for infection control status. In hospitals with dedicated full-time staffing for patient safety or infection control, person-time values per 100-beds for both patient safety and infection control significantly increased by over 30% (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). Hospitals with higher nurse-topatient ratios also had significantly higher person-time values for infection control (P < 0.01). Nurse-to-patient ratios were not significant in the patient safety model, though the point estimates tended toward increased person-time values. Clear roles for the patient safety and infection control divisions answered by patient safety managers and infection control practitioners had no correlation to person-time values, and perceived empowerment of each division was similarly unrelated. Staff perception regarding hospital administration leadership in implementing patient safety and infection control activities, however, was significantly linked to increased persontime values (P < 0.05).
