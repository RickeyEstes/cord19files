A total of 40 staff participated in one of five focus groups. The number of participants per group ranged from 3-12. All participants were female and the median age was 35 years (range 20-60 years). Eighty-three percent of the participants had an ECE Diploma (college), and 15 % had a University degree. The median number of years working in a child care centre was 11 (range 2-30 years). The centres represented a variety of settings from large, public centres with multiple classes for infants, toddlers, preschool and school-aged children to smaller centres which only had two rooms. The centres also differed on geographic location and the type of population they served. Five major themes emerged from the data. The following is a description of the themes and text based examples to illustrate them.
