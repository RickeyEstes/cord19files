We initially calculated the prediction accuracies of the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm based on the alignment method and the alignment-free distance/dissimilarity measures for k-mer length from 3 to 6 and the number of neighbors K from 1 to 10. The results for the rabies virus, coronavirus, and influenza A virus datasets are given as Figs S1, S2 and S3 in the supplementary material, respectively. These figures show that except for the Chebyshev divergence, all the other alignment-free distance/dissimilarity measures have similar prediction accuracy, very close to that of the alignment-based distance measure. The prediction accuracy is not markedly affected by the length of k-mers from 3 to 6. For clarity of presentation in the remaining of the paper, we let the k-mer size to be 6. Based on the sample size and distribution for each dataset, we choose K = 1 as the number of neighbors in KNN for the rabies virus dataset, and K = 7 for the coronavirus dataset and influenza A virus dataset. For alignment-free distance measures, we use Manhattan distance as an representative as many of them have similar prediction accuracies. Figure 1 shows the multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots of the 148 rabies viruses with complete Nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences based on the Manhattan distance using 6-mers (left) and alignment (right). In addition, Figs 2 and 3 show the hierarchical clustering of the viruses using alignment-based distance and Manhattan distances using 6-mers, respectively. The clustering results using the alignment-based method and the Manhattan distance are highly similar indicating that the alignment and alignment-free based methods give roughly similar results. Figure 4 shows the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) prediction accuracies of one nearest neighbor using alignment-based distance and Manhattan distance with 6-mers, and SVM for different sample sizes. It can be seen from the figure that the average prediction accuracies for the alignment based method and the Manhattan distance based method are similar. However, the prediction accuracies for the alignment-based method have an relatively larger variance than that for the Manhattan distance based method for almost all the sample sizes considered. On the other hand, the average prediction accuracies for the SVM based method are lower than that for both the alignment and Manhattan distance based methods.
