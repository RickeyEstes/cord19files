In this study, we examined the effect of statins on the structure and function of CD147 in the monocytic cell line model THP-1, which can be differentiated in vitro by treatment with PMA [11, 34] . We used two approaches to further elucidate the pathways responsible for these effects: (i) rescue experiments (add-on approach) in which the processes inhibited by statins (i.e., isoprenylation and N-linked glycosylation involving mevalonate-derivative products) were selectively restored at key steps; and (ii) inhibition experiments, where the statin-induced effects were mimicked using known inhibitors of isoprenylation and N-linked glycosylation (Fig 1) . To this end, in all experimental setups, the following scenarios were investigated: 1. non-differentiated THP-1 cells were compared to differentiated cells; 2. the effects of statins on differentiated THP-1 cells were assessed; 3. rescue experiments were performed to reverse statin effects at different key steps of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway; 4. the effects of statins were compared to those of inhibitors of processes downstream of HMG-CoA reductase. Statin treatment alters the morphology of PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells In culture, na√Øve THP-1 cells are round and non-adherent (Fig 2A) . Differentiation of THP-1 cells with PMA resulted in a change in morphology, with cells becoming flat, elongated, amoeboid and adherent ( Fig 2B) . In contrast, treatment with various statins (pravastatin, atorvastatin, and fluvastatin) followed by differentiation with PMA resulted in a cellular morphology similar to that of undifferentiated THP-1 cells; pravastatin treatment also resulted in the formation of bunched clusters of cells (Fig 2C-2E ). Next, rescue experiments were performed to reverse the effects of statins. Treatment with mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase, reversed the effect of fluvastatin and resulted in a differentiated cellular morphology ( Fig 2F) . Addition of downstream intermediates (FPP, GGPP, and dolichol) also reversed the effects of fluvastatin (although to decreasing degrees with dolichol exhibiting the weakest effects) and induced a differentiated cellular morphology (Fig 2G-2I ). Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, prevented differentiation of THP-1 cells in a similar manner to statins ( Fig 2J) . FTI-277 and GGTI-298, which inhibit isoprenylation, were partially able to prevent differentiation of THP-1 cells (Fig 2K and 2L ). Statin treatment inhibits expression of CD147 and CD14 on PMAdifferentiated THP-1 cells Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the surface expression of CD147 was upregulated in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells (Fig 3A) . Treatment of cells with pravastatin, atorvastatin or fluvastatin resulted in CD147 downregulation ( Fig 3B) . Rescue experiments revealed that treatment with dolichol ( Fig 3C) or FPP (Fig 3D) rescued the expression of CD147, whereas GGPP treatment only partially rescued CD147 expression ( Fig 3E) . In the inhibitor experiments, tunicamycin treatment induced the most potent inhibition of CD147 expression, followed by FTI-277 and GGTI-298 (Fig 3F) , indicating that farnesylation may be the dominant pathway regulating the expression of CD147. Expression of the monocytic differentiation antigen CD14 is regulated in a manner similar to that of CD147; we therefore monitored the expression of CD14 along with CD147. PMAmediated differentiation was accompanied by increased CD14 expression (Fig 4A) that was inhibited by treatment with any of the three statins ( Fig 4B) . Rescue experiments confirmed that dolichol ( Fig 4C) and FPP (Fig 4D) almost completely rescued the differentiation of THP-1 cells, whereas GGPP failed to do so (Fig 4E) . In the inhibition experiments, the inhibitors tested had similar effects on CD14 and CD147 expression (Fig 4F) . To assess if the downregulation of CD147 cell surface expression is caused by a decrease in overall protein levels or in membrane translocation, we next measured the expression of CD147 in permeabilized cells (which represents the total cellular level of CD147) and compared it to CD147 cell surface expression in non-permeabilized cells. These results demonstrate that in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells, most of the CD147 molecules were expressed on the cell surface ( Fig 5A) , but that fluvastatin induced intracellular retention of CD147 ( Fig  5B) that was reversed upon FPP treatment (Fig 5C) . This effect of fluvastatin was mimicked by tunicamycin treatment (Fig 5D) .
