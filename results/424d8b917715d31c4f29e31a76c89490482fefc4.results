In New Zealand, no general notification forms are used, but five disease-specific notification forms were obtained ( Table 1) . From Australian States and Territories, either national disease-specific templates (SoNGs) (measles, hepatitis A and dengue) or State-specific forms were collected from seven of the eight jurisdictions (the authors were unable to obtain surveillance forms for South Australia), and in total, 24 different forms were identified from this country ( Table 1) . From England, available forms consisted of a national general notification form and national disease-specific notification forms for HAV, malaria and typhoid (to be completed in addition to the general notification form). In Canada, no national notification form is used, and like Australia, surveillance is coordinated predominately at a Province or Territory level. Measles was the only disease investigated for which a national disease-specific notification form is used. In neither country is dengue fever a notifiable disease (Table 1) . Table 2 shows the specific details regarding the travelrelated information collected. Although most forms requested information on overseas travel, only the Northern Territory collected this information for all diseases, whilst Western Australia collected overseas travel data for malaria, and England for malaria and typhoid. Reason for travel was not routinely collected in New Zealand, nor any of the Australian jurisdictions. Not all forms required collection of vaccination history for the three vaccine preventable diseases. Several forms requested verification through health records and/or batch number of the vaccine where relevant. The use of malaria chemoprophylaxis was usually requested, but only the New Zealand and Victorian forms collected details of mosquito avoidance measures used. Demographic information collected is summarised in Table 3 . The majority of notification forms requested information on the postcode of residence, country of birth and English language proficiency of the case. In Australia, details of ethnicity were limited to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status, although the Western Australian notification forms had an option for "other" ethnicity. In Yes Z information is collected on general surveillance forms. Yes* Z information is not requested on general surveillance forms but is on all disease-specific surveillance forms. Yes* with names of diseases Z information is not requested on general surveillance forms but is requested on disease-specific surveillance forms for these diseases. a Only information from the general surveillance form was available. b General notification forms are not used in Tasmania nor New Zealand. c Dengue is not a notifiable disease in Canada nor the UK. New Zealand and England, the option for multiple ethnicity categories was available, which could be matched to the ethnicity categories used in the national census. Whilst nearly all notification forms included details of the patient's address, it was often unclear from the wording if a permanent or temporary address was being requested. The UK's malaria notification form overcame this potential confusion by including specific options in the reason for travel section of the form, and provides options for "foreign visitor from abroad", "new entrant to the UK" and "UK citizen living abroad". Disease-specific information collected is summarised in Table 4 . Information on whether a patient had been hospitalised was collected on all forms, and all except the Canadian form required data on whether the patient had died. However, the date the patient started treatment was not collected by most Australian jurisdictions and only on the malaria notification form in the UK.
