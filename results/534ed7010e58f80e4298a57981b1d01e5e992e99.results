To identify genome regions for reliable phylogenetic analysis comparable to that of full-length genome, (near) full-length MERS-CoV genomes (Table 1) were aligned. Viral genomes that were 99.9% identical were grouped and one viral genome from each group was taken as representative in the analysis (Table 1 ) and a PhyML tree was generated (Fig. 1A) . was plotted over 1000 nt windows (Fig. 1B) . Four genome fragments, two located in ORF1a, one in S and one in ORF4b, showed a relatively high number of SNPs (Fig. 1B) and for this reason already had been used as concatenated genome fragment for phylogenetic analysis [12] . However, phylogenetic trees created for these four fragments separately did not accurately reflect the phylogenetic positions of the currently known full-length MERS-CoV genomes (data not shown). In a subsequent analysis all identified SNPs were inspected visually and regions containing SNPs with phylogenetic information regarding the previously identified four clusters of viruses were identified (Fig. 1A) . The S2 domain of the spike protein contains a number of these mutations (Fig. 1B) . A fragment of 615 bp, containing three of these SNPs, provided a phylogenetic tree similar to the one obtained upon full-genome analysis regarding the previously identified four MERS-CoV clusters (Fig. 2) , whereas other MERS-CoV genome regions did not provide similar results. As observed for the full-length genomes, human, and camel MERS-CoV genomes shared >99% nucleotide identity across the 615 bp S2 domain fragment. MERS-CoV genomes that were released recently and not taken along in the variation analysis were typed using the 615 bp S2 domain and clustered similar to their phylogenetic positions as upon full genome analysis ( Fig. 2 and Table 1 ), thereby validating the assay. A sequencing RT-PCR targeting the identified genome fragment was developed and optimized using RNA isolated from cell culturederived MERS-CoV. In limiting dilution experiments, the MERS-CoV variant typing assay amplified the 615 bp fragment down to a cycle treshold value of âˆ¼35 as determined by diagnostic upE real time PCR assays [17, 18] . The MERS-CoV variant typing assay was used to type RT-PCR positive nose swabs from the first two human Dutch MERS-CoV cases in 2014. The results showed grouping consistent with previous findings based on long sequence fragments [19] (Fig. 2 ). In addition, the MERS-CoV variant typing assay was performed on camel samples from a slaughterhouse in Qatar [13] and sequences for 14 MERS-CoV positive animals with cycle threshold values ranging from 12.9 to 32.2 as determined by UpE real time RT-PCR [17, 18] were obtained (Fig. 2) . Five different camel MERS-CoV variants in clusters B1 and B2 were detected, without the need for full genome sequencing.
