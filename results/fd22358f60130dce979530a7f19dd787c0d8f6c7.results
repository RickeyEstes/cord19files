MF cells were revived from liquid nitrogen storage at various passage levels. We examined A(+) RNA, prepared from these cells, by the technique of Southern blotting using nick-translated plasmids containing M protein mRNA sequences (14) . A messenger RNA molecule carrying matrix protein sequences was found to be present in one of these cultures (passage 60: figure 1A , track 1) and it was of similar size to that observed in a productive Edmonston virus infection (track 2). We have described another SSPE cell line (N-l) in which M protein mRNA was readily detectable but not utilized correctly in translation reactions, thus it was possible that the mRNA detected in MF cells might not function in protein synthesis. We therefore used the A(+) RNA fraction analysed in Figure 1A , in an in vitro translation reaction. The virus-specific products 5T this reaction were identified by immune precipitation and separated on an SDS Polyacrylamide gel (figure IB). Polyadenylated RNA extracted from a productive measles virus infection was used as a positive control , and from uninfected Vero cells as a negative control. M protein was detected among the translation products of both MFand Edmonston virus-infected cell mRNAs. Thus we conclude that this mRNA was functional in vitro. The lesion in M protein production within SSPE patient brain is known to be to some extent host-controlled since cell-fusion or co-cultivation experiments have resulted in the expression of this protein (7) . A host-controlled defect in translation has been postulated in a laboratory-produced SSPE virus persistent infection, since matrix protein produced by in vitro translation could not be detected within the persistently infected cells (5) . We therefore prepared 35-S methionine labelled extracts from these early passage cells and from uninfected Vero cells and examined them for the presence of matrix protein by immune precipitation (figure 2). Serum and CSF are still available from the patient from whom the MF cell line was originally derived, and these were used in conjunction with rabbit hyperimmune anti-measles virus serum, and a monoclonal antibody specific for measles virus matrix protein. Rabbit preimmune serum and a monoclonal antibody directed against corona virus antigen provided negative controls. Matrix protein was produced by the MF cell line and was immunoprecipitated by both the hyperimmune rabbit and human sera. It was not however detected using the monoclonal antibody, or the human CSF. The failure of CSF to immunoprecipitate this peptide was expected since the MF patient suffered from clinically normal SSPE, and antibodies to this protein are lacking in the CSF. We therefore concluded that in this culture of SSPE MF the production of mature functional mRNA for matrix protein led to the successful expression of M protein. In other cultures this protein was not detectable presumably due to the lesion in the production of the corresponding mRNA previously reported (10) .
