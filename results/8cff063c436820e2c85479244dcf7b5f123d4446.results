We apply the Accumulated Natural Vector method on five datasets, and compare the results with common methods, such as MSA, k-mer (FFP) and the traditional Natural Vector method. From comparison, the results of Accumulated Natural Vector are more accurate and the calculation cost is very small compared to others. A dataset of 351 viruses has also been tested, and laptop cannot bear such a heavy burden of calculation of aligning them but alignment-free can still be done in a reasonable time. We also use a server to align segments of 351 sequences, to compare the results to ANV and other methods. ANV also gives the best performance on this dataset. Besides, we simulate another dataset of 20 sequences from a randomly generated sequence with length of 1,000bp, and test the phylogenetic trees from this and other methods. We have chosen those datasets of different sizes (number of sequences, and lengths of sequences), which to test if ANV can be suitable in all cases. Most datasets have been analyzed by previous researches, therefore we can compare our results to others to evaluate the performances. Four datasets consist of viruses that are closely related to human health, and the mammal's dataset and simulated dataset show that this method can perform on other types of sequences as well.
