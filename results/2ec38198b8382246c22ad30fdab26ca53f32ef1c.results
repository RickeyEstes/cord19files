The aim of this research is to know the methods used by researchers to predict the behavior of social media users. In this research, data were collected based on the use of three different social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. A random user list was used to analyze the behavior. In our final analysis, we pooled the data, which showed a statistically significant difference in various parameters (published year, methods, results, and limitations) for different social media sites. The results section includes the percentage of research on the three social networking sites, research papers according to year with bar graph representations, data collection and behavior analysis methods and classification based on the different methods with line graph representations.
