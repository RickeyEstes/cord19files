Method optimization to increase the proportion of viral reads derived from throat swabs. Our method protocol is shown in Fig. 1A . We first sequenced five influenza A virus-positive and five influenza virus-negative throat swabs, each spiked with Hazara virus control at 10 4 genome copies/ml. Using a sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) approach (20), followed by Nanopore sequencing, we produced metagenomic data dominated by reads that were bacterial in origin, with extremely few viral reads detected. Passing the sample through a 0.4-m filter prior to nucleic acid extraction increased the detection of viral reads by several orders of magnitude (Fig. S1 ). Filtration is relatively expensive, so we also assessed the alternative approach of adding a rapid-centrifugation step to pellet bacterial and human cells, followed by nucleic acid extraction from the supernatant. We used a pooled set of influenza A virus-positive samples (concentration, 10 6 genome copies/ml) to provide a large enough sample to assess reproducibility, with the Hazara virus control spiked in at 10 4 genome copies/ml. Enrichment for influenza virus and Hazara virus was similar for filtration versus centrifugation, based on read mapping to the viral genome (Fig. S2 ). As centrifugation is simpler and less expensive, we selected this approach for all further testing. Method optimization to reduce time for cDNA synthesis. Synthesis of tagged randomly primed cDNA and its subsequent amplification via SISPA (20) required lengthy reverse transcription and PCR steps (1 h and 3 h 45 min), respectively. Optimizing these stages upgraded the reverse transcriptase from SuperScript III to SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher), reduced the incubation time to 10 min (processing time reduction, 50 min), and reduced the PCR extension time within each cycle from 5 min to 2 min (1 h 30 min processing time reduction). Comparing this final method with our original protocol, using triplicate extractions from the pooled set of influenza A virus-positive samples demonstrated no significant loss in performance in the more rapid protocol (Fig. S3) , and we adopted this approach as our routine protocol, giving a wet-lab processing time of ϳ8 h. Consistent retrieval of Hazara virus by Nanopore sequencing. Starting with an influenza A virus-positive sample pool (10 6 genome copies/ml), we made three volumetric dilution series using three independent influenza virus-negative pools (Fig. 1B) . The total quantity of cDNA after preparation for sequencing was consistently higher in all samples using negative pool 3 as the diluent ( Fig. 2A) , indicating the presence of a higher concentration of nonviral RNA within pool 3. This is likely due to host cell lysis or higher bacterial presence and demonstrates the variable nature of throat swab samples. We consistently retrieved Hazara virus reads from all three dilution series by Nanopore sequencing, independently of influenza virus titer in the sample (Fig. 2B) . Sequencing from dilution series 1 and 2 gave a consistent proportion of total reads mapping to the Hazara virus genome, across dilutions and between the first two pools, with mean Ϯ standard deviation values per pool of 1.4 ϫ 10 3 Ϯ 660 reads per million (RPM) of total reads and 1.2 ϫ 10 3 Ϯ 350 RPM, respectively. The pool 3 dilution series generated 260 Ϯ 340 RPM Hazara virus reads across samples and showed a decreasing trend associated with increased dilution factor as increasingly more nonviral RNA was introduced from this high-background pool. Limit of influenza virus detection by Nanopore sequencing from pooled samples. Nanopore sequencing of the triplicate SISPA preparations of the influenza A virus-positive pool produced mean Ϯ standard deviation of 5.3 ϫ 10 4 Ϯ 3.6 ϫ 10 4 RPM mapping to the influenza A virus genome (Fig. 2B) . Across the dilution series, the proportion of influenza virus reads was strongly associated with influenza virus titer (P value ϭ 4.7 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 ) but was also influenced by which negative pool was used for dilution, consistent with the pattern observed for the Hazara virus control. Sequencing the negative controls (pools with no influenza virus spike) generated no reads mapping to influenza virus. At influenza virus titers of Ͻ10 3 copies/ml, influenza virus reads were inconsistently detected across the samples (Fig. 2B) , suggesting that the limit of detection is between 10 2 and 10 3 influenza virus copies/ml. Retrieval and reconstruction of complete influenza virus genomes from pooled/spiked samples. For the Hazara virus control (10 4 genome copies/ml spike), genome coverage was 81.4 to 99.4% (at 1ϫ depth) for pools 1 and 2. Coverage in the high-background pool 3 was more varied (21.5 to 96.5%; Fig. 3A ). Influenza A virus genome coverage at 10 6 copies/ml was Ն99.3% for each segment in all samples (Fig.  3A) . At 10 4 genome copies/ml of influenza virus, a mean 1ϫ coverage per segment was 90.3% for pools 1 and 2 but was substantially reduced in the high-background pool 3 to 5.7% (Fig. 3A) . At influenza virus titers of Ͻ10 4 copies/ml, coverage was highly varied across genome segments. However, when present at 10 3 copies/ml, 2/3 pools had sufficient data for correct subtyping as H3N2 (Table 1) .
