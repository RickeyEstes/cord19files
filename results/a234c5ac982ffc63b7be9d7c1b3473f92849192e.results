Serum IL-6 Levels Associate Strongly with Disease Severity in Patients Hospitalized with H1N1pdm Infection Increased IL-6 expression has been reported following seasonal influenza infection, as well as in severe cases of H1N1pdm infection [22] [23] [24] [25] . We investigated IL-6 expression in humans hospitalized with H1N1pdm infection and further analyzed patient outcome with clinical signs. A total of 45 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed H1N1pdm infection were included in our analysis. Serum samples were collected within 48 hours of hospital admission and IL-6 protein concentrations were measured. IL-6 concentrations were found to be significantly higher in patients who required critical care support (n = 35) compared to patients who did not (n = 10) ( Figure 1A) . Also, IL-6 concentrations were higher in patients who died (n = 10) compared to survivors (n = 35), although differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.065) ( Figure 1B ). Binary logistic regression (BLR) analysis demonstrated that levels of IL-6 (log 10 IL-6 (pg/mL)) adjusted by age and sex were significantly associated with increased risk of fatal outcome [Odds Ratio (95% Confidence Interval); p-value]: [2.63 (1.06-6.49); 0.036]. Taken together, these results revealed a strong association of IL-6 patient concentration to disease severity in people hospitalized with H1N1pdm infection.
