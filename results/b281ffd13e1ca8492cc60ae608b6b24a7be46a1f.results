Three additional real data sets, together with the fibroblast to serum gene expression data, are analyzed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The first one is the annotated subset cell cycle data from [16] ; the second is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) studied in [17] ; the transition metal study in [18] is the final example. The same eight sorting algorithms (SVD with one eigenvector (SVD1), SVD with two eigenvectors (SVD2), self-organizing maps (SOM) [19] , rank-two ellipse (R2E), HCT with random flips (HCT_RAM), optimal tree (HCT_OPT), SOM-guided tree (HCT_SOM), and R2E-guided tree (HCT_R2E)) are tested for all data sets. We only summarize the results of two HCT and two non-HCT algorithms: SVD2, R2E, HCT_OPT, and HCT_R2E. (Please see Additional file 1 for detailed comparison of all eight sorting algorithms.) The GAR curves (window-size ranges from 1 to 516) for the four sorting algorithms plotted in Figure 3a produce the following observations: • the R2E (smooth green line) clearly outperforms (lowest GAR scores) the other three methods ; • the HCT_OPT algorithm has poor global (large windowsize) performance; • the proposed HCT_R2E method outperforms HCT_OPT, and is nearly as good as the SVD2 algorithm in the global sense. We plot in Figure 3b the relative generalized anti-Robinson (RGAR) loss scores for better comparison of local behaviours among the four methods, to observe the following: • both HCT algorithms (curves with dots) outperform two non-HCT (smooth curves) in small window-size area (1 Ϲ w Ϲ 50); • the optimal hierarchical clustering tree, HCT_OPT, has the best performance among the four HCTs for the smallest window-size area (1 Ϲ w Ϲ 35); • the proposed HCT_R2E method actually scores best for a small period in the middle range (35 Ϲ w Ϲ 75); • the R2E algorithm dominates the competition from w = 100 on. Without the visualization of two smooth transitional patterns for up-and down-regulated genes in Figure 1b , HCT in Figure 1a suggests many gene-clusters with very coherent expression profiles, but with no knowledge of the possible embedded smooth transitional patterns. The proposed HCT_R2E method automatically integrates the coherent local property of HCT and the smooth global trend of R2E to provide users the improved Figure 1c . The visualization of the expression profile and the correlation matrices in Figure 1c provide users exploration for local behaviour of genes function closely together in small time scale and for more complicate global relationship with larger time interval simultaneously in such a time series expression experiment. Generalized anti-Robinson (GAR) loss scores for Fibroblast to serum data [1]  In addition to lower intermediate to global GAR and RGAR loss scores (see Additional file 1 for details), the permutation identified by the proposed HCT_R2E method also possesses more meaningful biological implications than the other algorithms. The cell cycle phase diagrams for the three seriation algorithms (SVD2, HCT_OPT, and HCT_R2E) are shown in Figure 4 , where the identical inner circle represents the 145 genes sorted with the known cell cycle phase information. The outer circle for each algorithm is rotated to its best position among all 145 possible rotations according to the following criteria: the simple match score computes the proportion of correct (against known phase information) matches for all 145 gene positions, ranging from 0 (worst) to 1 (best); the weighted match score assigns weights of (2, 1, 0) to genes that deviate from the known phase by (0, 1, 2) phase groups, and is also scaled to 0 (worst) to 1 (best); the total deviation score sums the deviations (by number of genes) of all 145 genes to the boundaries of their known phases. Both the simple match and weighted match are gain scores (the higher the better) while the total deviation is a loss score (the lower the better). From Table 1 we see that the proposed HCT_R2E algorithm outperforms the other seven algorithms in all three matching scores. Through visualization, the cell cycle diagrams sorted by the three algorithms can be roughly separated into three classes: • SVD2 performed rather poorly; • HCT_OPT permutation showed better correlation to the known phases than SVD2; • HCT_R2E arranged the 145 genes at positions very close to their annotated phase positions. Although the HCT_R2E algorithm aligned the 145 genes close to their known phases, several genes deviated far away from their annotated cell cycle phases, as can be seen from the cell cycle diagram in Figure 4c . We further examined the phase annotations provided by another yeast cell cycle study of Spellman et al. [21] ; the cross-annotated phase labels for both studies are listed in Additional file 2. Cell cycle phase diagrams for Yeast cell cycle data [16] The 15 genes with largest deviations from their annotated phase groups sorted by the proposed HCT_R2E algorithm are bold-faced. From the corresponding annotated phases of [21] , in the last column, we see that the Spellman et al. [21] annotated phases for these 15 genes either fit better into the overall cell cycle pattern (e.g., YKL067W from S to G1, and YEL017W from early G1 to S/G2), or their phase conditions are not annotated (7 out of 15). This result further implies the proposed algorithm can be applied to either verify known biological conditions or to explore unknown phenomena. The same eight algorithms are used to sort the Euclidean distance matrices for the 55 samples but only results of the three methods, HCT_OPT, R2E, and HCT_R2E are displayed. The corresponding expression profile matrices with related HCT dendrograms and the sorted colour bands for sample identities are displayed in Figure 5 . We observe the following: • there is a clear uni-dimensional Robinson pattern for this SARS Euclidean matrix; • the HCT_OPT (Figure 5a ) algorithm presented rather coherent local structure; • R2E ( Figure 5b ) sorted samples identify colour bands that exhibit a clear blue (NC) to yellow (RS) to red (AS) severity structure of the disease; • the Euclidean matrix sorted by the proposed HCT_R2E (Figure 5c ) method displays very coherent local relationships, as well as extremely good global structure. Its identity colour band has a coherent within sample-subtype pattern We have summarized the numerical comparisons (GAR, RGAR) for the eight sorting algorithms in Additional file 1. In [17] , the R2E permuted sample rank of SARS severity was identified to be significantly correlated with the clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) and other clinical factors. The severity rank of samples was also found to be highly correlated with the suppression of the human Table 2 and we note the following: • the proposed HCT_R2E algorithm has the highest correlation with number of days after the onset of disease while the R2E method comes next; • the proposed HCT_R2E algorithm has the highest correlation with CPIS among all eight sorting methods, while the SVD1 and HCT_OPT algorithms share second place From these comparisons we observe a significant advantage of the proposed R2E-guided hierarchical clustering tree in searching for meaningful biomedical information and correlation such that researchers can further propose more precise hypotheses and conducting more accurate experiments. The CA plot is reconstructed in Figure 6a . Information for the 444 genes is not displayed for better illustration of the 19 [18] did not specify proximity measure and linkage type in their study). The optimal HCT and the proposed elliptical seriation-guided HCT with their permuted Euclidean matrices are displayed in Figure 6bc . Although HCT_OPT does identify good local clusters for the metal groups, the overall permutation does not correlate well with the linear trend from the CA analysis. The HCT_R2E permutation not only correlates with the linear trend of transition metal groups very well, it also sorts the within-metal group concentration levels precisely following those orders in the CA analysis in Figure 6a . This study illustrates well that the proposed HCT_R2E method is capable of providing permutations with both good global and local properties, although the optimal HCT still outputs better local orders numerically. The accompanying distance matrix map clearly indicates the Zn(0.005) and Cu(0.7) conditions, in addition to the Ni [II] conditions, deviate from the main linear trend of these transition metals and the Robinson pattern.
