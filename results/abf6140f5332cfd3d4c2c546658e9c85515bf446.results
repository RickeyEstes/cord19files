Clinical data of ALI and non-ALI patients, and control subjects 101 ALI patients (age, 65.1 AE 16.5 yrs; 68 men and 33 women), 408 non-ALI patients and 236 healthy subjects were enrolled. Clinical characteristics of ALI patients were summarized in Table 1 . The common causes of ALI patients in this study were pneumonia (61.4%), sepsis (18.8%) and trauma (12.9%). Genotypes and allele frequencies of ACE polymorphism data Table 2 summarized the ACE genotype (II, ID, and DD) and allele (I and D) frequencies of the three groups. DD genotype accounted for a similar percentage (13.8%, 10.1% and 9.8%, respectively; p ï¼ž 0.05). The frequencies of D allele in three groups were 34.2%, 35.7% and 32%, respectively. Comparisons showed that there was no significant difference in the genotype and allele frequencies among these groups.
