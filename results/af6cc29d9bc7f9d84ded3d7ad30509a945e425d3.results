A NPFS was collected from a 64 years old man with respiratory symptoms and the diagnostics for the most common respiratory viruses and bacteria remained negative. After performing virus discovery a total of 13,452 sequence reads were obtained and compared with all known sequences in GenBank (NCBI). Among these, 10 sequences showed significant identity to HPVs. By genome walking the entire sequence of the virus (named HPV isolate A2619) was determined: the viral genome is 7142 bp in size, circular and 99% identical to the recently described HPV-KC5 isolate (GenBank accession number: JX444073; Li et al., 2012) .
