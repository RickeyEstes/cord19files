The participants were a sample of 333 nurses, representing 13.6% of the total 2441 nurses in the facilities analysed. Nurses were predominantly females with a mean age of 35.4 years. A 4-year bachelor degree was common, and 61.0% of participants had less than 10 years of healthcare experience (Column 1, Table 1 ). The majority were full-time workers (75.9%), working less than or equal to 40 h per week (65.5%) in shifts of 8 h or less. The internal consistency of effort, reward, workplace burnout and infection control adherence scales in this analysis as determined by Cronbach's alpha were 0.81, 0.85, 0.86, and 0.83, respectively, indicating high reliability suitable for further analysis. The mean ERI and burnout scores for the study population were 0.71 and 41.5, respectively. Despite the mean scores falling below the thresholds indicative of imbalance and exposure to burnout, 35.8% of nurses were above the burnout exposure limit and 20.4% experienced a negative ERI. The mean risk score was 3.63, equivalent to a perceived moderate-to-high risk of contracting an infectious disease from patients and transmitting it to others. The mean infection control compliance score was 3.60, with 44.2% of nurses reporting adherence to preventive measures more than 70% of the time. There was no statistically significant association between any of the demographic variables and ERI, work burnout or adherence results. However, being an auxiliary nurse was statistically associated with a lower work burnout (P = 0.030) and a higher self-reported infection control adherence score (P = 0.040) than other nursing roles (Table 1) . Pearson correlation analysis of nurses' perceived risk of infection yielded a statistically significant positive correlation with increased adherence (r = 0.133, P = 0.018), and negative correlations with work burnout (r = À0.240, P = 0.001) and ERI (r = À0.154, P = 0.006). Therefore, both the auxiliary nurse role and perceived risk of infection were controlled for in the hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis. The hierarchical multiple linear regression to assess the ability of ERI to predict levels of burnout yielded a statistically significant second model (Table 2) ; (R 2 =0.278, P < 0.01) indicating ERI to be a unique incremental predictor of burnout (b = 0.44, t = 9.03, P < 0.01) after controlling for nursing role and perceived risk in the first model ( Table 2) . The associations between work burnout and infection control adherence, and the combined impact of work burnout and ERI on self-reported infection control adherence were also assessed through hierarchical multiple linear regression. Missing Data: sex (4 cases), age (16 cases), civil status (5 cases), education (12 cases), healthcare experience (30 cases) and average work shift (29 cases). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. Burnout was found to be a unique incremental predictor of adherence to infection control precautions (b = À0.18, t = À3.09, P < .05) as indicated in model 2 (Table 3) . However, the addition of ERI in model 3 did not yield a statistically significant ΔR 2 (b = 0.09, t = 1.38, P > 0.05), that is a combined effect between high ERI and high burnout scores on decreased self-reported adherence with infection control was not supported (Table 3) . Variance inflation factors for both multiple linear regressions were less than 2 indicating multicollinearity was not an issue in the analyses.
