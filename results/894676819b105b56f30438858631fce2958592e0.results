From April 2008 to December 2013, 3428 pediatric patients with ALRTIs were identified. A total of 194 HAdV-positive cases were detected using the Luminex xTAG respiratory viral panel assay; the most prevalent HAdV serotype was HAdV-7 (102/194, 53%), followed by HAdV-3 (51/194, 26%). Eight cases (8/194 , 4%) of HAdV-55 infection were detected. Other newly emerging and re-emergent serotypes or variants, such as HAdV-57 (3/194, 2%) and HAdV-14 (3/194, 2%), were also identified (Fig. 1) . Among the 8 HAdV-55 positive cases, 5 (63%) cases were detected in April, 2 (25%) cases were detected in March, and 1 (13%) case was detected in October. In contrast, HAdV-7 infections occurred throughout the year, although such infections were also most frequent in April (19%) (Fig. 2) . Among the 8 HAdV-55 infected patients, one child was an outpatient, and we only knew her age and sex. Another patient left hospital in advance and without recovery, and her clinical features (except for the first blood test after admission to hospital) could not be documented. All 32 matched control subjects were inpatients. Table 1 shows clinical characteristics of the patients with HAdV-55 infection and the control subjects with HAdV-7 infection. There were no cases of mortality in either group. Most clinical symptoms and signs, and blood parameters did not significantly differ between the two groups, with the exception of wheezing, which was observed in 17% of HAdV-55-infected patients and 63% of HAdV-7-infected patients (P = 0.038). Furthermore, no patient infected with HAdV-55 exhibited vomiting or had any underlying disease; however, 3 (9%) patients vomited during the course of HAdV-7 infection, and 2 HAdV-7-infected patients had underlying disease (congenital heart disease and wheezing). Meanwhile, only 29% (2/7) of HAdV-55 infected patients developed respiratory failure, cardiac damage, or liver function damage, whereas in HAdV-7 infected group, the above mentioned complications arosed in more than half of the patients (56%, 18/32); however, this was not statistically significant (P = 0.184). Co-infections were observed in 75 and 94% of cases of HAdV-55 and HAdV-7 infections, respectively. HAdV-55 patients were most frequently coinfected with HPIV (25%); Streptococcus pneumoniae (17%), RhV (8%), IFA (8%), HCoV (8%), HBoV (8%), HMPV (8%), Escherichia coli (8%), and Haemophilus influenzae (8%) were also detected in cases involving multiple infection in the HAdV-55 group, in which the percentages of double, triple, and quadruple infection were each 33%. HAdV-7-infected patients were also most commonly coinfected with HPIV (40%); in the HAdV-7 group, multiple infections involving Mycoplasma pneumoniae (27%), RhV (23%), RSV (20%), viridans group Streptococci (17%), HBoV (10%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10%), HCoV (7%), fungus (7%), IFA (3%), EBV (3%), Acinetobacter baumannii (3%), and Haemophilus influenzae (3%) were also detected. In that group, the percentages of double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, and sextuple infections were 56, 13, 13, 9, and 3%, respectively (Fig. 3 ).
