A total of 103 febrile neutropaenic episodes and 42 afebrile neutropaenic episodes were included in the study ( Table 1 ). The majority of patients were treated for acute leukaemias and none were diagnosed with invasive fungal infections. Microbiological findings were assumed, for the purpose of this study, to be the primary cause of fever and episodes with no microbiological findings are classified as 'fever with unknown origin' (FUO).
