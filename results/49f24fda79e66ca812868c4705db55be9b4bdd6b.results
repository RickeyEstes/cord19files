Detection of SARS-CoV spike protein using peptide specific antibodies Using computer analysis to predict hydrophobic regions of SARS spike protein (http://searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu/seq-search/struc-predict.html), we designed six specific peptides of SARS-CoV spike protein to raise polyclonal antibodies, SP1-SP6 (Fig. 1A) . To evaluate the specificity of these peptide-induced antibodies, Western blot analysis was conducted. Immunoblotting showed that peptide SP1-and SP4-induced polyclonal antibodies recognized the 6Â His-tagged N-terminal fragment (a.a. 10-647) of SARS-CoV spike protein, but not the C-terminal fragment (a.a. 648-1255) (Figs. 1B and C). By contrast, peptide SP6-induced polyclonal antibody recognized the 6Â His-tagged C-terminal spike protein, but not the N-terminal end (Fig. 1D) . Structural predictions suggest that SARS-CoV spike protein is a highly glycosylated protein. To investigate whether SP1-, SP4-, and SP6-induced antibodies recognize glycosylated spike protein during SARS-CoV infection, immunofluorescent assay was carried out. Peptide-induced SP1 and SP4 polyclonal antibodies preferentially detected the same signals as did positive control sera obtained from patients who had recovered from probable SARS infection (Fig. 2) . In contrast, SP6-induced antiserum did not yield a positive IFA result (data not shown), suggesting that SP6-induced antiserum is useful in Western blot analysis, but not in the immunofluorescence test. To exclude the possibility of cross-reaction from peptide-induced polyclonal antibodies, SP1 and SP4 pre-immunized rabbit antisera were applied to BIOCHIPs and these sera did not recognize SARS-infected cells. Furthermore, SP1 and SP4 polyclonal antibodies did not detect any SARS-CoV spike protein after peptide competition (data not shown), demonstrating that SP1-and SP4-induced polyclonal antibodies specifically recognize SARS-CoV spike protein.
