Optimization of scFv surface expression in mammalian cells PS11 scFv, an antibody targeting the Tat-recognition motif (TRM) of cyclin T1 [18] , was chosen as a model for optimizing functional expression of scFv on the surface of mammalian cells. To gain bivalency and increase the sensitivity of detecting antigens bound to surface antibody, the PS11 scFv was expressed as an scFvFc fusion protein [18] [19] [20] . For anchoring to the cell membrane, PS11 scFvFc protein was fused, in frame, to a transmembrane (TM) moiety. TM domains of HIV-1 gp41, CD8 and CD28 were tested for maximal surface expression of the scFvFc. As shown in Figure 1 , all anchoring moieties consist of a short extracellular region, an entire TM domain and a cytoplasmic tail. Eight residues of the most membrane-proximal HIV-1 gp41 cytoplasmic tail, previously shown to provide a putative ''envelope (env) incorporation motif'' [21] , were also tested for their ability to promote efficient pseudotyping of the scFvFc fusion proteins onto HIV virions or subsequently the cell surface, as a direct fusion to the gp41 TM or attached to the carboxy terminus of the CD8 or CD28 cytoplasmic tails. Surface expression of the PS11-scFvFc-TM proteins was initially analyzed by FACS analysis of transiently transfected 293T cells, stained with APC-conjugated anti-human-Fc antibody ( Figure 2 ). While transfection efficiency with each of the constructs was relatively equal, as monitored through the expression level of a cotransfected GFP plasmid (data not shown), depending on the Figure 1 . Diagram of constructs used in the study. ScFv antibodies were inserted between the leader peptide (LP) and the Fc region of a human IgG1 molecule. The Fc domain was linked in-frame to a short segment of extracellular domain of HIV-1 gp41 (blue), CD8 (green) or CD28 (purple), followed by their respective transmembrane domains (TM; horizontal stripes) and cytoplasmic domains (vertical stripes). In the case of HIV-gp41, the last 19 residues of the extracellular region (solid blue) are followed by a TM spanner (22 residues; blue horizontal stripes) and a cytoplasmic tail (blue vertical stripes). Either the full length 151 residues of the cytoplasmic domain or a truncated region that includes only the first eight residues of the cytoplasmic tail were used. Numbering is according to p160 of HIV-1 HXB2. For CD8, the most membrane-proximal 12 residues of the extracellular domain (solid green) and 11 residues of the cytoplasmic domain (green vertical stripes) flank 21 residues of the TM region (horizontal green stripes). For CD28, an extracellular region consisting of 40 residues (solid purple) and a cytoplasmic region of 13 residues (purple vertical stripes) flank the 27-residue TM domain (horizontal purple stripes). To facilitate scFvFc-TM incorporation into virions, an eight-residue ''env incorporation motif'', which encodes the membrane proximal part of the gp41 cytoplasmic tail (NRVRQGYS; single blue line-amino acids 706-713), was attached to the carboxy-terminal ends of the cytoplasmic domains of CD8 and CD28. A nine amino acid C9 tag (red box) is positioned at Cterminus of all Fc domains to facilitate detection/quantitation of scFvFc expression on the cell surface. The gene cassette was cloned into pCDNA3.1 or the modified pHAGE lentiviral vector between Sfi-I and Pac-I sites. A CMV promoter controls expression of the scFvFc-TM transgenes. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0003181.g001 Figure 2 . Optimization of scFvFc cell-surface expression using different transmembrane domains. 293T cells were transfected with the pcDNA 3.1 based constructs encoding PS11-scFvFc antibodies of different configurations as described in Figure 1 and labeled under each lane in Panels a and b. pcDNA3.1-CMV-GFP was co-transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. At 48 hours post transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed for GFP and scFv-Fc expression by FACS analysis. Panels a and b, represent results from FACS analysis of the percentage of transmembrane moiety, differences in cell-surface expression of PS11-scFvFc were observed in both the percentage of cells that were positive for scFvFc expression (Panel a), and more pronounced by their respective MFI values (Panel b). The data indicate that PS11-scFvFc antibodies anchored by the TM of CD8 (lanes 6 and 7) or CD28 (lanes 8 and 9) were highly expressed on the surface of mammalian cells, compared to PS11-scFvFc fused to HIV-gp41 TM (either a long or short cytoplasmic tails; lanes 4 and 5) that were poorly surface expressed, and their MFI values were low. To directly visualize the distribution and localization of scFvFc-TM expression, cells transfected with a bicistronic IRES-ZsGreen expression vector encoding PS11-scFvFc-gp41 (665-856), or PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 (706-713) were labeled with a rhodamine conjugated anti-human Fc antibody for immunofluorescence analysis. As shown in Figure 2c , cells expressing PS11-scFvFc-gp41 (665-856) demonstrated punctate staining with large aggregates and exhibited an overall low level of cell-surface expression (image b). In contrast, PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 (706-713) proteins were evenly distributed on the cell surface and also had a reticular staining pattern, consistent with efficient ER folding and expression (image c). As a control, rhodamine conjugated antihuman Fc staining was not detected on cells transfected with ZsGreen encoding vector alone (image a). These results are consistent with the FACS data shown in Figure 2a and 2b. Low expression and possible aggregation of PS11-scFvFc-gp41 (665-856) may be a result of poor folding, as the natural Fc moiety forms dimers, while gp41 forms trimers through its TM. Finally, radio-immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that the membrane bound PS11-scFv-CD28-gp41 (706-713) protein was dimeric ( Figure 2d ).
