A total of 473 patients were diagnosed with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus-related pneumonia. Patients were admitted to 20 hospitals in 9 provinces of China between October 1, 2016, and March 1, 2017, and were reported to the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China. The medical records of 216 patients were available, and 36 patients were reported to be supported by ECMO. One of the 36 patients lacked IPPV and ECMO parameters pre-ECMO and on ECMO and was eliminated as a participant; therefore, 35 patients were ultimately selected ( Fig. 1) .
