Quantification of the disease burden associated with each respiratory virus required calculations of sampling frequencies, breakdown of clinical data, and determination of ITU admission rates. The number of samples tested and the frequency of samples testing singly positive for each virus are summarized (Table 1) . Between 1035 (rhinoviruses) and 12,883 (HRSV and influenza A) samples were tested for each virus. Detection frequencies ranged between 0.33% (PIV-2) and 18.1% (rhinoviruses). The rates of admission to ITUs (Table 1 ) associated with each virus are given, and fell in the range 8.5% (rhinoviruses) and 20.0% (AdV). The rates that respiratory virus infections were associated with LRTI, URTI, no respiratory outcome and immunocompromised patients are indicated (Fig. 1) . HRSV was more frequently associated with LRTI than other respiratory viruses, whereas PIV-3 was frequently associated with upper respiratory presentations in comparison with other viruses. The proportion of virus positive samples collected from immunocompromised patients was highest for rhinoviruses and lowest for HRSV. Burden of disease of the most commonly detected respiratory viruses are described (Table 2 ). In children under 5 years of age, HRSV was clearly the leading cause of disease, attributable with nearly 70 DALYs per 1000 hospitalized population. Adenoviruses and rhinoviruses were also significant pathogens in this age group. The parainfluenza viruses caused less disease, with PIV-1 and PIV-2 associated with the least disease of those viruses analysed. In older children between 5 and 16 years old, HRSV was again the leading cause of disease. Different sampling strategies between age categories complicates direct comparison of different age groups, but a much lower score in this age group compared with the younger children implies less disease in older children. Rhinoviruses and adenoviruses again scored highly compared with other viruses in this age group, and parainfluenza viruses maintained a minimal role in disease. In adults between 16 and 64 years of age, influenza A was the leading cause of disease, although the score of 2.2 DALYs per 1000 population is low in comparison with the leading causes of disease in other age groups. In this age group HMPV, HRVs and PIV-1 were not associated with any respiratory disease in the hospitalized population. Influenza A retained its status as leading viral cause of disease in older adults, with a much higher DALY score of 107.9. Influenza B and HRSV also scored highly. While we fully acknowledge the difficulties in comparing disease burden between age groups (see above), it is interesting that the score for HRSV in this age group of 41.0 is higher than that observed in under 5 s of 67.7. In immunocompromised subjects, HRSV and rhinoviruses scored similarly at the top of the table. Adenoviruses, influenza A, PIV-3 and HMPV had comparable DALY scores in immunocompromised patients. Adenoviruses are more frequently associated with disease outcomes outside the respiratory umbrella and so caution is required with interpretation of this finding. Coronaviruses caused least disease in the immunocompromised patients. Between age groups, the burden of disease caused by different respiratory viruses was remarkably variable (Fig. 2) . Most striking was the increasing importance of influenza viruses A and B with age, occurring inversely with the decreasing disease burden of adenoviruses. Parainfluenza-and corona-viruses were of maximal impact in the intermediate age brackets encompassing 6-64 year olds, which is largely attributable to the lack of disease caused by other viruses in these patient groups. HRSV was a substantial cause of disease regardless of age. HMPV and HRVs caused more disease in the under 16 s than in adults. The ratio of disease burden attributable to virus infections compared to that of respiratory disease with non-viral or unidentified causes diminished with increasing age (Table 2) , likely reflecting the increasing incidence bacterial infections in older age groups. A secondary contributor to this may be reduced disease burden of respiratory virus infections with increasing age. Disease burden profiles were compared between males and females (Fig. 3) . While greater scores for disease burden were usually observed in males than females for each virus, the proportion of disease attributable to each virus was not different between males and females.
