We first studied the editing ability of six ANPEP guide RNAs (gRNAs) in cultured primary porcine fetal fibroblast cells. The six target sequences, all located within exon 2, are listed in Online Resource Table S1 . Sequences were designed based on NCBI Reference Sequence, NM_214277.1 and cloned into p330X vector (Addgene). To confirm target specificity for ANPEP exon 2, a search of GenBank identified no sequences similar to the gRNAs. The results for 17 gRNA plasmid transfection experiments, presented in Online Resource Table S2 , showed that the Guide 2 plasmid possessed the highest editing efficiency followed by Guide 1. However, combining both guides 1 and 2 failed to yield edited cells (see Online Resource Table S2 ). No ANPEP-edits were observed in fibroblasts transfected with the remaining gRNA plasmids. Guide RNAs 2 and 3, along with Cas9 mRNA, were co-injected into the cytoplasm of fertilized oocytes at 14 h after fertilization. Guide 3 was selected because it possessed no editing ability in fibroblasts. It was not clear at the time if guides would have the same editing ability in both fibroblasts and zygotes. Zygotes were cultured for 5 days (morula/blastocyst stage) and transferred to surrogate pigs to gestate (Whitworth et al. 2014) . The edited ANPEP alleles in offspring piglets were identified based on sequencing PCR products amplified from genomic DNA flanking exon 2. Six embryo transfers resulted in three pregnancies and two litters of viable piglets, which yielded twelve founder animals. Of the 12 founders, nine were edited and of the three founders, a boar and two gilts, were used to create the F1 litters used for the challenge studies (Online Resource Table S3 ). The exon 2 edits for the three breeding founder pigs are illustrated in Fig. 1A . The ANPEP-edited boar, No. 158-9, possessed bi-allelic null edits, consisting of B and C alleles. One ANPEP-modified dam, No. 158-1, was a mosaic; possessing a WT (A) allele as well as edits F, G and the null edits, D and H. The F and G alleles possessed 9 and 12 bp deletions, which were predicted to result in the deletion of peptide sequences, 294-Met-Glu-Gly and 294-Met-Glu-Gly-Asp-Val [ Ile, respectively. The second dam, No. 4-2, possessed two null alleles, E and D. All frame-shift edits resulted in a premature stop codon. The phenotype of each ANPEP edit was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the presence of ANPEP protein in ileum (see Fig. 1B ). As expected, all ANPEP WT pigs expressed ANPEP on the surface of enterocytes lining the intestine. Phenotypically, pigs possessing either the F or the G allele also showed immunoreactivity for the ANPEP protein; however, immunoreactivity was visibly weaker in pigs possessing the G allele in which four amino acids were deleted. ANPEP immunoreactivity was absent in pigs possessing two null alleles. Piglets derived from dams No. 158-1 and No. 4-2, artificially inseminated with semen from boar No. 158-9, were utilized for infection with viruses. The first breeding yielded piglets from only No. 158-1. As summarized in Table 1 , Litter 121 consisted of eight total piglets, consisting of two pigs possessing the four amino acid deletion, one pig with the three amino acid deletion, and one ANPEP KO pig. Five WT pigs from a different litter were included as positive controls for infection. Soon after weaning, all piglets were infected with 10 6 TCID 50 of PEDV isolate KS13-09, administered orally. To facilitate continuous exposure to virus, all modified and control pigs were housed in the same pen over the duration of the study. The presence of a productive infection was assessed by the detection of virus in the feces by RT-PCR and by IHC for the presence of viral antigen in ileum. The results, using a standard published assay that provides a good yes or no answer (Niederwerder et al. 2016) , presented in Fig. 2A , showed that all pigs were strongly positive for the presence of PEDV nucleic acid in feces, beginning at 7 days after infection. By day 7 post infection, at least one pig of each phenotype was positive by real time PCR for PEDV nucleic acid in serum. IHC confirmed that all pigs possessed PEDV antigen in enterocytes lining the ileum ( Fig. 2A ). Since all genotypes were infected additional detailed studies were not undertaken. When taken together, these results showed that while ANPEP may play a supporting role for infection (Li et al. 2017; Shirato et al. 2016 ) the absence of ANPEP did not significantly affect infection of pigs with PEDV. For the second experiment, litters were obtained from both dams. Dam No. 158-1 produced 4 piglets, two of which were used in the study, and dam No. 4-2 produced 13 piglets, six of which were used in the study (summarized in Table 2 ). Seven WT pigs from a single litter were included as positive controls. Pigs were infected after weaning with the Purdue strain of TGEV by using the same route, dose and housing conditions described above for PEDV. A commercial RT-PCR assay was used to detect the presence of virus in fecal samples. During the first week of infection, all WT pigs were positive for TGEV nucleic acid in feces. Viral nucleic acid was not detected in feces of the single pig possessing the three amino acid deletion in ANPEP or in any of the seven KO pigs (Fig. 2B ). The recovery of tissues for the assessment of TGEV antigen IHC was based on the selection of a pig at 3 days after infection, when large quantities of viral nucleic acid were present in feces (Fig. 2B ). The WT pig was positive for the presence of TGEV antigen in ileum, while the ANPEP KO pig, removed from the study at the same time, was negative for antigen ( Fig. 2B ). The intestinal tissue from the pig possessing the three amino acid deletion was process for IHC TGEV antigen at 13 days after infection and showed the presence of antibody for viral antigen in ileum. To confirm the TGEV infection status, serum samples were tested for the presence of TGEV-specific antibody. Both blocking ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) method were used to evaluate the presence of TGEV-specific antibodies. The WT and three amino acid deletion pigs were positive for TGEV-specific antibody (Fig. 3) ; whereas, all ANPEP KO pigs were negative for TGEV antibody. Even though the pig possessing the three amino acid deletion was negative for TGEV nucleic acid in feces, positive TGEV antigen in ileum and a positive antibody response confirmed that this pig was productively infected. Together, these data confirm that the presence of ANPEP is required for TGEV infection of pigs. The successful infection of A The CRISPR Guide 2 sequence (highlighted) is located 564 bp downstream of the ATG start codon. The Guide 3 sequence is located 48 bp after the ATG. The left side of the figure shows the allele designation letter followed by a brief description. The amino acids coding for each edit are shown. Key: white area, non-coding region; black area, coding region. The founder animals have the following genotype, 4-2 (D/E), 158-1 (A, D, F, G, H) and 158-9 (B/C). B The lower panels show immunoreactivity for ANPEP antigen in ileum sections derived from euthanized PEDV challenged pigs. Ileum sections from ANPEP WT pigs showed ANPEP immunoreactivity on the surface of enterocytes lining the intestine. Ileum from pigs possessing either the F or the G allele (9 and 12 bp in frame deletions) also showed immunoreactivity for the ANPEP protein; however, immunoreactivity was visibly weaker in pigs possessing the G allele in which four amino acids were deleted. ANPEP immunoreactivity was absent in pigs possessing two null alleles. Specific genotypes are null/F (B/F), null/G (B/G) and null/null (B/H) pigs possessing the minor ANPEP-edit that resulted in the deletion of three amino acids in the exon 2 coding region indicates that this peptide sequence is not required for TGEV infection.
