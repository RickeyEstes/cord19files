Cell density of untreated SMD1168H and its recombinant forms. The cell density of the yeast strain SMd1168H was gradually increased after 36 h of cultivation (1.306 units; P<0.05) and reached a peak value of 1.343 units at ~48 h (P<0.05; Fig. 2A ). Following this peak, the cell density was reduced from 60 h of cultivation and onwards, with the yeast growth reaching the lowest level of 0.873 units at 72 h. a similar growth profile was observed when SMD1168H was transformed with the empty pPicZαa plasmid (SMd1168H-pPicZαa) and maintained in the culture without treatment (Fig. 2B) (Fig. 2c) . although the growth of the yeast did slightly reduce from 60 h onwards, the cells did not reach the lowest level of growth observed in the other yeast strains. The cell density at 60 h (1.774 units; P<0.001) and 72 h (1.504 units; P<0.01) remained significantly higher compared with the 12 h group, indicating This phenomenon indicates that using both glutamate and ToPoi in the culture may create competition among the components. as such, the growth of cells was slightly stunted, which resulted in a delay in reaching the optimum growth level. The growth of these three yeast types clearly responded to glutamate treatment in the culture, indicating that the recombinant yeast may be useful in estimating the effect of other potential agents for cancer treatment. Cell density of camptothecin-treated SMD1168H and its recombinant forms. SMd1168H treated with 100 µM camptothecin for 72 h exhibited a similar optimum level of cell density as glutamate-treated SMd1168H before 48 h of cultivation. The treated yeast was still capable of maintaining a cell density of 1.340 units at 24 h of cultivation (P<0.05) and an optimum level of 1.583 units at ~36 h of cultivation (P<0.01; Fig. 2G ). However, the cell density was subsequently reduced to ~1.225 units, and the growth was gradually maintained at this level until 72 h. in the camptothecin-treated SMd1168H-pPicZαA, a similar growth profile was observed, with a cell density of 1.408 units at 24 h (P<0.05) and a peak levels of 1.540 units being reached at 36 h (P<0.01; Fig. 2H ). The growth of the yeast was reduced to ~1.389 units and growth continued at this level until 72 h of cultivation. notably, camptothecin did not induce the same inhibitory effects in SMd1168H-ToPoi as that demonstrated in the other two yeast clones. Despite a markedly lower cell density in the yeast expressing the camptothecin target (ToPoi) at 24 and 36 h compared with SMd1168H and SMd1168H-pPicZαa, the recombinant yeast grew steadily at a cell density of ~1.170 units throughout the experiment, and the growth of the recombinant yeast was not inhibited by camptothecin treatment, with no statistically significant changes observed (Fig. 2I ). camptothecin treatment of SMd1168H-ToPoi was expected to reduce the yeast cell density; however, this treatment did not entirely inhibit the yeast growth, indicating the aggressiveness of the SMd1168H-ToPoi, which may be comparable to that of highly metastatic human cancer cells. Camptothecin dose-response in various cell lines. Treatment of McF-10a cells with camptothecin for 72 h did not produce a typical dose-response curve (Fig. 3a) . Similarly, no typical dose-response was observed in cal-27 cells following treatment with camptothecin over 48 h. camptothecin only produced a logistic dose-response in cal-27 cells when treatment was performed for 72 h (hillslope=-1.29; maximal response, ≤25%; Fig. 3B ). The maximal dose-response of camptothecin in McF-7 cells was observed to improve with treatment for 24 h (hillslope=-2.42; maximal response, ≤50%), 48 h (hillslope=-0.65; maximal response, ≤25%) and 72 h (hillslope=-1.28; maximal response, ≤25%; Fig. 3C ). In general, chemosensitivity to camptothecin was better in McF-7 cells in comparison with cal-27 cells, although similar dose response was observed in McF-7 (hillslope=-1.28; maximal response, ≤25%) and CAL-27 (hillslope=-1.29; maximal response, ≤25%) cells treated for 72 h. As shown in Fig. 3D , camptothecin only produced a typical dose-response in Mda-MB-231 cells treated for 24 h (hillslope=-0.37; maximal response, ≤50%). However, the effect was not sustained after 24 h of treatment. The semi-parabolic growth profile, which is a general growth curve that conveys resistance of an organism to a particular drug treatment, was produced when treatment was performed for 72 h. This phenomenon indicates that reduced growth at 48 h of treatment and onwards may be due to by-product accumulation in the culture. These preliminary findings indicate that there was a considerable similarity in the initial response of MdB-MB-231 cells and the recombinant yeast SMd1168H-ToPoi to camptothecin treatment.
