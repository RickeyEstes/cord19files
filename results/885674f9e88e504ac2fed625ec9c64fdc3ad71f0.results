Localization ofS33D and S64D to the GolgiApparatus ST is a 47-48-kD integral membrane protein oftype II orientation (single transmembrane domain with its NH2 terminus in the cytosol and the COOH terminus in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus) Weinstein et al., 1987; our unpublished observations) . The NH2-terminal 65-residue sequence of rat ST is shown in Fig. 1 . To determine the minimum sequence ofthe N112-terminal region of ST that is sufficient for membrane anchorage and Golgi localization, we have constructed a series of chimeric cDNAs which encode different fusion proteins ( Fig. 1 B) , with decreasing lengths of the N112-terminal ST sequence fused to the ectodomain of DPPIV . The NH2-terminal 35residue sequence of DPPIV is also shown in Fig . 1 A (D4) . Previous studies have shown that the N112-terminal 34residue sequence of DPPIV is the signal/anchor sequence (Hong and Doyle, 1990 ) . The first set of experiments resulted in the construction of chimeric cDNAs encoding for fusion proteins S64D, S5 1D, S46D, S40D, S33D, and S27D in which the same ectodomain of DPPIV (from residue 33 to the COOH-terminus) was fused to the N112-terminal 64-, 51-, 46-, 40-, 33-, and 27-residue sequence of ST ( Fig. 1 B) . In vitro translation studies demonstrated that all ofthem, except for S27D, were efficiently anchored in the membrane. The results for S27D and S33D are shown in Fig. 2 . Results similar to S33D were obtained for S64D, S51D, S46D, and S40D (data not shown) . These results demonstrated that the NH2-terminal 33-but not 27-residue sequence of ST is sufficient for membrane anchorage. Since S27D was not anchored in the membrane, it was not pursued further. To examine the role in Golgi localization of the ST sequence in the remaining five fusion proteins, the respective chimeric cDNAs were inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pRSN (Low et al., 1991a,b) and transfected into MDCK cells . Stably transfected cells were found to express the desired fusion proteins. Since similar results were obtained for all the five fusion proteins, only the results obtained for fusion proteins S64D and S33D are shown. Pulse-chase experiments were performed to follow the intracellular transport of S64D and S33D (Fig. 3 A) . As shown, a 100-kD protein was specifically detected in the pulse-labeled cells expressing S33D. As chase proceeded, this 1004D form was converted into a 110-kD form. This conversion was very efficient, as all newly made 100-kD molecules were converted into the 110-kD form within 90 min of chase . In cells expressing S64D, a 105-kD form was initially detected in pulse-labeled cells and this form was converted into a 115-kD form during the chase period. A majority of the 105-kD form was converted into the 115-kD form after 90 min of chase, although a small amount of the 105-kD form was still observed . Endo H treatment ofimmunoprecipitated proteins (Fig. 3 B) showed that the 100-kD form ofS33D and the 105-kD formofS64Dwere mainly converted into 80-and 85-kD polypeptides, respectively, which were of the same size as the respective polypeptides without any glycosylation (produced by in vitro translation without microsomes) . This result suggests that all the N-linked glycans (about 7-8 N-linked glycans, but no detectable 0-linked glycans, were present in the ectodomain of DPPIV [Hong and Doyle, 1988 ; Hong et al., 1989] ) attached to the 100-kD form of S33D and the 105-kD form of S64D were essentially sensitive to endo H and that they represent the newly made proteins in the ER bearing N-linked glycans of the highmannose type. The size of the 110-kD form of S33D was reduced by 4-5-kD after endo H treatment, suggesting that about two of the N-linked glycans in the polypeptide were of the high-mannose type while the remaining N-linked glycans (N5-6) were resistant to endo H. For the MAD form Residue numbers from the NH2 terminus are indicated above the sequence. (B) Summary of fusion proteins used in this study and their properties in membrane anchorage and cellular localization . Residue numbers corresponding to ST are indicated above while those to D4 are indicated below each fusion protein. For fusion proteins, they were named SxD (in which the NH2-terminal X-residue sequence of ST was fused to the ectodomain of DPPIV) or Sx-yD (in which the ST sequence from residue x to y was used to replace the corresponding region of DPPIV) . For membrane anchorage, + and -indicates that the majority of the protein is membrane anchored or not, respectively, as assessed by in vitro translation experiments. For cellular localization, Sand Grepresent surface or Golgi localization, respectively, as examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, while nd indicates "not determined" because of theirnonanchorage in the membrane. Figure 2. Membrane anchorage of selected fusion proteins . The mRNA for the fusion protein was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with microsomes as described previously Doyle, 1988, 1990) . 10 pl of total translation reaction was diluted with 100,u1 of sodium bicarbonate, pH 11 .0, and the membrane-associated proteins (P) were separated from those extractable by this treatment (S) . Samples equivalent to 4 gl of original translation were analyzed forboth P and S fractions. The 80-kD polypeptide is the untranslocated form, while the 100-kD polypeptide is the translocated N-glycosylated form for the respective fusion proteins . of S64D, a 2-3 kD size decrease was observed after endo H treatment, suggesting that one of the N-linked glycans was a high-mannose type while the rest (-6-7) of the N-linked glycans were endo H resistant . These results demonstrate that the majority of the N-linked glycans in the 110√ÅD form of S33D and the MAD form of S64D had been modified by enzymes in the medial-Golgi cisternae . These results therefore show that both fusion proteins were transported efficiently from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and that they were localized in the medial-and/or post-medial-Golgi compartment. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was used to determine the cellular localization of these fusion proteins Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies to DPPN and the immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The smaller-and the larger-sized bands represent the ER and Golgi forms, respectively. (B) Endo H treatment of fusion proteins S33D and S64D. Cells expressing the respective fusion proteins were labeled with PIS]methionine for 30 min followed by 30 min of chase . After being immunoprecipitated, half of the sample was treated with endo H (+ ) while the remaining half was processed in an identical way except that no endo H was included (-) . ( Fig . 4 A) . An intense staining signal was detected on the surface of MDCK cells expressing normal DPPN (A) . A similar staining pattern was observed for normal DPPIV in permeabilized cells (B) except that some perinuclear signal was also detected . The perinuclear staining most likely represents molecules in transit through the Golgi apparatus . In contrast, only background staining was observed on the surface of cells expressing S33D (C) and S64D (E) . When the cells were permeabilized, intense perinuclear vesiculartubular staining was detected in the cells expressing S33D (D) and S64D (F) . This pattern of intracellular staining is typical for the Golgi apparatus (Lipsky and Pagano, 1985 ; Louvard et al., 1982; Saraste et al., 1987) , suggesting that S33D and S64D are predominantly localized to the Golgi apparatus . To further confirm the Golgi localization of S33D and S64D, colocalization of S33D or S64D with intracellular WGA binding sites was carried out . Intracellular WGA binding sites are present predominantly in the Golgi apparatus (Lipsky and Pagano, 1985 ; Tartakoff and Vassalli, 1983) . As shown in Fig . 4 B, the staining for S33D (A) and S64D (C) colocalized well with that for WGA binding sites (B and D). These results demonstrated that S33D and S64D were indeed localized to the Golgi apparatus . Localization ofS33D and S64D to the Trans-Golgi Cisternae and/or TGN The results obtained from pulse-chase and endo H treatment experiments suggest that S33D and S64D were present in the medial-and/or post-medial-Golgi cisternae . The indirect fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that they were localized in the Golgi apparatus . To further determine the compartment of their localization, their N-linked carbohydrate structures were examined by lectin affinity chromatography (Haselbeck et al ., 1990; Lis and Sharon, 1986) (Fig. 5) . Cells expressing S33D were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine followed by 30 min of chase such that both the 100-kD ER form and the 110-kD Golgi form of S33D were present in the cells . Similar amounts of labeled S33D were incubated with various lectin-agarose beads . The material bound to the beads was analyzed . As shown in Fig. 5 A, both the 100-and 11041) forms could be quantitatively recovered with Con A-agarose (mannose-binding lectin) (lane 2), consistent with the presence of N-linked glycans of high-mannose type in both 100-and 110-kD forms of S33D as concluded from the endo H experiment . The 110-but not the 100-kD form was also recovered from WGA-, Erythrina cristagalli, (ECA)-, Sambucus nigra (SNA)-, and Maackia amurensis (MAA)-agarose beads. Since ECA binds specifically to the Gal-01,4-G1cNac structure in N-linked glycans, this result demonstrates that the 110-kD form has been modified by trans-Golgi GT. SNA and MAA bind a-2,6-and a-2,3linked sialic acids, respectively. Thus the 110-kD form of S33D has been modified byboth a-2,6-and a-2,3-sialyltransferases, both of which are localized to the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or TGN . These results demonstrate that S33D had been modified by glycosyltransferases of the trans-Golgi cisternae and the TGN and suggest that it is localized to the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or TGN . WGA binds both sialic acid and N-acetylglucosamine while succinylated WGA (sWGA) binds only N-acetylglucosamine (Monsigny et al., 1979 (Monsigny et al., , 1980 . The binding of 110-kD S33D to WGA but not sWGA not only confirmed the presence of sialic acid on the N-linked glycans but also demonstrated that no N-acetylglucosamine residues were exposed on the glycans . Both the 100-and the 110-kD forms of S33D failed to bind Lotusagarose, a fucose-specific lectin . This result suggests that no significant fucose residues were added to the N-linked glycans of S33D. Similar experiments performed with cells expressing S64D (Fig . 5 B) revealed that the 115-kD Golgi form of S64D binds Con A-, WGA-, ECA-, SNA , and MAA-, but not sWGA-or Lotus-agarose (identical pattern as the 110-kD form of S33D). The 115-kD form of S64D has thus been modified by both GT and sialyltransferases . The 105-kD form of S64D was quantitatively recovered from Con (10041)) and Golgi (11041)) forms were present . Similar amounts of the immunocomplex were analyzed directly (Control) or incubated with various lectin-agaroses and the bound fraction was then analyzed . (B) Lectin-binding properties of S64D. Cells expressing S64D were analyzed as described for S331). Con A, concanavalin A; sWGA, succinylated wheat germ agglutinin; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; ECA, Erythrina cristagalli; Lotus, Lotus tetragonolobus ; SNA, Sambucus nigra; MAA, Maackia amurensis. A-agarose beads . Interestingly, a small but detectable portion of the 105-kD form of S64D was also capable of binding WGA, ECA, and SNA (but not sWGA, Lotus, or MAA) . This observation suggests that a small fraction of the 105-kD form might have undergone modifications by 0-GT and ST, although the possibility that the observed binding of the 105-kD form of S64D to WGA, ECA, and SNA was due to nonspecific background binding could not be excluded yet . The small amount of 105-kD form present in pulse-labeled cells after 90 min of chase (Fig . 3 A, lane 5) may therefore have been transported to the Golgi apparatus . These results, taken together, suggest strongly that both S33D and S64D are localized in the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or TGN .
