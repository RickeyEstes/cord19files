During the study period, 11 deaths due to H1N1 pandemic influenza were reported, with a weekly incidence of 7 cases per 1,000 people reported. At the time of the pandemic, a vaccination program has not yet been implemented in Korea. 2 Of the 2,132 participants recruited for the study, 295 were excluded due to incomplete data. The final participant total was 1,837, and comprised 880 hospital employees (47.9% of total) and 957 outpatients (52.1%). Of the hospital employees, 670 (76.3%) were below 40 years old. Of the hospital employees, females were more prevalent than males (64.5% versus 35.5%, respectively). The majority of the respondents were married (n = 510, 58.0%) and had attained advanced education (n = 785, 89.2%). A minority of respondents had a high economic status (n = 186, 21.1%). Of the outpatients, 399 (41.7%) were below 40 years old, 394 (41.2%) were 40-59-years-of-age and 164 (17.1%) were over 60 years old. Males and females comprised 53.2% and 46.8% of the respondents, respectively. The majority were married (72.4%). A minority had an advanced level of education (n = 405, 42.3%) and a high economic standing (n = 119, 12.4%). The reliability of the questions were verified by a Cronbach alpha scores of 0.79 for total HBM components, 0.67 for avoidance behaviors and 0.75 for KCDC recommended is a highly infectious virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) raised pandemic alerts level for this virus to phase 6 in June 2009. 1 In South Korea, The Korea Center of Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has recommended preventive behaviors for the pandemic influenza such as washing hands, using a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and reducing outings when respiratory symptoms or febrile sensations have developed. Nevertheless, the first mortality due to H1N1 was reported in South Korea in August 2009, followed within a month by hundreds of reported cases. 2 During the WHO phase 5, less than half of the public responders had anxiety for pandemic influenza or thought that pandemic influenza seriously affected their health. 3, 4 The performing rate of recommendation action for preventing the pandemic influenza was below 40%. 3 Any studies about perception or preventive behaviors for pandemic influenza have not been reported in South Korea. Therefore, we explored perception and performance of preventive behaviors for pandemic influenza in WHO phase 6, including the desire of pandemic influenza vaccination.
