Of the 51 universities included in this study, 21 (41%) were classified as private and 30 (59%) as public. The average size of the student population for this sample was 7,967 students (range, 1,048-51,140). The online search found that >82% (n ¼ 42) of the universities sampled had a dedicated, accessible pandemic influenza Web site. Nine schools did not have an influenza-dedicated Web site accessible via the search keywords or within 5 "clicks" of the school's home page. The percentage of universities that referenced or included the domains listed in Table 1 was calculated as a measure of overall Web site comprehensiveness. Of the 42 universities with a dedicated influenza Web site, 17 (40.5%) included more than 8 of these measures, 14 (33.3%) included 5-7 measures, 9 (21.4%) included 2-4 measures, and 2 (4.8%) included fewer than 2 measures. The sources of information used to construct these Web sites varied, with a majority using information disseminated through CDC (n ¼ 39; 92.9%), WHO (n ¼ 17; 40.5%), and state health departments (n ¼ 21; 50.0%) Web sites. Access to these sources of information was readily available via links to outside Web sites (n ¼ 41; 97.6%). Although the comprehensiveness of information on university Web sites varied, 85.7% of the schools did not have information specifically directed to the parents of university students. A majority of universities did, however, create Web pages specifically directed at students (57.1%) and faculty/staff (54.8%). Many of the schools had information for students living on campus (66.7%); however, only 14.3% had any information for students studying abroad. Overall, university Web sites promoted prevention (81%) and planning (52.4%) activities, including guidelines for proper hygiene and information on general steps taken by the university to prepare for communicable disease outbreaks on campus. However, the information provided was rarely specific enough to guide any actions, with only 38.1% of sites including details on response efforts, such as social distancing measures or plans for school closures.
