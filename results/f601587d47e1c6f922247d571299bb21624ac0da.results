Viral supergroup behaves similarly to cellular superkingdoms in terms of FSF sharing patterns A total of 1995 significant FSF domains (E < 0.0001) were detected iÃ± 11 million proteins of 5080 proteomes sampled from cells and viruses. A four-set Venn diagram showed that roughly two-thirds of the total FSFs (1279 of 1995) were detected only in cellular proteomes (that is, A, B, E, AB, AE, BE, and ABE Venn groups), whereas the remaining FSFs (716) either were shared between cells and viruses, represented by "XV" Venn groups (that is, AV, BV, EV, ABV, AEV, BEV, and ABEV), or were unique to viruses (V) (Fig. 1A) . Viruses shared FSFs with each and every Venn group (that is, there were no zeros), indicating that Venn diagrams can be extended to include four groups, instead of three, without any oddities. The most populated Venn groups of universal FSFs found in both cells and viruses (ABEV) or shared by Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya (ABE) had 442 and 457 FSFs, respectively. The large size of the ABEV group, which is one-fifth of the total FSFs (442), suggests the coexistence of ancient viruses and cells, very much like the large size of ABE strengthening the hypothesis of a common origin of modern cells. In turn, FSFs unique to superkingdoms and viruses (that is, A, B, E, and V groups) indicate possible later gains specific for each supergroup. These gains were more common in Eukarya (283 FSFs) and Bacteria (154 FSFs) (Tables 1  and 2 ). VSFs uniquely identify the viral supergroup on a scale comparable to that of Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya, each of which also encodes its own set of unique FSFs (Fig. 1A) . In fact, VSFs were 2.75-fold greater in number than the number of specific FSFs in Archaea, which is a bona fide superkingdom. VSFs are underestimated in our census Viral genomes often integrate into cellular genomes and contribute proteins to their makeup. These proteins become part of XV Venn groups. To detect such transfers, we looked at the molecular functions of each ) and in 1 of 383 (0.3%) eukaryotic proteomes that were sampled, indicating a rare presence in eukaryotes. Because both FSFs are components of viral capsids and perform a "hallmark" viral function, their rare presence in eukaryotes is likely a result of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from virus to host or a mistake in HMM assignment rather than shared innovation or vertical inheritance. Similarly, the "gp9" FSF (b.32.1) in the BV group helps in T4 bacteriophage attachment to its host, Escherichia coli (24) . It was only detected in 1 of 1115 (0.08%) bacterial proteomes that were sampled, again suggesting either virus-to-host HGT or erroneous assignment. Remarkably, 20 of 33 (60.06%) BV FSFs were part of our selection, suggesting that a large number of BV FSFs originated in viruses. Because bacterioviruses are known to mediate gene exchange between bacterial species (25), our finding is biologically significant and less likely attributable to mistakes in HMM assignments. These observations suggest that VSFs are spreading to other Venn groups and that their number is expected to grow once a pool of more diverse viruses is sequenced and HGT-associated relationships are determined. Some of the "cellonly" Venn groups (that is, A, B, E, AB, AE, BE, and ABE) may also be contaminated with viral FSFs because a large number of viral FSFs remain unknown as a result of sampling biases and technical limitations in virus discovery in different species.
