During the two inclusion periods, 1543 patients presented with a suspected RTI, of whom 570 patients (36.9%) were immunocompromised. Patients had a median age of 62 years (interquartile range 50-70), 53.3% (n = 304) were male and 39.6% (n = 226) had a pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ( Table 1) . Of these 570 patients, 192 patients (33.7%) were included during the 19 weeks inclusion period within the 2016/2017 respiratory viral season and 378 patients (66.3%) were included during the 22 weeks inclusion period within the 2017/2018 season (Fig. 1) . During the second season, more patients had COPD (45.8% vs 27.6%, p < 0.001). Both seasons had a comparable proportion of patients with signs of pneumonia, 86 patients (44.8%) vs 160 patients (42.3%) (p = 0.57). Overall, antibiotics were prescribed in 71.4% of patients, in 147 patients (76.5%) in first season and 260 (68.8%) in the second season. Overall, 61.7% received beta-lactam antibiotic monotherapy, e.g. amoxicillin, penicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefazolin or ceftazidime, and 9.6% beta-lactam antibiotics in combination with macrolides or fluoroquinolones. There were no differences between the two seasons in the proportion of patients who received narrow or broad spectrum antibiotic therapy or atypical coverage. Of all patients tested during the first season (n = 135), 61 (45.2%) tested virus positive versus 169 (59.5%) patients during the second season (n = 284). Overall, influenza A and B virus were the most frequently identified viruses and accounted for 46.5% of all detected viral pathogens ( Implementation of the rapid molecular test and ED instructions led to a reduction in patients treated with oseltamivir (41.7% vs 27.8%, p < 0.001) ( Table 3) . When stratified, we observed that influenza virus positive patients received more oseltamivir prescriptions (70.8% vs 89.2%, p = 0.011) and influenza virus negative patients fewer (37.5% vs 7.7%, p < 0.001). Also, the number of admitted patients who needed in-hospital isolation facilities was significantly reduced (56.4% vs 41.7%, p = 0.001). We observed no significant effect on the proportion of patients who received empirical antibiotic treatment within 72 h of ED presentation (76.6% in the first season vs 68.8% in the second season, p = 0.458) or on the duration of antibiotics. Furthermore, we observed no effect on hospital admissions, length of hospital stay in admitted patients, the number of PUAT and LUAT taken at the ED, and the proportion of admitted patients receiving more than one chest X-ray within the first 72 h of admission. Also, there was no difference in any adverse outcomes between the two seasons. Significant disadvantageous effects were observed on the number of blood cultures taken at the ED (75.5% vs 74.3%, p = 0.017), the number of sputum cultures (27.6% vs 38.1%, p = 0.046) and length of stay at the ED (3:43 h vs 4:01 h, p = 0.020). When stratified based on admission, a significant increase in ED stay was only observed in non-admitted patients (p = 0.035) and not in admitted patients (p = 0.192).
