The overall prevalence of animals testing positive to BCV and BRSV was 43.1 (95% CI: 41.3-45.0) and 39.2% (95% CI: 37.3-41.0) respectively. There was a statistically significant (P < 0.01, χ 2 -test) relationship between BCV and BRSV serological status, i.e. BCV-positive animals were more likely to be BRSV-positive and vice versa. Animals testing positive to BCV were predominately located in the central-western and southern Sweden, as well as in some northern areas (Figure 1a ). Animals testing positive to BRSV were predominately found in the same centralwestern and southern parts of the country (Figure 2a) . When the prevalences were adjusted by SEB, these tendencies became even clearer (Figures 1b and 2b ) and the northern areas were no longer considered having high prevalences for BCV. The findings were confirmed by significant Moran's I tests for both infections (0.15, P = 0.0001 for BCV; 0.16, P = 0.001 for BRSV), suggesting that the test positive animals were not randomly distributed throughout the country. Using the spatial scan statistic with elliptic clusters and a maximum cluster size of 10% of the population at risk identified two areas with higher prevalence of BCV than expected: Skaraborg (central-south part of Sweden) and Skåne (extreme south), as well as one area with lower prevalence than expected: Kronoberg-Blekinge (southeast of Sweden; Figure 3a ). Almost the same high prevalence areas (Skaraborg and Skåne) were identified as being clusters for BRSV. Two areas with low prevalence of BRSV were also detected: Kronoberg-Blekinge and Värmland-Dalarna (middle-west) (Figure 3b ). The characteristics of the identified clusters are displayed in Table  1 . The beef-herd density per PCA is presented in Figure 4 . Among the 34 PCAs included in the clusters of high BCV prevalence, 20 had a beef herd-density >10 herds/100 km2. This proportion was 14 out of 22 for BRSV. For BCV, the risk for a PCA to be part of a cluster of high prevalence was 5.3 times (95% CI: 2.5-11.1) higher if its beef herd-density was >10 herds/100 km2 than if it was <10 herds/100 km2; this risk was 6.1 times (95% CI: 2.4-15.1) higher for BRSV.
