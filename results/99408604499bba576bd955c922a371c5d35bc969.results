The coding sequence for the M protein of CCoV was cloned in the pQE30 expression vector and the recombinant protein with a polyhistidine tag at the Nterminus was produced as inclusion bodies in the bacterial cytosol. After SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining, a protein band corresponding to the expected molecular mass of 30 kDa was revealed in IPTG-induced culture (Fig. 1, lane 2) and in the inclusion bodies fraction (not shown), which was not present either in the culture before the induction (Fig. 1, lanes 1) or in the control culture before and after the induction (not shown). The recombinant-tagged protein was detected by Western blotting using anti His tag monoclonal antibody. It was purified by electroelution and the purity was confirmed by single banding in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, lane 3) . The Nterminal sequence arg Á/gly Á/ser Á/his Á/his Á/his Á/his Á/his Á/ gly Á/ser Á/lys Á/ile Á/leu Á/leu Á/ile Á/leu Á/ala Á/cysÁ/ala also confirmed the authenticity of the rMP. In order to test the reactivity of rMP, Western blotting was carried out using a monoclonal antibody against the M protein of CCoV and both a CCoV positive and a CCoV negative dog serum. The protein band of 30 kDa showed a strong and specific reaction with the monoclonal antibody as well as with the CCoV positive serum whereas it was not recognized by the CCoV negative serum. To test the use of a rMP-based ELISA test, 34 positive dog sera and 16 negative sera were used. The mean and the standard deviation obtained using 16 CCoV negative sera were 0.017 and 0.00325, respectively. Therefore, the cutoff value of ODs was determined as 0.027. Thirty-four canine sera which tested positive by whole CCoV ELISA and Western blotting were determined to be also positive by rMP ELISA. Since the results of rMP-ELISA correlated with the results of the reference tests (whole virus ELISA and Western blotting), the relative sensitivity and specificity resulted unchanged.
