In the current research, eleven broiler flocks with age 5-7 weeks were selected for tracheal swab samples preparation. All broiler flocks were vaccinated against infectious bronchitis virus during the first week of life. Amplification of an expected DNA band (466 bp) from positive control as well as IBV positive swab samples indicated that the RT-PCR reaction has been performed correctly (Figure 1a) . The results showed that 4 out of 11 (36.36%) of the sampled flocks were positive to IBV by RT-PCR. Specific nested PCR were performed on RT-PCR positive flocks and the Massachusetts was specific serotype of infectious bronchitis virus in broiler flocks of Zabol ( Figure 1b ).
