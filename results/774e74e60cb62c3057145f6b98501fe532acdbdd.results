PDCoV S1 ELISA development The ROC analysis based on 210 serum samples with known PDCoV exposure was used for the cut-off determination (Fig 1) . The optimal cut-off for the PDCoV S1 ELISA was a 1:100 diluted sample OD value of 0.34 for which the sensitivity and specificity values were higher than 90%. Sensitivity was 90.6% and the specificity was 94.8%. The diagnostic accuracy of PDCoV S1 ELISA was considered to be high as the area under the curve (AUC) index was 0.98 with a standard error of 0.01. Inter and intra-coefficient of variation (CV) of eight control sera tested with PDCoV S1 ELISA was less than 10%. The intra-assay CV ranged from 2.6% to 4.2% while the inter-assay CV ranged from 5.2% to 9.4%, indicating that the results were reproducible. The assay specificity was determined by using samples positive for antibodies to TGEV, PRCV or PEDV. The obtained PDCoV S1 ELISA OD values ranged from 0.04 to 0.33 (average ± SD, 0.12 ± 0.06), indicating a lack of cross-reaction with other porcine coronaviruses. Among the 90 samples positive for antibodies against TGEV, PRCV or PEDV, only one had an OD value higher than 0.3 for PDCoV. Specifically, PDCoV OD values ranged from 0.04 to 0.33 (average ± SD, 0.12 ± 0.08) for TGEV; 0.05 to 0.291 (average ± SD, 0.10 ± 0.06) for PRCV; and 0.07 to 0.244 (average ± SD, 0.13 ± 0.05) for PEDV.
