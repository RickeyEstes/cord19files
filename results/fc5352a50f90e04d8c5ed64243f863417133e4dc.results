The important predictors associated with MERS recovery was obtained by computing the variable importance associated with different machine learning methods by considering the entire data as the train data. The graphical representation of the variable importance of factors corresponding to various methods are shown in Fig. 1 . It is evident from various plots in Fig. 1 that the four most important factors associated with survival of MERS Co-V infected people are initial status of the disease (istatus), age, pre-existing diseases (predisease) and whether the patient is a healthcare worker or not (hcw). Statistical analysis such as univariate and multivariate logistic regression were also carried out to find the important factors associated with recovery from MERS. The estimate and p-values of the analysis are tabulated in Table 2 . The presence of asterisk next to the p-value in Table 2 indicates that the attribute is significant. The p-values of significant variables are visually encoded. The significance codes less than 0.001, between 0.001 and 0.01, between 0.01 and 0.05, and between 0.05 and 0.1 are represented using the symbol ***, **, * and . (dot) respectively. In the aforementioned table, estimate refers to the log of odds. A negative value of estimate indicates that the variable has a negative impact on recovery and vice versa. It can be inferred from univariate and multivariate analysis that all variables except symptoms and animal exposure are significant in determining the recovery of a patient. Multivariate analysis was again done by taking the top four significant variables obtained from the multivariate analysis performed earlier, and the results are shown in Table 3 . It is evident from Table 3 that all the four variables are highly significant with p-value less than 0.01. It can be inferred from Table 3 that the most significant factor influencing recovery is the severity of the disease (indicated by initial status). The most important factors identified by the various machine learning methods are initial status, healthcare worker or not, age and pre-existing diseases.
