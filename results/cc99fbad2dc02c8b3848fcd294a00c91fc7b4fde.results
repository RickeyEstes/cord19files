A total of 56 participants were enrolled in this study. The mean age of the study participants was 31 years (SD Â± 8.16 years); 80% (n = 45) were 18-39 years of age, and only 20% were older than 40 years of age. The study population was 64% male (n = 36), and the majority of respondents practiced Islam (76.8%). Of the different categories of health care workers interviewed, 66% (n = 33) were community extension workers, and 42% (n = 21) of those had worked for at least 2 years (Table 1) . Over 90% (52/65) of the participants were directly involved in patient case management during the epidemics, but 36.5% (19/52) of these HCWs were not trained in cholera case management; however, the majority was trained in cholera case management. A total of 45% (15/33) were trained for 2-7 days, and 60.6% (20/33) were trained by a government agency. Fifty percent (26/52) of the healthcare workers indicated seeing more than 20 patients per day. Although 76.8% (n = 43) of HCWs felt overworked, 38.5% (n = 20) felt personally motivated to continue providing emergency care ( Table 2) . Approximately 78% (n = 43) of the respondents indicated that they practiced some form of universal safety precaution methods, with over 50% using gloves (n = 23) and hand washing (n = 22). During the epidemic, 66% (n = 35) of health care workers indicated a lack of knowledge of the clinical presentation of cholera. Healthcare workers who knew of other healthcare workers who had become infected with cholera during the epidemic attributed it to hospital acquisition in 78% (n = 14) of cases (Table 3) . Healthcare workers who were trained in cholera emergency response (OR = 3.2; p = 0.09; CI: 0.78-13.44), those who were not overworked (Table 4) . Although 77% (n = 40) of healthcare workers indicated a lack of the equipment necessary to control and prevent cholera, more than 77% (n = 41) were satisfied with the medical intervention and government involvement in the control of the epidemic compared to previous cholera outbreaks (Table 5) . Various challenges in patient case management were reported, including a lack of funding, a lack of emergency response kits, inadequate supplies of the required materials and consumables, inadequate training in emergency response and an inadequate supply of trained manpower. In the overall assessment of the emergency response to the outbreak, the respondents believed that the government should provide safe water, engage in more health promotion campaigns (particularly in rural areas), make the required medical equipment and supplies available to emergency response workers, scale up their prompt intervention and ensure better case management of cholera patients.
