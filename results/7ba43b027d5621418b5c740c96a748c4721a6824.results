A total of 183 subjects receiving HRCT analysis are included for evaluation. The subjects are classified as Group 1 AFB sputum smear positive, active PTB (n = 84) and Group 2 sputum smear negative pulmonary infection patients (n = 99). Table 1 presents the demographic data, and methods of confirmation of smear-positive PTB and non-AFB smear-positive pulmonary infection for all the patients by group and subgroup. There was no significant age difference between the groups. Males comprised the majority in each study group. Co-morbid conditions such as anemia, diabetes, alcoholism, chronic steroid use, uremia, and hypoalbuminemia were noted in the 183 studied patients; however, only the presence of anemia proved to be a statistically significant finding among those with AFB sputum positive, active PTB (Group 1). A history of previous PTB was a significant finding among those with negative sputum smears. Group 1 generated spontaneous sputum for examination (p < 0.001), while a greater percentage of Group 2 patients required bronchoscopy for sputum examination (p < 0.001). HRCT was performed on all 183 patients within 24 h of presentation in the ER, and the results are described in Table 2 . HRCT patterns like ground glass opacity, consolidation, bronchial wall thickening, clusters of nodules, paratracheal adenopathy, interlobular septal thickening, and cavitations were more frequent in G1 (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, HRCT patterns of calcification and fibrosis were more frequent in G2 (all p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in centrilobular nodules and tree-in-bud between G1 and G2 (p = 0.156 and p = 0.781, respectively). The anatomic distribution and numbers of lung segments/subsegments with consolidation, cavitations, and clusters of nodules are described in Table 3 . Consolidation involving an apex segment (s1), posterior segment of the right upper lobe (s2), or apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe (s1 + s2); consolidation involving the superior segment of the right or left lower lobe (s6); cavitation in the apex segment (s1), posterior segment of the right upper lobe (s2), or apico-posterior segment of the left upper lobe (s1 + s2); number of cavitation >1, number of consolidations >2; number of clusters of nodules >3 were more frequent in G1 (all p < 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, consolidations in the apex segment (s1), posterior segment of the right upper lobe (s2), or apico-posterior segment of the left upper lobe (s1 + s2) (p = 0.010); consolidation of the superior segment of either lower lobe (s6)
