Genetic screening of 212 clinically undiagnosed Finnish patients identified five novel disease variants in TBD-associated genes in three patients and a brother of one of the patients ( Fig. 1 , Tables 1 and 2), most of which with no clear pathognomonic signs of telomeropathies. The hematological and immunological characterizations of the patients are summarized in Table 3 . Patient 1 (P1.1) is a 24-year-old male from a non-consanguineous family. He was remitted to WES to search for mutations associated with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, with the identification of a novel variant in DKC1 (c.1218_1219insCAG, p.(Asp406_Ser407insGln)). In early childhood, he had been diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux and urinary tract infections, but never suffered from severe infections. He received normal vaccinations including MMR. From an early age on, his fingernails were abnormal and broke easily. His skin was reddish and easily irritable. The skin changes in his neck and upper thorax were consistent with poikiloderma. At the age of 10-13 years, he started presenting with a recurrent aphthous ulcer on oral mucosa including the tongue. Patchy lesions of homogenous leukoplakia were observed on the dorsum of the tongue and the ventral side. In biopsies, epithelial changes compatible with leukoplakia and candidiasis were found resulting in the immunological workup. He had slightly decreased IgG2 concentration and CD4+ T cell count but otherwise normal results. He had no other cytopenias. At the age of 19 years, Th17 cells were found to be subnormal (< 0.02% of CD4 T cells), but this could not be confirmed in retesting. Family studies showed that an older brother (P1.2) of the index patient suffered from slightly milder skin, nail and oral mucous membrane abnormalities, as well as recurrent genital Candida infections. Genetic testing revealed that P1.2 carried the same variant, confirming co-segregation with the disease. The variant was inherited from the mother, consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance. The maternal grandfather died traumatically at his 40's but is remembered to have had nails and skin changes, as well. To the best of our knowledge, none of the close family of P1.1 and P1.2 has suffered from solid tumors, hematological malignancy, lung fibrosis or peripheral blood cytopenias. Patient 2 (P2) is an 11-year-old daughter of non-consanguineous parents. The WES analysis revealed two novel heterozygous variants in TERT: c.2051A > G, p.(Asp684Gly) and c.3202G > A, p.(Glu1068Lys). Segregation analysis in the family demonstrated that the patient had inherited one variant from each parent, supporting autosomal recessive inheritance. She was born at term but small-for-gestational-age and catching up the normal growth by the age of two. No developmental delays were recorded early in the infancy or later on. At the age of four, she had disorders in swallowing, and oesophageal strictures were diagnosed requiring dilatation. By the same age, mild thrombocytopenia and macrocytosis were detected in the peripheral blood, but the bone marrow showed normal hematopoiesis. As the cytopenias persisted, re-evaluation of her bone marrow at the age of 10 years showed features of myelodysplasia and hypoplastic anemia. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and Fanconi anemia were excluded. Despite extensive immunological evaluation, no immunodeficiency has been detected. She has never presented pulmonary, nail or skin symptoms. She has fair and thin hair. Her older sister (16-years old) did not present any symptoms. None of her close relatives were diagnosed with cancer or classical DKC. Patient 3 (P3) is a 2-year-old boy of non-consanguineous parents. He was analyzed by WES due to immunodeficiency and the occurrence of opportunistic infections, identifying two novel heterozygous variants in RTEL1: c.1721G > C, p.Arg574Pro (confirmed at RNA transcript level) and c.3724_3725delTG, p.(Cys1242Cysfs*18). Both variants are rare in the population and segregation analysis showed that one variant was inherited from each parent, supporting autosomal recessive inheritance. He was born prematurely at gestational week 31 and was small-for-gestational-age (weight − 3.6 SD/ height − 2.2 SD). He received normal vaccinations at 3 months of age. At the age of 7 months, he was hospitalized for fever and pneumonia, and Pneumocystis jirovecii plus metapneumovirus and coronavirus were detected in the respiratory secretions. In addition, cytomegalovirus DNAemia was present with high copy numbers accompanied by retinitis. Immunological work-up revealed a T − B − NK − severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) phenotype. Brain MRI showed atrophic changes in the cerebellum and microcephalia. At the age of 9 months, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with umbilical cord graft was performed due to SCID. Engraftment was with full donor chimerism without signs of graft-versus-host disease. Transient CMV reactivation was successfully treated with antiviral treatments. He had prolonged diarrhea preceding the HSCT, and colitis-like symptoms continued after HSCT needing long-lasting total parenteral nutrition. Otherwise, with the recovering immunity, his pulmonary problems abated and there were no signs of decreased liver function. So far, due to young age and HSCT performed with chemotherapeutic conditioning, we cannot reliably evaluate the status of the hair and skin of this patient. After HSCT, he has been treated by a pediatric neurologist and the parents have received genetic counseling. There is no known family history of immunodeficiency or malignancy.
