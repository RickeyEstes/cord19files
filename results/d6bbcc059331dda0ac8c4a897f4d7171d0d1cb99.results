Among 26 victims (10 men, 38.5%; mean age, 46.2 years; standard deviation [SD], 11.2), 11 (42.3%) had reported the exposure period to HD substances, which was a minimum of 3 months to a maximum of 120 months (median 6 months). Forty-seven family members of victims (21 men, 44.7%; mean age, 42.7 years; SD, 7.6) included 32 (68.1%) parents and 13 (27.7%) spouses. Forty-five bereaved family members (25 men, 55.6%; mean age, 42.8 years; SD, 7.0) included 28 (70.0%) parents and 11 (27.5%) spouses of the deceased. The frequency of psychological responses among victims and family members including the bereaved is described in Table 1 . It was revealed that 65.4% of victims had respiratory symptoms. Anxiety/fear and depression were the most frequently observed psychological symptoms in victims, significantly higher than in the bereaved group (38.5% and 6.7%, P = 0.001; 35.5% and 8.9%, P = 0.003, respectively). Also, the level of anger felt by victims (30.8%) was significantly higher than other groups (2.1% and 6.7%, P < 0.001). With respect to the clinical severity of psychological distress demonstrated by the CGI-S, only 7.7% of victims were classified into the "normal" group, whereas scores of 34.6% of victims 4-5 ("slightly bad" group, possible medical treatment). Moreover, 1.2% of victims scored higher than 6 ("very bad" group, possible hospitalization). Additionally, during the interviews, victims expressed distrust and anxiety regarding chemical substances and concerns about the respiratory aftereffects of HD use, as well as chronic depression including helplessness and decline of self-confidence. Anxiety/fear and depression were the most common symptoms among family members of victims (19.1% and 21.3%, respectively). Although family members of victims had not suffered damage to the respiratory system, they, along with the bereaved, had also experienced respiratory symptoms (21.3% and 11.1%). However, the bereaved showed a relatively higher rate of alcohol/smoking abuse and insomnia than other psychological responses.
