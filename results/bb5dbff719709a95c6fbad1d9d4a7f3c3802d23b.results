For all three markets, a total of 813 public visitors were observed as they attended vendor stalls. Of these, 29 (3.6%) made direct contact with an animal and 222 (27.3%) made indirect contact with a presumed contaminated source ( Table 1 ). The proportion of these visitors that engaged in subsequent modes of contact was 18.7% hand to mouth (H1), 52.2% hand to body (H2) and 19.9% person to person (H3). Figure 2 provides the breakdown of these contact behaviours for each of the three markets visited. This pattern of behavior was broadly consistent between markets with the majority of observed visitors to vendors making indirect contact with animals through touching housing, tables, sellers, money and other merchandize associated with vendors or animals. The proportion of visitors to vendors that engaged in contact behaviours at each of the Figure 3 . The patterns of contact were similar between each of the larger events (Terraristika and Expoterraria); however, at the IHS Show, during the five-minute observation periods, no direct contact with animals was seen. We again emphasize that these data were acquired during numerous five-minute observation periods (a total of 195 minutes of observation) and as such, they provide 'snapshots' of general conditions. Therefore, other relevant additional behaviours may occur that were not observed and recorded. Person-to-person contamination is likely to rapidly increase its representation as presumed contaminated attendees move around a venue and readily form incidental contacts with a large number of people.
