Western blot confirmed the specificity of the anti-NP antibody with demonstration of the NP at a band about 50 kd (Fig. 1) . Immunohistochemistry showed infected bronchiolar epithelium ( Fig. 1 ) in the mouse evident by brown nuclear reaction, whereas the controls with anti-HPV ( Fig. 1) and PBS were negative. On histological review, the respiratory epithelium from the trachea to the bronchioles showed reactive hyperplasia (Fig. 2) . The lungs showed diffuse alveolar damage in the acute phase, with alveolar hemorrhage, edema, fibrin, and inflammatory cell exudate (Fig. 2C) . Reactive hemophagocytosis and activated lymphocytes were noted in the reticuloendothelial system including the hilar lymph nodes and bone marrow (Fig. 2) . The spleen showed lymphoid depletion. The heart and adrenal glands showed focal ischemic necrosis without inflammatory changes. The skeletal muscle showed focal fiber necrosis with sparse lymphohistiocytic infiltration. The liver showed mild centrilobular macrovesicular steatosis. Other organs including the stomach, intestines, pancreas, kidneys, brain, thyroid, and pituitary showed no remarkable pathology. Viral culture of the postmortem lung was positive for H5N1, but cultures on the liver, kidney, bone marrow, and the brain were negative. Immunohistochemistry showed a positive reaction in the upper and lower respiratory epithelium (Fig. 3) and pneumocytes (Fig. 3) . The intensity of reactive pneumocytes was generally low with a maximal intensity of about 5 to 10 reactive cells per high power field (Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope, ×400, field diameter 400 μm). Occasional lymphocytes in the alveolar exudate and in the parenchymal or intravascular location of a few organs such as the tonsil, spleen, and heart were reactive. The small and large intestinal epithelium (Fig. 3) ; hematopoietic cells of the bone marrow including myelocytes, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes (Fig. 3) ; and neurons and astrocytes of the brain (Fig. 3) were also positive. The brain regions studied included cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, midbrain, pons, medulla, and cerebellum. Scattered immunopositive neurons and astrocytes were noted in all these regions except the medulla. All the positive reactions were largely confined to the nuclei. Reactions of the myocardium, stomach, pancreas, kidney, liver, adrenal, and skeletal muscle were negative. The negative controls, including anti-HPV, PBS, and the 2 control postmortem cases, were all negative except for very occasional weak nuclear or cytoplasmic reaction ascribed to endogenous biotin reactions (inset of Fig. 3 ).
