We examined expression patterns of IFITM1 mRNA in the various tissues of the human digestive system (Fig. 1) . Our results showed that the expression level of IFITM1 mRNA was somewhat higher in tissues of the ileocecum than those in other tissues of the digestive system (Fig. 1) . These results suggest that the expression level of IFITM1 gene is stable in normal digestive system. To determine the possible variation sites, in the entire coding regions, and the boundary intron sequences of IFITM1 that include about 2.2 kb of the promoter region, we scanned the genomic DNAs isolated from 24 unrelated UC patients and 24 healthy controls. We identified two SNPs and two variation sites by direct sequencing methods, g.-1920G>A (rs77537847), g.-1547delA (novel) and g.-416C>G (rs11246062) in the promoter region, and g.364delA (rs200576757) in intron 1 (Fig. 2) . The LD coefficients (|D |) between all SNP pairs were calculated, and there was no absolute LD (|D | = 1 and r 2 = 1) among the SNPs of the IFITM1 gene (data not shown). Among the identified polymorphisms, two SNPs (g.-1920G>A and g.-416C>G) were selected for large sample genotyping. The SNP, g.-1275C>T (rs79441268, but not detected in our study), from the NCBI SNP database, was also genotype analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. However, when 192 samples were analyzed, there was only a genotype. These results indicate that the g.-1275C>T (rs79441268) of IFITM1 might be a very rare polymorphism or monomorphism in the Korean population. To determine whether the IFITM1 SNPs identified are associated with UC susceptibility, the genotypes of the IFITM1 polymorphisms were analyzed by the HRM or TaqMan probe method, and the genotype and allelic frequencies between the groups were compared. Although the genotype and allelic frequencies of the IFITM1 g.-416C>G in the UC patient group were not significantly different from those of the healthy control group, the genotype and allelic frequencies of the IFITM1 g.-1920G>A between the UC patients group and the healthy controls group were significantly different ( Table 2 , P = 0.002 and 0.04, respectively). These results suggest that the g.-1920G>A identified in IFITM1 appear to be associated with UC susceptibility. To determine the possible correlation between the haplotypes associated with g.-1920G>A and g.-416C>G of the IFITM1 gene and UC susceptibility, we further analyzed haplotype frequencies of the SNPs in the UC patients and the healthy controls (Table 3) . While the major (AC) haplotypes explaining more than 62.1% of the distributions were identified in the healthy controls, the AC haplotypes (57.8%), out of four possible haplotypes, were identified in the UC patients. However there are no significant differences between the groups (P = 0.239). These results suggest that the haplotype frequency of IFITM1 polymorphisms might be not associated with UC susceptibility. To evaluate the putative functional polymorphisms, we assessed actual promoter activity with the luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 3) . We prepared two reporter constructs that contained the A or G allele of the human IFITM1 gene g.-1920G>A polymorphisms. In the SW480 cells, the luciferase activity in the cells with the A allele in the IFITM1 g.-1920G>A polymorphism was significantly higher than that in the cells with the G allele (P = 0.05). This result suggests that the g.-1920A allele might affect the increased transcriptional activity of the IFITM1 gene in vivo.
