During the study period, the clinical and laboratory datasets for 120 (50%) of 239 MERS-CoV-positive patients were able to be linked. Seventy-three percent were men, and the median age of all patients was 50 years (range 8-86 years); for 19 patients, information about age was missing. Thirtytwo (26%) patients were health care workers, and 65 (56%) were Saudi. Specimens for MERS-CoV were collected in 18 facilities; 59% of specimens were collected from 4 facilities, and the remaining 14 facilities provided <5 samples each. In addition, 15 (13%) specimens were collected at home for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic contacts. Mean and median C t values for the 120 linked MERS-CoV-positive patients for upE were 30.7 and 32.0, respectively (range 15-37). For 118 patients for whom ORF1a results were available, mean and median C t values were 30.8 and 32.0, respectively (range 15-37). The correlation between upE and ORF1a C t values was high (r = 0.94, p<0.001, Spearman ρ). The median C t for the upE target from 106 nasopharyngeal swab samples was 32.0; from 8 sputum samples, 24.5; and from 6 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, was 24.5 (p<0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test) ( Figure  1 ). When restricted to hospitalized patients, the median C t values for nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were 31.0, 25.0, and 26.0, respectively (p<0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). The remaining analysis is restricted to the 102 patients with nasopharyngeal swab samples and known outcome status. Of these 102 patients, 41 (40%) died. The C t values for the upE target for 41 patients who died were significantly lower than those for 61 patients who survived (medians 31.0 and 33.0, respectively, p = 0.009, Wilcoxon rank sum test) (Figure 2, panel A) . Using the composite severity variable, we categorized 48 (47%) illnesses as severe; for these patients, Ct values were significantly lower than for the 54 patients without severe disease (medians 31.0 and 33.0, respectively, p<0.0036, Wilcoxon rank sum test) ( Figure  2, panel b) . Sixty-seven (66%) patients were hospitalized. C t values were significantly lower for the 36 hospitalized patients admitted to the ICU than for the 31 hospitalized patients admitted the general ward (medians 29.5 and 32.0, respectively, p = 0.014, Wilcoxon rank sum test) (Figure 2 , panel C). Of the 61 patients who survived, Ct values were not significantly lower for the 30 symptomatic patients than they were for the 31 mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients (medians 32.0 and 34.0, respectively, p = 0.08, Wilcoxon rank sum test) (Figure 2, panel D) . We found similar associations when we categorized C t values as low, medium, and high ( Table 1) . The findings were similar for ORF1a (data not shown). Age was not associated with C t when assessed either as a continuous variable (r = -0.07, p = 0.48 Spearman ρ) or as quartiles (p = 0.91, Kruskal-Wallis test). Of the 73 patients for whom information was available on days from illness onset to swab sample collection, we found correlation between the days since onset and C t as continuous variables (r = 0.26, p = 0.029, Spearman ρ) (Figure 3) with higher virus load found earlier in the course of illness. Among patients for whom the presence (52 patients) or absence (16 patients) of underlying illness was noted, the C t values did not differ significantly (medians 31.5 and 31.0, respectively, p = 0.48, Wilcoxon rank sum test). For only 13 surviving hospitalized patients was enough information available to calculate the length of hospital stay (median 7 days), and C t and length of stay were not correlated for these patients (r = -0.02, p = 0.94, Spearman ρ). C t values did not differ significantly by hospital in which the sample was collected (p = 0.33, Kruskal-Wallis test). In univariate logistic regression, increased probability of death was predicted by older age, presence of underlying illness, and lower C t ( Table 2 ). In multivariable analysis, being >60 years of age (odds ratio [OR] 11.7, 95% CI 2.00-67.9) and having an underlying illness (OR 5.19, 95% CI 1.08-25) were the strongest predictors of death. Lower C t values remained predictive of death when adjusted for age and presence of underlying illness; the odds of death increased 17% for each 1 point drop in C t (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.35). For the composite severe outcome, the same factors were identified in univariate and multivariate analysis; C t was borderline significant (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00-1.34) when adjusted for age and underlying illness ( Table  2) . We found similar regression results with ORF1a-when we adjusted for underlying illness and age with a positive association between lower ORF1a C t values and death (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04-1.40) and severe disease (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.40).
