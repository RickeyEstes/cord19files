Enterovirus and influenza A virus were not detected in the air samples collected at the short distance (60-180 cm from the head of the patient's bed; Table 2 ). RSV, adenovirus, and M pneumoniae were observed in 7.69%, 11.11%, and 16.67% of these samples, respectively. Enterovirus and RSV were not detected in the air samples collected at the long distance (320 cm from the head of the patient's bed). Adenovirus was found in 67% of the long distance samples, whereas influenza A virus and M pneumoniae were found in only 15% and 17% of these samples, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in the detection rates of any of these viruses or of M pneumoniae between the short and long distance samplings. RSV was detected on all objects tested excepting the television remote control buttons ( Figure 1A) , with the bed rails having the highest detection rate (15.38%). Influenza A virus was found on the call buttons (15.38%) and the door knobs of the bathrooms and ward rooms (10.26%; Figure 1B ). Adenovirus was detected on all 5 object types at very high rates (88.9-100%; Figure 1C ). The detection rates for M pneumoniae were also high; the call buttons and television remote control buttons had the highest rates (both 50%), and the light switches had the lowest rate (16.67%; Figure 1D ). In the swab samples, the median concentrations of influenza A virus (930.15 copies/unit area, P < 0.01) and adenovirus (1893.05 copies/unit area, P < 0.01) were significantly higher than that of RSV (12.33 copies/unit area; Figure 2 ). The concentrations of M pneumoniae in the swab samples ranged from 317.58 to 96,894.9 copies/unit area, and the median concentration of M pneumoniae (3669.52 copies/unit area) was significantly higher than that of RSV (P < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences between the concentrations of influenza A virus, adenovirus, and M pneumoniae in the swab samples. Seventeen patients were excluded from the final analysis because viral or bacterial infection could not be confirmed in their clinical specimens. In these patients, 2 long distance air samples were positive for adenovirus, and all 5 sampled object types were positive for a microorganism in 3 of the 4 patients with suspected adenoviral infections. One door knob sample was positive for M pneumoniae.
