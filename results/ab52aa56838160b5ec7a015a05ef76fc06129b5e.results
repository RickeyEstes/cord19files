After 24 hours of incubation, a total of 2,500 isolates appeared on the air sample nutrient agar plates. Totally, 244 colonies were purified by sub-culturing for further analysis. A total of 21 (8%) of these isolates were from Al-Kakia, 92 (38%) were from Al-Maisim, 55 (23%) were from Al-Sharaia and 76 (31%) were from the waste disposal area. During air sample collection on the first day, the temperature was 37째C and the relative humidity was 68%. The temperature on both the second and third day was 40째C and the relative humidity was 40%. Among the 244 selected colonies tested by MALDI-TOF MS, good identification was obtained for 202 (83%). The most common genera were Bacillus (n = 94, 45%) and Staphyloccocus (n = 55, 26%). We identified 33 different bacterial species by MALDI-TOF MS including 9 different Bacillus sp., 7 Staphyloccocus sp., 3 Pseudomonas sp., 3 Enterococcus sp., 2 Corynebacterium sp. and 9 other bacteria species (Table 1) . We totally detected 22 (66%) different species in the waste area, 17 (52%) in Al-Sharaia, 14 (42%) in Al-Maisim and 7 (21%) in Al-Kakia. Bacillus pumilus was the most commonly detected species (n = 31, 17%), followed by Staphylococcus sciuri (n = 25, 12%), Bacillus cereus (n = 20, 10%) and Bacillus subtilis (n = 20, 10%). B. cereus was the most commonly detected species in the waste area (n = 9, 14%), B. pumilus in Al-Kakia (n = 5, 36%) and Al-Sharaia (n = 8, 19%) and Al-Maisim (n = 10, 22%). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated only from the sites of Al-Sharaia and Al-Maisim. We did not find significant difference between the different species isolated from the waste area comparing to Al-Sharaia (p = 0.3) and Al-Maisim (p = 0.08). Significant less different species were isolated to Al-Kakia comparing to the waste area (p > 0.01) and Al-Sharaia (p = 0.02). Poor identification was obtained for 42 isolates (17%), which were further tested by 16S rDNA amplification and sequencing. The dendrogram of spectra of the unidentified bacterial species is presented in Figure 1 . This dendrogram revealed that the spectra from unidentified bacteria belonged in 10 different clusters. We considered bacteria in each cluster to be representatives of the same species. As a result, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed for only 10 isolates (one isolate per cluster). These species were identified as Arthrobacter luteolus, Arthrobacter protophormiae, Bhargavaea cecembensis, Leucobacter alluvii, Microbacterium esteraromaticum and Planococcus citreus ( Table 2 ). In addition, we found that four isolates exhibited <98.7% nucleotide sequence similarity with Arthrobacter nitroguajacolicus, Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, Pseudomonas bauzanensis and Lysinibacillus sphaericus. This value was lower than the 98.7% threshold required to delineate a new species without carrying out DNA-DNA hybridization [12] . However, these isolates were considered to be new species and named Arthrobacter saudimassiliensis (GenBank No HG931344), Jeotgalicoccus saudimassiliensis (GenBank No HG931342), Pseudomonas saudimassiliensis (GenBank No HG931341) and Lysinibacillus saudimassiliensis (GenBank No HG931343). A. saudimassiliensis was only isolated from the waste disposal area, J. saudimassiliensis only from Al-Maisim whereas P. saudimassiliensis and L. saudimassiliensis existed in Al-Maisim and Al-Sharaia. The spectra for most of the unidentified bacteria were absent from the initial Br체ker database, which at the time of our study contained 4,706 bacterial spectra, while our updated MALDI-TOF mass database contained 6,353. The initial Br체ker database only contained one spectrum for A. luteolus (Table 2 ).
