IBV-pseudoknot induced À1 frameshifting requires a minimum stem 1 length To investigate the in¯uence of IBV pseudoknot stem 1 length on frameshift ef®ciency, we made a series of constructs (the KA series of plasmids) with different stem 1 lengths containing only GÁC (or CÁG) base-pairs. We began with a frameshift reporter construct, pFScass 6 , which contains a fully functional, trimmed version of the IBV frameshift signal (the``minimal'' IBV pseudoknot; see the legend to Figure 1 ) cloned into the in¯uenza A/PR8/34 PB2 gene (Young et al., 1983 ) at a unique BglII site ( Figure 1 ). The position of the pseudoknot in this construct is just upstream of a region of the PB2 gene where signi®cant lengths of ORF are present in all three frames. A frameshift into any one of these frames generates a product with a characteristic size (22, 28 or 85 kDa). This property was crucial for the analysis described here, since we wished to introduce single or pairs of nucleotides into the pseudoknot, which would change the exit phase of À1 frameshifted ribosomes. The founder member of the KA series of plasmids, pKA1 (Figure 1 ), was derived from pFScass 6 by deletion mutagenesis (see Materials and Methods) such that the pseudoknot encoded by this plasmid would have only four GÁC base-pairs in stem 1. The type and number of bases in the loops and stem 2 remained unaltered. The length of stem 1 of pKA1 was by site-directed mutagenesis (see Materials and Methods). pKA1 contains a truncated version of the minimal IBV pseudoknot (white box) cloned into a reporter gene, the in¯uenza PB2 gene (shaded boxes). Linearisation of the plasmid with BamH1 and in vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase yields an mRNA (2.4kb) that, when translated in RRL, is predicted to produce a 19 kDa non-frameshift product corresponding to ribosomes that terminate at the UGA termination codon (located immediately downstream of the slippery sequence UUUAAAC, shaded), and a 22 kDa À1 frameshift product. The 0-frame and À2/ 1 frames are also open (to some extent) in this construct. Ribosomes which enter these frames produce 28 kDa and 85 kDa products respectively. A bacteriophage T7 promoter is present just upstream of the frameshift region; this promoter is employed to generate short, pseudoknot-containing transcripts from BstNI-digested templates for secondary structure analysis. (b) The wild-type (wt) IBV, the minimal IBV and the pKA1 pseudoknots (PK). The minimal IBV frameshift signal present in pFScass 6 is based on the wild-type IBV frameshift signal and is fully functional in frameshifting . It differs from the wild-type in a number of ways; a termination codon (UGA) is present immediately downstream of the slippery sequence (UUUAAAC, boxed) to terminate zero frame ribosomes, loop 2 of the pseudoknot contains 8 rather than 32 nt, the G ÁA mismatched pair in stem 1 of the wild-type pseudoknot is replaced by a U ÁG pair, the G nucleotide of loop 1 is replaced by a C nucleotide and, ®nally, the minimal pseudoknot has no stop codons. Plasmid pKA1 was derived from pFScass 6 by deletion mutagenesis (see Materials and Methods). The type and number of bases in the loops and stem 2 remained unaltered. The predicted stability of stem 1 of each construct is shown (calculated according to the rules by Turner et al., 1988 , using a loop length of 8 nt; see the text). then increased sequentially in single G ÁC (or C ÁG) base-pair steps from 4 to 12 bp and frameshifting measured by in vitro translation in the RRL of SP6-derived transcripts from BamHIdigested plasmids. The base composition of the stem 1 length variants, the predicted stability of each stem 1 region, and the predicted size of the frameshift products are shown in Figure 2 . In vitro translations of the various pKA-derived mRNAs are also shown, along with the calculated frameshift ef®ciencies. As the energetics of pseudoknot formation is not fully understood, the stem 1 stability predictions, calculated according to the rules of Turner et al. (1988) , were performed on the basis that stem 1 formed independently and had a loop of 8 nt. For pKAderived plasmids, ribosomes which terminate without frameshifting synthesise a 19 kDa nonframeshifted species. Ribosomes which undergo À1 frameshifting at the slippery sequence continue translation to produce a À1 frameshift product whose size is 22, 28 or 85 kDa depending upon the exit reading frame, which is determined by the number of nucleotides introduced into stem 1. From Figure 2 (b) it is clear that only certain pseudoknots are functional in frameshifting. Those with a stem 1 length of 4 to 8 bp were unable to stimulate frameshifting above the background noise (<2 %) seen in RRL with pFScass-based constructs (the background polypeptides arise as a result of low-level abberant initiation events; see Brierley et al., 1992) . Frameshifting at pseudoknots with stem 1 lengths of 9 and 10 bp was detectable, but occured at a low level (3 % and 7 % respectively). However, when stem 1 length was increased to 11 bp, frameshifting occured very ef®ciently (pKA18; 48 %). It was apparent that the lack of function of the shorter constructs was unrelated to the predicted overall stability of stem 1, since several of them (pKA7, 9, 11, 13) had stabilities equal to or greater than those predicted for stem 1 of either the wild-type (À12.4 kcal/mol) or the minimal (À16.2 kcal/mol) IBV pseudoknots. To test whether longer stem 1 constructs were also capable of promoting high ef®ciency frameshifting, we prepared a 12 bp stem 1 construct (pKA26) using an oligonucleotide cloning strategy (see Materials and Methods), since we were unable to add an extra stem 1 base-pair to pKA18 by mutagenesis, probably due to extensive regions of self-complementarity in the G C-rich mutagenic oligonucleotides. In this construct, frameshifting was at a high level (40 %) indicating that a 12 bp stem 1 is capable of stimulating high ef®ciency frameshifting. To corroborate these observations, we prepared another series of pseudoknots (the pSL series; see Figure 3 ) with a stem 1 length of 10, 12 or 13 bp. Like the pKA series, these constructs were based on the minimal IBV pseudoknot (pFScass 6, Figure 1 ), but base-pairs were removed or inserted near the top of stem 1 and the A Á U content of stem 1 of each construct was much greater than the equivalent constructs of the pKA series. The results obtained from in vitro translation of these mRNAs closely paralleled those obtained with the G C-rich stem 1 constructs of the pKA series. Only low level frameshifting was seen with the 10 bp stem 1 construct pSL3 (7 %), but the 12 and 13 bp variants (pSL4, pSL7) stimulated frameshifting ef®ciently (55 and 47 %, respectively). In the pSL7 translations, a small quantity of 85 kDa product was unexpectedly observed (in this construct, the À1 frameshift generates a 28 kDa protein) which corresponds to translation by ribosomes in the zero reading frame. This product may arise following suppression (at about 1 % ef®ciency) of the UGA termination codon located immediately downstream of the slippery sequence; pseudoknot-induced termination codon suppression has been described in the production of the Gag-Pol polyprotein of the type C retroviruses (Wills et al., 1991; Feng et al., 1992) . We also measured frameshifting at the intermediate constructs (pSL1, 2, 5 and 6) with an unpaired base near the top of the stem. For those constructs with a stem 1 containing 12 bp residues (pSL5 and 6), high ef®ciency frameshifting was observed (48 %). The two constructs with fewer basepaired residues (pSL1, 10 bp; pSL2, 11 bp) showed inef®cient frameshifting (10 % and 7 %, respectively). From these studies, it seems that ef®cient frameshifting, at least of the IBV-type, requires a pseudoknot with a minimal stem 1 length of 11 bp. However it was necessary to rule out several non-trivial alternative explanations for the lack of functionality of the shorter pseudoknots. These included the possible in¯uence of slippery sequence-pseudoknot spacing distance, the length of loop 2 and the base composition at the start of stem 1. In earlier investigations, the optimal spacing distance between the IBV slippery sequence and pseudoknot was found to be 6 nt; addition or deletion of one, two or three nucleotides to the spacer reduced frameshifting by two-, four-and tenfold, respectively (Brierley et al., 1989 . Hence it was possible that the non-functional pseudoknots of the KA series were simply inappropriately spaced. Given the large number of constructs, it was impractical to alter the spacing distance of all pseudoknots, so we concentrated on spacing variants of pKA13, which, with a 10 bp stem 1, was the closest relative of the ef®cient structures of pKA18 and 26. We inserted or deleted one, two or three nucleotides from the spacer region of pKA13 and tested for frameshifting. As can be seen in Figure 4 , the frameshift ef®ciency varied depending upon the spacer distance tested (3-9 nt), with an optimum at 8 nt. At this optimal distance, the frameshifting ef®ciency was 12 %, about twofold higher than that seen with a 6 nt spacer, but still considerably lower than that seen with the 11 bp stem 1 construct, indicating that the pseudoknot is defective in some other way. The folding of an RNA pseudoknot requires that loop 2 span the helix of stem 1. As we had altered the length of stem 1 in the pKA series, it Figure 2 . In¯uence of stem 1 length on À1 ribosomal frameshifting (part I). (a) The stem 1 base composition of several members of the pKA series. Starting with pKA1, stem 1 length was increased sequentially by single G ÁC (or C Á G) pairs up to 12 bp (pKA26). The predicted stability of stem 1 of each construct is indicated. Also shown is the size of the À1 frameshift product expected for each frameshift construct and the ef®ciency of frameshifting seen in RRL. All constructs possess the same loop 1, loop 2 and stem 2 sequences as in pFScass 6. (b) RRL translation products synthesised in response to mRNAs derived from BamHI-digested pKA1 and mutant derivatives. Products were labelled with [ 35 S]methionine, separated on a SDS-15 % polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. The frameshifted (22, 28 or 85 kDa) and non-frameshifted (19 kDa) species are marked with arrows. For pKA1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11, mRNAs were translated at two concentrations (25 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml). The other RNAs were at 20 mg/ml. RNAs derived from pFScass 5, 6 and 7 were translated to provide size markers for the three potential À1 frameshift exit frames. Plasmids pFScass 5 and 7 differ from pFScass 6 only by the addition of one (pFScass 5) or two (pFScass 6) C nucleotides downstream of the pseudoknot-encoding region. Track M was loaded with [ 14 C]high molecular mass markers (Amersham). A control translation programmed with water was also included. The frameshift ef®ciencies quoted are the average of three independent measurements which varied by less than 10 %, i.e. a measurement of 40 % frameshift ef®ciency was between 36 % and 44 %. RNA Pseudoknot Stem 1 Length and Frameshifting was possible that the consequent change in ratio of loop length to stem 1 helix length may in¯uence frameshifting. To investigate this we increased (by 3 nt) or decreased (by 1, 2 or 3 nt) the length of loop 2 in the context of the 10 bp stem 1-containing construct pKA13 and tested for frameshifting ( Figure 4 ). We found that most loop 2 changes reduced frameshifting to a value of between 2 and 4 %. A modest increase (from 7 % to 11 %) was seen with a loop 2 length of 5 nt. Thus the reduced functionality of the 10 bp stem 1 pseudoknot is not a consequence of an inappropriate loop 2 length. The ®nal possibility we considered was that the base-pairs present at the bottom of stem 1 in pKA13 were inappropriate. A large number of the pseudoknots involved in À1 ribosomal frameshifting have three or four G ÁC base-pairs at the start of stem 1, and there is a preference for G bases in the 5 H -arm of the stem (ten Dam et al., Figure 3 . In¯uence of stem 1 length on À1 ribosomal frameshifting (part II). (a) The stem 1 base composition of members of the pSL series. Mutations were introduced into stem 1 of constructs pFScass 5, 6 or 7 such that stem 1 length was increased or decreased in single base-pair steps. The predicted stability of stem 1 of each construct is indicated. Also shown is the size of the À1 frameshift product speci®ed by each frameshift signal and the ef®ciency of frameshifting seen in RRL. All constructs possess the same loop 1, loop 2 and stem 2 sequences as pFScass 6 except plasmid pSL8, a variant of pSL7 with a destabilised stem 2. (b) RRL translation products synthesised in response to mRNAs derived from BamHI-digested pSL1 and mutant derivatives. Products were labelled with [ 35 S]methionine, separated on a SDS-15 % polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. The frameshifted (22, 28 or 85 kDa) and non-frameshifted (19 kDa) species are marked with arrows. For the pSL series, mRNAs were translated at two concentrations (25 mg/ml and 12.5 mg/ml). Track M was loaded with [ 14 C]high molecular mass markers (Amersham) and a control translation programmed with water was also included. 1990). Indeed, a variant of the SRV-1 gag-pro pseudoknot with a GÁC to CÁG change at the third base-pair of stem 1 (the 5 H -arm of the stem having the sequence 5 H GGCGCC 3 H rather than 5 H GGGGCC 3 H ) showed only 50 % of the wild-type frameshift ef®ciency in RRL (ten Dam et al., 1995) . During construction of the pKA series, base-pairs were added as GÁC or CÁ G pairs in such a way that the predicted stability of stem 1 increased in a reasonably linear fashion as the length increased. A consequence of this was that the composition of the bottom of stem 1 varied. The general importance of base-pairs at the start of stem 1 was tested by replacing the four base-pairs at the start of stem 1 of the pKA18 pseudoknot with other combinations including AÁU pairs ( Figure 5 ). We found that the inclusion of A ÁU pairs reduced frameshifting, particularly when two A Á U pairs were present (pKA40; 7 %) or a single A ÁU pair was included near the bottom of stem 1 (pKA41, 18 %). Replacing GÁC by AÁU at the fourth pair in the stem also gave a measurable reduction in frameshifting ef®ciency (pKA49, 35 %). In contrast, a mutant derivative that contained four GÁC pairs with the G bases all in the 5 H -arm showed the greatest frameshifting ef®ciency (pKA50; 57 %). To test whether the bases at the start of stem 1 of pKA13 (5 H GCGC 3 H ) were thus inappropriate for ef®cient frameshifting, we changed the bottom four pairs to those present in the functional pKA18 (5 H GGCG 3 H ). In the resultant construct pKA27 (see Figure 5 ), frameshifting did increase (from 7 % to 17 %), although it was still at a threefold lower level than that seen in pKA18 (48 %). Nevertheless, this partial restoration of function raised the possibility that other G-rich stretches may be even more effective. For this reason we changed the base-pairs at the bottom of stem 1 of the poorly functional 9 bp stem 1containing construct pKA11 (3 %; 5 H GGCG 3 H ) to the optimal sequence 5 H GGGG 3 H . In the resulting constuct (pKA130, Figure 5 ), frameshifting was increased (to 6 %) but remained at a very low level in comparison to the 11 bp stem 1-containing constructs. These results are consistent with the view that the defect in many of the shorter pseudoknots is primarily one of stem 1 length rather than inappropriate stem 1 stability, loop length or sequence composition at the base of the stem. RNA structure mapping of the pseudoknots of constructs pKA13 and pKA18 Throughout the preceding section, we referred to the various RNA structures as non-functional or functional pseudoknots. Clearly it was important to con®rm that the relevant RNAs indeed formed pseudoknots. As a ®rst step towards this, we introduced a destabilizing mutation into stem 2 of the functional constructs pKA18 and pSL7 (11 and 13 bp stem 1, respectively) and tested for frameshifting ( Figure 5 , pKA33, 17 %; Figure 3 , pSL8, 8 %). In each case, destabilizing stem 2 reduced frameshifting, supporting the idea that these RNAs are pseudoknotted. Such a strategy was not practical for the non-functional (or barely functional) constructs, so we determined the secondary structure of a poorly functional construct (pKA13, 7 %) by chemical and enzymatic structure probing using an end-labelling procedure (van Belkum et al., 1988; Wyatt et al., 1990; Polson & Bass, 1994) in comparison with the functional pKA18 (48 %). Plasmids of the pKA series have an internal T7 promoter just upstream of the frameshift signal, allowing run-off transcripts to be prepared following linearisation with BstN1 (Figure 1 ). Transcripts of 130 and 132 nt were prepared from pKA13 and pKA18, respectively, end-labelled with [g-33 P]ATP, gel-puri®ed and subjected to limited chemical and enzymatic digestion prior to analysis on denaturing 10 % or 15 % polyacrylamide gels. In these experiments, the Mg 2 level was kept at 2 mM (except for imidazole probing, where 10 mM Mg 2 was used) which is the approximate concentration of this ion in RRL (Jackson & Hunt, 1983) , and sites of cleavage were scored only from those reactions where 80-90 % of the full-length RNA remained intact. A representative selection of the individual biochemical analyses and a diagrammatic summary are shown in Figure 6 . The bases are numbered from the start of the transcript. The single strand-speci®c enzymatic probes employed were RNase T 1 , which cleaves 3 H of unpaired G residues, and RNase U 2 , which cleaves 3 H of singlestranded A or G, with a preference for A. To probe double-stranded regions, RNase V 1 was employed, which cleaves in helical regions. RNase V 1 is not base-speci®c but cleaves RNA that is in helical conformation, whether base-paired (a minimum of 4-6 bp are required) or single-stranded and stacked. We also used the single strand-speci®c chemical probes imidazole (Vlassov et al., 1995) and lead acetate (Krzyzosiak et al., 1988; Kolchanov et al., 1996) . It is clear from the structure-probing data that both constructs are pseudoknots and indeed, they appear to be almost identical at the resolution of this methodology. Structure probing with either imidazole or lead (lanes 7-8, 13-14) generated a very similar pattern of bands clearly highlighting the major regions of single and double-stranded RNA. As predicted, the RNA folds into a structure with two stem regions joined by single-stranded loops. Both pseudoknot stems show resistance to chemical cleavage, especially the G C-rich stem 1. Pseudoknot stem 1 appears to be remarkably stable; there was even some partial resistance to boiling in an alkaline solution as seen in the hydroxyl ladder marker lane (lane 1). The stability of stem 1 is also apparent in that the bands corresponding to (approximately) nucleotides C35 to C45 are heavily compressed into a smaller than expected region of the gel. This compression was not greatly relieved by including formamide (to 20 % (v/v)) in the denaturing gels. RNase V 1 cuts were especially evident in stem 1 and were also seen at the top of the 3 H -arm of stem 2 (lanes 10-11). In most cases, the single strand-speci®c enzymes RNase T 1 and U 2 (lanes 4-5, 16-17) reacted as expected, with those slip-site, spacer, loop or downstream region residues predicted to be single-stranded cleaving as such. For example in pKA18, RNases T 1 and U 2 cleaved G and A residues, respectively, in loop 2, but not within stems. Perhaps the only unexpected feature which emerged was the highly reactive nature of the residues at the top of the 5 H -arm of stem 2 to enzymatic probes (G30, G31 and C32 in pKA13; G31, G32 and C33 in pKA18). These residues were predicted to be in double-stranded conformation, but were clearly recognised by single strand-speci®c reagents. The cleavage of C residues by RNases T 1 and U 2 was unexpected, but may be a re¯ection of the highly reactive nature of the adjacent residues. Most of the ®rst arm of stem 2 was also cleaved by the chemical probes imidazole and lead acetate. On the oppo-site arm of stem 2, the complementary bases appeared to be much less reactive to singlestranded probes. Base G55 of pKA13 (or G57 of pKA18) was resistant to RNase T 1 cleavage, despite the reactivity of its partner discussed above. Furthermore, this arm of stem 2 was largely resistant to imidazole or lead cleavage. Only the the last nucleotide of stem 2 of pKA13 (C59) or pKA18 (C61) showed sensitivity to imidazole, and such cleavage is often seen at the ends of helices. These observations are consistent with the formation of stem 2, but a determination of its precise conformation will require further study.
