Prior to exposure, PRRS virus infection-free status was determined on the basis of serum samples collected from individual pigs on À7 and 0 DPE and assayed for PRRS virus and anti-PRRS virus antibodies. All serum ELISA S/P ratios were negative on À7 and 0 DPE, indicating that the animals had not had prior exposure to PRRSV. Likewise, all serum samples collected from pigs were VI negative and RT-PCR negative on DPE 0. Exposure doses administered to pigs ranged from 1 Â 10 4.0 to 1 Â 10 5.2 genomic copies per ml, i.e., 1 Â 10 2.7 to 1 Â 10 3.5 TCID 50 per ml. The latter exposures in each replicate the quantity of virus and collected by the impingers was detectable by qRT-PCR, but below the analytical sensitivity of the microinfectivity (TCID 50 ) assay. Therefore, linear regression analysis was used to calculate the exposure dose. Specifically, the regression line was established by plotting impinger samples with calculable infectious titers (TCID 50 ) per ml vs. corresponding qRT-PCR genomic copies per ml where the regression equation corresponded to: TCID 50 = 2.10 + 0.25 RT-PCR copies. Thereafter, the concentration of infectious PRRSV per unit of air estimated using the following equation: For the dose-response analysis, exposure doses were grouped in increments of 1 Â 10 0.2 copies per ml (Fig. 2) . Following exposure, PRRS virus infection status was determined on the basis of VI and RT-PCR results on serum samples collected from individual pigs on 5 and 10 DPE. Animals were considered infected if serum samples were positive on DPE 5 and 10 by both VI and RT-PCR. All samples from negative control animals tested negative by VI and RT-PCR. The numbers of pigs infected by number of pigs exposed to aerosolized PRRSV by dose are presented in Table 1 . For pigs infected with PRRSV, no dose Â time interactions (P > 0.40) were observed for serum titers (Table 2) .
