To describe quantitatively the structure, dynamics and the operating principles that permit pDCs to initially shield the host against an overwhelming spread of the cytopathic MHV infection, we followed a systems biology approach as outlined previously [11, 12] . First, we decomposed the system dynamics into a set of 'elementary', well-documented processes such as the virus replication, target cell turnover and IFN-a decay, as well as the production of virus and IFN-a by infected cells ( Figure 1A ). This allowed us to estimate the individual decay rates, the virus-target cell interaction parameters and the protective effect of IFN-a. Once these elementary modules of virus-target cell interactions were calibrated, we used them as building blocks to set up an integrated mathematical model of pDC-mediated type I IFN responses against MHV infection in mice.
