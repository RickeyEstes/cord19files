Our initial attempts using the DNA clone recovery system designed by Lawson et al., failed to produce infectious ΔGrVSV with CCHFV-GPC (Fig. 1A) 39 . To overcome this, we used a modification based on a system described by Whitt 40 relying on in trans VSV glycoprotein (G) complementation (VSV-G*) of ΔGrVSV virions. This technique allowed for VSV-G, incorporation into recoveries to facilitate efficient assembly of the rVSVΔG-CCHFV-GPC genome without the need for CCHFV-GPC to participate in initial infection of recovered virions (Fig. 1A) . We recovered a virion containing the CCHFV-GPC in the genome with VSV-G complementation (designated VSV-G*-ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPC), which contributed to a single-cycle infection; unless VSV-G is provided in trans this virus will not replicate effectively in cell culture. After the initial recovery of VSV-G*-ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPC, this virus was passaged on VSV-G complemented BHK cells and passaged onto un-complemented ('normal') BHK cells. We were unable to isolate infectious virus from initial supernatants, however, seven total serial passages of supernatants on un-complemented BHK cells resulted in eventual cytopathic effect (CPE) in cell culture with foci/plaque formations appearing on the monolayers. These monolayers with CPE were harvested for RNA and were stained for CCHFV-GPC antigens via immunofluorescence assay and found to be positive (data not shown). This replication competent construct was designated ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPCΔ (Fig. 1B) . Sanger sequencing of both constructs, using primers for the VSV backbone and CCHFV-GPC ORF, was carried out which confirmed a rVSVΔG-CCHFV-GPC genome and revealed several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (data not shown). Next generation sequencing (NGS) was then performed to confirm Sanger results and further detail the SNPs within the entire genomes of both constructs (Supplemental Table 1 ). NGS sequencing demonstrated fourteen identical single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) preserved between the replication deficient and replication competent constructs; with the replication competent construct possessing four additional non-synonymous mutations within the CCHFV-GPC (Fig. 1B , Supplemental Table 1 ); henceforth referred to as GPCΔ. Two of these mutations within the CCHFV-GPC of the replication competent construct, resulted in the truncation of fourteen amino acids off the C-terminal tail of the G C (Fig. 1B) . To assess the growth kinetics compared to authentic CCHFV, we performed single-cycle growth curve analysis on BHK cells infected with respective viruses at various time intervals up to 96 hrs post infection (hpi) or full monolayer destruction. The rVSV-GFP (wild-type control) peaked in titer at approximately 24 hpi, while CCHFV prototype-strain: IbAr10200 peaked at 48 hpi ( Fig. 2A) . The replication competent pseudotype, ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPCΔ had peak titer, at approximately 36 hpi ( Fig. 2A) . To assess the expression of the CCHFV-GPC in the vector, we performed an immunofluorescence assay, using MAbs that bind to either the CCHFV-G C or -G N . The assay revealed strong in vitro expression of both antigens (Fig. 2B) . We additionally examined if CCHFV-G C was incorporated onto the rVSV virion. We used Coomassie staining and western blot analysis on gradient purified ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPCΔ and semi-purified rVSV-GFP and CCHFV (as controls). Through Coomassie staining, differences in number and mobility of protein bands were detected among the wt rVSV-GFP and ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPCΔ (Fig. 2C , Lanes 1, 2). The CCHFV-GPC recombinant had additional protein bands below 20 kDa with analogous bands detected in CCHFV virion pellets (Fig. 2C , Lanes 2, 3). The CCHFV-GPC recombinant also possessed more pronounced protein bands at 60 kDa, compared to our wt rVSV-GFP (Fig. 2C , Lanes 1, 2). CCHFV structural glycoproteins G N and G C present as bands of approximately at 37 kDa and 75 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2C , Lane 3), on SDS-PAGE gels 7 . There was no observable G N band found on the CCHFV-GPC recombinant at 37 kDa; however, there were two distinct bands between 60-80 kDa in the recombinant (Fig. 2C, Lanes 2) . The ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPCΔ did not encode for a VSV-G (which was confirmed by our deep sequencing shown in Supplemental Table 1 ), nor was it complemented with VSV-G after seven rounds of BHK passaging. A duplicate protein gel was run and further probed by western blotting using a MAb previously identified to be specific for CCHFV-G C by western blot (MAb 11E7, BEI Resources) 14 as there is currently, no available antibody that probes solely mature G N by western blot. These western blot data demonstrated limited, non-specific binding to three VSV proteins as observed in lanes rVSV-GFP (Fig. 2D , Lane 1), but showed strong signal to at least two antigens at approximately 75 kDa and 150 kDa for ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPCΔ (Fig. 2D, Lane 2 ). This Indicated that mature CCHFV-G C and potentially a precursor molecule or an oligomeric form of CCHFV-G C (due to the lack of β-mercaptoethanol in antigen preparations), are incorporated in/on ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPCΔ virions. The semi-purified CCHFV also showed limited non-specific binding to antigens at 57 kDa (CCHFV-NP) and 37 kDa (CCHFV-G N ), but distinct signal at 75 kDa (CCHFV-G C ) (Fig. 2D , Lane 3). To examine the ultrastructure of the ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPCΔ, transmission electron microscopy studies were conducted. Particles of rVSV-GFP ('wild-type' VSV electron microscopy control) were observed between 170-200 nm (Fig. 2E , Top). Consistent with other rVSV pseudotyped with bunyavirus GP 28 , our ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPCΔ pseudotype maintained rhabdovirus morphology and classical bullet shape with coiled intra-virion structure (Fig. 2E , Bottom). Particles were observed to have lengths ranging between 210-260 nm (Fig. 2E , Bottom). This apparent length increase of the ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPCΔ is likely due to the genome containing approximately 4,000 extra nucleotides in comparison to the rVSV-GFP genome (which is also slightly larger than native wild-type VSV Indiana [GenBank number NC_001560.1]). Additionally, immunolabeling of ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPCΔ was employed with MAb to CCHFV-G C and counterstained with 15 nm gold conjugated secondary MAb (Fig. 2E, Bottom) . Immunolabeling demonstrated labeling of G C spikes on the virion surface of ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPCΔ (Fig. 2E, Bottom) . With the data supporting that the replication competent construct expressed CCHFV-GP in vitro and additionally expressed CCHFV-G C on the surface of the virion, an in vivo study was designed to test the ability of the construct to function as an experimental vaccine. The STAT-1 −/− mouse model for CCHFV was selected to test these constructs for protective efficacy 19 . In pilot studies (Supplemental Fig. 1 ) the replication deficient construct (VSV-G*-ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPC), failed to provide protection; however the replication competent (ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPCΔ) construct did demonstrate some protection depending on dose. Based on the results of these initial pilot studies, we elected to adjust vaccine and challenge doses, and administered 10 7 pfu/dose of the replication competent virus (ΔGrVSV-CCHFV-GPCΔ) to prime and boosted groups of five STAT-1 −/− mice, respectively (Fig. 3) . As a control, we used PBS as a mock vaccination. A single mouse succumbed in the boosted group (leaving only four mice to be challenged in the boosted group) the day of boosting. At 35 days post prime, all mice were challenged with 50 pfu of CCHFV strain Turkey2004 and were monitored for clinical signs, weights, and temperatures. We challenged with a human/clinical strain, Turkey200406546, designated throughout this work as Turkey2004; which has previously been published in GenBank with the accession numbers KY362517 (S-segment), KY362519 (M-segment), and KY362515 (L-segment) 41 . Mean time-to-death (MTD) was 5.6 days post infection (dpi), with a standard deviation (SD) +/− 0.55 dpi as demonstrated with the PBS control group (Fig. 4A ). For both prime and boosted groups, 100% protection was observed out to 35 dpi (Fig. 4A) . The prime www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and PBS group displayed weight loss, while the boosted group did not show weight loss (Fig. 4B ). All three groups displayed elevated temperatures for the first three days post challenge (Fig. 4C) . These results indicate that the primed group showed a marked illness, while the boosted group did not display observable disease. To examine the humoral response in vaccinated mice, sera from these groups were analyzed for both IgG to CCHFV-GP and for the presence of CCHFV neutralizing antibodies. A separate group of animals was vaccinated (n = 5, per group) at similar prime/boost doses and bled at days −35 and −21 to assess pre-challenged immune status. Circulating IgGs to CCHFV-GP were detected in sera of both vaccinated groups, beginning at day −21 and were found to have increased substantially at the end of study (Fig. 5A) . Curiously, at the study end point, the prime group displayed higher titers compared to the prime plus boosted group (Fig. 5A ). This indicates the prime only group had a higher concentration of IgG at the study endpoint which recognized CCHFV-GP, compared to the boosted group. The reciprocal titer of the PBS group had negligible IgG responses to CCHFV-GP (Fig. 5A) . To determine the neutralizing activity of these sera, a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was carried out using the Turkey2004 challenge isolate. As depicted in Fig. 5B , the prime only group had neutralizing antibody titers with a PRNT 50 of < 1:1,280 and the boosted group a PRNT 50 of < 1:320 at the study endpoint (Fig. 5B ). Our PRNT positive control, hyper-immune mouse ascitic fluid (HMAF, kindly provided by T. Ksiazek, Galveston, Texas) raised against CCHFV exposed mice, showed a PRNT 50 of < 1:160 while the PBS control mice did not demonstrate a PRNT 50 value (Fig. 5B ). Particle preparations were stained with α-CCHFV-G C MAb 11E7 using an HRP-conjugated secondary.

Samples were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde. Images were adjusted for brightness, contrast, and formatted for size for display purposes. Coomassie gel and western blot images were cropped from the same image file at same imaging parameters for ease of viewing. Gel and blots originals are available in supplemental information.

The control cohort had marked CCHFV-NP immunolabeling in hepatocytes within the liver sections (Fig. 6A ) while liver sections from the prime only and boosted cohorts had no observable www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ CCHFV-NP immunolabeling (Fig. 6A,B) . We further examined the spleen tissue sections and observed that the control cohort had marked CCHFV immunolabeling in mononuclear cells (Fig. 6D) , and that the prime cohort had a cytoplasmic, mild, and diffuse immunolabeling of mononuclear cells primarily in the red pulp (Fig. 6E ). The boosted cohort had no specific CCHFV immunolabeling within the spleen sections (Fig. 6F ).
