No significant age differences were observed between the MBT (mean ± SD: 35.0 ± 8.20) and control (mean ± SD: 36.6 ± 7.6) groups. There were no significant baseline differences between the two groups with regard to stress, emotional intelligence, resilience, anger, positive or negative affect, total occupational stress and coping strategies such as problem-solving and avoidance. The MBT group showed significantly lower social-support coping than the control group at baseline (p = 0.023). To investigate whether occupational stress in the work environment remained similar over the duration of the study, we analyzed variations in occupational stress at 4 weeks and 8 weeks, using a Student's t-test to compare scores between the MBT and control groups at these times. Total occupational stress did not exhibit any significant between-group differences at either 4 or 8 weeks ( Table 1 ). The factor of interpersonal conflict in occupational stress exhibited a significant difference between the MBT and control groups ( Table 1 , p = 0.040) only at the 4-week mark, not at 8 weeks. The remaining factors of occupational stress did not exhibit any significant differences between the two groups at either 4 or 8 weeks ( Table 1) . Effects of MBT on stress, coping strategies, emotional intelligence, and resilience Next, the interaction effects (time x group) were assessed using rmANOVA, followed by tests of within-subjects contrasts comparing baseline vs. 4 weeks, baseline vs. 8 weeks, and 4 weeks vs. 8 weeks. A significant time x group interaction effect (p = 0.002) in total stress level was found, with the contrast test yielding a significant time x group interaction (Fig 2A) when comparing baseline vs. 4 weeks (p = 0.014) and baseline vs. 8 weeks (p = 0.002). Tension, frustration, anger, depression, somatization of stress factors excluding fatigue and aggression showed significant time x group interaction effects (Table 2) , demonstrating differences in changes over time between the two groups. Contrast tests using rmANOVA showed a significant time x group interaction with regard to levels of frustration and anger when comparing baseline vs. 8 weeks, but not when comparing baseline vs. 4 weeks, implying that sufficient training time (between 4 and 8 weeks) was needed to observe a reduction in these symptoms ( Table 2) . Contrast tests using rmANOVA further showed significant time x group interactions with regard to tension, depression, and somatization of stress factors when comparing baseline vs. 4 weeks and baseline vs. 8 weeks (Table 2) . During the 8-week experimental period, significant changes were observed in total stress levels (Fig 2A) and most of the factors related to stress (Table 2) . A significant time x group interaction was found with regard to problem-solving coping ( Fig  2B, p = 0 .019), with contrast tests yielding significant interaction effects when comparing baseline vs. 4 weeks (p = 0.014) and baseline vs. 8 weeks (p = 0.028), demonstrating the enhancement of coping strategies among the MBT participants compared with the control group. In addition, a significant time x group interaction was found in social-support coping ( Table 2 , p = 0.003) indicating that over the course of the 8-week program, significant improvements in coping strategies were observed among MBT participants compared with the control group ( Fig 2B, Table 2 ). A significant time x group interaction was found with regard to emotional intelligence ( Fig  3A, p = 0 .039), with contrast tests indicating a significant interaction effect when comparing baseline vs. 8 weeks (p = 0.022), but not for baseline vs. 4 weeks (Fig 3A) , demonstrating an improvement over time in emotional intelligence among MBT participants compared with the control group. Significant time x group interactions were found in emotional thinking (p = 0.036) and emotion regulation (p = 0.033); the results of contrast tests are presented in Table 2 . A significant time x group interaction was found with regard to resilience (Fig 3B, (Fig 3B) . The detailed rmANOVA results for various factors related to resilience are shown in Table 2 .
