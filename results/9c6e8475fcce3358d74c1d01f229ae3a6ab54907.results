There were 143 patients with exacerbation of airways disease in the POCT group (62 with asthma and 81 with COPD) and 118 (83%) of these received antibiotics. There were 140 patients with exacerbation of airways disease in the control group (57 with asthma and 83 with COPD) and 111 (79%) of these received antibiotics, difference in antibiotic use between POCT and control group of 4% (95%CI -6 to 13%), p = 0.55. In the POCT group 62/143 (43%) patients tested positive for respiratory viruses and 49/62 (79%) of these received antibiotics, 81/143 (57%) patients tested negative for viruses and 69/81 (85%) of these received antibiotics, difference in antibiotic use between POCT positive and negative patients of 6% (95%CI -7 to 20%), p = 0.38. Baseline characteristics of patients testing positive and negative by POCT and control patients were well matched including physiological observations and laboratory results. Only 48/140 (34%) patients in the control group were tested for respiratory viruses using laboratory PCR and the median turnaround time for results was 31.1 h compared with 1.6 h for those tested with POCT, p < 0.0 0 01, Table 1 . Of those testing positive for viruses by POCT and who received antibiotics, 17/49 (35%) had early discontinuation of antibiotics versus 9/69 (13%) in those testing negative and 7/111 (6%) in control patients, p < 0.0 0 01. The median duration of antibiotic was 5.5 days in those testing positive by POCT versus 6.3 days in those testing negative by POCT and 6.4 days in the control group, p = 0.012. The median duration of IV antibiotics was 1 h (i.e., a single dose) in those testing positive by POCT versus 6.5 in those testing negative and 26 h on the control group, p = 0.09. Antibiotic use by POCT result and in control patients is shown in Table 2 . Kaplan-Meier curve analysis for duration of antibiotics is shown in Fig. 1 . Although the curves for the three groups (POCT positive, POCT negative and control) becomes similar after approximately 6 days from starting antibiotics, the curves show that there is a sharp reduction in antibiotic use early on for those testing positive for viruses by POCT, p = 0.034. Of those tested for viruses by POCT 12/143 (8%) were positive for influenza A or B, 26/143, (18%) positive for rhino/enterovirus and 24/143 (17%) positive for other viruses combined (RSV, parainfluenza 1-4, human metapneumovirus and human coronavirus), Fig. 2 . There were 4 co-detections; RSV with rhino/enterovirus Ã—2, Influenza A with Human coronavirus, and RSV with hMPV and human coronavirus. In patients who received the POC test and Fig. 3 . Among those positive for viruses receiving antibiotics, the proportion with early discontinuation of antibiotics was not different between the virus types, 3/10 (30%) for influenza, 6/21 (29%) for rhinovirus and 8/18 (44%) for other viruses combined, p = 0.54. Antibiotic use by virus type is shown in Table 3 . A higher proportion of patients with influenza received IV antibiotics compared to those with rhino/enterovirus or other virus types (53% vs. 23% and 21%, p = 0.044) but the median duration of IV antibiotic or any antibiotic was not different between the virus types, although the small numbers of individual virus types make definitive statement difficult. Survival analysis did not show any differences in early antibiotic discontinuation between virus types, p = 0.53, Fig. 4 .
