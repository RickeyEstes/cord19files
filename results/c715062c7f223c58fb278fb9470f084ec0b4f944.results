An in vivo semidifferential voltammogram showing the detection of the electroactive species for DA and for 5-HT in nucleus accumbens in the unrestrained animal is shown in Fig. la . The neurochemical profile consists of the concurrent and separate detection of DA at 0.14---0.015 V and 5-HT at 0.29---0.015 V. The percent baseline values for DA and 5-HT did not vary more than 10% around the mean. The in vivo electrochemical signals for DA and 5-HT were distinct. The dopamine metabolites, 3--4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and homovanillic acid (HVA) and the 5-HT metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were not detected at the same oxidation potentials as those for either DA or 5-HT. The same tenet holds for the possible interfering chemicals, ascorbic acid and uric acid. Figure lb shows the representative effect of -,/-BL on synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT in nucleus accumbens of the same animal, at the time at which DA impulse flow was significantly inhibited (p<0.05) by 35.8% and 5-HT impulse flow was significantly inhibited (p<0.05) by 50.6%. A distinctive electroencephalographic (EEG) spike discharge pattern occurred in each of the DA and 5-HT in vivo electrochemical signals.Very interestingly, the EEG pattern, induced by synaptic currents, exhibited a reproducible rate constancy, both within same animal studies, in addition to between animal studies, after ~/-BL. Synaptic concentrations of DA increased maximally to 176.25% of control (p<0.05) and this occurred 190 minutes after injection of cocaine. Analysis of the electrochemical signal showed a trend towards baseline in the 4th hour (approximately 50% of the animals had a DA signal returning to baseline). At the 20 mg/kg SC dose of cocaine, those DA synaptic concentrations that did not return in the fourth hour to baseline, did so during the fifth hour (data not shown). Synaptic concentrations of 5-HT reached a maximum decrease to 62.81% of control (p<0.05) at 190 minutes and returned to baseline values (100%) in the 4th hour. Figure 2c shows the effect of synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT when DA impulse flow has been significantly blocked (p<0.0038) and 5-HT impulse flow has been significantly blocked (1, 35, 36) . When ~/-BL was shown to block neuronal impulse flow, both DA levels postmortem and DA synthesis were increased (14) . Moreover, these ",/-BL effects were accompanied by a protection from the expected disappearance of DA in the presence of the DA depletor, et-methylparatyrosine (otmpt) (29) . Thus the prediction about the ability of an axotomized DA neuron, to cause decreased DA release, consequent to a DA presynaptic regulation, was hypothesized (36) . The present findings are consistent with this hypothesis. The data presented here show a significantly decreased in vivo electrochemical signal for DA in nucleus accumbens in the unrestrained rat after intraperitoneal ~/-BL administration. Release mechanisms are clear because the decreased in vivo electrochemical DA signal is inconsistent with known ~/-BL-induced increased DA levels, postmortem (1, 14, 29) . Moreover, release mechanisms are clear because the decreased in vivo electrochemical DA is inconsistent with known ~/-BL-induced increased DA synthesis (36) . The occurrence of EEG spike discharges in ~/-BL voltammograms is consistent with the action of ~/-BL in seizure activity (38) . Finally, this paper presents new findings that -,/-BL-induced EEG changes can be directly detected in vivo and voltammetrically, with a rate constancy. Ample evidence exists to show that the psychomotor stimulant, cocaine, increases synaptic concentrations of DA in mesolimbic neuronal circuitry and that this cocaine-induced alteration in the DA pathway is correlated with the reinforcing capability of cocaine. The present paper shows, however, that when cocaine was administered in the presence of the impulse flow inhibitor, ~/-BL, the in vivo electrochemical for DA was reversed. Since ~/-BL per se caused a decreased DA release, the net result of impulse flow inhibition on the action of cocaine-induced DA changes, was essentially a complete block of the DA response to cocaine. Thus the action of cocaine is dependent on impulse flow, indicating that a release mechanism for DA is important. These data are in agreement with others (2, 8) . Taken together with other studies, which show that cocaine's action is inhibited by blocking sodium channels (21) and by blocking calcium channels (22) , the hypothesis that cocaine's mechanism of action involves a releasing mechanism, becomes stronger. The significance of the data lies in the consideration that the action of cocaine on DA neurons inherently depends on the intact activity of DA neurons and on the amount of DA available at the synapse. Such a consideration may highlight the concept of using tight binding DA reuptake inhibitors for cocaine treatment strategies (30) . Importantly, these findings that cocaine acts directly on a presynaptic terminal mechanism of release for cocaine [reportedly, vesicular (31) ], support the view that vesicular release of DA by cocaine provides protection from gross neuronal pathologies (32) . In the ~/-BL model, as previously reported (35, 36) , the effects of ~/-BL impulse flow inhibition on 5-HT levels postmortem and on 5-HT synthesis were markedly different from the reported DA effects, as seen both in the same predominantly DA neuronal circuitry (14) or in predominantly 5-HT circuitry (9) . Neither of these 5-HT parameters was significantly affected by either ",/-BL treatment or by lesioning. Whereas the ~/-BL model predicted that axotomy would decrease DA release, any prediction for presynaptic 5-HT mechanisms had remained undelineated. This paper presents new findings which show that ~/-BL significantly increased synaptic concentrations of 5-HT. The resuits are reconcilable with presynaptic release, if one possible explanation is an impulse independent release mechanism. Another explanation may be a resultant unmasking of 5-HT reuptake inhibition consequent to release inhibition. Alternatively, 5-HT storage mechanisms may be affected. Cocaine was unable to exert its decreased modulation on 5-HT neurons in nucleus accumbens in the presence of ~/-BL in the unrestrained rat. In the presence of "y-BL, the in vivo electrochemical signal for 5-HT was completely reversed. Since T-BL per se increased 5-HT, the net result was essentially a blockade of cocaine action. Thus this paper presents evidence that cocaine's mechanism of action depends on an intact 5-HT neuronal circuitry. The significance of the data is conceptually similar to that for DA. The action of cocaine on 5-HT is dependent on the amount of 5-HT at the synapse. Therefore, the consequent implications for reuptake inhibitory processes, for genetic vulnerability, for neuronal autoregulation and for differences in gross neuropathology, apply as well. This opens enormous possibilities for tactical manipulation of the synapse in the treatment of cocaine dysfunction.
