Two bat carcasses belonging to two different species, Hypsugo savii and Pipistrellus kuhlii, were provided in 2011 by a wildlife recovery centre located in the Modena province (North Italy). The first bat was an adult female whereas for the second one data on age and sex were not available. During necropsy, no pathological lesions indicative of infectious diseases were observed in the two animals, but dehydration and traumatic injuries such as lacerations of the wing membrane were observed. Samples of intestine from the two bats tested positive by the pan-coronavirus one-step RT-PCR method, and then cell cultures were inoculated with them to attempt virus isolation without success.
