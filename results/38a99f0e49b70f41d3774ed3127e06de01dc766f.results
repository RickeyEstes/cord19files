The overall comparative results were summarized in Table 2 (with graph). In the metapneumovirus group of patients, commonest HRCT features were: ground glass opacities (n = 4, 100%), consolidation (n = 4, 100%), parenchymal band (n = 4, 100%), bronchiectasis (n = 3, 75%), interlobular septal thickening (n = 3, 75%), centrilobular nodules (n = 2, 50%), intralobular septal thickening (n = 1, 25%) (Figs. 1-3). They were predominantly subpleural and basal in location showing segmental lobar distribution in pattern. Bilateral involvement was observed in 50% of the patients. Pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, cavitation and crazy pattern were not identified (0%). In the SARS group of patients (n = 38), commonest HRCT features were: ground glass opacities (n = 35, 92.1%), interlobular septal thickening (n = 33, 86.8%), crazy paving pattern (n = 28, 73.7%), consolidation (n = 26, 68%), intralobular septal thickening (n = 16, 42.1%) and parenchymal band (n = 16, 42.1%) (Figs. 4 and 5) . Bilateral involvement was observed in 44.7% of patients, with the majority showing segmental in distribution. Nodules, lymph node and pleural effusion were rare manifestations, occurring in 8%, 10% and 3% respectively only. None of the patients demonstrated associated bronchiectasis or cavitation. Interobserver agreement was excellent, with an overall mean Ã„ value of 0.90. Both groups of patients consistently demonstrated the presence of ground glass opacities, interlobular and intralobular septal thickening, consolidations and parenchymal band. Crazy paving pattern occurred in 73.7% in the SARS group but 0% in the metapneumovirus group. Bronchiectasis occurred in 75% of metapneumovirus group while 0% in SARS patients. . 1 . 49 year-old man with metapneumovirus pneumonia. Lung window axial plain HRCT of the thorax at the level of the heart shows band atelectasis, consolidation and bronchiectasis in the right lower lobe.
