: IL-10 level (PHA-stimulated) was significantly decreased in acute asthma exacerbation (464 T 628.25 pg/mL) compared with stable phase (859.5 T 796 pg/mL) (p = 0.03). IL-4, IFN-, levels and cytokine ratios for all stimulations were not significantly different among episodes. For PBMC with PHA-stimulated, IL-10 levels were slightly decreased in moderate persistent asthma compared with mild persistent asthma (737 T 691.25 vs. 1,375 T 870.75, p = 0.055) . There were no correlations between severity of exacerbation, asthma score, size of skin prick test and cytokine levels. Conclusion: The decrease of IL-10 production in asthmatic children during acute exacerbation may have a role in asthma exacerbation. The decrease of IL-10 production in more severe asthma (moderate persistent) supports the idea of defective immune regulation of IL-10. Further studies in IL-10 producing cells and treatment to enhance IL-10 responses might be useful in prevention and treatment of asthma. : All fungi and bacteria tested were sensitive to shallomin. The MIC values of shallomin for microorganisms tested ranged from 2Y10 6g/ml. fungi were more sensitive than bacteria to this novel antimicrobial compound. MLC values were slightly greater than MIC indicate cidal nature of antimicrobial at low concentration. Conclusion: Shallot is commonly used as a folklore medicine, and used to cure earache, fever, antidote for snake venom and also as an aphrodisiac. In this study antimicrobial properties of shallot were investigated for discovery of a new antibiotic. Based on this shallomin can be an effective medicine for treatment of dermatomycosis and other infectious diseases.
