Effect of Adding Spleen Cells from Cortisone-treated Mice. Previous work from our laboratory has suggested that susceptibility of macrophages may be regulated by various lymphokines. Therefore, cells from cortisone-treated mice were combined in vitro with normally resistant Call macrophages and the susceptibility of these was tested. C3H mice were given 2.5 mg cortisone on day 0, and the spleens were removed 3 d later. 0.5 × 106 spleen cells were then added to each culture of normal C3H macrophages. Control macrophage cultures received equal numbers of untreated spleen cells from syngeneic mice. Various dilutions of virus [MHV(PRI)] were inoculated into both groups of cultures. All cultures were kept for 6 d at 37°C. The results are summarized in Table I . Genetically resistant macrophages were destroyed by day 3 at 100-fold greater dilutions when they were cocultivated with spleen cells from cortisone-treated spleen cells but not the normal spleen cells. Spleen cells that had been killed by heating to 56°C for 30 min or by freezing and thawing did not alter the resistance of Call macrophages. Direct Addition of HC to Peritoneal Adherent Cell Populations. 10 Table II , however, shows that macrophages from HC-treated resistant mice (which had been treated three times) were 400-1,000 times more susceptible to the virus than those from untreated mice. When the mice were given only one injection of HC, the macrophages were not susceptible. Viral growth was demonstrated primarily by cell destruction, which occurred as early as 2 d, but giant-cell formation also occurred which eventually ended in loss of contact with the culture tube. Virus yield was determined in critical cases. The 1,000-fold increase in susceptibility of the macrophages was routinely observed if three doses of HC ranging from 50 #g to 5 mg were given to the mice, but when 10 mg was used, the cells were only 10-fold more susceptible. Shif and Bang (3) demonstrated that when high multiplicities of MHV(PRI) were Each group of CsH mice (six per group) received three intraperitoneal doses (1 mg each) of the steroid after thioglycollate stimulation, and PEC were harvested 24 h after the last dose. * All macrophages in the experiment were seeded in 16-mm 24-well tissue culture cluster plates and incubated at 37°C with 5% CC.~z and humidified air, given to C3H macrophages, a mutant virus, MHV(C3H), emerged that grew to high titer in both resistant and susceptible macrophages. Following the above findings, macrophage cultures from HC-treated mice receiving 104 LDs0 of MHV(PRI), and which were destroyed by the virus, were assayed for virus yield on CzH and C3Hss macrophages on days 5 and 7 postinfection. Virus harvested from macrophages of HC-treated mice on day 5 postinfection titered 10,000 times higher in CaHss macrophages than in CnH macrophages. By day 7 postinfection, the difference had decreased to 2 logs, presumably because of late growth of the mutant. Because of this, most of the subsequent experiments were limited to observations within 5 d of inoculation. The effect of cortisone is apparently glucoeorticoid-specific. Prednisolone and dexamethasone were administered in the same way as HC: three successive injections, intraperitoneally, in vivo. Two steroids (progesterone and testosterone) were similarly administered. The results showed that the active glucocorticoids increased susceptibility of the C3H macrophages, whereas the other steroids did not (Table III) . Growth Curve of MHV(PRI) in Macrophages from CsI-Iss, Call, and HC-treated Mice. Virus (1.5 × 104 tissue culture infective doses/2 × 106 cells) was adsorbed for 60 min at 37°C in a roller drum. The fluid was then replaced by culture medium. At various intervals, individual tubes were harvested, frozen, then titered for total cellular and supernatant virus. As can be seen from Fig. 1 , there was a sharp increase in virus titer in CzHss macrophages during the first 10 h. There was no rapid initial rise in virus titer in either normal or HC-treated C3H macrophages. However, after about 11 h, the growth rate in the macrophages from HC-treated mice increased rapidly. At 21 h postinfection, virus replication in CzH resistant macrophages started to decelerate, whereas in macrophages from HC-treated CzH mice, it continued to increase. Although virus growth in the latter attained almost the same final yield as in C~Hss, it required ~20 h longer for this to occur. In vivo, however, C3H mice challenged with virus 3 d after cortisone (2.5 mg s.c.) die in just as short, or shorter, time period than susceptible CzHss mice (mean survival time: 1.9 d for C3H; 2.5 d for C3Hss). Earlier, Willenborg (7) had found that C3H mice challenged with virus 1 h after cortisone administration take longer to die than genetically susceptible PRI mice. Evidently, the time of cortisone administration may be a factor in the induction of susceptibility to the virus.
