There were no differences (P > 0.05) in survival of PEDV after the thermal treatment among the 9 feed materials evaluated ( Table 2 ). This observation was consistent at each of the 4 temperatures applied, indicating that the virus resistance to thermal treatment was not affected by the different chemical composition of the feed matrices. Delta values at 70 to 90°C were less (P < 0.05) than at 60°C (Table 3) , indicating higher virus inactivation kinetics at greater temperatures. The shape parameter of the virus inactivation curves were not different among treatments, and values ranged between 0.45 and 0.60, indicating that at each temperature, curves were concave and formed tails. This behavior corresponds to a rapid decrease of virus concentration after short treatment times followed by a plateau where the virus survived for an extended period of time. When comparing the log reduction achieved after 10, 15, or 30 min, no differences (P > 0.05) were observed when the virus was exposed to 60 and 70°C, but greater reductions (P < 0.05) in virus concentration were achieved at 80 and 90°C. A reduction of 1.9 to 2.0 log was achieved at 60°C for 15 min, or 70°C for 10 min, and a 2.2 to 2.4 log reduction occurred after treatment at 60°C for 30 min, 70°C for 15 min, or 80°C for 10 min. Greater than a 3 log reduction was observed when applying 80°C for 30 min (3.4 log), or 90°C for 15 min (3.3 log). The maximum log reduction (3.9 log) was achieved at 90°C for 30 min. During the 10-day incubation period, PEDV titer was reduced by 1.3 log on all surfaces except for stainless steel, in which only a 0.83 log reduction was observed. The PEDV remained viable (10 2 TCID 50 /g) on each of the four surfaces after 10 days of incubation. When delta values were compared, there were no differences among all 4 surfaces ranging from 0.7 and 7.7 days (Table 4 ).
