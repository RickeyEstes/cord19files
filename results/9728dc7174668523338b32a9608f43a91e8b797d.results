Optimization of RT-LAMP assay for NDRV detection. All of the possible variables were investigated to enhance the amplification efficiency. Three replications were carried out for each trial. RT-LAMP was performed under different reaction temperatures from 59 °C to 65 °C. The results showed that RT-LAMP at 65 °C produced very clear and bright bands. Therefore, 65 °C was selected as the optimal temperature of NDRV RT-LAMP reaction. The reaction time indicated that 50 min was adequate for reaction completion. The ratio of calcein and manganese ion (1:8-1:128) was analyzed and the color was obvious at the ratio of 1:12. Consequently, the ratio of 1:12 was selected as the optimal ratio to use in proceeding experiments. The effect of Mg 2+ ion concentration was analyzed. Magnesium sulfate (Mg 2+ ) was added at a concentrations ranging from 0 to 6 mM reaction mixtures containing positive sample. Upon gel analysis, bands were obvious at 3 mM Mg 2+ . When the concentration was greater than 3.0 mM (lane 4~7), the reaction efficiency decreased but tended to be stable. Therefore, 3.0 mM was chosen as the best reaction concentration for NDRV RT-LAMP. Moderately various yields were detected with the different amounts of betaine employed and a concentration of 0.5 mM was found to be proper for a more distinct pattern. The size of the ladder increased as the concentration of dNTPs increased and a concentration greater 0.3 mM was found to be sufficient. AMV reverse transcriptase concentration of 0.14 U/µL was found to be appropriate for the amplification efficiency of NDRV RT-LAMP reaction. The reaction efficiency decreased as the concentration of the AMV enzyme concentration increased. However, a more intense band was observed with 2.5 µL of 10 × Buffer, a 10:1 ratio of inner vs. outer primers (FIP + BIP 2 M, F3 + B3 0.2 µM) and a ratio of 4:1 ring and outer primers (LoopF + LoopB 0.8 M, F3 + B3 0.2 µM) and 0.32 U/L of Bst DNA polymerase (Figs S1; 2-3). Taken together, the optimized parameters of the RT-LAMP reaction system were as follows: 3 mM MgSO 4 , 0.5 mM betaine, 0.3 mM dNTPs, 0.14 U/μL AMV reverse transcriptase, 0.32 U/μL Bst DNA polymerase large fragment, 2.5 μL10 × ThermoPol buffer, the ratio of inner (2.0 μM; FIP and BIP) and outer (0.2 μM; F3 and B3) primers and the ratio of loop (0.8 μM; Loop primer Fc and Loop primer B) and outer primers (0.2 μM; F3 and B3) with an incubation condition at 65 °C for 50 min in a water bath. The RT-LAMP-amplified products were resolved on 2.0% agarose gel and checked by visual investigation employing calcein under UV or the production of insoluble manganese/ magnesium phosphate and by electrophoresis on GoldView TM nucleic acid stained agarose gels under UV light. Moreover, the RT-LAMP products were also visually detected by adding SYBR Green I dye. Analysis of RT-LAMP digestion products. Electrophoresis of the RT-LAMP products showed that all the positive LAMP reactions produced characteristic ladder-like pattern bands on agarose gel. HhaI restriction enzyme digestion and electrophoresis gave a strong band at approximately 100 bp corresponding to the predicted sizes (a mixture of 127 bp and 114 bp) (Fig. 4) . Fig. 5 , only when the recombinant plasmid and RNA from NDRV were present. The RT-LAMP reaction was positive and the RT-LAMP-amplified products were detected, showing a typical ladder-like pattern on gel electrophoresis, which indicated that stem-loop DNA with inverted repeats was generated, whereas RT-LAMP reaction was negative for double distilled water (negative control; NC) and the other viruses tested, indicating that the LAMP reaction was highly specific to NDRV.
