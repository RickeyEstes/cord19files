Yield, purity, viability, and morphology Our isolation process resulted in yielding approximately 2-7 9 10 5 human AEII cells per gram peripheral lung tissue at 60 h of the cell culture. The viability was 95 AE 2% averaged from 28 lungs over 60 h. There was no difference in cell growth among the use of different culture medium but the morphology of AEII cells appeared to be optimal under the condition of SAGM containing 1% FBS but not under that of DMEM containing 1% or 10% FBS or SAGM containing 10% FBS (data not shown). The population doubling level was about 6-fold at day 28 (Fig. 1A) . The cells formed tight junction after reaching confluence as reflected by a constant reading of ECIS (Fig. 1B) . The typical lamellar bodies and microvilli were seen in the AEII cells under the transmission electron microscopy ( Fig. 1C and D).
