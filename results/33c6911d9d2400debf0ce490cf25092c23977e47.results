A total of 92 cats fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Fiftynine cats were male (one was entire) and 33 were female (two were entire). There was no breed predisposition noted, with 80% of the cats being domestic short-or longhairs and 20% purebred. The mean age at the time of MRI was 6.5 years (1 monthe18 years). The median duration of clinical signs before MRI was 21 days (0e951). Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of the cases. Almost half of the cats presented with a chronic history of clinical signs. The condition was considered to be progressive in 63% of cats. In 39 cats, corticosteroids had been administered by the referring veterinary surgeon. The 55 cats tested for FIV and FeLV infection were all negative. The MRI was unremarkable in 32 cases (35%) (Fig 1) . A final diagnosis was obtained for three of these cats as a result of further diagnostic tests: one cat was diagnosed with polymyositis and one with polyneuritis through muscle and nerve biopsies (both cats were presented with tetraparesis and reduced segmental spinal reflexes in the fore limbs and were imaged because of the suspicion of caudal cervical lesions) and one cat was diagnosed with a degenerative myelopathy on post-mortem examination. The remaining 29 cats with no abnormalities found on MRI also had no identifiable presumptive diagnosis. The median duration of clinical signs before MRI in this group was 32 days (1e373) with 16 cases having undergone MRI more than 1 month after the onset of the clinical signs. Figure 1 summarises the outcomes of these cats. There was a history of trauma at the time of onset of the clinical signs in six cases (21%), with five of these cats still alive with an improved neurological status. Eleven cats had abnormalities on CSF analysis (three had increased protein only and in eight cases there was pleocytosis). In all these cats, serology titres and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the CSF for some of the most commonly diagnosed feline infectious diseases (FIV, FeLV, feline coronavirus and Toxoplasma species) were performed and were negative. Repeat CSF analysis was not performed in these cases. Fifteen cats had received corticosteroids within the week before presentation and in five cases CSF was not collected. Four cats (14%) deteriorated rapidly and had to be euthanased within days of presentation (two of these had CSF abnormalities). Four cases (14%) progressively deteriorated over a variable period of time (15e120 days) despite different treatment attempts (all with normal CSF analysis). Six cases (21%) responded to corticosteroid therapy (four of these had CSF abnormalities), and two responded to antibiotic therapy (both had CSF abnormalities). In the 60 cases with abnormal MRIs, the majority of lesions were extradural, and the spinal cord segment most commonly affected was T3eL3 (Table 2) . A total of 29 out of the 60 cats with abnormal MRI had a confirmed diagnosis with histopathology from biopsy samples (nine), cytology from fine needle aspirates (five), post-mortem examinations (six), surgical intervention for intervertebral disc disease and trauma cases (six), serology for toxoplasmosis (one), and PCR for FIP (two) ( Table 3 ). Figure 1 shows the outcome for the cases with abnormal MRI findings. There were two independent predictors included in the final model predicting whether the MRI was abnormal: severity of clinical signs (P ¼ 0.03) and presence of spinal pain on presentation (P ¼ 0.006). Cats with the most severe clinical signs (grades 4e6) were eight times more likely (OR ¼ 0.121, 95% CI: 0.025e0.583) to have an abnormal MRI than cats with less severe (grade 2) clinical signs and 16 times more likely (OR ¼ 0.063, 95% CI: 0.007e0.554) than cats with the least severe (grade 1) clinical signs. Cats with spinal pain at presentation were four times more likely (OR ¼ 0.231, 95% CI: 0.081e0.659) to have an abnormal MRI compared to cats with no pain. It was also found that cats with osteolytic changes on MRI were 15.5 times more likely to have neoplastic disease (based on the presumptive diagnosis) than cats with no osteolysis (n ¼ 57, P ¼ 0.0003, 95% CI for OR: 3.0e79.8).
