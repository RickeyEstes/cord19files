The sequences encoding the G1 glycoprotein of CVV and the N protein of CAL serogroup viruses from the GenBank database were aligned with the MEGA 4 software (Tamura et al., 2007) . Regions that showed minimal sequence variation were chosen as candidate targets for primer/probe selection. Primers and probes were selected with the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) (Table 1) . For detection of the maximal number of CAL serogroup viruses, we selected 2 forward primers, 2 reverse primers, and 1 probe because we were unable to find 1 set of primers that were 100% homologous with all strains. The forward and reverse primers had 5 and 3 mismatches, respectively. To perform quantification of genomic RNA for CAL serogroup and CVV, we prepared transcripts from 2 recombinant plasmids: 1 containing a 60-bp portion of the N ORF of LACV and the other a 301-bp portion of the G1 glycoprotein-encoding sequence of CVV (strain 62-7364). After construction and quantification of the controls for the assay, various real-time PCR kits from several manufacturers were evaluated for the optimization of our duplex assay. These were TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems), qScript One-Step qRT-PCR kit (Quanta Biosciences), FailSafe Probes Real-Time PCR Optimization kit (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies, Madison, WI), Super-Script III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System (Invitrogen), QuantiTect Multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen), and LightCycler FastStart DNA Master Hybridization Probes kit (F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ). The qScript One-Step qRT-PCR kit (Quanta Biosciences) presented a combination of the lowest Ct and highest ΔRn values (data not shown); therefore, we optimized the assay using this kit. Primer optimization was performed with primer concentrations ranging from 300 to 1300 nmol/L, and probe optimization was performed with probe concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 nmol/L. For a TaqMan assay, optimal performance is achieved by selection of primer/ probe concentrations that provide the lowest Ct and the highest ΔRn for a fixed amount of target template (Cirino et al., 2007) . The Ct and ΔRn data taken together show that the optimal CAL serogroup virus primer concentrations were 450 nmol/L each, the optimal CVV primer concentrations were 900 nmol/L each, and the optimal probe concentrations for CAL serogroup and CVV were 250 nmol/L each. Genomic RNAs from LACV and from CVV were quantified, and serial dilutions were made. Duplex realtime RT-PCR assay was performed on serial dilutions of the genomic RNAs. The assay detected a range from 75 to 5.6 × 10 6 gc of LACV and a range from 30 to 2.7 × 10 7 gc for CVV in a linear fashion. Serial dilutions of LACV and CVV cultures were made and spiked into negative CSF specimens. After nucleic acid extraction and real-time RT-PCR, the limit of detection of the assay was determined multiple times. The sensitivity of the CAL serogroup assay was 100% at 75 gc of LACV target and 83% at 50 gc (performed 12 times). The sensitivity of the CVV assay was 100% at 30 gc of CVV target and 78% at 10 gc (performed 9 times). For quantified extracted genomic RNA, the limit of detection was 56 gc for the CAL serogroup assay, and 27 gc for the CVV assay (each performed 6 times). To determine the specificity of the assay, we performed the assay using high concentrations (for each virus, approximately 10 6 gc) of nucleic acid from the following organisms: Cox A9, Echo 9, HCoV 229E, hMPV, RSV, HRV, SARS coronavirus, adenovirus, CMV, EBV, HHV-6, HSV 1 and 2, VZV, WEE virus, HJV, DENV1-4, POW virus (representatives of lineage I and II), WNV, SLEV, C. xerosis, group A Streptococcus, H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, N. meningitidis groups B, C, and Y, N. subflava, S. sanguis, and S. pneumoniae serotypes 10A, 11A, and 18F. No cross-reactivity was observed between the CAL serogroup and CVV primer/probe sets and any of the organisms selected in the specificity panel. PCR results for the panel were all negative; therefore, the assay was shown to be specific upon testing of a wide array of pathogens. CAL serogroup viruses are related antigenically and genetically and are classified based on serologic assays. These assays together with sequence analysis have identified 3 distinct branches: CAL encephalitis, Melao, and Trivittatus complexes (Calisher, 1983; Campbell and Huang, 1999) . To demonstrate that the real-time RT-PCR assay would detect the different members of this serogroup, we assessed detection of 11 different strains, representing all 3 complexes (Table 2) . We performed the duplex real-time RT-PCR assay on extracted RNA from each strain to determine whether nucleic acid from all 11 strains would be successfully amplified by the real-time RT-PCR reaction. Results showed that all strains were detected and amplified. In addition, nucleic acid was extracted from each of 12 isolates of amplified CVV (Table 3 ) and then tested in the duplex realtime RT-PCR assay. All isolates were detected and amplified. The interassay precision of the real-time RT-PCR assay was determined by calculating coefficient of variation (CV) using data from 13 replicates of the assay positive controls. The CV was 3.9% for the CVV assay and 1.7% for the CAL serogroup assay. The intraassay precision was calculated by determining the variation among results obtained for 6 replicates of each positive control viral RNA. For the CVV assay, the CV was 1.4%, and for the CAL serogroup assay, it was 1.6%. Because we were unable to obtain patient specimens that were positive for either CAL serogroup viruses or CVV, we spiked LACV and CVV cultures, at each of 3 dilutions, into negative CSF specimens. Appropriate dilutions of LACV culture were made to obtain high (5.6 × 10 4 gc/250-μL CSF, equivalent to 5.1 × 10 3 gc/reaction), medium (5.6 × 10 3 gc/ 250-μL CSF, equivalent to 5.1 × 10 2 gc/reaction), and low (5.6 × 10 2 gc/250-μL CSF, equivalent to 51 gc/reaction) concentrations. Similarly, a range of virus culture concentrations that included high (6.5 × 10 4 gc/250-μL CSF, equivalent to 5.9 × 10 3 gc/reaction), medium (6.5 × 10 3 gc/250-μL CSF, equivalent to 5.9 × 10 2 gc/reaction), and low (6.5 × 10 2 gc/250-μL CSF, equivalent to 59 gc/reaction) concentrations were selected for the CVV strain 62-7364. These dilutions of virus were then spiked into CSF that had previously tested negative for CAL serogroup viruses and CVV. Forty negative samples were either not spiked or else spiked with 1 of 3 concentrations of LACV and CVV in various combinations (Table 4 ). In addition to these samples, 1 negative extraction control was included in each extraction run. All 40 blinded samples and negative controls were also spiked with a known amount of GFP RNA transcript (2200 The high, medium, and low spikes for LACV were 5.1 × 10 3 , 5.1 × 10 2 , and 51 gc/reaction, respectively; the high, medium, and low spikes for CVV were 5.9 × 10 3 , 5.9 × 10 2 , and 59 gc/reaction, respectively. The mean numbers are from 10 assays, except for the medium spike for CVV, which was from 9 assays. NTC = no template control. gc/μL), which acts as the internal control. RNA was extracted from the specimens using the NucliSens easyMAG system. GFP was then detected in the sample via real-time RT-PCR to determine extraction efficiency and the presence of inhibitors (Table 4) . There was minimal loss in sensitivity after nucleic acid extraction, as evidenced by detection of all blinded high, medium, and low gene copy spikes in CSF samples ( Table  4 ). The negative extraction controls had Ct values of N45, indicating that cross-contamination had not occurred during extraction of any of the samples; consequently, no false positives were detected. In addition, all real-time RT-PCR experiments included positive LACV (300 gc/reaction) and CVV (1000 gc/reaction) controls, which gave Ct values within the respective acceptable ranges (31-34 and 29-32). The Ct values for GFP for all of the samples were also within the acceptable range (35) (36) (37) (38) . In general, if the GFP Ct value of a clinical specimen exceeds the acceptable range, the recommendation would be to repeat the extraction and realtime RT-PCR.
