The mean age of the subjects was 25.2Â±4.0 years old. Table 1 presents the items included in the six factor ATTS with their descriptive data. Table 2 shows the correlations among the PBI scores and ATTS scores. Paternal care was significantly associated with paternal protection, maternal care, maternal protection, and right to suicide. Paternal protection was significantly associated with maternal care and maternal protection. Maternal care was significantly associated with maternal protection, right to suicide, and common occurrence. Maternal protection was significantly associated with right to suicide. Right to suicide was significantly associated with common occurrence, unjustified behavior, and preventability/readiness to help. Unjustified behavior was significantly associated with impulsiveness. Table 3 shows the multiple regression analysis of the ATTS sub-scales with the PBI scores. After adjusting for age and sex, maternal care approached a statistically significant association with the right to suicide. Under the same conditions, maternal care was significantly associated with common occurrence. There were no other significant relationships between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide.
