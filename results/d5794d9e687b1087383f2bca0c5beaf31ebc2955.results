A classic study of Murray's [9] describes the spread of influenza through the population of a British boarding school. During the course of the epidemic, which was traced to the arrival of a single infectious student, all 763 students were eventually infected. The epidemic conforms to many standard assumptions of SIR models: a population essentially closed to immigration and emigration, recovery with immunity, and nearly homogeneous mixing of susceptibles and infectives. Viewing the transmission dynamics as a discrete time stochastic process rather than a deterministic system of coupled differential equations implies a distribution of possible outcomes for the epidemic. By conditioning on parameter values and initial conditions (S 0~7 62, I 0~1 ), Monte Carlo simulation can be used to explore the distributions of numbers of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals, as well as total accrued cost, as functions of time. Murray provides estimates of the transmission rate (b b~0:00218) and recovery rate (v v~0:4), which we regard as the ''true'' underlying parameter values in our simulations. Additional aspects of the transmission function are discussed in the Methods section. We assume that all costs can be expressed in a common monetary cost unit. Other choices of cost functions that address the issue of nonconformable costs (e.g. lives vs dollars) are mentioned in the Discussion. Setting the unit cost to be that of maintaining a single infected individual for one time step (cost per infected, c t~1 ), repeated forward simulation of the epidemic (Figure 1 ) indicates that the mean total cost over 40 time steps is approximately 2100 cost units ( Figure 2 ), attributable entirely to the cumulative cost of maintaining a large population of infected individuals until recovery.
