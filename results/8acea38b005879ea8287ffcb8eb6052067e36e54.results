3.1. The expression of IFN-from HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific CD8 + T cells was enhanced in varying degrees by CpG ODN, PolyI:C and R848 To assess the cellular immune responses elicited by vaccination with HLA-A*0201 restricted SARS S peptides in combinations with CpG ODN, PolyI:C and R848 respectively, HLA-A*0201/K b Tg mice were randomly divided into five groups to accept immunizations. 7-10 d after prime and boost vaccination, mice was sacrificed and cells were prepared from lymph nodes, spleens and lungs. The cells were stimulated with or without cognate peptides plus anti-CD28 to detect HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific immune responses. The levels of IFN-␥ in the cell-free culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. The results revealed that IFN-␥ was almost undetectable when lymphocytes were cultured in medium alone and in PBS groups. Following the prime immunization, there was only modest IFN-␥ production in spleen and lymph node lymphocytes from peptides alone immunized mice (P < 0.01). However, the production of IFN-␥ was markedly enhanced in all of the organs from peptides plus CpG ODN immunized mice (spleen and lymph node P < 0.001, lung P < 0.01). However, only CpG ODN but not The expression of IFN-␥ after prime and boost immunization with peptides plus different adjuvants. HLA-A*0201 Tg mice were vaccinated with different agents in a similar manner as described in the materials and methods. Fresh isolated lymphocytes from spleens, lymph nodes and lungs were cultured with 2 g/ml cognate peptides plus 1 g/ml anti-CD28 and in medium alone as controls. The production of IFN-␥ in supernatants for the prime and boost immunization. Cultures were set up in triplicate. Each symbol represents one data point from one mouse. * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001; n.s., P > 0.05. PolyI:C and R848 promoted IFN-␥ production after the first vaccination. As shown in Fig. 1 , the diamond symbols represented the levels of IFN-␥ from lymphocytes in boosted mice. Interestingly, the production of IFN-␥ in spleen from boosted mice was much stronger than the one in primed mice. In addition, there was modest increase of IFN-␥ in spleen from peptides plus PolyI:C or R848 boosted mice though the level of IFN-␥ in lymph nodes and lungs was almost undetectable. Taken together, these data indicated that systemic striking cytokine production was induced in Tg mice following HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides plus CpG ODN vaccination. Furthermore, the results provided evidence that CpG ODN, PolyI:C and R848 which were potent activators of innate immune responses maybe differ in their ability to prime naïve CD8 + T cells or to induce memory CD8 + T cells.
