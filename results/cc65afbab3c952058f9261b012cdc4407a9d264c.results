The SFTSV-Gn/Gc precursor is efficiently processed into Gn and Gc We first asked whether expression of the SFTSV-Gn/Gc precursor protein results in production of mature Gn and Gc proteins in 293T cells, a highly transfectable cell line previously used to generate infectious SFTSV-Gn/Gc-bearing vectors [15] . For this, cells were transfected with plasmid encoding the Gn/Gc precursor protein of SFTSV. For comparison, Gn/Gc of RVFV and LACV, other members of the bunyavirus family, were also studied. In addition, the glycoproteins of Ebola virus (EBOV-GP) and Lassa virus (LASV-GPC) were analyzed as positive controls for glycoprotein processing, since they are known to be cleaved by proprotein convertases [31,32]. All glycoproteins studied contained a C-terminal V5 antigenic tag for convenient detection by Western blot. For EBOV-GP and LASV-GPC, the expected C-terminal processing products of 20 kDa and 35 kDa were detected in addition to the precursor proteins (Fig 1A) , indicating that these glycoproteins were processed by host cell proteases. Similarly, signals corresponding to the molecular weight expected for mature Gc were detected in cells expressing SFTSV, RVFV and LACV Gn/Gc proteins (Fig 1A) . In addition, a weak signal of the molecular weight expected for the SFTSV-Gn/Gc precursor (116 kDa) was detected. These results indicate that SFTSV-Gn/Gc and other bunyavirus Gn/Gc precursor proteins were efficiently processed into mature proteins under the conditions studied. We next asked whether Gn and Gc proteins can be expressed separately and whether expression of both proteins is required for host cell entry. Mature Gn and Gc are predicted to exhibit almost identical molecular weights of 60 kDa and 58 kDa, respectively, and the corresponding bands were indeed detected in cells transfected with separate expression plasmids encoding these proteins (Fig 1B) . For at present unclear reasons, expression of Gc from a plasmid encoding only the Gc ORF was more efficient than expression from a Gn/Gc encoding plasmid, and Gn was expressed to higher levels than Gc (Fig 1B) . Digestion with PNGase F revealed that Gn and Gc expressed from separate plasmids were N-glycosylated (Gn harbors two consensus sequences for N-glycosylation while three consensus sequences are present in Gc), indicating that these proteins enter the secretory pathway (Fig 1C) , as expected. Based on our finding that separate expression of Gn and Gc is feasible, we next asked whether both proteins are required for infectious entry. For this, we employed a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudotyping system previously shown to be suitable for analysis of SFTSV-Gn/ Gc-driven entry [15] . Particles produced in cells transfected with Gn/Gc encoding plasmid incorporated mature Gc (we did not have the means to analyse Gn incorporation) and were readily able to transduce cells (Fig 2A and 2B) , although with roughly 100-fold reduced efficiency compared to VSV-G bearing particles, in line with our previous findings [15] . In contrast, expression of Gn alone was not sufficient to render particles infectious, despite efficient particle incorporation of the protein (Fig 2A and 2B) . Moreover, particles produced in the presence of Gc did not harbor Gc and were not infectious. Finally, particles produced in cells cotransfected with separate Gn and Gc plasmids were able to transduce cells, although with slightly reduced efficiency as compared to particles from Gn/Gc expressing cells (Fig 2A and 2B) . These results suggest that both Gn and Gc are required for infectious SFTSV entry and demonstrate that simultaneous expression of these proteins from separate plasmids is compatible with infectivity.
