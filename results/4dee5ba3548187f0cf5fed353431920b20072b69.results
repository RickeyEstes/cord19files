GV has been used as a bactericidal and mycostatic agent 13 since before the discovery of antibiotics, and it is also used as a colorant for the Gram staining of bacteria in our microbiological field. First, I determined the MICs of GV against MRSA, VRE, and MDRP. It is well known that GV has excellent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria but not against Gram-negative ones. Therefore, I searched for chemicals which could enhance the killing activity of GV against Gram-negative bacteria. Metals such as Cu 2 , Zn 2 , and Ag 2 have weak bactericidal activity alone, but when GV and CuCl 2 were combined at a ratio of 10 : 1, the killing effect of GV on MDRP showed results eight times better than that of GV alone against MDRP (Table  1) . Of course, no inhibitory effects were seen against Grampositive bacteria with the combination of GV and Cu 2 . A closely related triphenylmethane dye, malachite green (MG) and Cu 2 showed augmentation of antimicrobial activity similar to that seen with GV (Table 1) . Therefore, next, I examined whether GV-dyed cloth had bactericidal activities against MRSA, VRE and MDRP. Samples of 50 l of about 6 10 6 cfu/ml of MRSA, VRE, or MDRP in BHI broth we dropped on sample cloths. After 18 h of incubation, approximately 3 10 4 cfu/ml of MRSA and MDRP multiplied to over 10 7 cfu/ml, and VRE multiplied to 4 10 6 cfu/ml in the control cloth and the cloth treated with CuCl 2 alone, whereas these three bacterial strains were killed and viable cells dropped below 20 cfu/ml in cloth dyed with a combination of GV and CuCl 2 (Fig. 1) . In cloth dyed using GV alone, these three strains did not multiply, but about 10 4 cfu/ml viable cells were still able to survive (Fig. 1) . It was obvious that a combination of GV and CuCl 2 augmented the bactericidal activity of GV in dyed cloth. The results represent the means for three different pieces of cloth in each of the cases. The detection limit for viable cell counts was 10 1 CFU/ml. The maximum SD of the data points shown was less than log10 0.20 As Gawande 14 has emphasized, washing the hands is a most effective method for halting hospital epidemics of various infections. However, it is difficult to get clinicians and other medical staff to wash their hands frequently. Another way to eliminate hospital infections is to reduce the number of drug-resistant bacteria in the hospital surroundings. Given this background, we may anticipate good results from the use of GV-dyed cloths which are effective against MRSA, VRE, and MDRP for dressing materials, gowns, sanitation items, mats in the wards, etc. When tissue culture cells were exposed to a low concentration of GV (0.01% or less), cells were easily killed by destruction of the cell membrane. Consequently, I examined GV's antiviral activity against the influenza virus (the envelope of which originates mainly from the host cell membrane) and its application in dyeing cloths in order to prevent the spread of influenza. Initially, GV concentrations between 0.25% and 0.0004% were tested for antiviral activity. When about 10 6.80 TCID 50 influenza A / WSN / 33 (H1N1) virus was exposed to 0.0063% GV for 1 h, the remaining viable virus was reduced to below 10 3 TCID 50 . In the field of antimicrobial chemotherapy, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) or minimum lethal concentration (MLC) are terms often used for evaluating antimicrobial agents. Accordingly, in this study, I designated as the MLC the minimum concentration which reduced the original viral infectivity to less than 10 4 . The MLCs of GV and CuCl 2 were 0.0063% and 0.025%, respectively. To determine the kinetics of inactivation of viral infectivity, mixtures of H1N1 with GV, GV and CuCl 2 , CuCl 2 alone, I 2 , and DPBS were incubated at room temperature and assayed for residual infectivity at various time intervals. In untreated suspensions of DPBS, viable virus remained for 6 h within 1 log 10 below the viable counts observed immediately after the experiment (Fig. 2) , whereas GV and GV with CuCl 2 produced excellent antiviral activity against the H1N1 influenza virus. When 10 6.80 TCID 50 virus was exposed to 0.0063% GV, the residual viable count decreased to below 3 log 10 within 30 min and below 5 log 10 at 60 min (Fig. 2) . This indicates that the interaction of GV with the influenza virus is very rapid and GV completely destroys the infectivity of the influenza virus within 60 min. This finding was confirmed by electron microscopy. Purified influenza A virus particles showed two major glycoprotein projections on the surface: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase (Fig. 3A) . When virus particles were treated with 0.0063% GV for 10 min, phosphotungstic acid (PTA) penetrated into them and it was obvious that the surface envelopes were destroyed (Fig. 3B) . Because the envelopes were broken, inner nucleocapsids were released, and this was the reason why infectivity was lost. Under these conditions, the suspension became slightly viscous, and virus particles easily made aggregations. At this stage, some traces of surface projections were observed (Fig. 3B, arrows) . After 60 min, the number of virus-like particles observed in Fig.  3B decreased and small pieces of membrane-like structures and their aggregates were prominent. GV and CuCl 2 in combination, at a ratio of 2 : 1 (0.0031% GV with 0.0016% CuCl 2 ), had antiviral activity similar to that of 0.0063% GV alone and more effective than that of 0.0031% GV or 0.0063% CuCl 2 (Fig. 2) . The 0.0016% CuCl 2 was a 16-times lower concentration of CuCl 2 than the CuCl 2 MLC (0.025%), so it was clear that the combination of GV and CuCl 2 had a synergistic antiviral effect. Thus, GV, or a combination of GV and CuCl 2 , was shown to be an excellent disinfectant against the influenza A virus, and these findings could shed further light on applications for prophylaxis against influenza. Time-killing studies for these dyed cloths were carried out with H1N1. Triplicate samples were diluted and virus viability was plotted for each experiment (Fig. 4) . Cloths dyed with a combination of GV and CuCl 2 led to a remarkable decrease of viable virus within 60 min. Residual infectivity fell below 3 log 10 in 60 min and below the detection limit in 180 min (Fig. 4) . The killing ability of the cloth dyed by GV alone was greater than that of the cloth dyed with tannic acid only (control cloth) or that dyed with CuCl 2 alone, but was less than that of the cloth dyed with a combination of GV and CuCl 2 (Fig. 4) . In the dyed cloths, a The results were means of three independent experiments. The detection limit of infectivity was 10 2 TCID 50 /ml. The maximum SD of the data points shown was less than log10 0.20 combination of GV and CuCl 2 seemed to work synergistically against H1N1, and CuCl 2 was necessary as a mordant. As for mordants, zinc and silver had similar synergistic effects on the antiviral activity of GV against H1N1 (data not shown). These results document a major breakthrough, because this is the first time that anyone has demonstrated the antiviral activity of GV and GV-dyed cloth against influenza virus.
