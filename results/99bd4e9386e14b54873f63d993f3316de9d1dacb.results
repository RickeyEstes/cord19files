In 2010 the major ocean industries had a combined value (in terms of Gross Value Added (GVA) 4 ) of US$239.09 billion 5 ; accounting for 4.03% of China's overall GDP. China's major ocean industries employed approximately 9.25 million individuals. Table 3 presents the value added and employment for each major ocean industry within the China's ocean economy. In terms of GVA, coastal tourism is the largest contributor to the overall value of the ocean economy with US$78.33 billion of value added. The marine communications and transportation industry is the next largest category producing US$55.92 billion. When it comes to employment, the marine fishery industry is the biggest contributor, employing 5.53 million individuals, followed by Coastal tourism at 1.24 million and the marine communications and transportation industry at 0.81 million. In China's case, the coastal tourism, the marine communications and transportation industry and the marine fisheries industry dominate the ocean economy. These are categories that have also been found to dominate other ocean economies internationally [19] [20] [21] [22] . It would appear however that the high numbers employed in the fisheries sector relative to the other two dominant sectors is somewhat unique to China's ocean economy. Since the data sources employed to quantify the ocean economy are also a historical record of the economic activities it is possible to analyze the growth (or otherwise) of the major ocean industries over time. The reduced growth rates in these two years reflect the fact that the major ocean industries are vulnerable to unexpected shocks to the economy. In 2003, the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus broke out in China. SARS was the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century [25] . This hit the Chinese economy heavily, especially the industries involved in international trade. Due to their export-oriented characteristics, the ocean industries were greatly affected. The fall in the growth rate of the ocean economy in 2009 was due to the financial crisis of 2007/2008, which is considered by many economists to be the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s [26] . A massive stimulus package from the Chinese government saw the economy through the worst of the financial crisis but still the growth rates of national GDP went down significantly, especially for the ocean related industries. It would therefore appear that the major ocean industries are more vulnerable to the impact of unexpected events (e.g. the SARS outbreak in 2003 and global recession in 2007) than the general economy. Also any events impacting on international trade have a higher impact on the ocean economy. This is not surprising given, as mentioned in Section 1, that seaborne commerce is an essential part of Chinese trade; alone represented 10% of China's gross domestic product in 2008 [2] . [27] . The tourism sector bounced back strongly in 2004 due in part to a rescue package from the government that included tax rebates, employment and training measures and financial aid. Also domestic and pan-Asian tourism boards put in place action plans to revitalize the stricken sector. As mentioned above, when it came to the global financial crisis, the major Chinese ocean industries also suffered severely in 2009, resulting in the decline of two important major ocean industries; the marine communication and transportation industry and the offshore oil and gas industry. The value of these sectors decreased by 8.51% and 39%, respectively, in 2009. The marine communication and transportation industry has long been the dominant support of China's international trade and continues to integrate markets between China and other countries. In the decade of 2001-2010, the marine communication and transportation industry had been growing rapidly due to the fast development of China's international trade. The only year that saw a decrease in the rate of growth of this sector was 2009. The offshore oil and gas industry is also a very important component of the ocean economy in China. In 2010, marine oil and gas output exceeded 50 million tons of oil equivalent, which makes China one of the world's major marine oil and gas producers. China's offshore exploration platforms are distributed both on coastal waters and in its deepwater territorial seas which increases the risk of ocean environmental pollution of the coastal area. The sharp drop in the value of the offshore oil and gas industry in 2009 was in line with global trends and was mainly due to the decline in international oil prices caused by the financial crisis. Table 4 provides a comparison of the Chinese ocean economy value (as a percentage of GDP) and employment figures to other ocean economies internationally. Such comparisons, while interesting, can be misleading as the "marine/ocean" sector does not formally exist in most national accounts and as pointed out by SEMRU [28] figures made available by national marine agencies are often based on different underlying definitions of the sector and different methods of collection of data and classification of activities into different categories. Indeed, it is worth noting that all of the marine economic reports reviewed in Table 4 recognize the limitations of official statistics-gathering procedures in capturing the importance of marine activities in their national economies. In general, the value added by ocean based activity to a country's national income is less than 5% of GDP. In France, Ireland, the US and Canada it is less than 2% of GDP. It should also be noted that the figures for France, the UK and Canada include public sector marine related output such as defense, education and research. France has the longest running track record for publishing national marine economic accounts. IFREMER publishes the marine economics assessment every two years for France. The 2011 version reported on in Table 4 includes separate categories for the private and public sectors of the economy and estimates a total value for its ocean economy of $28.19 billion, representing 1.2% of GDP. The only country with a marginally higher share of marine activity in national GDP than China is Britain at 4.2%. The one major difference between the marine economies in both countries driving this statistic is the relative importance of offshore oil and gas. In Britain, offshore extraction of oil and gas is a substantial industry that makes a very important contribution to the UK economy. Pugh [29] reports a gross value added (at current basic prices) for the offshore oil and gas sector in Britain of Â£19,845 million. This figure represents 43% of the entire value of the ocean economy in Britain whereas in China the offshore oil and gas sector represents only 8% of the total value of the ocean economy although activity in this particular field in China is likely to increase with a number of new exploratory offshore licenses being issued in recent years and proven substantial marine oil and gas reserves [5] . The comparison of China's ocean economy and the US ocean economy is worthy of further examination, given the comparative economic value and influence these two countries share. In 2010, the value added by ocean based sectors in these two countries are almost at the same level. In the USA it was reported as $266.72 billion while in China it was $239.09 billion. However, the share of the ocean based income in overall GDP is quite different, in China it is 4.03% (and this includes only the 12 major ocean industries classified in Table 1 ) while in the US it is only 1.82% (based on the fact that the national GDP of the USA is almost twice that of China). It would also appear that the indicative employment in China's ocean economy is much larger than that of America. The discrepancy between the shares of employment in the sector and the share of ocean based activity in the countries respective GDP would appear to indicate that labor productivity might be relatively lower in the Chinese ocean economy compared to the US ocean economy. However the real explanation is more likely to be reflected in the fact that in China 553,000 individuals are employed in the labor intensives primary production activity that is the marine fishery industry. In comparison, more persons are employed in higher value added industries in the US ocean economy. While shifting up this value added chain is an important objective for the Chinese ocean economy sector (as can be seen in the government's support for emerging industries such as marine energy, marine bio-medicine and marine technology and the fact that industries using marine high technologies have been growing rapidly at an average annual rate of more than 20% in the last decade), the importance of the primary fisheries jobs to rural China in particular should not be underestimated.
