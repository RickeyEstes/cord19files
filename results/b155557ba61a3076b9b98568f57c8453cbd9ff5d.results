Of the 30 children with gastroenteritis, 23 (77 ~o) had rotavirus in their stools. One child had cozonavirus and another a pathogenic E. coil N o viruses or pathogenic bacteria were found in the stools o f the remaining five patients. There were 15 control children, none of whom had diarrhoea and no rotavirus or pathogenic organisms were detected in the stools. However, coronavirus was found in the faeces of one control child. For contact studies, samples o f faeces were obtained from members of five families. In the first family, the father and a 5-year-old brother of the patient, and a sister aged 2 were all found to be shedding rotavirus in large amounts, although father and brother were symptom-free. The second family comprised the patient aged 3 months, and her mother; both .had rotavirus in their stools, whilst a 4-year-old brother was excreting adenovirus. The third family with rotavirus in the stools consisted of a 2-month-old baby and a symptom-free mother. The fathers in the second and third families showed no rotavirus. In the fourth family, the patient, a 2-year-old girl, and her two older s~sters aged 4 and 6, all had rotavirus in their stools. T h e two older girls had slight diarrhoea but were not admitted to hospital. Mother and father's stool examinations were negative ,for rotavirus. In the fifth family, twins aged nine months were both found to be positive for r.otavirus. Whether one twin contracted the infection from the other, or whether both acquired it from a parent is not clear. Specimens from both parents were negative.
