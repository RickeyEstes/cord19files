In Italy, the concentration of critical care beds is at the higher end with 12.5 critical care beds per 100 000 population, compared to the European average of 11.5 [5] . In Figure 1 , using the intensity-approach, Italian hospitals are extremely impacted if we look at the numbers in terms of deaths per hospital bed (left axis). Spain is, next to Italy, the most severely affected country at about 45% (right axis), compared to the benchmark situation. Luxembourg, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France's health systems are also experiencing relatively high pressure, but at this stage still lower than 15%, in comparison to the benchmark situation. In Figure 2 , we show that the number of cases relative to the number of hospital beds is especially high in Iceland and the Scandinavian countries. Indeed, in these countries, the outbreak of COVID-19 has been very high, whereas hospital bed capacity is typically at the lower end for these countries. The pressure on the Icelandic healthcare system is even higher than in Italy. The Scandinavian countries are followed by Spain, Switzerland, Slovenia and Luxembourg, which all face severe pressure on ICU wards especially. But even if we look at all available hospital beds as a measure of health care capacity, most EU countries are relatively close to the Italian situation on March 11, 2020 -our benchmark situation. .
