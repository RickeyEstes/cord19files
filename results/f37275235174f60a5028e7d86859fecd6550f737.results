Increased disease severity in JHMV-infected miR-155 −/− mice Age-matched WT or miR-155 −/− mice were i.c. inoculated with JHMV (200 PFU), and the severity of clinical disease and survival were monitored. JHMV-infected miR-155 −/− mice demonstrated delayed onset of disease compared to WT mice, yet clinical disease was sustained in miR-155 −/− animals compared to WT mice (Fig. 1a) . By day 30 p.i., 85 % of WT and 54 % of miR-155 −/− mice had survived (Fig. 1b) . Assessment of viral titers within the brains of infected mice revealed similar titers 5 days p.i.; however, by day 7 p.i., WT mice had dramatically reduced viral titers, and by day 14 p.i., titers were below the level of detection (~100 PFU/g) (Fig. 1c) . In contrast, JHMV-infected miR-155 −/− mice were unable to control viral replication and demonstrated high viral titers out to 21 p.i. (Fig. 1c) . Collectively, these data indicate that miR-155 expression enhances immune-mediated control of viral replication within the CNS. Impaired T cell response in JHMV-infected miR-155 −/− mice T cell responses are critical for controlling JHMV replication within the CNS [27, 29, [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] . Therefore, we next wished to determine whether increased morbidity/ mortality and inability to control viral replication correlated with impaired T cell accumulation within the brains of JHMV-infected miR-155 −/− mice. Brains were harvested from JHMV-infected WT or miR-155 −/− mice at 5, 7, 14, and 21 days p.i., and immune cells were isolated and immunophenotyped using flow cytometry [47, 58, 59] . Both total CD4 + and virus-specific CD4 + cells were decreased in brains from miR-155 −/− mice compared to WT mice at 5, 7, and 14 days p.i. (Fig. 2a, b) ; however, by 21 days p.i., no differences were detected. In addition, levels of total and virus-specific CD8 + cells were dramatically decreased in brains from miR-155 −/− mice compared to WT mice at 5, 7, and 14 days p.i. yet not at day 21 p.i. (Fig. 2c, d) . There were decreased levels of macrophages at 5 days p.i. in brains of miR-155 −/− mice compared to WT mice; however, there were no significant differences The increase in both clinical disease and mortality correlated with an impaired ability to control viral replication within the brains at the indicated times p.i. c Statistical significance was determined using Mantel-Cox log-rank test or one-tailed, unpaired, Student's T tests. Data are representative of at least two independent experiments; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 Mice from each group were sacrificed 5, 7, 14, and 21 days p.i., and brains were collected. Flow analysis indicated reduced infiltration of total CD4 + T cells (a) and CD8+ T cells (c), as well as reduced virus-specific CD4 + T cells (b) and CD8+ T cells (d), as determined by tetramer staining [95, 96] . In contrast, while macrophage (CD45 + F4/80 hi ) infiltration into the CNS was lower in miR-155 −/− mice at 5 days p.i. (e), the levels were similar at later time points. Representative spinal cords from JHMV-infected and sham-infected mice stained with LFB at day 14 p.i. showed similar levels of demyelination between infected WT mice (35.1 + 4.9 %, n = 4) and miR-155 −/− mice (36.7 + 4.3, n = 4) whereas no demyelination is observed in sham-infected animals (f, g). Data presented are derived from two independent experiments with a minimum of four mice/experimental group. Data are presented as average ± SEM. Statistical significance was measured using unpaired, one-tailed Student's T tests; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 in CNS macrophage accumulation at later times (Fig. 2e) . The degree of demyelination at day 14 p.i. was similar between JHMV-infected WT (35.1 ± 4.9 %, n = 4) and miR-155 −/− mice (36.7 % ± 4.3 %, n = 4) (Fig. 2f, g) . These results demonstrate that miR-155 is necessary for optimal T cell accumulation in the CNS in the context of JHMV infection, and is consistent with previous studies. These findings suggest that the absence of miR-155 during acute viral-induced encephalomyelitis affects either the ability of virus-specific T cells to expand and/or traffic to the CNS [45, 46] . To test whether miR-155 affects expansion in the context of JHMV infection, we immunized WT and miR-155 −/− mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with 2.5 × 10 5 PFU of DM-JHMV [31, 42] and isolated splenocytes at day 8 p.i. to determine the frequency and number of virusspecific T cells by tetramer staining. Similar numbers of M133-147 virus-specific CD4 + T cells were present in miR-155 −/− mice compared to WT (Fig. 3a) . In contrast, there was a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in S510-518-specific CD8 + T cells in splenocytes from miR-155 −/− mice compared to those from WT mice (Fig. 3b) , indicating that miR-155 is necessary for optimal CD8 + T cell expansion. Antiviral T cell activity is muted in miR-155 −/− mice We next examined whether T cell antiviral effector responses were altered in the absence of miR-155 expression. Both cytolytic activity by CD8 + T cells [27, 50, 57, 60] , as well as secretion of IFN-γ by virus-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are important for controlling JHMV replication within the CNS [31, 53, 54, 61, 62] . WT and miR-155 −/− mice were infected i.p. with DM-JHMV. Splenocytes were removed 8 days p.i., and the antiviral activity of virus-specific T cells was determined. As shown in Fig. 4a , virus-specific, miR-155 −/− CD8 + T cells showed reduced (p < 0.05) cytolytic activity compared to WT CD8 + T cells. In addition, secretion of IFN-γ by CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from immunized miR-155 −/− mice was reduced (p < 0.001) compared to WT mice (Fig. 4b, c) . These findings argue that in the absence of miR-155, virusspecific T cell functions are blunted, consistent with previous reports [21, 22, 24, 25] .
