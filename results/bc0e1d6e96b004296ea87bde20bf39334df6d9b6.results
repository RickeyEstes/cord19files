Baseline audits were performed for 49 patients diagnosed in 2012. Audits were repeated after feedback of baseline performance and after implementation of various interventions. Throughout the years 2013 (46 patients), 2014 (39 patients) and 2015 (26 patients), significant improvement had been made in histological subtype identification (94%-100%) and presentation of new cases at tumour board meetings (35%-82%). Testing for EGFR mutation for non-squamous cell lung cancer also increased from 77% to 100% and staging was documented in 100% of the cases (table 1) . Regarding the management course of patients with lung cancer, 100% adherence to approved guidelines was achieved in 2015 for patients with an early stage of the disease. Also, 100% of patients with stage IV and EGFR wild type were treated according to guidelines (table 2) . In terms of management of end-of-life measures, compliance with early activation of the 'no code' status †No stage I and II patients in this year. ‡The number of eligible patients was 2 only, and one of them was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). §In 2012-2014 we were using old data collection form and the questions were more generic, for example, the first question was 'Was chemotherapy stopped prior to death?' The second one was 'Was patient transfer to palliative prior to death?' So the specification to measure 2 weeks prior to death was not obtained for this year and it was calculated later to standardise the measure with 2015 data. ALK, anaplastic lymphoma kinase; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; NA, not applicable; TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor. decreased from 84% in 2012 to 22% in 2015 with a strong need for improvement. Stopping cancer-directed therapy 2 weeks prior to death and early referral to palliative care measures worsened, but the introduction of the new system of parallel standard care and palliative care for patients with lung cancer is expected to help (table 2) . Because of the low compliance revealed in the PDSA cycle 1 in terms of documentation, a progress note had been created specifically for patients with lung cancer. We collected some physician experience using the new progress note to measure their satisfaction. There was a clear consensus about the user-friendly aspect of the progress note. Some physicians expressed support for the addition of the quality improvement measures, such as adding the question 'Is the treatment according to clinical practice guidelines?' at the end of the 'Plan of Management' section. In their opinion, such questions serve as a self-audit checklist to ensure compliance with evidence-based treatment management. The design of the progress note had been optimised in a way that requires both structured and unstructured data entry. Physicians appreciated such design since it incorporates physicians' preferences for having text-free spaces for documenting their subjective judgement as well as for having structured fields to ensure the consistency of information documented for all patients with cancer. Additionally, other specialists, such as research coordinators, preferred the new progress note, since abstracting the data for research studies had been easier. Also, in this regard, having a question asking whether the patient is a candidate for clinical trial enhanced the screening and enrolment process for the research unit.
