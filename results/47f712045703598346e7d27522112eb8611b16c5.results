Seventy individuals (33 male, 37 female) initially consented to participate in this project; however, 13 dropped out after the education portion and before the 3 month assessment.A total of 57 participants completed the 1 year study or came to their natural censored endpoint at 3 or 6 months because of stag-gered entry times. Twenty were randomized to the control group and 37 to the intervention group. Patient demographic characteristics and social and environmental factors (i.e. gender, age, marital status, education, living arrangements, employment status, diabetes care provider source, having an endocrinologist, drinking, smoking, self-perceived poor health, trade-offs and informal support services) are shown by treatment group in Table 1 . Information on type and duration of diabetes was not collected. Based on clinical experience, we know that most patients referred to the DEC are newly diagnosed. Also, it was felt that since patients were randomized to their respective treatment groups, each group was likely to include patients with comparable durations of illness. It is worth noting that the majority of the patients in both the control and intervention groups were cared for by generalists such as family physicians, internists or nurses. Only 31.2% of patients in the control group and 9.1% in the intervention group were cared for by specialists, including endocrinologists and nurses/nurse practitioners who work with an endocrinologist. A very small number of patients (2 in control and 1 in intervention) were actually followed by an endocrinologist for their diabetes. Smokers comprised 18.9% of patients in the intervention group and 15.8% in the control group; 10.8% of patients in the intervention group perceived themselves as having poor health vs. 5.3% in the control group.There were also patients who had to make a trade-off between daily living expenses and spending money on medical care (11.1% in the control group and 10.8% in the intervention group). Most patients (95% in control and 97.3% in intervention) had informal support services.There were, however, no statistical differences in any of the patient characteristics and factors between the control and intervention groups. The baseline laboratory data given in Table 2 showed no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to A1C, FBG, TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C. Mean glycemic control at baseline was similar for both groups: 6.8% for the control group and 6.7% for the intervention group. However, the range of A1C levels was widespread in both groups (approximately 4.0 to 10.0%).The mean FBG for the control group was 8.14 mmol/L and for the intervention group was 8.07 mmol/L.The range for both groups was similar, from euglycemia (5.30 mmol/L) to hyperglycemia (16.20 mmol/L). Lipid profiles for both groups demonstrated suboptimal values and were higher than the clinical guidelines. Mean TC levels for the control and intervention groups were 5.09 mmol/L and 5.00 mmol/L, respectively; the range was similar between the 2 groups. Mean TG levels were slightly different between the 2 groups: the control group had a mean TG level of 2.03 mmol/L (range: 0.97 to 3.59 mmol/L), while the intervention group had a higher mean TG level of 2.29 mmol/L (range: 0.78 to 5.03 mmol/L). HDL-C was similar between the control and intervention groups: the control group had a mean HDL-C level of 0.98 mmol/L (range: 0.09 to 1.50 mmol/L), while the intervention group had a mean HDL-C level of 1.02 mmol/L (range: 0.07 to 1.67 mmol/L). Mean LDL-C was slightly better for the intervention group (2.87 mmol/L; range: 1.43 to 4.75 mmol/L) than the control (3.19 mmol/L; range: 1.29 to 5.36 mmol/L). There were no significant differences when comparing physiological measures between the control and intervention groups at any of the follow-up time points. Patients in these 2 groups seemed to have progressed in the same direction and at a similar rate. When progress was examined within each group, however, there were positive changes in most of the lab measures between baseline and different time points ( Table 3 ).The intervention group's TG level improved significantly from baseline to 6 month follow-up, with a drop from 2.30 to 1.90 mmol/L; the control group, on the other hand, did not show any significant improvement at any time point. A significant improvement was also observed in the intervention group for A1C: mean A1C dropped from 6.7 to 6.5% from baseline to 3 months. However, this significant change was not extended to 6 months or 1 year. There were no significant changes in the control group for this measure. The control group did significantly better with respect to LDL-C level at 1 year (2.47 mmol/L) over baseline (3.19 mmol/L). Figures 1 and 2 illustrate how mean TG and A1C levels changed from baseline to 1 year follow-up. Figure 1 shows that the intervention group's TG level was slightly higher than that of the control group at baseline. There was no significant drop in TG level from baseline to 6 months in the control group. At 1 year, the mean TG level actually showed an increase in the control group. On the other hand, the mean TG level in the intervention group was maintained at 3 months and then dropped significantly at 6 months. This lower level was maintained to 1 year. The comparison demonstrates that the intervention group achieved a better management of TG levels than the control group. Figure 2 shows that the control and the intervention groups had comparable A1C levels at baseline.There was no change in A1C from baseline to 6 months in the control group.At 1 year,A1C actually increased in the control group. A1C in the intervention group, however, dropped significantly at 3 months and then was maintained from 6 months to 1 year. This comparison demonstrates that the intervention group achieved a better management and control of A1C than the control group. Table 3 also shows that patients in the intervention group were also more satisfied at the 3 and 6 month follow-up compared to their own baseline, but the control group did not show a significant improvement compared to its own baseline. It was noted that the absolute satisfaction level at baseline for the control group was higher than that in the intervention group; however, the difference was not statistically significant. The intervention group made a bigger relative gain in this measure than the control group.
