The finding of this study shows higher survival rates after 8 days in the lethal sepsis model with combination mAbs (3H + 5H at 0.5 mg each) at 60%, than single mAbs used as 1 mg of 3H (45%) or 1 mg of 5H (35%) alone. Also, combination mAb and antibiotics (3H at 1 mg + VCM at 5 µg or 3H at 1 mg + DAP at 5 µg) showed higher survival rates (55% and 65% respectively) compared with VCM (20%) or DAP (25%) alone ( p < 0.05). Conclusion: Combinations including ZBIA3H and antibiotics represent an attractive alternative to antibiotic monotherapies currently used to treat S. aureus bacteremia.
