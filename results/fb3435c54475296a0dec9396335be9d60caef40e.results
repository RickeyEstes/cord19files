Upon using the forecast of nursing needs along with current FTEs, shift times, and weekend on/off patterns to obtain the optimal assignment of nurses to shifts for each week of a 4-week period, we obtained a detailed work schedule for all nurses assigned to a unit. A partial solution to this problem is shown in Table 1 . In this table, RT, ET and OT are used to indicate regular-time, extra-time and overtime shift assignments, respectively. Because of work rules, nurses' weekday and weekend work patterns, and because of the fact that staffing levels (total FTE attached to a unit) often include time-off considerations, it is either not possible or not necessary to schedule all available nurse shifts. [Note that time-off requests were not known at the time of developing the schedule.] Unscheduled shifts for a 4-week period for each nurse are shown in Table 2 . The shifts are calculated in terms of standard 8-h shifts. Thus, a 12-h shift counts as 1.5 shifts and a nurse working 0.4 FTE must work 8 shifts during a 4-week period. An unscheduled shift can be utilized in a different unit, or this time can be used for continuing education and training, if work rules and individual contract terms with a nurse permit such an assignment. Realizing that RNs would decide which cohort they would like to join, we randomly assigned each RN to one of the two groups. In absence of data on nurse preferences, random splitting (with equal probability of joining either cohort) serves to simulate a situation in which the RNs are allowed to choose a cohort. Results are reported in Tables 3 and 4 . Table 3 shows the staffing needs' forecast and scheduled shifts (regular-time only) for each day of the week during the week of January 20 and January 26. We also show the actual number of shifts required. On January 26, there is a half shift in the evening because a 12-h day shift was scheduled in the morning. Although there was a matching 12-h shift in the night, that shift was scheduled as an overtime shift. Overtime shifts are not reported in this table because they are not scheduled unless needed after observing the realized staffing need in the previous shift. Table 4 shows the costs of meeting staffing needs in each 2-week period as a percentage of minimum attainable cost (P %). The latter is the cost incurred when all requirements are met with the regular-time hourly rate. The biweekly staffing need (in terms of standard 8-h shifts) as well as the number of shifts short and in excess are also shown. Note, this table does not show unscheduled shifts and their cost is not included in calculating the performance of the schedule because it is possible in many cases to use the nurses' time for other purposes. That is, unscheduled shifts are not charged to direct patient care budget for the unit in question. In some cases, the cost performance of the staggering strategy is slightly worse than the "single-cohort = 4" and no strategy dominates the other. A similar picture also emerges when we examine the number of shifts short (SH) and the number of shifts over (OV). The average shortage per 2-week period is 20.8 shifts and the average overage is 5.0 shifts if the forecast is updated every 4 weeks ( = 4) and staggering is not used. When we compare this to the staggering strategy, the performance with staggering turns out to be slightly worse. At a first glance, the above observations appear counterintuitive because more frequent information updating is not expected to lead to worse results. However, upon careful consideration these Table 4 Biweekly performance of the staggering strategy with the current RN composition. SH = number of shifts short, OV = number of scheduled shifts that are not needed, P = relative cost compared to the attainable minimum cost, and AVG = average.
