Phylogenetic analysis of the H3 HA1 genes ( Figure 1 ) and the N2 NA genes (Data not shown) revealed the existence of at least two distinct evolutional pathways in the human virus lineage, designated as clusters Ha and Hb respectively, amongst the Thai SIV isolates examined. Rat59 and Rat874 belonged to the cluster Ha whereas Chacho03, UT464 and NP586-1 belonged to the cluster Hb ( Table 1 ). The H3 Ha Thai isolates were closely related to a human virus isolated in Thailand in 1997 ( Figure 1 ), suggesting that an ancestral Ha strain may have acquired an H3 HA gene from a human H3N2 strain circulating in the late 1990s. The H3 Hb Thai isolates were estimated to have derived from a hypothetical common ancestor in 1976, which had acquired an H3 HA gene from a human-like H3N2 swine strain circulating in the early 1970s. Similar evolutional pattern was observed in the N2 tree (data not shown). N2 gene of the H1N2 isolate, Sara13021, which HA gene was of classical swine origin, also belonged to the cluster Hb. The branch points of common ancestors for those clusters of N2 genes were estimated to be 1998 for Ha and 1976 for Hb respectively. Two distinct clusters of H1 HA genes of the Thai SIVs that were demonstrated in the classical swine lineage 17 were designated as Cla and Clb ( Table 1 ). The Cla viruses (Rat550 and Rat1480) and the rest Clb H1 viruses were estimated to have derived from a hypothetical common ancestor in 1981 with 95% confidence limits at 1979 and 1983 for Cla and in 1990 (95% confidence limit; 1988-1991) for Clb. PB2 ( Figure 2 ) and N1 NA 17 genes of all the Thai SIVs formed a single cluster, designated as ALa within the avianlike swine lineage (Table 1 ). Regression analysis estimated that they were derived from a hypothetical common ancestor in 1983 (95% confidence limit; 1981-1986) for N1, and 1990 (95% confidence limit; 1988-1992) for PB2. The topologies of the Thai SIVs in those phylogenetic trees coincide with each other, providing supporting evidence for the single introduction of those genes. The PB1 gene of all the strains, except Rat59, showed a similar evolutional pathway to those seen in N1 and PB2 genes. They were derived from a hypothetical common ancestor in 1983 (95% confidence limit; 1980-1987) . The PB1 gene of Rat59 was located in another cluster within the avian-like swine lineage, sharing a common ancestor with European swine viruses isolated between 1995 and 2004. Because of the low bootstrap value (52%) at the node where Rat59 and the other Thai isolates diverged, it was not clear whether or not the PB1 gene of Rat59 had been introduced in another occasion. M ( Figure 3 ) and PA (data not shown) genes of the Thai isolates also belonged to the avian-like swine lineage. Furthermore, at least two distinct evolutional pathways clearly existed amongst the Thai isolates in both these genes. The one that diverged earlier was considered to be an equivalent of the ALa in the previous segments, and the other was designated as ALb ( Table 1 ). The years of divergence of the ALa were estimated as 1990 (95% confidence limit; 1988-1992) for the M gene and 1987 (95% confidence limit; 1985-1989) for the PA gene. Those for the ALb cluster were estimated as 2000 (95% confidence limit; 1999-2001) for the M gene and 1999 (95% confidence limit; 1998-1999) for the PA gene. The cluster ALa of the PA gene was divided into two groups with a low bootstrap value (21%) at the node of the hypothetical common ancestor of that cluster. In addition, NP586-1 possessed M gene of ALa and PA gene of ALb. Nonstructural (NS) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes of the Thai SIVs were contained in both the classical swine lineage and the avian-like swine lineage ( Figure 4 and Table 1 ). Furthermore, two distinct clusters were found within the classical swine NS lineage (Figure 4 ). One cluster, consisting of exclusively H3 isolates (Rat874, Rat59 and Cha-cho03), diverged from 1987 (95% confidence limit; [1986] [1987] [1988] , was suggested to be the cluster Cla. The other cluster including three H1 viruses (Sara13021, Chon977 and Chon9496), which diverged from 1986 (95% confidence limit; 1986-1987), appeared to be similar to that of the Clb H1 HA gene. NP586-1, instead of Rat59, clustered with Rat874 and Chacho03 within the classical swine lineage in the NP tree (data not shown). The similarity of the topology with the NS tree suggested that those three isolates share a common genetic origin with the cluster Cla. However, the estimated year of origin of the NP Cla gene was older (1963; 95% confidence limit; 1955-1971) than that calculated for the NS and H1 Cla. This discrepancy was probably due to the low R 2 value for the estimation of the NP gene (R 2 = 0AE488). All the NS genes of Thai isolates belonging to the avian-like swine lineage were considered to be the cluster ALa (Table 1) . A common ancestor of the ALa strains was estimated to have occurred in 1985 (95% confidence limit; 1982-1988) for NS and 1989 (95% confidence limit; 1988-1990) for NP. Taken together, the existence of nine genotypes of the SIVs was evident in the Thai pig populations within the three subtypes examined ( Table 1 ). All of the avian-like swine segments possessed by the Thai SIVs were closely related to the European avian-like swine lineage represented by A ⁄ Swine ⁄ Arnsberg ⁄ 6554 ⁄ 79(H1N1), 21 but not to those found in the North American swine viruses represented by A ⁄ Swine ⁄ Texas ⁄ 4199-2 ⁄ 98(H3N2), 6 indicating that the genetic resources introduced into the Thai SIVs were mainly from Europe. This is consistent with the fact that Thailand has imported breeding pigs from Europe rather than North America since late 1980s. 13
