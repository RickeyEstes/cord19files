For all negative samples, a negative result was obtained with both assays. A positive result was found with the Respifinder assay in 74 (78%) of 95 positive samples. Most of the false negative samples (15 of 21) were weak positive, except for 1 adenovirus type 31 sample. For 1 weak positive sample an inconclusive result (extraction and amplification control negative) was obtained. Weak positive samples were samples with a stock dilution of 10 −6 , Ct-value ≥35 by independent testing or a concentration ≤100 copies/ml. For 4 samples, a negative or an inconclusive result was obtained. These samples had an expected Ct-value of 33-34. Additionally, an adenovirus was detected in 3 RSV positive samples, which was confirmed with an adenovirus specific real-time PCR. 18 In 1 InfA H1 sample, the H5N1 variant was also detected. The RVP was positive in 31 (33%) samples. All adenovirus, CoV-NL63, CoV-OC43, and CoV-229E samples were false negative. Furthermore, for PIV-1, 7 of 8 samples were false negative and 1 of The sensitivity for weak positive samples was 47% for Respifinder and 13% for RVP. Results are shown in Table 1 (Supplementary data in Table 2 ).
