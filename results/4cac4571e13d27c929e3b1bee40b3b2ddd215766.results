We characterized the disease severity of SARS-CoV infection in individual FFPE lung samples based on the histopathological features as described in Table 2 . We grouped the FFPE samples to early (Grades 1-6) and late (Grades 7-11) disease stage, demonstrating a clear disease progression from early stage leading to the end-stage lung fibrosis. Due to the bacterial overgrowth observed in the histological section of Sample B, it was eliminated from our analysis. Real-time PCR experiments were carried out to validate the expression levels for 107 genes (refer Supplementary 1) with functional roles in inflammation, coagulation, fibrosis and apoptosis (refer Fig. 2) . We grouped the samples to early and late disease stage to compute the average expression level of individual genes. By doing so, we identified a list of 92 genes that were over-expressed Table 1 . (mean expression ≥1.5) in the disease samples versus the control samples (refer Table 3 ). We used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to study the functionality of these over-expressed genes (refer Supplementary 2). From this list of 92 genes, the statistical analysis showed 26 genes significantly (p < 0.05) over-expressed and 5 genes significantly (p < 0.05) suppressed (refer Figs. 3 and 4, Table 4 ) in the progression of disease (early versus late disease stage). As summarized in Table 4 , the transcriptome of SARS-CoV infected patients in late disease stage was characterized by the high expression of genes coding for chemokine (IL-8), complement component (C1QB), antibacterial response protein (TLR2), cytokine receptor (IL1R1 and TNFSF5), apoptosis-related cystein protease (CASP3 and CASP9), immunoglobulin receptor family member (CD4 and CD14), growth factors (FGF7 and IFG1), transcription factors (IRF3 and NFIL3), major histocompatibility complex antigen (HLA-DRA), receptors (ANPEP, C5R1 and MSR1), protease (HP, USP33 and SLPI), cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM8) and genes of miscellaneous functions (BPI, CD68, MALAT-1, RAB31 and S100A8). In contrast, notably low expression levels of cytokine (CLC and CXCL10), cell adhesion molecule (ITGA2B), transcription factor (STAT1) and protease (GBP) were found in patients of late disease stage. Through the use of Ingenuity ® Pathway Analysis, we demonstrated that the list of over-expressed genes were involved in immunological response (refer Fig. 5 ). Only a handful of genes appeared to be involved in this network analysis (with known and reported functionality), hence it highlights the novel insights in our study that majority of the over-expressed genes with important roles in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection still remains unreported. In order to confirm that the gene expression profiles have functional significance, we performed protein expression analysis by IHC for CD68, CD9 and PECAM. These were selected because they (a) were differentially expressed in both disease groups; (b) can be directly attributed to specific cellular types (macrophages, lymphocytic and endothelial); and (c) have robust, reported protocols used in the routine pathology setting and can be easily visualized and quantified. The results demonstrated that the gene expression profile correlates well with the degree of protein expression (refer Fig. 6 ). This highlighted the reliability of our gene expression profiling results.
