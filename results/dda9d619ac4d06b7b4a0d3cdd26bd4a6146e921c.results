To determine the students' scientific inquiry ability before and after the intervention, the results from EST, laboratory reports, science projects, semi-structured interview, and classroom observation were utilized to evaluate student self-efficacy. The quantitative data are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Table 1 shows a comparison of pre/post administration of the EST between experimental and control groups. These findings showed no significant difference between experimental and control groups in the pre-EST, while in the post-EST both control and experimental groups there was a significance difference (p<0.001). For the experimental group, there was a statistically significant increase (p<0.001) in post-EST for each item. The laboratory reports of students in the STS context were evaluated by rubric scoring using the five components. The results showed highest average score was in the hypothesis (3.03) and results (3.03). The lowest score was in the discussion and conclusion (2.05), which indicated that some students drew a conclusion that was not supported by the data and their discussions are not adequate and incomplete. The science projects were evaluated by rubric scoring of the seven items. The results in Table 3 showed that most groups had high scores in the presentation component (4.40), knowledge transfer (4.20), and answering questions (4.00). The lowest score was in the discussion and conclusion (3.40). Moreover, the results from semi-structured interview supported the students' acquisition of scientific inquiry skills. Before intervention, students were confused about independent and dependent variables. They could not set a hypothesis and did not practice the scientific method because they had up to then only learned from lecture. After the intervention, students understood more about scientific inquiry: they could identify and control variables, formulate and test hypotheses, and collect and conclude data by themselves. The first interview question focused on the students' scientific inquiry skills acquired in their learning. It was found that almost all students understood the process of scientific inquiry. Excerpts from the students are as follows:
