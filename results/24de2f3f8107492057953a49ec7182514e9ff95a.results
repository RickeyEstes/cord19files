A total of 281 confirmed MERS-CoV cases from Saudi Arabia were reported to the Saudi Ministry of Health from 23 April 2014 to 7 June 2016. Table 1 shows the distribution of the cases by sex, age, nationality, symptoms and fatality rates. The ratio of male to female cases was 1.45:1. Of the 281 confirmed cases, 55 (20%) died and the case fatality rate was higher in males than females, even though this difference was not statistically significant (67.3% vs. 32.7%; OR: 1.5, 95% CI 0.81-2.83; P = 0.221). Death predominantly occurred in Saudi citizens (P = 0.047) and in the group aged older than 60 years (P < 0.0001). The most prevalent clinical symptoms included fever (62%) and cough (54.1%), followed by SOB (41.3%; Table 2 ). Death among laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-COV infection was significantly associated with a SOB and respiratory failure (P < 0.001 and P < 0.007, respectively; Table 2 ). Among the 281 cases, 160 (56.9%) patients had underlying comorbid conditions (Table 3) . Patients with comorbidities had a higher mortality risk compared with those without (83.6% vs. 16.4%, P < 0.0001). The number of comorbidities in relation to mortality is shown in Table 4 . Diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), cardiac diseases, renal disease and bronchial asthma were the most frequent comorbid disorders (Table 4) . Among the comorbidities, DM, HTN, ischemic heart disease (IHD), congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) showed significant associations with fatality from MERS-CoV (OR 2.6 (1.4-4.9), OR 3.7 (2.02-6.9), OR 6.1 Table 4 ). In this regard, the prevalence of death in diabetic and hypertensive patients was similar (28 (50.9%) and 29 (52.7%)), respectively. Further analysis of those patients who had these comorbidities including DM, HTN, IHD, CHF, ESRD and CKD that contributed significantly to mortality from MERS-CoV showed no significant difference in mortality (P > 0.05) between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups (data not shown). Moreover, only four cases of asymptomatic patients died representing 1% of total 281 cases, three of these four were elderly aged more than 66-years-old with comorbidities (HTN and/or dementia) and one case aged 55-years-old and had additional multiple comorbidities (DM, HTN, COPD). Taking as presented in Table 4 , the presence of two or three comorbidities significantly increased the risk of death from MERS-CoV infection (P < 0.0001).
