During the study period, there were 453,075 admissions, and a total of 21,288 respiratory viral PCR tests were conducted. Table 1 shows the variation of the number of study subjects from year to year. A total of 7,772 nonduplicative PCR-positive cases were identified. Of these, 1,770 (22.8%) were categorized as having hospital-acquired infections. A total of 1,888 viruses were identified: 2 viruses were identified in 101 patients, 3 viruses were identified in 7 patients, and 4 viruses were identified in 1 patient. Of the 1,888 viruses identified, 573 (30.3%) were positive for rhinovirus, 333 (17.6%) were positive for influenza virus comprising 254 with influenza A and 79 with influenza B, 294 (15.6%) were positive for parainfluenza virus, 240 (12.7%) were positive for respiratory syncytial virus, 230 (12.2%) were positive for human coronavirus, 91 (4.8%) were positive for human metapneumovirus, 54 (2.9%) were positive for bocavirus, 43 (2.3%) were positive for adenovirus, and 30 (1.6%) were positive for enterovirus. The proportion of hospital-acquired infections was highest in human coronavirus (30.2%), followed by parainfluenza virus (29.8%), influenza virus (28.1%), rhinovirus (24.5%), respiratory syncytial virus (21.4%), bocavirus (21.1%), human metapneumovirus (20.5%), entero-virus (14.0%), and adenovirus (9.1%). The median length of hospital stay prior to contracting a respiratory viral infection was 16 days (interquartile range, 9-32 days). The overall incidence of hospital-acquired respiratory virus infections was 3.9 cases per 1,000 admissions (95% confidence interval, 3.7-4.1) and 4.9 cases per 10,000 patient days (95% confidence interval, 4.7-5.2). The incidences of such infections according to the year, sex, age group, ward, and virus type are summarized in Table 1 . The incidences ranged from 3.6-4.3 cases per 1,000 admissions, with the highest incidence in the year 2015. Patients â‰¤15 years were more likely to develop hospital-acquired respiratory virus infections. The incidence of such infections was highest in intensive care units (ICUs), followed by medical wards and surgical wards. Of the ICU cases, the median days of ICU stay before viral infection was 4 days (interquartile range, 1-12). All-cause 30-day mortality, 60-day mortality, and in-hospital mortality were 11.3%, 16.5%, and 12.9%, respectively. The seasonal distribution of hospital-acquired respiratory viruses among hospitalized patients was similar to that of communityacquired infections (Supplementary Fig S1) .
