CSF on last admission was acellular, but with oligoclonal bands, although total protein was low 0.12 g/L (normal 0.15-0.45 g/L. The oligoclonal bands were negative for HSV and VZV antibodies. Polyoma JC virus was detected by PCR in blood and urine on one occasion each (Table  S2) . CSF PCR was negative for 16S (bacterial) and 18S (fungal) rRNA and for a wide number of viral pathogens (Table S2) , including JC virus, mumps, measles and rubella viruses. No pathogens were detected in stool, urine or blood (Table S2) . CSF was negative for rubella and measles antibodies. In the absence of a firm diagnosis, a brain biopsy showed neuronal loss, astrocytic gliosis, reactive astrocytes, microglia and chronic inflammatory cells, but no viral inclusions or granulomata (Fig. 2a -e legend for detailed description). Infiltrating T lymphocytes were identified by CD3 staining (Fig. 2f) . RNA-Seq of the brain biopsy [5, 20] resulted in 110 million 81 base pair (bp) paired-end reads. Approximately, one million reads were identified as non-human and were subsequently used for potential pathogen identification by the metaMix method [21] . Mumps virus was the only potential pathogen detected, with 77,624 assigned reads. The remaining reads were either unclassified or mapped to human and bacteria that are either environmental, part of human flora, kit contaminants [23] or of unknown significance (Table S3) . No reads mapped to measles, rubella or polyoma JC viruses. Using de novo assembly, the full-length viral sequence was recovered (99.94 % genome coverage, median coverage depth: 290) ( Figure S1 ). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis showed that the consensus viral sequence clustered closely with the MuV JL5 vaccine strains ( Figure S2 ) and shared 99.6 % identity with the publicly available sequence (GenBank: FJ211585) of the mumps component of the MMR preparation administered to the child. The sequence identified in this study is named MuV JL5 -London (GenBank: KX223397). PCR of RNA extracted from the brain biopsy confirmed the presence of MuV JL5 vaccine strain (Table S2) , but was negative for all other viruses, including polyoma JC (Table S2) . Immunohistochemistry showed the presence of MuV nucleocapsid (N) protein with a neuronal pattern of staining (Fig. 2g,  h) . Control cortex and white matter were negative. We observed no specific staining for other pathogens (Fig. 2g ,h for details) and no evidence of viral intracytoplasmic or intranuclear inclusion bodies. Retrospective testing showed weakly positive mumps antibody in the CSF. To investigate this finding further, three million 251 bp paired-end reads were generated from the MMR vaccine batch that was used to immunise the child, of which 82,000 reads mapped to the MuV JL5 vaccine strain (median coverage: 706, Figure S1 ). There were no fixed differences identified compared with the reference FJ211585. Fifteen positions in the vaccine sequence were found to be polymorphic (variant allele frequency (VAF) 5 % or greater, Table S4 ). Of 55 fixed nucleotide differences between MuV JL5 -London and the vaccine, 12 had been present as a minority variant (10-24 %) in the vaccine ( Figure S3 , Table S4 , VAF 75 % or greater). Of the remaining 43 new mutations, 28 coded for missense amino acid substitutions (Fig. 3 , Table S5 ), with nine (32 %) located in the M protein, more than expected by chance (two-tailed exact binomial test p = 2.8eâˆ’04, Table S6 ). Other than position 140 in the M protein, the missense mutations were unique to MuV JL5 -London ( Figure S6 ). The Tyr140His substitution in MuV JL5 -London is found in all wild-type strains as well as the more neurovirulent MuV Ur Urabe and the MuV JL2 Jeryl Lynn 2 vaccine strain, which is a minor component of some vaccines [1] (Figure S6 ).
