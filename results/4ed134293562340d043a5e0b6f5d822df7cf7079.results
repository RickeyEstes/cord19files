3D domain swapping is a structural mechanism employed by a variety of protein structures to form oligomeric assemblies. These oligomers were often associated with aggregation diseases or proteinopathies in humans. Parkinson's diseases and Alzheimer's diseases are two major neurodegenerative diseases due to phenotypic impact of 3D domain swapping. Hitherto, no comprehensive study has been reported to analyze the impact of all proteins involved in 3D domain swapping from a whole proteome-wide or genome-wide perspective due to unavailability of a well-defined, curated dataset. We performed the initial investigation of proteins involved in 3D domain swapping in the level of protein domains, Gene Ontology, KEGG pathways and Disease Ontology. Our approach helped to understand enriched protein domains, Gene Ontology terms, biological pathways and Disease Ontology terms mediated by these proteins and their role in mediating various human diseases. Statistically significant protein domains associated with swapped proteins in the human proteome is provided (Table 1), GO terms (Tables 2, 3 , 4), KEGG pathways (Table 5 ) and DO terms (Table 6) , associated with swapped proteins encoded in the human proteome, are provided. Critical aspects of statistically significant evolutionarily conserved domains, GO terms, KEGG pathways and DO terms associated with human proteins in swapped conformation are summarized in the 'Discussion' section. Proteins involved in 3D-domain swapping represents a large collection of proteins with a variety of functional and regulatory roles in the cell. Due to limitation in crystallizing structures in the swapped conformation, currently available repertoire of proteins in the swapped conformation may represent only a small fraction of proteins that may perform its molecular role via 3D domain swapping. Machine learning algorithms and computational approaches may help to predict more proteins with features of 3D domain swapping [11, 52] . Here we discuss primary insights obtained from the initial investigation of proteins involved in 3D domain swapping. Present results from the human proteome indicates an important paradigm that future drug design studies, focusing on various disease categories or pathways associated with 3D domain swapping, should consider the structural implications of this important structural mechanism and associated mechanisms like macromolecular crowding and protein aggregation.
