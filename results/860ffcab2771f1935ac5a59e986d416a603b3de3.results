The overall prevalence of GI parasite was 62% (n = 34; 95% CI: 47.73-74.59) in camel and 59.4% (n = 17; 95% CI: 40.65-76.30) in dhumba. Among 55 sampled camel, 34 (61.8%; 95% CI: 47.7-74.6) were infected with at least one type of parasite. We detected three nematodes (Trichuris spp., Trichostrongylus spp., and Strongyloides spp.), two trematodes (Paragonimus spp. and Schistosoma spp.), two cestodes (Hymenolepis spp. and Moniezia spp.), protozoan (Balantidium), and two hemoparasites (Anaplasma spp. and Babesia spp.) in camel (Fig. 1) . Trichuris spp. was most prevalent nematode (29%) in camel than other nematodes identified. The only GI protozoa found in camel was Balantidium coli (22%). 15% camel (n = 8; 95% CI: 6.5-26.7) were infected with more than one type of parasites. Mean EPG feces was 291.76 Â± 42.03 with a range of 0-1400. Two hemoparasites were detected, Anaplasma spp. (9%) and Babesia spp. (2%), after Giemsa staining ( Table 1) . Out of 32 dhumba, 59.4% (n = 19; 95% CI: 41-76) were found to be positive for GI parasites. Four genera of parasites were identified in dhumba (Fig. 2) . The highest prevalence was for Trichostrongylus spp. (n = 10; 31.3%; 95% CI: 16.1-50) followed by Strongyloides spp. (n = 9; 28%; 95% CI: 13.8-46.8), B. coli (n = 5; 15.6%; 95% CI: 5.3-32.8) and Trichuris spp. (n = 4; 12.5%; 95% CI: 3.5-28.9) ( Table 1) . Animals from market, female animals, adults, and animal with poor body condition, were found to be more parasitized (Table 2 ).
