We first investigated hospitalization registries of Tokyo First Army Hospital from January to November 1918. These registries had the names and diagnoses of patients admitted to the hospital on a monthly basis. Numbers of patients admitted for respiratory infectious disease during this period are shown in the Figure. Cases diagnosed as pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and influenza were classified as respiratory infectious diseases. Although records of patients with tuberculosis were found, we excluded them from this study. In the 10-month period from January to October, the mean (± standard deviation) monthly numbers of patients with pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and influenza were 10.9 ± 6.5, 10.0 ± 3.6, and 1.8 ± 4.1, respectively (22.7 ± 9.6 for all 3 illnesses). Death rates from pneumonia, bronchitis, and influenza during this period were 3.4% (4/116), 0% (0/109), and 0% (0/18), respectively. The number of influenza patients suddenly increased to 109 in November, and 9 of them died (8%). Because our information about these 109 patients was found only in the hospitalization registries (the patients' medical records were not found), we could not identify their clinical symptoms. However, it can be assumed that the hospital experienced the first wave of Spanish influenza in November 1918. Because no hospitalization registry before this period was found, comparison with outbreaks in average years was not possible. We then investigated the medical records of the Fifth Japanese Army Garrison Hospital, which may have been a Japanese military field hospital in Krasnoyarsk, Russia. These records covered 2 years (1919 and 1920), but most cases of clinical influenza were concentrated in May-November 1919. All 132 cases were in infantrymen 19-49 years of age (mean ± standard deviation 22.7 ± 4.1 years); 47% had been farmers before entering the military, and 72% had no recorded medical histories. The initial symptom was sudden fever in 116 patients (94%), headache in 101 (81%), chills in 92 (74%), cough in 86 (69%), general malaise in 60 (48%), appetite loss in 56 (45%), pharyngalgia in 45 (36%), arthralgia/myalgia in 33 (27%), and vomiting/diarrhea in 27 (22%). On admission, reddish pharynx was noted in 105 (85%), coated tongue in 95 (77%), thoracic rale in 71 (57%), facial flush in 24 (19%), and conjunctival congestion in 16 (13%). The period from onset to admission was 4.7 ± 3.9 days (range 0-24 days), the duration of hospitalization was 14.8 ± 12.0 days (range 3-79 days), and the death rate was 6.0% (8/132). A comparison of 124 patients who survived and 8 who died is shown in the Table. In the patients who died, body temperature and pulse rate were higher at the time of hospital admission, and thoracic rale and an "agonized facial expression" (a painful expression as reported by Japanese doctors) were observed in many patients. The death rate was higher in patients who had digestive symptoms, but the difference was not statistically significant. In fatal cases, the patients died an average of 13.9 days after symptom onset and 7.1 days after admission. Fever patterns in 132 patients were classified as typical (fever resolved in <10 days after onset), prolonged (fever persisted for >10 days), biphasic (fever resolved and then recurred), and other (unclassifiable). A total of 77 (58%), 38 (29%), 7 (5%), and 10 (8%) patients, respectively, were classified as these types.
