Filter penetration and resistance results are presented in Table 2 . Mean initial penetration values ranged from 0.39% to 5.83%, and mean maximum penetration valued ranged from 0.95% to 5.83%. The standard deviations ranged from 0.02% to 1.95% and 0.02% to 1.97% for initial and maximum penetration, respectively. Of the 21 NIOSH-certified N95 respirator models tested in this study, 19 models had both average initial and maximum penetration results measured with the TSI 8130 AFTof less than 5%. 21 The maximum penetration level allowed by NIOSH for N95 certification using the 42 CFR 84 test requirement is 5%. The Gerson Model 2737 (Louis M. Gerson, Middleboro, MA) and Magid Model KR795 (Magid Glove and Safety Manufacturing, Chicago, IL) each had 2 of 3 samples that did not pass the NIOSH certification requirement using the filter test method used here. However, for each of these 2 models, the means of the initial and maximum penetrations are only slightly higher than 5% (Gerson: both mean initial and mean maximum penetration 5 5.83%; Magid: mean initial penetration 5 5.44% and mean maximum penetration 5 5.59%). Mean filter resistance at maximum penetration was also obtained. All of the filter resistance levels measured using the AFTwere within the NIOSH certification requirements of #35 mm water column height pressure (mm H 2 O). 21 Values ranged from a low of 7
