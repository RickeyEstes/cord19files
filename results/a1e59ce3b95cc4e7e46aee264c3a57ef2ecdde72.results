The observed values for total proteins showed a tendency to peak on the 100th d.i. for group A and on the 72nd d.i. for group B. However, when compared to the control group this was not significant (p ! 0.05) (Fig. 1) . With respect to the electrophoresis of serum proteins we observed that among the five fractions analyzed the a2-globulin increased on the 100th and 130th d.i., for groups A and B compared to group C ( Fig. 2 ) with significant statistical differences on these collecting days (p 0.05). The b-globulin in inoculated groups reduced on the 20th d.i., followed by an emphatic increase on the 30th d.i. which persisted until the 45th d.i. (Fig. 2) . There was a significant difference between groups A and C on the 20th, 45th and 100th d.i.; in groups B and C, on the 20th and 45th d.i. and in groups A and B, on the 100th d.i. (p 0.05). ALT activity was shown to be slightly higher in groups A and B compared to the control group on the 10th and 30th d.i. and lower on the 20th and from the 45th to the 130th d.i. We observed that the mean of AST activity was increased for groups A and B from the 30th d.i. until the 160th d.i. An increased value was observed in groups A and B on the 45th d.i. and for group B on the 160th d.i. No statistical difference was observed among the groups for the activities of these enzymes (p ! 0.05). The variation of the GGT activity in the serum of inoculated dogs (groups A and B) was not significant (p ! 0.05) when compared to the control group, although the inoculated groups increased on the 30th d.i. The activity of PAL and the means of the urea and creatinine measurements in the inoculated groups varied relative to the control group but it was not significant (p ! 0.05). The averages of the CK-MB isoenzyme presented an increase for infected dogs from the 30th d.i. with peaks on the 60th d.i. for group B and on the 90th and 150th d.i., for group A. A significant difference was observed when comparing the infected groups to the control group from the 30th to the 120th d.i. (p 0.05) (Fig. 3) .
