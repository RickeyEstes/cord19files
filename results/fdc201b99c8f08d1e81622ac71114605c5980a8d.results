Fig 2 shows the two WAIFW matrices obtained from the contact diary data (A) and the synthetic contact matrix (B), respectively. Both indicate a strong within age group (assortative) mixing particularly in the school going age groups and secondary cross-generational mixing (e.g. parent to child; teacher to pupil), note the difference in the colour axis. The outcome of fitting the model is shown in Fig 2C and 2D . The directly estimated contact patterns and the synthetically estimated WAIFW give results indistinguishable in terms of fit to the hospitalisation data. The log-likelihood values for the diary and synthetic models were -1481.3895 and -1443.8595 with basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of 7.08 and 25.60 respectively calculated as the dominant Eigen values of the WAIFW matrices [33] . Whilst the model reproduces the overall pattern, it is unable to predict the variation between different epidemics, which might be due to shifting viral genetics [34] . Similarly, the age groups within the mixing matrices do not match those in the data, which might explain the slight over-estimation in the 4-6m age groups. Fig 3 shows the proportion of hospitalisations prevented, for different combinations of coverage (proportion immunised) and age of immunisation. Vaccination is potentially effective if given after maternal immunity is lost and before individuals have been infected for the first time. The predicted impact for the contact diary is higher, and maximum impact is more broadly distributed, resulting from a less peaked force of infection in infancy (see Fig 4C and  4D ). Fig 4A shows the short-term temporal effects of vaccination on the number of hospitalisations with immunisation implemented at time 0 at 6 months at 70% coverage. The diary model predicts a honeymoon period [35] of approximately 6 years before equilibrating to yearly epidemics with an alternating pattern of low and high peaks. On the other hand, the synthetic model does not predict a change in the pattern except that the epidemic peaks are reduced. Fig  4B shows that the total vaccine effect (solid lines) is much greater than the direct effect alone (dashed lines)-the difference is the indirect effect of protection of younger infants from infection. Fig 4C and 4D show the age-specific force of infection at equilibrium for the dairy and the synthetic models respectively. The solid lines shows pre-vaccination force of infection and the dashed lines show the force of infection with vaccination at 6 months at 70% coverage. It is clear from the figure that individuals aged between 2 and 20 years of age dominate the force of infection for the synthetic model. This can be attributed to the high number of contacts occurring within and between those age groups in the household. Immunisation is expected to change the average age at infection and this is shown in Fig 4E. This figure shows the change in the average age at primary (solid lines) and secondary (dashed lines) infections with a vaccine given at 6 months and for different vaccination coverages. The average age at primary infection increases from about 2 to 9 years (at 100% coverage) for the diary model (blue solid line) while the synthetic model predicts a relatively small increase, 2 to 2.5 years (red solid line). We then used LHS to explore the effects of uncertainty in estimating the values of the input variables on the prediction precision on the optimal age at vaccination, in particular exploring the range of potential optimum ages predicted. Fig 5A shows the proportion of RSV hospital cases averted at 70% coverage at different ages. There is considerable heterogeneity in the success of the vaccination programme depending on the assumed parameters: the bars show the range excluding the highest and lowest 2.5%, and the line the median. These results should not be interpreted as a probability distribution, but an assessment of the variation in optimum vaccination age given parameter uncertainty. Fig 5B shows the effect of vaccinating at different ages (coverage fixed at 70%) with the parameter values used in the sensitivity analysis. We consider the proportion of parameter sets that maximize the probability of having more than 80% reduction in hospitalisations (black line) or ones than minimize the probability of having less than 40% reduction (blue line). The red dots shows that the highest proportion of 80% reduction is achieved with a vaccine given at age 10 months while the lowest proportion of a 40% reduction is achieved with a vaccine given at age 5 months. This result demonstrates that there is considerable variability in the potential effectiveness of a vaccination programme when both parameter and structural uncertainty are included, but that the age range of optimum outcome is relatively narrow.
