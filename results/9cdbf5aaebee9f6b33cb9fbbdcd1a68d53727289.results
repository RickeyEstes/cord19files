CXCR3-deficiency reduces clinical symptoms and weight loss during cuprizone feeding As previously shown, cuprizone feeding triggers growth retardation and a decline of body weight in mice [57, 58] . We documented the body weight development and phenotypic signs for sickness in CXCR3-/-and WT mice during the course of cuprizone feeding. We found a scruffy coat combined with a hunched posture and ocular/nasal discharge as clinical symptoms for cuprizone intoxication during the first three weeks of the cuprizone-diet in most of the WT mice. These findings were less overt in CXCR3-/-mice. We also observed an overall higher locomotor activity of CXCR3-/-mice compared to WT controls. A rapid drop of body weight was detectable after the first week of cuprizone feeding, when the body mass of WT mice was reduced to 80.4 ± 0.9%, whereas in CXCR3-/mice dropped to 90.8 ± 1.9% (Figure 1 ; ***P <0.001) of the initial weight (initial weight: WT 0 weeks: 19.4 ± 0.6 g, n = 20; CXCR3-/-0 weeks: 18.8 ± 0.5 g, n = 20). During the subsequent two weeks of cuprizone feeding, the body weight remained at a significantly lower level in WT compared to CXCR3-/-mice ( Figure 1 ; WT, 2 weeks: 82.4 ± 1.0% versus CXCR3-/-, 2 weeks: 88.7 ± 1.4%, **P <0.01, n = 20; WT, 3 weeks: 80.1 ± 1.1% versus CXCR3-/-, 3 weeks: 89.2 ± 1.7%, ***P <0.001, n = 20). Between week three and four, WT mice increased their weight by +5.5% to 85.6 ± 1.3% (n = 14), whereas CXCR3-/-mice remained at 88.0 ± 2.8% (n = 14) of their initial weight. From week four to five of cuprizone administration no significant differences in the mean body masses were detectable between both genotypes. Withdrawal of cuprizone after five weeks resulted in rapid body weight recovery in WT and CXCR3-/-mice. The gain of body weight during withdrawal of cuprizone was significantly higher in mice deficient for CXCR3 compared to WT animals ( Figure 1 ; WT 5.5 weeks: 105.9 ± 2.2%; CXCR3-/-5.5 weeks: 117.7 ± 1.9%; *P <0.05). CXCR3 is critical for the spatial distribution and activation of microglia As previously indicated, CXCR3 potentially influences the functional properties of microglia during pathological states of the CNS [23, 53] . Here, we characterized the impact of CXCR3 deficiency on microglia activation and accumulation during cuprizone treatment. First, we detected activated microglia in different brain regions: corpus callosum (Cc), cerebellum (Cb) and thalamus (Th) using tomato lectin staining, which was quantified as a degree for microglial accumulation and activation. Compared to WT, an attenuated amount of lectin + signal was detected in the cerebellum of CXCR3-/-animals ( Figure 2B , Cb; WT, 3 weeks: 7.0 ± 0.8% versus CXCR3-/-, 3 weeks: 4.6 ± 0.7%, *P <0.05, lectin + area fraction; WT, 5 weeks: 18.1 ± 1.4% versus CXCR3-/-, 5 weeks: 12.0 ± 1.9%). Moreover, strikingly diminished lectin staining was found in the thalamus (Th), the midbrain and the hypothalamus of CXCR3-/-mice ( Figure 2B , Th; WT, 3 weeks: 1.9 ± 0.2% versus CXCR3-/-3 weeks: 0.7 ± 0.1%, ***P <0.001; WT, 5 weeks: 4.5 ± 0.6% versus CXCR3-/-5 weeks: 1.7 ± 0.5%, **P <0.01, lectin + area fraction). Together with attenuated microglia accumulation, microglia showed a differential spatial distribution in the cerebellum of CXCR3-/-animals. Consistently, we found a rim-like formation of microglia in the deep cerebellar white matter ( Figure 2D , Cb; 5 weeks CXCR3-/-) in CXCR3 deficient brains. In contrast, WT mice displayed a dense and even distribution of microglia in this area. In difference to CXCR3-/-animals, we also found widespread lectin + cells in the medulla in WT mice ( Figure 2D , Cb; WT 5 weeks). However, at the stage of acute demyelination after three and five weeks, we observed comparable numbers of lectin + microglia in the corpus callosum of WT and CXCR3-/-mice ( Figure 2B, D; Cc) . Interestingly, microglia, localized in the white matter components exhibit larger and round-shaped CD68 + compartment in WT than in CXCR3-/-animals ( Figure To further define the alleviated microglia activation in CXCR3-/-mice we co-localized Iba1 and CD68 to differentiate activation by morphology and expression of a lysosomal antigen. In cuprizone-treated WT animals, tight clusters of activated Iba1+ microglia cells were visible. Microglia in these clusters displayed large CD68 + lysosomes, while in CXCR3-/-mice microglia distribution was loose and intracellular CD68 + lysosomes were smaller in size and less prominent ( Figure 3A ). Taken together, during cuprizone treatment, diminished numbers and reduced activation of microglia were observed in CXCR3deficient mice compared to WT. Flow cytometry further confirms reduced microglial activation in cuprizone-treated CXCR3-deficient mice compared to wild type controls The histological characterization of microglia in cuprizonetreated mice outlined a differential spatial distribution, accumulation and attenuated activation in CXCR3-/mice compared to control animals ( Figure 2B -D and Figure 3A ). To further detect and substantiate differences in the microglial phenotype during cuprizone administration, we applied flow cytometry of brain homogenates and determined the CD11b and CD45 levels of microglia populations. As previously shown, CD45 levels can be helpful to discriminate infiltrating macrophages/ microglia (CD11b + /CD45 high ) or parenchymal microglia (CD11b + /CD45 dim ) [56, 59] . We assessed the percentage of CD11b + cells expressing diminished (dim) or high levels of CD45 (high). Initially, CD11b + /CD45 dim microglia comprised 99.4% of Figure 1 Cuprizone administration induces a less overt body weight decline in CXCR3-/-compared with wild type (WT) mice. From 8 weeks of age, WT and CXCR3-/-mice were fed with 0.2% cuprizone for five weeks (dotted grid lines) with a subsequent four days of recovery to normal chow (5.5 weeks). The body weights were monitored twice a week and plotted in comparison with values of control animals fed with powdered normal chow (gray symbols). During the initial three weeks of cuprizone feeding, CXCR3-/-animals showed a significantly less pronounced body weight decline than WT mice (n = 20 per group; **P <0.01, ***P <0.001). Moreover, body weight recovery after offset of cuprizone feeding was found to be significantly improved in CXCR3-deficient mice after 5.5 weeks (n = 7 per group; ***P <0.001). Data represent mean ± SEM. the CD11b + cells in WT and CXCR3-/-animals (0 weeks, Figure 3 ). Throughout the experiment, these microglia were visible as a distinct cell population ( Figure 4B , left encircled population in both genotypes). An overall low, but significantly higher percentage of CD11b + /CD45 high cells were found in both WT and CXCR3-/-animals upon cuprizone intoxication, peaking after 3 weeks of the study (Figure 4 B; WT 0 weeks: 0.62 ± 0.16% versus WT 3 weeks: 5.29 ± 1.47%, *P <0.05; CXCR3-/-0 weeks: 0.55 ± 0.06% versus CXCR3-/-3 weeks: 3.40 ± 0.48%, **P <0.01). Although, the populations of CD11b + /CD45 high microglia/ macrophages were slightly increased after 3 and 5 weeks in WT animals, this difference did not reach a significant t level when compared to CXCR3-/-mice. We further analyzed the CD11b + /CD45 dim microglia population and found strongly reduced surface expression of CD45 on CXCR3-/-compared to WT microglia after three and five weeks of cuprizone treatment ( Figure 3B-D) . After three weeks of cuprizone ingestion, the reduction of CD45 and CD11b molecules on CXCR3-/microglia was most intense compared to WT mice ( Figure 3C ; CD45, WT: 522.8 ± 6.5 versus CXCR3-/-: 382.3 ± 12.7, ***P <0.001; CD11b WT: 8912 ± 35.9 versus CXCR3-/-: 7845 ± 202.0, MFI). After five weeks, the expression of microglial CD45 in CXCR3-/-mice was still significantly lower than in WT mice ( Figure 3C ; CD45, WT 3 weeks: 562.8 ± 7.4 versus CXCR3-/-3 weeks: 503.6 ± 10.5, **P <0.005, MFI) whereas the CD11b expression reached the corresponding WT level. The detection of other CD45 + leukocytes like neutrophils (Ly6-G), T cells (CD3e) and Nk cells (Nk 1.1) did not lead to evaluable data. We found very low quantities of other CD45-positive cells than the CD11b + / CD45 + population. The percentage of CD11b-negative CD45 + events continuously lay below 1.3% in WT and CXCR3-/-animals (data not shown). In summary, CD11b + /CD45 dim CXCR3-/-microglia displayed strongly diminished total level of the activation Figure 2 Diminished microglia cell numbers and extent of CD68 + content in CXCR3-/-cuprizone brains. A. Sagittal brain sections of wild type (WT) and CXCR3-/-were analyzed for the localization of activated microglia at regions of the corpus callosum (Cc), thalamus (Th) and cerebellum (Cb). B. Analysis of serial sagittal brain sections stained for tomato lectin documents a significant reduction of activated microglia in cuprizone-fed CXCR3-/-mice compared to WT animals (n = 10 to 14 at equal sections, time point and genotype, *P <0.05, **P <0.005, ***P <0.001). D. These observations were made within regions of the thalamus (Th) and cerebellum (Cb), but were not found in the white matter of the frontal corpus callosum (Cc) of CXCR3-/-brains. Besides the reduced lectin + area fraction in the cerebellum of CXCR3-/-mice, we also found a differential spatial distribution of microglia surrounding the cerebellar nuclei together with a consistent cluster at the vestibular nuclei of the medulla after 5 weeks (D, WT Cb versus CXCR3-/-Cb). {AU Query: Please define 'D' from the previous sentence so readers know what this abbreviation represents.} Because most overt differences of microglia accumulation between CXCR3-/-and WT were visible after 5 weeks of cuprizone diet, we further investigated microglia using double fluorescence immunolabeling for CD68 (red) and MBP (green) (Myelin basic protein). C. At the designated insets (D) we analyzed the CD68 + content in both genotypes and found significantly reduced particle perimeters in all studied central nervous system (CNS) regions in CXCR3-/-compared to WT brains (n ≥1,900 CD68 + particles per genotype, **P <0.01, ***P <0.001). Data represent mean ± SEM. markers CD45 and CD11b during cuprizone administration when compared to WT controls. However, we could not detect significant differences in the composition of CD11b + /CD45 dim and CD11b + /CD45 high microglia/ macrophages between WT and CXCR3-deficient mice throughout the cuprizone study. Astrocyte activation by morphological criteria is reduced in cuprizone-treated CXCR3-/-mice compared to wild type controls Subsequently, we prepared immunofluorescence stainings for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) specific antibody combined with lectin to localize reactive astrogliosis within regions of microglia activation. Hypertrophic astrocytic cell bodies were found in close proximity to the corpus callosum (Cc) and within the thalamus (Th) of WT, but were less pronounced in CXCR3-/-mice. We quantified the extent of astrocytic activation in terms of GFAP-positive cell body perimeters and found reduced values in CXCR3-/-animals within the Cc and Th regions investigated ( Figure 5A ; WT Cc: 49.9 ± 1.3 μm, n = 1672 versus CXCR3-/-Cc: 45.4 ± 1.3 μm, n = 1303; *P <0.05). This effect was most prominent in the thalamic region and in brain areas with high microglia accumulation in WT and CXCR3-/-mice ( Figure 5A ; WT Th: 67.5 ± 3.2 μm, n = 1220 versus CXCR3-/-Th: 51.4 ± 2.3 μm, n = 930; ***P <0.001). Substantial overlapping of neighboring astrocyte processes with confluent cellular signals were detected in WT but not in CXCR3-/-animals ( Figure 5B , Th; insets of original magnification). In Figure 3 CXCR3-deficient microglia display diminished levels for CD45 and CD11b during cuprizone diet. A. Ex vivo-prepared microglia of both genotypes were phenotyped using flow cytometry. B. Brain homogenates from wild type (WT) and CXCR3-/-mice after 3, 5, and 5.5 weeks of the cuprizone diet (n = 4 to 5 animals per group) were prepared and microglia subsequently analyzed for CD45 and CD11b expression. Using CD11b/CD45 gating, the majority of microglia were found in a distinct isolated CD11b + /CD45 dim population in WT and CXCR3-/-animals (left encircled population). A small population of CD11b + /CD45 high cells was slightly increased in WT compared to CXCR3-/-mice after 3 weeks (right encircled population, percentage of CD11b + /CD45 high cells is given below, mean ± SEM). C. Flow cytometry histogram overlays show representative CD45/CD11b expression from freshly isolated microglia (CD11b + /CD45 dim+high in WT (black line) and CXCR3-/-(red line) cuprizone-fed mice after 3 weeks. The dashed histogram represents the isotype control. Histograms were gated on microglial population according to forward/side scatter profile. CXCR3-/-animals displayed reduced surface expression levels for CD45 and CD11b compared with WT levels. D. Statistical analysis of the CD45 and CD11b level within the CD11b + /CD45 dim microglia population of WT (black dots) and CXCR3-/-(red dots) mice over the course of the cuprizone experiment (mean fluorescence intensity, MFI). Fundamentally reduced MFI of CD45 (3 and 5 weeks) and CD11b (3 weeks) were documented in CXCR3-/-compared to WT microglia (**P <0.005, ***P <0.001). all three regions of interest, GFAP + cells were quantified using sections of both genotypes from corresponding brain regions. In thalamic regions and the corpus callosum, we could find significantly reduced numbers of GFAP + cells in CXCR3-/-compared to WT animals ( Figure 5C ; WT Th: 325 ± 25 versus CXCR3-/-Th: 219 ± 33 and WT Cc: 556 ± 48 versus CXCR3-/-Cc: 384 ± 43 *P <0.05, cells/mm2).
