A detailed, chronologically ordered summary of 93 cases of Aspergillus meningitis, chronic meningitis/pachymeningitis, meningoencephalitis, arachnoiditis and ventriculitis including the one presented herein (case 46) is shown in Table 1 . There were 46 women (50%) and 46 men, with a median age of 37 years (range 3e75 years). Diagnosis was made during life in 52 patients (55.9%) and at autopsy in 41 patients. A diagnosis was obtained more frequently during life among immunocompetent patients (69%) in comparison with immunocompromised individuals (39%) ( Table 2 ). In almost half of the cases (n Z 44) Aspergillus was identified by histology or culture without speciation; all other infections were caused by A. fumigatus (n Z 34), A. flavus (n Z 8) and A. terreus (n Z 3) while A. oryzae, A. granulosus and A. candidus were identified in one case each. Fortyone patients were considered immunocompromised hosts (5 AIDS patients; 3 with autoimmune diseases treated with steroids; 9 solid organ transplant recipients; 10 hematologic patients undergoing chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation; 5 subjects under steroid therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; 7 patients with diabetes and, finally, 1 each with Cushing's disease and sarcoidosis). In the fiftytwo patients without classic risk factors for invasive aspergillosis, central nervous system involvement was presumed to be the result of: direct extension of Aspergillus from the orbit, ear or paranasal sinuses in 6 patients (11.5%); iatrogenic direct inoculation of Aspergillus through spinal anesthesia (13 patients, 25%), neurosurgery (13 patients, 25%) or epidural steroid injections (1 patient). In six intravenous drug abusers (11.5%) the infection was probably acquired by the hematogenous route. Among the remaining subjects, no predisposing factor could be identified in six patients while one patient each were notable for the presence of the following: pregnancy, alcohol abuse, fungal endocarditis and near drowning. The most common syndrome was acute meningitis which was observed in 46 patients, followed by meningoencephalitis (n Z 23). A chronic course of meningitis was observed in 15 patients; five patients showed a picture of spinal arachnoiditis (in 1 case with associated meningitis), and 4 ventriculitis ( Table 2 ). An acute course characterized by rapid deterioration of the clinical picture usually ending with death was observed among immunocompromised hosts and in patients who had direct inoculation of the fungus into the cerebrospinal fluid or the subarachnoid space. By contrast, a sub-acute or chronic form of meningitis going unrecognized for several weeks and sometimes displaying a relapsing character was the most frequent presentation among immunocompetent patients, intravenous drug abusers and patients with diabetes. However, the latter clinical picture was also observed among several patients who had undergone neurosurgery. Cerebrospinal fluid culture was positive for Aspergillus spp. in 31% of cases with a slightly higher prevalence among immunocompetent (36.9%), as opposed to immunocompromised hosts (18.2%) ( Table 2 ). In nine patients, Aspergillus spp. was cultured from CSF only after repeated attempts (median number of lumbar punctures: 4, range 3e9). Antigen-based assays were employed in fifteen patients: GM antigen by use of the Platelia Elisa in 10 patients, with an unspecified assay in 2 patients, with Pastorex assay in 1 patient and 1,3-b-D-glucan in 2 individuals. GM antigen was detected in CSF specimens of 6 out of 8 immunocompetent patients and in all immunocompromised hosts in whom it was assessed (7/7, 100%) with an overall sensitivity of 86.7%. The median CSF GM index was 6.58 (range 2.2e578). Serum GM was concomitantly measured in 8 cases and turned positive in 3. In 3 patients, CSF GM was serially determined (3e10, median 7), showing a good correlation Of those patients who had received at least one dose of antifungal agent, 30 (51.7%) died after an interval of time ranging from few days up to 6 years. All patients with chronic meningitis were initially treated with antibiotics and 6 had also received anti-tubercular therapy. An overall casefatality rate (CFR) of 72.1% was observed, with significant differences between immunocompetent (63.5%) as opposed to immunocompromised patients (82.9%) patients. Autopsy was available in 49 cases and it was the method by which diagnosis was made for 40 patients (81.6%). In twelve cases basilar meningitis was identified; spinal cord involvement was observed in 5 patients; the presence of a mycotic aneurism involving either the internal carotid artery or the basilar artery was shown in 12 patients with concomitant subarachnoid hemorrhage. Transtentorial, tonsillar or uncal herniation was present in three patients.
