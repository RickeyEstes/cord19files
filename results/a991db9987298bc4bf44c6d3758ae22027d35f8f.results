A total of 109 questionnaires were distributed 4 weeks after implementation of universal precautionary measures. Ninety-six questionnaires were returned (88%). The demographic characteristics of the respondents are shown in Table 2 . The respondents' opinions are summarized in Figs 1 and 2. Most staff were quite neutral toward the necessity of the preventive measures in labor ward. On the other hand, they indicated that these measures are more necessary in the operating theater. Goggles and double gloving were perceived as the most necessary PPE items. Most staff were neutral or even unhappy about the precautionary measures. In particular, goggles were the least-welcome item, although they were believed to be necessary. Relationships between various demographic factors and the overall assessment rating were also investigated. The only statistically significant differences found pertained to occupation (P = 0.001) and gender (P = 0.034) regarding the necessity of the overall arrangement of universal precautions. Support staff and midwives found such preventive measures more necessary, and obstetricians found them much less necessary. Women held a more positive perception concerning the necessity of these measures. These results are congruent, as all midwives and most support staff in our unit are women.
