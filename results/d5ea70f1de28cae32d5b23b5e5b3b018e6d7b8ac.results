Eight of 17 puppies fed naturally infected bovine tissues shed N. caninum-like oocysts in their feces (Table 1) . All the oocysts shed by these puppies yielded a specific fragment the expected size for N. caninum after PCR-Nc5 and PCR-ITS-1 amplification. The PCR-ITS-1 sequences amplified from all the oocysts shed by these dogs were 100% identical to other N. caninum homologous sequences available in GenBank. Two ITS-1 haplotypes were detected and each of them corresponds to either one of the two haplotypes existing in N. caninum genome. These sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers HQ542298 and HQ542299 and they were 100% similar to GQ899205 and GQ899204, respectively. Mean N. caninum oocysts elimination was 2705, 1152, 960 and 317 for dogs that ingested heart, masseter, brain and liver, respectively. The dogs started shedding N. caninum oocysts at day 7 p.i. and oocysts were shed for 1-5 days (Table 1) . Four puppies (dogs 7, 9, 12 and 19) shed N. caninumlike oocysts, but none of these oocysts yielded fragments after PCR-Nc5 amplification. On the other hand, DNA extracted from these oocysts was successfully amplified by PCR-ITS-1. The PCR-ITS-1 sequences amplified from all the oocysts shed by these dogs were 100% identical to each other and 100% identical to other Hammondia hey-dorni homologous sequences available in GenBank. One of these sequences was deposited in GenBank under accession number HQ542300. Dogs that were fed brain and liver shed only N. caninum oocysts. Two of the dogs that shedding H. heydorni oocysts received heart tissue, whereas the other two dogs were fed masseter. Although heart and masseter also caused N. caninum infection in 4 dogs, the molecular analysis of oocysts shed by each dog revealed that dogs that shed N. caninum did not shed H. heydorni and vice versa. The total amount of H. heydorni oocysts shed by each dog was not determined and these dogs started the shedding at day 6 p.i. and oocysts were shed for 4-8 days (Table 1) . All dogs were negative for the presence of antibodies anti-N. caninum during all the experimental period (IFAT <50) and displayed no clinical signs of N. caninum infection after consuming cattle tissues.
