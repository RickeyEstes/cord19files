METH inhibits endothelial cell viability and disrupts cellcell barrier integrity. We initially determined if METH treatment reduced cell viability. The blood concentrations of METH in drug abusers are in the low micromolar range, with a median concentration of 1.25 mM. 10 Therefore, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to 1 mM METH for 24, 48 or 72 h and cell viability determined using a MTT assay. Although, no obvious change in viability was observed at 24 and 48 h with low concentration (1 mM) of METH, significant decrease in viability was observed at 72 h compared with control ( Figure 1a ). Next, we evaluated whether 1 mM METH affected endothelial cell barrier integrity. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and HUVECs were cultured on ECIS array electrodes, and transendothelial electrical resistance was monitored continuously over the course of 72 h. As shown in Figures 1b and c, no significant decrease in average transendothelial electrical resistance measurements was observed with 1 mM METH at 24 h but at 72 h, a 50% decrease in resistance was observed compared with control. Inhibition of apoptosis using 50 mM zVAD-fmk, a pancaspase inhibitor-attenuated METH-induced decrease in electrical resistance at 72 h supporting our hypothesis that METH exposure reduced electrical resistance at late time point due to cell death and autophagy maybe responsible for the early protective effects. METH induces LC3 recruitment and vesicular compartmentalization of LAMP1. To further determine if acute METH treatment induces an autophagic pro-survival response, we monitored different autophagy markers: LC3 vesicular recruitment and LAMP1. To analyze autophagosome formation, we used anti-LC3 immunofluorescence in a cell-based detection system with HUVECs. In 1 mM METH-treated cells, LC3 protein increased in total abundance and was aggregated in vesicular structures ( Figure 1d ). LC3 (ATG 8) is first cleaved by ATG4 to generate LC3-I and then lipidated to produce LC3-II. LC3-II is incorporated into the inner and outer surfaces of autophagosomes, and as such, remains associated with the autophagosome throughout the pathway. The lipidated (LC3-II) form can be detected as a faster-migrating band in western blots. 11, 12 The amount of LC3-II in the presence and absence of saturating levels of inhibitors, which can be used to examine the transit of LC3-II through the autophagic pathway; if autophagy flux is occurring, the levels of LC3-II will be higher in the presence of the inhibitors. Lysosomal degradation can be prevented through the use of protease inhibitors (e.g., pepstatin A and E-64d). 13 Our data demonstrate that the LC3-I/LC3-II conversion occurred rapidly, within 6 h, after METH treatment and was still detectable at 24 h post treatment in the presence of the protease inhibitors pepstatin A and E-64d (Figures 1e and f) . We also examined LAMP1 which is an integral glycoprotein residing in late endosomes and lysosomes. 14 HUVECs were transfected with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1green fluorescent protein (LAMP1-GFP) and then treated with vehicle or METH. In Figure 1g we show increased LAMP1-GFP-labeled vesicles in METH-treated HUVECs after 24 and 48 h, indicating induction of an autophagic response following 1 mM METH treatment. METH effects on endothelial cells are mediated via Beclin1/Bcl-2 interactions. Beclin1, a novel Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain-only protein, has an important part in both autophagosome formation and autolysosome fusion. Beclin1 and the class III phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) Vps34 form two distinct complexes. In complex I, which contributes to an autophagosome formation, Atg14L bridges Beclin1 and the Vps34-p150 complex. In complex II, which regulates the vacuolar protein sorting pathway, UV radiation resistance-associated gene product bridges Beclin1 and the Vps34-p150 complex. Bcl-2 family proteins negatively regulate the kinase activity of the Beclin1-Vps34 complex. 15, 16 Thus, accumulation of Beclin1 protein can be used as an indicator of autophagy induction. To further confirm METH-induced autophagy, we measured Beclin1 protein level using confocal microscopy. Our results showed an upregulation of Beclin1 in METH-treated HUVECs (Figure 2a) . Previous studies have shown that formation of a Beclin1/ Bcl-2 complex may function as a rheostat that regulates autophagic capacity and ensures that autophagy levels remain within a homeostatic range. 17 To determine whether METH treatment affected Beclin1 and Bcl-2 expression, total cellular levels of each protein were analyzed by western blots (Figure 2b ). Beclin1 levels increased around sixfold, whereas Bcl-2 levels decreased over the period of METH treatment ( Figure 2c ). The expression of Beclin1 was induced at 24 and 48 h of exposure, indicating induction of autophagy in METHtreated cells. To address the possibility that METH-modulated Beclin1 expression and the interaction with Bcl-2, Beclin1/Bcl-2 complexes were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against Beclin1. The western blots in Figures 2d and e showed that in control cells Bcl-2 co-immunoprecipitated with Beclin1 which decreased following 24 h of METH treatment. Together, these results suggested that METH-induced autophagy in endothelial cells was mediated by upregulating Beclin1 expression and disrupting the balance between Beclin1 and Bcl-2. Expression of Beclin1 is through the KOR. KOR, is highly expressed on HUVECs. 18 A growing body of evidence indicate that KOR may be involved in the modulation of abuse-related effects of CNS stimulants. 19, 20 Stimulation of KOR decreases acute amphetamine-induced behavior and mRNA expression of neuropeptides in the rat striatum. 21 To determine if KOR has a role in METH-induced autophagy, we examined the effects of the KOR antagonist nor-Binaltorphiminedihydrochloride (nor-BNI) pretreatment on inhibition of METH-induced Beclin1 expression. nor-BNI in a concentration-dependent manner inhibited METH-induced Beclin1 mRNA expression at the indicated concentrations of 1, 10 To confirm the specific role of the KOR antagonist nor-BNI in regulating Beclin1 expression, HUVECs were transfected with scramble siRNA or KOR siRNA. KOR and Beclin1 mRNA expression were detected by real-time PCR analysis. As shown in Figure 3f , KOR siRNA dramatically downregulated KOR mRNA level compared with scramble siRNA-transfected cells. We further examined Beclin1 mRNA expression in response to knockdown of KOR in the presence of METH treatment. As shown in Figure 3g , METH-induced Beclin1 mRNA expression was significantly decreased upon knockdown of KOR. METH activates the ERK1/2 pathway and inhibits the Akt/ mTOR pathway. Autophagy is a multi-step process and is highly regulated through the action of various kinases, phosphatases and guanosine triphosphatases(GT-Pases). [22] [23] [24] The following two pathways are known to be important in the regulation of autophagy: (i) The class I phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase (PI3K)/Akt/ mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) signaling pathway; and (ii) the Ras/Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2)/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway. 25 Therefore, we examined the upstream mediators that are involved in METH-induced autophagy using western blotting. METH treatment showed a sustained increase in the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2, the active form, visible 6 h post treatment (Figures 4a and b) . METH-induced ERK phosphorylation was inhibited when cells were pretreated with the KOR antagonist nor-BNI establishing the role of KOR in METH-induced autophagy (Figures 4c and d) . We then asked if in response to autophagic stimuli Beclin1 is upregulated through ERK signaling. In total, 0.1 mM, 1 mM, 10 mM and 20 mM PD98059 in a concentration-dependent manner inhibited METH-induced Beclin1 mRNA expression. A total of 20 mM PD98059 significantly inhibited METHinduced Beclin1 mRNA expression compared with METH treatment alone (Figure 4e ). Twenty micrometer PD98059 was used in the following experiments. Twenty micrometer PD98059 also significantly inhibited METH-induced Beclin1 protein expression (Figures 4f and g) . These data suggest that upregulation of Beclin1 is ERK-dependent. In contrast, treatment with METH showed a downregulation of phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated mTOR, 6 h post treatment (Figures 4h and i) . These results showed that METH induced autophagy in HUVECs by inhibiting the Akt/mTOR pathway and upregulating the ERK1/2 pathway. Inhibiting METH-induced autophagy triggers apoptotic cell death. Under pathological conditions, autophagy is considered to have a pro-survival role. 24 Therefore, we asked whether suppression of METH-induced autophagy may accelerate cell death. Therefore, two well-characterized inhibitors of autophagy, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine, were used in parallel in this study. 3-MA and chloroquine have different structures, different mechanisms of action and act at early and late stages of autophagy progression, respectively. 3-MA is a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor that prevents autophagy at the earliest stage of autophagosome formation. Chloroquine is a weak base that concentrates in acidic vesicles such as lysosomes and disrupts vesicular acidification compromising their degradative and recycling capacity. 26 First, we used 3-MA to examine whether inhibition of autophagy can enhance METH-induced apoptosis. HUVECs were either pretreated with or without 3-MA before the addition of 1 mM METH for 72 h. Cells were stained with Annexin V (green) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. 3-MA markedly increased apoptosis induction by METH at 72 h, as measured by Annexin V labeling. 3-MA alone caused minimal apoptosis at 72 h (Figures 5a and b) . These findings suggest that inhibition of autophagy can accelerate apoptosis. Second, 100 mM chloroquine also significantly increased METHinduced caspase-3 activity (Figure 5c ). These findings suggest that although 3-MA and chloroquine have different mechanisms of action, they both can accelerate METHinduced apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy. We have shown that KOR has a role in METH-induced autophagy (Figure 3 ). To determine whether inhibiting METHinduced autophagy triggers apoptosis, we also examined effects of the KOR antagonist pretreatment on METHinduced apoptotic cell death. Pretreatment with nor-BNI resulted in an increase in the number of apoptotic cells (12.90%) compared with METH treatment (8.14%) and control (1.32%) (Figure 5d ). To further determine the mechanism underlying METH-induced apoptosis in the context of an autophagic block, caspase activity was measured in METH-treated HUVECs using Caspase-Glo 8, Caspase-Glo 3/7 and Caspase-Glo 9 assay systems in the presence or absence of MEK inhibitor PD98059. Although METH treatment alone resulted in modest induction of caspase-3/7, the induction was dramatically increased when cells were pretreated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Figure 5e ). We also investigated the effect of knockdown of Beclin1 on the caspase-3 activity of HUVECs. HUVECs were transfected with Beclin1 siRNA. Beclin1 mRNA expression was detected by real-time PCR analysis. The activity of caspase-3 was also measured in HUVECs transfected with Beclin1 knockdown. The results showed that Beclin1 siRNA transfection significantly decreased the mRNA expression of Beclin1 in the transfected HUVECs compared with scramble siRNA transfection (Figure 5f ). METH significantly increased caspase-3 activity in the HUVECs with Beclin1 knockdown compared with METH treatment alone (Figure 5g ). In conclusion, METH promoted cell apoptosis in the presence of Beclin1 knockdown in HUVECs. These results further supported our hypothesis that acute treatment with METH triggered a pro-survival mechanism, and inhibition of signaling pathways leading to autophagy resulted in accelerated apoptosis.
