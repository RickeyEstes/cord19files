The cytotoxicity of AM against CRBC in the presence of hyperimmune serum was proportionally inverse to the serum dilution, and it was higher with the addition of negative sera indicating that it was not an antibody-dependent cytotoxicity ( Table 1 ). The spontaneous cytotoxicity of AM against CRBC is presented in Fig. 1 . It was noticed that PRV infected AM were less efficient at all effector to target ratios used. A total of five experiments were carried out. The counts per minute (CPM) ranged from 850 to 6500, while the total release ranged from 11,500 to 17,200. The AM infected with BUK were higher in activity as compared to the AM infected with S-62 or 4892, but still were below the chromium release values recorded by noninfected AM.
