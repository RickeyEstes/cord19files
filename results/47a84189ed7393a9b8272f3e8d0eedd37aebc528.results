During the 7-week period between March 10, 2003, and April 28, 2003, a total of 214 patients in whom SARS had been diagnosed were treated at PWH. A further 142 SARS patients were treated at UCH. From a total of 356 patients, the 6 patients reported on here represent an incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax complicating SARS of 1.7%. The clinical details of the six SARS patients developing spontaneous pneumothoraces are summarized in Table 1 . These patients included four men and two women, with a mean age of 48 years (age range, 32 to 82 years). None of the patients were smokers or had a history of pulmonary disease. Prior to the development of pneumothorax, none of the patients received any invasive procedures to the neck or chest, and none had received positive-pressure ventilatory support. In each of the six patients, the pneumothorax was first discovered on a chest radiograph that had been taken as a result of an acute increase in dyspnea. The mean time between hospital admission and the appearance of a pneumothorax was 24.3 days (range, 14 to 37 days). At the time of the pneumothorax, all patients were clinically dyspneic, and five required maximal oxygen therapy via masks. They had each received a mean dose of 5.0 g IV methylprednisolone (dose range, 4.5 to 5.5 g). The mean peak lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level for the six patients was 655.5 U/L (range, 301 to 854 U/L), and the mean neutrophil count was 14.5 ϫ 10 9 neutrophils per liter (range, 7.5 ϫ 10 9 to 21.2 ϫ 10 9 neutrophils per liter). Three patients developed bilateral pneumothoraces, two had a right pneumothorax only, and one had a left pneumothorax only. Four patients received chest tube insertions for treatment of the pneumothorax, with three patients (cases 1, 3, and 4) reporting good initial relief of dyspnea. In all four patients who received chest tube insertion, persistent air leakage was noted. Surgical management was considered for these patients but ultimately was not undertaken. The factors taken into consideration included the severe compromise of each patient's lung function, which contributed to high anesthetic risk, and, most importantly, the ongoing SARS in each patient, which posed a potential infection risk to all operating room staff. 12 It was envisaged that endotracheal intubation, positive-pressure ventilation, lung manipulation during surgery, and the process of postoperative extubation might increase the risk of releasing virus-laden droplets into the operating theater environment. In the presence of a new infectious disease, the means of transmission of which had not been determined at the time, this represented a serious consideration. In case 1, the abundance of pleural adhesions noted on chest radiograph and CT scan also would give rise to a difficult operation with the possibility of intraoperative bleeding and significant postoperative air leakage. This added consideration mitigated against surgery for that patient. Using treatment with chest drainage alone, the air leaks in the four patients spontaneously resolved after a mean duration of 23.5 days (range, 14 to 31 days). In all six cases, pleurodesis, either chemical or surgical, was not used. Three patients were admitted to the ICU because of exacerbations of dyspnea resulting from pneumothoraces. Two patients (cases 4 and 5) required mechanical ventilatory support for the respiratory distress resulting from their bilateral pneumothoraces. In both cases, the effect of positive-pressure ventilation was to increase air leakage, which was manifested by an increasing pneumothorax despite drainage with a single chest tube in case 4 and surgical emphysema in case 5. No patient in this study died as a direct result of their pneumothoraces. The patient in case 2 died of multiple organ failure related to generalized systemic inflammation. In case 4, the patient's bilateral pneumothoraces had been adequately drained, and she died from diffuse inflammation of the lungs rather than from mechanical respiratory compromise as a result of the pneumothoraces.
