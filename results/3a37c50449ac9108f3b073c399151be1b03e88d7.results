Overall, patients with confi rmed MERS-CoV were aged between 2 and 94 years (median 56 years, IQR 41-68·5) and most were men ( We obtained an R 0 of 0·60 (95% CI 0·42-0·80) for scenario 1 and 0·69 (0·50-0·92) for scenario 2. The number of transmission trees for each scenario provided the number of MERS-CoV introductions into the human population during the period of data acquisition. Hence, we obtained yearly introduction rates of 22·3 (95% CI 13·0-31·5) and 17·1 (9·0-25·3) for scenario 1 and 2, respectively. We also obtained an R 0 of 0·80 (0·54-1·13) for prepandemic SARS. Repeating the analyses assuming the size of the Jordanian cluster to be between two and 13 or excluding the outstanding event of six secondary cases caused by patient C of the Al-Hasa cluster in the dialysis ward 15 showed the robustness of our results (appendix). As shown in fi gure 2A, the average tree size is very sensitive to the value of R 0 , particularly when R 0 is close to 1. We further studied the expected yearly incidence of MERS-CoV infections, calculated by multiplying the intro duction rate into the human population by the average tree size, 1 / (1 -R 0 ). 11 Figure 2B shows a contour map of the yearly incidence versus the introduction rate and R 0 . Non-linear dependence qualifi es R 0 as the key parameter, particularly for values close to 1. On the same fi gure 2B, we plotted the parameters corresponding to our scenarios 1 and 2 and showed the region in the parameter space most likely to include the true parameters of MERS-CoV. This plot suggests that the possibility of MERS-CoV having an R 0 above 1 or less than 0·4, or a yearly introduction rate above 35, is very small. To assess the potential eff ect of future MERS-CoV outbreaks on our R 0 estimation, we analysed the change in the probability that R 0 exceeds 1 versus the tree size that would be observed next (fi gure 2C). In scenario 2, a tree larger than 98 cases would imply that the probability of having a pandemic MERS-CoV strain exceeds 5%. In scenario 1, reaching the 5% threshold would need the next observed tree to consist of 200 cases. When active contact tracing is operational, public health authorities might immediately stop viral transmission after the index patient has been diagnosed, and thus the available data would be just the number of secondary cases of the index patient before their isolation. This situation is addressed in fi gure 2D in which, in scenario 2, the 5% probability threshold is reached if the The average tree size versus R 0 as predicted by the theory of homogeneous branching processes. The dark blue and red dashed lines correspond to the values of R 0 that we calculated for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. (B) Contour plot of the expected Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) yearly incidence versus introduction rate into the human population and R 0 . The very dark blue region corresponds to yearly incidence estimates below 10. The dark red region corresponds to yearly incidence estimates above 320. All other solid colour regions correspond to yearly incidence estimates bounded by the values shown on the contours. The black square and red circle show the parameter sets of scenarios 1 and 2, respectively; the error bars represent the corresponding 95% CIs. As a visual aid, we have shaded the region comprising the parameter sets compatible with scenarios 1, 2, and the in-between area compatible with intermediate scenarios. (C) The probability that R 0 exceeds 1 versus the size of the next MERS-CoV transmission tree; the horizontal dashed line corresponds to the 5% probability. (D) The probability that R 0 exceeds 1 versus the size of the next count of secondary cases of an index patient; the horizontal dashed line corresponds to the 5% probability. R 0 =basic reproduction number (the number of secondary cases per index case in a fully susceptible population). next index patient caused eight secondary cases. In scenario 1, the 5% threshold is reached if the next index patient caused 14 secondary cases.
