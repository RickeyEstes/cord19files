Fifteen patients (11 women and 4 men) satisfying the criteria for clinically or laboratory-supported definite MS according to [23, 24] were retrospectively selected for the study. Of these, 13 were relapsing-remitting (RR), and 2 were primary progressive (PP) in agreement with the criteria of Lublin and Reingold [25] . Clinical course (RR and PP), clinical activity (relapse at time of sampling), and MRI activity (the presence of gadolinium enhancing lesions at MRI examination) were analyzed as described previously [26] . The characteristics of the MS patients are summarized in Table 1 . It was interesting to compare some different indexes for CSF and sera of MS patients. Therefore, first we measured a relative concentration of total protein in CSF and sera of MS patients ( Table 2 ). The relative concentrations of total protein of CSFs (range 0.26-0.66 mg/ml) and sera (47-74 mg/ml) of fifteen MS patients varied in different ranges. The average concentration of total protein in the serum (62.566.7 mg/ml) was ,130-fold higher compared with CSF (0.4860.09 mg/ml) and these values did not demonstrate a good correlation (coefficient correlation (CC) = 20.12; p,0.05), Table 2 ). The relative concentration of total IgGs in the serum (range 7.87-16.6 mg/ml; average value (11.761.8 mg/ml) was 195-fold higher than that for CSF (range (1.9-13.6610 22 mg/ml; average value (6.063.1)610 22 mg/ml) and there was not a good correlation between these values, CC = 0.4 (p,0.05). Interestingly, the concentration of total protein in CSF was 8-fold higher than total IgGs, while this difference in the case of the serum (,5.4-fold) was by a factor of approximately 1.5 lower. Then, we estimated the relative concentration of IgGs containing kappa and lambda light chains in serum and CSF. The relative content of l-Abs in the sera of all patients was comparable (range 10.0-13.8% of total Abs; average value 12.360.6% or 1.460.07 mg/ml), while in the case of CSF it was remarkably varied (range 5.1-10.8%; average value 8.061.7% or (0.4860.1)610 22 mg/ml) (Fig. 1A) , no good correlation was observed, CC = 0.40 (p,0.05). The relative content of k-Abs in the sera was significantly higher (range 86.2-89.9%; average value 87.760.6% or 10.360.07 mg/ml), and a similar situation was observed in the case of CSF (range 89.7-96.2%; average value 9261.7% or (5.560.1)610 22 mg/ml). Overall, the relative content of l-Abs (% of total Abs) in the sera was approximately 1.54-fold statistically significantly higher, while the content of k-Abs was ,1.1-fold statistically significantly lower than that for CSF ( In the next step, we compared the relative content of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 in CSF and sera (Fig. 2) Fig. 2A ) and the difference in values in sera was significantly higher in the various patients ( Table 2 ). The biggest difference in CSF and sera Abs was observed in the case of IgG3 and IgG4. The average content of IgG3 in the sera was 1.5-fold statistically significantly lower (p = 9.3610 26 ), while IgG4 1.92-fold statistically significantly higher (p = 1.5610 25 ) than those in the case of CSF ( Fig. 2B and 2D ). For all MS patients the content of IgG3 (range 6.8-10.0%; average value 8.260.6% or (0.4960.04)610 22 mg/ml) and IgG4 (range 1.8-3.5%; average value 2.560.4% or (0.1560.02)610 22 mg/ml) in CSF was different. In general, the content of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 of different subclasses in the case of CSF (40.4, 49.0, 8.2, and 2.5%) and the sera (53.6, 36, 5.6, and 4.8%) decreased in different order. In the case of CSF, the content (%) of IgG2 and IgG3 was higher than that in the sera. The highest content of IgG1 was observed in sera, while IgG2 for CSF (Fig. 2 ). All data summarized in Table 2 . Serum anti-MBP Abs in sera of MS patients were reported in several articles [17, 27, 28] , while there were no available data of these auto-Abs in CSFs of MS patients. We used ELISA to compare the relative levels of Abs against MBP in the sera and CSFs of 15 MS patients and seven healthy donors. Relative indexes of anti-MBP Abs in the sera of tested patients varied from 0.15 to 0.54, in average 0.3260.08 A 450 units (Fig. 3 ). In the case of seven healthy donors the relative indexes of anti-MBP Abs varied from 0.015 to 0.14 A 450 and average value 0.0860.05 A 450 was approximately 4-fold lower than that for MS patients. These data was are in agreement with previously published results, according which the concentrations of auto-Abs against MBP in the sera of healthy donors is not zero and changed from 0.02 to 0.16 A 450 units, in average 0.0960.04 [17] . Using the same method and test system, it was shown that the indexes of anti-MBP Abs for CSF of the 15 MS patients in terms of the same dilution CSF and serum preparations, varied from 2610 24 to 4.3610 23 A 450 units, in average (1.460.72)610 23 A 450 units (Fig. 3) . We could not estimate real indexes of anti-MBP Abs in CSF of seven healthy donors, since A 450 values in this case did not remarkably differ from background values. Thus, the average relative content of anti-MBP Abs in the sera of MS patients is approximately 230-fold higher than in the corresponding CSFs. At the same time the relative content of total IgGs in the sera is 195fold higher than in the CSFs (Table 2 ). It means, that CSFs are on average approximately ,1.2 depleted with Abs against MBP in relation to a total amount of antibodies compared to the same ratio of sera, and there is no good correlation between anti-MBP of CSFs and sera, CC = +0.02 (p,0.05). Recently we have demonstrated that highly purified IgGs from the sera of MS and SLE patients catalyze hydrolysis of MBP [17, 29, 30] . In this work, similarly to [17] [18] [19] [20] 29, 30] , electrophoretically and immunologically homogeneous IgGs were purified from CSFs and sera of MS patients and healthy donors by sequential chromatography on protein A-Sepharose under condi- tions that remove non-specifically bound proteins, followed by gel filtration in an acidic buffer destroying immune complexes. The homogeneity of the 150-kDa csf-IgG mix and ser-IgG mix (equal amounts of electrophoretically homogeneous IgGs from 15 preparations of CSFs and sera, denote these preparations as respectively csf-IgG mix and ser-IgG mix ) was confirmed by SDS-PAGE with silver staining, which showed a single band under nonreducing conditions and two bands corresponding to the heavy and light chains after reduction (Fig. 4A ). Csf-IgG mix and ser-IgG mix corresponding to seven healthy donors were also electrophoretically homogeneous. First, it was shown that all individual and mixed IgG preparations from CSFs (csf-IgG mix ) and sera (ser-IgG mix ) efficiently hydrolyze MBP (see below). Then, electrophoretically homogeneous csf-IgG mix was used. To prove that MBP-hydrolyzing activity of csf-IgG mix is an intrinsic property of MS Abs, we have applied several of known rigid criteria [11] [12] [13] [14] 31] . The most important of these criteria are given below: a) electrophoretic homogeneity of csf-IgG mix and ser-IgG mix (Fig. 4A) ; b) FPLC gelfiltration of csf-IgG mix under conditions of ''acidic shock'' (pH 2.6) did not lead to a disappearance of the activity, and the peak of proteolytic activity tracked exactly with 150 kDa IgGs (the proteolytic activity is absent in zones corresponding to molecular masses, 20-28 kDa, of known canonical proteases) (Fig. 4B) ; c) complete adsorption of the MBP-hydrolyzing activity by anti-IgG Sepharose leading to a disappearance of the catalytic activity from the solution and its elution from the adsorbent with buffer of acidic pH (Fig. 4C) . Similar results were obtained for ser-IgG mix . It was shown previously, that IgG from sera of healthy donors cannot hydrolyze MBP [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Csf-IgG mix and ser-IgG mix corresponding to seven healthy donors analyzed in this article were also catalytically inactive after FPLC gel-filtration of Abs mix under conditions of ''acidic shock'' and affinity chromatography on anti-IgG Sepharose. To exclude possible artifacts due to hypothetical traces of contaminating canonical enzymes, the csf-IgG mix and ser-IgG mix preparations were separated by SDS-PAGE and its MBPhydrolyzing activity was detected after the extraction of proteins from the separated gel slices (Fig. 4D) . It is known that canonical proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, chymotrypsinogen etc) are enzymes of relatively low molecular masses, which are relatively easy to significant restore their enzymatic activity after their treatment with SDS. Since SDS dissociates any protein complexes, and the electrophoretic mobility of the usually low molecular mass proteases (,20-30 kDa) cannot coincide with that of intact IgGs (or Ab complexes with proteases), the detection of proteolytic activity in the gel region corresponding only to intact IgGs from CSFs and sera, provides direct evidence that CSF and serum IgGs do not contain admixtures of canonical proteases and possess MBP-hydrolyzing activity. In addition, csf-IgG mix and ser-IgG mix corresponding to seven healthy donors were also inactive after SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (for, example Fig. 4D) . It was shown previously, that polyclonal SLE and MS anti-MBP IgGs purified on MBP-Sepharose hydrolyze only MBP, but not many other tested proteins [17] [18] [19] [20] [29] [30] . Similar situation was observed in the case of abzymes against other proteins and peptides: HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and integrase, human serum albumin, casein, thyroglobulin, and intestinal vasoactive peptide [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . However, IgG pools from the sera of patients with SLE and HIV-infected patients before their separation on sorbents bearing immobilized specific proteins can contain small fractions of abzymes hydrolyzing several various proteins including human serum albumin, casein, HIV reverse transcriptase and integrase [32] [33] [34] . Therefore, we could not exclude, that IgGs from CSFs and sera of some MS patients can contain small fractions of enzymes specifically hydrolyzing human serum albumin, casein, thyroglobulin, or some other proteins. At the same time, we did not find in the sera of various patients with autoimmune diseases abzymes hydrolyzing several other control proteins: hen egg lysozyme, human milk lactalbumin and lactoferrin [32] [33] [34] . Therefore, these three proteins, easily cleavable by canonical proteases, were used for analysis of csf-IgG mix and ser-IgG mix substrate specificity. Fig. 5A shows, that csf-IgG mix efficiently cleave MBP, but cannot in the same conditions remarkably hydrolyze these three control proteins. Similar result was obtained for ser-IgG mix (Fig. 5B) . It is known, that classical mammalian, bacterial, and viral proteases are mostly unspecific and capable to hydrolyze any proteins or specific to bacterial and viral proteins. In contrast to canonical proteases, MS IgGs specifically hydrolyzed only MBP, but not other control tested proteins These data also indicate that IgG preparations from CSFs and sera do not contain impurities of classical human, bacterial, or viral proteases. It is known that due to alternative splicing of cDNA, animal and human MBP can consist of several related forms of different molecular masses (21.5, 18.5, 17.5, and 14.0 kDa) [36] . In addition, MBP may partially be hydrolyzed in human cells and during protein purification [37] . Therefore, highly purified preparations of MBP are usually not homogeneous and according to SDS-PAGE they can contain several protein bands, of which ,18.5 kDa is usually major [37] . In this study we have used 18.5 kDa MBP containing no remarkable amounts of other forms of the protein. First, the relative activity of CSF Abs in the MBP cleavage was calculated from the decrease in the intensity of Coomassie-stained ,18.5 kDa MBP band after electrophoresis as in [17] [18] [19] ; the difference in the intensities of the protein, incubated in the absence and in the presence of Abs, was used for our calculations. To quantitatively estimate the protease activity, we have found a low concentration for each IgG preparation corresponding to the reaction of the first order, where the major ,18.5 kDa MBP fraction is converted into products during hydrolysis within the linear regions of IgG concentration (for example, Fig. 6C demonstrates data for csf-IgG mix ) and the time courses (15-40% of conversion; for example, Fig. 6A , lanes 3 Table 3 ). The RAs of IgGs from sera were significantly lower and IgGs were used in higher concentrations (0.1-0.3 mg/ml), dependently of the preparation, the reaction mixtures were incubated for 8-20 h. The (Table 3) . It was surprising, but the average specific RA of IgGs from CSFs was about 58.6-fold higher than Abs from the sera. The ratio of specific RAs of MBP-hydrolyzing IgGs in the case of CSFs and serum of individual patients varied in the range 7 -194-fold (Table 3 ). The coefficient of correlation (+0.42, p,0.05) between the anti-MBP hydrolyzing IgGs in the CSFs and sera is positive, but low. The CCs between the anti-MBP Abs titers (A 450 ) and MBP-hydrolyzing activity in the case of CSF (20.18, p,0.05) and sera (20.1, p,0.05) were negative and also very low.
