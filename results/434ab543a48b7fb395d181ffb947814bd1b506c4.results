The disulfide-linked FL of EBOV GP2 contains two highly conserved histidines (green), two highly conserved glutamates (red), a highly conserved threonine and glutamine (both light green), two highly conserved positively charged residues (blue, just outside the loop), and two less well conserved aspartates (orange) (Fig 1) . The three-dimensional structures of this loop in the presence of DPC micelles were previously determined by NMR at pH 7 and pH 5.5 [15] . In order to determine which residues were surface exposed, interfacial, or buried in the hydrophobic core of the lipid micelles we performed Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement (PRE) experiments in the presence of the soluble relaxation agent Gd-(DTPA) and the lipid bound relaxation agents 5-DSA and 16-DSA. The nitroxide in 5-DSA is placed closer to the micelle interface and therefore probes interfacial residues whereas the nitroxide in 16-DSA is buried more deeply in the hydrophobic core of the lipid micelles and therefore probes more deeply penetrating residues. Fig 2a shows the quenching of amide HSQC cross-peaks of the EBOV FL by all three paramagnetic relaxation agents relative to the unperturbed intensities at pH 5.5. As expected, the previously identified hydrophobic patch residues highlighted in yellow are strongly quenched by 5-DSA and 16-DSA, but not by Gd-(DTPA). As also expected, Lys510 is highly water exposed (quenched by Gd-(DTPA), but not by 5-DSA and 16-DSA) and Asp522 and Asp552 show a similar water-exposed quenching profile. 5-DSA and 16-DSA show similar, although not identical, quenching profiles. The reason for this is that the FL inserts into lipid bilayers interfacially and does not penetrate very deeply into lipid bilayers or micelles. Previous fluorescence quenching using brominated lipids and molecular dynamics simulation results in lipid bilayers showed that the FL penetrates only~8Å in one leaflet of the bilayer [17] , confirming this interpretation. In addition, the lipids in a micelle are very dynamic and the nitroxides likely visit many depths over the course of these experiments. Interestingly, Glu540 and Glu545, are much less water or lipid exposed than Asp522 and Asp552 according to the quenching data of Fig 2a, although the interfacial quencher 5-DSA is most effective for these residues. This may be due to their close spatial proximity to the hydrophobic patch in the FL. His516 and His549 are interesting because they are quenched by all quenchers and most by 5-DSA indicating their interfacial location in the micelle at pH 5.5. The hydrophilic conserved residue Thr519 shows a similar, but less well expressed interfacial quenching pattern whereas conserved Gln551 is also quenched by all quenchers, but best by Gd-(DTPA), indicating a fairly water-exposed orientation. Arg559 also appears to be more interfacial than the spatially close-by and also cationic Lys510. A summary of these data depicting the relative water and lipid exposures of most residues of the EBOV FL is shown in the surface contour plots of its micelle-bound pH 5.5 structure shown in Fig 2b, where red indicates lipid-penetrating, blue water-exposed, and green interfacial residues. We hypothesized that conserved interfacial residues or residues that are partially buried in the lipid bilayer and that can be protonated at pH 5.5 would be the most likely candidates to change the structure and lipid affinity of the EBOV FL upon changing the pH from 7 to 5.5. Clearly the two histidines, but also the two highly conserved glutamates that might have shifted pKa's because of their proximity to a hydrophobic environment would be excellent candidates to serve as pH sensors for the observed changes. Indeed, when His516 was changed to an Ala, fusion of liposomes as measured by lipid mixing was reduced to 20% of wild-type (Fig 3c) . By contrast, changing His549 to an Ala had almost no effect on fusion. Glu540 and Glu545 to Ala changes also did not affect the fusion activity of the FL. The two positively charged residues that are located in close proximity at the beginning and end of the loop also had no effect on fusion when changed to alanines. Changing the conserved Thr519 or Gln551 did not affect fusion either. (Q551A exhibited a higher fusion activity than wild-type, perhaps because it made that region of the FL more hydrophobic.) The only other residue that caused some reduction of the fusion activity when changed to an alanine was Asp522 (Fig 3c) . By contrast, changing Asp552 to an Ala had very little effect on fusion. The relative locations of these side chains Several conserved hydrophilic residues that might serve as potential pH sensors are highlighted: dark green-histidine, light green-threonine or glutamine, blue-lysine or arginine, red glutamate, orange-aspartates (not highly conserved). The sequence of Zaire EBOV (strain Mayinga-76) was used in this study and its residue numbers and a disulfide link that defines the fusion loop are indicated at the bottom. Basic residues are shown in blue, acidic residues in red, histidines in green, hydrophilic residues in light green, and non-conserved acidic/hydrophilic residues in orange. Fig 3a and 3b , respectively. We also tested the ability of some of these mutant proteins to cause liposomes to leak contents. Generally, the content release assays tracked the lipid mixing assays and the effects of the same mutations on lipid mixing were greater than on content leakage from the liposomes (S1 Fig) . In order to determine if abolishment of the titratable charge on His516 or another feature in this position was responsible for the observed fusion behavior, we changed His516 into permanently charged Arg, a bulkier hydrophobic Leu, or the three aromatic residues Trp, Tyr, and Phe (Fig 3d) . Fixing a positive charge on residue 516 in H516R did not recover its fusion activity. We hypothesized that His516 is protonated at low pH and mutating His516 to an arginine should keep this positive charge on residue 516 and thereby shift its pH dependency. Apparently protonation of His516 is not required to confer fusion activity to the FL. When His516 was mutated to other ring structures such as Trp, Tyr, or Phe, which all have strong tendencies to partition into membrane interfaces [35] like the native His516 does in the current structure (Fig 2) , the pH-dependent fusion activity of the FL was restored. On the other hand, when His516 was replaced with the aliphatic side chain of leucine that likely pulls this residue deeper into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer, fusion was greatly diminished. Consistent with the relative insensitivity of the fusion activity to protonation of His516, the pH-dependence of the secondary structure as measured by CD spectroscopy of the EBOV FL in POPC/POPG SUVs was not dramatically changed either when this histidine was replaced by an alanine, arginine or tyrosine (Fig 4) . The H516A and H516R mutations are stable at all pH values down to pH 5.0 and become somewhat cloudy after repeated CD measurements at pH 4.5 when performed at 21 μM. The H516Y mutant is stable at all pH values at a concentration of 21 μM. Thus, the CD spectra are reliable down to pH 5.0 for H516A and H516R and down to pH 4.5 for H516Y and wild-type. All wild-type NMR studies were conducted at pH 5.5 at a concentration of 100 μM or greater where they were stable. The mutant H516Y was only marginally stable and the H516A and H516R mutants were not stable under these NMR conditions, which is why we were unable to perform reliable NMR studies of these mutants. Short of such NMR measurements that could have provided residue-specific secondary structure information, we believe that the CD data support our notion that the global secondary structure of our mutants has not changed under fusion conditions, which are typically performed at pH 5.0 at a concentration of 21 μM. To further prove this point, we show in S2 Fig that the wild-type and mutant CD spectra in DPC and pH 5.5 (NMR conditions) overlay very well and the POPC vesicle data at pH 6.0 overlay reasonably well on each other. Since the histidine in position 549 is less well conserved than His516 and since in some strains a glutamate occurs in this position (Fig 1) , we also changed His549 to a glutamate. Fig 3d shows that a glutamate is also tolerated in this position. Although individual alanine mutations in E540A and E545A had no effect on fusion, the different positions of these two glutamates in the pH 7 and pH 5.5 structures (Fig 3a and 3b) suggested that protonation of one or the other residue might be sufficient to cause their reorientation and trigger pH-dependent fusion. To test for this possibility, we prepared the double mutant E540A/E545A. Even this mutant had a similar fusion activity as wild-type (Fig 3e) . Since the pKa's of aspartates are lower than those of glutamates and since this effect might be exacerbated in membrane-mimetic environments, we also prepared the single and double aspartate mutants E540D, E545D, and E540D/E545D. Fig 3e shows that single mutants showed similar fusion activities, but the double mutant exhibited a lower fusion activity at pH 5.5. This figure also shows that changing Asp522 to an Arg does not significantly change the fusion activity of this mutant, i.e., unlike the neutral alanine, a positive or negative charge in position 522 supports the fusion activity of the FL. We also wanted to know if the same mutations built into GP1/GP2 on virus-like particles (VLPs) had an effect on their ability to enter cells. To this end, we tested the most promising pH sensor mutants H516A and E540D/E545D . Fig 3f shows that the H516A mutation did not change the entry behavior of wild-type under the tested conditions. The E540D/E545D double mutation showed a slight (~20%), but not dramatic reduction in cell entry. These results confirm that the three residues His516, Glu540 and Glu545 are not the primary pH sensors for fusion in the VLP cell entry system. Charged residues have been identified in or near the Nand C-terminal heptad repeats of the GP2 ectodomain of the related Marburg virus that stabilize the six-helix bundle structure at low vs. neutral pH [36, 37] . These and other factors may be responsible for the pH sensitivity of EBOV entry. Our lipid mixing and content leakage results of Fig 3c-3e and S1 Fig, combined with our VLP entry results of Fig 3f show that fusion of liposomes mediated by the expressed FL is sensitive to additional environmental factors that play a lesser role in the VLP cell entry assay.
