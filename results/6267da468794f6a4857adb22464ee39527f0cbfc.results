In the UK, the policy trajectory for professional development in public health shows an increasing emphasis on the acquisition of health improvement skills and competency-based frameworks at all levels [25] [26] [27] [28] to support the development of a 'fully engaged scenario'. 25 There is now, in essence, a framework that could be utilized to form the progressive steps of a 'skills escalator' 29 model for public health and health improvement by The web-based survey used the free-text terms 'public health' and 'post graduate' to identify the universities offering postgraduate public health and/or MPH courses in the UK. The case study involved a series of informal interviews with key stakeholders in Hong Kong to establish the levels of support for and understanding of the proposed changes. E-mails were sent out at the time of the Hong Kong case study to identify any grey literature of relevance, identifying only one other study. 21 A copy of the interim report from this study was obtained. The web-based survey and competency analysis was undertaken as part of an MSc dissertation submitted by one of the authors. 22 defining what is expected of staff working at each of the workforce levels, and increasingly within each of the domains of practice. The standardized competency framework for specialists 30 and practitioners [31] [32] [33] in public health is already in place at a generic level, and work is underway to define the intraspecialism and entry-level competencies. 34 With the introduction of 'Agenda for change' and the underpinning knowledge and skills framework, the relationship between demonstration of competency and standards of practice is articulated across the whole of the health service workforce. Alongside this notion of a wider workforce for public health, the professionally led response has been to put developmental work into place that defines more clearly what is meant by being a 'specialist' in this wider conceptualization of the workforce, with explicit articulation of what it means to be a 'competent' specialist or a 'competent' practitioner (Table 1) . However, a recent review of the specialist examination system suggested that this model is incompletely reflected in postgraduate educational provision for public health development. 35 The survey of provision identified 55 universities in the UK offering public health courses, of which 35 were marketing their MPH course as generic. Analysis was restricted to these 35 generic courses. Looking across the spectrum of modular provision across the courses, perhaps unsurprisingly, labelling of modules was inconsistent, with 310 different titles in operation. However, the accompanying notes suggested that despite labelling inconsistencies, there was consistency in the coverage and stated purpose of the modules, for example in the skills and knowledge development offered within health protection courses ( Table 2) . MPH course descriptions were analysed to identify those that referenced the Faculty of Public Health (FPH)/Voluntary Register and the National Occupational Standards (NOS) for Public Health explicitly. Twenty-three course descriptions did not mention the existence of the competency frameworks currently in operation in the UK, or of the FPH or the Voluntary Register. These descriptions tended to suggest that the courses were intersectoral and interprofessional, non-medical, internationally relevant and supported working in the 'broad field of public health'. However, module descriptions within these courses were comparable with those that did make explicit references to the FPH and NOS, sharing no common modular content or description that was not identifiable in the other category (Table 3 ).
