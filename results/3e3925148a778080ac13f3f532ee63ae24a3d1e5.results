The E2-L210Q substitution is responsible for increased CHIKV dissemination in A. albopictus To investigate the effect of the E2-L210Q substitution on CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus mosquitoes, we employed a reverse genetics approach based on the SL-CK1 strain of CHIKV (hereafter abbreviated SL07), isolated in 2007 in Sri Lanka [9] . Previous phylogenetic studies indicated that SL07 evolved from the Indian subgroup of IOL and represents one of the most closely related isolates to strains responsible for CHIKV outbreaks in India (including the Kerala state) [9, 48] . The SL07 isolate was passed only twice on Vero cells since its isolation from a febrile patient, thus limiting the potential for cell culture-adaptive mutations that can artificially influence alphavirus fitness in vertebrate and/or mosquito hosts. The SL-07 strain has an alanine residue at E1 position 226 and a leucine residue at E2-210, corresponding to prototype IOL strain introduced into India in late 2005. Since the E2-L210Q substitution was only detected in CHIKV strains form Kerala that had previously acquired the A. albopictus-adaptive E1-A226V substitution [24] , single E1-A226V and double (E1-A226V and E2-L210Q) substitutions were introduced into an infectious clone (i.c.), generated from the SL07 strain using site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, a clone with the single E1-A226V substitution (SL07-226V) was genetically marked by introducing a synonymous mutation 6454ARC that creates an ApaI restrictase site (SL07-226V-Apa). Previously we demonstrated that the 6454ARC substitution does not
