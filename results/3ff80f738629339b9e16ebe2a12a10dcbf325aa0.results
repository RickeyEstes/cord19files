Strategy for Identification of bona fide ISG15 sites. In order to elucidate mechanisms of action of ISG15, we used mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to identify ISG15 modification sites in an unbiased manner. We analyzed liver tissue from mice infected with Listeria monocytogenes and enriched peptides that carry a diglycine adduct following digestion with trypsin. To distinguish bona fide ISGylation sites from ubiquitin sites, which share a conserved C-terminal LRLRGG motif (Fig. 1a) , we compared wild-type (WT) mice with Isg15-deficient mice (KO). In addition, we mapped sites in mice bearing a knock-in (KI) mutation in USP18 C61A/C61A , which renders it catalytically inactive, leading to hyper-ISGylation following infection, a condition which is biologically interesting in addition to being a positive control for our screen (Fig. 1a) . USP18 has two distinct mechanisms of action: (i) it removes ISG15 from substrates and (ii) it negatively regulates STAT signaling 9 . Since USP18 deletion cannot distinguish between these functions, we first assessed whether the deconjugase-dead (USP18 C61A/C61A ) mouse would be resistant to Listeria infection. USP18 C61A/C61A mice exhibit increased resistance to viral infection, but are otherwise phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type littermates 21 . However, surprisingly Listeria infection of USP18 C61A/C61A mice leads to a significant increase in bacterial load in the liver relative to wildtype controls (Fig. 1b) . While there was also a slight but significant increase in bacterial burden in the spleen in USP18 C61A/ C61A animals, the bacterial counts in the liver indicated an unusual susceptibility in that organ. Histological sections of infected liver revealed larger more diffuse bacterial foci which penetrated into neighboring hepatocytes in USP18 C61A/C61A animals, whereas in wild-type animals the bacteria were primarily contained within immune cells (Fig. 1c ). In addition, Gram staining confirmed the presence of many more bacteria per focus in USP18 C61A/C61A , relative to wild-type animals, as the CFUs per organ indicated (Fig. 1c) . Accordingly, the liver tissue from infected USP18 C61A/C61A mice also displayed enhanced ISGylation compared with the WT (Fig. 1d) . Together, these data indicate a tissue-specific role for ISGylation in the liver upon Listeria infection, and provided a rationale to map ISG15 sites in the liver of USP18 C61A/C61A animals compared with wild-type animals. Consequently, for the proteomics analysis, we infected Isg15 −/− , wild-type, and USP18 C61A/C61A mice via intravenous injection and harvested liver tissue following 72 h of infection. We also included a noninfected cohort. Upon trypsin digestion and enrichment of diglycine adducts from the liver, diglycinemodified peptides were identified and quantified. Following statistical analysis and non-supervised hierarchical clustering, significantly regulated sites grouped into four major clusters. Moreover, animals also clustered together by genotype and condition, indicating the high reproducibility of our approach (Fig. 2a) . Prior to infection,~1000 ubiquitin sites were identified across all three conditions (cluster 4). Listeria infection led to a global downregulation of these ubiquitin sites, as previously observed for both ubiquitin and SUMO modification in vitro 38, 46 . We also identified 219 ubiquitin sites that arise following infection (cluster 3). Most importantly, we were able to identify 614 ISG15 sites on 292 proteins induced by Listeria infection (cluster 2). The majority of these sites are completely absent in Isg15 −/− -deficient animals as indicated in gray (Fig. 2a Fig. 1 Strategy for Identification of ISG15 sites and the effect of enhanced ISGylation on bacterial infection. a C-terminal amino acid sequence of Ubiquitin, ISG15, and NEDD8 followed by the experimental design of proteomic identification of ISG15 diglycine sites.

Since USP18 is concomitantly induced with ISG15 following Listeria infection, we suspect that certain substrates are deconjugated more rapidly than others. Future work should address this hypothesis by site identification during a time course. To avoid mistakenly identifying ubiquitin or NEDD8 sites as ISG15 sites (due to possible indirect effects of Isg15 deletion or USP18 C61A/C61A mutation), we assessed whether ubiquitin and NEDD8 levels appear to vary using SDS-PAGE prior to or following infection ( Supplementary Fig. 1a, b) . If anything, ubiquitin and NEDD8sites decreased following infection in vivo while ISGylation increased, as was previously observed for ubiquitin 46 and as is a new observation for NEDD8 (Supplementary Figs. 1b, 2e) . In vitro total ubiquitin did not dramatically change in mouse embryonic fibroblasts 24 h post infection, whereas NEDD8 was slightly reduced (Supplementary Fig. 1e ). Furthermore, a comparison of sites identified by quantitative diglycine enrichment between Isg15 −/− and wild-type animals prior to infection shows no significantly regulated sites ( Supplementary Fig. 1g ). Taken together, these data suggest that sites identified by our method are likely bone fide ISG15 sites and by extension not misidentified ubiquitin or NEDD8 sites. Ultimately, we identified 930 ISG15 sites on 434 proteins (clusters 1 and 2, Supplementary Data 1), 87 of which had been previously identified ( Fig. 2b ; Supplementary Data 2). Taken together, our approach systematically identified endogenous ISG15 modification sites in vivo.
