Availability and location of HLIUs and isolation facilities in the Mediterranean countries According to the available data, health settings specifically dedicated to isolation of patients with suspected or proven HIDs are available in 48% (11 of 23) of the Mediterranean countries or territories. Countries equipped with such isolation settings are Cyprus, France, Israel, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Morocco, Slovenia and Spain. However, data from two countries (Libya and Morocco) are partial and need to be confirmed. Among these countries, at least five have an available HLIU (France, Greece, Israel, Italy and Spain). Among the 14 countries or territories in the European region (including Turkey), seven (50%) have some isolation settings (HLIU or another isolation facility). This rate is the same among Middle Eastern countries or territories (2/4, 50%) and is a little lower among North African countries (2/5, 40%, but in both cases data are partial). Details about isolation settings are reported in Table 2 , and geographic distribution of isolation settings are reported in Fig. 1 . In order to support the readers in understanding the structural features and technical/logistic capabilities of an HLIU, we describe in more details the units available and functioning in Rome and Marseille. At the National Institute for Infectious Diseases (INMI) 'L. Spallanzani' in Rome, an HLIU with one bed is placed inside a dedicated ward. Another special HLIU of one bed with intensive care capabilities is available. Both units are sealed and equipped with anteroom, negative pressure, HEPA filtration of both supply and exhausted air, dedicated pathway for patient admission and two separate staff entry and exit routes with dedicated areas for personal protective equipment (PPE) donning and doffing. Both units have special procedures for autoclaving, and the unit with intensive care capabilities is equipped with a dunk tank for decontamination. A task force of HCWs specifically trained for facing HIDs is available. The INMI has cabinet line of biosafety level (BSL) 4 and BSL-3 laboratories available in the same campus, with the capacity to conduct advanced laboratory tests, including all agents of viral haemorrhagic fevers, other HIDs and other relevant agents for differential diagnosis. Other INMI capabilities include a BSL-3-like autopsy suite, specific procedures for safely performing diagnostic medical imaging and specially equipped ambulances and stretchers for patient transport. During the recent Ebola outbreak, two confirmed cases were admitted in HLIUs. Both patients recovered with no secondary transmission to HCWs. The IHU university hospital in Marseilles is one of 12 French reference centres for bioterrorism and management of emerging infections and outbreaks. L'Institut Hospitalo Universitaire Méditerranée Infection laboratory is authorized to test suspected anthrax spores and all other bioterrorism agents. We also admit patients with multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, as well as suspected cases of SARS or MERS coronavirus and Ebola haemorrhagic fever, as well as any patient who is a victim of a yet undiscovered but highly contagious emerging infectious agent. The third floor of L'Institut Hospitalo Universitaire Méditerranée Infection building is dedicated to BSL-3 activities with 1450 m 2 for BSL-3 laboratories including a BSL-3 necropsy room and a 1300 m 2 BSL-3 healthcare ward, including a BSL-3 point-of-care laboratory [9] . The latter is dedicated to the care of contagious patients and has been built according to the most recent recommendations [3, 4, 10] . During routine care, except in times of sanitary crisis, 25 single bedrooms can be used individually with negative pressure (−50 Pa) or positive pressure (+20 Pa) to treat patients with diseases such as Beijing genotype or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis as well as immunocompromised patients with febrile neutropenia, but also to optimize the care for Clostridium difficile colitis or emerging multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. In times of sanitary crisis, the ward can be used as a modularly BSL-3 HLIU (8 + 7 + 10 beds) for patients with highly pathogenic microorganisms; facilities include secure anteroom access, a dedicated nurse room, autoclave and point-of-care laboratory. Each room is equipped as stated above and has video surveillance. The whole building is equipped with Wi-Fi, thus allowing communication for long-term isolated patients. Bedside radio imaging, chest X-ray and echography performed by a skilled medical doctor are available. Transportation to another technical unit is possible with the use of an isolator stretcher.

Recommendations about optimal and minimal logistic, infrastructural and technical features for isolation settings Main recommendations about optimal and minimal logistic, infrastructural and technical features for HLIU and other isolation facilities are summarized in Table 3 and referenced in Supplementary Material S1.
