The ratio of male to female cases among living cases resembled [2] , at 58%, with most 30-59 years of age (information missing for 9 cases). The deceased cases were more predominantly male (70%) and older (85% were 60 years of age or older). Table 1 shows estimates for the various time intervals without right truncation. For the incubation period estimates, the lognormal distribution provided the best fit to the data, both when excluding and including Wuhan residents. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5.0 days (95% credible interval [CI]: 4.2, 6.0) when excluding Wuhan residents (n = 52) and 5.6 days (95% CI: 5.0, 6.3) when including Wuhan residents (n = 158). The median time from illness onset to hospital admission was estimated at 3.3 days (95% CI: 2.7, 4.0) among living cases and 6.5 days (95% CI: 5.2, 8.0) among deceased cases using the gamma distribution, which provided the best fit for both sets of data. Figure 1A shows the corresponding PDFs. Data from the time from illness onset and hospital admission to death best fit lognormal and Weibull distributions, respectively, as presented in Figure 1B , C. The mean time from illness onset to death was 15.0 days (95% CI: 12.8, 17.5) and from hospital admission to death was 8.8 days (95% CI: 7.2, 10.8). Table 2 shows estimates for the fit of the lognormal distribution for each interval when accounting for right truncation. The mean incubation period was 5.6 days (95% CI: 4.4, 7.4) when excluding Wuhan residents-slightly larger than the estimate without right truncation. The mean estimate for illness onset to hospital admission was 9.7 days (95% CI: 5.4, 17.0) for living cases and 6.6 days (95% CI: 5.2, 8.8) for deceased cases, with the former nearly 2.5 times the length of its untruncated version. Illness onset to death and hospital admission to death were likewise longer than their non-truncated counterparts, at 20.2 days (95% CI: 15.1, 29.5) and 13.0 days (95% CI: 8.7, 20.9), respectively. Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution function of the incubation period with and without right truncation. The 5th and 95th percentiles are shown in addition to the median. The 95th percentiles were estimated at 10.6 days (95% CI: 8.5, 14.1) and 10.8 days (95% CI: 9.3, 12.9) for non-truncated data excluding and including Wuhan residents and 12.3 days (95% CI: 9.1, 19.8) when applying right truncation and excluding Wuhan residents. The respective median values for these CDFs were 4.3 days (95% CI: 3.5, 5.1), 5.0 days (95% CI: 4.4, 5.6), and 4.6 days (95% CI: 3.7, 5.7).
