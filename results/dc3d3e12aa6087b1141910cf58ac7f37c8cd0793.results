Selective ablation of CD11c hi PDCA-1 int/lo DCs, but not CD11c int PDCA-1 hi pDCs, exacerbates JE. CD11c-DTR transgenic mice, which express diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) gene under control of a cloned Itgax promoter and thus allow conditional DC depletion upon DT injection, has been a milestone in DC research 20, 21 . However, along with contrasting results in the strength of DC subset depletion [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , it was recently reported that CD11c-DTR mice showed side effect such as systemic neutrophilia after DT injection to deplete CD11c + DCs 22, 23 . Because the majority of published literatures used 8-11 ng/g DT to deplete CD11c + DCs 20-25 , the injection doses of DT were carefully titrated to achieve selective depletion of CD11c hi DCs. While the injection of low DT dose (2 ng/g) provided selective depletion of CD11c hi PDCA-1 int/lo DCs with slightly increased CD11c int PDCA-1 hi pDC frequency and number, the injection of higher DT dose (10 and 25 ng/g) depleted CD11c hi PDCA-1 int/lo DCs as well as CD11c int PDCA-1 hi pDCs ( Fig. S1A-B) . To better understand the depletion of CD11c hi DCs, we analyzed the frequency and total number of DC subsets (CD11c hi CD8α + , CD11c hi CD11b + , CD11c hi PDCA-1 int/ lo , and CD11c int PDCA-1 hi pDC) after DT injection (2 ng/g). Our data revealed that subpopulations of CD11c hi DCs, but not CD11c int PDCA-1 hi pDCs, were selectively depleted by DT (2 ng/g) injection ( Fig.  S1C-D) . Also, the major populations of other lymphoid and myeloid cells in spleen, blood, and bone marrow (BM), including B (CD3 − CD19 + ), NK (CD3 − NK1.1 + ) cells, and CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes, were not affected by DT (2 ng/g) injection ( Fig. S2A-C) . Furthermore, a repetitive systemic injection of such titrated DT (2 ng/g) did not cause systemic neutrophilia 22, 23 as well as any apparent changes in body weight, signs of illness, or long-term defects during monitoring periods that ranged from 7 to 10 days ( Fig. S3A-C) . Using this selective depletion model of CD11c hi DCs, we evaluated the impact of CD11c hi DCs on JE progression (Fig. 1A) . CD11c hi DC-depleted mice succumbed to JE with 100% mortality, whereas vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice showed around 50% mortality. Also, CD11c hi DC-depleted mice showed more rapid development of neurological disorder (paralysis) started from 3-4 dpi by up to 100% rate (Fig. 1B) , and severely reduced body weight (Fig. 1C) , as compared to vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice. Although any side effects such as neutrophilia, changes of body weight, and signs of illness were not shown by DT (2 ng/g) injection, we also used B6 recipients reconstituted by BM cells derived from CD11c-DTR mice to rule out residual side effect 24, 25 . Consistently, CD11c-DTR BM recipients showed 100% mortality, faster neurological signs, and marked reduction of body weight following depletion of CD11c hi PDCA-1 int/lo DCs by DT (2 ng/g) injection ( Fig. S4A-C) . Additionally, we determined viral RNA levels in lymphoid (spleen) and inflammatory CNS tissues (brain and spinal cord) (Fig. 1D ). CD11c hi DC ablation provided increased viral burden in lymphoid and CNS tissues. Of note, the inflammatory CNS tissues (brain and spinal cord) of CD11c hi DC-depleted mice contained viral burden with 100-to 1,000-fold increased levels 4 and 5 dpi, but not 2 and 3 dpi. These results indicate that selective ablation of CD11c hi DCs provides enhanced susceptibility to JE and facilitates the increase of viral burden in CNS tissues. To further characterize JE in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice, we examined infiltrated myeloid-derived cell populations (Ly-6C hi monocyte and Ly-6G hi granulocyte) in the CNS at 3 dpi, a time point before showing neurological disorder. The infiltrated populations of granulocytes (CD11b + Ly-6G hi ) were comparable between vehicle-and DT-treated CD11c-DTR mice in frequency and absolute number following JEV infection (Fig. 1E,F) . In contrast, CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes were prominently infiltrated in the CNS of DC-ablated mice with a 10-fold increase over vehicle-treated mice. Notably, the absolute number of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes increased 3-to 4-fold in DC-ablated mice. Furthermore, based on the CNS myeloid cell classification of Ford et al. 26 , we enumerated resting microglia (CD11b int CD45 int ) and activated microglia/macrophages (CD11b hi CD45 hi ) in the CNS at 3 dpi. The proportions (Fig. 1G ) and absolute numbers (Fig. 1H ) of resting microglia and activated microglia/macrophages were increased in CD11c hi DC-depleted mice. Of note, activated microglia/macrophages (CD11b hi CD45 hi ) were detected at a 10-fold increased level in CD11c hi PDCA-1 int/lo DC-depleted mice. Also, CD11b + CD45 − leukocytes containing many Ly-6C + Ly-6G − F4/80 int cells were detected in the brain of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice with increased levels, compared to vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice. To better understand a severe neuroinflammatory reaction in the immune-privileged CNS of CD11c hi PDCA-1 int/lo DC-depleted mice, we examined the cellular distribution of JEV antigen in the brain by histological examinations and confocal microscopy using antibodies against JEV NS1/E proteins and specific CNS cell types. Significantly, CD11c hi PDCA-1 int/lo DC-depleted mice had early recruitment of inflammatory cells into the brain, compared to vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice after JEV infection ( Fig. 2A-F) . The majority of infected cells were observed to be neuron cells, since prominent costaining was observed between neuronal marker MAP-2 and the JEV antigen (Fig. 2G) . Of note, a higher frequency of JEV antigen was detected in the brains of DC-ablated mice. In contrast, no costaining was detected between GFAP + astrocytes and JEV antigen, indicating that astrocytes were not infected with JEV (Fig. 2H ). Finally, a small subset of CD11b + myeloid cells costained positively with JEV antigen, and enhanced frequencies of JEV-infected CD11b + cells were observed in CD11c hi PDCA-1 int/lo DC-depleted mice (Fig. 2I ). Taken together, these results indicate that CD11c hi DCs are essential for the control of neuroinflammatory progression in immune-privileged CNS following JEV infection. Because neuroinflammation caused by neurotropic viruses is indirectly derived from CNS degeneration caused by robust immunological responses, such as the uncontrolled secretion of cytokines and chemokines and the resultant activation of microglia and astrocytes [27] [28] [29] , knowledge of the expression levels of cytokines and chemokines within the CNS can be required for further explanation of neuroinflammation. Therefore, we examined the expression of cytokines and chemokines in inflammatory tissues. We found that the ablation of CD11c hi PDCA-1 int/lo DCs provided greatly enhanced expression levels of cytokines and chemokines in the spleen and in the CNS, including brain and spinal cord (Fig. 2J ). Of note, increases in the expression levels of CC chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5) in the immune-privileged CNS of DC-ablated mice preceded the increases in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and CXC chemokines, suggesting that early expression of CC chemokines may induce infiltration of leukocytes into the CNS of DC-ablated mice. We also measured the levels of systemic IL-6 and TNF-α in the serum of JEV-infected mice at 3 dpi. Trends toward increased levels of IL-6 and TNF-α The proportion of JEV-infected CD11c-DTR mice showing paralysis was determined every 6 h from 4 to 8 dpi. (C) Changes in body weight. Data is expressed as the average percentage ± SD of body weight relative to the time of challenge. (D) Viral burden. Viral burden in the spleen, brain, and spinal cord of mice infected with JEV was assessed by real-time qRT-PCR at the indicated dpi. (E,F) Early infiltration of inflammatory CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes. After vigorous heart perfusion on the 3rd dpi, the frequency (E) and total number (F) of CD11b + Ly-6C hi and CD11b + Ly-6G hi cells infiltrated into the brain were analyzed by flow cytometric analysis. The values in representative dot-plots show the average percentage ± SD of Ly-6C hi and Ly-6G hi cells after gated on CD11b + cells. (G,H) Analysis of CNS microglia. The frequency (G) and total number (H) of CD11b int CD45 int (resting microglia) and CD11b hi CD45 hi (activated microglia and macrophages) were determined on the 3rd dpi. Data in dot-plots and bar graphs denote the average percentage/number ± SD of the indicated cell population derived from at least three individual experiments (n = 4-7). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 compared with the levels of the indicated group. were observed in the serum of CD11c hi PDCA-1 int/lo DC-depleted mice (Fig. 2K) . Collectively, these results indicate that CD11c hi DC ablation exacerbates neuroinflammation along with greater expression of CC chemokines to provide early CNS-infiltration of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes. Regulation of Ly-6C hi monocyte differentiation in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice. The debatable contribution of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes to immunopathology in the immune-privileged CNS has not been clearly defined [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . The present finding implies that early infiltration of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes could be associated with severe neuroinflammatory reactions in immune-privileged CNS of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice. Furthermore, since DC and monocytes share a common lineage during differentiation from HSCs 14, 15 , it is presumable that CD11c hi DC ablation affects the differentiation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes during JE. To address this issue, we explored the impact of CD11c hi DCs on the function and differentiation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes during JE progression. Splenic CD11b + Ly-6G hi neutrophils showed comparable levels in the presence or absence of CD11c hi DCs, on evaluation of the expression levels of several molecules related to antigen presentation (CD40, CD62L, CD80, CD86, MHC I, MHC II), Brain sections prepared at 4 dpi were co-stained for JEV antigen (red), the nuclear stain DAPI (blue), and the neuronal marker MAP-2 (green) (G), the astrocyte-specific marker GFAP (green) (H), or the microglial/macrophage cell-marker CD11b (green) (I). White arrows indicate double-positive cells. Data are representative of sections from at least four mice per treated group.

(K) Systemic IL-6 and TNF-α levels. The levels of serum IL-6 and TNF-α in sera were determined by conventional ELISA at 3 dpi. Data in bar graphs denote the average ± SD of cytokine levels derived from three individual experiments (n = 4-5). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 compared with the levels of the indicated group. chemokine receptors (CCR2, CXCR2), and other differentiation markers (Ly-6C, Gr-1, F4/80). However, the expression levels of CD40, CD62L, CD80, CD86, MHC I, MHC II, and F4/80 in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes were decreased by CD11c hi DC ablation (Fig. S5A) . Notably, down-regulation of CD40, CD80, CD86, MHC I, MHC II, and F4/80 in CD11b + Ly-6C high monocytes of DC-ablated mice was more apparent after JEV infection, compared to those of JEV-infected CD11c-DTR mice that were not injected with DT. In line with this result, the expression levels of CD40, CD62L, CD80, CD86, MHC I, MHC II, and F4/80 in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes infiltrated into immune-privileged CNS were markedly decreased in DC-ablated mice (Fig. 3A) . On the other hand, the expression levels of chemokine receptors CXCR2 in Ly-6C hi monocytes and Ly-6G hi granulocytes were not significantly changed by CD11c hi DC-depletion, whereas increased expression of CCR2 molecule was observed in CNS-infiltrated CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes of CD11c hi DC-depleted mice (MFI 440 ± 51 vs 387 ± 77) (Fig. 3B ). The down-regulation of activation and differentiation markers in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice was also confirmed using recipient mice reconstituted by BM cells derived from CD11c-DTR mice, in order to assure the residual effect of DT (Fig. S6) . Additionally, it was revealed that the expression levels of differentiation markers in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes and CD11b + Ly-6G hi neutrophils of BM cells The levels of viral burden and mRNAs for cytokines and chemokines were determined by real-time qRT-PCR using total RNA extracted from sorted CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes at 3 dpi. Data denote the average levels ± SD of viral burden and cytokine mRNAs derived from at least three individual experiments (n = 3-4). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 compared with the levels of cells sorted from the CD11c-DTR mice group (vehicle) that received only JEV infection without DT injection (n = 5-7). were not affected by the depletion of CD11c hi DCs (Fig. S5B ), which indicates that the differentiation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in the spleen and brain, but not BM, is affected by CD11c hi DC ablation. Because some CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes could be differentiated into CD11c-expressing monocyte-derived DCs during inflammation [15] [16] [17] , thereby affecting the expression of costimulatory and MHC class II molecules in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes, we examined the frequency and number of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes expressing CD11c molecule in the fraction of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes. As expected, a small fraction of splenic CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocyte expressing CD11c molecule was moderately reduced by DT injection (Fig. S7A) . However, the frequency and number of CD11c-expressing CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes infiltrated into the CNS were not significantly altered by DT injection, due to higher CNS-infiltration of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice (Fig. S7B) . Therefore, it was thought that CD11c-expressing monocytes might affect the expression of MHC II and costimulatory molecules in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes, due to highly dominant population of CD11c-negative Ly-6C hi monocytes. It is believed that CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes develop in BM and arise from cMoP derived from MDP 13, 14 . Therefore, to further examine the impact of CD11c hi DCs on the differentiation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes, we examined the frequency and number of monocyte progenitors, MDP and cMoP, in BM of CD11c-DTR mice during JE (Fig. S7C ). CD11c hi DC ablation provided slightly increased frequency, but not number, of MDP in BM before infection, while cMoP was accumulated in BM only during JE. Of note, CD11c hi DC-ablated mice contained moderately decreased number of cMoP in BM compared to vehicle-treated mice, which implies that the differentiation process of MDP into cMoP could be affected by CD11c hi DC ablation. To further characterize the regulation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocyte differentiation by CD11c hi DCs, we next examined their morphologies (Fig. 3C ). Based on morphological examinations of monocytes described by Goasguen et al. 30 , the morphology of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in DC-ablated mice come near to immature monocytes, compared to CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice. CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in DC-ablated mice showed a monotonous shape for the cell membrane and a round/oval nuclear shape, whereas CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice showed irregular shape of cell membrane and lobulated/ indented nuclear shape which is the typical morphology of a mature monocyte and/or macrophage-like morphology. This immature morphology for the CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in DC-ablated mice was also supported by FSC and SSC results of flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 3C) . Collectively, these results suggest that CD11c hi DCs play a certain role in regulating the differentiation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes during JE, thereby affecting the outcome of JE progression. CD11c hi DCs maintain phenotypic homeostasis of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes. We next examined viral burden and cytokine expression of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes accumulated in the CNS of vehicle or DT-treated CD11c-DTR mice during JE progression (Fig. 3D ). There was no significant difference in viral burdens of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes derived from CD11c-DTR mice that CD11c hi DCs were depleted or not. However, infiltrated CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in the CNS of DC-ablated mice showed higher expression of some inflammatory cytokines than those of CD11c-DTR mice in which CD11c hi DCs were not depleted. Notably, the expression levels of TNF-α and CCL2, which showed prominent increases in the CNS during JE progression, were significantly increased in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes infiltrated into the immune-privileged CNS of DC-ablated mice, compared to those of vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice (Fig. 3D) . Also, in general, CD11c hi DC number was gradually restored within 3-4 days after stopping injection of DT (Fig. 4A) . Thus, we were interested in whether the restoration of CD11c hi DCs after stopping DT injection could induce the phenotypic recovery of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes (Fig. 4B ). After stopping DT injection, the expression levels of differentiation markers in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes were gradually recovered until reaching the levels found in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice, depending on restoration of CD11c hi DCs. Of note, the phenotypic recovery of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes was faster if CD11c-DTR mice were infected with JEV. Furthermore, to confirm the phenotypic recovery of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes by CD11c hi DC restoration, we tested if down-regulated phenotype of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice could be recovered by injection of sorted CD11c hi PDCA-1 int/lo DCs during JE (Fig. 4C,D) . As expected, our results revealed that the injection of sorted CD11c hi DCs provided the recovered phenotypes of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in the spleen and CNS of DT-treated CD11c-DTR mice. Ultimately, these results suggest that CD11c hi DCs play a role in maintaining phenotypic homeostasis of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes, and thereby affect neuroinflammation after their infiltration in the immune-privileged CNS. Flt3-L and GM-CSF are involved in Ly-6C hi monocyte differentiation in DC-ablated mice. A previous study showed that mice with conditional DC depletion develop myeloproliferative disorder (MDP), as indicated by a massive increase in CD11b + cell number with elevated serum levels of Flt3-L 31 . In the current study, we also found elevated Flt3-L levels in sera and spleen of CD11c hi DC-depleted mice, while changes in GM-CSF, CCL2, and CXCL1 were not observed (Fig. 5A,B) . However, such levels of Flt3-L in serum and spleen were dramatically enhanced in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice following JEV infection, rather than in CD11c hi DC-depleted mice. Interestingly, however, the GM-CSF level in serum, but not the spleen, was significantly enhanced in CD11c hi DC-depleted mice following JEV infection. Because inadequate differentiation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in DC-ablated mice was CD11c-DTR mice were injected i.p. with DT (2 ng/g) 2 times at one-day interval, and the activation levels of splenic CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes were analyzed 1 (d3), 3 (d5), and 4 (d6) days after last DT injection. Some mice were infected with JEV (1.5 × 10 7 pfu/mouse) 4 days after last DT injection and the activation levels of monocytes were analyzed 3 days later (d9). CD11c-DTR mice injected with DT every other day from -1 to 7 days after JEV infection were given the injection of CD11c hi PDCA-1 int/lo DCs (1.0 × 10 6 cells/mouse) sorted from the spleen of BL/6 mice at the 2 dpi, and the phenotypic levels of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in the spleen (C) and brain (D) of CD11c-DTR recipients were determined by flow cytometric analysis 2 days later.

Scientific RepoRts | 5:17548 | DOI: 10.1038/srep17548 vehicle or DT. Our results revealed that moderately elevated proliferation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes was achieved by incubating the splenocytes of DC-ablated mice with sera of vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice (Fig. 5C) , while decreased expression of surface markers CD40, CD62L, and MHC class II in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes was observed in sera obtained from CD11c hi DC-depleted mice (Fig. 5D ). In addition, in order to examine whether Flt3-L and GM-CSF were involved in such down-regulation of CD40, CD62L, and MHC class II, the splenocytes of CD11c hi DC-depleted mice were incubated with sera in the presence of neutralizing Abs against Flt3-L and GM-CSF. The neutralization of Flt3-L and/or GM-CSF induced significantly recovered expression levels of CD40, CD62L, and MHC class II in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes incubated with sera derived from CD11c hi DC-depleted mice (Fig. 5E ). This finding indicates that Flt3-L and GM-CSF could modulate the down-regulation of differentiation markers in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes derived from CD11c hi DC-depleted mice. Also, we examined the expression levels of cytokines and chemokines in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes incubated with sera derived from JEV-infected CD11c-DTR mice that received vehicle or DT. CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes incubated with sera of CD11c hi DC-depleted mice showed higher expression levels of IL-1β , CCL2, and CXCL2, compared to monocytes incubated with sera of vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 5F ). Such increased expression levels of cytokines and chemokines in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes incubated with sera of DC-ablated mice were significantly reduced by blocking GM-CSF, whereas lower expression levels of cytokines and chemokines in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes incubated with sera of vehicle-treated mice were reversed or moderately enhanced with treatment of anti-Flt3-L neutralizing antibody. Of note, CCL2 expression in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes incubated with sera of vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice was significantly enhanced by blocking Flt3-L and/or GM-CSF. Collectively, these results imply that down-regulation of differentiation markers and enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine in CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes derived from DC-ablated mice could be mediated by Flt3-L and GM-CSF with their differential trends following JEV infection. Ly-6C hi monocytes differentiated in CD11c hi DC-ablated environment augment neuroinflammation in immune-privileged CNS. It is still unclear whether infiltration of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in immune-privileged CNS plays a deleterious or beneficial role in neuroinflammation caused by neurotropic viruses such as WNV [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Although our results propose early pronounced CNS infiltration of inadequately differentiated CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in the absence of CD11c hi DCs, resulting in the induction of severe neuroinflammation and a deleterious role in encephalitis, we did not provide direct evidence as to whether infiltration of inadequately differentiated CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes into the immune-privileged CNS played a deleterious or beneficial role in JE progression. To address this issue, we used recipient mice reconstituted by BM cells derived from CCR2 KO mice that are monocytopenic, in which tissue recruitment of monocytes is impaired in infectious disease models 9 . CCR2 KO BM recipients were infected with JEV after adoptive transfer of sorted CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes from DT-or vehicle-injected CD11c-DTR mice. Interestingly, CCR2 KO BM recipients that received CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes derived from DC-ablated mice were more susceptible to JE, as compared to CCR2 KO BM recipients given CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes sorted from vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice (p = 0.033) (Fig. 6A) . There was also a moderate increase in susceptibility to JE in CCR2 KO BM recipients given CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes from vehicle-treated mice, compared to JEV-infected CCR2 KO BM recipients given no monocytes. Furthermore, CCR2 KO BM recipients that received CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes sorted from CD11c hi DC-depleted mice showed faster development of neurological disorders after JEV infection than did recipients of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes from vehicle-treated mice. We also used recipient mice reconstituted by BM cells derived from CD11c-DTR·CCR2 KO mice to exclude the recovery potential of inadequately differentiated CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes by endogenous CD11c hi DCs (Fig. S9) . The recipients of BM cells derived from CD11c-DTR·CCR2 KO mice were infected with JEV following the adoptive transfer of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes sorted from CD11c-DTR mice that received DT or vehicle. CD11c-DTR·CCR2 KO BM recipients were injected with DT to inhibit the recovery potential of adoptively transferred CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes by endogenous CD11c hi DCs. Similar to the experiment using CCR2 KO BM recipients, CD11c-DTR·CCR2 KO BM recipients that received CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes sorted from CD11c hi DC-ablated mice showed higher susceptibility to JE than did the recipients of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes sorted from vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice, as evaluated by mortality (p = 0.0349) (Fig. S9A) , rapid development of neurological disorder (Fig. S9B) , and body weight change during JE progression (Fig. S9C) . Therefore, these results provide direct evident that inadequately differentiated CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes generated in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice are more deleterious to neuroinflammation than those of vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice, thereby providing exacerbated JE. To better understand the augmented JE of CCR2 KO BM recipients given CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes from DC-ablated mice, we measured viral burden in the spleen and brain of JEV-infected CCR2 KO BM recipients (Fig. 6B) . CCR2 KO BM recipients that received just JEV infection without the supply of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes showed the highest viral burden in the spleen as the primary target tissue of virus administered via i.p. route, compared to CCR2 KO BM recipients that received adoptive transfer of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes derived from CD11c-DTR mice given DT or vehicle. However, interestingly, CCR2 KO BM recipients given sorted CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes from CD11c hi DC-depleted mice had significantly increased levels of viral burden in the immune-privileged CNS tissues, compared to CCR2 Scientific RepoRts | 5:17548 | DOI: 10.1038/srep17548 KO BM recipients that received CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes sorted from vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice or just JEV-infected CCR2 KO BM recipients. Also, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and chemokines (CCL2 and CXCL2) were closely associated with the levels of viral burden in the spleen and the CNS (Fig. 6C) . Collectively, these results indicate that CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes derived from DC-ablated mice exacerbate neuroinflammation in immune-privileged Ly-6C hi monocytes generated in CD11c hi DC-ablated environment are accumulated faster in inflamed CNS, depending on CCR2. Next, to further define the exacerbation of neuroinflammation by CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes derived from DC-ablated mice, we examined the infiltration of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in the CNS of CCR2 KO BM recipients. As expected, infiltrated CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in the CNS were observed with higher frequency and absolute number in the immune-privileged CNS of CCR2 KO BM recipients that received CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes sorted from DC-ablated mice, compared to other recipients (Fig. 6D) . Therefore, this more rapid CNS accumulation in CCR2 KO BM recipients of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes sorted from DC-depleted mice was closely associated with enhanced viral burden and cytokine expression. To trace trafficking of adoptively transferred CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in the CNS, we analyzed monocyte trafficking from blood to CNS, spleen, and BM directly using a competitive study where equal numbers of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes derived from DT-or vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice were differentially labeled (Veh CMFDA vs DT CMTMR ), mixed 1:1, and injected into JEV-infected CCR2 KO recipient mice. Generally, a skewed distribution favoring CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes (DT CMTMR ) derived from CD11c hi DC-depleted mice was observed in lymphoid (spleen and BM) and inflammatory tissue (brain) (Fig. 6E) . Notably, donor DT CMTMR cells displayed a more dramatically skewed distribution in blood and inflamed CNS, compared to lymphoid tissues such as spleen and BM. In agreement with this finding, the ratios of absolute numbers of DT CMTMR to Veh CMFDA were greater in blood and CNS (~4:1) than those of spleen and BM (~2:1) (Fig. 6F) . Taken together, these results indicate that CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes differentiated in the absence of CD11c hi DCs migrate to the immune-privileged CNS with a skewed distribution to induce severe neuroinflammatory reaction in a CCR2-dependent manner.
