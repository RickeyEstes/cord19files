Epidemiological findings. Since 2005, epidemics of dengue in Guangdong have been characterized by periodic outbreaks, the coexistence of importation and localization, and the significantly increased number of indigenous cases compared with that of imported cases ( Figure 1A and C). The incidence peaked in 2006 and 2014. Especially, during the large outbreak in 2014, a total of 45,236 cases of dengue were reported. In 2017, 1,650 cases were reported, with a continuous rising trend in comparison to 544 cases in 2016 ( Figure 1A ). More seriously, as of November 4, 2018, a total of 2,835 cases were reported, an increase of 107.1% over the same period in 2017. Among them, 257 cases were imported, which was 50.3% higher than those in the same period in 2017; 2,578 cases were local cases, which was 115.2% higher than those in the same period in 2017. Based on the map of Guangdong Province, we diagrammed the distribution of the cumulative number of cases since 2005. This showed that Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, and Chaozhou were the main epidemic areas. The trends of the epidemics were anastomotic, with periods of fluctuation in Guangdong Province ( Figure 2 ). After 2010, the epidemic trend featured the gradual coexistence of various serotypes, with up to four serotypes emerging in recent years. Each DENV serotype was identified. Dengue virus 1 was the major cause of the outbreak of 2014, and it continued to be detected in Guangdong Province as the primary serotype, except in 2015. It is worth noting that the proportion of dengue 2 virus in the total cases also gradually increased ( Figure 1D ). Data of 56 samples were used to analyze the overall epidemiology. All patients who provided the samples had mild dengue and had no travel history (Table 2) . Generally, the collection date distribution was concentrated in September and October ( Figure 1B ). The endemic areas were primarily located in Guangzhou, followed by Zhongshan and Chaozhou, accounting for 85.72% of all samples. Heyuan, Huizhou, and Shanwei were included in the collection areas ( Figure 1E ). Dengue virus 1 was the major causative agent of this outbreak. The serotype detected through type-specific primers (Table 1 ) was DENV1, which is similar to the results from Guangdong CDC that of 323 DF cases involved, 303 cases were due to DENV1 infection ( Figure 1D , Table 2 ). Phylogenetic analysis of DENV1 outbreak in 2014. All 56 E genes were sequenced to construct phylogenetic trees. The dengue outbreak in 2014 involved Asian genotype I and American/African genotype V. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the sequences were clustered into a unified clade whose distribution differed in each city. Among them, 47 E gene sequences were identified as genotype V with 98.9-100% similarity. They clustered into the same clade, which was closely related to the DENV1 sequences in Malaysia, Singapore, and India and evolved into a lineage of genotype V. During 2013-2014, this lineage was involved in a co-epidemic in Guangdong Province, Malaysia, and Pakistan, with a continuous high-level local prevalence especially in Singapore. Significantly, this lineage was detected in six cities in our collection; 13 sequences from Shanwei, Chaozhou, and Huizhou all belonged to genotype V. In addition, another nine sequences of the E gene were identified as genotype I, with two different lineages. Lineage I involved eight sequences in our collection and other sequences in Singapore and Thailand in recent years, with a 99.6-100% similarity. Only one sequence in Guangzhou contributed to Lineage II, which had been involved in local epidemics in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia for many years ( Figure 3 ). Phylogenetic analysis of Guangdong since 2005. We downloaded E gene sequences since 2005, comprising 187 from Guangdong and 1886 from other countries. Databases of E gene molecular evolution were created via a screening process based on epidemiologic and phylogenetic methods. Among them, 81 strains in Guangdong constituted the local database, whereas 403 strains in other countries made up the imported database. Based on the evolutionary lineage of DENV1 detected in 2014 in Guangdong, seven sequences (P1023, P1078, P1258, P1277, P1278, P1306, and P1344) were added to the local We endeavored to clarify the relationship between Guangdong and other countries concerning DENV outbreaks. For this, we illustrated the origin of molecular evolution lineages and the potential of in situ evolution. Representative strains from each lineage were added to the imported database for phylogenetic evolution analysis. In our collection, the molecular evolutionary lineage of the imported database proved to be highly consistent with the local database. The only distinctions were that the evolution time of Lineages I and II changed in genotype I, and DENV1 in Guangzhou, 2011, formed a clade alone, named clade A ( Figure 5A ). Genotype I, which has extensively circulated in Guangdong and has been detected in each year of the epidemics, displayed some differences with epidemic countries surrounding China. After 2010, Lineage I was not found in Guangdong. Lineage I was very homologous with lineages in Singapore, Thailand, and Sri Lanka in the same epidemic years. However, Lineage I spread in neighboring countries, such as Malaysia, Myanmar, and New Guinea, which contributed to cyclic epidemics ( Figure 5B ). Lineage II in Guangdong presented a more complicated epidemic situation in countries around China: for example, Lineage II extensively circulated in Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and Cambodia, with Vietnam and Cambodia being hot spots. Clade A only formed a cluster with DENV1 in Vietnam ( Figure 5B ). Recently, Lineage III in Guangdong showed a complicated epidemic situation in surrounding countries as well. Its sequence was related to sequences in Thailand, Laos, Singapore, Malaysia, and elsewhere. In addition, it was related to the co-epidemic in Australia that occurred in 2013 and 2014 ( Figure 5B ). There were few countries with Lineage IV whose epidemic originated from the sequences in 2007. Only Malaysia, Singapore, and especially Indonesia shared clustering in DENV1 with long-term cyclic epidemics ( Figure 5B ). In addition, the occurrence of genotypes IV and V was inconsistent in different years. Genotype IV sequences in 2007 shared extensive homology with those in Indonesia, whereasthe strains in 2010 were related to those in the Philippines with long-term cyclic epidemics ( Figure 5C ). Genotype V was related to the strains in India and Maldives and was divided into clade 2009 and 2014 and clade 2010 and 2011; the sequences shared long-term coepidemics with India and Singapore, respectively ( Figure 5D ). Protein conformational changes caused by mutation of E protein-specific AAs between DENV1 genotypes I and V. A total of eight uniform AA substitutions in the ectodomain of the E protein were mainly concentrated in domains I (five substitutions) (DI) and III (two substitutions) (DIII) between genotypes I and V, whereas domain II (DII) has only one. Among them, two substitutions caused the protein's secondary structure to change from β-sheet to coil, E114 (I → L) in DII and E171 (T → S) in DI, whereas only E37 (D → N), E155 (S → T), E161 (T → I), and E171 (T → S) of DI were observed on the 3D conformation surface of the protein ( Figure 6A and B, Table 3 ). Meanwhile, E161 (T → I) and E171 (T → S) of DI were also found in the binding interface between the E protein of genotypes I and GRP78, and other substitutions were not observed in either serotypes ( Figure 6E ). In the docking model with the GRP78 protein, all three domains of genotype I were involved, whereas genotype V had only DI and DIII. We found three identical docking sites of DIII in the binding interface of the two genotypes: 331A-332P, 359T-360D, and 362E-363K ( Figure 6C and D) .
