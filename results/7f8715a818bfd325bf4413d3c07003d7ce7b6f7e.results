Mutation and mixed allele frequency comparison between clinical samples and their matched cultured specimens. To compare HPIV-3 sequenced directly from patients with HPIV-3 sequenced after brief growth in culture, nine HPIV-3-positive (HPIV-3ϩ) nasal swabs were sequenced metagenomically, and their paired viral isolates were sequenced after initial isolation in rhesus monkey kidney (RhMK) cells. We investigated the variant alleles with a minor allele frequency of Ͼ5% that arose in culture. The nine swabs included one clinical sample that was independently cultured twice, such that ten viral isolates were sequenced. Clinical respiratory samples that tested positive for HPIV-3 by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) with cycle thresholds under 25 were either sequenced directly by metagenomic nextgeneration sequencing (mNGS) without exposure to culture or grown on RhMK cells and viral isolates were harvested and sequenced. The choice of RhMK cells for this study was based on the fact that these are the standard cells used for viral isolation by many or most diagnostic microbiology laboratories and would allow us to answer the question of whether this standard process leads to alteration in the viruses. Seven of the nine cultured isolates were harvested before day 5 of culture, and no viruses were passaged beyond initial isolation. Sequencing reads for the cultured viruses were analyzed for mutational changes relative to the HPIV-3 consensus genome obtained from metagenomic sequencing of the original clinical sample (without expo-sure to any cell culture), and both assemblies were analyzed for variants with Ͼ5% minor allele frequency (MAF) (25) . A total of 28 nonsynonymous mutational changes with MAF change of Ͼ5% in response to exposure to cell culture were found across the nine sets of HPIV-3 viral isolates, with 18 of the 28 in the HN protein (P Ͻ 0.001 by Fisher's exact test) (Fig. 1) . Of the ten mutations found outside the HN protein, four were found in the P protein, four in the L protein, and two in the F protein. Of the two L variants that increased in allele frequency in cultured specimens, one (G1759D) was not found in a separate viral isolation performed on the same clinical sample, while the other (P104L) was found at a high allele frequency in the original clinical sample (Fig. 1D to G). Evolution of the polymerase complex will be explored separately, as the focus of this current paper is on the entry complex. During viral isolation from sample SC1784, we noted the appearance of the previously described HN H552Q mutation at 35% MAF after only 4 days in culture (Fig. 1G) . HN H552Q has previously been isolated in laboratory-adapted HPIV-3 strains and is possible CPE  Day 5 -CPE, HAD+   SC0129   L  N  H  F  M  P  N   R699C   16%   R699   1  1,000  2,000  3,000  4,000  5,000  6,000  7,000  8,000  9,000  10,000  11,000  12,000  13,000  14,
