The genomic regions of flotillin-1 and -2 upstream of the ATG start codon contain an active promoter Four human flotillin promoter fragments with a maximum length of 2600 bp (flotillin-1) and 2130 bp (flotillin-2) were generated by PCR and cloned into the reporter gene plasmid pGL3-basic. All constructs displayed a relative luciferase activity that was significantly higher than the activity of the empty control plasmid pGL3-basic (Fig. 1) . In the case of flotillin-1, the basal promoter activity was highest for the second-longest construct F1-1330 and very low for the shortest construct F1-375, indicating that the region upstream of 375 bp from the ATG start codon contains elements essential for the basal flotillin-1 promoter activity. Flotillin-2 promoter activity was found to be highest with the longest construct and was reduced to about 50% in the shortest construct reaching 560 bp upstream of ATG. The promoter regions of flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 are conserved among species and contain a similar set of putative transcription factor binding sites After the identification of a functional promoter region in the human flotillin-1 and -2 genes, genomic sequences of flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 of five different species (human, mouse, rat, chimpanzee, and cow) were compared to identify conserved regions and putative transcription factor binding sites, which would imply that common transcriptional regulatory mechanisms exist. Of each genomic sequence, 1000 bp upstream of the ATG start codon were used for the computer-based analyses. The analysis was done with genomic sequences of five species to reduce the amount of false-positive matches. Sequences of mouse, rat, chimpanzee and cow were to .51% (flotillin-1) and .57% (flotillin-2) identical to the human sequence (Table 2) . Analysis for putative transcription factor binding sites revealed a set of 19 transcription factor families whose binding sites are present in both flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 of all five species analyzed (Table 3) . For many of them (e.g. EGRF family), the putative responsive element was found multiple times per sequence, making a functional role of these transcription factors likely. In further parts of this study, we focused on the transcription factor families EGRF, ETSF, and RXRF, the functionality of which was analyzed in more detail. Flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 promoters are activated by EGF in a MAPK/ERK1/2 dependent manner and by PMA, FGF and FCS We recently identified flotillin-1 as a key regulator of EGF receptor and the downstream mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1/2 signaling. In this cascade, flotillin-1 forms a molecular complex with EGFR, but also with CRAF, MEK1, ERK1/2 and KSR1, thus putatively working as a novel MAPK scaffolder [13] . Because of the essential role of flotillin-1 in EGF receptor signaling, we analyzed if the expression of flotillins themselves is regulated by growth factors such as EGF. For this, the luciferase reporter assay with flotillin promoter constructs was performed in EGF stimulated cells. In the case of flotillin-1, constructs F1-2600 and F1-1330 were significantly activated by EGF as compared to the unstimulated cells, whereas the shorter ones showed no significant activation ( Fig. 2A, left) . Similarly, the 3 longest promoter constructs of flotillin-2 were significantly activated by EGF ( Fig. 2A, right) . Interestingly, the three longest flotillin-1 and all four flotillin-2 constructs displayed a basal activity even in unstimulated cells, as compared to the cells transfected with the control vector. To check if the EGF induced increase in the flotillin promoter activity was due to activation of the MAPKs ERK1/2, we used an inhibitor specific for the MAPK kinases MEK1/2, which reside immediately upstream of ERK1/2 in the pathway and are essential for ERK1/2 activation. Incubation of the cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 not only completely abolished the stimulatory effect of EGF, but also significantly suppressed the basal promoter activity. This indicates that already the basal expression of flotillins is in part dependent on the MAPKs ERK1/2. This effect was particularly strong for flotillin-1, which itself modulates MAPK signaling. Based on the above data, flotillins thus can be added to the list of ERK1/2 regulated genes. To check if the flotillin promoters also respond to other growth factors and stimuli, the above experiments were repeated with PMA, FCS or basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) as stimulating agents which all result in downstream ERK1/2 activation. PMA is known to activate protein kinase C (PKC), a Ser/Thr kinase family with a role in cell growth, proliferation and tumorigenesis [35] . Activation of PKC leads to activation of cRaf and, hence, to a downstream activation of ERK1/2. Stimulation with PMA resulted in a strong activation of the three longest flotillin-1 promoter constructs and of all four flotillin-2 promoter constructs (Fig. 2B) , very similarly to EGF. Since the second longest flotillin-1 and longest flotillin-2 promoter construct gave the strongest activation in the above experiments, we used these two constructs in most of the further studies. Stimulation of the cells with either bFGF which activates ERK1/2 and PI3K through the FGF receptor activation (Fig. 2C ) or with FCS (Fig. 2D) , which contains a mixture of growth factors, also resulted in an increased promoter activity which was more pronounced for flotillin-1 than for flotillin-2. In fact, a significant activation by FGF was only observed with flotillin-1 whereas flotillin-2 activation remained just below the significance level (p = 0.09). However, FCS-induced activation was significant for both flotillins. In summary, the promoters of both flotillins are activated by several stimuli that all derive from an upstream activation of ERK1/2.
