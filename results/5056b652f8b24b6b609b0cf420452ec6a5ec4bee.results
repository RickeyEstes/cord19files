The average monthly incidences of the three infectious diagnoses varied with sex, age, and region (Table 1) . Monthly incidences also varied with season. Incidences of acute respiratory infection and acute intestinal infection were higher during the autumn-winter seasons (October to March), and incidences of herpangina and HFMD were higher during spring-summer seasons (April to September). We plotted the monthly incidences of these diagnoses over time (Figure 1 , left column). After adjustment for age, sex, and region, we found evidence of seasonality, especially in monthly incidence for acute respiratory infection (year-on-year ICC 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52-0.90), and to a lesser degree for acute intestinal infection (year-on-year ICC 0.53, 95% CI 0.28-0.78) and for herpangina and HFMD (year-on-year ICC 0.42, 95% CI 0.16-0.68). An indentation was seen in almost all diagnoses in 2003, reflecting the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, during which major quarantine was operated. 4 Excluding this period had little effect on the intra-class correlations (data not shown). A lower baseline incidence was observed in northern Taiwan compared to central and southern Taiwan for all three types of infection (Figure 1, right column) . Despite the difference in baseline incidences, we observed remarkable seasonal synchrony among the three regions, with between-region ICCs highest for acute respiratory infection (0.91, 95% CI 0.87-0.94), followed by herpangina and HFMD (0.85, 95% CI 0.80-0.90) and acute intestinal infection (0.69, 95% CI 0.59-0.79). As sensitivity analyses, we also calculated the ICCs by restricting the incidence data to either autumn-winter seasons or spring-summer seasons, and by excluding the incidence data in 2003, and the results were not substantially changed (data not shown).
