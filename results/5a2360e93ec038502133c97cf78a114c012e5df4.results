A first analysis was performed by comparing the methylation status of corresponding pools-patients vs. controls: 1. Bulgarian female patients (BG-F-pat)/Bulgarian female healthy controls (BG-F-con); 2. Bulgarian male patients (BG-M-pat)/Bulgarian male healthy controls (BG-M-con); 3. Serbian female patients (SER-F-pat)/ Serbian female healthy controls (SER-F-con); 4. Serbian male patients (SER-M-pat)/Serbian male healthy controls (SER-M-con). The aim of this analysis was to define the differentially methylated region between patients and healthy controls. These are presumed to be loci that affect cell function and lead to BEN development. A second analysis was performed to reveal the common differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between several patient-control pairs grouped by: 1. endemic region and 2. gender: DMRs in BG-F/SER-F; DMRs in BG-M/SER-M; DMRs in BG-F/BG-M and DMRs in SER-M/SER-F. We aimed to discover which has a greater significance to BEN -endemic region or gender. The third level of analysis was performed by comparing DMRs in all subsets of patient-control pairs in order to reveal the common changes in the methylation profile in all patient-control pairs, so that we can define the most prominent methylation deregulated loci in BEN.
