In the present study, a total of 60 samples of 12 tissue types from 5 adult buffaloes were included to identify panel of RGs for normalization of qPCR data across buffalo tissues. Good quality RNA as reflected by A 260 /A 280 ratio was extracted from each tissue sample (2.09Â± 0.031). Presence of single melting peak ensured specific amplification of each RG. The co-efficient of determination (R 2 ) and efficiency also accounted for qPCR performance (S1 Table and S1-S5 Figs). The qPCR performance in terms of slope of five points standard curves was in the range of -3.138 to -3.646 and showed sufficiently good amplification efficiencies ranging from 88.063% for UXT to 109.26% for RPL4. The average quantification cycle (Cq) values for 10 RGs were quite variable and ranged from 19.3 for RPS23 to 25.6 for HMBS (Fig 1) .
