The daily number of PE Link calls that lead to hospital admission ranges from 1-100, with mean 31.4, median 26, and SD (standard deviation) 18.3. The daily call rate per 10,000 subscribers ranges from 0.99-25.16, with mean 11.53, median 11.52, and SD 3.59. The daily minimum temperature ranges from 6-29°C, with mean 21.8°C, In Fig. 2 , we graph the average call rate for each distinct temperature value as a function of temperature at different lags ranging from 0-34. The graphs shows somewhat similar relationships between call rate and temperature at different lags up to 34 days. This is not surprising as the time series of temperature shows strong autocorrelation that persists across different lags. In fact, the auto-correlation at lags 1-34 range from 0.952 to 0.643. Similar auto-correlation among the humidity and temperature range variables was also observed; see Figs. 3 and 4 for the graphs of the average call rate against humidity and temperature range respectively at different lags. In light of this issue of multicollinearity, we use the respective 7-day averages of the variable values on the same day and the previous 6 days as the corresponding meteorological variables in the subsequent regression analysis. We also tried to use averages of the variables up to 3 weeks, and the results were similar to those using the one-week averages to be reported below. The degrees of the polynomial effect functions for temperature, humidity, temperature range, and the secular time trend are searched for in the range {1, . . . , 20} × {1, . . . , 10} × {1, . . . , 5} × {1, . . . , 20} by minimizing the AIC value. The degrees selected were 5 for temperature, 1 for humidity, 1 for temperature range, and 19 for time trend. Upon inspection of the model fit with these as the degrees of the respective polynomial effect functions, the term associated with humidity was found insignificant, and therefore was dropped from the model for further reduced AIC value and simplified model. In the simplified model the indicator variable for the SARS pandemic was also insignificant and therefore dropped. The significant terms remaining in the thus simplified best fitting Poisson GLM are the 5th degree polynomial of temperature, the 1st degree polynomial (linear) function of temperature range, the terms for weekday effects, the terms for month effects, and the 19th degree polynomial for the secular time trend. Inspection of the time series of the Pearson residuals from fitting the simplified model revealed significant auto-correlation at lags 1, 5, 13, 19, 23, and 33. Refitting a Poisson GLARMA model with these as the auto-regressive lags to the data left no significant autocorrelation among the residual time series. The residual deviance after fitting the Poisson GLARMA model was 2741.1 on 2109 degrees of freedom, indicating moderate overdispersion of data relative to the Poisson model. Therefore, a negative binomial GLARMA model was refitted to the data. The diagnostic plots for this model are shown in Fig. 5 . It reveals fitted values for the response closely tracing the observed counts, white-noise looking residual time series that have no trend or serial correlation, and uniformly distributed PIT (Probability Integral Transform) residuals [11, 12] . These observations suggest that the final negative binomial GLARMA model produces adequate fit to the data. In the final negative binomial GLARMA model, the terms associated with temperature, temperature range, day of the week, and secular time trend remain significant, while the month of year effect was only marginally significant; see Table 1 . The estimated effect of temperature range on the logarithm of the call rate turns out to be linear, with a 1°C increase in temperature range associated with an increase in the call rate by 2.24 % (95 % CI: [ 0.66 %, 3.85 %]); see also Fig. 6 . The estimated weekday effects suggest that Monday on average sees 9.34 % (95 % CI: [5.89 %,12.91 %]) more calls per 10,000 subscribers than Sunday. This might be because on Sundays it is more likely for senior citizens living alone to be visited by family members or social workers and these visits might have delayed part of the senior citizens' need for emergency service to the beginning of the week. At level 0.05, the month effects was non-significant (P-value = 0.077), which seems to suggest that any marginal month effects could be due to the difference in the weather conditions in different months. The effect function for temperature is shown in Fig. 7 , from which it is noted that the effect is highly non-linear with a U-shape roughly. Due to the nonlinearity of the effect function, the effect of one unit change in the temperature is not a constant. Here we report the average effect in different temperature intervals. When the temperature is in the range 15-24°C, on average there is no significant change in call rate associated with the change in temperature (95 % CI [-0.25 %,2.15 %]). When the temperature is below 15°C, a unit decrease in temperature is associated with an increase in the call rate by 3.03 % (95 % CI: [0.75 %,5.36 %]) on average. There was about 11.3 % of the days in which the temperature was 15°C or below. When the temperature is around 28°C or higher, increases (rather than decreases) in temperature seem to be linked with increases in the call rate, although the effect is only marginally significant.
