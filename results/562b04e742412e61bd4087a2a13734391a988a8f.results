Out of the total of 32 patients enrolled, 17 (53%) were randomized to receive nebulized salbutamol and 15 (47%) to receive Symbicort ® ( Table 1) . None of the patients required admission, and none of them required additional doses of relievers. For patients within the Symbicort ® arm, by using the paired t-test for PEFR (parametric) and Wilcoxon signed rank test for respiratory rate and SaO 2 (non-parametric), it was shown that there were statistically significant improvements in SaO 2 and PEFR, and reduction in the respiratory rate (improvement of tachypnea) in patients after using Symbicort ® tubuhaler. Similar statistically significant changes were demonstrated in the nebulized salbutamol arm (Table 2) . Arguably, although the statistically significant changes in this study may not be noticeable clinically, yet, on subjective assessment, regardless of the type of intervention, 18 out of 32 (56%) patients reported being "a little better" on the 5-point Likert scale, and another 14 out of the 32 (44%) reported a "much better" response. All patients reported improvement in the VAS with the mean VAS of 2.45 cm and 2.20 cm in the Symbicort ® and nebulized salbutamol arms, respectively (Table 1) . Specifically, in the Symbicort ® arm, on the 5-point Likert scale, nine patients (60%) said they felt "a little better," and another six patients (40%) said they felt "much better." Similarly, for the nebulized salbutamol arm, nine patients (52.9%) felt "a little better," and eight patients (47.1%) felt "much better" on the 5-point Likert scale. None of the patients in either arm reported feeling "no change," "a little worse" or "much worse" after interventions (Table 1) . Incidentally, as all patients responded as being either "a little better" or "much better," we performed a post-hoc analysis using the chi-square test to compare the subjective improvement of Symbicort ® versus nebulized salbutamol, and we found that there is no statistically significant difference between these two treatments (p = 0.688).
