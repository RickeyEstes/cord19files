Between December 2015 and November 2016 inclusive, a total of 5750 participants were recruited and NPS samples collected from 5744 (99.9%) participants as shown in Table 1 . Of the 5744 samples collected, 5741 (99.9%) were tested for HRV. HRV was detected in 1057 (18.5%) of the samples tested. Of the 1057, 817 (77.3%) were successfully amplified and sequenced for the VP4/VP2 genomic region; the remaining 240 (22.7%) samples either totally failed amplification or had short consensus sequences recovered (<300 nucleotides) and were not included in phylogenetic analysis. Among the HRV positive cases, the median age was 2.0 years, 64.0% were under 5 years of age, and 53.9% were females ( Table 2 ). The percentage of samples found to be of species A, B and C was 44.1 % ( 360), 8.2% (67) and 47.7% (390), respectively, and did not differ by age or sex (Table 2) . Cough (94.5%) and nasal discharge (79.9%) were the most common clinical presentations. Difficulty in breathing, chest in-drawing, crackles, lethargy, nasal flaring, sore throat, wheezing were also recorded ( Table 2) . Clinical presentations differed significantly between the typed HRV samples for nasal discharge (p< 0.012) and difficult breathing (p< 0.022) There was no significant (p < 0.05) difference between species A and C (predominant species) for most of the clinical signs reported, except for nasal discharge (p< 0.0042) and difficult breathing (p<0.0194) (Supplementary Table 1 , Supplementary File 1). Phylogenetic analysis revealed 3 major clades representing the HRV-A, B and C species (Supplementary Figure 1 ). Three samples were not assigned to any HRV type and these were identified as Enterovirus D68 (n=2) and Coxsackievirus B5 (n=1, see offshoot in Supplementary Figure 1 ). A total of 87 different HRV types were identified: 39 within species HRV-A, 10 within HRV-B and 38 within HRV-C. Within HRV-A, A15 was the predominant type (n=62), followed by A58 (n=36) and A41 (n=20). Other HRV-A types occurred at lower frequencies, ranging from 1 to 19 cases ( Figure 1 panel A). Within HRV-B, B35 presented as the dominant type (n=41) with the other HRV-B types being detected in 1 to 8 cases ( Figure 1 panel B). Within HRV-C, C22 type was the predominant type (n=48), followed closely by C11 (n=45) and C38 (n=35). The other HRV-C types were detected as shown in Figure 1 panel C. HRV circulated throughout the study period as shown in Figure 2A . All HRV species were detected in all months except in December 2015 when only A and C were detected, although fewer samples were collected in this month. HRV incidence peaks were observed in August, September and October, while troughs were observed in December 2015 and January 2016, which was likely due to fewer samples collected in the first two months of the study. Despite HRV-C being the most prevalent, there was a varying dominance between HRV-A and HRV-C with time ( Figure 2B ). HRV species A appeared dominant in December,
