CSBF/C10orf99 is a classical secreted protein. The complete cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences of CSBF/C10orf99 are shown in Figure 1a . The cDNA of CSBF/C10orf99 contains typical polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) within the 3' UTR and Kozak sequence (CACCATG) 39 within the 5' UTR. CSBF/C10orf99 is composed of 81 amino acids, containing a signal peptide predicted by SignalP 4.0 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) and a transmembrane helices domain in the N-terminal predicted by TMHMM Server v. 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). The transmembrane helices domain is located in the signal peptide. After molecular cloning of CSBF/C10orf99, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy to determine the subcellular localization of CSBF/C10orf99 in pcDNA3.1-CSBF-myc-His transfected HEK 293T cells. As illustrated in Figure 1b Up, the red fluorescence represented CSBF-myc-His was located in cytosol. This was confirmed by transfection of another GFP-tagged CSBF/C10orf99 plasmid. The green fluorescence signals revealed that CSBF-EGFP also had a cytoplasmic localization. There was no signal presented on cell membrane or in the nucleus. The DsRed-tagged organelle markers (DsRed-ER and DsRed-Golgi) were used to precisely determine the localization of CSBF-myc-His. The results showed that CSBFmyc-His was in the lumen of intracellular compartment along the classic secretion pathway (Figure 1b, Down) . Soluble proteins containing N-terminal signal peptides are usually secreted through the classical ER/Golgi dependent pathway, which can be blocked by brefeldin A (BFA) 40 . To confirm whether CSBF/ C10orf99 is secreted via the classical pathway, we detected CSBF-Fc protein in the cell culture supernatant transfected with pwYD11-CSBF-Fc plasmid and then performed a BFA inhibition assay. As illustrated in Figure 1c , BFA treatment decreased the secretion of CSBF-Fc, confirming that CSBF/C10orf99 is a classical secretory protein. Purified CSBF-Fc protein was further sequenced by Edman degradation reaction 41, 42 . As shown in Supplementary Figure S1 , the N-terminal sequence KRRPAKAWSG is in accordance with the SignalP prediction. CSBF/C10orf99 is a ligand of SUSD2. Collectively, the above findings verified that CSBF/C10orf99 is a classical secreted protein. Previous studies deduced high-confidence interactions between CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2, as well as Gal1 and SUSD2 43 . SUSD2 encodes an 822-amino acid type I membrane protein containing extracellular domains of SO, AMOP, VWD, and CCP (Supplementary Figure S2a ) 44 . In order to determine whether these four domains are indispensable for the location and function of SUSD2, we constructed truncated mutants of these four extracellular domains and checked the expression of these constructs (Supplementary Figure S2b ). Then we examined subcellular localization of these mutants in LoVo cells. Supplementary Figure S2c showed different expression patterns of full length SUSD2 and all these mutants. Compared with the wild type of SUSD2, all these mutants are abundant in cytoplasm, suggesting that absence of any of these four domains would change the localization of this protein, which may further affect its function. So the following studies only included the function of intact SUSD2 protein. In order to verify the interaction between SUSD2 and CSBF/ C10orf99, we constructed a dicistronic mammalian expression vector 20 , pcDNA3-SUSD2-HA::IRES-CSBF-Flag, which exploited the virus-derived IRES element for the co-expression of SUSD2-HA and CSBF-Flag. Then we conducted co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay. As shown in Figure 2a , we found that CSBF/C10orf99 coimmunoprecipitated with SUSD2 and vice versa, indicating that the two proteins were in the same complex. As ligand-dependent internalization is a characteristic of receptor 45 , we next managed to confirm whether SUSD2 goes through this process. Firstly, the localization of SUSD2-EGFP was detected on the plasma membrane of pEGFP-N1-SUSD2 transfected LoVo cells (Supplementary Figure S2c) . Then we found out that CSBF/ C10orf99 induced internalization of SUSD2-EGFP in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2b Up). To precisely determine the internalization of SUSD2-EGFP, the endosome marker (DsRed-Rab5) was used. As illustrated in Figure 2b Down, the internalized SUSD2-EGFP was located in the endosome. Thses indicated that CSBF/C10orf99 can bind SUSD2, and trigger receptor internalization. Furthermore, to determine whether CSBF/C10orf99 can directly bind SUSD2, we used in situ fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to confirm the co-localization between CSBF-mCherry and SUSD2-EGFP. The fluorescence energy could transfer from EGFP to RFP when the distance between them was less than 10 nm. Human galectin-1 (Gal1) was used as a positive ligand control. Figure 2c summarized the result of the FRET assay. FRET efficiency of CSBF/SUSD2 was 15.2%, slightly higher than that of positive ligand control Gal1/SUSD2 (11.6%), with fused EGFP-mCherry 46 as a positive FRET control (25.9%). To further elucidate the biochemical nature of the CSBF/SUSD2 interaction, we measured affinity of CSBF/C10orf99 to purified extracellular region of SUSD2, which is a soluble form of SUSD2 generated by fusing extracellular moiety of SUSD2 to the Fc region of human IgG1 (sSUSD2-Fc) (Supplementary Figure S3 ). Competition binding assay were taken to detect the affinity between CSBF/C10orf99 and sSUSD2-Fc after CSBF/C10orf99 labeled with 125 I. The IC50-value was determined by nonlinear regression of competition binding. As shown in Figure 2e , curve fitting showed that unlabeled CSBF/C10orf99 displaced 125 I-labeled CSBF/C10orf99 from sSUSD2-Fc with an IC 50 of 0.28 nM, while Gal1 with an IC 50 of 0.19 nM. Together, these data strongly confirmed that CSBF/ C10orf99 is a ligand of SUSD2. CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2 are decreased in colon cancer tissues. Since CSBF/C10orf99 is a novel secreted protein, to discover more about its function, we first searched the expression profile from known databases. GEO profile analysis (GDS3113) showed that CSBF/C10orf99 is highly expressed in colon tissue, and moderately expressed in tonsil tissue among 96 samples. The SAGE database (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/SAGE/AnatomicViewer) and Human Protein Atlas (www.proteinatlas.org) reported that CSBF/C10orf99 is down-regulated in colorectal cancer tissues. We then investigated the expression pattern of CSBF/C10orf99 in normal human tissues with RT-PCR and real-time PCR, which was detected in three cDNA panels from Clontech, including two Multiple Tissues cDNA libraries (16 samples) and one Immune System Tissues cDNA library (7 samples). As shown in Figure 3a and 3b, CSBF/C10orf99 mRNA was found to be expressed in specific tissues: at the highest level in colon, at moderate level in tonsil, and almost undetectable in other tissues. Next, we detected the expression of CSBF/C10orf99 on a cDNA panel derived from 42 pairs of colon cancer and adjacent tissues. As shown in Figure 3c , the expression of CSBF/C10orf99 was dramatically reduced in most of the primary cancer tissues compared with that in the adjacent tissues. To determine whether CSBF/C10orf99 was down-regulated on the protein level, we raised a rabbit polyclonal antibody against CSBF/C10orf99 with GST-CSBF fusion protein as immunogen and purified by CSBF/C10orf99 affinity chromatography. We analyzed CSBF/C10orf99 in representative samples by immunohistochemistry. As shown in Figure 3f , CSBF/C10orf99 was down-regulated in most of colon cancer tissues, which was consistent with mRNA level. As our results indicated that SUSD2 is the receptor of CSBF/ C10orf99, we checked the expression profile of SUSD2 further. Previous study showed that SUSD2 was highly expressed in lung and kidney, and moderately expressed in mammary gland by RT-PCR 44 . GEO profile analysis (GDS3113) showed that SUSD2 was highly expressed in spinal cord, skin and lung, and moderately expressed in colon and mammary gland tissues. The SAGE database and Human Protein Atlas reported that SUSD2 is down-regulated in colorectal cancer tissues. We investigated the expression pattern of SUSD2 in normal human tissues with real-time PCR. SUSD2 was highly expressed in lung and kidney, and detectable in colon tissue ( Figure 3d ). As shown in Figures 3e and 3f , SUSD2 was also downregulated both on mRNA and protein levels in most of colon cancer tissues. CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2 are decreased in colon cancer cell lines with different patterns of gene regulation. The above results confirmed that CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2 were significantly reduced in colon cancer tissues. Then we tried to investigate the expression of CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2 in colon cancer cell lines. As shown in Figures 4a and b , both CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2 were down-regulated in six colon cancer cell lines. The putative CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2 promoters, identified by bioinformatics promoter analysis (http://www.genomatix.de), both contain non-typical CpG islands. To investigate whether the down regulation of these two genes were caused by promoter methylation, we treated LoVo and RKO cells with demethylating agent Aza, or combined with histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). The tumor suppressor CMTM3 was checked as positive control 47 . Indeed, SUSD2 expression was restored by Aza or combined with TSA both on mRNA (Figures 4c and 4d ) and protein levels (Figure 4e ), while the expression of CSBF/C10orf99 was not restored. These results clearly show that down-regulation of these two genes possesses different mechanisms. CSBF/C10orf99 interacts with SUSD2 to inhibit colon cancer cell growth. As CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2 are both down-regulated in colon cancer tissues and cell lines, we assumed whether CSBF/ C10orf99 and SUSD2 have effects on growth of colon cancer cells. As shown in Figure 5a , proliferation of HCT116 or LoVo cells became significantly slower in CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2 coexpressed group compared to other groups. These results indicated that the growth inhibition has no cell specificity, and CSBF/C10orf99 or SUSD2 did not affect cell proliferation alone in the transiently transfected system. To further confirm if the inhibitory effect of CSBF/C10orf99 is dependent on the existence of SUSD2, we used We further conducted colony formation assay to validate that the interaction between CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2 affects the growth of colon cancer cells. As shown in Figure 5c , transfected LoVo cells were cultured in the existence of G418 for two weeks. A significant reduction in colony was observed in CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2 co-expressed LoVo cells. The colony of SUSD2 singleexpressed cells was also less than that of vector control cells, while there was no obvious change in CSBF/C10orf99-expressed cells. This result indicates that long-term expressed SUSD2 decreased LoVo cell growth. To further confirm the inhibitory effects of long-term expression of SUSD2 on colon cancer cell growth, stable SUSD2-expressing cell lines were generated. As illustrated in Figure 5d , after screening with antibiotic selection, we obtained two cell strains of LoVo-SUSD2 (LoVo-SUSD2-1#, LoVo-SUSD2-2#) and two strains of LoVo-Neo cells (LoVo-Neo-1#, LoVo-Neo-2#). As illustrated in Fig. 5E , LoVo-SUSD2 cells showed lower growth rates in CCK-8 assay. Then we conducted colony formation assay with LoVo-SUSD2-1# and LoVo-Neo-1# cells. As shown in Figure 5f , the colony of LoVo-SUSD2-1# cells was also much less than that of LoVo-Neo-1# cells. To elucidate why long-term expression of SUSD2 inhibits cell growth, we performed RT-PCR to investigate whether CSBF/ C10orf99 was increased. As shown in Figure 5g , CSBF/C10orf99 was indeed up-regulated by restored expression of SUSD2. Furthermore, to clarify the effect of CSBF/C10orf99 on LoVo-SUSD2 cells, we added CSBF/C10orf99 in the colony formation assay system. As shown in Figure 5h , CSBF/C10orf99 could significantly increase the growth inhibitory effect of SUSD2, but not in LoVo-Neo cells. CSBF/C10orf99 interacts with SUSD2 to induce G1 cell cycle arrest. Usually, inhibition of cell growth is induced by apoptosis or cell cycle arrest 48 . Our results showed that there was no significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells (Supplementary Figure  S4 ). Then we further detected cell cycle of transfected LoVo cells by FACS. As shown in Figures 6a and b , when CSBF/C10orf99 was coexpressed with SUSD2 in LoVo cells, G0/G1 phase cells were significantly increased and S phase cells were decreased, but no obvious change was observed in other groups. These results suggest that co-expressing of CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2 might induce G1 cell cycle arrest. We further examined several key cell cycle regulators by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 6c , cyclin D1, cyclin D3 and CDK6 were down-regulated in CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2 co-expressing LoVo cells, consistent with the phenotypes of G1 cell cycle arrest. While the expression of cyclin B1 was not changed, consisting with the undetectable change of G2/M phase. Overall, these results confirmed that CSBF/C10orf99 interacts with SUSD2 to induce G1 cell cycle arrest.
