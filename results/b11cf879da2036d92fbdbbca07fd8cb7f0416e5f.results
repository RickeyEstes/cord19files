The molecular design of a TNF-α epitope-scaffold immunogen Nagahira K et al have shown that a neutralizing monoclonal antibody 3B10 binds TNF-α at position 81-88 [20] . When conjugated to KLH, the linear epitope peptide (aa 80-96) elicits weak antibody response against the native TNF-α [21] whereas the cyclic form induced stronger antibody response, indicating that a stable conformation is preferred for immunogenicity. In the crystal structure of mouse TNF-α (mTNF-α, PDB 2tnf), residues 80 to 96 form a β-hairpin structure (Fig 1A) , and the interatomic distance between the end residues (aa80 and aa96) is 8.76Å. In search for a scaffold for this epitope, we found that diphtheria toxin T-domain (DTT, aa 202-378 of DT) could be a good candidate for both conformational stabilization and adjuvanting. Firstly, the function of T-domain is engaged in translocation of the catalytic domain of DT across the endosomal membrane in low pH-dependent manner [22] . Thus there is no safety issue associated with this domain [23] . Secondly, DTT has a rigid tertiary structure composed entirely of α-helices and loops ( Fig 1B) . Therefore, it potentially tolerates transplantation of a foreign peptide and renders the peptide a more stable conformation [24, 25] . Moreover, DTT can be expressed in E.coli as a highly soluble protein and the CD spectrum of the purified DTT shows a typical helical conformation with two minima at 208 and 222nm (Fig 1C) . This would substantially reduce manufacture costs. Thirdly, DTT possesses four T help cell epitopes (aa 69-88, 119-138, 129-148, 149-168, corresponding to DT aa 271-290, 321-340, 331-350, and 351-370), each of which is recognized by human major histocompatibility complexes (HAL) with population coverage of 88%, 71%, 82%, 70%, respectively [26] . As human MHC II genes are highly polymorphic, a combination of universal Th epitopes promises more population coverage. Among people previously immunized with DT vaccine, the Th epitopes in a DTTbased vaccine induced a rapid recall response of CD4 memory T cell [27] . As shown in Fig 1B, the DTT residues at positions 89-96 form a turn-helix-turn structure that is entirely surface-exposed. We speculated that this is a potential site for the epitope transplantation. Since the interatomic distance between the end residues of the epitope peptide is 2.88Å shorter than that of DTT aa 89 and 96, direct transplantation would potentially introduce conformational constraint to both DTT and the epitope. In order to identify appropriate transplantation that keeps the epitope conformation close to that of native molecule while DTT conformation is minimally perturbed, we generated seven epitope-scaffold molecules ( Fig 1D) with difference of the interatomic distance between the epitope and the replaced segment (ΔD) varies in a range of -3.34 Å to +3.68 Å. As ΔD of DTNF3 and DTNF4 is close to each other because some of the replaced residues are at the turn of the helix, we choose DTNF4 for further experiments. DTNF7 is generated by replacing DTT 89-96 with the epitope peptide encompassing TNF-α residues 80-97. The inclusion of one more residue in the epitope peptide increases TD to 12.11 Å and reduces the ΔD to -0.47 Å. DTNF proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. All of them are highly soluble at the concentration greater than 10 mg/mL in PBS pH 7.4, 25°C. Their circular dichroism spectra are characteristic of α-helical conformation similar to that of DTT (Fig 1C) . Fig 2 shows that mice immunized with individual DTNF proteins generated high titers of antibody against DTT (Fig 2A) indicating that the transplantations do not interfere with the antigenicity of DTT. However, DTNF7 elicited most robust antibody response against mouse and human TNF-α, whereas the rest DTNF proteins induced much weaker responses (Fig 2B,  Fig 2C and 2D) , indicating that the epitope presentation is perturbed for most of the immunogens. No antibody response against native TNF-α was observed in mice immunized with DTTpeptide conjugate D-TNF 80-96 , which is consistent with a previous report showing that this peptide in linear form conjugated to KLH is a poor immunogen [14] . In DTNF7 immunized mice, over 98% of the antibodies on day 49 were IgG1 subclass ( Fig  2E) , which suggests that the immunoglobulin class switch has completed and the immune response is dominated by type 2 T helper cells. Remarkably, the anti-TNF-α titer was sustained for more than six months with the level decreased slightly to 80% of the maximum response on day 223 (Fig 2F) , suggesting that the B cell response is mediated by activated T helper cell. In comparison with conjugate vaccines targeting TNF-α, only transient antibody responses were observed due to lack of Th-dependent B cell response [9, 10] . Our data demonstrate that the universal Th epitopes of DTT can help overcome this shortcoming. The sustained anti-TNF-α antibody response is beneficial to treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as excessive TNF-α is persistently expressed in patients. Mice immunized with DTNF7 grew normally and their body weights, sizes of liver and spleen, and skin morphology showed no difference to control mice administered with PBS and DTT. No redness at injection sites were observed in DTNF7 immunized mice. These data implicate that the vaccine formulation is safe. Further studies is warranted to exam whether the vaccination perturb the physiological function of the cytokine and the significance thereof.
