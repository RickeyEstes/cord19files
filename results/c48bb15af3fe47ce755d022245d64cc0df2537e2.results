Identifying host proteins interacting with TGEV-S1 via a two-hybrid assay The bait vector pGBKT7 in the yeast two-hybrid system was constructed to screen the interactions between the TGEV-S1 protein and host proteins, and the recombinant plasmid was successfully transformed into Y2HGold yeast cells ( Figure 1A ). Western blotting showed that pGBKT7-S1 produced a fusion protein of approximately 100 kDa ( Figure 1B ). Yeast cells harboring pGBKT7-S1 and those harboring pGBKT7 (control) were spread at two dilutions onto SD/Trp plates, and the size and number of yeast colonies produced by pGBKT7-S1 were compared with those of colonies produced by the control pGBKT7. The results suggest that the bait vector was not toxicity to the yeast ( Figure 1C ). Yeast cells harboring pGBKT7-S1 were spread at two dilutions on plates of three different selective media. No colony growth was observed on the SD/−Trp/X-α-Gal/AbA plates, indicating that there was no self-activation phenomenon for the reporter genes ( Figure 1D ). These results indicate that the constructed pGBKT7-S1 bait vector could be used the yeast two-hybrid system for screening host proteins that interact with the TGEV-S1 protein. TGEV-S1 protein-associated cellular proteins were identified using the yeast two-hybrid system. The zygotes typically displayed a three-lobed structure similar to a "Mickey Mouse" face at 40× magnification ( Figure 1E ) after the bait strains Y2HGold (pGBKT7-S1) and Y187 (pIECs cDNA) were mixed and incubated. After three rounds of screening on plates with different nutrient-deficient media, a total of 120 blue clones that grew on the SD/−Trp/−Leu/− Ade/−His/X-α-Gal/AbA plates were visible ( Figure 1F ). Finally, twelve candidate proteins were available for a BLAST search of the sequencing results (Table 3) .
