Cloning, expression, and purification of SARS-CoV RdRp SARS-CoV strain BJ101 was used to infect Vero cells and the total viral RNA was extracted from the infected cells. The cDNA complementary to the coding sequence of SARS-CoV RdRp was obtained using reverse transcription with random primers. Two overlapping DNA fragments (R1, 1428 nucleotides and R2, 1458 nucleotides) that cover the full-length SARS-CoV RdRp gene (2796 nucleotides) were cloned separately and then ligated together. The fulllength RdRp (residues 1 -932) has been successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. as a GST-fusion protein with a molecular mass of 132.8 kDa. Most of the recombinant GST-RdRp protein was expressed in inclusion bodies and found at the precipitated pellet of the cell lysate; a small portion remained as soluble form in the supernatant. To increase the quantity of the soluble protein, induction experiments at different IPTG concentrations and temperatures were carried out. Change of the induction conditions had very marginal effect ( Fig. 1) . High concentration of IPTG appeared to yield a slightly higher expression level of the soluble protein. It was also found that the expression level of GST-RdRp in the Origami (DE3) cells was slightly better than in the BL21 (DE3) (pLysS) cells (data not shown). Therefore, the final protein expression experiments were performed in the Origami (DE3) cells at the induction condition of 1 mM IPTG and 28 -C for 3 h. The soluble GST-RdRp protein could bind to the glutathione Sepharose 4B column. The purification yield was low because most of the protein precipitated in inclusion bodies and the protein had a poor binding affinity with the column. Optimization of the purification procedure slightly improved the yield which was typically about 0.2 mg GST-RdRp protein with about 80% purity from 1 L of cell culture (Fig. 2a) . During purification, it was observed that the fulllength GST-RdRp protein was unstable and cleaved gradually when stored at both room temperature and 4 -C. Three fragments with molecular masses of approximately 64 kDa (p64), 39 kDa (p39), and 30 kDa (p30), respectively, are the main products of the cleavage (Fig. 2b) . Addition of the protease inhibitor PMSF in the washing buffer did not prevent the cleavage. To characterize the cleavage fragments, the cleavage mixture of the full-length GST-RdRp protein was further purified with the polyA Sepharose 4B column (Fig. 2b) . It is very interesting to find that the full-length GST-RdRp protein bound poorly to the polyA column and most of the protein went through the column. On the other hand, majority of the p64 and p39 fragments bound to the column and were co-purified at a molar ratio of about 1:1; only a small portion of them were in the flow-through fractions. The p30 fragment could not bind to the column and was found in the flow-through fractions. The GST could not be completely removed by the polyA column purification due to its abundance and existed as the main impurity in the purified sample. Treatment of the protein sample with thrombin cleaved the p39 fragment into two small fragments with molecular masses of 12 kDa (p12) and 26 kDa, respectively, while the p64 and p30 fragments remained intact. The 26-kDa fragment was shown to be GST by Western blot analysis. Purification of the thrombin processed protein sample with the polyA column showed that the p12 fragment also bound to the column and was co-purified with the p64 fragment in about 1:1 molar ratio (Fig. 3a) . These results indicate that the p64 and p12 (or p39) fragments appear to form a complex that binds to polyA and the full-length GST-RdRp has a weaker ability to bind to polyA than the p64/p12 complex. Formation of a stable p64/p12 complex is also supported by results from native PAGE and isoelectric focusing (IEF) gel analyses. Native PAGE of the final protein sample exhibited a single band corresponding to the p64/p12 complex and two bands for GST (Fig. 3b ). IEF gel of the protein sample also showed that the p64/p12 complex migrated in a pH gradient as a single band with a pI of about 5.2; GST had dual bands at pI of 5.3 and 5.4 (Fig. 3c) . The C-terminal p64 fragment of SARS-CoV RdRp comprises the polymerase catalytic domain (see results later). Attempts to chromatographically separate the p64 and p12 fragments were unsuccessful. In order to evaluate the biological property of the catalytic domain, we cloned the recombinant p64 fragment separately that includes 563 residues from the C-terminus of the enzyme (residues 369-932). Initial attempts of cloning this protein fragment (termed p64) as a hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein (in the pET22b+ or pET28b+ expression vector) resulted in insoluble protein. Hence, p64 was subcloned in the pGEX-4T1 expression vector and expressed in E. coli. strain BL21 Fig. 3 . Characterization of the p64/p12 complex. After purification with the glutathione Sepharose 4B column, the full-length GST-RdRp protein sample was stored at 4 -C for 5 days. One portion was treated with thrombin for the cleavage of GST and another was not treated with thrombin. Both samples were further purified with the polyA Sepharose 4B column. (DE3) (pLysS) as a GST-fusion protein. Similar to the fulllength GST-RdRp, most of the expressed GST-p64 protein (molecular mass of 90.5 kDa) was insoluble (Fig. 2c) . The GST-p64 protein could not bind to the polyA Sepharose 4B column. Therefore, purification of the GST-p64 protein was carried out only with the glutathione Sepharose 4B column. The purification effect was poor due to the weak binding of the protein with the column and the purified GST-p64 protein was mixed with other small protein impurities. One band with a molecular mass of 64 kD appears to be the GSTcleaved p64 protein. This GST-p64 protein sample was used in the polymerase activity assays.
