Between Dec 27, 2010, and April 30, 2011, we enrolled 624 participants with infl uenza-like illness of 650 people screened at 74 centres in the USA (fi gure 1). The study was terminated with about 60% of the planned number of patients infected with infl uenza because of the end of the infl uenza season. After randomisation, patients' character istics were well balanced between groups (table 1). 386 (62%) of 624 participants enrolled were diagnosed with a respiratory virus infection at baseline including 257 (41%) with infl uenza A or B (table 2) . Demographic and disease-related characteristics of participants were similar for each of the three treatment groups (tables 1-3). Treatment with nitazoxanide 600 mg twice daily for 5 days signifi cantly decreased the time from fi rst dose to alleviation of symptoms compared with placebo in participants with confi rmed infl uenza (p=0·0084; fi gure 2, table 4). Time to symptom alleviation also decreased in patients given nitazoxanide 300 mg compared with those given placebo, but the diff erence was not signifi cant (p=0·52). We used Prentice-Wilcoxon test for these analyses because the proportional hazards assumption required for use of the Cox model was violated (interaction of the 600 mg nitazoxanide treatment group with log(time) was signifi cant [p=0·0294]). At the time of symptom alleviation, no participants were still receiving symptom relief medication (paracetamol). We did sensitivity analyses in the population with confi rmed infl uenza to assess the eff ects of censored data and use of paracetamol on the primary endpoint. For participants with censored data (dropouts or without symptom alleviation at last diary assessment, n=16), we assumed time to alleviation of symptoms of 28 days. In this analysis, results were similar to the primary effi cacy analysis favouring nitazoxanide 600 mg compared with placebo (p=0·0062 [data not shown). 212 (82%) of 257 participants enrolled in the population with confi rmed infl uenza reported taking paracetamol during the study as allowed by the study protocol. Proportions of participants taking paracetamol were similar in the three treatment groups: 73 (82%) of 89 participants in the placebo group, 74 (83%) of 89 in the nitazoxanide 300 mg group, and 65 (82%) of 79 in the nitazoxanide 600 mg group. When we repeated the primary analysis including paracetamol use and its interaction with the treatment group, participants receiving nitazoxanide 600 mg had a shorter time to symptom alleviation than did those receiving placebo (p=0·0085). In this study, we enrolled participants within 48 h of symptom onset, whereas in studies of neuraminidase inhibitors participants were enrolled within 36 h. 8, 9, 11 To assess the eff ect of this variable, we analysed participants enrolled within 36 h of symptom onset. In these post-hoc analyses, diff erences (nitazoxanide 600 mg vs placebo) in Responses for subgroups infected with infl uenza A or B were similar (table 4). In analyses of 624 participants treated and 238 (38%) participants with no virus identifi ed at baseline, time from fi rst dose to alleviation of symptoms was signifi cantly lower in the 600 mg group than in the placebo group (table 4). We investigated too few participants infected with other individual viral infections to make meaningful analyses. Another diff erence between the design of this study and earlier studies of the neuraminidase inhibitors was the scoring of nine symptoms instead of seven. 8, 9 Use of two additional symptoms, runny nose and sweats or chills, only aff ected the time to alleviation of symptoms for six participants (three given placebo, one given nitazoxanide 300 mg, and two given nitazoxanide 600 mg). Analysis based on the seven symptoms used in the oseltamivir studies showed median times to alleviation of symptoms of 115·9 h (95% CI 108-121) for the placebo group, 109·1 h (96-130, p=0·58) for the nitazoxanide 300 mg treatment group, and 95·5 h (84-108, p=0·0074) for the nitazoxanide 600 mg treatment group. At baseline, cough and nasal congestion were the most persistent symptoms in participants infected with infl uenza. The median time to alleviation in the placebo group for cough was 104 h (95% CI 84-111) and for nasal congestion was 81 h (67-92). Treatment with nitazoxanide 600 mg was associated with a decrease in the median duration of these symptoms to 84 h (95% CI 60-104) for cough and to 60 h (48-74) for nasal congestion. For nine symptoms, in participants infected with infl uenza, mean symptom score-hours (symptom severity score multiplied by hours) summed for every participant from baseline to alleviation of symptoms were 1221 (592 SD) for the placebo group, 1305 (765) for the nitazoxanide 300 mg treatment group, and 1125 (681) for the nitazoxanide 600 mg treatment group, whereas in all treated participants, the score-hours were 1232 (1028) for the placebo group, 1171 (972) for the 300 mg treatment group, and 1045 (661) for the 600 mg treatment group. Complications of infl uenza (bronchitis, sinusitis, otitis, pneumonia, and pleurisy) were fairly uncommon in this population. The frequency was not signifi cantly diff erent between treatment groups: 15 events (7%) for placebo, compared with 20 (10%) for the nitazoxanide 300 mg treatment group (p=0·38), and 11 (5%) for the nitazoxanide 600 mg treatment group (p=0·54). We obtained daily nasopharyngeal swabs at baseline and on days 2-5 for 113 participants (41 in the placebo group, 33 in the nitazoxanide 300 mg treatment group, and 39 in the nitazoxanide 600 mg treatment group). TCID 50 viral titres signifi cantly decreased during treatment in the nitazoxanide 600 mg group compared with placebo group (p=0·0006; fi gure 3 roughly 1 log 10 were apparent within 24 h after initiation of treatment for the nitazoxanide 600 mg group and continued until day 5 when viral shedding stopped for almost all participants in the placebo group. Reductions in TCID 50 viral titres were also recorded for the nitazoxanide 300 mg treatment group compared with the placebo group, although these diff erences were not as large as for the nitazoxanide 600 mg treatment group and were not signifi cant (fi gure 3). Reductions in viral titres detected by TCID 50 were similar to those dectected by RT-PCR except that the magnitude of reductions were somewhat smaller when measured by RT-PCR, which also detects non-infectious virus particles. Median times to cessation of viral shedding were 91·3 h (95% CI 67·5-96·0) for the placebo group, 77·0 h (48·0-95·5) for the nitazoxanide 300 mg treatment group, and 71·8 h (55·0-96·0) for the nitazoxanide 600 mg treatment group. At day 7, only one participant (placebo group) was positive for infl uenza infection by viral culture. Infl uenza virus was detected by RT-PCR in samples from day 7 for 23 (39%) of 59 patients in the placebo group, 17 (19%) of 73 patients in the nitazoxanide 300 mg treatment group, and 15 (24%) of 63 patients in the 600 mg treatment group. We cultured infl uenza viruses from nasopharyngeal swabs taken on day 5 from 13 participants treated with nitazoxanide. Viruses present in all 13 samples were inhibited by tizoxanide, with eff ective concentrations EC50 and EC90 similar to those inhibiting viruses present in the corresponding baseline samples (data not shown). To assess potential eff ect of treatment on humoral immune response, we measured antibody titres at baseline and day 28 for participants with laboratory-confi rmed infl uenza by RT-PCR or viral culture at baseline. We noted no signifi cant diff erences in antibody titre change from baseline to day 28 or in the proportions of participants with laboratory-confi rmed infl uenza seroprotected (antibody titre ≥40) or seroconverted (four-fold increase in antibody titre) at day 28 between the treatment groups. Seroconversion rates were 34 (49%) of 70 participants for the placebo group, 36 (58%) of 62 for the nitazoxanide 300 mg treatment group, and 36 (55%) of 65 for the nitazoxanide 600 mg treatment groups (p=0·52). We analysed plasma concentrations of tizoxanide during the fi rst 12 h after dosing on the morning of day 2 for six participants treated with nitazoxanide 300 mg and ten participants treated with nitazoxanide 600 mg. Mean maximum plasma concentrations of tizoxanide were 2·46 μg/mL (SD 1·36) for the nitazoxanide 300 mg group and 4·60 μg/mL (3·61) for the nitazoxanide 600 mg, and mean trough concentrations were 0·121 μg/mL (0·09) for the nitazoxanide 300 mg treatment group and 0·795 μg/mL (1·97) for the nitazoxanide 600 mg group. Mean area under the curve (AUC 0-12 h ) for tizoxanide plasma concentrations were 12·6 μg × h/mL (SD 9·2) for the nitazoxanide 300 mg group and 29·1 μg × h/mL (33·8) for the nitazoxanide 600 mg group. Analysis of change in TCID 50 viral titre for participants with confi rmed infl uenza that we took daily nasopharyngeal swabs from. Statistical comparison with mixed model for repeated measures including baseline viral titre, treatment group, and geographic location: p=0·0006 for the diff erence between nitazoxanide 600 mg and placebo, p=0·1553 for the diff erence between nitazoxanide 300 mg and placebo. group compared with none in the placebo group. This event was probably attributed to the colour of nitazoxanide metabolites. Because of the mild nature and relative infrequency of chromaturia (14 [2%] of 624 participants enrolled), the blinding of the study was not aff ected.
