In total, 20,138 individuals started the survey. Of those who started, 16,510 individuals from 11 countries completed the survey (82% completion rate). Respondents took a median of 18 min (inter-quartile range 13-25 min) to complete the survey. Respondents were recruited from the following countries: Finland Among the respondents, the average age was 46.8 years (SD 16.2). Females comprised 49.8% of the respondents. The majority of respondents were married (60.7%). About 9.1% of respondents were healthcare workers, and 4999 (30.5%) respondents had received an influenza vaccination within the past two years (Table 1) . After reading the simulated newspaper article, respondents indicated that they preferred heat maps and picto-trendlines versus dot maps (4.90 vs. 4.93 vs. 4.40, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2, Table 2 , and Appendix Table 1 ). Additionally, respondents who received the heat map were significantly more likely to be interested in vaccination (4.67 vs. 4.56, P = 0.01), perceive a greater likelihood of contracting influenza (3.62 vs. 3.50, P < 0.001), and be interested in more information about influenza (5.27 vs. 5.20, P = 0.04) compared to those who received a picto-trendline. Overall, knowledge obtained from graphics was low; however, respondents who received heat maps (25.4%) and picto-trendlines (25.4%) were significantly more likely to answer knowledge questions correctly than those who received dot maps (22.7%) (P < 0.001). Respondents who received the dot map reported a significantly higher perceived likelihood of contracting influenza (3.58 vs. 3.50, P = 0.03) than those who received a picto-trendline, but dot maps did not differ significantly from heat maps or picto-trendlines for all other outcomes (all P > 0.06) ( Table 2 and Appendix Table 1 ). For the outcome of graphic preference, there was an interaction between the graphic received and country of the respondent (P < 0.001). This moderating effect was due to differences in whether heat maps or picto-trendlines were rated higher than the other; dot maps were preferred least in all countries (Fig. 2) . However, graphic preference was not moderated by recent vaccination history, education, age, country, or gender (all P > 0.10).
