Inactivated SARS-CoV induced high titer of S proteinspecific antibodies in mice and rabbits SARS-CoV particles inactivated with b-propiolactone were used for immunizing mice and rabbits. After three immunizations, all the immunized mice and rabbits developed high levels of antibody responses against SARS-CoV as detected by ELISA with commercially available diagnostic kits that use the mixture of proteins purified from viral lysates as coating antigen (mean endpoint titers of mouse and rabbit antisera were 1:102,400 and 1:83,200, respectively), while the preimmune sera from the mice and rabbits did not react with the viral antigens (Fig. 1) . To determine antibody responses specific for the SARS-CoV S protein in the immunized mice and rab-bits, a recombinant full-length S protein was used as an antigen in ELISA. The data in Figs. 2A and 3A indicated that the mice and rabbits immunized with the inactivated viruses developed high titers of antibodies against the S protein. The mean end-point titers of mouse and rabbit antisera were 1:51,200 and 1:25,600, respectively. It is expected that antibodies reacting with the S protein may contain an antibody population spe- Fig. 1 . Antibody responses against SARS-CoV in the immunized mice (A) and rabbits (B).

We therefore used recombinant S1-C9 as an antigen in ELISA and found that the antibody titers against S1 were comparable to those against the full-length S protein (Figs. 2B and 3B). We then determined whether the antisera reacted with RBD within S1 region since it is a functional domain in S protein responsible for mediating virus binding to the receptor ACE2 [14] [15] [16] [17] and contains neutralizing epitopes [25] . RBD-Fc fusion protein was used as a coating antigen in the ELISA for testing the reactivities of mouse and rabbit antisera. Strikingly, both mouse and rabbit antisera were highly reactive with the RBD-Fc with mean end-point titers of 1:51,200 and 1:25,600, respectively (Figs. 2C and 3C) , at similar levels of responses against the full-length S protein. This suggests that the RBD on the S protein of the inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine preparation is a major antigenic determinant capable of inducing potent antibody responses in the immunized animals.
