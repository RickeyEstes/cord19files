Crystallization and structure determination of HKU1 CTD. We recently reported that the CTD of the HKU1 S protein contained the RBD and the epitopes for neutralizing antibodies mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 (ref. 29) . To gain structural and molecular insights into the receptor binding motif and neutralizing epitopes, we carried out a crystallographic study on the CTD of the HKU1 S protein. We designed several CTD-containing constructs with various N-and C-termini on the basis of the available structural information for the S proteins of other CoVs and secondary structure prediction of the S1 protein of HKU1. Among them, the construct encoding residues 310-677 (numbering from the amino acid sequence of S protein of HKU1 genotype A, or 1A), designated as 1A-S310-677aa, gave the highest level of protein expression in our insect expression system. Moreover, the purified 1A-S310-677aa protein was recognized by four conformational antibodies in ELISA, including mHKUS-2, -3, -4 and -6 ( Fig. 1b) . The mHKUS-1 only recognizes NTD of HKU1 S protein 29 . More importantly, HKU1 virus infection on primary HTBE cells was reduced approximately fivefold by pre-incubation and addition of 1A-S310-677aa at 20 mM (Fig. 1c,d) , whereas NTD of HKU1 S protein did not show marked inhibition at the same concentration (Supplementary Fig. 2A and refs 16, 29) . These results indicate that the function and overall conformation of the purified 1A-S310-677aa protein was nearly intact. After removal of its 6xhis-tag, 1A-S310-677aa protein formed crystals in the C222 1 space group with one molecule per asymmetric unit ( Table 1 ). The crystals diffracted to 1.9 Å resolution, and the structure of 1A-S310-677aa was solved using native single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) phasing 34 . Native-SAD takes advantage of the weak anomalous signal of light elements naturally present in biological macromolecules such as sulfur and phosphorus. The construct 1A-SS310-677aa contains 24 cysteines. The anomalous scattering from sulfur and phosphorus is very weak and requires merging of multiple data sets from either multiple crystals or from a single crystal collected in multiple orientations. Accordingly, 16 data sets from two isomorphous crystals collected in multiple orientations were scaled and merged. The final dataset had an anomalous signal extending to B3.1 Å and its overall resolution was better than 2.3 Å (CC1/2 of highest-resolution shell: 89.4%). The final structure had excellent refinement statistics and stereochemistry quality ( Table 1) . Structure of HKU1 CTD. In this structure, we located 364 out of 368 amino acids of 1A-S310-677aa in the electron density and found that four residues, N355, N433, N454 and N470, were glycosylated (Fig. 4b) . The structure consists of three subdomains: the core, the insertion or variable loop, and the SD-1.The core and insertion loop form the CTD of the HKU1 S1 subunit. The overall structure of 1A-S310-677aa resembles the shape of a two-arm 'boomerang' with the core and SD-1 subdomains in one arm and the insertion loop in the other arm. The core subdomain of 1A-S310-677aa is comprised of residues from 311 to 428 and 589 to 613, and has nine b-sheets (b1-7, b13-14) and five helices (a1-5) (Fig. 2) . The topology of the core subdomain is highly similar to those of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HKU4 and MHV (Fig. 3) . Five-stranded anti-parallel b-sheets (b3-7, b13) are sandwiched by five connecting helices (a1-5) with a1, a2 and a3 on one side and a4 and a5 on the other side (Fig. 2) . The structure is further stabilized by three pairs of disulfide bonds between cysteine 327 and 352, 370 and 423, and 382 and 605 ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). These disulfide bridges are also conserved in the CTDs of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The insertion loops of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV contain the receptor-binding motifs essential for receptor interaction [25] [26] [27] . We previously found that the receptor binding motif of the HKU1 S protein was likely also present in the insertion loop 29 . Compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the insertion loop of HKU1 CTD is much bigger and spans residues 429-588, making it larger than the core structure in terms of the number of amino acids. The structure of the insertion loop consists of five b-sheets (b8-12) and five helices (a6-10), and the overall shape resembles an 'ox horn' (Fig. 2 ). The tip of the 'horn' is formed by folding back two anti-parallel b-sheets, b10 and b11. Of note, the subdomain contains several extended loops that lack the obvious secondary structures and is highly cysteine-rich. Sixteen cysteine residues form eight pairs of disulfide bonds, providing essential restraints that stabilize the structure. The insertion loop is a part of CTD and is one of the most variable regions in the S protein. The structures of five other b-CoVs CTDs are available, including MHV (lineage A), SARS-CoV (lineage B), MERS-CoV (lineage C), HKU4 (lineage C) and HKU9 (lineage D). Their CTDs shares 47.1%, 19.0%, 25.3%, 22.1% and 17.1% amino acid sequence identity with HKU1 CTD, respectively. The structure alignment of the CTDs from different b-CoVs reveals that the structure of the insertion loop of HKU1 significantly differs from the others (Fig. 3) . The r.m.s.d. values for the structural alignments of these CTDs are 1.9 Å between MHV and HKU1, based on 187 aligned residues (59% of MHV CTD); 2.2 Å between SARS and HKU1, based on 142 aligned residues (82% of residues in SARS CTD); 2.1 Å between MERS and HKU1, based on 158 aligned residues (76% residues in MERS CTD); 2.52 Å between HKU4 and HKU1, based on 136 aligned residues (65% of HKU4 CTD); and 2.36 Å between HKU9 and HKU1, based on 146 aligned residues (86% HKU9 CTD). A Dali server search against all available structures returned no homologue hits, indicating that the structure of the insertion loop of 1A-S310-677aa is novel. The SD-1 subdomain is b-rich and consists of amino acids 614 to 674. This subdomain contains five b-sheets (b15-19) and one helix (a11). All five b-sheets form a b-sandwich, with b15 and b16 in one layer and b17-19 in the other layer. The two layers stack tightly against each other through extensive hydrophobic interactions. The SD-1 of HKU1 shares B70% amino acid sequence identity with MHV, and their structures are also highly conserved 33 . The structure alignment of MHV and HKU1 SD-1 gave an r.m.s.d. value of 0.96 Å based on 60 aligned residues (100% of MHV SD-1). It is worth noting that b15 and b1 form parallel b-sheets, connecting the SD-1 subdomain to the core subdomain, and b1 is also directly connected with the NTD of the S protein 18, 33 . The b1 appears to play an important role in maintaining the metastable state of the S protein before binding to the receptor. A Tyr to Ala substitution at the position 320 (Y320A) in the b1 of the S protein of MHV A59 (equivalent to H318 in HKU1 S, Supplementary Fig. 1 ) causes spontaneous dissociation of S1 from S protein and results in formation of receptor-and pH-independent syncytia in 293 T cells ( Supplementary Fig. 3) , suggesting that the Y320A mutation in MHV S protein may disrupt the interactions between SD-1 and the core subdomain, and somehow cause the dissociation of S1 from S2 even without receptor binding, leading to conformational changes of S2 and membrane fusion. Previously Kirchdoerfer et al 18 postulated that the complex folding of SD-1 and SD-2 may allow receptor-induced conformational changes in the CTD to be transmitted to other parts of the S protein. Because SD-1 is connected to both NTD and CTD and the Y320A mutation in MHV S protein destabilizes the association between S1 and S2, we propose that SD-1 may serve as a key motif to allow receptor-induced conformational changes in either the NTD or CTD to be transmitted to other parts of the S protein. HKU1 S protein trimer model with S1-CTD. Since the majority of the insertion domain was missing in the EM structures of the trimeric HKU1 S proteins, integration of the high resolution structure of 1A-S310-677aa into the EM structure of the HKU1 S protein would aid our understanding of how the HKU1 S protein interacts with its unknown receptor and how the neutralizing antibodies, mHKUS-2 and -3, inhibit HKU1 virus infection. Using the core and SD-1 subdomains as references, we superimposed the crystal structure of 1A-S310-677aa onto the EM structure of the HKU1 S protein. This superimposition aligned 181 Ca atoms of the core and SD-1 subdomains with an r.m.s.d. value of 1.2 Å, indicating a good fit. In this integrated model, all four glycosylation sites previously identified in the crystal structure remained well exposed. While N433 and N454 lie on the top of the trimer, N355 and N470 are at the side of the trimer (Fig. 4) . Consistent with previous findings 18 , the structural alignment of CTDs of HKU1, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV showed that the regions in the HKU1 CTD equivalent to the receptor-binding motifs of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are buried between two adjacent monomers in the trimeric HKU1 S proteins. Interestingly, the recently reported cryo-EM structure of the human a-CoV NL63 S protein reveals that many critical receptor-binding residues in the NL63 S protein were also either buried or masked by glycosylation in native trimer, and direct binding of the S protein to its receptor, hACE2, requires significant conformational changes in the S protein 35 . Hiding the receptor binding motif might serve as an important immune evasion strategy to avoid the generation of potent neutralizing antibodies against the receptor-binding motif 35 . Identification of the neutralizing epitope of HKU1 S protein. Phylogenetically, there are three genotypes of HKU1 viruses (A, B and C) derived from viral recombination events. The S proteins from genotypes B and C are identical. The S proteins of genotype B/C (designated as 1B) share approximately 85% identity with genotype A (designated as 1A) and B76% identity in the CTD. Since there is a significant sequence difference in CTDs between 1A and 1B, we next determined whether the S1 protein of 1B (1B-S14-752aa) was recognized by our neutralizing antibodies (previously only tested on HKU1 genotype A). The mHKUS-1 antibody, which recognizes the NTD of the HKU1-A S protein, strongly bound the purified 1B-S14-752aa protein ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . To our surprise, no other antibodies (mHKUS-2, mHKUS-3, mHKUS-4, nor mHKUS-6) showed marked binding to 1B-S14-752aa ( Supplementary Fig. 4) , indicating that the epitopes for these antibodies might lie in the sequence differences in the CTDs between 1A and 1B. To further delineate the neutralizing epitopes of mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3, we constructed six 1A/1B chimeras (1A/B-1 to 1A/B-6) using 1A-S310-677aa as the backbone (Fig. 5a) . All chimeric proteins were expressed and their affinity to the neutralizing antibodies was evaluated. and mHKUS-3 (Fig. 5a) , suggesting that the epitopes for mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 may be present between amino acid 505-514, where the tip of the 'horn' is located. The tip has two possible interfaces that are accessible to antibody binding. To ascertain which interface was critical for binding, we investigated where the non-neutralizing antibody mHKUS-6 binds to 1A-S310-677aa. The mHKU-6 strongly bound to 1A/B -1, 1A/B -3, 1A/B -4 and 1A/B -6, but failed to bind to 1A/B -2 and only showed minimal affinity to 1A/B -5 (Fig. 5a) , indicating that the epitopes for mHKUS-6 are located at amino acids 478-503 and 551-571. Further analysis of the structure of 1A-S310-677aa reveals that mHKUS-6 likely binds to the helix formed by amino acid 480-484 and the nearby loop consisting of residues 560-564, next to the outer interface of the tip (Fig. 5a) . Since mHKUS-6 is a non-neutralizing antibody, we reasoned that the neutralizing epitopes of mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 likely lie on the inner interface of the tip and that the tip is highly immunogenic. To further identify the residues in 1A-S310-677aa that interact with the neutralizing antibodies mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3, we individually mutated most of the residues on or near the tip's inner interface and characterized their binding to mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 using ELISA. While all mutant proteins were recognized by the mHKUS-6 antibody (Fig. 5b) , indicating that these individual mutations have minimal effect on the overall conformation of 1A-S310-677aa, replacement of the amino acids V509, L510, D511, H512 or W515 with alanine nearly completely abolished the binding of mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 to 1A-S310-677aa (Fig. 5b) , suggesting that V509, L510, D511, H512, and W515 are essential for binding mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3. The R517A mutant also significantly reduced the affinity of 1A-S310-677aa with mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 (Fig. 5b) , indicating that R517 is also important for mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 binding. These results confirm that the neutralizing epitopes for mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 are located at the inner face of the tip. Identification of critical residues for receptor binding. Next, we evaluated whether any residue critical for neutralizing antibody binding was also involved in binding to the unidentified receptor. The 1B-S310-676aa protein also effectively inhibited HKU1 virus infection (Fig. 6a) , indicating that the receptor binding residues are likely conserved between 1A-S310-677aa and 1B-S310-676aa. We individually mutated the residues conserved between1A-S310-677aa and 1B-S310-676aa in or close to the neutralizing antibody-interacting interface (Fig. 6a) and determined whether the purified mutant proteins inhibited HKU1 virus infection of primary HTBE cells. All mutant proteins were bound to conformational antibodies the mHKUS-4 and mHKUS-6 ( Fig. 6a) , indicating that the mutations have a minimal effect on the protein conformation. While the majority of mutations showed no effect on the inhibition of HKU1 virus infection on primary HTBE cells by 1A-S310-677aa, substitution of W515 or R517 with Ala almost abolished inhibition (Fig. 6b,c) , indicating that W515 and R517 are critical for binding of 1A-S310-677aa to the unknown receptor. Of note, both W515 and R517 are located in a groove adjacent to the tip. Furthermore, most residues constituting the groove (Supplementary Fig. 4) , including E505, W515, R517, C518, S519, S520, L521 and Y528, are conserved. The groove is B11 Å long, 10 Å wide and 4 Å deep, with a solvent accessible area of 779 Å 2 . Its size suggests that the groove should be able to accommodate a sugar moiety or amino acid side chains, and therefore may function as a major receptor binding motif.
