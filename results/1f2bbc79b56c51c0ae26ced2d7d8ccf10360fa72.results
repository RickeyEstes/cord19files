2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphate cDNA synthesis and Illumina sequencing methods RNase L, RNase A and other metal-ion-independent endoribonucleases target single-stranded regions of RNA, leaving 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphates at the end of RNA fragments (Table 1) . We exploited the 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphates at RNA cleavage sites to make cDNA libraries suitable for Illumina sequencing (Supplementary Figure S1 ).
