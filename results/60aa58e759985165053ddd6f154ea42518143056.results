A total of 1032 subjects were recruited. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity at different distances between ear drum and thermoguard (Tables  1 and 2 ). Sensitivity of ear drum and thermoguard at 0 m was 13%, specificity was 95%, and positive predictive value was 44%. At a distance of 5 m, the sensitivity of ear drum and thermoguard was 45%, specificity was 70% and positive predictive value was 29%. At a distance of 10 m, the sensitivity of ear drum and thermoguard was 57%, specificity was 85% and positive predictive value was 39%. The estimated sensitivity and specificity at different distances for ear drum and DITI are also shown in Tables 1 and 2 . At a distance of 0 m, the sensitivity of ear drum and DITI in lateral view was 32%, specificity was 89% and positive predictive value was 47%. At a distance of 5 m, the sensitivity of ear drum and DITI was 40%, specificity was 77% and positive predictive value was 33%. At a distance of 10 m, the sensitivity of ear drum and DITI was 24%, specificity was 93% and positive predictive value was 36%. Finally, at a distance of 0 m, the sensitivity of ear drum and DITI in frontal view was 15%, specificity was 95% and positive predictive value was 50%. At a distance of 5 m, the sensitivity of ear drum and DITI was 29%, specificity was 87% and positive predictive value was 40%. At a distance of 10 m, the sensitivity of ear drum and DITI was 23%, specificity was 94% and positive predictive value was 41%.
