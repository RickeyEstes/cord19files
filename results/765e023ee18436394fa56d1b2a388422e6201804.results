Protein deficiency produces failure to thrive in neonatal piglets. At 1 week of age, stunting (decreased or no weight gain) occurred in all of the pigs in the proteindeficient groups; at 2 weeks and thereafter, it was highly statistically significant for HIFM-transplanted HRV-inoculated pigs (Fig. 1) . Edema of the face, neck, feet, and abdominal area (commonly observed in human cases of kwashiorkor) developed at 10 days of age and persisted throughout the duration of the experiments in proteindeficient pigs but not in protein-sufficient pigs. Comparison of blood parameters at the termination of the experiment revealed that pigs on the protein-deficient diet had significantly decreased levels of glucose, total protein, and albumin (Fig. 2 , HIFM/HRVinfected pigs on deficient and sufficient diets; no-HRV/no-HIFM controls, data not shown), as seen in malnourished children (which develop because of malnutrition itself and malabsorption associated with malnutrition). However, these trends were opposite early after HRV inoculation (postinfection day 2 [PID2]) (data not shown). Additionally, serum vitamin A, vitamin E, and selenium levels were significantly increased at the end of the experiment in protein-deficient groups but not in protein-sufficient groups, suggestive of a positive "30-day response" (as seen in vitamin A-deficient children [17] ) to supplementation of these micronutrients in the diet. The mortality rate of the HIFM-transplanted piglets on a protein-sufficient diet (no HRV) did not exceed 14% (1 piglet/litter, on average), whereas the mortality rates of the HIFM-transplanted piglets (no HRV) on the protein-deficient diet ranged between 15 and 45% ( Table 1 ). The clinical signs in the affected piglets were consistent with hypoglycemia and septicemia in addition to extraintestinal (liver, kidney, lung, and peritoneal cavity swabs) recovery of Clostridium perfringens type A and nonhemolytic, avirulent Escherichia coli (bacterial identification to the species level was conducted at the Ohio Department of Agriculture). Early HRV infection results in adverse health effects and increases the mortality rate in neonatal HIFM-transplanted Gn pigs. In pilot experiments, to evaluate the effects of protein malnutrition on immune function and enteric infection, we infected pigs with HRV at 3 (early) and 10 (late) days after HIFM transplantation to evaluate protein malnutrition/HRV infection effects in the context of developing and established intestinal microbiomes, respectively. The neonatal pigs infected with HRV at 3 days after HIFM transplantation had poor health (weight loss, lethargy, neurological signs including ataxia, diarrhea, a moribund state, loss of appetite, and transient fever), high mortality rates (45 to 75%, Table 1 ), and enhanced HRV shedding/diarrhea, unlike pigs infected at 10 days after HIFM transplantation or germfree (GF) pigs (Fig. 3) . Although fecal HRV shedding was comparable at PID0 to PID2, it was higher in deficient pigs FIG 1 Normalized weight gain of protein-sufficient and -deficient pigs after HRV inoculation and HIFM transplantation monitored over a period of 4 weeks. The results are the mean Ϯ SEM from 10 to 27 animals in the deficient-and sufficient-diet HIFM/HRV groups (n ϭ 17 to 27 for early [prior to day of age 10] time points; n ϭ 10 for later time points), the results of the early and late HRV/HIFM groups were combined because there were no differences in the weights due to the timing of HRV infection; five or six animals in the deficient-and sufficient-diet HRV groups, and two or three animals in the deficient-and sufficient-diet HIFM groups. The results shown are the mean Ϯ SEM. Difference in stunting from the sufficient-diet counterpart (two-way ANOVA): *, significant (P Յ 0.05); **, highly significant (P Յ 0.01). thereafter following early HRV infection (Fig. 3A) . Similarly, diarrhea was more severe and persisted in deficient pigs through experiment termination at PID5 (Fig. 3A) . By PID5 after early HRV infection, most (75%) of the pigs died and the surviving ones failed to thrive or had recurrent fever or mild neurological symptoms, irrespective of the diet, and were euthanized. Comparison of early immunological parameters did not reveal consistent trends. Therefore, to avoid the adverse reactions and an excessively high mortality rate, all of the pigs in the subsequent experiments were inoculated with HRV at 10 days after HIFM transplantation. HRV infection (diarrhea, shedding) is more severe in protein-deficient piglets after late HRV inoculation. We conducted several trials to compare immune responses, HRV pathogenesis, and IEC gene expression in protein-sufficient and -deficient pigs after HRV inoculation at 10 days after HIFM transplantation. Additionally, we included groups of GF (no HIFM transplantation) pigs inoculated with HRV and HIFMtransplanted pigs without HRV inoculation on protein-sufficient and -deficient diets to The normal ranges of the levels of these elements in the plasma or serum of conventional suckling piglets are 44 to 91 mg/dl for glucose, 5.8 to 8.1 g/dl for protein, 3.2 to 4.2 g/dl for albumin, 100 to 350 ng/ml for vitamin A, 0.4 to 5 g/ml for vitamin E, and 50 to 150 ng/ml for selenium; however, the respective ranges in Gn pigs are not established. Concentrations were analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. The results shown are the mean Ϯ SEM. a Italics indicate that early HRV inoculation of HIFM-transplanted pigs resulted in mortality rates significantly higher (P ϭ 0.0001) than those of all of the other experimental groups, irrespective of the diet. Bold values indicate statistically significant higher (P ϭ 0.0002 to 0.0047) mortality rates of deficient-diet pigs than their sufficient-diet counterparts. evaluate HIFM/HRV contributions to clinical signs of malnutrition. The GF pigs on the protein-deficient diet became stunted compared to their sufficient-diet counterparts; however, stunting ( Fig. 1 ) and edema (by appearance) were less evident in GF pigs than in HIFM-transplanted protein-deficient pigs. HIFM-transplanted pigs on the proteindeficient diet but without HRV inoculation became stunted similarly to their HRVinfected counterparts (Fig. 1) . HRV shedding and diarrhea were increased in deficient-versus sufficient-diet pigs ( Fig. 3B and C). A significantly higher first peak of fecal HRV shedding was observed in deficient-diet HIFM pigs; however, they lacked the second peak of shedding present in the sufficient-diet group ( Fig. 3B and C). Additionally, while the diarrhea scores of GF pigs were higher, their HRV shedding titers were comparable to those of HIFMtransplanted pigs (Fig. 3) , suggesting that the commensal microbiota decreases the severity of HRV diarrhea. Protein deficiency affects the intestinal epithelial barrier. We compared the villus height to crypt depth (VH/CD) ratios of piglets on sufficient and deficient diets with or without HRV infection or HIFM transplantation (Fig. 4) . A deficient diet resulted in a decreased villus length in pigs in different groups that was least pronounced in noninfected pigs, suggestive of additive or synergistic effects between the diet and HRV infection in altering the intestinal morphology. Additionally, we observed extensive epithelial vacuolization in nontransplanted compared to HIFM-transplanted pigs, irrespective of the diet (Fig. 4) . To further assess the epithelial barrier integrity of pigs in different experimental groups, we compared villin expression by IECs. Consistent with the above, the latter was higher in sufficient pigs and decreased in deficient pigs (Fig. 5 ). Finally, we measured serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels (at the termination of the experiment) to evaluate the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium. The results demonstrated that serum LPS levels were significantly higher in proteindeficient (HIFM/HRV) pigs (Fig. 6) . Protein deficiency differentially affects SOX9, CgA, MUC2, villin, and PCNA gene mRNA levels of IECs. SOX9 (expressed by IESCs), MUC2 (expressed by goblet cells), villin (expressed by enterocytes), PCNA (expressed by transient amplifying progenitor cells), and CgA (expressed by enteroendocrine cells) gene mRNA levels were lower in jejunal IECs of protein-deficient pigs than in those of sufficient HIFM/HRVinfected pigs, as demonstrated by quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR (Fig. 7A) . However, only MUC2 and villin mRNA levels were lower in protein-deficient pigs than in protein-sufficient non-HRV-inoculated pigs, while CgA, PCNA, and SOX9 mRNA levels were higher (Fig. 7B) . Also, HRV-infected, protein-deficient GF pigs had lower levels of mRNAs of all IEC markers than HRV-infected protein-sufficient pigs, with the exception of CgA mRNA levels, which were higher (Fig. 7C ). An additional observation provided by comparison of the mRNA levels of these genes in IECs of HIFM-transplanted and GF pigs inoculated with HRV on protein-deficient and -sufficient diets was that HIFM transplantation resulted in higher villin and PCNA mRNA levels ( Fig. 8A and B) . Protein deficiency results in uniform suppression of several innate immune parameters. A number of immune parameters (previously identified by us and others as key immune factors in anti-HRV responses) were evaluated at experiment termination (posttransplantation day 28 [PTD28]/PID14) in protein-deficient and -sufficient HIFM/HRV-infected pigs. Protein deficiency decreased the frequencies of natural killer (NK) cells among intestinal (significantly) and splenic (numerically) mononuclear cells (MNCs) and significantly decreased the NK function of splenic MNCs (Fig. 9) . Similarly, frequencies of intestinal plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and CD103 ϩ MNCs were significantly lower in protein-deficient pigs than in protein-sufficient pigs. Finally, the frequencies of apoptotic MNCs were also lower in all of the tissues of protein-deficient pigs (Fig. 10) . Although there was a trend for increased levels of most innate cytokines evaluated in serum samples at different time points (data not shown), only IL-12 p40 (referred to as IL-12 throughout) levels were consistently higher in serum samples from protein-sufficient pigs than in those from protein-deficient pigs throughout the dura- Evaluation of VH/CD ratios of ileal villi of protein-deficient (A to D) and -sufficient (A and E to G) pigs by H&E staining. Ileal sections of pigs euthanized at PID14/PTD24 were evaluated. Mean VH/CD ratios of different groups are shown in the graph in panel A (n ϭ 2 or 3 for sufficient-and deficient-diet HIFM or HRV-infected pigs, and n ϭ 5 to 10 for sufficient-and deficient-diet HIFM or HRV-infected pigs), and representative images for deficient-and sufficient-diet HIFM/HRV, deficient-and sufficient-diet HRV, and deficient-and sufficient-diet HIFM groups are shown in panels B and E, C and F, and D and G, respectively. The results shown are the mean Ϯ SEM. P Ͻ 0.05 was considered statistically significant by the Mann-Whitney test. tion of the experiment (Fig. 11 ). No differences in the levels of Toll-like receptor expression by MNCs were noted in any tissues of protein-sufficient or -deficient pigs (data not shown). Similar trends, but without statistically significant differences, were observed in the above immune parameters of control pigs (no HRV or no HIFM).
