A total of 43,015 cases and 43,015 matched controls were identified, with Table 1 showing their baseline characteristics. Hypertension, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and drug abuse were more prevalent among cases than among controls. peripheral vascular disease, and metabolic, ranging from each complication. Each complication produced a numeric score ranging from 0 to 2 (0 = no abnormality, 1 = some abnormality, 2 = severe abnormality). Table 2 presents the crude and adjusted ORs for the development of sepsis requiring hospitalization (cases) in association with OAD use compared with controls, after adjusting for all potential confounders in Table 1 . Metformin use was associated with decreased odds of developing sepsis (adjusted OR 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.83, P < 0.001), whereas sulfonylurea (adjusted OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10, P = 0.001) and meglitinide (adjusted OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.25-1.40, P < 0.001) use were associated with increased odds of developing sepsis ( The comparisons of metformin-based combined therapy versus metformin alone on the risk of sepsis are summarized in Table 3 . A decreased risk of sepsis was consistently observed in patients taking metformin alone (adjusted OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.62-0.68) and metformin-based combination therapy with sulfonylureas (adjusted OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.69-0.75), TZDs (adjusted OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.41-0.64), DPP-4 inhibitors (adjusted OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.55-0.78), or meglitinides (adjusted OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.96).
