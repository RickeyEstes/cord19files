The number of patients referred to CATH steadily increased during the observation period, rising from 3216 in 1998 to 5619 in 2007. In addition, patient demographics and clinical characteristics have changed considerably, including increases in the proportion of patients over 75 years old, those with diabetes, and those presenting with a previous myocardial infarction (MI). Both the number of scheduled hours of operation each day and the number of cases performed annually increased steadily, more than doubling in 2007 as compared to 1997. This data are presented in Table 1 . The number of patients awaiting CATH at the end of each month was averaged for each year during the observation period. Overall, there was a steady decline in the number of patients awaiting CATH, though there were occasional increases from one year to the next. These data are presented in Fig. 1 . The greatest magnitude of decline in the mean number of patients waiting was from 626 in 2003 to 378 in 2004 (difference: 248; 39.6% decrease). This was due to a combination of factors that will be discussed below. The greatest relative decrease in the mean number of patients awaiting CATH was from 317 to 178 (difference: 139; 43.8% decrease) in 2005 (the point in which the 4th laboratory was implemented). The proportion of inpatients (urgent) and outpatients (semi-urgent) that underwent a procedure within the RMWT each year is presented in Figs. 2 and 3. Compared to the previous year, the proportion of outpatients undergoing a procedure within the RMWT increased in 1999 after expansion to a third laboratory (15-26%, p < 0.0001). Similarly, improvements were seen after the increase in hours of operation from 30 to 36 h in 2004 (19.5-34.1%, p < 0.0001), and expansion to a 4th laboratory in 2005 (34.1-53.7%, p < 0.0001). Greater than 80% of outpatients underwent a procedure within the RMWT of 28 days once the realized capacity of the 4th laboratory developed. Increases in the proportion of inpatients undergoing a procedure within the RMWT coincided with increases in hours of operation in 1998 (39-62%, p < 0.0001) and 2004 (68-82%, p < 0.0001). Again, the addition of the third and 4th laboratories improved access for inpatients (62-76%, 1997  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007   Cases  3571  3924  4746  5105  5172  6046  6512  7037  7482  8262  8056  Lab hours/day  18  24  26  26  26  26  30  36  40  40  40  Patients  604 a  3216  3543  3908  3526  4338  4071  4712  4942  5577 opening of the 4th laboratory (mean 20.6 days, SD 20.5; 75% within 24 days of referral). A mean wait time within the RMWT range for inpatients (urgent cases) was achieved with the expansion of laboratory hours from an average of 30-36 h/day in 2004, though the greatest improvement was seen after the 4th laboratory opened (decreasing mean wait time from 6.6 to 4 days).
