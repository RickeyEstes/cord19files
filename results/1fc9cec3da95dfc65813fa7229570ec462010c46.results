During the study period, 4779 hospitalized patients were included; 2349 patients tested with non-mPCR assays and 2430 tested with mPCR ( Figure 1 ; available at www.jpeds. com). Subjects tested with mPCR were older, more likely to have a complex chronic condition, or be admitted to the PICU during their hospitalization (Table III) . Test positivity was higher in the mPCR group compared with the non-mPCR group (42.4% vs 14.4%, P < .01) (Figure 2 ; available at www.jpeds.com). Rates of RSV (8.7% vs 9.3%, P = .49) and influenza (2.6% vs 3.6%, P = .03) were similar in the 2 groups.
