Our initial search identified 3950 records. After exclusion of duplicates, 2151 records were screened by title and abstract. Two hundred and sixty-five full-text articles/reports were retrieved and reviewed and cross-references yielded an additional 2 cases. The total number of travelassociated CCHF cases identified was 21 ( Fig. 1) . We found two types of travel-related CCHF case: i) Those acquiring the disease during travel to CCHF endemic countries; ii) Residents in endemic countries acquiring the disease and then travelling and crossing borders to seek healthcare. The data on cases identified in these groups are summarized in Table 1 [16e28]. (Data on cases travelling from Afghanistan to Pakistan are reported separately in Table 2 due to limited detail reported on risk factors, outcome and method of laboratory confirmation) [29e36]. The source and importation country were as follows: Africa to Africa in 5 cases (Zaire to South Africa, Tanzania to South Africa, South Sudan to Uganda, and two cases from Namibia to South Africa) and Europe to Europe in 2 cases (Bulgaria to the UK and to Germany). In 3 cases, the disease was imported from Africa to Europe (Senegal to France [2] , and Zimbabwe to the UK), and in 2 cases, Asia to Europe (Afghanistan to the UK and to Germany). In 9 cases (Table  2) , the source of the infection was Asia to Asia from Afghanistan to Pakistan (Fig. 2) . Risk occupations or activities for CCHF infection were reported in 7/21 cases. Although the occupation or reason for travel was not reported in some cases, tick bite, contact with wild life, animal exposure, animal handling and slaughtering were reported as risk factors for transmission of the virus. Among the 21 cases identified, 12 died, 7 survived and the outcome for 3 was not reported. Two cases resulted in secondary (nosocomial) infections to a total of 4 HCWS. Travel related cases only identified in ProMED mail include 1 from South Sudan to Uganda [26] , two from Namibia to South Africa [27] and 9 from Afghanistan to Pakistan [29e36].
