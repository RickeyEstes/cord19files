To uncover the selective role diseases could have exerted on the MBL2 polymorphism, we evaluated the MBL2 promoter and exon 1 region from 856 chromosomes of Gabonese adults (this work) and children [2] , as well as from 470 chromosomes belonging to individuals of European descent, and compared it with previously published data. Genotype frequencies were at Hardy and Weinberg equilibrium. MBL2 haplotypes identified in this study are listed in Table 1 . They were named according to their evolutionary divergence [17] from a hypothetical ancient sequence probably related to LYQA and LYPA [11, 18] . According to the nomenclature system we adopted, the first clades to diverge are numbered with Arabic numerals. The 26 identified haplotypes are divided into two major phylogenetic branches by six polymorphisms (P1, Q1 or g.396A >C; P2, Q2 or g.474A >G; P3, Q3 or g.487A >G; P4, Q4 or g.495_500del6; P5, Q5 or g.753C >T, all in strong linkage disequilibrium with the commonly investigated P6, Q6 polymorphism or g.826C >T) ( Figure 1 ). Clade *1 is represented by LYPA and other haplotypes with P variants. Clade *4 is represented by LYQA and other haplotypes with Q variants. Other clades are represented by the intermediate rare haplotypes previously found by our group in Gabon (2 and 3) [2] . Sublineages of each clade are subsequently designated with capital letters (e.g. LYQA-derived haplotypes = *4A and LYQC-derived haplotypes = *4F), and individual present-day haplotypes are given Arabic numerals (e.g. LYQA = *4A1), following the schema numerals/letters/numerals, if they diverge further (e.g. the LYQC-derived haplotype with the g.797C >A SNP, associated with severe malaria = *4F2A). This system is flexible enough for the accommodation of new haplotypes. For example, we added the LYPA-similar haplotypes H16 and H19 found by others exclusively in Pygmy populations [19] as *1K1 and *1L1, and added the HYPG haplotype described by us in another study [16] , as 1B4. It is however not suited for recombinant haplotypes. In this case, we chose to call them by the names of the parental haplotypes, separated by a dot. LYPD for example is most probably the product of a recent intragenic recombination event between HYPD (*1B2) and LYPA (*1A1) or LYPB (*1F1) [20] . Since the recombination between HYPD and LYPB would have generated HYPB, which has not been found, we arbitrarily chose to call this haplotype *1A1.1B2 (equivalent to LYPA Ã— HYPD). We also wished to incorporate reported associations of haplotypes with MBL concentration. In order to do this, we added a dash followed by small capitalized "h" or "l" letters, referring to "high" or "low" MBL levels in serum, respectively (e.g. LYQA = *4A1-h). We identified in this and in other studies 14 haplotypes belonging to clade *1 and 9 haplotypes belonging to clade *4 and added data from others for comparison ( Table 2) . Eight of the first 14 and 6 of the last 9 haplotypes were polymorph in at least one population. Among the rare haplotypes, we found three previously unknown in the European population: *1B3, a rare HYPA-similar haplotype; *1C2, the only LXPA-similar haplotype; and *4C1-h, a LYQA-similar haplotype with a g.456G >T SNP found in three heterozygotes (the first two haplotypes were singletons). The g.456G >T SNP was assigned by others to an otherwise HYPA haplotype reconstructed from unphased genotypic data of one Sardinian heterozygote [19] . Maximum likelihood phasing of our own data with the EM and ELB algorithms generated 1-2% erroneously assembled haplotypes in the Gabonese and European samples. Only in the Gabonese, seven spurious "new" haplotypes were generated with the EM and eleven with the ELB algorithm (Table 3) . To verify the effect of sample size in frequency estimates, we compared the haplotype distribution between some populations investigated by us and by others [19] . Although there were no significant differences with the exact population differentiation test, differences between individual haplotype frequencies were significant, even between samples with similar ancestry (Table 2) . With the exception of LYQA (*4A1-h), *4 haplotypes are well represented only in the African population. In contrast, HYPA (*1B1-h) and LYPB (*1F1-l) are among the *1 haplotypes that reach high frequencies in the European, Asian and Native American, but not in the African population ( Figure 2 ). The uneven haplotype distribution around the world is reflected by the average Fst value among all segregating sites (0.1831, P < 0.00001), which indicate great genetic differentiation between the analysed populations. One of the lowest individual significant Fst values corresponded to the X/Y SNP, whereas the highest values corresponded to the H, L and P, Q segre-  The positions corresponding to the SNPs and to the deletion (position of the first deleted nucleotide) are shown in the first row (Reference sequence: Y16577). Haplotype nomenclature was given according to others [17] . The common nomenclature of formerly known SNPs and haplotypes (excluding LYPF and LYQE), is given in parentheses. *1B3, *1C2 and *1F2 were not investigated for MBL concentration, and thus did not receive the designation "l" (for low MBL levels) or "h" (for high levels). For all other haplotypes, MBL levels have been reported by us and by others [2, 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . In gray: coding region of exon 1.

The time to the most recent common ancestor of the MBL2 alleles was inferred at 73,251 years ago [95% CI 5,220 -214,440]. The mean coalescence time implies that the ancestor of groups *1 and *4 alleles were separated before the modern human dispersal from Africa [21] . The TMRCA of groups *1 and *4 was estimated to be ca. 55,000 years ago, which also indicates that the presence of alleles of African populations in both clades is a result of an ancient ancestry. *1B-derived haplotypes, even those found using maximum-likelihood phasing by others [19] , seem to be restricted to Euroasiatic populations. Beyond those described in this work, we recently identified *1B4 in the Euro-Brazilian population. This haplotype is similar to HYPA but with a synonymous substitution in codon 44 (also called HYPG) [16] . To our knowledge, LXPA (*1C1l) has only one rare similar haplotype (*1C2), identified in one European individual. We also found only one LYPBsimilar haplotype (*1F2), but others cite another four [19] . Each occur with frequencies around 2% in Asian/ Amerindian groups (Ashkenazi Jewish, Japanese, Chinese and Kaingang), but three were defined by SNPs upstream to the region analysed in this study. The *1H1-h haplotype has a similar global distribution as the commonly investigated haplotypes and is well represented in African, Asian and Amerindian(-derived) populations, being less frequent in European groups. We found a similar haplotype (*1H2-h) once in a Gabonese and once in a Euro-Brazilian individual. All other clade *1 haplotypes are concentrated in African groups. *1E1-h has a rare coding mutation found only once in the Gabonese, as *1G1-h [2] . The *1D1-h haplotype, which we found with 3% frequency in this population, was found by others with comparable frequencies (1.6 -4.2%) in the Mbuti Pygmy, Nigerian Yoruba and Somali populations [19] . *1J1-h was also found with 1.6% and 0.8% frequencies in Tanzanian Chagga and in the Somali groups, respectively. *2A1-h and *3A1-h are intermediate between P and Q containing haplotypes and most probably reminiscent of the ancient original MBL2 haplotype [2] . The LYQA-similar *4B1-l haplotype carries a coding mutation and was found only once in the Gabonese, as the LYQC-similar haplotype *4F2B-l. In addition to the Gabonese, *4D1-h was found by others with 1.6% frequencies in the Tanzanian Chagga [19] . *4E1-h has a SNP within a glucocorticoid responsive element and seems to be well distributed in Africa, except in the Mbuti and Baka Pygmies [19] . 4F2A-l was formerly found associated with severe malaria [2] and has a similar distribution, except for the fact that it is also present in South-West Asian and European(derived) groups with 11.9% (Ashkenazi Jewish [19] ) to 0.5% (Germans, this work) frequencies. *4F3-l was also found in the Biaka Pygmy (2.1%), Nigerian Yoruba (1.6%) and Tanzanian Chagga (4.7%) groups [19] , as well as in Afro-Americans [18] and in one individual of the Kaingang Amerindian population, known to be of mixed ancestry [22] . Tajima's D was significant in those regions containing five of the six P, Q segregating sites in the Gabonese population ( Figure 4A ). Yet Fu and Li's D* was significant in regions with rare SNPs: the LXPA-derived *1C2 haplotype in Europeans and the LYPA-derived *1E1-h haplotype in the Gabonese (also called LYPF due to a nonsynonymous SNP in the exon 1 region) ( Figure 4B ). Highest nucleotide diversity was registered in the same windows with Tajima's D peaks ( Figure 4C ). None of the neutrality tests employed for the whole sequence or parts of it yielded significant results (Table 4 ).
