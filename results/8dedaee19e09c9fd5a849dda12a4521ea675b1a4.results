Seven (17.9%) patients were females and 32 (82.1%) were males. The ages of the patients ranged between 2 and 66 years and the average age was 17.03 ± 16.01 (CI 95%). Twenty nine (74.4%) were children (ranging between 2 -16 years of age). Thirty two patients (82.1%) had no history of medical disease or smoking habit. However, 6 patients (12.8%) were smokers, one had history of hypertension, and one child (2 years old) had asthma history. Patient characteristics according to age groups are shown in Table 1 . The presenting symptoms were mostly associated with one another, including; cough (alone) (n = 7, 17.9%), cough and nausea (n = 5, 12.8%), cough and dyspnea (n = 5, 12.8%), and different associations of these with chest tightness, burning in eyes and in throat, conjunctival hyperemia, weakness and vomiting symptoms were found in 27 (69.2%) patients respectively. Cough and dyspnea were the most prevalent complaints among the patients and were seen in 64.1% and 30.8% of the patients respectively, in total. Twelve patients (30.8%) had no evident symptoms. In physical examination 25 patients (64.1%) were normal. Tachypnea was the dominant sign with 35.9% among the patients. Regarding the laboratory findings, 11 (28.2%) patients were assessed by CXR, 10 (25.6%) were assessed by ECG and 17 (43.6%) were assessed by ABG analyses. Most patients did not have an ECG, ABG or CXR performed. These tests were considered unnecessary for the patients who appeared well. Only one patient (2.6%) who used to be a smoker, showed pathologic findings in his chest radiograph (hyper-aeration, decrease in cardio-thoracic ratio, elevated diffuse reticular density). No ECG pathology was detected and 11 (28.2%) of ABG analyzes were abnormal. Eight (20.5%) patients, whose ABG analyzes were assessed as abnormal, had hypoxia. Four of these 8 patients were in the third group. Of these patients, one (2.6%) had respiratory alkalosis, while the rest three (7.7%) had hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis. The authors did not need to perform decontamination to any patient because chlorine is a volatile gas and there were no severe eye or skin contaminations in our series. No patients received nebulized sodium bicarbonate therapy. Among the patients who were evaluated in EDs, 24 (61.5%) patients were in the first group and they were discharged after initial examination and symptomatic treatment except 3 patients who refused any treatment except normal saline. Seven (17.8%) of the rest 21 patients in the first group received only humidified oxygen and metyl-prednisolone. Other 14 (36%) patients in the first group who accepted treatment were initially treated with supplemental humidified oxygen (via nasal canulla or mask), various combinations and doses of parenteral fluids (e.g. normal saline, 0.45 % saline + 5 % dextrose, and Isolyte P ® ), and metyl-prednisolone (1mg/kg, intravenously). Of these 14 patients, 2 received metoclopramide (alone, intravenously), 3 received ranitidine (alone, intravenously) another 3 received ranitidine and metoclopramide combination (intravenously), appropriately, in addition to the initial treatment. Nine (23.1%) patients were in the second group. In this group one patient received only humidified oxygen and metyl-prednisolone. Three patients were initially treated in the same way with the first group. In this group, in addition to initial treatment, one patient received inhaler salbutamol, 2 patients received ranitidine, and one patient received metoclopramide plus ranitidine and inhaler salbutamol combination. Another patient received initial treatment plus metoclopramide plus ranitidine and inhaler salbutamol combination and wide spectrum antibiotic (intravenously). They were all observed and discharged in 24 hours after application to ED. There were 6 (15.4%) patients in the third group who were severely exposed were hospitalized; 2 patients were admitted to the adult intensive care unit, 3 patients to the pediatric intensive care unite and 1 patient to the pulmonary medicine department. No patient was diagnosed as bronchitis, ARDS and/or acute lung edema. Invasive or non invasive airway support (as intubations, CPAP or BIPAP) was not necessary. All the patients in this group were initially treated as in the first group. Metoclopramide, ranitidine, inhaler salbutamol and antibiotic measure combination were also used appropriately. Only one patient received teophyline measure in addition to this combination. No patients died.
