The study led to the development of the "Contact Tracing-Risk Assessment Profile" (CT-RAP), an interactive decision making instrument, taking into account pathogen specific as well as situation specific criteria. This report describes the methodology of this decision making instrument and presents two examples of ready to use CT-RAP for tuberculosis and for meningococcal disease in public ground transport.
