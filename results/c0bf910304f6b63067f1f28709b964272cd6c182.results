Experimental estimation of FS. We first compiled an experimental dataset of FS values using the established in vitro approaches 19, 20 (see the "Methods" section). We used the dnaX mRNA fragment encoding the slippery sequence Lys 1 Lys 2 flanked by an upstream SD-like sequence and a downstream stem-loop structure. We generated all possible mutant variants that encoded for combinations of either Lys or Phe codons in the 0-frame ( Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1a , and Supplementary Table 1 ). 70S ribosomes programmed with dnaX mRNA and carrying the initiator f[ 3 H]Met-tRNA fMet in the P site were mixed with aminoacyl-tRNAs that are required to translate the mRNA up to the frameshifting site (one of which is [ 14 C]-labeled) and elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G. Translation products of the 0-frame and −1-frame were separated by reversed-phase highperformance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and quantified by scintillation counting (Supplementary Fig. 1b) . FS was calculated as a ratio of the −1-frame product to the sum of 0-frame and −1-frame peptides (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Figs We first validated that mutations in the slippery sequence do not alter the mechanism of frameshifting using the codon-walk approach 20 . Previous results indicated that the rate of Lys 1 and Lys 2 incorporation on slippery codons AAA 4 and AAG 7 is independent of the slippage-inducing mRNA stem-loop, whereas incorporation of the subsequent Phe (F) is delayed 20-fold by the stem-loop 20 . This indicated that the ribosome is stalled after the incorporation of Lys 2 on the AAG 7 codon and that frameshifting takes place during the delayed translocation. The incorporation of Val in the −1 frame is very efficient compared to the 0-frame Phe and the FS calculated from the ratio of the rate constants of −1 frame to 0-frame Val and Phe incorporation, respectively, is consistent with the end-point measurements ( Supplementary  Fig. 1b) . To test whether the branch point of frameshifting is the same on other slippery site variants, in particular those where frameshifting involves non-Watson-Crick codon-anticodon interactions in the −1-frame, we determined the rates of frameshifting for three slippery sequence variants, A 1 G, A 1 U, and A 4 G. With these mRNAs, the presence of the downstream stem-loop did not affect the incorporation rate for Lys 2 , but reduced the rate of the 0-frame Phe incorporation. Another observation suggesting that frameshifting takes place at the translocation step is that with the wild-type dnaX sequence, the presence or absence of tRNAs decoding the Phe (0-frame) or Val (−1-frame) codons downstream the slippery sequence does not change the FS. This indicates that the commitment to the new reading frame occurs before the Val or Phe codon is available for decoding in the A site, that is at the preceding translocation step 20 . Similarly, for the A 1 G, A 1 U and A 4 G variants the incorporation efficiency is not affected by the presence of Val-tRNA and Phe-tRNA encoding the overlapping (G UUC) codons ( Supplementary Figs. 2b, c and 3b ). For the A 4 G construct, if tRNA slippage occurred on the first codon (AAG 4 ) while the second codon was free, the second codon would be decoded in the −1-frame (G 4 AA) by Glu-tRNA Glu , resulting in a MAKE peptide. However, in the presence of Glu-tRNA Glu , the MAKK peptide is still predominant ( Supplementary Fig. 3b ), indicating that slippage takes place after the decoding of the second codon by tRNA Lys . In the presence of all aa-tRNAs, we observe only about 5% of the frameshifting peptide containing Glu (MAKEV) ( Supplementary Fig. 3d ), rendering an alternative frameshift pathway, e.g., stimulated by aa-tRNA depletion, unlikely under given conditions. We then replaced the wild-type dnaX slippery Lys 1 Lys 2 codons with all possible sequences that encode synonymous Lys (AAA/ G) or Phe (UUU/C) codons: tRNA Lys and tRNA Lys , tRNA Phe and tRNA Phe , tRNA Lys and tRNA Phe , or tRNA Phe and tRNA Lys (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1 ). For all codons in the 0-frame of these sequences, base pairs in the first and second positions of the codon-anticodon complex are only Watson-Crick base pairs, whereas in the third position Watson-Crick and wobble basepairs are tolerated 27, 32 . The FS of the wild-type slippery sequence is about 80%, consistent with the previous reports in vivo and in vitro 16, 20, 25, 26 . Several slippery-sequence variants also support efficient frameshifting, whereas others diminish frameshifting considerably. Notably, for sequences that have exactly the same codons in the 0-frame and −1-frame (A 1 AAA 4 AAA 7 and U 1 UUU 4 UUU 7 ) the FS is very close to 50% (Fig. 1b) , suggesting that the 0-frame and −1-frames are equally possible at these conditions, i.e., the ribosome is not inherently committed to maintaining the 0-frame. The FS was high not only with the sequences where −1PRF resulted in canonical Watson-Crick base pairs in the −1 reading frame, but also in several cases with the expected first position mismatch on one of the slippery codons, such as for C/U/G 1 AAA 4 AAA 7 , A 1 AAG 4 AAA/G 7 , A/C/ G 1 UUU 4 UUU 7 , A 1 AAG 4 UUU 7 or U 1 UUU 4 AAG 7 (the −1frame codon is underlined). Even with two first position mismatches, such as with G/C 1 AAG 4 AAG 7 the FS is 8-9%, well over the minimum FS value of about 2% found for this tRNA pair on the C 1 AAG 4 AAA 7 sequence. Free-energy model of −1PRF. Upon frameshifting, the mRNA-tRNA base pairs change depending on the slippery sequence (Fig. 1a) . We asked whether the FSs can be explained by differences in the interaction free-energy between the base pairs involved in the 0-frame and −1-frame duplex. If all individual base-pair free-energy differences ΔG bp were known, and assuming thermodynamic equilibration during the frameshifting, the FS a b Lys-Lys Table 1) of a given mRNA sequence could be calculated from the total free-energy difference ΔG for all anticodon-codon positions in the 0-frame and −1-frame, FS = exp(−ΔG/(k B T))/[1 + exp (−ΔG/(k B T))] with Boltzmann factor k B and temperature T = 310 K. However, initially we face the inverse problem, as the FS values were known from experiments ( Fig. 1b) , whereas the basepair free-energy differences were unknown. To tackle this inverse problem, we used Bayesian statistics to obtain the individual freeenergy differences that best fit all measured FSs (see the "Methods" section). The ribosome provides structurally different environments for the mRNA-tRNA interactions at the first and the second slippery codons, which likely has an effect on the base-pair free energy 27, [33] [34] [35] . To take into account this effect of the different environments on the base-pair free energies ΔG bp , we used 16 ΔG bp variables for all base-pair changes at all position of each codon, of which the 14 ΔG bp variables turned out to be independent. Although frameshifting occurs in the intermediate state of translocation, most likely in the ap/P-pe/E chimeric hybrid state 22 , for ease of notation we indicate the interactions for the first and second codon as P and A, respectively. The position of a base pair (X·Y) within the codon is indicated by a number (1, 2, 3) and the first base (X) denotes the codon base and the second the anticodon base (Y). First, we tested whether the free-energy model with the underlying assumptions and the set of parameters is able to reproduce the measured FS values. To that end, we used all 64 measured FS values (Fig. 1b) to obtain base-pair free-energy differences for 10 single base-pair changes in the P site (Fig. 2a) and in the A site (Fig. 2b) . The remaining six base-pair changes only occur in pairs in the sequences used here (Fig. 2c ). For these changes, we obtained the free-energy differences of changing two base pairs at the same time. Positive free-energy differences indicate that the free energy of base pairing in the −1-frame is larger than in the 0-frame, i.e., that base pairing in the −1-frame is less favorable than in the 0-frame. Accordingly, the larger free energy of the −1 frame renders frameshifting less likely, and thus FS < 50% is expected. Next, we calculated distributions of FS values (FS model ) from the obtained distributions of the free-energy differences using the ratio of Boltzmann distributions shown above (see the "Methods" section). Despite the fact that our model only contains 14 free parameters, the calculated efficiencies agree well with the measured efficiencies with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 2.5% between the mean FS model and the FS experiment (Fig. 2d ). Second, we tested if the free-energy model is also able to predict FS values for mRNA variants that were not used to obtain the free-energy differences. To this aim, we omitted one mRNA variant from the dataset and derived a new free-energy model in terms of a complete set of free-energy differences. This set was subsequently used to predict the efficiency of the omitted variant. We repeated this cross-validation procedure for each mRNA variant and good agreement with the measured efficiences was seen (Fig. 2e , rmsd 4.1%), underscoring that the model is indeed predictive. One critical assumption underlying our thermodynamic equilibrium model is that the FS is determined only by the free-energy difference of tRNA binding in −1-frame vs. 0-frame. This is only possible if frameshifting is significantly faster than the completion of translocation. In such a case, the kinetic  Inferred mRNA-tRNA base-pair free-energy differences on the ribosome during frameshifting. a Probability densities (colored histograms) of the free-energy differences ΔG bp for the P-site base pairs obtained from the model based on the full FS data set (64 FS values, blue), and a set of the FS values measured in vivo by Tsuchihashi et al. 26 (21 FS values, green) . b Probability densities for changing A-site base pairs. c Probability densities for changing P-site and A-site base pairs simultaneously. d FS from experiment compared to that calculated from the free-energy model. Each panel shows FS values for a tRNA pair (rmsd 2.5%). e For cross-validation of the model, iteratively, each FS value was predicted using free-energy differences obtained from all other FS values (rmsd 4.1%). For each mRNA sequence, one square is centered at the mean value and the width and height correspond to two times the standard deviation partitioning between frameshifting and translocation would be negligible and the probability of the ribosome to switch into −1frame would be predominantly thermodynamically controlled. This assumption is plausible, because translocation is slowed down considerably by the mRNA stem-loop, but as the elemental rate of tRNA slippage is not known, the extent to which frameshifting is affected by kinetics is unclear. To challenge this assumption, we included a kinetic factor κ into our model such that FS kinetic = FS · (1−κ), where FS is obtained from the ratio of Boltzmann distributions (see the "Methods" section; Fig. 3a ). For the kinetic factor, we assumed that a free-energy barrier limits the rate of tRNA slippage from the 0-frame to the −1-frame and back, i.e. the slippage is slower than translocation. The mean kinetic factor for all mRNA variants was included within our Bayesian approach as a nuisance parameter. Similar as above, the probability of base-pair free-energy differences was obtained for all 64 sequences, now additionally including κ. The resulting rmsd value (2.5%) is similar to that from the model without the kinetic contribution. Further, the most probable mean kinetic factor κ was found to be below 0.1% (Fig. 3b) , which indicates that the kinetics of frameshifting does not markedly affect the FS in this experimental system. Independent estimations of frameshiting kinetics suggest that the rate of slippage into −1-frame is 10 s −1 on the original dnaX slippery sequence and 3 s −1 on the A 4 G sequence (B.-Z. Peng, L. V. Bock, R. Bellardinelli, F. Peske, H. Grubmüller, and M. V. Rodnina, unpublished data). In comparison, the step that limits the completion of translocation was estimated to 0.1-0.5 s −1 (refs. 19, 20 ) . This supports the notion that, with the frameshifting secondary structure element on the mRNA, completion of translation is sufficiently slow to allow the tRNAs to re-pair with their thermodynamically favored codons. In summary, these results show that the FS values are consistent with-and can even be predicted by-a thermodynamic model that is based on only two assumptions, (1) that all FS values are determined solely by the free-energy differences between the 0-frame and −1-frame and (2) that the total freeenergy difference is the sum of the individual free-energy differences for each mRNA-tRNA base-pair change upon frameshifting, i.e., that the coupling of free-energy changes of base pairs is small. Free-energy model applied to an independent dataset. Tsuchihashi et al. reported a large set of FS values for 23 variants of the dnaX mRNA in vivo 26 , which enabled us to test the freeenergy model of frameshifting against an independent dataset. The alternative dataset by Sharma et al. 36 could not be used, as the values for FS on the native dnaX slippery sequence are inconsistent with those of refs. 20, 26 , thereby precluding meaningful comparisons. We used 21 FS values from the Tsuchihashi dataset (Supplementary Table 3 ) to obtain probabilities for freeenergy differences, excluding the G 7 A variant, which was considered unreliable by the authors due to the possibility of transcriptional slippage 26 , and the 123C variant which encodes a proline and may reflect proline-specific stalling effects 37 . The 21 mRNA variants not only include seven variants that have been tested in this work, but also sequences that do not preserve the Lys or Phe codon identity, because their P-site and A-site codons encode different amino acids in the 0-frame. As a consequence, a larger set of 26 individual base-pair changes upon −1-frameshifting can be considered in the model. Notably, we did not include any information about the experimental FS values obtained in this work (Fig. 1b) , so using the Tsuchihashi dataset provides an independent test for the model in vivo. The green histograms in Fig. 2a -c show the probability distributions for the free-energy differences obtained from both datasets, and Fig. 4a -c show the distributions for the remaining base-pair changes. We obtained free-energy differences for six base-pairs in the P site (Figs. 2a and 4a) and for three in the A site (Figs. 2b and 4b), as well as for nine combinations of P-site and A-site base pairs (Figs. 2c and 4c). The FS values calculated from the free-energy differences are in excellent agreement with the measured FS values, with an rmsd of 2.6% (Fig. 4d) . Notably, the probability distributions obtained using the Tsuchihashi et al. dataset are much broader than those obtained from our data set (Fig. 2a-c) . For some base-pair changes, the probability density extends towards large free-energy differences, indicating that FS values only provide a lower boundary, e.g., for P2 G·C → A·C (Fig. 4a, top panel) . A lower boundary arises from the close to 0% FS values, for which the corresponding ΔG values increase without limit, such that no upper boundary is obtained. Overall, the broader distributions reflect a higher uncertainty of the free-energy differences obtained from the Tsuchihashi et al. data set than to those derived from our dataset-mostly due to the smaller number and larger experimental uncertainties of the FS values used to obtain freeenergy differences for a larger number of base-pair changes. Free-energy differences of base-pair changes. As expected, all free-energy differences ΔG bp for changing a Watson-Crick base pair (A·U or U·A) into a mismatched base pair (C·U, U·U, G·U, A·A, C·A, G·A) are positive (Fig. 2a, b, Supplementary Table 4 ). Following this notion, more mismatches introduced in the −1 frame imply lower FS. Interestingly, changing the Watson-Crick A·U base pair to pyrimidine·pyrimidine (C·U or U·U) base pairs comes with the highest energetic penalty, whereas changing the Watson-Crick base pair to a mismatched pur-ine·pyrimidine base pair (A·U → G·U) or to a mismatched pyr-imidine·purine (U·A → C·A) has a lower penalty. The lowest penalty comes with the change to purine·purine base pairs (A·A or G·A). It is possible that in the codon-anticodon helix two pyrimidines are too far apart, while a pair of larger bases can form contacts, albeit not as well as the Watson-Crick base pairs. For the sequences investigated here, the only base-pair change with a negative ΔG bp is G·S to A·S in the wobble position of the A-site codon (A3). The nucleotide S is a modified U (mnm 5 s 2 U) which interacts more strongly with A than with G; ΔG bp = −2.9 or −4.6 kJ/mol from our in vitro dataset and the Tsuchihashi et al. dataset, respectively (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table 4 ). For the similar modified nucleotide mnm 5 U, which lacks the s 2 modification, the interaction with A is also stronger than with G and Fig. 3 Kinetic contribution to the frameshifting efficiency. a FS as a function of the free-energy difference ΔG between 0-frame and −1-frame for different kinetic factors κ, where κ = 0% corresponds to frameshifting in equilibrium. b Probability density for the mean kinetic factor, obtained from a modified free-energy model that takes into account kinetic barrier crossing between 0-frame and −1-frame Fig. 2b the change is in opposite direction, G → A). The similar free-energy differences of mnm 5 s 2 U and mnm 5 U suggest that the s 2 modification of U does not play a large role in the base-pair free energy. This is different with yeast tRNA Lys , where mcm 5 -modified tRNA Lys lacking the s 2 group has a lower affinity of binding to the cognate codon AAA than the fully modified tRNA Lys38 . The difference may be related to the existence of two tRNA isoacceptors in yeast dedicated to reading of AAA or AAG codon each, whereas in E. coli one tRNA isoacceptor reads both codons. tRNA Phe with the 3′ AAG 5′ anticodon is able to decode codons UUC and UUU through C·G Watson-Crick or U·G wobble base pairing at the A3 codon position. The free-energy difference between the two base pairs (A3 C·G → U·G) is 3.4 ± 0.1 kJ/mol (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table 4 ) which agrees well with the values of 6.2 ± 3.0 or 1.3 ± 2.5 kJ/mol obtained from free-energy molecular-dynamics simulations with two different starting structures 35 . The nucleotide queosine (Q) is a modified G. Changing C·Q to A·Q or U·Q to A·Q has similar free-energy costs (Fig. 4b) , indicating that the base-pair free energies of C·Q and U·Q are similar. Queosine is found in the 3′ UUQ 5′ anticodon of tRNA Asn which decodes both AAC and AAU codons. In agreement with the similar free energies, FS is similar on U 1 UUA 4 AAC/U 7 mRNA variants (2% and 3%) 39 . In the absence of the modification ( 3′ UUG 5′ anticodon), the FS of the AAC 7 variant is lower (1%) than for the AAU 7 variant (5-6%) 39 , as expected from the result that the U·G wobble base pair is weaker than the C·G base pair. The obtained free-energy differences also explain the unexpected observation that mutations A 1 G and A 4 G retain a surprisingly high FS despite the fact that they involve a mismatch in the −1-frame. The A 1 G sequence (G 1 AAA 4 AAG 7 ) undergoes two base-pair changes upon shifting to the −1-frame. The first change introduces an unfavorable mismatch in the first position of the first codon, P1 A·U → G·U, which comes with a free-energy penalty of 5.1 kJ/mol (Supplementary Table 4 , ΔG bp obtained from our dataset). The second base-pair change, the A3 G·S → A·S at the A-site wobble position, however, reduces the freeenergy difference by −2.9 kJ/mol. Therefore, the total energetic cost ΔG between the frames is only 2.2 kJ/mol, which, using the ratio of Boltzmann probabilities, results in a FS of 30% that is close to the measured value of 28%. The sequence of A 4 G (A 1 AAG 4 AAG 7 ) also introduces one G·U mismatch (A1 position) upon frameshifting, but has an even higher measured FS of 44%. Our model attributes this higher FS to a favorable G·S → A·S base-pair change in the A3 position (−2.9 kJ/mol), which almost neutralizes the unfavorable changes in P3 and A1 (G·S → A·S and A·U → G·U, respectively) of 3.3 kJ/mol to a total free energy cost ΔG = 0.4 kJ/mol, which results in a FS of 46% in agreement with the measured value of 44%. The environment of the codon-anticodon base pairs is different in the P and A sites, which prompted us to compare the individual free-energy differences in the P and A sites, respectively. The free-energy differences for A·U → U·U and U·A → A·A, which have been obtained directly (Figs. 2a, b and 5) , are similar in the P and A sites. The free-energy differences for C·A → C·U and G·A → G·U were not obtained directly, but inferred from a combination of free-energy differences under the assumption that the A·U and U·A base pairs have the same free energy (see the "Methods" section). The resulting free-energy differences for C·A → C·U are similar in the P and A sites (Fig. 5) . The G·A → G·U change appears somewhat less favorable in the P site than in the A site by about 1 kJ/mol, but this difference could also arise from a non-isostericity of the A·U base pair. Overall, 8 More unfavorable in P site More unfavorable in A site For each mRNA sequence, one square is centered at the mean value and the width and height correspond to two times the standard deviation these results suggest that the base-pair free energies in the first position of the codon-anticodon helix are similar in the P-site and A-site environment. Base-pair interactions in solution and on the ribosome. To further investigate the effect of the ribosome on the mRNA-tRNA base pairs, we compared the free-energy differences of the base pairs obtained from our model, ΔG bp , with those calculated from free-energy molecular dynamics simulations for isolated base pairs in solution, ΔG sol 40 (Fig. 6a, b) . The conformations of several Watson-Crick and mismatched mRNA-tRNA base pairs have been obtained by X-ray crystallography 27, 34 , which allows us to check whether the predicted free-energy differences are reflected in the conformational differences. The G·S → A·S change is favorable both in solution and in the A1 codon position on the ribosome, but it is slightly more favorable in solution (Fig. 6a) . The G·S and A·S base pairs both have two H-bonds on the ribosome 27 and in solution 40 , but the base-pair conformations differ (Fig. 6c, left panel) , which agrees well with the different free-energy differences. Interestingly, the sulfur atom (yellow) of the modified nucleotide mnm 5 s 2 U (S) is not directly involved in the base pairing on the ribosome, which also agrees with the observation that mnm 5 U, which lacks the sulfur atom, shows similar free-energy differences as mnm 5 s 2 U (see above). Base-pair changes introducing mismatches C·G → U·G and A·U → C·U are unfavorable both in solution and on the ribosome (Fig. 6a) . For the C·G → U·G change, the A-site conformations of the base pairs 34 are similar to those in solution (Fig. 6c, middle  panel) and indicate a loss of one H-bond, which again agrees with the positive free-energy differences ΔG bp and ΔG sol . In contrast, the A·U → U·U base-pair change is favorable in solution, but unfavorable on the ribosome (Fig. 6a) . This result agrees with the structural data which shows that for the U·U base pair a Watson-Crick-like conformation is enforced in the A site, which prevents H-bond formation 27 , while in solution two H-bonds can form, stabilizing the base pair (Fig. 6c, right panel) . In the P site, base-pair changes to U·U are favorable in solution, but unfavorable on the ribosome, which suggests that also in the P site the favorable non-Watson-Crick conformation is prevented (Fig. 6) . The base pairs A·U and G·U have similar free energies in solution and the G·U engages in a non-Watson-Crick conformation 40 . In the P site, in contrast, the G·U base pair is predicted to be weaker than the A·U base pair, which agrees with the observation that Watson-Crick-like conformation are also enforced in the P site 41 . Overall, these comparisons indicate that the predicted free-energy differences agree with qualitative expectations solely based on structural studies, thus providing further and independent support for our free-energy model.
