Selection of specific primer sets over PVX. In order to examine the specificity of six primer sets, three replicates of the experiments were conducted. When RT-LAMP assays were conducted using the RT-LAMP mixture, primer sets A, C, and F showed ladder-like bands on the agarose gel only for the PVX RNA containing samples (Fig. S1 ). By repeating the experiments with primer sets A, C, and F, we confirmed true positive reactions for primer sets A and F. To evaluate the sensitivity of the two primer sets, a dilution series of PVX RNA was used for RT-LAMP. The detection limits of primer sets A and F were observed at 0.0002 ng and 0.02 Âµg, respectively ( Fig. 1A and 1B ). In addition, the detection limit of RT-PCR was 0.2 ng (Fig.  1C ). In comparison, RT-LAMP conducted with primer set A ( Fig. 1A) showed higher sensitivity (about 1000 times) than conventional RT-PCR ( Fig 1C) . Finally, primer set A was selected and used for RT-LAMP PCR. The RT-LAMP products of RNA from leaves infected by PVX showed ladder-like bands on the agarose gel, but not rom RT-LAMP products of RNAs from healthy plant leaves and PLRV-infected plant leaves, indicating that primer set A is specific for PVX (Fig. S2 ).
