The effect of NDV on cells proliferation was studied in vitro, by using the MTT proliferation assay with DBTRG.05MG cell lines. In the assay, both concentrations of virus, IC 50 and IC 25 , were used. Untreated cells later examined using a light microscope. The selected area was cut in ultrathin sections using ultra microtome. The sections were placed into a grid and stained with uranyl acetate for 10 min followed by 50% filtered acetone, and finally stained using lead which was then washed twice with distilled water. The stained samples were then viewed under transmission electron microscopy (Phillips, Eindhoven, Netherlands).
