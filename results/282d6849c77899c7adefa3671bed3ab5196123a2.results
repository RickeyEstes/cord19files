X-Ray Crystal Structure of RNase L in Complex with 2-5A We identified diffracting crystals for porcine (Sus scrofa) RNase L (residues 21-732) lacking 20 N-terminal and 11 C-terminal protease-labile residues dispensable for enzymatic function . Crystals with the same space group, unit cell dimensions, and crystal packing arrangement were grown with natural 5 0 -triphosphorylated, 2 0 ,5 0 -triadenylate activator (2 0 -5 0 )p 3 A 3 in the presence and absence of the ATP analog AMP-PNP. Structures determined to 2.5 Å and 3.25 Å resolution, respectively, revealed a near-complete model of RNase L lacking only one N-terminal residue, three C-terminal residues, 11 residues comprising the ANK domain-PK domain linker, a four residue loop in the PK domain, and two and 19 residue loops within the RNase domain (see Table 1 for data collection and refinement statistics). Crystal packing arrangements and representative unbiased electron density centered on the 2-5A and AMP-PNP ligands are shown in Figure S1 , available online. A structure-based sequence alignment of RNase L and for comparison the dual PK domain-RNase domain catalytic module of IRE1, is shown in Figure S2 .
