Study population and H. pylori infection Two hundred and forty-nine subjects (mean age 43.0 years, SDZ9.2 years, age range 24-69 years), all working in the hospital, were included in the study population and divided into three groups: H. pylori prevalence in the three subgroups by sociodemographic characteristics is shown in Table I . Among the 249 subjects, 81 (32.5%) tested positive for H. pylori. Logistic regression analysis showed that crude H. pylori prevalence was significantly higher in both groups A (ORZ2.46; 95% CI 1.10-5.53; PZ0.03) and B (ORZ2.29; 95% CI 1.03-5.07; PZ0.04) compared with group C (Table II) . These odds ratios do not change substantially when adjusted for sex, age and education level. As shown in Table I , there was no sex difference in H. pylori prevalence. Although not statistically significant, H. pylori prevalence in the overall population increased with age (infected people: mean age 44.0 years, SD 8.4 years vs uninfected people: mean age 42.5 years, SD 9.6 years). In the endoscopy units, physicians and nursing personnel less than 40 years of age had a lower prevalence of H. pylori infection (18.8% vs 46.7%, P!0.01). Therefore, concentrating on endoscopy status and age, when adjusted for exposure to endoscopy, workers aged R40 years had a significantly higher risk of infection (ORZ1.86; 95% CI 1.02-3.40; PZ 0.04). When adjusted for age, the H. pylori infection risk in groups A and B was higher than that in group C (ORZ2.96; 95% CI 1.27-6.89; PZ 0.01 vs ORZ2.80; 95% CI 1.21-6.50; PZ0.02). Education level was used as a surrogate measure of socio-economic status as reported previously. 28, 29 An inverse relationship between educational attainment and infection in the overall population was seen in univariate analysis, showing more risk for healthcare personnel with %8 years of education compared with staff with a university education (Table II) . As reported in Table I , in the subgroup of general medical staff, personnel with a university education showed a significantly lower prevalence of infection (P!0.01) compared with personnel with a lower education level. The level of education was not related to H. pylori infection in staff with no patient contact. There was no significant difference in prevalence according to length of employment in the overall population or in the three subgroups. Also, exposure to oral and faecal secretions was not associated with infection status (Table III) . Figure 1 presents the H. pylori prevalence in endoscopy personnel and general medical staff by age group (!40 vs R40 years old). Both physicians and nurses working in an endoscopy unit showed an age-related difference in the prevalence of H. pylori infection. Physicians less than 40 years of age had significantly lower prevalence than older subjects (16.7% vs 44.8%, P!0.05), whereas the difference did not reach statistical significance among nurses (21.4% vs 48.4%, PZ0.09). In contrast, the rate of infection in general medical staff did not show any significant difference with age. Although not statistically significant, a difference between endoscopist and non-endoscopist physicians aged R40 years was observed (44.8% vs 20.0%, PZ0.1), whereas younger physicians of the two groups showed a similar prevalence of H. pylori infection (16.7% vs 13.3%). On the contrary, endoscopy nurses aged R40 years did not differ in their H. pylori prevalence from general nurses of the same age, whereas surprisingly, among nurses !40 years, the prevalence was higher among general nurses. For endoscopists, the number of endoscopies performed per week and the time working in the endoscopy unit were considered to be possible risk factors. In both cases, there was no significant association (Table IV) . Regarding infection prevention, all endoscopy personnel wore gloves during every endoscopic procedure, and 66.6% of the personnel used a mask. Among physicians, 54.3% always wore a mask during endoscopic practice, and among nursing personnel, 79.5% used a mask during endoscopy and during the cleaning of endoscopes. No association between the use of a mask and the prevalence of H. pylori infection was observed.
