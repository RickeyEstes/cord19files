A role for STING but not cGAS in responses to RNA viruses. RNA viruses induce type I interferon expression in a manner dependent on the RLR-MAVS pathway 13 . However, STING is also necessary for full responsiveness to-and control of-RNA viruses 9 . Work by us and others has recently proposed alternative and DNA-independent means for activating STING-dependent innate antiviral immune responses 14, 15 . In line with this, RNA viruses have been demonstrated to target the STING pathway [10] [11] [12] . In order to evaluate the role of STING in the stimulation of interferon production by RNA viruses, and to explore the potential involvement of cGAS, we infected wild-type (WT), STING-and cGAS-deficient MEFs with the two paramyxoviruses Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and SeV and measured the accumulation of type I interferon in the culture supernatant. Interestingly, lack of STING, but not cGAS, significantly reduced the production of type I interferons by cells infected with these viruses (Fig. 1a,b, Supplementary Fig. 1a) . In contrast to this, the stimulation of interferon expression by synthetic RNA (poly(I:C)) was not affected in cells lacking STING or cGAS but was completely abolished in MAVS-deficient cells ( Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1b) . To examine whether STING but not cGAS contributed to control of RNA viruses, we infected MEFs from WT, cGAS-and STING-deficient mice with the rhabdovirus VSV and measured accumulation of progeny virus in the supernatant. Consistent with the data on interferon production by RNA viruses, lack of STING but not cGAS led to elevated VSV replication (Fig. 1d) . To evaluate the role of the cGAS-independent STING pathway in stimulation of interferon production by a human pathogenic RNA virus, we tested IAV. Since, IAV did not induce detectable type I interferon production in MEFs we used the human monocyte/macrophage-like cell line THP1. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to generate cells deficient for cGAS and STING or b2microglobulin (B2M) as control. The deletion of cGAS and STING was confirmed by western blotting ( Supplementary  Fig. 1c ). As expected, the loss of cGAS or STING abolished the ability to produce type I interferon in response to transfection with DNA, whereas dsRNA-induced type I interferon production was unaffected ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ). The cells were infected with IAV, and accumulation of interferon in the supernatant was measured after 20 h. Similar to what was observed with NDV and SeV in MEFs, we observed that IAV-induced interferon production was reduced in cells lacking STING expression, but not in cGAS-deficient THP1 cells (Fig. 1e) . It is well-established that RNA viruses induce type I interferon in a manner dependent on the RLR-MAVS pathway 13 . Consistent with this, the majority of the interferon responses evoked by infection with NDV or SeV were dependent on MAVS ( Supplementary Fig. 2a,b) . However, we observed a significant residual response in MAVS-deficient cells infected with RNA viruses, which we did not observe when transfecting with synthetic RNA (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b and Fig. 1c) . The MAVS-independent nature of interferon responses was also observed for IAV, when measuring the ISG CXCL10 in BMDCs infected with high multiplicity of infection (MOI) ( Supplementary Fig. 2c ). To further explore whether RNA viruses induced a MAVS-independent but STING-dependent pathway, we examined for the ability of SeV, NDV and IAV to stimulate STING dimer formation in THP1 cells lacking MAVS, and therefore unable to respond to RNA ( Supplementary  Fig. 1a) . Interestingly, infection with either of the three RNA viruses induced elevated levels of STING dimers in the lysates (Fig. 1f) , and consistent with this, the residual induction of interferon-b and CXCL10 expression by IAV in MAVS-deficient cells was ablated when STING but not cGAS was knocked down by shRNA ( Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 2d ). Poly(I:C) did not stimulate CXCL10 expression in MAVS-deficient cells (Fig. 1g) . These data suggests a role for STING in evoking innate immune responses to RNA viruses through a non-canonical pathway. Identification of viral evasion strategies provides strong evidence for an important role of an immune pathway in antiviral defence 16 . For instance, IAV seeks to evade the RIG-I pathway by the non-structural protein 1, which targets the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 responsible for RIG-I CARD ubiquitination 17 . Interestingly, co-staining of cells with antibodies against the IAV surface protein hemagglutinin and STING revealed that hemagglutinin co-localized with a small pool of cellular STING (Fig. 1h) . The observed specks staining positive for both STING and hemagglutinin, was observed in the majority of cells with positive hemagglutinin staining. Among the STING-hemagglutinin double-positive specks, many were also positive for the early endosome antigen 1 ( Supplementary Fig. 3) , potentially suggesting the co-localization to occur in early endosomal compartments. Moreover, STING co-immunoprecipitated with hemagglutinin in lysates from infected cells (Fig. 1i) . Hemagglutinin is involved in viral entry, and the N-terminal region of HA2, termed the fusion peptide (FP), penetrates the cellular membrane during fusion 18 . FP is highly conserved among IAV strains and also in influenza B virus 18, 19 (Fig. 1j) , and was recently shown to have immunosuppressive properties in a monocytic cell line 20 . Remarkably, recombinant FP interacted readily with STING in cellular lysates but not with Giantin ( Fig. 1k) , which, similarly to activated STING, localizes to the Golgi. To investigate if the interaction between STING and FP represented a strategy for IAV to evade STING-dependent induction of interferon production we pretreated THP-1-derived B2M and STING knock-out (KO) cells with FP before infection with IAV. Interestingly, pretreatment with FP led to a significantly decreased interferon-a/-b response in B2M KO cells but not in the STING-KO THP-1 cells (Fig. 1l) . Collectively, these data demonstrate that a STING-dependent but cGAS-independent pathway is involved in stimulation of the interferon response to-and control of-RNA viruses, but not in the interferon response to synthetic RNA. Moreover, the IAV FP is able to directly interact with STING. IAV FP inhibits fusion-stimulated interferon production. We wanted to investigate whether FP affected known STINGdependent responses, including type I interferon production after stimulation with DNA, cGAMP or fusogenic liposomes [5] [6] [7] [8] 14 . When treating cells with recombinant FP there was no detectable effect on responses to DNA or cGAMP ( Fig. 2a,b) . By contrast, FP largely abrogated type I interferon production induced by fusogenic liposomes (Fig. 2c,d) , without affecting fusion between liposomes and cells ( Supplementary  Fig. 4a ). Furthermore, as we have also demonstrated previously 14 , fusogenic liposomes stimulated STING speck formation ( Supplementary Fig. 4b) , and as observed with IAV the production of type I interferon stimulated by fusogenic liposomes was STING-dependent but cGAS-independent ( Fig. 2e ,f). FP did not affect the MAVS-dependent response to synthetic RNA, as the response to transfection with poly(I:C) was unchanged (Fig. 2g,h) . Moreover, by introducing a single aminoacid deletion to FP (FPDI6) the ability to block type I interferon production was abrogated ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ). Thus, IAV FP specifically inhibits the cGAS-independent STING pathway induced by lipid membrane fusion but does not affect interferon induction by cytosolic delivery of synthetic DNA, cGAMP or RNA. FP inhibits STING activation in response to membrane fusion. Next we wanted to identify the step in the fusion-activated signalling pathway that was targeted by FP. Stimulation through the cGAS-STING pathway is reported to initiate and depend on relocation of STING from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi 5 . Similar to DNA stimulation, treatment with fusogenic liposomes triggered translocation of STING to the Golgi (Fig. 3a) , and Brefeldin A inhibited interferon-b expression in response to either fusogenic liposomes or DNA ( Supplementary Fig. 5a) , thus supporting the importance of STING translocation from ER to the Golgi. Treatment with FP did not interfere with translocation of STING from ER to the Golgi (Fig. 3a) . STING forms covalent homodimers in response to stimulation with cyclic di-nucleotides, and dimerization of STING is sufficient for induction of type I interferon 21 . When examining for STING dimer formation using non-reducing gels, we found that treatment with fusogenic liposomes induced the formation of a reducible STING dimer ( Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 6a ). Interestingly, FP pretreatment abolished STING dimerization, subsequent TBK1 phosphorylation and IRF-dependent transcription in response to fusogenic liposomes ( Fig. 3b-d) but not in response to cGAMP irrespective of delivery method (Fig. 3e ,f and Supplementary  Fig. 6b ). These data demonstrate that stimulation of STINGdependent pathways results in formation of stable STING homodimers and phosphorylation of TBK1, and that the IAV FP specifically inhibits this in response to fusogenic liposomes.
