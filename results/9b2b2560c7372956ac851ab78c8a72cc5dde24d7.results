There were 19 patients who remained symptomatic after discharge (6 men and 13 women; age range, 22 to 65 years; mean Ϯ SD age, 42.5 Ϯ 12.4 years). Each of these patients underwent HRCT scans and PFTs on the same day at follow-up, with an interval ranged from 25 to 38 days (mean Ϯ SD, 31.2 Ϯ 4.8 days) from discharge. There were six patients who progressed to ARDS. All patients were treated with a therapeutic regimen recommended by So et al, 20 including 11 patients with pulse steroid (PS) and 8 patients with nonpulse steroid (NPS). Demographic, clinical data including smoking status, and information of HRCT study are summarized in Table 1 . It was noted that patients who progressed to ARDS had longer hospital stays than those who did not have ARDS (59.2 Ϯ 30.5 days vs 18.4 Ϯ 13.7 days, respectively; p ϭ 0.0007).
