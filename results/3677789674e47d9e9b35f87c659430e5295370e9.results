Coronavirus persists in an infectious state on common surface materials for several days. An inoculum of 10 3 plaque forming units (PFU) persisted on polyfluorotetraethylene (Teflon; PTFE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, and stainless steel for at least 5 days (and 3 days for silicon rubber) at 21°C and a relative humidity of 30% to 40% (Fig. 1) . Rapid inactivation of human coronavirus occurs on brass and copper nickel surfaces at room temperature (21°C). Brasses containing at least 70% copper were very effective at inactivating HuCoV-229E ( Fig. 2A) , and the rate of inactivation was directly proportional to the percentage of copper. Approximately 10 3 PFU in a simulated wet-droplet contamination (20 l per cm 2 ) was inactivated in less than 60 min. Analysis of the early contact time points revealed a lag in inactivation of approximately 10 min followed by very rapid loss of infectivity (Fig. 2B) . As observed previously for norovirus, zinc demonstrated a slight antiviral effect compared to that seen with stainless steel (neither metal contains copper). Copper nickels were also effective at inactivating HuCoV-229E was applied to 1-cm 2 coupons of test surface materials and incubated at ambient conditions (21°C; relative humidity, 30% to 40%). Virus was removed and assayed for infectivity at various time points as described in the text. Although the initial inoculum concentration was quite low, the virus retained infectivity for 5 days on all surfaces, except silicon rubber. Therefore, natural contamination of common surface material with very few coronavirus particles could represent a considerable risk of infection spread if touched and transferred to facial mucosa. Error bars represent Ϯ SEM, and data are from the results of multiple experiments. but required higher (90%) copper content to produce a degree of inactivation equivalent to that seen with brasses containing 70% copper (Fig. 2C ). The inactivation time was reduced further in the rapidly drying fingertip contamination model by approximately 8-fold to 5 min for C26000 cartridge brass (Fig. 2D ). Using the same data for simulated droplet contamination, a comparison between brasses and copper nickels containing the same percentage of copper, 90% or 70%, is demonstrated in Fig. 3 . At the higher copper content level, there was little difference in efficacy between C22000 and C70600 (Fig. 3A) . However, copper nickel C72500 was less effective than C70600 although it contains the same percentage of copper. The superior antiviral properties of C70600 have been observed previously for norovirus and may involve the cuprous oxide layer visible as a removable layer (27) . However, at a lower percentage of copper, the cartridge brass was far superior to copper nickel C71500, inactivating virus in approximately one-third the time (Fig. 3B) . Copper ion release and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in inactivation of HuCoV-229E on copper and copper alloy surfaces. HuCoV-229E was inoculated onto copper and cartridge brass surfaces (100% and 70% copper, respectively; Table 1 ) in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS), chelators of Cu(II) and Cu(I), respectively. Both chelators initially protected the virus from inactivation for up to 2 h (although BCS was still protective after 2 h of contact with brass) (Fig. 4A and C) . This suggests that both ionic species of copper are required directly and/or indirectly for virus inactivation and that Cu(I) may be more significant in the longer term. Inoculation of coronavirus in the presence of D-mannitol and Tiron (4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene disulfonic acid) to quench hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions, respectively, was done to determine if these moieties were involved in the coronavirus inactivation mechanism ( Fig. 4B and D) . Tiron protected the virus for the first hour of contact, suggesting that superoxide generation is important. However, D-mannitol was minimally protective on copper but protected the virus for the duration of the test on brass. Increasing the concentration of D-mannitol did not prolong survival of infectivity on copper (not shown). This suggests that rapid inactivation of coronavirus on copper surfaces is primarily due to copper ion release and that the effect of reactive oxygen species is minimal. However, as the percentage of copper in the alloy decreased, ROS generation played a more significant role. EDTA, BCS, D-mannitol, and Tiron did not significantly affect the virus on stainless steel control surfaces or in suspension (not shown). Inactivation of coronavirus on copper and copper alloy surfaces results in fragmentation of the viral genome, ensuring that inactivation is irreversible. Coronavirus was exposed to metal surfaces and recovered, and the positive-stranded viral RNA genome was extracted and purified. A one-step reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative PCR (RTqPCR) was performed to detect a 139-bp region of ORF1 within nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4). Virus that had been exposed to copper and brass surfaces demon- was applied to 1-cm 2 coupons of a range of brasses (A and B [early time points only]), copper nickels (C), and control metal surfaces that did not contain copper (stainless steel, zinc, and nickel). Virus was removed at various time points and assayed for infectivity as described in the text. Coronavirus was inactivated in Յ40 min on brasses and 120 min on copper nickels containing less than 70% copper. Analysis of the initial 30 min of contact between virus and brasses ( Fig. 2B ) reveals an initial lag followed by rapid inactivation. Stainless steel and nickel did not demonstrate any antiviral activity, although mild antiviral activity was observed on zinc (this was significant only at 60 min [P ϭ 0.046]). (D) The same inoculum was applied as 1 l/cm 2 , was dried immediately to simulate fingertip touch contamination, and was found to have inactivated the virus approximately 8 times faster. Error bars represent Ϯ SEM, and data are from the results of multiple experiments. strated reduced copy numbers of this fragment with increasing contact times (Fig. 5A) . Comparison of the entire viral genome by agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed that nonspecific fragmentation occurred on copper and brass, with fragments becoming smaller with increasing contact time (Fig. 5B ). Exposure to copper surfaces results in morphological changes to human coronavirus particles visible in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). There was a significant difference in appearance between purified HuCoV-229E exposed to stainless steel and that exposed to copper surfaces (Fig. 6 ). On stainless steel, uniform virions were visible following a 10-min exposure (Fig. 6A ), but on copper, clumps of damaged virus particles (Fig. 6B ) as well as a few intact particles could be seen. The extent of damage increased upon further exposure to copper (Fig. 6C ).
