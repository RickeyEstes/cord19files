2.1. Cluster of Differentiation (CD) Tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD151 Are Required for Human Papillomavirus Type 16 (HPV16) Infection. Tetraspanin assemblies play an important role in virus entry [5] . It has been shown that CD9, CD81 and CD151 were downregulated during HCMV entry and that cellular depletion of CD9, CD63 and CD151 reduced HCMV infection [4, 41] . Oncogenic HPV types utilize TEMs with tetraspanin CD151 as a key player during endocytosis [28, 38] . Moreover, tetraspanin CD63 is crucial for post-endocytic virus trafficking, ensuring delivery of the viral DNA to the host cell nucleus [40] . In addition, we have shown earlier that neutralizing antibodies specific for CD63 and CD151 reduced infectivity in HEK293TT cell line [27] [28] [29] . The importance of tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 for HPV infection has not yet been revealed. To test whether additional tetraspanins are involved in HPV16 infection, we applied a pseudovirus (PsV) infection assay, depleting either CD9 or CD81. siRNAs targeting CD151 and CD63 served as a control for impaired infection. HeLa cells were incubated with specific tetraspanin siRNAs as indicated for 48 h before infection with HPV16 PsVs. All tested tetraspanin siRNAs induced a significant reduction in HPV16 infection rates ( Figure 1 ). Cellular depletion of CD81 induced a weak infection rate inhibition of 25 to 30%. Knockdown of CD63 displayed a reduction of infection by more than 50% and CD9 knockdown resulted in a strong inhibition of about 90%, which was comparable to results obtained by CD151 siRNAs. Since the knockdown efficiency of tetraspanin CD63 is stronger than the assessed infectivity after its depletion, it is likely that another tetraspanin might overtake the role of CD63. Together, these results emphasize the role of different tetraspanins in HPV infection and uncover the importance of CD9 for infection of HeLa cells. Figure 1 . Tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD81, and CD151 are required for HPV16 infection. HeLa cells were treated with control, tetraspanin CD9, CD63, CD81 or CD151 specific siRNAs (#1 or #2) for 48 h, then infected with HPV16 PsVs for 24 h. Upper panels show siRNA knockdown efficiency (β-actin served as loading control). Graphs presented on the lower panels show relative infection rates assessed by measuring luciferase activity since HPV16 PsVs harbor a luciferase expression plasmid. Data sets are shown as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and were normalized to the mean of control siRNA treated cells (set to 100%). Asterisks indicate significant differences to the control (p < 0.05).
