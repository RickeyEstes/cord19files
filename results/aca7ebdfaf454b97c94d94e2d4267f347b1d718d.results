System overview. We have shown that bacteria 18 and viruses 20 can be applied to peptide microarrays to generate synbodies with antibiotic or antiviral activity. The challenge was to create a system to generate the synbodies quickly and provide sufficient quantities of the chosen synbody for in vivo testing. The key issue was that the published process involved applying the bacterial target to 10,000 peptide microarrays (10 K), choosing and testing target peptides, synthesis of large amounts of two or more candidate peptides, synthesis of synbodies and retesting. This process usually takes several months, with the rate-limiting step the synthesis and purification of large amounts of the candidate peptides. Our solution to this time issue was to pre-screen a large number of pathogens on the 10 K peptide microarray to arrive at 100 peptides that would offer sufficient diversity that any pathogen screened would bind two or more of peptides (Fig. 1A) . By selecting peptides that are somewhat pathogen specific and others that are more broadly reactive, we should be able to select a reduced set of peptides with the potential to bind any new pathogen screened against these 100 peptides. It would then be practical to synthesize large stocks of these 100 peptides in advance so that 1,000 or more doses of a therapeutic could be produced quickly. Once the 100-peptide microarray was developed and the stocks synthesized it would be the starting point for the development of any therapeutic. As shown in Fig. 1B , a pathogen is incubated with the 100-peptide microarray and peptides binding it identified. These peptides are linked in all combinations to create lead synbodies, using the peptide and linker stocks. These leads are screened for activity against the target, preferably in blocking activity in an in vitro assay. Candidate synbodies are produced in large amounts, purified and tested in mice for acute toxicity and on red blood cells for hemolysis. The goal is to integrate the component steps so the whole process could be completed in 1 week. Creating the 100-peptide microarray. To create the 100-peptide library that could potentially bind any pathogen, we screened 21 different viruses and bacteria, representing a wide range of pathogenic bacteria and viruses on a peptide microarray (Supplementary Table S1 ). The 10 K array consists of 10,000 peptides spotted in duplicate on a standard size glass microscope slide with each peptide composed of 17 variable amino acids and an N-terminal CSG-constant region used for immobilization to the surface 22 . The slide surface is coated with a polymer to increase the peptide density and to reduce non-specific binding 18 . The peptide of each feature Figure 1 . Development of pathogen binding 100-peptide microarray and rapid synbody discovery system. (A) A range of pathogens (10 viruses and 11 bacteria) were screened against a library of 10,000 peptides to identify shared and specific pathogen binding peptides. A total of 275 peptides were selected for secondary binding screening and down-selected for cellular toxicity. Peptides with confirmed binding and minimal toxicity were selected for inclusion into the pathogen binding peptide microarray. (B) Workflow for discovery of antimicrobial synbodies. A new or unknown pathogen is fluorescently labeled and screened against the pathogen binding 100-peptide microarray. Peptides that bind the pathogen are selected and conjugated to a synbody scaffold to produce a synbody library for activity and toxicity testing in a series of in vitro functional assays to select antimicrobial synbodies for additional development. IC stain: Intracellular staining; CW stain: Cell wall staining. is of known sequence and the variable amino acid positions in the peptide are composed of 18 different amino acids with a slight for amino acids with aromatic side chains ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The bacteria in the panel were screened for binding peptides in one of two ways. Live bacteria were screened using a previously published method 18 while inactivated bacteria were detected using antibodies that were specific to that pathogen. In the live bacteria screening assay, the target is labeled with an amine-reactive dye, AlexaFluor (AF), and an internalizing dye, Cell Tracker Orange (CTO), and peptides that bind the bacteria without perturbing the membrane produce fluorescence in both channels while those that disrupt the membrane only produce fluorescence in the AF channel. Viruses were screened by detecting binding to a peptide using a fluorescently labeled virus-specific antibody, or in some cases directly labeling the virus with an Alexa Fluor dye 20 . Antibody detection was favored as it avoids the problems of the dye interfering with virus binding or binding the peptide itself. The microarray data was analyzed and binding peptides were selected according to the following criteria: (i) for pathogens detected via antibody, peptides with signals 1.5x higher the antibody only control; (ii) for direct labeled pathogens, peptides with signals 2x the background; or for live bacteria, peptides with AF/CTO <5. This selection strategy yielded a total of 893 peptides (Fig. 2) . A heat map of the data demonstrates that there are peptides that bind a single organism while there are those that bind multiple pathogens ( Fig. 2A, Supplementary Information) . Some organisms had relatively few peptide hits, while others such as E. coli O157:H7 had over 150 peptides that passed the selection criteria (Fig. 2B) . The majority of peptides bound 1 pathogen, while 127 peptides bound more than 1 pathogen (Fig. 2C ). From this data set, we selected the 127 multi-pathogen peptides and 161 single pathogen binding peptides for a total of 288 peptides that could maximally cover the pathogen space. These peptides were then synthesized in three 96-well plates and screened in secondary assays for binding and toxicity. The 288 peptides were synthesized on the 5 mg scale with an N-terminal biotin and used without purification (Supplementary Information). When the library quality was analyzed by mass spectrometry, a small number of peptides (13 peptides) did not contain the full-length peptide at high abundance when analyzed by mass spectrometry and were not included in subsequent assays, reducing the library size to 275 peptides. The first issue was to confirm that the peptides bound the target pathogen previously used for selection. Pathogen binding. Peptides must function when immobilized on a microarray, therefore we printed the 275 peptide candidates as a new microarray using the same methods as for the 10 K array. We then screened the 10 viruses and 11 bacteria (Supplementary Table S1 ) that had been previously tested on the 10 K array to verify binding to the appropriate pathogen. To increase confidence in the binding data, we changed the detection method for several bacterial pathogens, from AF-633/CTO labeling used in the 10 K array experiments to a dual membrane labeling approach using AF555 / AF647. Peptides that bound in both array detection methods were considered true hits. From this analysis, we found that 175 peptides showed binding for 1 or more pathogens (Fig. 3A , Supplementary Information) . Each peptide was then tested in an ELISA assay to determine its relative affinity for four different pathogens: vaccinia virus, H1N1 influenza virus, and Gram-negative pathogens F. tularensis, and R. prowazekii. Representative results from peptides binding to each pathogen are presented in Fig. 3B (Supplementary Fig. S2 ). As can be seen, some peptides showed high binding across all pathogens and all tested concentrations, indicating likely promiscuous or non-specific binding. However, other peptides had concentration dependent changes in pathogen binding. While absolute K D values could not be determined with this method as unpurified peptides were used, relative K D values could be estimated, with many peptides exhibiting concentration dependent binding. Peptides of this phenotype were classified as probable pathogen binders while non-specific binding or non-binding peptides were rejected. A total of 118 peptides passed this screening. In parallel with the binding assays, peptides were screened in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay using HEK293 cells. Peptides were screened at 0.25, 2.5 and 25 μM and the cell viability at 25 μM was plotted (Fig. 3C ). Few peptides exhibited toxicity above the assay noise and those peptides with the highest toxicity were rejected. Based on these data the peptides were ranked by: (1) 275-peptide array binding (2) binding to 1 or more pathogens in ELISA and (3) by in vitro cytotoxicity. A total of 82 peptides showed binding in both binding assays and an additional 18 peptides showed binding in the peptide array only. Analysis of the peptides showed that there was a wide distribution of net charges and isoelectric points ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Only 66% of this library is cationic in contrast to peptides in the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) database of which ~82% are cationic 23 . The 100 peptides were synthesized commercially (Sigma) at the 2-gram scale and purified to >95% purity (Supplementary Table S2 ). This stock was the source of peptides for printing 100 peptide arrays and for the synthesis of the synbodies. To confirm that an unknown pathogen would bind to peptides from this reduced library, we screened two pathogens that were not used as part of the peptide selection process, adenovirus and rotavirus. Adenovirus is a non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus while rotavirus is a non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus. Each virus was labeled with AF555 and AF647 and tested using the same procedures as before. When the fluorescent signal across both channels is compared, it can be seen that multiple peptides bound each new pathogen (Fig. 4) . There was correlation between both fluorescent dyes and binding peptides for a new pathogen could be easily identified. For example, peptides with relative fluorescence values >10,000 for both fluorophores could be selected as binding peptides for the new virus. In this way, multiple peptides could be selected for synbody construction. These data indicate that this array can potentially identify binding peptides for any given pathogen. Rapid Synbody Discovery. The creation of the 100-peptide microarray allowed implementation of the selection process. As shown in Fig. 1B , a pathogen of interest is applied to the microarray and peptides selected based on the relative florescence. Seven to 10 peptides are selected and the 100 peptide stock used to synthesize all combinations of the peptides into synbodies. We developed a modular and combinatorial approach using maleimide-thiol conjugation to rapidly produce synbody libraries [19] [20] [21] where selected peptides are conjugated to different peptide scaffolds, each with two conjugation sites, in a combinatorial manner and in parallel. With this approach, dozens or even hundreds of synbodies can be produced in a day. The synbodies are evaluated for their potency, efficacy, and toxicity with the best selected for production in large scale. Once the synbodies are produced they can be screened for pathogen binding by ELISA, in vitro activity in either growth inhibition assays for antibacterial or in plaque reduction assays for antiviral synbodies, red blood cell toxicity and kidney toxicity. Candidates that have high target binding, in vitro activity and low toxicity are then prepared on large scale (>100 mg) with the same chemistry and purified by HPLC. Parallel primary screening, rapid synbody production using stocks of pre-made peptides, and parallel activity and toxicity testing enable this system to produce synbodies candidates in a very rapid fashion. Once the basic component steps had been optimized a test run for a specific pathogen was executed to determine the time to complete synbody production. We chose A/CA/07/2009 H1N1 influenza, a major health concern worldwide as a viral test and S. epidermidis, which causes surgery related infections and is a source of antibiotic resistance genes, as a bacterial target.
