Protection of pathogens from disinfectants is related to viscosity of artificial mucus. We evaluated the resistance of pathogens [PR8 influenza A virus (IAV) and Escherichia coli (E. coli)] in artificial mucus preparations to alcohol-based disinfectants. Artificial mucus was prepared by dissolving carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), guar gum (GG), xanthan gum (XG), or gelatin in either saline or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). 80 w/w% ethanol (EA), 70 w/w% 2-propanol (IPA), or 60 w/w% 1-propanol (n-P) was used for the inactivation test, because these alcohol-based disinfectants are used commonly in clinical practice. IAV and E. coli were completely inactivated in saline or low concentrations of CMC-, GG-, and XG-based artificial mucus. However, active (or infectious) virus and viable bacteria were detected at 1% CMC (EA, IPA) and 1.5% CMC (n-P) (Figs 1A and 2A) , at 0.3% GG (EA, IPA) and 0.4% GG (n-P) (Figs 1B and 2B) , and 0.1% XG (EA, IPA) and 0.25% XG (n-P) (Figs 1C and 2C), with titre/viable count ratios increasing as a function of concentration. In all types of artificial mucus, viscosity increased with mucus concentration; thus, titre/viable count ratio increased along with viscosity. To clarify the relationship between pathogen protection from alcohol-based disinfectants and artificial mucus viscosity, pathogen resistance to disinfectants was compared between the gel and sol forms of gelatin (which differ in terms of viscosity at a given temperature) by the inactivation test. The viscosity was higher for the gel as compared to the sol form of gelatin at each concentration, and titre/viable count ratios were also significantly higher for the gel than for the sol form (â‰¥1%) (P < 0.001 for all) (Figs 1D and 2D). Mucus viscosity is positively correlated with titre/viable count ratio. The above results suggest that the viscosity of artificial mucus contributes to the protection of pathogens against alcohol-based disinfectants. We created scatter plot of the viscosity of all types of artificial mucus (CMC, GG, XG and gelatin) vs. titre/viable count ratio, and used Pearson's correlation coefficient to assess the correlation between artificial mucus viscosity and titre/viable count ratio. The viscosity and titre ratio of IAV were positively correlated. The correlation coefficient was 0.909 for EA, 0.911 for IPA, and 0.835 for n-P (P < 0.001, for all) (Fig. 3A) . The viscosity and viable count ratio of E. coli were also positively correlated. The correlation coefficient was 0.864 for EA, 0.873 for IPA, and 0.839 for n-P (P < 0.001 for all) (Fig. 3B ).
