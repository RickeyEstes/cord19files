Thirty-two patients were admitted in our ICU for ACS during the study period, including 15 with exclusion criteria (antibiotic therapy since >48 hours, n ¼ 7; unavailability of the PET camera, n ¼ 3; noninvasive ventilation support, n ¼ 2; refusal to consent, n ¼ 3). Seventeen patients were thus included in the study, including 16 with SS disease and 1 with S-bþ thalassemia disease.
