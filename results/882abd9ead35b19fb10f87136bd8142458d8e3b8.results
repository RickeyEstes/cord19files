Computational design of epitope scaffolds by side-chain grafting Epitope scaffolds were identified from a subset of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) 24 and computationally designed using the side-chain grafting protocol as previously described. 16 Briefly, candidate scaffolds with exposed backbone similar to the 2F5 epitope were selected in the matching stage, the epitope side chains were transferred onto the scaffolds, and additional computational design steps ensured that the epitope scaffolds could successfully interact with the mAb. Compared to previous 2F5 epitope scaffolding work, here we focused on transplanting shorter ranges of the 2F5 epitope (LExDKWA, ExDKWA, and LExDKW) to identify epitope scaffolds with better mimicry of the epitope core. The transplanted epitope ranges contribute at least 60% of the buried surface area and include 10 out of the 13 hydrogen bonds and salt bridges present at the interface of the 2F5-gp41 complex. 21 Given the large contributions of the selected epitope subranges to the overall binding interface, we reasoned that their stabilization through scaffolding would be sufficient to generate high-affinity epitope scaffolds. Twenty-eight epitope scaffolds based on 28 different parent proteins were initially designed to accommodate the 2F5 epitope, and the resulting epitope scaffolds were predicted to productively interact with the antibody (see Fig. 2 for models of representative epitope scaffolds). On each of these epitope scaffolds, two to five additional variants were subsequently designed using Rosetta in an attempt to optimize protein solubility and stability. Modifications included removing unpaired cysteines, removing exposed hydrophobics, trimming domains, and creating negatively or positively charged variants by redesigning surface residues. 25 Overall, 98 epitope scaffolds were selected for experimental characterization. These epitope scaffolds differed from the parent proteins by 15 mutations on average and were predicted to present epitope backbone conformations within 1 Å RMSD of the 2F5-bound gp41 (Table S1 ). Biophysical characterization of side-chain grafting epitope scaffolds Epitope scaffolds were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography. Of the 98 computational designs, 35 (36%), based on 15 different parent proteins, were soluble and purifiable. In comparison, none of the first-generation 2F5 epitope scaffolds were soluble when expressed in E. coli. 15 In an initial screen, 2F5 binding was assessed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), with epitope scaffolds flowed at high concentrations (N 5 μM) over 2F5 IgG captured on an amine-linked anti-human IgG CM5 chip. For proteins that bound to 2F5 in this screen, the thermal stability, solution multimeric state, and K d for 2F5 were subsequently measured (Figs. 3 and 4; Figs. S1 and S2). Table 1 summarizes the biophysical data for seven representative epitope scaffolds with a K d lower than 1 μM. Four of these seven epitope scaffolds were design variants that included mutations to enhance solubility or stability as mentioned above-design variants without the additional mutations were either insoluble or unstable during purification. In these cases, the additional mutations were introduced outside the region interacting with antibody and were as follows: SC_2cx0 and SC_1o5u were resurfaced for net negative charge by designing all the exposed surface residues not contacting the antibody to negatively charged or neutral polar residues (total charges were −16 and − 10, respectively); one unpaired cysteine was removed from SC_2aam; four nonpolar surface residues on SC_1zs7 were changed to polar. Epitope scaffolds were thermally stable with melting temperatures greater than 80°C as measured by circular dichroism (CD) temperature melt analysis ( Fig. 4 and Fig. S2 ). Although most of the parent proteins for these scaffolds originated from thermophilic organisms, the high thermal stability is still remarkable given that approximately 10% of the total residues were mutated to create the epitope scaffolds. Static light scattering analysis showed that except for SC_2cx0 (mixture of monomer and trimer species), all epitope scaffolds were monomeric in solution (data not shown). The parent protein for SC_1vr9 is a natural dimer, but the dimerization interface was intentionally disrupted during the design process, which resulted in SC_1vr9 being a monomer in solution. To provide controls for the interaction of 2F5 with side-chain grafting epitope scaffolds, we first used SPR to measure the dissociation and rate constants of three gp41 peptides of different lengths centered at the " 664 DKW 666 " core (Table 1 and Fig. 3 ). Peptides were injected over 2F5 captured on a CM5 chip with amine-coupled anti-human IgG. The full-length 2F5 epitope ( 657 EQELLELDKWASLW 670 ) bound the antibody with high affinity (K d =4.1 nM) in agreement with previously published values. 26, 27 Shorter epitope peptides, however, showed considerably reduced affinity for the antibody. 661 LELDKWA 667 bound 2F5 with a K d of 144 nM while 662 ELDKWA 667  Oligomeric state showed a K d of 2.3 μM, corresponding to 36-fold and 564-fold lower affinity than the full-length epitope peptide, respectively. Decreases in k on and increases in k off contributed to the reduction in affinity. Based on the crystal structure of the 2F5-gp41 epitope complex (PDB ID: 1tji), 21 the shorter peptides make two fewer hydrogen bonds (Gln 658 O to Gln L27 N2 of 2F5; Glu 659 O2 to Ala 1L N of 2F5) and bury less surface area than the full-length epitope peptide when interacting with 2F5. Indeed, 662 ELDKWA 667 and 661 LELDKWA 667 peptides present 62% and 74% of the total binding surface of the 657 EQELLELDKWASLW 670 peptide, respectively. 21 Determination of 2F5 binding parameters for epitope scaffolds was done as for the peptides above. Epitope scaffolds bound 2F5 with higher affinity than corresponding epitope peptides, consistent with the assumption that epitope stabilization in the antibody-bound state results in better 2F5 binding. SC_1vr9 (K d = 71.3 nM) and SC_1zs7 (K d = 75.2 nM), both of which present the ELDKWA portion of the epitope, have a 30-fold higher affinity for 2F5 than the 662 ELDKWA 667 peptide. SC_2cx5 (K d = 38.3 nM), which presents the LELDKWA portion of the epitope, binds 2F5 fourfold tighter than the 661 LELDKWA 667 peptide (Fig. 3 ). With one exception (SC_1vr9a), the binding improvements of epitope scaffolds over corresponding epitope peptides were due to slower dissociation rates (k off ).
