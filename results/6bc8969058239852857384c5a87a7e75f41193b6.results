The Role of Irradiation in the Induction and Adoptive Transfer of SGVHD. The current studies were designed to identify the specific levels of irradiation necessary for the manifestation of SGVHD by direct primary induction or by adoptive transfer. For the induction studies, Lewis rats were subjected to graded doses of whole body irradiation followed by infusion of syngeneic marrow (6 x 107 nucleated cells) and treatment with CsA for 30 d. The incidence of SGVHD was assessed for each dose ofradiation . Lethal total body irradiation of 1,050 rad on the day before bone marrow reconstitution and the start ofCsA therapy correlated with a 100% incidence ofclinical SGVHD as indicated in Fig The clinical incidence of SGVHD after different doses of radiation. The recipients, receiving different doses of radiation, either were transfused with 50 x 10 6 splenocytes from autoimmune donors (solid bars) or were treated with CsA in order to induce SGVHD (hatched bars). The average number of rats studiedin each group was greater than five . ation tested were ineffective in allowing the induction of SGVHD. At all levels of radiation control animals treated with mock diluent post marrow reconstitution demonstrated no evidence of disease as did animals treated with CsA that did not receive any irradiation. For the adoptive transfer studies, Lewis rats were prepared with graded doses of radiation followed by infusion of splenocytes from animals with active SGVHD together with normal marrow. Both lethal and sublethal doses of radiation elicited a high incidence of severe SGVHD upon the infusion of effector splenocytes ( Fig .  1 ). At 500 rad, one of seven rats demonstrated clinical SGVHD, and three other animals exhibited histologic SGVHD. The lowest dose of irradiation, 300 rad, was ineffective in abolishing the resistance to the adoptive transfer of disease. Similarly, infusion of effector splenocytes into nonirradiated animals did not transfer the disease (data not shown) . Decreasing doses of radiation correlated with a reduction in the histologic grade, hence severity, of acute GVHD. Secondary recipients treated with 1,050 or 750 rad demonstrated predominately a grade three acute SGVHD histologically. The animal with clinical SGVHD treated with 500 rad demonstrated a histologic grade 2. The Role of Other Preparative Regimens in the Induction versus Adoptive Transfer ofAutoreactivity. As indicated above, irradiation is an integral component in both generating autoimmune precursors and abolishing host resistance to adoptive transfer; other preparative regimens were the next tools in which to distinguish the individual characteristics inherent in each system using an experimental design similar to that described above for defining the radiation sensitivity. CY at all doses, 200, 100, 50, and 25 mg/kg, combined with a 30-d subsequent regimen ofCsA, was an ineffective preparative regimen for the primary induction ofSGVHD, as shown in Fig. 2 . However CY at a dose of 200 or 100 mg/kg given on the day before adoptive transfer resulted in a maximum incidence ofacute SGVHD clinically detectable by day 10. The severity as noted pathologically was a grade 2 acute SGVHD at a dose of 200 mg/kg and dropped to a grade 1 acute SGVHD at 100 mg/kg. These data suggest that the abolishing of host resistance to adoptive transfer of SGVHD is dependent on the dose of CY used . Table I demonstrates that a busulfan preparative regimen of 30 mg/kg on day -2 before bone marrow rescue and subsequent CsA therapy did not result in the induction of SGVHD: a low incidence ofSGVHD (one of eight rats) did occur with concomitant busulfan and CY therapy, but did so much later (day 28) compared with that observed (day 10-14) when irradiation (1,050 rad) was used as the ablative therapy. In the case of adoptively transferring SGVHD, one of seven rats treated with busulfan treatment alone had a clinical picture of acute SGVHD, which also occurred late. These studies suggest that the nature of the autoregulatory system is radiosensitive, CY sensitive, and relatively busulfan resistant. Previous studies have shown that thymic irradiation was necessary for the induction of SGVHD (8, 10) . We explored whether thymic irradiation was necessary for the adoptive transfer of disease. The data in Table I show that thymic irradiation with a collimated beam focused on the thymus followed by autologous reconstitution and adoptive transfer of effector splenocytes allowed for the successful transfer of SGVHD in five ofeight animals. Lower hemibody irradiation did not allow transfer The clinical incidence of syngeneic GVHD after CY therapy. The recipients, receiving various doses of CY, either were transfused with 5 x 10 6 effector splenocytes (solid bars) or were treated with CsA therapy to induce SGVHD (hatched bars). The average number of rats studied in each group was greater than five . The fraction of recipients with clinical GVHD after either inductive therapy or adoptive transfer. The recipients were treated with various preparative regimens . Groups A and B were reconstituted with 50 x 106 bone marrow cells . Groups C and D underwent autologous reconstitution . The rats in the adoptive transfer study received 50 x 106 splenocytes from autoimmune donors . of SGVHD. These data suggest that thymic irradiation is important for the abolition of host resistance mechanisms specific to this syndrome. The Characterization of theAutoregulatory Pbpulation by Adoptive Cotransfer Studies. The studies above provide evidence that there is a host resistance or autoregulatory system preventing the adoptive transfer of SGVHD. To document and characterize the autoregulatory cell, a series of adoptive cotransfer studies were performed. Two different doses of effector splenocytes from rats with SGVHD were compared since the potencies of a given effector population can not be predicted. The variables of time after CsA withdrawal, the timing and stage of disease manifestation, or inherent differences in the capability of a population to undergo clonal expansion can explain the varying potencies of effector cells. Both doses of effector splenocytes (15 and 30 x 106 ) were capable of establishing clinical and grade 2 histologic SGVHD in irradiated secondary recipients (Table II) . The transfer of spleen cells from reconstituted non-CsA-treated rats did not mediate disease (data not shown) . The cotransfer of 30 x 106 unfractionated lymphocytes from a normal rat prevented the establishment of SGVHD in recipients receiving 15 x 106 effector lymphocytes and reduced the clinical incidence of SGVHD in those receiving an equivalent dose of effector splenocytes . In both cases the cotransfer of normal unfractionated splenocytes downregulated the histologic severity of SGVHD from a grade 2 to a grade of 1 of the animals developing disease. If the cotransferred splenocytes were first fractionated over nylon wool and shown to be >85% OX19 + by FAGS analysis, then 30 x 106 nylon wool-nonadherent splenocytes were as or more effective than unfractionated splenocytes in reducing the incidence of SGVHD upon the cotransfer of an equivalent number of effector splenocytes (Table II, The cotransfer of effector splenocytes from autoimmune donors with fractionated and unfractionated splenocytes from a normal animal . Syngeneic marrow (60 x 10 6 cells) and effector splenocytes (15 x 106 cells in A, 30 x 106 cells in B, and 50 x 106 cells in C) were transfused into lethally irradiated recipients . In A and B, the secondary recipients received either no splenocytes (-), or 30 x 106 unfractionated splenocytes, or 30 x 106 nylon wool-nonadherent (NWNA) splenocytes from a normal animal. In C, the secondary recipients received either no splenocytes, 50 x 106 NWNA splenocytes, or 50 x 10 6 OX19-depleted NWNA splenocytes from a normal rat . no evidence of GVHD (Table 11 , group A) clinically or histologically. Hence nylon wool-nonadherent splenocytes appeared to be more effective in suppressing the transfer of disease than unfractionated splenocytes. Table II , group C, demonstrates that the depletion of nylon wool-nonadherent splenocytes of OX19 + lymphocytes removed the autoregulatory effect present in normal splenocytes. Depletion protocols both by panning and immunomagnetic separation resulted in a T cell-depleted population with <20% staining with W3/13 (another pan-specific T cell marker that has some crossreactivity with other cell types, i.e., polymorphs and stem cells [18] ). The transfer of 50 x 106 effector splenocytes elicited SGVHD in lethally irradiated secondary recipients : only the cotransfer of nylon wool-adherent splenocytes and not the OX19-depleted population prevented the transfer of disease. The Critical Period after Transplantation to Initiate CsA Therapy or the Adoptive Transfer of Effector Splenocytes. The present study correlated the time of initiation of daily CsA therapy after irradiation and bone marrow transplantation with the incidence ofclinical and pathologically evident SGVHD. A delay in the initiation ofCsA therapy for 4-5 d after bone marrow transplantation still resulted in the maximum incidence of SGVHD. If CsA treatment was delayed until 7 d after transplantation, then only 30% of the rats developed SGVHD (Fig. 3) . Likewise, the time of infusion of unfractionated effector splenocytes after lethal irradiation of secondary recipients is critical to elicit a complete transfer of SGVHD (Fig. 4) . Ifeffector splenocytes were transferred between day 0 to 4 after transplantation, then all rats manifested severe GVHD usually between 14 to 21 d later. By day 7 after bone marrow transplantation, evidence of a resistance mechanism is clear, since 30% ofthe secondary recipients were now resistant to the transfer of SGVHD. Rats 14 d after transplantation were comparable to pretransplant rats; both were absolutely refractory to the adoptive transfer of SGVHD. The incidence of SGVHD in lethally irradiated recipients . The secondary recipients received 50 x 106 effector splenocytes prior to irradiation and transplantation (Pre Tx), or on days 0, 4, 7 after irradiation and transplantation. The number of animals per group was four.
