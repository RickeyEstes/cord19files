The current release (v1.0) of ORION-VIRCAT automatically mapped and joined 617 705 entries from the NCBI-VGR to the viral naming of the ICTV. This detailed analysis revealed that 399 095 entries from the NCBI-VGR can be mapped to the ICTV classification and that one Order, 10 families, 35 genera and 503 species listed in the ICTV disagree with the the NCBI-VGR classification schema (Supplementary Data). Our analysis also found four main types of discrepancies between the ICTV master list and the NCBI-VGR entries. The first level consisted of minor differences in the capitalization between the naming conventions or changes in one letter. For example, the ICTV listed PhiH-like viruses, while the NCBI-VGR listed phiH-like viruses. In a smilar case, the ICTV listed Omicronpapillomavirus while the NCBI-VGR listed Omikronpapillomavirus. The second level of discrepancies included 15 genera remaining unclassified within a particular family in the NCBI-VGR. However, recent updates of the ICTV master list gave these viral groups a genus name. The third level of discrepancy consisted of species belonging to one of four different genera that have been ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... .......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... reassigned to a new genus. The fourth level of discrepancy included species listed only in the ICTV master list and classified within a particular taxonomy according to morphological observations but without sequence entries available in the NCBI-VGR.
