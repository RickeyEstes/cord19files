We estimated 14595 public hospital beds and 5618 private hospital beds in Sydney. We estimated there are 100638 clinical HCWs in Sydney, the majority (65%) aged 30-49 years old, 51% nurses and 18% doctors [27] . We estimated a public health workforce of 1500 nationally, with approximately 330 public health workers in Sydney. Fig 1 shows the relative epidemic size of a deliberate release scenario with 100 or 1000 initial infected compared to a single importation of smallpox from an epidemic overseas, to illustrate the potential scale of the required public health response. The higher the initial number infected, the more rapid and severe the epidemic. Without intervention, the death rate will reach an incidence (number of new infected people per day) rate of 8 deaths per 1000 population per day. The overall reproductive number was estimated to be 4.6. Fig 2 shows the influence on infections and deaths by varying time to response and case isolation rates. Both timing and isolation rates of infected cases are highly influential in outbreak control. With 100 infected initially, when isolation decreases, the deaths increase from a maximum of 2, 4 and 9 per day in the best scenario with 95% isolation (for T = 15,20 and 30 respectively), to 3.5, 5.5 and 12 per day with only 50% of cases isolated (Fig 2) . Fig 3 shows the influence of varying time of starting the intervention and varying percentage of contacts traced on the incidence of infections and deaths with case isolation constant at 95%. With a high proportion of cases isolated, outbreak control can be achieved within 100 days even with only 50% of contacts traced. Fig 4 shows the effect of varying both case isolation and contact tracing rates, with the intervention commencing at 20 days-case isolation is more influential, with epidemic control severely impacted when isolation and contact tracing falls to 50%. In Table 2 we show the impact of the epidemic (total cases and contacts needed to be traced) by varying case isolation rates. The total number of cases range from 528 to 285,400; and contacts that need to be traced between 1277 and 940350 in the best-and worst-case scenarios respectively.
