GI disease and prevalenee of rotavirus. Fifteen infants in our NICU developed NEC or HGE during the 4 months after the arrival of a baby with severe NEC and bowel perforation. Eleven of these affected babies became ill within the first 4 weeks (Fig. 1) . By use of a combination of EIAs (the three EIAs were 100% concordant in their results) and serology tests, 11 of 15 symptomatic patients were found to be infected with rotavirus (Table I) . This incidence compared with only 8 of 147 asymptomatic babies (P <0.0001). An adequate quantity of swab sample to permit additional testing was available from four of the babies with NEC and EIA positivity. Characteristic rotavirus particles were seen by electron microscopy in all four fecal samples, and rotavirus was successfully passaged in tissue culture inoculated with feces from two of these symptomatic infants. One infant had rotavirus in his stool on routine screening 24 hours before the development of NEC. Two babies intermittently shed rotavirus: one, with NEC, for 4 weeks; the other, an asymptomatic infant, for 1 week. Both had intervening negative samples. During the study period, three babies were transferred to our NICU after the development of NEC at referring hospitals (Fig. 1 ). The first of these patients arrived 5 days before the outbreak began and is presume d to be the index case. Although stool specimens were not available retrospectively on that patie m, his admission serum contained IgM antibody to rotavirus. The second transferred patient with NEC arrived during week 5 of the study period. His disease developed at a satellite community nursery that shares numerous staff members with our NICU on a rotating basis. Stool samples were not available from that RV, rotavirus. *Incidence of rotavirus in symptomatic group differs from incidence in asymptomatic group by P <0.0001. baby either, but he also had serum IgM antibody to RV. Neither stool nor serum was available from the third transferred patient. No additional cases of NEC or HGE occurred in the NICU between week 12 and the end of the study (week 18). None of the 110 nursery personnel had rotavirus detected in their stools during the point prevalence rectal swab survey. Of 59 staff members from whom sera were available, however, 12 (20%) were found to have IgM antibody to rotavirus, indicating recent infection. Rotavirus antigen was not found on any of the environmental surfaces tested. Routine bacterial and viral cultures of stool for common enteric pathogens were negative in all patients and control infants, and electron microscopic studies did not show any nonrotavirus viral particles. There was no difference in the predominant bacteriologic flora between symptomatic and asymptomatic infants. Case control study. Comparisons were made between the 15 cases of NEC and HGE and 45 randomly selected I  I  I  J  I  I  h  I  J  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I weight, gestational age, the total number of red blood cell transfusions during the hospitalization, and exposure to phototherapy (each with p <0.0002). Also strongly associated were the following: jaundice, bronchopulmonary dys-plasia, and the number of red blood cell transfusions in the first week of life (each with P = 0.001); and surgical repair of patent ductus arteriosus and hours of phototherapy in the first week of life and during the total hospitalization (each with P <0.003). Pearson correlation tables revealed a strong relationship among several of those variables, particularly between birth weight and many of the variables found to be most significant by univariate testing (data available on request), prompting us to perform multivariate logistic regression analysis (Table II) to determine the independence of these seemingly associated factors. When control for birth weight is incorporated into the analysis, only rotavirus infection (P --0.0001) and age at first nonwater feeding (P < 0.02) are significant. When there is control for both weight and rotavirus infection, age at first nonwater feeding remains the only additionally significant factor. The relative risk of rotavirus infection for the development of NEC or HGE was 38.5; the odds ratios of birth weight and the age at first feeding are displayed in Figs. 2 and 3 . Analysis of the number of days between the first day of feeding and the onset of symptoms of NEC or HGE revealed no apparent pattern. We further analyzed the data on infants infected with rotavirus to identify factors that distinguished infected symptomatic babies from those who were infected but remained asymptomatic. Nineteen patients became infected during the study period: 11 symptomatic with NEC or HGE, eight asymptomatic. Significant differences (P <0.05) between those populations included birth weight, age at time of first nonwater feeding, the duration of time spent in phototherapy, and jaundice. The numbers of patients in these two subgroups of rotavirus-infected babies were too small to allow meaningful logistic regression analysis.
