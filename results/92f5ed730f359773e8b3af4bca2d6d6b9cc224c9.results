All 102 HCW indicated willingness to participate. Of these, 85 (84 %) completed both the baseline questionnaire and attended the briefing sessions and 74 (73 %) completed the post-test questionnaire ( Table 1) . Matching of questionnaires and observations was not possible as the questionnaires were anonymous. There was no significant difference in distribution of occupations, gender, or years of experience between the subjects completing the two questionnaires (Table 1)  At baseline, hand hygiene actions of 61 HCW were recorded. Sixty-two of 214 potential hand hygiene opportunities (either handwashing or hand-rubbing) were performed, representing 29 % overall compliance ( Table 2) . Patient turnover was high, with 83/214 (39 %) hand hygiene opportunities linked to new patients at baseline and 101/243 (42 %) post-test. Post-test compliance increased to 51 %, with 125 of 243 opportunities completed ( Table 2 ). For both baseline and post-test, an average of seven potential opportunities was observed per subject. Approximately 60 % of opportunities involved before and after patient contact. Three instances of contact with body fluids or excretions or non-intact skin occurred during baseline observation but none post-test. No patients requiring special precautions were identified during the 6 days of observation (Table 2) . Both radiographers and HCA showed a significant improvement in hand hygiene compliance but nurses' improvement did not reach significance (Table 2) . Compliance was significantly increased for before and after patient contact and after contact with inanimate items ( Table 2) . Overall hand hygiene compliance increased significantly following the intervention by 23 % (p = 0.012). This 23 % improvement was entirely due to significantly increased use of ABHR (5 % before, 27 % after; p (Chi squared) = 0.003) as handwashing rates did not alter (24 % before and after). Missed opportunities reduced from 71 to 49 %. Analysis of responses to the questionnaire indicated that initially respondents had quite good knowledge about hand hygiene as can be seen by generally high median scores ( Table 3) . As initial knowledge levels were good, there was little change for several of the questions (Q 1, 2, 5, 7). There was some improvement in understanding that hand hygiene is necessary before patient contact (Q6) and the need for rubbing until alcohol evaporated (Q10) but these improvements did not lead to a change in median score. The post-test median scores were improved for understanding that alcohol alone cannot be used for hand hygiene (Q3) but there was some confusion about appropriate use of ABHR as reflected in answers to Q8. Knowledge of MRSA transmission and the importance of environmental contamination improved considerably (Q4, Q9). This improved knowledge correlated well with less missed opportunities for these hand hygiene moments (Table 2) . There was also an improvement in most median scores for attitude to hand hygiene following the intervention. Pre-intervention scores were high for questions relating to prevention of hospital-acquired infection indicating that most HCW already recognized the effectiveness of hand hygiene in preventing disease transmission. However, there was an increase in acceptance of ABHR (Q8). Appreciation of time saved by use of ABHR was also demonstrated by changes in responses to Q7 (Table 4 ).
