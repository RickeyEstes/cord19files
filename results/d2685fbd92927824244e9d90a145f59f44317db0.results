Clinical and laboratory characteristics of study subjects. During the 2009 pandemic, hospitals in China admitted patients with severe infection, but also, unusually, patients with mild infection, who under normal circumstances would not require hospitalization. This 'open-door' policy provided a unique opportunity to capture a relatively unselected group of patients with divergent outcomes, observed and managed under similar clinical conditions. In this cohort, 83 patients fulfilled the criteria for inclusion (influenza pdmH1N1/09 infection confirmed by viral genome PCR assay, able to give informed consent) and exclusion (use of corticosteroids or any other immunosuppressants for 1 month before or during sampling, coexisting illnesses, pregnancy, positive bacterial cultures from respiratory tract secretions/sputum or blood at any point during hospital admission). Blood was obtained 2 or 3 days after admission and the progress of patients was observed throughout the duration of their hospital stay. At the point of discharge, patients were divided into those with 'mild' and 'severe' disease by perusal of the clinical data over the entire course of their stay. Mild disease (n ¼ 51) was defined as those who reported symptoms (fever, cough, headache and lethargy) only, and whose circulating leukocyte profile (total leukocyte, lymphocytes and neutrophils) was normal throughout the hospital stay. Patients with severe disease (n ¼ 32) were those who reported the symptoms described above, but deteriorated and developed pneumonic consolidation and/or bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph with or without respiratory failure (defined as PaO 2 /FiO 2 o200 mm Hg), or respiratory failure with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy or renal failure (only 1 of the 32 patients). All the patients (32/32) in severe group used Oseltamivir, and 38/51 of patients in mild group were given Oseltamivir. No patients developed pleural effusion or empyema. Six patients were mechanically ventilated and all of these were among the thirteen severely infected patients who died. Demographic data are shown in Table 1 . The C allele at SNP 12252 was associated with disease severity. We sequenced 300 base pairs of the IFITM3 locus encompassing SNP rs12252 in these 83 pH1N1/09 infected individuals. Of these, 42.17% carried the CC genotype, a higher frequency than in the Han Chinese in the 1,000 genomes sequence database (25.38% CC genotype; (P ¼ 0.0001, w 2 -test)) ( Table 2 , Fig. 1a and b). We then stratified hospitalized patients into mild and severe, based on clinical assessment (Table 1) . Mildly ill individuals did not have significantly different allele frequencies compared with the Fig.  1b and c). Ten of the thirteen patients who died carried the CC genotype. The recessive model has the largest odds ratio. We analysed the association of rs12252 with severe infection by comparing against the mildly infected individuals assuming different genetic models (Table 3) . We could explicitly assess whether one (dominant) or two copies (recessive) of the C allele increase risk of severe infection, as well as whether the risk increase is significant assuming multiplicative (r-fold increase for CT, r 2 for CC genotype) or additive models (r-fold increase for CT, 2r-fold for CC genotype). All models apart from the dominant model show significant association to severe infection with the recessive model having the largest odds ratio. In particular, under the multiplicative model, the carriers of the C allele showed a threefold increase in risk for severe infection compared with carriers of the T allele (multiplicative model P-value ¼ 7.936 Â 10 À 4 , odds ratio ¼ 3.42, 95% confidence interval 1.63-7.17). Under the recessive model, homozygotes for the C allele were estimated to have a larger, sixfold greater risk for severe infection compared with heterozygotes and homozygotes for the T allele (recessive Elevated serum levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in patients with CC genotype. Together these analyses suggest that the CC variant does not increase the chance of initial virus infection but is associated with severity of the illness, although a larger study including another population is required to prove this definitively. The cytokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) is elevated in several viral infections and levels were raised in the lungs of IFTIM3 knockout mice after influenza virus infection 4 . When we grouped the patients by IFTIM3 genotype, we found significantly elevated serum levels of MCP-1 in the patients with the CC genotype compared with patients with CT or TT genotype (P ¼ 0.002) (Fig. 2a) . We also found a higher level of influenza A pH1N1/09-specific antibodies in patients with the CC genotype (P ¼ 0.04) (Fig. 2b) . These data indicate that the CC genotype is associated with a more overt immune response possibly due to higher viral (antigen) load. We did not observe any significant differences in T-cell responses, measured by interferon-gamma ELISpot assays with peptides spanning the whole virus proteome, between patients with and without the CC genotype (Fig. 2c ).
