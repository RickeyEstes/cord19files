Lack of SLC Expression in plt Mice. The expression pattern of SLC mRNA and protein in normal mice has been determined (22, 23) . To examine the expression of SLC in plt mice, in situ hybridization on tissue sections was performed using 35 S-labeled SLC antisense riboprobe. No SLC mRNA was detected in any tissue of plt mice, includ- ing LN, spleen, PP, thymus, and lymphatic endothelium, whereas the location and abundance of SLC mRNA was normal in the same tissues of ϩ/ϩ mice (Fig. 1 , A-F, and data not shown). Northern blot analysis of total RNA from peripheral LNs and spleen confirmed the complete absence of SLC transcripts in plt mice (Fig. 1 G) . Decreased Accumulation of DCs in the T Cell Zones of plt Mice. plt mice have a defect in the homing of naive T cells that leads to a marked decrease in the number of these cells in the T cell zones of LNs, PPs, and spleen. The finding that SLC is not expressed in plt mice strongly supports the hypothesis that SLC is required for naive T cell homing. Like naive T cells, activated DCs migrate to the T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs. Therefore, we examined the distribution of DCs in plt mice. By FACS ® analysis, DC numbers were decreased 60% in the LNs of plt mice (Fig. 2 A) . The average number of total I-A ϩ DCs in the pooled LNs of ϩ/ϩ mice was 24.5 Ϯ 4.7 ϫ 10 3 per mouse compared with 9.1 Ϯ 2.4 ϫ 10 3 in plt mice (P Ͻ 0.01, n ϭ 3). Immunohistochemistry established that this decrease was most pronounced in the deep cortex. Those DCs that were present in plt mice typically clustered in the internodular cortex (Fig. 3, A and B ). In the spleens of plt mice, the total number of DCs was normal (Fig. 2 B) , but there was a striking abnormality in cell distribution (Fig. 3) . Staining with anti-CD11c revealed a marked decrease in the number of DCs within the white pulp (Fig. 3 , C and D). There was a concomitant increase in the number of DCs located outside the white pulp, either in bridging channels or in isolated clusters within the red pulp, such that the total number of splenic DCs remained normal. Staining with NLDC-145, which in the spleen is specific for interdigitating DCs (34) , also revealed a decrease in the number of these cells within the white pulp and demonstrated that those DCs outside the white pulp were NLDC-145 negative (Fig. 3, E and F) . Decreased Migration of DCs into T Cell Zones of plt Mice. Interdigitating DCs in the T cell zones of LNs arise from DCs in the periphery which migrate to this area via the lymph after activation. To determine if the paucity of interdigitating cells observed in plt mice was due to a defect in the migration of DCs to LNs, we examined this migration after contact sensitization. 24 h after skin painting with 2 mg FITC, the frequency of FITC ϩ cells in the draining LNs of plt mice was markedly reduced compared with ϩ/ϩ mice (Fig. 4 A) . The identity of these cells as DCs was confirmed by their characteristic forward and side scatter profiles, their staining with anti-CD11c (Fig. 4 B) and anti-I-A (Fig. 4 C) , and their low buoyant density. A comparison of eight FITC-painted plt mice with controls at 24 h revealed a 75% decrease in the number of FITC ϩ DCs in draining LNs (Fig. 4 D) . To ensure that the FITC signal in draining LNs was due to the migration of DCs rather than FITC accumulation within the LNs, we performed unilateral contact sensitization with low dose (0.2 mg) FITC and compared contralat-eral and draining LNs. In this procedure, resident (FITC Ϫ ) DCs can be distinguished from newly migrated (FITC ϩ ) DCs (35) . 24 h after skin painting, contralateral and draining LNs contained similar numbers of FITC Ϫ DCs in both ϩ/ϩ and plt mice (Fig. 4 E) . Similar to results shown above, the number of resident DCs was decreased 60% in plt mice. The draining LNs of painted mice demonstrated accumulation of FITC ϩ I-A ϩ cells. In plt mice, the number of these newly migrated FITC ϩ DCs was decreased 73% compared with ϩ/ϩ mice (29.5 Ϯ 11 ϫ 10 3 vs. 8.1 Ϯ 5.7 ϫ 10 3 , P ϭ 0.011, n ϭ 5). To determine if the decreased accumulation of DCs in the LNs of plt mice was secondary to a decreased number of resident skin DCs, abdominal epidermis of ϩ/ϩ and plt mice was stained with anti-I-A (Fig. 5, A and B) . There was no significant difference in the density, morphology, or distribution of I-A ϩ DCs in the epidermis of untreated plt and ϩ/ϩ mice. The average number of I-A ϩ epidermal cells in ϩ/ϩ mice was 14 Ϯ 2.1 per high power field (HPF) compared with 15.5 Ϯ 2.8 in plt mice. We also examined the migration of splenic DCs upon activation. Mouse spleen normally contains a population of interdigitating DCs located within the T cell zone and a separate population of DCs located in marginal zone bridg- ing channels and red pulp (30, 36, 37) . Treatment of mice with LPS has been shown to cause a rapid decrease in the number of DCs located in bridging channels and red pulp and a simultaneous increase in the number of interdigitating DCs (38) . This has led to the hypothesis that splenic DCs outside the T cell zone represent an immature population that migrates to the T cell zone upon activation. 6 h after intraperitoneal injection of LPS, spleens of ϩ/ϩ mice demonstrated intense staining of DCs within T cell zones but few DCs in bridging channels or red pulp (Fig. 5 C) . By contrast, the number of interdigitating cells in the splenic T cell zones of plt mice did not increase after LPS treatment. Most DCs remained scattered throughout the red pulp (Fig. 5 D) . Normal DC Migration out of Epidermis in plt Mice. SLC is expressed (and therefore has the potential to mediate DC migration) at two points along the migration route of DCs from skin to LNs: in lymphatic endothelium and within the T cell zone. To determine if plt mice have a defect in the peripheral mobilization of DCs, we examined the migration of DCs out of cultured skin. Similar to our findings in abdominal epidermis, dorsal ear epidermis from plt mice contains a normal number of DCs (Fig. 6 E) . When segments of dorsal ear skin were placed in culture, the number of DCs within the epidermis of ϩ/ϩ and plt mice decreased to a similar extent over 72 h (Fig. 6, A, B , and E). Over the same time period, the number of DCs within the dermis increased similarly in plt and ϩ/ϩ mice (not shown). As described previously (31) , migrating DCs formed cords within the dermal lymphatics of ϩ/ϩ mice (Fig. 6 C) . A similar formation of cords was seen in plt mice (Fig. 6 D) , demonstrating that the plt mutation does not inhibit the entry of DCs into lymphatics. When the cells migrating out of dorsal ear skin were collected over 72 h and counted, the number of DCs released from the skin of plt and ϩ/ϩ mice was similar (Fig. 6 F) . Decreased Expression of ELC in plt Mice. ELC is the chemokine most closely related to SLC. ELC and SLC have similar activities; both activate the CCR7 receptor, and their genes are located within 100 kb of each other in the human genome (24, 39, 40) . In contrast to SLC, ELC expression is limited to interdigitating DCs in LNs and spleen (41) . To determine if the decreased accumulation of DCs in plt mice leads to a decrease in the production of ELC, we examined ELC expression in plt mice. By Northern analysis, ELC mRNA levels in the LNs and spleen of plt mice were reduced compared with ϩ/ϩ mice (Fig. 7 E) . By in situ hybridization, ELC expression was reduced in the LNs of plt mice compared with ϩ/ϩ mice (Fig. 7, A  and B) . ELC antisense probes hybridized most strongly to the outer LN cortex in a region corresponding to the area in which DCs accumulated in plt mice (compare Fig. 7 B  and Fig. 3 B) . In the spleens of plt mice, ELC expression was also reduced (Fig. 7, C and D) . As in LNs, the hybridization signal in plt spleen localized to regions that correspond to the area in which DCs accumulated (compare Fig.  7 D and Fig. 3 D) . Similar to results in ϩ/ϩ mice, no ELC signal was detected in lymphatics or any nonlymphoid tissue of plt mice (data not shown). plt Mice Have Decreased Resistance to Viral Infection. The entry of lymphocytes and DCs into T cell zones is likely to be a critical step in the development of a primary immune response. Because plt mice have defects in lymphocyte and DC migration, they are predicted to be deficient in mounting such a response. To evaluate the response of plt mice to viral infection, these mice were infected with MHV administered by intraperitoneal injection. plt mice demonstrate a markedly enhanced sensitivity to viral infection (Fig. 8) . At a dose of 20 PFU, which causes no mortality in wild-type mice, 80% of the infected plt mice died. The LD 50 for MHV in wild-type mice was calculated to be 1,840 PFU. In plt mice the LD 50 for MHV was 5.67 PFU, a 300-fold decrease. SLC Introns and Exons Are Intact in plt Mice. Although the plt mutation (29) and the SLC gene (Gunn, M.D., un- published data) map to the same genetic locus on mouse chromosome 4, the molecular basis of the plt mutation has not been identified. To identify the genetic abnormality that leads to a loss of SLC expression in plt mice, we have initiated a search for the plt mutation at the DNA level. The murine SLC gene contains four exons spanning a total of 1 kb (Gunn, M.D., unpublished data). To determine if the plt mutation occurs within SLC introns or exons, overlapping PCR fragments were generated from genomic DNA of both plt and ϩ/ϩ mice. Comparison of plt and ϩ/ϩ sequence over a 3-kb region extending from 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site to 1 kb downstream of the polyadenylation signal revealed several single base changes but no mutation that would account for a loss of SLC expression (data not shown). Thus, while the plt mutation is located in the proximity of the SLC gene, it is not within SLC introns or exons.
