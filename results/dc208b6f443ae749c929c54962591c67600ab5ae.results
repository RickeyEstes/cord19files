In the first 10 days of the equine influenza outbreak in Australia, horses on 197 premises were infected. Of the 1052 horse movements in the contact-tracing dataset, 978 occurred during the first 10 days of the epidemic, with 300 originating from infected premises. Only 70 of these horse movements were to subsequently infected premises with appropriately corresponding dates of movement and onset on the originating and destination premises. These infected horse movements (Fig. 1) were all backwards traced, and covered the 10 days prior to the complete implementation of movement restrictions. The median distance that infected horses were moved was 123 km (range 4-579 km).
