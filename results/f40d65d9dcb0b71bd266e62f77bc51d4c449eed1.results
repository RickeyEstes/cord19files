Here we describe the predicted incidence of hepatitis A in Canada under various vaccination scenarios in the US, and for various volumes of travel to the US. The adjusted incidence values reported here are the predicted incidence of reported cases adjusted for subclinical infection and under-reporting. Hence, the adjusted incidence represents the true incidence of all HA infections. If reported incidence were plotted instead, the qualitative results would be the same and the quantitative results would be similar except for a scaling due to the adjustment for underreporting and subclinical infection. Figure 3 shows the adjusted incidence in Canada at the equilibrium state of the dynamic model as a function of vaccination coverage in the 0-4 age class in the US. As the vaccine coverage in the US increases, the adjusted HA incidence in Canada decreases significantly. For instance, universal vaccination in the US at 70% coverage in the 0-4 age class causes a 21% decline in the adjusted Canadian incidence, across all age classes. Hence, this allows us to infer that approximately 21% of Canadian incidence was attributable to travel in the United States, in the years for which the model was parameterized (1980 to 1994). Implementing a universal vaccination programme in the US soon shows its effects in Canadian incidence. Figure 4 shows the adjusted incidence in the US and Canada when, initially, there is no vaccination in either country, but in 1995, a strategy of vaccinating 70% of children in the US in the 0-4 age class begins. Within a few years of the start of the US vaccination programme, adjusted incidence has also declined in Canada significantly. The choice of 1995 as the year that vaccination begins is motivated by the fact that 1994 was the last year before HA vaccine became widely available in the US and Canada. We also note that the model was parameterized using data from 1980 (the earliest year of availability for certain data) to 1994 inclu- Figure 5 shows the adjusted US and Canadian incidence, stratified by age class, before and after implementing universal vaccination in 1995 at 70% coverage in the 0-4 age class in the US. In the US, incidence declines rapidly not only in the 0-4 age class, but also in the other unvaccinated age classes due to the indirect protective effects of herd immunity. Likewise, incidence declines in all age classes in Canada upon initiation of universal vaccination in the US. Similarly, the effect of an instantaneous 50% increase in the US adjusted incidence in 1995 is soon reflected in a 10% increase in Canadian incidence ( Figure 6 ). Although this scenario of such a rapid increase in incidence is only hypothetical, the example serves to illustrate how closely coupled the countries are. The time difference between the US peak and the Canadian peak in Figure 5 is about 14 days. As noted already, the observed time delay between outbreaks of hepatitis A in gay men in New York with outbreaks in gay men in Montreal is 1-2 months (Vladimir Gilca, INSPQ, pers. comm.). Other scenarios where the effects of fluctuating US incidence on Canadian incidence are studied, such as sinusoidal variation in the US, give rise to lags between US and Canadian incidence peaks of approximately 2 months. As the annual volume of travel by Canadian residents to the US increases, the adjusted incidence in Canada also Adjusted incidence by age classes in the US (top) and Canada (bottom) upon initiation of a universal vaccination pro-gramme in the US at 70% coverage in all age classes in 1995 Adjusted incidence in Canada versus US vaccination coverage (in the 0-4 age class), at the equilibrium state of the model dynamics Figure 3 Adjusted incidence in Canada versus US vaccination coverage (in the 0-4 age class), at the equilibrium state of the model dynamics. The adjusted incidence is the reported incidence adjusted for asymptomatic infection and under-reporting.

The adjusted incidence in Canada when there is no travel to the US is 22% less than the adjusted incidence in Canada at the actual volume of travel in 1995 (indicated in Figure  7 ). Hence, approximately 22% of infected individuals in Canada in 1995 may have acquired the disease through travel to the US, insofar as Equation 1 is correct. i.e., the combination of parameters and such that the incidence can be reduced most quickly.
