We estimate the number of cases that should be reported in Wuhan by January 11, 2020, is 4,094 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3,980 -4,211) and 58,153 (95% CI: 56,532 -59,811) by February 13, 2020. Figure 1 shows how the estimated number of cases in Wuhan increases over time, together with the 95% confidence bands. As shown in Figure 2 , the reporting rate has grown rapidly from 1.41% (95% CI: 1.37% -1.45%) on January 20, 2020, to 61.89% (95% CI: 60.17% -63.66%) on February 13, 2020. The date of first infection is estimated as November 30, 2019. .
