The Table 5 shows the zones of inhibition for the individual ingredients in the phenol-rich compound that were used against P. aeruginosa and that produced a greater inhibition of Pseudomonas spp. than distilled water did. Table 6 shows that the phenol-rich compound sweet gel produced a greater inhibition of Pseudomonas spp. than cloxacillin did. Also, the table shows that phenol-rich compound sweet gel had a greater inhabitation had a greater inhabitation on Pseudomonas spp. than the individual ingredients did an indication of synergic effects.
