Rational design of anti-ZIKV peptide Z2. First, we aligned the amino-acid sequence of ZIKV E protein with that of the corresponding fragment in the stem region of DENV E protein, which represents the basis for the design of anti-DENV peptides [27] [28] [29] . We next aligned these sequences with those in the E proteins of other flaviviruses, including Japanese encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus (YFV) and West Nile virus. We found that the sequence in this region is highly conserved among flaviviruses with amino-acid sequence conservation of 64 to 82% ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1 ), implying that this region may play important roles in flavivirus infection. Finally, we located this region in the 3.8 Ã… resolution cryo-electron microscope structure of ZIKV (Protein Data Bank: 5IRE) 30 , as shown in pink in Fig. 1b , and it was confirmed as the membrane-proximal stem region of ZIKV E protein (residues 421-453), and this was then used as the basis for the design and synthesis of peptide Z2 and the scrambled peptide of Z2 (Z2-scr).
