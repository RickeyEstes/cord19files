cDNA was constructed that encompassed the entire IBV genome The cloning strategy for a full-length IBV-Beaudette construct is illustrated in Fig. 1A . Five RT-PCR fragments were produced that cumulatively amplified the entire genome of the Vero cell adapted Beaudette IBV strain. Amplicons, overlapping by about 10 nucleotides, were designated A through E and the fragment lengths were as follows; A, 2269 nts; B, 6356 nts; C, 6895 nts; D, 5030 nts; and E, 7058 nts (Fig. 1B) . However, consistent with the report that these regions were toxic or unstable in bacteria, difficulties arose in cloning the B and C fragments into bacterial plasmid based cloning vectors (Casais et al., 2001) . Therefore, the B and C fragments were each cloned as two smaller fragments B1 and B2, and C1 and C2. Fragments A through C2 were cloned into the pSMART vector and fragments D through E2 were cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO cloning vectors. In order to determine the consensus sequence of the genome, two to five independent clones of each amplicon were sequenced using a panel of internal primers. Clones with consensus sequences were used for in vitro assembly of full-length cDNA template. There were several sequence differences, distributed throughout the entire genome of IBV, between our standard cell adapted IBV strain and the published Beaudette sequence (Table 1 ). The standard parental strain of IBV Beaudette used for these studies had a five nucleotide insertion at position 25,414 between the M and 5a ORFs, resulting in a genome size of 27,613, instead of 27,608 nt. The sequence differences were confirmed by sequencing three independent clones and direct sequencing of RT-PCR products. A nucleotide insertion was found in an intergenic sequence of our strain compared to the original published sequence. In addition, an E amplicon with a single unique nucleotide change of A to G at position 25,793 nt, resulting in amino acid change from Q to R, was used as a marker for the molecular clone. Full-length cDNA was in vitro assembled with amplicons conforming with our established consensus sequence. To increase full-length in vitro ligation efficiency, ordered ligation reactions were used. The appropriately sized ligation reaction products were purified from 1% agarose gels before further ligating with neighboring inserts (Fig. 1C) .
