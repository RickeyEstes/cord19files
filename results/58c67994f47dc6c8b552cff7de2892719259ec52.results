Preparation of the SAIL sample of the SARS-CoV NP CTD The preparation of proteins composed of SAIL amino acids requires cell-free expression to efficiently incorporate the SAIL amino acids into the protein without them being affected by metabolic scrambling in living cells. The expression of the SARS-CoV NP CTD was initially examined in a small-scale reaction (Fig. 1b) . Subsequently, the 1 H-15 N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) of the 15 N-labeled SARS-CoV NP CTD produced by cell-free expression was compared with that produced by in vivo expression. These spectra were identical, thus confirming that the structures of the proteins produced by cell-free and in vivo expressions are identical (data not shown). The final sample of the SAIL SARS-CoV NP CTD was produced by using the Escherichia coli cell-free protein synthesis system, with optimizations for the production of labeled NMR samples. 9 The SAIL method improves the quality of the NMR spectrum The 1 H-13 C constant time (CT) HSQC spectra of an aliphatic region were compared between uniformly labeled (UL) and SAIL samples under the same conditions. In the case of the UL sample, the signals were prone to overlap between diastereotopic pairs, and some signals were severely broadened beyond detection in the methylene region (Fig. 2a) . In contrast, the corresponding spectrum from the SAIL sample had much better quality than that from the UL sample (Fig. 2b) . The signal/noise ratios for the SAIL sample were several times higher than those for the corresponding UL sample, consistent with previous results for calmodulin-and maltodextrin-binding proteins (Fig. 2c) . 8 For the SARS-CoV NP CTD, the number of peaks to be observed theoretically in the 1 H-13 C CT HSQC spectra, including methyl, methylene, and methane protons, decreased from 517 for the UL sample to 343 for the SAIL sample, greatly simplifying the analytical process. For the aromatic region, improvement due to the use of the SAIL method was even more striking. The aromatic rings of UL Phe and Tyr contain four and five 13 C-1 H pairs, respectively (Fig. 3a) . In the case of SAIL, the six-membered aromatic rings are labeled by alternating 13 C-1 H and 12 C-2 H moieties ( 13 C at the ε and γ positions; 12 C at the δ and ζ positions) (Fig. 3b) . 10 In the UL sample, signals for the 1 H-13 C moieties at the δ, ε, and ζ positions of Phe, and at the δ position of Tyr, are overlapped around 131 ppm in the carbon dimension, thus resulting in severe spectral crowding (Fig. 3c ). In contrast, the corresponding region for the SAIL sample was much simpler due to the presence of Comparisons of NMR spectra for the SARS-CoV NP CTD between UL and SAIL in the methylene region.

The peak scales are identical between the UL and SAIL spectra. signals exclusively from the 1 H-13 C moieties at the ε position of Phe. The short relaxation times led to the detection of resonances that were severely broadened beyond detection with the UL sample (Fig. 3d ). Since one-bond 13 C-13 C couplings in the UL protein did not exist in the SAIL protein, as shown in the Tyr Hε-Cε region ( Fig. 3e and f) , the CT technique with a long evolution time (∼17 ms) is thus not required for the SAIL sample. 10 With the benefits mentioned above, we were able to acquire a set of NMR spectra with high sensitivity, and the expected chemical shifts were assigned to 91.2% completeness for the SAIL sample.
