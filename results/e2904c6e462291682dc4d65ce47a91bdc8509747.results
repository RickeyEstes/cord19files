The miRNomes in control and PRRSV-infected swine lung tissues. MPSS (massively parallel signature sequencing) was used to analyze the miRNomes of three mock-infected and three PRRSV-infected lung tissue samples. The abundance value of each known miRNA was normalized using transcripts per million (TPM) in each small RNA library. The results showed that in normal lung tissues, 76.5% of miRNAs were poorly expressed (< 10 TPM), 19 .1% of miRNAs were modestly expressed (10-1000 TPM), and 3.59% of miRNAs showed moderately high expression (1000-10000 TPM), whereas only 0.79% of miRNAs were highly expressed (>10000 TPM). In infected lung tissues, 74.4% of miRNAs were poorly expressed (<10 TPM), 20.67% of miRNAs were modestly expressed (10-1000 TPM), and 4.13% of miRNAs showed moderately high expression (1000-10000 TPM), whereas only 0.78% of miRNAs were highly expressed (>10000 TPM). In total, seventy-two expressed miRNAs had TPM < 10000 and â‰¥ 1.0-fold change, and several selected miRNAs (TPM >100 and fold >1.5) were used for further analysis (Table 1) .
