A total of five horses met the inclusion criteria. All cases were positive for ECoV using fecal RT-PCR and were negative for the other enteric pathogens tested. The median age was nine years (range 8e13 years); all horses were geldings. Breeds included 2 Quarter Horses, 1 Arabian, 1 Tennessee Walking Horse, and 1 Miniature Horse. Three horses were used for pleasure riding; the use of the remaining two was not recorded. There was no history of recent travel for 4 horses; travel was not recorded for the fifth horse. Two cases presented in the spring, two during winter, and one in the summer. Based on history, none of these cases were associated with other confirmed cases of ECoV. The presenting complaints on admission were similar among all cases and included anorexia (5/5), fever (5/5), diarrhea (high volume and frequency of watery feces; 4/5) and lethargy (3/5) . Colic (2/5) and soft feces (1/5) were also noted. Physical examination parameters and abnormalities observed on blood work, at or within 24 hours of admission (Table 1) . Transabdominal ultrasonography was performed in all horses at admission: two horses had increased colonic wall thickness (colonic wall measurement >0.5 cm) and one had a fluid-filled large colon. Commonly used treatments included flunixin meglumine (4/5; 0.5e1.1 mg/kg every 12 or 24 hours, intravenously), di-trioctahedral smectite (3/5; 0.5e1.8 g/kg every 8, 12, or 24 hours, orally) (Biosponge; Platinum Performance, Buellton, CA), fluid therapy (3/5; 50e100 mL/kg every 24 hours intravenously or orally) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (3/5; 30 mg/kg every 12 hours orally). Other treatments used more sporadically include: metronidazole (1/5; 15 mg/kg every 8 hours orally or per rectum), calcium gluconate 23% (1/5; 15e25 mL/L of fluids intravenously), dextrose 50% (1/5; 50e100 mL/L of fluids intravenously), magnesium sulfate 50% (1/5; 1e2 mL/L of fluids intravenously), potassium chloride ( Table 1 Physical examination parameters and blood work abnormalities (median (range)) observed in all ECoV-positive cases at or within 24 hours of admission. were hospitalized for a median of five days (range 4e18 days) and all survived to discharge.
