Population description. Overall, 405 children with pneumonia, accounting for 3,338 hospitalization days, were included. Among them, 235 (58.0%) were male. Median age was 14 months (IQR = 8-27 months). Ninety-six (23.7%) patients came from Lucknow, India, 71 (17.5%) were from Vadu, India, 26 (6.4%) were from Antananarivo, Madagascar, 114 (28.1%) from Bamako, Mali, and 98 (24.2%) from San Lorenzo, Paraguay. The study periods at each site were Patients differed between sites according to median weight-for-height Z score (P = 0.001) and age category (P = 0.007), but did not differ between sites according to HIV seropositivity (P = 0.33) and mortality (P = 0.37). Seventy patients were hypoxemic at admission. Global prevalence of hypoxemia was 17.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 13.9-21.3%). Median SO 2 was 95% (IQR = 92-97%), without differences between countries (from 95% [IQR = 87-96%] in Mali to 96% [IQR = 89-98%] in Vadu, India, P = 0.14). Table 1 compares the characteristics of hypoxemic and nonhypoxemic patients. HIV prevalence was 1.0% (N = 3). Median weight-for-height Z score was _ 1.1 (IQR = _ 2.4; +0.1). Median length of hospital stay was 7 days (IQR = 4-10 days). Median CRP level at admission was 24 mg/L (IQR = 6-90 mg/L), median white blood cell count was 12,600 × 10 9 cells/L (IQR = 1,000-25,000 × 10 9 cells/L), and median neutrophil proportion was 47% (IQR = 28-64%). Median PCT level at admission was 1.9 ng/mL (IQR = 0.3-8.1 ng/mL), with mean of 15.6 ng/mL (minimum: 0.05, maximum: 585.5 ng/mL). Overall, 70.5% tested positive for urinary antibiotics at admission. Among the 402 (99.3%) patients given antibiotics during hospitalization for a median duration of 7 days (IQR = 5-10 days), 298 (74.5%) received monotherapy, with some also getting multiple antibiotic lines. The main drugs were ceftriaxone (N = 135, 26.0%), amoxicillin (N = 120, 23.1%), ampicillin (N = 51, 9.8%), amoxicillin/sulbactam (N = 36, 6.9%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (N = 35, 6.7%), oxacillin (N = 35, 6.7%), and vancomycin (N = 22, 4.2%). Microbiological agents associated with hypoxemia in children with pneumonia. Hypoxemic (N = 70) and nonhypoxemic (N = 335) pneumonia cases did not differ by median number of bacteria (1 versus 1, respectively, P = 0.85) or viruses detected (1 versus 1, respectively, P = 0.72) in nasal swabs/aspirates. Infection types (bacterial/viral/mixed) did not differ in hypoxemic and non-hypoxemic patients (P = 0.96). Table 2 reports the microbiological agents linked with hypoxemia. Univariate analysis disclosed that hMPV and RSV detection in nasal samples was associated with increased risk of hypoxemia (P = 0.04 and 0.008, respectively). After adjustment on age, center, and calendar time, microorganisms independently associated with heightened risk of hypoxemia were hMPV (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1-5.3) and RSV (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.0-5.8). Median SO 2 was lower in RSV-and hMPV-positive patients than in -negative patients but not different between RSV-and hMPV-positive patients ( Figure 1 ). Pneumococcus serotypes 6AB and 10A from respiratory samples were more frequent in hypoxemic than in non-hypoxemic patients (22.9% versus 9.5%, respectively, P = 0.002; 7.1% versus 1.5%, respectively, P = 0.006). The distribution of other serotypes was not significantly different in hypoxemic and non-hypoxemic children (Supplemental Figure 1) . Clinical and para-clinical presentation in children with hypoxemic pneumonia. Hypoxemic patients differed from non-hypoxemic patients according to age (P = 0.02), history of common cold/pharyngitis (P < 0.001), receipt of one dose of pentavalent vaccine (P < 0.001), breathing rate (P = 0.009), blood pressure (P < 0.01), chest indrawing (P = 0.02), cyanosis (P = 0.003), conjunctivitis (P = 0.01), rasping (P = 0.03), radiological presentation (P = 0.009), mean white blood cell count (P < 0.001), and PCT (P < 0.001) at admission ( Table 1) . LR+ of lower chest indrawing was 2.3 (95% CI = 1.1-4.9), and LR-was 0.9 (95% CI = 0.8-0.95). LR+ of cyanosis was 2.4 (95% CI = 1.4-4.1) and LR _ was 0.7 (95% CI = 0.5-0.99). Other signs and symptoms were less predictive of hypoxemia (data not shown). Hypoxemic patients differed from non-hypoxemic patients in mean white blood cell count (P = 0.001) and PCT at admission (P = 0.03) but not regarding CRP level. Factors associated with death. Fourteen (3.5%) patients died during hospital stay. Among them, 13 died within 14 days after hospital admission. The mortality rate was 8.6% in hypoxemic and 2.4% in non-hypoxemic patients (P = 0.01). Eight deceased patients were not hypoxemic at admission. Among them, the causes of death were multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (N = 4), acute respiratory distress syndrome with septic shock (N = 2), severe pneumonia in HIV (N = 1), and cardiac arrest (N = 1). Table 3 reports the microbiological, clinical, and paraclinical findings associated with death on univariate Cox analysis. Streptococcus pneumoniae detection by blood PCR, hypoxemia, and PCT ³ 50 ng/mL at admission were associated with increased risk of death (log-rank test: P = 0.003, P = 0.002, and P < 0.0001, respectively, Figure 2A -C). Other characteristics or microorganisms, including S. pneumoniae in respiratory samples, were not significantly associated with death ( Supplemental Tables 1 and 2) . No Figure 2 ). In addition, S. pneumoniae detection by blood PCR was associated with increased risk of death (aOR = 4.0, 95% CI = 1.3-12.4), independently of hypoxemia at admission (aOR = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.4-12.8).
