Localization of Pn/ membrane glycoproteins expressed using a T7 transient expression system We used a vaccinia T7 transient expression system to compare PTV glycoprotein localization with that observed with a recombinant vaccinia virus in several cell lines. This transient expression system is based on infection of the cells with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and subsequent transfection with the plasmid DNA containing the gene to be expressed under control of the T7 promoter. Transcription of the gene is mediated by the T7 polymerase produced in the cytoplasm by the recombinant vaccinia virus (Fuerst et a/., 1986) . We used a modification of the system by cloning the genes of interest into pGEM-3, pGEM-3Z, or pGEM-4Z plasmids under the control of a T7 promoter, but lacking a transcriptional termination sequence (Pattnaik and Wertz, 1990) . The pGEM-G plasmid, which contains the PTV Gl and G2 coding sequence under control of the T7 promoter, was initially used to investigate the expression and localization of the glycoproteins (Fig.  1) . It was found that the Gl and G2 glycoproteins were expressed, cleaved, and glycosylated in the transfected cells as detected by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE (not shown), indicating that expression and processing of the Gl and G2 proteins occurred efficiently using the T7 expression system. HeLa T4+ cells retained relatively normal morphology for over 24 hr post-transfection while expressing high levels of the Gl and G2 glycoproteins. The localization of the Gl and G2 proteins was found to be in a perinuclear Golgi pattern, as observed previously in vaccinia recombinant W-G-infected cells (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, a similar pattern of Golgi localization of the proteins was also detected in the Vero, HeLa, or BHK cell lines when the proteins were expressed by the T7 transient system at early time points post-transfection. Thus, the Golgi targeting of PTV glycoproteins occurs using various cell types and expression systems, and either the T7 transient expression system or the vaccinia recombinant system can be used to study the targeting of glycoprotein constructs.
