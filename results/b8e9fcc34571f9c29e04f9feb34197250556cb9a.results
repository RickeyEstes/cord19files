PfCSP-SAPN-induced antibodies are predominantly Th2 skewed and bind Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites Recently published findings have found that self-assembling protein nanoparticles containing peptide sequences (NANP) 4 from the central repeat region of the circumsporozoite protein of P. falciparum induced antibody that was able to sterilely protect mice against lethal challenge [11] . These studies, which looked at the immune response against human malaria P. falciparum CSP, were possible to do in a murine model using a transgenic Plasmodium berghei sporozoite that has had the full-length circumsporozoite protein (csp) gene replaced with that of P. falciparum [22] . Thus, PfCSP-SAPN induced antibodies derived in mice are specific for the CSP protein of the human parasite, P. falciparum. As IgG1 is a known stimulator of C' [23] , it was undertaken here to demonstrate if the SAPN-induced antibodies were of a particular isotype and if the classical pathway of C' was involved in protection. Examination of the antibody isotype profiles derived from SAPN-immunization show a significant predominance of anti-CSP Th2-type IgG1 antibodies (Figure 1 ). While it was demonstrated that the induction of antibodies that bind to the PfCSP repeat sequence expressed on the genetically modified P. berghei parasite, and to a synthetic amino acid sequence bound to a microtiter plate, it was important to determine if the antibodies induced by the SAPN vaccine also bound to CSP on native P. falciparum sporozoites This was demonstrated by an IFA (Figure 2) . Thus, observing that SAPN-induced antibodies were able to bind P. falciparum sporozoites, and with the understanding that IgG1 is able to induce the C' cascade [23] , the question was whether SAPN-induced antibodies would be able to activate C' and have an effect on P. falciparum sporozoites. PfCSP-SAPN-induced antibodies are able to alter the morphology of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites and prevent invasion into human hepatocytes In order to examine the potential role of antibody-induced C' induction in sporozoite killing, the morphology of P. falciparum sporozoites was examined following coincubation with or without serum containing CSP-specific antibodies derived from PfCSP-SAPN immunization. Within five minutes of co-incubation it was observed that the immune serum hampered or halted sporozoite motility and phase contrast microscopy demonstrated that after five to twenty minutes of co-incubation there were obvious morphological changes between parasites treated with serum from PfCSP-SAPN immunized mice and control sera (Figure 3, Panels A, D) . These changes included the appearance of "blebbing", or bulbous bulges at the apex of the parasites, "hooked" end phenotypes and elongation and thinning of the parasites. Moreover, if EDTA was added to serum to chelate calcium ions, which are required for the induction of the classical but not the alternative pathway of complement, the normal parasite phenotype was maintained ( Figure 3, Panel B) . This indicated, specifically, that the classical pathway of complement was involved in the altered morphology and apparent destruction of parasites by PfCSP-SAPN-induced anti-CSP antibodies. Although not sufficient to prove this pathway is solely or uniquely involved in this process, it is a strong indication as to its importance under these conditions. To confirm that without C' the observed effects on morphology were absent, heat-inactivation of the same serum from PfCSP-SAPN immunized animals was co-incubated with P. falciparum sporozoites. After this treatment no alteration of sporozoite phenotype was observed ( Figure 3 , Panel C). The classical pathway of C' present in sera, moreover, was not able to affect these changes in morphology in the absence of PfCSP-SAPN-induced antibodies (Figure 3 , Panel D), nor did serum from mice immunized with a PvCSP-SAPN [11] presenting the P. vivax CSP repeat peptide, (Figure 3 , Panel E). These findings, collectively, indicate that PfCSP-SAPN antibodies are specifically able to activate and To further examine how SAPN-induced CSP-specific antibodies were able to inhibit P. falciparum parasites a series of inhibition of liver stage development assays (ILSDA) were performed using primary human hepatocytes. As shown in Figure 4 , there was an antibodydependent inhibition of the parasites developing inside the liver cells when sporozoites were exposed to serum from PfCSP-SAPN-immunized mice. This inhibition was not observed when using serum from PvCSP-SAPN or PBS-sham immunized mice. From this test alone it cannot be determined if the resulting reduction of parasites developing inside the liver cells was due to an inhibition of invasion or an impairment of growth after invasion. However, combined with the microscopic observations reported above (Figure 3 ) of sporozoite morphological changes in the presence of PfCSP-SAPN immune sera, this strongly suggests the reduction in parasite 18S RNA in the liver cells was the result of fewer sporozoites invading the cells after exposure to immune sera.
