Using the Bayesian model selection framework described earlier, we evaluate the inference of contact heterogeneity using four common epidemiological metrics: R 0 , the reproductive ratio; r, the epidemic peak size; d, the epidemic duration; and s, the epidemic final size. Given each data type, we consider the posterior probabilities of three network classes (random graphs with degree distributions of Poisson, exponential and scale-free), representing the range of degree heterogeneity (from the fairly homogeneous Poisson to the highly heterogeneous scale-free). We emphasize that we are not attempting here to pin down an exact network, but instead are looking to determine what level of contact heterogeneity is supported by the data, and which individual epidemiological metrics provide the most confidence towards this support.
