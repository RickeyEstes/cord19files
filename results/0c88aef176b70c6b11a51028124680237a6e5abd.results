The study was initiated in December 2016 with a target enrollment of 325 participants over 12 months, based on a power calculation that 304 patients (152 in each arm) would have 80% power to detect a 15% difference in antibiotic prescription between arms. The study was stopped in April 2018 (17 months) due to budgetary constraints. Our study enrolled 191 patients, with 93 (48.7%) randomized to the interventional RP test group and 98 (51.3%) randomized to the usual care control group ( Figure 1 ). There was no statistically significant difference in age, race, or existence of a chronic medical condition between the 2 groups. The complete baseline characteristics of the study participants are summarized in Table 1 . In the RP test group, 53 (57%) patients had 1 or more viruses detected and reported during the ED visit; 8 (9%) additional RP patients had a positive virus result reported after the ED visit (Table 2 ). In the control group, 7 (7%) patients had a virus detected and reported by existing single-organism tests during the ED visit, and an additional 13 (14%) patients had a virus detected via the off-site laboratory multirespiratory pathogen panel after the ED visit. The results from the rapid RP tests were available in <2 hours on average ( Table 2) . The primary and secondary outcome results are shown in Table 3 (Table  4 ). There were no other outcome differences between groups in the post hoc stratified age analysis (Table 4) .
