Six articles were identified and included in this review (Table 2 ) [2, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Four relevant studies estimated the reproductive number [8, [10] [11] [12] . A study of confirmed cases from Wuhan, China estimated the reproductive number to be 1.9 (95% confidence in- [13] [14] [15] . The incubation period is likely similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, but with a wider confidence interval (mean, 4.8 days; 95% CI, 4.2 to 5.5) [16] . Furthermore, it is longer than that of the 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus (median incubation period, 1.4 days; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.8) [17] . Therefore, the evidence reviewed above shows that the current control measures for 2019-nCoV, including a quarantine and observation period of 14 days for suspected cases, can be considered appropriate [10] . The generation time and serial interval of 2019-nCoV are longer than those of the 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus (median generation time, 2.7 days; 95% CI, 2.0 to 3.5; and mean serial interval: range, 2.6 to 3.2) [14, 18] . However, the mean serial interval of 2019-nCoV is similar to that of the SARS coronavirus (mean, 8.4 days; standard deviation, 3.8) [19] . The overall case fatality rate of 2019-nCoV was estimated by international experts to range from 3% to 14% [15, 20] , and it is more likely to cause infection in older age groups with commodities [2] . Epidemiological parameters are usually obtained from a consecutive timeline of the number of reported cases and contact-tracing data. However, most of the studies included in our review made estimates using data obtained from the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, in which the reporting of confirmed cases may have been incomplete. Furthermore, differences in the simulation methodology used in various scenarios may result in a wide spectrum of estimated values [21] . Therefore, caution is needed when interpreting these reported results. The number of confirmed cases is increasing in China and in other countries, including Korea. Furthermore, the likelihood of local transmission is increasing as a result of cases entering from China. In light of a report describing a case of human-to-human transmission in the asymptomatic period [5] , it is necessary to consider updating the case definition for surveillance; however, more detailed studies presenting evidence on the epidemiological nature, clinical presentation, and pathogenesis of 2019-nCoV are necessary to provide information for public health decision-making.
