Construction of a full-length cDNA clone derived from a Vero cell-adapted IBV Beaudette strain by in vitro assembly of five RT-PCR fragments To construct a full-length IBV clone, five fragments (A to E) spanning the entire IBV genome were obtained by RT-PCR of total RNA extracted from Vero cells infected with a Vero cell-adapted IBV Beaudette strain (p65) (Shen et al., 2003 (Shen et al., , 2004 Fang et al., 2005) . To facilitate the assembly of the full-length cDNA in vitro, restriction sites for either BsmBI or BsaI were introduced into both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the fragments (Fig. 1a) . In fragment A, a 19-nucleotide sequence corresponding to the T7 RNA promoter (Table 1) was inserted into the 5′ end of the IBV genome to facilitate in vitro transcription using the T7 polymerase (Fig. 1a) . The primers used to amplify these fragments are listed in Table 1 . The PCR products were purified from agarose gel and cloned into either pCR-XL-TOPO (Invitrogen) or pGEM-T Easy (Promage) vectors. For the convenience of digestion using the restriction enzyme BsmBI, the NheI-and EcoRI-digested fragment A was subcloned into pKT0 which contains a BsmBI site 400 bp upstream of the T7 promoter sequence (Fig. 1a) . Two to three independent clones for each construct were selected for sequencing. The complete sequences of the five fragments, determined by automated nucleotide sequencing, are summarized in Table 2 . The five fragments were then prepared by digestion of the corresponding constructs with either BsmBI or BsaI and purified (Fig. 1b, lanes 2-6) . The full-length clone was made by ligation of the purified fragments in vitro (Fig. 1b, lane 8) and used as the template for in vitro transcription. The fulllength in vitro-synthesized transcripts were generated using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, Tex) (Fig. 1b , lane 10). As coronavirus N gene transcripts were shown to enhance the recovery of the rescued virus from the in vitrosynthesized full-length transcripts (Casais et al., 2001; Youn et al., 2005a Youn et al., , 2005b Yount et al., 2000 Yount et al., , 2002 , the N transcripts were generated from a linearized pKT0-IBVN construct containing IBV N gene and the 3′-UTR region. The full-length transcripts together with the N transcripts were introduced into Vero cells by electroporation. However, it was consistently observed that no infectious virus could be recovered from cells transfected with the full-length transcripts together with the N transcripts.
