Kinetics of CD25 + Nrp-1 hi nTreg and Nrp-1 low iTreg accumulation in the CNS Prior to initiating anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment the kinetics and relative composition of CD25 + and Foxp3 + CD4 + T cells recruited into the CNS were assessed following JHMV infection. CNS accumulation of CD25 + and Foxp3 + CD4 + T cells followed similar patterns throughout infection (Fig. 1A) . Total numbers of both CD25 + CD4 + and Foxp3 + T cells peaked at day 7 post infection (p.i.) comprising ~20% of total CD4 + T cells (Fig. 1) . These populations declined rapidly by day 10 p.i. and stabilized thereafter ( Fig. 1B and C). Importantly, > 75% of CD25 + cells expressed Foxp3 + at day 7 p.i. indicating a minority of ~25% non Treg CD4 + effector cells expressed CD25 ( Fig. 1A and D). These data show that the vast majority of the Foxp3 + population expressed CD25 ( Fig. 1A and D) and this proportion remained stable at 75-80% throughout the infection ( Fig. 1A and D). To distinguish a phenotypic transition of Treg populations, possibly accompanied by differential expression of CD25, nTregs were identified based on high Nrp-1 expression Yadav et al., 2012) . At day 7 p.i., Nrp-1 hi nTreg represented the majority (~75%) of Foxp3 + Treg within the CNS ( Fig. 2A and B ). At day 10 p.i., the frequency of Nrp-1 hi nTreg declined to ~50% and remained stable at all subsequent time points, resulting in an equal proportion of Nrp-1 hi and Nrp-1 low Treg ( Fig. 2A and B ). Similar to the total Foxp3 + population (Fig. 1D ), CD25 expression remained stable at ~75% on both Nrp-1 hi (Fig. 2C ) and Nrp-1 low Treg during the course of infection ( Fig. 2C and D) . These data predicted that the majority of CD25 + Foxp3 + Treg are susceptible to anti-CD25 treatment. Moreover, CD25 treatment at early times during infection was anticipated to primarily target prevailing Nrp-1 hi Treg and only a minor population of CD25 + effector T cells.
