The mechanism of immune proliferation remains unclear. However, using mathematical and experimental models, many theoretical immunologists study the proliferation function to obtain better knowledge related to immune response (Borghans et al., 1999; Wodarz and Jansen, 2001; Wodarz and Thomsen, 2005) . The function might depend on the immune cell type, genetic and physiological factors, and so on. As described herein, we investigate two immune response functions f 1 and f 2 which are not biologically unnatural. The difference of the immune response function strongly affects dynamic behaviors of model (1), as discussed below.
