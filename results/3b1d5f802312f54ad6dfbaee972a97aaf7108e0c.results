The trial included 6266 children (total cohort). After excluding children with no ILI or inadequate samples, 2421 children experienced 3717 ILI episodes (total cohort with ILI episodes tested by multiplex PCR). Participant flow is shown in Supplement Fig. 1 . Demographics were similar in both cohorts, except that children in the total cohort were older (median 55 versus 42 months) (Supplement Table 1 ).
