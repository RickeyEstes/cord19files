Not including anthrax and herpes (to which all individuals had been exposed), the Serengeti lions were exposed to an average of 5 pathogens (two acute and three chronic, SD = 1) with one individual had been infected by 9 of 10 pathogens (based on medium resolution data, Fig. S3 ). Remarkably, cubs between 1 and 2 y.o. had been already infected with an average of 4 pathogens (SD = 1) with one 1.5 y.o cub positive for 5. All lions were qPCR positive for at least one protozoan species, and 25% of them were infected by all four considered.
