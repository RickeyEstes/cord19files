Estimation of average and maximal extension rates of RT synthesis under the alternative divalent cations Optimal extension conditions for HIV RT with Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ , Co 2+ , and Zn 2+ in presence of 100 μM dNTPs were determined on a 425 nt RNA template derived from the gag-pol region of the HIV genome (as described in [20] ). Optimal extension for each cation in the presence of 100 μM of each dNTP was observed at the following concentrations: 2 mM Mg 2+ , 0.4 mM Zn 2+ , 0.4 mM Mn 2+ , and 0.25 mM Co 2+ . Since a total concentration of 400 μM total nts (100 μM each) was used in the assays, the free concentration of each cation for optimal extension was~1.6 mM for Mg 2+ , 0.15 mM for Zn 2 + , 0.15 mM for Mn 2+ , and 0.07 mM for Co 2+ . Note that all 3 alternative cations showed maximal activity at much lower concentrations than Mg 2+ . This suggests that these alternative cations bind more tightly to RT than the physiological cation. Interestingly, we also found that Cu 2+ supported RT catalysis but optimum extension occurred at a much higher concentration of 3 mM (data not shown). Average and maximum extension rates were then calculated as described in Materials and Methods using the RNA template used for round 1 synthesis of the PCR-based lacZα-complementation fidelity assay. As expected, the rate of synthesis was fastest using Mg 2+ and slowest with Zn 2+ (Figure 1 and Table 1 ). An average extension rate of 1.8 ± 0.48 nts/s and a maximal extension rate of 7.4 ± 1.9 nts/s was observed with 2 mM Mg 2+ , whereas with 0.4 mM Zn 2+ , extension rates were 0.03 ± 0.02 nts/s and 0.19 ± 0.10 nts/s, respectively. Both 0.4 mM Mn 2+ and 0.25 mM Co 2+ decreased the average and maximal rate of extension as well (Table 1) . HIV RT shows greater fidelity with Zn 2+ in the PCR-based and plasmid-based lacZα-complementation fidelity assays The PCR-based assay was a modified version of an assay used previously to examine the fidelity of poliovirus 3Dpol [49, 50] (Figure 2 ). The 115 nt region screened for mutations is shown in Figure 2C . The assay is capable of detecting all frameshift mutations and several substitutions (see legend) in this region [51] . The assay essentially mimics the reverse transcription process since both RNA-and DNA-directed RT synthesis steps are performed. Most of the possible background mutations can be accounted for by performing a control in which plasmid DNA is PCR amplified to produce an insert identical to those produced in the complete assay. These inserts should comprise all error sources except the errors derived from HIV RT and T3 RNA polymerase. An average background colony mutant frequency (CMF, number of white or faint blue colonies divided by total colonies) of 0.0019 ± 0.0014 was obtained (Table 2) . This corresponds to 1 white or faint blue colony in everỹ 500 colonies. Further details of this assay are discussed in a recent publication by our group [48] . Using 2 mM Mg 2+ , a CMF value of 0.006 (about 1 mutant colony in every 167 total) was obtained after background subtraction (Table 2) . Results using Co 2+ were similar to Mg 2+ while Zn 2+ increased fidelity about 2.5fold (with high statistical significance). Although Co 2+ is reported to be mutagenic, its effect on the mutation rate of polymerases is concentration-dependent [40, 42, 46] . For example, the error frequency of avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) RT increased from about 1 error per 1680 nt additions with Mg 2+ to 1 error per 1100 nt addition with activating concentrations of Co 2+ (1 mM), but increased further to 1 error per 200 nt addition when excess amounts of Co 2+ were used (5 mM) [40] . Only 0.07 mM free Co 2+ was used in these assays and it is possible that Co 2+ does not have a profound impact on fidelity at this concentration. This was further tested in the gapped plasmid assay described below. A second gapped plasmid-based lacZα-complementation fidelity assay, similar to the phage-based lacZα gapfilling assay, was performed to further confirm results obtained from the PCR-based assay. The gap filled by the polymerase is in a plasmid construct, which after fill in, is directly transfected into bacteria. Bacterial colonies rather than phage plaques are scored by blue-white screening in this assay. This assay screens a large region (288 nts) of the lacZα gene including the promoter sequence and it avoids the enzymatic (T3 RNA polymerase and Pfu polymerase) background issues of the PCRbased assay. The results (Table 3 ) were in strong agreement with the PCR-based assay ( Table 2 ). In this assay, Mg 2+ was modestly more accurate than 0.25 mM Co 2+ , while Zn 2+ once again showed~2.5-fold greater fidelity than Mg 2+ . Interestingly, Mn 2+ , a known pro-mutagenic cation for several polymerases including HIV RT [43] , was comparable to Mg 2+ in the assays when used at its optimal concentration (0.4 mM total and 0.15 mM free). However, both Co 2+ and Mn 2+ were highly mutagenic when used at 6 mM, an amount which is in the same range shown by others to decrease the fidelity of several polymerases in vitro [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] 52] . There was a~25-fold decrease in fidelity with 6 mM Mn 2+ compared to 0.4 mM Mn 2+ . Similarly, a~7-fold decrease in fidelity was observed with 6 mM vs. 0.25 mM Co 2+ . Both cations also showed severely inhibited polymerase activity at the 6 mM concentration while Zn 2+ incorporates only a few nts even after prolonged incubation at high concentrations (see [4] , results with Co 2+ were similar to those shown with Mn 2+ in this report). Overall, the results from both the PCR-based and gapped plasmidbased lacZα-complementation fidelity assays show that the fidelity of RT increases with Zn 2+ and presumed pro-mutagenic cations do not modify RT's error rate significantly when used at low concentrations optimal for catalysis.
