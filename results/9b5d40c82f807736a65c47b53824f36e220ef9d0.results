A total of 40,876 newly diagnosed ARDS patients (67.9% male; mean age 66 years) were enrolled in the study. Among them, 57.8% (n Â¼ 23,612) died during hospitalization. Patients who died during hospitalization were older (69 AE 17 versus 62 AE 19 years, P < 0.001) and more likely to be male (69.8% versus 65.3%, P < 0.001). In addition, patients who died during hospitalization had significantly higher medical costs (6421 versus 5825 US Dollars, P < 0.001) and shorter lengths of stay (13 versus 19 days, P < 0.001) than patients who survived. The most common etiologic comorbidities for ARDS were pneumonia (49.7%), followed by sepsis (33.2%), and trauma (29.9%). Some patients had more than one etiologic comorbidity. There were significant differences in etiology by hospital mortality status ( Table 1 ).
