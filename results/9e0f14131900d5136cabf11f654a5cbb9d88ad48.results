The BM2 TURBS is streamlined into 45nt of RNA essential for termination-reinitiation, containing sequence-specific and sequence-independent elements In RHDV and FCV, TURBS motifs 1 and 2 are separated by some 30 nt, much of which appears to be non-essential [15] [16] [17] 19] . However, given that the minimal sequence requirement for termination-reinitiation of BM2 (,45 nt; [11] ) is shorter than that documented in the caliciviruses (69 and 87 nt; [15, 17, 19] ), we wished to test whether any of the residues were non-essential. To do this, we introduced 6 nt deletions throughout the length of the sequence upstream of the M1 termination codon in the context of the BM2 termination-reinitiation reporter plasmid, p2luc-BM2-204 ( Figure 1A ; [11] ). As expected, translation of the BM2-204 reporter mRNA generated products corresponding to the capdependent upstream product (rlucM1-204 ,36 kDa) and the termination-reinitiation product (BM2fluc ,62 kDa). The latter protein was not observed in translations of the negative control reporter mRNA, p2luc-BM2ps (rluc'M1 ,33 kDa, [11] ), which contains an in-frame stop codon immediately upstream of the TURBS. Significantly, deletion of any part of the minimal required region led to a strong inhibition of BM2fluc synthesis, suggesting that the entire TURBS is required for efficient termination-reinitiation on the segment 7 RNA ( Figure 1A ). Alternatively, it was possible that the defect in BM2 synthesis in this deletion series may be a consequence of the altered spacing between the M1 stop codon and upstream features required for termination-reinitiation. To test this, we selected three of the 6 nt deletion mutants surrounding motif 1 (mutants 6.1, 6.4 and 6.6) and replaced the deleted regions with two different random 6 nt sequences ( Figure 1B ). No restoration of BM2 synthesis was observed with either of the 6.1 nucleotide replacement mutants ( Figure 1B) . Replacement of nucleotides into the 6.4 deletion mutant had no effect with the first of the mutants (6.4r1), but some recovery was observed in the second of these mutants (6.4r2), albeit the frequency of termination-reinitiation was diminished compared to that of the wild-type mRNA ( Figure 1B ). In contrast, insertion of 6 nt back into the 6.6 deletion mutant fully restored BM2 synthesis in both cases ( Figure 1B) . These results suggest that the minimal 45 nt TURBS region is split into both sequencespecific and sequence-independent elements, where the sequence towards the 59 end of the minimal region is important in basespecific interactions, whereas the 39 end of the TURBS may act solely as a spacer, important in placing motif 1 relative to the terminating ribosome. Targeting the 18S rRNA:mRNA interaction using antisense oligonucleotides Termination-reinitiation on the BM2 ORF is likely to be dependent on interactions between the influenza B segment 7 RNA and helix 26 of the 18S rRNA [11] . However, other work has revealed that motif 1 may also be important in eIF3 binding [17] . To investigate the mRNA-18S rRNA interaction further, antisense 2-O-methyl oligonucleotides (AONs) were synthesised that would target either the loop of helix 26 of 18S rRNA ( Figure 2A ) or motif 1 of the BM2 TURBS ( Figure 2B ). Control oligonucleotides were also prepared to target sequences both upstream and downstream of motif 1 to control for potential nonspecific effects on translation ( Figure 2B ). An AON designed to target helix 26 of the 18S rRNA had no effect on BM2 synthesis ( Figure 2A ), although high concentrations (320-fold to 2960-fold molar excess of the AON to the mRNA) inhibited global translation ( Figure 2A and data not shown). Conversely, an AON targeting motif 1 specifically inhibited BM2 synthesis, with little effect on overall translation ( Figure 2B ). Importantly, the upstream and downstream control AONs had little effect on BM2 synthesis or global translation within the range tested for the BM2 motif 1 complementary AON ( Figure 2B ). It should be noted that the 80S ribosome will strip annealed AONs from the mRNA as it translates through the TURBS. However, both the upstream and motif 1 complementary AONs will be able to re-anneal once the ribosome reaches the UAAUG. However, it is possible that any effect of the downstream oligo is masked due to it being unable to reanneal in the presence of the terminating ribosome. Nevertheless, these data indicate that the effect of the BM2 motif 1 complementary AON is specific and not an effect on ribosome processivity, and provide further evidence in support of an interaction between motif 1 and 18S rRNA. However, we cannot rule out that these effects may also be due to perturbations of RNA secondary structure within the TURBS or due to interactions of motif 1 with an unspecified molecule (see later).
