Previous studies have shown that a highly attenuated vector, rVSV IN -N4CT9-Gag1 (hereafter referred to as N4CT9-Gag1), had greatly reduced neurovirulence yet retained potent immunogenicity in mice compared to the prototypic vector, rVSV IN -HIVGag5, hereafter referred to as Gag5 [34] . To better understand virus dissemination following vaccination, we performed a series of studies comparing the tissue distribution of these two vectors in mice, following high dose (10 8 PFU) administration by the IM, IN, or IV routes. The initial study design included tissue harvests on days 0 (4 h post-inoculation), 1, 2, 4, and 8 post-inoculation for viral load assessment; however, because of persistent viral RNA in some tissues at day 8 in the IM study, additional later time points were collected in both the IN and IV studies.
