In 2012 in Bogotá, 288 samples from respiratory secretions were collected in the sentinel surveillance system from patients over 18 years of age. Through randomised sampling, 150 cases of SARI were selected from those respiratory samples (Fig 1) . The medical histories of 99 patients with SARI reported through the surveillance system were examined. These histories were obtained from 7 Bogota hospitals in 2012 according to the following distribution: 45 (45.5%) were from the San Rafael University Hospital Clinic, 23 (23%) were from Fundación CardioInfantil, 10 (10%) were from Suba Hospital, 9 (9.1%) were from El Tunal Hospital, 6 (6%) were from Santa Clara Hospital, 3 (3%) were from San Ignacio University Hospital, and 3 (3%) were from the Occidente de Kennedy Hospital. Of the 99 patients, 8 showed disease progression beyond 14 days and were dismissed from the final analysis (Fig 1) . Of the 91 patients included in the analysis, 50 (55%) were female; the patients' average age was 50.6 years (range, 18 to 95 years). Table 1 shows the most frequent comorbidities identified. The average length of disease progression was 5.1 days, with a minimum duration of hours and a maximum duration of 14 days (Table 2) . Radiographical abnormalities were observed in 65 patients. The following radiological findings of chest images were described in the medical histories, in order of frequency: 32 patients had interstitial infiltrates (35.1%), 27 had alveolar infiltrates (29.6%), 26 had consolidation (28.6%), 21 had multilobar compromise (23.1%), and 19 had pleural effusion at admission (20.9%). Pleural effusion was found in 15.3% of the patients with alveolar infiltrates and 13.2% of the patients with interstitial infiltrates. We Among the SARI patients, 82 (90.1%) were treated with antibiotics; patients received between 1 and 7 antibiotics, with an average of 2.3 antibiotics per patient. Antibiotics were started a median of 1 day after admission (range, 0 to 21 days, 95% CI: 0-7 days). The beta-lactam group was the most frequently used. Oseltamivir was used in 72.5% of cases (66 patients), with a minimum duration of 1 day, a maximum duration of 10 days and an average duration of 4.2 days. Oseltamivir was started a median of 1 day after admission (range, 0 to 21 days, 95% CI: 0-9 days).
