Bat groups and expectations. Group 1 was comprised of 5 bats that were experimentally infected with MARV 24 months previously, group 2 was comprised of 5 bats that were "naturally" infected through contact with the experimentally infected bats 17-18 months previously and group 3 was comprised of 2 negative control bats (Table 1) . Following challenge of groups 1 and 2 with homologous MARV, we expected bats lacking protective immunity to exhibit viremias and viral RNA shedding from the oral mucosa prior to 14 days post challenge (DPC), viral replication in the tissues at necropsy at 21 DPC and a delayed virus-specific IgG immune response not detectable until 14 DPC. While bats possessing protective immunity against MARV reinfection were not expected to exhibit viremias, viral shedding from the oral mucosa or virus replication in the tissues, they were expected to attain robust virus-specific IgG antibody responses by 7 DPC. No evidence of MARV replication or shedding. Consistent with the existence of long-term protective immunity against MARV reinfection, replication and shedding, none of the bats in groups 1 and 2 developed detectable viremias or shed MARV RNA in their oral secretions throughout the 14-day specimen collection period. All tissues, including the axillary lymph node, gonad, liver, salivary gland and spleen, collected from bats in groups 1 and 2 at necropsy on 21 DPC tested negative for MARV RNA. Throughout the study, MARV RNA was not detected in any of the samples collected from group 3 bats. Rapidly-attained immune response. During the previous transmission study, MARV IgG (heavy and light chains) antibody levels for bats in groups 1 and 2 peaked and then rapidly declined falling below the threshold of seropositivity (adjusted sum optical density (OD) â‰¥ 0.95) within 3 months 11 . By the initiation of this study at 0 DPC, MARV IgG antibody levels remained below the threshold of seropositivity for bats in groups 1 (mean adjusted sum OD: 0.39, range: 0.09-0.78) and 2 (mean adjusted sum OD: 0.21, range: 0.09-0.29) (Fig. 1 ). By 7 DPC,
