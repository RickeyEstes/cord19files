586 ILI-patients (median age 5 year, range 1-77) were enrolled from five sites from May 2010 to December 2012; among these, 168 (29%) tested positive for influenza by rRT-PCR (Table 2) . Most frequent symptoms reported were fever (100%, inclusion criterion), cough (100%,), runny nose (90%), congestion (77%), sore throat (75%,) and headache (76%). Although gender distribution was similar in ILI-patients, more females were positive for enterovirus (71%) or rhinovirus (64%). Patients with influenza were slightly older (median age 7 years old) and presented more often with a sore throat (78%). Compared with other ILI-cases, patients testing positive for enterovirus reported body pain (20% vs. 44%) and headache (50% vs. 77%) less frequently, although chills (50% vs. 32%), vomiting (35% vs. 16%) and abdominal pain (29% vs. 19%) were more common. Dyspnea was uncommon, yet most often seen in patients positive for adenovirus (14%). Diarrhea was observed in ILI-patients (6%-12%) except those infected with enterovirus (0/17). Influenza vaccination coverage in 2010 and 2011 approximated 20% in response to the influenza A/pH1N1(2009) pandemic yet decreased to zero in 2012 by subjects' reports. Five (Table 3 and Figs 2 and 3A). Vaccination coverage during the entire study period was 11% (63/583). The probability of developing influenza among ILI-patients who had been vaccinated (20/63) and who had not (148/520) was similar and not significantly different (0.32 vs. 0.28, p = 0.28). All IC 50 -values of influenza A and B isolates tested from 2011 were within the susceptible range for both oseltamivir and zanamivir (Table 3) .
