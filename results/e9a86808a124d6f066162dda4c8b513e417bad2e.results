In RDV method ver3.0, different adaptors were ligated at the 5 and 3 end of viral dsDNA. The ligation enzyme was changed to the ligation mix in the Ligation-convenience kit (Nippon gene) because this increased the efficacy of ligation (data not shown). The S1-S16 forward primers and N1-N16 reverse primers were used in the second cDNA amplification step for direct sequencing (Fig. 2B ). Using the RDV ver3.0, we successfully identified West Nile virus and Dengue virus type 2, which were used in previous our study (data not shown). The RDV ver3.0 method was performed using extracted RNA from the culture supernatant obtained from YOKV-infected Vero cells. The 256 PCR Fig. 3 . Location of viral cDNA fragments on YOKV genome amplified using the RDV ver3.0. Column A shows 10 cDNA fragments expected to be detected in RDV ver3.0 (over 150 bp cDNA fegments digested by Sau3AI and HaeIII). Columns B-E show YOKV cDNA fragments detected in RDV ver3.0. Column B shows 8 of 10 cDNA fragments as shown in A. Column C shows cDNA fragments partially digested with HaeIII or Sau3AI. These cDNA fragments contained undigested sequences by the restriction enzymes. Column D shows amplicons detected as 2 or 3 ligated cDNA fragments. Column E shows cDNA fragments not containing recognition sequences of restriction enzymes at the ends. 11/11 (100) a 2 (2) b S2 21/21 (100) 2 (2) S3 3/3 (100) 0 (0) S4 5/8 (62.5) 0 (0) S5 11/11 (100) 2 (2) S6 18/18 (100) 1 (1) S7 1/3 (33.3) 0 (1) S8 8/11 (72.7) 0 (1) S9 11/11 (100) 0 (0) S10 11/16 (68.7) 0 (0) S11 5/6 (83.3) 0 (0) S12 3/6 (84.17) 0 (0) S13 4/6 (66.6) 1 (1) S14 0/0 0 (0) S15 0/1 (0) 0 (0) S16 5/12 (41.6) 0 (0) Total 118/141 (83.6) 8 (10) a Number of YOKV cDNA fragments/number of sequence DNA fragments (percent). b Number of detected YOKV cDNA fragments of (number of YOKV cDNA fragments expected to be detected from complete nucleotide sequence). products were processed by agarose gel electrophoresis. A total of 141 fragments were sequenced by the direct sequencing method, but sequences of 10 fragments were not obtained. One hundred eighteen exhibited high degrees of homology with the nucleic acid sequence of YOKV. Twenty-two DNA fragments were identified as mammal ribosomal RNAs (data not shown). The locations of the PCR fragments found in the YOKV genome are shown in Fig. 3 . From the complete nucleotide sequences of YOKV, there are 10 cDNA fragments over 150 bp with HaeIII-and Sau3AI-digested ends (Fig. 3 column A), which are expected to be detected using RDV ver3.0, and eight fragments were detected (Table 1 and Fig. 3 column B). Nine were obtained as partial digested viral cDNA fragments by HaeIII or Sau3AI (Fig. 3 column C) . In addition, we found two or three ligated viral cDNA fragments (Fig. 3 column D) and cDNA fragments not containing recognition sequences of restriction enzymes at the ends (Fig. 3 column E). The limit of detection of RDV ver3.0 was approximate 10 4 copies of viral genomic RNA as a starting material when using YOKV (data not shown).
