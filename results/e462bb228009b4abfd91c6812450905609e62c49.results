Between January 2013 and December 2017, a total of 22 847 unique entries were recorded in the database. These included incidents and research related to emerging infections or issues that could affect the emergence or distribution of various infectious diseases. The number of entries varied per year, with an average of 4569.4 (range 2256-5545) per year. Approximately 17-18 entries were added every working day. There was a doubling in entries in 2014 compared to 2013, with 4995 and 2256 entries, respectively, following the onset of the West Africa Ebola outbreak. The number of entries reached a peak in 2015, and then stabilized in 2016 and 2017. A total of 17 234 (75.4%) entries related to a specific country; the remainder were associated with regions or were research articles. Over the study period, 37.4% of records were related to incidents in Africa, followed by Asia (23.9%), North America (16.1%), and Europe (14.5%). The heat map in Figure 1 shows the distribution of database entries by world region where the disease threat occurred using the United Nations geoscheme (United Nations, 2019). Most entries were related to events in West Africa (24%), reflecting the increase in surveillance activities in response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak (2014) (2015) (2016) . Eleven percent of the entries were related to Northern America; a result of updates and travel guidance issued by the US CDC and other official sources, as well as reports of locally acquired Ebola virus and Zika virus disease. The top 10 diseases in terms of number of entries (63.9% overall) are listed in Table 1 . Almost a quarter of all entries were related to Ebola virus. This was followed by Zika virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Vibrio cholerae, and yellow fever virus and undiagnosed morbidity. The top three initial and definitive sources varied considerably by disease.
