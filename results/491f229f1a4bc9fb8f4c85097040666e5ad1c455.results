We obtain estimates of R 0 , the basic reproductive number, by averaging the estimates of R t during the epidemic period. In reality this can be viewed as a pseudo-R 0 given the prior immunity to this strain of influenza. We will refer to it as R 0 throughout the text. We assume that the epidemic period corresponds to the point at which transmission was sustained in Gauteng Province until the overall number of cases peaked. This corresponds to the period between 22 June 2009 and 21 August 2009. Figure 3 and Table 1 show the estimates of R 0 across age groups along with the number of individuals in each age group who were reported infected throughout the epidemic. Regardless of the choice of matrix, supercritical values of R 0 are obtained for those between the age of 5 and 24, with the highest values being observed for those in the 10-14 age-group (R 0 = 1.53 for close contacts). We contrast these estimates with those obtained using contact matrices from Europe [5] . Figures 3a and 3b shows the estimates of R 0 across the 10 age groups obtained when using contact patterns from South Africa and the eight European countries in the PolyMod study for all close contacts (Figure 3a ) and all contacts involving physical touch (Figure 3b ). There are few notable differences between the estimates. In Figure 4 , the mean estimates of R 0 are shown for each age group. We observe a similar overall trend for the estimate of R 0 across the age groups. Finally we provide the overall estimate of R 0 collapsed over all age groups ( Table 2) . For comparison purposes, we first estimate R 0 by using a traditional analysis that assumes homogenous mixing among the age groups (R 0 =1.28, range: 1.26-1.31). This is similar to that obtained for all the other contact matrices considered. Additionally there are virtually no differences observed between results from the two contact matrices. Our first sensitivity analysis, which jitters the onset dates of a subset of the population, (Additional file 1: Table S1 ) provides results that are consistent with the results presented. Not surprisingly, the impact of reassigning onset dates to a portion of the dataset has the impact of flattening the epidemic curve and thus lowering the estimates of R 0 . However the results remain consistent and, coupled with the imputation variability reported, provide insight on the overall variability of the estimates reported. In our second sensitivity analysis (Additional file 2: Table S2 and Additional file 3: Figure S1 ), examining the potential impact of differential reporting by age, we note a Page 5 of 10 http://www.ete-online.com/content/11/1/4 dramatic impact on the results. As we assume a greater underreporting of cases among those who are middle aged, we estimate the bulk of transmission being attributable to those who are older and less transmission being attributed to the very young, a finding contrary to the original results we present.
