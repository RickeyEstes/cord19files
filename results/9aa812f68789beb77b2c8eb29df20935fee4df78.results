Neopterin level raised at early stage of DF patients Serum neopterin concentrations raised in DF patients as early as on the first day of the onset of symptoms (>10 nmol/L), reaching a mean concentration of 48.2 AE 14.1 nmol/L (mean AE SD, range 9.9e83.0 nmol/L) in 150 acute sera (Fig. 1) . The mean neopterin concentration of healthy blood donors was 6.7 AE 2.0 nmol/L (mean AE SD, range 2.8 to 14.5 nmol/L). Thus, the mean neopterin concentration in DF patients exceeded that of the controls by 7.19 fold (P < 0.001). The mean concentration of neopterin in DF patients was slightly higher than that in patients with acute measles infection (36.3 AE 11.5 nmol/L) and nearly threefold higher than that in 40 acute influenza sera (18.8 AE 11.9 nmol/L). The difference between the groups is statistically significant (P < 0.05, Manne Whitney test). Higher neopterin level associated with longer fever period
