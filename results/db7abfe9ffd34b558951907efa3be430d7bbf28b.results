The prospective study A total of 3866 individuals, including 1821 men and 2045 women who were free of AGWs at baseline and who had at least one follow-up visit, were included in the analyzed cohort. Men and women in the analyzed cohort and the full cohort were comparable for most of the demographic and behavioral characteristics, excluding birth cohort and marital status ( Table 1) . The median follow-up time was 12.5 months (interquartile range 12.1-13.1) for males and 12.6 months (interquartile range 12.5-13.0) for females. During the follow-up period, one female at Visit 2 and four females at Visit 3 developed AGWs (Table 2) , and the incidence rate was 2.37/1000 person-years (95% CI: 0.30-4.45) ( Table 3) . None of the males was diagnosed with AGWs during follow-ups in the study period. At baseline, two (0.09%) males and five (0.21%) females were diagnosed with AGWs. Regardless of prevalent or incident cases, no recurrences were observed after treatment. Because of loss to follow-up, we collected biopsy samples from 83% (10/12) of the prevalent and new incident AGW cases ( Table 2 ). All samples were positive for HPV 6 or 11, and four samples were coinfected with HPV 16 or 18. For all volunteers in the full cohort, 1.73% (40/2309) of the males and 1.14% (27/2378) of the females reported having at least one episode of clinically diagnosed AGWs during their lifetime (Table 3) . Females generally acquired AGWs somewhat earlier than males (median age = 26 years for females and 30 years for males), although no significant difference by sex was found (P = 0.1108). Among the patients, 12.5% of the males and 18.5% of the females reported that they had at least one recurrence of AGWs. The incidence of selfreported, diagnosed AGWs during the past 12 months was 1.73 (95% CI: 0.36-3.42) per 1000 person-years for males and 2.94 (95% CI: 0.77-5.12) per 1000 for females, and no sex differences were found. Figure 1 shows the cumulative incidence of self-reported diagnosed AGWs among men and women by birth cohort based on age at first diagnosis. In men, the cumulative incidence of AGWs was comparable among the different birth cohorts (P = 0.0785); however, in women, the age at first diagnosis was earlier, and the cumulative incidence risk increased with each subsequent younger birth cohort (Po0.0001). We estimated the risk factors associated with self-reported diagnosis of AGWs (Table 4 ). In the multivariate analysis, individuals whose sexual partners having a STD diagnosis (OR = 4.3, 95% CI: 2.4-7.5) and who had more than three lifetime sexual partners (compared with 1, OR = 4.1, 95% CI: 2.1-7.9) had higher risk to reported AGWs. In addition, sexual partners having sex with others (OR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1. The average age-specified incidence rate of AGWs was highest for 20-24-year-old females (0.64/1000 person-years), while the rate peaked at a slightly older age of 25-29 years in males (0.46/1000 person-years) (Figure 3) .
