3.1. The IBV isolates were closely related to 793/B type based on the S1 gene analysis In line with the results from 793/B genotype-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) , phylogenetic analysis using the complete sequence of the S1 gene showed that all 20 IBV isolates were genotypically related to the 793/B (Fig. 1) . However, some isolates, including, ck/CH/LGD/ 120723, ck/CH/LGD/120724, ck/CH/LGD/090907, and ck/CH/LSD/ 111235, as well as the reference strain Deyang-06, showed various topologies compared with those of other 793/B viruses, although Fig. 1 . The neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees of the complete S1 nucleotide sequence of our 20 isolates (black stars) and reference strains, respectively. The IBV strains used for serotyping and/or vaccination-challenge are shown in bold. In addition, the amino acid residues at position 95, at which a Ser or Ala residue are believed to favor virus replication in chickens and embryonated eggs, are also shown. GenBank accession numbers are indicated in parentheses. they still clustered together with other 793/B strains in the phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1) . Nucleotide and amino acid similarities also confirmed these results (data not shown). Furthermore, insertions and deletions were also found at different positions between amino acid residues 10 and 135 in the S1 subunit of the S protein in the different viruses. In addition, 19 of the 30 Chinese 793/B-like strains have a Ser residue at position 95, seven have an Ala, and five have other residues at this position (Fig. 1) . It was reported that virus replication in chickens and embryonated eggs was favored by a Ser or Ala residue at this position . These results indicate that IBV isolates genotypically related to 793/B that are circulating in chicken flocks in China likely originated from different ancestors and/or evolved differently as they adapted to, and spread among, different chicken flocks. In addition, the recombination events have been detected in the S1 genes by the network tree constructed between some of the IBV isolates and reference strains (Supplemental Fig. 1 ).
