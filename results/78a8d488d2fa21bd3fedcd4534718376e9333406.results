Of the 5288 combinations of week and individual which could include data on HRV in both that and the next, the study includes data on 4107 transitions (77.7%). The number of transitions per individual ranges from 8-51, with a median of 42. Of the 733 positive HRV tests in the first 51 weeks of the study, we observed loss of HRV in 321 (43.8%), maintenance of HRV in 371 (50.6%), and no data in 41 (5.6%). Of the 3700 negative HRV tests during these weeks, we observe acquisition of HRV in 358 (9.7%), no acquisition in 3057 (82.6%), and no data in 285 (7.7%). In weeks with data to characterize HRV acquisition or loss, we observe 144 positive tests for coronavirus, 66 for paramyxovirus, 47 for influenza, and 188 for bocavirus. After model selection, five covariates were significant in predicting acquisition of HRV: week, age, youngest household member, infection with coronavirus, and frequency of HRV infection in other household members. The association with youngest household member is only marginally significant with a generalized linear mixed model (glmmML in R), but is included here because exclusion has little effect on the coefficients of the other covariates. Only a single covariate, number of HRV infections in other household members, predicts a reduced probability of loss of HRV ( Table 2, Fig 1) . We found no association with the number of consecutive weeks of positive tests on the probability of a transmission to a negative test, or of the number of consecutive weeks of negative tests on the probability of a transmission to a positive test. For HRV acquisition, including specific infection classes by age and presence of symptoms within the household significantly improves the model fit, as does breaking individuals outside the household into specific infection classes by age (Fig 2) . Sex has no association in any model, and no model found evidence for transmission by adults. Models with individuals aggregated by age (AIC 2086.7), presence of symptoms (AIC 2080.9), or age crossed by presence of symptoms (AIC 2077.4) improve the fit compared with the basic model (AIC 2094.6) ( Table 3) . For HRV loss, breaking into specific infection classes does not improve the model.
