Basal autophagy levels are maintained unchanged during HSV-2 infection. In response to HSV-1 infection, we previously found that autophagy levels may be slightly inhibited, or in most cases remain unchanged, during productive HSV-1 infection 29 . The autophagic response to HSV-2 infection was not previously assessed. Thus we monitored autophagy flux in cells during HSV-2 infection using sequestosome1 (or p62) immunoblotting. p62 is a protein that is degraded mainly by autophagy and thus its levels represent a reliable indicator of autophagy flux in cells [30] [31] [32] . Id est, accumulation of p62 marks suppression of the autophagy flux, whereas its depletion reflects autophagy induction [30] [31] [32] . We found that HSV-2 infection does not cause any significant changes in autophagy flux in host cells (Fig. 1a-d) . This result indicated that HSV-2, similarly to HSV-1, prevents autophagy induction in response to infection, but meanwhile maintains the basal autophagy activity of the host mostly unhampered.
