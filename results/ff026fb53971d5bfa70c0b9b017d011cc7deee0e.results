Identification by HTS of ABMA, a ricin inhibitor active in vitro and in vivo. As previously described 14 , we performed a cell-based HTS to identify small chemical compounds active against ricin-mediated cell intoxication. We screened a library of 16,500 small molecules for those endowed with the capacity to prevent the inhibition of protein biosynthesis induced by ricin treatment. Four hits were confirmed; two hits named Retro-1 and Retro-2 were reported as inhibitors of ricin and Shiga-like toxins (Stx) by blocking their retrograde transport inside host cells 14 . ChemBridge TM compound 1-Adamantyl (5-Bromo-2-Methoxybenzyl) Amine (ABMA, Fig. 1A ) discussed in this article, was one of the other hits from that screen, which bears a hydrophobic adamantane and a substituted aromatic moiety. ]-leucine at 0.5 µCi/mL for 6 h. Protein synthesis was measured by scintillation counting as the amount of [ 14 C]-leucine incorporated in cells. Each data point represents the mean of duplicate ± SD of a representative experiment. (C) ABMA protects mice against ricin challenge. The survival of mice treated once with the indicated doses of ABMA and then exposed to an LD 90 of ricin via nasal instillation was monitored. In each experiment, treated animals received a single ip dose of ABMA (2 mg/kg, open circles; 20 mg/kg, circles with right half black; and 200 mg/kg, circles with left half black) 1 h prior to toxin exposure (2 µg/kg by nasal instillation), while control animals (black circles) received vehicle only prior to ricin administration. The curves for treated animals are statistically different from control as measured by the log rank test (p < 0.01 for 2 mg/kg of ABMA; p < 0.001 for 20 mg/kg,; p < 0.001 for 200 mg/kg). Inhalation is considered as a major risk factor for ricin exposure 18 . Thus, ABMA protective activity was first tested in vitro by challenging human pulmonary alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells with increasing concentrations of ricin (Fig. 1B) . In five independent experiments, ABMA treatment induced a decrease in ricin cytotoxicity with an EC 50 of 3.8 µM, and a protection factor (R) at 30 µM ranging from 5 to 10. ABMA retained almost 100% of its biological activity against ricin-induced cytotoxicity up to six days after incubation in culture medium at 37 °C (Fig. S1 ), indicating a robust stability. As expected, ABMA had no observed inhibitory effect on cell protein synthesis up to at least 90 µM as measured by [ 14 C]-leucine incorporation (Fig. S2 ). AlamarBlue ® cell viability assay also confirmed its low toxicity on human cells, with a CC 50 (50% cytotoxicity concentration) on cultured (HeLa) and primary human cells (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells, HUVECs) at more than 200 μM (Fig. S3) . Based on these in vitro results, we investigated whether ABMA could protect mice against a lethal ricin challenge. ABMA was non-toxic to animals after one intra-peritoneal (ip) administration up to 200 mg/kg. A model of ricin intoxication by nasal instillation 14 was used to mimic exposure by aerosols, as would occur during an intentional release. Briefly, mice were challenged by an LD 90 of ricin (2 μg/kg) at day 0 (Fig. 1C , closed circles). The first clinical signs of intoxication appeared within 24 h, all mice displaying bristly and greasy hairs. From day 2, weight loss was observed. At later time points other signs were noticed such as prostration, shaking and respiratory distress, with animals needing to be euthanized starting from day 7 post exposure. A statistically significant protection according to survival curves was observed with a single ip dose of 2 mg/kg of ABMA 1 h prior toxin challenge (p < 0.01 versus control, Fig. 1C , open circles). Forty eight % (n = 25; 3 independent experiments) of ABMA-treated mice survived, while in the control group, survival was 11.5% (n = 130, from 10 independent experiments). Based on this result, additional experiments were performed with escalating doses of ABMA. Administration of a single ip dose of 20 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg of ABMA prior to ricin intoxication gave improved, statistically significant, levels of protection as compared to the control group (p < 0.001, n = 5 for both groups). The 20 mg/kg dose fully protected animals through to day 21 (Fig. 1C) . The 200 mg/kg dose resulted in 80% of protection of mice against ricin challenge with a single animal succumbing on day 15. The lower protection seen with the higher dose may be due to solubility issues of ABMA in aqueous solution resulting in uncertain biodistribution at the highest dose. ABMA, a broad-spectrum inhibitor active in vitro against various bacterial toxins. The mechanism of action of ricin toxin shares common general principles with those of intracellular-acting bacterial protein toxins: binding to a cell-surface receptor, internalization in endocytic compartments, trafficking through intracellular transport pathways, translocation from transport vesicles or compartments into the cytosol and catalytic modification of a cellular target. Thus, investigating the effect of ABMA on bacterial toxins may lead to identify other sensitive toxins and hence, get some insights into ABMA mechanism of action 4,5 . Table S1 summarizes the features of the tested toxins. Appropriate model cell lines were pretreated with solvent alone (DMSO) or various concentrations of ABMA, then respectively incubated with increasing concentrations of diphtheria toxin from Corynebacterium diphtheriae (DT), lethal toxin from Bacillus anthracis (LT), toxin B from Clostridium difficile (TcdB), lethal toxin from Clostridium sordellii (TcsL), Shiga-like toxin 2 from Escherichia coli (Stx2) or Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) from Clostridium botulinum (Table S1 and Fig. 2 ). The inhibitory effect of DT on protein biosynthesis was measured by the incorporation of [ 14 C]-leucine into newly synthesized proteins. We observed higher levels of protein biosynthesis on A549 cells exposed to DT in the presence of ABMA than in its absence ( Fig. 2A) with an EC 50 of 62.5 ± 0.3 µM (n = 3). At 90 µM of ABMA, DT toxicity was reduced more than 100-fold in the assay conditions. We also found that ABMA protected other cell lines (e.g. Vero, PC3, A431 and DLD1) as well as HUVEC primary cells against DT (data not shown). This indicates that the inhibitory effect of ABMA on DT is not cell type-specific. Anthrax LT cleaves the mitogen-activated protein kinase MEK2 19 . Figure 2B shows that MEK2 cleavage by LT in HUVECs was partially inhibited in the presence of ABMA at 30 µM. TcdB and TcsL inactivate small GTPases by their glucosyltransferase activity. This disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and induces cell rounding 20 . ABMA reduced Vero cells rounding 4 and 8 folds, respectively, following a challenge by TcdB for 4 h and by TcsL for 18 h (Fig. 2C,D) . The EC 50 s were 73.3 ± 9.1 µM for TcdB and 86.7 ± 6.8 µM for TcsL (n = 3). Stx2 blocks cell protein biosynthesis by cleaving adenine 4324 of the 28 S ribosomal RNA with the same N-adenine glycohydrolase activity as ricin 14 . ABMA at 30 and 60 µM had barely any protective effect on intoxication of HeLa cells by Stx2 and a very weak protection at 90 µM (Fig. 2E ). Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) cleaves the SNARE protein SNAP25 that is essential for the fusion of neuromediator vesicles to the presynaptic membrane of nerve termini, inducing paralysis of the neuromuscular junction 21 . Figure 2F shows that ABMA at 30 µM was unable to prevent SNAP25 cleavage by BoNT/A in rat cerebellar granule primary cultured neurons, a model for BoNT/A activity. Taken together, our results show that ABMA had no effect against Stx2 and BoNT/A cell intoxication. Nevertheless, it displays a broad-spectrum antitoxin activity against potent plant and bacterial toxins acting inside cells: ricin, DT, LT, TcdB and TcsL. Various steps of the toxins' mechanism of action may be considered as the target of ABMA: receptor binding, internalization, intracellular trafficking, translocation into the cell cytosol and catalytic modification of a cell substrate. The toxins sensitive to ABMA have different catalytic activities: N-adenine glycohydrolase for ricin and Stx2, ADP-ribosyltransferase for DT, Zn 2+ metalloprotease for anthrax LT and BoNT/A and glucosyltransferase for TcdB and TcsL. Thus, it is very unlikely that ABMA inhibits the toxins' catalytic activities. Each of those toxins uses a different cell-surface component as a receptor for cell binding and internalization (see Table S1 ). Thus, ABMA probably doesn't inhibit the binding of the toxins to their receptors. Nevertheless, we investigated whether ABMA could inhibit the binding of DT receptor binding domain, named DTR8 22 , to its receptor pro-HB-EGF (Precursor of heparin binding epidermal growth factor analog) as a model for toxin-receptor interaction 23 . A SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 7: 15567 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-15466-7 fluorescent DTR8 was made by chemical coupling with Alexa488 (DTR A488 ). FACS analysis showed that ABMA did not affect binding of Alexa488 labeled-DTR8 (DTR A488 ) with its receptor on Vero cells (Fig. S4) , suggests that the inhibition of DT cytotoxicity induced by ABMA is not due to a reduced binding of DT to its receptor. Since ABMA can inhibit several toxins with different catalytic activities and different receptors, we hypothesized that the inhibitor is not acting directly on the toxin itself but rather on a common host target, necessary for the toxins to reach the host cell's cytosol and exert their toxicity. Our results demonstrate that ABMA has a pronounced inhibitory effect on DT, LT, TcdB and TcsL, which are all well-characterized acidic endosome-dependent toxins. They require low-pH endosomes (early endosomes (EE) and LE) where they undergo a conformational change, leading to the interaction of their transmembrane and catalytic domains with the compartments' membrane and translocation of their catalytic domain into the cytosol 8 . In contrast, ABMA had barely any protective effect on the intoxication of HeLa cells by Stx2. Stx2 follows exclusively the retrograde route from the EE to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the Golgi apparatus after internalization into cells 8 . Finally, ABMA is not able to inhibit BoNT/A, which relies on peculiar synaptic vesicle recycling and endocytosis processes to enter into neurons 24, 25 . Thus, we hypothesized that ABMA is targeting host's endosomal trafficking pathway between EE and the lysosomes.
