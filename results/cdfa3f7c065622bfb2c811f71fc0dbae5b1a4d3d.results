The ticks were morphologically identified to the genus level, and it was determined that all of the collected ticks belonged to the genus Rhipicephalus. Ion Torrent sequencing of the viral RNA metagenome produced 5.4 million reads. After quality control, 88.3% of the reads were classified as good quality, with an average read length of 261 bp. The reads were mapped to two tick genomes (Ixodes and Rhipicephalus), which excluded 5.6% of the reads (Table 1) . To perform taxonomic profiling of the tick viral metagenome, unmapped reads were classified by BLASTn and BLASTx searches. The majority of the reads were found to be unassigned (58%), and 38% of the reads were eukaryotic sequences derived primarily from the arthropod genome ( Figure 1 ). The proportion of reads that were derived from bacteria was 3.6% (163,025 reads), and only 0.09% (4092 reads) were derived from viruses. The viral reads were categorized at the family level. These viral reads corresponded to 7 different viral families and 2 other viral groups, including unclassified dsDNA viruses and environmental samples ( Table 2) .
