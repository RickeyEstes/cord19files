Of the articles and planning documents/reports screened, 49 references were deemed relevant: 35 were journals articles, and 14 were published reports, regulatory standards, and/or planning documents. There was a lot of overlap between sources when summarizing the infection prevention issues that should be addressed by a hospital emergency management plan. Common infection prevention issues mentioned included having policies and procedures related to infection prevention, conducting syndromic surveillance, having infection prevention coverage, and preparing for a surge in potentially contagious patients. Differences identified by the sources tended to be agent-specific interventions, such as developing a SARS response team, 8 identifying hospitals/health care facilities (types C, X, or R) based on whether or not smallpox patients are housed at the facility, 2 or tracking nosocomial transmission of influenza as part of pandemic influenza preparedness. 4 No single document or article identified all of the infection prevention issues that should be addressed by a Plan. A full list of the infection prevention issues that should be included in a Plan are divided into themes or domains and are outlined in Table 1 and provided online at www.ajicjournal.org. IPs can use this Table as an assessment tool for evaluating their Plans and developing policies and procedures that will decrease the risk of infection transmission during an MCE. It is important to note that information provided in this article consists of compiled published recommendations that are not considered mandates or regulations except for the Joint Commission standards for accredited US hospitals. 9
