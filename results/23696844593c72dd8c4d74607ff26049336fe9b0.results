In 2010, of 4,822 acute care hospitals, there were 498 (10.3%) high capability severe acute respiratory failure centers in the United States. We identified 148 hospitals meeting our ECMO criteria and 447 hospitals meeting our mechanical ventilation criteria. A minority of hospitals (n = 97/498, 19.5%) met our criteria for both ECMO and high annual volume of mechanical ventilation. Both high capability center criteria identified hospitals with higher median numbers of hospital beds (501 for ECMO criteria and 489 for high volume mechanical ventilation criteria) and ICU beds (64 and 54, respectively) compared to all acute care hospitals in the United States (Table 1 ). The ECMO criteria identified a greater proportion of large teaching hospitals compared to the high volume mechanical ventilation criteria (49% and 33%, respectively). High capability centers were located predominantly in urban areas.
