ARF was described in 4,710 autopsies (17.7%) from 1990 to 2008. The patients' ages ranged from 1 to 99 years (with a median of 52). A total of 2,713 (57.6%) men and 1,997 (42.4%) women were included in the study. The demographic data are listed in Table 1 . We observed a single associated disease in 1,793 (38.0%) of the cases, 2 diseases in 1,505 (32.0%), 3 in 797 (16.9%), 4 in 349 (7.4%) and 5 diseases in 184 (3.9%) of the cases. A diagnosis could not be determined after autopsy in 82 (1.7%) of the cases. The pulmonary histopathological analysis showed DAD in 40.7% (1,917) of the patients, PE in 23.5% (1,107), AH in 10.4% (491) and LPIP in 4.6% (215) of the patients. The pulmonary histopathological findings and the most prevalent diseases in the 4,710 patients are shown in Table 2 . The major underlying diseases and comorbidities in the ARF patients are shown in Table 2 . BBP was present in 33.9% of the patients (1,597 cases) and was the most frequent pulmonary complication found at the time of autopsy. Cancer was the second most frequent complication; it was observed in 28.1% of the patients (1,324 cases), followed by severe sepsis and/or septic shock in 14.3% (675), liver cirrhosis in 13.6% (639), HIV/AIDS in 10.4% (490), pulmonary embolism in 9.0% (426), acute myocardial The multivariate analysis, with the statistically significant associations between the most prevalent diseases/comorbidities and the different histopathological findings, is shown in Table 3 .
