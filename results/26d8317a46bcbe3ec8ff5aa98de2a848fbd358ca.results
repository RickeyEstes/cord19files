Between 1 Aug 2016 and 31 Jul 2017, we recruited 402 patients with AECOPD, 80 stable COPD, 100 with asthma exacerbation, and 21 with stable asthma subjects for this study. The characteristics of the COPD and asthma subjects are shown in Table 1 . The exacerbation and stable state subjects were matched for lung function but not age, gender and inhaler therapies. Among the 402 subjects with AECOPD, 141(35.1%) cases had pathogens detected. 13 cases (3.2%) had co-infections with more than 1 pathogen identified. Among the 80 COPD control subjects, 9(11.2%) patients had pathogens detected. None had more than 1 pathogen identified in the NPA. The prevalence of microorganisms identified in the COPD (AECOPD and stable) patients is shown in Fig. 1 . The prevalence of microorganisms identified in different months is shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1 . Only the AECOPD group and asthma exacerbation group (not control subjects), had influenza A identified by RTPCR in the NPA. For those with AECOPD and asthma exacerbation subjects, 5 out of the 50 (10.0%) and 1 out of 19 subjects (5.26%) had the H1N1pdm09 strain identified respectively. The rest of the influenza A belonged to the H3N2 strain. For the AECOPD subjects, those with pathogens identified in the NPA had similar hospital LOS (11.7 ± 9.6 vs 12.9 ± 10.5 days, p = 0.29), 30 day readmissions (0.23 ± 0.50 vs 0.28 ± 0.52times, p = 0.35), 60 day readmissions (0.39 ± 0.66 vs 0.53 ± 0.88times, p = 0.06), in-hospital mortality (2.8 vs 3.1%, p = 0.59), 30 day mortality (5.7 vs 5.8%, p = 0.58) and 60 day mortality (8.5 vs 8.1%, p = 0.51) compared with those without isolation of pathogens. Among 100 subjects with asthma exacerbation, 45(45.0%) had pathogens detected. 5(5.0%) subjects had co-infections with more than 1 pathogen studied. Among the 21 asthma control subjects, only 1(4.8%) subject had parainfluenza virus detected. The prevalence of microorganisms identified in asthma (exacerbated asthma and stable) patients is shown in Fig. 2 . The prevalence of microorganisms identified in different months is shown in Additional file 1: Figure S2 . Subjects with asthma exacerbations with detection of pathogens in the NPA had similar hospital LOS (8.4 ± 6.8 vs 9.0 ± 12.2 days, p = 0.80) and in-hospital mortality (0 vs 1.8%, p = 0.55) in comparisons with those without pathogens. There was no mortality recorded after discharge of patients till 60 days. The NPA positive group had lower 30 day (0.04 ± 0.21 vs 0.35 ± 0.67times, p = 0.003) and 60 day readmissions (0.11 ± 0.32 vs 0.38 ± 0.73times, p = 0.02) than NPA negative group. There was no difference in the rates of ICU admission, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) use and mechanical ventilation support among those with microorganisms identified in the NPA vs those without microorganisms identified for both asthma and COPD exacerbations. Results are shown in Table 2 . Comparison of subjects with and without influenza vaccination found that the rate of influenza-related exacerbations appeared to be higher in those with influenza vaccination but that did not reach statistical significance. Results are shown in Table 3 . HRV was detected in 26, 11 and 1 subjects respectively with AECOPD, asthma exacerbations and stable COPD. No subject in stable asthma group had HRV identified in the NPA. The subtypes are listed in Table 4 . Comparisons of different types of HRV (HRV-A, HRV-B and HRV-C) identified found that there was no association between the various types of HRV in both AECOPD and asthma exacerbations with hospital LOS, readmission and mortality. The results of the relationships of HRV types and clinical outcomes of AECOPD and asthma exacerbation are shown in Additional file 1: Tables S1 and S2 respectively.
