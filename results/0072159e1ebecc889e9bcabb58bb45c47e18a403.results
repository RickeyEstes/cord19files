Screening of proline-rich motif reading array identifies BAG3 as an EBOV VP40 PPxY interactor The "proline-rich" reading array represents a powerful tool that we have used previously to identify WW-domain proteins that physically and functionally bind to viral PPxY motifs ( Fig  1) [37, 39] . Here, we used biotinylated peptides containing either the eVP40 WT PPxY motif (MRRVILPTAPPEYMEAI) or an eVP40 PPxY mutant motif (MRRVILPTAAAEAMEAI) to screen 115 GST-WW domain and 40 GST-SH3 domain containing proteins (Fig 1) . While the PPxY mutant eVP40 peptide did not interact with any of the arrayed WW or SH3 domains, the WT eVP40 peptide bound robustly to a number of host WW domains, including previously identified proteins Nedd4, Rsp5 (yeast ortholog of Nedd4), and ITCH ( Fig 1B) . Intriguingly, the WT eVP40 peptide also bound to a select number of WW-domains not identified previously, including the WW-domain of host protein BAG3 (Fig 1B, panel G) . We used purified GST-WW domain fusion proteins and a GST pull down assay to confirm the specificity of the BAG3-VP40 interaction (Fig 2) . Briefly, protein extracts from HEK293T cells expressing either eVP40-WT, eVP40-Î”PT/PY (PPxY deletion mutant), or mVP40-WT were incubated with beads containing GST alone or GST-BAG3WW (Fig 2) . Input and pulldown proteins were detected by Western blot. Indeed, we found that GST-BAG3WW, but not GST alone, pulled down eVP40 in a PPxY-dependent manner (Fig 2A, top right panel) , and also pulled down mVP40 that contains a single PPxY L-domain motif (Fig 2B, top right panel) . In sum, these data indicate that, compared to other PPxY-WW domain interactions interrogated previously [21] , the eVP40 PPxY motif possesses a relatively high and significant degree of specificity, suggesting that BAG3 is likely a novel, biologically relevant interactor with VP40 of EBOV and MARV.
