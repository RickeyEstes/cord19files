A total of 113 children were included in this study. The median age of the children was 9 months, ranging from 1.5 to 24 months, and 77 (68%) were male. Clinical characteristics of the patients are described in Table 1 . In our study, 24/113 (21.2%) children received antibiotic treatment during hospitalization mostly due to secondary bacterial infection such as acute sinusitis, acute otitis media, or pneumonia. A total of 132 viruses were detected from 113 children, but 12 viruses, including cytomegalovirus in seven and enterovirus in five, were regarded as nonpathogenic agents and excluded from analysis in this study. At least one viral pathogen was identified in 86 children (76%), of whom single viral pathogen was detected in 58 (67%) and at least two viruses were detected in 28 (33%). RSV was the most common virus identified and accounted for 49 (43.4%) cases, followed by hBoV in 22 (19.5%), hMPV in 19 (16.8%), and RV in 14 (12.4%) (Fig. 1) . CPE was observed in one case, but the virus species could not be identified. All 113 specimens were negative for CoV-229E or influenza virus B. Of the 49 RSV-positive children, 18 (36.7%) had coinfection with other viruses. Monthly distribution of the viruses identified during the study period is illustrated in Fig. 2 . The incidence of RSV infection peaked in April 2009, March 2010, and November 2010. The incidence of hMPV detection peaked in April 2009, while that of hBoV peaked in August 2010. We could not evaluate the differences in incidence of other viruses due to the small case numbers. Bronchiolitis due to single viral infection was identified in 58 patients, of whom RSV was detected in 31 (53%), hBoV in six (10%), hMPV in six (10%), and RV in seven (12%). Clinical characteristics of these patients are given in Table 2 . No significant differences were observed in terms of sex, age, radiographic findings, duration of fever, length of hospital stay, antibiotic treatment, leukocyte count, and serum C-reactive protein level. Multiple viral infections were found in 28 cases (25%). RSV was the most common virus encountered in mixed infections, followed by hBoV, hMPV, and RV. The detailed incidence rate of mixed viral infection is listed in Table 3 . In addition, clinical characteristics of the children with RSVmixed infection are described in Table 2 . Clinical manifestations of children with RSV-mixed infection were similar to those with single viral infection, and no significant differences were found among the different groups.
