Phenylalanine assay with coupled fluorogenic reactions. We first developed the assay using Ang II as the substrate to form Ang- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . The new method involves a series of four reactions using synthetic Ang II as the starting substrate. The Ang-II-converting activity is measured as the production rate of L-phenylalanine (Phe) following proteolytic cleavage of the Pro 7 -Phe 8 peptide bond at the carboxyl terminus (the schematics of the reaction is in Fig. 1 ). In the first reaction, Ang II is allowed to react with purified converting enzymes (such as ACE2) or with tissue lysate, in which Ang II to Ang-(1-7) conversion releases the carboxyl terminal Phe 8 (Fig. 1A) . In a coupled reaction, the exposed primary amine (-NH 2 ) group of phenylalanine amino acid is hydrolyzed by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) of Rhodotorula glutinis and ultimately turns on a fluorescent probe (Fig. 1B) . For illustrative purposes, the color conversion -visible to naked eyes -following the reactions is shown Following the proteolytic cleavage, the amino group of phenylalanine becomes exposed to undergo deamidation by yeast enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), also termed phenylalanine deaminase. Following a series of coupled reactions, a fluorogenic substrate is converted, and the rate of conversion that reflects the kinetic of the first reaction can be quantitatively measured. (C) The picture shows the color change as the result of the chain of the reaction initiated by ACE2 cleavage of synthetic Ang II peptide. Tubes 1 and 2 are from reactions in the absence and presence of recombinant soluble ACE2 (rsACE2: aa 1-740), respectively; tubes 3 and 4 are each from reactions with the addition of culture medium from cells transfected with either pcDNA3 empty vector or a soluble ACE2-expressing plasmid respectively. Positive ACE2 enzymatic activities in 2 and 4 convert fluorogenic substrate to bright pink color visible to naked eyes (with emission at 587 nm). (D) Several bioactive peptides share the same proline-phenylalanine (P-F) motif at their C-termini. Scientific RepoRts | 7:45473 | DOI: 10.1038/srep45473 in Fig. 1C . Typically, the reaction sets are operated in a 96-well format and either dynamic or endpoint reading of fluorescence excitation intensity is automated (details in Methods). Since the new assay detects the cleavage of a carboxyl phenylalanine from polypeptides, it is worth noting that a few other biologically active peptides also share the proline-phenylalanine (P-F) dipeptide motif signature (Fig. 1D ). Among them is apelin-13, a peptide also cleaved by ACE2 30 . ACE2 can cleave the peptide bond preceding Phe 77 31 causing inactivation of apelin 32 . A potent stimulator of cardiac contractility, apelin exists in a number of active polypeptide forms: apelin-13 (aa 65-77), apelin-17 (aa 61-77) and apelin-36 (aa 42-77), all carry the dipeptide motif at their carboxy termini and are expected to react with ACE2. We therefore asked whether the new phenylalanine assay can also be adapted to measuring carboxypeptidase activities that degrades apelin-13 (see below). The robustness and dynamic performance of the assay toward Ang II and apelin-13 substrates. ACE2, an enzyme that cleaves both Ang II and apelin-13, was used in these studies to validate the phenylalanine assay with each of these two substrates. We have previously made recombinant soluble ACE2 (rsACE2 of murine: aa 1-740 of the extracellular catalytic segment) and tested its activity using Mca-APK(Dnp) 33 . We sought to determine the dynamic performance of the assay in dose-response studies (Fig. 2 ). Eight reactions with two-fold serially diluted rsACE2 were monitored for over 60 minutes in presence of phenylalanine assay regents ( Fig. 2A-B ). With the same amount of substrate in each reaction, both Ang II and apelin-13 gave similar results (A compared to B), showing that the reaction conditions had allowed complete dose separation in each series. The results also showed that relative fluorescence intensity reached a plateau within 30 min in the highest ACE2 groups ( Fig. 2A-B) . Therefore, we used 30 min as the optimized first-step reaction time for the following two-steps phenylalanine assays (details in Methods). To evaluate the suitability of the phenylalanine assay for quantitative analysis, we performed analysis of the Ang II and apelin-13 converting activity using rsACE2. First, we incubated an excess quantity of ACE2 in reactions with variable amount of substrate for 30 min followed by phenylalanine reaction. The substrate-fluorescence dependent curve was derived using non-linear regression (Fig. 2C,D) . Then, we performed phenylalanine assay to calculate the kinetic parameters for rsACE2 by measuring the catalysis rate against Ang II and apelin-13, respectively. The K m value of rsACE2 for Ang II was 20.48 μ M and that for apelin-13 was 23.23 μ M. The V max value for Ang II was 2.164 nmol/min/ug protein and for apelin-13 was 2.459 nmol/min/ug protein (Fig. 2C,D) . Of note, rsACE2 showed very similar catalytic efficiencies toward Ang II and apelin-13 substrates. For the reason that one of the intended applications of the assay are to measure converting activities in biological fluids or tissues, which may possess a lower level of enzymatic activities, we tested the analytical performance of the assay by measuring the activity from various concentrations of rsACE2 using Ang II or apelin-13 as substrate and plotted standard curves. Because the system produces virtually no background signals, as low as 0.25 ng of the enzyme could still be sensitively detected ( Fig. 3A and B). Good linear ranges for ACE2 activity were obtained from 0.25 to 4 ng on a non-logerithmic scale with R 2 = 0.9955 for Ang II and R 2 = 0.9968 for apelin-13, and from 4 ng to 100 ng on a logarithmic scale with R 2 = 0.9946 for Ang II and R 2 = 0.9971 for apelin-13 (supplementary Figure S2A -D). We next evaluated the intra-assay and inter-assay precision and reproducibility. Samples that contain different rsACE2 amounts were measured in reactions with Ang II, and the results were subsequently calculated from the standard curves obtained above. Supplementary Table S1 shows the intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from 2.12% to 7.4% and the inter-assay CV ranged from 6.23% to 10.1%. These low CV values indicate high reliability of the assay. We also compared the ACE2 activity results obtained from this phenylalanine assay with the existing Mca-APK(Dnp) method. rsACE2 in a serial dilution series was added to reactions with either Mca-APK(Dnp) or Ang II peptides, and measured activities of ACE2 were directly compared. Both methods measured ACE2 activities that not only correlated with the input concentrations of the enzyme, but also highly correlated to each other (R 2 of 0.9958, Fig. 3C ). Here we should emphasize that the two substrates are of rather distinct sequences (Fig. 3D) , and Mca-APK(Dnp), which sequence was originally designated for caspase 1, as a surrogate can be cross-recognized by ACE2 34 . Therefore, the ACE2 specific inhibitor MLN-4760 are used in conjunction with MCA-APK(Dnp) to measure activity exclusively attributed to ACE2 33 . Instead, the phenylalanine assay, measures either ACE2-dependent or combined total converting activities against Ang II when used in presence or absence of this ACE2 inhibitor, respectively. The phenylalanine assay used on a cell system. We next set out to test whether the new assay can faithfully measure ACE2 activity levels in a cell system. We adapted a HEK293 cell transfection system to express Fig. 1C . The expression of sACE2-Fc from pcD-NA3-rsACE2 transfected cells was confirmed by western blot (Fig. 4A,B) , and its activity could be detected in cell lysates and in the culture medium (Fig. 4C,D) . These activities were completely abolished in the presence of ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 in the reaction. Also as expected, the control cells transfected with only empty plasmid produced no activity. Detection of injected rsACE2 activities in blood using the Ang II phenylalanine assay. We sought to use the new assay, in a comparison with Mca-APK(Dnp), to measure ACE2 activities in serum samples. Following a single i.p. injection of 50 μ g rsACE2, increase of ACE2 activities could be detected as early as 15 minutes (Fig. 5A,B) . The levels peaked at about 1 hour and gradually dissipated over a 24-hour period. Overall, the two methods showed virtually identical serum profiles of ACE2 activity (n = 3), indicating that the new Ang II phenylalanine method can sensitively measure ACE2 activity in complex serum samples. ACE2-specific inhibitor MLN-4760 was used as negative control. Endogenous carboxypeptidase activities for Ang II and apelin-13 in mouse serum. Full length ACE2 is a transmembrane protein and only minimally present in serum through protease-mediated shedding 35 . We separately performed Mca-APK(Dnp) and phenylalanine tests of mouse serum. Recombinant ACE2 was used as a benchmark control in order to cross-reference between the two assays. As previously reported by us and others 33, 36, 37 , there is minimal serum ACE2 activity measured for Mca-APK(Dnp) (Fig. 5C ). By contrast, by using a large volume of mouse serum (5 μ L) we detected converting peptidase activities comparable to that of 5 ng rsACE2 as measured by the phenylalanine assay using Ang II and apelin-13 peptides ( Fig. 5D and E respectively). These results suggest that Ang-(1-7) formation from Ang II in serum is to a large extent ACE2-independent, although this converting activity is relative low and might be undetectable as reported by others using other methods that used a small amount of serum 15 . Carboxypeptidases reacting to Ang II and apelin-13 other than ACE2 contribute therefore to total phenylalanine intensity (particularly at the tissue level) (see below). Mouse organ activities measured by phenylalanine assay. Next, we sought to measure Ang II-converting activities in complex tissue lysates. First, we conducted control experiments to determine the background levels of the assay from two contributing sources: The naturally existing phenylalanine in tissues and phenylalanine resulted from non-Ang II substrates such as abundant tissue proteins. Using mouse kidney lysate, even without Ang II substrate, there was a background level of phenylalanine reading likely from endogenous phenylalanine. As the reaction proceeded with Ang II, the reading of phenylalanine levels increases steadily over time (supplementary Fig. S1A ). This is in stark contrast to the reaction that maintained a constant intensity of phenylalanine signal when Ang II was absent, suggesting that reaction signals were derived from Ang II-conversion, instead from any protein substrates in tissue lysate. Endogenous phenylalanine levels tend to vary (up to 2 mg/ dL in blood) depending on diet. We next performed desalting of the lysate to remove endogenous phenylalanine (details in Methods) and then subjected the resulting tissue lysates to phenylalanine assay (no Ang II added to the reactions). As expected, desalting reduced background intensities in a majority of mouse tissues tested, most notably in serum (supplementary Fig. S1B ). Therefore, we adapted this desalting step in tissue preparation in subsequent experiments. The assay can equally be performed without the step but then it requires subtraction from baseline phenylalanine activity. In addition, we measured the kinetics of Ang-(1-7) formation in reactions of Ang II mixed with kidney lysates. Following the initial accumulation of Ang-(1-7) that peaked at 30 min, its total levels gradually subsided that likely reflect further degradation of newly formed Ang-(1-7). By contrast, phenylalanine was stably produced throughout the course of the 120 min reaction (Fig. 6A) . Evidently, the net Ang-(1-7) levels were influenced by the rates of its formation and degradation, and the commonly used EIA method may not truly represent Ang-(1-7) formation activity. By contrast, this activity can be better captured by the phenylalanine assay attributed to the stability of phenylalanine amino acid. We conducted the assay on 12 mouse organs. For comparison, the Mca-APK(Dnp) assays were performed with and without ACE2 inhibition and ACE2 activity levels were estimated as the difference between the two measurements. Consistent with published results 38 , ACE2 activities were prominently present in the ileum followed by the kidney (Fig. 6B ). When the same tissue lysates were subjected to phenylalanine reactions using either Ang II or apelin-13 as substrates ( Fig. 6C and D respectively) , the ileum and kidney remain the highest in activity. In addition, some other organs including lung and stomach also display high carboxypeptidase activities. It is interesting to note that MLN-4760 inhibition of ACE2 reduced phenylalanine activity to a variable extent, most noticeably in ileum, kidney and heart, in which ACE2 has been shown to play an essentially role in Ang II catabolism 15,38,39 .
