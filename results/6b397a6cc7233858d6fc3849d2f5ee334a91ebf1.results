Systematic analysis of the studies describing the epidemiological, demographic, and clinical features of MERS-CoV cases and reporting the prevalence of a number of chronic diseases in the infectious disease identified 12 reports 1-12 with 637 patients (Table 1) , representing approximately 40% of the WHO confirmed cases. The majority of the cases were from the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia; a few came from France, Germany, Italy, Jordan, Tunisia, and the UK. 1 The number of cases in the selected studies varied by approximately 52-fold and ranged from 5 12 to 261 8 cases. The sex ratio (male to female) was 2.03 and the overall average age (AE standard error (SE)) of the subjects was 53 AE 3 years (range 36-66 years). Meta-analysis of the identified studies showed that the most prevalent clinical symptoms were cough (80 AE 5%, 95% CI 70-89%) and fever (77 AE 6%, 95% CI 66-89%), followed by shortness of breath (68 AE 8%, 95% CI 53-84%) and sore throat (39 AE 11%, 95% CI 17-61%). There was significant heterogeneity (Cochran's Q) in the estimates of clinical symptoms among the examined studies (p < 0.001) with an I 2 index varying from 82.3% to 95.2% (Table 1) . As shown in Figure 2 (inserts a and b), diabetes and hypertension were equally prevalent, in 51 AE 8% (95% CI 36-66%) and 48 AE 9% (95% CI 31-65%) of the patients, respectively. Cardiac diseases were present in 31 AE 5% (95% CI 20-41%) and obesity in 16 AE 2% (95% CI 12-19%) (Figure 2 , inserts c and d). The proportions of diabetes, hypertension, CAD/CVD, and obesity varied by 8-, 2.8-, 9.3-, and 3.1-fold, respectively, among the identified studies. This wide among-studies variation in the proportion of comorbidities may have resulted in the significant heterogeneity (Cochran's Q) observed for estimates of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiac diseases (p < 0.001), but not obesity with an I 2 index ranging from 84.5-94.1% (Figure 2 ).
