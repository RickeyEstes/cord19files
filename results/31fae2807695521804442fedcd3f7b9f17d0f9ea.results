A single dose of PERC resulted in bodyweight loss in ∼ 80% of strains, whereas liver-to-bodyweight ratios remained largely unaffected by PERC exposure (Figure 2 ). On average, a significant loss of body weight by ∼ 6% was observed (p < 0:0001, t-test), although the response was variable between strains. For instance, strains CC043/GeniUnc, CC065/Unc, and CC001/Unc lost over 15% of their body weight, whereas other strains (e.g., CC012/GeniUnc) maintained their body weight. The liver-tobodyweight ratio was highly variable in both vehicle-and PERCtreated animals. The median liver-to-bodyweight ratio was lower in PERC-treated animals compared with vehicle-treated animals, although this was not a statistically significant observation (p = 0:282, unpaired t-test). Significant accumulation (p = 0:0006, t-test) of triglycerides was observed in the livers of PERC-exposed animals ( Figure 3A , B); this finding was confirmed histopathologically (see Figure  S1 ). About one-third of the strains tested exhibited various degrees of hepatosteatosis 24 hr following PERC exposure. Interestingly, the degree and type of steatosis varied among strains; some mice displayed zonal steatosis, others displayed azonal, and both macro-and micro-vesicular (and mixed) steatosis was observed. The accumulation of hepatic lipids was coincident with a decrease (p = 0:013, t-test) in serum triglyceride levels ( Figure 3C ,D), providing additional evidence that PERC exposure, even at a single dose, is coincident with dysregulation of liver lipid metabolism. The levels of PERC and its primary oxidative metabolite TCA were assessed in a standard toxicokinetic study design. Levels of PERC in the liver and kidney (Figure 4 ; see also Table S1) were highly variable across the population (geometric standard deviation ðGSDÞ = 1:65 and 1.74, respectively), as highlighted by the broad 95% confidence intervals (gray shadow) around the nonlinear least squares regression line (solid black line). It is also evident that in both tissues, the shape of the concentration-time profiles in the individual strains was also variable. Similar to PERC, tissue levels of TCA and shapes of the concentration-time profiles were strain-dependent ( Figure 5 ; see also Table S2 ). On average, TCA levels were about 3-fold higher than PERC on a molar basis. Levels of TCA were highest in serum, followed by the liver and kidney. In the liver, the geometric mean (GM) was ∼ 13,600 nmol Ã hr=g liver (GSD = 1:64). Although most of the strains either exhibit a plateau or clearance from all tissue compartments by the 24 hr time point, some strains appear to accumulate TCA with time. This type of toxicokinetic behavior yields under-prediction of the maximum TCA concentration. Due to this limitation, there is greater uncertainty in peak TCA concentrations for these strains and therefore the actual GM and GSD statistics are likely greater than those reported here. PERC is structurally similar to trichloroethylene (TCE) and these compounds share qualitatively similar metabolism pathways. Thus, we compared the interstrain differences in serum TCA levels of this study (after exposure to PERC) and the serum TCA levels from (Bradford et al. 2011) , in which a single oral dose of 2,100 mg/kg TCE in corn oil was administered to 16 strains of male inbred mice. Interstrain variability in TCA levels was similar between two studies (Bradford et al. 2011 : GM ∼ 9,400; GSD = 1:42; this study: GM ∼ 29,500; GSD = 1:37); however, TCA AUCs in the serum of PERCexposed mice was much greater as compared with TCE-exposed mice even though the dose of TCE was over 2.5-fold higher on a molar basis. Thus, in spite of qualitatively similar metabolism, the conversion of PERC and TCE to TCA in vivo is quantitatively different. A subset of nine strains was selected for an in-depth profiling of TCA levels across additional tissues, as described in "Methods." In addition to liver, kidney, and serum, TCA was analyzed in gonadal (epididymal) fat pads, lung, and brain (see Figure S2 ). Although a large degree of variability existed among individual strains, the general trend for TCA levels was serum <liver <lung <kidney <brain <fat. To better characterize the relationship between tissue compartments, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of correlations of TCA AUCs between tissues was performed ( Figure 6A ). Levels of TCA in serum, brain, fat, and lung correlate with one another and form a major cluster (as indicated by the dendrogram). Liver and kidney also have a high level of correlation with each other, but not to other tissue sites. CYP2E1 metabolizes small lipophilic chemicals, such as TCE (Kim and Ghanayem 2006; Lash et al. 2014; Ramdhan et al. 2008) ; however, little is known about specific enzymes involved in PERC oxidation. Hepatic CYP2E1 protein was measured across CC strains (Figure 7) . Levels of CYP2E1 were highly variable among vehicle-treated mice. After exposure to PERC, some strains exhibited marginal increase, whereas others a decrease in hepatic CYP2E1. At the population level, there was no statistically significant effect of PERC exposure on hepatic CYP2E1 levels. Liver effects of PERC and TCE have been attributed to formation of TCA, which is an activator of PPARa (Maloney and Waxman 1999) . One study reported that PERC induces PPARa after acute and subacute (less than 14 days) exposure, but not after 30 days of exposure (Philip et al. 2007 ); however, the overall database on the role of PPARa in the effects of PERC is limited. Thus, we examined transcript levels for two PPARa target genes, Cyp4a10 and Acox1, in liver tissue 24 hr following exposure (Figure 8 ). In vehicle-treated mice, levels of individual transcripts were fairly consistent among strains. Almost every strain exhibited induction of both transcripts upon PERC exposure; however, the extent of induction was highly variable for both Acox1 (GM = 1:99-fold; GSD = 1:45) and Cyp4a10 (GM = 5:02-fold; GSD = 1:64). At the population level, statistically significant induction of both transcripts was observed. , as compared to pre-treatment weight, in vehicle-(black dot) and PERC-(1,000 mg/kg, i.g., red dot) exposed Collaborative Cross mice 24 hr following a single intragastric gavage. A and C show change in the individual strains that were ordered according to the change in body weight in PERC-treated mice (A), or liver to body weight ratio in vehicle-treated mice (C). B and D show population averages as box and whisker plots. The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), the black line represents the median, and the whiskers represent Q1-1:5ÃIQR and Q3 + 1:5ÃIQR. The asterisk (*) denotes significant difference (p < 0:05) between treatment groups (unpaired t-test). To further characterize the relationship among toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic phenotypes investigated in the population of CC mice, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering ( Figure 6B ). The induction of Acox1 and Cyp4a10 was highly correlated, suggesting that PERC exposure is associated with activation of the PPARa pathway in all exposed mouse strains. However, at the population level, no correlation was observed between liver PERC or TCA AUC and induction of these genes. Importantly, liver triglyceride level and liver PERC and TCA AUCs were clustered together, suggesting that either parent chemical or metabolite may be responsible for the observed dysregulation of hepatic lipids. Coincident with this finding was the observation of a negative, albeit weak, correlation between serum triglycerides and PERC and TCA AUCs in the liver. When all toxicodynamic phenotypes were parameterized for strain-to-strain correlations, we observed several clustered subpopulations, as displayed in the heatmap ( Figure 6C ); however, overall there was no obvious clustering of strains based on hepatic TCA levels.
