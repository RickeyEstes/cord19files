Overall structure of the complex MERS-CoV RBD (E367 to Y606) and soluble DPP4 extracellular domain (S39 to P766) with C-terminal histidine tag were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified by Ni-NTA and size-exclusion chromatography (Supplementary information, Figure S1 ). The two components were then mixed, and the complex was purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Supplementary information, Figure   S1 ). Crystals belong to the P6 1 22 space group with cell dimensions, a = b = 110.6 Å, c = 527.6 Å, α = β = 90º, γ = 120º. The structure was determined by the molecular replacement method and refined to a resolution of 3.0 Å with R work of 19.2% and R free of 24.1% (Supplementary information, Table S1 ). There is one complex of DPP4 extracellular domain with MERS-CoV RBD in the asymmetric unit. The final model consists of residues E382 to C585 of the MERS-CoV RBD, S39 to P766 of the DPP4 extracellular domain, and glycans N-linked to residues N85, N92, N150, N219, N229, N281, N321 and N520 of the DPP4 extracellular domain. The DPP4 extracellular domain consists of an Nterminal eight-bladed β-propeller domain (S39 to D496) and a C-terminal α/β hydrolase domain (N497 to P766) ( Figure 1 ). The β-propeller domain consists of eight blades, each made up of four antiparallel β-strands (Supplementary information, Figure S2 ). DPP4 utilizes the blades 4 and 5 to contact the MERS-CoV RBD (Supplementary information, Figure S2 ). The contact site is far from the hydrolase domain ( Figure 1 ), which is consistent with the previous findings showing that the addition of DPP4 inhibitors sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin or P32/98 does not block MERS-CoV entry [9] .
