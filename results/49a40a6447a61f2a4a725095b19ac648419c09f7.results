We formulate two mathematical models: one for Hepatitis Eonly and another for the co-infection with malaria, based on prior work as in [4, 24, 25] . In their framework, an individual is categorized according to their infection status and passes sequentially through the series of non infectious, infectious and recovered classes. A system of ordinary differential equations are then designed, analyzed and later fit to data from the Hepatitis E outbreak in Kitgum district to estimate desired parameters.
