History, clinical findings, and prevalence of APEC and IBV in the examined flocks Forty broiler flocks, aged between 30 and 40 days and suffering from respiratory affections, from the Dakahlia and Damietta governorate were examined. Unwell birds showed respiratory manifestations visible as nasal discharge, sneezing, gasping and swollen head. In all farms examined unwell birds were isolated and subjected to intense antibiotic treatments. However, clear differences in activity and feed intake remained. Screening of collected samples focused on the detection of IBV and E.coli. Eight farms were positive for E.coli (20% of all farms examined), five farms from the Dakahlia and three farms from the Damietta governate. Serotyping of the isolated strains revealed the presence of the O26, O78, O86, O114, O119 serogroups, with the O125 serogroup detected on three farms. Disc diffusion tests showed the following resistance rates: 100% to penicillin, 75% to gentamycin and streptomycin, 62.5% to ciprofloxacin, 50% to cefotaxime and 25% to doxycycline. 75% of all isolated strains were multidrug-resistant (MDR). Twelve farms were positive for IBV (30% of all farms examined) determined by real-time PCR, with ten farms from the Dakahlia and two farms from the Damietta governate. Postmortem examination of the recently succumbed birds revealed the presence of caseous plug at the tracheal bifurcation, caseous trachitis, and fibrinous pericarditis, perihepatitis and air sacculitis. For virus isolation, specific pathogen free embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated. Total Figure 1 . Schematic outline of the experimental design RNA was extracted from the allantoic fluid and the partial S1 gene of each isolate sequenced. Results obtained revealed that the tested samples clustered within the Egyptian variant group of GI-23 genotype subgroups ( Figure 2
