The general fungal primers ITS1 and ITS4 amplified the ITS location of all studied isolates. The ITS alignment revealed appropriate positions for the development of padlock probes that were able to differentiate between seven Exophiala species and the Veronaea out-group tested in this study. Each of the eight infectious species had several distinctive nucleotide positions. The duration of the RCA assay was 2 h. The tested species were unambiguously distinguished from each other and from different black yeast and relatives in the order Chaetothyriales compared by ITS sequence analysis and included as negative controls: the four closely related, clinically relevant species used for comparison, i.e., Cladophialophora bantiana (CBS 678.79), Exophiala dermatitidis (CBS 525.76), E. bergeri (CBS 526.76) and Rhinocladiella mackenziei (CBS 650.93) yielded negative results with the species-specific padlock probes (data not shown). Positive responses proved to be consisted and highly specific in all strains; all individual strains responded with respective probes being and were correctly identified as Exophiala equina, E. salmonis, E. opportunistica, E. aquamarina, E. angulospora and E. castellanii, as well as Veronaea botryosa, the nearest neighbor of the salmonis-clade [2] . No cross reaction was observed between any of the Exophiala species (Fig. 1) . Products of the RCA responses were visualized by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. Positive reaction showed ladder-like patterns after RCA, while with negative results the background stayed clean. When the exonucleolysis step was deleted, a single poor band was apparent on the gel representing a non-specific band that did not interfere with the RCA reaction (data not shown). The concordance of RCA results and identification by multilocus sequencing was 100%.
