The nucleocapsid protein gene sequence of SARS-CoVHB was performed and the sequence (1269 nt) was deposited into the gene bank accession number AY365036. The full length of N protein (422 amino acids) with an amino terminal hexahistidine-tag was expressed in BL21 (DE3) and purified by Ni-NTA affinity column. After 2 h induction a Serum samples of both the symptom free direct contacts to the above patients (physicians, nurses, and their family members) and non-SARS patients who showed symptoms of fever >38 • C, cough and sore throat. with IPTG, high level expression of N protein was observed (Fig. 1, lane 1) compared to uninduced cells lysate (Fig. 1,  lane 2) . The His-tagged protein was purified from the soluble fraction resulting in a single band of the expected mass of 47 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 3) . This data demonstrates that the SARS-CoV N protein was successfully expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. The N protein was identified by western blot using human SARS-CoV infected serum (data not shown). To investigate the immunoreactivity of the nucleocapsid protein with the 16 SARS-CoV infected patient's sera collected at 10, 20, and 30 days after disease onset, an ELISA assay was established using the purified recombinant N protein. Interestingly, we found that 13 of 16 (81.3%), 16 of 16 (100%), and 16 of 16 (100%) SARS patients had a significant positive response to the N protein after 10, 20, and 30 days of disease onset, respectively. When comparing this result with a commercially available detection ELISA kit coated with a mixture of viral proteins (S, N, and E), prepared by Beijing Genomics Institute, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, China, we observed that the immunoreactivity with the SARS patient's antibodies were 9 of 16 (56.3%), 13 of 16 (81.3%), and 15 of 16 (93.7%) at 10, 20, and 30 days of disease onset, respectively, while none of the 131 control sera from symptom free and non-SARS patients gave a positive reaction in either assay (Table 1 ). This result showed that the IgG antibodies to N protein is commonly present in all 16 SARS patients sera and could be detected as early as 10 days of disease onset. The mean OD ± S.D. obtained using 131 control sera were 0.079 ± 0.052 and 0.0688 ± 0.034 for N protein coated ELISA and commercially available detection kit, respectively.
