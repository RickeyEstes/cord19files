Mouse IFIT1 and Human IFIT1 are not orthologous but belong to distinct gene families The expectation that mouse and human IFIT1 should have a similar antiviral function and specificity implicitly assumes that these two genes are orthologous, i.e., they diverged when the common ancestors of humans and mice diverged as species. However, there is evidence suggesting that this assumption may not be valid. First, there have been extensive changes to the number and identity of IFIT genes between humans and mice ( [Fensterl and Sen, 2011; Liu et al., 2013] and Figure 1A ). Furthermore, mouse IFIT1 is more similar at the sequence level to another human IFIT, the poorly characterized human IFIT1B, than to human IFIT1 (57% versus 53% pairwise amino acid identity). Based on these data, and the contradictory functional data for mouse IFIT1 and human IFIT1 antiviral activities (Andrejeva et al., 2013; Daffis et al., 2010; Pichlmair et al., 2011; Pinto et al., 2015) , we formally tested for IFIT1 orthology between mouse and human. To do so, we first undertook detailed phylogenetic analyses of the IFIT genes found in several well-assembled mammalian genomes ( Figure 1A) . Our phylogenetic analyses were facilitated by the fact that IFIT genes are located in a single locus in most mammalian species (Liu et al., 2013) . For example, human chromosome 10 contains a single locus that encodes all five intact IFIT genes: IFIT1, IFIT1B, IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT5 ( Figure 1A) . We found the IFIT locus organization is similar in many other mammalian genomes including African green monkeys, rabbits, cats, ferrets, and armadillos ( Figure 1A ). In this shared syntenic arrangement, two IFIT1 paralogs are found next to each other in the same sense orientation as IFIT2 and In carnivores such as cats and ferrets, the IFIT locus is split with IFIT5 in one chromosomal location and the remainder of the IFITs in another. In the marmoset genome, the IFIT1B gene has been pseudogenized by frameshift and nonsense mutations, as indicated by the dashed white arrow. Note that the nomenclature for the IFIT genes marked with asterisks is as previously proposed; we suggest a revised nomenclature scheme for those genes in this report from Figure 2 IFIT3, suggesting that a single duplication of IFIT1 may have occurred early in mammalian evolution, i.e., before the radiation of placental mammals over 100 million years ago. In primates, rabbits and carnivores, the paralogs immediately adjacent to IFIT3 are named IFIT1B in sequence databases, whereas the distal paralogs are named IFIT1. Based on this previous nomenclature, we will henceforth refer to these as the IFIT1 and IFIT1B gene families. In contrast, the IFIT locus in mice and rats is arranged quite differently than other mammalian genomes. Instead of two paralogs, mice have three IFIT1 paralogs, two of which are in the opposite orientation to IFIT2 and IFIT3 ( Figure 1A) . Thus, shared synteny analyses are not suitable for assigning orthology/ paralogy relationships for the mouse IFIT1 genes. We, therefore, constructed maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of full-length IFIT gene sequences across these divergent mammalian species to determine how mouse IFIT1 genes are related to those found in other species ( Figure 1B) . We found unambiguous phylogenetic signatures that delineate IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT5 genes into distinct, monophyletic clades that diverged as expected based on known mammalian species evolution (O'Leary et al., 2013) . In contrast to these three gene families, we were unable to resolve IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes into distinct clades in our phylogenetic analyses. Instead, similar to previous studies (Liu, 2013) , we found several instances of IFIT1 and IFIT1B from the same species (e.g., cat) appearing more phylogenetically related to each other than to their similarly named genes from a sister species (e.g., ferret) ( Figure 1B) . The discordant phylogenetic signatures of IFIT1 and IFIT1B evolution could have two alternative explanations. The first is that species-specific duplication may have independently given rise to IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes in different genomes, as has been previously proposed (Liu et al., 2013) . Such a duplication pattern might explain why cat IFIT1B is more phylogenetically related to cat IFIT1 than to IFIT1B genes from other genomes. However, such an explanation would require recurrent duplication of IFIT genes in many lineages into the same genetic location and orientation, and is thus unlikely. We, therefore, considered an alternate explanation. In this alternative, IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes duplicated early in mammalian evolution but have recurrently recombined with each other. Resulting gene conversion would scramble the phylogenetic relatedness of the two genes without altering their genomic locations. Such gene conversion has been shown to contribute to the evolution of several multigene families including mammalian interferon alpha genes (Benovoy and Drouin, 2009; Hurles, 2004; Petronella and Drouin, 2011; Santoyo and Romero, 2005; Song et al., 2011; Woelk et al., 2007; Yasukochi and Satta, 2015) . To address this possibility, we compared the sequences of IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes within species and between species to look for evidence of gene conversion. We found strong characteristic signatures of gene conversion frequently occurring between the 5' portions of IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes. For example, the sequences of IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes in cats are 86% identical at the whole gene level. However, these two genes are 97% identical in the 5' ends of the genes (nucleotides 1-948 in cat IFIT1) but only 63% identical in the 3' ends of the genes ( Figure 2A ). This dichotomy is apparent even if we restrict the analysis to just synonymous substitutions, where we observe a much higher rate of synonymous substitutions in the 3' region of the alignment (Figure 2-figure supplement 1). Such an uneven distribution of sequence differences strongly suggests that the 5' ends of IFIT1 and IFIT1B underwent gene conversion recently in the evolution of the cat IFIT locus, leading to sequence homogenization of the first two-thirds of the gene. In contrast, comparing orthologous genes between species (e.g. IFIT1B between cat and ferret) reveals an even distribution of differences across the gene sequences ( Figure 2B ) indicating that both the 5' and 3' regions have diverged to the expected degree between species. Moreover, this pattern of gene conversion is seen in pairwise alignments of many IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes. For instance, between ferret IFIT1 and IFIT1B, the 5' ends are 98% identical, but 3' ends are only 62% identical ( Figure 2B) . A similar dichotomy is evident in a comparison between rabbit IFIT1 and IFIT1B and between armadillo IFIT1 and IFIT1B ( . In all cases, the 5' ends of the IFIT1 genes are largely homogenized, whereas the 3' ends appear to be consistently diverging. Thus, our findings suggest that recurrent gene conversion has confounded the phylogenetic relationships of the 5' segment of IFIT1 and IFIT1B, which likely do not accurately represent the actual ancestry of these genes. To determine the phylogenetic relationship of IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes in the absence of gene conversion, we created a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the same IFIT sequences shown in Figure 1B , but with just the nucleotide sequences 3' of the observed recombination breakpoint(s) ( Figure 2C ). In contrast to the analyses using the full-length IFIT genes ( Figure 1B ) or the 5' end of the IFIT genes (Figure 2-figure supplement 3), we now discern clear separation of IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes. Both IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes form distinct monophyletic clades that diverge according to mammalian species evolution, similar to other IFIT genes. Based on this phylogenetic concordance, as well as the agreement with synteny data, we infer that this phylogeny reflects the actual ancestry of IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes in mammals. Importantly, these data indicate that IFIT1 and IFIT1B duplicated early in mammalian evolution. Following this duplication, the 3' ends of the two genes have been diverging according to speciation events, whereas the 5' ends have recurrently recombined. These data also reveal that all three mouse IFIT1 paralogs (previously named mouse IFIT1, IFIT1b and IFIT1c) and both rat paralogs (previously named rat IFIT1 and IFIT1b) unambiguously group within the IFIT1B gene family. We, therefore, infer that mouse and rat have lost all copies of IFIT1, likely through a deletion of both IFIT1 and the neighboring IFIT5. Instead, mouse and rat genomes now bear recently duplicated copies of IFIT1B. As a result of our phylogenetic analyses, we henceforth refer to these genes as mouse/rat IFIT1B (previously mouse/rat IFIT1), IFIT1B2 (previously mouse/rat IFIT1b) and IFIT1B3 (previously mouse IFIT1c) ( Figure 2C and Figure 2 -figure supplement 4). This recombination-aware phylogenetic approach thus reveals substantial changes in the IFIT gene repertoire even within this limited number of mammalian species.
