A cDNA library was prepared from HCV-229E intracellular RNA, using a specific oligonucleotide as primer. One clone, designated 522, contained a 1.7 kb insert that hybridized to viral mRNAs 1 through 6 in Northern blots (data not shown). The size of the RNAs, as determined with DNA markers, was similar to the ones obtained by Weiss and Leibowitz (1981) . The 522 clone was selected for sequencing following creation of unidirectional deletions at both ends of the viral insert. Furthermore, the 5'-ends of nine other cDNA clones ranging in size from 0.4 to 1.5 kb were sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the unique regions of mRNAs 4 and 5, as well as the predicted amino acid sequence of the encoded polypeptides are presented in Fig. 1 . Northern blot analysis was used to confirm the proposed mRNA assignments (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 , messenger RNA 4 contains two ORFs: ORF4a and ORF4b. ORF4a extends from base 54 through base 185 and encodes a putative 44-amino acid polypeptide of 4653 Da. This ORF4a is preceded by a transcriptional initiation sequence, CUAAACU, which is located inside the 3'-end of the S gene. This sequence is similar to the consensus intergenic sequence found upstream of the N and M genes (Table 1 ). There is one potential N-glycosylation site in this predicted protein (Asn-15), as well as one potential phosphorylation site (casein T" kinase II site: Ser-42). ORF4b extends from base 200 through base 448 and encodes a putative 83-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 9550 Da. There are three potential phosphorylation sites in this predicted protein (protein kinase C sites: Ser-15, Ser-51; casein kinase II site: Ser-32). The ORF4b protein contains a high proportion of leucine and isoleucine (20%) as well as basic (16%) residues. No consensus intergenic sequence was found upstream of this ORF. A notable difference with a previously published sequence from this region of the genome (Raabe and Siddell, 1989b) is the absence in our sequence of 259 nucleotides, which code for an additional 56 and 33 amino acids in their ORF4a and ORF4b (Raabe et al., 19901, respectively . The site of this apparent deletion is indicated by a triangle in Fig. 1 . Furthermore, a termination codon in our sequence (bases 186-188) implies that five amino acids in the published 0RF4 are missing from our sequence, in the region between ORFs 4a and 4b. The actual sequencing gel data from these two regions of apparent divergence is shown in Fig. 2: shows the region of the ORF4a termination codon and panel B the region of the deletion.
