If tobacco smoking and solid-fuel use remain at their current levels, between 2003 and 2033 an estimated 65 million people will die of COPD and 18 million of lung cancer in China, accounting for 19% and 5%, respectively, of all deaths over this period. 1 82% of the COPD deaths (53 million) and 75% of lung cancer deaths (14 million) will be attributable to the combined eff ects of smoking and solid-fuel use (fi gure 2). 52% of COPD deaths and 82% of lung cancer deaths attributable to these risks will be among men. Of the 67 million COPD and lung cancer deaths attributable to smoking and solid-fuel use, over 10 million (8·1 million from COPD and 2·0 million from lung cancer) are unavoidable, even if all smokers had quit and all households had begun to use clean fuels in 2003, because the eff ect of the exposures on chronic diseases persist even after exposure ends. Men who stop smoking in 2003 are expected to lower their absolute risks of COPD by 56% and lung cancer by 60% after 5 years relative to those who continue smoking (the reductions for women are 63% for COPD and 75% for lung cancer; webfi gure 3). Risks will be lowered by 83-84% (COPD) and 83-86% (lung cancer) after 10 years and 91-92% (COPD) and 88-91% (lung cancer) after 20 years (webfi gure 3). At the population level, with moderate tobacco control, the sum of the annual avoided COPD and lung cancer deaths among men would be an estimated 4·6 and 1·9 million, respectively, 15% of all projected deaths of men from these diseases (webfi gure 4). If tobacco control is aggressive, with smoking in men declining to 15% by 2033, 8·0 million COPD deaths and 3·3 million lung cancer deaths would be averted. If female smoking gradually declines to zero by 2033, the sum of the annual avoided COPD and lung cancer deaths would be 4·9 and 0·76 million, averting 14% and 13% all projected female deaths from these diseases (webfi gure 4). Conversely, if female smoking rises to 30% by 2033, an additional 2·2 million COPD deaths and 0·60 million lung cancer deaths are expected among Chinese women. This asymmetry of benefi ts and harms occurs because the relative risks seem to rise slowly among new smokers but fall steeply in former smokers (webfi gure 3). Halving solid-fuel use by 2033 would lower the sum of the annual number of COPD and lung cancer deaths, respectively, by 2·2 million and 0·30 million in men (7% and 2% of deaths from these causes) and by 4·3 million and 0·27 million in women (12% and 5% of deaths from these causes; webfi gure 5). Proportionally, more deaths are prevented among women because they are closer to the pollution source during cooking, have higher exposure to pollutants, and hence higher relative risks. The benefi ts would be twice as large with a complete transition to clean fuels. After accounting for the overlap between the eff ects of the two risk factors, if smoking and solid-fuel use are If there is sustained 80% coverage of eff ective DOTS (webtable 2), the annual incidence of infectious tuberculosis in the three provinces presented here is estimated to decline after 2003, even if smoking and solid-fuel use remain at their current levels (fi gure 4). Nonetheless, reducing smoking and solid fuels would further reduce incidence of tuberculosis from projected levels. The estimated reductions in 2033, under diff erent scenarios of smoking and solid-fuel use, range from 10% to 23% of the projected levels in Jiangsu, 35% to 52% in Guizhou (where prevalence has increased), and 5% to 14% in Shanghai (where prevalence has been lowest; fi gure 4). Incidence of tuberculosis is projected to decline even when DOTS implementation is less eff ective. The decline in incidence in these three provinces will be 4-28% less under moderate DOTS than under optimum DOTS, and 11-79% smaller under minimum DOTS. This slower decline in tuberculosis incidence would, in turn, lead to smoking and solid-fuel interventions having larger relative and absolute benefi cial eff ects on trends in tuberculosis (fi gure 4). For example, in Jiangsu province, the relative reduction in projected incidence in 2033, under diff erent scenarios of smoking and
