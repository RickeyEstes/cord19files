A total of 2617 articles were retrieved. The average number of citations per article was 21.47. The h-index of retrieved articles was 102. Most retrieved documents were original articles (2126, 81.24 %) and most of these documents were written in English language (2355, 89.99 %). Chinese language ranked second with 120 (4.59 %) articles. Growth of publications on carbapenem resistance started in 1986 and remained at an average of ten articles per year until late 1990s. Growth of publications increased slowly from 2000 to 2008 followed by a dramatic rise in the number of publications (Fig. 1) . The oldest articles on carbapenem resistance were published in 1986. These old articles discussed imipenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides fragilis [29] [30] [31] . There was a linear increase in number of publications with time. However, the number of citations per article per year showed an inverse linear relationship with time indicating that older articles were being continuously cited with time ( Fig. 2) . Relevant terms to carbapenem resistance were analyzed for number of occurrences in article titles using VOSviewer technique. Analysis showed that "pneumoniae" was the most frequent term (305 occurrences) followed by "Acinetobacter baumannii" (302 occurrences), "Pseudomonas aeruginosa" (132 occurrences), "resistant Enterobacteriaceae" (124 occurrences), and "metallo Î² lactamase" (21 occurrences). Core journals that published most on carbapenem resistance were shown in Table 1 . A total of 1078 (41 %) articles on carbapenem resistance were published by top ten journals listed in Table 1 . Approximately 9 % (n = 232) of retrieved articles on carbapenem resistance were published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy journal (IF of 4.476). Journals in the top ten list were in the field of antimicrobials, microbiology, infection, and antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore, all journals in the top ten list were prestigious and influential ones. The journal with the highest IF was Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (IF = 5.313). Retrieved articles were published by 102 different countries distributed in all world regions. However, 68.44 % (n = 1791) of retrieved articles were published by top ten ranking countries. The list of top ten productive countries included five countries in Europe, three in Asia, one in Northern America, and one in Latin America ( Table 2 ). The United States of America (USA) had the greatest contribution with 437 (16.70 %) articles followed by China with 257 (9.82 %) articles. When productivity was stratified by population size, Greece ranked first followed by France. However, when productivity was stratified by gross domestic product (GDP), Greece ranked first followed by Spain. When quality of publications was assessed for each country by calculating the average number of citations per article, the United Kingdom (UK) ranked first followed by Greece and France. International collaboration, assessed by the number of articles with multiple country affiliations, showed that UK had the highest percentage of articles with international collaboration (82; 54.92 %) followed by France (117; 53.92 %) and Greece (40; 38.46 %). Top three countries (UK, France and Greece) engaged in international collaboration were the same top three countries which had the highest average number of citations per article. Using Poisson loglinear regression, we examined variations of three factors on the annual number of publications on carbapenem resistance. The variables tested were (1) "hospital" as a keyword in the article; (2) subject Table 3 shows that molecular biology/microbiology subject area (p < 0.01) and presence of article keyword "hospital" (p < 0.01) were significant predictors of worldwide research productivity on carbapenem resistance. The results indicated that the worldwide productivity will be 1.002 times greater for each extra article published in the field of molecular biology/microbiology. Similarly, the worldwide productivity will be 1.031 times greater for each extra article published with a keyword "hospital". The annual productivity of the top three countries was not a significant predictor (p = 0.296) of worldwide research productivity on carbapenem resistance. Research and academic institutes involved in carbapenem resistance were presented as top ten productive institutes in Table 4 . Five of top ten productive institutes were in Europe (France, Greece, UK, Italy and Switzerland) and two were in Asia (China and South Korea). Other active institutes were ones in the USA, Israel and Brazil. When ranked based on the number of published articles, Hopital de Bicetre in France ranked first followed by the University of Athens Medical School in Greece, Zhejiang University in China, VA medical center in the USA and Health Protection Agency in the UK. However, when top ten productive institutes were ranked based on quality of publications assessed by average number of citations per article, Health Protection Agency in the UK ranked first followed by Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) in the USA. At least three of top ten institutes were governmental health research institutes (VA Medical Center, CDC and Health Protection Agency). Active researchers in the field of carbapenem resistance are shown in Table 5 Six of top ten active authors on carbapenem resistance were in Europe, two in Israel, one in the USA and one in South Korea. Author co-citation analysis (ACA) for top ten active authors was carried out using VOSviewer technique. The ultimate number of authors included was 28 based on a minimum number of 100 citations per author. The map produced included 28 authors distributed into three clusters (red, green, and blue) as shown in Fig. 3 . Cluster number one included 13, cluster two included 11, and cluster three included four authors. Some of the authors might not be shown clearly in the map because some of the names were overlapping. The following top active authors were present in cluster number one (red) and were commonly co-cited together: Woodford, Livermore, Tsakris and Lee. Cluster number two (green) included the following top active authors: Carmeli, Bonomo, and Navon-Venezia. Cluster number three (blue) included the following top active authors: Nordmann and Poirel. In cluster number two (green), both Carmeli and Navon-Venezia are Israeli researchers, the former is in the field of molecular biology and the latter is in the field of preventive medicine. It is also noteworthy that both Nordman and Poirel (blue cluster) are affiliated with the same institute. Top ten cited articles on carbapenem resistance were shown in Table 6 [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Four of the top ten cited articles were published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy journal and two were published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. The article that received the highest number of citations was "Emergence of a new antibiotic resistance mechanism in India, Pakistan, and the UK: A molecular, biological, and epidemiological study". It was published in 2010 and received a total of 1212 citations. Carbapenem resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae was mentioned in the title of five top cited articles. Professors Poirel and Nordmann had good contribution to top ten cited articles.
