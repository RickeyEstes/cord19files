Sixteen of the 279 (6%) samples could not be studied with the multiplex assay because they contained RT-PCR inhibitors. At least one respiratory pathogen was detected by multiplex PCR in 171 of the 263 (65%) specimens analysed. Multiple infections were observed in 41 samples (37 with two pathogens and four with three pathogens). Thus, in total, 195 viruses and 21 bacteria were detected ( Table 1 ). The percentage of specimens testing positive varied from 74% (January 2012) to 44% (March 2012); peak incidence was at week 8, when 90% of samples tested positive. INF A (n = 50) was the most common etiologic agent detected, followed by HRV/EV (n = 35) and HBoV (n = 34). Eight pathogens accounted for more than 5% of the total (AdV, HBoV, HCoV OC43, HMPV, INF A, HRV/EV, RSV A and B, M. pneumoniae). AdV, HBoV and HRV/EV were observed throughout the study period. The incidence of influenza virus infections peaked during weeks 8 to 11. HCoV OC43, HMPV and RSV and Mycoplasma infections were more evenly distributed over the winter months (Fig. 1) . We observed no difference in the distribution of pathogens between ICUs and medical wards or between male and female patients (data not shown). Only M. pneumoniae infections were significantly more frequent in younger patients. The mean age of the patients infected with M. pneumoniae was 47 years, whereas the mean age of multiplex, permettant de dé tecter respectivement 8 virus et 21 pathogè nes respiratoires. Au total, pour 255 des 279 (91,4 %) é chantillons, les ré sultats é taient interpré tables avec les deux techniques. Au moins un pathogè ne respiratoire a é té dé tecté grâce à la PCR multiplex dans 171 é chantillons (65 %). Parmi ces é chantillons, 130 (76 %), 37 (22 %) et 4 (2 %) é chantillons é taient respectivement positifs pour un, deux et trois pathogè nes. Avec la technique d'immunofluorescence indirecte, un pathogè ne respiratoire a é té dé tecté dans 27 des 255 é chantillons (11 %) . Seulement certaines infections dé tecté es par la PCR multiplex ont é té identifé es avec la technique d'immunofluorescence indirecte : virus influenza A (15/51, 29 %), metapneumovirus (7/15, 47 %) et virus respiratoire syncytial (5/12, 42 %). Aucune des infections à adenovirus n'a é té dé tecté e avec cette technique. Comparé aux mé thodes de diagnostic conventionnelles, l'accè s à une technique de PCR multiplex augmente la fré quence de dé tection de pathogè nes respiratoires impliqué s dans les infections respiratoires aiguë s communautaires. ß 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In total, 130 (76%) of the 171 positive samples were positive for only one respiratory pathogen, 37 (22%) samples were positive for two pathogens and four (2%) were positive for three pathogens. HBoV was most frequently found associated with other pathogens in co-infections (21/34, 62%). Co-infections were also frequent with AdV and HCoV. By contrast, INF A and HRV/EV were mostly found in single infections (22% and 29%, respectively) ( Table 2) . For each pathogen, we calculated the frequency of association with other pathogens. Differences between the expected and observed rates of co-infection may indicate preferential association or mutual exclusion. Overall, the associations observed were consistent with the prevalence of the partners in the population of pathogens, with the exception of INF A and HRV/EV, which appeared to be mutually exclusive (P = 6 Â 10 À4 ). We assessed the correlation between the results obtained by multiplex real-time PCR and by other conventional microbiological methods. In total, 255 of the 279 (91.4%) samples were studied by both indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and multiplex PCR. We excluded 24 samples from the comparative study because less than 20 epithelial cells were observed in IFA and/or because they contained PCR inhibitors. IFA detected a respiratory virus in 27 of 255 (11%) specimens: 15 INF A, seven HMPV and five RSV. No double infections were picked up with this technique. IFA detected some of the INF A (15/51, 29%), HMPV (7/15, 47%) and RSV (5/12, 42%) infections identified by multiplex PCR but did not detect all the AdV infections. All positive results obtained by IFA were confirmed by multiplex real-time PCR (Fig. 2) . Multiplex real-time PCR identified 17 patients with M. pneumoniae infection. At least one serum sample was available for each patient. The first serum sample was obtained within one week of illness onset for eight patients. Only one of these samples was tested positive for anti-Mycoplasma IgM. Four other patients were tested for the first time during the second week of illness: three tested negative and the fourth tested positive for anti-Mycoplasma IgM. Samples were collected from five patients after the second week of illness: three tested positive for anti-Mycoplasma IgM. A second serum sample was available for only four patients: one patient displayed IgG seroconversion (second serum sample collected during the third week of illness); one patient displayed IgM seroconversion (second serum sample on day 133) and serological tests remained negative for the other two patients (second serum sample collected on day 13 for one patient and day 40 for the other).
