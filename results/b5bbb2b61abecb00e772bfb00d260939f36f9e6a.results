A total of 327 records of ill travelers attending a MG during international travel had surveys completed by the investigator providing their care. Thirty-one records were excluded. Of 296 ill travelers included, 151 (51.0%) were female and the median age was 54 years (range: 1-88; IQR: 39-64). Purposes of MGs were religious (243 cases; 82.1%), cultural (e.g., music, dance, carnival) (19 cases; 6.4%), the World Scout Jamboree (17 cases; 5.7%), major sport events (13 cases; 4.4%), or a large conference (4 cases; 1.4%). The top three specific MGs were Umrah or Hajj in Saudi Arabia with 241 cases (81.4%), including 87 at Umrah and 154 at Hajj, followed by the World Scout Jamboree in Japan with 17 cases (5.7%), and the Olympics in Brazil and South Korea with 9 cases (3.1%) ( [17] [18] [19] [20] ). Sixty-four percent of ill travelers who attended Umrah or Hajj were hospitalized because of their illness; one traveler who attended the World Scout Jamboree and no travelers who attended the Olympics were hospitalized. Overall, 130 of 206 (63%) ill travelers with information available reported having a pre-travel encounter with a healthcare provider. The majority (260 of 296, 87.8%) of acquired illnesses were directly associated with MG attendance, while the relation between the illness and the MG was not ascertainable for 25 travelers (8.4%), and the illness was travel-related but not linked to MG attendance for 11 travelers (3.7%). Only three of nine (33.3%) diagnoses among travelers who attended the Olympics were associated with attending the MG. A total of 303 diagnoses were reported among the 260 ill travelers whose illness was associated with MG attendance (Table 2) . Respiratory diseases were the most frequently reported disease category with 236 diagnoses (77.9%), followed by gastrointestinal diseases (14 diagnoses; 4.6%). Diagnoses related to attendance at the three most common MGs -Umrah or Hajj, World Scout Jamboree, and Olympics -are presented in Table 1 .
