Upon Intranasal VSV Infection, Myeloid Cells Accumulate in the Glomerular Layer of the OB To understand the response of CNS-resident myeloid cells such as microglia and monocytes upon virus infection via the olfactory route, wild-type (WT) mice were intranasally (i.n.) infected with VSV and sections of the OB were analyzed by immunohistology. Immunolabeling of Iba-1, a common marker for microglia and infiltrating monocytes, revealed that 4 and 6 days post-infection (dpi) increased numbers of Iba-1 + cells were present in the OB ( Figure 1A ). Quantitation of Iba-1 + cells in the glomerular cell layer of the OB, to which olfactory sensory neurons project their axons into, and in the central region called granule cell layer (see Figure S1A for details) (Kalinke et al., 2011) , showed that increased numbers of Iba-1 + cells accumulated in the glomerular layer at 4 and 6 dpi ( Figure 1B ) and significantly more Iba-1 + cells accumulated in the glomerular cell layer compared with the granule cell layer on 6 dpi ( Figure S1B ). Iba-1 + cells from control animals showed small cell bodies with long and thin processes typical of resting microglia. In contrast, Iba-1 + cells from infected animals had enlarged globular shaped cell bodies without or with short and thick processes implying an activated phenotype ( Figure 1A , inset). This was confirmed by immunolabeling of the activation marker Mac-3 that was detected on Iba-1 + cells of infected but not control animals ( Figure 1A ). Flow cytometry analysis of immune cells from the brain revealed that in control animals most CD11b + cells expressed low levels of CD45, a characteristic feature of microglia, whereas very few cells expressed high levels of CD45 ( Figure 1C ). Upon VSV infection, increased percentages of CD11b + CD45 hi cells were detected, further confirming accumulation of myeloid cells ( Figures 1C and 1D ). To address whether the increase in myeloid cells was particularly abundant in certain brain areas, OBs, cerebrae, cerebellae, and brainstems from several animals were pooled and flow cytometry was performed. In non-infected animals, all brain areas showed low abundance of CD45 hi CD11b hi cells ( Figure 1E ), whereas upon VSV infection only the OB showed significantly increased CD45 hi CD11b hi cells ( Figures 1E and 1F ). There were no significant changes in CD45 low CD11b low as well as CD45 + CD11b À cells ( Figure 1G ). In non-infected control animals, a small number of myeloid cells showed expression of the antiinflammatory marker CD206, a C-type lectin receptor, which was downregulated upon VSV infection, whereas expression of CD86, a marker of activated myeloid cells, was upregulated on myeloid cells upon infection (Figures S1C and S1D) (Greter et al., 2015) . CX3CR1, a marker expressed by myeloid cells and microglia, which is involved in microglia-neuron communication (Ransohoff and Cardona, 2010) , was expressed at particularly enhanced levels in the OB of infected animals (Figures S1C and S1D). In infected animals, most of the CD45 hi CD11b hi cells expressed high levels of Ly6C ( Figure S1D ), suggesting that many of these cells were infiltrating monocytes. Next, we analyzed whether the accumulation of Iba-1 + cells applied to the entire OB. For this, CX3CR1-cre-ER+/À tdtomato St/Wt reporter mice were tamoxifen treated. After 8 weeks, only long-lived CNS-resident myeloid cells such as microglia were marked by td-tomato reporter expression, whereas blood monocytes were replenished by non-marked cells (Figures S1E-S1G) (Goldmann et al., 2016) . Such microglia marked mice were infected i.n. with VSV and on 6 dpi light sheet microscopy was performed from the OB (Ert€ urk et al., 2011) . Threedimensional (3D) reconstruction of the OB from non-infected animals showed randomly distributed td-tomato expression, whereas upon VSV infection accumulation of td-tomato expressing microglia was detected in the periphery of the entire OB ( Figure 1H ; Video S1). Thus, immunofluorescence imaging together with flow cytometry and light sheet microscopy revealed that upon i.n. VSV infection activated myeloid cells, especially microglia, accumulated in the glomerular region of the entire OB. Myeloid Cells Present in the OB upon VSV Infection Comprise Proliferating Microglia and Infiltrating Monocytes, which Show Distinct Gene Expression Profiles Immunohistological studies revealed the presence of Iba-1 + Ki-67 + cells in the OB 6 dpi after VSV infection, but not in controls (Figures 2A and 2B, insets;  Figure S2A ), suggesting that upon infection Iba-1 + cells proliferated. To address whether accumulating Iba-1 + cells were exclusively microglia or also infiltrating monocytes, immune cells from brains of VSV-infected tamoxifen-treated CX3CR1-cre-ER+/À td-tomato St/Wt reporter mice were analyzed by flow cytometry. In these animals also VSV infection led to a significant accumulation of CD45 hi CD11b hi cells in the brain ( Figures 2C and 2D ). It is proposed that during CNS inflammation microglia can upregulate CD45 expression and become indistinguishable from infiltrating monocytes (Greter et al., 2015; Yamasaki et al., 2014) . In order to verify this, expression of the td-tomato reporter was analyzed in the CD45 hi CD11b hi population. Indeed, among CD45 hi CD11b hi cells increased numbers of td-tomato + cells were detected on 6 dpi compared with controls ( Figures 2E and 2G ). Since in these mice CNS-associated perivas- (G) Quantitation of CD45 low CD11 low and CD45 + CD11b À events in (E) (10 brain areas pooled for OB and 5 for other regions in each experiment; N = 4, combined data).

In control animals, most of the cells in the CD45 low CD11b low population expressed Tmem119, whereas basically no cells in the CD45 hi CD11b hi population expressed Tmem119 ( Figure 2F ; Figure S2B ). However, upon VSV infection, there was a significant increase in the Tmem119 + CD206 À cells within the CD45 hi CD11b hi population ( Figures 2F and 2G ), confirming the presence of microglia in the CD45 hi CD11b hi population from infected animals. A significant increase in td-tomato À Ly6C + events also confirmed infiltration of peripheral monocytes in the CNS (Figures 2E and 2G; Figures S2C and S2D) . Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling experiments in these mice revealed that CD45 low CD11b low cells did not show significant BrdU incorporation, whereas CD45 hi CD11b hi cells showed significantly increased percentages of BrdU-positive cells in infected animals (Figures 2H and 2I) . Together, these data show that upon i.n. VSV infection proliferating microglia and infiltrating monocytes accounted for the accumulation of myeloid cells within the CNS. Mice were treated as described in Figure 1 , and brains were removed on 6 dpi after PBS perfusion, unless otherwise stated.

Since we observed three different populations of myeloid cells comprising microglia and monocytes in the CNS of VSV-infected animals, we further investigated the presence of CD45 hi microglia in the OB of infected animals and characterized these cells by sorting CD45 low CD11b low microglia, CD45 hi CD11b hi td-tomato + microglia, and CD45 hi CD11b hi td-tomato À Ly6G À infiltrating monocytes, and performing RNA sequencing. In control animals, myeloid cells consisted mostly of CD45 low CD11b low microglia, with very few CD45 hi CD11b hi cells that did not express td-tomato, suggesting that these cells were not PVMs. However, upon infec-(G) Quantitation of td-tomato + and td-tomato À events in CD45 hi CD11b hi cells from (E) and Tmem119 + CD206 À events in (F) (n = 5-8, N = 2, combined data).
