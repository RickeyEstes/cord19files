By MACELISA, 392 sows out of the 1247 samples (31.4%) were positive. These positive sera were subsequently tested by the differential blocking ELISA and all proved to be PRCV-specific. In 37 out of the 58 sampled herds (64%), at least one PRCV-seropositive sow was found. The prevalence of infected farms was very similar among the different herd categories, ranging from 59% in large intensive to 71% in family herds. No overall significant differences were found between the different herd categories regarding the prevalence of infected farms ( Table 1 ) . Mean ELISA values of sera belonging to each herd category are shown in Table 2 ; these values were similar for family and small intensive herds, but they were smaller in large intensive farms. Student's t-test showed that mean ELISA values in large intensive herds were significantly smaller than in the other two farm categories. No significant differences were found between family and small intensive herds.
