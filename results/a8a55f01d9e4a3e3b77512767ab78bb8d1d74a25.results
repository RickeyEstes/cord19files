We sent out a total of 3635 questionnaires. We received a total of valid 1995 questionnaires (54.9% Clinical technical/support staff had higher motivation (Multivariate OR: 1.7; CI 1.2-2.5) than clinical staff without any significant difference in hesitation. Working at a high-risk facility was related to higher motivation than working at a low-risk facility (Multivariate OR: 1.6; CI 1.2-2.0) without any significant difference in hesitation ( Table 1 ). The associations between stress-related questions and OR are shown in Table 2 . Among the items with significant difference between the responses to the stress-related questions with strong scores and those with weak scores, ORs that are over 2.5 or under 0.4 are indicated as follows; "Being protected by the national or local government" (Multivariate OR: motivation; 3.5; CI 2.2-5.4, hesitation; 0.2; CI 0.1-0.6) and "being protected by hospital" (Multivariate OR: motivation; 2.8; CI 2.2-3.7, hesitation; 0.5; CI 0.3-0.7) were associated with higher motivation and lower hesitation. 94.1% responded that the protection from the national and local governments was weak and 79.7% responded that the protection provided by their hospital was weak. "Elevated mood" was associated with higher motivation without any significant difference in hesitation (Multivariate OR: 4.6; CI 3.3-6.5). The items with higher motivation without any significant difference in hesitation were "burden of child care including lack of nursery" (Multivariate OR: 2.7; CI 1.6-4.5). The items with higher motivation and hesitation were "anxiety about being infected" (Multivariate OR: motivation; 1.3; CI 1. The percentage of workers that considered childcare to be a burden was significantly higher among females (43.2%) than males (21.3%).
