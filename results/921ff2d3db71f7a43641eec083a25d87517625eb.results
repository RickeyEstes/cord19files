A HRV diagnosis was achieved in 252/620 (40.6%) children <6 years of age with ARI. Specifically, HRV were detected in 202/434 (46.5%) inpatients, and 50/186 (26.9%) outpatients (p < 0.01). Viral antigen detection by IF was positive in 277/620 (44.7%) children. RSV was detected in 165 (26.6%), hMPV in 53 (8.5%), followed by FluA (3.4%), PIV (3.2%), AdV (2.4%) and FluB (1.9%). A viral coinfection was observed in 61 (9.8%) patients, being HRV detected in 53 (8.5%) of them. A total of 144 (23.2%) children had a negative viral diagnosis. HRV were significantly more frequent in hospitalized patients and the presence of HRV as a single agent or in coinfection were identified as a risk factor for hospitalization: OR: 2.23 (95% CI: 1.51-3.30) and OR: 2.47 (95% CI: 1.60-4.00), respectively. Of 252 HRV positive patients, 123 (48.8%) were <12 months, while 195 (77.4%) were <2 years old. Most were males (60.3%) and breastfed (89.7%) ( Table 1) . Cough was observed in 90.1% and fever in 57.8% of patients, while tachypnea, wheezing and retraction were Table 1 Demographic and clinical characteristics of 252 children with HRV, and comparison between species A and C. Total HRV (n = 252) Phylogenetic analysis of 45 BA sequences revealed wellsupported groups for all HRV species. HRV-A was the most frequent (55%), followed by HRV-C (43%). Only one strain (2%) grouped with species B. One sample initially diagnosed as HRV, was genotyped as HEV-D68. Thus, HRV typing was performed in 44 patients. A phylogenetic analysis per species was performed and genotypes were assigned according to the clustering of BA strains with reference sequences (Fig. 1) . Thirty different genotypes were detected: 14 HRV-A, 1 HRV-B and 15 HRV-C. The seven most frequent genotypes were observed as monophyletic clusters, named A1-A5 and C1-C2, based on the time of detection. Clusters were genotyped as HRV-A78 (A1), HRV-A55 (A3), HRV-A101 (A4), HRV-A49 (A5), HRV-C10 (C1) and HRV-C40 (C2). Cluster A2 could not be genotyped because the pairwise p-distance in VP4/VP2 obtained with the closest reference genotype (HRV-A78) was higher than 12.5%. No recombination events were observed in the analyzed fragment. Demographic, clinical characteristics and outcome were similar with either HRV-A (n = 24) or HRV-C (n = 19) ( Table 1) . Of 17 outpatients, 47% had HRV-A and 53% had HRV-C. URTI was observed in 47%, bronchiolitis in 29% and wheezing in 24%. Regarding 27 inpatients, 60% had HRV-A, 37% HRV-C and 1 case HRV-B. Of these, 82% had bronchiolitis, 11% pneumonia and 7% URTI. The clinical outcome, including length of stay, oxygen supplementation, intensive care or mechanical ventilation, was similar with either HRV-A or C ( Table 2) . HRV circulation occurred throughout the whole year in both years (June 2008-May 2010), with peaks at the beginning of autumn and spring. A variable frequency was observed during winter and a low frequency in summer (Fig. 2) . HRV-A and C strains were detected throughout the whole year, and the only HRV-B strain was detected in June, 2009. Several HRV genotypes cocirculate: seven monophyletic clusters, including genetically close strains, predominated during certain months, simultaneously with others genotypes that were detected only once. The estimated time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for the 24 BA strains HRV-A was 18.5 years (highest probability density (HPD) 95%: 5-91), and for the 19 strains HRV-C was 84.8 years (HPD 95%: 11.8-703.0). The substitution rate (expressed in nucleotide substitutions/site/year (s/s/year)) for the VP4/VP2 partial region was also estimated, and was similar for both HRV species: 2.3 × 10 −2 (HPD 95%: 1.4 × 10 −8 -5.3 × 10 −2 ) for HRV-A and 1.9 × 10 −2 (HPD 95%: 1.1 × 10 −5 -5.8 × 10 −2 ) for HRV-C. In addition, the BSP analysis showed a constant demographic profile throughout almost 100 years. Demographic reconstruction of clusters (A1-A5 and C1-C2) obtained in the MCC trees are shown on a time scale, in order to describe the detection time of the BA strains and the association to their corresponding ancestor, each one belonging to a different HRV genotype (Fig. 2) . From June 2008 to March 2009, all BA clusters detected were HRV-A (A1-A4). In March and June two HRV-C clusters (C1-C2) appeared, while by the end of the study a different HRV-A cluster (A5) was observed.
