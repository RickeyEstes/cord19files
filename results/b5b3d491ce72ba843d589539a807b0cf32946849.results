Infectious illness occurred in 6% of weeks, with upper respiratory illness the predominant syndrome. Among 60 (45%) TC-exposed and 73 (55%) non-TC-exposed babies, infectious disease reports did not differ in frequency between groups (likelihood ratio test: p = 0.88). Medical visits with antibiotic prescriptions were less common in the TC group than in the non-TC group (7.8% vs. 16  From July, 2011 to February, 2015, 158 mothers were enrolled in the STORK cohort, of whom 154 (97%) participated in the TC intervention (78 (51%) randomized to the TC group and 76 (49%) to the non-TC group; Fig 1) . The reason for non-participation in the intervention was the desire to continue use of their current wash products (4/4, 100%). At enrollment into the intervention, approximately one third of mothers were expecting a first child; their average age was 30 years, 64% were Hispanic, and 59% were foreign-born (Table 1) . Households contained a median of four residents, of whom approximately two were children aged less than 18 years; households were clean but overcrowded [19] with a median of 1.2 people per room. Maternal exposure to cleaning products and chemicals outside of the home was quite common (22%) and most mothers bathed at least once daily (88%). No differences in any of these characteristics were observed between intervention groups. Follow-up of mothers during pregnancy was similar for both intervention groups (median proportion of weekly surveys completed from enrollment to delivery: 89% for both TC and non-TC groups, p = 0.75). Loss to follow-up or withdrawal from the study prior to the baby's birth (n = 21) was more common overall in the TC than in the non-TC group (18 (23%) vs. 3 (4%), p<0.001; Fig 1) . Nine mothers could not be contacted and were lost to follow-up; for the remaining 12 mothers, reasons for withdrawal included: a move away from the area (n = 4), time commitment perceived as too great (n = 3), unwillingness to provide blood from the baby (n = 2), a miscarriage (n = 1) and no specific reason (n = 2); no provided reason for withdrawal appeared related to the intervention. Totals of 60 and 73 babies providing at least one weekly survey were born into the TC and non-TC groups respectively, constituting the analysis sample (mITT; Supporting Information-S1 Table) . Both follow-up time and proportion of households withdrawn from the study were similar between groups ( Table 2) . Babies in the two groups were equally likely to be breastfed and for the same amount of time. Use of day care also was not different between intervention groups. Among babies, infectious disease symptoms were more common in winter months and with increasing age; babies younger than 80 days (~2.6 months) of age rarely experienced infectious diseases symptoms (Supporting Information-S1 Fig).
