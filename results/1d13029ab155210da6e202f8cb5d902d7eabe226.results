The PCR screening of 71 suspected fecal samples revealed 29 (40.85%) samples as positive for canine parvovirus ( Figure-2) showing band size of 583 bp using the earlier published primers [6] . The incidence study was calculated with respect to total positive (29) cases as well as total suspected cases (71). The breedwise incidence rate calculated over positive cases was found to be higher in Deshi/local breeds (34.48%), followed by German shepherd (17.24%), equal incidence in mixed and Labrador retriever (10.34%), Rottweiler and German spitz showed 6.9% each and lower incidences in four breeds (3.45%) such as Dalmatians, Nea politan mastiff, Pug and Great Dane (Table-1 ). Similarly incidence rate over total screened cases was found to be the highest in Deshi breeds (14.09%) and lower incidence of 1.41% is shared equally in four breeds such as Dalmatians, Nea politan mastiff, Pug and Great Dane (Table-1) . Age-wise prevalence study over the positive cases revealed the infection being more in the age group of 3-6 months (41.37%), followed by equal incidences in 1-3 months age group and 6-12 months (27.59%), and a low incidence in age groups above 12 months (3.45%) ( Table-2 ). The age-wise distribution pattern was represented in the Figure-3 . The incidence was predominantly higher in males (86.21%) in comparison to females (13.79%) with respect to total positive cases ( Figure-4) , whereas the incidence rate over total suspected cases was found to be 35.21% in males and 5.63% in females (Table-3 ).
