3.1. Analytical specificity of PEDV RT-iiPCR, PDCoV RT-iiPCR, and duplex PEDV/PDCoV rRT-PCR assays As shown in Table 2 , the PEDV RT-iiPCR and duplex PEDV/PDCoV rRT-PCR (reporter dye for PEDV detection) as well as the reference PEDV rRT-PCR only specifically reacted with PEDV and did not cross-react with other enteric pathogens including PDCoV, TGEV Purdue strain, TGEV Miller strain, PHEV, porcine rotaviruses (Groups A, B and C), PRCV, E coli, S. typhimurium, C. difficile, C. perfringens, B. hyodysenteriae, and L. intracellularis. Similarly, the PDCoV RT-iiPCR and duplex PEDV/PDCoV rRT-PCR (reporter dye for PDCoV detection) as well as the reference PDCoV rRT-PCR only specifically reacted with PDCoV and did not cross-react with other enteric pathogens (Table 2) .
