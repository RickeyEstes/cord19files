Bioengineering and Mutasynthesis of Streptomyces sp. A92-308110 Previous semisynthetic derivatization to replace the spirolactam fragment of sanglifehrin A led to generation of the sangamides, molecules with improved solubility, potency, and selectivity (Moss et al., 2012) . This approach moved the immunosuppressive NPs from tool compounds appropriate for chemical genetics to being compounds that could reasonably be pursued as therapeutic agents. We then used bioengineering to make further alterations to the macrocyclic portion of the molecule, changes that could not have otherwise been done without complex total synthesis. The major aim of this work was to further improve the drug-like properties of the final molecule by specific manipulation of the parts of the molecule involved in cyclophilin binding. The gene cluster required for biosynthesis of sanglifehrin A has been published (Qu et al., 2010) . Generation of the sanglifehrins requires 13 typical PKS extension modules and three nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) modules incorporating L-valine, meta-L-tyrosine, and L-piperazic acid. In addition, a crotonyl-CoA reductase/carboxylase (CCR) is present for generation of the PKS starter unit (2E)-2-ethylmalonyl-CoA, an iterative type I PKS is required for the supply of the unique (2S)-2-(2-oxobutyl)malonyl-CoA extender unit, and a phenylalanine hydroxylase produces the NRPS extender unit meta-L-tyrosine from L-phenylalanine. Analysis of the published crystal structures of sanglifehrin A (Kallen et al., 2005) and an analog with the spirolactam fragment removed (Sedrani et al., 2003) suggested that manipulation of the electronics on the meta-L-tyrosine moiety might lead to improved binding to cyclophilins. To achieve this, we inactivated sfaA, the gene encoding the phenylalanine hydroxylase responsible for meta-L-tyrosine biosynthesis. Deletion of sfaA was carried out by homologous recombination, following conjugation of a plasmid containing the appropriate deletion construct into Streptomyces sp. A92-308110 using standard techniques (Kieser et al., 1999) , and led to the strain BIOT-4585. Due to the lack of meta-L-tyrosine production, BIOT-4585 did not produce sanglifehrin A unless fed with meta-L-tyrosine or an analog.
