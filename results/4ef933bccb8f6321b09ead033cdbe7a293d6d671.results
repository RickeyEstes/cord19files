The grade of lymphoid depletion/tissue (normal, mild, moderate and severe) and the severity of lymphoid depletion/animal (LD) (none, mild, moderate and severe) on H&E slides are depicted in Tables 1 and 3 . The spleen was the lymphoid organ in which the cellular depletion (number of follicles and cellular density) was more evident and frequent (Table 3) . It was not possible to carry out the histological evaluation due to autolysis in two cases. One case did not show immune depletion with H&E and the rest of the animals studied presented some degree of lymphoid depletion (7 mild, 5 moderate and 2 severe). The grade of LD per animal did not depend on the origin of the animal, whether it was free or captive, or the cause of death, and it increased with age: mild LD was found mainly in young or young-adult animals while moderate and severe LD was more frequent in aged animals. LD was also severe in two Iberian lynxes suffering tuberculosis (Cases 16 and 17). Hyaline substance deposition was commonly observed in lymphoid follicles with evident lymphoid depletion (Fig. 1) . Besides traumatic lesions, the most interesting histopathological findings were pneumonia, epithelial neoplasms and tuberculosis (Table 1) . Five individuals (Cases 6, 11, 12, 16 and 17) presented neoplasia (squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and urinary bladder 'in situ' carcinoma) and/or tuberculosis (M. bovis, PCR). In one of the cases with tuberculosis (Case 11), the granulomas were only found in the lung (tuberculous primary complex); in another case with disseminated tuberculosis (Case 16) the main tuberculosis lesions were found in liver and lymph nodes, although small granulomas were also observed in the lung; another animal with a history of blindness (since 3 months of age) with generalized tuberculosis (Case 17), granulomas of tuberculosis were found in lung, liver, lymph nodes, both adrenal glands, and in both ocular globes (bilateral tuberculos granulomatous uveitis). In all granulomas acid-fast bacilli were histologically identified by the Ziehl-Neelsen technique and immunohistochemistry. Multinucleated cells (2-5 nuclei) were observed in the granulomas. No evidence of feline immunosuppressive virus infection (feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukaemia virus, feline coronavirus and feline panleukopenia virus) was found in any of the individuals. CD3, CD79, MAC387 and CD68 immunohistochemistry is represented in Fig. 2 . CD3 immunostaining was seen labeling cells in T areas (periarteriolar lymphoid sheets and marginal zones in splenic white pulp and parafollicular areas in lymph nodes and MALT) (Fig. 3) ; CD79 positive cells were found in B areas (lymphoid follicles) ( Fig. 4a and b) . MAC387 stained large macrophages mainly located in splenic red pulp, medular lymph node and MALT (Fig. 4c) ; CD68 labeled scarce macrophages, dendritic cells and follicular dendritic cells (Fig. 4d) . The spleen was the organ with less immunostaining of the cellular subpopulations analyzed. Comparing the results among the leukocyte subpopulations studied (Fig. 2) , T cells (CD3-positive cells) were seriously decreased in most of the tissues analyzed, being the spleen the tissue with the most striking reduction; B cells were decreased in many cases in the spleen and lymph nodes but normal or increased in MALT; In many animals, coexisting reductions in both B (CD79) and T (CD3) cell subpopulations was observed in the spleen (13/15, 86.6%) and lymph nodes (12/15, 80.0%). Levels of macrophages and dendritic cells (positive cells to MAC387 and CD68, respectively) were normal in MALT samples; MAC387-positive cells were mildly reduced in some lymph nodes (5/15, 33.3% of the cases); splenic MAC387 and CD68 positive subpopulations were normal (MAC387 8/15, 53.3%; CD68 6/15, 46.6%) or increased (MAC387 7/15, 46.6%; CD68 8/15, 53.3%). Histologically, the 2-year-old Iberian lynx thymus sample was involutioned with abundant interlobular adipose tissue and low cellularity of lymphoid tissue, therefore, it was not included in the immunohistochemical study. The other two samples of thymus (from Iberian lynxes aged 16 and 17 months) were mildly involutioned with defined thymic lobules and medium cellularity. In these two cases, there were mild and severe reductions of CD3 positive subpopulations.
