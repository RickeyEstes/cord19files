A total of 3 879 papers were retrieved from the three databases; 39 of which were screened and 12 excluded, leaving 26 in the final analysis. Of these 13 studies provided data suitable for the calculation of relative risks, 5 giving psychological outcomes, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] and 12 non-physiological; [18, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] and 8 provided data for the calculation of standardised mean differences, 6 giving psychological outcomes, [20, 29, [32] [33] [34] [35] ] and 3 non-psychological. [25, 28, 36] A further 6 studies did not provide raw data but are included in the results; 3 each giving psychological outcomes [37] [38] [39] and non-psychological outcomes. [16, 40, 41] As it had been decided not to attempt statistical pooling of study results, the data from studies are shown as forest plots but without meta-analysis. The forest plots contain results from the studies where sufficient data were given to calculate either the relative risk or standardised mean difference. A number of studies provided data on those under contact precautions, but no comparative data and so were not included. [42] [43] [44] [45] Because of the large number of non-psychological outcomes for which RR could be calculated, it was decided that a change of 20% (i.e. a RR of 0.8 or less, or 1.2 or more) would be clinically significant, regardless of the statistical significance. Results are shown in Figures 1 to 5. Figure 5 contains results that did not meet our criteria for being clinically significant (see supplemental information). The studies included were primarily single-centre and consisted of case-control, cross-sectional and cohort studies. Although these studies have limited generalisability, there did not appear to be significant cause for concern regarding bias within the limitation inherent in these study designs. Full details of each study is given in the supplementary information. The data from the comparative studies suggest that although in many cases contact precautions makes little difference to psychological outcomes, where it does make a difference this is primarily negative. There were significant declines in mean scores related to control and self-esteem, and in many studies increases in the mean scores for risk of anxiety and depression. However, these findings were not consistent, and some larger studies showed little or no difference between the groups for these outcomes. These are shown in Figures 1 and 2 Studies not reporting the raw data showed that contact precautions were associated with depression OR 1.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5) but not anxiety OR 0.8 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.1) in a non-ICU population. [40] There was also an association with delirium OR, 1.40 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.51); although this was primarily among those who were newly diagnosed as needing isolation OR, 1.75 (95% CI 1.60 to 1.92, p<0.01) rather than those who had been under contact precautions for their entire stay OR 0.97 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.09, p=0.60). [16] Another study showed no difference in the median values for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety or depression scores (HADS-A and -D), or the EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale EQ VAS scores. [41] For non-psychological outcomes, using a difference in the risk of +/-20% of an event as being a measure of clinical significance it appears there was a trend for less attention to be given to, and for more errors to occur in those who were isolated. However, again there was wide variation between studies. Data on these outcomes are given in Figures 3 and 4 , and the non-clinically significant risks in the supplementary information ( Figure 5 ). 1000 patient-days (p<0.0001). [38] Other studies found that staff spent less time with those on contact precautions: internal medicine interns spent less time with their isolated patients compared to non-isolated patients, the median times being 5.2 and 6.9 minutes respectively (p<0.001) [37] ; while the mean number of contacts per hour with healthcare workers was 2.1 compared to 4.2 in those not isolated (p=0.03), although the duration was longer at 4.5 minutes compared to 2.8 (p=0.6). [39] Discussion Current recommendations say that contact precautions should include a single room, with personal protective equipment consisting of a gown and gloves for all patient contacts or contacts with potentially contaminated environmental areas. [1] This review has shown that there are a number of apparently negative aspects to contact Although at times there are discussions as to the necessity of contact precautions for drug resistant organisms, with some arguing that that there is mixed evidence for or against their use [46] another recent review has concluded that they are of great importance in the control of epidemic and endemic multidrug-resistant microorganisms. [47] The ethics of using contact precautions and other forms of isolation rely on a positive assessment of the balance between the risks and benefits of this to the individual concerned and that of the broader population of patients and staff. [48] However, even when this assessment is positive, it is important to ensure that any harm to the individual is minimised. A total of 3 879 papers were retrieved from the three databases; of which 38 were assessed for eligibility by reading the full text. Of these 13 studies provided data suitable for the calculation of risk ratio, 5 giving psychological outcomes, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] and 12 non-psychological; [19, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] and 8 provided data for the calculation of standardised mean differences, 6 giving psychological outcomes, [21, 30, [33] [34] [35] [36] and 2 non-psychological. [29, 37] A further 6 studies did not provide raw data but are included in the results; 3 each giving psychological outcomes [38] [39] [40] and nonpsychological outcomes. [17, 41, 42] Meta-analyses were possible on two outcomes: anxiety and depression from 8 studies using standardised mean difference. [19] [20] [21] 30, [33] [34] [35] [36] Where only risk ratio data were given [20, 21] conversion to standardised mean difference was undertaken using the Campbell Collaboration calculator (https://campbellcollaboration.org/research-resources/effect-sizecalculator.html). [43] Where it was not possible to pool outcome data because of methodological and clinical heterogeneity, the data from studies are shown as forest plots but without meta-analysis. The forest plots contain results from the studies where sufficient data were given to calculate either the risk ratio or standardised mean difference. A number of studies provided data on those under contact precautions, but no comparative data and so were not included. [44] [45] [46] [47] The studies included were primarily single-centre and consisted of case-control, cross-sectional and cohort studies. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottowa scale, full details of each study and its risk of bias are in the Supplementary File 5. [48] Overall, although these studies have limited generalisability, there did not appear to be significant cause for concern regarding bias within the limitations inherent in these study designs. Most studies used established or validated tools [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [23] [24] [25] 27, 29, 30, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] or clinical outcomes. [22, 26, 28, 31, 32] The data from the comparative studies suggest that although in many cases infective isolation precautions make little difference to psychological outcomes, where it does make a difference this is primarily negative. There were significant declines in mean scores related to control and self-esteem, and in many studies increases in the mean scores for risk of anxiety and depression. However, these findings were not consistent, and some larger studies showed little or no difference between the groups for these outcomes. These are shown in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. For non-psychological outcomes, using a difference in the risk of +/-20% of an event as being a measure of clinical significance it appears there was a trend for less attention to be given to, and for more errors to occur in those who were isolated. However, again there was wide variation between studies. Data on these outcomes are given in Figures 5 and 6 , and the non-clinically significant risks in the Supplementary Figure 1 . For those outcomes associated with quality, the median risk ratio (with positive outcomes reversed so a higher risk ratio is associated with a worse Although at times there are discussions as to the necessity of contact precautions for drug resistant organisms, with some arguing that that there is mixed evidence for or against their use [49] another recent review has concluded that they are of great importance in the control of epidemic and endemic multidrug-resistant microorganisms. [50] The ethics of using contact precautions and other forms of isolation rely on a positive assessment of the balance between the risks and benefits of this to the individual concerned and that of the broader population of patients and staff. [51] However, even when this assessment is positive, it is important to ensure that any harm to the individual is minimised. One way of balancing the various priorities is to use the GRADE Evidence to Decision Framework, which provides criteria for making recommendations at the individual, group and policy-levels, and provides a number of highly patient focussed criteria for doing this. In addition to the certainty of evidence and resource requirements, it also requires consideration of: the balance of desirable and undesirable effects; the impact upon equity; and the feasibility and acceptability of the email, text and internet increased these. [53] This was not an area investigated in any depth in these studies. Another area where information may be lacking is that of age, as older people in particular might feel sadness and loneliness more; and gender, as qualitative data suggest that women in isolation were more concerned about precautions and transmission while men were more resigned, rational and tended to cope better. [54] In some countries, such as the United States single-rooms have become the standard for new hospitals and so one might expect fewer adverse effects if everyone is in a single room, this being the norm. However it may be that a single room is necessary but not sufficient for these findings, and that it is the combination of a single room with an infection that leads to these results. Certainly it is far from clear that the long list of advantages claimed for single rooms which include reduced stress, the ability to deliver better care, and a lower probability of dietary or medication errors apply to this group of patients.
