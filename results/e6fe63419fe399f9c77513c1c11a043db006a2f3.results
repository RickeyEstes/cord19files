Cross-validation Results. The final features of this method were described by FV w,λ. , a value that contains information on the composition of the adjacent w-nucleotides (Gao and Zhang 2004) and λ -interval nucleotides. The association information was also captured by FV w,λ . Therefore, this method achieves improved performance compared with using the original Z-curve. The following results solidly confirmed this point. We performed a 5-fold cross-validation test with w ranging from 2 to 4 and λ ranging from 0 to 5. The detailed results are provided in mitigate these disadvantages. The support vector machine (SVM)-recursive feature extraction (RFE)+correlation bias reduction (CBR) method was adopted to rank these features in descending order based on the contribution of each feature.

This process was repeated until the top 4,500 features had been added according to the rank order. The test results of each model were evaluated according to the AUC scores via a 5-fold cross-validation test. The AUC values for different top features are shown in Figure 1 Among all 4,545 features examined, the best AUC of 0.8814 was achieved for the top 800 selective features. The final AUC value was 8.12% higher than that for FV 2,0 . To conduct an objective evaluation of this method, we performed a rigorous jackknife test based on the top 800 selected features using the parameters determined via a 5-fold cross-validation test. We obtained an AUC value of 0.8854. As expected, excellent performance was obtained after adopting the λ -interval nucleotide All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Those results illustrated that the essentiality of human genes could be well reflected by only sequence information. As we are extremely interested in the actual essential genes in the predicted results, we used the positive predictive value (PPV) to further refine. This evaluation index can be calculated using the formula TP / (TP+FP), where TP (true positive) and FP (false positive) represent the number of real essential and non-essential genes among the positive predictions. Therefore, the PPV reflects the proportion of actual essential genes among the predicted essential genes. We obtained a PPV of 73.05% (TP=515, FP=190) using the jackknife test based on the top 800 features. One of the simplest cross validation tests is the holdout method. In this procedure, the dataset is separated into two subsets, namely, training and testing datasets. We randomly sampled one-fifth of the positive and negative samples from the benchmark dataset for the training model, and the remaining samples were used as the testing dataset. To comprehensively assess the method used in the present study, we repeated the holdout method 100 times to identify differences in the composition of the training and testing samples. The mean AUC score was used as the final evaluator. A mean AUC score of 0.8537 with a variance of 1.67e-005 was obtained. Additionally, the proportions of samples in the training and predicting datasets were changed for further investigation. One-tenth of the positive and negative samples were randomly sampled as the training dataset, and the remaining samples were used as the testing dataset. This procedure was repeated 100 times. We obtained a mean AUC score of 0.8347 with a variance of 2.77e-005. These results further confirmed that this method was robust and accurate. 1 0
