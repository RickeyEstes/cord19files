A total of 331 patients were enrolled in the study: 224 were from the United States, 38 from Germany, 17 from Brazil, 17 from Canada, 12 from the United Kingdom, seven from South Africa, five from France, four from Italy, three from Peru, two from Spain, and two from Sweden. Of these, 326 patients received at least one dose of study drug and were evaluated as the FAS. The PPS comprised 204 patients who had proven or probable IA infection at baseline and received at least seven doses of study drug. Of the 326 patients who received at least one dose of study drug, 101 were excluded because the diagnosis did not meet the protocol-specified criteria as determined by the independent review panel. The resultant 225 patients comprised the mFAS e patients who had proven or probable IA infection at baseline and received at least one dose of study drug. The demographics of the patients enrolled (mFAS) are described in Table 1 . Of note, 58 subjects were children (25.8%) and, of these, 27 (12.0%) were under the age of 10 years. The youngest patient enrolled was 3 months of age; the oldest was 82 years. Only 66 patients (29.3%) had profound neutropenia at enrollment, although 32.9% (74/225) had this as their primary risk factor for IA. Thirty-six of the 66 patients with profound neutropenia at baseline (54.5%) had recovery of neutropenia during treatment with micafungin, but the timing of recovery was not recorded systematically. Within the mFAS group there were 29 patients with IA in whom micafungin was used as primary therapy. Among the mFAS, 192/225 (85.3%) patients were enrolled as refractory patients and four (1.8%) as toxicity failures. Of the 192 refractory patients, 153 (79.7%) had documented progression, 35 (18.2%) had stable disease at baseline, and four were indeterminate, as
