There were 165,000 ambulance dispatch calls in 1997, increasing to 260,000 in 2005. The mean number of dispatches per week was 3240 in 1997 and 4990 in 2005; the mean, per week, for all years combined was 4253. This varied by month, tending to be lowest in January and highest in August, although the pattern also varied from year to year. For all years combined, the mean number of weekly dispatches in January was 3936, and the corresponding figure for August was 4415. Across all years and all months, the mean weekly number of respiratory dispatches per 1000 total dispatches was 103 (standard deviation 12.4, range 73-146). The smoothed, averaged baseline values varied from 91 in January to 115 in August (Table 1) . For the period 2002-2005, 'influenza' as recorded in the locum service data and 'respiratory or breathing problems' as recorded in the ambulance dispatch data displayed similar seasonal patterns (Fig. 1 ) (2002-2005 was the only period for which locum service data were available). The baseline during non-influenza months was approximately 90 per 1000 ambulance dispatches; in contrast, for the locum service data, it was close to zero. Related to this, the plot for the ambulance dispatch data was less peaked for 2003 (a year known to have higher-than-expected seasonal activity 22 ) than the plot for the locum service data (Fig. 1) . In short, the seasonal pattern was more blurred for the ambulance dispatch data than the locum service data. Use of subclassifications of respiratory or breathing problems, available in the Medical Priority Dispatch System, 13 did not reduce the blurring (data not shown). The CUSUM method was applied to the ambulance dispatch data for the period 1997-2005 to highlight the underlying patterns in the data. The CUSUM signals were compared with previously published analyses based on the GP sentinel surveillance data which reported an epidemic year in 1997 10 and higher-thanexpected seasonal activity in 1998 10 and 2003 22 (Fig. 2) . The GP sentinel surveillance data reached the threshold for higher-than-expected seasonal activity ( Table 2 ).
