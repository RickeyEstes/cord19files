Transmissible HA Variants Arise in Ferrets 1918-like avian viral replication was limited in directly inoculated animals, and neither virus nor specific antibodies were detected in contact ferrets (Watanabe et al., 2014) . Introducing the mammal-adapting substitution PB2 E627K enhanced replication (Figures S1A, S1B, and S1E), but not transmission. To assess the impact of known mammalian-adapting mutations in HA on transmission of this virus, HA E190D and G225D (H3, mature peptide numbering) were introduced into the 1918-like avian/ PB2 E627K virus, generating what we will term the ''avian-like'' ''HA190D225D'' virus. Deep sequencing showed that both HA E190D and G225D arose naturally before being introduced: each was detectable in one animal 5 days after inoculation with the 1918-like avian virus ( Figures 1A and 1B) . HA E190D became dominant in all three animals inoculated with the 1918-like avian/PB2 E627K virus ( Figure 1C ). The HA190D225D virus was transmitted in 1 of 3 ferret pairs (Figures S1C and S1F). To characterize mutations occurring in HA190D225D, we analyzed RNA isolated from stock viruses and from nasal secretions from all three index animals and the infected contact. We included stock viruses in this analysis both to define ''input'' viral populations and because even viruses created by reverse ge-netics can accumulate mutations during passage in culture. We enumerated all SNPs occurring at R1% frequency in each virus sequenced; we previously established that this conservative cutoff ensures that only bona fide mutations are considered (Wilker et al., 2013) . Sequencing revealed that two additional HA mutations arose and were transmitted. HA G400A, encoding serine-to-asparagine at amino acid 113 (S113N), was present in 3% of viruses in the HA190D225D stock and rose to 46%-75% in all three index animals by 3 days post-inoculation, declining on day 5 (Figure 1D , solid traces). S113N was detected in 63% of viruses in the contact soon after transmission ( Figure 1D , broken trace). The second mutation, HA A868T, encoded aspartate-to-valine at position 265 (D265V). D265V was not detectable in the virus stock above 1% but increased in frequency in all three index animals and was present in 40% of viruses transmitted to the contact ( Figure 1E ). Both S113N and D265V are located near the base of the HA globular head ( Figure 1F ). Cloning and sequencing of full-length HA from day 5 showed that S113N and D265V were linked in a small fraction of viruses (2/20 [10%] clones in index and 1/32 [3.125%] in contact; Figures  S2A and S2B ). Viruses were next isolated from the contact animal's nasal wash at day 9 post-contact and amplified on MDCK cells to produce the ''Mut'' stock virus, which was used to inoculate another three ferret pairs (Watanabe et al., 2014) . The Mut virus exhibited similar replication kinetics and pathogenicity to human-derived 1918 viruses and was transmitted in 2/3 pairs (Figures S1D and S1F) (Watanabe et al., 2014) . HA S113N and D265V were maintained at frequencies comparable to those in the inoculum (Figures 1G and 1H, solid traces) . Another novel HA mutation, HA T634C, arose, encoding isoleucine-to-threonine at position 187 (I187T) near the receptor-binding pocket ( Figure 1F ). Present at 4% in the Mut stock virus, I187T rose to 32%-41% in all three index animals by day 5 post-inoculation and was fixed after transmission in contact animal 1 ( Figure 1I ). I187T was not transmitted to contact animal 3 but arose on day 9 post-contact. The rapid increase of I187T in all index animals and its independent re-generation in contact animal 3 strongly suggest that this mutation is advantageous. Indeed, all 17 publicly available human 1918 sequences have 187T, as do 310/338 full-length avian H1N1 HAs (Reid et al., 1999 (Reid et al., , 2003 Sheng et al., 2011; Taubenberger et al., 1997) . S113N, D265V, and I187T were not all transmitted together. S113N was fixed in contact animal 3 after transmission, while D265V and I187T were undetectable (Figures 1G-1I, light blue broken traces). By contrast, D265V and I187T were fixed after transmission in contact animal 1, and S113N was undetectable ( Figures 1G-1I , dark blue broken traces). Cloning and Sanger sequencing showed that S113N and D265V were linked at % 33% frequency in Mut index animals 1 and 3 (Figures S3C and S3D); we cannot determine from these data why S113N and D265V were not transmitted together. Our results suggest that in this genetic context, HA 190D and 225D may benefit transmission, but multiple other SNPs may also bestow increased transmission efficiency. Selection Maintains HA Polymorphism HA G225D is associated with a switch from a-2,3to a-2,6-linked sialic acid receptor binding in H1N1 viruses (Tumpey et al., 2007; Lakdawala et al., 2015) . Introducing HA190D and 225D into the 1918-like avian virus in the laboratory likely affected the evolutionary pathway these viruses followed, and we cannot know how evolution would have proceeded in their absence. Once introduced, HA 225D remained at or near fixation in all HA190D225D-infected animals ( Figure S3A ). Although G225D was present in 97% of the Mut stock virus, its frequency decreased to 72%-87% by day 5 post-inoculation in all three index animals ( Figure 1J , solid traces). Sequencing at day 5 revealed glycine at position 225 (225G) in 9%-15% of viruses . Also, an asparagine (225N) was now encoded by 8%-13% of viruses in index animals 1 and 3 (Figures S3B-S3D). HA 225D was fixed after transmission in both contacts, but its frequency declined to 93% in contact 3 by day 9 (Figure 1J) . Indeed, by day 5 viruses encoded a mixture of 225D/ 225N in contact 1 and 225D/225N/225G in contact 3 ( Figures  S3B and S3C ). Thus, G225D may be favored during transmission between hosts, but polymorphism at 225 seems to be tolerated within a host. The upper respiratory tract contains a mixture of cell types with different sialic acid receptors (Chandrasekaran et al., 2008; Jayaraman et al., 2012; Matrosovich et al., 2004; Thompson et al., 2006) . Various anatomical sites and cell types may exert differing degrees of selective pressure favoring a-2,3or a-2,6-tropic viruses (Lakdawala et al., 2015) . HA 225N was identified in severe human infections during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (Kong et al., 2014; Mak et al., 2010; Matos-Patró n et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2013) . It enables binding to both a-2,6 and a-2,3 receptors and increases binding to non-sialylated glycans (Matos-Patró n et al., 2015) . Diversity at position 225 may therefore be maintained due to balancing selection, which preserves multiple beneficial alleles in a population. Alternatively, increasing diversity at site 225 could be due to relaxation of selection, but this hypothesis would not explain the significant increase in nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity we observed in this region, as described below. The inverse frequencies of S113N and D265V could similarly be explained by balancing selection. S113N was shown to compensate for a loss of HA heat stability due to substitutions E190D and G225D (Watanabe et al., 2014) , a phenotype associated with transmissibility in other influenza viruses (de Vries et al., 2014; Imai et al., 2012; Linster et al., 2014) . D265V is located proximal to S113N ( Figure 1F ) and may serve a similar function in modulating heat stability. We hypothesize that during the early stages of mammalian adaptation, selective pressures (e.g., diverse receptor profiles, temperatures, and host factors) may promote accumulation and maintenance of a large number of mutations in HA that later can be selected by the new host environment (Lauring et al., 2012; Parrish et al., 2008) .
