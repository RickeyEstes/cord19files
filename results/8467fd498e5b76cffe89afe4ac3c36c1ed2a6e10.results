Prior to employing the Gregory and Hansen (1996) cointegration test, we employed the conventional ADF and PP unit root tests as well as the Lagrange multiplier (LM) unit root test with one structural break proposed by Lee and Strazicich (2003) to establish the order of integration of the variables. The results are not reported to conserve space, but the findings for all three unit root tests suggest that spot and futures prices at 1 and 3 months to maturity for the two benchmark crudes are integrated of order one (I(1)). We tested for a bivariate cointegration relationship using the Gregory and Hansen (1996) test for spot prices and futures prices for the same grade of crude oil as well as spot prices and futures prices for different grades of crude oil; that is, spot WTI and futures prices for Brent at 1 and 3 months to maturity and spot Brent and futures prices for WTI at 1 and 3 months to maturity In the case of conflicting test results, we based our conclusions on the Z t statistic, which according to Gregory and Hansen (1996) , is the most powerful of all the three statistics considered. The results are presented in Tables 1-4. We find that spot and future prices of the same grade, as well as spot and futures prices of different grades, are cointegrated. For almost all of the series the same break dates were estimated by the Z t and Z a statistics for the same model. The break date suggested by the ADF statistic often occurred within at least 1 month of the date of the break estimated by the ADF and the Z t /Z a tests for the same model, although it sometimes varied by as much as a year. Another important feature of our results is that the Z a test statistic in some cases was extraordinarily large, particularly in those cases when both the ADF and the Z t test statistics were significant at the 5 per cent level. This can be attributed to the high degree of autocorrelation in the series. It should also be noted that the dates of the break do not need to be exact. That is the break date say in January could be a reflection of the events occurring several months prior to the break date. In addition not only actual events could trigger the break, but also anticipation of such events could trigger the break. The majority of the break points across the models fall in 2003. As hypothesised these break dates reflect events directly related to oil markets, in particular the second Gulf War, events in major oil-producing countries or events directly related to oil markets in the United States. In March 2003 the Second Gulf war begun and there was an outbreak of violence in the Nigerian region of the Niger Delta, which led three oil major companies to shut down
