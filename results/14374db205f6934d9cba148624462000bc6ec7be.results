Secondary bacterial infections following primary influenza compromise pulmonary integrity and augment lung edema. Among the clinical cases of influenza infection, the associated secondary bacterial pneumonia is a leading cause of death (1), with S. pneumoniae being the most common causative bacterium (2, 3) . The most prevalent serotype encountered in the Asian population is 19F, whereas serotype 3 is more virulent (16, 25) . To address the possible role of cANGPTL4 in secondary pneumococcal pneumonia, we developed a sequential dual-infection mouse model, mimicking the clinical scenario wherein patients with a primary influenza infection are susceptible to secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. Mice were intratracheally infected with the influenza virus on day 0 and subsequently infected intratracheally with either S. pneumoniae serotype 3 (S3) or 19F at 7 days post-influenza infection (dpi) (Fig. 1A) . Next, we examined the host expression profile and the pathological phenotype of the lung tissues in this sequential dual-infection mouse model. The bronchiolar epithelium and alveolar tissues were infiltrated with immune cells and damaged by the influenza virus infection at 7 dpi prior to bacterial challenge (Fig. 1A) . From 8 to 11 dpi, lungs were harvested daily from mice infected by the influenza virus (Flu), bacteria (S3 or 19F), or influenza with bacterial superinfection (FluϩS3 or Fluϩ19F). To assess the Antibody Therapy Improves Bacterial Pneumonia Survival ® extent of edema in the infected lungs, the volumes of the harvested lung lobes were measured. Lung lobes with more edema display larger volumes due to fluid infiltration from the circulation (Fig. 1B) . The lungs of the primary influenza-infected mice showed a small, but significant, 1.5-fold increase in lung volume, while primary bacterial 19Fand S3-infected lungs exhibited no significant change in lung volume compared with the sham-infected lungs (Fig. 1C) . Secondary bacterial infection resulted in significantly greater edema than primary influenza infection. They also showed clear pneumococcal serotype-specific patterns ( Fig. 1B and C) . Mice infected with influenza and serotype 3 of S. pneumoniae (FluϩS3) reached the criteria for euthanasia (i.e., at least 30% loss of their body weight) before 11 dpi (Fig. 1B) . The lungs of mice infected with FluϩS3 displayed a significant Ն2.0-fold increase in lung lobe volume compared with shaminfected lungs (Fig. 1C ). S. pneumoniae cells were detected in the pulmonary epithelium and alveolar spaces, as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The fluid-filled alveolar spaces may encourage bacterial growth, and S. pneumoniae cells were detected in abundance in those spaces (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). Histological analysis of the lungs revealed significantly greater lung tissue damage in secondary pneumococcal infections compared with primary influenza infection alone (Fig. S1B ). Regions of lung tissue from FluϩS3-superinfected mice lost the basic structure of the alveolar walls and were replaced with excessive fluid arising from severe lung edema. Compared to the FluϩS3 mice, the Fluϩ19F-superinfected mice displayed better preserved alveolar structures, although there was still significantly more fluid infiltration in the alveolar spaces compared to mice with influenza infection alone. More intra-alveolar erythrocytes and immune cells infiltrated the lung parenchyma in influenza-infected mice than in primary bacterial pneumonia-infected mice. The lungs of primary bacterial pneumonia-infected mice exhibited pulmonary tissue morphology similar to that of healthy control lungs, suggesting that primary bacterial infection did not cause noticeable tissue damage. The trends in lung tissue damage among the different experimental groups were indicated by the morphology of the alveolar structures and the percentage of the intact alveoli compared to healthy lung lobes. Sham-infected, S3-infected, and 19F-infected mice showed uncompromised alveolar space integrity, whereas secondary pneumococcal pneumonia-infected mice suffered more substantial lung tissue injury than influenza-infected mice. Secondary pneumococcal pneumonia-infected mice revealed distinct serotype specificity, with FluϩS3 mice suffering more severe edema and loss of alveolar structures than Fluϩ19F mice (Fig. S1C ). Taken together, secondary pneumococcal infection following primary influenza infection significantly increased the severity of lung edema and pulmonary tissue damage in a serotype-specific manner. cANGPTL4 expression is upregulated in the lung tissues of mice with secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. In correlation with the severity of lung damage, quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that ANGPTL4 mRNA levels peaked at 9 dpi in lungs infected with Flu (9-fold), 19F (4-fold), S3 (2-fold), Fluϩ19F (7.5-fold), and FluϩS3 (10-fold) compared to sham-infected lungs ( Fig. 2A) . Immunoblot analysis revealed elevated levels of cANGPTL4 protein from 8 to 10 dpi across all of the diseased lungs compared to the healthy lungs (Fig. 2B ). Immunofluorescence staining of the lung tissue revealed a widespread distribution of cANGPTL4 in mice with primary influenza and secondary bacterial pneumonia (FluϩS3 and Fluϩ19F) at all examined time points (Fig. 2C ). In contrast, primary bacterial pneumonia-infected lungs showed cANGPTL4 immunostaining patterns that were similar to those in healthy control lung sections, in which cANGPTL4 was restricted to the bronchiolar structures (Fig. 2C) . Thus, elevated cANGPTL4 expression levels correlate well with pulmonary damage in secondary bacterial pneumonia. Deficiency in host cANGPTL4 reduces pulmonary edema and protects lung tissue integrity in mice with secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. The abundance of the cANGPTL4 protein in secondary bacterial pneumonia-infected mouse lung tissue suggests an important role for cANGPTL4 in infection-induced pulmonary damage. To this end, we examined its impact on lung edema and tissue integrity during secondary bacterial pneumonia using ANGPTL4 knockout mice (ANGPTL4 Ϫ/Ϫ ) ( Fig. 3A and B) and immunoneutralization of cANGPTL4 ( Fig. 3C and D). ANGPTL4 Ϫ/Ϫ mice with secondary FluϩS3 and Fluϩ19F infections exhibited less pulmonary edema than their ANG-PTL4 ϩ/ϩ counterparts ( Fig. 3A and B). As indicated by the arrows in Fig. 3B , Fluϩ19Finfected ANGPTL4 ϩ/ϩ mouse lung tissue was characterized by extensive edema, bleeding, and immune cell infiltration in the alveolar spaces, whereas ANGPTL4 Ϫ/Ϫ mice with Fluϩ19F infection showed better-preserved integrity of the alveolar spaces. Among the FluϩS3-infected mice, ANGPTL4 ϩ/ϩ mouse lung tissue featured severe edema that destroyed the alveolar structures, leaving diminished alveolar walls, in contrast to ANGPTL4 Ϫ/Ϫ mice, which had preserved alveolar structures and less edema (Fig. 3B ). In ANGPTL4 ϩ/Ϫ mice, the improvement in lung tissue integrity was less obvious ( Antibody Therapy Improves Bacterial Pneumonia Survival ® and B). We observed an improvement in lung tissue integrity in ANGPTL4 Ϫ/Ϫ mice compared with their wild-type counterparts for both FluϩS3 and Fluϩ19F superinfections, as indicated by the higher percentage of intact alveolar spaces (see Fig. S2A in the supplemental material). To confirm the results observed in ANGPTL4 knockout mice and to explore the therapeutic potential of anti-cANGPTL4 treatment, we next studied the effects of an cANGPTL4 deficiency caused by the injection of an anti-cANGPTL4 monoclonal antibody (MAb) into secondary pneumococcal pneumonia-infected mice. Infected ANG-PTL4 ϩ/ϩ mice treated with anti-cANGPTL4 MAb were protected against infectionassociated lung damage, with better lung tissue integrity and reduced edema compared to infected but untreated ANGPTL4 ϩ/ϩ mice, thus confirming the findings of the ANGPTL4 knockout experiments (Fig. 3C) . As indicated by the higher percentage of intact alveolar spaces, we observed an improvement in lung tissue integrity in anti-cANGPTL4 MAb-treated mice compared with control IgG-treated mice for both FluϩS3 and Fluϩ19F superinfections (Fig. S2A) . Electron micrographs further confirmed that Representative image of lung harvested at 11 dpi from ANGPTL4 knockout (Ϫ/Ϫ), heterozygous (ϩ/Ϫ), and wild-type (ϩ/ϩ) mice infected with influenza virus and different pneumococcal serotypes (S3 and 19F). Scale bar ϭ 5 mm. n ϭ 3 independent experiments with 5 mice per time point for each experimental group. (B) Representative H&E images of the indicated primary and secondary pneumococcal infections of lungs from ANGPTL4 knockout (Ϫ/Ϫ), heterozygous (ϩ/Ϫ), and wild-type (ϩ/ϩ) mice. In Fluϩ19F-infected mice, the ANGPTL4 knockout group showed significant reduction of immune cell infiltration and edema compared with their wild-type counterparts (black versus white arrows); In FluϩS3-infected mice, the wild-type group showed vanished alveolar structures with severe edema, while the ANGPTL4 knockout group preserved the alveolar structures with reduced edema (black versus white arrows). Scale bar ϭ 50 m. (C) Infected wild-type mice treated with the anti-cANGPTL4 antibody compared with untreated mice.

In the FluϩS3-infected mice, anti-cANGPTL4 treatment better preserved the structure of the alveolus (white arrow), compared to the diminished alveolar structures due to severe edema in the lungs of the FluϩS3 group of mice (black arrow). Scale bar ϭ 50 m. (D) Representative transmission electron microscopy images of lungs from mice with a secondary infection of serotype 3 that were administered the anti-cANGPTL4 antibody (i and ii) or control IgG (iii and iv). White arrows and arrowheads indicate cell-cell junctions and collagen fibrils, respectively. Viral budding (v) is visible at the damaged cell boundary, and bacteria are visible in control vehicle-treated mice with a secondary infection of serotype 3 (vi). Red arrowheads indicate viral budding and bacteria. Scale bar ϭ 500 nm. anti-cANGPTL4 MAb treatment improved the integrity of intercellular tight junctions between lung epithelial cells compared to the IgG control treatment (Fig. 3D , panels i to iii). In contrast, the lungs of control IgG-treated mice showed increased fibrosis and bacterial spread (Fig. 3D , panels iv to vi). RNA sequencing analysis revealed that anti-cANGPTL4 MAb treatment improved immune function against secondary bacterial infection (FluϩS3), as well as coagulation to reduce bleeding and edema in the lungs (Fig. S2B) . Hence, an cANGPTL4 deficiency reduces pulmonary edema and protects lung tissue integrity, suggesting that the use of anti-cANGPTL4 therapy during secondary bacterial pneumonia may be beneficial. Antibody Therapy Improves Bacterial Pneumonia Survival ® efficacy in ameliorating lung edema, diminishing tissue damage, and prolonging survival time (Fig. 4B; Fig. S3B and C). As indicated in Fig. 4B and quantified in Fig. S3C , FluϩS3 superinfection destroyed the alveolar structures and caused severe edema in the lungs of infected wild-type mice. Antibiotic treatment alone protected the alveolar structures but could not clear the edema and infiltration of immune cells. Although the anti-cANGPTL4 or antipneumolysin antibody treatments alone improved lung tissue integrity and reduced edema, these improvements were not as significant as those observed when using a combined treatment with antibiotics and anti-cANGPTL4 MAb or with anti-cANGPTL4 and antipneumolysin antibodies ( Fig. 4B; Fig. S3C ). The efficacy of a combined approach was further confirmed by marked improvements in the mouse survival rate and lung tissue integrity in treatment groups of wild-type mice receiving antibiotics, anti-cANGPTL4, and antipneumolysin MAb. Similar trends were observed in ANGPTL4 Ϫ/Ϫ mice receiving antibiotic and antipneumolysin treatment (Fig. S3) . Next, we performed transcriptomic analysis of the lung tissues to elucidate the detailed host response factors to secondary pneumococcal pneumonia during the various treatment modalities (Fig. 4C) . Compared with antibiotic treatment alone, our analysis indicated that the anti-cANGPTL4 MAb treatment combined with an antibiotic notably improved the immune responses against bacterial infection as well as coagulation function, thus attenuating intra-alveolar hemorrhage and edema in the lungs of secondary bacterial pneumonia-infected mice. For example, this combination treatment yielded a 3-fold increase in activation of the coagulation system pathway compared to MAb treatment alone (Fig. 4C) . Immunoneutralization of pneumococcal pneumolysin abrogates its poreforming action on alveolar epithelium. Antibiotic resistance among clinical strains of S. pneumoniae underscores the urgency for alternative treatment strategies. Multimodal host-and pathogen-directed immunotherapy is a feasible option. Thus, we employed the experimental dual-infection mouse model to explore concurrent immunotherapy for secondary bacterial pneumonia. The host response protein cANGPTL4 and bacterial virulence factor pneumolysin were targeted using cognate neutralizing antibodies. The antipneumolysin antibody mitigated the pore-forming action of pneumolysin in human alveolar epithelial cells and reduced tissue damage. This effect persisted for 48 h (Fig. 4D) . The concurrent antibiotic and antibody treatment significantly improved lung tissue integrity and, importantly, extended the median survival time of mice with secondary bacterial pneumonia compared to treatment with either the antibiotic or a single antibody ( Fig. 4A and B) . Taken together, these observations highlight that host-directed therapeutic anti-cANGPTL4 MAb can complement pathogen-directed treatment, such as conventional antibiotics or a novel antipneumolysin antibody, to enhance lung tissue integrity and augment host survival during secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. The improved tissue integrity and considerably longer median survival time suggest that a multimodal treatment approach targeting both host and pathogen factors can be highly efficacious against DRSP infection. Immunotherapy against cANGPTL4 enhances host immune responses against secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. To gain further insights into the host responses to secondary pneumococcal infection and the various treatments, we analyzed the immune cells and gene expression of the infected mouse lungs. qPCR on fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)-sorted major immune cell groups revealed that macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T cells, and B cells expressed ANGPTL4 at various levels during secondary pneumococcal pneumonia (Fig. 5A) . In FluϩS3-infected mouse lungs, semidigested bacteria appeared within the lymphocyte cytoplasm, while the antibody-mediated neutralization of cANGPTL4 augmented the ability of macrophages to phagocytose and fully digest the bacteria (Fig. 5B) . The improved phagocytosis and bacterial digestion suggest that anti-cANGPTL4 treatment enhances host immune function. Next, we further interrogated the transcriptome of lung tissues to understand the detailed host response factors to secondary pneumococcal infection and the various treatments. Our analysis showed that the anti-cANGPTL4 antibody treatment, either alone or in combination with antibiotic treatment, increased the expression of host immune defense-related genes (such as those coding for interleukin-1␤ [IL-1␤], Toll-like receptor 4 [TLR4], NF-B, tumor necrosis factor [TNF], and gamma interferon [IFN-␥]), while decreasing the expression of anti-inflammatory genes (such as IL10RA) (Fig. 5C) . Interestingly, the combined treatment using anti-cANGPTL4 and an antibiotic generated a greater enhancement of gene expression than the anti-cANGPTL4 treatment alone, whereas antibiotic treatment alone produced the opposite effect in terms of the regulation of these genes (Fig. 5C) . Given that an insufficient host immune response is a major contributory factor to the lethal outcome of secondary bacterial pneumonia, the apparently positive effects of anti-cANGPTL4 therapy on the immune response could be considered beneficial to the host's defense against bacterial infection (1) and are consistent with the improved phagocytosis and bacterial digestion (Fig. 5B) . Elevated cANGPTL4 protein levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with pneumonia. All clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae secrete toxic poreforming pneumolysin. This supports a potential broad application of an antipneumolysin antibody in new treatments against DRSP infection (12) . Similarly, to underscore the potential use of anti-cANGPTL4 therapy in pulmonary diseases, we examined the protein level of cANGPTL4 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; n ϭ 7). Compared with healthy volunteers (control; n ϭ 16), the ARDS BALF samples showed significantly higher cANGPTL4 protein levels (ϳ15-fold), as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 6A) . However, this marked increase in cANGPTL4 was not observed in serum samples from pneumonia patients (n ϭ 17) compared with non-pneumonia patients (control; n ϭ 8) (Fig. 6B ). This finding Antibody Therapy Improves Bacterial Pneumonia Survival ® indicates that the cANGPTL4 protein was elevated in the pulmonary fluid of patients with severe pneumonia, whereas its levels in the blood circulation may be influenced by other factors. It also supports the potential utility of cANGPTL4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for the diagnosis and treatment of infection-associated lung injury.
