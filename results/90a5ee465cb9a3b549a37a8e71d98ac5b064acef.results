Broadly speaking, simulations of the above model resulted in one of the following outcomes: response here means that individuals do become infected by any amount of the virus: (a) a small local response which dies away; (b) a response which involves a large fraction, and possibly all, of the population where individuals become sick (v > v s ) once only, with viral levels returning thereafter to almost zero; (c) as in (b) except that viral levels remain elevated in certain individuals at lower than symptomatic (v < v s ) or infectious (v < v crit ) levels; (d) a repetitive outbreak of disease in which a large fraction, and possibly all, of the population becomes ill on an approximately periodic basis. An example of a case (d)-type response where there are almost-periodic outbreaks is shown in Fig. 4 , where the mean viral load (in scaled units) across the population is plotted against time and is seen to have approximately periodic peaks. For these results we have used the standard parameters with n = 100 and p trans = 0.2. The spatial distribution of hosts and the distributions of the critical points are those shown in Figs. 1-3 . Recall that only one member of the population is initially infected and that the individual responses are not oscillatory when the viral dynamical parameters take their standard mean values. However, due to the distribution of parameters several individuals may have recurrent outbreaks of diminishing magnitude. However, it was found that recurrent outbreaks in individuals were by themselves not intrinsically sufficient to cause another major outbreak because when the meetings between individuals were stopped at 50 days, there was just the initial outbreak even though all parameters and the spatial distribution were unchanged. In Fig. 5 is shown the temporal evolution of the viral loads in two of the individual hosts for the first outbreak in Fig.  4 . The blue curve, starting at v > 0 at t = 0, depicts the viral load for the initially infected individual, the (other) red curve being for an individual who became infected about 4-5 days later. With a smaller value of p trans = 0.1 and all other parameters the same, with no cut-off of meetings after 50 days, there was only one outbreak. In order to consider the influence of various parameters, we may classify them into three main types: (i) those which determine contact rates between hosts, being n, a, b, Λ and α; (ii) those which govern the processes of viral transmission, which are p trans , β and v crit ; and (iii) those which determine the within-host viralimmune system dynamics, being the means and variances of the parameters λ i , μ i , r i , γ i and i , i = 1, . . . , n. We do not have space to report the dependence of the course of disease on all these in detail, so we discuss variations in a few representative ones. Our simulations were done with software which does not permit the efficient study of very large populations. However we expect that similar principles will hold in the investigations reported here as in larger populations. In later articles we will carry out further investigations of the parameter dependence and incorporate larger population sizes. In all the following results there is assumed to be just one individual at t = 0 who carries a small viral load where both the individual and the viral load are assigned randomly (see Section 3).
