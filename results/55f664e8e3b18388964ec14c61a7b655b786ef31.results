Of the 349 children included in the study, 178 were RSV positive. The majority of children (56% or 100 children) with diagnoses of RSV were afebrile. Febrile children who were RSV positive were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia as those who were afebrile (47/78 or 60% vs 27/100 or 27%, P < .001). In the 171 children who had RSV-negative bronchiolitis (diagnosis of viral infection other than RSV), 88/171 (or 51%) were afebrile. Febrile children with RSV-negative bronchiolitis were 8 times more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia as afebrile children (54/83 or 65% vs 7/88 or 8%, P < .001). Additional bivariate and trivariate analyses of both RSV-positive and RSV-negative bronchiolitis did not show any significant difference between the occurrence of pneumonia in children with fevers in the 100.4°F to 100.9°F range versus fevers in the >102°F range.
