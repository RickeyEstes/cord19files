Sixty four children with PPE/PE (36 boys and 28 girls) median age 4 years (range 1e15 years) were enrolled. The majority of children were treated with antibiotics prior to the collection of blood and pleural fluid samples culture (55 and 64 children, respectively). Blood and pleural fluid cultures, as well as molecular studies identifying DNA of S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. aureus and H. influenzae were performed in all 64 patients. Molecular tests detecting specific nucleic acid sequences of respiratory viruses and atypical pathogens were done in 58 (90.6%) patients. The results of microbiological studies (cultures and molecular diagnostics) are summarized in Table 1 . S. pneumoniae was the most common bacteria detected by both standard culture as well as PCR. This pathogen was identified in 13 blood and pleural fluid samples collected from 11/64 (17.2%) children (in two children S. pneumoniae was cultured from both specimens). Thus, S. pneumoniae was responsible for 42.8% and 91% of all positive blood and pleural fluid cultures, respectively. No significant difference was found between the number of S. pneumoniae positive blood and pleural fluid cultures (p ¼ 0.076) and there was only fair agreement between S. pneumoniae positive blood and pleural fluid samples (Cohen's kappa coefficient ¼ 0.255; 95% CI À0.066e0.576). On the other hand, molecular tests revealed 2.6 fold more patients with pneumococcal pleural infection as compared to those identified by standard pleural fluid cultures (26 vs. 10). This difference was statistically significant (p ¼ 0.003). A similar proportion was found for S. pyogenes (1 vs. 3). There was a moderate agreement between pleural fluid cultures and pleural fluid PCR tests in terms of S. pneumoniae detection (Cohen's kappa coefficient ¼ 0.426; 95% CI 0.227e0.625). Based on the results of culture and PCR tests, S. pneumoniae was found responsible for 40.6% of all pleural infections. In all S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes positive blood and pleural fluid samples specific DNA sequences of these pathogens has also been found by PCR method. Pneumococcal serotypes were studied in all 26 children with pneumococcal infection. Serogroup 6 was the most common and was found in 11/26 (40.3%) patients. Partial sequencing of the wciP gene from these samples revealed the presence of nucleotide variant characteristic for 6B serotypes in nine cases and the variant associated with 6A serotypes for two remaining patients. Other identified serotypes were as follows: 19A in 6/26 (23%) pts, serotype 3 in 3/26 (11.5%) pts, serotype 23F in 2/26 (7.7%) pts, serotype 1 in 1/26 (3.8%) pts and serotype 14 in 1/26 (3.8%) pts. In 2/26 (7.7%) samples serotype could not have been determined (ND). Forty eight children (75%) in the whole study group were not vaccinated against S. pneumoniae, 12 (18.7%) were fully vaccinated and 2 (3.1%) were partially vaccinated. In two children, the vaccination status was unknown. The vaccination status in the subgroup with pneumococcal pleural infection was as follows: 17 pts not vaccinated, 9 pts vaccinated. Details on vaccination status and pneumococcal serotypes found in children with pneumococcal pleural infection are presented in Table 2 . C. pneumoniae was the most common atypical bacteria detected in 5/58 (8.6%) pts. Among viruses, adenovirus was the leading pathogen 8/64 (13.8%) whereas RSV, hMPV, rhino and bocaviruses were found only in single cases. In 8 children, more than one pathogen was detected. Coexistence of S. pneumoniae and adenovirus was found in 3 cases, S. pneumoniae and rhinovirus in 1 case, S. pneumoniae and hMPV in 1 case, both M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were detected in 2 children. S. pneumoniae, adenovirus and RSV was found in one child.
