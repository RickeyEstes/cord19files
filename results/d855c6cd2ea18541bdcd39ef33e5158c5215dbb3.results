For this study, a total of 1408 sporadic/clusters patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection and complete data were used in the analysis. The characteristics and the number of MERS cases per year can be found in . Most of the MERS cases were male and male-specific % CFR was approximately 33% (332/1008). The male vs. female ratio in the fatal and nonfatal cases was 2.9 (332/119) vs. 2.4 (676/281), respectively (see Table 2 ). Table 3 illustrates unadjusted and adjusted OR for mortality in the laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases in the survey period. The adjusted analysis showed that the age groups N30 years (2.38; 95% CI: 1.75-3.22), Saudi nationality (1.43; 95% CI: 1.06-1.92), and comorbidity (1.76; 95% CI: 1.39-2.22) were independently associated with higher chances of mortality. Additionally, in comparison to MERS patients who had â‰¤14 days from onset of clinical signs to hospital admission, adjusted OR estimates of the mortality was 0.42; 95% CI: 0.31-0.57 for those who had N14 days from the onset of clinical signs to hospital admission. The adjusted OR estimates of mortality was 0.58; 95% CI: 0.44-0.75 for MERS patients who were exposed to a camel in the last 14 days compared to those who were not exposed. Other probable risk factors such as gender, exposure to a morbid case of MERS in the last 14 days, healthcare worker, and admission in negative pressure isolate room or ICU had no significant association with higher mortality (P N 0.05 for all). 2014). MERS-CoV started in Saudi Arabia by sporadic infections in mid-2012 and later its outbreak progressed to other countries (Alamoudi et al. 2018 ). Due to the occurrence of a large number of MERS-CoV cases and its high worldwide mortality rate, this infection must be considered a public health threat (Lessler et al. 2016) . The current study focuses on the epidemiological trend of MERS-CoV infection and mortality rate analysis of its worldwide cases in the aforementioned dates. The findings of this study may have important implications for the infection control practice and also help to ensure global health security. Based on the analysis, the overall global %CFR of MERS was 32.0% [451/1408], which is substantially lower than the %CFR in the MERS-CoV endemic region (Table 2) . For example, Hunter et al. found an overall CFR of 67% in the Abu Dhabi (Hunter et al. 2016 ) and Petersen et al. found an overall CFR of 40% in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Petersen et al. 2014 ) However, our estimates were higher than the largest MERS outbreak in South Korea (CFR of 21%) (Cowling et al. 2015) . Our analyses of the WHO data was approximately similar to the CFR of 34% reported by Memish et al. (Memish et al. 2014) , and also CFR of 30.5% declared by Mobaraki et al. (Mobaraki and Ahmadzadeh 2019a). The regional variation of CFR from previously conducted studies may be skewed due to severity of disease and smaller sample sizes than have been investigated previously. On the whole, the CFR of 32% related to the MERS-CoV infection in the present study should be considered as a major health concern at the global scale. Thus, the characteristics of this disease and the potential risk factors associated with patient fatality should be studied comprehensively. Our findings confirm that the mortality pattern of the MERS in Saudi Arabia is different from the observed countries in the Middle East and affected countries beyond. By far, the greatest burden of this disease in terms of mortality and morbidity rates is located in four countries including Saudi Arabia, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan. In this regards, differences in the virus and the genetic background of the population affected can play a role. Other reasons can include a difference in the availability or ability to implement patient isolation procedures as well as differences in overall medical technology among involved countries.
