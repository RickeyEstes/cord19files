In this section we have estimated the basic reproduction number ܴ and the controlled reproduction number ܴ . Since January 19, 2020, various containment measures have been strictly implemented, especially after the State Council agreed to include NCP into the Management of the Infectious Diseases Law and the Health and Quarantine Law on January 20. Based on an average10.91-day infectious period estimate from our collected data, we expect a flatter rate of increment starting on January 29. Figure 3 plots the number of daily new cases in a log-scale against date, and, as anticipated, the trend supports our guess. Therefore, the quantities ܴ and ܴ are estimated based on collected data in two separate periods, i.e., from January 21 (the starting date of daily updates of confirmed cases .

Table 3 and Table 4 . Despite the disagreement between different estimation methods, all three methods indicate notable reductions from ܴ to ܴ which suggests an improvement in the current situation. This is possibly due to the effective interventions and prompt actions by the local and central governments to minimize further spreading. We also notice that EGR yields smaller estimates of ܴ compared to other methods. This might be because the number of infected patients does not grow exponentially after such strict containment measures.
