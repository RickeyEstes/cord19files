Before describing the in-depth analysis of the ribosomal particles by our three-tiered MS approach, we first describe some novel workflows, hardware and software we used for top-down LC-MS/MS making use of a recently introduced mass analyzer, the Orbi-trap™HF-X 27 . Improved top-down LC-MS/MS through on-the-fly deconvolution. Standard top-down LC-MS/MS experiments encounter a number of challenges that limit the analytical depth of the analyses. When full MS spectra are acquired to determine which proteoforms are selected for subsequent top-down sequencing events, there is an information redundancy that comes from the repeated selection and fragmentation of the different charge states of the same proteoform. Additionally, current workflows regularly employ full MS scans at Three-tiered mass spectrometry based approach for the dissection and characterization of ribosomal particles. The three-tiered hybrid mass spectrometry approach described here can provide insight into multiple molecular levels, ranging from the amino acid sequence of individual ribosomal proteins to the stoichiometric composition of the intact ribonucleoprotein particles. Which tier in the approach provides information on which level is indicated in green. The structural model of the E. coli 70S ribosome (PDB 4YBB) displays the rRNA in gray, the proteins of the 30S subunit in red and of the 50S subunit in blue 70 high resolving power (R = 120,000 at m/z = 200) to determine the proteoform charge state from the isotopic distributions, followed by top-down sequencing also performed at high resolving power (socalled "High-High" workflows). However, on Orbitrap™ mass spectrometers, the short-lived transients of large proteins (>30 kDa) are generally suppressed when competing with the longer lived transients of smaller proteins, introducing a negative bias in the identification of larger proteins. Additionally, to isotopically resolve the high molecular weight proteins (>60 kDa), longer transient times are required (>500 ms) that are generally less compatible with the LC timescales of top-down LC-MS/MS analysis. By acquiring the full MS spectra at medium resolution (R = 7500 at m/z = 200), but the MS/MS data at high resolving power (termed "Medium-High" workflows), the bias is removed and both large and small proteins can be identified by top-down sequencing. At this resolution, the isotopic distributions of the proteoforms remain unresolved. This information is used to calculate their charge states, an essential part of the experiment since this information is required for the determination of fragmentation parameters (e.g., collision voltage), database searching (calculation of the measured mass) and the sequencing of co-eluting proteins (exclusion of different charge states of the same proteoform). We solved these redundancy and bias issues by actively (on-the-fly) deconvoluting the mediumresolution full MS spectra, assigning charge and mass to every peak in the spectrum (Methods section). We benchmarked the combination of these Medium-High and High-High workflows by identifying all 55 ribosomal proteins from the Ec70S ribosome and an additional 12 ribosomeassociated proteins ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The advantage of the Medium-High workflow over the High-High workflow for high molecular weight proteins is immediately evident when mediumand high-resolution full MS scans of the ribosomal protein S1 (61 kDa) and the peptide chain release factor 2 (prfB, 41 kDa), a ribosome-interacting protein, are compared ( Supplementary  Fig. 2 ). While the medium-resolution scans contain clearly resolved charge states, the high-resolution scans suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio hampering identification. Moreover, the Medium-High method allows for shorter duty cycles (Supplementary Fig. 3a ) and faster processing time of the deconvolution algorithm ( Supplementary Fig. 3b ). On the other hand, the highresolution full MS of High-High workflows provides a higher number of reliably deconvoluted proteoforms for lower molecular weight proteins ( Supplementary Fig. 3c ) making the two approaches somewhat complementary ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Therefore, we used a combination of optimized Medium-High and High-High workflows to perform in-depth top-down LC-MS/ MS analysis of the So70S, Hs40S and Hs60S ribosomal particles. Overview of bottom-up and top-down LC-MS/MS on ribosomes. In Fig. 2 , we provide an overview of the results of the bottom-up (2a-c) and top-down (2d-f) LC-MS/MS experiments on So70S, Hs40S, and Hs60S ribosome samples. On the left, the bottom-up LC-MS/MS data are presented by intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) plots, which rank the detected proteins by their estimated abundance 28 . Although these plots are not directly suitable for the determination of protein stoichiometry in the complexes, they provide an accurate prediction of the protein abundances in the investigated samples. On the right, the base peak intensity chromatograms of the top-down LC-MS/ MS runs are shown, where peaks represent proteins or mixtures of chemically similar proteins eluting from the column and introduced into the mass spectrometer, in which Medium-High or High-High workflows are used to measure their intact mass and perform top-down sequencing. In this way, we could identify all expected 57 ribosomal proteins of the So70S ribosome, 47 ribosomal proteins of the Hs60S and 33 ribosomal proteins of the Hs40S ribosomal subunit. Moreover, we detected several nonribosomal proteins that co-purified with the ribosomal particles, e.g., translation factor pY (pY) and ribosome recycling factor (RRF) in the So70S sample. Such a high identification rate lays the foundation for an in-depth investigation of the co-occurring proteoforms in these ribosomal assemblies. Information on the purity of the sample can be extracted from both bottom-up and top-down LC-MS/MS measurements. According to bottom-up LC-MS/MS data, the 50 most abundant proteins in the So70S sample are either ribosomal proteins of the 30S and 50S subunit, which comprise the 70S ribosome, or translation factors (pY and RRF). The main impurities seem to be non-ribosomal, generally high abundant chloroplastic proteins ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 1). Additionally, a small set of low abundant proteins of the cytosolic 80S ribosome are detected. The majority of the proteins in the Hs40S sample belong to the 40S ribosomal subunit, followed by a number of mitoribosomal proteins of the 39S large subunit (Fig. 2b ). The Hs60S sample seems to be most pure since there is a much larger gap between the abundance of the 60S ribosomal proteins and other copurified proteins (Fig. 2c) . Additionally, the main impurities here include ribosomal proteins of the 40S subunit and not mitoribosomal proteins. The top-down LC-MS/MS runs show highly comparable results when inspecting the identified proteins. In the human 40S sample, around half of the ribosomal proteins identified were mitochondrial. For the 60S sample, only 12% was mitochondrial while 32% was identified as 40S ribosomal protein. In this way, other, non-ribosomal protein complexes can also be identified. For instance, top-down LC-MS/MS showed that the purified human 40S ribosome sample contained multiple protein subunits from the spliceosome (snRNPs E, F, G, SM D1, and SM D2). Characterization of these proteins is not limited to identification; the snRNP SM D1 was found to be dimethylated nine times in its glycine-and arginine-rich C-terminus and the fragmentation maps of the snRNP E protein suggest that its initiator methionine is removed and the protein is both acetylated and dimethylated ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). The combination of top-down and bottom-up LC-MS/MS allows for better coverage of the proteome of these complexes. Bottom-up LC-MS/MS provides great depth to characterize lower abundant proteins and has no upper limit in protein Fig. 6 ). An overview of proteoforms detected and characterized with topdown LC-MS/MS of ribosomal proteins in the Hs40S and Hs60S subunits is displayed in Fig. 2g . For only half of the proteins, the intact measured mass agreed with the mass determined directly from the gene sequence. We could identify several PTMs and sequence variations, which are poorly described in most protein databases. These include the removal of initiator methionines (L11, L19, L23, L35a, L30, L36a, S5, and S25) as well as N-terminal acetylation S8 S9 S10 S11 S12 S13 S14 S15 S15A S16 S17 S18 S19 S20 Observed mass − backbone mass (Da) (L23, L35a). Absence of this information from the protein database can in turn lead to incorrect interpretation by standard database searching software, as is exemplified by the S25 protein (incorrect assignment of an N-terminally acetylated proline prevented the identification of a previously unreported dimethylated state of this S25 protein ( Supplementary Fig. 7) . Furthermore, available protein databases such as UniProt and neXtProt mostly lack detailed information on disulfide bridges in human ribosomal proteins. In our LC-MS/MS approach we could chromatographically separate oxidized and reduced forms of human ribosomal proteins L5, S21, S27 and S27a as well as detect their subtle mass differences ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ).
