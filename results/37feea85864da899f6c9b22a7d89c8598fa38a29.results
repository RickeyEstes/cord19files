Endogenous IFITM3 Is Down-Regulated by Rapamycin via a Lysosomal Degradation Pathway. As inhibitors of virus-cell fusion in endosomes, we assessed the role played by IFITM proteins in the rapamycin-mediated enhancement of lentivector infection. We previously reported that HeLa cells and primary fibroblasts express high levels of IFITM3, which renders them refractory to infection by Zika virus (12) . When HeLa were exposed to micromolar quantities of rapamycin for 4 h, we observed a dosedependent decrease in IFITM3 protein as determined by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis ( Fig. 1 A-C). The effect was selective because another transmembrane protein, transferrin receptor, was unaffected by rapamycin treatment (Fig. 1C) . A time course experiment revealed that IFITM3 down-regulation was both progressive, with maximal decreases observed at 4 to 6 h posttreatment, and transient, as IFITM3 protein levels partially recovered over time ( Fig. 1 D and E) . We also examined how mTOR inhibition affects endogenous IFITM3 induced by type I IFN in 293T cells. Following 24 h of IFN stimulation, rapamycin addition led to decreased levels of induced IFITM3 protein in a dose-dependent manner. Here, elevated amounts of rapamycin resulted in a stable, nontransient loss of induced IFITM3 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A ). We used quantitative RT-PCR to show that IFITM3 mRNA levels were unaffected by rapamycin (Fig. 1F) , indicating that the down-regulation of IFITM3 manifests at the protein level. A second mTOR inhibitor, Torin 1, which was also shown to enhance lentivector transduction in CD34 + HSPCs (38), downregulated endogenous IFITM3 in the micromolar range as well (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B ). In agreement with a model of posttranslational regulation, we found that the vacuolar ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 partially prevented rapamycin-mediated down-regulation ( Fig. 1 G and H) , indicating that endolysosomal acidification contributes to IFITM3 protein degradation during mTOR inhibition. Meanwhile, an endosomal trafficking inhibitor that functions independently of acidification also partially rescued IFITM3 protein levels while the proteasome inhibitor MG132 had no effect ( Fig. 1 G and H) . To explore the mechanism of IFITM3 down-regulation in molecular detail, we studied the fate of exogenous IFITM3 stably transfected into 293T cells. While rapamycin treatment resulted in decreases to WT IFITM3 protein, a mutant variant in which the proline-based PPxY site recognized by NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin ligase is disrupted (Δ17-18) (45) was partially resistant to down-regulation (SI Appendix, Fig.  S1C ). Similarly, a previously described ubiquitin-deficient variant of IFITM3 in which all lysines were changed to arginines (ΔLys) (46, 47) displayed a loss in sensitivity to rapamycin-mediated degradation. Furthermore, a mutant lacking both the NEDD4 recognition site and a critical tyrosine needed for AP2-mediated endocytosis (Δ17-20) (47) (48) (49) was completely resistant to the effects of rapamycin ( Fig. 1I and SI Appendix, Fig. S1C ). In the same experimental system, exogenous IFITM2 protein was as sensitive to rapamycin as IFITM3 while IFITM1 was resistant (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C ). The differential effect of rapamycin on closely related IFITM proteins can be explained by the fact that the NEDD4 recognition and endocytosis motifs, present in the amino termini of IFITM3 and IFITM2, are absent in IFITM1. Together, these data suggest that mTOR inhibitors redirect IFITM3 protein toward a proteolytic pathway that requires endocytosis, ubiquitination, and endolysosomal acidification. To confirm that mTOR inhibitor treatment decreases IFITM3 protein half-life, we treated HeLa cells with rapamycin in the presence of cycloheximide (Chx) for up to 4 h. Rapamycin accelerated IFITM3 protein turnover under these conditions while bafilomycin A1 inhibited the loss (Fig. 1J ).
