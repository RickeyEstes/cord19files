The average age of control subjects and cases was 4.7 and 4.9 years, respectively. By rating the severity of the disease according to Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines (2005), 60% of the children had intermittent, 25% had mild persistent, and 10% had moderate persistent asthma. Steroid or steroid/ nonsteroid drug combined treatment was used by 79% of children with asthma. Analysis of the lung function of cases and control subjects showed that 72.7% of control subjects and only 45.8% of the children with asthma had an FEV 1 of greater than 100% (see Table E1 ). We also investigated which T-cell type is selected after ex vivo infection of lung cells from naive and asthmatic mice with rhinovirus (Fig E2, A) . Consistent with human data, we observed that in naive lung cells rhinovirus induces an effective antiviral immune response by upregulating T C 1 cells (CD8 1 IFN-g 1 ; Fig E2, B) . It is known that rhinovirus is able to directly activate T cells. E7 To determine whether exogenous active TGF-b would influence the T-cell immune response to rhinovirus, we exposed lung cells from naive and asthmatic wild-type mice with rhinovirus in vitro and then cultured them with TGF-b (see Fig E3, A) . In naive total lung cells TGF-b inhibited Ido expression in rhinovirus-treated cells (Fig E3, B) . Here we found that, consistent with an immunosuppressive role of TGF-b on T H 1 cells, E8 CD4 1 Tbet 1 cells were inhibited (Fig E3, B) .
