Ninety individuals were recruited for this study and randomly assigned to either the placebo or the echinacea group. Fifteen individuals in the echinacea group and 13 in the placebo group chose to leave the study, a 31% dropout rate (Fig 1) . Six individuals leaving the study (3 from each group) re- ported adverse effects that contributed to their study discontinuation. Each group also had 2 nonadherent individuals. There were no significant differences in individual characteristics, reason for dropout, or adherence between the 2 groups after randomization (data not shown). Fifty-eight individuals were included in the final analyses, 28 in the echinacea group and 30 in the placebo group. Table 1 has the individual characteristics for these groups and for individuals randomized but not analyzed. There were no significant differences between the echinacea and placebo groups in their demographic characteristics. There were significant differences between individuals who dropped out or were nonadherent and those who completed the study. Persons not included in the final analysis used fewer vitamins and herbs (P Ͻ .01) and reported fewer allergies (P ϭ .03). Table 2 summarizes the symptom information for the 2 groups during the 8-week period. Each of the 8 symptoms was compared separately for the 2 groups. No significant differences were found. The median total number of sick days was 9.0 for the echinacea group and 14.0 for the placebo group (z ϭ Ϫ0.42; P ϭ .67). Mild adverse effects were noted by 8% of the echinacea group and 7% of the placebo group (P ϭ .24) (data not shown). We compared the 2 groups each week for those reporting symptoms of any kind. Approximately 40% of the participants reported having symptoms most weeks, with no differences between the 2 groups (Fig 2) . Of individuals in either group who reported symptoms, less than half treated those symptoms, and even fewer missed work because of them. The placebo group consistently reported symptoms during any given week more than the echinacea group and treated themselves more often. However, none of these differences were statistically significant.
