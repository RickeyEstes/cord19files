QSS 2009 contacted or attempted to contact 3,112 households; 1,536 subjects declined participation, 142 households could not be contacted, and 129 were otherwise ineligible. Thus, the final sample for QSS 2009 included 1,292 respondents; 860 from South East Queensland and 432 from Other Queensland for an overall response rate of 41.5%. The sample was nearly equally divided between males and females (50.2% vs. 49.8%). Younger people (aged 18 -34 years) were under-represented in the sample and older people (aged > 55 years) were over-represented in the sample, otherwise the demographics of the participants reasonably approximated that of the general population [8] as shown in Table 1 . Responses to the four questions concerning anticipated compliance with a physician's advice to stay home are shown in Table 2 Bivariate associations between demographic variables and anticipated compliance with a physician's advice to stay home for the four viral diseases are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1 . As anticipated compliance in the setting of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and avian influenza was near universal, there were no significant associations between demographic variables and anticipated compliance. For the common cold and seasonal influenza, however, there were a number of significant associations. Respondents who were male, younger, employed (versus unemployed), and had a higher level of education were less likely to report anticipated compliance with stay home advice for both a common cold and seasonal influenza. Married/partnered people and those who lived in South East Queensland were also less likely to comply with advice to stay home for a common cold. People who lived in urban areas, and people employed in the health and community services sector were more likely than others to comply with advice to stay home for seasonal influenza, although 27.1% of health and community service workers would be unlikely to comply with such advice. In multivariate analysis, only sex and age remained significantly associated with anticipated compliance, and there was no interaction effect between these two variables. (Additional file 2: Table S2 ) Females were more likely than males to report anticipated compliance for both the common cold (AOR = 1.650; CI: 1.143-2.381) and seasonal influenza (AOR = 1.911; CI: 1.300-2.811).
