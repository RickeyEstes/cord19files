The mean H ðFÞ for study one and two with a ¼ 0:4 and infectious period equal to two time units are displayed in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 , respectively. The posterior mean values of each parameter are the averages over 10 replicates for each fitted model. They are listed within the Supplementary material along with all remaining MPSE and H ðFÞ data tables for study one and two with a ¼ 0:1 and infectious period equal to six time units.
