The numbers of samples taken during the study period were distributed over the age groups as follows: 154 (71%) were from two-year-old horses, 35 (16%) were from the three-year-old horses and 28 (13%) of the samples were collected from four-year-old horses. The two-year-old horses entered the training yard where the older horses resided in the beginning of April. At the time of first sampling, all the horses tested by HI (n = 26) had antibody titres against EI that were consistent with vaccination. All the horses had undetectable or low antibody titres (≤20) against EHV1 and 4. During the study period, five horses seroconverted to EI and 12 to EHV-1 and/or EHV-4 in response to vaccination. The remaining horses were not vaccinated against these viruses during the study period and no other seroconversions to EI, EHV-1 or EHV-4 were detected. All the horses were seronegative for EAV throughout the study period. Thus, there was no serological evidence of natural exposure to these viruses during the study period. With the exception of two of the two-year-old horses (antibody titres of 80 and 40) all the horses had undetectable or low antibody titres (≤20) against ERAV at the time of first sampling in April. This was also true for ERBV, with the exception of one two-year-old with an antibody titre of 40. The first seroconversion to ERAV was observed at the second sampling occasion in the beginning of May. One seronegative two-year-old colt had mounted a significant antibody response to ERAV (0 to 160) within four weeks of arriving in the training yard. He did not exhibit clinical respiratory signs but was described by the trainer as very slow at work. Within the following two weeks, clinical signs, including inappetence, dullness, nasal discharge, limb oedema, enlarged submandibular lymph nodes and occasional coughing, were observed in seven of the in-contact two-year-old horses. They were returned to the stud farm of origin to recuperate where blood samples were collected for serological testing. Four of the horses seroconverted to ERAV during the first two weeks in May, two were seropositive with stable titres, and one seroconverted at a later time point. The ERAV serological results are summarized in Figure 1 . Four additional seroconversions in two-year-old horses were identified by the end of May. Three of these horses had acute respiratory disease and were moved back to the stud farm. The fourth horse was subclinically infected and remained in training but was slow at work. By the end of June, four new seroconversions to ERAV were detected but only one horse had clinical respiratory signs and was returned home. One subclinically infected horse had previously seroconverted in early May. The number of seroconversions to ERAV decreased with time, with two in July, one of which was a horse that had previously seroconverted in the first week of May. One horse seroconverted in August and one in September, which had seroconverted previously in May. In contrast to the initial exposure to virus, these seroconversions in autumn were not associated with clinical respiratory signs or loss of performance. No seroconversions to ERAV or ERBV and no clinical respiratory signs were observed in the three-year-old horses during the study period. One four-year-old horse seroconverted to ERAV at the end of May, but no clinical signs were observed and he won a race five days before the seropositive blood sample was collected. In total, 18 seroconversions to ERAV were detected during the study period and 17 of them were in two-year-old horses. The majority, i.e. 13 (72%) of the seroconversions occurred in May and June. Only one of the two-year-old horses raced in May prior to being sent back to the stud farm to recover from respiratory disease. The two-year-old horses did not start racing after the respiratory episode until July, and, as can be seen in Figure 2 , the percentage of two year-old-horses participating in race meetings was strikingly low when compared to the other two age groups. In total, during the study period, the five three-year-old horses raced 20 times and were placed first, second or third 12 times. The four older horses raced 12 times with six places. Only six of the 21 two-year-old horses raced. However, from 18 starts, they were placed 11 times. There was a significant association between seroconversion to ERAV and subsequent failure to race (p = 0.009). The time from seroconversion to ERAV until the titers decreased to insignificant levels ranged from three weeks to five months, with a median value of two months and a mean value of 2.3 months. An association was observed between the antibody level and the rate of decline to original level. Only one seroconversion to ERBV was observed in this study, a two-year-old horse seroconverted in June without any associated clinical respiratory signs.
