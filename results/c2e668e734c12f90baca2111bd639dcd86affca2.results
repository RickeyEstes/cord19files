The total number of patients who visited the outpatient department at the city hospital during the 3-day survey period was 2985, and a total of 959 questionnaires were completed (response rate = 30.5%). Tables 1 and 2 show basic characteristics of the study participants and their intention to continue outpatient visits before they read the information about the infectious disease treatment unit in the hospital. Before they read the information about the unit, when we asked respondents their intention of outpatient visits if a SARS patient was admitted to the unit in the hospital, 44% of them replied that they would suspend visits to the outpatient department. Table 3 shows the change in the respondents' intention of outpatient visits at the hospital if a SARS patient was admitted to the hospital before and after the respondents read the information about SARS infection control at the infectious disease treatment unit in the hospital. The proportion of patients who intended to continue outpatient visits at the hospital significantly increased after they read the information (P < 0.001): 38% of the respondents who initially intended to suspend ambulatory care visits replied that they intended to continue outpatient visits to the hospital. Tables 4 and  5 show results from the bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses to examine factors associated with respondents' intention to continue outpatient visits to the hospital. The logistic regression analysis revealed that, after the respondents read the information about the unit, those who had visited outpatient department frequently (P < 0.05), those who were relieved after reading the information about the unit (P < 0.001), and those who did not worry about SARS infection in the hospital (P < 0.001), were significantly more likely to continue outpatient visits at the hospital, even if a SARS patient were admitted to the hospital. The other logistic regression analysis showed that, among respondents who initially intended to suspend ambulatory visits to the hospital, those who had frequently visited the outpatient department (P < 0.001), those who were relieved after reading the information about the unit (P < 0.001), and those who did not worry about nosocomial SARS infection in the hospital (P < 0.001), were significantly more likely to change their intention to continue outpatient visits at the hospital. Table 6 shows a result of simulations to estimate the cumulative total number of outpatients at the hospital during the 180-day period following a SARS patient's admission to the unit, and to examine the impact of the provision of information about the infection control in the unit. Before the respondents read the information, the cumulative number of outpatients and the cumulative total expenditures for outpatient care during a 180-day period were estimated to decrease by 20% after admission of a SARS patient. We also estimated that the hospital would lose total expenditures for outpatient care of US $2.0 million during the 180-day period. The presentation of information about the infection control in the unit was estimated to change these numbers by 7%.
