The carboxy-terminal half of nsp1 is dispensable for MHV replication To determine whether nsp1 is required for MHV replication, viruses were engineered to lack nsp1 residues A 2 through L 241 (nsp1DFL) or to express truncated forms of the protein lacking either Q 87 through N 164 (nsp1DMid) or K 124 through L 241 (nsp1DC) (Fig. 1B) . All deletion constructs were designed to maintain the start codon, the translational reading frame, and the minimal residues thought to be required for cleavage of nsp1 from the polyprotein by PLP1 (nsp1 residues K 243 through G 247 ) . Mutations were engineered into the nsp1-coding region within the MHV infectious cDNA (icMHV) fragment A plasmid. The mutagenized plasmids were then used to assemble full-length MHV cDNA, which was transcribed in vitro to yield MHV genomic RNA (Yount et al., 2002) . BHK-MHVR cells were electroporated with either assembled wild-type (icwt) or nsp1 mutant genomic RNA transcripts. Cells were incubated at 37 -C and were monitored for syncytia formation, a cytopathic effect (CPE) of MHV replication. Virus-induced syncytia were detected at 24 h postelectroporation (p.e.) in cells transfected with icwt genomic RNA and at 72 h p.e. in cells transfected with genomic RNA for the carboxy-terminal truncation mutant (nsp1DC). Clarified cell culture media harvested from cells electroporated with either icwt or nsp1DC RNA were capable of initiating a productive infection in freshly inoculated DBT-9 cells, demonstrating the presence of viable virus. In contrast, cells electroporated with nsp1DFL or nsp1DMid RNA showed foci containing 5 -10 cell nuclei at 72 -96 h p.e., but these multi-nucleated foci did not progress or spread over time like wild-type MHV syncytia. The clarified media from cells electroporated with nsp1DFL or nsp1DMid genomes were not capable of producing CPE in freshly inoculated DBT-9 cells. This result indicated that nsp1DFL and nsp1DMid were not capable of completing a productive life cycle, defined by the lack of infectious virus particles in the cell media supernatant following electroporation. Nsp1DFL and nsp1DMid RNA molecules were tested for their capacity to produce viruses in three independent experiments, all of which yielded this same result. The nsp1DC virus was purified by three rounds of plaque isolation, and RT-PCR was used to sequence across the entire nsp1-coding region. The mutant virus maintained the engineered deletion and had no other mutations within nsp1. These results demonstrate that the carboxy-terminal half of nsp1 is dispensable for MHV replication and suggest that deletion of residues in the amino-terminal half is not tolerated for a productive infection. Charge-to-alanine mutagenesis of the nsp1 amino-terminus The fact that nsp1DFL and nsp1DMid did not generate productive infections suggests that this region of the protein has a critical function in MHV replication. However, it is also possible that the deletions removed required RNA elements within the 5V end of the nsp1coding sequence. To investigate the function of the nsp1 amino-terminus with minimal disruption of the correspond-ing RNA sequence, viruses were engineered to contain point mutations within this region. Mutations were introduced into the icMHV fragment A plasmid using sitedirected mutagenesis. Single or paired charged residues (D, E, R, K, and H) within the amino-terminal half of MHV nsp1 that are conserved across all group 2 coronaviruses were substituted with alanine (Fig. 1B) . Mutated fragment A cDNAs were used as before to generate full-length genomic viral RNA. Virus-induced syncytia were detected within 24 h in BHK-MHVR cells electroporated with either icwt RNA or with RNA for nsp1 mutants VUSB1, VUSB2, VUSB3, or VUSB7. The timing and extent of CPE following transfection with these mutants were indistinguishable from icwt. Cells transfected with RNA for VUSB4 exhibited CPE at 72 h p.e., similar to the kinetics observed with nsp1DC. The clarified media supernatants from cells transfected with VUSB1, VUSB2, VUSB3, VUSB4, or VUSB7 RNA were capable of infecting DBT-9 cells, indicating that they contained nsp1 mutant viruses. As with nsp1DC, the nsp1 point mutants were purified by three rounds of plaque isolation, and RT-PCR was used to sequence across the entire nsp1-coding region. The mutant viruses maintained the engineered changes and lacked other mutations within nsp1. Similar to the results with nsp1DFL and nsp1DMid, cells transfected with VUSB5 or VUSB6 RNA produced foci containing 5 -10 cell nuclei at 72 -96 h p.e, but the extent of these multi-nucleated foci did not increase over time. Moreover, clarified media supernatant harvested from cells transfected with VUSB5 or VUSB6 RNA did not generate a productive infection following incubation with DBT-9 cells, indicating that VUSB5 and VUSB6 were blocked at some stage in the viral life cycle. VUSB5 and VUSB6 RNA molecule were assayed for their capacity to produce viruses in two independent experiments, both of which showed the same result. It has been reported that charge-to-alanine mutagenesis of viral proteins may generate temperaturesensitive mutants (Hanley et al., 2002; Hassett and Condit, 1994; Tang et al., 2002) . In the current study, nsp1 mutants VUSB5, VUSB6, and nsp1DMid did not exhibit temperature-sensitive phenotypes as no infectious virus was recovered at either 37 -C or 32 -C. The nsp1DFL virus was not tested at 32 -C. Experiments were next performed to determine if viral gene expression occurred in cells electroporated with RNA for mutants that did not produce infectious virus (VUSB5, VUSB6, nsp1DFL, and nsp1DMid). Using antisera against MHV virions (a-MHV) or against nsp2 (a-nsp2), no viral proteins could be detected by immunofluorescence or immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Furthermore, no specific products were amplified from electroporated cells using RT-PCR and a primer that detects subgenomic RNAs (data not shown). These results suggest that, if viral protein or RNA expression occurred, it was below the level of detection using these assays.
