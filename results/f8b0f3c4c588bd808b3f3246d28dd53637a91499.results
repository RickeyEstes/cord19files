Nine thousand six hundred twenty-four consecutive patients with a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia having respiratory samples submitted to the microbiology laboratory were included in the study. Th e mean age was 57.8 Ï® 26.1 years (range, 18-97 years), with 5,648 men (58.7%) and 3,976 women (41.3%) ( Table 1 ) . Four thousand one hundred seventy-two patients (43.3%) had pneumonia present at hospital admission, 4,400 (45.7%) had hospital-acquired pneumonia, and 1,052 (10.9%) had ventilator-associated pneumonia. Among these patients, 4,432 (46.1%) were classifi ed as having culturenegative pneumonia, 1,940 (20.2%) as having pneumonia attributed to antibiotic-susceptible bacteria, 2,991 (31.1%) as having pneumonia attributed to potentially antibioticresistant bacteria, and 261 (2.7%) as having viral pneumonia. Charlson comorbidity scores were statistically greatest for patients who were culture negative and those with viral pneumonia ( Table 1 ). Th ere were 585 patients readmitted to the hospital within 90 days. Th e most common reasons for readmission included nonpneumonia infections (n 5 163, 27.9%), nonpneumonia pulmonary conditions (COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis, cystic fi brosis) (n 5 125, 21.4%), pneumonia (n 5 62, 10.6%), respiratory failure (n 5 45, 7.7%), nonpneumonia organ transplant complications (n 5 43, 7.4%), non-congestive heart failure cardiac events (n 5 26, 4.4%), GI conditions (n 5 24, 4.1%), CNS conditions (n 5 20, 3.4%), and congestive heart failure (n 5 17, 2.9%). Among patients with pneumonia attributed to antibiotic-susceptible bacteria, methicillin-susceptible S aureus was most common, followed by H infl uenzae , S pneumonia e, Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Escherichia coli ( Table 2 ) . For pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria P aeruginosa was most prevalent, followed by methicillin-resistant S aureus , Enterobacter species, Acinetobacter species, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia . Herpes simplex virus was the most common respiratory virus, followed by cytomegalovirus, infl uenza A, parainfl uenza, and rhinovirus. Th e prevalence of 90-day hospital readmission among hospital survivors (n 5 7,637, 79.4%) was greatest for patients with pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria (11.4%), followed by a viral cause (8.3%), pneumonia attributed to antibioticsusceptible bacteria (6.6%), and culture-negative pneumonia (5.8%) ( P , .001) ( Fig 1 ) . Similar distributions were identifi ed for 30-day and 180-day readmission rates (30 day: 6.7%, 4.4%, 4.3%, 3.2%; P , .001; and 180 day: 14.6%, 9.4%, 8.6%, 7.6%; P , .001). Patients with a 90-day readmission had a lower BMI, were less likely to receive mechanical ventilation, had greater Charlson comorbidity scores, and were statistically more likely to have congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, COPD, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, leukemia, and cirrhosis compared with patients without a 90-day readmission ( Table 3 ) . Pneumonia on admission and pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria were significantly more likely, whereas hospital-acquired pneumonia and culturenegative pneumonia were less likely, to be present in patients with a 90-day readmission. Kaplan-Meier analysis censoring for mortality demonstrated that 90-day readmission was statistically most common among patients with pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria ( Fig 2 ) . Multiple logistic regression analysis identifi ed pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria to be independently associated with 90-day readmission (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.56-1.97; P , .001). Other independent predictors of 90-day readmission were Charlson comorbidity score . 4, cirrhosis, and chronic kidney disease, whereas culture-negative pneumonia was associated with a lower risk of 90-day readmission ( Table 4 ) . Th e adjusted ORs for the variables that were signifi cant predictors in the model in all of the 10 sequential reruns (with 90% of the cohort) did not diff er from the fi ndings in the complete population. Th e analysis was repeated for the subgroup of patients with pneumonia on admission, encompassing both community-acquired pneumonia and health-careassociated pneumonia. Similar to the entire cohort, the prevalence of 90-day hospital readmission among hospital survivors (n 5 3,495) was greatest for patients with More than one listed pathogen could be present within each category.
