Generation of GLRaV-2 replicons tagged by insertion of the fluorescent, enzymatic, and epitope reporters Because the infectious cDNA clones provide powerful tools for investigation of the RNA virus gene functions Pogue et al., 2002) , we generated such clone for GLRaV-2 to determine functional profiles of L1 and L2. The entire, 16,486 nt-long GLRaV-2 genome was sequenced (Genbank accession no. FJ436234) and compared to the other isolates of this virus to reveal the closest relationship (99.6% nt identity) to the isolate 94/970 (Meng et al., 2005) . The initial full-length clone was assembled using a binary vector and primarily conventional cDNA cloning to avoid introduction of the PCR-generated mutations, and sequenced to confirm its correspondence to the consensus nucleotide sequence of the viral genome. To facilitate launching of viral infection by agroinoculation, 35S RNA polymerase promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and a ribozyme sequence were inserted upstream and downstream of the GLRaV-2 sequence, respectively, as described earlier for BYV Prokhnevsky et al., 2002) . The resulting full-length GLRaV-2 clone was further modified to accommodate a reporter gene expression cassette immediately upstream of the CP open reading frame. This cassette contained GFP open reading frame followed by the BYV CP subgenomic RNA promoter. As a result, the latter promoter directed expression of the GLRaV-2 CP, while the authentic GLRaV-2 CP promoter expressed the GFP reporter. This tagged full-length GLRaV-2 replicon was designated LR-GFP (Fig. 1A , middle diagram). As was shown for BYV, deletion of the genes that are not required for the viral RNA amplification in the individual cells facilitates experimentation with the remaining genes that code for the leader protease, RNA replicase and RNAi suppressor (Chiba et al., 2006; Hagiwara et al., 1999; Peng and Dolja, 2000) . In the case of GLRaV-2, such minireplicon was generated by deletion of the gene block spanning genome region from p6 to p19 open reading frames and retention of the reporter gene. The reporter expression cassette was further modified to express a fusion of GFP with β-glucuronidase to result in the tagged GLRaV-2 minireplicon designated mLR-GFP/GUS (Fig. 1A , bottom diagram). To permit immunochemical detection of L2, both LR-GFP and mLR-GFP/GUS were modified by an insertion of the triple hemagglutinin epitope (HA) tag into the N-terminal domain of L2 (L2 HA in the Figs. 1B and 2). Infectivity of the full-length and minireplicon variants was tested using leaf agroinfiltration of N. benthamiana, a systemic experimental host of GLRaV-2 (Goszczynski et al., 1996) . For mLR-GFP/GUS, such agroinfiltration resulted in minireplicon RNA accumulation and efficient expression of the fluorescent and enzymaticallyactive GFP/GUS reporter in the initially inoculated cells ( Fig. 1B and data not shown). Importantly, the level of GUS activity in a HA-tagged variant was~85% of that in the original mLR-GFP/GUS. Because this modest reduction was only marginally statistically significant (p valuẽ 0.001), we concluded that the insertion of HA tag into L2 did not significantly affect viral genome amplification. Our attempts to insert an HA tag into L1 resulted in non-infectious replicons and were abandoned. Both the original and HA-tagged variants of the full-length LR-GFP were systemically infectious in N. benthamiana; typical symptoms of the viral infection and GFP fluorescence were detected in the upper non-inoculated leaves by 3 weeks post-agroinfiltration of the bottom leaves ( Fig. 1A and data not shown). Therefore, we successfully generated a series of the infectious tagged GLRaV-2 replicons that can (top), full-length, GFP-tagged cDNA clone of GLRaV-2 (LR-GFP, middle) and GFP/GUS-tagged minireplicon (mLR-GFP/GUS, bottom).
