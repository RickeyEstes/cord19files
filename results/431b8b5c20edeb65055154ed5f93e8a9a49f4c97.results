To test our developed algorithm, we applied it to six sets of benchmark data. Different model might result different phylogenetic tree, therefore it is important to choose the most appropriate method. Here, we used Fitch-Margoliash or UPGMA (UPGMA = Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) approaches in PHYLIP package 24 for generating the phylogenetic tree. On the benchmark data, result generated using both the approaches has minor differences between them. However, we chose optimal tree based on taxonomic classification and compare with existing tools. The six benchmark datasets used in this study are as follows: (i) NADH Dehydrogenase 5 (ND 5) protein sequences. (ii) NADH Dehydrogenase 6 (ND 6) protein sequences. (iii) xylanases protein sequences in the F10 and G11 datasets. (iv) transferrin protein sequences. (v) coronavirus spike protein sequences. (vi) beta-globin protein sequences.
