Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 . The median patient age was 65 years; 37% of patients were aged 70 years or older. Fifty-five percent of patients had breast cancer as their primary malignancy; therefore a majority of the patient cohort was female. Seventy-eight percent of patients designated themselves as white. Only 4% of patients had less than a high school education. The majority (76%) of patients were referred to a radiation oncologist for definitive therapy. Distributions of survey item responses by cancer site are provided in Fig. 1 . One percent of patients preferred not to be addressed by their first name by their radiation oncologist. Seventy-five percent of all patients were neutral about the radiation oncologist wearing a white coat, whereas 97% of patients agreed (strongly or moderately) that they preferred the radiation oncologist to explain their radiation treatment in detail. Ninety-five percent also wanted the radiation oncologist to use everyday language to help explain their radiation treatment. Nearly all patients (95%) preferred to be told their prognosis and chances for cure. Only 19% of all patients did not feel comfortable (strongly or moderately) discussing their religious beliefs with their radiation oncologist, whereas 47% were neutral. Thirty-one percent of patients would feel uncomfortable if the radiation oncologist discussed his or her own religious beliefs. There were significant associations of Item 3 (hand holding) with gender (p = 0.039) and education (p = 0.028). Women more often agreed with the statement, ''If my doctor held my hand throughout any important discussion, that would make me feel that my doctor really cares about me,'' whereas highly educated patients more often disagreed. The latter effect is not explained by an association between education and gender, because women in this study were more educated than the men (17% postgraduate compared with 13% among men). In summary, men and highly educated patients (male or female) more often disagreed with the statement. The response to Item 5 showed that 42% of all patients disagreed that they would feel uncomfortable if the radiation oncologist were to hug them the end of treatment. However, 56% of breast cancer patients disagreed with Item 5, compared with only 19% of prostate cancer patients (p < 0.0001). Item 5 was also associated with gender (p < 0.0001) but not with education or age. Patients were further grouped according to both disease and gender (breast, female/lung, male/lung, and prostate) and cross-tabulated with Item 5 ( Table 2 ). Breast cancer patients had the highest rate of disagreement with item 5 (53%), followed by female lung cancer patients (42%), male lung cancer patients (37%), and prostate cancer patients (19%). Male patients were more often neutral on this item.
