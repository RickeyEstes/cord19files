Performance characteristics of the in-house laboratory -developed HAdV qPCR assay were evaluated with reference to the RealStar® Adenovirus PCR Kit. Analytical sensitivity (LoD) is the lowest concentration of HAdV DNA that can be detected in 95% of the replicates. For the in-house assay, the LoD for plasma was 2.06 log 10 copies/mL (95% CI: 1.92-2.38 log 10 copies/mL) and that for VTM was 2.31 log 10 copies/mL (95% CI: 2.16-2.63 log 10 copies/mL) ( Table 1) . For LLoQ determination, we have calculated the SD using the concentrations with all replicates shown positive for HAdV ( Table 1 ). The LLoQ for plasma and VTM were 2.60 log 10 copies/mL and 2.94 log 10 copies/mL, respectively, based on the SD of no greater than 0.15 log 10 copies/mL (Table 2) , while the SD values of the replicates with the concentrations 2.30 log 10 copies/mL for plasma, and 2.34 and 2.64 log 10 copies/mL for VTM were greater than 0.15 log 10 copies/mL (data not shown). The analytical specificity of the in-house HAdV qPCR assay was evaluated. The in-house assay did not show cross reaction with cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr Virus, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, human herpesvirus 6, 7, and 8, BK virus, JC virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, parvovirus B19, human bocavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza virus 1-4, human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS-, and MERS-CoV), human enterovirus and rhinovirus, human parechovirus, and influenza viruses A, B, and C. Testing of the in-house HAdV qPCR assay across the range of detection from 2.60 to 9 log 10 (plasma) and 2.94 to 9 log 10 (VTM) copies/mL demonstrated excellent agreement between expected and observed viral loads with a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.996 and 0.998, respectively (Fig. 1 ). In the replication experiment for evaluating the intra-and inter-assay variations, total imprecision (%CV) values for the 8 concentrations ranged from 0.07 to 3.21% for plasma and 0.17% to 2.11% for VTM ( Table 2) . The in-house HAdV qPCR assay was able to detect six adenovirus species A to F from the clinical and EQA samples. No species G was detected in this study. Among the 122 clinical specimens and 18 EQA samples subjected to HAdV DNA load quantification, 52 were positive (1 A, 26 B, 12 C, 1 D, 9 E, 2 F; the species were identified by BLASTn search from NCBI website using their partial hexon gene sequences) and 87 were negative by both in-house and commercial assays (see Additional file 1). No PCR inhibition was observed in any of the reactions for both assays. Using the RealStar® Adenovirus PCR Kit as the reference, the sensitivity and specificity of the in-house qPCR assay were 98.1% and 100%, respectively (Table 3 ). One sample that was not detected by the in-house assay but detected by the RealStar® Adenovirus PCR assay was excluded from linear regression analysis. There was a good agreement in the performance of the in-house HAdV qPCR assay compared to the RealStar® assay demonstrating a strong correlation with a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.984 (Fig. 2) . A Bland-Altman plot showed a mean difference of − 0.16 log 10 copies/mL between the two assays (SD: 0.27) (Fig. 3) . For the clinical sample (16 M466615) that was tested positive by the RealStar® Adenovirus PCR Kit but negative by our in-house assay, it was subjected to partial hexon gene PCR. The partial hexon gene could not be amplified for this sample. For another sample (16 M456964 ) that was tested positive by both in-house and commercial assays, its partial hexon gene could not be amplified, this was likely due to the low viral load in the sample (< 1.7 log 10 copies/mL). For the EQA samples evaluation, the in-house HAdV qPCR assay could give the viral load values that are close to the consensus values in the reports of CAP and QCMD, and within our acceptance criteria for EQA samples (consensus value ±1.96 SD) (see Additional file 1). The data (i.e. the consensus results) on the samples from QCMD came from an External Quality Assessment study and was not part of a formal method comparison.
