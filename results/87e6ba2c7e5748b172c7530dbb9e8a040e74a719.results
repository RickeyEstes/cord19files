The 330 patients included in the study exhibited the classical clinical symptoms of the disease and were divided according to the progression of infection into two groups: patients that presented severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and were hospitalized (n = 156) following Brazilian Ministry of Health protocol [14] and patients with mild symptoms non-hospitalized (n = 174) ( Table 1) . There was a predominance of women among the patients studied (61.5%) and the mean patient age was 24.7 years (1-80 years). Forty-seven of the women were pregnant and 28 were hospitalized. Radiologic alterations were found in 51.9% of hospitalized patients. Most hospitalized patients had no comorbidities (59%). However, patients with comorbidities (metabolic disorders, immunosuppression and obesity) were significantly more frequent in the group of hospitalized patients. Deaths occurred in 55.7% of hospitalized patients. The population studied exhibited a mean European genetic contribution of 57.4%, a mean Native American contribution of 26.4% and a mean African contribution of 16.2% (Table 1) in agreement with previously data from Brazilian populations [13, 15] . In non-hospitalized patients the mean European contribution was 60% ranging from 4.6 to 91.9%, the mean Native American contribution was 25% ranging from 3.2 to 93.2%, and the mean African contribution was 15% ranging 2.2-61%. In hospitalized patients, genetic contribution was European 54.4% ranging from 5.9 to 93%, Native American 28% ranging from 3.5 to 90.6%, and African 17,6% ranging 2.4-67.6% (Additional files 1, 2). European and African genetic ancestry showed statistical differences between groups (p = 0.006 and p = 0.010, respectively). There were no significant differences in the allele or genotype frequencies of the CCR5Δ32 polymorphism between non-hospitalized and hospitalized patients (p = 0.289 and 0.431, respectively) ( Table 2) . A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of CCR5Δ32 polymorphism on infection severity controlling for European and African ancestry and the presence of comorbidities to avoid confounding effects. No association between patients carrying the Δ32 allele and severity was found (Table 3 ).
