Clinical and demographic characteristics of the studied individuals are summarized in Table 1 . The mean age of the patients was 45.4 ± 20.8 years and 76.4% of these individuals were male. Fatal outcome (%) 5.8 Data are means ± standard deviation (SD), or number and percentage. *2 patients had asthma and 1 COPD. The mean BMI (kg/m 2 ) was 29.2, and 23.5% required mechanical ventilation for 15.2 (mean) days. Patients had 22 days of hospitalization stay, 17.6% of them had co-morbidities such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 5.8% of these patients died. Patients who required mechanical ventilation displayed a Kirby index (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) (mean: 104.7). The main signs and symptoms at the start of the illness included fever, myalgia, cough, and headaches, while chest pain, dyspnea, and cyanosis occurred after the third day. Critically ill patients received oseltamivir (150 mg/day) during the period while they were under mechanical ventilation while non-critically ill patients received 150mg/day of oseltamivir for 5 days. Substitutions detected by whole genome sequencing of the AH1N1 09pdm influenza virus 13 of the substitutions we identified were novel, and their potential biological role has not been defined. Substitutions that have been previously reported are involved in host specificity shift, viral oligomerization interfaces (VOI), binding small ligands (BSL), Ab's recognition, binding host proteins (BHP), binding nucleic acids (BNA) and antigenic drift. VOI is calculated automatically from known structures and captures sites both in viral oligomerization sites as well as crystal contacts. BHP includes mostly interaction with human immune response proteins. BSL is derived from small ligands seen in known crystal structures and, in case of influenza surface proteins, often signifies interaction with small glycans which can be in or near a glycosylation site. Fig 1) . These Mexican sequences clustered next to HA sequences of strains from New York (CY189313, CY189361, bootstrap value 66). These sequences share two substitutions in Signal Peptide of the immature HA at amino acid 7 and 15 (-11 V/I and -3 A/T). Group 2 (KR271559 and KR1571583) sequences clustered separately and shared a novel substitution in HA H138Q. Group 3 (KR271599 and KR271567) clustered with strains isolated in New York, Washington and Helsinki. One isolate (KR271567) shared mutation T474M with sequences from Helsinki and Finland principally. We mapped the amino acid substitutions occurring at the nodes of H1N1/2009 HA phylogeny, revealing amino acid changes at K163Q and A256T for 2013-2014 sequences as reported previously. Additionally, a cluster of 2 Mexican sequences was marked by substitution H138Q. Regarding NA, we observed 3 substitutions that marked sequences from 2013-2014; I34V, I321V and K432E. To determine whether individual sites were under positive selection, we used the mixed effects model of evolution (MEME) method. Only I34V was statistically significant (P = 0.05). Additionally we found substitutions that distinguished the three groups mentioned above with HA analyses. We observed substitution Q308L in group 1, while T452I was found in group 2 and the substitutions N449K, N386K and S82P were present on sequence KR271569 in group 3. For NS1 we detected the substitution L36I in group 1, the N127S in group 2 and finally the substitution K131E in group 3. Regarding PA we found the substitution I13V as a signature of the group 1 (statistically significant with P = 0.05), while in group 3 we detected two substitutions F35L and I459T. In PB1 we associated the substitution A374T with group 2 and M646I with group 3. In PB2 T676I was found in group 2 [17] . Other substitutions Red dots at nodes show branches with 50% bootstrap support leading to the 2014 sequences described in this work. Trees for the rest of the viral genome segments can be found in S1-S7 Figs (S1 Fig  NA, S2 Fig PB2, S3 Fig PB2, S4 Fig PA, S5 Fig M, S6 Fig NP, S7 Fig NS) . were found in M1, M2, NS2 and NP but were similar to those reported in other countries ( Table 2 ).
