the third row shows how many types do not appear. From the viewpoint of amino acid pairs, no matter the length of a protein is, the number of its theoretically possible types cannot be more than 400, and therefore the difference between proteins is either how many types of theoretically possible amino acid pairs appear or how many times a theoretically possible type of amino acid pair repeats or both. Table 1 shows 59, 86 and 66 types are absent from the spike protein of SARS-CoV, strain 229E and strain OC43 (third row in the Table) , respectively. Still Table 1 shows that 76, 78 and 61 types appear once in the spike protein of SARS-CoV, strain 229E and strain OC43 (fourth row in the Table) , respectively, and so on. The absent types include 17 randomly predictable and 42 randomly unpredictable with regard to SARS-CoV spike protein, 37 randomly predictable and 49 randomly unpredictable with regard to strain 229E spike protein, and 12 randomly predictable and 54 randomly unpredictable with regard to strain OC43 spike protein. Still we can classify the present amino acid pairs as randomly predictable and unpredictable with respect to theoretically possible types and pairs, because some theoretically possible types appear many times (from row 5 to row 23 in Table 1 ). The columns 3, 4, 5 and 6 in Table 2 show how many predictable and unpredictable types and pairs in human spike proteins. When corresponding the position of each mutation to predictable pairs and unpredictable pairs, we find that a vast majority of mutations occurs at the unpredictable pairs (columns 7, 8, 9 and 10 in Table 2 ). Fig. 1 shows the ratios of frequency difference (AF−PF) versus mutation number per each type of substituted amino acid pairs in spike proteins. It can be seen that there is a general tendency in the ratios, i.e. the larger the difference, the higher the chance of mutation occurring. Therefore, the difference between actual and predicted frequencies indicates the potential chance of mutation occurring in amino acid pairs. As the point missense mutations substitute one type of amino acid to another one, we can gain some insight into the mutation tendency after comparing the difference between actual and predicted frequencies in substituted and substituting amino acid pairs. For the numerical analysis, we calculate the difference between actual frequency (AF) and predicted frequency (PF) in amino acid pairs before and after mutation, i.e. (AF−PF). For instance, a mutation at position 244 substitutes "I" to "T" which results in two amino acid pairs "DI" and "IW" changing to "DT" and "TW", because the amino acid is "D" at position 243 and "W" at position 245. The actual frequency and predicted frequency are 7 and 5 for "DI", 1 and 1 for "IW", 2 and 6 for "DT", and 0 and 1 for "TW", respectively. Thus, the difference between actual frequency and predicted frequency is 2 with regard to the substituted amino acid pairs, i.e. pairs affected by mutations. Fig. 2 shows the difference between actual and predicted frequencies in both substituted and substituting amino acid pairs in spike proteins. It can be seen that the substituting pairs distribute more centrally and symmetrically than the substituted pairs do. The sum of differences between actual and predicted frequencies is statistically smaller in substituting amino acid pairs than in substituted ones in Table 3 (the Student's t-test, P < 0.05). These statistical differences suggest that the mutations lead to the deduction of difference between actual and predicted frequencies. From a probabilistic viewpoint, this means that the mutations are more likely to occur, and these findings are similar to the results in our recent studies [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . As mentioned in Section 2, the actual frequency can be equal to, larger than or smaller than the predicted frequency. Accordingly we can look at these relationships with respect to the substituted (Table 4 ) and substituting (Table 5) pairs. Table 4 reveals that more than 75% of mutations occur at the pairs, whose actual frequency is larger than their pre- Table 5 Classification of substituting amino acid pairs with respect to mutations in the spike proteins from different human coronaviruses dicted frequency in one or both substituted pairs (the first three rows in unpredictable pairs). Comparing the first three rows with the last two rows in unpredictable pairs, we can see that the mutations are more likely to target the pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than predicted frequencies. Therefore, Table 4 suggests which type of amino acid pairs are more likely to be substituted, i.e. the different sensitivities of amino acid pairs to mutations in spike proteins. Table 5 shows in which types of amino acid pairs the mutations are likely or unlikely to form in spike proteins. We can find that more than 60% of mutations result in one or both substituting pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted frequencies. Taking the results in both  Tables 3 and 4 into account, the mutations are likely to attack the pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than their predicted ones and the consequences of mutations are likely to form the pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted ones. In such a manner, the mutations reduce the difference between actual and predicted frequencies (Fig. 2) .
