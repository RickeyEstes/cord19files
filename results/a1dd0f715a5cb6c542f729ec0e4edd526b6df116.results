There was a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Taiwan near the end of the study. Of 24 children, 4 children (2 in the experimental group, 2 in the control group) withdrew before the study's completion because parents were concerned about SARS and did not want their children to come to the laboratory, which was located inside a hospital, for a follow-up test. Some of the demographic data of these children who withdrew differed from the participant children. Compared with the participant children, the children who withdrew were statistically significantly older (109.8Ϯ6.4mo), heavier (26.1Ϯ4.3kg), and taller (127.0Ϯ10.9cm). However, their outcome measure data for the preassessment were similar to the participant children in this study. For example, the GMFM goal scores of the children who withdrew were 81.5Ϯ7.4, and the 1-RM STS was 10.3Ϯ2.4. The values did not differ significantly from those of the participant group. Only 20 children with CP completed this study (follow-up rate, 83%). Their mean age, body weight, body height, and GMFCS levels are shown in table 1, and mean motor activities and muscle strength are in table 2. No statistical differences between demographic data and the 5 outcome measures of the 2 groups were found before training (t range, 0.29Ϫ1.19; independent t test, P range, .25Ϫ.78) (see tables 1, 2) . At the beginning of the study, both the experimental and control groups had 2 children each that received PT twice a week and 8 children once a week. The PT service frequency was similar between the 2 groups. Although the investigatiors attempted to standardize the frequency and volume of the training, the children did not perform exactly as expected because of other activities. According to their exercise diary, children in the experimental group performed the loaded STS exercise 18.0Ϯ3.2 times (range, 12Ϫ21 times) during the 6-week training period. All children of the experimental group had loaded STS exercise at least twice a week, and 3 children exercised more than 3 times a week because the caregivers wanted more than we asked. Their average maximum repetitions of 50% of 1-RM STS varied from 20 to 100 each session during the training. With program progress, the mean 1-RM STS Ϯ standard deviation increased from 9.6Ϯ5.2kg, to 11.0Ϯ5.2kg, to 12.6Ϯ6.0 kg, and to 13.5Ϯ5.9kg in the experiment group every 2 weeks. Therefore, the mean load used for loaded STS exercise during the first 2 weeks was 4.8kg (range, 1Ϫ9kg), the load for the following 2 weeks was 5.5kg (range, 2.3Ϫ9.5kg), and the load for the last 2 weeks was 6.3kg (range, 2.5Ϫ10.5kg). Children in both groups decreased or stopped PT services during this study because of the fear of the SARS epidemic in Taiwan. In the experimental group, 4 children received PT once a week, 2 children once every 2 weeks, and 4 children discontinued PT. In the control group, 1 child received PT twice a week, 5 once a week, 1 once every 2 weeks, and 3 received no PT at all. In general, children of the control group received PT more frequently during the study period. Table 2 shows the actual pre-and post-training score means and the adjusted post-training means of the 5 outcome measures of the 2 groups, and the ANCOVA analysis on the post-training scores. Results indicated that, after a 6-week loaded STS exercise, there were significant differences in the GMFM goal dimension score (F 1,17 ϭ4.81, PϽ.05), 1-RM STS
