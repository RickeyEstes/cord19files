The study was performed as a cross-sectional study, in which 353 patients of Han Chinese origin with metabolic syndrome were analyzed. Table I shows the clinical and biochemical characteristics of the patients with metabolic syndrome. Genotype and allele frequencies for the A/G polymorphism of the ACE2 gene are presented in Table II . G allele frequencies in patients with metabolic syndrome were 36.6% in female subjects and 43.4% in male subjects, respectively. As shown in Table III , the clinical and biochemical parameters of patients with metabolic syndrome were analyzed according to their genotype in women and in men. No significant differences in age, BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio according to genotype could be observed. In women carrying the GG genotype, the diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher compared with the GA or AA genotype (92 Ϯ 3 mm Hg vs 84 Ϯ 1 mm Hg or 84 Ϯ 2 mm Hg; P Ͻ 0.01). In men who carry the G allele, the diastolic blood pressure was not significantly different compared with those who carry the A allele (87 Ϯ 2 mm Hg vs 85 Ϯ 2 mm Hg; P ϭ n.s.). To assess the extent to which the G allele and other risk factors were associated with hypertension, a multivariate logistic regression was performed using a stepwise approach. Multivariate logistic regression showed that female gender was significantly associated with diastolic hypertension. In addition, patients who carry the GG genotype had significantly higher risk for increased diastolic blood pressure (OR 2.83 [95% CI 1.36 to 5.91]; P ϭ 0.005; Table IV) .
