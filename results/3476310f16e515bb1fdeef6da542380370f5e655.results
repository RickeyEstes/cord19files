Demographic and selected characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1 . Participants' Approximately 76.6% of the participants reported having received SARS-related health education information from the media in the past 2 weeks. Notably, based on multiple responses, the major issues about which the participants wished to learn more from the media were: (1) SARS symptoms and places to seek help (48.0%); (2) updated international SARS epidemic data (46.7%); (3) the government's preparedness and updated policies for a SARS resurgence (42.1%); (4) the most recent SARS research (29.4%); (5) management of SARS-related emotional disturbance (19.8%); and (6) advocacy for preventing SARS infection (18.0%). Although 89.7% of the participants agreed with the statement that some measure of personal control (such as wearing a protective mask) could reduce the possibility of contracting SARS, 61.2% had prepared for self-protection, and 10.4% of the participants reported that they themselves or their relatives and neighbors had been quarantined. Furthermore, 69.9% of the participants considered that a person with HIV/AIDS would be more stigmatized than one with SARS. Approximately 9.2% of the participants reported that they had become more pessimistic as a result of the SARS outbreak, and the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was judged to be 11.7%. The prevalence of BSRS items in the BSRS-5 defined case group was distributed as follows: the highest prevalence was for sleep disturbance (4.2%), followed by anxiety (3.2%), depression (3.0%), inferiority (2.9%), and hostility (2.3%). The BSRS-5 demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency in the present samples (α = 0.82). A total of 124 (9.7%) participants reported that they or their relatives/friends had encountered SARS-related discrimination. The three leading causes of discrimination were having suspect SARSrelated symptoms such as cough or fever (54.0%), having been quarantined at home (13.7%), and having family members who worked as medical staff (8.1%). Table 2 displays how BSRS-5-defined cases are associated with being 50-59 years of age (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.27-0.94), or ≥ 60 years of age (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.19-0.83), a high-school graduate (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.07-3.02), and worried about the recurrence of SARS (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.02-2.16). Results of the multivariate analysis for factors associated with becoming more pessimistic after the SARS crisis are presented in Table 3 . Factors
