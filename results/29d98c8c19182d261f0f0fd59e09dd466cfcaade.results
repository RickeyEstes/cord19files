Comparison of the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the ZIKV RT-iiPCR and reference CDC and PAHO ZIKV RT-qPCR assays (i).Analytical sensitivity. The analytical sensitivity of the PON ZIKV RT-iiPCR was determined using a (a) ten-fold dilution series (six replicates per dilution) of ZIKV IVT RNA (10 7 to 0.1 IVT RNA copies/μl) containing the target sequence, and (b) ten-fold serial dilutions (10 0 -10 −13 ) of nucleic acid extracted from TCF derived from ZIKV PRVABC59infected Vero cells containing a viral titer of 10 7 PFU/ml. These samples were also used to determine the analytical sensitivities of the CDC-validated prM and E, and PAHO-validated NS2B ZIKV RT-qPCR assays (Tables 3 and 4 ). Standard curves generated for the three RT-qPCR assays using both a serial dilution of infectious TCF and IVT RNA demonstrated perfect linearity (R 2 > 0.99) and optimal amplification efficiencies ranging between 97% and 105% (data not shown). For the ZIKV IVT RNA serial dilution, the RT-iiPCR showed 100%, 83%, 83%, 17%, and 0% detection rates for reaction mixtures containing 1000; 100; 10; 1; and 0.1 IVT RNA copies/μl, respectively (Table 3) , and a 100% detection endpoint at 10 PFU/ml of infectious TCF (PRVABC59 strain, Table 4 ). Probit analysis determined that the limit of detection 95% (LOD 95% ) of the ZIKV RT-iiPCR was 130 copies/μl of ZIKV IVT RNA. Regarding the CDC and PAHO RT-qPCR assays, the 100% detection endpoints were found at 10,000 IVT RNA copies/μl and 100 PFU/ml of infectious TCF for the prM RT-qPCR assay, 100 IVT RNA copies/μl and 10 PFU/ml of infectious TCF for the E RT-qPCR assay, and 10 IVT RNA copies/μl and 10 PFU/ml of infectious TCF for the NS2B RT-qPCR assay, respectively (Tables 3 and 4) . LOD 95% was estimated at 4102; 21; and 6 IVT RNA copies/μl for the prM, E, and NS2B RT-qPCR assays, respectively. Therefore, the overall analytical sensitivity of the ZIKV RT-iiPCR was comparable to that of the CDC E and PAHO NS2B RT-qPCR assays in detecting viral RNA, while having a higher performance when compared to that of the CDC prM RT-qPCR assay. (ii). Analytical specificity. The specificity and pan-reactivity of the ZIKV CDC and PAHO RT-qPCR and RT-iiPCR assays were evaluated using a panel of reference viral RNA from different ZIKV strains (African and Asian lineages) as well as other flaviviruses and alphaviruses that frequently cause similar clinical symptoms including DENV serotypes 1-4, WNV, YFV, and CHIKV ( Table 1 ). The CDC prM and PAHO NS2B RT-qPCR assays were able to detect all ZIKV strains from the Asian lineage. Table 5 ). The CDC E RT-qPCR and the RT-iiPCR assays successfully detected all ZIKV strains from both lineages (Table 5) . Moreover, the RT-iiPCR detected ZIKV RNA (PRVABC59 and FLR [Asian lineage], and MR766 [African lineage] strains) derived from both infected mammalian (Vero) and mosquito (C6/36 and AP-61) cell lines. All assays were highly specific and did not detect any other related flaviviruses or CHIKV (Table 5 ).
