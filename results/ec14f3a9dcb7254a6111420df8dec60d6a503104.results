All rRBD proteins expressed in mammalian cell, insect cell, and E. coli expression systems maintained intact conformation and authentic antigenicity The purified rRBD proteins expressed in the above expression systems were detected by Western blot using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that contain different conformational and linear epitopes in RBD (He et al., , 2006a . As shown in Fig. 1 , all rRBD proteins expressed in mammalian 293T cells (RBD-293T), insect cells (RBD-Sf9) and E. coli (RBD-Ec) reacted with the majority (5 of 6) of the conformational epitope-specific mAbs and one linear epitopespecific mAb, having the strongest reaction with the Conf V mAb 33G4 and the linear mAb 17H9. These results suggest that the rRBD proteins expressed in mammalian cells, insect cells and E. coli maintain intact conformation and authentic antigenicity. The rRBD proteins expressed in 293T and Sf9 cells induced higher level of RBD-specific antibodies in vaccinated mice than that expressed in E. coli To evaluate humoral immune responses induced by the rRBD expressed in three different systems, mice were vaccinated with RBD-293T, RBD-Sf9 and RBD-Ec, respectively, and sera were tested by ELISA for RBD-specific IgG. As shown in Fig. 2A , all three rRBD proteins induced RBD-specific IgG antibody responses with increased antibody binding after each boost, reaching the highest level after the last boost. The mean end-point titer of antibodies in the sera, collected 10 days post-last boost, of the mice immunized with RBD-293T and RBD-Sf9 (1:3.3 × 10 6 ) were significantly higher than that in the sera of the mice vaccinated with RBD-Ec (1:4.1 × 10 5 ) (Fig. 2B ). There were no detectable RBD-specific antibodies in the pre-immune sera of the vaccinated mice or those from mice injected with PBS control (Fig. 2) . The above results suggest that rRBD proteins expressed in mammalian cells (293T) and insect cells (Sf9) are able to elicit stronger SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibody responses than that expressed in E. coli. All rRBD induced highly potent neutralizing antibody responses, albeit the neutralizing antibody titer elicited by RBD-293T was significantly higher than that induced by rRBD expressed in Sf9 and E. coli cells To assess whether the induced IgG antibody could neutralize infection of SARS-CoV in cell cultures in vitro, sera from 10 days postlast boost were detected by neutralization assays using pseudotyped and live SARS-CoV. As shown in Fig. 3A , sera from all three vaccination groups effectively neutralized infection of SARS pseudovirus in 293T cells expressing the receptor ACE2 (ACE2/293T). Particularly, RBD-293T protein induced a significantly higher titer of neutralizing antibody than the other two groups, with the mean 50% neutralizing antibody titer (NT 50 ) about 6.9 × 10 5 . The neutralization titer against live SARS-CoV infection in Vero E6 cells is also significantly higher in the RBD-293T vaccination group (mean NT 50 = 1.6 × 10 3 ) than in the RBD-Sf9 and RBD-Ec vaccination groups (Fig. 3B ), while no neutralizing activity was detected in the PBS control group (Fig. 3) . The above results suggest that the rRBD proteins expressed in mammalian, insect and E. coli cells are able to induce potent neutralizing antibody responses in the vaccinated mice.
