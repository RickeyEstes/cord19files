RT-PCR performed with primers specific for PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 mRNA showed that these genes are expressed in normal nasal mucosa of rat as well as in normal and allergic human nasal mucosa (Figs 1A, 1B and 2). Real-time PCR was conducted to evaluate the expression levels of PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 genes in total RNA isolated from nasal mucosa of both inferior turbinate of the human nasal cavity. Interestingly, these results revealed that these genes had asymmetric expression levels in nasal mucosa from both turbinates in normal control and allergic patients and showed that the expression levels of these genes were higher in decongested mucosa than congested mucosa, irrespective of GAPDH or EEF1A1 usage as housekeeping gene (Fig 1D and 1E ). Asymmetric expression levels of these genes were found in all subjects enrolled in the present study. PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 protein expression in the human nasal mucosa was confirmed by western blot (Fig 1C) . Expression of these proteins in all samples was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity of these genes was detected in normal and allergic human nasal mucosa, where PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 localized to the epithelial cells, submucosal glands, and vascular endothelium (Fig 2D) . We then evaluated the possibility that asymmetric expression levels of these genes may be related to the nasal cycles, particularly to congested or decongested phase evaluated by acoustic rhinometry. The expression levels of PER1(F = 25.7, P <0.05), PER2 (F = 6.6, P <0.05), CLOCK (F = 8.7, p<0.05), and BMAL1 (F = 10.8, p<0.05) genes were higher in decongested mucosa than in congested mucosa in normal controls and allergic patients (Fig 1D and 1E) . However, the levels of these clock genes expressed in decongested mucosa were not different between normal and allergic patients (Fig 1D and 1E) . Rat nasal mucosae obtained from both nasal cavity of rat showed also asymmetric expression in mRNA and protein levels of PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 (Fig 2A, 2B and 2C ). Rhythmic expression patterns for PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 genes were observed for two consecutive days in the nasal mucosa of rat (Fig 3) . Multiple peaks in PER1 mRNA levels in mucosa from the right nasal cavity appears at ZT3 and ZT12 (95% CI, cosinor, p<0.001) (Fig 3A) . Then PER1 mRNA levels decreased at ZT24 before increasing again at ZT30 (95% CI, cosinor, p<0.001). In contrast, PER1 mRNA level in mucosa from the left nasal cavity was low until ZT18. Thereafter, its levels rose, showing a double peak at ZT27 and ZT36 (95% CI, cosinor, p < 0.001) (Fig 4A) . PER2 mRNA levels in mucosa from the right nasal cavity peaked at ZT3 and ZT12 (95% CI, cosinor, p< 0.001) (Fig 3B) , demonstrating a double peak, and then declined between ZT21 and ZT27. Double peaks also were found on the 2 nd day at ZT33 and ZT39 (95% CI, cosinor, p<0.045) In mucosa from the left nasal cavity, PER2 mRNA level dynamics were opposite to those detected in right nasal cavity. CLOCK and BMAL1 mRNA levels in mucosa from the right and left nasal cavities showed peaks at ZT21 and ZT45 (95% CI, cosinor, p< 0.036), and then, their mucosal levels were reversed between both nasal mucosa, showing different expression levels between both nasal mucosa. The expression levels of PER1, PER2, and CLOCK genes were significantly different in mucosa from the right and left nasal cavities suggesting their asymmetrical expression levels in the two nasal cavities. However, although the mucosal expression levels of BMAL1 genes in the right and left nasal cavities were different during peak times, no statistical differences in BMAL1 expression were noted during the decreased circadian phase (Fig 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D ). These antiphase expression patterns between PER1/PER2 and CLOCK/BMAL1 suggest that there is a functional peripheral circadian core oscillator in the nasal mucosa of rat. Furthermore, immunohistochemical experiments also showed that the expression of protein products of these genes was found in the respiratory mucosa of rat nasal cavity. In contrast to their expression patterns in the human nasal mucosa, Rat PER1 and PER2 proteins were predominantly distributed in the superficial epithelial layer and submucosal glands, whereas rat CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins were mainly localized to the vascular endothelium (Fig 4) . To evaluate whether the expression levels of MUC5AC and aquaporin 5 genes may be associated with circadian expression levels of clock genes in human and rat nasal mucosa, real time PCR and western blots were performed. The results of these experiments showed that MUC5AC expression levels were higher in the decongested side in human nasal mucosa ( Fig  1A, 1B, 1D and 1E) and were subject to circadian rhythm in the rat nasal mucosa (Fig 3E) . In contrast, although aquaporin 5 gene levels showed circadian rhythms in rat nasal mucosa, but its levels were not different between the right and left nasal cavities during several circadian time points (Fig 3F) . Furthermore, aquaporin 5 levels were not different between congested and decongested sides in the human nasal mucosa. (Fig 1D and 1E ).
