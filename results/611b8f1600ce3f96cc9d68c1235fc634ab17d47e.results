In total, 534 veterinary hospitals responded to the survey and 237 of these reported CPV cases during the 2016 calendar year. Total annual rainfall reported for climatic quintiles varied considerably (301 mm to 2839 mm). Highest daily rainfall ranged from 21.4 mm to 263.6 mm, highest monthly rainfall ranged from 80.8 mm to 807.4 mm. Annual mean temperature ranged from 5.2°C to 28.9°C. Average maximum temperature for the hottest month (mean of daily maximums) ranged from 13.8°C to 39.7°C. Average minimum temperature for the coldest month (mean of daily minimums) ranged from -1.8°C to 4.0°C (Table 1 ). The remoteness area category, "Major Cities of Australia", had the highest and lowest SEIFA index scores, and the highest median across all indices. The mean rank SEIFA score for "Major Cities of Australia" was also significantly higher than all other categories across all indices. The lowest median SEIFA scores were for Outer Regional Australia (956, 936.5 and 928 for IRSD, IRSAD and IEO, respectively) and Remote Australia for IER (957). There was a moderate to high correlation between remoteness area codes and SEIFA index scores, the strongest being IRSAD (r SP =-0.6284, p < 0.0001), (Table 2) .
