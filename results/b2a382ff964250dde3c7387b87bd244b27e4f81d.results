Transcriptional analysis revealed that 283 out of 6,615 GO annotated genes were differentially expressed (DE, fold-change � 2.0) when compared between the HRSV and HRV groups. In the HRSV group most of the DE genes (204 genes) were hyper-expressed and only 79 genes were hypo-expressed when compared with the HRV group. The gene CCDC177 (C14orf162) presented the highest fold-change value (16.3) . Moreover, 22 genes were differentially expressed and presented high fold-change values between 16.3 and 4.0 (S1 Fig) . Table 2 lists these high fold-change DE genes, where 21 genes were hyper-expressed and one was hypoexpressed in HRSV group. The enrichment analysis of the DE genes, based on Biological Process (BP) terms of Gene Ontology database, showed that 99 DE genes (60 hyper-expressed and 39 hypo-expressed genes in the HRSV group in comparison with the HRV group) are significantly over- represented in BP terms. Twenty-one hyper-expressed genes are involved in immune response processes, such as inflammatory response, apoptosis, response to interferon-γ, and neutrophil chemotaxis. Thirteen hypo-expressed genes are also related to immune response, involving neutrophil degranulation, inflammatory response, apoptosis and phagocytosis (Fig 1; S1 and S2 Tables).
