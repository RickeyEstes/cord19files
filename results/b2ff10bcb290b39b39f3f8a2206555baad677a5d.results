Over a period 1 year, 162 children with ARIs were included in this study including 97 (59.9%) men. Overall, 30 children were under 6 months of age, 26 were 6 to 12 months old, 31 were 12 to 24 months old, 53 were 24 to 60 months old, and 23 were 60 to 112 months old. Table 1 shows the distribution of major viruses isolated during this study period, the frequency of single or coinfection, and the number of infections stratified by age group. Among selected virus species, adenovirus was the most prevalent (50%, n = 81), followed by influenza virus (45.68%, n = 74), rhinovirus (40.12%, n = 65), enterovirus (25.31%, n = 41), and RSV (16.05%, n = 26). Single infection with adenovirus was very rare (3.7%, n = 6). However, adenovirus was associated with other viruses and bacteria in 25.31% (n = 41) and 4.94% (n = 8), respectively. In addition, adenovirus/other viruses/bacteria coinfections have been detected in 16.05% (n = 26) of children. Influenza virus infections were associated with single-virus coinfections (33.3%, n = 54) or virus and bacteria coinfections (12.35%, n = 20). However, influenza virus single-infected children were not detected. Low prevalence of both rhinovirus and enterovirus single infections was observed (1.85%, n = 3). These infections were most often associated with single virus or virus and bacteria coinfections. Adenovirus, influenza virus, and enterovirus infections were more prevalent among children aged from 24 to 60 months. The prevalence of RSV infections associated with other viruses or other viruses and bacteria was 19.14% and 1.85%, respectively; however, no RSV single infection was detected. Children aged from 0 to 6 months were more likely to be more affected with rhinovirus and RSV infections. The distribution of major bacterial clinical strains is shown in Table 2 . Among isolated bacterial species, S. pneumoniae was the most prevalent bacteria (17%) followed by M. catarrhalis (15.43%) and H. influenzae (8.02%). Bacterial single infections were also very rare: S. pneumoniae (2%), M. catarrhalis (2%), and H. influenzae (1%). No bacteria/bacteria coinfections were detected. However, coinfections with bacteria and viruses had been observed in children having ARIs and coinfection with S. pneumoniae (16.66%) was most frequent followed by M. catarrhalis (14, 19%) and H. influenzae (4.32%). The contribution of viral and bacterial pathogens to the clinical syndrome is depicted in Tables 3 and 4 , respectively.
