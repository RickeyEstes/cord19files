CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f , LysM Cre + Ifnar f/f , and Ifnar 2/2 mice are vulnerable to WNV infection In vivo, WNV preferentially infects myeloid cells in peripheral tissues and neurons in the brain and spinal cord [23] [24] [25] . Given that DCs are targets of WNV infection, produce antiviral cytokines, and shape adaptive immunity, we hypothesized that type I IFN signaling in these cells orchestrates protection against WNV. To assess the role of type I IFN receptor signaling on DCs, we utilized CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice, in which IFNAR expression is markedly decreased on CD4 + and CD8a + DCs but maintained on other hematopoietic cells, including neutrophils, natural killer, T and B cells ( [26] and data not shown). Infection of Ifnar 2/2 mice with WNV resulted in 100% mortality with a mean survival time of 3 days, as reported previously [12] . Unexpectedly, infection of CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice resulted in essentially the same phenotype ( Fig. 1A) with no difference in the mean survival time compared to Ifnar 2/2 mice. Although WNV-infected Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice rapidly deteriorated, clinical signs of neuroinvasive disease including limb paralysis, seizures, ataxia, or sustained tremors were not apparent. Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice were more vulnerable to WNV infection than Cre 2 Ifnar f/f littermate controls or CD19 Cre + Ifnar f/f mice, which lack IFNAR expression only on B cells. The decreased expression of IFNAR on CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f cells was confirmed in mice following WNV infection (Fig. 1B) . Thus, the loss of IFNAR expression on CD11c + cells resulted in a clinical phenotype after WNV infection that was nearly identical to a deletion of IFNAR on all cells. When we repeated a subset of experiments with LysM Cre + Ifnar f/f mice, which delete IFNAR expression on MØ, monocytes, and granulocytes (data not shown), a similar rapid death phenotype was observed after WNV infection (Fig. 1A) , with a minimally longer survival time (mean of 3.5 days) compared to the Ifnar 2/2 or CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice. To determine whether the susceptibility phenotype of the CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice could be generalized to other arthropodborne viruses, we infected animals with chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an unrelated arthritogenic alphavirus (Fig. 1C) . CHIKV preferentially targets myoblasts, fibroblasts, and some MØ populations but is not reported to infect DCs [27] . As seen previously [28] , Ifnar 2/2 mice infected with CHIKV succumbed to infection within 4 to 5 days. In contrast, the CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f , LysM Cre + Ifnar f/f , or the Cre 2 Ifnar f/f littermate control mice failed to develop lethal CHIKV infection. Thus, selective deletion of IFNAR expression on CD11c + or other myeloid cells did not make mice vulnerable to other viruses, even if a complete gene deletion did; these results are consistent with studies with the coronavirus MHV, which showed a partial lethality phenotype in CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice [20] . We next assessed whether the loss of IFNAR expression on CD11c + cells impacted tissue viral burden to the same extent as that of Ifnar 2/2 mice. High titers (10 6 to 10 9 FFU/mg) of WNV were detected in the spleen, liver, lung, kidney, brain, and heart of Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice at 48 hours post infection ( Fig. 2A-F) . As expected, greater infection was observed in Ifnar 2/ 2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice compared to Cre 2 Ifnar f/f littermate controls. Similar trends in WNV infection were observed in the serum of Ifnar 2/2 , CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f , and LysM Cre + Ifnar f/f mice at 48 hours (Fig. 2G) . Flow cytometric analysis
