Between 1 January 2009 and 30 June 2016, 2,039 cases of mumps were reported in the Netherlands. A sequenced sample of the SH, HN, and F gene was available for 118 (5.8%) of the cases. Of the 118 cases with sequenced data, six had missing geographical data. Therefore, 112 (5.5%) cases were included in the analyses. These cases were mainly male (n = 65; 58.0%) and had a median age of 24 years (IQR: 20-27 years). In this study period, 14 mumps related signals were reported by the NEWC (Table 1) . Figures 1 to 4 represent output from our tool. The algorithm identifies 10 clusters with p < 0.001 of which five are nested (Figure 1 ). After collapsing the nested clusters into their parent clusters, five significant highest unnested clusters remain. Of those five highest unnested clusters clusters, cluster 2 (blue, n = 9), 3 (green, n = 12) and 4 (pink, n = 13) contain smaller clusters which are also significant, whereas cluster 1 (red, n = 3) and 5 (orange, n = 28) are not supported by other significant clusters at a lower nesting level. To assess the plausibility of the clusters for a specific disease, we focus on the variation within clusters across the time, geographical location or genetic dimension. The clusters show differences in how the cases and samples are distributed over time ( Figure  2a) , geographical location (Figure 2b) , and sequence space (Figure 2c ). Compared with clusters 4 and 5, cluster 1, 2 and 3 are very compact on all three dimensions (time, geographical location, and genetics). While cluster 4 is relatively concentrated in time and geographical location, it is distributed across two branches of the phylogenetic tree. For mumps this makes it less plausible that all cases belong to the same transmission chain, as the mumps virus is characterised by a very low mutation rate [39] . For each of the two clusters nested within cluster 4 in the hierarchical tree, cases are located on two branches of the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that also the nested clusters contain substantial genetic disparity. Cluster 5 is quite dispersed on all three dimensions (time, geographical location, and genetics), making this cluster very implausible. We estimate and visualise for every significant highest unnested cluster the pairwise dissimilarities per data dimension (Figure 3 ). We find that the median pairwise dissimilarity is significantly lower on the combined dimension in all clusters when compared with the combined pairwise dissimilarity in the unclustered cases. Of the five clusters, cluster 1 has the lowest median pairwise dissimilarities on the three individual dimensions and their combination and cluster 5 has the highest intra-cluster variance on the three individual dimensions and their combination. We visualise the intra-cluster Spearman rank correlation coefficient (r) of the pairwise dissimilarities between the different dimensions ( Figure 4) . When looking at the correlation coefficients between the data dimensions time, geographical location and genetics, we can see that many correlation coefficients either cannot be estimated due to zero variance (identical sequences) on the genetics dimension (cluster 1 and 2) or are not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Only in cluster 3 the time dimension is significantly correlated with the geographical location (r = 0.4) and genetics (r = 0.5) data dimension, and in cluster 4 and 5 the time dimension is correlated with the genetics dimension only (r = 0.3 and r = 0.2 respectively). When then looking at the contribution of the individual data dimensions to the combined dimension, we can see that in cluster 1, 2 and 3, the dimension of time and geographical location contribute equally and strongly to the combined dimension (r = {0.9, 0.6, 0.9}), and in cluster 4 and 5 the dimension of genetics contributes the most information to the combined dimension (r = {0.8, 0.7}). As a measure of validity, we have assessed whether mumps outbreaks described in the reports of the NEWC correspond to clusters identified with the timeplace-type algorithm. Clusters 1-4 are easily linkable to reported mumps outbreaks of the NEWC (Table 1) . Given its time, period, and the spatial distribution, cluster 1 corresponds to outbreaks 13 and 14, cluster 2 corresponds to outbreaks 11 and 12, cluster 3 corresponds to outbreak 8, and cluster 4 corresponds to outbreak 1. Cluster 5 is the only identified cluster to which no clear reported outbreaks can be linked. Outbreaks 3, 5, and 6 might together possibly compose cluster 5. In addition to the NEWC reports, clusters 2 and 3 are described in references [33] and [32] , respectively. Finally, analysis using time and geographical location data only (Supplement S2) shows that our visual plausibility tools can also be used when data are only available for two dimensions. The cases included in the main analysis are representative for the total notified mumps cases from 2013 onwards, as the shape of the epidemic curves is comparable. However, before 2013 the shapes of the epicurves differ: in the main analysis the large peaks in 2010, 2011 and 2012 cannot be observed. In 2013-16, we identify six clusters using only two dimensions that are similar to those identified using three dimensions, we miss only three minor clusters. In the period before 2013, nine additional clusters are identified in the time-place analysis, of which three are very large (n > 40). The lesser plausible pink (cluster 4) and orange (cluster 5) clusters from the main analysis fall in the less representative period before 2013, so it might be due to unrepresentative sequencing in this period that transmission cluster detection with this algorithm is more difficult.
