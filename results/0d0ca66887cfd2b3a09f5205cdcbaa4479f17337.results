In accordance with relevant GenBank data and based on the usability of sequences obtained by the dideoxy sequencing of the portion of S1 gene, the nucleotide sequence between the 763 and 1,129 positions was used for the ensuing phylogenetic analysis. Since the first submission of our collection had D1456 identification, we assigned this number to the group. The initial finding was that D1456-like strains formed a separate group within the Variant 2 IBV cluster, and grouped together with Ck/ Eg/BSU-2/2011 (JX174185) and Ck/Eg/BSU-3/2011 (JX174186) strains, which were reported to represent a new group of variant IBVs by Abdel-Moneim, Afifi, and El-Kady (2012). Throughout 2010-2015 altogether seventeen submissions yielded partial S1 sequences. Further Egyptian strains, accessed in GenBank, clustered together with this group, that is, Eg/1265B/2012 (KC533682), Eg/12197B/2012 (KC533683), and (Tamura et al. 2011) . Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA 5.1. The D1456/ 1/10 EG strain is marked by bold, and the sequences subjected to whole S1 gene sequences are shown in Italic.

The rest of the Egyptian sequences published by Abdel-Moneim, Afifi, and El-Kady (2012), fall into the group of Variant 2-like viruses, named IS/1494/06 group by Ganapathy, Ball and Forrester (2015) together with the Egypt/ Beni-Suef/01 strain. In order to have a more accurate depiction on the phylogenetic relationships of the studied viruses, isolates from different years were selected (D1456/1/10 EG, D1795/ 2/7/11 EG, D1887/2/3/12 EG, D1903/21/12 EG, D2572/2/2/14 EG, D1795/2/7/11 EG, D1887/2/3/12 EG, and D2930/3/1/1/15EG) and subjected to a broader scale S1 gene nucleotide sequence determination. The rather homogenous clustering, shown in Fig. 1 . however, was split in the near complete S1 gene phylogeny of selected representative strains, because (i), D1456-like viruses formed a group together with Variant 2-like viruses, represented by D1344/2/4/10 EG strain; and (ii), the strains separated: four of them (D1456/1/10 EG, D1903/21/12 EG, D2572/2/2/14 EG, and D2930/3/1/1/15 EG) belonged to a monophyletic group while the other two (D1795/2/7/11 EG, D1887/2/3/12 EG) sat on separate branches (Fig. 2) . The Neighbor-net analysis of the sequences and the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) test, carried out in the SplitsTree4 software (Huson and Bryant 2006) , indicated the possibility of recombination among the viruses, and further supported the separation of the D1456-like and the D1795-like viruses (demonstrated and further explained on Fig. 3) . The RDP analysis indicated recombination breaking points in each investigated Egyptian S1 sequences of our collection, and two patterns could be identified: one with a larger piece of recombined fragment of the S1 gene (166-600 nt), comprising of D1456/1/5/10EG, D1903/21/12EG, D2572/2/2/14EG, and D2930/3/2/ 15EG strains, and another one with a shorter fragment (335-556 nt), overlapping with the former and comprising of strains D1795/2/7/11EG and D1887/2/3/12EG (Fig. 4) . This separation of the recombinants into two groups was in agreement with the near complete S1 gene phylogeny demonstrated by both the traditional bifurcating and a network tree (Figs. 2 and 3) . In both cases, a fragment of D274 serotype S1 sequence was indicated as minor parent for the respective recombinant. As potential major parents, for the larger recombinant Figure 2 .

This probability of the described recombination events were further supported by the similarity plot analysis, carried out with the SimPlot software (Lole et al. 1999 ) (data not shown). Furthermore, two S1 sequences of GenBank origin, Eg/ 12197B/2012 (KC533683) and Eg/12120s/2012 (KC533684), showed the very same recombinant pattern as the D1456-like viruses and, accordingly, grouped together with these on the respective phylogenetic trees (Figs. 1 and 2) . The location of the larger recombinant fragment overlapped with two reported antigenic domains of the S1 gene, according to Koch et al. (1990) while the shorter recombinant fragment overlapped with one antigenic domain (Fig. 4) . Both recombinant fragments were located outside the portion that is flanked by the XCE primers.
