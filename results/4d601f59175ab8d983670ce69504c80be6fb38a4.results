Samples from a total of 4242 pediatric patients were analyzed over three years from July 2009 to June 2012 in Guangzhou, southern China. Male to female ratio of the patients was 1.92:1. Median age was 1.5 years (interquartile range, 0.67 to 3.00), with a range from one day to 14 years old, and with 3713/4242 (87.5%) patients being less than 5 years old. Pathogens were detected in 2361/4242 (55.7%) patients with a median age of 1.42 years (interquartile range, 0.67 to 3.0). Male to female ratio was 2.04:1 (p = 0.076) in the positive patients and 1.82:1 in the negative patients. The most frequently detected pathogens in this study were RSV (768/2361, 32.5%), infA (428/2361, 18.1%), EV (138/2361, 13.3%), MP (267/2361, 11.3%) and ADV (213/2361, 9.0%), followed by HMPV, infB, PIV3, HCoV-OC43, HBoV all with the detection rates higher than 5.0%. The positivity rates of the remaining seven pathogens were lower than 5.0% (Table 1) . Copathogens were common and found in 503 of 2361 (21.3%) positive-samples ( Table 1 ). The frequency of detection of the copathogens followed almost the same ranking order as that of the primary pathogens with the exception of HBoV, HCoV-OC43 and HMPV (Figure 1 ). In this study, patients were divided by age into seven groups. There was no difference in pathogen positivity rate (p = 0.338) and co-pathogen detection rate (p = 0.117) among the age groups. However, significant differences were found in age prevalence between infA, infB, RSV, EV, ADV, PIV2, PIV3, HBoV, HMPV, MP infections (p#0.009, Table 2 ). In general, four age/prevalence patterns could be distinguished among children in this study; A: Detection rates increased with age as illustrated in infA and infB ( Figure 2A) ; B: Detection rates declined with age, as shown in RSV ( Figure 2B ); C: The detection rates peaked at different ages as in EV (peak age 1-2 years, 10.9%), ADV (peak age 3-5 years, 9.0%), PIV2 (peak age 4-6 months, 2.8%), PIV3 (peak age 4-6 months, 6.1%), HBoV (peak age 7-12 months, 5.1%), HMPV (peak age 3-5 years, 5.5%) and MP (peak age 6-10 years, 20.1%) ( Figure 2C and 2D) and D: the number of samples was too small to analyze or no significant pattern was present (p.0.05), as in PIV1, PIV4, HCoV-OC43, 2229E, -NL63, -HKU1 and CP. In general, sample positivity rates increased when seasons changed as is shown in Figure 3 . In this study, RSV, infA, EV, MP and ADV formed the bulk of the positive sample ( Figure 3 ). In seasonal distribution, RSV and infA, PIV, and human coronavirus infection mainly occurred at the change from winter to spring and summer to autumn; MP and infB increased as RSV and infA declined, respectively. ADV mainly occurred in summer and autumn, although it was generally distributed all year round; HMPV occurred at the change of season from spring to summer and from winter to spring; EV and HBoV occurred mostly in summer and HBoV was prevalent in winter ( Figure 4 ). Few CP positive samples were found, and so a seasonal pattern could not be determined.
