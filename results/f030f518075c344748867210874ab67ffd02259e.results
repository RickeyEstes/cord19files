MtbWL induce the expansion of a protective subset of ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cells. Our published results demonstrate that human ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cells circulating among PBMCs obtained from PPD-positive individuals can expand and inhibit intracellular mycobacteria (35, 39, 42) . In contrast, we found that polycolonal ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cells expanded with IPP and other phosphoantigens were unable to inhibit intracellular mycobacteria (35) . Therefore, our recent screening strategy to reveal ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cell antigens focused on the identification of M. tuberculosis fractions that not only expand ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cells but also expand ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cells with the ability to inhibit intracellular mycobacteria. We first verified that expansion of protective ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cells did not require infection of host cells with viable mycobacteria by comparing the ability of MtbWL-expanded ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cells and live BCG-expanded ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cells to inhibit intracellular mycobacterial growth. Similar preparations of MtbWL-expanded and live BCGexpanded ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cells produced IFN-␥, TNF-␣, and granzyme A (GzmA) (Fig. 1A and B) . Importantly, MtbWL-expanded and live BCG-expanded ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cells displayed similar functional capacities to inhibit intracellular mycobacterial growth (Fig. 1C) . These results clearly demonstrate that MtbWL contains antigens capable of inducing the expansion of a protective subset of ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cells. Mycobacterial components stimulating inhibitory ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cells are protease resistant but sensitive to acid hydrolysis. Based on the above-described results, we initiated detailed biochemical work to further characterize the antigens from mycobacteria capable of inducing optimally protective TB-specific ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cells. We treated mycobacterial lysates in order to remove large classes of molecules. The initial biochemical treatments consisted of (i) reduction and alkylation to disrupt disulfide bonds, (ii) "delipidation" via organic extraction with chloroform-methanol (2:1) to remove nonpolar lipids, (iii) RNase and DNase treatment to degrade nucleotide polymers, (iv) base hydrolysis to cleave baselabile bonds, (v) mild acid hydrolysis to cleave acid labile bonds, (vi) pronase digestion to extensively degrade proteins, and (vii) trypsin digestion to more selectively cleave proteins as a complementary approach to pronase digestion ( Fig. 2A) . Disruption of disulfide bonds in the stimulatory antigens had no significant inhibitory effects on the induction of protective ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cells by MtbWL, suggesting that these structures are unimportant for biological activity. Delipidation also did not remove biological activity, indicating that the TB-specific ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cell inducing antigen does not consist primarily of nonpolar lipids. Nuclease treatment did not affect biological activity of the lysates, indicating that the biological activity does not require nucleotide polymers greater than 2 to 3 bp in length. However, nuclease treatment would not have eliminated the TUBag3 or TUBag4 nucleotide conjugates discussed previously. Protein digestion either with the promiscuous pronase or the more selective trypsin did not significantly alter the biological activity of the lysates, indicating that the antigen of interest is nonproteinaceous. Most proteinase digestions cleave proteins into peptides that are 10 to 20 amino acids long, which remain large enough to be loaded onto MHC molecules. Thus, two proteinases were used to increase the likelihood that MHC binding motifs would be cleaved by at least one treatment. Since no diminution of activity was detected with these proteinase treatments, we concluded that the antigen was not a protein or was so heavily modified (e.g., by glycosylation) that it was inaccessible for protein digestion. Although base hydrolysis should hydrolyze all ester, O-glycosyl, and phosphodiester bonds, including inactivation of the previously identified phosphoantigens (IPP, HMBPP, TUBAg1 to -4, etc.), this treatment had no effect on the biological activity capable of expanding inhibitory ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cells. However, mild acid hydrolysis completely eliminated the stimulatory capacity of mycobacterial lysates (Table 1 and Fig. 2B ). Although mild acid hydrolysis destroys several types of chemical bonds, it was the only treatment used which would be expected to hydrolyze complex carbohydrates, suggesting a role for them in the biological activity. These data are consistent with earlier studies demonstrating that ␥ 9 ␦ 2 T cell-stimulating antigens present in mycobacterial extracts were protease resistant and bound lectin (23, 25, 44, 45) .
