Vero cells can be co-infected with Chlamydia and ca-PEDV Immunofluorescence (IF) labeling was used to investigate the morphologic differences of Chlamydia between monoinfected and dually infected monolayers using Chlamydia and ca-PEDV specific antibodies. Control and mock-infected cells did not stain with either antibody. Ca-PEDV monoinfected cells showed brilliant and distinct, red cytoplasmic fluorescence. Syncytia were characterized by accumulation of nuclei in the center or the periphery of the multi-nucleated cells and moderate to bright, fine-granular, cytoplasmic ca-PEDV labeling (Figure 1b) . Syncytia were categorized into small (2-15 nuclei), medium (16-30 nuclei) and large (more than 30 nuclei). In single infection experiments, syncytia at 24 h post infection were mostly large with fewer medium sized syncytia observed (data not shown). Numbers of syncytia in ca-PEDV single and dual infections were counted on the whole coverslip and mean values were determined. No difference of viral syncytia numbers for ca-PEDV monoinfection and dual infection with Chlamydia abortus were seen (data not shown). In contrast, numbers of viral synyctia in dual infections with Chlamydia pecorum were diminished compared to the respective ca-PEDV single infections (Table 1) . IF microscopy of chlamydial single infections revealed intracytoplasmic, mainly round to ovoid, sharply outlined inclusions with brilliant, green fluorescence. Chlamydia abortus and Chlamydia pecorum infected cells had one to five, finely granular (consisting mainly of EBs) inclusion(s) per cell at 39 h post infection ( Figure   Figure 1 Morphology of Chlamydia pecorum mono-and coinfection with PEDV. a) Vero cells were infected with Chlamydia pecorum 1 MOI for 39 h, with subsequent PEDV inoculation and labelled with an anti-Chlamydia antibody (green); b) double infected monolayer were labelled for ca-PEDV in red, Chlamydia in green and DNA in blue; c) Chlamydia pecorum mono-infected Vero cells labelled with an anti-Chlamydia antibody (green) and DNA staining (blue); d) Inclusion size was measured as described and the frequency of chlamydial inclusions assembled into sizes of 50 Î¼m 2 area groups depicted. The difference between mono and double infected monolayers was statistically analyzed using students t-test. The groups were significantly different with p = 0.0044. 1c &2a). In general, chlamydial inclusions were smaller and had more variable forms in Chlamydia pecorum than in Chlamydia abortus single infections. Infectivity was almost 100% and a moderate number of free EBs could be observed.
