Production and characterisation of rPVL PVL has been produced recombinantly (rPVL) in E. coli and purified in one step on a GlcNAcagarose column with a final yield of 1 mg l -1 of culture. When assayed on rabbit erythrocytes, the lectin displayed strong hemagglutination activity down to concentration of 2.3 nM. The recombinant protein is stable and demonstrates a denaturation temperature of 56°C by thermal shift analysis (S2 Fig). Further stabilization of rPVL can be obtained in the presence of GlcNAc-containing ligands like GlcNAcβ1-3Gal or chitobiose, with a Tm of 60°C for both, but not in the presence of non-binding carbohydrate such as galactose and sucrose, confirming the GlcNAc binding activity.
