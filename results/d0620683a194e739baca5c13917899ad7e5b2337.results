Accuracy of the classification strategy using in-silicon data. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the two-steps classification strategy (sense mode), a query data set of 125 base pair (bp) reads was generated in-silicon. The viral reads were generated at different mutation rate ranging from 1% up to 40% from four known representative viruses which were Dengue Virus 2 (DENV-2, a single positive-standed RNA), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, a double stranded DNA), Norovirus (a genetically diverse group of single-stranded RNA) and H7N9 (segmented negative-sense RNA) using wgsim (https://github.com/lh3/wgsim). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 25 were generated to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the classification methods at different mutation rate in classifying viral reads. (Figure 2 and see Supplementary Information) Nearly all the results shared the superior 100% specificity. The specificity was slightly reduced (99.83%) when classifying the DENV-2 viral reads at 40% mutation rate. The sensitivity was reduced while the mutation rate was increased. Accurate virus identification, where sensitivity > 90%, was still achieved for with mutation rate at 20% using optimal parameters. Nevertheless, the overall poor performance in classifying the viral reads at high mutation rate (> 20%) required further investigations. Performance comparison between assembly software packages and assembly strategy in VIP. In this study, we also compared the de novo assembly performance for VIP, IDBA_UD 26 and recently described Ensemble Assembler 27 via using public datasets, in-house datasets and in-silicon dataset at mutation rate 3% with viruses which were DENV-2, EBV, Norovirus and H7N9. In-house Perl scripts were developed to calculate assembly metrics. The different assembly statistics calculated for each assembly results in order to assess the performance of each assembly are shown in Table 1 . This table describes the overall length and genome coverage estimators per assembly including the N50, percent of genome coverage of largest contig (%largest_con-tig_coverage) and percent of all contigs (%contig_coverage). In general, VIP prominently improved the N50 and obtained overall better outcomes (Table 1) . For example, in in-house dataset 1, N50 acquired by VIP is 6058, while Ensemble Assembler and IDBA_UD were 207 and 358 respectively. The same trends were also found for percent of genome coverage of largest contig and percent of all contigs coverage. Two datasets SRR453448 and SRR1106553 with IDBA_UD carried out slightly better results than VIP. The simulation data set was to evaluate the assembly performance and VIP demonstrated to build the
