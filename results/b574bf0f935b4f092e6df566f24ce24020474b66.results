A total of 589 samples were collected during the period from May 2017 to January 2019. Samples consisted of tracheal (5.3%) or cloacal (44.5%) swabs or a combination of both (50.2%); mean age at sampling was 35.7 D of age (doa). In 26 cases, respiratory and/or renal symptoms possibly due to IB were reported; in all the other cases, samples were taken for IBV routine monitoring. More than 70 different vaccination protocols against IBV were implemented, based solely on live attenuated vaccines and differing in applied vaccines and/or administration schedule. 83.4% of these were based on the combined administration of at least 2 IBV vaccines at 1 doa; 2 or more vaccines were administered at different time points in 9.7% of the cases, while 6.6% of the protocols relied on a single IBV vaccine. No IBV vaccination was performed in 2 cases. The most frequently adopted protocol was based on Mass (lineage GI-I) and 793B (lineage GI-13) vaccines administered at day 1 (225 out of 589 samples, 38.2%). Mass vaccines were implemented in 575 cases (97.6%), while 490 flocks were vaccinated with 793B ones (83.2%): in detail, vaccines based on 4/91, 1/96, and CR88 strains were applied 101 (17.1%), 352 (59.8%) and 37 (6.3%) times, respectively. Other adopted vaccines were based on variant 2, D274, and QX strains, and were implemented in 98 (16.6%), 57 (9.7%), and 9 (1.5%) farms respectively. A total of 501 samples (85%) tested positive for IBV, and 482 high-quality sequences were retrieved. The sequencing results are presented in Table 1 . 793B was the most frequently detected one (382 out of 482 sequences; 79.3%): 224 of the 793B sequences (58.6%) were identical or closely related (i.e., less than 1% genetic distance) to strain 4/91, 125 (32.7%) to strain 1/96 and 5 (1%) to strain CR88, while 28 strains (7.3%) were classified as 793B field strains. A total of 84 strains (17.4%) belonged to variant (lineage GI-23), while QX (GI-19), Mass (GI-I), and D274-like (GI-12) were identified in 9 (1.9%), 5 (1%), and 2 (0.4%) samples, respectively. The remaining 88 samples were negative, including the two samples taken from unvaccinated flocks. Among the different matrixes (tracheal and cloacal swabs or a combination of both), no significant differences in terms of frequency of the identified lineages were detected. When the correspondence between vaccination strategy and obtained sequence was evaluated, one of the Table 1 . Sequencing results characterized by lineage and vaccine or field origin. Strains were classified as vaccine strains, when genetically identical or closely related (p-distance < 0.01) to one of the applied vaccines, vaccine-derived strains, when genetically identical or closely related to a vaccine not administered in the respective flock, or field strains when not closely related (p-distance > 0.01) to any known vaccine. Considering only the 26 samples taken from symptomatic flocks, 5 of the detected strains (19.2%) were vaccines, 10 (38.4%) were classified as 4/91-like vaccinederived strains, and 11 (42.4%) were field ones. Among the field strains, 7 were variant 2, 3 793B, and 1 QX.
