The identification of alternative splicing variants for ELR1 The ELR1 cDNA was amplified from mRNA templates extracted from eMDMs by reverse-transcription PCR using primers designed based on the sequence published in GenBank. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed three bands migrating at approximately 1000 bp (Fig. 1A) , and subcloning of the amplified fragments further confirmed the existence of three ELR1 cDNA fragments with different molecular masses (Fig. 1B) . Nucleotide sequencing revealed two other species of ELR1: one containing an insertion of a 153 nucleotide (nt) fragment of intron 6 (ELR1-IN) and another with a deletion of 109 nt (ELR1-DE). To avoid the contamination of introns of chromosomal DNA, the ELR1-IN mRNA samples were pre-treated with DNase to remove any contaminating chromosomal DNA and then PCR amplified with a pair of primers, one of which targeted the insert. The 125 bp ELR1 cDNA fragment was amplified from both mRNA samples with or without DNase pre-treatment, indicating that ELR1-IN originated from the mRNA. As a control, we confirmed that a 501 bp fragment from intron 3 of the equine MHC-I gene was amplified from the DNA preparation without DNase treatment but not a preparation that was pre-incubated with the nuclease (Data not shown). In addition, to exclude the possible artificial effect resulting in the ELR1-IN molecule during reverse transcription and PCR amplification, the presence of ELR1-IN mRNA was further measured by a bDNA assay, which detects specific mRNA species directly from total RNA preparations by hybridizing with signalamplified probes specific for the inserted sequence without being revers transcribed and amplified. As shown in Fig. 1C , the average light unit of ELR1-IN mRNA was 1,594 while that of the blank control was 53.5.
