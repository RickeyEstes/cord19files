Sample information. On February 25 th , 2017, during the fifth IAV(H7N9) epidemic, from a LPM of Foshan City in the Guangdong province of China, we collected a total of 200 tracheal swab samples from 50 chickens, 50 ducks, 50 geese and 50 pigeons. These birds showed no significant clinical signs. After real time RT-PCR, 2 samples were found to be H7 HA gene positive. These two swab samples were collected from chickens kept in separate cages and sold by different vendors that showed no significant clinical signs. The two strains were named A/Chicken/Guangdong/J1/2017(H7N9) and A/Chicken/Guangdong/J2/2017(H7N9) (abbreviated as CK/J1 and CK/J2, respectively). Accession numbers KY855515-KY855530 of these two strains were obtained after whole genome sequences were submitted to NCBI GenBank. Viral Proteins and Molecular Characteristics of the Two Novel AIVs. The molecular signatures of CK/J1 and CK/J2 associated with host adaptation, receptor specificity, and potential pathogenesis and antiviral resistance were assessed, and compared with three recently described HP human IAV(H7N9) isolates, including A/Guangdong/17SF006/2017(H7N9), A/Qingyuan/GIRD1/2017(H7N9) and A/Taiwan/1/2017(H7N9), abbreviated as GD/17SF006, QY/GIRD1 and TW/1, respectively, with amino acid insertion in the HA cleavage site (Table 1) . Q226L/I and G228S substitutions in the HA protein, which are the two main mutations contributing to the high-affinity binding of viruses to human receptors, were not identified in the two novel AIVs. However, several substitutions that may increase the binding ability of the viruses to the human Î±-2,6-linked sialic acid receptor in HA were detected, namely S138A, T160A, and G186V. NS1 E172K, which induces viral replication in mammalian cells, was found in both chicken and human influenza viruses 12 . Virulence-related signatures P42S and D92E substitutions in the NS1 protein, were also identified. M2 S31N, which confers resistance to amantadine and rimantadine, was found in all these viruses. However, mutations of the NA protein that may cause Oseltamivir resistance, such as E119V and I222L, were not detected in these viruses. Different from human strains, the two AIVs found in this study still harbored known avian influenza virus signatures, e.g. the PB2 E627K mutation was found in 3 human strains, but not in CK/J1 and CK/J2. Meanwhile, PA K356R did not occur in CK/J1 but harbored by the CK/J2 and 3 human viruses (Table 1) . Additional Amino Acid Insertion in HA Cleavage Sites of the Two Novel AIVs. In the first four epidemic waves (from Mar 2013 to Oct 2016), all reported viruses had the low pathogenic cleavage site in the amino acid sequence PEIPKG/GLF of the HA proteins (Fig. 1a) . However, during the fifth wave, 5 human IAV(H7N9) strains isolated in Guangdong, A/Qingyuan/GIRD1/2017, A/Guangdong/SP440/2017, A/Guangdong/ HP001/017, A/Guangdong/17SF003/2017 and A/Guangdong/17SF006/2017 (or QY/GIRD1, GD/SP440, GD/ HP001, GD/17SF003 and GD/17SF006, respectively) had an insertion of 3 basic amino acid residues (RKR) in the cleavage site connecting the HA1 and HA2 peptide regions, carrying the PEVPKRKRTAR/GLF sequence, which is a signature of HPAI viruses 8 . The two novel AIVs CK/J1 and CK/J2 also had similar insertions in the cleavage site of HA protein, but they slightly differed from the human strain signature. The chicken viruses carried the PEVPKGKRTAR/GLF sequence with only 2 basic amino acid residues inserted (KR) (Fig. 1a) . Such amino acid mutations corresponded to nucleotide changes. Specifically, 12 additional nucleotides (AACGGACTGCGA) were found in CK/J1, CK/J2 and the 5 new human isolates, but not in the first 4 epidemics (W1 to W4) strains (Fig. 1b) . A nucleic acid mutation G1012A (H7 numbering) was also found in the human strains, but not in CK/ J1, CK/J2 and other H7 viruses with the LP cleavage site (Fig. 1b) . The HA sequence peak map on the cleavage site regions of CK/J1 and CK/J2 showed a single peak for each nucleotide, which indicates that sequencing results are trustworthy (Fig. 1c) . This was the first demonstration of such a molecular sequence-signature characteristic in chicken IAV(H7N9) viruses since their emergence in 2013, according to the alignment of viral HA sequences available in the GISAID database. Figures S1-S4) . Two glycoprotein genes, HA and NA, of the novel AIVs (CK/J1 and CK/J2) and human strains recently found in Guangdong province, all belong to the PRD lineage. As for genetic relationship, these viruses closely related to W3 strains (Fig. 2 , Supplementary  Figures S2 and S3) . The polymerase tripartite genes (PB2, PB1 and PA) of CK/J1 and CK/J2 were derived from the YRD clade, and close to W3 and W4 viruses. Similar with the two chicken viruses, PB2 of the five Guangdong human isolates also originated from the YRD clade in W3 to W4. However, PA genes of the 5 human strains and PB1 of GD/SP440, GD/HP001 and GD/17SF003 were located in the PRD W3-like lineage, while QY/GIRD1 and GD/17SF006 were located in the OR clade W3-like branch (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 ). NP genes of the two avian and five human strains were closely related to W3 to W5 strains. Except QY/GIRD1 and GD/17SF006 strains, which derived from PRD, the NP genes of other 5 strains originated from the YRD clade (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figure S3 ). The M and NS genes of all 7 viruses derived from the YRD clade. The M genes of avian and human strains had close genetic relationship with W3 to W4 viruses (Fig. 2, Supplementary  Figure S4 ). Although all NS genes originated from the YRD clade, they derived from different epidemic periods. CK/J1 was genetically closely related to the W3 viruses, and CK/J2 to the W1 to W2 strains. NS genes of the 5 human viruses were from W4 strains. As a common ancestor of IAV(H7N9) virus, all segment genes of A/ Shanghai/1/2013(H7N9) (termed as SH/1) derived from the YRD clade. From the phylogenetic trees, polymerase tripartite and NS genes were close to avian strains instead of human ones ( (Figs 3D and 4D) . The Clade I-B was estimated to start around June 2012 Together with the results of molecular clock analysis of HA and NA genes of the novel HP IAV(H7N9), we further confirmed that the avian HP strains appeared months earlier than those human strains during the evolution process.
