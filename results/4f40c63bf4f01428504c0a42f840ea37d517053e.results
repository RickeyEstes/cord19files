From November 1993 to September 1995, 18 of the 33 veterinarians submitted samples from at least two herds (range 2±7). Altogether, 218 faecal samples from diarrheic dairy calves in 65 herds were submitted. Herd sizes ranged from 12 to 650 cows (median 49 cows). Of 218 calves, 64, 57, 68 and 29 calves were 1±7, 8±14, 15±21 and 22±30-days old, respectively. The mean age of the studied calves was 13.3 days (median 12 days). Cryptosporidium infection was detected in 43.8%, 71.9%, 63.2% and 6.9% of the calves in the age groups 1±7, 8±14, 15±21 and 22±30 days, respectively ( Table 1 ). The risk for Cryptosporidium infection in the age group 22±30 days was significantly lower in comparison with age group 1±7 days (OR 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02±0.43; p < 0.001; Table 1), with age group 8±14 days (OR 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01±0.14; p < 0.0001), and with age group 15±21 days (OR 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01±0.20; p < 0.0001). The risk for Cryptosporidium infection in the age group 1±7 days was also significantly lower in comparison with age group 8±14 days (OR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14±0.65; p < 0.01) and with age group 15±21 days (OR 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23±0.91; p < 0.05). The mean age of the Cryptosporidium-infected calves was 11.8 days (range 2±30 days). Only Cryptosporidium was detected in 60 of the 114 (52.6%) diarrheic calves. Concomitant infections with other enteropathogen(s) were detected in 64.3%, 46.3%, 39.5% and 0% of the Cryptosporidium infected calves in the age groups 1±7, 8±14, 15±21 and 22±30 days, respectively (Table 2) . A significant age-associated decrease in the detection rate of mixed infections (p < 0.05) was found. The detection rates of the other (Table 2) . Thus, the combination Cryptosporidium-rotavirus was found in all but seven of the calves with mixed infection, and in 14 of the 47 calves with Cryptosporidium±rotavirus infection at least one of the other agents was also detected ( Table 2) .
