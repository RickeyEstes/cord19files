Syngeneic GVHD. Lethally irradiated Lewis rats were reconstituted with syngeneic bone marrow and treated with control diluent or CsA. Syngeneic radiation chimeras not treated with CsA as a rule did not develop clinical or histological GVHD. In seven independent syngeneic transplants only 1 of 64 chimeras not treated with CsA developed GVHD. At autopsy this rat had intense sialodacroadenitis suggestive of an underlying coronavirus infection. In contrast 68 of 97 rats reconstituted with syngeneic marrow and treated with CsA at 7.5-40 mg/kg per day for 20-40 d developed clinical and histological GVHD (P < 0.001) ( Table  I) . GVHD was not seen while the rats were receiving CsA. Erythematous ears, dermatitis, hair loss, diarrhea, and weight loss were observed in most rats 12-40 d after the CsA was stopped. Characteristic histological lesions of GVHD were seen in the skin, tongue, esophagus, and liver ( Fig. 1-4) . Pronounced lymphoid atrophy of the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes was observed in syngeneic chimeras that developed GVHD after a 20-d course of CsA. Lymphoid atrophy was less striking in rats which developed GVHD after 40 d of post-transplant CsA treatment. Large numbers of lymphoblasts were observed in the lymph nodes of these rats at day 55. Autologous GVHD. It might be argued that CsA merely amplifies a GVHD response due to subtle genetic differences between "syngeneic rats". To test this hypothesis Lewis rats were irradiated with 1,020 rad, shielding the right tibia with a lead doughnut. Four out of four leg-shielded CsA-treated rats developed clinical and histological acute GVHD. We have observed no GVHD in seven untreated leg-shielded rats (Table II) . Adoptive Transfer of Syngeneic and Autologous GVHD. Table III shows the results of four independent adoptive transfer experiments. Syngeneic GVHD may be adoptively transferred with spleen cells and marrow to lethally irradiated syngeneic recipients. Unirradiated rats are resistant to the adoptive transfer of syngeneic GVHD. Preliminary results suggest that both syngeneic and autologous GVHD is mediated by T cells. The adoptive transfer of both syngeneic and autologous GVHD was prevented by treating the spleen cells with a potent rabbit anti-rat thymocyte serum (9) and guinea pig complement. Complement alone did not interfere with the adoptive transfer of the GVHD. Normal rats are refractory to the adoptive transfer of syngeneic GVHD and normal untransplanted rats do not develop GVHD after CsA withdrawal (data not shown). These results suggest that normal rats possess active tolerance-maintaining mechanisms that prevent the development of autologous GVHD and the transfer of established syngeneic GVHD. Table IV shows the results of an adoptive transfer experiment in which lethally irradiated Lewis rats were transplanted with Lewis marrow and syngeneic spleen cells from rats with GVHD. One group Lewis rats were irradiated (1,020 rad) with shielding of the right tibia. CsA-treated rats received 10 mg/kg/d for 18 d. (P < 0.005). Lethally irradiated Lewis rats were transplanted with 6 x 10 7 Lewis marrow cells and l0 s Lewis spleen cells from rats with syngeneic GVHD. l0 s normal Lewis spleen cells were also given to some rats as indicated above. Lewis rats were lethally irradiated and treated with CsA or control diluent from day 0 to day 40. The rats were transplanted with 6 x 107 syngeneic Lewis marrow cells and 10 s spleen cells as indicated above.
