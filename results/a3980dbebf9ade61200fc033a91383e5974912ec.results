Assay-performance. The performance of the four test protocols was based on the number of proteins identified in each protocol as well as by the presence of marker proteins that are known to be expressed by cells of the upper respiratory tract. Of the four protocols, Protocol B -in which proteins were extracted from the patient samples using a commercial Protein/DNA/RNA extraction kit, followed by label free quantification -resulted in the highest number of protein identifications ( Fig. 2A) while protocol A -where samples were lysed with urea and then reduced, alkylated and digested, followed by label-free quantification -resulted in the lowest number of protein identifications. Protocol C, which comprised two sub-protocols, distinguished by the elution gradient, resulted in an intermediate number of identifications, although, Protocol Cii -where proteins were extracted using the commercial extraction kit, peptides labelled with TMT tags and subsequently eluted on a 310-minute gradient -yielded a substantial increase in protein identifications over protocol Ci. Of the three protocols that yielded the highest number of protein identifications (protocols B, Ci & Cii) there was a substantial overlap in the identity of proteins detected by the three methods as shown in Fig. 2B . Further analysis of assay stability and reproducibility was restricted to samples from protocol Cii, which was deemed to be the most practical for routine application due to its capacity for multiplexing and superior performance in protein identification compared to protocol Ci. The inter-batch correlation of the total proteome of the pooled control sample was carried out by calculating pairwise Pearson's correlation coefficients between batches. As shown in Fig. 3a , there was a high degree of correlation between batches, with a median Pearson's R value of 0.85 (Fig. 3b) . A random selection of 4 proteins (ACAT2, GCC1, RPL5 & DSP) whose median expression levels were spread out across the entire dynamic range of protocol Cii, showed that the expression levels of these proteins remained relatively stable across all experimental batches (Fig. 3c) . Cell-specific marker protein analysis. In order to further characterise the proteomes identified in protocol Cii, the expression of signature proteins that are typically expressed by upper-airway cells was assessed. High expression levels of the signature nasopharyngeal proteins BPIFA1 and BPIFA2 was noted (Fig. 4a) . The coefficients of variation for these proteins as well as other proteins in the pooled control was less than 20% (Fig. 4b) . In addition, mucins -MUC5 and MUC1 -major components of the mucinous secretions that ubiquitously coat mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract, were expressed at high levels in the nasopharyngeal secretions of all infants in the study (Fig. 4a & 4d) . The two most highly expressed proteins in the naso-oro-pharyngeal proteome were the signature mucosal epithelia keratins, keratin 13 (KRT13) and keratin 4 (KRT4) - Fig. 4d . In addition to these nasopharyngeal marker proteins, we also noted high expression levels of definitive oral/salivary proteins such as salivary amylase in all samples that were analysed - Fig. 4d . Other proteins such as the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR), a protein that mediates active trans-cytosis of secretory immunoglobulins onto the luminal surface of the respiratory tract -were expressed at high levels in all patient samples analysed - Fig. 4d .
