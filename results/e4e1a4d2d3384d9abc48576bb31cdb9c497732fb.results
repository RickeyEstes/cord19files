Bacterial, viral, protozoan, and parasitic agents that cause diarrhea, except for Salmonella spp. and both coronaviruses, were detected in varying proportions in the 184 examined animals ( Table 2) . When individuals were clustered into 88 groups (case, n = 43; control, n = 45), statistically significant differences were found only for protozoans (Table 3) . Animals positive for bacterial and viral agents were equally distributed between case and control groups (p > 0.05) as shown in Table 3 . Co-infections were analyzed, and a statistically significant difference between groups was found only for C. perfringens Î²2 and C. suis co-infection (p = 0.014).
