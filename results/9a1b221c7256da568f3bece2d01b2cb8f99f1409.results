Small intestines or fecal samples from pigs with current or previous evidence of gastrointestinal disease (with or without diarrhea) are routinely examined by light microscopy for RV-like lesions and tested for RVA, RVC, and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) by RT-PCR at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Initially, one sample revealed RV-like lesions including villus atrophy, fusion, and necrosis by light microscopic but was negative for RVA and RVC by RT-PCR. Electron microscopy confirmed the presences of RV-like particles. The sample was found positive using an RT-PCR specially designed to detect the VP7 of RVB, and sequencing of the VP7 revealed a genetic identity of approximately 70% to bovine RVB strains, since porcine VP7 sequences were unavailable in GenBank at that time (August 2009). Subsequently, 173 samples from pigs of all ages and residing in 119 different sites across the United States were retested for RVB by RT-PCR. Of the 173 samples, 156 samples (90.2%) were positive for RVA, RVB, and/or RVC while 17 samples (9.8%) were negative for RVs (Fig. 2) . RVA and RVC were found in 110 samples (63.6%) and 100 samples (57.8%), respectively. RVB was found in 81 samples (46.8%). The majority (70 of 81) of RVB positive intestines were simultaneously positive for either RVA or RVC. Among all of the pathogens tested, only RVB was identified in the intestinal samples from nine pigs. These nine pig samples had typical RV lesions, such as those in Fig. 1 , and were confirmed to contain RV particles by electron microscopy, and were negative for RVA and RVC by RT-PCR. Three of the 173 samples (1.7%) were positive for TGEV. Of these three samples, one sample was also found to be positive for RVA. In an attempt to estimate prevalence of RV detection by age of pig, the samples were divided by age groups as follows: o21, 21-55, and 455 days (Fig. 2) . The highest percentage of RVB positive samples was observed in the 455 days age group (72.7%), followed by the 21-55 days age group (64.2%), and the o21 days age group (18.6%). The highest percentage of RVB-only positives were seen in the o21 days age group (12.9%), followed by the 21-55 days age group (2.5%). RVB only positive samples were absent in the 455 days age group. The highest percentage of RVB strains found in a mixed infection with either RVA or RVC was in the 455 days age group with RVA (27.3%). The highest percentage of a RVB mixed infection with RVA and RVC was present in the 455 days age group (45.5%). Porcine enteric pathogens S. enterica spp., Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile and C. perfringens, coccidia, Lawsonia intracellularis and weakly hemolytic Brachyspira species were detected in different age groups; however, the correlations between these pathogens and RV infections were outside the scope of this study. We attempted to determine the complete RVB VP7 ORF from all 81 positive samples; however, 13 of the 81 samples contained more than one RVB strain, which resulted in the inability to generate an accurate full ORF sequence of the VP7 gene. Therefore, the VP7 of only 68 RVB strains identified in 51 different sites was successfully determined. Table 1 lists each of the 68 RVB strain names, clinical signs of diarrhea or lack thereof, RVA, RVC, and TGEV results, the age of the host, G genotype, state of origin, site and GenBank accession number. Of the 68 sequenced positive RVB samples, 36 had clinical signs of diarrhea, whereas in six samples, the presence of diarrhea was unknown. Single RVB G genotypes were detected in 47 sites while two G genotypes were found to co-circulate in four sites (G8/G16, G12/G16, G12/G17, and G12/G18). Using the 57 VP7 ORF nucleotide sequences of RVB available from GenBank, together with the 68 new VP7 sequences of RVB strains from this study, a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3 ) was constructed and a nucleotide sequence based pairwise identity frequency graph was generated (Fig. 4) . In the pairwise identity frequency graph, the typical pattern of clearly resolved peaks is apparent. The use of a 68% cut-off value resulted in 5 distinct clades in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3 , left dashed line), with a limited overlap between the inter-(red) and intra-cluster (orange and green) identities (Fig. 4) . Four of these clades contained RVB strains from only one host species (murine, human and two clusters of porcine RVB), while clade 3 contained both bovine and porcine RVB strains (Fig. 3) . A second suitable cut-off value of 80% resulted in the identification of 20 G genotypes (Fig. 3 , the right dashed line) in the phylogenetic tree, with a very limited overlap between inter-(red and orange) and intra-genotype (green) identities (Fig. 4) . These 20 different genotypes contained RVB isolated from a single host species (G1: murine, G2: human, G3 and G5: bovine, and G4, G6-G20: porcine) (Fig. 3) . Table 2 show the nucleotide and amino acid identity ranges among RVB strains belonging to the same G genotype. As could be expected the nucleotide identity ranges were above the determined 80% cut-off value for the majority of the genotypes. Only the range among RVB strains belonging to the G12 genotype extended slightly below 80%. Alignment of the deduced amino acid VP7 sequences from the 20 genotypes is shown in Fig. 5 . Six conserved cysteine residues (29, 84, 108, 137, 148, and 189) were present in the selected representative RVB strains, suggesting that these may be important to the folding, stability, and function of the VP7 protein. An additional cysteine residue was present at residue 13 of genotypes G3-G5 and G11-G20. RVB VP7 sequences contained 1-4 potential N-linked glycosylation sites: a conserved site at residues 47-49, and additional sites including residues 64-66, 107-109, and 242-245 for genotypes G11-G20. Putative signal cleavage sites were located at residues 15-16 (Ala and Gln, respectively) and were conserved except for G1 (IDIR) and G8. The VP7 amino acid sequences for the 125 RVB strains (grouped by genotype) used in the phylogenetic analysis are presented in Fig. 6 . The data show that the genetic diversity (both conserved and highly variable amino acid positions) across the VP7 amino acid sequence was evenly distributed with an apparent slightly higher level of conservation in the region at the C-terminal.
