Between Aug 15, 2011, and Jan 30, 2014, we enrolled 4232 (73·9%) of 5723 eligible children with severe or very severe pneumonia as cases and 5119 (56·9%) of 8994 eligible children in the study catchment areas contacted as community controls; an additional 206 con trols with HIV infection were enrolled from HIV clinics in South Africa and Zambia for HIVspecific analyses to be reported separately (figure 1). Enrolment of cases and controls varied by season (appendix). Approximately 90% of the planned specimens (ranging from 88·8% for in table 2, table 3 , and the appendix. Cases were unevenly distributed across the seven sites; of all cases with a positive chest xray (1769), Thailand made up the lowest percentage (5·5%), whereas South Africa made up the highest (24·6%; appendix) of the seven countries. For every site except Thailand, more than 75% of cases with a positive xray were younger than 24 months, with the majority being younger than 12 months (appendix). Controls were older than cases in The Gambia, Mali, South Africa, and Dhaka (Bangladesh) sites (p<0·020; appendix). The proportion of cases with very severe pneumonia was lowest in Bangladesh and The Gambia and highest in Mali and Kenya (p<0·0001; table 2, 3, appendix). 30day case fatality ratio of cases with a positive xray was 6·4% (114 of 1769 cases), which varied markedly by site (p<0·0001) and was higher in cases with very severe pneumonia (13·3% of 519 very severe cases without HIV infection and with a positive xray; range by site 3·7-28·2%) than in cases with severe pneumonia (3·6% of 1250 severe cases without HIV infection and with a positive xray; range by site 0·5-9·7%; appendix). Clinical characteristics at admission of cases with a positive chest xray varied substantially by site (tables 2, 3, appendix), particularly for wheezing (range by site 10·6-97·3%), fever (9·7-58·9%), hypoxaemia (10·0-75·8%), and oxygen administration (5·5-90·1%; p<0·0001 for all). It should be noted that the South African site, at an altitude of 1600 m above sea level, had a standard clinical practice to administer supplemental oxygen at admission and often before recording oxygen saturation for all children admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of severe pneumonia. Additionally, Mali oxygen administration data were excluded from analysis because of inadequate standardisation of data recording. Tachypnoea was commonly observed at all sites (85·3% of cases). Malnutrition, defined as WHO weightforage Z score 37 lower than -2, was found in 39·7% of cases with a positive xray and without HIV infection, with significant variability by site (p<0·0001 for all); malnutrition was more common in cases than in controls at all sites (appendix). The prevalence of any , and South Africa (April, 2009); PCV was introduced in Zambia in July, 2013 (Lusaka), 3 months before the end of study enrolment. Duration of illness was defined as duration (in days) of cough, wheeze, fever, or difficulty breathing, whichever was longest. Tachypnoea was defined as 60 or more breaths per min (<2 months), 50 or more breaths per min (2-11 months), and 40 or more breaths per min (12-59 months). Hypoxaemia was defined as oxygen saturation lower than 92% (or <90% for sites at elevation above 1200 m: Zambia and South Africa), or supplemental oxygen use if a room air oxygen saturation reading was not available; a room air oxygen saturation reading was available for 3514 (88·3%) children; the South African site, at an altitude of 1600 m above sea level, had a standard clinical practice to administer supplemental oxygen for all children admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of severe pneumonia. Elevated white blood cell (WBC) count was defined as greater than 15 × 109 cells per L for children aged 1-11 months and greater than 13 × 109 cells per L for children aged 12-59 months. CRP=C-reactive protein. *Restricted to endemic sites (Kenya, Gambia, Mali, and Zambia). †For children younger than 1 year, full vaccination was defined as having received at least one dose and being up to date for age on the basis of the child's age at enrolment, doses received, and country schedule (allowing a 4-week window for each dose); for children aged 1 year or older, full vaccination was defined as having received three or more doses. ‡For children younger than 1 year, full vaccination was defined as having received at least one dose and being up to date for age on the basis of the child's age at enrolment, doses received, and country schedule (allowing a 4-week window for each dose); for children aged 1 year or older in all sites except Kenya, full vaccination was defined as having received three or more doses; for children older than 1 year in Kenya (which introduced PCV with catch-up campaign), full vaccination was defined as having received three or more doses, two doses if given at least 8 weeks apart and the child was older than 1 year of age at first dose, and one dose if the child was older than 2 years at any dose or at introduction. §Data restricted to those age-eligible; at least one dose was restricted to children older than 10 months (>10·5 months in Bangladesh). ¶Restricted to children aged 6 months or older. ||Defined as serum bioassay positive (cases and controls), antibiotics administered at the referral facility, or antibiotic administration before the collection of whole blood specimens at the study facility (cases only); restricted to children with blood culture (cases only) or whole blood (cases or controls) collected. **Data was recorded in the Mali site on the basis of time at presentation, not time at admission, as was done at all other sites; Mali is excluded from the all site summary. † †13·7% of cases with a blood culture collected were missing blood culture volume data. 29 ‡ ‡Restricted to children discharged alive who had vital status data obtained 21 days or longer after admission. Previous exposure to antibiotics varied by site and case or control status, as did coverage with vaccines against pertussis, Hib, S pneumoniae, and measles (appendix; p<0·050 for all). Enrolment of cases varied by season at all sites, except in Mali and Zambia (appendix). Blood cultures were positive for a pathogen in 56 (3·2%) of 1749 cases with positive chest xrays and available blood cultures (percentage range by site 1·0-5·0%; figure 2, appendix). Isolation rates did not vary significantly by age strata (p=0·21), but did vary by case severity (p=0·014) and were 45% lower among cases with previous antibiotic exposure or with blood volume lower than 1·0 mL (appendix). 28 The bacterial species most commonly isolated from blood cultures was S pneumoniae (19 [34%] of 56 positive blood cultures); however, no pneumococcal isolates were cultured from sites in South Africa, Thailand, or Bangladesh. Although not part of the core methods, South Africa had two blood cultures that were flagged as positive and tested positive for pneumococcal antigen, but were negative for pneumococcal culture (appendix). M tuberculosis was cultured from 24 (1·5%) of 1571 cases with positive xrays (23 from induced sputum and one from gastric aspirate; appendix). 11 (29%) of 37 lung aspirates and 12 (80%) of 15 pleural fluid speci mens tested by culture, PCR, or both were positive for a pathogen; bacterial pathogens (most often S pneumoniae [lung aspirate] and S aureus [pleural fluid]) were more commonly detected (in 23 cases) than viral pathogens (three cases), and all viral pathogens were codetected with bacteria (table 4, appendix). Multiple pathogens were observed in six (55%) of 11 lung aspirates that yielded at least one pathogen by culture or PCR. None of the ten cases with positive chest xrays who met the clinical screening definition for measles testing were positive for measles (appendix S pneumoniae was more commonly detected in controls (3846 [77·2%] of 4984) than in cases with a positive chest xray (p=0·0001). After applying PCR density thresholds that best distinguished cases from controls, 24,25 the proportion of positive results in cases with a positive xray changed for S pneumoniae (from 72·8% to 13·5%), H influenzae (from 57·8% to 29·5%), P jirovecii (from 8·9% to 4·3%), and cytomegalo virus (from 51·2% to 22·7%). This changed the rank order of most commonly detected bacteria in the NPOP specimens to M catarrhalis, H influenzae, S aureus, and S pneumoniae (appendix). Compared with controls, having a positive chest xray in cases was significantly associated with the presence of 15 different pathogens in NPOP specimens (figure 3). The adjusted ORs for NPOP PCR results ranged widely across pathogens, with RSV (OR 14·0, 95% CI 11·4-17·1), parainfluenza 1 (7·7, 4·6-13·0), and human meta pneumovirus A or B (6·3, 4·8-8·2) having the highest adjusted ORs, followed by influenza A (3·6, 2·4-5·3) and Bordetella pertussis (3·3, 1·6-7·2); parainfluenza 1, influenza A, and B pertussis were infrequently detected in cases ( figure 3, appendix) . M catarrhalis was the only pathogen significantly negatively associated with case status (OR 0·6, 95% CI 0·5-0·7). We observed only minor changes in the magnitude and direction of the ORs after removing the adjustment for detection of the other pathogens (appendix). Whole blood PCR was positive for S pneumoniae in cases with a positive xray (128 [7·6%] of 1676) at nearly the same prevalence as in controls (255 [5·3%] of 4779; OR 1·2, 95% CI 1·0-1·6); after applying a PCR density threshold (≥2·2 log 10 copies per mL) to enhance differ entiation of cases and controls, 26, 27 prevalence was 91 (5·4%) of 1676 cases with a positive chest xray versus 144 (3·0%) of 4779 controls (1·6, 1·2-2·1; appendix). Integrating the microbiology results from the multiple specimens among the 1767 cases with a positive chest xray and the 5075 controls, we estimated that more disease was due to viral pathogens (61·4%, 95% CrI 57·3-65·6) than to bacterial pathogens (other than M tuberculosis; 27·3%, 23·3-31·6); the remaining aetiological fractions were attributed to M tuberculosis, Candida spp, P jirovecii, and causes not otherwise specified ( figure 4A, appendix) . RSV was the most common cause (31·1%, 95% CrI 28·4-34·2), and other common pathogens (each accounting for 5% or more of the aetiological distribution) included human rhinovirus, HMPV A or B, human parainfluenza virus (types 1-4 combined), S pneumoniae, M tuberculosis, and H influenzae. Unknown causes (NOS category) accounted for 1·8% (95% CrI 0·2-4·5) of the pneumonia aetiology distribution. The fraction of pneumonia attributable to pathogens targeted by currently licensed vaccines (Hib, vaccineserotype S pneumoniae, pertussis, M tuberculosis, and influenza A or B) was 14·0% (11·3-17·0). Age, months 28 days-5 Some pathogens differed in their aetiological fraction by age strata. B pertussis, parainfluenza type 3, S aureus, P jirovecii, and RSV had a greater aetiological fraction in children younger than 1 year than in those aged 1 year or older, whereas parechovirus-enterovirus, parainfluenza type 1, rhinovirus, and S pneumoniae were more common causes in children aged 1 year or older than in those younger than 1 year (figure 4B; appendix). We found seven pathogens in the top ten pathogens of both age strata (RSV, rhinovirus, HMPV, parainfluenza, S pneumoniae, M tuberculosis, and H influenzae). The aetiological distribution by finer age strata is provided in the appendix. We observed differences in aetiological fraction by pneumonia severity for RSV, S aureus, S pneumoniae, parainfluenza type 3, and all viral causes combined ( figure 4C, appendix) . In analyses of all cases regardless of chest xray findings compared with cases with a positive xray, a greater aetiological fraction was attributed to rhinovirus (11·4% in all cases vs 7·5% in cases with a positive xray), parechovirus-enterovirus (4·6% vs 1·6%) and nonfermenting Gramnegative bacteria (2·8% vs 0·9%) in all cases, but otherwise, the analyses did not differ substantively (appendix). Aetiology by chest xray find ings will be reported in a separate manuscript. The sitespecific aetiology results standardised for age and severity of the ten focus pathogens showed consistency across the sites for most pathogens (figure 5, appendix), including for influenza, which did not exceed 3% in any site except Zambia (6·1%). Exceptions to this consistency included the following: rhinovirus was sub stantially more common in Bangladesh (29·7%) and Kenya (12·9%); H influenzae was extremely uncommon in Bangladesh (0·7%); H influenzae type b in Zambia (3·4%) and Mali (4·2%) and nontype b H influenzae in South Africa (10·0%) were dispro portionately higher than in other sites; and S pneumoniae, both vaccinetypes and nonvaccinetypes, was higher in The Gambia (15·1%) and Mali (17·4%) than in other sites. The fraction of cases attributed to bacteria was lower in Bangladesh (10·4%) and Kenya (17·5%) than in other sites (range 32·7-37·6). M tuberculosis had a larger aetiological fraction in Zambia, The Gambia, Thailand, and South Africa (6·4-10·2) than in other sites (<3%). The NOS contribution was 2% or less in all sites except Thailand (7·4%). The results stan dardised for age and severity (appendix) did not differ from the primary, non standardised, sitespecific results (ie, based on the mix of cases enrolled at each site). The cumulative aetiological fraction of the standardised and sitespecific ten most common pathogens accounted for between 79·0% and 90·0% of the aetiological fraction at every site (figure 6). By contrast, the cumulative aetiological fraction of the ten focus pathogens ranged by site from 55·1% to 86·6%, reflecting heterogeneity across the sites in the rank order of each pathogen (appendix). The distribution of the individual case aetiological probability . †For children younger than 1 year, full vaccination was defined as having received at least one dose and being up to date for age on the basis of the child's age at enrolment, doses received, and country schedule (allowing a 4-week window for each dose); for children aged 1 year or older, full vaccination was defined as having received three or more doses. ‡For children younger than 1 year, full vaccination was defined as having received at least one dose and being up to date for age on the basis of the child's age at enrolment, doses received, and country schedule (allowing a 4-week window for each dose); for children aged 1 year or older in all sites except Kenya, full vaccination was defined as having received three or more doses; for children older than 1 year in Kenya (which introduced PCV with catch-up campaign), full vaccination was defined as having received three or more doses, two doses if given at least 8 weeks apart and the child was older than 1 year of age at first dose, and one dose if the child was older than 2 years at any dose or at introduction. §Data restricted to those age-eligible; at least one dose was restricted to children older than 10 months (>10·5 months in Bangladesh). ¶Restricted to children aged 6 months or older. ||Defined as serum bioassay positive (cases and controls), antibiotics administered at the referral facility, or antibiotic administration before the collection of whole blood specimens at the study facility (cases only); restricted to children with blood culture (cases only) or whole blood (cases or controls) collected. **Data was recorded in the Mali site on the basis of time at presentation, not time at admission, as was done at all other sites; in The Gambia, on the basis of evidence from a concurrent project of clinical care, all children received oxygen if they had hypoxaemia and were coded as such for this study. † †13·7% of cases with a blood culture collected were missing blood culture volume data (0·0% in Bangladesh and Thailand, 0·2% in Kenya, 1·8% in Zambia and Mali, 7·0% in The Gambia, and 59·1% in South Africa). 29 ‡ ‡Restricted to children discharged alive who had vital status data obtained 21 days or longer after admission.
