Polymorphism at fTNFA -421 was found to be significantly associated with resistance to FIP Because the overproduction of TNF-α is widely reported in FIP animals and is considered to contribute to the pathogenesis of FIP, we first screened the polymorphisms at the 5′ terminus of the fTNFA gene, including the proximal regulatory region (PRR), the 5′-untranslated region (UTR), and part of exon 1, in 71 FIP and 93 control cats. Eight SNPs and three repeat regions were identified in the analyzed 1018 bp ( Figure 1 ). One SNP located in exon 1 at position +23 results in the substitution of CGG to CAG, causing an amino acid change from Arg to Gly (R8G); the remaining SNPs were found in the PRR. The mean allele frequencies of the minor alleles ranged from 4.3% to 39.9%. To examine the association between the identified SNPs in fTNFA and the outcome of FCoV infection, the frequency of each genotype and allele was analyzed (Additional file 1). Only one allele (T allele) at position −421 appeared to be significantly associated with resistance to FIP (P = 0.009, OR = 3.925), whereas the others showed no significance to the disease (Table 3 and Additional file 1). Polymorphisms in the extracellular domain and introns 6 and 7 of fCD209 were found to be significantly associated with the disease outcome fCD209 is an important co-receptor for both type I and II FCoV infection. To demonstrate an association between polymorphisms and FIP, we sequenced polymorphisms of the PRR, 5′-UTR, and extracellular domain (ECD) of To further demonstrate the association between the identified SNPs in fCD209 and the outcome of FCoV infection, the frequency of each genotype and allele was analyzed. Among the 24 SNPs analyzed in the PRR and the 5′-UTR of the fCD209 gene, no genotype or allele showed a significant association with the outcome of the infection (Additional file 2). In contrast, four SNPs, +1900 in the ECD of exon 6, +2276 and +2392 in intron 6, and +2713 in intron 7, identified in fCD209 were found to be significantly associated with FIP. fCD209 + 1900, located in the ECD, which is characterized by a G-to-A substitution that leads to a premature stop codon (TGG > TAG, W128*), had a significantly increased frequency in FIP animals (18.31%) compared with the control animals (5.38%) (P = 0.011, OR = 3.95), and the A allele was shown to be significantly associated with susceptibility to FIP (P = 0.014, OR = 3.65) ( Table 3 and Additional file 2). Furthermore, three SNPs, +2276, +2392, and +2713, located in introns 6 and 7 were found to be associated with disease susceptibility. A higher frequency of the T allele at position +2276 in the control cats was significantly associated with resistance to FIP (P = 0.038). Similarly, the A allele at position +2392, with a higher frequency in FCoV-infected asymptomatic cats, showed a significant association with disease resistance (P = 0.016, OR = 2.57). Moreover, the T allele at position +2713 was identified with a higher frequency in FIP cats, showing a significant association with disease susceptibility (P = 0.039, OR = 1.75) ( Table 3 and Additional file 2).
