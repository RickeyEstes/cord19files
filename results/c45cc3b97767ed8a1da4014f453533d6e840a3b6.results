MHV strain A59 induces type I IFN in the CNS coincident with viral replication. To evaluate the kinetics of MHV A59 replication relative to Ifn␣/␤ and Ifn␥ mRNA levels in the CNS, brains from uninfected and infected wild-type (wt) C57BL/6 mice were harvested out to day 21 p.i. Virus replication was monitored by expression of viral RNA encoding the N protein (A59 N), which is present on genomic and all subgenomic RNAs (33) . Viral N mRNA was most abundant between days 3 and 5 p.i. and declined by day 7 p.i. (Fig. 1 ), but it remained detectable out to day 21 p.i. Ifn␤, Ifn␣4, and Ifn␣5 mRNAs, the most abundant Ifn␣ mRNAs expressed following MHV A59 infection (34) , also reached maximal levels between 3 and 5 days p.i. and dropped significantly by day 7 p.i. (Fig. 1 ). While Ifn␤ mRNA was still elevated at day 10 p.i., Ifn␣4 and Ifn␣5 mRNAs had declined to basal levels by day 7 p.i. Ifn␥ mRNA was already detectable at day 3 p.i. but did not peak until 5 to 7 days p.i. Expression levels declined by day 10 p.i. but remained elevated above background out to day 21 p.i. (Fig. 1) . Ifn␣/␤ mRNA levels thus peaked together with viral mRNA, whereas the Ifn␥ mRNA peak was delayed and coincided with T cell infiltration (31) . Astrocytes exhibit distinct induction of and responsiveness to IFN-␣/␤ compared to microglia. Although MHV A59 replicates in glia and neurons, it induces IFN-␣/␤ only in microglia, not astrocytes, using primary cell cultures (29) . To assess the relative induction of and responsiveness to IFN-␣/␤ in astrocytes and microglia in vivo, we used infected GFAP-GFP mice to isolate CD45-negative, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive (CD45 Ϫ GFP ϩ ) astrocytes and CD45 int CD11b ϩ microglia by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) ( Fig. 2A ). Measurement of viral N relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNAs in either glia population revealed viral replication in both microglia and astrocytes at days 3 and 5 p.i. and a decline by day 7 p.i. (Fig. 2B ). While increased viral N mRNA in microglia relative to astrocytes at days 3 and 5 p.i. did not reach statistical significance, overall viral N mRNA levels mirrored those in total brain. The same populations of purified cells were used to measure transcript levels of the Ifn␣/␤ genes, genes regulating IFN-␣/␤, signaling and selected antiviral ISGs (Fig. 2C) . In naive mice, constitutive expression of these genes was lower or undetectable in astrocytes compared to microglia. Following infection, Ifn␤ mRNA was upregulated by day 3 p.i. in microglia but was not upregulated until day 5 p.i. and was less robust in astrocytes. In contrast, Ifn␣4 and Ifn␣5 mRNAs were not significantly upregulated in microglia but were increased prominently in astrocytes by day 5 p.i. Consistent with the decline in viral RNA, Ifn␣/␤ mRNAs dropped to baseline levels by day 7 p.i. (Fig. 2C ). Transcripts for components required for IFN-␣/␤ signaling showed no significant differences between astrocytes and microglia throughout days 3 to 7 p.i. (Fig. 2C) . While infection mediated a decline in Ifnar1 mRNA relative to basal levels in microglia by day 5 p.i., it did not alter expression levels in astrocytes. Stat1 mRNA levels varied between cell preparations and showed no significant changes throughout infection in either cell type. Irf9 transcripts were not affected by virus infection in microglia but increased modestly in astrocytes. In contrast, individual ISGs were regulated distinctly not only between the glia populations but also within each glia type over time (Fig. 2C) . MHV CNS infection has been shown to strongly induce IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (Ifit1 and Ifit2) and 2=,5=-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (Oas2) transcripts (11, 31) . Although Ifit1 mRNA was increased in both populations by day 3 p.i., the relative induction was significantly higher in astrocytes than in microglia at all time points. In contrast, Ifit2 mRNA was induced more prominently in microglia at day 3 p.i., reached similar levels in both cell types at day 5 p.i., and dropped thereafter in both populations. Lastly, Oas2 mRNA showed peak upregulation in microglia by day 3 p.i. and modest induction in astrocytes (Fig. 2C) . Under the assumption that viral mRNA levels reflect similar replication in both glial populations, these data support microglia as superior initiators of IFN-␤ production relative to astrocytes following MHV A59 infection in vivo; these findings are consistent with results from primary neonatal cell cultures (18, 29) . Moreover, delayed Ifn␤ upregulation in astrocytes suggested that their sensitivity to viral replication is enhanced once viral sensors are elevated via IFN-␣/␤ signaling. This notion was supported by delayed, yet more extensive, upregulation of the Ifn␣ as well as the Ifit1 and Ifit2 genes compared to that in microglia. ISG upregulation further appeared to be independent of direct changes in Ifnar, Stat1, or Irf9 transcript levels. Many PRR-encoding genes are themselves ISGs and are upregulated during CNS infections (3, 11, 35, 36) . MDA5, RIG-I, and TLR3 have all been established as PRRs contributing to IFN-␣/␤ induction in MHV-infected microglia/macrophages and oligodendrocytes (18, 27, 37, 38) . Basal Mda5, Rig-I, and Tlr3 transcript levels were all significantly lower in FACS-purified astrocytes than in microglia (Fig. 3) . Nevertheless, astrocytes rapidly upregulated Mda5, Rig-I, and Tlr3 mRNAs to levels observed in microglia as early as day 3 p.i. (Fig. 3) , when total Ifn␣/␤ mRNA peaked in the brain (Fig.  1 ). Relative to basal levels, the fold increase in astrocytes exceeded that in microglia. All three PRR transcripts declined by day 7 p.i., reflecting the decline in IFN-␣/␤. With the exception of mRNA encoding IKK, a kinase involved in both induction and IFNAR signaling, constitutive levels of transcripts for PRR signal transduction factors represented by IRF3 and IRF7 were also lower in astrocytes (Fig. 3) . Expression of the cellular kinase Ikk mRNA was gradually increased in both glial populations over time up to day 7 p.i., with increases more pronounced in microglia (Fig. 3) . Irf3 mRNA expression was decreased in microglia following infection and remained unchanged in astrocytes, contrasting with upregulation of Irf7 mRNA in both cell types between days 3 to 5 p.i. and downregulation thereafter (Fig. 3) . These data are consistent with constitutive IRF3 expression but inducible expression of both IKK and IRF7 following infection or IFN-␣/␤ treatment of non-CNS cells (39) . Overall, the data suggest that initial production of IFN-␤ in microglia results in upregulation of select ISGs in astrocytes, thereby amplifying IFN-␣/␤. However, it remains unclear whether astrocytes induce IFN-␤ directly via virus-derived PRR activators or via mediators released from necrotic or apoptotic cells in the inflamed CNS environment. Regardless, the results demonstrate that astrocytes are sensitive responders to IFN-␣/␤ and active participants in the IFN-␣/␤-induced amplification loop. IFNAR signaling in astrocytes is essential to control MHV A59 infection. Given the prominent response of astrocytes to IFN-␣/␤ following MHV A59 infection in vivo, we determined the protective role of astrocyte-mediated IFNAR signaling against infection using mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice. Disease onset was similar in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl and IFNAR fl/fl mice starting at day 4 p.i. However, in contrast to mild clinical symptoms in IFNAR fl/fl mice, mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice developed severe encephalitis and succumbed to infection by day 7 p.i. (Fig. 4A ). The 4-to 5-day-delayed mortality compared to that of IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ mice infected with a similar virus dose (31) supported astrocytes as critical, but not the only, contributors to early IFNAR-dependent protection. To evaluate whether disease severity and mortality in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice were correlated with impaired viral control, infectious virus was measured in brain supernatants. The virus loads were comparable in both groups at day 3 p.i. but reached ϳ5-log 10 -higher levels in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice than in IFNAR fl/fl mice by day 5 p.i. (Fig. 4B ). The anatomical localization and distribution of viral N protein were also evaluated by histology. Compared to small isolated residual foci of viral Ag-positive cells in brains of IFNAR fl/fl mice at day 6 p.i., mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice exhibited extensive dissemination with increased intensity of viral Ag staining throughout the brain (Fig. 4C ). High-magnification images indicated that virus was not limited to cells consistent with glial morphology but also was in cells with typical neuronal morphology in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice (Fig. 4C, insets) . As MHV A59 is hepatotropic following peripheral infection and can spread to the liver following i.c. infection of immunocom- by RT-PCR. Data represent the means Ϯ SEM from two experiments, each comprising 5 or 6 pooled brains per time point, and were analyzed by the unpaired two-tailed Student t test and two-way ANOVA. *, significance between microglia and astrocytes; #, significance compared to each respective naive population: * and #, P Ͻ 0.05; ** and ##, P Ͻ 0.01; *** and ###, P Ͻ 0.001. promised mice (26), we also surveyed liver for viral N mRNA. The levels of viral N relative to GAPDH transcripts were elevated in livers of mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl compared to IFNAR fl/fl mice at day 6 p.i. (values of 82 Ϯ 48 versus 5 Ϯ 3) (data not shown). However, overall viral N mRNA levels were significantly higher in the CNS (9,013 Ϯ 998 versus 230 Ϯ 55, respectively) (see Fig. 8 ). There was also no evidence of necrotic foci by gross visual examination (data not shown). Mortality was thus attributed to overwhelming virus spread within the CNS. MHV A59 infects multiple CNS cell types, including microglia, astrocytes, and neurons (28, 31) . To evaluate to what extent the absence of IFN-␣/␤ signaling in astrocytes predisposes astrocytes over other cell types to enhanced infection, brains from infected mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl and IFNAR fl/fl mice were analyzed for viral N protein in combination with antibodies (Abs) specific for neurons (NeuN), astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and microglia/macrophages (IBA1). Characteristic staining and colocalization patterns at day 4 p.i. in wt mice are depicted in Fig. 5A . Microglia and neurons showed prominent perinuclear cytoplasmic N protein localization, with some extension into processes in microglia. In contrast, viral Ag was only occasionally detected in the cytoplasm of astrocytes and was localized mainly proximal to, but not overlapping with, astrocytic processes. In this context it is critical to note that the anti-GFAP Ab used to identify astrocytes stains main stem branches but not the cytoplasm or fine processes of astrocytes and poorly stains gray matter astrocytes (20, 40) , suggesting that viral protein may localize to astrocytic processes poorly detected by anti-GFAP Ab. Total N protein staining revealed an ϳ3-fold-higher positive area in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl than in IFNAR fi/fi mice as determined by pixels per observed field at day 4 p.i.; the difference increased to ϳ40-fold by day 6 p.i., when virus already declined in IFNAR fi/fi mice (Fig. 5B) . Keeping the limitations of GFAP staining in mind, colocalization of viral Ag with GFAP was overall increased at day 6 p.i. Furthermore, when the relative proportion of the dual-positive area within the total viral Ag-positive pixel area was assessed, percentages were similar in both mouse strains at day 4 p.i. but were 2-fold higher in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice than in controls at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 5C ). Viral Ag-positive microglia were also overall increased in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice at day 6 p.i. However, the relative proportion of the dually viral Ag-and IBA1-positive area per total viral Ag-positive area was comparable between groups at both days 4 and 6 p.i. (Fig. 5D) . To evaluate the relative infection of astrocytes versus microglia, we also measured the proportions of viral Ag-positive area relative to GFAP-or IBA1-positive areas. While infection of microglia increased from ϳ20% to ϳ30%, it increased from Ͻ5% to 15% in astrocytes in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice between days 4 and 6 p.i. (Fig. 6) . Although infected neurons were increased in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl compared to IFNAR fl/fl mice throughout the brain by day 4 p.i., they declined significantly in both groups by day 6 p.i. Remaining elevated neuronal infection in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice at day 6 p.i. was still particularly evident in lower and distal parts of the brain (pons and medulla) (Fig. 5E) .

(C to E) Left and right panels indicate IFNAR fl/fl and mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice, respectively. The data in panels B and C represent the means Ϯ SEM from 6 or 7 fields in 2 or 3 slides from 3 mice per group and were analyzed by the unpaired two-tailed Student t test and two-way ANOVA. *, significance between IFNAR fl/fl and mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice; #, significance between days 4 and 6 p.i. in the same group: *, P Ͻ 0.05; ** and ##, P Ͻ 0.01; ***, P Ͻ 0.001. overall sparse but more abundant neuronal apoptosis in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice (Fig.  7A ). Occasional apoptotic CD3 ϩ lymphocytes were also observed with elevated frequency in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice (Fig. 7B ). While these results likely underestimate the extent of viral infection in astrocytes, they support that the absence of astrocyte IFNAR signaling leads to increased viral dissemination most prominently within astrocytes but also to microglia and neurons. Abrogated IFNAR signaling in astrocytes does not impair overall expression of IFN-␣/␤, ISGs, chemokines, and cytokines. To assess whether uncontrolled virus spread was attributable to overall impaired innate immune responses, we determined transcripts for IFN-␣/␤ and ISGs in relation to viral N mRNA levels in brains of both mouse groups (Fig. 8 ). Viral N mRNA levels were similar at day 3 p.i. but increased significantly in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice compared to IFNAR fl/fl controls by day 6 p.i. (Fig. 8) , consistent with increased infectious virus by day 5 p.i. (Fig. 4B) . Elevated viral N mRNA correlated with increased Ifn␤, Ifn␣4, and Ifn␣5 transcripts at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 8) . To assess how elevated IFN-␣/␤ affected downstream IFNAR signaling, we further compared mRNA levels of the ISGs (Ifit1, Ifit2, Isg15, Mx1, Pkr, and Oas2). While these transcripts were all similar in both mouse groups at day 3 p.i., Ifit1, Ifit2, and Mx1 mRNAs were increased 2-to 3-fold in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice by day 6 p.i. Isg15, Pkr, and Oas2 mRNAs were not affected or reduced relative to those in IFNAR fl/fl controls (Fig. 8) . IFNAR abrogation on astrocytes thus did not impair global Ifn␣/␤ or select ISG expression in the infected CNS. However, innate immunity by IFNAR-competent cells was clearly insufficient to stem viral dissemination throughout the CNS in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice. Astrocytes are also potent inducers of chemokines and cytokines (13, 41) , and a subset of chemokines, e.g., the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1, can be negatively regulated by IFN-␣/␤ (42). We therefore evaluated how the absence of IFNAR on astrocytes modulates expression of select NF-B-dependent chemokines and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) (43, 44) . Transcripts for Cxcl1 and Ccl2, potent chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively, were similar at day 3 p.i. but were significantly upregulated at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 9) , consistent with increased viral replication and IFN-␣/␤-mediated downregulation of CXCL1 by astrocytes (42, 45) . Increased Il6 mRNA expression at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 9 ) further indicated that IFNAR abrogation on astrocytes does not impact proinflammatory cytokine induction. In contrast, Ccl5 mRNA, which is prominently expressed by T cells during MHV infection (46) , was significantly reduced compared to that in IFNAR fl/fl mice at day 6 p.i. Dysregulation of these proinflammatory factors suggested that myeloid cells may be recruited in favor of lymphocytes in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice, thereby contributing to morbidity and uncontrolled viral spread. Infected mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice exhibit increased CNS neutrophil accumulation and reduced T cell infiltration. Flow cytometry revealed that altered chemokine expression patterns indeed affected the composition of inflammatory cells within the CNS. Consistent with elevated Cxcl1 mRNA, neutrophils in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl brains were increased by ϳ8-fold at day 6 p.i. relative to those in IFNAR fl/fl mice, although numbers in both groups were already reduced compared to those at day 3 p.i. (Fig. 10A) . Differences in macrophages were not statistically significant (Fig. 10B) . As both CD4 and CD8 T cells are essential to reduce infectious MHV, with IFN-␥ playing a prominent antiviral role (33, 47) , we further assessed if impaired T cell recruitment and IFN-␥ production within the CNS is associated with lack of virus control. Indeed, both CD4 and CD8 T cells were reduced in the CNS of mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 10C) . However, similar IFN-␥ levels (Fig. 10D) , despite reduced T cell numbers, suggested that increased viral replication leads to increased Ag presentation, thereby triggering more or prolonged IFN-␥ production by T cells in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice (48, 49) . Impaired access of T cells to the CNS parenchyma was ruled out as an explanation of loss of viral control, as we found no differences in anatomical distribution of CD3 ϩ T cells within perivascular and parenchymal sites between the two groups (data not shown). Uncontrolled viral replication in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice despite similar IFN-␥ production thus implied that viral replication overwhelms the T cell response or that IFN-␥ signaling is impaired. Determination of IFN-␥-specific responses in vivo is complicated by the fact that many factors upregulated by IFN-␥ are also induced by IFN-␣/␤ (50). Nevertheless, a prominent indicator of IFN-␥ signaling in microglia/macrophages is induction of the transcription factor class II transactivator (CIITA), a master regulator of MHC class II expression (51, 52) . Interestingly, Ciita transcripts were barely induced in brains of mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice, in contrast to robust upregulation in control mice, at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 10E) . Analysis of MHC class II expression on microglia by flow cytometry confirmed that the very modest Ciita mRNA induction impaired IFN-␥-dependent MHC class II upregulation. Only ϳ16% of microglia expressed MHC class II in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice, compared to ϳ76% in IFNAR fl/fl mice, and the mean fluorescence intensity, reflecting expression levels, per cell was also lower (Fig. 10F) . Other IFN-␥-dependent factors include the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 (53, 54) . While CXCL9 expression is inducible mainly by IFN-␥, CXCL10 is inducible by IFN-␣/␤, IFN-␥, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (42, 55, 56) . Furthermore, CXCL9 is produced by macrophages/microglia and endothelial cells, but not astrocytes, whereas CXCL10 is induced prominently in astrocytes during inflammation (53, 57) . Assessment of Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 mRNAs showed similarly low levels in both groups at day 3 p.i. (Fig. 10G) . However, unlike IFNAR fl/fl mice, mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice failed to upregulate Cxcl9 mRNA by day 6 p.i. In contrast, Cxcl10 mRNA levels were elevated by ϳ2.5-fold in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice by day 6 p.i. but did not increase in IFNAR fl/fl mice. Given that mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice do not express IFNAR on astrocytes, Cxcl10 mRNA upregulation is likely driven by IFN-␥ and/or TNF. Overall, these results implied that microglia, but not astrocytes, are significantly compromised in IFN-␥ responsiveness in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice. Preexposure to IFN-␣/␤ modifies IFN-␥ responsiveness in myeloid cells. One explanation for the differential responsiveness to IFN-␥ in microglia versus astrocytes in mGFAPcre IFNAR fl/fl mice is that prolonged IFNAR signaling via elevated and sustained IFN-␣/␤ expression may skew subsequent IFN-␥ responsiveness. This is supported by an antagonistic effect of IFN-␣/␤ on IFN-␥ responses in macrophages following IFN treatment or Listeria infection (58) (59) (60) . We therefore used the viral RNA mimic poly(I·C), a synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) analog recognized by TLR3 as well as RIG-I/MDA5, to induce Ifn␣/␤ mRNA in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and monitor IFN-␥ responsiveness. Previous in vivo data revealed that poly(I·C) administration into the CNS of mice induced Ifn␣/␤ mRNA by 4 h, which was sustained out to 12 h (11). BMDM were thus pretreated with poly(I·C) for 4 or 12 h and subsequently treated with IFN-␥ for 18 h. IFN-␥-only treatment was included as a positive control. Poly(I·C) alone did not induce Ciita mRNA at 4 h and induced it only sparsely by 12 h. However, while IFN-␥ treatment alone effectively induced Ciita mRNA, it failed to induce Ciita mRNA in cells pretreated with poly(I·C) for either 4 or 12 h (Fig. 11) . Similarly, poly(I·C) alone only sparsely induced Cxcl9 mRNA at 4 h compared to induction by IFN-␥ treatment alone, and short poly(I·C) pretreatment suppressed Cxcl9 mRNA induction by IFN-␥. Assessment of an inhibitory effect of prolonged poly(I·C) exposure was preempted by induction of Cxcl9 mRNA levels similar to those with IFN-␥. Finally, treatment with poly(I·C) alone was superior to IFN-␥ alone in upregulating Cxcl10 mRNA, with saturation already achieved at 4 h. These results are consistent with poly(I·C)-mediated upregulation of CXCL10 via IFN-␣/␤ and TNF and preempted use of Cxcl10 as a target gene to assess suppressive functions on IFN-␥ signaling in this experimental setting. Overall, these data indicate that preexposure of macrophages/ microglia to a virus-induced inflammatory milieu including IFN-␣/␤ has the potential to negatively regulate subsequent IFN-␥ signaling. However, the magnitude of IFN-␣/␤mediated suppression of IFN-␥-dependent gene induction depends on other regulatory elements in the respective target gene promoter. These results reveal that the duration and/or level of cell exposure to IFN-␣/␤ can substantially diminish responsiveness to temporally lagging IFN-␥, thereby reducing IFN-␥ protective functions.
