To test the overall hypothesized model described in Fig. 1 , this study performed structural equation modeling (SEM) with observed variables in Mplus 6.1. SEM enables researchers to examine the links from exogenous and antecedent endogenous variables to the consequent endogenous variables, as well as the relations among all exogenous and antecedent endogenous variables (Kelloway, 1998) . In the proposed model for this study, control variables were used as exogenous variables, and the other variables were treated as endogenous variables. The maximum likelihood mean-adjusted (MLM) estimator was used to address non-normally distributed data. The MLM estimator is appropriate for continuous but non-normal data as it applies robust corrections to the test statistic and standard errors (Chou, Bentler, & Satorra, 1991; Krueger, Chentsova-Dutton, Markon, & Goldberg, 2003; Satorra & Bentler, 1994) . This study first assessed the hypothesized model with several goodness-of-fit indices, including the chi-square statistic, the comparative fit index (CFI), the TuckereLewis index (TLI), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). Specifically, the chi-square statistic assesses the magnitude of discrepancy between the hypothesized covariance matrix and the observed covariance matrix (Hu & Bentler, 1999) . A nonsignificant value of chi-square is usually accepted as evidence of a good model fit. Other model fit indices are categorized into incremental and absolute indices. The most commonly used incremental indices are the CFI and the TLI. Both measure the proportionate improvement in model fit by comparing the hypothesized model with the less restricted baseline model (Byrne, 2012) . CFI and TLI values of 0.95 or greater are indicative of a good model (Hu & Bentler, 1999) . The RMSEA and the SRMR belong to the category of absolute indices of fit and determine how well the hypothesized model fits the sample data (Byrne, 2012) . RMSEA values under 0.08 and under 0.06 for SRMR are considered good model fits (Hu & Bentler, 1999) . Based on the cutoff criteria summarized above, our proposed model presented a reasonably good fit to the data: c 2 ¼ 2.60, df ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.11, RMSEA ¼ 0.04 (90% CI ¼ 0.00 to 0.10), CFI ¼ 0.99, TLI ¼ 0.94, and SRMR ¼ 0.01. Table 2 presents all structural parameters in the model and Fig. 2 indicates the results of all hypothesized paths. H1 predicted that expressing MERS-related information would be positively related to self-efficacy for MERS (H1a) and perceived threat of MERS (H1b). The findings supported H1a (b ¼ 0.16, p < 0.001) but failed to support H1b. Contrary to H2a and H2b, expressing MERS-related information was negatively associated with handwashing intention (b ¼ À0.16, p < 0.001) and cough etiquette intention (b ¼ À0.20, p < 0.001). H3 predicted that receiving MERS-related information would be positively related to self-efficacy for MERS (H3a) and perceived threat of MERS (H3b). We found support for H3b (b ¼ 0.18, p < 0.001) but not for H3a. As proposed in H4a and H4b, receiving MERS-related information was positively associated with handwashing intention (b ¼ 0.11, p < 0.01) and cough etiquette intention (b ¼ 0.12, p < 0.01). Hence, H4a and H4b were supported. Supporting H5a and H5b, self-efficacy for MERS was positively related to handwashing intention (b ¼ 0.32, p < 0.001) and cough etiquette intention (b ¼ 0.30, p < 0.001). Similarly, perceived threat of MERS was positively associated with handwashing intention (b ¼ 0.22, p < 0.001) and cough etiquette intention (b ¼ 0.22, p < 0.001). Thus, H6a and H6b were supported. H7 predicted that the relationships between expressing MERSrelated information and handwashing intention, and cough etiquette intention would be mediated by self-efficacy for MERS (H7a) and perceived threat of MERS (H7b). As shown in Table 3 , higher levels of expressing MERS-related information led to higher levels of self-efficacy for MERS, which resulted in greater handwashing intention (standardized coefficient ¼ 0.05, p < 0.001) and cough etiquette intention (standardized coefficient ¼ 0.05, p < 0.001). However, perceived threat of MERS did not mediate the relationships between expressing MERS-related information and handwashing intention, and cough etiquette intention. Thus, H7a was supported but H7b was not supported. H8 posited that the relationships between receiving MERSrelated information and handwashing intention, and cough etiquette intention would be mediated by self-efficacy for MERS (H8a) and perceived threat of MERS (H8b). As shown in Table 4 , higher levels of receiving MERS-related information led to higher levels of perceived threat of MERS. This in turn predicted higher levels of handwashing intention (standardized coefficient ¼ 0.04, p < 0.001) and cough etiquette intention (standardized coefficient ¼ 0.04, p < 0.001). However, self-efficacy for MERS was not shown to mediate the relationships between receiving MERSrelated information and handwashing intention, and cough etiquette intention. Therefore, H8a was not supported, while H8b was supported. Note. Coefficients are standardized Gamma (g) and Beta (b). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
