Excellent results were obtained by solid-phase methodology using Fmoc/HBTU chemistry. The crude AVLQSGFR showed 87.6% yield and greater than 72.8% purity with molecular weight of 877.3, which exactly matches the theoretical value. The yield capacity of this purification process reached 10 mg per circle, and the purity of the desired octapeptide was 98%. The octapeptide AVLQSGFR we synthesized in this study has no toxicity on Vero cells within the experimental concentration, as shown in Fig. 1 . It also has no recognizable effect of Vero cells observed with the help of a microscope. Also, as shown in Fig. 1 , the inhibitory effect of the octapeptide against SARS coronavirus in Vero cells is dose-dependent. The cultures' absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a 96-well plate ELISA reader. CC 50 and EC 50 were then determined by the computer program Prizm 2.0. The octapeptide's EC 50 is 2.7 Â 10 À2 mg L À1 , and its selectivity index is more than 3704 (Table 1) . We also detected the effect of the octapeptide AVLQSGFR on replication of SARS-associated coronavirus in Vero cells (Fig. 2) . It was observed that, for the infected cells treated with 1 mg L À1 , the octapeptide AVLQSGFR obviously blocked replication of the virus.
