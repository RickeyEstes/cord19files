Tissue samples from 60 stoats and sera from 57 of these were analysed. Samples were collected from nine locations ( Fig. 1 ). The sex ratio was not significantly different from parity (overall males:females = 1.3:1, G c = 0.66, P > 0.1). On the whole, preservation of tissue structure was remarkably good. Samples from the intestinal tract were most affected by autolytic change, but in most cases the 'ghost outline' of the underlying tissue permitted some analysis of tissue structure. Summary comments on the appearance of the major organ systems are presented below. Most lungs had evidence of either focal or diffuse congestion/haemorrhage, interpreted as agonal change. Most (n = 38, 63%) also had evidence of diffuse or focal interstitial pneumonia involving infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages (pyogranulomatous) (Fig. 2) . In five of these cases, there was additional involvement of the bronchi with neutrophilic exocytosis into the bronchiolar lumena (bronchopneumonia). Some lungs had evidence of BALT aggregates, but this was not a consistent feature. Parasitic larvae were not identified within the pulmonary tissue. There were occasional focal and well-defined microgranulomas. One of these centred upon fragments of aspirated matter and two had large, crescentic, translucent structures at the centre reminiscent of the adiaspores of the fungus Chrysosporium (Fig. 3) . Myocardium, endocardium and epicardium were almost invariably normal. In two stoats there was evidence of a mild and focal myocarditis -generally involving a mixed mononuclear cell infiltration. The majority of stomachs were histologically normal. In six stoats, there were small focal granulomatous infiltrates at the base of the glandular mucosa, sometimes extending into muscularis mucosa. In several of these cases there were parasitic larvae in the centre of these aggregates, suggesting that these lesions were attributable to larval migration (Fig. 4) . Sections of the duodenum, ileum, caecum and colon were largely normal. Pancreatic tissue was generally normal (both exocrine and endocrine) and it was noted that stoats have very prominent islets relative to some species. In two cases, there was evidence of interstitial pancreatitis. The majority of samples of liver were histologically normal. Seven had evidence of diffuse hepatocyte vacuolation. Other livers had focal (centrilobular) vacuolation of hepatocytes which is a non-specific change. Occasional portal areas had a mild, mononuclear cell infiltration but this was rarely above what would be considered background in other species. Several livers had small parenchymal (mid-zonal) foci of hepatocyte degeneration and mixed inflammation (focal hepatitis). Two had evidence of vascular telangiectasis, and in one of these cases there was a relatively large area of hepatocyte loss, blood pooling and surrounding granulomatous inflammation (Fig. 5) . No significant abnormality was found in any kidney but one sample showed evidence of a single small focus of interstitial lymphoid aggregation. Longitudinal sections of spleen were all remarkably similar in appearance and the spleen was invariably markedly active. The white pulp (lymphoid) areas were extremely prominent, often with very large secondary follicles dominating. Red pulp was not often severely congested, but was always very cellular. The cellular content of red pulp included lymphocytes, plasma cells, and megakaryocytes were often prominent indicating extramedullary haematopoiesis. Also of note in red pulp was the presence of a population of very large, blastic round cells with an open-faced nucleus and prominent nucleolus. These cells may have been lymphoblastic. In one or two spleens this population dominated, and the cells were so large and pleomorphic in appearance that in other species their presence may have suggested neoplasia. Mesenteric lymph nodes were all very similar in appearance, consistent with marked immunological activity of the gut. There were very prominent secondary follicles with germinal centres and mantle zones, frequent paracortical hyperplasia and dilated medullary sinuses with sinus histiocytosis. The brain was histologically normal in the majority of stoats, with no evidence of lesions consistent with viral infection (e.g. distemper virus). In one stoat there was a focal, granulomatous meningitis that affected the meninges ventral to hindbrain, this animal was seropositive for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (arenavirus), though a link between these observations is not certain. In another stoat there was mild focal gliosis within the parenchyma. Testicular structure and ovarian tissue, including the fallopian tube, were generally histologically normal. In one stoat, there were granulomatous plaques covering a number of abdominal viscera, with granulomatous disease of the lung and meninges. This animal appeared to have a systemic granulomatous inflammatory disease. Sera from eight individuals (14%), seven of which were from one site (Grebe Valley), were positive in the feline calicivirus antibody assay. Three individuals, two of which were from a single site (Reefton), were seropositive for morbillivirus, a family that includes canine distemper virus. Two individuals were positive for parvovirus antibody, including one that was one of the three stoats that were positive for morbillivirus. Single, separate individuals were found to be positive for antibodies reactive with ortho-poxviruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (arenavirus), and canine herpesvirus. All sera were negative for canine adenovirus and coronavirus. There was no evidence of a relationship among samples between seroprevalence of virus antibodies and histopathological evidence of disease. There was no significant relationship between the incidence of inflammation in one organ system and another (P > 0.1 in all cases).
