FBL Expression Is Inversely Associated with p53 Activity in Cell Lines and Human Breast Cancer Samples Fibrillarin (FBL) is an indispensable, highly conserved protein essential in the processing of pre-rRNAs (Newton et al., 2003; Tollervey et al., 1993) . In eukaryotes, it is the only known methyltransferase that performs the specific 2 0 -O-ribose-methylation directed by a large family of small trans-acting guide RNA (box C/D antisense snoRNAs). Because abnormal rRNA methylation could influence translational control and because p53 regulates rRNA transcription, we explored whether FBL expression was associated with p53 activity. We measured FBL mRNA and protein levels in different cell lines in which p53 expression and/or activity was modulated by different strategies. In immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HME), p53 activity was impaired either by reducing its expression using an shRNA approach (HME-shp53) or by inactivation using an SV40 T/t antigen trapping strategy (HMLE; Elenbaas et al., 2001) . In response to p53 knockdown or inactivation, there was a significant increase in FBL expression: 1.5-fold for the mRNA and 2-fold for the protein (Figures 1A-1D ; Figures S1A and S1B available online). As expected, we observed a decrease in the expression of CDKN1A, which encodes p21, and MDM2, two p53 target genes, which validated the reduction in p53 activity in these cellular models ( Figures 1B, 1D , S1A, and S1B). The inverse correlation between FBL and p53 expression was confirmed in a second series of immortalized HMEC lines (Figures S1C and S1D) and in an isogenic human HCT-116 colorectal cellular model: HCT-116-p53 +/+ cells that express wildtype p53 protein and HCT-116-p53 À/À cells that lack p53 protein expression (Bunz et al., 1998) . FBL mRNA and protein levels were increased in HCT-116-p53 À/À cells compared to those of HCT-116-p53 +/+ cells ( Figures 1E, 1F , and S1E), demonstrating that the increase in expression of FBL in response to p53 inactivation is not restricted to mammary cell lines. To assess more directly the impact of p53 on FBL expression, HME cells were treated with a p53-specific siRNA instead of an shRNA to induce a transient knockdown of p53 expression (Figures 2A , 2B, S2A, and S2B). In this condition, increased FBL expression at the mRNA and protein levels correlated with the inhibition of p53 expression (Figures 2A and 2B ). Taken together, these results exclude the possibility that the changes in FBL expression levels resulted from an off-target effect and firmly link FBL expression to p53 expression. Additionally, to investigate the impact of p53 activation on FBL expression, we treated HME cells with the topoisomerase inhibitors doxorubicin and camptothecin, which are prominent activators of p53. The results showed that the expected p53 induction in response to treatment was accompanied by a decrease in FBL mRNA and protein levels ( Figures 2C and 2D) . Quantification of the western blots demonstrated a significant association between the increase of p53 protein levels and the decrease of FBL protein levels ( Figures S2C-S2E) . The expression of endogenous FBL in the indicated cell lines was analyzed at the mRNA level by RT-qPCR (A, C, and E) and at the protein level by western blot (B, D, and F). All graphs represent mean and SD of at least three experiments. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 according to Student's t test. See also Figure S1 . In human cancers, the TP53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently inactivated, mainly by mutations (Olivier et al., 2006) . To determine whether FBL expression is associated with p53 mutation status independently of other genetic variations in cell lines, we analyzed the FBL expression levels in a panel of three wild-type p53 breast cell lines and five mutant p53 breast cancer cell lines. High levels of FBL mRNA and protein were significantly associated with the expression of mutant p53 (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3) . This result prompted us to investigate the clinical correlation between the p53 mutation status and FBL expression. We analyzed the FBL mRNA expression levels by RT-qPCR in relation to the p53 mutation status in a cohort of 80 randomly selected primary breast tumors (Table S1 ). Consistent with the results obtained in cell lines, FBL mRNA levels were significantly higher in mutant p53 tumors compared to wild-type p53 tumors ( Figure 3C ). We also performed a retrospective statistical analysis of the gene expression array data described by Miller and colleagues (Miller et al., 2005) . FBL mRNA levels were significantly higher in mutant p53 tumors (n = 58) than in wild-type p53 tumors (n = 193; p < 10 À4 , t test). Altogether, these results show a significant and reproducible inverse association between the p53 level and/or activity and the expression of FBL at both the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that p53 can repress FBL expression in cellular models of breast and colon cancer as well as in human breast tumors. p53 Represses FBL Expression by Directly Binding to DNA Using the MatInspector software and the p53FamTag database, two putative p53 responsive elements (p53RE-1 and p53RE-2) were identified within the FBL intron 1, suggesting a direct transcriptional regulation of FBL expression by p53 (Cartharius et al., 2005; Sbisà et al., 2007; Figures 4A and S4A) . Based on these predictions, we developed a luciferase reporter (pFBL-Luc) assay to assess whether p53 regulates FBL promoter activity. HCT-116-p53 À/À cells were cotransfected with pFBL-Luc and a plasmid expressing either wild-type or mutant p53 protein at Endogenous FBL expression was analyzed in HME cells at the mRNA level by RT-qPCR (A and C) and at the protein level by western blot (B and D) . The p53 expression is modulated by using an siRNA (A and B) or by treating or not (NT) with 2 mg/ml doxorubicin or 1 nM camptothecin (C and D). The p21 lanes in (D) were spliced together from discontinuous lanes of the same blot as indicated by dotted lines. All graphs represent mean and SD of at least three experiments. *p < 0.05 and ***p < 0.001 according to Student's t test. See also Figure S2 . detectable protein levels (Figures 4B and S4B) . The coexpression of wild-type p53 significantly decreased the luciferase activity by 80%, while no significant variation in luciferase activity was observed after co-expression of any p53 mutant. Similar results were observed in HME-shp53, the coexpression of wild-type, but not mutant, p53 protein reducing the luciferase activity ( Figure 4C ). These results suggest that p53 represses promoter activity through intron 1 of FBL in both breast and colon cellular models. To determine whether p53 directly binds to FBL gene DNA, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed in HME-derived cells ( Figures 4D, 4E , S4C, and S4D). Compared to nontreated HME cells, camptothecin treatment increased p53 binding to both the CDKN1A promoter and the intron 1 of FBL at p53RE-1 and p53RE-2. In contrast, decrease in p53 expression in HME-shp53 cells was associated with a drastic reduction in p53 binding to both the CDKN1A promoter and intron 1 of FBL compared with nontreated HME cells (Figures 4D, 4E, S4C, and S4D) . These data show that p53 binds the FBL intron 1 both in the basal condition and when p53 is activated. Altogether, these results demonstrate that FBL is a p53 target gene and that FBL expression is directly repressed by p53.
