A total of 12 patients were included in our study with prevalence of males (2:1) with ages ranging between 18 and 76 years having an average age of 36 ± 2 years. Patients were presented to our emergency department. All were complaining of variable degrees of fever ranging between 38.2 and 41.5°C with an average of 39.4°± 0.3°. Chest pain was not a prominent feature; occurring in only 6 cases. Variable degrees of cough and dyspnea occur in 10 cases. Co-morbidities include diabetes mellitus (n = 3), hypertension (n = 2), coronary artery disease (n = 1) and asthma (n = 1). Laboratory tests upon presentation showed lymphocytosis in 9 cases, monocytosis in 9 cases, anemia (usually mild) in 6 cases, high C-reactive protein and ESR in almost all cases (11/12) . Virus profile was done for influenza plus B, and H1N1 viruses were done. Laboratory tests for corona virus; namely real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates were done for all patients. The specimen was collected in the hospital and transferred to the Central Governmental laboratories. The results were convoyed back to the hospital. The test proved positive in all cases; however, it was proved positive in the first time in 6 cases, negative at first and positive in repeat test in 4 cases and only positive in third trial in 2 cases. Combined H1N1-MERS-CoV infections were detected in only one patient. The outcome of these patients was as follows: 6 were treated with average hospital stay ranging between 21 and 35 days, one case died after 14 days, and 5 cases were transferred to Central Governmental hospital according the local authority rules. They were transferred after positive test results for MERS-CoV had been obtained. Their period of stays averages 8 days (range of 2-15 days).
