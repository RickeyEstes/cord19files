PROGRAMMED US FIELDS. Calibrated hydrophone measurements demonstrated that the clinical imaging probe could achieve peak negative acoustic pressures ranging from 20 kPa to 4.0 MPa (MI 0.03 to 3.44) , and were largely independent of pulse length. Output conditions were then set to achieve a peak negative acoustic pressure of 1.5 MPa to approximate that previously used to augment tissue flow in mice (8) . Computer-simulated field assessment for the different programmed line densities showed excellent agreement with hydrophone data, with beam widths measured to within 5% agreement ( Figure 1B) .  The cohort consisted of 127 patients with mild (25%), moderate (24%), or severe AS (51%). The baseline clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic characteristics are presented in Table 1 (63% men; mean age 75 AE 10 years). There was a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and/or disease, including hyperlipidemia (75%), diabetes (26%), hypertension (81%), ischemic heart disease (IHD) (37%), atrial fibrillation (28%), and heart failure (32%). With regard to baseline medical therapy, 75% of subjects were on ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), 71% were on statins, and 39% were on beta-blockers. (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) 38 (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) 40 (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) 0.420 with above-median plasma ACE2 activity were more likely to be men (p ¼ 0.02) with a history of IHD and higher body mass index (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in baseline pharmacological therapy. On multivariable regression analysis, male sex was the only independent clinical predictor of higher plasma ACE2 activity (p ¼ 0.001). The proportion of patients with BNP clinical activation was also significantly higher in those with abovemedian plasma ACE2 activity (57% vs. 37%; p ¼ 0.027) ( Figure 1 ). There was no difference in hemoglobin concentration and creatinine levels between the 2 groups (p > 0.05). PLASMA ACE2 ACTIVITY AND ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY. The median duration of follow-up was 5 years (IQR: 0.19 to 5 years). Over this period, 58 patients underwent AVR, and 31 patients (24%) died. There was a higher incidence of all-cause mortality in those with above-median plasma ACE2 activity compared with below-median plasma ACE2 (38% vs. 11%; log-rank p < 0.001). ROC analysis was used to determine the plasma ACE2 value with the best combination of sensitivity and specificity for all-cause mortality. The ROC area under the curve was 0.73 (95% CI: 62% to 82%) and a plasma ACE2 cutoff value of 41.2 pmol/ml/min had a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 75% for detecting all-cause mortality (Supplemental Figure 1 ). Patients with plasma ACE2 activity above this threshold had a significantly increased likelihood of all-cause mortality compared with those without activity (HR: 3.86; 95% CI: 1.85 to 8.06; p < 0.001) ( Figure 2A) ; therefore, this ROC-derived value was used for subsequent analysis. When analyzed according to sex, elevated plasma ACE2 activity >41.2 pmol/ml/min was associated with a higher incidence of all-cause mortality in both male (log rank test; p ¼ 0.01) and female patients (log-rank test: p < 0.001) respectively. Patients with BNP activation had a significantly increased likelihood of death (HR: 4.64; 95% CI: 2.06 to 10.42; p < 0.001) ( Figure 2B ). Allcause mortality was highest in those with the combination of elevated plasma ACE2 activity and BNP clinical activation (HR: 13.78; 95% CI: 3.97 to 47.8; p < 0.001) ( Figure 2C ). Other univariate predictors of mortality included age, heart failure, IHD, beta-blocker use, LV mass, abnormal LV ejection fraction (sex-specific), BNP clinical activation, and log serum creatinine level ( Figure 4) . LV remodeling and myocardial fibrosis (25) . RAS inhibition has a positive impact on regressing hypertrophy, improving myocardial physiology, and slowing the rate of progression of valvular stenosis (26) . In 2000, our understanding of the RAS was significantly broadened with the discovery of the ACE2 gene (27) , which changed the simplistic vertical view of the RAS and led to the concept of a counterregulatory arm with opposing effects in cardiovascular biology (28) . The key findings of this study in patients with AS were that increased plasma ACE2 levels were associated with myocardial structural abnormalities and provided added incremental prognostic information to predict long-term mortality over and above conventional risk markers, including BNP activation (Central Illustration). Plasma ACE2 levels correlated with the extent of valvular calcification but not AS severity. The median ACE2 level in the AS cohort was 34 pmol/ml/min, which was similar to levels we reported in a high-risk cohort with coronary artery disease (9) (median: 29 pmol/ml/min) and higher than levels in patients with atrial fibrillation (10) or in young healthy volunteers (mean: 4 pmol/ml/min) (16) . Consistent with previous reports, there was no correlation between ACE2 activity and treatment with ACE inhibitors, and male sex was an independent predictor of increased plasma ACE2 activity (9, 10) . The systolic function as measured according to LV ejection fraction did not differ between sexes (p ¼ 0.16).
