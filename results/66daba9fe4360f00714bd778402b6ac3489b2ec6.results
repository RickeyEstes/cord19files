Endogenous RNA G4s derived from natural 5 0 -UTRs can induce À1 FS To investigate the possibility of RNA G4 in inducing À1 FS, we first examined two well-defined suppressive RNA G4s located in the 5 0 -UTR of NRAS (9) and Trf2 (32) to prove our principle. As shown in Figure 1 , both RNA G4s when located 5 nt downstream of an efficient U 3 A 3 C slippery sequence showed significant À1 FS compared with corresponding negative controls in an in vitro translation assay (2.6-fold and 6-fold for NRAS and Trf2, respectively). These data indicate that the stable RNA G4s, which can interrupt 40S ribosomal subunit Figure 1 . Natural RNA G4s can cause À1 frameshifting (À1 FS). The wild-type (wt) G4 forming sequences located in the 5 0 -UTR of NRAS (wt NRAS) and Trf2 (wt Trf2) were cloned 5-nt downstream of UUUAAAC slippery sequence (underlined) in a frameshifting reporter construct (33) . Mutants, mut NRAS and mut Trf2, that are unable to form a G4 were constructed by replacing the 5 0 proximal G-tract by 3 As. SDS-PAGE analysis was used to resolve the 35 scanning are able to act as roadblocks to stimulate frameshifting as well. Spacer length effect of G4-induced À1 FS An optimal spacer length between slippery sequence and downstream stimulatory structures is crucial for efficient À1 FS (34, 35) . Although generally between 5 and 8 nt, the optimal distance depends on individual frameshifting signals. To investigate the optimal distance of RNA G4s, a novel frameshifting signal in inducing À1 FS, we increased the spacer length stepwise from 3 to 10 nt in the (G 3 U) 4 background (Figure 2A ). (G 3 U) 4 has been reported as the most stable G4 structure both at RNA and DNA level (36, 37) and thus may result in higher FS efficiency. Almost 2-fold higher FS than the Trf2 G4 was measured at the same spacer length of 5 nt ( Figure 2B,  SP5) , while a control construct, in which the G4 structure is disrupted by 4 G-to-A mutations showed only 0.4% of FS ( Figure 2B , NC). FS reached an optimum of $7% at a spacer length of 6-8 nt ( Figure 2B , SP6-SP8). The À1 FS efficiency was also tested in cultured mammalian cells using a dual luciferase reporter plasmid (33) The FS efficiency in vivo was related to an in-frame control whose activity was set at 100% (see 'Materials and Methods' section). Similar to in vitro experiments, optimal FS was observed for the 6-nt spacer with decreasing FS efficiencies for shorter and longer spacers (Supplementary Figure S1 ). In general, FS efficiencies measured in vivo are much lower than those obtained in vitro [see e.g. (29) ]. À1 FS efficiency is positively correlated with the thermodynamic stability of G4 RNA A typical feature of G4 RNAs is that the four G3 tracts are separated by three loops. The length of these loops is central to G4 stability and topology (36) . To better characterize RNA G4s as frameshifting signals, we systematically investigated the effect of total loop length as well as the orientation of the loop in À1 FS using the representative U-rich sequence in these loop regions. To clarify, the number of the first, second and third loop regions separated by four G3 tracts were denoted as (x, y, z) ( Figure 3) . For example, a total loop-length of 4 nt can result in three different constructs with loop orientation as (1,1,2), (1,2,1) and (2,1,1), respectively. These three loop variants induced 3.5, 4.4 and 3.9% of À1 FS, respectively (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S2 ). For the six constructs with total loop length of 5 nt, the À1 FS efficiency ranges from 2.3 to 3.2% (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S2 ). Constructs with a total loop length of 6 (2,2,2), 7 (2,2,3 and 1,5,1) and 10 (3,4,3) nt displayed a decreasing ability in promoting À1 FS. In combination with previous data showing that the thermodynamic stability of RNA G4s is inversely correlated with total loop length (37), our results suggest that RNA G4s can induce À1 FS in a thermodynamic stability-dependent manner. We and others previously observed the same trend for frameshifting signals formed by perfect stemloop structures (29) and antisense oligonucleotides (20, 21, 38) . We further increased the number of G3 repeats with the aim to induce higher À1 FS due to their better ability to impede ribosomal scanning (13) . However, with the exception of (G 3 U) 5 , we observed less efficient À1 FS by incrementing the number of G 3 U repeats (Supplementary Figure S3 , left). These data are in contrast to a previous study applying G4 RNAs in the 5 0 -UTR as translational suppressors (13) . This discrepancy may be due to the intrinsic differences of the readouts. To induce À1 FS, the frameshifting signal should be present at a precisely defined distance, whereas for inhibition of scanning, the precise location of the roadblock is not important. With increasing number of G3 tracts, the possibility of forming a (G 3 U) 4 at the right distance from the slippery sequence will decrease, thus actually resulting in a decrease in FS. For obstructing ribosomal scanning, distance is not an issue, and as melting of the first G-stretch still allows formation of a new G4 by downstream G-tracts, scanning inhibition is enhanced by increasing numbers of G-tracts. Moreover, decreasing or increasing the number of G-quartets results in less FS (Supplementary Figure S3 , right) in agreement with their lower thermodynamic stability (3). Ligands that bind G4 RNA can either enhance or decrease FS Next we investigated the effect of G4 binding ligands on FS efficiency. We chose the G4 stabilizing ligand PhenDC3, which has been reported to increase the stability of a variety of DNA (30) and RNA (39) G4s and the porphyrin TMPyP4, which is a known G4 destabilizing agent (31) . Addition of PhenDC3 resulted in a dosedependent enhancement of FS of the (G 3 U) 4 construct reaching a 1.4-fold increase at a concentration of 2 mM (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S4 ). Addition of TMPyP4 at 2 mM, although affecting global translation, decreased FS $3-fold (Supplementary Figure S5) , while both TMPyP4 and PhenDC3 had no significant effects on frameshifting induced by a 12 base-pair hairpin (Supplementary Figure S5) . These data verify that RNA quadruplex formation is responsible for the observed FS.
