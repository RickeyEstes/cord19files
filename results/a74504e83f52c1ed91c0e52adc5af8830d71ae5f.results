Mp -DNA (BALF) Mp -DNA (NPA) a IgG(paired sera) NO. Mp positive (N = 110) + + / 98 Mp negative (N = 4038) - Mp Mycoplasma pneumoniae, CAP community-acquired pneumonia, BALF bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, NPAs nasopharyngeal aspirates a The NPAs were tested simultaneously for Mp, Chlamydia and 11 common respiratory viruses using a GeXP-based multiplex reverse transcription PCR assay, thus Mp-DNA (NPAs) was tested for all patients were more likely to have abnormal blood gases (P = 0.041). In addition, the underlying medical conditions of Mp co-detected patients were relatively similar to those of Mp mono-detected patients.
