The 53 patients studied included 18 men and 35 women. The mean age was 39.3 Ϯ 18.1 years (age range, 5 to 91 years). Forty of these patients had a positive PCR finding accompanying a typical clinical course. The remaining 13 patients had a typical clinical course and were clearly linked in a chain of transmission by a history of close contact with a SARS patient and/or evidence of transmission to another patient in whom SARS was subsequently diagnosed. These 13 patients included 7 with a negative PCR finding and 6 others in whom PCR was not performed. The latter group included both staff and patients from the hospital in which significant local transmission initially occurred in Taiwan. No PCR test was available at that time. Thirteen of the 53 patients (25%) were health-care workers (HCWs), 21 patients (42%) had visited hospitals where SARS patients had been treated, 11 patients (21%) had community contact with SARS patients, 1 patient (2%) had traveled to Vietnam, and 7 patients (13%) had an unclear contact history. All patients in the last group had a typical clinical course, and most had a positive PCR finding. There were seven clusters involving family members of 17 patients. Four women were pregnant. Underlying diseases included diabetes (four patients), hypertension (three patients), congestive heart failure (one patient), COPD (one patient), rheumatoid arthritis (one patient), chronic hepatitis B (one patient), and end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis (one patient). The mean incubation period from known exposure to the onset of fever was 6.0 Ϯ 1.8 days. Admission to an isolation unit occurred at a mean of 3.1 Ϯ 2.8 days after the onset of fever. All of the patients had fever as their initial symptom except for one 10-yearold girl. She was part of a family cluster and had a throat swab that yielded a positive PCR finding, despite a negative chest radiograph finding. The symptoms reported by the 53 patients at the time of isolation included chills (36 patients; 68%), general malaise (33 patients; 62%), myalgia (30 patients; 57%), headache (24 patients; 45%), dizziness (17 patients; 32%), and sore throat (13 patients; 25%) [ Table 1 ]. Cough eventually developed in 74% of patients (39 of 53 patients). However, only two patients had respiratory symptoms on FD 1, one of whom had COPD and one of whom had congestive heart failure. Both patients had a preexisting history of cough, dyspnea on exertion, and sputum production. Respiratory symptoms, including cough and dyspnea, developed at a mean of FD 4.5 Ϯ 1.9 (Fig 1) . GI symptoms included diarrhea or loose stools (35 patients; 66%), nausea (6 patients; 11%), vomiting (5 patients; 9%), or abdominal tenderness (5 patients; 9%), but only 4 patients (8%) had diarrhea on FD 1. *Data were collected during the initial isolation and observation before the SARS treatment protocol with ribavirin and corticosteroid therapy was instituted. †Data were collected during the hospitalization while the patients were receiving the SARS treatment protocol with ribavirin and corticosteroids and/or IV Ig and/or pulse therapy. ‡Some data were excluded from the analysis in patients with underlying diseases, including uremia, sepsis, heart failure, and hepatitis B infection, and also in children. §Above upper limit of normal. Ͼ 1.5 times upper limit of normal. ¶Six cases were managed early in the course of the outbreak before RT-PCR was available.
