The rate of NEC in this NICU during the outbreak pe- The median estimated gestational age of case-patients was 33 weeks (range, 27-37 weeks), and the median time from birth to NEC onset was 8 days (range, 5-81 days). Seven case-patients were male, and 4 were female. Distribution of staging was as follows: 3 stage I (suspect), 5 stage II (definite), and 3 stage III (advanced). All patients experiencing advanced NEC required surgical resection, and 1 died. No other infants died. Health care providers maintained a heightened index of suspicion (increased awareness of Bell's stage I criteria) for NEC for 2 months from the last identified patient. One case of NEC was identified 22 days (March 7) after the last case associated with the cluster. Although data were collected regarding this infant (by using 2 months of surveillance data), we decided to exclude it from the cluster under investigation because of the relatively substantial time between the preceding cluster and this case. The epidemic curve summarizing the time line for this outbreak is depicted in Fig 1, stratified by NEC staging. Each patient had multiple, previously recognized risk factors for NEC (Table 1) . Patients had a median of 5 (range, 3-8) risk factors for NEC. The median 1-minute (and 5 minute) APGAR scores for stages I, II, and III were 7 (8), 7 (9), and 6 (8), respectively. No appreciable patterns were detected regarding antibiotic use or other medications prescribed. Three of the infants' mothers (1 from each stage) had ,5 prenatal care visits. A total of 48 nurses cared for the patients in the 2 days before diagnosis. No single nurse or physician was identified as a common caregiver to all case-patients. No other health care providers were identified as potential common sources. Case-patients were distributed throughout the NICU. Three different organisms (Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter hormaechei) www.ajicjournal.org Vol. 38 No. 2 were isolated from blood cultures from 3 different patients, and C difficile toxin was detected in a fourth patient. No stool cultures were positive for enteric pathogens. Infant formula and HMF lot codes were not routinely recorded or tracked by the NICU staff. Seven (64%) of the case-patients received HMF before symptom onset, and 9 (82%) affected infants received 1 or more types of liquid formula. One affected infant was fed an amino acid-based formula and was not exposed to HMF or standard formula. Of the 4 lot codes of HMF tested, 1 contained 100 colony-forming units (cfu)/g of Bacillus cereus, 1 contained 10 cfu/g of B cereus, and 2 contained ,10 cfu/g of B cereus. No other bacteria were recovered from HMF, and all single-use liquid formula sampled tested negative for bacterial contamination. None of the infant blood specimens tested positive for B cereus, and stool samples were not specifically cultured for B cereus because it is not part of the standard microbiologic panel and there was no stool available for additional testing once the environmental tests were performed. The finding of 100 cfu/g of B cereus in 1 sample is at the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) upper microbiologic limit for healthy term infants. No limit is available for preterm infants. We recommended that patients be placed under contact isolation and reemphasized the need for strict adherence to hand hygiene and appropriate use of personal protective equipment for both health care personnel and visitors. A 1-time thorough environmental cleaning of the entire NICU was performed with a 1:10 dilution of household bleach (ie, 5000 parts/million of hypochlorite), and infants and nurses cohorted when possible. The hospital also elected to change to new lot codes of HMF and formula. Only 1 isolated case of NEC (previously mentioned) was detected 3 weeks following the implementation of these infection control measures; however, the NEC cluster possibly would have spontaneously resolved regardless.
