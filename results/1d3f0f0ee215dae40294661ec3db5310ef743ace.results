Temperature readings used for analysis came from 109 children aged 6 months to 16 years, distributed as follows: paired TT-ET and paired TT-AT readings, 43 boys, 62 girls, 6.1 ± 4.7 years; paired ET-AT readings, 46 boys, 63 girls, 6.1 ± 4.6 years. The range, mean, standard deviation, and distribution of the temperature readings are summarized in Table 1 . The range, mean, standard deviation, p value, and distribution of the differences for the various groups of differences are summarized in Table 2 . Bland-Altman plots for the three main groups of readings are given in Figures 3 to 5. All these readings were derived from 316 measurements, of which only 270 had complete sets of readings. Most of the patients had 3 measurements, but for various reasons as summarized in Table 3 , some patients had only one or two measurements, and some of the readings for a measurement were incomplete. The average ambient temperature in the ward was 23°C. The time intervals at which measurements were taken ranged from 5 minutes to 5 hours (163 ± 45 minutes). For four patients, the interval between the first and second measurements was relatively short, ranging from 5 to 17 minutes, for one of two reasons. First, the first measurement was taken just before a shift change and the second measurement just after. Second, the second measurement was taken shortly after the first for verification purposes. For one patient, the interval between the second and third measurements was 5 hours. A total of 271 TT readings were used for analysis. They occurred within 4.7 minutes (0.4 ± 0.5) of the recorded measurement start time, and 93.4% of them (253 readings) occurred within the first minute. For all measurements considered (Table 2) , the TT readings were on average 0.23°C lower than the ET readings and 0.21°C higher than the AT readings, and the ET readings were on average 0.43°C higher than the AT readings. The standard deviations of differences for these readings were identical to those computed using the modified Bland-Altman method, which takes into account repeated measurements. This confirms the validity of treating all the repeated measurements in this study as independent measurements. The mean differences for the various subranges ranged from −0.62°C to +0.31°C for the TT-ET readings and from −0.17°C to +0.30°C for the TT-AT readings. For all groups of TT-ET and TT-AT readings, the standard deviations ranged from 0.36°C to 0.54°C and the proportions of differences within ±0.5°C, ±1.0°C, and ±1.5°C ranged from 48.6% to 100%. The mean ET-AT differences for the various subranges ranged from 0.11°C to 0.65°C. For all groups of ET-AT readings, the standard deviations ranged from 0.33°C to 0.49°C, and the proportions of differences within ±0.5°C, ±1.0°C, and ±1.5°C ranged from 41.5% to 100%. All the p values were less than .05 (Table 3 ), indicating that the mean differences were statistically significant at the 5% level. A post hoc power analysis for the three main groups of readings gave the following minimum sample sizes required to achieve a power of 80%, 90%, and 98% at a significance level of 5%: TT-ET readings, 35, 46, and 70, respectively; TT-AT readings, 40, 53, and 80, respectively; ET-AT readings, 10, 13, and 18, respectively. On the basis of these results, we consider the sample sizes of 105 subjects for the TT-ET and TT-AT readings and 109 subjects for the ET-AT readings to be more than adequate. The linear regression lines of the Bland-Altman plots of Figures 3, 4 , and 5 exhibit gentle slopes of −0.258, −0.184, and +0.032°C/°C, respectively, and low correlation coefficients (r) of 0.309, 0.218, and 0.047, respectively. For Patient 88, the TT reading (36.7°C) for the third measurement was considerably lower than the corresponding AT (38.5°C) and ET (39.3°C) readings. We were unable to ascertain the cause of this outlier, which is evident in the Bland-Altman plots (Figures 3 and 4) . For Patient 26, the AT reading (34.9°C) for the first measurement was significantly lower than the corresponding ET reading (36.9°C); this measurement had no corresponding TT reading because the ThermoSENSOR was not given sufficient time to warm up to body temperature (Table 3) . We were also unable to ascertain the cause of this outlier ( Figure 5 ). The mean difference statistics and the proportion of differences for the TT-ET and TT-AT readings suggest that the temperatures recorded by the ThermoSENSOR were comparable to the ETs recorded by the Braun ThermoScan and the ATs recorded by the Terumo digital thermometer. We consider the mean differences of −0.23°C for the TT-ET readings and +0.21°C for the TT-AT readings to be clinically significant, so assessment of a patient's condition using ThermoSENSOR readings must take into account these differences.
