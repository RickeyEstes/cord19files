For the two guano samples analysed by metagenomics, 25 314 920 and 23 100 574 sequence reads were generated in total for the DNA and RNA metagenomes, respectively. In the DNA metagenome, 19.55, 0.28 and 6.92 % of reads were assigned to bacteria, eukaryotes and viruses, respectively (Fig. 1a) , with 79.65 % of virus reads assigned to bacteriophages (Fig. 1b) . In the RNA metagenome, 44.99, 5.44 and 0.38 % of reads were assigned to bacteria, eukaryotes and viruses, respectively (Fig. 1c) , with 82.63 % of virus reads assigned to the family Flaviviridae (Fig. 1d) , a virus group known to infect insects and thus consistent with the insectivorous diet of M. tuberculata. Less than 2 % of all virus sequence reads showed similarity to vertebrate viruses, with significant RAPSearch2 matches to conserved gene regions used for taxonomic assignment (i.e. capsid and/or helicase genes) of papillomavirus, picornavirus, polyomavirus, calicivirus and hepevirus.
