The specificity of the recombinant baculovirus-expressed FIPV N protein was investigated by ELISA and Western immunoblotting using MAbs. In the ELISA, two-fold serial dilutions of the recombinant N protein were immobilized on 96-well flat bottom Microelisa plates and reacted with MAb F80-1 against S protein, MAb F18-2 against M protein, or MAb E22-2 against N protein. As shown in Fig. 1A , the recombinant N protein did not react with F80-1 or F18-2, and reacted only with E22-2, which recognizes N protein. Similarly, the recombinant N protein reacted only with E22-2 on Western immunoblotting and a specific band was detected at the position corresponding to 45 kDa. The amount of the recombinant N protein antigen per dose of the vaccine was measured by Western immunoblotting using MAb E22-2. The amount of the antigen detected as a positive band up to 16-fold dilution (16 U per dose) by Western immunoblotting was contained in one dose of the vaccine (Fig. 1B) . Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to the FIPV antigens were investigated in the cats immunized with the recombinant N protein vaccine and the control cats. An increase in the ELISA value against FIPV virion-derived N protein was observed in Week 4 after the third immunization in all vaccinated cats in the first and second experiments (Fig. 2) . However, neutralizing antibody titers against the homologous strain KU-2 and the challenge virus strain 79-1146 did not increase even after the third immunization, and the titer was 1:10 or lower in all vaccinated cats. In the control cats immunized with SF-9 cell-derived antigen, neither the ELISA value nor neutralizing antibody titer increased. Three weeks after the third immunization, 0.1 ml of FIPV virion-derived N protein was intracutaneously injected into the vaccinated cats, and the induction of DTH skin response to the FIPV antigen was investigated. In the four vaccinated animals in the first experiment, swelling at the N protein-injected skin site was observed after 24 h and the swelling persisted until 72 h. In these cats, no swelling was observed at the PBS-injected skin site. In the second experiment, swelling was also observed at the N protein-injected skin site in the four vaccinated cats. In cat no. O-3 in the second experiment, transient swelling was observed at the PBS-injected skin site after 72 h. Fig. 3 shows the diameters of the swelling measured using a caliper in the cats in the first and second experiments. Four weeks after the third vaccination, all cats were challenged oronasally with 10 5 TCID 50 FIPV strain 79-1146. The antibody response to N protein, the neutralizing antibody titer against the challenge virus, changes in body weight, and the survival curves are shown in Table 1 , Fig. 2, Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. In all vaccinated cats, the ELISA value against N protein began to increase on Day 6 after the challenge and the antibody responded earlier than that in the control cats (Fig. 2) . The anti-challenge virus (strain 79-1146) neutralizing antibody production converted to positive on Day 12 after the challenge in the vaccination and control groups, showing no significant difference between the two groups (Table 1) . Samples obtained from oropharyngeal swabs collected every 3 days were inoculated with fcwf-4 cells to isolate the virus. The virus was isolated 3-9 days after the challenge from all cats in the vaccination and control groups, showing no significant difference in virus isolation. In the first experiment, the body weight gradually decreased and severe clinical disease developed in all cats in the control group, and the animals were euthanized 23-44 days after the FIPV challenge. The post-mortem examination findings were consistent with systemic pathological FIP disease. In contrast, in the vaccination group, cat Y-3 developed FIP but the other three animals developed no clinical signs of FIP during the 90-day observation period (Figs. 4 and 5) . Similarly, in the second experiment, three of four animals in the control group developed systemic pathological FIP disease 23-60 days after the FIPV challenge and were euthanized. In the vaccination group, only cat O-1 developed FIP but the other three animals tolerated the challenge (Figs. 4 and 5) . Combining the results of the first and second experiments, the survival rates were 75% (6/8) and 12.5% (1/8) for the immunized and control groups, respectively. These survival rates were analyzed using the Ï‡ 2 -test, and there was a significant difference (P < 0.05).
