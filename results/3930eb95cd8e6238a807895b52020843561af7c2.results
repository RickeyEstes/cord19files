In total, CDSs of 590 coronavirus complete genomes were collected from 8 coronavirus groups (229 E, NL63, HKU1, OC43, SARS, MERS, SARS-CoV-2 and unclassified) which can infect the human hosts. According to variations of codon compositions, the HKU1 and SARS were divided into 2 subgroups. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomic sequences of the representative coronavirus from each group is shown in Fig. 1A . Analysis results of the genetic codon compositions of 8 coronavirus groups (and subgroups) infect humans are shown in Fig. 1B . Comparison of Fig. 1A and B shows that the analysis based on the phylogenetic tree and viral genetic codon compositions are not completely consistent. For example, although NL63 and HKU1 belong to alpha and beta coronaviruses, respectively, they exhibit similar codon compositions. These results indicate that the analysis of genetic codon composition provides novel information that cannot be revealed in the phylogenetic analysis. It is interesting that the codon compositions of The distribution of overall proportions of human slow codons and slow di-codons in the coding sequences from 590 coronaviruses isolated from human hosts is shown in Fig. 2 . The order of overall proportions of human slow codons and slow di-codons is SARS2 < SARS1 < SARS-CoV-2 < unclassified y MERS < HKU1_2 y 229 E < OC43 < HKU1_1 < NL63. These results indicate that the SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV may have higher protein synthetic rates than other coronavirus groups which infect humans. Herfst et al. 11 propose a set of drivers facilitating human-to-human transmission of airborne pathogens with the aerosols and droplets as mediators in airspace between individuals (Fig. 4) . First, the airborne pathogens are carried with aerosols, droplets, or particulate matter, such as PM2.5, and transported through the air from donor to recipient. Second, airborne pathogens usually exhibit a relatively low 50% infectious dose (ID50) value. A low concentration of pathogens is sufficient for infection in the respiratory tract of the recipients. Third, after infection of susceptible cells, pathogens may amplify at the site of deposition or are disseminated from the primary deposition site to peripheral tissues (secondary site), where additional amplification takes place. Fourth, eventually, the recipient becomes the donor, and pathogens are expelled from the exit site (usually the respiratory tract). High infectious loads of the pathogens re-emerge in the air to complete the transmission cycle. According to the 4 steps, viruses with high protein synthesis rates (as a consequence, replication rates) have great advantages to increase transmissibility. Composition of human-specific slow codons and slow di-codons 5 First, fast-replication viruses can produce aerosols, droplets, or particulate matter with high viral loads that increase the remaining percentage of surviving viruses in environments before reaching the recipients. Second, after viruses reach the recipients, the fast replication viruses have a higher chance of successful infection even the initial when infection dose is low. The finding of this study provides an explanation other than virus-host receptor interactions for fast transmissibility of 2019-nCoV. High transmissibility does not necessarily result in high fatality. Data has shown that the order of transmissibility is 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV > MERS-CoV > other coronaviruses infect humans. In conclusion, conventional phylogenetic analysis of viral genomic sequences is useful for tracking the origin of viruses. Analysis of host-specific slow codon and di-codon composition provides links between viral genomic sequences and capability of viral protein synthesis in host cells for prediction and surveillance of transmission potential of emerging novel viruses.
