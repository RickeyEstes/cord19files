USP18 is induced in hepatocytes by LPS and TNF-␣ but not by IL-6 and IL-10. We have previously shown that USP18 can modulate the type 1 IFN response (14) . We sought to determine whether inflammatory stimuli could increase USP18 expression in hepatocytes. Liver tissue inflammation is mediated by both proand anti-inflammatory stimuli, acting through diverse pathways. We therefore compared the effects of three proinflammatory stimuli (TNF-␣, LPS, and IL-6) and one anti-inflammatory stimulus (IL-10), all four signaling through independent receptors and signaling cascades (38, 39) . In a 24-h time course experiment, USP18 mRNA expression was measured after stimulation with LPS (100 ng/ml), TNF-␣ (20 ng/ml), IL-6 (100 ng/ml), or IL-10 (10 ng/ml). USP18 mRNA expression was induced by TNF-␣ and LPS but not by IL-6 or IL-10 ( Fig. 1A) . Meanwhile, neither TNF-␣ nor LPS treatments had a marked effect on Mx1 mRNA expression (Fig. 1B) , indicating that the effects we observe are not due to a generalized upregulation of ISGs or to type 1 IFN signaling. TNF-␣ and LPS treatment also led to augmented USP18 protein expression by Western blotting (Fig. 1C ) and by intracellular staining (Fig. 1D to F). Treatment of Huh7.5 cells with TNF-␣ or LPS induced expression of USP18 in 74.1% Ϯ 8.9% and 70.5% Ϯ 5.2%, respectively, compared to untreated controls in which USP18 expression was 31.0% Ϯ 4.7% (Fig. 1Fi) . USP18 induction was also demonstrated with a significant shift in the mean fluorescence intensity of USP18 staining after TNF-␣ or LPS simulations (Fig. 1Fii ). In these assays, the degree of protein expression did not correlate completely with mRNA expression, a finding that is consistent with many genes in the liver (40) in that the degree of mRNA induction was higher than the observed USP18 protein expression. However, the functional effects we observed in terms of IFN-␣ responses were robust. TNF-␣ and LPS block IFN-␣ signaling in Huh7.5 hepatoma cells. To determine whether inflammatory stimuli such as TNF-␣ and LPS can interfere with type 1 IFN signaling, we sought to determine whether pretreatment of hepatoma cells with TNF-␣ or LPS blocked IFN-␣ signaling. Huh7.5 cells were treated with TNF-␣ (20 ng/ml) or LPS (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. The cells were subsequently treated with IFN-␣ for 6 h. We chose 6 h to measure Mx1 expression based on previous descriptions of IFN-stimulated Mx1 induction in the literature (41) and based on our observations with primary mouse hepatocytes. Control cells were left untreated, followed by a 6-h IFN-␣ treatment at 24 h. After the 6-h IFN-␣ treatment, the cells were harvested, and Mx1 expression was measured by qPCR as a measure of IFN-inducible gene expression. As expected, a 6-h exposure to IFN-␣ strongly induced Mx1 expression, whereas a 24-h exposure to TNF-␣ and LPS did not (Fig.  2, columns 2, 3, and 5 ). Both TNF-␣ and LPS pretreatment inhibited the effect of 6 h of exposure to IFN-␣ (Fig. 2, columns  2, 4, and 6 ), indicating that IFN-␣ signaling was impaired in the presence of these inflammatory stimuli.
