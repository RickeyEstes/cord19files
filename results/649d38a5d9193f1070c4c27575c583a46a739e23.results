In Vivo Protection Correlates with In Vitro Neutralizing Activity of mAbs We evaluated and compared the protective potential of six representative human mAbs following the protocol highlighted in Figure 1A . All these (ZK8-4, ZK5-2, ZK22F6, ZK2C2, ZK7C3, and ZK2B10) were isolated by our team. Two additional ZIKV Domain III (DIII)-specific mAbs (ZV67 and Z006) isolated by others were included for comparative analysis (Robbiani et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2016) . A human antibody, Middle East respiratory syndrome-4 (MERS-4), targeting the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was used as a negative control. Our mAbs were initially isolated from the peripheral B cells of a convalescent Chinese man who acquired ZIKV while traveling to Venezuela during the outbreak in 2016 . Specimens were derived from sequential blood samples collected on day 4 (ZK8-4), day 7 (ZK5-2), day 15 (ZK22F6), or day 106 (ZK2C2, ZK7C3, and ZK2B10) after symptom onset. They targeted the ZIKV E with varying degrees of binding and neutralizing activities and epitope specificities . For example, ZK2B10 and ZK7C3 were strictly ZIKV specific and demonstrated the most potent neutralizing activities, as measured by PRNT. Of these, ZK2B10 recognized DIII, while ZK7C3 was specific for Domain I/Domain II (DI/DII). In comparison, ZK8-4, ZK5-2, ZK22F6, and ZK2C2 were much less potent against ZIKV but cross-neutralized other members of the flavivirus family, such as dengue virus serotypes DENV1 and DENV2. On the ZIKV envelope, they targeted either DI/DII (ZK8-4, ZK5-2, and ZK22F6) or DI/DII/DIII (ZK2C2). In terms of genetic analyses, these antibodies demonstrated diverse heavy-chain variable regions. Two, ZK8-4 and ZK22F6, fell into the immunoglobulinheavy variable (IGHV)4-39 family, while ZK5-2 and ZK7C3 belonged to the IGHV3-23 family. Finally, ZK2B10 and ZK2C2 belonged to the IGHV1-8 and IGHV3-30 families, respectively. To test prophylactic activity against ZIKV infection, 5 mg/kg of each mAb was administered intraperitoneally to a group of three pregnant mice on embryonic day 14.5 ( Figure 1A ). The following day (E15.5), the developing littermate fetuses in each pregnant mouse were either left untouched (ZIKV À ; Figure 1A , blue) or inoculated with 350 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of ZIKV Asian strain GZ01 directly into the lateral ventricles of the brain (ZIKV + ; Figure 1A , red). The neonates were closely monitored after delivery and analyzed for a complementary set of clinical, virological, and neuropathological outcomes on post-natal day (P)3 and for survival up to P28. As shown in Figure 1B , the levels of protection conferred by the different mAbs varied considerably but clearly correlated with their neutralizing activities, as measured by half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (ICs 50 ) in the PRNT . The most potently neutralizing mAb, ZK2B10, conferred complete protection. Survival rates of infected fetuses were as high as 100% on P28. The next potent, ZK7C3, however, conferred only partial protection with median survival of 16 days. The two antibodies (ZV67 and Z006) isolated by others, together with the rest of the mAbs isolated by us, offered negligible protection and were virtually similar to the isotype control MERS-4. We also assessed impact on developing body weights and found weights measured on P3 closely correlated with the neutralizing activity. The ZIKV + neonates treated with the most potent mAbs, ZK2B10 and ZK7C3, had weight gain similar to that of their ZIKV À littermates. The ZIKV + neonates treated with ZV67, Z006, and the remaining mAbs failed to do so. The control ZIKV + MERS-4 group had the greatest loss in body weight. Next, we studied whether the protection pattern observed in the pregnant mice also occurred in non-pregnant mice. We administered 300 mg of each mAb (ZK8-4, ZK5-2, ZK22F6, ZK2C2, ZK7C3, ZK2B10, ZV67, and Z006) or isotype control MERS-4 to a group of four 4-to 6-week-old AG6 mice via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. The following day, animals were challenged with 10 4 PFUs of ZIKV Asian strain GZ01 via the i.p. route. Survival rates, body weight, and viral RNA copies in the blood were monitored for up to 14 days ( Figure 1D ). Consistent with the outcomes for pregnant mice, the level of protection in nonpregnant mice correlated with antibody neutralizing activities as measured by half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (ICs 50 ) in the PRNT ( Figure 1E ). For example, the most potent and protective mAb in pregnant mice, ZK2B10, provided complete protection in non-pregnant mice, with survival rates of 100% 14 days after the challenge. The next potent and protective, ZK7C3, conferred only partial protection, with median survival of 13 days. The rest of the tested mAbs, including the DIII-specific ones (ZV67 and Z006) isolated by others (Robbiani et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2016) , offered even lower levels of protection. ZK8-4 was virtually identical to the isotype control MERS-4. (D-G) Shown here: (D) timeline for mAb injection, ZIKV inoculation, and monitoring for (E) survival, (F) body weight, and (G) blood ZIKV RNA up to 14 days in AG6 mice. The body weight and ZIKV RNA in the whole blood derived from a single measurement showed distinct results among the study groups. The number of animals used in each group was four. All data are presented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ns, no significant. Similarly, changes in body weight measured over the 14-day follow-up also correlated with the neutralizing activities. The ZIKV + mice treated with ZK2B10 maintained relatively stable body weight throughout the study, although there was a noticeable decline after the first blood sample collection on day 5 (Figure 1F ). In contrast, ZIKV + mice treated with ZK7C3 lost substantial body weight beginning on day 9 post-challenge. Animals treated with the remaining mAbs had severe and rapid losses in body weight that coincided with a clinical deterioration (Figure 1E) . Lastly, for ZIKV + mice treated with ZK2B10, blood levels of viral RNA were indistinguishable from those measured in uninfected animals on both day 5 (2.23 ± 0.16 versus 2.54 ± 0.13) and day 13 (2.88 ± 0.34 versus 2.65 ± 0.13) after challenge ( Figure 1G ). However, RNA levels measured in ZK7C3-treated mice were, on average, 1 log greater on day 5 (3.29 ± 0.17 versus 2.23 ± 0.16) and more than 3 logs greater on day 13 (6.30 ± 0.06 versus 2.88 ± 0.34), compared to ZK2B10. The remaining mAbs failed to suppress viral replication. The measured ZIKV RNA load on day 5 ranged from 3.82 to 5.16 logs higher than that of ZK2B10, depending on the mAb used ( Figure 1G ). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the protective patterns of each mAb were similar in both pregnant and non-pregnant mice and closely mirrored their respective in vitro neutralizing activities.
