The photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 was enhanced by Ag metal doping. TiO 2 and Ag-doped TiO 2 were coated on porous polyurethane (PU) using C-Si-O-Ti bonds. Increased adsorption ability of the photocatalyst was due to the porosity of the PU. Removal of E. coli from an aerosol was only by adsorption with PU and TiO 2 /PU. Under visible light, E. coli was removed by adsorption and photo-oxidation with Ag-TiO 2 /PU. We investigated a novel approach by synthesizing an integrated material, which could act as both adsorbent and photocatalytic material, for bioaerosol purification under visible light conditions. Ag was used as a dopant agent to enhance photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 , leading to high photocatalytic activity of the doped TiO 2 even under visible light. Under visible light, the doped TiO 2 photocatalyst could produce oxy radicals, oxidative agents, that participate in oxidation reactions to decompose important organic components of bacteria, leading to death or removal of bacteria from an aerosol. Adsorption property was integrated into the enhanced TiO 2 photocatalyst by using polyurethane (PU), a honeycomb structure material, as a substrate for coating process of the doped TiO 2 . Three materials including pristine PU, TiO 2 coating on PU (TiO 2 /PU), and Ag-doped TiO 2 coating on PU (Ag-TiO 2 /PU) were used to remove Escherichia coli in an aerosol under visible light. Under dark conditions, the removal capacities of E. coli in the aerosol by PU, TiO 2 /PU, and Ag-TiO 2 /PU were 1.2 Â 10 5 , 2.7 Â 10 5 , and 6.2 Â 10 5 (CFU/cm 3 ), respectively. Under visible light irradiation, the removal capacities of E. coli in an aerosol by PU, TiO 2 /PU, and Ag-TiO 2 /PU were 1.2 Â 10 5 , 2.7 Â 10 5 , and 1.8 Â 10 6 (CFU/cm 3 ), respectively. The improvement of the removal capacity by TiO 2 /PU and Ag-TiO 2 /PU, versus PU, is due to adsorption alone and the combination of adsorption plus photocatalytic activity, respectively.
