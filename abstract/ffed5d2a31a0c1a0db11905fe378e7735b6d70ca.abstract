We trimmed the poly-A adaptors from the reads using Cutadapt 2 (version 1.8.3), and utilized Bowtie 3 (version 1.1.1) to map them to the E. coli-lambda transcriptome. In the first phase, we discarded reads that mapped to rRNA and tRNA sequences with Bowtie parameters '-n 2 -seedlen 23 -k 1 --norc'. In the second phase, we mapped the remaining reads to the transcriptome with Bowtie parameters '-v 2 -a --strata --best -norc -m 200'. We attempted to extend alignments to their maximal length by comparing the polyA adaptor with the aligned transcript until reaching the maximal allowed error (2 mismatches across the read, with 3'-end mismatches avoided). We filtered out reads longer than 31-nt and shorter than 21-nt. Unique alignments were first assigned to the ribosome occupancy profiles. For multiple alignments, the best alignments in terms of number of mismatches were kept. Then, multiple aligned reads were distributed between locations according to the distribution of unique ribosomal reads in the respective surrounding regions. To this end, a 100-nt window was used to compute the read count density (total read counts in the window divided by length, based on unique reads) in vicinity of the M multiple aligned positions in the transcriptome, and the fraction of a read assigned to each position was . The location of the A-site was approximated by an 11nt shift from the 5' end of the aligned read. This shift maximized the correlation between MTDR (described below) and the observed read densities per E. coli gene. Ribosome profiling data normalization. We began the analysis by reconstructing ribosome profiles for E. coli and Bacteriophage Lambda expressed genes. The ribosome profiling method produces ribosome footprint counts that are proportional to the time spent in decoding each codon of all translated transcripts in a genome, at single nucleotide resolution. To avoid analyzing ribosomal profiles of genes with many missing read counts (RCs) that may result in a non-reliable estimation of the local ribosome density, genes profiles with fewer than 30 percent non-zero read counts were further filtered. Previous studies indicated an increase of RCs at the beginning of the ORF 4 and for some organisms at the end of ORF 4,5 ; therefore the first and last 20 codons were excluded when determining these thresholds or when calculating the average RCs per ORF. To enable comparison and analysis of RCs of codons of the same type originating from different genes, RCs of each
