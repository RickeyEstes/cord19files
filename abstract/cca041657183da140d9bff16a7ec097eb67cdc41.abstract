A temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus was inoculated intranasally into inlant Sprague Dawley rats aged 9 to 17 days. Rats receiving the virus at 9 days ol'age had an extensive spread of int'ection throughout the brain and the animals died after a few days. Rats inoculated at day I I postnatally survived and the infection was limited to the olfactory pathways, hypothalamus, diagonal bands and the anterior raphe nuclei. Stereological measurements showed that the volume of infected neurons constituted 67+ 10% of the total neuronal volume in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Doublelabelling experiments revealed that both 5-hydroxytryptamine-and substance P-immunoreactive neurons contained the virus antigen. The motor stimulant effect of amphetamine was studied at 3 months post infection. The increase in amphetamine-induced frequency and duration of rearing was significantly attenuated in infected rats and the amphetamine-induced locomotion was slightl~ reduced.
