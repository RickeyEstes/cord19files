The oral cavity is one of the initial areas examined when a patient presents with complaints of cough, cold, or sore throat. An understanding of the infectious processes affecting this area and how to diagnose them accurately is irnp~rtant.'~ Visits to physicians for symptomatic complaints related to possible infections of the oral cavity are a common occurrence. Not only is it important to accurately determine the entity causing an infectious syndrome so that appropriate therapy may be given, it is also important because these interactions with the healthcare system likely result in a large amount of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. For example, a recent report by Mainous et a14' found that 60% of over 2000 patients seeking medical care were given at least one of 19 different antimicrobial agents for acute nasopharyngitis (the common cold). Less than 2% had an accompanying bacterial sinusitis or otitis.
