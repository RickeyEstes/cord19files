It efficiently describes diseases in which a cross immune class (C) is present, along with the susceptible (S), the infected (I) and the removed (R) ones. Controlling epidemic diseases corresponds to the introduction of vaccination, quarantine and treatment strategies; generally only one of these actions is considered. In this paper the possibility of optimal controls both over the susceptible and the infected subjects is assumed, taking into account also limitations of resources. A suitable cost index is introduced and via the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle the optimal control strategy is determined and the existence of the optimal solution is assessed. Numerical results are developed analyzing the effects of different control strategies. (N. Stasio). protected one (R). Therefore the obtained SIRC model takes into account temporary partial immunity and may well describe, for example, influenza A. The study of mathematical models for epidemics allows the evaluation of the effects of different control strategies: the scheduling of a proper vaccination campaign [3, 4] , the screening and educational campaigns [5], isolation policy [6], the resource allocation [5, 7] . An encouraging approach lies in the framework of the optimal control theory; interesting reviews can be found in [8] . Analytical results on the optimal control problems for epidemics were extensively described in [9] , where models with control by vaccination, quarantine, screening or health campaigns were studied with a rather general choice for the interaction function. Different kind of infectious disease calls for different models and strategies. In [10] the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) disease was considered to find the strategy of tracing and quarantining contacts of identified cases; 0169-2607/$ -see front matter
