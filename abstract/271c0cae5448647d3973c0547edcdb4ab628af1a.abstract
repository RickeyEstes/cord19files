Although the term virtual screening as the in silico analog of high throughput screening has been coined only a decade ago, virtual screening is now a widespread lead identification method in the pharmaceutical industry. A myriad of different methods have been developed exploiting the growing library of target structures and assay data as a basis for finding new lead structures. Exploiting synergies between different methods best utilizes the information available and is at the center of recent developments. The reliability of virtual screening needs to be improved: For SBVS, more reliable scoring functions are needed. LDVS descriptors that reliably facilitate scaffold hopping are essential. For regression and classification approaches applicability domains need to be extended. Synergies between all VS methods need to be realized. Rather than finding 'ligand-like' compounds VS needs to focus on improving methods to find 'lead-like' compounds. A compound with good molecular potency alone rarely results in a good lead or drug candidate.
