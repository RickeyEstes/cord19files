Host-pathogen interactions provide valuable systems for the study of evolutionary genetics and natural selection. The sequestration of essential iron has emerged as a crucial innate defense system termed nutritional immunity, leading pathogens to evolve mechanisms of 'iron piracy' to scavenge this metal from host proteins. This battle for iron carries numerous consequences not only for host-pathogen evolution but also microbial community interactions. Here we highlight recent and potential future areas of investigation on the evolutionary implications of microbial iron piracy in relation to molecular arms races, host range, competition, and virulence. Applying evolutionary genetic approaches to the study of microbial iron acquisition could also provide new inroads for understanding and combating infectious disease. The outcome of an infection can have profound consequences for both host and pathogen populations. Intense selective pressures make host-pathogen interactions an attractive biological model to study evolutionary genetics over relatively short intervals of time. To date, much work has focused on rapid evolution involving canonical host immune defenses or antibiotic resistance [1, 2] . However, we now know that hosts possess numerous additional means to restrict pathogens, including factors engaged in other core physiological functions. Nutrient iron sequestration provides one such alternative mode of host defense against bacteria and eukaryotic pathogens [3] . Iron is an essential micronutrient for microbes, as well as their hosts, due to its ability to readily shift between ferrous (Fe 2+ ) and ferric (Fe 3+ ) oxidative states for redox catalysis or electron transport. This ability to readily accept and donate electrons also makes iron highly volatile, necessitating a well-coordinated iron transport and storage system in metazoans to prevent the production of toxic free radicals [4] . The sequestration of free iron by host proteins simultaneously prevents acquisition by microbes, a protective effect termed nutritional immunity (see Glossary) [5, 6] . While appreciation has grown for the role of nutrient metals in infection, these 'battles for iron' and other trace metals provide intriguing cases for investigation from an evolutionary perspective. Here we discuss emerging questions on the control of iron in microbial infection and highlight recent and potential future insights regarding the evolution of molecular arms races, host range, microbial competition, and pathogen virulence.
