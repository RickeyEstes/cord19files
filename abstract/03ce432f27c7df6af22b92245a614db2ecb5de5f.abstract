Human astroviruses are small nonenveloped viruses with positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes that contain three main open reading frames: ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2. Astroviruses cause acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide and have been associated with encephalitis and meningitis in immunocompromised individuals. Through comparative genomic analysis of >400 astrovirus sequences, we identified a conserved "ORFX" overlapping the capsid-encoding ORF2 in genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses. ORFX appears to be subject to purifying selection, consistent with it encoding a functional protein product, termed XP. Using ribosome profiling of cells infected with human astrovirus 1, we confirm initiation at the ORFX AUG. XP-knockout astroviruses are strongly attenuated and after passaging can partly restore viral titer via pseudo-reversions, thus demonstrating that XP plays an important role in virus growth. To further investigate XP, we developed an astrovirus replicon system. We demonstrate that XP has only minor effects on RNA replication and structural protein production. Instead, XP associates with the plasma membrane with an extracellular N-terminus topology and promotes efficient virus release. Using two different assays, we show that expression of human or related astrovirus XPs leads to cell permeabilization, suggesting a viroporin-like activity. The discovery of XP advances our knowledge of these important human viruses and opens a new direction of research into astrovirus replication and pathogenesis. They are considered to be the second most common cause of gastroenteritis in infants after rotavirus 1 . Recently, and especially in immunocompromised individuals, astroviruses have also .

Despite their undoubted importance, astroviruses still represent one of the least studied groups of human positive-sense RNA viruses. The genome contains three main open reading frames: ORF1a encoding a nonstructural polyprotein (nsP1a), ORF1b encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and ORF2 encoding the capsid protein (CP) (Fig. 1A) 3 . ORF1a and ORF1b are translated from the genomic RNA (gRNA), with expression of ORF1b depending on programmed ribosomal frameshifting whereby a proportion of ribosomes translating ORF1a make a −1 nucleotide shift into ORF1b. Frameshifting occurs at a conserved A_AAA_AAC sequence within the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap region and depends on a 3′-adjacent stimulatory RNA stem-loop structure 4 . ORF2 is translated from a subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) that is produced during virus infection. Previously, using comparative genomics we identified a conserved fourth ORF (ORFX) in genogroup I astroviruses, which appears to be subject to purifying selection and therefore is likely to encode a functional protein product, termed the X protein (XP, 12 kDa, 112 aa) 5 . ORFX overlaps the 5′ region of the capsid-encoding ORF2 and is predicted to be translatable via ribosomal leaky scanning, which is expected to be enhanced by the very short leader on the sgRNA 3,6,7 . However, despite the comparative genomic predictions, the existence, relevance, and function of XP have never been demonstrated. Here we perform a functional molecular dissection of ORFX, providing insight into the simultaneous orchestration of several overlapping functional elements in a small human-pathogenic RNA virus. We show that ORFX is translated during virus infection, XP knockout mutant viruses are highly attenuated, and XP is a transmembrane (TM) protein that promotes efficient virus release via a viroporin-like activity. Through an extended bioinformatic analysis, we predict that related XP proteins are widely encoded in other mammalian astroviruses including the divergent "MLB" group of human-infecting astroviruses. Comparative genomic analysis reveals a potential ORFX in genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses. Since there are many more astrovirus sequences available now than in 2010, we began by repeating our previous comparative genomic analysis but this time also extending to other astrovirus genogroups. All mammalian astrovirus complete or nearly complete genome sequences were obtained from the
