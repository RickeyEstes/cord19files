Diseases of the feline nose are relatively common and include neoplasia, rhinitis, foreign bodies, fungal infections, and polyps. Treatment protocols often include surgical techniques such as biopsies, rhinotomy or nasal planectomy. Complications of nasal procedures can be major but these can be minimized by careful preoperative diagnosis and planning. The nose consists of the nasal planum, the nasal cavities or fossae divided by the nasal septum, and the choanae that mark the start of the nasopharynx (Fig. 54-1) . The nasal fossae are divided by a dorsal concha (the extension of an endoturbinate), a curved shelf of bone originating from the ethmoidal crest. The dorsal concha (previously nasoturbinate) separates the dorsal cavity into the dorsal meatus and the middle meatus. Ventrally, the ventral nasal concha (previously maxilloturbinate) extends from the conchal crest and divides into several delicate bony scrolls. The concha divides the nasal cavity into the middle meatus and ventral meatus before forming the alar fold rostrally. Caudally, the ethmoturbinates extend from the midline ethmoidal plate to the cribriform plate; these ethmoid tubinates fill the presphenoid sinus and continue up into the frontal sinus. The ethmoturbinates can be divided into long, medially lying endoturbinates (usually seven in the cat) and smaller, more superficial ectoturbinates. The nasopharyngeal meatus is formed by the confluence of the caudal ends of the dorsal, middle, and ventral meatuses and runs to the choanae. The turbinates are covered by mucosa and act to direct the inspired air into the meatuses and humidify inspired air prior to passage to the lungs. They also act as a heat exchange mechanism and remove inhaled foreign material. The nasal planum is pigmented and consists of tough, thickened keratinized squamous epithelium. The philtrum marks the midline and separates the two nares. The external nares are supported by the dorsolateral cartilage, ventrolateral cartilage, accessory cartilage, and cartilaginous septum. The dorsolateral cartilage is the largest of the nasal cartilages and merges with the ventral nasal concha (maxilloturbinate). The olfactory receptors are located mainly on the ethmoturbinates and thus are in the caudodorsal section of the nasal cavity. The nasal mucosa is well vascularized and innervated. The blood supply originates from the maxillary artery that arborizes into the sphenopalatine and major palatine branches before continuing as the infraorbital artery. The sphenopalatine artery supplies the nasal conchae, and its terminal branches are known as the caudal lateral nasal arteries. Lymphatic drainage is to the retropharyngeal, parotid, and submandibular lymph nodes.
