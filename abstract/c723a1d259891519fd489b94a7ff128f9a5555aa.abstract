To gain insight into the potential for aerosolization of viruses in wastewater systems, we investigated the partitioning of MS2 and Phi6 bacteriophages in synthetic sludge and anaerobically digested sludge from a wastewater treatment plant. We evaluated partitioning among the liquid, solids, and material surfaces of porcelain, concrete, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polypropylene. In all cases, at least 94% of the virions partitioned into the liquid fraction. In real sludge, no more than 0.8% of virions partitioned to the solids and no more than 6% to the material surface. Both MS2 and Phi6 partitioned more to the surface of concrete and polypropylene than to the surface of porcelain or PVC. Partitioning of viruses in wastewater among the liquid, biosolids, and material surface does not appear to mitigate the potential for aerosolization of virus, as most of the virus remains in the liquid phase.

Concentration of Phi6 bacteriophage, determined by qPCR and reported in PFU equivalents per milliliter, in anaerobically digested sludge diluted 5-fold in water in each of three phases: 46 mL of liquid, 4 mL of wetted solids, and 1 mL of material surface extract for porcelain, concrete, PVC, and polypropylene. Each point represents an experimental replicate, and there are three nearly overlapping points for solids in concrete.
