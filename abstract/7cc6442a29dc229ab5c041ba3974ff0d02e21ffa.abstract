Homology modeling with other 3CL pro 's [12, 15], X-ray crystallography [13], and a recent mutagene-McMaster University Hamilton, Ontario L8N 3Z5 sis study [16] have identified 3CL pro as a cysteine protease with a Cys-His catalytic dyad in the active site.

The main proteinase of SARS-CoV, 3CL pro , is an attractive target for therapeutics against A structural model of 3CL pro based on sequence homology with TGEV [12] as well as the solved crystal SARS owing to its fundamental role in viral replication.
