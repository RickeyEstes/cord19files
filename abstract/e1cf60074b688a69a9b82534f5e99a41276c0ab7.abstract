Bioactive materials with antibacterial properties have significant medical interest. Antibacterial bioactive materials can be prepared by simple combination of antibacterial substances with materials such as hydrogels, ceramics, metals, and polymers, in different forms, such as fibres, foams, films or gels. The delivery of the antibacterial molecules will lead to the killing of bacteria. Another approach is to design the material itself to possess the antibacterial properties, especially at the surface of the material. The applications have been found in orthopaedics and cardiovascular grafts, as a means of reducing the incidence of infection. In the wound care industry, using antibacterial bioactive materials to control infection is always the first line for wound treatment. However, there are still considerable limitations, including the difficulty in treatment of the infection at depth, the control of the biofilm formation, and the development of generic and specific antibacterial bioactive materials. In future, bioactive materials based on biomimetic materials with antibacterial properties will be developed from natural resources to minimize the negative impact on the human body. These Gram-positive organisms include: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Reports from several centralized agencies that follow bacterial resistance trends indicate that the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has increased from 25 to 37% and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE) from 35 to 65% in the last 3 years alone. These resistant organisms represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). However, the problem of resistant Gram-positive organisms is not limited to the hospitalized patient. Outpatients have also been affected, with the emergence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), a cause of community-acquired pneumonia [1]. Hospital-acquired infections and the healthcare environment have attracted considerable worldwide attention in the past few years, owing to many occurrences and outbreaks of MRSA and VRE caused morbidity and mortality. The search for methodologies to prevent and treat infections is currently an important clinical topic. It has been estimated that the current global anti-infective market is valued at US$66.5 billion, with bioactive antibacterial agents accounting for over 50% of sales. The antibacterial market is set to grow to over US$45.0 billion by 2012, driven by the uptake of newer antibacterial agents, such as glycopeptides and carbapenems, which demonstrate resistance to MRSA and VRE, as well as other emerging strains. Pharmaceutical companies continue to develop a new generation of antibacterial agents, such as cephalosporins, macrolides, and quinolones, to overcome the major issue of drug resistance. In addition, a number of new drug classes, effective in multi-drug-resistant organisms, such as dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (DHFRs), are under evaluation [2] . In this chapter, the focus is on bioactive materials with antibacterial functionality for use in the medical device related health care industry, for example, wound care [3], dental and orthopaedics [4, 5] , and cardiovascular. The antibacterial materials discussed in this chapter include: antibacterial inorganic polymers, such as bioglass, ceramics, glass-ceramics, and zeolites; antibacterial composites, such as bone cement; antibacterial metal; antibacterial polymers and plastics (Fig. 5.1 ). Antibacterial materials Antibacterial ceramics have recently received great attention, because of their wide range of applications, including electronics and medical applications, and various forms, such as fibres, fabrics, building materials, Bioactive materials in medicine
