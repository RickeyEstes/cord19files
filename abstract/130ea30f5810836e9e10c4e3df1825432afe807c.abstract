674 22. SPECIAL SENSES II. SYSTEMS TOXICOLOGIC PATHOLOGY ocular tissues. These properties are acquired during development and must be maintained throughout life if the function of the eye is to remain intact. The eye can be divided into three basic layers or tunics: (1) the fibrous tunic, the external part of the eye composed of the corneal and sclera; (2) the uveal tract, internal to the fibrous tunic and composed of the iris, ciliary body, and choroid, which houses the vascular supply to the eye; and (3) the internal neural layer, composed of the retina and optic nerve head. The eye can be further divided into anterior and posterior segments, the first consisting of the cornea, anterior and posterior chambers, iris, ciliary body, and lens, and the second composed of the vitreous and vitreal space, retina, choroid, sclera, and optic nerve. The eyelids' primary function in mammals is protection of the ocular surface from exposure or from the FIGURE 22A.1 Embryology of the mammalian eye. (A) Developing eye from a mid-term (gestational day 128) equine embryo showing the developing neuroretina [thick C-shaped layer lining the deep portion of the globe and encircling the lens vesicle ( Ã )] and the optic stalk [or primitive optic nerve (arrowhead)]. (B) Near-term mouse fetus showing the primary vitreous ( Ã ) between the lens (pale eosinophilic orb at the top) and retina (thick multilaminar layer at the bottom). (C) Near-term mouse fetus showing the fused eyelids; the arrowhead points to the cleft where the palpebrae (eyelids) will eventually separate. (D) Lens from a near-term mouse fetus showing the tunica vascularis lentis [as small, regularly spaced capillary cross-sections along the posterior (upper) edge of the lens].
