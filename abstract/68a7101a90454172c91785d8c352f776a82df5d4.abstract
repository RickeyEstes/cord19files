Scar-free regeneration of tissues and organs occurs in many fish and amphibians, but in mammals is restricted to certain organs during embryonic and early fetal stages. Regeneration of amputated appendages in zebrafish and urodele amphibians (salamanders and newts) involves cellular reprogramming and proliferation at the injury site, with patterning, growth of a regeneration blastema and redifferentiation of the missing tissues. Unlike organ development in the embryo, regeneration resembles wound repair in requiring transient inflammation produced by injury. Limb blastema growth also requires factors derived from re-growing nerve axons. Why the repair process in amputated mammalian limbs does not transition to the developmental program for a new limb remains a key question in regenerative biology. Anuran amphibians (frogs and toads) can regenerate developing hindlimbs during premetamorphosis, but this ability is lost as the limbs complete development and the larvae approach metamorphosis. In the frog Xenopus laevis the gradual loss of regenerative capacity begins as cells of the adaptive immune system become functional. Analyses of gene expression and proteomic changes in amputated hindlimbs of Xenopus larvae indicated that inflammation and its resolution are up-regulated more strongly and persistently at regeneration-incompetent stages than in younger, regenerating limbs and indicated that changes in the inflammatory response may interfere with important aspects of limb regeneration. Immunosuppressive agents or knockdown of immune cell differentiation have been shown to restore the transient loss of regenerative ability in Xenopus tails. Similar agents improve regenerative ability of larval hindlimbs. Brief exposure of amputated, regenerationcompetent limbs to solutions of beryllium, a persistent immune adjuvant, inhibits regeneration. Beryllium causes a stronger and more persistent up-regulation of genes related to both inflammation and resolution compared to control, regenerating limbs. Limb stumps treated with this adjuvant also have normal expression levels of several markers for cellular dedifferentiation and reprogramming (such as Sall4), but fail to express key genes required for normal patterning of the regeneration blastema. This work will be reviewed, along with other important studies in the growing body of evidence that in vertebrates cells of the developing immune system determine the capacity for organ and appendage regeneration.
