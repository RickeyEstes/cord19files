An 18-month-old, 1.24-kg male castrated ferret was presented to the University of Illinois Veterinary Teaching Hospital (Urbana, IL USA) for a 4-week history of lethargy, inappetance, possible straining to urinate/defecate, and swelling with erythema of the gingiva adjacent to the left maxillary canine. A leukocytosis and hyperglobulinemia were also noted by the referring veterinarian 1 week before presentation. The patient was quiet, inquisitive, and alert on initial presentation, but became notably depressed soon thereafter. Body condition score was an estimated 3 out of 5. The patient was painful on manipulation of the mouth, likely because of the gingival swelling and erythema. Thoracic auscultation revealed a sinus arrhythmia and mild end-inspiratory wheeze with possible mild expiratory effort. Temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate were 98.6Â°F, 250 beats/min, and 42 breaths/min, respectively. Abdominal palpation revealed an enlarged spleen and pain on caudal abdominal manipulation. No other abnormalities were detected on physical examination. Based on the history and physical examination findings, the ferret was admitted for additional diagnostic testing and therapy. The ferret was anesthetized via facemask with 5% isoflurane (Iso-Flo; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL USA) and oxygen (1 L/min). Once the animal was induced, it was maintained at 1.5% isoflurane and 1 L/min oxygen. A blood sample (2 mL) was collected from the cranial vena cavae and submitted for a complete blood count (CBC) and plasma biochemistry testing.
