 People with positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA of respiratory tract specimen are infectious source of COVID-19.  SARS-CoV-2 RNA of respiratory tract specimen may be persistent or recurrent positive during the course.  Dynamic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA should be performed for infectivity assessment. The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan, China, has constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, with cases confirmed in multiple countries. Currently patients are the main source of infection. We report a confirmed case of COVID-19 whose oropharyngeal swab test of SARS-CoV-2 RNA turned positive in convalescence. This case highlights the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 importance of dynamic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for infectivity assessment.
