In blue: comments regarding technical implementation and national application. In red: notes with information on the question for the participants. Where the options is "pick only one" (e.g. Intake Q1) = filled bullet points; Where it is "pick all that apply" (e.g. Intake Q5) = open bullet points. This latter option will need some built in checks, since "No" is often an option we would want to retain. Individuals who have unsubscribed from the newsletter/project or stopped reporting (no report for at least 6 weeks), should be prompted to fill in this short, separate questionnaire.
