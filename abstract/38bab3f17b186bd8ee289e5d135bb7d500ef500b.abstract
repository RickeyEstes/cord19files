Pockets of susceptibility resulting from spatial or social heterogeneity in vaccine coverage can drive 16 measles outbreaks, as cases imported into such pockets are likely to cause further transmission and lead 17 to large transmission clusters. Characterising the dynamics of transmission is essential for identifying 18 which individuals and regions might be most at risk. 19 As data from detailed contact tracing investigations are not available in many settings, we combined 20 age, location, genotype, and onset date of cases in order to probabilistically reconstruct the importation 21 status and transmission clusters within a newly developed R package called o2geosocial. 22 We compared our inferred cluster size distributions to 737 transmission clusters identified through 23 detailed contact-tracing in the United States between 2001 and 2016. We were able to reconstruct the 24 importation status of the cases and found good agreement between the inferred and reference clusters. 25 The results were improved when the contact-tracing investigations were used to set the importation 26 status before running the model. 27
