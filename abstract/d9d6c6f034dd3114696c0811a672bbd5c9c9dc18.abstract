T his issue marks the second time that an issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases has been devoted to zoonotic diseases; the first zoonoses issue was published 1 year ago, in December 2004. The publication of this second theme issue attests to the frequency, visibility, and attention that these diseases are receiving. A year ago, we commented on several prevailing factors worldwide that facilitate the emergence of zoonotic infectious diseases, among them a growing human population, increased interaction between species, global climate changes, and rapid movement of people and animals (1). These factors continue to exert their influence, and we continue to see a plethora of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases. In their book Beasts of the Earth: Animals, Humans, and Disease, Torrey and Yolken point out that domestic and international public health and animal health agencies have a long history of poor coordination and little effort to bridge the gulf between these 2 professional worlds (2). The authors suggest that we must learn to cooperate if we are to effectively combat emerging microbial threats. In the past year, improved cooperation has been evident. We have observed early detection and response to several important zoonotic diseases threatening the public's health. These responses were made possible by several strategic partnerships across human and animal health sectors-partnerships that have been long in the making. As this issue goes to press, the year has been bracketed by several major natural disasters in 2 hemispheres-the tsunami in Southeast Asia, hurricanes in North America, and the earthquake in Pakistan and India. These events underscore the fragility of our society and the importance of working in partnerships to effectively protect and promote the health of all persons in challenging times. In the United States, understanding the potential threat for zoonotic disease outbreaks in natural disaster settings, local and state agencies and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have worked in partnership
