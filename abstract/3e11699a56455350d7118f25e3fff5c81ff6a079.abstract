The display of peptide segments on the surface of bacteria offers many new and exciting applications in biotechnology and medical research . Fimbria-assisted display of heterologous sequences is a paradigm for chimeric organelle display on bacteria. Fimbriae are particularly attractive candidates for epitope display for several reasons: (1) they are present in extremely high numbers at the cell surface, (2) they are strong immunogens, (3) they possess inherent adhesive properties, and (4) they can be easily purified. The majority of work dealing with fimbria-assisted peptide display has been foc-tlsed on the development of recombinant vaccines. A number of different fimb rial types have been used to display imm une-relevant sectors of various foreign protein s. Chimeric fimbria I vaccines can be used in the context of purified proteins, however the potential also exists to exploit this technology for th e development of live recombinant vaccines. Work has also been performed demonstrating the amenability of fimbriae towards the powerful technology of random peptide display. This review summarises the current state of researc h in this field.
