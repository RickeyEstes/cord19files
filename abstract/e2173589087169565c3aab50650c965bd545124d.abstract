Objective: To assess virus-specific hospitalization rates, risk factors for illness severity, and seasonal trends in children hospitalized with acute respiratory infections (ARI). Setting: A government hospital serving low-and middle-income population in Amman, Jordan. Participants: Children under two years old hospitalized with fever and/or respiratory symptoms (n=3168) from 3/16/2010-3/31/2013. Children with chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and newborns who had never been discharged after birth were excluded from the study. Outcome Measures: Hospitalization rates and markers of illness severity: admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation (MV), oxygen therapy, length of stay (LOS), and death. Of the 3168 subjects, 2581 (82%) had at least one respiratory virus detected, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) being the most predominant pathogen isolated. During admission, 1013 (32%) received oxygen therapy, 284(9%) were admitted to ICU, 111(4%) were placed on MV, and 31(1%) children died. Oxygen therapy was higher in RSV only subjects compared to human rhinovirus only (42% vs 29%, p<0.001), adenovirus only (42% vs 21%, p<0.001), and human parainfluenza virus only (42% vs 23% p<0.001) subjects. Underlying medical condition was associated with oxygen therapy (aOR 1.95, 95% CI 1.49-2.56), ICU admission (aOR 2.51, 95%CI 1.71-3.68), MV (1.91, 95% CI 1.11-3.28), and longer LOS (aOR1.71, 95% CI 1.37-2.13). Similarly, younger age was associated with oxygen therapy (0.23, 95% CI 0.17-0.31), ICU admission (aOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.74), MV (0.28, 95% CI 0.15-0.53), and longer LOS (aOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.38-0.59). Pneumonia was strongly associated with longer LOS (aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.65-2.60), oxygen therapy (aOR 2.94, 95% CI 2.22-3.89), ICU admission (aOR 3.12, 95% CI 2.16-4.50), and MV (aOR 3.33, 95% CI 1.85-6.00). Virus-specific hospitalization rates ranged from 0.5-10.5 per 1000 children. Respiratory viruses are associated with severe illness in Jordanian children hospitalized with ARI. Prevention strategies such as extended breastfeeding, increased access to palivizumab and RSV vaccine development could help decrease hospitalization rates and illness severity, particularly in young children with underlying medical conditions. For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml BMJ Open Bashir Hospital is one of the three major government hospitals in Amman, which is Jordan's largest city and capital. 12 It was estimated that during the study period, the hospital provided care for â‰ˆ55% of all children in Amman (author SF, unpublished data). Additionally, 17,557 children were admitted to the pediatric wards, 11,230 (64%) of whom were under two years of age. After consent, trained local research staff obtained blood either by heel stick or venipuncture, as well as nasal and throat swabs. Standardized questionnaires were used to record demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic data. Parents were queried in Arabic, and bilingual research staff transcribed the information into an Englishlanguage case report form at the time of the interview. After subjects were discharged, charts were abstracted for the following: antibiotic use and type, blood, urine, and/or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) cultures, organisms isolated, chest radiography and results, oxygen use, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation (MV), length of stay (LOS) in the hospital, and discharge status.
