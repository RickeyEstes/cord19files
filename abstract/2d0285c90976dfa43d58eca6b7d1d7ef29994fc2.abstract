The human coronavirus HCoV-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome 47 (ARDS), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. Effective 48 antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the 49 overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent 50 dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited 51 potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In 52 analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found 53 that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts 54 and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP 55 treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the 56 hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time 57 of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19 58 infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, 59 suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. Larger scale clinical trials of DIP 60 are needed to validate these therapeutic effects. 61 62
