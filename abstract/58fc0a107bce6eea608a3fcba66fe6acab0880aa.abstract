Computational analysis of RNA secondary structure is a classical field of biosequence analysis, which has recently gained momentum due to the manyfold regulatory functions of RNA that have become apparent. We present five recent computational approaches that address the problems of synoptic folding space analysis, pseudoknot prediction, structure alignment, comparative structure prediction, and miRNA target prediction. All these programs are in current use and are available via the Bielefeld Bioinformatics Server at http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de. RNAfold provides an alternative implementations of the same model, with a wide spectrum of additional features. Based on dynamic programming algorithms, these programs perform a complete evaluation of all feasible structures for a given RNA sequence, and determine the one with minimal free energy. Therefore, this approach is called MFE folding, for short. The widespread use of these programs demonstrates that the research community has learned to live with the shortcomings of MFE folding, which are well known: 0168-1656/$ -see front matter
