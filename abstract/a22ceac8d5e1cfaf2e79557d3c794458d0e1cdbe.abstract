In numerous instances, tracking the biological significance of a nucleic acid sequence 15 can be augmented through the identification of environmental niches in which the sequence 16 of interest is present. Many metagenomic datasets are now available, with deep sequencing of 17 samples from diverse biological niches. While any individual metagenomic dataset can be 18 readily queried using web-based tools, meta-searches through all such datasets are less 19 accessible. In this brief communication, we demonstrate such a meta-meta-genomic 20 approach, examining close matches to the Wuhan coronavirus 2019-nCoV in all high-21 throughput sequencing datasets in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive accessible with the 22 keyword "virome". In addition to the homology to bat coronaviruses observed in descriptions ), we note a strong 25 homology to numerous sequence reads in a metavirome dataset generated from the lungs of 26 deceased Pangolins reported by Liu et al. (Viruses 11:11, 2019, 27 http://doi.org/10.3390/v11110979). Our observations are relevant to discussions of the 28 derivation of 2019-nCoV and illustrate the utility and limitations of meta-metagenomic 29 search tools in effective and rapid characterization of potentially significant nucleic acid 30 sequences. : bioRxiv preprint 65 Read Archive (SRA) using the SRA-tools package (version 2.9.1). The latter sequence data 66 were downloaded as .sra files using the prefetch tool, with extraction to readable format 67 (.fasta.gz) using the NCBI fastq-dump tool. Each of these manipulations can fail some 68 fraction of the time. Obtaining the sequences can fail due to network issues, while extraction 69 in readable format occasionally fails for unknown reasons. Thus the workflow continually 70 requests .sra files with ncbi-prefetch until at least some type of file is obtained, followed by 71 attempts to unpack into .fasta.gz format until one such file is obtained from each .sra file. Metagenomic datasets for analysis were chosen through a keyword search of the SRA 73 : bioRxiv preprint 274 2020.
