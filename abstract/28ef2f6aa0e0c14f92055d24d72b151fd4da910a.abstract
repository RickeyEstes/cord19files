Eukaryotic ribosomal frameshift signals generally contain two elements, a heptanucleotide slippery sequence (XXXYYYN) and an RNA secondary structure, often an RNA pseudoknot, located downstream. Frameshifting takes place at the slippery sequence by simultaneous slippage of two ribosome-bound tRNAs. All of the tRNAs that are predicted to decode frameshift sites in the ribosomal A-site (XXXYYYN) possess a hypermodi-®ed base in the anticodon-loop and it is conceivable that these modi®cations play a role in the frameshift process. To test this, we expressed slippery sequence variants of the coronavirus IBV frameshift signal in strains of Escherichia coli unable to modify fully either tRNA Lys or tRNA Asn . At the slippery sequences UUUAAAC and UUUAAAU (underlined codon decoded by tRNA Asn , anticodon 5 H QUU 3 H ), frameshifting was very inef®cient (2 to 3%) and in strains de®cient in the biosynthesis of Q base, was increased (AAU) or decreased (AAC) only two-fold. In E. coli, therefore, hypomodi®cation of tRNA Asn had little effect on frameshifting. The situation with the ef®cient slippery sequences UUUAAAA (15%) and UUUAAAG (40%) (underlined codon decoded by tRNA Lys , anticodon 5 H mnm 5 s 2 UUU 3 H ) was more complex, since the wobble base of tRNA Lys is modi®ed at two positions. Of four available mutants, only trmE (s 2 UUU) had a marked in¯uence on frameshifting, increasing the ef®ciency of the process at the slippery sequence UUUAAAA. No effect on frameshifting was seen in trmC1 (cmnm 5 s 2 UUU) or trmC2 (nm 5 s 2 UUU) strains and only a very small reduction (at UUUAAAG) was observed in an asuE (mnm 5 UUU) strain. The slipperiness of tRNA Lys , therefore, cannot be ascribed to a single modi®cation site on the base. However, the data support a role for the amino group of the mnm 5 substitution in shaping the anticodon structure. Whether these conclusions can be extended to eukaryotic translation systems is uncertain. Although E. coli ribosomes changed frame at the IBV signal (UUUAAAG) with an ef®ciency similar to that measured in reticulocyte lysates (40%), there were important qualitative differences. Frameshifting of prokaryotic ribosomes was pseudoknot-independent (although secondary structure dependent) and appeared to require slippage of only a single tRNA. # 1997 Academic Press Limited
