metapneumovirus, new coronaviruses (human coronavirus NL63 and HKU1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-coronavirus), and recently bocaviruses, have been identified as causal agents of ARI. Although most of these viral infections follow a benign and selflimiting course in healthy adults, the consequences for the health care systems increase when they involve children, the elderly, immunosuppressed individuals, or those with chronic underlying diseases. These viral infections are an important cause of hospitalization and death, mainly during the cold months of the year, and, from a social-health perspective, ARI are a drain on economic resources and a frequent cause of work absenteeism. Occasionally, some of these viruses may cause emergent world health problems, as has occurred with the influenza virus pandemic strain and SARScoronavirus. While classical diagnostic methods based on culture and antigen detection remain useful for traditional respiratory viruses, recently described viruses are diagnosed mainly by molecular amplification techniques.
