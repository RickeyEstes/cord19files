Manipulation of natural mosquito populations using the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia is being 21 investigated as a novel strategy to reduce the burden of mosquito-borne viruses. To evaluate the 22 efficacy of these interventions, it will be critical to determine Wolbachia infection frequencies in 23 Aedes aegypti mosquito populations. However, current diagnostic tools are not well-suited to fit this 24 need. Morphological methods cannot identify Wolbachia, immunoassays often suffer from low 25 sensitivity and poor throughput, while PCR and spectroscopy require complex instruments and 26 technical expertise, which restrict their use to centralized laboratories. To address this unmet need, 27 we have used loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and oligonucleotide strand 28 displacement (OSD) probes to create a one-pot sample-to-answer nucleic acid diagnostic platform 29 for vector and symbiont surveillance. LAMP-OSD assays can directly amplify target nucleic acids 30 from macerated mosquitoes without requiring nucleic acid purification and yield specific single 31 endpoint yes/no fluorescence signals that are observable to eye or by cellphone camera. We 32 demonstrate cellphone-imaged LAMP-OSD tests for two targets, the Aedes aegypti cytochrome 33 oxidase I (coi) gene and the Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) gene, and show a limit of detection 34 of 4 and 40 target DNA copies, respectively. In a blinded test of 90 field-caught mosquitoes, the 35 coi LAMP-OSD assay demonstrated 98% specificity and 97% sensitivity in identifying Ae. aegypti 36 mosquitoes even after 3 weeks of storage without desiccant at 37 °C. Similarly, the wsp LAMP-37 OSD assay readily identified the wAlbB Wolbachia strain in field-collected Aedes albopictus 38 mosquitoes without generating any false positive signals. Modest technology requirements, 39 minimal execution steps, simple binary readout, and robust accuracy make the LAMP-OSD-to-40 cellphone assay platform well suited for field vector surveillance in austere or resource-limited 41 conditions. 42 43 All rights reserved.

One promising approach is transferring Wolbachia into 46 Aedes aegypti mosquitoes where it blocks transmission of arboviruses like dengue, Zika and 47 Yellow fever viruses and spreads through mosquito populations. For effective evaluation of this 48 approach, regular surveillance of Wolbachia infections in Ae. aegypti is required, but current 49 diagnostic tools are not well suited to support these critical surveillance needs. To fill this need 50 we developed a simple, robust and inexpensive assay to identify Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and 51 Wolbachia using our unique one-pot assay platform, LAMP-OSD, which uses loop-mediated 52 isothermal amplification to amplify nucleic acid targets at a single temperature. Unlike other 53 LAMP-based tests, our assays assure accuracy by coupling amplification with novel nucleic acid 54 strand displacement (OSD) probes that hybridize to specific sequences in LAMP amplification 55 products and thereby generate simple yes/no readout of fluorescence readable by human eye 56 and by off-the-shelf cellphones. To facilitate field use, we developed our assays so they are 57 compatible with crushed mosquito homogenate as the template, meaning no nucleic acid 58 extraction is required. In blinded tests using field collected mosquitoes, LAMP-OSD-cellphone 59 tests performed robustly to identify 29 of 30 Ae. aegypti even after 3 weeks of storage at 37 °C 60 while producing only one false positive out of 60 non-specific mosquitoes. Similarly, our assay 61 could identify Wolbachia in field-caught Aedes albopictus without producing any false positives. 62 Our easy to use and easy to interpret assays should facilitate widespread field mosquito 63 surveillance with minimal instrumentation and high accuracy. 64 65 66 All rights reserved.

Traditionally considered a problem for tropical regions, mosquitoes are increasingly 69 becoming a global public health challenge [2, 3] due to a changing global environment, urbanization, 70 increases in the global movement of populations, and the emergence of insecticide resistance [4]. 71 Estimates suggest nearly half the world's population is at risk for mosquito-borne diseases [5, 6], 72 and as such, there is an urgent need for novel approaches to reduce the burden of disease.

On the other end of the spectrum, immunoassay-based tools for identifying pathogen-93 infected mosquitoes, such as VecTest TM dipsticks (Medical Analysis Systems Inc.), are portable 94 and inexpensive. However, these tests have poor sensitivity [23-25] and are not necessarily 95 available for distinguishing mosquito species or identifying Wolbachia endosymbionts. 96 Nucleic acid tests can provide the necessary sensitivity and versatility for identifying both 97 Wolbachia and mosquito species. However, since molecular testing is currently heavily reliant on 98 PCR [26-28], opportunities for field-based determinations are limited, leading to significant delays 99 and gaps in actionable surveillance. To support widespread vector surveillance inexpensive, 100 portable, nucleic acid diagnostic platforms are needed that rapidly produce accurate results without 101 requiring complex procedures, instruments, and laboratory infrastructure. In this regard, isothermal 102 nucleic acid amplification assays such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) have 103 begun to be employed because they do not require complex thermocycling instruments [29][30][31]. 104 However, although LAMP can rival PCR for sensitivity it often produces spurious amplicons, which 105 in turn lead to false positive readouts with non-specific reporters such as Mg 2+ precipitation or 106 fluorescent dye intercalation [32][33][34]. 107 To mitigate the spurious signals that arise with LAMP, we have previously applied principles that 108 were developed for nucleic acid strand exchange circuits [35][36][37][38] to the design of short hemiduplex 109 oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes for LAMP [39]. The single stranded 'toehold' 110 regions of OSD probes bind to LAMP amplicon loop sequences, and then signal via strand 111 exchange [40] that leads to separation of a fluorophore and quencher [39]. OSDs are the 112 functional equivalents of TaqMan probes and can specifically report single or multiplex LAMP 113 amplicons without interference from non-specific nucleic acids or inhibitors [39, 41]. OSDs 114 significantly enhance the diagnostic applicability of LAMP, allowing it to match the allelic specificity 115 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
