We create an agent based network model that simulates an epidemic. We combine population decisions for vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Vaccination mitigates epidemic final size effectively for high transmission rates. Non-pharmaceutical interventions compensate for delays in vaccine availability. Non-pharmaceutical interventions can lower vaccine uptake and reduce epidemic size.
