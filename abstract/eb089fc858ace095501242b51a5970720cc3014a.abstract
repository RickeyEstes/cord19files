KEYWORDS Posttransplant infections Posttransplant ICU care Solid organ transplantation Risk factors Solid organ transplant (SOT) has become a well-established standard of care for endorgan failure. The nurse in the intensive care unit may be exposed to these patients at any stage in the care continuum of pretransplant or posttransplant care. Factors affecting the incidence of infection after SOT include the type of organ transplanted, anatomic region of transplant, incidence of surgical complications, level of immunosuppression, and antirejection therapy. Knowledge of risk factors, timing, and treatments for infections may help to enhance clinical practices and optimize patient safety and clinical outcomes.
