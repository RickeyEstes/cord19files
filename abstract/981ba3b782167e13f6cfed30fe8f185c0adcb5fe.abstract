N ot since the threat of a potential SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic (in 2003) has medical news captured as much national media attention as in the recent few weeks. Tuberculosis (TB) has been in the public eye since news broke that Andrew Speaker, a 31year-old US citizen and attorney from Atlanta, Ga, was a passenger on international commercial airline flights while infected with a very resistant strain of TB and that he has since been placed in isolation by US health authorities. This case has focused attention on important public health issues: the global TB epidemic and the risk of spread of infectious agents either knowingly or unknowingly via air travel. The purpose of this editorial is to provide background information on the epidemiology of TB in the world, the problem of drug-resistant TB, the risks of acquiring infections from air travel, and the role of health authorities in minimizing risk to the public.
