Airborne-mediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis represent major public 12 health challenges. A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne 13 pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; 14 however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are 15 both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207-16 222 nm) efficiently kills bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its 17 strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) 18 layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller 19 dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them. We show for the first time that far-UVC
