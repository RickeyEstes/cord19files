Bats are notorious reservoirs of diverse, potentially zoonotic viruses, exemplified by the 20 evolutionarily distinct, influenza A-like viruses H17N10 and H18N11 (BatIVs). The surface 21 glycoproteins [haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N)] of BatIVs neither bind nor cleave 22 sialic acid receptors, which suggests that these viruses employ cell attachment and entry 23 mechanisms that differ from those of classical influenza A viruses (IAVs). Identifying the 24 cellular factors that mediate entry and determine susceptibility to infection will help assess 25 the host range of BatIVs. Here, we investigated a range of cell lines from different species for 26 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

We show that a number of human haematopoietic cancer cell lines 28 and the canine kidney MDCK II (but not MDCK I) cells are susceptible to H17-pseudotypes 29 (H17-PV). We observed with microarrays and qRT-PCR that the dog leukocyte antigen DLA-30 DRA mRNA is over expressed in late passaged parental MDCK and commercial MDCK II cells, 31 compared to early passaged parental MDCK and MDCK I cells, respectively. The human 32 orthologue HLA-DRA encodes the alpha subunit of the MHC class II HLA-DR antigen-binding 33 heterodimer. Small interfering RNA-or neutralizing antibody-targeting HLA-DRA, drastically 34 reduced the susceptibility of Raji B cells to H17-PV. Conversely, over expression of HLA-DRA 35 and its paralogue HLA-DRB1 on the surface of the unsusceptible HEK293T/17 cells conferred 36 susceptibility to H17-PV. The identification of HLA-DR as an H17N10 entry mediator will 37 contribute to a better understanding of the tropism of the virus and will elucidate its zoonotic 38 transmission. 39 40
