Bayesian inference methods for individual-level geo-located epidemiological data have enabled reconstruction of transmission trees and quantification of disease spread in space and time, while accounting for uncertainty in missing data. However, these methods have rarely been applied to endemic diseases or ones in which asymptomatic infection plays a role, for which novel estimation methods are required. Here, we develop such methods to analyse longitudinal incidence data on visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and its sequela, postkala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic community in Bangladesh. Incorporating recent data on infectiousness of VL and PKDL, we show that while VL cases drive transmission when incidence is high, the contribution of PKDL increases significantly as VL incidence declines (reaching 55% in this setting). Transmission is highly focal: >85% of mean distances from inferred infectors to their secondary VL cases were <300m, and estimated average times from infector onset to secondary case infection were <4 months for 90% of VL infectors, but up to 2.75yrs for PKDL infectors. Estimated numbers of secondary VL cases per VL and PKDL case varied from 0-6 and were strongly correlated with the infector's duration of symptoms. Counterfactual simulations suggest that prevention of PKDL could have reduced VL incidence by up to a quarter. These results highlight the need for prompt detection and treatment of PKDL to achieve VL elimination in the Indian subcontinent and provide quantitative estimates to guide spatiotemporally-targeted interventions against VL. visceral leishmaniasis | post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis | spatiotemporal transmission | transmission tree | Bayesian inference S patiotemporal heterogeneity in incidence is a hallmark of 1 infectious diseases. Insight into this heterogeneity has in-2 creased considerably in recent years due to greater availability 3 of geo-located individual-level epidemiological data and the 4 development of sophisticated statistical inference methods for 5 partially observed transmission processes (1-6). These meth-6 ods have been developed for epidemics, in which the immune 7 status of the population is known, and for diseases with a 8 short time course that are relatively easily diagnosed, such 9 as measles, influenza, and foot-and-mouth disease (3, 4, 7). Here, we extend these methods to a slowly progressing endemic 11 disease of humans in which asymptomatic infection plays an 12 important role. 13 We analyse detailed longitudinal individual-level data on 14 incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and its sequela, post-15 kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic 16 community in Fulbaria, Bangladesh (8). VL, also known as 17 kala-azar, is a lethal sandfly-borne parasitic disease targeted 18 for elimination as a public health problem (<1 case/10,000 19 people/year at subdistrict/district level depending on the 20 country) in the Indian subcontinent (ISC) by 2020 (9). PKDL 21 is a non-lethal skin condition that occurs after treatment 22 for VL in 5-20% of cases in the ISC, and less frequently in 23 individuals who report no history of prior VL (8, 10). It is 24 characterised by skin lesions of di ering severity and parasite 25 load, ranging from macules and papules (least severe, lowest 26 load) to nodules (most severe, highest load) (11). We estimate 27 the relative contributions of di erent disease states (VL, PKDL 28 and asymptomatic infection) to transmission, and quantify the 29 rate of spread of infection around infected individuals in space 30 and time by reconstructing transmission trees. Our analysis 31 provides insight into the spatiotemporal spread of visceral 32 leishmaniasis as well as quantitative estimates that can guide 33 the targeting of interventions, such as active case detection 34 and indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide, around VL 35 Although methods for analysing individual-level geo-located disease data have existed for some time, they have rarely been used to analyse endemic human diseases. Here we apply such methods to nearly a decade's worth of uniquely detailed epidemiological data on incidence of the deadly vector-borne disease visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and its secondary condition, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), to quantify the spread of infection around cases in space and time by inferring who infected whom, and estimate the relative contribution of different infection states to transmission. Our findings highlight the key role long diagnosis delays and PKDL play in maintaining VL transmission. This detailed characterisation of the spatiotemporal transmission of VL will help inform targeting of interventions around VL and PKDL cases. : medRxiv preprint 131 sion (over and above that from being at zero distance from 132 an infectious individual) and with di erent pre-symptomatic 133 and asymptomatic relative infectiousness.
