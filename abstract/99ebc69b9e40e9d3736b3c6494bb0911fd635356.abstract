Ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common feature of several diseases associated with high morbidity and mortality, such as stroke and myocardial infarction. The damaged tissue displays cardinal signs of inflammation and microvascular injury that, unless resolved, lead to long-term tissue damage with associated dysfunction. Current therapies are limited and are often associated with many side effects. Increasing evidence suggests that members of the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) family, in particular human FPR2/ALX, might have an important role in the pathophysiology of I/R injury. It was recently demonstrated that several peptides and non-peptidyl small-molecule compounds have antiinflammatory and pro-resolving properties via their action on members of the FPR family. Here I review this evidence and suggest that FPR ligands, particularly in the brain, could be novel and exciting anti-inflammatory therapeutics for the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions, including stroke. Glossary Lipoxin A 4 (LXA 4 ): Annexin Ac2-26: N-terminal domain of annexin A1, representing the bioactive peptide spanning amino acids 2-26. Complement 5a (C5a) receptor (C5AR): also known as complement component 5a receptor 1 and CD88 (cluster of differentiation 88); a G-protein-coupled receptor for C5a. Dissociation constant (K d ): measure of how tightly a ligand binds to a particular receptor. Low ligand K d values reflect a high affinity for the receptor. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs): proteins with an extracellular domain and an intracellular C-terminal tail, separated by three extracellular loops and three intracellular loops. They are the largest family of membrane receptors and couple to intracellular effector systems via a G protein. Intravital microscopy (IVM): real-time qualitative and quantitative method for observing cell-cell interactions in the microcirculation of an anaesthetized animal.
