To compare the sex differences in the clinical findings among patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 . We retrospectively collected data of 47 patients diagnosed as severe type of COVID-19 from February 8 to 22, 2020, including demographics, illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, management, and compared differences between men and women. : Of the 47 patients, 28 (59.6%) were men. The median age was 62 years, and 30 (63.8%) had comorbidities. The initial symptoms were mainly fever (34 [72.3%]), cough (36 [76.6%]), myalgia (5 [10.6%]) and fatigue (7 [14.9%]). Procalcitonin level was higher in men than in women (0.08 vs. 0.04ng/ml, p=0.002). N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide increased in 16 (57.1%) men and 5 (26.3%) women (p=0.037). Five men (17.9%) had detected positive influenza A antibody, but no women. During 2-week admission, 5 (17.9%) men and 1 (5.3%) woman were reclassified into the critical type due to deterioration. Mortality was 3.6% in men and 0 in women respectively. Four (21.1%) women and one man (3.6%) recovered and discharged from hospital. Conclusion: Sex differences may exist in COVID-19 patients of severe type. Men are likely to have more complicated clinical condition and worse in-hospital outcomes as compared to women. : medRxiv preprint 0.508 Neutrophil count, ×10 9 /L 3.1 (2.1-5.2) 4.1 (2.0-6.9) 2.9 (2.5-3.4) 0.353 Lymphocyte count, ×10 9 /L 1.3 (0.7-1.9) 1.2 (0.7-2.0) 1.3 (0.9-1.6) 0 869 ≥1.0, No. (%) 30 (63.8) 15 (53.6) 15 (78.9) 0.076 Platelet count, ×10 9 /L 230.0 (157.0-302.5) 218.0 (151.3-320.8) 230.0 (164.0-304.0) 0.696 ＞300.0, No. (%) 14 (29.8) 8 (28.6) 6 (31.6) 0.825 Procalcitonin, ng/ml 0.06 (0.03-0.10) 0.08 (0.05-0.19) 0.04 (0.03-0.07) 0.002 increased (＞0.05), No. (%) 25 (53.2) 19 (67.9) 6 (31.6) 0.014 All rights reserved.
