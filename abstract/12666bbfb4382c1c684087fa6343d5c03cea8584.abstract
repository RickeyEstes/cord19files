Thank you for the transfer of your research manuscript to EMBO reports. I now went through the referee reports from The EMBO Journal. Both referees acknowledge the potential interest of the findings. Nevertheless, both referees have raised a number of concerns and suggestions to improve the manuscript, or to strengthen the data and the conclusions drawn. As the reports are below, I will not detail them here. As EMBO reports emphasizes novel functional over detailed mechanistic insight, we will not require to address points regarding more refined mechanistic details. However, all concerns regarding technical and experimental limitations, and data presentation need to be addressed. Moreover, as EMBO reports publishes robustly documented, novel major findings of physiological or clinical relevance and wide interest, we think that the biological relevance of the findings (as indicated by referee #1) should be strengthened. Further, as stated by referee #2, the novelty and advance of the findings should be increased by adding more data, addressing the questions raised by this referee. Given the constructive referee comments, we would like to invite you to revise your manuscript, with the understanding that all referee concerns must be fully addressed in the revised manuscript (as outlined above), and a complete point-by-point response. Acceptance of your manuscript will depend on a positive outcome of a second round of review, using the same referees as at The EMBO Journal (indicating, that the paper is now revised and submitted to EMBO reports). It is EMBO reports policy to allow a single round of revision only and acceptance or rejection of the manuscript will therefore depend on the completeness of your responses included in the next, final version of the manuscript. EMBO reports -Peer Review Process File Â© European Molecular Biology Organization 2 Referee #1: In their work, Sousa et al. argue that the homeostatic functions of microglia are lost under inflammatory conditions mimicked in this work by LPS treatment in vivo and in vitro. The authors isolated homogeneous microglia populations and show by single cell RNA Sequencing segregation of microglia in different subgroups apparently triggered by inflammatory processes. This topic is therefore of interest to the microglia community as it highlights the microglial response to an acute inflammatory stimulus and compares it to chronic stimuli such as neurodegeneration. The authors argue that microglial subpopulations exist that show differential responses to acute inflammation. By selecting population-specific cell surface markers, they were able to effectively isolate only brain-resident microglia, based on Cd11b+/Cd45int expression, as opposed to other intrinsic or peripheral cells (Fig. 1) . The authors show that upon an acute LPS injection or upon in vitro LPS stimulation, microglia lose their homeostatic and phagocytosing gene expression profile, whilst pro-inflammatory genes are upregulated (Fig. 2) . This data was confirmed using a single-cell sequencing approach, showing that microglia exposed to LPS show a distinct reactive phenotype compared to saline-injected control mice (Fig. 3) . By analysing the sequencing data more closely, the group could identify a specific microglia sub-population ("subset LPS") that showed an intermediate phenotype compared to control and reactive microglia (Fig. 4) . They postulate based on differential gene analysis that these cells might either be damaged cells, recovering from their activation status or a cell population with specific DNA repair properties. Lastly, in Fig. 5 the authors compared the gene signatures of LPS-exposed microglia to that of "disease-associated microglia" (DAM) that has been described by Keren-Shaul et al. (2017) in response to neurodegeneration and describe high inflammatory reactivity upon LPS treatment and a phagocytic gene signature in DAM. The paper analyses reactive microglia on a single-cell level, which adds to the growing amount of research dissecting specific microglial responses and subtypes to varying stimuli using highresolution approaches. Yet, the relevance the particular knowledge of LPS induced microglia subgroups to advance treatment options for diseases of the CNS involving neuroinflammation remains questionable and is not addressed in this study. The work lacks clinical relevance, which should be increased by adding further experiments.
