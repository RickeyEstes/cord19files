Inspired by bioactive biaryl-containing natural products found in plants and the marine 19 environment, a series of synthetic compounds belonging to the azaBINOL chiral ligand family 20 was evaluated for antiviral activity against HIV-1. Testing of 39 unique azaBINOLs in a single-21 round infectivity assay resulted in the identification of three promising antiviral compounds, 22 including 7-isopropoxy-8-(naphth-1-yl)quinoline (azaBINOL B#24), which exhibited low-23 micromolar activity. The active compounds and several close structural analogues were further 24 tested against three different HIV-1 envelope pseudotyped viruses as well as in a full-virus 25 replication system (EASY-HIT). Mode-of-action studies using a time-of-addition assay indicated 26 that azaBINOL B#24 acts after viral entry but before viral assembly and budding. HIV-1 reverse 27 transcriptase (RT) assays that individually test for polymerase and RNase H activity were used to 28 demonstrate that B#24 inhibits RNase H activity, most likely allosterically. Further binding 29 analysis using bio-layer interferometry (BLI) showed that B#24 interacts with HIV-1 RT in a 30 highly specific manner. These results indicate that azaBINOL B#24 is a potentially viable, novel 31
