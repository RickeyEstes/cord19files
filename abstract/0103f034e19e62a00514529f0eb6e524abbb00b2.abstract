Lower urinary tract Afferents Animal model Central nervous system Due to the complexity of the neural mechanisms regulating the lower urinary tract, micturition is sensitive to a wide variety of injuries and diseases, resulting in neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. In animal models of cerebral infarction (CI) produced by occlusion of middle cerebral artery, the balance between excitatory glutamatergic neurons and inhibitory glycinergic or GABAergic in the brain might be disrupted, leading to neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. In animal models of parkinson disease (PD) produced by disruption of nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways, bladder overactivity is primarily induced by disruption of D1-like dopamine receptormediated inhibition of the micturition reflex. In animal models of multiple sclerosis (MS) induced by experimental encephalomyelitis, neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction associated with detrusor overactivity is developed as seen in patients with MS. In animal models of spinal cord injury (SCI), hyperexcitability of C-fiber bladder afferents is a major pathophysiological basis of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, and various neural plasticities in peripheral and central nervous systems are identified.
