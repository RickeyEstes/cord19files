Passerines (songbirds) and softbills ( toucans and mynahs) are in creasingly presented for veterinary care as pet owners and aviculturists recognize that successful medical and surgical ,treatment can be per formed, even in these often tiny patients. Many ;veterinarians are rela tively unfamiliar or even uncomfortable with passerines and softbills. The aviculture, diagnostic procedures, common diseases, and treatment have been discussed in recent publications. 6 • 12 • 17 This article presents a short introduction to these two large groups of birds. The order Passeriformes contains over 5700 species, with body weights ranging from 4.8 g to 1350 g. Toucans and mynahs are often grouped together but are from different taxonomic orders. Toucans are members of the family Ramphastidae (order Piciformes); mynahs are members of the family Sturdidae (order Passeriformes). The most com monly kept mynahs are the Gracula species (hill mynahs). Diseases in these birds are very much influenced by nutrition, enviroment, and stress. For an optimal approach to veterinary problems, including diagnosis and treatment, one must become familiar with the aviculture, housing, and husbandry of these species. Supportive care and measures to minimize stress are often needed to maintain or increase the host's defense mechanisms. Medicating these small pet birds is accomplished by the same meth ods of administration used in mammals and psittacines but with several special points borne in mind. These small birds have a high metabolic rate and therefore antibiotics and chemotherapeutics are eliminated 35 36 DORRESTEIN quickly 5 ; this means drug application at short intervals (inducing stress) or at high levels (causing toxicity). Treating flocks of these birds gives rise to practical problems. Passerines (perching-or songbirds) constitute more than one half of the species of birds of the world, presently comprising approximately 5700 species assigned to 1161 genera. They represent a diverse, species rich, monophyletic order of mostly small land birds. 10 The commonest representatives of the passerines in captivity are canaries, finches, and mynahs. The canary (Serinus canaria) is the most well-known representative of the songbirds. Canaries have been domesticated for a long time (since 1600) and are bred and kept for their song (e.g., Roller canary, American singer), their colors (colored canaries), or their build and shape. Their weight is 15 g to 25 g. The sexes are alike, and their lifespan is 6 to 16 years. There are almost 1000 species of finches and weaver relatives that comprise Old World granivorous and insectivorous birds, including weaverbirds and estrildine finches; the ground-living wagtails, pipits, and accentors; the nectar-feeding sunbirds and flower peckers; sugar birds and a few Australasian taxa; and the New World wood warblers, tanagers, and blackbirds, recognized by a strongly reduced tenth pri mary.10 The more domesticated species have been bred in captivity for many decades, but many finches are still imported from Asia and Africa. There is a fair amount of disparity in size between the common finch pets (smallest: gold-breasted waxbill 7 g; largest: Java rice sparrow, 20 g). The commonest finches belong to the family Fringillidae and Estrildidae. Mynahs (Gracula spp.) and starlings are members of the family Sturdidae (Passeriformes); a family of insect-and fruit/berry-eating songbirds comprising over 110 species. They are commonly referred to as grackles. The mynahs are kept mainly because of their ability to mimic the human voice. The commonest species is the Hill mynah (Gracula religiosa), which has seven subspecies and originates in Southeast Asia. The veterinary approach to these pet birds is comparable to that for the psittacine birds. They are kept mostly as single pet birds. The starlings include the Pagoda starling (Temenuchus pagodarum), superb glossy star ling (Lamprospreo superbus), and purple glossy starling (Lamprotornis purpureus). These birds are predominantly kept as aviary birds. The average body weight of the lesser Indian Hill mynah (Gracula religiosa indica) is 110 g to 130 g, that of the Java Hill mynah (G. r. intermedia) is 150 g to 200 g, and that of the Greater Hill mynah (G. r. religiosa) is 210 g to 270 g. 12 195
