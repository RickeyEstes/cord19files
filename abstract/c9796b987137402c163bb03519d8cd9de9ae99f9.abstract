where the ‫ݏߚ‬ capture the utility of each component. The utility experienced in the ݅th response is assumed to be ‫ݑ‬ ~ܰ (ߤ , ߪ ଶ ) (3). The respondent reports whether ‫ݑ‬ ଵ > ‫ݑ‬ ଶ or not. If we denote the difference between these utilities as ߜ = ‫ݑ‬ ଵ − ‫ݑ‬ ଶ (4) then ߜ ~ܰ (ߤ ଵ − ߤ ଶ , 2ߪ ଶ ) (5). We observe ‫ݕ‬ which is 1 if ߜ > 0 and 0 otherwise. The likelihood of the data therefore follows directly. The WTP for a given change in a policy scenario is the amount of cash (in this case a one-time tax) that would leave a respondent indifferent between paying (or receiving payment) for the attribute levels in a new scenario or remain with the original scenario. The WTP can be estimated by comparing the change in utility between the scenarios and the marginal utility of the tax attribute. The utility of tax was assumed to be linear, creating a single utility to money mapping that permitted the posterior distribution of willingness-to-pay (in units of one Singapore dollar) to be derived by taking the ratio of the other ߚs to the tax ߚ. We then employed a hierarchical cluster analysis with Wald's method to identify distinct respondent preference classes. To account for the between individual variation, a hierarchical model was fitted. This model is similar as the original model, but the utility parameter ߚ varies by individual. The utility parameter, ߚ , for individual ݅ attribute ݇ was assigned a Normal prior, i.e. ߚ ~ ܰ(ߤ , ߪ ଶ ) (6). Following parameter estimation (see next section), the Euclidean distance matrix used for cluster analysis was calculated from posterior mean utilities associated with each attribute and each individual. The number of latent classes was determined using the dendrogram from the cluster analysis, centroid plot from a two-group linear discriminant analysis, and elbow plot. Demographic predictors of class membership were then determined through logistic regression. Model fitting: In the main model, flat prior distributions were assigned to each ߚ and to log ߪ. To ensure identifiability, one exception is made: the extreme level for one attribute (180 deaths) was set to −1 so that all other utilities are relative to that. The choice of the variable to anchor the utility scale to was made on pilot runs. In the hierarchical model used for clustering, the hyperprior distributions for ߤ and ߪ ଶ followed a normal distribution ܰ(0, 10) and an inverse-gamma distribution with a shape of 0.1 and a scale of 0.1, respectively. The model was fit using the Rstan package 34 that used the Stan language 35 to sample from the posterior distribution for the parameters resulting from the model described above. This used a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm 36 . In total 500,000 draws with a thin of 5 iterations from the posterior were made, and convergence assessed visually. Analyses were done in R 37 . Variant model: An alternative model was also constructed in which the linear tax variable was
