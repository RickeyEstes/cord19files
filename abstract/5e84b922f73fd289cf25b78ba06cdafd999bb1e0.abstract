Gonzalez Juarrero, M., Mebus, C.A., Pan, R., Revilla, Y., Alonso, J.M. and Lunney, J.K., 1992. Swine leukocyte antigen and macrophage marker expression on both African swine fever virus-infected and non-infected primary porcine macrophage cultures. Vet. lmmunol. Immunopathol., 32: 243-259. Swine leukocyte antigens (SLA) and a macrophage specific marker were monitored on porcine macrophages cultured with or without macrophage colony stimulatory factor (M-CSF) and on cells infected with African swine fever virus (ASFV). SLA expression was maximal either in the total cell extract or on the cell surface at 3-4 days of culture; after 4 days these values began to decrease. Fluorescence analyses of immunostained macrophages cultured with or without M-CSF indicated a major upward shift in the number of SLA Class I molecules on individual macrophages whereas for SLA Class I1 both a novel expression of Class II and an upward shift in the number of molecules per cell were evident. Infection of 3-day-old macrophage cultures with three different isolates of ASFV resulted in minor changes in surface expression of SLA Class I, SLA Class It, and macrophage markers. No differences in infection with ASFV was observed whether macrophages were SLA Class II positive or negative, nor was there blocking by anti-SLA Class I or Class II monoclonal antibodies of ASFV infection of cultured macrophages.
