300 words) 33 Quantification of aerosolized influenza virus is used for determining inhalation exposure. Several 34 bioaerosol samplers and analytical methods have been used; however, the detection and 35 quantification of influenza virus among aerosol samples remains challenging. Therefore, 36 improved viral aerosol measurement methods are needed. This study evaluated influenza virus 37 recovery among three filter types polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride and polystyrene. 38 Polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride are fabricated filter materials and commonly used in 39 the scientific literature to sample for viral aerosols. A novel, electrospun polystyrene filter 40 material may improve viral aerosol recovery during filter-based air sampling. The filter materials 41 were compared across the following conditions: treated with or without air, filter wash buffer 42 (HBSS or PBS), and viral RNA extraction method (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit or Trizol). 43 Twenty trials were completed in a chamber and samples were analyzed using RT-qPCR. Viral 44 recovery was significantly different (p-value < .0001) by filter type. Polystyrene filter use 45 resulted in recovery of the most viral RNA. Air sampling did not affect the recovery of viral 46 RNA from the filter materials (p-values > 0.05). Viral RNA concentrations were significantly 47 different across extraction methods for all comparisons (p-values < 0.05). Our results 48 demonstrated that the novel polystyrene filter material resulted in the highest concentration of 49 extracted RNA compared to the commonly used polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylchloride, 50 which we speculate may be related to the chemical composition of the filter material (e.g., 51 polystyrene is an aromatic hydrocarbon whereas polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylchloride 52 contain more polar, and thus potentially reactive, carbon-halogen bonds). Air sampling did not 53 have an effect on viral RNA recovery. Using Hanks Balanced Salt Solution with QIAamp Viral .
