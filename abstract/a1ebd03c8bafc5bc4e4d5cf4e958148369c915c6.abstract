Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common emergency of the gastrointestinal tract occurring in the neonatal period. First described in the nineteenth century, NEC has been recognized as an important neonatal disorder since the 1960s. Dozens of descriptive studies and more than 20 case-control studies have been published in the English literature since 1965. Nonetheless, the cause and pathogenesis of NEC remain enigmatic. Necrotizing enterocolitis is characterized by gastrointestinal and systemic signs and symptoms including feeding intolerance, delayed gastric emptying, abdominal distention or tenderness, occult or gross blood in the stool, lethargy, apnea, respiratory distress, and poor perfusion. In advanced cases, associated acidosis, shock, bacteremia, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy are found. The diagnosis is suspected from clinical presentation. However, to be proved, clinical impressions must be confirmed by results of diagnostic radiographs, surgery, or autopsy. In 19 78, Bell et al 9 proposed a system for the uniform clinical staging of patients with NEC. With this system, infants are classified as having stage I (suspect), stage II (definite), or stage III (advanced) disease. Walsh and Kliegman 72 modified Bell's staging criteria to include systemic, intestinal, and radiographic signs and to suggest treatment based on stage and severity of illness. Infants with suggestive clinical signs and symptoms but nondiagnostic results of radiographs are classified as stage I (suspect NEC). Infants
