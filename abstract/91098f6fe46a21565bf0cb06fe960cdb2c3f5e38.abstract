1 Background Since December 2019, pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel 2 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan, China. The exponential increase of 3 the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global 4 community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted 5 diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and 6 support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. 7 We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 8 2019-nCoV outbreak. 9 Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on 10 January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or 11 working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in 12 information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and 13 treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. 14 Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the 15 information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the 16 local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, 17 particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under 18 quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) 19 and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both 20 strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority 21 of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital 22 treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV. Few of 23 the participants from Wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under 24 .
