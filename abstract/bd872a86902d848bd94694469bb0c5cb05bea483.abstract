Human infection with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is driven by 28 recurring dromedary-to-human spill-over events, leading decision-makers to consider dromedary 29 vaccination. Dromedary vaccine candidates in the development pipeline are showing hopeful results, 30 but gaps in our understanding of the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in dromedaries must be addressed 31 to design and evaluate potential vaccination strategies. We systematically reviewed the published 32 literature reporting seroprevalence and/or prevalence of active MERS-CoV infection in dromedary 33 populations from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, including 60 studies in our qualitative 34 syntheses. MERS-CoV seroprevalence increased with age up to 80-100% in adult dromedaries 35 supporting geographically wide spread endemicity of MERS-CoV in dromedaries in both the Arabian 36 Peninsula and countries exporting dromedaries from Africa. The high prevalence of active infection 37 measured in juveniles and at sites where dromedary populations mix should guide further 38 investigation -particularly of dromedary movement -and inform vaccination strategy design. 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 .

The dromedary population is highly heterogeneous and 68 spans a wide geographic area stretching from West Africa through to the Middle East and parts of 69 Asia. Knowing when and where dromedaries would need to be targeted, and the likely impact of 70 vaccination, is necessary before further consideration of dromedary vaccination in the wider 71 socioeconomic and cultural context. 72 Here, we systematically reviewed published studies that measured MERS-CoV antibody 73 seroprevalence in dromedaries and/or prevalence of viral RNA in dromedaries. Assuming assay 74 specificity and long-term presence of antibodies after infection, seroprevalence can be used to 75 estimate what proportion of a dromedary population has ever been infected with MERS-CoV. Broken 76 down by age class, this can tell us when most animals encounter the infection for the first time. 77 Additionally, although whole-virus isolation and culture is necessary to confirm whether the shedding .

Neutralising antibody tests are more specific 103 and are the WHO (World Health Organisation) recommended method for confirming MERS-CoV 104 seropositivity (9).
