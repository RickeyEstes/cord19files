Stoddart, M.E., Gaskell, R.M., Harbour, D.A. and Pearson, G.R., 1988. The sites of early viral replication in feline infectious peritonitis. Vet. Microbiol., 18: 259-271. The sites of early replication of feline infectious peritonitis virus were studied following oral inoculation of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats with virus grown in cell cultures. Viral antigen was first detected by immunofluorescence in the tonsils and small intestine within 24 h of inoculation, and was later found in caecum, colon, mesenteric lymph nodes and liver. However, histological changes in the gut did not appear until relatively late in the course of infection. Virus was recovered from the oropharynx and the faeces from as early as the second or third day after inoculation, and shedding continued until euthanasia. 0378-1135/88/$03.50
