In the note, the logistic growth regression model is used for the estimation of the final size and its peak time of the coronavirus epidemic in China, South Korea, and the rest of the World. In the previous article [1], we try to estimate the final size of the epidemic for the whole World using the logistic model and SIR model. The estimation was about 83000 cases. Both models show that the outbreak is moderating; however, new data showed a linear upward trend. It turns out that the epidemy in China was slowing but is begin to spread elsewhere in the World. In this note, we will give forecasting epidemic size for China, South Korea, and the rest of the World and daily predictions using the logistic model. Full daily reports and counties outside of China generated are available at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339912313_Forecasting_of_final_COVID -19_epidemic_size The MATLAB program fitVirus used for calculations is freely available from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/74411-fitvirus We note that logistic models give similar results as the SIR model (at least for the case of China and South Korea). However, the logistic model is given by explicit formula and is thus much simpler for regression analysis than the SIR model, where one must on each optimization step solve a system of ordinary differential equations.
