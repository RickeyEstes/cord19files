KEYWORDS Necrotizing enterocolitis Isolated intestinal perforation Peritoneal drainage Microecology Inflammation There is an inverse relationship between postmenstrual age (PMA) at birth and risk of NEC. It is less common in term or late preterm infants. Intestinal immaturity, aggressive feedings, and inflammatory response to interactions between intestinal epithelial barrier and luminal microbes are key contributors to NEC. At an early stage, NEC is difficult to differentiate from sepsis. Intramural gas or pneumatosis and portal venous gas are pathognomonic signs of NEC. Pneumoperitoneum, a sign of intestinal perforation and signs of intestinal gangrene including severe metabolic acidosis, persistent and severe thrombocytopenia, adynamic dilated intestinal loops require surgical intervention. Research focused at identifying infants at increased risk of NEC combined with techniques aimed at early diagnosis, should decrease incidence and mortality of NEC.
