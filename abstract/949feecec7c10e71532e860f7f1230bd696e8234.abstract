The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected thousands of people with a large number of deaths across 26 countries. The sudden appearance of the virus leads to the limited existing therapies for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, vaccines and antiviral medicines are in desperate need. This study took immune-informatics approaches to identify B-and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected B-and T-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. Epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development. : bioRxiv preprint Methods Primary sequence of SARS-CoV-2 protein was retrieved from NCBI database using accession number MN908947.3 [3]. Experimentally known 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6VSB)[1]. Protein sequence was analyzed for its chemicals and physical properties including GRAVY (Grand average of hydropathicity), half-life, molecular weight, stability index and amino acid atomic composition via an online tool Protparam [13]. TMHMM v2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) was applied to examine the transmembrane topology of S protein. Secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 protein was analyzed by PSIPRED [14]. Existence of disulphide-bonds were examined through an online tool DIANNA v1.1 which uses trained neural system to make predictions [15]. Antigenicity of full-length S protein was evaluated by vaxijen v2.0 [16]. B-cell epitope prediction IEDB (Immune-Epitope-Database And Analysis-Resource) [17] with default parameter settings were used to predict B-cell epitopes. Epitopes predicted by linear epitope prediction of Bepipred and Bepipred2.0, Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity, Parker hydrophilicity, Chou and Fasman beta turn, and Karplus and Schulz flexibility. BcePred [18] was also used to predict B-cell epitopes using accessibility, antigenic propensity, exposed surface, flexibility, hydrophilicity, polarity and turns. Predicted B-cell epitopes by IEDB and BcePred were combined to the B-cell epitope candidate list. Based on transmembrane topology of S protein predicted by TMHMM v2.0, only epitopes on the outer surface were remained, and other intracellular epitopes were eliminated. VaxiJen 2.0 [16] was applied to evaluate the antigenicity of the remained epitopes. A stringent criteria was used to have antigenicity score of 0.9 and 14 residue length epitopes viewed adequate to start a defensive immune reaction. A B-cell discontinuous epitope forms the antigen-binding interface through fragments scattered along the protein sequence. DiscoTope2.0[19] with discotope score threshold of -3.7 was used to predict discontinuous epitopes. Pymol was used to examine the positions of selected linear and discontinuous epitopes on the 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 protein.
