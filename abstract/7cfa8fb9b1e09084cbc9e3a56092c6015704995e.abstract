Background: Due to the emergence of drug resistance in herpes simplex virus type 1 (HsV-1), researchers are trying to find other methods for treating herpes simplex virus type 1 infections. Probiotic bacteria are effective in macrophage activation and may have antiviral activities. Objective: this study aimed at verifying the direct effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, a probiotic bacterium, in comparison with Escherichia coli, a non-probiotic one, on HsV-1 infection, and determining its effect on macrophage activation for in vitro elimination of HsV-1 infection. Methods: the above bacteria were introduced into HsV-1 infected Vero cells, and their effects were examined using both Mtt and plaque assay. to determine macrophage activation against in vitro HsV-1 infection, J774 cells were exposed to these bacteria; then, macrophage viability was examined with the Mtt method, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α), interferon-gamma (ifn-γ), and nitric oxide (no) assessments were performed using the ELisA method. Results: A significant increased viability of macrophages was observed (p < 0.05) in the presence of Lactobacillus rhamnosus before and after HsV-1 infection when compared with Escherichia coli as a non-probiotic bacterium. However, tumor necrosis factor α concentration produced by Escherichia coli-treated J774 cells was significantly higher than Lactobacillus rhamnosus-treated J774 cells (p < 0.05). interferon-gamma and no production were not different in the groups treated with Escherichia coli or with Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Conclusion: the results of this study indicate that Lactobacillus rhamnosus enhances macrophage viability for HsV-1 elimination and activation against HsV-1 more effectively, when compared with non-probiotic Escherichia coli. it also seems that receptor occupation of macrophage sites decreases HsV-1 infectivity by both of the studied bacteria.
