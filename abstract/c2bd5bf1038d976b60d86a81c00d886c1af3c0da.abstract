Viral RNA was extracted by using the Qiaamp viral RNA minikit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The RNA was eluted in 60 μL AVE buffer and was used as a template for further detection by a pan-coronavirus nested PCR targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. First-round reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was conducted by using forward primer 5-GGKTG-GGAYTAYCCKAARTG-3 and reverse primer 5-TGYTGTSWRCA-RAAYTCRTG-3 and QIAGEN 1-step RT-PCR kit. A 25-μL reaction mixture contained 5 μL of
