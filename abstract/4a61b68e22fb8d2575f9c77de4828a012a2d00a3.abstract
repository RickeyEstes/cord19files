The oral mucosa in humans may manifest local or systemic disease and derangements produced by therapeutic agents. A significant proportion of therapy-related oral drug reactions appear to be lichenoid reactions, erythema multiforme and bullous lesions similar to idiosyncratic or immune-mediated skin reactions. 1,2 Inflammation of the oral mucosa (oral mucositis) is a particular side effect of conventional anticancer drug treatment and this has also been a feature of targeted anticancer therapy both monoclonal antibodies and small molecules. 3 Systemic disorders produced by anticoagulants or anticancer therapy may also be evident by bleeding or ulceration in the oral cavity. Buccal ulceration is also described as part of a generalized hypersensitivity reaction to drugs. 4 Excessive contact by therapeutic agents such as aspirin, potassium supplements, captopril, nicorandil, a potassium-channel activator and corticosteroids has been reported to produce local ulceration in the mouth. 1,2,4Ã€6 The increased use of mouthwashes over the last 20 years has also resulted in a number of reported adverse effects to the buccal mucosa in people. 7 While the buccal route offers some advantages for drug delivery because intestinal and first pass hepatic metabolism can be avoided, this is limited by the low adsorption across the oral mucosa and the irritant nature of many proposed permeation enhancers. 8 The major and minor salivary glands and their secretions also represent an integral part of the protective mechanism of the oral cavity and derangement of saliva production may lead to loss of integrity of the oral mucosa (see below). Many drugs enter the saliva by simple passive diffusion. 9 Drugs that effect motor coordination can give rise to drooling and disruption of cricopharyngeal coordination. 10 Drug-induced abnormalities of taste sensation are also welldescribed phenomena occurring in patients. Indeed, many alterations in the oral mucosa are those that are more readily detected by careful clinical observation in people rather than exhaustive histopathological examination of the buccal mucosa in laboratory animals.
