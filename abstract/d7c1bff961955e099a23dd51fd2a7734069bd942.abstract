To characterize genetic variation of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) transmitted in the Beijing area during the epidemic outbreak of 2003, we sequenced 29 full-length S genes of SARS-CoV from 20 hospitalized SARS patients on our unit, the Beijing 302 Hospital. Viral RNA templates for the S-gene amplification were directly extracted from raw clinical samples, including plasma, throat swab, sputum, and stool, during the course of the epidemic in the Beijing area. We used a TAcloning assay with direct analysis of nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products in sequence. One hundred thirteen sequence variations with nine recurrent variant sites were identified in analyzed S-gene sequences compared with the BJ01 strain of SARS-CoV. Among them, eight variant sites were, we think, the first documented. Our findings demonstrate the coexistence of Sgene sequences with and without substitutions (compared to BJ01) in samples analyzed from some patients. a The results were determined by analysis of cloned sequences; + represents that nucleotide substitution at the variant site is detected and -represents that the nucleotide at the site is identical to the one of BJ01 reference sequence in all analyzed sequences. b SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; SW, throat swab; PL, plasma; SP, sputum; ST, stool. c The numbers represent the ratio of reference to variant nucleotide detected at the site from the analyzed cloned sequences.
