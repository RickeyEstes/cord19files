Abstract Treatment and control of acute neonatal diarrhea in calves are outlined and discussed. The difficulty in making a definitive etiological diagnosis makes effective treatment and control also difficult and largely empirical. Physiological events in calves with diarrhea are known, and fluid therapy is directed toward treating dehydration and acidosis. Whether affected calves should receive antibacterial agents orally is an open question. Principles of control of diarrhea in calves are outlined and discussed.
