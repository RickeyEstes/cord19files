We examined the relation between cigarette smoking and (1) the occurrence of in¯uenza, (2) the ecacy of in¯uenza vaccination and (3) the antibody response to in¯uenza vaccination in ®fteen family practices in South-Limburg, the Netherlands, during the in¯uenza season 1991±1992. Data were used from a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial into the ecacy of in¯uenza vaccination in which smoking status was measured 10 weeks after the start of the trial. A total of 1838 subjects aged 60 years or older, of whom 1531 subjects (321 smokers, 1152 non-smokers and 58 cigar/pipe smokers) who returned the smoking questionnaire and were not previously vaccinated, were used in the analyses. The main outcome measures were serological in¯uenza (fourfold increase of antibody titre between 3 weeks and 5 months after vaccination); clinical in¯uenza as determined by criteria of the Dutch Sentinel Stations from self reported symptoms in postal questionnaires 10 weeks and 5 months after vaccination; increases after vaccination and decreases after 5 months in logarithmic titres of antibody against the vaccine strains. No relation between smoking and either serological or clinical in¯uenza was found, although the risk for serological in¯uenza was slightly (not signi®cantly) elevated in smokers compared to non-smokers. A statistical interaction was found between smoking and vaccination when serological in¯uenza was the outcome measure indicating that the ecacy of vaccination was greater in smokers than in non-smokers (comparison of model with and without interaction; likelihood ratio test, p < 0.0001). This ®nding is supported by a greater titre rise 3 weeks after vaccination for two out of four strains, but not by the antibody response after vaccination in previous studies on in¯uenza and other infectious diseases. Also, this possible dierence of immunogenicity is not re¯ected in a better protection for clinical in¯uenza. The rise in antibody titre 3 weeks after vaccination was higher in smokers for A/Singapore/6/86 and B/Beijing/11/87, but not for the other two strains. Decline in titres after 5 months was similar for smokers and non-smokers. We conclude that smoking has no clinical or preventive signi®cance for risk of in¯uenza in the elderly. #
