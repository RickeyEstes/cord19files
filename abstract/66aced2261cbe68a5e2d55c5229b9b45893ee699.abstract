Nagano, H., Yagyu, K. and Ohta, S., 1989. Purification of infectious bronchitis coronavirus by Sephacryl S-1000 gel chromatography. Vet. Microbiol., A procedure was developed to purify infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) by gel chromatography (GC) with a Sephacryl S-1000 column. Virus samples concentrated by centrifugation were applied to a Sephacryl S-1000 column and eluted by 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2 ) containing 0.15 M NaC1. Virus particles were recovered mainly in the first peak. Purity of the samples was evaluated by both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. Using electron microscopy, it was found that there were more spike-rich particles in the virus samples purified by GC than in those purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (SDGC). In addition, the hemagglutination unit [logzo (infectivity titer/hemagglutination titer ) ] of GCpurified virus samples was ~ 10 times lower than that of SDGC-purified virus samples. These results indicate that Sephacryl S-1000 gel chromatography is useful for purification of IBV.
