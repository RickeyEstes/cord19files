In the last decade, there has been an explosion in the use of G-quadruplex labels to detect various analytes, including DNA/RNA, proteins, metals and other metabolites. In this review, we focus on strategies for the detection of nucleic acids, using G-quadruplexes as detection labels or as enzyme labels that amplify detection signals. Methods to detect other analytes are briefly mentioned. We highlight various strategies, including split G-quadruplex, hemin-G-quadruplex conjugates, molecular beacon G-quadruplex or inhibited G-quadruplex probes. The tandem use of G-quadruplex labels with various DNA-modifying enzymes, such as polymerases (used for rolling circle amplification), exonucleases and endonucleases, is also discussed. Some of the detection modalities that are discussed in this review include fluorescence, colorimetric, chemiluminescence, and electrochemical methods. Ó 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 2. G-quadruplex-based amplification methodologies without protein enzymes Nucleic acid containing four or higher tracts of guanines can form peroxidase mimicking DNAzymes. Several groups, including Kolpashchikov, Willner, Wang and Sintim, have designed a system whereby the G-quadruplex is split into two probes that lacked peroxidase activity but upon template-assisted formation of G-quadruplex from the split fragments, peroxidation activity is restored (Fig. 1) [21] [22] [23] [24] . Two types of split G-quadruplexes, symmetric [21-23,25,26] and asymmetric [24, 27, 28] , have been described. Split G-quadruplex probes (Figs. 1-4) have equivalent guanine composition whereas asymmetric G-quadruplex probes (Figs. 1, 5 and 6) have nonequivalent guanine contents. The symmetric G-quadruplex probe consists of two regions, an analyte binding arm and a G-quadruplex forming region. The two 1046-2023/$ -see front matter Ó
