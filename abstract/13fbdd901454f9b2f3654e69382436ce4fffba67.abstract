It has been estimated that respiratory disease consumes 20 per cent of general practitioner services and that it costs over £25 million per year. Similarly, hospital expenditure related to such illnesses (calculated in terms of cost per hospital bed) amounts to about £l billion per year. The term 'respiratory disease' covers many different illnesses and it is always a good idea to provide estimates for specific illnesses as well as respiratory disease in general. Influenza accounts for 25-75 per cent of the GP services mentioned above. These figures are based on inter-epidemic years and when there is an epidemic the hospitalization rates for adults with high risk medical conditions increase fivefold. All of these figures are approximations, but they show we are dealing with illnesses which have a large impact on the health services. Absenteeism figures also show that these illnesses have large economic consequences. For example, in the Hong Kong epidemic of 1968 it was estimated that over 26 million working days were lost due to incapacity from influenza. Even in inter-epidemic years this figure can be as high as 7-10 million days. In economic terms it has been estimated that in the 1974-5 influenza outbreaks over £100 million was lost in productivity and in the amount paid out in sickness benefits. The impact of influenza can be highlighted by comparing it with other disorders. For example, influenza accounts for 10-12 per cent of all absences from work, which is about the same as those due to musculo-skeletal disorders and twice the number due to psychiatric disorders. Colds and influenza affect most of the population (it has been estimated that we have between one and three colds a year), and we spend over £100 HANDBOOK OF HUMAN PERFORMANCE All rights of reproduction in any form reserved 198 million per year on medication for them. It is highly desirable, therefore, that we increase our knowledge of these illnesses, with the practical aims of lowering health care costs, decreasing absenteeism from work, and improving the quality of life. This involves considering the effects of such illnesses on performance efficiency and safety, which is the central theme of this chapter. Tye (1960) produced a report on the relationship between influenza and accidents. This report was based largely on anecdotal reports of influenza being the cause of many different types of accident. Indeed, the impetus for the report was the following account given by a man who had slammed the door of his car and trapped the fingers of his small son, permanently damaging two of them. Ί wasn't thinking', he said. 'Normally I always watch for that sort of thing, but my head was a bit muzzy at the time. I had a touch of flu coming on '
