• A stochastic epidemic model with media coverage is developed. • The global dynamics of the deterministic model is shown. • The stochastic dynamics of the SDE model is given. • The existence of a unique stationary distribution of the SDE model is displayed. This paper aims to study an SIS epidemic model with media coverage from a general deterministic model to a stochastic differential equation with environment fluctuation. Mathematically, we use the Markov semigroup theory to prove that the basic reproduction number R s 0 can be used to control the dynamics of stochastic system. Epidemiologically, we show that environment fluctuation can inhibit the occurrence of the disease, namely, in the case of disease persistence for the deterministic model, the disease still dies out with probability one for the stochastic model. So to a great extent the stochastic perturbation under media coverage affects the outbreak of the disease.
