Background Avian infl uenza A H6N1 virus is one of the most common viruses isolated from wild and domestic avian species, but human infection with this virus has not been previously reported. We report the clinical presentation, contact, and environmental investigations of a patient infected with this virus, and assess the origin and genetic characteristics of the isolated virus. Methods A 20-year-old woman with an infl uenza-like illness presented to a hospital with shortness of breath in May, 2013. An unsubtyped infl uenza A virus was isolated from her throat-swab specimen and was transferred to the Taiwan Centres for Disease Control (CDC) for identifi cation. The medical records were reviewed to assess the clinical presentation. We did a contact and environmental investigation and collected clinical specimens from the case and symptomatic contacts to test for infl uenza virus. The genomic sequences of the isolated virus were determined and characterised. Interpretation This is the fi rst report of human infection with a wild avian infl uenza A H6N1 virus. A unique clade of H6N1 viruses with a G228S substitution of haemagglutinin have circulated persistently in poultry in Taiwan. These viruses continue to evolve and accumulate changes, increasing the potential risk of human-to-human transmission. Our report highlights the continuous need for preparedness for a pandemic of unpredictable and complex avian infl uenza.
