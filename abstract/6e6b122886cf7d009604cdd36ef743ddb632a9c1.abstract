A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed to rapidly detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The assay, based on multiple primer and probe sets located in different regions of the SARS-CoV genome, could discriminate SARS-CoV from other human and animal coronaviruses with a potential detection limit of <10 genomic copies per reaction. The real-time RT-PCR assay was more sensitive than a conventional RT-PCR assay or culture isolation and proved suitable to detect SARS-CoV in clinical specimens. Application of this assay will aid in diagnosing SARS-CoV infection. a RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; F, forward primer; R, reverse primer; P, probe. b Location based on the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus, Urbani strain (GenBank accession no.
