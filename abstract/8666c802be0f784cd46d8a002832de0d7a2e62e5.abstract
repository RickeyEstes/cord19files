The unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) constitutes a critical component of host innate immunity against microbial infections. In this report, we show that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) utilizes the UPR machinery for its own benefit. We provide evidence that the virus targets the UPR central regulator GRP78 for proteasomal degradation via a mechanism that requires viral glycoprotein GP2a, while both IRE1-XBP1s and PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 signaling branches of the UPR are turned on at early stage of infection. The activated effector XBP1s was found to enter the nucleus, but ATF4 was unexpectedly diverted to cytoplasmic viral replication complexes by means of nonstructural proteins nsp2/3 to promote viral RNA synthesis. RNAi knockdown of either ATF4 or XBP1s dramatically attenuated virus titers, while overexpression caused increases. These observations reveal attractive host targets (e.g., ATF4 and XBP1s) for antiviral drugs and have implications in vaccine development. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) poses a major threat to the worldwide swine industry, but no effective vaccines or antiviral drugs are available. A better understanding of the pathogen-host interactions that support PRRSV replication is essential for understanding viral pathogenesis and the development of preventive measures. Here we report that PRRSV utilizes unconventional strategies to reprogram the unfolded protein response (UPR) of the host to its own advantage. The virus targets GRP78 for partial degradation to create a favorable environment for UPR induction and hijacks ATF4 into cytoplasmic replication complexes to promote viral RNA synthesis. The data also reveal potential targets (e.g., ATF4 and XBP1s) for antiviral drugs and have implications in vaccine development.

Data are presented as means ± standard deviations (SD) of three independent experiments. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008169.g001 Fig 2. Knockdown of GRP78 activates ER stress. MARC-145 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting GRP78 (siGRP78) or scrambled siRNA (siNC). At 36 h post transfection, the cells were analyzed for UPR activation. (A) Analysis of knockdown efficiency of GRP78 by Western blot. (B) Detection of XBP1 mRNA splicing in siRNA-treated cells. The XBP1 gene was amplified by RT-PCR followed by enzyme digestion with Pst I and analyzed by separation on a 1.5% agarose gel. (C) Western blot analysis of the expression and phosphorylation status of indicated proteins. (D) Effect of GRP78 knockdown effect on the ATF4 activation by IFA staining. The relative fluorescence intensity of nuclear ATF4 were quantified by using image J (N = 50). Oil objective: 63 X; zoom in 1 X. Data information: Statistical analysis was performed by two-tailed Student's t-test, and the data represent means ± standard deviations (SD).
