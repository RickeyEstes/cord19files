Host shifts, where a pathogen invades and establishes in a new host species, are a major source of 17 emerging infectious diseases. They frequently occur between related host species and often rely on 18 the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species. To 19 investigate genetic changes in novel hosts, we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an RNA 20 virus (Drosophila C Virus) in 19 different species of Drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral 21 genomes. We found a strong pattern of parallel evolution, where viral lineages from the same host 22 were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species. When we 23 compared viruses that had evolved in different host species, we found that parallel genetic changes 24 were more likely to occur if the two host species were closely related. This suggests that when a 25 virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species. This 26 may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species, and may mean that when 27 a new pathogen appears in a given species, closely related species may become vulnerable to the 28 new disease.
