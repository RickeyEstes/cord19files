KEYWORDS Gastrointestinal nematodes Lungworm Liver fluke Vaccines Only a few vaccines against parasitic helminths of livestock are currently on the market; namely those against Dictyocaulus viviparus in cattle, Haemonchus contortus in sheep, and the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus in sheep. Research is ongoing to develop vaccines based on purified or recombinantly expressed worm proteins for Ostertagia ostertagi and Cooperia oncophora in cattle, for Teladorsagia circumcincta and H contortus in sheep, and for Fasciola hepatica in ruminants. Recombinant expression of worm antigens with the correct conformation to induce protective immunity is still a major challenge in vaccine development. Vaccination is likely to be part of integrated worm control, together with other control measures, such as anthelmintic treatments, biological control, and grazing management. Interdisciplinary research, including social sciences, should investigate drivers of farmers' and veterinarians' decision making, to optimize uptake of vaccination by the end users.
