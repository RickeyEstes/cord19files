Pelvic floor morbidity up to one year after difficult instrumental delivery and cesarean section in the second stage of labor: A cohort study 4 Rachel E. Liebling, MRCOG, Rebecca Swingler, MB, ChB, Roshni R. Patel, MRCOG, Lisa Verity, MRCOG, Peter W. Soothill, MD, FRCOG, Deirdre J. Murphy, MD, MRCOG Bath, Bristol, Plymouth, and Dundee, United Kingdom Women are more likely to report significant symptoms related to pelvic floor morbidity after ÔdifficultÕ instrumental vaginal deliveries compared with cesarean section at full dilatation. This is one of a flurry of articles on the long-term consequences of various aspects of vaginal delivery, in this case, operative vaginal delivery. The accompanying editorial by Dr Hurt has identified the concerns in this article, which are both current and have meaning for the ethics and morality of what we have been taught. It raises serious questions for the future. With the conflict between the concern for controlling unnecessary cesarean sections, the pendulum swinging away from VBAC, and now with ACOG endorsing primary elective cesarean delivery as a patient's option, the information in this and other similar articles becomes crucial in trying to make sense of this dilemma. A maternal serum vitamin B 12 concentration of < 185 pmol/L is associated with a 3.5-fold increased risk of an offspring with spina bifida. Advanced age was associated with continued pessary use; stage III-IV rectocele and desire for surgery were associated with discontinued pessary use and surgery. Women without pubococcygeal muscle are half as likely to increase urethral closure pressure during a pelvic muscle contraction compared with women with bilaterally intact muscle. Satisfaction after the tension-free vaginal tape sling procedure is most dependent on subjective success and normal bladder storage and voiding function.
