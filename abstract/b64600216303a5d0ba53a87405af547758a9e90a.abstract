As discussed in the main text, the ProtoArrays' signal analysis in both Stage I and Stage II of the investigation involved multi-step processing. In both steps, aggregate raw signals ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ) were normalized within each array, using an implementation of the ProCAT algorithm 1 . Briefly, the algorithm was utilized with parameters implementing a sliding window of length 15, to take into account local background subtraction as well as local intensity normalization across each array. The normalized signal for each position i,j on the protein array is calculated using the sliding window signals and backgrounds as, M ij = Mean({window foreground signals}) , (foreground refers to either 635 nm wavelength for GST tag signal, or 532 nm wavelength for IgG reactivity signal), S ij ∈ {window signals} , MAbsDev ij = Mean({| S ij − M ij |}) , is the mean absolute deviation of the foreground window signals from the mean of the local sliding window, and b S,ij ∈ {local smoothed background} is the smoothed background of the local window. The smoothed background averages the local immediate background surrounding the spot of interest. Negative low signals (due to signal being smaller than background) are replaced by the minimum detectable signal value. The subsequent quantile normalization of the ProCAT normed arrays puts all distributions on the same scale based on rank, with ties replaced by the average of the values 2 . After Mann
