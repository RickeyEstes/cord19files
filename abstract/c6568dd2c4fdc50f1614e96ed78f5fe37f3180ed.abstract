Respiratory viruses, particularly influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses, are ubiquitous pathogens among humans, especially among young children. However, relatively little is known about the impact of these common infections on individuals with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A review of the literature identifies three key areas that need further exploration. First, moderate-to-severe and even fatal lower respiratory viral illnesses in infected adults and children. The frequency of prolonged shedding in this population has not been well defined, but data from a small newborn cohort study suggest that, at least for RSV, prolonged shedding is common. Prolonged respiratory viral shedding has implications for infection control in medical facilities where HIVinfected individuals are treated and in nursing homes, child care centers, and group foster homes that provide care for HIV-infected individuals. Therapies to help eliminate these chronic viral infections should be explored. Finally, indirect evidence suggests that respiratory viral infection may result in changes in HIV replication and, theoretically, HIV disease
