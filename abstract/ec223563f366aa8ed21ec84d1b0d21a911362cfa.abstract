Using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from poliovirus (PV) as our model system, we 26 have shown that Lys-359 in motif-D functions as a general acid in the mechanism of nucleotidyl 27 transfer. A K359H (KH) RdRp derivative is slow and faithful relative to wild-type enzyme. In the 28 context of the virus, RdRp-coding sequence evolves, selecting for the following substitutions: I331F 29 (IF, motif-C) and P356S (PS, motif-D). We have evaluated IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH viruses and 30 enzymes. The speed and fidelity of each double mutant are equivalent. Each exhibits a unique 31 recombination phenotype, with IF-KH being competent for copy-choice recombination and PS-KH 32 being competent for forced-copy-choice recombination. Although the IF-PS-KH RdRp exhibits 33 biochemical properties within twofold of wild type, the virus is impaired substantially for 34 recombination in cells. We conclude that there are biochemical properties of the RdRp in addition to 35 speed and fidelity that determine the mechanism and efficiency of recombination. The interwoven 36 nature of speed, fidelity, the undefined property suggested here, and recombination makes it impossible 37 to attribute a single property of the RdRp to fitness. However, the derivatives described here may 38 permit elucidation of the importance of recombination on the fitness of the viral population in a 39 background of constant polymerase speed and fidelity. 40 41 Significance 42 The availability of a "universal" method to create attenuated viruses for use as vaccine strains would 43 permit a rapid response to outbreaks of newly emerging viruses. Targeting RdRp fidelity has emerged 44 as such a universal approach. However, because polymerase fidelity and speed are inextricably linked, 45 the effort to attribute the attenuated phenotype to a single biochemical property of the RdRp may be 46 futile. Here, we show that this circumstance is even more complex. We provide evidence for the 47 existence of a biochemical parameter that combines with fidelity and speed to govern the mechanism 48 .

We conclude that the field will be served best by continued 49 emphasis on discovery of manipulatable functions of the RdRp instead of debating the importance of 50 individual properties. 51 52 56 pathogens), viral outbreaks over the past few decades have been caused by viruses for which 57 surveillance was not considered a priority. Rapid response to an outbreak caused by an unexpected 58 viral pathogen requires, minimally, the existence of broad-spectrum, antiviral therapeutics. Prevention 59 requires the availability of vaccines, development of which could take years. Indeed, approved 60 vaccines still do not exist to prevent infections by West Nile virus or severe acute respiratory syndrome 61 (SARS) coronavirus, and these outbreaks occurred more than one decade ago. 62 Because all RNA viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) with conserved 63 function and mechanism, this enzyme has emerged as an attractive target for development of broad-64 spectrum therapeutics (1-3) and a target for function/mechanism-based strategies for viral attenuation 65 (4-9). One function/mechanism of the RdRp that has been targeted most is that required for faithful 66 incorporation of nucleotides (4-9). Changing RdRp fidelity decreases or increases the genetic variation 67 of the viral population, which, in turn, decreases fitness and virulence of the viral population (10-15). 68 Known RdRp variants exhibiting a high-fidelity phenotype can also exhibit a reduced speed of 69 nucleotide incorporation, at least at the biochemical level (16). Replication speed is also a determinant 70 of viral fitness and virulence (17). So, is it the increased fidelity or decreased speed of nucleotide 71 .

Further complicating the fidelity-versus-speed 72 question are the recent observations that changes to fidelity also have consequence for the efficiency of 73 recombination (18-23). Increased RdRp fidelity decreases recombination efficiency and vice versa 74 (18-23). It will likely be impossible to attribute a single biochemical property of the RdRp to 75 biological outcome. 76 The most extensively studied PV fidelity mutants encode RdRps with amino acid substitutions at 77 sites remote from the active site. Constructing equivalent substitutions conferring equivalent 78 phenotypes in RdRps other than PV is difficult if not impossible. Our laboratory has therefore pursued 79 active-site-based strategies to manipulate the fidelity, speed, and/or recombination efficiency of the 80 RdRp (24). We have shown that a lysine (Lys-359 in PV) present in conserved structural motif D of 81 the RdRp contributes to the efficiency of nucleotidyl transfer (24). A PV mutant encoding a K359R 82 RdRp is attenuated but elicits a protective immune response in mice that is at least as robust as the 83 immune response elicited by the type 1 Sabin vaccine strain (6). In this study, we characterize a second motif-D mutant of PV (K359H). Unlike the K359R RdRp-85 encoding virus (6), K359H PV is genetically unstable and acquires mutations encoding two second-site 86 amino acid substitutions after a few passages in cell culture. Together, the two substitutions restore all 87 biochemical properties of the derivative to near wild-type levels. Individually, however, we observe 88 differences in the mechanism (copy-choice vs. forced-copy-choice) and efficiency of recombination by 89 each derivative, although each derivative exhibits equivalent speed and fidelity. We conclude that 90 biochemical properties in addition to speed and fidelity must exist and contribute to both the 91 mechanism and efficiency of recombination. The desire to attribute single, biochemical properties of 92 the viral RdRp to fitness, virulence, and pathogenesis may be futile. Results K359H PV requires two second-site substitutions to restore a "wild-type" growth phenotype 96 Most studies of RdRp fidelity have benefited from the selection of derivatives that were either 97 more or less sensitive to a mutagenic nucleoside (25-30). Almost invariably, the derivatives changed 98 residues remote from the catalytic site, thus using an allosteric mechanism to perturb fidelity. Among 99 the most famous of these is the G64S substitution in PV RdRp (15, 16, 26). Many years ago, our 100 laboratory showed that the active site of all polymerases contain a general acid, Lys-359 in the case of 101 PV RdRp, that protonated the pyrophosphate leaving group during nucleotidyl transfer, thereby 102 increasing the catalytic efficiency of RdRp (24). Substitutions of Lys-359 in PV RdRp give rise to 103 changes in fidelity (6, 17). The arginine substitution of Lys-359 (K359R RdRp) and the histidine 104 substitution (K359H RdRp) catalyze nucleotidyl transfer at a rate 10-fold lower than wild type (24).
