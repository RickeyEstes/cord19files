Table S1: Definitions Variable/Parameter Definition β Infection rate or infection probability. γ Recovery rate. t r Recovery time. T Transmissibility. θ t Probability that a neighbor of a root node has not transmitted yet the disease to the root node at time t. Φ S (t) Probability that a neighbor of a root node is susceptible at time t. Φ I (t) Probability that an infected neighbor of a root node has not transmitted the disease to the root node at time t. Φ R (t) Probability that a neighbor is recovered at time t without having transmitted the disease to the root node. In the EBCM approach, θ t is the probability that a root node has not being infected by a neighbor at time t. This is possible if the neighbor is susceptible, recovered, or infected but has not transmitted the disease yet to the root, which happens with probabilities Φ S (t), Φ R (t) and Φ I (t), respectively. Then, θ t = Φ S (t) + Φ I (t) + Φ R (t). The probability that a root node of connectivity k is susceptible is θ k and the fraction of susceptible nodes is S(t) = k P (k)θ k t = G 0 (θ t ). On the other hand, a neighbor is susceptible with 1
