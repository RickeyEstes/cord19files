Much larger studies would be necessary to show important differences in mortality. Despite the similar age range, packed cell volume, and admission parasite counts in the moderate and severe malaria groups, both drugs produced more rapid parasite clearance in the former than in the latter. This finding suggests either reduced splenic clearance function or a larger biomass of sequestered parasites in severe malaria.10 Absorption and disposition indices of chloroquine are similar in uncomplicated and severe disease,1,8 and pharmacokinetic factors would not therefore explain the difference. How parasitised erythrocytes (largely ring forms) are removed from the circulation after drug treatment is not fully understood, but this mechanism may be distinct from the ability of an antimalarial drug to inhibit and kill the mature parasites sequestered in the microcirculation of vital organs.1o In 1989, when this study was done, chloroquine was a highly effective treatment for falciparum malaria in The Gambia. However, resistance has developed rapidly. By 1990, parasite clearance measures were longer, and Rl and R2 resistance was seen in half the patients admitted to the same study sites (unpublished). High-grade resistance will soon preclude the use of chloroquine in severe malaria. Other treatments are needed urgently. The artemesinin compounds are promising. However, there is no evidence yet that they can save more lives than quinine (or chloroquine) given in appropriate doses. This issue will only be resolved satisfactorily by a large comparative study with mortality as the endpoint. We thank the nursing and medical staff of the Royal Victoria PP.
