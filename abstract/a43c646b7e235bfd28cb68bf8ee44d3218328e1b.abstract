KEYWORDS Pneumonia Hematopoietic cell transplantation Hematologic malignancy Community respiratory virus infection Cytomegalovirus Viral pneumonia is a common pulmonary complication in patients with HCT/HM and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Because of nonspecific imaging findings, and high rates of coinfection with other viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens, microbiologic diagnosis generally requires bronchoalveolar lavage with samples sent for culture, direct fluorescent antibody and nucleic acid testing as available. CMV remains the most common cause of viral pneumonia in HCT/HM, but adoption of preemptive therapy strategies and changes in transplant techniques over the last few decades have resulted in significant improvement in the incidence and mortality associated with CMV pneumonia. Community respiratory virus (CRV) infections, such as influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus, are common. Fewer patients develop lower tract disease; however, once established, mortality rates are high. Infection prevention practices in the community and health care setting are critical in limiting the acquisition and spread of CRVs in this highly susceptible patient population. Presenting signs and symptoms of viral pneumonia are variable. Most patients have fever and cough, with hypoxia and increased work of breathing of varying degrees depending on the extent of the infection. Upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, myalgias, and fatigue, may be present for infections caused by community respiratory viruses (CRVs).
