logistic regression was used on serological data collected in the context of the Sardinian African swine fever (ASF) eradication program from pig farms in the province of Nuoro, Sardinia. The monthly percentage of ASFV-positive herds decreased significantly from October 1994 through March 1996 (P < 0.001). The farm-level risk of seropositivity to African swine fever virus (ASFV) was higher in free-range farms than in partial-confinement farms (odds ratios (OR) varied between 4.9 in October 1994, and 5.7 in March 1996, P < 0.001). The risk of infection for total-confinement farms was one-fifth of the risk for partial-confinement farms in October 1994 (OR = 0.2, P < O.OOl), whereas in March 1996, the estimated OR was 0.57 and not significaunt (upper confidence limit = 1.1). The maintenance of ASFV in Sardinia was primarily associated with free-range pig farms. The natural logarithm of the number of pigs tested per visit in a farm was positively associated with the risk of herd seropositivity (OR = 2.6, P < 0.001). 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. * No seropositive pig was found, out of the 7497 that were tested, in 181 visits in intensive nontraditional farms. Data relative to this husbandry system were not included in our analyses. A. Mannelli et al. /Preventive Veterinary Medicine 32 (1997) [235][236][237][238][239][240][241]
