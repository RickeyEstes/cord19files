Exchange of the extremities of the NS segment of type A and C influenza viruses in reverse genetics systems was used to assess their putative role in type specificity. Restoration of each specific proximal panhandle was mandatory to allow the rescue of viruses with heterotypic extremities. Moreover, the transcription level of the modified segment seemed to be directly affected by the distal panhandle strength.
