Three-dimensional (3D) structure is now known for a large fraction of all protein families. Thus, it has become rather likely that one will find a homolog with known 3D structure when searching a sequence database with an arbitrary query sequence. Depending on the extent of similarity, such neighbor relationships may allow one to infer biological function and to identify functional sites such as binding motifs or catalytic centers. Entrez's 3D-structure database, the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), provides easy access to the richness of 3D structure data and its large potential for functional annotation. Entrez's search engine offers several tools to assist biologist users: (i) links between databases, such as between protein sequences and structures, (ii) precomputed sequence and structure neighbors, (iii) visualization of structure and sequence/structure alignment. Here, we describe an annotation service that combines some of these tools automatically, Entrez's 'Related Structure' links. For all proteins in Entrez, similar sequences with known 3D structure are detected by BLAST and alignments are recorded. The 'Related Structure' service summarizes this information and presents 3D views mapping sequence residues onto all 3D structures available in MMDB (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=structure). CONTENT The molecular modeling database (MMDB) is Entrez's 'Structure' database (1). Querying MMDB with text terms, e.g. one may identify structures of interest based on a protein name. Links between databases provide other search mechanisms. A query of Entrez PubMed database, e.g. will identify articles citing a particular protein name. Links from this set of articles to 'Structure' may identify structures not found by direct query, since PubMed abstracts contain additional descriptive terms. Currently, MMDB and its visualization services handle 25 000 user queries per day.
