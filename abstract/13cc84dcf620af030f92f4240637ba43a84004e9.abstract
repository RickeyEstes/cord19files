We have studied the role of restrictions to lateral mobility in the segregation of proteins to apical and basolateral domains of MDCK epithelial cells. Radioimmunoassay and semiquantitative video analysis of immunofluorescence on frozen sections showed that one apical and three basolateral glycoproteins, defined by monoclonal antibodies and binding of beta-2microglobulin, were incompletely extracted with 0.5 % Triton X-100 in a buffer that preserves the cortical cytoskeleton (Fey, E.
