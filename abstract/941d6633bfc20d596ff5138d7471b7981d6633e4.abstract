Both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are zoonotic pathogens that crossed the species barriers to infect humans. The mechanism of viral interspecies transmission is an important scientific question to be addressed. These coronaviruses contain a surface-located spike (S) protein that initiates infection by mediating receptor-recognition and membrane fusion and is therefore a key factor in host specificity. In addition, the S protein needs to be cleaved by host proteases before executing fusion, making these proteases a second determinant of coronavirus interspecies infection. Here, we summarize the progress made in the past decade in understanding the cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by focusing on the features of the S protein, its receptor-binding characteristics, and the cleavage process involved in priming. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large, enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that can infect both animals and humans [1] . The viruses are further subdivided, based on genotypic and serological characters, into four genera: Alpha-, Beta-, and Deltacoronavirus [2, 3] . Thus far, all identified CoVs that can infect humans belong to the first two genera. These include the alphacoronaviruses (alphaCoVs) hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-229E and the betacoronaviruses (betaCoVs) HCoV-OC43, HKU1, 4, 5] . Special attention has been paid to betaCoVs, which have caused two unexpected coronaviral Feature Review 0966-842X/ ÃŸ
