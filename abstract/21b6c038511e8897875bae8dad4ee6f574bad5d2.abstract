We report the impact of respiratory viruses on various outbreak settings by using surveillance data from the late first and second wave periods of the 2009 pandemic. A total of 278 ⁄ 345(78AE5%) outbreaks tested positive for at least one respiratory virus by multiplex PCR. We detected A(H1N1)pdm09 in 20AE6% of all reported outbreaks of which 54AE9% were reported by camps, schools, and day cares (CSDs) and 29AE6% by long-term care facilities (LCFTs), whereas enterovirus ⁄ human rhinovirus (ENT ⁄ HRV) accounted for 62% outbreaks of which 83AE7% were reported by long-term care facilities (LCTFs). ENT ⁄ HRV was frequently identified in LTCF outbreaks involving elderly residents, whereas in CSDs, A(H1N1)pdm09 was primarily detected.
