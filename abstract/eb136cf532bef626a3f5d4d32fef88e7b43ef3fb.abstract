Golgi a-mannosidase II (G1cNAc transferase 1-dependent a1,3[a1,6] mannosidase, EC 3.2.1.114) catalyzes the final hydrolytic step in the N-glycan maturation pathway acting as the committed step in the conversion of high mannose to complex type structures . We have isolated overlapping clones from a murine cDNA library encoding the full length a-mannosidase II open reading frame and most of the 5' and 3' untranslated region . The coding sequence predicts a type II transmembrane protein with a short cytoplasmic tail (five amino acids), a single transmembrane domain (21 amino acids), and a large COOH-terminal catalytic domain (1,124 amino acids) . This domain organization which is shared with the Golgi glycosyltransferases suggests that the common structural motifs may have a functional role in Golgi enzyme function or localization . Three sets of polyadenylated clones were isolated extending 3' beyond the open reading frame by as N AND O-GLYCAN structures are increasingly being found to contribute to biological recognition events during development, oncogenic transformation, and cell adhesion (3, 10, 11, 37, 38, 40) . The enzymes involved in the maturation of cell surface and intracellular N-glycans are found in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex where they act upon newly synthesized glycoproteins to generate an array of different structures from a common oligosaccharide precursor (18). The N-glycan processing pathway consists of three stages : (a) the initial synthesis of a dolichol-linked precursor oligosaccharide and the en bloc transfer of the oligosaccharide to newly synthesized polypeptide Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons on the lumenal face of the ER; (b) the trimming of the high mannose structures by a-glucosidases and a-mannosidases in the ER and Golgi complex; and (c) the elaboration of the branched oligosaccharide chains by Golgi glycosyltransferases . The trimming phase of the pathway is accomplished by a-glucosidases I and II as well as a collection of processing a1,2-mannosidases (29) in the ER and Golgi complex. The resulting Man5GlcNAc2 structure is then modified by the addition of much as 2,543 bp . Northern blots suggest that these polyadenylated clones totaling 6.1 kb in length correspond to minor message species smaller than the full length message. The largest and predominant message on Northern blots (7.5 kb) presumably extends another N1.4-kb downstream beyond the longest of the isolated clones. Transient expression of the a-mannosidase II cDNA in COS cells resulted in 8-12-fold overexpression of enzyme activity, and the appearance of crossreactive material in a perinuclear membrane array consistent with a Golgi localization . A region within the catalytic domain of the a-mannosidase II open reading frame bears a strong similarity to a corresponding sequence in the rat liver endoplasmic reticulum a-mannosidase and the vacuolar a-mannosidase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Partial human a-mannosidase II cDNA clones were also isolated and the gene was localized to human chromosome 5. a single G1cNAc by G1cNAc transferase I (GnT 1),' before the final hydrolytic steps in the pathway are accomplished by a-mannosidase II (Man 11), catalyzing the removal of a1,3and a1,6-mannosyl residues (50) . The trimming and elongation phases ofthe pathway overlap at the GnT I/Man II steps, with each reaction being obligatory for further processing steps. GnT I is essential for processing to hybrid or complex type structures (34), while the absence of Man II activity, either by inhibition with the alkaloid, swainsonine (52), or in the human autosomal genetic disease hereditary erythroblastic multinuclearity associated with positive acidified serum (HEMPAS), characterized by the reduced expression of Man 11(12), results in the accumulation of Asn-linked hybrid oligosaccharides in lieu of the standard array of complex type structures .
