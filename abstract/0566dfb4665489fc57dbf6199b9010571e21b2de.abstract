Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp. are small coccidian Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Colorado State University. Samples were evaluated using the Merifluor xu Cryptosporidium/Giardia Direct Immunofluorescent Detection Procedure. One horse (0.33%) was detected positive for Cryptosporidium and two horses (0.66%) were positive for Giardia. The low prevalence of Cryptosporidia and Giardia in the trail horse population surveyed indicates that the adult recreational trail horse population is not likely to be a significant source of Cryptosporidium and Giardia environmental contamination in watershed areas.
