The ear can be divided into three anatomic regions: the external ear, which consists of the auricle or pinna and the external auditory meatus; the middle ear, which is formed by the tympanic cavity and connects to the pharynx by way of the Eustachian tube; and the inner ear, which consists of a membranous and bony labyrinth that functions for hearing and balance. The middle ear and the external ear are separated by the tympanic membrane, and the auditory meatus marks the opening of the horizontal canal into the middle ear. The auditory ossicles connect the tympanic membrane to the inner ear. The external ear varies in size and shape according to the breed of dog. The appearance of the canine pinna is dependent on the auricular cartilage. The auricular cartilage is elastic and thin at the apex and then rolls into a semitube at the base. The pinna is covered with skin on both sides, which is closely attached to the perichondrium of the auricular cartilage. The pinna functions to capture, focus, and localize sound. The free edge of the auricular cartilage is called the helix. It is divided into medial and lateral parts that unite at the apex of the ear. The antihelix is a low horizontal ridge with a prominent tubercle located on the medial wall of the entrance into the ear canal (Fig. 1) . Opposite the anthelix and forming the lateral wall of the entrance to the external ear canal is a dense cartilage plate called the tragus. The antitragus is a thin cartilaginous plate caudal to the tragus. The caudal auricular artery and vein branch and form the lateral, intermediate, and medial vascular rami that course along the convex surface of the pinna. The lateral, intermediate, and medial rami directly penetrate the scapha to supply the convex surface of the pinna. Survival of the pinna is directly dependent on maintaining the integrity of these rami.
