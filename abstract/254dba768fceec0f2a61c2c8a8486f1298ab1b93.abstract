The gradual liberalization of international air transport has largely benefited the traveling public. Progress since the development of concepts such as ''Open Skies'' in the late 1970s as an alternative to the restrictive bilateral air service agreements that had effectively controlled most international air transport since the mid-1940s has been uneven and spasmodic.
