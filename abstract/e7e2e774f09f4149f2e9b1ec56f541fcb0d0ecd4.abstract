The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) protein contains multiple conformation-dependent epitopes that induce neutralizing antibody responses. Here we used CHO-K1 cells to establish a cell line for stable expression of a 193-mer (residues 318-510) RBD (RBD193-CHO) and determined its antigenicity and immunogenicity. We found that RBD193-CHO reacted strongly with a panel of six monoclonal antibodies recognizing various conformational and linear epitopes in RBD, suggesting that this recombinant protein maintains intact conformation and good antigenicity. Immunization of mice with RBD193-CHO resulted in induction of high titers of RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies and potent IL-4-expressing T cell responses. RBD193-CHO induced immunity that protected a majority of the vaccinated mice from SARS-CoV challenge. These results suggest that the recombinant RBD produced in an established stable cell line maintains strong immunogenicity with high potential for use as an effective and economic subunit SARS vaccine.

To prevent the re-emergence of this infectious disease from potential animal reservoirs [1-3], it is necessary to develop effective vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the causative agent of SARS [4, 5] . Compared with other antiviral strategies, vaccines, particularly those based on the spike (S) protein, demonstrate greater efficacy in the prevention of SARS [6] . The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S protein contains multiple conformational-dependent epitopes that induce potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV infection [7, 8] , suggesting an attractive target for development of SARS vaccine. Therefore, establishment of an approach for producing large quantity of recombinant RBD with appropriate antigenicity and immunogenicity is needed. The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line has been widely used to express recombinant proteins and biopharmaceutical products in a stable and large-scale manner. As such, the selected CHO-K1 stable cell lines have been established to express persistently recombinant secreted proteins, such as dust mite allergen, Blo t 5 [9], human MUC1 mucin [10] and transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) [11] . Furthermore, when adapted to serum-free medium, recombinant proteins can be highly expressed in suspension cul-ture, making it possible to purify proteins from the suspension in large quantity [9] . Proteins obtained in this way have been shown to maintain biological activity and proper conformation [9, 11] . Therefore, the successful expression and purification of a number of recombinant proteins in CHO-K1 cells provides a rational basis for developing effective and economic subunit SARS vaccines by continuous production of recombinant proteins containing the functional domains of SARS-CoV S protein. Based on this reasoning, the present study aimed to express a 193-mer (residues 318-510) recombinant RBD of SARS-CoV S protein (RBD193-CHO) in an established stable CHO-K1 cell line and further determine its antigenicity, immunogenicity and protective immunity in a mouse model. Plasmid construction, protein transient expression and purification. Genes encoding a 193-amino acid (residues 318-510) RBD of SARS-CoV S protein were amplified by PCR using the plasmid containing the codon-optimized full-length S protein as the template [12, 13] , followed by insertion into the GS gene expression vector PEE14.1. The recombinant RBD plasmid was transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagents (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) into CHO-K1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Transfected F-12K medium (ATCC) was replaced by fresh OPTI-MEM I Reduced-Serum Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) 10 h post-trans-0006-291X/$ -see front matter Ó
