Besser, T.E., McGuire, T.C. and Gay, C.C., 1987. The transfer of serum IgG1 antibody into the gastrointestinal tract in newborn calves. Vet. Immun. hnmunopath., 17: 51-56. Transfer of functional blood IgG1 to the gastrointestinal tract was measured in neonatal calves. Radiolabelled immunoglobulin GI (IgGl) anti-DNP antibody was administered to 2 day old calves by intravenous injection. The serum clearance rate was measured and was compared to the rate of protein-bound 1251 excretion in the Feces over a I0 day period to determine the importance of transfer to the gastrointestinal tract as a mechanism of serum IgGl clearance. The amount of protein-bound and DNP-binding 1251 present in the gastrointestinal tract of I0 day old calves at necropsy was also measured. Fecal excretion of protein-bound 1251 accounted for 32% of the serum 1251-1gGl clearance. Protein-bound 1251 was present in the gastrointestinal tract at necropsy in amounts estimated to account for 68% of the total 1251-1gGl clearance, and retained 65Z of the DNP-binding ability of the original antibody, The discrepancy between the Fecal excretion (32% of total IgG1 clearance) and the GI clearance estimated from protein-bound 1251 in the gut (68% of total IgG1 clearance) is explained in part by IgGl proteolysis occurring after transfer to the gastrointestinal tract but before fecal excretion. These results indicate that transfer to the calf gastrointestinal tract accounts for most IgGl clearance in young calves, and that the intestinal antibody retains antigen binding function and may contribute to intestinal immunity.
