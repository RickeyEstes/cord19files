26 A novel zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the current global pandemic of 27 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Bats and pangolins are suspected as the reservoir and the 28 intermediate host. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein plays the key 29 role in the tight binding to human ACE2 for viral entry. In this study, we analyzed the worldwide 30 RBD mutations and found 10 mutants under high positive selection pressure during the spread. The 31 equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) of three RBD mutants emerging in Wuhan, Shenzhen, Hong 32 Kong and France were two orders of magnitude lower than the prototype Wuhan-Hu-1 strain due to 33 the stabilization of the beta-sheet scaffold of the RBD. This indicated that the mutated viruses have 34 evolved to acquire remarkably increased infectivity. Five France isolates and one Hong Kong 35 isolate shared the same RBD mutation enhancing the binding affinity, which suggested that they 36 may have originated as a novel sub-lineage. The K D values for the bat and the pangolin SARS-like 37 CoV RBDs indicated that it would be difficult and unlikely for this bat SARS-like CoV to infect 38 humans; however, the pangolin CoV is potentially infectious to humans with respect to its RBD. 39 These analyses of critical mutations of the RBD provide further insights into the molecular 40 evolution of SARS-CoV-2, presumably while under selection pressure. This enhancement of the 41 SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to its host receptor ACE2 reveals a higher risk of more severe 42 infections during a sustained pandemic of COVID-19 if no effective precautions are implemented. 43 44 1 .

Up to March 11, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 120,000 people world-wide, 51 causing more than 4,600 deaths with the mortality rate of 3.69% 5 . 52 53 The origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive. However, the initial cases were largely associated with 54 the seafood market, which indicated this were potential zoonotic infections 2 . Although bats and 55 pangolins are most likely the reservoir hosts and the intermediate hosts in the wild, more evidences 56 are in need to support the zoonotic infections and track the origin of this new coronavirus 6-8 . 57 58 The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been proven to the cellular receptor of 59 SARS-CoV-2, which is the same receptor of SARS-CoV. The spike glycoprotein protein (S) of 60 SARS-CoV-2 recognizes and attaches ACE2 when the viruses infect the cells. S protein consists of 61 a receptor-binding subunit S1 and a membrane-fusion subunit S2. Previous studies revealed that the 62 S1 binds to a receptor on the host cell surface for viral attachment, and S2 fuses the host and viral 63 membranes, allowing viral genomes enter host cells 9-12 . 64 65 The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the subunit S1 directly interact with ACE2 , while the other 66 part of the S protein do not. This RBD alone is sufficient for tight binding to the peptidase domain 67 of ACE2. Therefore, RBD is the critical determinant of virus-receptor interaction and thus of viral 68 host range, tropism and infectivity 9,13,14 . 69 70 Meanwhile, S protein participates in antigen recognition expressed on its protein surface, likely to 71 be immunogenic as for carrying both T-cell and B-cell epitopes. The potential antibody binding 72 sites that have been identified indicates RBD has important B-cell epitopes. The main antibody 73 binding site substantially overlaps with RBD, and the antibody binding to this surface is likely to 74 block viral entry into cells 15,16 . 75 76 The amino acid mutations and recombination in the RBD of different host origin coronaviruses are 77 deemed to be associated with the host adaption and across species infection. Recently research 78 indicates that the recombination and a cleavage site insertion in the RBD may increase the virus 79 infectivity and replication capacity 7 . The RBD sequences of different SARS-CoV-2 viruses 80 spreading in the world are conserved. However, mutations in RBD still appeared, which might 81 relate to the progression of the infectivity of this virus. 82 83 To invest whether these mutations in RBD have enhanced or weakened the receptor binding activity 84 and if the viruses is becoming more aggressive and spreading more quickly, we investigated and 85 compared the exact receptor binding dynamics between the SARS-CoV-2 RBDs of all the newly 86 mutated strains and ACE2 of humans as well as their potential hosts such as bats and pangolins.
