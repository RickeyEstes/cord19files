Sera were from children and adults hospitalized over a 4-year period, from 1979 to 1982, at the CHRU of Clermont-Ferrand (France) for different clinical reasons. Of the 446 sera tested, 61 % showed antibodies against OC 43 ; 90 0J0 of adult sera were positive. Coronavirus infections are very common in France. Immunity appears early in life, and infection is frequent in children from 12-36 months of age. KEY-WORDS: Coronavirus, Immunofluorescence; Diagnosis, Seroepidemiology.
