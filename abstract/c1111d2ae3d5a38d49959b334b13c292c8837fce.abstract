A Challenge at country level is to: G catalyse and sustain strong and visible leadership and stewardship by government, health authorities, and professionals, and minimise complacency G promote hand hygiene along new guidelines, blood-safety strategies, injection-safety programmes, safety of clinical procedures, and efforts that ensure access to safe water and sanitation in health care G assist countries to identify and reduce national barriers to implementing these strategies and programmes G invest in development of monitoring tools and support establishment of independent systems to track progress and effect G help develop or strengthen mechanisms within countries to ensure availability of goods and commodities relating to cleaner and safer care, and access to them G identify elements of success and lessons learned from district test implementation, and disseminate them widely G work through partnerships with civil society and patient groups to maximise impact of efforts The pledge is a clear statement by the minister of health of a country interested in addressing health-care-associated infection. This Statement will urge health organisations to: G acknowledge the importance of health-care-associated infection G share with WHO World Alliance for Patient Safety available information on this problem, including surveillance data if appropriate G consider the adoption of WHO strategies and guidelines to tackle health-care-associated infection G develop campaigns at national or subnational levels for improving hand hygiene among health-care providers C Pilot testing WHO is supporting pilot testing of preventive actions in several districts in developed, transitional, and developing countries to measure processes, structures, and outcomes before and after implementation, help monitor progress and assess acceptability, feasibility and impact of the integrated package of actions See http://www.who.int/ patientsafety/en/brochure _final.pdf
