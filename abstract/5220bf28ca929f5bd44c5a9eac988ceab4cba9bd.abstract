BACKGROUND: Pandemics and disasters can result in large numbers of critically ill or injured patients who may overwhelm available resources despite implementing surge-response strategies. If this occurs, critical care triage, which includes both prioritizing patients for care and rationing scarce resources, will be required. Th e suggestions in this chapter are important for all who are involved in large-scale pandemics or disasters with multiple critically ill or injured patients, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, and public health or government offi cials. Th e Triage topic panel reviewed previous task force suggestions and the literature to identify 17 key questions for which specifi c literature searches were then conducted to identify studies upon which evidence-based recommendations could be made. No studies of sufficient quality were identifi ed. Th erefore, the panel developed expert opinion-based suggestions using a modifi ed Delphi process. Suggestions from the previous task force that were not being updated were also included for validation by the expert panel. Th e suggestions from the task force outline the key principles upon which critical care triage should be based as well as a path for the development of the plans, processes, and infrastructure required. Th is article provides 11 suggestions regarding the principles upon which critical care triage should be based and policies to guide critical care triage. CONCLUSIONS: Ethical and effi cient critical care triage is a complex process that requires signifi cant planning and preparation. At present, the prognostic tools required to produce an eff ective decision support system (triage protocol) as well as the infrastructure, processes, legal protections, and training are largely lacking in most jurisdictions. Th erefore, critical care triage should be a last resort aft er mass critical care surge strategies.

In the event of an incident with mass critical care casualties, we suggest all hospitals within a defi ned geographic/administrative region (eg, state), health authority, or health-care coalition should implement a uniform triage process and cooperate when critical care resources become scarce. 2. We suggest critical care only be rationed when resources have, or will shortly be, overwhelmed despite all efforts at augmentation and a regionallevel authority that holds the legal authority and adequate situational awareness has declared an emergency and activated its mass critical care plan. 3. We suggest health-care systems provide oversight for any triage decisions made under their authority via activation of a mass critical care plan to ensure they comply with the prescribed process and include appropriate documentation. e63S journal.publications.chestnet.org overwhelm resources be developed with inclusion and exclusion criteria. 11b. We suggest the inclusion criteria for admission to intensive care. 11c. We suggest patients who will have such a low probability of survival that signifi cant benefi t is unlikely be excluded from ICUs when resources are overwhelmed. 11d. We suggest consideration be given to excluding patient groups that have a life expectancy , 1 year. 11e. We suggest if a physiologic (nondiseasespecifi c) outcome prediction score can be demonstrated to reliably predict mortality in a specified population upon screening for ICU admission, it is reasonable to use this to exclude admission for patients with a predicted mortality rate . 90%. Similarly if a disease-specifi c score can be demonstrated to reliably predict mortality when used in the same manner for patients with the disease, we suggest it is reasonable to use this to exclude admissions for patients with a predicted mortality rate of . 90%. 11f. We suggest each patient's condition be reassessed aft er a suitable time period (eg, 72 h) by the triage offi cer or triage team. If at that point the patient meets the criteria for exclusion from ICU, consideration should be given to withdrawal of therapy. If in the future a score is demonstrated to reliably predict high mortality when the patient is assessed during ICU stay, this should be used in preference to or as a supplement to clinical judgment.
