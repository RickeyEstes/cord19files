Based upon the fact that L-nucleosides have been generally known to be less cytotoxic than D-counterparts, L-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexenyl carbanucleoside derivatives with a fixed north conformation were designed and synthesized by employing a novel synthetic strategy starting from (R)-epichlorohydrin in order to search for new anti-HIV agents with high potency and less cytotoxicity. A tandem alkylation, c-lactonization, a chemoselective reduction of ester in the presence of c-lactone functional group, a RCM reaction, and a Mitsunobu coupling reaction were used as key reactions. D-Counterpart nucleosides were also prepared according to the same synthetic method. Among the synthesized carbanucleosides, D-thymine nucleoside, D-2 and L-thymine nucleoside, L-2 exhibited excellent anti-HIV-1 and -2 activities, in MT-4 cells, which were higher than those of ddI, an anti-AIDS drug. Whereas D-2 exhibited high cytotoxicity in MT-4 cell lines, L-2 did not show any discernible cytotoxicity in all cell lines tested, reflecting that L-2 may be a good candidate for an anti-AIDS drug. L-2 also showed weak anti-HSV-2 activity without cytotoxicity. However, none of the synthesized nucleosides exhibited antiviral activities against RNA viruses including coxsakie, influenza, corona and polio viruses, maybe due to their 2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxy structure. Potent antiviral effects of D-2 and L-2 indicate that nucleosides belonging to a class of D4Ns can be an excellent candidate for anti-DNA virus agents. This research strongly supports L-nucleosides of a class of D4Ns to be a very promising candidate for antiviral agents due to its low cytotoxicity and a good antiviral activity. j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / b m c various enzymes associated with nucleoside metabolism and nucleotide polymerization. 18,19 On the other hand, a number of L-nucleosides such as 3TC, FTC, 20 L-d4FC and L-5-FddC 21 have also been reported to show highly potent anti-HIV activity (Figs. 1 and 2) . L-Nucleosides have been generally known to be less cytotoxic than D-counterparts. D-N-MCd4T, 22 bearing a locked north conformation and a 2 0 ,3 0double bond in a single structure has been synthesized and its anti-HIV activity was compared with that of d4T (Fig. 2) . Although D-N-MCd4T was less potent than d4T, it showed significant antiviral activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2 with less cytotoxicity in varied cell types, and was stable under conditions that would cleave d4T. On the basis of these findings, as a part of our ongoing efforts to search for antiviral agents with better potency, less cytotoxicity and improved stability, it was of interest to synthesize conformationally north-locked and enantiopure D-and L-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexenyl carbanucleoside derivatives involving L-N-MCd4T (L-2), 23 and compare antiviral activity of D-carbanucleosides with that of L-carbanucleosides. D-and L-Bicyclo[3.1.0]hexenyl carbanucleoside derivatives with a natural nucleobase were prepared using (S)-and (R)-epichlorohydrin, respectively, as a starting material and their antiviral activities against HIV-1 and -2, coxsackie B1 and B3 and HSV-1 and -2 were evaluated. A new strategy for the synthesis of L-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexenyl carbanucleoside analogs (L-1-L-5) and its D-counterpart were successfully accomplished by using cyclopropanation via a tandem alkylation, c-lactonization, a chemoselective reduction of ester in
