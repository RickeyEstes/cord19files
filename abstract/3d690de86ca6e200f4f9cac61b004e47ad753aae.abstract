Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-sense RNA viruses that infect numerous mammalian and avian 23 species and are capable of causing severe and lethal disease in humans. CoVs encode several 24 innate immune antagonists that interact with the host innate immune response to facilitate 25 efficient viral replication. CoV non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) encodes 3'-to-5' 26 exoribonuclease activity (ExoN), which performs a proofreading function and is required for 27 high-fidelity replication. Outside of the order Nidovirales, arenaviruses are the only RNA viruses 28 that encode an ExoN, which functions to degrade dsRNA replication intermediates. In this study, 29 we tested the hypothesis that CoV ExoN may also function to antagonize the innate immune 30 response. We demonstrate that viruses lacking ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are sensitive to cellular 31 pretreatment with interferon beta (IFN-β) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ExoN(-) virus 32 replication was attenuated in wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and partially 33 restored in interferon alpha/beta receptor deficient (IFNAR-/-) BMMs. ExoN(-) virus replication 34 did not result in IFN-β gene expression, and in the presence of an IFN-β-mediated antiviral state, 35 ExoN(-) viral RNA levels were not substantially reduced relative to untreated. However, ExoN(-36 ) virus generated from IFN-β pretreated cells had reduced specific infectivity and decreased 37 relative fitness, suggesting that ExoN(-) virus generated during an antiviral state is less viable to 38 establish a subsequent infection. Overall, our data suggest MHV ExoN activity is required for 39 resistance to the innate immune response and antiviral mechanisms affecting the viral RNA 40 sequence and/or an RNA modification act on viruses lacking ExoN activity. 41 42 43 All rights reserved.
