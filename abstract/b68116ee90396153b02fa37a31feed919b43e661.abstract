Numerous microorganisms produce lectins of different kinds that are specific for animal cell surface carbohydrates. 1, 2 In viruses, the lectins occur as membrane constituents, in bacteria they are generally present on the cell surface, often as submicroscopic multisubunit surface appendages known as fimbriae or pili, and occasionally in intracellular soluble form, while in protozoa they are constituents of the cell envelope. Most of these lectins serve to tether the organisms to a substratum (e.g., soil bacteria to clays or marine bacteria to corals) in order to better access nutrients, escape deleterious agents, and withstand cleansing. In animals, they serve for the attachment (or adhesion) of the microorganisms to host tissues or cells, a prerequisite for infection, and are therefore among the virulence factors of the microorganisms. Detailed knowledge of the specificity and combining sites of these lectins is of importance not only for the understanding of a basic mechanism conserved throughout evolution, but also for the development of powerful inhibitors of the lectins for blocking microbial adhesion to tissues. This is the aim of antiadhesion therapy of microbial diseases. 3, 4 Most of the microbial lectins have only been poorly characterized. Their existence and specificity have been inferred primarily from inhibition experiments, in which the effect of different carbohydrates is examined on adhesion of the organisms to animal cells or on the agglutination of erythrocytes or other kinds of cell, such as yeasts. 1,2 Specificity for the carbohydrate of glycolipids or glycoproteins is usually assessed by binding of the bacterial lectins to these glycoconjugates separated on thin layer chromatograms or on blots of gel electrophoresis, respectively. Recently, the application of glycan microarrays for specificity studies of viral and bacterial lectins has been described. 5,6 In a few cases, the specificity and association constants of carbohydrates to the isolated lectins have been measured by physicochemical techniques, for example, by surface plasmon resonance. 64 Binding of carbohydrates to lectins, including those of microbial sources, is generally characterized by a low affinity for monovalent ligands, a drawback balanced by multivalency, which provides high avidity for complex glycans or cell surfaces. In general, millimolar affinity is observed for lectin binding to monosaccharides, although cases of lectins 623 with micromolar affinities are known. 7 When oligosaccharides act as ligands, corresponding to an extended binding site on the lectins, increased affinity up to the micromolar range can be observed. These interactions are typified by a favorable enthalpy term, due to the high number of hydrogen bonds that is offset by an unfavorable entropy contribution, attributed either to solvent rearrangement or loss of ligand conformational flexibility. An increase of several orders of magnitude in the affinity of carbohydrates to lectins can be achieved by suitable chemical derivatization, for example, by attachment to hydrophobic aglycones. Similar increase is obtained by their attachment to polymeric carriers, to form multivalent ligands such as dendrimers (see Chapter 3.36). For a small number of the microbial lectins, detailed information is available on their structure as well as that of their combining sites and their mode of interaction with ligands. It is based primarily on high-resolution X-ray crystallography of the lectins and their complexes with ligands (see Chapters 2.06 and 2.07). Other inputs include binding experiments with different sugars and their derivatives using state-of-the-art techniques, site-directed mutagenesis of the proteins, and, to a limited extent, also NMR experiments and molecular modeling. Such studies have shown that like the lectins themselves, the sites are diverse, even when their specificity is the same (although within a given protein family the sites may be similar). 8 In general, the sites appear to be preformed, since conformational changes occur rarely upon ligand binding. The amino acids that form the combining sites are not necessarily contiguous, and are brought together in space by the folding of the polypeptide chain. Changes in the spatial position of the amino acid residues may occur upon binding of the carbohydrate, bringing them to an orientation which improves stereocomplementarity with the ligand. The fit between the binding site on the protein and the carbohydrate is also affected by the shape of the ligand. Oligosaccharides are flexible molecules with considerable freedom of rotation around the glycosidic bonds connecting the individual monosaccharide constituents. As a result, they may assume different shapes, only one of which may fit the combining sites. The types of bonds involved in the formation of lectin-carbohydrate complexes are in principle not different from those involved in the formation of complexes of proteins with other ligands, such as peptides, oligonucleotides, or various small molecules (see Chapter 3.21). Binding between proteins and carbohydrates is stabilized primarily by a network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions; in rare cases, electrostatic interactions (or ion pairing) and coordination with metal ions also play a role. 9-11 Bonding is sometimes mediated by one or more water molecules. Although in a single protein a limited set of amino acid residues contribute to the interactions with the ligand, in general most of the side chains of the 20 amino acids can participate in ligand binding.
