Collective global action is increasingly recognized as central to achieving the highest attainable standard of health and wellbeing for the world's people. Governance constitutes the constellation of mechanisms a society uses to effect collective action toward common goals. Although individuals bear the major responsibility for maintaining healthy lifestyles and for seeking appropriate preventive and therapeutic care, many factors necessary for health can only be established through collective action on a larger scale. Effective collective action requires coordinated policy and a collaborative approach to implementation. Historically, the purview of sovereign states and intergovernmental organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), global health policy is now being influenced by an ever-increasing number of nonstate and non-intergovernmental actors with a range of mandates, interests, resources, means, and degrees of accountability. Illustrative community needs amenable to organized, collective public-health solutions include the need to provide individuals with access to safe, potable water, hygienic housing and worksites, nutritious and uncontaminated food and drugs, and protection from infectious diseases. In recent decades, the challenges for global health governance have grown to encompass the prevention of interpersonal violence, unintentional injuries, threats to mental and reproductive health, and the prevention of global epidemics of chronic diseases. In health systems, current challenges include addressing the consequences of health-workforce migrations from communities in dire need to meet the growing demand for health workers in wealthier countries. Increases in global trade have extended the public-health mandate to concern about the safety and effectiveness of imported food, pharmaceuticals, and other products.
