Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has developed as a critical tool permitting lung protection in severe respiratory failure. Its use was largely confined to acute respiratory distress syndrome [1]; however, as technology has advanced, it is now used in a range of respiratory diseases, including asthma. In the context of near-fatal asthma exacerbations, ECMO provides a management strategy for difficult-to-ventilate patients who would otherwise be unlikely to survive. Importantly, in asthma, traditional mechanical ventilation strategies can be associated with volutrauma and barotrauma due to the high pressures required in the presence of severe bronchospasm [2] . To date, there is a paucity of data for ECMO use in acute asthma and it is unknown whether specific clinical or inflammatory characteristics are associated with the need for ECMO. We performed a retrospective review of all adult asthmatics requiring mechanical ventilatior and/or ECMO for near-fatal asthma admitted to our single large tertiary hospital between 2011 and 2016. Clinical and demographic data including ventilator parameters, biochemical and immunological indices, and microbiology isolates were recorded. We compared patients requiring ECMO with patients requiring conventional mechanical ventilation only, to identify any factors that were significantly associated with the need for ECMO. All data, including demographic, physiological and laboratory data, utilised in this study were collected as part of routine acute asthma care in our intensive care unit (ICU) and tertiary severe asthma centre. No additional ethical approval was required. 76 patients (46% female, mean±SD age 39±16 years) with a primary diagnosis of acute asthma associated with the clinical features of a near-fatal exacerbation requiring ECMO or mechanical ventilation were included in this analysis. 22 patients (29%) required ECMO and 54 (71%) required conventional mechanical ventilation only. Compared to patients requiring mechanical ventilation, those requiring ECMO were more likely to be female (72% versus 35%, p=0.003) and younger (mean age 30±14 versus 43±15 years, p=0.002). Prior to intervention, patients requiring ECMO had a higher total white cell count (15.5±6.4 versus 12.2±4.4×10 9 L −1 , p=0.013), were more acidotic (mean pH 7.12±0.17 versus 7.27±0.09, p<0.001) and hypercapnic (mean carbon dioxide tension 12.8±4.1 versus 7.26±2.1 kPa, p<0.001). No statistically significant differences in oxygenation (oxygen tension), C-reactive protein (CRP), total serum immunoglobulin E or blood eosinophil counts at the time of admission to the ICU were observed between groups. Patients requiring ECMO were more likely to have a positive fungal isolate from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid than those requiring mechanical ventilation (36% versus 10%, p=0.026). Rhinovirus was also identified in a greater proportion of respiratory isolates in the ECMO cohort compared to mechanical ventilation (27.2% versus 6.9%, p=0.048) with a strong trend towards a greater likelihood of any respiratory virus isolation in the ECMO group (54.5% versus 27.6%, p=0.053). There was no difference in the @ERSpublications Patients with near-fatal asthma requiring ECMO are more likely to be younger and female and are also likely to have positive viral and fungal isolates on bronchoalveolar lavage when compared to those receiving conventional mechanical ventilation http://bit.ly/2S38SaC Cite this article as: Patel S, Shah NM, Malhotra AM, et al.
