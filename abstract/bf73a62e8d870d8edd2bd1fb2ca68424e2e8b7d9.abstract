We previously described two donors in whom the extracellular domain of LAIR1, a collagenbinding inhibitory receptor encoded on chromosome 191, was inserted between the V and the DJ segments of an antibody. This insertion generated, through somatic mutations, broadly reactive antibodies against RIFINs, a type of variant antigen expressed on the surface of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IEs)2. To investigate how frequently such antibodies are produced in response to malaria infection, we screened plasma from two large cohorts of Users may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use:
