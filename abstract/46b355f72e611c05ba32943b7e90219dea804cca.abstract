Innate immunity is a component of bodily defense systems which, unlike its counterpart adaptive immunity, mounts a rapid and generic response against foreign infectious agents or endogenous harm (e.g., malignant cells). For this purpose, the innate immunity employs several elements that can be divided into innate immune proteins and innate immune cells [12] . Innate immune proteins-such as complement proteins, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), pentraxins, collectins, and defensins-are humoral proteins that possess antimicrobial properties or aid in sensing and clearance of pathogens [12] . Innate immune cells are responsible for the recognition of pathogens, initiation of immune response (often manifested as inflammation), elimination of pathogens or unhealthy cells, and activation of the adaptive immune system [12] . The cells which perform these tasks are of hematopoietic lineage like macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, natural killer cells, and other leukocytes. In part, the epithelial cells located in skin and respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts also participate in the innate immune responses. The most prominent feature of pathogen recognition by the innate immune system is the socalled pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These genetically predetermined receptors with broad specificity (as compared to the diverse and highly specific receptors of the adaptive immunity) are able to distinguish between the self and nonself by specifically detecting either the microbial structures or common biological consequences of infection. The microbial structures, usually termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), incorporate highly conserved molecules that are essential for pathogen's viability or virulence, but are not typical of host organism. Examples of PAMPs are bacterial lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans, endotoxins, and viral nucleic acid variants such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or unmethylated CpG motifs in DNA [13À15]. The common biological consequences of infection, on the other hand, refer to the release of molecules known as damage-associated patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs are released upon infliction of cell damage during infection or sterile conditions [16] . In addition, PRRs can also detect abnormalities such as the presence of host DNA or cleaved RNA in cytoplasm. PRRs are interspersed across cell membrane, endosomes, and cytoplasm of the innate immune cells, especially macrophages and dendritic cells. They can be classified into Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [13], C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) [17], nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)like receptors (NLRs) [18] , cytosolic DNA sensors [19] and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) [20] . Of them, the cytoplasmic DNA sensors and RLRs along with their corresponding signaling pathways are of particular interest for this chapter because of their relation to DEAD/DEAH-box helicases. The presence of DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells is commonly associated with the presence of viral, bacterial, or protozoan DNA, or the release of host DNA to cytosol following the cell damage [21] . Cytosolic DNA sensors that propagate response against such events involve a number of proteins specialized in detection of different DNA variants or secondary messengers such as cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) [22] . The examples of CDNs are cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), and cyclic GMPÀAMP (cGAMP). c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP are two common bacterial messengers, whereas cGAMP is produced in mammalian cells by cyclic cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) upon detection of cytosolic DNA [23]. The cytosolic DNA sensors include cGAS, Z-form DNA-sensing DAI (DNA-dependent activator of IRF protein) [24], B-form DNA-and CDNsensing DDX41 (discussed below), as well as dsDNA-sensing IFI16 [25] and AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) [26]. RIG-I-like receptors are the main group of cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors [20]. Although they also belong to the DEAD/H-box family of helicases, RLRs have been extensively studied and thus CHAPTER 9 DIVERSE ROLES OF DEAD/DEAH-BOX HELICASES won't be the main focus of this chapter, but will be discussed due to their central role in RNA sensing and interaction with other DEAD/DEAH-box helicases. This group consists of three members, namely retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) [20] . Among them, RIG-I and MDA5 are specialized for sensing different types of viral RNA. These two sensors contain two structural motifs known as caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), which facilitate interactions with downstream proteins involved in the innate immune signaling. By contrast, LGP2 does not contain the CARD domains and thus cannot promote downstream signaling. Instead, it serves as a positive regulator of MDA5 signaling [27] . Upon detection of nucleic acids, the RLRs and cytosolic DNA sensors activate their respective downstream signaling cascades. A number of cytosolic DNA sensors (including cGAS, DDX41, DAI and IFI16) transduce the signal to the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) located on the membrane of endoplasmatic reticulum [28] . This leads to the generation of functional STING dimers, which mediate phosphorylation of the TBK1/IKKε (tank binding kinase 1/ inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit epsilon) kinase complex and the IKK (inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase) [29À31]. TBK1/IKKε and IKK respectively activate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-κB, which translocate to nucleus in order to instigate the transcription of innate immune response genes. RLRs transduce the signal to the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) through interaction of the CARD domains present in both proteins [32] . The signal causes the formation of massive MAVS aggregates on the mitochondrial membrane, which interact and activate tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factors (TRAFs) such as TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6 [33À35]. These E3 ligases initiate synthesis of ubiquitin chains that recruit the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) and TBK1/IKKε to the MAVS aggregate. Afterwards, TRAFs activate TBK1/IKKε, whereas NEMO phosphorylates IKK, which further enhances the activation of TBK1/ IKKε [35] . Similarly to the STING pathway, TBK1/IKKε and IKK then activate IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB to stimulate the transcription of response genes. Signaling via STING and MAVS culminates in the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines [36] . The former primarily include numerous subtypes of IFN-α and a single IFN-β, whereas the latter include TNF-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and IL-18. The secreted type I IFNs trigger the expression of a myriad of response genes known as IFN-inducible genes through the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in the receptor cells [36] . Collectively, all these signaling events broadly activate immune cells, induce inflammation and raise the defenses of host cells. However, what are the functions of DEAD/DEAH-box helicases in STING and MAVS signaling pathways? Apart from the abovementioned RLRs and DDX41, other DEAD/DEAHbox helicases have been reported to act as sensors of cytosolic DNA/RNA, adapter molecules, or regulators of signaling and gene expression (Table 9 .1). In addition, DEAD/DEAH-box helicases are also hijacked and exploited by viruses to circumvent detection and aid in viral replication. To demonstrate the known range of their activities in innate immunity (especially in STING and MAVS pathways), this chapter will introduce exemplar DEAD/DEAH-box helicases and their interactions with viruses or other pathogens. We also give an outline of diseases in which DEAD/DEAH-box helicases are, or may be involved in the context of immunity. 157 ROLES OF DEAD/DEAH-BOX HELICASES ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
