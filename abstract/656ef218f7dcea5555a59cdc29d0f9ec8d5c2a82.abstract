Coronaviruses encode a mix of highly conserved and novel genes as well as genetic elements 2 necessary for infection and pathogenesis, raising the possibility for common targets for 3 attenuation and therapeutic design. In this study, we focus on the highly conserved non-4 structural protein (NSP) 16, a viral 2'O methyl-transferase (MTase) that encodes critical 5 functions in immune modulation and infection. Using reverse genetics, we disrupted a key motif 6 in the conserved KDKE motif of MERS NSP16 (D130A) and evaluated the effect on viral 7 infection and pathogenesis. While the absence of 2'O MTase activity had only marginal impact 8 on propagation and replication in Vero cells, the MERS dNSP16 mutant demonstrated 9 significant attenuation relative to control both in primary human airway cultures and in vivo. 10 Further examination indicated the MERS dNSP16 mutant had a type I IFN based attenuation 11 and was partially restored in the absence of IFIT molecules. Importantly, the robust attenuation 12 permitted use of MERS dNSP16 as a live attenuated vaccine platform protecting from challenge 13 with a mouse adapted MERS-CoV strain. These studies demonstrate the importance of the 14 conserved 2'O MTase activity for CoV pathogenesis and highlight NSP16 as a conserved 15 universal target for rapid live attenuated vaccine design in an expanding CoV outbreak setting. 16 All rights reserved.

Significance 1 Coronavirus emergence in both human and livestock represents a significant threat to global 2 public health, as evidenced by the sudden emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, PEDV and 3 swine delta coronavirus in the 21 st century. These studies describe an approach that effectively 4 targets the highly conserved 2'O methyl-transferase activity of coronaviruses for attenuation. 5 With clear understanding of the IFN/IFIT based mechanism, NSP16 mutants provide a suitable 6 target for a live attenuated vaccine platform as well as therapeutic development for both current 7 and future emergent CoV strains. Importantly, other approaches targeting other conserved pan-8 coronavirus functions have not yet proven effective against MERS-CoV, illustrating the broad 9 applicability of targeting viral 2'O MTase function across coronaviruses.
