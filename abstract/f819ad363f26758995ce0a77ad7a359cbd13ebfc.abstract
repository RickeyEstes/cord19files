Members of the families Procyonidae and Viveridae are small-and medium-sized, mainly nocturnal members of the order Carnivora. Although the two groups are taxonomically distant, they share susceptibilities to several important infectious diseases and are handled similarly by veterinarians. Only a few procyonid and viverid species are commonly exhibited by zoos or kept as pets.
