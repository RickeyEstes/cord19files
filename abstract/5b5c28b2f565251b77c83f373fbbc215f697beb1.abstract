Certain future scenarios of technological change are dystopian in their predictions. Fewer are optimistic. Taking a pragmatic stance, this paper seeks to identify certain key threats associated with the proliferation of dangerous technologies, giving voice to those in the literature on different sides of the debate. Novel literature is considered that suggests that innovations in the discovery, or research process itself, may hold the key to developing certain collaborative capabilities that can amplify collective intelligence. These capabilities are discussed together with their potential to meet the challenges associated with the proliferation of dangerous technologies. Testable propositions are derived from literature, and four technological scenarios are developed for analysis. Certain key challenges are identified and discussed in relation to each of the technological scenarios. In doing so, what are hopefully useful insights are derived for how changes can be made in the present to help avoid meeting the fates described by certain of these scenarios. T threats. These threats are used to guide and anchor discussions and arguments throughout different sections of the paper. This paper therefore seeks to make a contribution to the future studies literature, in the following ways. First, it seeks to relate the threat of technological development to Sardar's (2010) four laws of future studies. Whereas most approaches to such problems suffer from the constraints associated with disciplinary lenses, this work seeks to understand these problems through a systematic approach that does not privilege any specific disciplinary approach over another. Future studies "is not just multi-and trans-disciplinary, it is unashamedly un-disciplinary: that is, it consciously rejects the status and state of a discipline while being a fully fledged systematic mode of critical enquiry" (Sardar, 2010:183). This is Sardar's first law, and it is particularly important in light of certain of the arguments made here, which draw on Nielsen's (2012) theory of networked science, and its predictions that human collaboration enabled by novel technologies can result in radical innovations in the scientific discovery process itself. Nielsen argues that it is changes in the scientific discovery process itself that account for the great scientific leaps, or scientific advances through history. It is argued here that Nielsen's theory offers useful insights into how radical innovations in the research, or R&D process itself can improve the capacity of humans to manage technological advancement, or other 'wicked problems' associated with technological proliferation, considered here in terms of six primary technological threats facing humankind. Second, although seemingly alarmist, the potential threats of technological proliferation require consideration for those seeking to develop useful future scenarios for how technology may impact society going forward. Technological advancement has seemingly considerable potential for technological development and proliferation to contribute to the betterment of society through elevating the health and wellbeing of populations (and through offering outright solutions to catastrophic problems). However, it also has the potential for catastrophic consequences of technological development itself and the proliferation of harmful outcomes. Effective theory needs to be developed that can help stakeholders capture benefits while mitigating risk. This paper therefore poses an important question, namely what are the key theoretical dimensions of this problem? This problem is defined as the need to manage the seemingly unlimited opportunities of technological change while at the same time also managing the proliferation of dangerous technological applications. In light of this problem, and the lack of sufficient knowledge of how to address the tensions between potential benefits and risk (and the failure of humankind to solve many of its present contemporary problems), this paper seeks to present an argument that two aspects of technological change account for most of the variance associated with this problem. It is also argued that a focus on the management of these two aspects, or dimensions, can provide important guidelines for the development of a discovery system that is relatively more robust to threats posed by both innovation failure as well as from dangerous technology proliferation. These two dimensions relate to the urgent need (i) to manage the openness of the discovery system itself, and (ii) to manage the power relationships associated with a rapidly developing system of technological innovation. Sardar's (2010:183) second law states that future studies are characterized by Mutually Assured Diversity (MAD), whereby MAD "is the proposition that full preservation of our humanity requires that [human diversity] is assured, that it not only survives but thrives in any desired future, and that future generations mutually recognise and appreciate each others' diversity." It is argued here that key to the survival of humans in the face of technological proliferation, following Nielsen's (2012) theory, is the need for openness in the discovery process itself, whereby openness is a necessary condition for the knowledge creation necessary for the co-evolution of our capabilities to manage the accelerating rate of emergent technologies. Indeed, according to Tegmark (2017:89), the challenges of technological advancement "transcend all traditional boundaries-both between specialties and between nations." Sardar's (2010:183) third law relates to how futures studies are sceptical, and "the reality of things is inaccessible to the human mind and certitude is impossible to attain." Given the uncertainties associated with technological proliferation, in developing theoretical insights it is necessary to take recourse to theory that predicts how diversity in human action has seemingly been checked by power throughout human history (see Foucault, 1982) . Thus, to develop a theoretical frame that is sceptical of truth claims, the initial structure developed here focuses first on a key defining issue of the knowledge age, namely the radical changes in the discovery process on account of the democratisation of knowledge (Callaghan, 2016) . These changes seem to be fundamentally enabled by the increasing openness of the knowledge creation process itself. Second, the analysis focuses on the way that power relationships have seemed to pose a fundamental threat to the diversity of views in human history (Foucault, 1982) . In this way, analysis is related to primary technological threats. Third, in light of Sardar's (2010:184) fourth law, that future studies are futureless, and the influence of futures studies is on thought and scientific behaviour in the present, this paper seeks to "change peoples' perceptions, make them aware of dangers and opportunities ahead" and to "galvanise them into collective social action" to provoke discussion and consideration of important and uncomfortable scenarios that will unfold on account of our actions in the present. Having introduced the paper, and having provided a brief overview of its key arguments, literature is now reviewed, and certain key technology threats are identified. After this, interrelationships between these threats are discussed. A theoretical framework is then developed, and four modes of discovery are derived from the use of two propositions as heuristics. Certain issues drawn from the literature are then discussed in relation to each of these modes of discovery. The paper concludes with a discussion of these modes. The industrial and digital (information) revolution has had far-reaching impacts on "practically all aspects of our society, life, firms and employment" (Makridakis, 2017:46). As stressed previously, these effects are expected to intensify over time. For Makridakis (2017:50), those predicting different influences of technology on society can be differentiated on the basis of their optimism or pessimism:
