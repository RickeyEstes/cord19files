A 71-year-old female patient with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 had previously discontinued interferon (IFN)-a plus ribavirin therapy, pegylated IFN-a (pegIFNa) monotherapy, and natural IFN-a monotherapy because of arrhythmia, interstitial pneumonia, and severe neurovegetative symptoms. She subsequently completed 72 weeks of natural IFN-b plus ribavirin therapy without remarkable adverse effects and achieved a sustained viral response, suggesting differences in the pharmacological properties and biological effects of IFN-a and IFN-b. Thus, natural IFN-b plus ribavirin therapy may be a treatment option for patients with poor tolerance to IFN-a or pegIFNa treatments.
