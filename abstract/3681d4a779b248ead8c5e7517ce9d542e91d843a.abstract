Yellow head virus (YHV) is a pathogen of the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and, with gillassociated virus (GAV), is one of two known invertebrate nidoviruses. We describe sequences of the large replicase gene (ORF1a) and 5 -and 3 -terminal UTRs, completing the 26,662 nt sequence of the YHV genome. ORF1a (12,219 nt) encodes a ∼462,662 Da polypeptide containing a putative 3C-like protease and a putative papain-like protease with the canonical C/H catalytic dyad and ␣ + ␤ fold. The read-through pp1ab polyprotein contains putative uridylate-specific endoribonuclease and ribose-2 -O-methyl transferase domains, and an exonuclease domain incorporating unusual dual Zn 2+ -binding fingers. Upstream of ORF1a, the 71 nt 5 -UTR shares 82.4% identity with the 68 nt 5 -UTR of GAV. The 677 nt 3 -terminal region contains a single 60 nt ORF, commencing 298 nt downstream of ORF3, that is identical to N-terminal coding region of the 249 nt GAV ORF4. Northern blots using RNA from YHV-infected shrimp and probes directed at ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2 and ORF3 identified a nested set of 3 -coterminal RNAs comprising the full-length genomic RNA and two sub-genomic (sg) mRNAs. Intergenic sequences upstream of ORF2 and ORF3 share high identity with GAV, particularly in the conserved domains predicted to mediate sgmRNA transcription. Crown
