Veterinary Microbiology, 26 ( 1991 ) 25-40 25 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam ABSTRACT Rimmelzwaan, G.F., Groen, J., Egberink, H., Borst, G.H.A., UytdeHaag, F.G.C.M. and Osterhaus, A.D.M.E., 1991. The use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay systems for serology and antigen detection in parvovirus coronavirus and rotavirus infections in dogs in The Netherlands. Vet. Microbiol., 26: 25-40. Complex trapping blocking (CTB) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and indirect ELISAs for the detection of antibodies to canine parvovirus (CPV), canine coronavirus (CCV) and rotavirus in sera of dogs were established. Double antibody sandwich ELISAs for the detection of CPV-, CCV-and rotavirus antigens in fecal samples were also developed. Both the serological and antigen-detection ELISAs were used to screen samples from dogs in The Netherlands, with or without a history of acute diarrhea. It was shown that the results of the respective serological ELISAs correlated well and that CPV was the major cause of virus-induced acute diarrhea in dogs in The Netherlands. 0378-1135/91/$03.50
