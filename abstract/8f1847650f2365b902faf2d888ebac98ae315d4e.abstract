Fig. 1. Radiological characteristics of a RESLES. A, B, C: MRI showed isolated central lesion in the SCC with restricted DWI and reduced ADC value. D: T1-weighted isointensity on SCC. E: Subtle T2-weighted/FLAIR hyperintensity MRI lesion on the SCC. F: Second MRI (follow-up imaging 10 days later) showed the lesion on SCC nearly disappeared in DWI and ADC.
