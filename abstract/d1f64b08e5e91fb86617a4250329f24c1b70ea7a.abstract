The parvoviruses are a large family of physically similar viruses infecting animals as diverse as man and moth (1,2). Those which naturally infect vertebrates are divided into two subgroups, the adeno-associated viruses (AAV) and the autonomous parvoviruses. Members of the AAV subgroup, now also known as the Dependoviruses, are totally dependent upon either adenovirus or herpesvirus coinfection for their own replication. At present there is no published evidence of a member of this subgroup naturally infecting rodents. There is no a priori reason, however for believing that such defective agents do not exist, and investigators studying rodent adenovirus or herpesvirus infections Â±n_ vivo or in cell culture should be aware of the potential problems that such contaminants would present.
