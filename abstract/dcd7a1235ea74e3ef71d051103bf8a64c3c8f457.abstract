12 Background 13 After the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) starting in late 2019, a number 14 of researchers have reported the predicted the virus transmission dynamics. However, 15 under the strict control policy the novel coronavirus does not spread naturally outside 16 Hubei Province, and none of the prediction closes to the real situation. 17 We used the traditional SEIR model, fully estimated the effect of control measures, to 19 predict the virus transmission in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, and 20 Beijing. We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around 21 March 6±10 in Wuhan and March 20±16 in Beijing, respectively. The infectious 22 population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the 23 peak of this transmission wave. The number of confirmed cases in cities inside Hubei 24 Province grow exponentially, whereas those in cities outside the province increase 25 linearly. 26 The unprecedented province lockdown substantially suspends the national and global 28 outbreak of 2019-nCoV. 29
