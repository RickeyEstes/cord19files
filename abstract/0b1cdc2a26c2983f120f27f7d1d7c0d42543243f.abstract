This article reviews the virology, immunology and epidemiology of the most common viral causes of acute gastroenteritis (rotaviruses, human caliciviruses, astroviruses and enteric adenoviruses). The clinical symptoms span from mild diarrhoea to life-threatening dehydration, and rotavirus disease is a major cause of childhood mortality, mainly in developing countries. The diagnosis, treatment and preventive measures are reviewed. Uncommon viral causes of acute gastroenteritis and viruses causing gastroenteritis in immunodeficient patients are mentioned. The clinically most important development in this field over the past 3 years has been the wide application of the new live attenuated rotavirus vaccines in universal mass vaccination programmes in many countries.
