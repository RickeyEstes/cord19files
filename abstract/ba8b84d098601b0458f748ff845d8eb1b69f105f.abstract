In the United States, hospitals build new emergency departments (EDs) every 15 to 20 years. Renovations of existing EDs occur every 5 to 10 years. The main concerns of ED designers are providing efficient spaces for routine care, handling peak volumes, and anticipating future needs. Well-designed EDs accommodate daily, weekly, and seasonal tidal peaks and valleys in patient flow. The variety of high-and lowacuity illnesses and injuries requires EDs to prioritize care into critical, emergent, and urgent treatment. EDs meet community needs for specialized care by providing areas for unique care needs with pediatric, cardiac, trauma, geriatric, or stroke centers. Often only as a last thought do EDs include some design features for disaster and mass-casualty response. 1,2 In the wake of terror-related events, such as the Boston Marathon Bombing and the New York City World Trade Center disaster on September 11, 2001, and natural disasters, such as hurricanes Sandy and Katrina, more EDs are being designed or renovated to meet anticipated disaster needs. These designs and renovations include enhanced security, decontamination, and isolation, and addition of other specialized treatment areas, as well as expanding capacity to treat multiple victims within, or in proximity to, EDs. When planning a new ED or a renovation, the following question should be added to the usual list of design questions: "How can the new ED better respond to disaster events?" ED designs should be planned for normal operations, as well as potential disaster events that could create increased demand and unique needs. One approach to better ED design for disaster is to organize a workshop early in the design process to address emergency preparedness, bringing together hospital administration, ED staff, other key employees, and security and community agencies to complete a risk assessment analysis. Better design can emerge from identifying potential disaster scenarios (e.g., hurricane, pandemic epidemic, or direct attack on the ED), rating their probability of occurrence (e.g., very likely, high, low, or very unlikely), and then listing the potential facility implications of each scenario. 3
