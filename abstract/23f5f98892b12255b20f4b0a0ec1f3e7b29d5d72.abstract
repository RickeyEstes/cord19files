Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) shares some homology with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) but is not inhibited by ACE inhibitors. The main role of ACE2 is the degradation of Ang II resulting in the formation of angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) which opposes the actions of Ang II. Increased Ang II levels are thought to upregulate ACE2 activity, and in ACE2 deficient mice Ang II levels are approximately double that of wild-type mice, whilst Ang 1-7 levels are almost undetectable. Thus, ACE2 plays a crucial role in the RAS because it opposes the actions of Ang II. Consequently, it has a beneficial role in many diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease where its expression is decreased. Not surprisingly, current therapeutic strategies for ACE2 involve augmenting its expression using ACE2 adenoviruses, recombinant ACE2 or compounds in these diseases thereby affording some organ protection. ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane glycoprotein [8] that is expressed and active in most tissues. The highest expression of ACE2 is observed in the kidney, the endothelium, the lungs, and in the heart [2, 8] . The extracellular domain of ACE2 enzyme contains a single catalytic metallopeptidase unit that shares 42% sequence identity and 61% sequence similarity with the catalytic domain of ACE [2]. However,
