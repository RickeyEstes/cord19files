Hundreds of proteins, having several different functions, circulate in the plasma that are, with the exception of immunoglobulins, largely synthesized in the liver. Plasma proteins in the complex are responsible for the colloidal osmotic effect necessary to maintain blood volume. Other important functions of plasma proteins are the buffer function of the blood pH (15%-20% of the total buffering capacity), transport of hormones, transport of drugs, and blood clotting. Different types of proteins are indispensable for the inflammatory reaction, the immune reaction, and for the process of healing and tissue repair. So, it is easily understood that the measurement of plasma proteins and the determination of their alterations may constitute an important method for assessing the health condition of a patient. Human medicine, such as the dog and cat's, has taken advantage for decades of this valuable diagnostic tool. With exotic species, progress in the interpretation of the alteration of plasma proteins has been more discontinuous and irregular. Despite this, the usefulness of this test is indisputable. This article analyzes the different applications of plasma protein electrophoresis in small mammals, birds, and reptiles. Traditionally in the medicine of dogs and cats, the measurement of protein is performed on the serum, the fluid that is obtained by centrifugation of a blood sample KEYWORDS Electrophoresis Exotic pets Protein With exotic species, progress in the interpretation of the alteration of plasma proteins has been discontinuous and irregular. In several exotic species, especially those of small size, the need to work with small volumes of blood requires the clinician to collect the blood with an anticoagulant. In clinical practice, the normal plasma protein concentration is measured very simply by a refractometer.
