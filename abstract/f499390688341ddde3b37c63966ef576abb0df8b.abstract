Outline a framework for discussing the different types of heterogeneity. Found simple expressions for each of the four different types of heterogeneity and heterogeneity in intrinsic mixing. Showed heterogeneity in finite populations is more complicated than previously thought. Showed that heterogeneity in a finite population makes control easier than predicted by R 0 and the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number.
