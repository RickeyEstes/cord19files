Flavonoids are dietary components and the most ubiquitous phenolic compounds found in nature, showing a range of pharmacological activities including antiviral action. This study describes the antiviral screening of 60 different flavones and flavonols against human rotavirus (Wa-1 strain) as well as their cytotoxicity in MA104 cells. Cytotoxicity was investigated by cell morphology assessment and antirotavirus activity by cytopathic effect inhibition. Results were expressed as CC 50 and IC 50 , respectively, in order to calculate the selectivity index (SI = CC 50 / IC 50 ) of each compound. Structure-activity relationships (SAR) were proposed based on antirotavirus activity.
