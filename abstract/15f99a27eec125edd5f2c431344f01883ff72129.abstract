The past decade and a half has been characterized by numerous emerging infectious diseases. With each new threat, there has been a call for rapid vaccine development. Pathogens such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the Zika virus represent either new viral entities or viruses emergent in new geographic locales and characterized by novel complications. Both serve as paradigms for the global spread that can accompany new pathogens. In this paper, we review the epidemiology and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and Zika virus with respect to vaccine development. The challenges in vaccine development and the approach to clinical trial design to test vaccine candidates for disease entities with a changing epidemiology are discussed. In 2012, cases of a progressive pulmonary infection related to individuals who reside in or traveled to the Arabian Peninsula were determined as caused by a novel Group C, b-coronavirus MERS-CoV. 1,2 In contrast to the majority of human pathogenic coronaviruses that cause self-limited upper-respiratory illness, the mortality rate of early MERS-CoV cases was approximately 60%, 3 and has remained greater than 35% -approximating that seen during the West African Ebola virus outbreak. In contrast, the mortality rate during Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic was 10%. Following an incubation period of about 1 week, MERS-CoV causes a rapidly progressive lower respiratory infection with a prodromal illness characterized by fever, cough, and mild shortness of breath. Clinical deterioration is typical leading to the need for intensive care and ventilator support
