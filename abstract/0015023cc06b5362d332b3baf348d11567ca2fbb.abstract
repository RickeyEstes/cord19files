Abstract 27 The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses comprise a single large open reading 28 frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 29 has an unusually large 5′ UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the 30 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting 31 replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5′ terminal 360 nucleotide 32 stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of 33 two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs 34 by selective 2′ hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and 35 determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. 36 SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK 37 structures for their function. Deletion experiments showed that although PKs are not essential 38 for replication, they provide genomes with a competitive advantage. However, although 39 replicons and full-length genomes lacking all PKs were replication competent, no infectious 40 virus was rescued from genomes containing less than one PK copy. This is consistent with our 41 earlier report describing the presence of putative packaging signals in the PK region. 42 43 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
