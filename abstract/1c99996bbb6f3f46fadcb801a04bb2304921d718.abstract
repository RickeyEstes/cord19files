The relationship between pregnancy outcome and maternal colonization with a wide variety of bacterial, fungal, protozoan, and viral organisms has been studied for many years [1, 2] . The more classic sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes, trichomonas and Chlamydia, are almost always transmitted between adults as a result of sexual contact. The majority of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in women of reproductive age are also transmitted sexually; however, there are other maternal infections that are not easily classifiable. Group B streptococcus, hepatitis B virus, cytomegalovirus, and the organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis, such as the mycoplasmas, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides, and Mobiluncus species, are all found more commonly in sexually active women than non-sexually active women, but their mode of transmission is often not apparent. Other maternal infections that are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including malaria, parvovirus, rubella, and listeria, are not generally transmitted sexually. In this article, the authors define a number of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and then explore the evidence that various types of maternal infections are responsible for these outcomes, which include stillbirth and neonatal death; congenital anomalies; short-term neonatal morbidity such as intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and necrotizing entrocolitis (NEC); long-term morbidity, including cerebral palsy and mental 0095-5108/05/$ -see front matter D
