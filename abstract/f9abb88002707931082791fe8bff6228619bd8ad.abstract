With the dissemination of the use of sensitive molecular methods for viral detection, the opportunities to evaluate the role of respiratory viruses in acute and chronic respiratory illness has expanded in the past decade. Acute wheezing illnesses are common, especially in young children, and viral agents have been shown to be found in 60% to 100% of these episodes using these sensitive detection methods. 1-3 Multiple Disclosure: The authors have no conflicts to report. KEYWORDS Human metapneumovirus Bocavirus Influenza virus Wheezing Asthma Respiratory viruses other than rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus can be associated with acute wheezing illness. Contribution to recurrent/wheezing is not well studied. Children with human metapneumovirus lower respiratory tract infection may have increased risk of subsequent recurrent wheezing over the several years after initial infection.
