To assess the nurses' hand hygiene (HH) knowledge, perception, attitude, and self-reported performance in small-and medium-sized hospitals after Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. The structured questionnaire was adapted from the World Health Organization's survey. Data were collected between June 26 and July 14, 2017. Results: Nurses showed scores on knowledge (17.6±2.5), perception (69.3±0.8), self-reported HH performance of non-self (86.0± 11.0), self-reported performance of self (88.2±11.0), and attitude (50.5±5.5). HH performance rate of non-self was Y1 =36.678+ 0.555X1 (HH performance rate of self) (adjusted R 2 =0.280, p<0.001). The regression model for performance was Y4=18.302+0.247X41 (peception)+0.232X42 (attitude)+0.875X42 (role model); coefficients were significant statistically except attitude, and this model significant statistically (adjusted R 2 =0.191, p<0.001). Conclusions: Advanced HH education program would be developed and operated continuously. Perception, attitude, role model was found to be a significant predictors of HH performance of self. So these findings could be used in future HH promotion strategies for nurses.
