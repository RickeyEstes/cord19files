Excess GH production before epiphyseal closure results in gigantism. Aetiopathogenesis GH hypersecretion is usually caused by an eosinophilic adenoma of the anterior pituitary. Other uncommon causes include pancreatic islet cell tumours and some lung endocrine tumours that produce GH stimulating factors. Clinical presentation ■ Excess tissue growth (Fig. 3.1 ): • supraorbital ridge (prominent) • nose (broadened) • skin (thickening) • macroglossia • mandible (spaced teeth, prognathism) • hands and feet (large) ■ Systemic complications due to organ enlargement: • diabetes • hypertension • cardiomyopathy ■ Local effects of pituitary tumour (headache, visual defects). Diagnosis Diagnosis is confirmed by clinical, laboratory and radiographic findings: ■ plasma GH -raised ■ oral glucose tolerance test -fails to suppress GH ■ serum insulin-like growth factor 1 -raised ■ CT and MRI.
