As the initial step in carbohydrate catabolism in cells, the substrate-specific 19 transporters via active transport and facilitated diffusion play a decisive role in passage of 20 sugars through the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. The SecY complex (SecYEG) 21 in bacteria forms a membrane channel responsible for protein translocation.
