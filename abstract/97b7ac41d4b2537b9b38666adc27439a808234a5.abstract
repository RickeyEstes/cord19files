Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is frequently found in cattle worldwide. The etiology of BRDC is complicated by infections with multiple pathogens, making identification of the causal pathogen difficult. Here, we developed a detection system by applying TaqMan real-time PCR (Dembo respiratory-PCR) to screen a broad range of microbes associated with BRDC in a single run. We selected 16 bovine respiratory pathogens (bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, influenza D virus, bovine rhinitis A virus, bovine rhinitis B virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine adenovirus 3, bovine adenovirus 7, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, Trueperella pyogenes, Mycoplasma bovis and Ureaplasma diversum) as detection targets and designed novel specific primer-probe sets for nine of them. The assay performance was assessed using standard curves from synthesized DNA. In addition, the sensitivity of the assay was evaluated by spiking solutions extracted from nasal swabs that were negative by Dembo respiratory-PCR for nucleic acids of pathogens or synthesized DNA. All primer-probe sets showed high sensitivity. In this study, a total of 40 nasal swab samples from cattle on six farms were tested by Dembo respiratory-PCR. Dembo respiratory-PCR can be applied as a screening system with wide detection targets. Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is one of the most prevalent cattle diseases, causing large economic losses in the cattle industry worldwide. For example, BRDC is estimated to account for 70-80% of all feedlot cattle morbidity and 40-50% of all cattle mortality, resulting in a loss of greater than US $500 million per year in the United States [16, 22] . In Japan, number of illness in the statistics mutual aid for livestock owners in 2014 reported by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries indicate that respiratory diseases accounted for 23% of illness in cattle (http://www.maff.go.jp/j/tokei/kouhyou/katiku_kyosai/) (in Japanese). Despite considerable research and attempts to manage hygiene to prevent BRDC, these measures have had a limited effect on reducing the impacts of this disease [29] . One of the difficulties in investigation and prevention of BRDC is its multi-factorial etiology, based on host interactions with multiple pathogens, such as virus and bacteria, including mycoplasma. The primary viral infection sometimes results in clinical symptoms, and it was exacerbated by secondary infections with bacterial pathogens [10] . Stressors, such as transportation, and host factors, such as nutritional status, raise the risk and severity of BRDC [17, 28] . Viruses, which are commonly associated with
