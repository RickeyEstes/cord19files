KEYWORDS Respiratory viruses Laboratory diagnosis Molecular methods Polymerase chain reaction Molecular tests for the detection of respiratory viruses are more sensitive and can detect more viruses than the traditional methods of culture and antigen detection. There are now several molecular assays available, cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, which differ with respect to the viruses detected, instrumentation, throughput, hands-on time, the need for separate nucleic acid extraction, and sensitivity for certain groups of viruses. Issues associated with molecular tests for respiratory viruses include: possible falsenegative results due to sequence variants; the inability of many assays to discriminate rhinoviruses from enteroviruses; the ability to detect viral nucleic acids in asymptomatic individuals; and the increased prevalence of coinfections.
