A new continous cell strain (CaPi) was established from normal pitu itary tissue of carp, Cells of a frac tio na ted dispersion (0.25% tryp sin-PBS, 10 "C) of pit uitar ies for med mon olayer (fibroblast-and epithelial-lik e-cells) at 25°C using Eagle's mini mal essentia l medium (M EM) supp lemented with 10% fetal calf serum and non essential amino acids . The continous cell strai n, designated CaPi, was obtained by an enzymati cal selecti on of epitheloid cells fr om the monolayer of the primary pit uitary cell cult ure. T his culture has been subculter ed 70 times over a period of 24 mon ths . CaPi-c ells multiply over a temperature range of 15-35°C wi th an optimum growth temperature of 30°C at a seedi ng density of 1.7 x 10· cells /m\. Chromosome ana lysis ind icate s th e cells are het eroploid and show modal numb ers of 47 chromoso mes. T he CaPi cell line is susceptible to fishviru ses (VHSV, PFR, SVCV) producing cyto pathic effects (CPE). H owever, IPNV repl icate s witho ut visible cell alterations.
