Objective: To determine major factors and quantify its effect on the increase/decrease of hospitalization days using a decomposition method. Setting: Making use of the hospital records for all patients in Hong Kong during the period 2000-2010. Participants: All the inpatients in the hospital systems in Hong Kong Primary and secondary outcome measures: It consists of information: 1) the rate of change in the number of patients, (2) the average number of visits per patient in a year, and (3) the mean duration of stay for each visit. Results: The decomposition results show that the mean duration of stay per visit (from 6.83 to 4.58 days) is the most important factor in the reduction of the total number of hospitalization days, despite increases in: total population size (from 6.7 to 7.0 million), the number of individual hospital admissions (from 583,000 to 664,000), and episodes (from 1.2 to 1.4 million) from 2000 to 2010. The reduction in hospitalized days per person from 2000 to 2010 of 200.6% is contributed to by the decrease of mean duration of stay, and it is offset by -51.1% due to the slight growth in the frequency of public hospital admissions and -49.4% by the difference of hospital admission rates. Conclusion: A better management of the duration of stay of patients per visit is the most important component to control the increase of health expenditure. • Increase of health expenditure mainly arising from the hospitalization cost has become a serious concern in all developed countries. • Using a decomposition method to understand the effects of the following three factors (i) the number of patients, (ii) the number of visit per patient in each year and (iii) the average duration of stay per visit on the total hospitalization days • What is the most effective way to contain the increase of hospitalization? Key messages: • The decomposition analysis results show that the mean duration of stay per visit (from 6.83 to 4.58 days) is the most important factor in the reduction of the total number of hospitalization days, despite increases in: total population size (from 6.7 to 7.0 million), the number of individual hospital admissions (from 583,000 to 664,000), and episodes (from 1.2 to 1.4 million) from 2000 to 2010. • The reduction in hospitalized days per person from 2000 to 2010 from 1.18 to 0.93. Of those, 200.6% is contributed to by the decrease of mean duration of stay, and it is offset by -51.1% due to the slight growth in the frequency of public hospital admissions and -49.4% by the difference of hospital admission rates. • A better management of the duration of stay of patients per visit is the most important component to control the increase of health expenditure.
