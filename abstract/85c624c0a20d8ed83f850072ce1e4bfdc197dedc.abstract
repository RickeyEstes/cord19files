The use of PIU during the SARS crisis had a number of positive effects in Taiwan. It enabled the safe transport of SARS patients between hospitals by air and road and decreased the risk of cross-infecting transport personnel. The anxiety of transport personnel was decreased, as was the fear felt by the population of the outer islands. In addition, the credibility of the local health authorities was improved among the general population in Taiwan. We thank Charles van Reenen, Philippe Barrault, Roger Farrow, Pascal Rey Herme, and International SOS for developing the PIU and their full support during the transport of SARS patients in Taiwan.
