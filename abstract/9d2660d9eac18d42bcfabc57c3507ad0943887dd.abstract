Olsen, C.G., Stiff, M.I. and Olsen, R.G., 1984. Comparison of the blastogenic response of peripheral blood lymphocytes from canine parvovirus-positive and negative outbred dogs. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol., 6: 285-290. Lymphocyte blast transformation assays (LBT) were performed on canine parvovirus (CPV) -positive and -negative mongrel dogs randomly selected from a humane facility. Concanavalin A as well as Phytohemagglutinin P stimulation was depressed (p<O.OOl) in the group of animals shedding CPV compared to CPV-negative dogs.
