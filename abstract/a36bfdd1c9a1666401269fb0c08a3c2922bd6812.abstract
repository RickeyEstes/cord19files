The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness.

Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged. All rights reserved.
