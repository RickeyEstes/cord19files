Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is classified into two biotypes based on its pathogenicity in cats: a feline enteric coronavirus of low pathogenicity and a highly virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus. It has been suspected that FCoV alters its biotype via mutations in the viral genome. The S and 3c genes of FCoV have been considered the candidates for viral pathogenicity conversion. In the present study, FCoVs were analyzed for the frequency and location of mutations in the S and 3c genes from faecal samples of cats in an animal shelter and the faeces, effusions, and tissues of cats that were referred to veterinary hospitals. Our results indicated that approximately 95% FCoVs in faeces did not carry mutations in the two genes. However, 80% FCoVs in effusion samples exhibited mutations in the S and 3c genes with remainder displaying a mutation in the S or 3c gene. It was also suggested that mutational analysis of the 3c gene could be useful for studying the horizontal transmission of FCoVs in multi-cat environments. The genome of feline coronavirus (FCoV), a member of the Alphacoronavirus 1 species of the genus Alphacoronavirus, comprises single-stranded positive-sense RNA [9] . FCoV infection is prevalent in cats worldwide and is divided into two biotypes: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). The former has low pathogenicity, causing mild enteritis or unapparent infection, and the latter is highly virulent and lethal. FIP is characterised by the accumulation of body cavity effusions (effusive or wet form) and the formation of granulomatous lesions affecting multiple organs (non-effusive or dry form) [10] . FIPVs are considered mutants of FECVs [11, 12, 14] . Although the viral genes responsible for biotype conversion have not been completely elucidated, the candidate genes have been identified. The S gene encodes spike protein on the viral membrane. It was reported that 95.8% of 118 serotype I FIPVs displayed missense mutations in codon 1,058 or 1,060 of the S gene, whereas none of the sample of 183 FECVs exhibited these mutations [6] . The non-synonymous mutations in codons 1,058 and 1,060 substituted methionine to leucine (M1,058L) and serine to alanine (S1,060A), respectively. The 3c gene encoding an accessory viral protein was also reported to be mutated in 60-100% of FIPVs, resulting in the loss or truncation of the 3c protein, whereas most FECVs carried an intact 3c gene [3-5, 8, 11, 13, 14]. Accordingly, it was considered that mutation of the S gene, 3c gene or both was involved in the acquisition or augmentation of lethal pathogenicity in the majorityof FIPV field strains. In the present study, we analyzed the S and 3c genes of FCoVs detected in faecal materials, effusion samples, and tissues that were obtained from cats in Japan to determine the frequency and location of the mutations. An analysis of the 3c gene suggested the horizontal infection of FCoVs, which were detected in effusions and tissues, among several housemate cats in a multi-cat environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical specimens were obtained from 93 cats referred to private veterinary hospitals in Japan for suspected FIP based on clinical symptoms, including pyrexia, vomiting, diarrhoea, jaundice, emaciation, anaemia, ascites, pleural effusion, ophthalmologic abnormalities, neurological signs, and death. Some animals displayed an enlargement of abdominal organs that was noticed on palpation, radiography, or ultrasound. The samples of abdominal and pleural effusions, whole blood, serum, rectal swabs, faeces and tissues were sent to our laboratory under refrigeration. Tissues were obtained via autopsy of four cats that had been kept by the
