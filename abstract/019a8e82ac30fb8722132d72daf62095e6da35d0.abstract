This study investigates the link between macro and non-macro explanatory factors and Chinese hotel stock returns. Macro variables include growth rates of industrial production and imports, discount rates, yield spread and inflation rate. In addition, growth rate of total foreign tourist arrivals (DTA) was introduced as another critical macro factor that may affect Chinese hotel stock returns, considering a tremendous growth of tourism in China. Empirical results indicated that the impact of DTA was positive, but insignificant. Thus, Chinese hotel stock returns were more sensitive to general macro variables. Non-macro events that could significantly impact Chinese hotel stock returns encompass financial crises, natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks, political events, and sports mega-events. Discussions and conclusions are provided to guide hospitality investors. r where E is the expectation operator, DV t is the dividend paid at the end of period t, and k is the appropriate discount rate. Based on the theoretical framework of the DDM, Chen et al. (1986) suggested that macroeconomic (macro hereafter) factors have systematic influences on stock prices through the impact on future dividends and the discount rate. Those macro factors, as they reported, that could significantly affect US stock returns comprised industrial production growth rates, yield spread, term spread, expected inflation rates, and unexpected inflation rates. Since the work by Chen et al. (1986) , financial researchers have extended the investigation to a variety of international stock markets (for example,
