Omics for Marine Mammal Health Chapter | 11 293 genes. The sequencing of the entire DNA of an organism is called a whole genome sequence (WGS). A WGS project involves the sequencing of DNA, the assembly of that sequence to create a representation of the original chromosome, and the annotation and analysis of that representation, with an emphasis on significance and function. It aims at the collective characterization of coding and noncoding DNA regions, their structure, function, and evolution. It reveals the complete DNA makeup of an organism, enabling the better understanding of the variations both within and between species, allowing an accurate differentiation between organisms. Comparisons of genome sequences from different individuals have led to the establishment of copy number variation with over 10 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). SNPs can provide a genetic fingerprint for use in identity testing and are found to be involved in the etiology of many diseases. Several studies have demonstrated the diagnostic utility of WGS, for example, in mutation detection (Lupski et al., 2010; Herdewyn et al., 2012; Bae et al., 2014) or in the identification of clinically relevant variants in ∼40% of pediatric populations with autism (Weedon et al., 2014) and ∼60% of those with intellectual disability (Gilissen et al., 2014). FIGURE 11.1 Outline of the omics sciences describing the complexity of systems. The omics profile of each individual is characterized by its biologic molecules that translate into the structure, function, and dynamics of the organism. Genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome are linked to the phenotype; they can change over time and conditions, in relation to health and environmental issues.
