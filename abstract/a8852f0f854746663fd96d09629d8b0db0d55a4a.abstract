Pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by the emerging severe 24 acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), for which there are no 25 efficacious vaccines or therapeutics that are urgently needed. We expressed three 26 versions of spike (S) proteins-receptor binding domain (RBD), S1 subunit and S 27 ectodomain-in insect cells. RBD appears monomer in solutions, whereas S1 and S 28 associate into homotrimer with substantial glycosylation. The three proteins confer 29 excellent antigenicity with six convalescent COVID-19 patient sera. Cryo-electron 30 microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer dominate in a 31 unique conformation distinguished from the classic prefusion conformation of 32 coronaviruses by the upper S1 region at lower position ~15 Ã… proximal to viral 33 membrane. Such conformation is proposed as an early prefusion state for the SARS-34 CoV-2 spike that may broaden the knowledge of coronavirus and facilitate vaccine 35 development. 36
