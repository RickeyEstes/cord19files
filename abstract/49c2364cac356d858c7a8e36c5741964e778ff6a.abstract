1 stating that all hospitals should require informed consent for patients requesting cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We agree that the meaning of cardiopulmonary arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures, including survival data, needs to be explained in detail to the patient or next of kin/healthcare proxy. We also fully agree that if CPR were explained in detail, most, if not all, of the octogenarian patients and their families would choose a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order. In our experience, when CPR is explained through informed consent, then the refusal rate is more than 90%. However, the assertion by Dr. Bowers that all hospitals should require informed consent for patients requesting CPR goes to the extreme and negates the basics of medicine: the sanctity of life, and changes the focus from saving life to that of withholding treatment. By making DNR the defaulted choice and CPR requiring informed consent would imply that life would not be maintained unless it is requested. This recommendation is not only entirely opposite to current practice, but contrary to the Hippocratic oath that is pledged by physicians 2 and also in opposition to the three Abrahamic monotheistic religions. 3 In addition, it is in contradiction to current existing medical, ethical, and legal standards. We suggest that all physicians continue to be more vigilant toward the discussion of code status and encouragement of formulation of advance directives (healthcare proxy and treatment preferences) on admission and throughout the course of hospitalization. We also recommend that physicians keep themselves engaged in discussion with the patient and next of kin/healthcare proxy so that if the time comes, the patient and/or healthcare proxy can make more informed decisions about withholding of treatment and DNR.
