In this study, we derive an asymptotic solution of the integral equation satisfied by the second moment function M 2 (t, a). We first find the Laplace transform (M 2 ) L (s, a) and then obtain M 2 (t, a) asymptotically by inversion. Further, we have derived the asymptotic expressions of M 2 (t, a) for some special lifetime distributions such as exponential, gamma, Weibull, lognormal and truncated normal. Finally, the asymptotic solution is compared with the numerical solution to evaluate its performance. for k = 1, 2, . . .. If a < 1, then {X k , k = 1, 2, . . .} is stochastically increasing. If a > 1, then {X k , k = 1, 2, . . .} is stochastically decreasing. When a = 1, the GP reduces to a renewal process (RP). Some important characteristics of a GP are the mean value function M(t) and the second moment function M 2 (t). These are defined as follows. The mean value function of a GP, which is also called the geometric function, is given by M (t, a) = E (N (t)) =
