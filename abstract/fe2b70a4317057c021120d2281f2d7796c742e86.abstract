Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is characterized by macrophage and neutrophil leukocyte recruitment and activation in the liver. Damage-and pathogen-associated molecular patterns contribute to a self-perpetuating proinflammatory state in ALD. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) is a surface receptor that amplifies inflammation induced by toll-like receptors (TLRs) and is expressed on neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. We hypothesized that TREM-1 signaling contributes to proinflammatory pathway activation in ALD. Using an in vivo ALD model in mice, we tested the effects of ligand-independent TREM-1 inhibitory peptides that were formulated into human high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-mimicking complexes GF9-HDL and GA/E31-HDL. As revealed in vitro, macrophages endocytosed these rationally designed complexes through scavenger receptors. A 5-week alcohol feeding with the Lieber-DeCarli diet in mice resulted in increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver steatosis, and increased proinflammatory cytokines in the liver. TREM-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was significantly increased in alcohol-fed mice, and TREM-1 inhibitors significantly reduced this increase. TREM-1 inhibition significantly attenuated alcohol-induced spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) activation, an early event in both TLR4 and TREM-1 signaling. The TREM-1 A LD has been a long-standing public health problem globally, yet the pathomechanisms leading to alcoholic hepatitis, a severe and often deadly form of the disease, are only partially understood. The direct effects of alcohol and its metabolites on hepatocytes result in steatosis and
