Background: Since December 2019, acute respiratory disease (ARD) due to 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases. We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29 th , 2020. The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90% were females. Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87% vs. 5.20%, P<0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. 55 patients (5.00%) were .

Severe pneumonia was independently associated with either the admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death in multivariate competing-risk model (sub-distribution hazards ratio, 9.80; 95% confidence interval, 4.06 to 23.67). The 2019-nCoV epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Normal radiologic findings are present among some patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The disease severity (including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count and chest X-ray/CT manifestations) predict poor clinical outcomes. Abstract: 249 words; main text: 2677 words : medRxiv preprint The percentages of patients being admitted to the ICU, requiring invasive ventilation and death were 5.00%, 2.18% and 1.36%, respectively. This corresponded to 67 (6.10%) of patients having reached to the composite endpoint ( Table 3) . Results of the univariate competing risk model are shown in Table E1 in Supplementary Appendix. Severe pneumonia cases (SDHR, 9.803; 95%CI, 4.06 to 23.67), leukocyte count greater than 4,000/mm 3 (SDHR, 4.01; 95%CI, 1.53 to 10.55) and interstitial abnormality on chest X-ray (SDHR, 4.31; 95%CI, 1.73 to 10.75) were associated with the composite endpoint (Fig. 2 , see Table   E2 in Supplementary Appendix). Sensitivity analyses are shown in Figure E2 in Supplementary Appendix. This study has shown that fever occurred in only 43.8% of patients with 2019-nCoV ARD on presentation but developed in 87.9% following hospitalization. Severe pneumonia occurred in 15.7% of cases. No radiologic abnormality was noted on initial presentation in 23.9% and 5.2% of severe and non-severe cases respectively while diarrhea was uncommon. The median incubation period of 2019-nCoV ARD was 3.0 days and it had a relatively lower fatality rate than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Disease severity independently predicted the composite endpoint. Our study provided further evidence of human-to-human transmission. Around only 1% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, while more than three quarters were local residents of Wuhan, or had contacted with people from Wuhan. Most cases were recruited after January 1 st , 2020.
