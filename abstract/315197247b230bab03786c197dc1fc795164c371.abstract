Accumulating evidence has shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in 25 several biological processes, including immune responses. However, the role of lncRNAs in 26 antiviral innate immune responses remains largely unexplored. Here, we identify an 27 uncharacterized human lncRNA from influenza A virus (IAV) patients, antivirus and activate 28 neutrophil (AVAN), that is significantly up-regulated upon virus infection. Mechanistically, 29 nuclear lncRNA-AVAN positively regulates the transcription of forkhead box O3A (FOXO3a) 30 by associating with its promoter and inducing chromatin remodeling to promote neutrophil 31 chemotaxis. Furthermore, we also found that cytoplasmic lncRNA-AVAN directly binds 32 tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25) and enhances the association of TRIM25 and 33 Retinoic acid inducible gene-1 proteins (RIG-I) and the ubiquitylation of RIG-I, thereby 34 promoting TRIM25-and RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune signaling. More 35 importantlyï¼Œwe enforced the expression of AVAN in transgenic mice and found that it 36 significantly alleviated IAV virulence and virus production. Collectively, these findings 37 highlight the potential clinical implications of lncRNA-AVAN as a key positive regulator of 38 the antiviral innate immune response and a promising target for developing broad antiviral 39 therapeutics. 40 41
