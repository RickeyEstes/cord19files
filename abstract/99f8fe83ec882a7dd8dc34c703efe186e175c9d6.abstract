The diagnosis and treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been based largely on a one-size-fits-all approach. Diagnosis of COPD is based on meeting the physiologic criteria of fixed obstruction in forced expiratory flows and treatment focus on symptomatic relief, with limited effect on overall prognosis. However, patients with COPD have distinct features that determine very different evolutions of the disease. In this review we highlight distinct subgroups of COPD characterized by unique pathophysiologic derangements, response to treatment, and disease progression. It is likely that identification of subgroups of COPD will lead to discovery of much needed disease-modifying therapeutic approaches. We argue that a precision approach that integrates multiple dimensions (clinical, physiologic, imaging, and endotyping) is needed to move the field forward in the treatment of this disease.
