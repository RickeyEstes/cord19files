Conventional disinfection methods are limited by reliance on the operator to ensure appropriate selection, formulation, distribution and contact time of the agent. 'No-touch' automated room disinfection (NTD) systems remove or reduce reliance on operators and so they have the potential to improve the effi cacy of terminal disinfection. The most commonly used systems are hydrogen peroxide vapour (H 2 O 2 vapour), aerosolised hydrogen peroxide (aHP) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. These systems have important differences in their active agent, delivery mechanism, effi cacy, process time and ease of use. The choice of NTD system should be infl uenced by the intended application, the evidence base for effectiveness, practicalities of implementation and cost constraints.
