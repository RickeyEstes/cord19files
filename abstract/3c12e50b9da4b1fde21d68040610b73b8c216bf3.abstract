Coronaviruses express a multifunctional papain-like protease, termed PLP2. PLP2 acts as 17 a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which 18 removes ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies 19 implicated PLP2 DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but 20 the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-21 guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the 22 ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein 23 processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus 24 and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured 25 macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly as the wild-type 26 virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared 27 to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively 28 regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to the wild-type 29 virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) 30 in viral titer in livers and spleens at day 5 post-infection, albeit both wild-type and DUBmut virus 31 infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided 32 mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of PLP2-ubiquitin complex, and that 33 PLP2 DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis. 34 Importance Coronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that 36 function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune 37 response.

To 40 separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis 41 approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin-binding. We found that mutating 42 the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease 43 activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed 44 that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and 45 exhibited reduced pathogenesis in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2/DUB is 46 an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses. 47 48 Coronaviruses (CoVs) are members of the order Nidovirales, which includes enveloped viruses 49 with large (~30kb), positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes that yield a characteristic nested 50 set of subgenomic mRNAs during replication in the cytoplasm of infected cells (1, 2). The genome 51 organization for coronaviruses is highly conserved, with the 5'-most two-thirds of the genome 52 encoding the replicase polyprotein, followed by sequences encoding the canonical structural 53 proteins: spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. Many CoVs contain accessory genes, 54 which are interspersed among the genes for the structural proteins. Although these accessory genes 55 are not necessarily required for virus replication and are, in general, not highly conserved within 56 the virus family, many encode proteins that regulate the host response (3). Interestingly, 57 coronavirus replicase proteins, which are highly conserved, can also act as antagonists to block or 58 delay the host innate immune response to infection (1, 4-8). That a slew of coronavirus-encoded 59 accessory and non-accessory proteins have been shown to shape the host antiviral response 60 suggests that viral-mediated subversion of host defenses is an important element of infection.

Coronavirus proteases are essential for viral replication as they are responsible for processing 64 the replicase polyprotein (2,(9)(10)(11). Murine coronavirus MHV encodes three proteases: two 65 papain-like proteases (PLP1 and PLP2) and one chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro, also termed 66 Mpro). MHV PLP2 is similar to the single papain-like protease (termed PLpro) of Severe Acute 67 Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 68 Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (9, 12-16). We and others have revealed that PLP2 or PLpro of 69 multiple coronaviruses, including MHV, are multifunctional, not only capable of cleaving the viral 70 polyprotein but also possessing deubiquitinase (DUB) and deISGylating (de-conjugating ISG15 71 molecule from modified substrates) activities (9, 12, 13, 15-27). However, it has been challenging 72 to study the effects of a mutated DUB on virus replication and pathogenesis because the protease 73 and DUB activities share the same catalytic site, disruption of which is lethal for virus replication. 74 Therefore, it was necessary for us to identify residue(s) within the MHV protease/DUB-ubiquitin 75 binding surface that can be mutated to result in reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein 76 processing. In this report, we describe the X-ray structure-guided identification of such residues 77 and evaluate the replication, IFN antagonistic effect, and pathogenesis of a recombinant DUB 78 mutant MHV. 79 Results Structure-guided identification of PLP2 residues interacting with ubiquitin. To investigate 81 the role of viral deubiquitinating activity in coronavirus replication and pathogenesis, we first 82 needed to identify amino acid residues that, when mutated, result in reduced DUB activity while 83 All rights reserved.

X-ray structural studies of SARS-and MERS-CoV papain-like protease/DUBs co-85 crystalized with ubiquitin modified at the c-terminus with a covalent warhead (aldehyde, 3-bromo- 86 propylamine, or propargylamine) allowed for identification of residues that are important for direct 87 interaction with ubiquitin (17, 18, 20). Here, we took a slightly different approach and mutated the 88 catalytic cysteine (C1716) of MHV PLP2 to a serine residue and co-crystallized it with free 89 ubiquitin. The X-ray structure of MHV PLP2 (C1716S) in complex with ubiquitin was determined 90 to a resolution of 1.85 Ã… and an overall Rfree = 19.6% and Rwork = 15.8% (PDB: 5WFI). The overall 91 structure of the MHV PLP2-ubiquitin complex is similar to other PLP2/PLpro ubiquitin-bound 92 structures (Fig. 1A). Ubiquitin binds within the palm region and is gripped by the zinc-fingers 93 motif while the C-terminus extends into the active site. 94 Next, we aligned the primary amino acid sequence of the MHV PLP2 domain with the 95 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV papain-like protease domains (Fig. 1E) . The sequence alignment and 96 X-ray structure of the MHV PLP2-ubiquitin complex were then analyzed in conjunction with the 97 previous structural and mutagenesis studies on SARS-and MERS-CoV to identify candidate 98 residues that could be mutated to render a loss of DUB activity in vitro. From this analysis, we 99 identified three residues (R1803, D1772, F1812) in MHV PLP2 that form direct interactions with 100 ubiquitin (Fig. 1B-D) . Two of the side chain guanidinium nitrogens of R1803 form direct hydrogen 101 bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of A46 in ubiquitin (Fig. 1B) . The two side chain 102 carboxylate oxygens of D1772 in MHV PLP2 interact with ubiquitin by forming direct bonds with 103 each of the guanidinium nitrogens of R42 and with one of the guanidinium nitrogens of R72 (Fig.   104 1C). Finally, F1812 forms Van der Waals contacts with the side chains of I44 and V70 and the 105 delta-carbon of R42 of ubiquitin (Fig. 1D) . 106 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. To identify a mutant MHV PLP2 enzyme that 107 retains protease activity but exhibits reduced DUB and/or deISGylating activity, we performed 108 site-directed mutagenesis on each of the residues (R1803, D1772, F1812) by changing each to an 109 alanine to disrupt interactions with ubiquitin. Each mutant enzyme was expressed, purified, and 110 tested for its ability to hydrolyze three substrates: z-RLRGG-AMC, Ub-AMC, and ISG15-AMC. The activity of each mutant enzyme toward each substrate relative to the wild-type enzyme is 112 shown in Fig. 2A . All three mutants retained their ability to hydrolyze the peptide substrate but 113 each mutant had altered specificity toward Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC substrates. Mutation of 114 F1812 resulted in a substantial decrease in hydrolysis of both Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC (Class 115 I), whereas mutation of R1803 resulted in loss of activity only toward ISG15-AMC (Class II), and 116 mutation of D1772 resulted in loss of activity only toward Ub-AMC (Class III). 117 151 All rights reserved.

Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred 335 to PVDF membrane in transfer buffer (0.025M Tris, 0.192M glycine, 20% methanol) for 1 hour 336 at 60 Volts at 4Â°C. Following this, the membrane was blocked using 5% dried skim milk in TBST 337 buffer (0.9% NaCl, 10mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4Â°C. The membrane 338 was incubated with either polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibody (A11122, Life Technologies) for 339 the protease assay, or mouse anti-flag (F3165, Sigma) for the DUB assay. The membrane was then 340 washed three times for 15 minutes in TBST buffer followed by incubation with either secondary 341 donkey anti-rabbit-HRP antibody (711-035-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch) or goat anti-mouse-342 HRP antibody (1010-05, SouthernBiotech). Then the membrane was washed three more times for 343 15 minutes in TBST buffer. Detection was performed using Western Lighting Chemiluminescence 344 Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer) and visualized using a FluoroChemE Imager (Protein Simple). The 345 expression of PLP2, Î²-actin, and calnexin were probed with mouse anti-V5 antibody (R960, 346 ThermoFisher), mouse anti-Î²-actin (A00702, Genscript), or mouse anti-calnexin antibody (2433S, 347 Cell Signaling), respectively. 348 Biosensor live cell assay 349 The protease activity of PLP2 was also assessed using a biosensor live cell assay as 350 described previously (14). Briefly, HEK293T cells in a 96 black-wall plate were transfected with 351 37.5 ng pGlo-RLKGG construct and 50 ng PLP2 expression plasmids. GloSensor (E1290, 352 Promega) reagent diluted in DMEM+10% FCS was added at 18 hpi. Plates were read using a 353 luminometer (Veritas) every hour over a course of 5 hours. 354 All rights reserved.
