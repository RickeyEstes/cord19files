Synthesis and in vitro cytostatic activity of new b-D-arabino furan[1 0 ,2 0 :4,5]oxazolo-and arabino-pyrimidinone derivatives a b s t r a c t A series of nucleoside derivatives was obtained via heteroatom annulation of the amino oxazoline of D-(À)-arabinose. Unequivocal proofs for the stereostructure of some new arabinosyl pyrimidinone derivatives were obtained by X-ray structure analysis. These newly synthesized compounds were then evaluated for their cytostatic activity against murine leukemia (L1210), and human T-lymphocytes (Molt 4/C8 and CEM). Of all the compounds in the series, the protected silylated tricyclic fused pyrimidinone 10 showed the most significant antitumor activity against murine leukemia L1210 (IC 50 ¼ 6 mM), and human T-lymphocytes cells Molt 4/C8 (IC 50 ¼ 7.9 mM) and CEM/0 cell lines (IC 50 ¼ 7.5 mM). None of the compounds exhibited significant antiviral inhibitory activities.
