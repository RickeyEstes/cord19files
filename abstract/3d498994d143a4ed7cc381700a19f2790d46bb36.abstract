In the analysis of genomic sequence data, so-called "alignment free" approaches are often 12 selected for their relative speed compared to alignment-based approaches, especially in the 13 application of distance comparisons and taxonomic classification 1,2,3,4 . These methods are 14 typically reliant on excising K-length substrings of the input sequence, called K-mers 5 . In 15 the context of machine learning, K-mer based feature vectors have been used in 16 applications ranging from amplicon sequencing classification to predictive modeling for 17 antimicrobial resistance genes 6,7,8 . This can be seen as an analogy of the "bag-of-words" 18 model successfully employed in natural language processing and computer vision for 19 document and image classification 9,10 . Feature extraction techniques from natural language 20 processing have previously been analogized to genomics data 11 ; however, the "bag-of-21 words" approach is brittle in the RNA virus space due to the high intersequence variance 22 and the exact matching requirement of K-mers. To reconcile the simplicity of "bag-of-23 words" methods with the complications presented by the intrinsic variance of RNA virus 24 space, a method to resolve the fragility of extracted K-mers in a way that faithfully reflects 25 an underlying biological phenomenon was devised. Our algorithm, Vorpal, allows the 26 construction of interpretable linear models with clustered, representative 'degenerate' K-27 mers as the input vector and, through regularization, sparse predictors of binary 28 phenotypes as the output. Here, we demonstrate the utility of Vorpal by identifying 29 nucleotide-level genomic motif predictors for binary phenotypes in three separate RNA 30 virus clades; human pathogen vs. non-human pathogen in Orthocoronavirinae, 31 hemorrhagic fever causing vs. non-hemorrhagic fever causing in Ebolavirus, and human-32 host vs. non-human host in Influenza A. The capacity of this approach for in silico 33 identification of hypotheses which can be validated by direct experimentation, as well as 34 identification of genomic targets for preemptive biosurveillance of emerging viruses, is 35 discussed.
