Virus-specific vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases. However, broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e. compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of general population from emerging and reemerging viral diseases reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options. Here, we reviewed discovery and development of BSAAs and summarized the information on 119 safe-in-man agents in freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/). Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2015). Antiviral drugs and vaccines are used to fight viral infections in human (De Clercq and Li, 2016; Marston et al., 2014). Previously, there has been a focus on "one drug, one virus" dogma, which relied on targeting virus-specific factors. A counterpoint to this is "one drug, multiple viruses" paradigm, which came with the discovery of broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs), small-molecules that inhibit a wide range of human viruses (Bekerman and Einav, 2015; de Clercq and Montgomery, 1983; Debing et al., 2015; Ianevski et al., 2019; Rada and Dragun, 1977; Sidwell et al., 1972). This paradigm was based on the observation that different viruses utilize similar pathways and host factors to replicate inside a cell (Bosl et al., 2019). Although the concept of BSAAs has been around for almost 50 years, the field received a new impetus with recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, Dengue, influenza and other viral infections, the discovery of novel host-directed agents as well as development of drug repositioning methodology. Drug repurposing, also called repositioning, redirecting, reprofiling, is a strategy for generating additional value from an existing drug by targeting disease other than that for which it was originally intended (Nishimura and Hara, 2018; Pushpakom et al., 2019). This has significant advantages over new drug discovery since chemical synthesis steps, manufacturing processes, reliable safety, and pharmacokinetic properties in pre-clinical (animal model) and early clinical developmental phases (phase 0, I and IIa) are already available (Figure 1). Therefore, repositioning of launched or even failed drugs to viral diseases provides unique translational opportunities, including a substantially higher probability of success J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f De Clercq, E., Li, G., 2016.
