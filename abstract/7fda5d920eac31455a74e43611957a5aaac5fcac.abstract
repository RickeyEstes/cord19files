The three-dimensional multiple-relaxation-time LB (MRT-LB) and Lagrangian particle tracking methods were applied to simulate turbulent airflow and particle dispersion in a ventilated room with a partition. The turbulent airflow was simulated by large eddy simulation (LES) using the MRT-LB method with the Smagorinsky model. This method was verified by comparing it with experimental and other numerical results. Good agreement was observed between airflow simulation and experimental data. It is also demonstrated that the LES carried out by the MRT-LB method can produce airflow results very similar to the RNG LES and provide better prediction than the standard and RNG k-ε models. In order to further improve the efficiency of the MRT-LB method, the multi-block grid refinement (MBGR) technique was used. The accuracy and efficiency of the MBGR and the consistency of physical quantities across the interface were investigated. In simulation of particle dispersion in the model room, particles with diameters of 1 and 10 mm were considered. It is shown that this model can successfully capture dispersion characteristics of particles. In recent years, the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method has emerged as a promising alternative computational technique for simulating fluid flows with complex physics (Chen & Doolen, 1998; Succi, 2001) . Unlike conventional numerical methods, which solve the discrete macroscopic Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations, the LB method is based on the solution of discrete Boltzmann equation on a lattice with discrete velocity fields (Qian et al., 1992) . It has several advantages over conventional CFD. As the pressure in the LB method is calculated by using the equation of the state, there is no need to solve the Poisson equation as the conventional CFD methods do, which often costs significant computational efforts. This makes the LB method computationally more efficient and preferred in large-scale simulations (Stratford & Pagonabarraga, 2008) . It can deal with an arbitrary complex curved boundary readily; its intrinsic parallel nature also makes it computationally efficient in that high performance computers can be fully utilized. The potential applicability of the LB method in IAQ has not been explored fully. Only a few related works have been reported, e. g., Przekop et al. (2003) applied 2D lattice Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (LBGK) model to study the local structure of deposited particles in fibrous filters. Jafari et al. (2010) investigated particle dispersion and deposition over a square cylinder in a 2D channel flow using LBGK. The current authors also employed multiple-relaxation-time LB (MRT-LB) method to study particle dispersion and deposition in a 3D scaled ventilated chamber (Ding et al., 2012) . Previous work was mainly focused on low Reynolds number conditions. As indoor airflow is mainly turbulent, there is a great demand for the application of LB for turbulent flows. Large eddy simulation (LES) is often a good choice for capturing the turbulence as computational costs are significantly lower than direct numerical simulations (DNS) while its resolution is higher as compared with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. Furthermore, LES directly resolves the large eddies mainly attributed to the transport of momentum and energy of turbulence, and only the subgrid-scale eddies are modeled. This can result in transient airflow conditions which play important roles in particle transport. Conventionally, the IAQ problems are almost resolved by RANS approach, and recently the LES based on the N-S equations has become more popular (Tian et al., 2006) . LES can also be performed using the LB method. The simplest way is to incorporate the LB method with the Smagorinsky model. The computational procedure of the Smagorinsky model in LB is entirely local, which makes it compatible with the parallel nature of the LB method. The pioneering work of Hou et al. (1996) paved the way to implement the Smagorinsky model in LBGK. They applied it to study dynamics and the Reynolds number dependence of flow structures of a 2D-liddriven cavity flow. Fernandino et al. (2009) performed LES of 3D turbulent open duct flow using LBGK. In addition, it has been well demonstrated that significant improvements in numerical stability can be achieved by using MRT-LB (Lallemand & Luo, 2000), which directly results in a drastic gain in computational efficiency. It is therefore natural to incorporate MRT-LB with the Smagorinsky model to improve turbulence simulations using the LB method. Krafczyk et al. (2003) introduced the Smagorinsky model into MRT-LB and carried out simulations of the flow over a surface-mounted cube in a channel. Yu et al. (2006) applied this method to simulate turbulent square jet flow. Based on these previous studies, there is a potential to extend the application of LES using the LB method, especially MRT-LB, to indoor environments. One basic criterion about the application of MRT-LB in practical indoor environments is to make the number of grids as small as possible. In wall-bounded turbulent flows, lengths are very small when the flow is close to a wall, requiring relatively fine grids to resolve turbulent structures adequately. When it is farther from the wall, coarser grids can be introduced as the turbulence length scale is larger. Thus, there is no need to employ a uniform grid fine enough to resolve the wall regions through the domain which would entail significant computational cost. Moreover, the scales of turbulent flow vary locally in general situations (Premnath et al., 2009) . Therefore, the local grid refinement strategy in conjunction with the LB method (Yu et al., 2003) can be an attractive choice. Filippova and Hänel (1998) proposed a local refinement method in which a coarse grid covered the whole domain, and a finer grid in critical sub-regions was superimposed on the basic coarser grid. This allowed two-way information exchange at the grid interface at the post-collision stage after rescaling the density distribution functions on both grid levels. Based on Filippova and Hänel (1998), Lin and Lai (2000) proposed a method which allowed one-way information exchange at the post-streaming stage without rescaling the density distribution function. Yu et al. (2002) introduced the multi-block grid to the LB method where the computational domain was divided into different blocks which did not overlap each other. The grid size was uniform with the desired resolution in each block. The blocks were connected only through interface information exchange which followed the scheme of Filippova and Hänel (1998) . Performances of these methods, including accuracy and efficiency aspects with emphasis on the conservative properties across the grid interface, were evaluated systematically by Yu et al. (2003) . In this paper, LES computation of turbulent airflow in indoor environments was carried out using the three-dimensional MRT-LB method with the Smagorinsky model. Experimental and numerical data for a model room (Posner et al., 2003; Tian et al., 2006) were employed to verify the present simulation. Moreover, we incorporated variable resolutions in the MRT-LB method by introducing a local grid refinement approach within the multi-block grid (Yu et al., 2002) . Computational accuracy and efficiency of the MRT-LB method with grid refinement were evaluated by comparing with the corresponding results of the uniform grid case. Then the particle dispersion in the model room was simulated based on the airflow conditions obtained above. Flow simulation In this section, the MRT-LB method with 19 discrete velocities in three dimensions (i.e. D3Q19 model), employed in our recent work (Ding et al., 2012), were also used for flow simulation.
