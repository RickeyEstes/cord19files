Isolates of Escherichia coli which produce Vero cytotoxin (VTEC) were obtained during 1983-1989 from calves raised in 5 north-central states of the USA. All of the calves experienced intestinal epithelial colonization by VTEC, diarrhea or both; twelve of the calves had bloody diarrhea. Twenty one isolates were serogroup O111 and the others were O103, 069, 045, 026, 05, or non-typable (4 isolates ). All but one of the isolates hybridized with the CVD419 probe which identifies most VTEC strains. Thirty two isolates hybridized with the VTI probe, 3 with both the VT 1 and VT2 probes, and one with neither probe. The culture filtrate of the VT probe negative isolate was partially neutralized by SLT I monoclonal antibody. For the other isolates, the results of toxin neutralization by anti-SLT I and anti-SLT II monoclonal antibodies corresponded exactly with the VT 1 and VT2 probe hybridization results. Three of the strains adhered in a localized manner to HEp-2 cells and Intestine 407 cells.
