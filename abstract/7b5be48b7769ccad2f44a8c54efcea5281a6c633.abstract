20 BACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic, first emerged in Wuhan during December 2019, has 21 spread globally. While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly 22 influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its 23 control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in 24 China. fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of 29 population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p<0.001; 30 City r=0.6311, p<0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p<0.001; City r=0.6358, p<0.001). 31 The local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with 32 reduced infections nationwide. Moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was 33 inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p <0.001) and infection rates (r =-0.4912, p <0.01). 34 Similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r =-0.4791, p<0.01) and lower cure 35 rates (r = 0.5286, p<0.01) among the confirmed cases. 36 CONCLUSIONS The spread of the COVID-19 in China in its early phase was attributed primarily 37 to population movement from Hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and 38 adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved 39 prognosis of affected individuals. 40 41 .
