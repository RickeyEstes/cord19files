Journal Pre-proof NBCZone: Universal three-dimensional construction of eleven amino acids near the catalytic nucleophile and base in the superfamily of (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases Please cite this article as: A.I. Denesyuk, M.S. Johnson, O.M.H. Salo-Ahen, et al., NBCZone: Universal three-dimensional construction of eleven amino acids near the catalytic nucleophile and base in the superfamily of (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases, International Journal of Biological Macromolecules(2020), https://doi.Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Abstract (Chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases belong to the serine/cysteine proteases found in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. Their catalytic activity is carried out using a triad of amino acids, a nucleophile, a base, and an acid. For this superfamily of proteases, we propose the existence of a universal 3D structure comprising 11 amino acids near the catalytic nucleophile and base -Nucleophile-Base Catalytic Zone (NBCZone). The comparison of NBCZones among 169 eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and viral (chymo)trypsin-like proteases suggested the existence of 15 distinct groups determined by the combination of amino acids located at two "key" structure-functional positions 54 T and 55 T near the catalytic base His57 T . Most eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteases fell into two major groups, [ST]A and TN. Usually, proteases of [ST]A group contain a disulfide bond between cysteines Cys42 T and Cys58 T of the NBCZone. In contrast, viral proteases were distributed among seven groups, and lack this disulfide bond. Furthermore, only the [ST]A group of eukaryotic proteases contains glycine at position 43 T , which is instrumental for activation of these enzymes. In contrast, due to the side chains of residues at position 43 T prokaryotic and viral proteases do not have the ability to carry out the structural transition of the eukaryotic zymogen-zyme type. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f pattern G-[DE]-S-G-[GS] (https://prosite.expasy.org/; PROSITE documentation PDOC00124; TRYPSIN_SER, PS00135 [8]). In addition to this pattern, there is also a histidine active site pattern [LIVM]-[ST]-A-[STAG]-H-C (TRYPSIN_HIS, PS00134). In both families, the oxyanion hole is situated adjacent to the nucleophile and is mainly shaped by the main-chain nitrogen atoms of two residues, but again the sequential order is different. Knowing the importance of the existence of a catalytic acid, nucleophile, and oxyanion zones for the function of the α/β hydrolases fold enzymes and with the possible presence of similar structural formations in other types of hydrolases, we carried out a detailed analysis of the spatial structures of (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases near the catalytic triad residues. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 As a result, fifteen variants of a unique structural Nucleophile-Base Catalytic Zone (NBCZone) were found that affect the conformations of the catalytic triad residue loops of all (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases (eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and viral). Eukaryotic serine (chymo)trypsin-like fold proteases The presentation of our results will begin with an analysis of the tertiary structure of bovine trypsin active site (Protein Data Bank (PDB: [9]), PDB ID: 4I8H, chain A, Fig. 1) [10]. Fig. 1 shows the catalytic triad that includes residues His57, Asp102 and Ser195. In addition to the base His57 and the nucleophile Ser195, the localization of Ser54, Ala55, and Cys58 of the PROSITE TRYPSIN_HIS pattern is shown, as well as amino acids of the PROSITE TRYPSIN_SER pattern: Gly193-Asp194-Ser195-Gly196-Gly197 and two main-chain nitrogens: N/Gly193 and N/Ser195, which are the canonical oxyanions OxyI and OxyII [11]. In trypsin, there are two amino acids that interact with both the PROSITE TRYPSIN_HIS pattern and the PROSITE TRYPSIN_SER pattern. The amino acids Gly43 and Val213 are in contact with the tripeptide Ser195-Gly196-Gly197 (Fig. 2A, Table 1). Main-chain atoms of Gly43 form a hydrogen bond with Ser195: N/Gly43-O/Ser195, and a weak hydrogen bond with Gly196: O/Gly43-CA/Gly196. Similar to Gly43, main-chain atoms of Val213 form two hydrogen bonds with the dipeptide Gly196-Gly197 (N/Val213-O/Gly197 and O/Val213-N/Gly196); the tetrapeptide Asp194-Gly197 forms a β-turn (data not shown). Main-chain atoms of Gly43 and Val213 are also in contact with the dipeptide Ser54-Ala55 from the PROSITE TRYPSIN_HIS pattern: contacts O/Gly43-OG/Ser54 and O/Val213-CB/Ala55 are shown ( Fig. 2A) . The group of connected amino acids presented in Fig. 2A we have named the 43/213 Nucleophile-Base Catalytic Zone (43/213-NBCZone) of trypsin. Unlike the 43/213-NBCZone, which incorporates only two amino acids of the PROSITE TRYPSIN_HIS pattern, Ser54 and Ala55, the entire PROSITE TRYPSIN_HIS pattern is included into the neighboring 42/43 Base Catalytic Zone, which contains the pentapeptide Ser54-Ala55-Ala56-His57-Cys58 and the dipeptide Cys42-Gly43 (Fig. 2B). Cys58 and Cys42 of this zone are linked by a disulfide bond, which maintains the conformation of the polypeptide chain near the active site. In addition, these two cysteines have contacts with the Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 main-chain oxygen of the catalytic nucleophile ( Table 1). In the remaining part of this article, the 43/213 Nucleophile-Base Catalytic Zone together with the 42/43 Base Catalytic Zone will be joined together and called the Nucleophile-Base Catalytic Zone (NBCZone) of trypsin. It is important to note that the side chain of the catalytic nucleophile Ser195, the side chain of the catalytic base His57 and the entire catalytic acid Asp102 are not part the NBCZone of trypsin. The structure of trypsin may be either in active form [10] or inactive (zymogen) form [12] prior to proteolytic activation. Another name for the enzymetrypsinogencorresponds to the inactive form. However, in other proteases, the inactive form of the protein tertiary structure can be either similar or different from the zymogenic form of trypsin. Thus, in order to simplify the writing of the text of the article, we will use the structural term "zymogen" to describe only the zymogenic inactive form of trypsin and other proteases, while we will use the term "zyme" to collectively describe the remaining structural forms of proteases, which will include both non-zymogenic inactive forms (zyme inact ) and active forms (zyme act ) of the enzymes. In trypsin (PDB ID: 4I8H), the non-zymogenic form of the tertiary structure of the protein corresponds to zyme act . Structural comparison shows that the NBCZones of bovine trypsin (zyme act ; PDB ID: 4I8H) and trypsinogen (zymogen; PDB ID: 1TGT) are the same (Table 1) . Indeed, the main structural differences between trypsin and trypsinogen lie in the activation domain [13], while the eleven amino acids of trypsin NBCZone lie outside of it. In the SCOP database, (chymo)trypsin-like fold serine proteins are divided into 4 families: eukaryotic, prokaryotic, viral serine, and viral cysteine proteases [1]. Looking at the tertiary structures among the eukaryotic (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases in the PDB, SCOP, CATH [14], and MEROPS [15] databases we found, besides trypsin, another 14 proteins that have both zyme (either zyme inact or zyme act ) and zymogen forms of the three-dimensional structures, 49 proteases without the zymogen form and three with only the zymogen form, totaling to 67 tertiary structures (Tables 1, S1 and S2). In this work, for each protease, we will use both the original numbering of the amino acid sequence and the canonical numbering of the amino acid sequence of trypsin which is shown by the index "T". The 67 eukaryotic Journal Pre-proof 1). This indicates the existence of the NBCZones in these four proteins. In MASP-1 (PDB ID: 3GOV, [24]), unlike the other family members, there is a Cys475(42 T )-Cys491(58 T ) disulfide bond. In addition, this protease has a very long loop B (Ala488-Asp513), compared with the corresponding loops in other proteases of this family [24]. It is possible that the structural and functional features of loop B, together with loop A and the amino acids adjacent to them, determine the presence of the Cys475(42 T )-Cys491(58 T ) disulfide bond in MASP-1. Although the probability is very high for alanine to be at position 55 T of eukaryotic Journal Pre-proof I ( Table S1 , column 4). Further analysis of prokaryotic and viral proteases will show that all these proteases of set I have an incompetent conformation of catalytic histidine, and as the result, the tripeptide Asn55 T -Xaa56 T -His57 T forms an Asx-turn. Thus, the analysis of the structures of HtrA1, HtrA2, and HtrA3 proteases demonstrates that Asn55 T is characterized Prokaryotic serine (chymo)trypsin-like fold proteases As in the case of eukaryotic (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases, most prokaryotic proteases fall into the TA and TN groups (Tables 1 and S1) . Only now the TA and TN groups are almost equal in terms of the number of the available tertiary structures that have fallen into them. The presence (TA group) or absence (TN group) of a disulfide bond Cys42 T -Cys58 T is also similar in prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteases. Furthermore, when the Journal Pre-proof Another noticeable difference between the NBCZones of eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteases is the appearance of the 43&[STG]V group in prokaryotic proteins (Tables 1 and   S1 ). These proteases belong to the SPATE family [36, 37] . The presence of number 43 in the group name is due to the fact that the six proteins of this group have the amino acid main Journal Pre-proof This work is supported by a grant from the Sigrid Juselius Foundation and Joe, Pentti, and Tor Borg Memorial Fund.
