Over the last decade, the interest in electrospun nanomaterials and their applications has increased. The fascinating and unparalleled properties of electrospun nanomaterials, such as large surface-to-volume ratios and high open porosity, have opened new and unexpected fi elds of application, especially in ultrasensitive sensors. By exploiting the inherent physical, electrical and mechanical properties of nanomaterials, it is possible to improve the performance of conventional sensors by increasing their sensitivity, selectivity, portability and power effi ciency. In this chapter, the recent progress in the development of electrospun nanomaterials is reviewed. In particular, applications in some predominant sensing approaches, such as acoustic wave, resistive, photoelectric, optical and biological, are discussed. Electrospinning is a highly versatile technique to process solutions or melts, mainly of polymers, into continuous fi bers with diameters ranging from several micrometers down to a few nanometers by applying a high voltage on a polymer solution or melt ejected from a micro-syringe pump. In 1934, Formhals described the operation of electrospinning in a US patent for the fi rst time; but only since the 1990s has it gained substantial attention. Since that time, the process has attracted rapidly growing interest triggered by potential applications of nanofi bers in nanoscience and nanotechnology. Several research groups, especially the Reneker group, revived interest in this technology and have demonstrated a possibility to electrospin a wide variety of polymeric fi bers (Doshi and Reneker, 1995; Reneker and Chun, 1996; Fong et al ., 1999) . A number of review articles have been published recently which provide an insight into the most prominent aspects of electrospinning (Huang et al .
