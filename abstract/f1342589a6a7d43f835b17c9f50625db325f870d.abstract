Several regulators of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)associated degradation (ERAD) have a shorter halflife compared to conventional ER chaperones. At steady state, they are selectively removed from the ER by poorly defined events collectively referred to as ERAD tuning. Here we identify the complex comprising the type-I transmembrane protein SEL1L and the cytosolic protein LC3-I as an ERAD tuning receptor regulating the COPII-independent, vesicle-mediated removal of the lumenal ERAD regulators EDEM1 and OS-9 from the ER. Expression of folding-defective polypeptides enhances the lumenal content of EDEM1 and OS-9 by inhibiting their SEL1L:LC3-I-mediated segregation. This raises ERAD activity in the absence of UPR-induction. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) subverts ERAD tuning for replication. Consistently, SEL1L or LC3 silencing impair the MHV life cycle. Collectively, our data provide new molecular information about the ERAD tuning mechanisms that regulate ERAD in mammalian cells at the post translational level and how these mechanisms are hijacked by a pathogen.
