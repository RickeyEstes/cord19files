Malnutrition affects millions of children in developing countries, compromising immunity and contributing to increased rates of death from infectious diseases. Rotavirus is a major etiological agent of childhood diarrhea in developing countries, where malnutrition is prevalent. However, the interactions between the two and their combined effects on immune and intestinal functions are poorly understood. In this study, we used neonatal gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs transplanted with the fecal microbiota of a healthy 2-month-old infant (HIFM) and fed protein-deficient or -sufficient bovine milk diets. Protein deficiency induced hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypoglycemia, stunting, and generalized edema in Gn pigs, as observed in protein-malnourished children. Irrespective of the diet, human rotavirus (HRV) infection early, at HIFM posttransplantation day 3 (PTD3), resulted in adverse health effects and higher mortality rates (45 to 75%) than later HRV infection (PTD10). Protein malnutrition exacerbated HRV infection and affected the morphology and function of the small intestinal epithelial barrier. In pigs infected with HRV at PTD10, there was a uniform decrease in the function and/or frequencies of natural killer cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and CD103 ϩ and apoptotic mononuclear cells and altered gene expression profiles of intestinal epithelial cells (chromogranin A, mucin 2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, SRY-Box 9, and villin). Thus, we have established the first HIFM-transplanted neonatal pig model that recapitulates major aspects of protein malnutrition in children and can be used to evaluate physiologically relevant interventions. Our findings provide an explanation of why nutrient-rich diets alone may lack efficacy in malnourished children. IMPORTANCE Malnutrition and rotavirus infection, prevalent in developing countries, individually and in combination, affect the health of millions of children, compromising their immunity and increasing the rates of death from infectious diseases. However, the interactions between the two and their combined effects on immune and intestinal functions are poorly understood. We have established the first human infant microbiota-transplanted neonatal pig model of childhood malnutrition that reproduced the impaired immune, intestinal, and other physiological functions seen in malnourished children. This model can be used to evaluate relevant dietary and other health-promoting interventions. Our findings provide an explanation of why adequate nutrition alone may lack efficacy in malnourished children. Volume 2 Issue 2 e00046-17 msphere.asm.org 1 Cytokine ELISA. The levels of the cytokines porcine alpha interferon, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-12, and IL-10 in the collected supernatants were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with anti-swine cytokine antibodies as previously described (55, 64) . Statistical analysis. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA-general linear model), followed by Bonferroni's posttest, was used to compare fecal consistency scores, log-transformed HRV shedding titers, normalized weights, mean levels of the cytokine IL-12, and NK cell activity. The frequencies of cell populations in flow cytometry and serum glucose, protein, albumin, LPS, vitamin A ands E, and selenium levels were compared among groups with the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum and Mann-Whitney (nonparametric) tests. The chi-square/Fisher exact or t test (if the mortality rate was 0 in one of the groups) was used to compare the mortality rates of different groups. Statistical significance was assessed at P Յ 0.05 for all comparisons. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA).
