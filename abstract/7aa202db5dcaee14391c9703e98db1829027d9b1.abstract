The equilibrium unfolding pathway of a 41-nucleotide frameshifting RNA pseudoknot from the gag-pro junction of mouse intracisternal Atype particles (mIAP), an endogenous retrovirus, has been determined through analysis of dual optical wavelength, equilibrium thermal melting pro®les and differential scanning calorimetry. The mIAP pseudoknot is an H-type pseudoknot proposed to have structural features in common with the gag-pro frameshifting pseudoknots from simian retrovirus-1 (SRV-1) and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). In particular, the mIAP pseudoknot is proposed to contain an unpaired adenosine base at the junction of the two helical stems (A15), as well as one in the middle of stem 2 (A35). A mutational analysis of stem 1 hairpins and compensatory base-pair substitutions incorporated into helical stem 2 was used to assign optical melting transitions to molecular unfolding events. The optical melting pro®le of the wild-type RNA is most simply described by four sequential two-state unfolding transitions. Stem 2 melts ®rst in two closely coupled low-enthalpy transitions at low t m in which the stem 3 H to A35, unfolds ®rst, followed by unfolding of the remainder of the helical stem. The third unfolding transition is associated with some type of stacking interactions in the stem 1 hairpin loop not present in the pseudoknot. The fourth transition is assigned to unfolding of stem 1. In all RNAs investigated, ÁH vH % ÁH cal , suggesting that ÁC p for unfolding is small. A35 has the thermodynamic properties expected for an extrahelical, unpaired nucleotide. Deletion of A15 destabilizes the stem 2 unfolding transition in the context of both the wild-type and ÁA35 mutant RNAs only slightly, by ÁÁG % 1 kcal mol À1 (at 37 C). The ÁA15 RNA is considerably more susceptible to thermal denaturation in the presence of moderate urea concentrations than is the wild-type RNA, further evidence of a detectable global destabilization of the molecule. Interestingly, substitution of the nine loop 2 nucleotides with uridine residues induces a more pronounced destabilization of the molecule (ÁÁG % 2.0 kcal mol À1 ), a long-range, non-nearest neighbor effect. These ®ndings provide the thermodynamic basis with which to further re®ne the relationship between ef®cient ribosomal frameshifting and pseudoknot structure and stability.
