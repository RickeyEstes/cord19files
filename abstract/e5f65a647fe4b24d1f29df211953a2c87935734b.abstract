Human sera were examined by immuno-blotting for antibodies to the reverse transcriptase of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) believed to be encoded in the P open reading frame (P-ORF). Sera from patients with self-limited (n = 58), acute (n = 23), and chronic (n = 8) hepatitis were analysed. One of the sera with markers of a prior infection and two sera of chronically infected patients reacted with a protein synthesized in E. coli that contains the middle part of the predicted polymerase. Other E. coli fusion proteins containing overlapping or different regions of P-ORF were used to localize antigenic domains. Antibody binding to two different domains representing the middle and the C-terminal region of P-ORF was obtained in the sera of chronically infected patients. Our findings are indirect evidence for the in vivo expression of the complete HBV polymerase reading frame.
