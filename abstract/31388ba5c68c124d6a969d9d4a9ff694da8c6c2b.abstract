One infected staff member had no exposure to any admitted patient with SARS and was classified as a communityacquired infection. All index patients and infected staff in the study, except for one, showed a four-fold rise in the number of antibodies to corona-like virus. 356 completed questionnaires were returned, covering 85% of the staff on roster. Non-responders were mostly those on leave or night shift, which is rotated among the staff. We excluded 102 staff who had no contact with index patients. Most of the infected staff were from the medical wards (table 1) , and omitted at least one of the four measures queried. Two who were using a mask reported only paper masks. Staff who used masks, gowns, and handwashing were less likely to develop SARS than those who did not use them, but the association for gloves was not significant (table 2) . None of the 69 staff reporting use of all four measures became infected. By contrast, all 13 infected staff had omitted at least one of the measures (p=0·0224). However logistic regression of the four measures with forward stepwise selection showed that only use of masks was significant in the final model (table 2) . The staff who wore surgical masks and N95 masks were significantly associated with non-infection (table 2), but this was not seen for paper masks. That use of masks and hand-washing was associated with non-infection, and that no staff became infected when they used all four measures, suggest that precautions against droplets and contact are adequate for prevention of nosocomial SARS, where no aerosolisations are expected. The surgical and N95 masks were both effective in significantly reducing the risk of infection, which together with the finding that 30% of non-infected staff did not use masks (table 2) supports that transmission is not airborne. The finding that paper masks did not significantly reduce the risk is not unexpected. Such masks, being easily wet with saliva, are never recommended as a precaution against droplets. 3 In any survey, recall bias is a concern. However, it probably had little effect since the associations shown are clear and the information requested was about simple concrete behaviour and events that took place recently. Masks seem to be essential for protection, since only this measure was significant in stepwise logistic regression. Thus, in hospital, the other three measures add no significant protection to the mask. This finding fits well with droplets transmission because droplets are generated at the face level making the mask crucial for protection. A 33-year-old doctor contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome presenting with features of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy without changes in the chest radiograph initially. A CT scan of his chest showed marked lung changes. His condition improved with intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg daily and ribavirin 1·2 g orally thrice daily. The case illustrates the importance of a break in fever between the viraemic and lung inflammatory phases of the illness that
