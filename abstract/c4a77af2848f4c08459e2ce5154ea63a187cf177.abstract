case of RIG-I also called the 'repressor domain' (RD)], which are both required for RNA binding. Although they recognize different ligands, RIG-I and MDA5 interact with a common adaptor protein, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) (also known as IPS-1, CARDIF, or VISA) which serves as a scaffold for protein complex assembly at the mitochondria and mitochondriaassociated membranes (MAMs) to trigger an antiviral program [6] . It has been demonstrated that the interaction of RIG-I with the chaperone protein 14-3-3e mediates RIG-I translocation from the cytosol to mitochondria and MAMs to initiate signaling [7] . MAVS then recruits the IKK-related serine/threonine kinases TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKKe, which phosphorylate and activate IRF3 or IRF7. Furthermore, the tripartite IKK/-IKKb-IKKg complex is activated by MAVS, ultimately resulting in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) activation. NF-kB and IRFs then translocate into the nucleus and cooperatively induce the gene expression of type I IFNs (IFN/ subtypes and IFNb), proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor superfamily proteins and interleukins) and chemokines, for the initiation of the antiviral response.
