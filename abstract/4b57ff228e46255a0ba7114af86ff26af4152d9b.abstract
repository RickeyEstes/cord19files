in host-pathogen interactions. CASD1 has been described as a sialate-Oacetyltransferase and has been shown to be essential for 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid in some cell lines in vitro. In this study, we used knockout mice to confirm that CASD1 is indeed responsible for 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids in vivo. We observed a complete loss of 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on the surface of myeloid, erythroid and CD4 + T cells in Casd1-deficient mice. Although 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on multiple hematopoietic lineages was lost, there were no obvious defects in hematopoiesis. Interestingly, red blood cells from Casd1-deficient mice also lost reactivity to TER-119, a rat monoclonal antibody that is widely used to mark the murine erythroid lineage. The sialic acid glyco-epitope recognized by TER-119 on red blood cells was sensitive to the sialic acid O-acetyl esterase activity of the hemagglutinin esterase from bovine coronavirus but not to the corresponding enzyme from the influenza C virus. During erythrocyte development TER-119 + Ery-A and Ery-B cells could be stained by catalytically inactive bovine coronavirus hemaggutinin-esterase but not by the inactive influenza C hemagglutinin esterase, while TER-119 + Ery-C stage cells and mature erythrocytes were recognized by both virolectins. These results suggest that throughout murine erythrocyte development, cells of the erythroid lineage express a glycoconjugate bearing a modified 7,9-di-O-acetyl form of sialic acid, that is recognized specifically by the bovine coronavirus lectin and not by the influenza C hemagglutinin, and this modified sialic acid moiety is a component of the TER-119 epitope. As erythrocytes mature, the surface of Ery-C cells and mature erythrocytes also acquires a distinct CASD1dependent 9-O-acetyl sialic acid moiety that can be recognized by virolectins from both influenza C and bovine coronavirus that are specific for 9-O-acetyl sialic acid. esterases from Influenza C and bovine coronavirus, we demonstrate that the murine erythroid lineage-specific epitope recognized by the TER-119 monoclonal antibody is comprised of a 7,9-di-O-acetyl sialic acid glycoform that is completely lost in Casd1deficient mice. The 7,9-di-O-acetyl sialic acid glycoform can be detected early in erythroid differentiation from the Ery-A and Ery-B stages onward. We also observed that a distinct 9-O-acetyl sialic acid moiety also decorates cells of the erythroid lineage from the Ery C stage onward including in mature red blood cells. RESULTS Prior in vitro studies have suggested that CASD1 is a sialic acid 9-O-acetyl transferase. To assess the function of 9-O-acetyl sialic acids in vivo, we generated Casd1-deficient mice (Fig 1A) . The influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase (CHE) that is known to be specific for 9-O-acetyl sialic acid was expressed as an Fc-fusion protein (CHE-Fc) (Muchmore and Varki, 1987). Inactivation of the esterase domain of CHE-Fc with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) yields CHE-FcD which has been widely used as a specific probe of 9-O-acetyl sialic acid (Klein et al., 1994) . Using the CHE-FcD reagent, we evaluated the effect of Casd1 deficiency on sialic acid 9-O-acetylation in all hematopoietic lineages, focusing our analysis on the spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes. Wild-type myeloid cells expressing CD11b exhibit robust levels of 9-O-acetyl sialic acid, but this carbohydrate modification was completely lost in splenic CD11b + myeloid cells from Casd1-deficient mice (Fig 1B) . CD11b + cells in the bone marrow also express high levels of the mucin-like glycoprotein CD43, suggesting that much of the 9-.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/469254 doi: bioRxiv preprint Mouse embryonic stem cells (C57/BL6N background) carrying a knockout-first targeted allele of Casd1 (Casd1 tm1a(EUCOMM)Hmgu ) were obtained from the EUCOMM consortium. Casd1 knock-in mice were generated at the BWH Transgenic Core facility. The resulting chimeric mice were crossed into C57BL/6NTac (Taconic) and interbred to homozygosity. They were then crossed into (B6.C-Tg(CMV-cre)1Cgn/J mice, (stock # 006054, Jackson Laboratory) to obtain the Casd1 tm1b null allele, which lacks exon 2 of Casd1. Excision of the neomycin expression cassette (Fig 1A) was confirmed by PCR. The following primers were used for genotyping. The wild-type allele was specifically amplified using TCCTCCCTCACTGTTCCTTC and AGGTGGGGAGGAAAGACAGT (291bp) and the Casd1 tm1b allele could be selectively amplified using TCCTCCCTCACTGTTCCTTC and GACAGCCAGTCACACAGCTT (5540bp). This allele was interbred to homozygosity to yield Casd1 tm1b/tm1b mice (referred to as Casd1-KO mice in the accompanying figures). The Casd1-deficient mice were viable and fertile. The Casd1 knockout colony was maintained by homozygous mating. Each experiment was performed at least twice on three mice each. Single cell suspensions were obtained from the blood, spleen, lymph nodes, thymus or bone marrow and flow cytometry analysis was performed using the following monoclonal (7G6) and CD16/CD32 (2.4G2).

One representative flow cytometry plot is shown for each condition. Influenza C hemagglutinin esterase (CHE) was recombinantly expressed as an Fcfusion protein and the esterase activity of CHE was inactivated with di-isofluoropropyl phosphate to generate the CHE-FcD reagent as previously described (Muchmore and Varki, 1987). Bovine coronavirus hemagglutinin esterase (Mebus strain, Uniprot accession number, P15776.1) was cloned into the pFUSE-mFc2a vector (Invivogen) into the EcoRI and BglII sites. A catalytically dead variant of BHE-Fc (BHE-S40A-Fc) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The Fc-fusion proteins were expressed in 293T cells and affinity purified using protein G. The CHE-FcD probe recognizes 9-O-acetyl sialic acids, and the BHE-S40A-Fc virolectin can bind both 9-O-acetyl and 7,9-di-Oacetyl sialic acids (Langereis et al., 2015; Bakkers et al., 2016). Briefly, a two-step staining procedure with CHE-FcD as the primary and anti-human IgG1-PE (clone HP6017) as the secondary or with BHE-S40A-Fc as the primary and anti-mouse IgG2a-FITC (clone RMG2a-62) as the secondary antibody were used. To assess the effect of CHE or BHE on 9-O-acetyl sialic acids on murine erythrocytes, a 1:100 dilution of whole blood in PBS, was treated with 10μg/mL of CHE-Fc or BHE-Fc at 37°C for 1 hour. The cells were washed twice with PBS at room temperature and stained with CHE-FcD as described above. Analysis of competitive binding between TER-119 and BHE-S40A-Fc was performed as follows. A 1:100 dilution of whole blood in PBS was incubated with varying concentrations of BHE-S40A-Fc at 37°C for one hour followed by the addition of 2 µg/mL of labeled TER-119 antibody for 10 minutes in the .
