Exotic animals, including small herbivores, are increasing in popularity as companion animals. Commonly owned exotic herbivores include guinea pigs, chinchillas, and rabbits. These animals fall into the category of prey species with an inherent instinct to hide their illness until severely affected by the disease process. Therefore, any of these animals presented as an emergency case must be carefully evaluated for chronic underlying illness. Cardiovascular emergency and critical care principles are similar across all mammalian species. However, specialized techniques and adaptations are occasionally required because of the unique physiology and natural behaviors of these animals. It is essential to evaluate and stabilize these patients before attempting definitive diagnostic plans. Emergency cardiovascular presentations, as in other mammals, consist of congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, pericardial effusion, and toxicities that can result in cardiac and pulmonary arrest. Cardiac disease is a relatively common finding in small exotic mammals, but there are few peer-reviewed reports regarding diagnosis and treatment of heart disease in these species. Diagnostic testing and treatment options are generally based on knowledge of small animal medicine. A ssessing the cardiovascular system of small exotic mammalian patients (e.g., rabbits, guinea pigs) can be a challenge. A visual examination should always be performed before handling the animal to evaluate the character and resting respiratory rate, as well as overall demeanor of the patient. A systematic cardiovascular examination should include the evaluation of mucous membranes for color, hydration, and capillary refill time, as well as thoracic and cardiac auscultation. The rabbit central ear artery and femoral artery of guinea pigs and chinchillas can be used to gauge the strength and regularity of peripheral arterial pulses.
