Multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, is characterized by primary destruction of myelin. This review covers recent advances in neuropathology, immunogenetics, neuroimmunology, and neurovirology that have provided insights regard ing its pathogenesis. Three hypotheses are discussed: (1) autoimmunity, (2) "bystander" demyelination, and (3) immune destruction of persistently infected oligodendrocytes. A paradigm for induction of primary demyelination is proposed in which immune cells recognize "foreign" antigens on the surface of oligodendrocytes in the context of major histocompatibility complex gene products. The final result of this scheme may be "dying-back gliopathy," the alteration being noted first in the most distal extension of the oligodendrocyte-that is, the myelin sheaths. Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects scattered areas of the central nervous system with a predilection for periventricular white matter, brainstem, spinal cord, and optic nerves. 1 The plaques are characterized by primary demyelination (destruction of myelin sheaths with preservation of axons) and death of oligodendro cytes (myelin-producing cells) within the center of the lesion. During the early evolution of the plaque, perivascular inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages) invade the substance of the white matter and are thought to play a critical role in myelin destruction.
