Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), an infectious coronavirus first reported in 2012, has a mortality rate greater than 35%. Therapeutic antibodies are key tools for preventing and treating MERS-CoV infection, but to date no such agents have been approved for treatment of this virus. Nanobodies (Nbs) are camelid heavy chain variable domains with properties distinct from those of conventional antibodies and antibody fragments. We generated two oligomeric Nbs by linking two or three monomeric Nbs (Mono-Nbs) targeting the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD), and compared their RBD-binding affinity, RBD-receptor binding inhibition, stability, and neutralizing and cross-neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV. Relative to Mono-Nb, dimeric Nb (Di-Nb) and trimeric Nb (Tri-Nb) had significantly greater ability to bind MERS-CoV RBD proteins with or without mutations in the RBD, thereby potently blocking RBD-MERS-CoV receptor binding. The engineered oligomeric Nbs were very stable under extreme conditions, including low or high pH, protease (pepsin), chaotropic denaturant (urea), and high temperature. Importantly, Di-Nb and Tri-Nb exerted significantly elevated broad-spectrum neutralizing activity against at least 19 human and camel MERS-CoV strains isolated in different countries and years. Overall, the engineered Nbs could be developed into effective therapeutic agents for prevention and treatment of MERS-CoV infection. (>35%) (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). This situation calls for a consistent effort to develop effective countermeasures, including therapeutic antibodies and vaccines, to prevent and treat MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV spike (S) protein, an enveloped glycoprotein, plays a key role in viral infection, viral attachment, and viral entry [14, 15] . It is composed of S1 and S2 subunits: the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit mediates MERS-CoV binding to its cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and the S2 subunit subsequently mediates viral and cell membrane fusion, leading to viral entry into target cells [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The RBD of MERS-CoV S protein contains a critical neutralizing domain fragment capable of inducing strong neutralizing antibodies, and it is therefore considered to be an important therapeutic and vaccine target [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed to prevent and treat MERS-CoV infection, and most of these agents are based on the RBD [26-31]. However, conventional IgG mAbs and antibody fragments often have complex structures and unstable behavior [32] [33] [34] . Consequently, anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic antibodies with strong stability and simplified structures would be clinically valuable. Camelid heavy chain variable domains (VHHs), also termed nanobodies (Nbs), are derived from the variable domains of the camelid heavy chain-only antibodies (HcAbs). These antibodies have distinctive properties, including high binding affinity, strong specificity for target antigens, good tissue penetration, and intrinsic stability under harsh conditions, such as extreme pH values, proteases, chemicals, and high temperature. Accordingly, they represent promising therapeutic tools for the treatment of human diseases [35] [36] [37] . Moreover, because Nbs do not require paired light and heavy chain domains to maintain antigen-binding activity, they can be easily modified by protein engineering techniques without loss of functionality [38] . Several monomeric Nbs can be readily fused to form multivalent or multispecific constructs, thereby improving their binding affinity and functionality. For example, monomeric proteins have been engineered into dimeric or trimeric proteins [38, 39] . Also, multidomain Nbs have been generated by linking different Nbs targeting influenza virus hemagglutinin protein; the resultant agents have greater breadth, avidity, potency, and cross-neutralizing activity against divergent influenza viruses than the parent molecules [40] , demonstrating the feasibility of engineering Nbs targeting multiple epitopes to increase their activity. It is therefore worthwhile to attempt to generate multidomain Nbs with improved activity against other emerging and re-emerging infectious viruses. Previously, by immunizing llamas with a recombinant MERS-CoV RBD protein, we generated a monomeric Nb (Mono-Nb, NbMS10) that targets the RBD of . In this study, we constructed two oligomeric Nbs, including dimeric Nb (Di-Nb) and trimeric Nb (Tri-Nb), and compared them to the Mono-Nb in terms of their ability to bind RBD proteins, inhibit RBD-DPP4 receptor binding, and cross-neutralize MERS-CoV infection. In addition, to demonstrate the advantages of the oligomeric Nbs relative to conventional antibodies, we evaluated the stability of these Nbs under the extreme conditions mentioned above. Overall, our data show that the engineered oligomeric Nbs have been significantly improved from the standpoint of binding affinity to the RBD, inhibition of the RBD-DPP4 binding, and cross-neutralizing activity against divergent strains of MERS-CoV. They also maintained greater pH, protease, chemical, and thermal stability than their mAb counterparts. Materials and Methods Dimeric and trimeric Nbs specific for MERS-CoV RBD were constructed by linking two or three monomeric Nb (Mono-Nb: NbMS10) [41] with a GGGGS linker and a C-terminal His 6 tag followed by insertion into the Pichia pastoris yeast secretory expression vector pPICZÎ±A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The recombinant Nbs were expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 cells and purified using Ni-NTA columns (GE Healthcare, Cincinnati, OH, USA).
