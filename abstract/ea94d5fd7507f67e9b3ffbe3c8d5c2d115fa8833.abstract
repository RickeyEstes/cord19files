Dear Editor , We note with interest recent reports on the problems of diagnosing central nervous system (CNS) infections, 1 particularly the study comparing the presence of varicella zoster virus (VZV) DNA in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with VZV-related neurological symptoms. 2 Here we report a case of chronic-relapsing VZV meningitis, where the episodes occurred with frequent and debilitating regularity. A 62-year-old man, who worked as a General Practitioner at an asylum centre, presented with a 2-year history of headache, fatigue, diffuse myalgia, a low-grade fever, night sweats and mood disturbances. His symptoms waxed and waned every 1-3 weeks, without ever fully resolving, but never included seizures or focal neurological symptoms. He had lost 9 kg during this period. His work routinely exposed him to patients with various exotic and chronic infections, including a varicella outbreak 2 years previously. General physical examination was unremarkable, apart from some limb myalgia. Specifically, neither neck stiffness nor any other focal neurological signs were detected. Other investigations (chest X-ray, echocardiography, abdominal ultrasound) were all normal. An MRI-brain showed some non-specific lesions in the deep white matter, compatible with Virchow-Robin spaces. Full blood counts with differentiation, f erritin, lipid profile, thyroid stimulating hormone, CA19-9, liver function, serum glucose, urea and electrolytes and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were all normal, apart from a mild non-specific anaemia. Serological testing for HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Brucella, Borrelia, Yersinia, Toxoplasma , and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were either negative or just indicated past infection. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed a slightly raised total protein (0.66 g/L) and a low glucose (1.9 mmol/L) with a glucose ratio of 0.44. No erythrocytes were seen, but 95 Ã— 10 6 /L leucocytes were observed (primarily lymphocytes and monocytes). Polymerase chain reaction testing for CSF HSV and VZV was negative. Further CSF investigations using immuno-blotting showed intense IgG bands in the CSF, with fewer, weaker bands in a contemporaneous serum sample ( Fig. 1 ) : CSF intrathecal VZV IgG titre was 2500, with a VZV-IgG index of 98.52, indicating intrathecal VZV-IgG synthesis. A diagnosis of chronic-relapsing VZV meningitis was made, and a 2-week course of intravenous acyclovir (10 0 0 mg TD) was given. The patient improved on treatment, but the meningitis symptoms recurred every 2 weeks once treatment had stopped. Further, repeated CSF examinations, during symptomatic and asymptomatic periods, showed similar profiles to the above. Con-
