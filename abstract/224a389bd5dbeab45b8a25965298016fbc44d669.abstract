Primary human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) cultures represent a universal platform to 20 propagate respiratory viruses and characterize their host interactions in authentic target cells. To 21 further elucidate specific interactions between human respiratory viruses and important host factors 22 in airway epithelium, it is important to make hAEC cultures amenable to genetic modification. 23 However, the short and finite lifespan of primary cells in cell culture creates a bottleneck for the 24 genetic modification of these cultures. In the current study, we show that the incorporation of the 25 Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (Y-27632) during cell propagation extends the life 26 span of primary human cells in vitro and thereby facilitates the incorporation of lentivirus-based 27 expression systems. Using fluorescent reporters for FACS-based sorting, we generated 28 homogenously fluorescent hAEC cultures that differentiate normally after lentiviral transduction. As 29 proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that host gene expression can be modulated post-differentiation 30 via inducible short hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated knockdown. Importantly, functional characterization of 31 these transgenic hAEC cultures with exogenous poly(I:C), as a proxy for virus infection, 32 demonstrates that such modifications do not influence the host innate immune response. Moreover, 33 the propagation kinetics of both human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human respiratory 34 syncytial virus (RSV) were not affected. Combined, these results validate our newly established 35 protocol for the genetic modification of hAEC cultures thereby unlocking a unique potential for 36 detailed molecular characterization of virus -host interactions in human respiratory epithelium. 37
