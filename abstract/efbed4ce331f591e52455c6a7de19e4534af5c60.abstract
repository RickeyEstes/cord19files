KEYWORDS Pediatric Neonate Fluid therapy Crystalloids Colloids Blood transfusion Neonatal isoerythrolysis Intraosseous Pediatric patients have a higher fluid requirement compared with adults because of increased extracellular fluid, decreased renal ability to conserve water, a larger surface area/body weight ratio, and larger fluid losses through skin. In pediatric patients less than 6 weeks of age, hydration and volume status are difficult to assess. Fluids should be warmed to near body temperature (37 C/98.6 F) before administration to the pediatric patient, and should be kept warm even in fluid lines. Multiple routes of administration of fluid therapy are used in the neonate or pediatric patient including oral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intraosseous, and intravenous. Clinicians should be aware of the limitations or potential complications of each route of delivery.
