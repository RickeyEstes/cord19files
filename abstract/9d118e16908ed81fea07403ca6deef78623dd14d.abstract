Abdominal auscultation is particularly useful for assessing the motility of the large intestine. Progressive motility of the small intestine, conversely, is difficult to distinguish by auscultation from nonprogressive motility. The distinct character of the borborygmi produced during propulsive contractions of the cecum and ascending colon allow evaluation of the frequency and strength of retropulsion and propulsion. Propulsive contractions of the cecum and ventral colon occur every 3 to 4 minutes and give rise to prolonged rushing sounds heard over long segments of intestine. Retropulsive sounds presumably are similar to propulsive sounds, but they occur less frequently. The distinction of propulsion from retropulsion is not important clinically because both types of contractions signify normal motility. Inter-and intrahaustral mixing contractions produce nonspecific sounds of fluid and ingesta movement that are difficult to distinguish from other borborygmi, such as small intestinal contractions or spasmodic contractions. 1 Auscultation over the right flank and proceeding along the caudal edge of the costal margin toward the xiphoid allows evaluation of the cecal borborygmi. Auscultation over a similar area on the left side allows evaluation of the pelvic flexure and ascending colon. Typical progressive borborygmi heard every 3 to 4 minutes on both sides of the abdomen indicate normal motility of the cecum and ascending colon. Less frequent progressive sounds may indicate a pathologic condition of the large intestine or may result from anorexia, nervousness (sympathetic tone), or pharmacologic inhibition of C H A P T E R 13
