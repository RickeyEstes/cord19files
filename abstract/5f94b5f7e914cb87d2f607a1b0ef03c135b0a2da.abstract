Background: The regulatory IL-10 and TGF-$1 cytokine gene polymorphisms have been associated with allergic diseases in different populations, like Caucasian, Chinese and Indians. However, no associations between IL-10 and TGF-$1 gene polymorphisms and food allergy (FA) in Japanese children have been evaluated so far. To clarify the relationship of polymorphisms of these 2 regulatory cytokine genes with FA, not atopy itself, polymorphisms IL-10 AV1082G, CV819T and TGF-$1 T+869C, G+915C, CV509T in FA patients were compared with those in non-FA atopic controls. Methods: One hundred-eleven childhood FA patients, with a mean 7.6T4.0 years of age and 115 atopic control children without FA (mean = 8.2T1.5 years of age) were recruited. Most of FA patients and atopic controls were sensitized with house dust mite (92% and 93%, respectively). DNA samples from these subjects were genotyped by using Real Time PCR. Results: The odds ratio (OR) of IL-10 V1082 AA genotype was 2.5 (95%CI, 1.0Y6.4) for food allergy risk when compared with atopic control subjects (p = 0.03). This study had a power of 80% to achieve significance at the 0.05 level for IL-10 V1082A allele when OR is greater than 2.3. Our OR value was 2.4; therefore, we consider this association had enough statistical power to support our finding. There were no significative differences in the frequency of IL-10 CV819T and TGF-$1 gene polymorphisms between both groups. Conclusion: This result indicates that IL-10 AV1082G gene polymorphism is associated with food allergy susceptibility in atopic Japanese children. Our findings should encourage further studies to elucidate the functional relationship of IL-10 AV1082G gene polymorphism in FA pathogenesis. 2 Abstract withdrawn 3 Safety assessment of bacterial choline oxidase protein introduced in transgenic crops Background: Previously, transgenic Brassica juncea expressing bacterial choline oxidase protein did not show enhanced allergenicity as evaluated by WHO/FAO guidelines. In the present study, choline oxidase protein derived from Arthrobacter globiformis was assessed for allergenicity and toxicity.
