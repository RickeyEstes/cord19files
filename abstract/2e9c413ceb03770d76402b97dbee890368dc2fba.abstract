Intestinal surgery in cattle is challenging because it is often done with the animal standing under sedation. Because of the abdominal pain and state of shock, affected animals will be prone to move constantly or even lay down. Moreover, it is technically demanding and can rarely be performed without assistance, unlike most common surgeries in cattle. Decision-making is crucial and appropriate technical technique is essential to improve success rate. Doing an exploratory laparotomy in cattle is easy, fast, and inexpensive. There are less consequences if revealed to be unnecessary compared to other species. However, an unnecessary laparotomy could be harmful to a critical patient that could have been medically treated. Before making the decision to favor a surgical or medical approach, information must be gathered and the case approached in a logical manner: (1) review the possible causes of abdominal pain relevant to the particular case; (2) recognize the indications for immediate surgery; (3) determine if surgery is an option given the cost, facilities, and surgical abilities; (4) establish medical treatment before or during surgery; (5) if surgery is postponed, determine in advance a precise time and list criteria to be monitored to help decision-making; and (6) establish and present to The authors have nothing to disclose. KEYWORDS Cattle Surgery Intestine Jejunum Colon Enterectomy The short mesentery in cattle makes intestinal exteriorization challenging. Duodenal sigmoid flexure volvulus is suspected if there is extreme hypochloremic alkalosis. Cattle with jejunal hemorrhage syndrome (JHS) have a poor prognosis. Intraoperative clot fragmentation should be favored with JHS rather than enterectomy. The prognosis is better for animals with ileal flange volvulus rather than mesentery root torsion.
