the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were < 10 % of plasma levels. After oral administration AM concentrations were considerably lower than after i.m. administration. The concentration ofDHA was high on day 1 but almost nil on day 7 indicating its fast inactivation in dogs. Two hours after the 8 th oral administration neither AM nor DHA was detected in CSF which may explain the absence of neurotoxicity in dogs after oral administration of AM.
