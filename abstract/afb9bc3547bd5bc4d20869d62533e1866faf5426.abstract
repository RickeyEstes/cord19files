The hydrophilic carboxyterminal 199 amino acids encoded by the ORF 3 of a European (Lelystad) isolate of PRRSV were expressed as a recombinant fusion protein (BPO3-P) in a baculovirus gene expression system. Sera from gnotobiotic swine exposed to prototypic reference European and American isolates of PRRSV and sera from conventionally reared European and American swine convalescing from naturally acquired PRRSV infections were used to characterize the BPO3-P protein. Sera from gnotobiotic and conventionally reared swine exposed to European isolates of PRRSV were significantly more reactive (P < 0.01) with BPO3-P than were the corresponding American PRRSV antisera using the indirect irmuunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) . Prototypic European, but not American, PRRSV antisera also recognized BPO3-P using western immunoblotting and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) procedures. However, gnotobiotically derived antiserum to an atypical American-origin PRRSV was reactive with BPO3-P by both IPMA and western immunoblot.
