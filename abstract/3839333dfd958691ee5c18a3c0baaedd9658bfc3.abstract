ATPase activity was studied in a plasma membrane rich fraction isolated from control and poliovirus infected He La cells and compared to membrane potential and amino acid uptake in parallel cultures of intact cells. Na + , K + -AT Pase activity in membranes from infected HeLa cells increased relative to control with a maximum at 90 minutes post infection (+ 30 %) and decreased again (180 rnin.: -30 %). Similar but slighter changes were observed in the membrane potential dependent tetraphenylphosphonium (T PP+ ) uptake, indicating a correlation between membrane porential in intact cells and our measurment of plasma membrane Na + , K +-AT Pase. At approximately 1 h post infection we observed a decrease in the uptake of amino acid (methionine, leucine) in infected cells relative to controls. These results suggest that the decline in amino acid upt ake is not mediated by virus-induced changes in the Na + , K + -ATPase activity or membrane potential. MPI f. Biochemic, Abt. Virologic, D-8033 Martinsried Sequence Homology in Different Strains of FMDV and other Picoma Viruses MARQUARDT, O. Restriction enzyme generated subgenomic fragments of cloned cDNA prepared from RNA of the strain 01K of FMDV were compared quantitatively for sequence complementarity with radioactive RNA from strains CObb and A2S or with RNA from mengo or polio virus in hybridization experiments by use of the Southern technique. Nucleic acid sequences neighbouring or including the 3' end of viral genomes are demonstrated to be 80 Ofo homologous in FMDV. In contrast, sequences coding for the capsid proteins VPl and VP3 were remarkably heterologous (less than 20010) in FMDV. Sequences coding for non-structural proteins showed 35-50010 homology. Thus no highly conserved coding sequence was detectable in FMDV by this technique. No hybridization could .be detected between 01K specific DNA and polio RNA, while weak hybridization was observed with mengo RNA at areas including the 3' end and with a part of the gene for precursor protein P52.
