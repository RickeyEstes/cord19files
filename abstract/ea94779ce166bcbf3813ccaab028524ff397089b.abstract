Linear plasmids with almost identical compact genetic organization have been found in the cytoplasm of yeast species from nine genera. We employed pGKL1,2 plasmids from Kluyveromyces lactis as a model to investigate the previously unstudied transcriptome of yeast cytoplasmic linear plasmids. We performed 5' and 3' RACE analysis of all the pGKL1,2 mRNAs and found them not 3' polyadenylated and containing mostly uncapped 5' poly(A) leaders that are not complementary to the plasmid DNA. The degree of 5' capping and/or 5' polyadenylation is specific to each gene and is controlled by the corresponding promoter regions. We refined the description of the pGKL1,2 promoters and found new alternative promoters of several genes. We also provide evidence that K2ORF3 encodes an mRNA cap guanine-N 7 -methyltransferase and that 5' capped pGKL1,2 transcripts contain N 7 -methylated caps. Translation of pGKL1,2 transcripts is enhanced in lsm1Δ and pab1Δ strains and is independent of eIF4E and Pab1 translation factors. We suggested a model of a primitive regulation of pGKL1,2 plasmids gene expression where degree of 5' mRNA capping, degree of 5' non-template polyadenylation and presence of negative regulators as PAB1 and Lsm1 play an important role. Our data also suggest a close relationship between linear plasmids and poxviruses. doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 synthesized in a template-independent manner. We show that plasmid promoters directly determine the formation of the mRNA 5' end leaders and their capping, pointing to a possible role of the plasmid RNA polymerase in this unusual phenomenon. We also provide the first evidence that MTase is an essential part of the K2Orf3p enzyme and that capped pGKL mRNAs are methylated at the N 7 position of the terminal guanosine moiety. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that translation of plasmid-specific mRNAs is independent of major cellular cap-binding proteins, translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and the Pab1 and Lsm1 proteins that were speculated to be possible translational enhancers and/or stabilizers of cellular and viral mRNAs bearing 5' poly(A) stretches (38,39). Our results thus suggest the existence of a novel translation initiation mechanism. Materials and Methods K. lactis IFO1267 was transformed with a PCR-generated fragment consisting of 5' and 3' ends homologous to the part of the pGKL plasmid to be modified, a non-homologous part that introduces mutation/s into a plasmid-specific protein coding sequence, and a gene encoding a resistance marker (typically against G418 or hygromycin B) whose transcription is driven by the UCR of K1ORF1 or K1ORF2. This type of construct was prepared by fusion PCR; for the organization of such a construct, see Fig. 2A . After transformation, yeast cells were plated onto selective agar media, and their DNA content was analyzed for the presence of the modified pGKL plasmid using agarose electrophoresis. Both modified and wild-type target plasmids were usually detected after transformation. Colonies containing both the modified and wild-type target plasmids were selected and cultivated under selective conditions for approximately 60 generations and analyzed using agarose electrophoresis. For subsequent analysis, only colonies containing a modified version of the target plasmid were used. All constructs were verified using colony PCRs and subsequent sequencing of amplified products.
