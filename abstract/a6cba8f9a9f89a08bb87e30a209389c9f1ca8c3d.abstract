In this paper, ACE2 gene of pigs was cloned and the purified protein was obtained via 12 the prokaryotic expression system. Polyclonal antibody of high titer and sensitivity 13 was obtained using Wastar rats immunization method and is then used to determine of 14 the expression of ACE2 using immunohistochemistry. The sequence of ACE2 in pigs 15 covered 2418 nucleotides and coded 805 amino acid (aa) residues. Sequence 16 homology analysis showed that the ACE2 sequence in pigs is highly conserved 17 among species at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Genetic evolution analysis 18 revealed that ACE2 gene in pigs has the shortest genetic distance with that in goats 19 while residing in a totally different branch from that in zebra fishes. Analysis of 20 protein structure predicted that ACE2 protein is a transmembrane secreted protein 21 with high hydrophilicity, containing a signal peptide sequences locating between 1aa 22 to 17aa. The ACE2 fusion protein expressed (under the induction with 1.0 mmol/L 23 IPTG for 10 h) was of approximately 100 kDa and mainly existed in inclusion body. Wastar rats immunization showed that the titer of the anti-ACE2 antiserum in rats was
