In 2006, paediatric intensive care-related subjects were discussed in a number of papers published in various journals, including Critical Care. Because they focused on the cardiovascular system and its support, we summarize them here. In particular, these papers highlighted the management of refractory septic shock, extracorporeal support, outcome markers in sepsis, and outcome after cardiac arrest. AVP = arginine-vasopressin; BV = biventricular repair; CPB = cardiopulmonary bypass; CPR = cardiopulmonary resuscitation; ECMO = extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; ELBW = extremely low birth weight; LRTI = lower respiratory tract infection; MCP-1 = monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; MD = meningococcal disease; MIP-1Î± = macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha; NE/E = norepinephrine/epinephrine; PIC = paediatric intensive care; PVT = pulseless ventricular tachycardia; ROSC = return to spontaneous circulation; RSV = respiratory syncytial virus; RT-PCR = real-time polymerase chain reaction; TCPC = total cavo-pulmonary connection; TFPI = tissue factor pathway inhibitor; TP = terlipressin; TxB2 = thromboxane B2; VF = ventricular fibrillation.
