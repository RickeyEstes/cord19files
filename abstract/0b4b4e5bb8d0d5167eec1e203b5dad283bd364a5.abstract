ALLAN and MET, by contrast, are more variable and very close to each other and to 107 untreated control (Fig. 2b, Extended data Fig. 4c). 108 109 Drug synergies and lifespan extension 110 We next determine effect of different drug combinations on lifespan in nematodes. We began with 111 MET and RAP due to their translational importance in humans 14,27 . However, RAP combined with 112 MET at their optimal doses did not show any further benefit on lifespan (Extended data Fig. 2j,p). We 113 carried out additional trials, exploring all possible combinations of optimal and half-optimal dose for 114 MET and RAP (Extended data Fig. 2j-p). Combination of RAP and MET each at their half-optimal 115 dose result in further extension in maximum lifespan (Fig. 2e, Extended data Fig. 2m,s) but did not 116 result in further mean lifespan extension (Extended data 2p). These weak benefits of combining MET 117 with RAP are consistent with results in mice where the existing evidence suggests that addition of Figures S3 lifespan comparison of triple combinations supplementary for figure 2. a, RAP+RIF+PSORA did not show further benefit compared to the dual synergistic combinations RAP+RIF and RIF+PSORA. b, RAP+RIF+MET is toxic compared to RAP+RIF. More than 50 worms per condition.. c, RAP+PSORA+ALLAN did not show further benefit compared to single drug constituents. d, RAP+RIF+ALLAN and RIF+PSORA+ALLAN resulted in a significant lifespan extension compared to RAP+RIF and RIF+PSORA respectively. log-rank with proper adjustment. e, Mean and f, Maximum lifespan of figure d showed a monotonic increase from single drugs to double and triple combinations.
