Objectives: A recent update of the definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) proposed an empirical classification based on ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) at ARDS onset. Since the proposal did not mandate PaO 2 /FiO 2 calculation under standardised ventilator settings (SVS), we hypothesised that a stratification based on baseline PaO 2 /FiO 2 would not provide accurate assessment of lung injury severity. Design: A prospective, multicentre, observational study. Setting: A network of teaching hospitals. Participants: 478 patients with eligible criteria for moderate (100<PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤200) and severe (PaO 2 / FiO 2 ≤100) ARDS and followed until hospital discharge. Interventions: We examined physiological and ventilator parameters in association with the PaO 2 /FiO 2 at ARDS onset, after 24 h of usual care and at 24 h under a SVS. At 24 h, patients were reclassified as severe, moderate, mild (200<PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤300) ARDS and non-ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 >300). Primary and secondary outcomes: Group severity and hospital mortality.
