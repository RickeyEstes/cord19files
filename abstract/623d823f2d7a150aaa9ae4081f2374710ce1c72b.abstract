The patient is a 22-year-old man with a history of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) associated with a heterozygous mutation in TNFRSF13B (TACI), granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD), massive splenomegaly, immune thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. He presented with a 5-day history of fever with temperatures up to 38.9 C, malaise, sinus congestion, intermittent headaches, and loose stools. He had no cough, dyspnea, vomiting, abdominal pain, joint pain, or rash. He had been nonadherent with his weekly home dosing of subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy for hypogammaglobulinemia because he reported only taking a total of 3 doses during the previous 3 months, with the most recent dose 4 days before presentation. He had been treated with immunoglobulin replacement since 10 years of age when CVID was diagnosed based on a clinical history of recurrent sinus and ear infections, low pretreatment immunoglobulin levels (IgG, 291 mg/dL; IgA, 18.7 mg/dL; and IgM, 31 mg/dL), and poor specific antibody response to vaccines. At 14 years of age he was treated with 4 weekly doses of rituximab with improvement in his chronic thrombocytopenia, reduction in splenomegaly, and radiographic resolution of his lung disease. By 7 months after rituximab treatment, the patient redeveloped thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and lung disease. At that time the patient and family were given the option to repeat rituximab therapy or consider bone marrow transplant, but they chose not to pursue these therapies because he was relatively asymptomatic at the time. Since then, he has had intermittent sinus and skin infections treated in the outpatient setting, with his last reported infection being an abscess on his thigh occurring 4 months earlier. The abscess was treated successfully in the emergency department with trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole antibiotic therapy. Additional history revealed bilateral chest pain during the preceding week that was attributed by the patient to muscle strain. Vital signs included a temperature of 37.8 C, slight tachycardia with a heart rate of 107/min, slight tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 24/min, blood pressure of 121/63 mm Hg, and normal oxygen saturation. His examination findings were notable for a nontoxic general appearance, 2 ulcers present on the base of his tongue, and massive splenomegaly. He did not have significant nasal congestion, and his lungs were clear to auscultation with no respiratory distress. The results of initial blood cell count studies are given in Table 1 . The results of serum electrolyte measurement, liver function tests, and urinalysis were unremarkable. The results of a respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel performed on a nasopharyngeal swab specimen were positive for rhinovirus and negative for influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and coronavirus. The results of a rapid streptococcal antigen detection test performed on a throat swab specimen were negative. Chest radiography revealed possible right lower lobe pneumonia. Treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin was started, along with ibuprofen for headache. A dose of intravenous immunoglobulin was given. Serum IgG level before intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was 795 mg/dL. Though he was in no acute distress and currently afebrile, the decision was made to admit the patient that evening for close monitoring and intravenous antibiotic treatment of pneumonia. The patient developed fever with temperatures to 39.1 C by noon the following day, and he continued to have fevers for 6 days with a peak temperature of 39.5 C. During this period, his workup was expanded in the context of continued fevers with lack of respiratory symptoms of cough, wheezing, or shortness of breath. Further history revealed that he cleaned windows and gutters for Reprints:
