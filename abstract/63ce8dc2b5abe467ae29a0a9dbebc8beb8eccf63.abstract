C. auris was first isolated from the ear of a Japanese patient in 2009. Since then this multidrug-resistant Candida species has becoming a global threat, causing infections that are associated with a high mortality. Outbreaks of infection occur mainly in ICU settings, and are difficult to control. There is still much to learn about the epidemiology and control of this pathogen. * Tel.: Ã¾44 (0)207 125 0822.
