The coronavirus (CoV) RNA genome is the largest among single-stranded positive sense RNA 23 viruses. CoVs encode a proofreading 3¢à5¢exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 24 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN 25 catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN 26 activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold decreased 27 fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogs. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) 28 genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in 29 parallel with WT-MHV. Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated 30 enhanced replication, reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and increased competitive 31 fitness. However, passage did not select for complete or partial reversion at the ExoN-32 inactivating mutations. We identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA 33 polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially account for the 34 observed changes in replication, susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and competitive fitness 35 observed in the passaged virus population, indicating that additional determinants can 36 compensate for the activities of nsp14-ExoN. Our results suggest that while selection favors 37 restoration of replication fidelity in ExoN(-) CoVs, there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) 38 reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV 39 fitness and identify additional candidate proteins that may regulate CoV replication fidelity. 40 41 42 All rights reserved.
