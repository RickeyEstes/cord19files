A diagnostic gap exists for common respiratory and gastrointestinal syndromes, with the likelihood that as yet undiscovered pathogens are involved. Existing knowledge about these common illnesses relies on research conducted before the rapid developments in molecular diagnostics of recent decades or focusses on disease at the severe end of the spectrum -hospitalisations -affecting a limited number of children and discounting the burden of more common, but less severe, community-managed illness. This protocol outlines a dynamic birth cohort study that will allow for a detailed description of the epidemiology of respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses during the first two years of life. The large biobank of specimens to be collated will act as a rich source of material to answer targeted research questions, including the role of virus acquisition and shedding on clinical illness and the discovery of new infectious agents. As study procedures, including specimen collection and return, are conducted by parents, findings will be free from Hawthorne effects from frequent interactions with study staff. Systematic weekly sampling will provide a control set of specimens for the individual and the cohort, allowing quantification of virus-specific attributable risk to illness. Non-random recruitment and enrolment requires awareness and assessment of potential bias and confounding prior to broad-based generalisation. Similar studies in the past have oversampled from higher socioeconomic households, and we attempt to avoid this by using a recruitment strategy that targets pregnant women in both public and private hospital settings. . van der Zalm MM, Uiterwaal CS, de Jong BM, et al.
