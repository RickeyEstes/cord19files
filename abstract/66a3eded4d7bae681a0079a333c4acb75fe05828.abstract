To investigate the prevalence of human bocavirus (hBoV), human coronaviruses (hCoV), and human polyomaviruses (hPyV) among patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), in South Africa. The study included 680 South African patients randomly selected in agedefined categories from hospitalised patients enrolled through SARI surveillance during 2012 to 2013. A multiplex reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect hBoV; hCoV-OC43, hCoV-229E, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-HKU1; and Washington University hPyV (hPyV-WU) and Karolinska Insitute hPyV (hPyV-KI), in respiratory tract specimens collected from patients with SARI. All respiratory specimens from patients enrolled through SARI surveillance were also routinely tested by multiplex reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction for adenovirus; enterovirus; human metapneumovirus; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus; rhinovirus; influenza A, and influenza B.
