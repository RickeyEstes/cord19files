Five diseases: acute respiratory infection (ARI), diarrhea, malaria, measles, and AIDS, are responsible for more than half of all deaths in children younger than age 5. ARI is now the leading cause of mortality in children younger than 5 years, accounting for nearly one fifth (20%) of childhood deaths worldwide, and killing between 2 and 3 million children each year. Because ARI often occurs with other diseases, including measles, malnutrition, and AIDS, childhood deaths attributed to other causes may actually be caused by ARI. The largest portion of ARI deaths occur in Africa and Southeast Asia, and, worldwide, mortality caused by ARI in children younger than 5 years is closely linked to poverty. Croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia are the three major manifestations of ARI that affect young infants worldwide. Viruses belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family, particularly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the recently identified human metapneumovirus (HMPV) [1], and the human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), cause most cases of childhood croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia [2] . Influenza virus also causes a significant burden of disease in young children, although its significance in children was not fully recognized until recently [3] . Although influenza has received a large share of the research focus and funding allocated to the respiratory viruses, the pediatric pathogens RSV and parainfluenza have lagged far behind. For influenza, effective vaccines and antiviral drugs, although urgently needing
