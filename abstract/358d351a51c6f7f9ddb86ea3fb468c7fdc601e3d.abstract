Most of the intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) reside in either the endolysosome or the cytoplasm to sense pathogen-derived RNAs, DNAs, or synthetic analogs of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), such as poly(I:C). However, it remains elusive whether or not a pathogen-derived protein can function as a cytosolic pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). In this study, we demonstrate that delivering the membrane gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) into HEK293T, HEK293ET, and immobilized murine bone marrow-derived macrophage (J2-M) cells significantly upregulates beta interferon (IFN-␤) production. Both NF-B and TBK1-IRF3 signaling cascades are activated by M gene products. M protein rather than M mRNA is responsible for M-mediated IFN-␤ induction that is preferentially associated with the activation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor proteins MyD88, TIRAP, and TICAM2 but not the RIG-I signaling cascade. IMPORTANCE Viral protein can serve as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that is usually recognized by certain pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) on the cell surface, such as Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4. In this study, we demonstrate that the membrane (M) protein of SARS-CoV can directly promote the activation of both beta interferon (IFN-␤) and NF-B through a TLR-related signaling pathway independent of TRAF3.
