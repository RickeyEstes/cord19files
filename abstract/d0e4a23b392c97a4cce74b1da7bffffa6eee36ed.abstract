The authors carried out a multistage stratified survey of 3,541 households representative of the population in four regions of China. They classified households as being "well prepared" for an emergency based on possession or affirmation of nine of fourteen "indicators" in a standard checklist. Fewer than 10% of households were considered "well prepared," while many professed ignorance or lack of interest in preparedness. Preparedness was associated with participation in emergency training and knowledge, and was negatively associated with reliance on external rescuers as well as a fatalistic outlook. Comments. Overall this is a well-designed and informative study. The text is well-written and unfolds logically, and the data support the overall conclusions. Considering the size and importance of China as the world's most populous country, with several regions especially prone to natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes, the study makes an important contribution to the literature on disaster preparedness, and could have a considerable public health impact in China. Nevertheless, there are a number of details that are somewhat sketchy, for which additional information and analysis would be helpful.
