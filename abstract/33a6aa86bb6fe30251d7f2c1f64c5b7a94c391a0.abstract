medRxiv preprint SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with active or latent TB were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and COVID-19 symptom development and progression were more rapid and severe. Meaning: Tuberculosis status should be assessed carefully at patient admission and management and therapeutic strategies adjusted accordingly to prevent rapid development of severe COVID-19 complications. Importance: Risk factors associated with COVID-19, the viral pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, in Dec 2019, require clarification so that medical resources can be prioritized for those at highest risk of severe COVID-19 complications. Infection with M. tuberculosis (MTB), the pathogen that causes TB and latently infects ~25% of the global population, may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Objective: To determine if latent or active TB increase susceptibility to SARS-COV-19 infection and disease severity, and lead to more rapid development of COVID-19 pneumonia.
