Do you have a bad sore throat? ○ Do you have difficulty swallowing liquids? ○ How severe and how long? ○ How quickly did it become severe? ○ Has your voice been affected? Have you been exposed to others with similar symptoms? ○ Are any friends, coworkers or travel associates experiencing similar illness? Have you recently been out of the country or out of the region? ○ If yes, what are the specific places and what activities were you engaged in? ○ Reinforce the importance of disclosing vacation locations even if they are US territories such as the Virgin Islands, or seemingly harmless places such as Bermuda Have you recently been camping? ○ If yes, what activities and exposures? What is your occupation? Just as the messages with signs and symptoms have been important for patient behaviors such that they think chest pain -911 for suspected myocardial infarctions, and FAST -911 for suspected strokes, we need to do a similar job in reminding people about communicable diseases, and the part each of us plays in controlling potential contagions. Clearly there are some challengeslanguage barriers, and cultural beliefs. But with closer collaboration with vulnerable populations and public health, along with the media, and other leaders of enterprises where people congregate, we can increase public awareness about communicable illnesses; along with methods they can implement to limit spread. As mentioned earlier in this issue, vaccination rates are inconsistent nationwide. According to the CDC flu vaccination rates remain very low on college campuses, with estimates between 8 and 39 percent, which is significantly less than the Healthy People 2020 recommendations for 70% of collegiate being vaccinated against influenza [6]. Interestingly, according to a Nichol, et al. in a document by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases [4,5] the average college student who gets the flu, will experience illness for eight days or more. Increasingly there are outbreaks of pertussis, measles, chickenpox and other vaccine preventable diseases. Part of this has to do with better communications about the need for booster vaccines in adulthood, and greater emphasis by healthcare professionals. There is no denying the anti-vaccine movement has had an impact on immunization rates; albeit exact numbers are unavailable. One has to wonder if the utter dismissal of immunizations would occur if it were recognized measles, for example is a preventable cause of blindness in the developing world. With the vaccine more readily available in Africa, such events have been reduced. Would the testimony of a parent whose child is blind from measles, or died from a vaccine preventable disease make an impact? Would the stridence against such powerful medical interventions persist? As physicians, health care providers and respected members of the community, we can be a powerful voice for vaccines. To be sure we are all stretched to capacity and facing an increasingly complex environment of competing demands in healthcare. But we must remain connected to public health updates, and the changing disease trends in our community. Moreover we can be the sentinel outposts, even if in solo or small group practice. Communications concerning epidemiological patterns can often be relegated to institutions and agenciessometimes called "siloing." As was learned during the anthrax, swine flu, SARS and ebola events since 2001, preparedness, even enhanced delivery of care by group practices relies upon the close working relationships across health delivery organizations, and professional groups in a community.
