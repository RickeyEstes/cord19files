The central nervous system (CNS) is an immunologically specialized tissue protected by a blood-brain barrier. The CNS parenchyma is enveloped by a series of overlapping membranes that are collectively referred to as the meninges. The meninges provide an additional CNS barrier, harbor a diverse array of resident immune cells, and serve as a crucial interface with the periphery. Recent studies have significantly advanced our understanding of meningeal immunity, demonstrating how a complex immune landscape influences CNS functions under steady-state and inflammatory conditions. The location and activation state of meningeal immune cells can profoundly influence CNS homeostasis and contribute to neurological disorders, but these cells are also well equipped to protect the CNS from pathogens. In this review, we discuss advances in our understanding of the meningeal immune repertoire and provide insights into how this CNS barrier operates immunologically under conditions ranging from neurocognition to inflammatory diseases. The central nervous system (CNS) is protected by several membranes that are collectively referred to as the meninges (see Glossary). Despite serving as a barrier and interface between the CNS and periphery, little is known about the immune composition of the meninges or how meningeal immunity affects the CNS under steady-state and inflammatory conditions. Recent advances in the field of meningeal immunity have begun to reshape our understanding of this compartment and indicate that it plays an important role in directing and coordinating immune traffic throughout the CNS [1]. Most CNS immune responses begin in the meninges before gaining access to the parenchyma, and emerging data indicate that the meninges are far more supportive than the parenchyma in hosting inflammation [2] . Compared with the CNS parenchyma, the meninges are an under-studied compartment and thought mainly to serve as a protective barrier, yet meningeal immunity can profoundly influence CNS homeostasis and even contribute to neurological disorders. Here, we provide a contemporary view of the meninges, focusing first on its exquisite anatomy and then define meningeal immunity under steady-state and inflammatory conditions. Structure and Fluid Movement The meninges consist of three cellular layers with different properties: the dura mater, which is adjacent to the skull, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater, which is the layer just above the brain and spinal cord parenchyma (Figure 1 ). The dura mater in humans is a dense, tough, collagenous membrane [3] that is highly innervated, vascularized, and contains lymphatics [4]. The arachnoid mater is a barrier that separates the dura mater from the rest of the CNS. Importantly, cells in the arachnoid mater have tight junctions and regulate the transport of molecules, similar to the blood-brain barrier [5, 6] , although studies in mice have demonstrated that the arachnoid mater is permissive to the passage of molecules (up to 40 kDa) applied to the dura mater [7] . Beneath the arachnoid mater lies the subarachnoid space, The CNS is protected by layers of cells that are collectively referred to as the meninges. Far from being an inert connective tissue, emerging data indicate that the meninges serve as an interface with the periphery and actively contribute to CNS homeostasis and immunity. The meningeal layers have a far more diverse immune repertoire than the CNS parenchyma and are innervated, have lymphatic drainage (dura), contain permeable blood vessels (dura), and support robust inflammatory responses. The meninges serve as a gatekeeper that isolates the brain and spinal cord parenchyma from the periphery. The meninges develop and support immune responses far more readily than the parenchyma, which can both protect and harm the CNS.
