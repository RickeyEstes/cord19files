Lef6vre, F., M6ge, D., L'Haridon, R., Bernard, S., De Yaureix, C. and La Bonnardi6re, C., 1990. Contribution of molecular biology to the study of the porcine interferon system. Vet. Microbiol., 23: We have performed molecular studies on the pig interferon (IFN) system (i) to analyse the role played by endogenous IFN in neonatal viral enteritis such as transmissible gastroenteritis and possibly to obtain, via recombinant DNA technology, a new anti-infectious and immunomodulatory agent in this species, (ii) to characterize the structure and biological functions of the IFN-like antiviral activity produced by the porcine embryo at the time of implantation in the uterus. By probing porcine genomic libraries with human and porcine IFN-a probes to isolate related genes, we have shown that the porcine IFN-a multigene family included, like several other mammalian species, two subfamilies of related but distinct genes. Class I subfamily contains at least 11 loci, located on chromosome no. 1, among which nine have been cloned and two (potentially functional) sequenced. Class II subfamily, which is specifically expressed by the embryo of ruminants before implantation, contains at least seven loci among which six have been cloned. One of the sequenced class I loci: PoIFN-al encodes a 189 amino acids (AA) preprotein. After removal of the sequence encoding the putative signal peptide (23 N-terminal AA ) this gene was inserted into an Escherichia coli bicistronic expression vector allowing intracellular synthesis of mature porcine IFN-a 1 (methionyl IFN-a I ). Expression of the recombinant protein was optimized by insertion of a seven base pairs long random synthetic sequence in the intercistronic region, followed by cloning in E. coli and immunodetection of clones expressing high amounts of recombinant protein. The E. coli strain obtained produced high levels of a 18 000 Da protein exhibiting the same in vitro overall biological properties as leucocyte derived porcine IFN (LeuIFN). However, it had a stronger antiviral effect on porcine cells than LeuIFN.

LEFEVRE ET AL. were realized to determine the in vivo half life of this rlFN-a in the pig, These experiments revealed no major toxic effects in newborn (given 5 × l0 6 IU/kg) or adult ( 1 X l0 6 IU/kg) pigs. A significant pyrogenic effect ( + 1.5°C) was noted only in the adults.
