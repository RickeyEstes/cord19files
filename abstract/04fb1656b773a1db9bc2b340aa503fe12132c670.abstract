(a) The 5 substrate scanning form ( P FAN1 shown as orange coils and A FAN1 as grey coils). 6 Example experimental electron density (blue meshes, 2.8 Å resolution, contoured at 1.5 7 σ) is shown in the left panels. Right panel: Example electron density (blue meshes, 2.2 Å 8 resolution, contoured at 1.5σ) of DNA (yellow sticks) in the unbiased 2Fo-Fc simulated-9 annealing composite-omit map (torsion angle dynamics at 1000K using CNS 1 ). (b) The 10 substrate-unwinding form ( P FAN1 shown as orange coils and A FAN1 shown as cyan 11 coils). Top panel: Example electron density (blue meshes, contoured at 1σ) of DNA 12 (green coils) in the unbiased 2Fo-Fc simulated-annealing composite-omit map (torsion 13 angle dynamics at 1000K using CNS). Bottom panel: Simulated annealing (torsion angle 14 dynamics at 3000K using Phenix) 2mFo-DFc map is contoured at 1.0σ as blue meshes 15 around 4Å radius of the complex. (c) The substrate-latching form. Top panel: Example 16 electron density (blue meshes, contoured at 1.7 σ) of DNA (green coils) in the unbiased 17 mFo-DFc simulated-annealing composite-omit map (torsion angle dynamics at 1000K 18 using Phenix). Bottom panel: Simulated annealing (torsion angle dynamics at 2500K 19 using Phenix) 2mFo-DFc map is contoured at 1.0σ as grey meshes around 4Å radius of 20 the complex.

Twinning analysis of the substrate-unwinding form (a) 113 and the substrate-latching form (b) data. The left plots are the L tests 5 and right plots 114 are the maximum likelihood estimation of the twinning fractions 6 for the twinning 115 operator (h, -k-h, -l).
