Antimicrobial agents are not necessary for exploratory surgery performed aseptically, in a hospital setting, and without complications. However, they are indicated in field conditions, if infection is already present, and if the intestinal tract is opened. A combination of ceftiofur (1.1 to 2.2 mg/kg IV twice a day [BID]) and procaine penicillin G (22,000 IU/kg intramuscularly [IM] BID) can be administered until culture results indicate an absence of microbes.
