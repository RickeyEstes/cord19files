# Contributed equally J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Highlights  We reviewed discovery and development process of broad-spectrum antiviral agents.  We summarized the information on 119 safe-in-man agents in freely accessible database.  Further studies will increase the number of broad-spectrum antivirals, expand spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections. : Viral diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Virus-specific vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases. However, broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e. compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of general population from emerging and reemerging viral diseases reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options. Here, we reviewed discovery and development of BSAAs and summarized the information on 119 safe-in-man agents in freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/). Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections.
