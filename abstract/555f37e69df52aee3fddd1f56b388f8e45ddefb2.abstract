Rotavirus is one of the most common mammalian gastroenteritis in children, causes diarrhea by infecting intestinal infections. Virtually all humans have been indifferentiated villus enterocytes in the small intestine. fected by 4 years of age, and primary infections are an The aim of this study was to determine whether cytokines important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. 5 that can be expressed by mucosal cells have an effect Under normal conditions, rotavirus exclusively infects on the rotavirus susceptibility of cultured human enteroenterocytes, primarily differentiated villus enterocytes in cytes. Methods: Caco-2 and HT-29 cells were pretreated the small intestine. Recent studies have shown that alwith various cytokines before challenge with rotavirus. Results: Interleukin (IL)-1, interferon (IFN)-a, and IFN-g clearance in mice, a functional B-cell response is required pretreatment led to a dose-dependent resistance to rotafor immunity to subsequent infection. 6,7 Less information virus infection.
