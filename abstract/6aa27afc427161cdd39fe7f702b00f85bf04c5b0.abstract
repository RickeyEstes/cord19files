and Escherichia coli to alcohol-based disinfectants or ultraviolet irradiation and the diffusion rate of ethanol were determined in artificial mucus or sputum samples obtained from 27 individuals with acute upper respiratory infection. Pathogens in mucus (artificial mucus or sputum samples) were not completely inactivated by alcohol-based disinfectants (survival rate >10%), suggesting that the alcohol-based disinfectants were ineffective. Pathogen survival and mucus viscosity were strongly correlated (correlation coefficient >0.7, P < 0.001). Additionally, the ethanol diffusion rate decreased with increasing mucus viscosity, which contributed to ethanol resistance. Pronase treatment of sputum samples significantly decreased sputum viscosity and increased the disinfectant effect (P < 0.001 for all). In contrast, complete inactivation was achieved by ultraviolet irradiation independently of mucus viscosity. Thus, mucus viscosity contributes to resistance of pathogens to alcohol-based disinfectants by decreasing the alcohol diffusion rate. These findings can provide a basis for developing new strategies, including improved disinfectants, for overcoming HAI. Healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs) such as nosocomial influenza outbreak are major problems in medicine, which have yet to be resolved 1-4 . The simplest and most effective means of preventing HAI is maintaining good hand hygiene 5 . The use of alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) has spread around the world since the Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings was released by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in 2002 6 . Based on this and the 2009 World Health Organization Guideline on Hand Hygiene in Health Care 7 , most clinical settings have adopted the practice of keeping hands, which are not visibly contaminated, clean using ABHRs. However, HAI in medical facilities has not been completely prevented, which is partly due to lack of compliance among medical staff; indeed, a reduction in HAI incidence has been linked to greater compliance 5,8-11 . However, some studies suggest that there may be room for improvement in standard hand hygiene practices 12,13 . Methods for evaluating the efficacy of disinfectants by adding a load material (e.g., foetal bovine serum or bovine serum albumin) have been established by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and European Committee for Standardization (CEN) 14-17 . However, not only contaminating proteins but also other factors of body fluid could decrease the efficacy of alcohol-based disinfectants. Revealing the factors could enable the development of hand hygiene that is more suited to clinical needs, and could contribute to prevention of HAI. Mucus (viscous body fluids such as sputum or nasal discharge) contain large amounts of mucin, which has a central protein core with multiple polysaccharide chains. Epithelial mucins are high-molecular weight glycoproteins that provide viscosity and gel-forming ability to mucus 18 . The thick epithelial mucus layer has a barrier function that is attributed to its high viscosity and protects the mucosal epithelium from gastric acid, digestive
