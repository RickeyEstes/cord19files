The ribosomal frameshift signal in the genomic RNA of the coronavirus IBV is composed of two elements, a heptanucleotide "slippery-sequence" and a downstream RNA pseudoknot. We have investigated the kinds of slippery sequence that can function at the IBV frameshift site by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of slippery-sequence mutants. We firstly confirmed that the site of frameshifting in TBV was at the heptanucleotide st'retch UUCAAAC, and then used our knowledge of t,he pseudoknot structure and a suitable reporter gene to prepare an expression construct that allowed both the magnitude and direction of ribosomal frameshifting to be determined for candidate slippery sequences. Our results show that in almost all of the sequences tested, frameshifting is strictly into the -1 reading frame. Monotonous runs of nucleotides, however, gave detectable levels of a -21 + 1 frameshift. product, and U stretches in particular gave significant levels (2% t'o %I?/,). Preliminary evidence suggests that the RN',4 pseudoknot may play a role in influencing frameshift direction. The spectrum of slip-sequences tested in this analysis included all t,hose known or suspected to be utilized in uivo. Our results indicate that triplets of A, C, G and L' are functional when decoded in the ribosomal P-site following slippage (XXXYYYN) although (J triplets were the least effective. In the A-site (XXYmN), triplets of C and G were non-functional. The identity of the nucleotide at position 7 of the slippery sequence (XXXYYYN) was found to be a critical determinant of frameshift efficiency and we show that a hierarchy of frameshifting exists for ,4-site rodons. These observations lead us t'o suggest that ribosomal frameshifting at a particular site is determined, at least' in part. b2 the strength of the interaction of normal cellular tRNAs wit,h the A-site codon and does not necessarily involve specialized "shifty" t,RNAs.
