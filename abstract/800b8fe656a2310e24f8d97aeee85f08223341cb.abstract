HALL, S. AND A. SMITH. Inoestigation of the effects and aftereffects of naturally occurring upper respiratory tract illnesses on mood and performance. PHYSIOL BEHAV 59(3) [569][570][571][572][573][574][575][576][577] 1996.--This study examined the effects and aftereffects of naturally occurring upper respiratory tract illnesses on mood and performance. Twenty-six subjects (12 males, 14 females, mean age 23 years 10 months, age range 18-39 years) were tested once a week for a period of a month. Fifteen subjects were suffering from a common cold on the first week and the other 11 subjects were matched healthy control,;. Subjects attended for an initial 3-h testing period that consisted of a set of practice trials and two test sessions involving mood rating and performance of a battery of tests measuring psychomotor functions, attention, and memory. Sessions 3, 4, and 5 took place 1, 2, and 3 weeks later, respectively. In addition to measuring mood and mental performance, symptom severity was rated on a subjective checklist. The results showed that subjects with a cold reported an increase in negative mood and that this was only significant in the first week. Impairments of psychomotor function (simple reaction time and tracking) were also observed at this time. Performance of sustained and selective attention tasks was also impaired in subjects with colds but this effect was only significant in the second week. Other fu:~ctions such as working and semantic memory were unimpaired in subjects with colds at any point in the experiment Overall, the present results confirm many of the earlier results obtained in studies of experimentally induced upper respiratory tract illnesses. Indeed, these results are both of great practical importance and theoretical interest and further studies must now elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects. Upper respiratory tract illness Performance Mood Postviral effects UPPER respiratory tract illnesses (URTIs), such as the common cold or influenza, are wiide spread, frequent, and a major cause of absenteeism from work and education. Recent research on the effects of experimentally induced URTIs suggests that they influence aspects of mental performance and mood. The primary aim of the present study was to determine whether such effects are observed during the symptomatic stage of naturally occurring URTIs and whether behavioural problems continue into convalescence. Evidence for detrimental effects of naturally occurring URTIs on performance comes largely from anecdotal reports and case histories (12, 34) . There is also a single study suggesting that such illnesses may influence the performance of school children (13). However, a recent study (21) could find no significant relationship between the prevalence of work-related accidents and the incidence of URTIs. These contradictory results may, at least in part, reflect the difficulties inherent in studying naturally occurring viral infections. To overcome these problems, a series of studies was conducted at the MRC Common Cold Unit, Salisbury, UK, examining the effects of experimentally induced UR-TIs on performance and mood. Both the routine of the common cold unit and the effects of experimentally induced URTIs on performance have been reviewed in detail elsewhere (3,20) and the results obtained are briefly summarised: 1. Cold-type viral infection led to impaired performance on psychomotor tasks, involving hand-eye coordination (17,18). t Requests for reprints should be addressed to 569 570 HALL AND SMITH Impairments were observed on a tracking task (25), a fivechoice serial reaction time task (26), and the pegboard task (28). 2. Cold virus infection did not produce impairments on simple memory tasks, such as digit span or free recall tasks. However, with more complex story recall, cold subjects actually showed improved memory for unimportant information presented prior to virus challenge, but were otherwise less able than controls to follow the theme when the complete test was run during the illness (30). 3. Influenza infection, unlike cold virus infection, was observed to increase reaction time on tasks where there is uncertainty as to where the next target will appear (25). These tasks included the variable foreperiod reaction time task, a visual search task, and a detection task. In contrast, a cold virus did not affect performance on a vigilance task (20). Influenza, but not cold infection, also increased distractability from irrelevant stimuli on the Stroop colour-word test (19). On two choice reaction time tasks (5), the performance of influenza sufferers was not impaired if the target appeared in a known central location, but response was slower if the location was uncertain (29). Cold sufferers, however, had slower reaction times on both tasks, suggesting a general motor slowing, whereas influenza infection may be impairing an attentional mechanism. 4. Neither infection with cold nor influenza appeared to effect complex cognitive tasks such as logical reasoning. Speed of retrieval of semantic knowledge held in long-term memory is also unaffected (30). 5. Mood ratings taken during illness were also virus specific. Whereas influenza virus produced a more general negative mood state, coronavirus produced a reduction in alertness only and other cold viruses did not alter mood at all (31). 6. Other impairments were observed even in the absence of symptoms. For example, performance impairments were also found on some tasks during the incubation period and in volunteers with subclinical infection (infection established by biological methods but without symptoms) (25). In addition, results from one study (29) showed that performance can still be impaired in convalescence when subjects are no longer symptomatic. It is extremely difficult to study effects in the incubation period of naturally occurring illnesses or to examine the effects of subclinical infection. In contrast to this, effects on performance and mood can easily be studied while subjects are symptomatic and while they are convalescing. This approach has demonstrated that naturally occurring influenza B illnesses produce similar changes to those reported in earlier studies using experimentally induced infections (23). The present study also followed the same research strategy and was a forerunner to more sophisticated studies involving prospective designs and virological assays intended to detect the nature of the infecting agent (24), which allows comparisons to be made across different cold-producing viruses. The previous work on URTIs and human performance suggested a number of possible outcomes of an investigation of the effects of naturally occurring illnesses. These are summarised below and the present study was designed to test these alternative views. 1. One might expect the pattern of performance and mood changes found in naturally occurring illnesses to be similar to those observed following experimentally induced infections. Two possible outcomes would support this view: the first being where effects are identical to the previous studies, the second involving selective changes but not necessarily identical ones to those found in earlier research. 2. An alternative view is that naturally occurring illnesses may be the result of many different viruses, and this mix of viruses may mask the effects of each virus. On the basis of this one would not expect to replicate the effects obtained with experimentally induced infections. Indeed, if different viruses produced opposing effects one would not necessarily expect to find differences between the subjects with URTIs and matched healthy controls. 3. The illnesses that followed experimentally induced infections were typically very mild. In real-life URTIs are usually more severe and such illnesses could produce more global changes in performance and mood. The present study not only considered the period when the person was symptomatic but also examined possible aftereffects of naturally occurring URTIs. Again, several possible views of the outcomes could be put forward. First, the size and pattem of the impairments present during and after the illness might be directly related to symptom severity. Secondly, symptoms might change over time and other changes related to these new symptoms might appear. Finally, changes in performance and mood might be independent of symptom severity and type. It was hoped that the pattern of results obtained would shed light on the mechanisms by which any changes in performance or mood were produced. A longitudinal between-subjects design was employed. Individuals who presented with symptoms of an acute upper respiratory illness were recruited and control subjects reporting an absence of URTI symptoms were also included. Subjects were assessed during the initial illness and then on three subsequent occasions at weekly intervals during convalescence. To reduce the impact of differences other than the illness factor two methodological features were included. First, a homogenous sample of subjects (university students) was recruited. Secondly, a detailed profile of each subject's personality, recent mental health status, and health-related behaviour was recorded by administration of a series of questionnaires. This information then allowed the consideration of such factors when analysing any differences between the URTI and healthy groups. Potential subjects were attracted by means of a poster campaign. Subjects were recruited into the study if presenting typical cold symptoms (sneezing, runny nose, etc.), which had to have been present for more than 6 h but less than 5 days. Control subjects were included only if they had experienced no cold-like symptoms within the previous month. As some tasks involved verbal materials, volunteers whose first language was not English were excluded from the study. A total of 41 subjects satisfied the inclusion criteria. Of these, 26 reported upper respiratory symptoms and 15 were control subjects. Every subject was given an information sheet with details of the experiment. All gave signed informed consent. Participants were paid at the rate of £4 per hour upon completion of all five test sessions. Subjects attended for an initial 3-h testing period, commencing at either 1000 or 1400 h. This consisted of a set of practice trials and two similar test battery sessions. Sessions 3, 4, and 5 took place 1, 2, and 3 weeks later, respectively, and at the same time of day as the initial session. Each week, including the first, subjects rated symptom severity on a checklist. Volunteers were tested in isolation in experimental cubicles. Each test session EFFECTS OF THE COIvlMON COLD ON PERFORMANCE AND MOOD 571 involved a visual analogue mood rating followed by the battery of performance tests (desc-ribed below). Practice trials were shortened versions of the tests and were completed in the same order. The practice took approximately 30 min, and the actual test session took about 50 rain to complete. Subjects carried out the tests in a counterbalanced order; half of the subjects completed six computerised tasks first, whereas others began with another six tasks, mostly of paper and pencil type. Each subject repeated the same order across all test sessions, with different versions of the identical tasks used in session 1. At the end of the first session subjects were given a break during which they completed the questionnaires giving background information. Thirty minutes after the start of the break the subject returned to the cubicles to commence the second session. Background Questionnaire
