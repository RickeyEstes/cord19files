Symposium on Advances in Feline Medicine I Feline Infectious Peritonitis An Immune-Mediated Coronaviral Vasculitis John R. August, B. Vet. Med., M.S., M.R .C. V.S. * Our understanding of the pathogenesis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) has improved dramatically in recent years. Patients with FIP apparently represent only a small fraction of cats infected with coronaviruses, because many cats in the general feline population have antibodies that cross-react with FIP virus (FIPV). Continuing investigation into the seroepizootiology of FIPV has raised more questions than have been answered. Do most strains of FIPV cause no more than a localized infection and a chronic asymptomatic carrier state? Are all strains of FIPV of equal virulence, with the immunologic response of the infected cat solely determining the eventual outcome? The objective of this article is to review the various factors predisposing cats to FIPV infection, and to clarify the immunopathogenetic mechanisms responsible for the development of clinical disease. In light of our present knowledge of FIPV and the basic pathologic lesions it induces in terminally ill cats, FIPV might more accurately be named feline coronaviral vasculitis. FIP is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are pleomorphic, enveloped particles that average 100 nm in diameter and contain a single strand of RNA. 3.10 Characteristic petal-shaped projections called peplomers protrude from the viral surface.2O In many species of animals, coronaviruses have a relatively restricted organ tropism, infecting the respiratory and/or gastrointestinal systems. 29 Following oral infection, the viruses have an affinity for the mature apical columnar epithelium of the villi in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. 24 Younger members of any species tend
