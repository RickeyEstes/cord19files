Eighty-four calves with respiratory disease from 18 herds in different parts of Finland were chosen for a study evaluating the capacity of different respiratory pathogens to cause changes in different acute phase protein concentrations, white blood cell (WBC) count and clinical signs. The selected acute phase proteins were fibrinogen, haptoglobin, serum amyloid-A, lipopolysaccharide binding protein and a1-acid glycoprotein. From each calf, a paired blood sample was obtained for serological studies of bovine parainfluenza virus-3, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine adenovirus-3 and bovine adenovirus-7. Tracheobronchial lavage was performed to detect bacteria and mycoplasma. Isolation of Pasteurella multocida was associated with increased concentrations of all tested acute phase proteins.
