. Application of radioimmunological methods for checking the quality of class-specific antibodies against bovine and porcine immunoglobulins, vet. Immunol,lmmunopathol,, 5: 377-387, class-specific antibodies against bovine IgOl, IgG2, IgM and IgA and porcine IgG, IgM and IgA immunoglobulins were prepared. Their class specificity was assessed by two radioimmunological methods, nameIy, radioimmunoelectrophoresis and double antibody sandwich radioimmunoassay. The methods are highIy specific and sensitive and do not require the use of purified immunoglobulins, but can be performed with normai serum or colostrum. It was confirmed that antibodies found satisfactory in these tests were suitable for a wide range of use including radioimmunoassay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.
