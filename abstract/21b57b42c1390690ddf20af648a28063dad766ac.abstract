KEYWORDS Transplant infection Critical care Immunosuppression Opportunistic infection Microbiological diagnosis Transplant patients represent a heterogeneous and rapidly growing patient group requiring a high index of suspicion for infection. Infection is a major posttransplant cause of morbidity and mortality, and new threats continually emerge. Individualized assessments of net state of immunosuppression and infection risk are important. Aggressive pursuit of an early microbiological diagnosis is crucial; invasive procedures should be used if necessary. In the setting of life-threatening infection, reduction or cessation of immunosuppressive therapy whenever possible is an important adjunct to therapy. Crit Care Clin 29 (2013) 953-973 http://dx.
