Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to cause zoonotic infections 17 and serious disease, primarily in the Arabian Peninsula, due to repeated spill-over from dromedary 18 camels and subsequent nosocomial transmission. Approved MERS vaccines for use in animals or 19 humans are not currently available. MERS-CoV replication requires the virus-encoded papain-like 20 protease (PL pro ) to cleave multiple sites in the viral replicase polyproteins, thereby releasing 21 functional non-structural proteins. Additionally, PL pro is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that can 22 remove ubiquitin(-like) moieties from substrates, presumably to counteract host antiviral responses. 23 In previous work, we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV PL pro in complex with ubiquitin, 24 facilitating the design of PL pro mutations that impair DUB activity without affecting viral polyprotein 25 cleavage. Here, we introduced these DUB-inactivating mutations into the viral genome and 26 examined their impact on MERS-CoV infection both in cell culture and in a lethal mouse model. 27 Although overall replication of DUB-negative and wild-type (wt) recombinant MERS-CoV was 28 comparable in multiple cell lines, infection with DUB-negative virus markedly increased mRNA levels 29 for interferon (IFN)-Î² and IFN-stimulated genes. Moreover, compared to a wt virus infection, the 30 survival rate was significantly increased when DUB-negative MERS-CoV was used to infect transgenic 31 mice expressing a human MERS-CoV receptor. Interestingly, DUB-negative and wt MERS-CoV 32 replicated to the same titers in lungs of infected mice, but the DUB-negative virus was cleared faster, 33 likely due to the observed accelerated and better-regulated innate immune responses, in contrast to 34 delayed and subsequently excessive responses in wt virus-infected mice. This study provides the first 35 direct evidence that the DUB activity of a coronaviral protease contributes to innate immune evasion 36 and can profoundly enhance virulence in an animal model. Thus, reduction or removal of the innate 37 immune-suppressive DUB activity of PL pro s is a promising strategy for coronavirus attenuation in the 38 context of rational vaccine development.
