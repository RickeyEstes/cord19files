He had marked reactivity to stone fruits, nuts, and Cannabis components, which contain nsLTPs. The phenomenon of cross-reactivity between C sativa and plant foods is known as "Cannabis fruit/vegetable syndrome" or "LTP syndrome." 5 Numerous studies have analyzed the nsLTP-mediated cross-reactivity between C sativa and stone fruits, such as peaches, nectarines, and plums, in addition to nuts, apples, and tomatoes. [5][6][7][8] The nsLTPs belong to the prolamin protein superfamily and provide protection against bacteria and fungi in plants. Given their important role in the plant defense system, these nsLTPs are highly conserved and, as a result, often cause clinical reactivity to multiple different foods in sensitized patients. 8 The nsLTPs are highly resistant to thermal stress and proteolysis, which could account for their ability to withstand digestion and cause more systemic reactions, although oral allergy syndrome also has been described. 9 Prior studies have suggested that nsLTP-mediated reactivity is geographic, mainly in Europe. 5,8 Some reports have indicated sensitization to stone fruits in the wake of developing an allergy to marijuana. 5,10 In the present case, the history of stone fruit allergies preceded the development of anaphylaxis to C sativa components. This raises the novel possibility that the reverse sequence for nsLTP cross-reactivity also might be relevant. In summary, gathering a thorough allergy and social history is essential for patients reporting allergic symptoms to C sativa. Given expanding medical and recreational use, we anticipate that marijuana hypersensitivity will be a topic of growing importance in the field of allergy. Our case raises the possibility that, in addition to marijuana smoking and handling, nsLTP-mediated stone fruit crossreactivity might be another "gateway" to C sativa sensitization.
