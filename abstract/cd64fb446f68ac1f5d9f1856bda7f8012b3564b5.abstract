Context: The 2-1-1 helpline is a social services innovation that has spread rapidly throughout the U.S. Policy diffusion theory suggests that policymakers seek to reduce uncertainty by anticipating the effects of a proposed innovation through tools such as cost-benefıt analyses. Few policy diffusion studies have examined use of information, such as cost-benefıt analyses, in the diffusion process. The purpose of this study is to examine how cost-benefıt analyses were used during the rapid diffusion of 2-1-1 across states. The paper also describes components of 2-1-1 cost-benefıt analyses. Evidence acquisition: In 2011, cost-benefıt analyses of 2-1-1 and substantive citations of them were identifıed through scholarly key word searches using Academic Search Premier and Web of Science, general Internet searches using Google search terms, and communications with academicians and 2-1-1 practitioners through personal contact and e-mail discussion groups. To be included in this study, documents had to be related to 2-1-1 helplines, present information about their costs and benefıts, and be formal documents. The documents were catalogued and analyzed for costbenefıt analyses or references to analyses, and stated purpose. Evidence synthesis: Of the 19 documents that met eligibility inclusion criteria, nine were original cost-benefıt analyses and ten referenced analyses conducted for other jurisdictions. The diffusion of2-1-1 helplinesin the U.S.hasbeen influenced by interjurisdictionalexchange of cost-benefıt analyses, in both the creation of original analyses and/or the referencing of previous work.
