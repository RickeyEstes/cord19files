Covalent post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like factors has emerged as a general mechanism to regulate myriad intracellular processes. The addition and removal of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins from factors has recently been demonstrated as a key mechanism to modulate DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. It is thus, timely to evaluate the potential for ubiquitin pathway enzymes as DDR drug targets for therapeutic intervention. The synthetic lethal approach provides exciting opportunities for the development of targeted therapies to treat cancer: most tumours have lost critical DDR pathways, and thus rely more heavily on the remaining pathways, while normal tissues are still equipped with all DDR pathways. Here, we review key deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) involved in DDR pathways, and describe how targeting DUBs may lead to selective therapies to treat cancer patients.

Genomic instability is fuelled by DNA damage and errors introduced during DNA replication. Many factors-which include endogenously arising agents, such as reactive oxygen species and metabolic by-products together with exogenous agents, such as ultra-violet light, ionising radiation, tobacco smoke chemicals and other genotoxic chemicals-have been identified that generate a range of different damage types or lesions on DNA; see [1] for a recent review. Several complex and interconnected DNA-repair systems have therefore evolved to recognise and correct most of the insults inflicted on the cell's vital genetic information. Importantly, radiotherapy and most commonly-used anticancer chemotherapies operate by generating DNA damage. While, effective tumour eradication by these treatments results from the generation of irreparable DNA
