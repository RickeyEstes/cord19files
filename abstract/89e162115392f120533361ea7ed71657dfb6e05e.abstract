Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-nB) is a critical regulator of innate and adaptive immune function as well as cell proliferation and survival. The present study demonstrated for the first time that a virus belonging to the Arteriviridae family activates NF-nB in MARC-145 cells and alveolar macrophages. In porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-infected cells, NF-nB activation was characterized by translocation of NF-nB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, increased DNA binding activity, and NF-nB-regulated gene expression. NF-nB activation was increased as PRRSV infection progressed and in a viral dose-dependent manner. UV-inactivation of PRRSV significantly reduced the level of NF-nB activation. Degradation of InB protein was detected late in PRRSV infection, and overexpression of the dominant negative form of InBa (InBaDN) significantly suppressed NF-nB activation induced by PRRSV. However, InBaDN did not affect viral replication and viral cytopathic effect. PRRSV infection induced oxidative stress in cells by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidants inhibited NF-nB DNA binding activity in PRRSV-infected cells, suggesting ROS as a mechanism by which NF-nB was activated by PRRSV infection. Moreover, NF-nB-dependent expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 was observed in PRRSV-infected cells, an observation which implies that NF-nB activation is a biologically significant aspect of PRRSV pathogenesis. The results presented here provide a basis for understanding molecular pathways of pathology and immune evasion associated with disease caused by PRRSV. D
