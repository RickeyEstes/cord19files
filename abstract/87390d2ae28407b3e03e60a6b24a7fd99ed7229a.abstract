105 ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; ICU = intensive care unit; IL = interleukin; SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome. Available online http://ccforum.com/content/8/2/105 Unfortunately, in the winter of 2004 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) emerges in the world once again, and health care workers in your institution begin to develop the illness. Patients with SARS start to develop critical illness and you are asked to become involved in their care. You have read that during the first outbreak of SARS steroids were a commonly employed therapy. Despite this you worry about the adverse effects of steroid therapy, especially in critically ill patients. SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) proved an enormous physical and emotional challenge to frontline health care workers throughout the world in late 2002 through to mid 2003. A large percentage of patients (many being health care workers themselves) became critically ill. Unfortunately, clinicians caring for these individuals did not have the advantage of previous experience or research data on which to base treatment decisions. As a result, at least early in the outbreak, a 'best guess approach' and/or anecdotes drove therapy. In many centres systemic steroids, which carry many potential downsides, became a mainstay of therapy. In this issue of Critical Care, two groups that have frontline experience of SARS debate the role of steroids. Let us hope and pray together that we never have the patient population needed to resolve the questions the two sides raise. Pro: Yes, steroids are a key component of the treatment regimen for SARS References
