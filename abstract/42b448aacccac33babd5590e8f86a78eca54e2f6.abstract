The intravenous infection of Theiler's virus GD VII strain causes acute encephalomyelitis in infected mice. To determine the cellular mechanism of resistance and interferon (IFN)-y-producing cell populations, mononuclear cells isolated from tissues of the brain were analyzed by the flow cytometry method. Antibodies specific for CD3, CD4, CD8, T cell receptor (TCR)-a/3, and Asialo GM1 were used to deplete the corresponding cell populations in Theiler's virus-infected mice. CD4 รท lymphocytes and CD8 รท lymphocytes infiltrated in the brains of infected mice from 5 days postinfection (p.i.).
