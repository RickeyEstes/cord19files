KEYWORDS Medical education Simulation Critical care Learning outcomes Simulation-based medical education (SBME) is an instructional medium that refers to the use of multiple simulation modalities. SBME presents favorable characteristics for the achievement of educational goals that may not be fully addressed during clinical-based training. Numerous studies support the use of SBME for the improvement of knowledge, technical and nontechnical tasks (teamwork, communication skills), and system issues in different clinical domains. More research is needed to better understand the most effective use of SBME as part of a broader medical curriculum.
