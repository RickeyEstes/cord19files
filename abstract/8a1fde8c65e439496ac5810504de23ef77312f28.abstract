As the infection of 2019-nCoV coronavirus is quickly developing into a global pneumonia epidemic, careful analysis of its transmission and cellular mechanisms is sorely needed. In this report, we re-analyzed the computational approaches and findings presented in two recent manuscripts by Ji et al. (https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25682) and by Pradhan et al. (https://doi.Global protein sequence alignment of the full-length coronavirus spike proteins was performed by MUSCLE 17 and visualized by SeaView 18 . We use C-I-TASSER 5 to create structural models of the full-length spike protein. Here, C-I-TASSER is an extended pipeline of I-TASSER 19 and utilizes the deep convolutional neuralnetwork based contact-maps 20 to guide the Monte Carlo fragment assembly simulations. Since the RBD domain of spike exhibits different conformations relative to the remaining portion of . CC-BY 4.0
