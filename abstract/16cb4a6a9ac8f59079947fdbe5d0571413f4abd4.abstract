Temperature-sensitive mutants of the munne coronavirus JHM induced a sub~ acute demyelinatin 8 encephalomyelitis (SD~E) in youn~ rats. Neurological symptol~,; were associated with marked lesion3 of primary d~my¢;lination ".m the white matter of the central nervous system (CNS), and developing after an incubation time of several weeks to months. Many rats survived this infection and rco3vered completely from this CNS disease. Amon 8 43 survivors of SDE, 9 ra'~s developed a ~'elapse 27-153 days after onset of the first attack. Neuropathologica.l ex~n~ation ol~ these animals revealed areas of fresh| ¢~emyelination together with old remyelinated lesions. V'md antisens were detectable in the neighbourhood of fresh les:ions and in some ca~ infectious virus was re-i~lated from rats revealing low antibl~y titers to JHM virus. These results demonstrate that mutants of JHM virus can induca~ a relapsing demyelinating disease process, associated with a persistent in fection, which some similarities to chronic experimental allergic enceph~dor~ayel/tis.
