We describe the use of epidural analgesia in a 39-year-old G2P1 parturient presenting at 38 +6 weeks estimated gestation with confirmed influenza A H1N1 and superimposed bilateral pneumonia. Although the patient had an uncomplicated intra-and post-partum course, little is known about the safety of performing neuraxial analgesia or anesthesia in patients with influenza. The prevalence of viremia and possible translocation of blood-borne virus to the central nervous system are discussed. Magnesium is commonly used in the prevention of eclampsia. Reports of acute toxicity are rare and we are not aware of detailed management algorithms. We present a case of acute magnesium toxicity presenting as ventilatory impairment and failure to rouse adequately from general anaesthesia. The patient was managed with controlled ventilation, further sedation, intravenous calcium gluconate, forced diuresis and dextrose-insulin infusion. We present a guideline for the management of life-threatening magnesium toxicity and discuss measures that may prevent future similar occurrences. Crown
