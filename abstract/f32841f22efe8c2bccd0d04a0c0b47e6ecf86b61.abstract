Clinical and 17 epidemiological studies suggest that co-infection by rhinovirus and influenza virus may reduce 18 disease severity and that they may also interfere with each other's spread within a host population. To determine how co-infection by these two unrelated respiratory viruses affects pathogenesis, 20 we established a mouse model using a minor serogroup rhinovirus (RV1B) and mouse-adapted 21 influenza A virus (PR8). Infection of mice with RV1B two days before PR8 reduced 22 pathogenesis of mild to moderate, but not severe PR8 infections. Disease attenuation was 23 associated with an early inflammatory response in the lungs and enhanced clearance of PR8. However, co-infection by RV1B did not reduce PR8 viral loads early in infection or inhibit 25 replication of PR8 within respiratory epithelia or in vitro. Inflammation in co-infected mice 26
