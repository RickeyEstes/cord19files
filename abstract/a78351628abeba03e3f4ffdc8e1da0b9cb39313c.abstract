The clear, rectangular crystals are of varying size. Two foam cells are adjacent to the crystals. (Wright-Giemsa; HP oil.) ■ FIGURE 12-13. Mammary carcinoma. Tissue aspirate. Dog. Marked anisokaryosis, anisocytosis, prominent nucleoli, coarse nuclear chromatin, and binucleation are present in cells that also display poor cellular adhesion. (Wright-Giemsa; HP oil.) ■ FIGURE 12-14. Mammary carcinoma. Tissue aspirate. Dog. Abnormal mitotic fi gure with lag chromatin from same specimen as shown in Figure 12-13. Lag chromatin results from abnormal formation of the mitotic spindle apparatus. Abnormal mitotic fi gures are considered one criterion of malignancy. (Wright-Giemsa; HP oil.)
