typhimurium Acya Acrp Aasd x3987. Three partially overlapping fragments of TGEV S gene, encoding the amino-terminal, intermediate, and carboxy-terminal end of the protein, as well as the full length gene were inserted into the asd+ plasmid pYA292 to generate recombinant plasmids pYATS-I, pYATS-2, pYATS-3, and pYATS-4, respectively, which were transformed into S. typhimurium x3987. Recombinant S. typhimurium x3987 (pYATS-1) and'x3987 (pYATS-4) expressing constitutively a 53 kDa amino-terminal fragment of the S protein and the full length protein ( 144 kDa) , respectively, showed high stability. After 50 generations in vitro 60% and 20% of the bacteria transformed with pYATS-1 and pYATS-4, respektively, expressed the S-protein antigen. Since S. typhimurium x3987 (pYATS-1) showed a better level of expression and stability in vitro, this recombinant strain was selected as a potential bivalent vector to induce both immunity to SulnwnelZa and TGEV in swine. In order to study colonization of swine tissues by S. typhimurium Acya Acrp, a gene conferring resistance to rifampicin was cloned into the chromosome of S. typhimurium x3987, generating x4509 strain. Both S. typhimurium ,@509 (pYA292) and fl509 ( pYATS-1) colonized the ileum of orally inoculated swine with clearance of bacteria between days 10-20 post-infection. The expression of the amino-terminal fragment of the S protein diminished the ability of S. typhimurium x4509 (pYATS-1) to colonize deep tissues. The recombinant strain S. typhimurium x3987 ( pYATS-1) induced TGEV specific antibodies in both serum and saliva of orally inoculated swine. * Corresponding author: Phone: 34-l-585-4555.
