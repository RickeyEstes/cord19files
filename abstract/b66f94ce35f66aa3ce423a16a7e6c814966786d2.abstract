The Feline coronavirus (FCoV) can lead to Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which the precise cause is still unknown. The theory of internal mutation suggests that a less virulent biotype of FCoV (FECV) would lead to another more pathogenic biotype (FIPV) capable of causing FIP. In this work, the 7b gene was amplified from 51 domestic cat plasma samples by semi-nested PCR and tested through phylogenetic and phylogeographical approaches. The 7b gene of Brazilian isolates displayed high conservation, a strong correlation between the geographic origin of the viral isolates and their genealogy, and its evolution was possibly shaped by a combination of high rates of nucleotide substitution and purifying selection. The Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is an important pathogen of domestic and wild felids, which can cause subclinical infection, mild enteritis or lead to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a fatal disease characterized by inflammatory lesions of serous membranes and systemic granulomatous lesions of parenchymatous organs [23] . Although the precise cause of FIP pathogenesis is still unknown, several hypotheses have been suggested [20] . The most accepted hypothesis, called internal mutation theory, suggests that during the replication of FCoV in the intestinal epithelium, a mutation occurs that makes the virus more pathogenic and able to infect monocytes and macrophages and cause FIP [23, 27] . This virulent mutant variant was designated Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), while a variant that leads to enteric infection has been termed Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) [25] . The precise nature of the mutation responsible for the pathogenesis has not been identified in the FCoV genome [10] . Nevertheless, it has been deduced that the non-structural glycoprotein 7b, codified by ORF7b, plays a determinative role in FCoV virulence [31], besides having a strong phylogenetic sign for the differentiation between FECV and FIPV [3] . To better understand the molecular epidemiology of FCoV in Brazilian domestic cats, phylogenetic hypothesis and viral population dynamics were inferred from the 7b gene. A phylogenetic hypothesis and the reconstructed population history of FCoV isolates are presented in this work, providing insights into the origins of FCoV in Brazil. Furthermore, the molecular analysis of 7b gene dispenses considerations about the internal mutation theory, regarding to the virulence of the serotypes of FCoV. This study included samples from 210 domestic cats (Felis catus) of various breeds, random selected from different local animal hospitals (Minas Gerais, Brazil) during 2003-2010. One hundred twenty-nine animals were healthy and taken to veterinary clinics for vaccinations and/or elective surgery. Eighty-one of them showed clinical symptoms of FIP such as anorexia, weight loss,
