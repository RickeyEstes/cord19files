Background: Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) remains a major problem for global public health. Viral persistence and immune defects are the two major reasons for CHB, and it was hypothesized that based on a transient clearance of serum viral DNA and HBsAg "window stage", active immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) might initiate effective host immune responses versus HBV to achieve functional cure of CHB. Methods: Two experimental mouse models that mice hydrodynamic injected HBV DNA or infected with recombinant AAV/HBV were used. The "sandwich" therapeutic effect by using a potent human anti-HBsAg neutralizing monoclonal antibody (G12) in combination with antiviral drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), followed by active immunization with HBsAg-HBsAb (mYIC) was evaluated. Findings: A single G12 injection rapidly cleared serum HBsAg in HDI-HBV carrier mice, with a synergistic effect in decreasing viral DNA load when TDF was given orally. When both serum viral DNA and HBsAg load became low or undetectable, mYIC was administered. A more effective clearance of viral DNA and HBsAg was observed and serum HBsAb was developed only in these "sandwich"-treated mice. Efficient intrahepatic anti-HBV immune responses were also observed in these mice, including the formation of aggregates of myeloid cells with CD8 + T cells and increased TNF-Î±, granzyme B production. The "sandwich" combination therapy not only efficiently decreased HBsAg and HBV DNA levels but also induced effective cellular and humoral immunity, which may result in functional cure of CHB. Research in context section Persistence of HBV cccDNA and various host immune defects were shown as the two main obstacles for HBV clearance. Blocking a single target will not be sufficient to achieve functional cure of CHB.

Therapeutic vaccination for CHB showed substantial efficacy. A humanized HBsAb G12 could efficiently block HBV infection and decrease HBsAg level in mice model. This research showed that when both serum viral DNA and HB-sAg load became low or undetectable by antiviral and HBsAb treatment, therapeutic vaccine (mYIC) add on induced effective, host humoral and intrahepatic cellular anti-HBV immune responses, with more rapid and efficient clearance of HBV and HBsAg.
