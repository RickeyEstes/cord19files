Altogether 821 such adults with children were interviewed. In the overall results, this group was weighted to its actual proportion of the total adult population. The cooperation rate was 75%, and the response rate was 36%. The survey whose results are reported here did not include interviews with cellphoneonly adults, which might be a possible source of non-coverage bias. Estimates from the 2006 National Health Interview Survey suggest that about one in eight American homes have only wireless (mainly cellphone) telephone service. The incidence of cellphone-only households is higher for low-income and young adults. 1 A recent study has shown that when data are weighted demographically, including a cell-only sample with a landline RDD sample produces population estimates that are nearly identical to those from the landline sample alone. 2 However, another
