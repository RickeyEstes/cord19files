vaccinia and AIDS-associated complications that culminated in death of the recruit 18 months after vaccination. In patients without underlying disease, cowpox infections manifest as self-healing diseases. However, in the absence of vaccination and among a population with increased numbers of immunocompromised persons, the risk for human poxvirus infections is increasing. Early diagnosis is essential for differentiating cowpox from illnesses and skin reactions with similar signs and symptoms, such as smallpox, monkeypox, generalized vaccinia virus infection, disseminated herpes zoster and herpes simplex virus infections, drug-associated eruptions, erythema multiforme, enterovirus infections, secondary syphilis, scabies, insect bites, impetigo, and molluscum contagiosum. The oral drug tecovirimat (previously known as ST-246), as well as cidofovir, CMX-001 (an antiviral substance), and vaccinia immune globulin, should be considered for use as postexposure therapeutic treatment for orthopoxvirus disease (10).
