A metatranscriptomic study of RNA viruses in cold-blooded vertebrates identified two related viruses from frogfish (Antennarius striatus) that represent a new genus Antennavirus in the family Arenaviridae (Order: Bunyavirales). Computational analyses were used to identify features common to class I viral fusion proteins (VFPs) in antennavirus glycoproteins, including an N-terminal fusion peptide, two extended alpha-helices, an intrahelical loop, and a carboxyl terminal transmembrane domain. Like mammarenavirus and hartmanivirus glycoproteins, the antennavirus glycoproteins have an intracellular zinc-binding domain and a long virion-associated stable signal peptide (SSP). The glycoproteins of reptarenaviruses are also class I VFPs, but do not contain zinc-binding domains nor do they encode SSPs. Divergent evolution from a common progenitor potentially explains similarities of antennavirus, mammarenavirus, and hartmanivirus glycoproteins, with an ancient recombination event resulting in a divergent reptarenavirus glycoprotein. Viruses 2019, 11, 750 2 of 15 disease (IBD) spreads among boid snakes (boas and pythons) in captivity [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Bacterial infections, neurological pathology, anorexia, and withering that result in death of the snakes are characteristics of IBD. Further metagenomic analyses identified numerous genetically diverse arenaviruses from captive snakes [21, 25, 26] . Two genera, Reptarenavirus and Hartmanivirus, were established in the Arenaviridae to include the snake arenaviruses [1, 27, 28] . While sometimes present in healthy snakes, reptarenaviruses are the causative agent of IBD [20, 29, 30] , whereas hartmaniviruses have not been shown to cause disease [25] . With the discovery of these new arenaviruses, NW and OW arenaviruses were placed taxonomically into the genus Mammarenavirus [1]. Further expansion of the Arenaviridae was necessitated based on results of an extraordinary large-scale metatranscriptomic study of RNA viruses in cold-blooded vertebrates that identified two arenaviruses from frogfish (Antennarius striatus) among hundreds of novel viruses [31] . Based on sequence similarity and phylogenetic analyses, Wēnlǐng frogfish arenavirus-1 (WlFAV-1, striated antennavirus) and Wēnlǐng frogfish arenavirus-2 (WlFAV-2, hairy antennavirus) represent a new genus, Antennavirus [32]. Genetic differences are apparent when comparing the mammalian, reptilian, and fish arenaviruses. Mammarenaviruses, reptarenaviruses, and hartmaniviruses have bi-segmented genomes [33] . The small segment is ambisense and encodes the glycoprotein complex (GPC) and the nucleocapsid protein (NP). The large segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and, in mammarenaviruses and reptarenaviruses in which the segment is ambisense, a zinc-binding or matrix protein (Z). Sequencing of the genome of the prototype hartmanivirus, Haartman Institute snake virus (HISV), showed that this virus does not encode a Z protein [26] . This unexpected result was confirmed in subsequent isolates of related hartmaniviruses that also lack a gene encoding Z [25] . Z participates in several processes in the virus replication cycle, including the formation of infectious viral particles and viral budding [34] , indicating that hartmaniviruses utilize alternative mechanisms. In contrast, the frogfish arenavirus contains three genome segments [31] . The LASV GPC is a trimer of heterodimers, each containing receptor-binding glycoprotein 1 (GP1) and a transmembrane fusion protein GP2 [35] . LASV also encodes an unusual long stable signal peptide (SSP) that is required for proper processing of GPC and is retained in the virion as part of the complex. The GPC precursor is trafficked from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, where it is heavily N-glycosidated and processed by cellular proteases (SPase, SKI1/SP1) into its mature form comprising non-covalently linked GP1, GP2, and SSP. Reptarenavirus L and NP proteins share 17%-26% pairwise amino acid identity with the L and NP proteins of OW and NW mammarenaviruses [18, 33] . However, the reptarenavirus glycoproteins did not contain similarity to other arenavirus glycoproteins detectable by commonly used search programs. Instead, reptarenavirus glycoproteins were related to the glycoproteins of filoviruses (e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses), avian retroviruses (e.g., avian leukosis virus), and cellular syncytin, the product of a repurposed endogenous retroviral gene [18] . No similarities with arenavirus or filovirus glycoproteins or other proteins could be detected for the putative glycoprotein sequence of the frogfish arenaviruses, whereas antennavirus L and NP proteins show homology to L and NP proteins of other arenaviruses [31, 33] . Here, we examine the amino acid sequences of proteins encoded by the newly described arenaviruses using computational tools that have previously proven potent in identifying structural features of viral fusion proteins [36-41]. Materials and Methods GenBank accession numbers of the arenavirus and filovirus proteins used for sequence and structural analyses are provided in Table S1 . Viruses 2019, 11, 750 3 of 15 Pairwise alignments were performed using William Pearson's Lalign program [42] that implements the algorithm of Huang and Miller [43] . To generate alignments between multiple sequences we used Clustal Omega, a part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) search and sequence analysis tool kit that uses seeded guide trees and hidden Markov model (HMM) profile-profile techniques [44] . Secondary structure, solvent accessibility, transmembrane helices, globular regions, coiled-coil regions, and other protein features were analyzed using PredictProtein [45] . Domains with significant propensity to form transmembrane helices were identified with TMpred v. 1.0 [46] . TMpred is based on a statistical analysis of TMbase, a database of naturally occurring transmembrane glycoproteins [47] . Topology and other features of membrane proteins were explored by means of hydropathy plots with the Membrane Protein Explorer from the Stephen White laboratory [48] . The presence of signal peptides and the location of their cleavage sites was analyzed using SignalP (v5.0), which is based on deep convolutional and recurrent neural network architecture including a conditional random field [49] . O-linked glycosylation sites were predicted by Net-O-Glyc v. 4.0, which produces neural network predictions of mucin-type GalNAc O-glycosylation sites in mammalian proteins [50] .
