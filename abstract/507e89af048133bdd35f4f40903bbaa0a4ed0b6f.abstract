Keeping the potential synergy of biological activity of synthetic anomalous derivatives of deazapurines and L-ascorbic acid (L-AA) in mind, we have synthesized new 3-, 7-and 9-deazapurine derivatives of Lascorbic (1e4, 8e10, 13e15) and imino-L-ascorbic acid (5e7, 11, 12, 16e19). These novel compounds were evaluated for their cytostatic and antiviral activity in vitro against a panel of human malignant tumour cell lines and normal murine fibroblasts (3T3). Among all evaluated compounds, the 9-deazapurine derivative of L-AA (13) exerted the most potent inhibitory activity on the growth of CEM/0 cells (IC 50 ¼ 4.1 ± 1.8 mM) and strong antiproliferative effect against L1210/0 (IC 50 ¼ 4.7 ± 0.1 mM) while the 9deazahypoxanthine derivative of L-AA (15) showed the best effect against HeLa cells (IC 50 ¼ 5.6 ± 1.3 mM) and prominent effect on L1210/0 (IC 50 ¼ 4.5 ± 0.5 mM). Furthermore, the 9-deazapurine derivative disubstituted with two imino-L-AA moieties (18) showed the best activity against L1210/0 tumour cells (IC 50 ¼ 4.4 ± 0.3 mM) and the most pronounced antiproliferative effects against MiaPaCa-2 cells (IC 50 ¼ 5.7 ± 0.2 mM). All these compounds showed selective cytostatic effect on tumour cell lines in comparison with embryonal murine fibroblasts (3T3). When evaluating their antiviral activity, the 3deazapurine derivative of L-AA (3) exhibited the highest activity against both laboratory-adapted strains of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (AD-169 and Davis) with EC 50 values comparable to those of the well-known anti-HCMV drug ganciclovir and without cytotoxic effects on normal human embryonal lung (HEL) cells.
