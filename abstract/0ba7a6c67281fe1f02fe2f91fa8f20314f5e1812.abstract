A. Pumfery et al. Proteomics of viruses Therefore, in this chapter we will discuss some recent findings on the proteomics of DNA and RNA viral infections that are associated with clinically important diseases in humans, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C (HBV and HCV, respectively), and adenovirus, as well as the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). HCMV is the largest member of the human herpesviruses. After initial infection, HCMV remains in a persistent state with the host [2] . Immunity against the virus controls replication, although intermittent viral shedding can still take place in the seropositive immunocompetent person [2] . As replication of cytomegalovirus in the absence of an effective immune response is central to the pathogenesis of disease, complications are primarily seen in individuals whose immune system is immature or suppressed by drug treatment or coinfection with other pathogens [3] . Estimates of the coding capacity of HCMV range from 160 open reading frames (ORFs) to more than 200 ORFs [4] . Recent studies using MS to determine the viral proteome suggest that the number of viral proteins may be even greater than previous estimates [5] . Analysis of proteins from purified HCMV virion preparations has indicated that the particle contains significantly more viral proteins than the previously known 71 HCMV virion proteins. Twelve of the identified proteins were encoded by known viral ORFs previously not associated with virions, and 12 proteins were from novel viral ORFs [6] . Therefore, new protein markers including HCMV tegument and various cellular structural proteins, enzymes, and chaperones are now serving as biomarkers for HCMV infection and as possible drug targets. Other herpesvirus members have also been explored for the presence of possible biomarkers. EBV is a ubiquitous member of the herpesvirus family that is associated with a variety of lymphomas and lymphoproliferative diseases [7] . It encodes a multitude of genes that drive proliferation or confer resistance to cell death [8] . Infection of human B lymphocytes with EBV induces proliferative B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Recently, proteomic profiles of three LCLs were analyzed comparatively at the early and the late passages of cell culture. The phosphoprotein stathmin was identified, and expression significantly decreased with immortalization of LCLs [9]. Stathmin is critically important not only for the formation of a normal mitotic spindle upon entry into mitosis but also for the regulation of the function of the mitotic spindle in the later stages of mitosis and for the timely exit from mitosis [9] . In another study using standard matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) methods, 20 EBNA2 target proteins were identified, 11 of which were c-myc dependent and therefore most probably associated with proliferation of the host cell [10]. These findings further stress the role of EBV viral proteins, namely EBNA and LMP, in disease pathogenesis. Interestingly, when EBV-infected cells were treated with the drug 5Ðˆ-azacytidine (AZC)-a demethylating agent that induces the expression of silenced genes, i.e., the p16 tumor suppressor gene-21 polypeptides were down-regulated, while 312 A.
