Epitope-based vaccines designed to induce cellular immune response and antibody responses specific for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) are being developed as a means for increasing vaccine potency. In this study, we selected seven epitopes from the spike (S1), spike (S2), and nucleocapsid (N) protein and constructed a multi-epitope DNA vaccine. The 7-day-old chickens were immunized intramuscularly with multi-epitope DNA vaccine encapsulated by liposome and boosted two weeks later, and were challenged by virulent IBV strain five weeks post booster. The results showed that multi-epitope DNA vaccine led to a dramatic augmentation of humoral and cellular responses, and provided up to 80.0% rate of immune protection. The novel immunogenic chimeric multi-epitope DNA vaccine revealed in this study provided a new candidate target for IBV vaccine development. Ó 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the primary causes of respiratory disease in domestic fowl. Infection with IBV reduces the performance of broilers and in laying birds drops in egg production and egg quality can occur [1]. Vaccines against infectious bronchitis applied in the field have respective weakness. Live attenuated vaccine has a strong probability of spreading of the vaccine virus [2]; inactivated vaccine does not elicit enough immune response against coronavirus [3, 4] , and shows severe side effect and long-lasting local response after inoculation. The construction of conventional DNA vaccine has to be based on integral antigen gene, and only one or two gene at the most can be constructed into one plasmid, so its immune protection is imperfect. However, epitope-based DNA vaccine breaks through such weakness of traditional DNA vaccine. It can not only elicit favourable immunoreactivity, but also has no risk of gene integrating into host cell [5] . The IBV encodes four major structural proteins, known as spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and envelope (E) protein. The S protein is post-translationally cleaved into the outer S1 and the membrane bound S2 proteins. S1 protein comprises major antigenic determinants that induce neutralizing Abs which makes it a major target for vaccine design and immune therapy [6-9]. S2 protein is conserved and comprises epitopes inducing cross-reactive Abs and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses. N protein is also largely conserved, and contains epitopes which induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses and also protection, as well as activating B cell responses [10] [11] [12] . In this paper, seven dominant epitopes corresponding to four regions in the S1, one in the S2, and two in the N protein were selected according to previous references as well as computer bioinformatics software. The selected epitopes contained both B-cell epitopes that were essential for protective antibody response and T-cell epitopes that would serve to induce CTL response. The corresponding epitope minigenes were combined together and constructed as a multi-epitope chimeric DNA vaccine, then we investigated the cellular and humoral immunity induced by the multi-epitope vaccine and its protective effect in chickens. Virus, experimental animals, and cells. The specific-pathogenfree (SPF) chicken embryos were purchased from Shangdong Institute of Poultry Science, Shandong, PR China. Chickens were hatched and housed in a SPF environment at the Laboratory Animal and Resources Facility, Sichuan University. The nephro-pathogenic IBV SAIBk strain was propagated in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs, and then harvested allantoic fluid 36 h post-inoculation. The 50% chicken infection dose (EID 50 ) was determined by inoculating serial 10-fold dilutions of virus into 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 lg/mL streptomycin at pH 7.2 and were kept at 37°C with 5% carbon dioxide. Multi-epitope genes selection. The nucleinic acid sequences of S1, S2 and N gene of the IBV SAIBk strain were obtained from GenBank 0006-291X/$ -see front matter Ó
