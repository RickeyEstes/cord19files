Objectives: In places of mass gathering, rapid infection screening prior to definite diagnosis is vital during the epidemic season of a novel influenza. In order to assess the possibility of clinical application of a newly developed non-contact infection screening system, we conducted screening for influenza patients. Materials and methods: The system is operated by a screening program via a linear discriminant analysis using non-contact derived variables, i.e., palmar pulse derived from a laser Doppler blood-flow meter, respiration rate determined by a 10-GHz microwave radar, and average facial temperature measured by thermography. The system was tested on 57 seasonal influenza (2008e2009) patients (35.7 C body temperature 38.3 C, 19e40 years) and 35 normal control subjects (35.5 C body temperature 36.9 C, 21e35 years) at the Japan Self-defense Forces Central Hospital. Results: A significant linear discriminant function (p < 0.001) was determined to distinguish the influenza group from the control group (Mahalanobis D-square Z 6.5, classification error rate > 10%). The system had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 93%, which is higher than the PPV value (PPV 65.4%) reported in the recent summary of studies using only thermography performed mainly in hospitals.
