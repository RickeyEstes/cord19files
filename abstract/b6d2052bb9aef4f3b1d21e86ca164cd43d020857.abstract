The human microbiome, described as an accessory organ because of the crucial functions it 24 provides, is composed of species that are uniquely found in humans 1,2 . Yet, surprisingly little is known 25 about the impact of routine interpersonal contacts in shaping microbiome composition. In a relatively 26 'closed' cohort of 287 people from the Fiji Islands, where common barriers to bacterial transmission are 27 absent, we examine putative bacterial transmission in individuals' gut and oral microbiomes using strain-28 level data from both core SNPs and flexible genomic regions. We find a weak signal of transmission, 29 defined by the inferred sharing of genotypes, across many organisms that, in aggregate, reveals strong 30 transmission patterns, most notably within households and between spouses. We find that women harbor 31 strains more closely related to those harbored by their familial and social contacts than men; and that 32 transmission patterns of oral-and gut-associated microbiota need not be the same. Using strain-level data 33 alone, we are able to confidently predict a subset of spouses, highlighting the role of shared 34 susceptibilities, behaviors or social interactions that distinguish specific links in the social network.
