This paper incorporates deflation in an analysis of the relationship between the exchange rate passthrough and inflation. Using a nonlinear model based on monthly data of Taiwan's import prices from 1981 to 2008, we find that the degree of exchange rate pass-through is increasing in deflation. The increase becomes smaller when the price of oil is excluded. Evidence for pass-through increasing in deflation has not previously been found in the existing literature and presents a new understanding of the pricing behavior of firms. Poor profits in deflation cause firms to pass through most of the cost of exchange rate changes to their products to avoid exiting the market. (C.-S. Wu). 1 In Taylor (2000), higher exchange rate pass-through results from persistent cost changes under high inflation, based on a staggered price setting model. As firms set prices several periods in advance, their prices are more responsive to cost increases if cost changes are perceived to be more persistent. According to the US data provided in the paper, regimes with higher inflation tend to have more persistent costs such that higher inflation increases the degree of exchange rate pass-through. 1059-0560/$see front matter
