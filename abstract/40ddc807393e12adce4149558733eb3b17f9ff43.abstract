Among the external secretions, milk is unique in its complexity and high concentrations of mucosal immune products. This chapter explores the nature of that uniqueness and attempts to explain its basis. Throughout the chapter, we emphasize human milk since it differs significantly from that of other nonprimate species. However, because bovine milk commonly is consumed by humans, particularly infants and children, we contrast human and bovine milk when major differences are known. The immunological outcomes of breast-feeding in the infant are discussed in Chapter 52. The high degree of complexity of human milk, relative to the other external secretions, apparently has evolved to provide key factors for the nutritional, metabolic, and immunological needs of the infant. If the lactating woman is nourished adequately, her milk will contain essentially all the nutrients required by the infant for at least the first 6 months of life. In addition, many immunological factors are present in human milk, presumably to protect the lactating mammary gland and the nursing infant from pathogenic microorganisms. The immunological constituents of milk must enhance the probability that maternally derived nutrients will be transferred to the infant without contamination or degradation, so they can be used optimally for the growth and development of the infant. Another source of complexity of human milk is the dynamic change in composition that occurs during lactation. In this sense, milk is really a series of secretions that is produced as lactation progresses and the infant matures. An interesting speculation is that the changes in milk composition are timed to respond to changing needs of the infant, whose own mucosal immune system is developing rapidly. In trying to understand the function of the immunological factors in milk, we must recognize that the in vivo fate and functions have been demonstrated to date for a limited number of the factors. In particular, limited information exists concerning the distribution, survival, and function of immunological factors within the infant. Finally, evidence suggests that the immunological impact on the infant of the feeding of human milk may not be totally passive in nature. Some milk factors may interact with factors produced by the infant, whereas others may act as stimuli for the development of the infant's own mucosal immune system. Thus, milk may be part of a dynamic mother-infant interaction that supports the newborn infant's growth and immunological development to a level that enhances the chances of survival in the extrauterine environment. The human mammary gland is a compound tubuloalveolar organ. The glandular secretions empty into ducts that coalesce as they course through the stroma of the breast toward the nipple. During pregnancy, the number and size of the alveolar clusters increase until, at parturition, 70% of the gland is composed of parenchymal tissue. The process of lactation is modulated by hormones including prolactin, insulin, and growth hormone. The release of some of these hormones, particularly prolactin, is triggered by a neurosensory-endocrine pathway that is initiated by nursing. The autocrine and paracrine events that control lactation remain poorly defined. Four pathways exists for the secretion of milk components. The first one is responsible for secretion of many of the aqueous components of milk including casein, a-lactalbumin, and lactose. Caseins, after translation, are transferred to the Golgi apparatus, where they are phosphorylated or glycosylated. As these proteins pass from the terminal cisternae of the Golgi compartment into secretory vesicles, their concentration increases to the millimolar range, causing aggregation of the casein molecules into micelles (Morr et al., 1971) . The secretory vesicles migrate to the apical membrane, fuse with it, and release their contents by exocytosis. One prominent milk protein, รก-lactalbumin, forms a complex with the enzyme galactosyltransferase in the Golgi, where the complex catalyze the synthesis of lactose. The osmotic activity of this disaccharide draws water and presumably ions into the Golgi, providing the driving force for fluid secretion. The second or apocrine pathway is responsible for secre-
