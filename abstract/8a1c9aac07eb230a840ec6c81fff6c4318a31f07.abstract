KEYWORDS Necrotizing enterocolitis Microbiome Intestinal microbiota Noncultured based techniques Sequencing The intestinal microbiota normally exist in a commensal or symbiotic relationship with the host, but in the neonate, and especially in the premature infant, this relationship needs to develop. Alterations of the intestinal microbiota may predispose the preterm infant to the development of necrotizing enterocolitis. Composition and quality of the intestinal microbiota depend on many factors, such as mode of birth, type of feeding, and use of antibiotics. There are many opportunities for physicians to provide interventions that could improve the adequate colonization of the neonatal gut. Culture-based techniques are highly limited, but the development of new molecular technologies to study previously unidentified organisms has enhanced our understanding of the microbial environment that may predispose to necrotizing enterocolitis.
