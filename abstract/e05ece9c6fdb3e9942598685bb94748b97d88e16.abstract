The rapid and escalating spread of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 6 poses an immediate public health emergency, and no approved therapeutics or 7 vaccines are currently available. The viral spike protein S binds ACE2 on host cells to 8 initiate molecular events that release the viral genome intracellularly. Soluble ACE2 9 inhibits entry of both SARS and SARS-2 coronaviruses by acting as a decoy for S 10 binding sites, and is a candidate for therapeutic and prophylactic development. Using deep mutagenesis, variants of ACE2 are identified with increased binding to 12 the receptor binding domain of S at a cell surface. Mutations are found across the 13 interface and also at buried sites where they are predicted to enhance folding and 14 presentation of the interaction epitope. The N90-glycan on ACE2 hinders association. The mutational landscape offers a blueprint for engineering high affinity ACE2 16 receptors to meet this unprecedented challenge.
