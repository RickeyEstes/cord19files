Crossbred calves (n = 350; average BW 240 ± 1 kg) were obtained from regional livestock auctions. Within each set (block, n = 4), calves were stratified by BW and arrival sex into 1 of 8, 0.42-ha pens (10 to 12 calves per pen). Pens were assigned randomly = 3 pens per block) sources. During the 42-to 45-d backgrounding period calves had ad libitum access to bermudagrass hay and were fed corn and dried distillers grain-based supplements that served as carrier for the treatments. After removal of data for chronic (n = 6) and deceased (n = 1) calves, tracemineral source had no effect on final or intermediate BW (P = 0.86) or ADG (P ≥ 0.24). With all data included in the analysis, dietary treatments had no effect on the number treated once (P = 0.93), twice (P = 0.71), or 3 times (P = 0.53) for bovine respiratory disease or on the number of calves classified as chronic (P = 0.55). Based on these results, tracemineral source had no effect on total BW gain, ADG, or morbidity during the receiving phase in shipping-stressed cattle.
