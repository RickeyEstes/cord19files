Proliferation of central nervous system (CNS) gila in response .to peripheral nerve injury occurs without apparent participation of cells of the immune system. It is shown here that following transection of the rat facial nerve there is strongly elevated expression of class I, and to a lesser extent, class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the facial nucieus. It is demonstrated by double-immtmofluorescence studies that the cells responsible for increased le~els o~' MHC class I antigens are endogenous brain microglia. These findings emphasize the thought that micro~, are inununocompetent cells, but, at the same time, raise the possibility for a non-immunological function of MHC antigens under conditions of neural regeneration.
