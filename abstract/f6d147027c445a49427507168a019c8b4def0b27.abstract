Avian infl uenza A H5N1 presents a serious and possibly imminent pandemic threat. In such an event, adequate supplies of aff ordable vaccines and antiviral agents will be unavailable to most people in the world. In view of the overwhelming need for eff ective alternatives, generic agents that target the host immune response or the pandemic virus should be considered. Many scientists doubt the eff ectiveness of these agents. Nonetheless, several studies suggest that statins improve outcomes in patients with bacteraemia and pneumonia and might be similarly eff ective against infl uenza. An experimental study has shown that the fi brate gemfi brozil, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) Î± agonist, reduces mortality in H2N2 infl uenza virus-infected mice. There is substantial molecular cross-talk between statins and PPAR agonists, and their clinical eff ects are additive in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Chloroquine increases endosomal pH, impairing infl uenza virus release into the cytosol. Statins, fi brates, and chloroquine are produced as generic medications in developing countries. They are inexpensive, could be stockpiled, and would be available on the fi rst pandemic day. With a lack of realistic alternatives for confronting the next pandemic, research is urgently needed to determine whether these and other generic agents could mitigate the eff ects of what might otherwise become an unprecedented global public-health crisis.
