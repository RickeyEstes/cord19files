Background. -Telemedicine has several applications regarding different medical specialties or clinical situations. However, telemedicine as a potential tool during epidemics is not as well considered. Methods. -In this paper, the application of telemedicine is conceptualised using five possible evidence-based epidemic situations. Results. -The first situation corresponds to asymptomatic individuals, mainly home-based, living in an epidemic-affected location. The application of telemedicine would be through the use of teleconsultation for emergency medical dispatching and would occur when suspicious symptoms are detected by an individual. The second situation for the application of telemedicine is principally home-based and corresponds to the follow-up telemonitoring of asymptomatic individuals identified as case contacts.
