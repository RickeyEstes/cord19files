Heterogeneity in disease transmission is widespread and, when not accounted for, can 12 produce unpredictable outbreaks of infectious disease. Despite this, precisely how 13 different sources of variation in host traits drive heterogeneity in disease transmission is 14 poorly understood. Here we dissected the sources of variation in pathogen transmission 15 using Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila C Virus as a host-pathogen model 16 system. We found that infected lifespan, viral growth, virus shedding, and viral load at 17 death were all significantly influenced by fly genetic background, sex and female mating 18 status. To understand how variation in each of these traits may generate heterogeneity 19 in disease transmission, we estimated individual transmission potential by integrating 20 data on virus shedding and lifespan alongside previously collected data on social 21 aggregation. We found that ~15% of between-individual heterogeneity in disease 22 transmission was explained by a significant interaction between genetic and sex-specific 23 variation. We also characterised the amount of variation in viral load, virus shedding, and 24 lifespan following infection that could be explained by genetic background and sex. 25 Amongst the determinants of individual variation in disease transmission these sources 26 of host variation play roles of varying importance, with genetic background generally 27 playing the largest role. Our results highlight the importance of characterising sources of 28 variation in multiple host traits when studying disease transmission at the individual-level. 29 30
