Objective: It has been documented that ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) phosphorylation by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Rho/ROCK, and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways leads to filamentous actin (F-actin) reorganization and microvascular endothelial cell hyperpermeability. In this study, we investigated the effects of Xijiao Dihuang Decoction combined with Yinqiao Powder (XDY) on influenza virus (IV)-induced F-actin restructuring and ERM phosphorylation regulated by the Rho/Rho kinase 1 (ROCK), p38 MAPK, and PKC signaling pathways in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs). Methods: Serum containing XDY (XDY-CS; 13.8 g/kg) was acquired using standard protocols for serum pharmacology. Primary PMVECs were obtained from male Wistar rats and cultured. After adsorption of IV A (multiplicity of infection, 0.01) for 1 h, medium with 20% XDY-CS was added to the PMVECs. The distributions of F-actin and phosphorylated ERM were determined by confocal microscopy, and F-actin expression was measured by flow cytometry. The expression levels of ROCK1, phosphorylated myosin phosphatase target-subunit
