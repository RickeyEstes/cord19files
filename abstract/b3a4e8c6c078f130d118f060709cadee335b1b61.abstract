and to DNA templates of a more complex nature, e.g., Polymerase chain reaction has been applied to the human genomic DNA and mitochondrial DNA (1-5). amplification of long DNA fragments from a variety of PCR, combined with reverse transcription (RT), is also sources, including genomic, mitochondrial, and viral a suitable method for the amplification of DNA from DNAs. However, polymerase chain reaction amplifica-RNA templates. However the application of RT-PCR to tion from cDNA templates produced by reverse tranthe generation of long DNA products remains problemscription has generally been restricted to products of atic. Thus, only a few reports describe RT-PCR protoless than 10 kilobases. In this paper, we report a system cols that enable the amplification of DNAs longer than to effectively amplify fragments up to 20 kilobases about 7 kilobases (kb) (6-10). Most probably the integfrom human coronavirus 229E genomic RNA. We demrity and purity of RNA templates and the reverse tranonstrate that the integrity of the RNA template and scription reaction are the critical parameters prior to the prevention of false priming events during reverse the amplification of the cDNA. In this paper we report experiments that describe the synthesis of long cDNAs. The optimization of the the parameters critical in producing RT-PCR products polymerase chain reaction conditions enabled us to of up to 20 kb. We focused on the requirements of the improve the specificity and yield of product but they RNA template, the reverse transcription reaction, and were not definitive. Finally, we have shown that the the amplification of the cDNA by PCR. To carry out same reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction these studies, we used the genomic RNA of the human technology can be used for the amplification of excoronavirus HCV 229E as template (11). The HCV tended regions of the dystrophin mRNA, a cellular 229E genomic RNA has an approximate length of RNA of relatively low abundance. ᭧ 1997 Academic Press 27,000 nucleotides (nt) and the homogeneity of the RNA can be readily visualized by hybridization analysis (12). Finally, we have shown that in addition to Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 2 and related techviral RNAs, which are relatively abundant in the inniques have become an almost indispensable tool in fected cell, cellular mRNAs, such as the dystrophin biological research and medicine. Consequently, there mRNA, also represent suitable templates for the generis a constant effort to improve the sensitivity and speciation of long DNA products by RT-PCR. ficity of the procedure and to extend the application of PCR and related techniques to an increasing range MATERIALS AND METHODS of problems.
