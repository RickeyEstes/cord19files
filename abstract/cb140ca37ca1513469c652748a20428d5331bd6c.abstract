Patients with severe burn injuries are extremely susceptible to infection, and the host's antibacterial responses are frequently suppressed by alternatively activated macrophages (M2Mf), commonly demonstrated in these patients. An immunosuppressive subset of neutrophils (PMN-II), demonstrated in the peripheral blood of thermally injured patients, has been described as an inducer of M2Mf. In the present studies, the inhibitory effect of glycyrrhizin (GL) on M2Mf generation stimulated by PMN-II was examined. M2Mf were generated from resident Mf (R-Mf, lower chamber) after cultivation with PMN-II (upper chamber) in a dual-chamber transwell. However, M2Mf were not generated from R-Mf when the same transwell cultures were performed in the presence of GL. M2Mf were not generated from R-Mf after cultivation with PMN-II previously treated with GL, while R-Mf previously treated with GL converted to M2Mf after they were cultured with PMN-II in transwells. Interleukin-10 and CCL2 released from PMN-II were shown to be effector molecules responsible for the generation of M2Mf. However, these soluble factors were not produced by PMN-II treated with GL. These results indicate that GL inhibits PMN-II-stimulated M2Mf generation through the inhibition of CCL2/interleukin-10 production by PMN-II.
