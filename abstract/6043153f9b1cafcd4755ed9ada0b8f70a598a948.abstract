KEYWORDS Influenza Respiratory viruses Bacterial pneumonia Innate immunity Interferons Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide. Influenza and other respiratory viral infections often predispose individuals to a more severe clinical course with greater morbidity and mortality than bacterial pneumonia alone. Postviral bacterial pneumonia is mediated by complex interactions between viruses, normal nasopharyngeal bacterial flora, and the host immune system. Current management strategies are largely directed toward influenza vaccination and selection of appropriate antimicrobial agents. Novel diagnostic tests and therapies that address the complex pathogenesis of postviral bacterial pneumonias are needed to mitigate this potentially serious complication, particularly given the ongoing threat of influenza pandemics.
