Our purpose was to investigate possible interrelations between antibody liters against seven viruses (measles, rubella, herpes simplex, mumps, varicella-zoster, coronavirus, cytomegalovirus), HLA-class II antigens, and immunoglobulin Gm allotypes in multiple sclerosis (MS). We studied 57 MS patients and 59 controls with similar age and sex distributions. In MS patients, we found the classical increased frequency of HLA-DR2, HLA-DQwl and also an excess of Gm (3; -+23; 5+). Mumps antibody levels were higher in MS patients than in controls; elevation was not significant for measles antibodies. Analysis suggests that an association ABBREVIATIONS Gm heavy chain immunoglobin G From INSERM U.169, Villejuif (A.A.; C.B.), INSERM U.IO0 (A.
