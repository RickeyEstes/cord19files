The increasing availability of nucleic acid amplification tests since the 1980s has revolutionised our understanding of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory aspects of known and novel viral respiratory pathogens. High-throughput, multiplex polymerase chain reaction is the most commonly used qualitative detection method, but utilisation of newer techniques such as next-generation sequencing will become more common following significant cost reductions. Rapid and readily accessible isothermal amplification platforms have also allowed molecular diagnostics to be used in a 'point-of-care' format. This review focuses on the current applications and limitations of molecular diagnosis for respiratory viruses. Although imperfect, high throughput, multiplex NAAT assays targeting different viruses are likely to be the most commonly used method for the diagnosis of viral respiratory infections in the short to medium term. Nucleic acid extraction-independent and LAMP assays are promising, but are limited by the range of viruses that can be detected and the performance of LAMP assays remains suboptimal compared to RT-PCR at present. In the near future, diagnostic virology laboratories will face increasing pressures to provide specific viral aetiologies of respiratory infections within clinically relevant timeframes to facilitate targeted antiviral therapy.
