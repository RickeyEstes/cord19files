Methods: Data were obtained from the Shenzhen Program for Syphilis Prevention and Control in 2014-2017. Blood samples were screened using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and confirmed using the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA) and toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST). : Among 394 792 blood donors, 733 were TPPA and TRUST positive, and 728 were only TPPA positive. The overall prevalence of syphilis infection was 370.1 per 100 000 [95% confidence interval (CI), 351.1-389.0 per 100 000]; the prevalence of active infection was 185.7 per 100 000 (95% CI, 172.2-199.1 per 100 000). People aged ≥45 years displayed a prevalence of 621.8 per 100 000 in syphilis infection and 280 .5 per 100 000 in active infection, which were 3.8 times and 2.4 times higher than that for people aged <25 years. The prevalence of syphilis infection (χ 2 trend = 311.9, p trend < 0.001) and active infection (χ 2 trend = 72.1, p trend < 0.001) increased significantly with age. After stratification of gender and year of donation , the increasing trend of prevalence with age remained(p trend < 0.05), except for the prevalence of active infection in males (χ 2 trend = 0.923, p trend = 0.337) and females (χ 2 trend = 0.224, p trend = 0.636) in 2014. About 16.3% of patients aged ≥45 years had a TRUST titre of ≥1∶8, lower than that of patients aged <25 years (51.3%) and 25-34 years (34.1%). The findings confirm the high prevalence of syphilis among older adults, and suggest the need to increase awareness among healthcare providers and deliver more-targeted prevention interventions for older adults to promote early testing.
