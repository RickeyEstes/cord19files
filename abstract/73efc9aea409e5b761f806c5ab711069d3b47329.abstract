Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is caused by a calicivirus and is characterized by fulminant hepatitis with a fatality rate of more than 90% in adult rabbits. It is not present in the United States. It is spread by direct contact between rabbits, by flies feeding on carcasses, and experimentally by fleas and mosquitoes. A single-dose vaccination of inactivated virus at 8 to 12 weeks followed by an annual booster is generally protective. Myxomatosis is a lethal, generalized viral disease of rabbits. It is endemic in wild rabbit populations and in Sylvilagus spp. It commonly occurs in the Pacific states of the United States in warmer months. The virus is spread passively on the mouthparts of mosquitoes and fleas. Outbreaks in farmed, laboratory, and pet rabbits result from spillover in wild rabbit populations. A single-dose vaccination of inactivated virus at 8 to 12 weeks followed by an annual booster is generally protective. Rabbit fibroma virus is endemic in Sylvilagus spp in North America. It is spread by mosquitoes and causes a cutaneous fibroma at the inoculation site with no systemic signs of disease. The fibroma generally regresses within 3 to 4 weeks of infection. It is one of the most common causes of cutaneous neoplasms in pet rabbits. Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus, also known as Shope papillomavirus, is a cause of papillomas (warts) on nonhaired or thinly haired skin of rabbits. In 66% to 80% of infected rabbits, papillomas develop into carcinomas 8 to 14 months later. The virus is spread from Sylvilagus spp to rabbits by mosquitoes. Infection is uncommon. Rabbit oral papillomavirus occurs naturally in rabbits and is widespread among domestic rabbits in Europe and the Americas, particularly young animals. The papillomas are localized mostly on the underside of the tongue and usually regress spontaneously within a few weeks to a few months. The multifactorial enteritis complex of juvenile rabbits can be caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Several different viruses have been isolated from rabbits with diarrhea, such as rotavirus, coronavirus, and astrovirus. Whether natural outbreaks of enteritis can be caused by these viral agents alone or in conjunction with other pathogens (eg, Clostridia spp, Escherichia coli, and coccidia) is not clear.
