The identification of a novel b coronavirus, nCoV, as the causative agent of severe respiratory illness in humans originating in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan has raised concerns about the possibility of a coronavirus pandemic similar to that of SARS-CoV. As a definitive treatment regimen has never been thoroughly evaluated for coronavirus infections, there is an urgent need to rapidly identify potential therapeutics to address future cases of nCoV. To determine an intervention strategy, the effect of interferon-a2b and ribavirin on nCoV isolate hCoV-EMC/2012 replication in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells was evaluated. hCoV-EMC/2012 was sensitive to both interferon-a2b and ribavirin alone in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells, but only at relatively high concentrations; however, when combined, lower concentrations of interferon-a2b and ribavirin achieved comparable endpoints. Thus, a combination of interferon-a2b and ribavirin, which are already commonly used in the clinic, may be useful for patient management in the event of future nCoV infections. A novel b coronavirus (nCoV), has been identified as the etiological agent of 17 confirmed cases (11 deaths) of a severe respiratory illness with occasional renal failure from patients in Saudi Arabia 1 , Qatar 2 , Jordan and the United Kingdom 3,4 . Complete genome sequencing 1,5 determined that this new virus is closely related to two Asian bat betacoronaviruses (HKU4 and HKU5) 6 in lineage C. This makes nCoV the first lineage C betacoronavirus known to infect humans 5 . While human-to-human transmission is assumed to be less extensive as compared to SARS-CoV, three of the cases in Saudi Arabia were within one family and several healthcare workers who cared for two of the cases in Jordan have been classified as probable cases 5 . Moreover, in the most recent cluster of cases 7 , two of the three cases did not have a history of travel to the Middle East, but are suspected to have resulted from human-to-human transmission within the UK from a family member with a travel history to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. This would suggest that human-to-human transmission can occur in close contact settings. Presumably, the sporadic nature of the apparently unlinked index cases in three different, albeit geographically proximal countries, and the close relationship to Asian bat coronaviruses, suggests that the source of nCoV is zoonotic 8 . Despite limited information on this new virus, it has been determined that in contrast to SARS-CoV, which uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain entry into cells 9,10 , nCoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) as a functional receptor 11 . This finding may be important as the requirement for ACE2 was thought to be partially responsible for the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV, while also serving as one of the factors that may have limited spread from human-to-human. As the pathogenesis of nCoV could be significantly different from previously studied coronaviruses, the ability to predict whether this virus is likely to result in a larger epidemic or even pandemic, such as occurred with SARS-CoV, is unknown. The rapid identification of therapeutics is a high priority as there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine for nCoV and the resulting disease has been severe with a high case-fatality rate. The clinical experience from SARS suggests that a number of interventions including ribavirin with and without corticosteroids 12-14 , ribavirin with protease inhibitors 15,16 and interferon (alfacon-1) with corticosteroids 17 may improve outcome, but a definitive treatment regimen was not clearly established 18 . Here we address the effectiveness in vitro of two antiviral drugs, interferon-a2b (IFN-a2b) and ribavirin, in an attempt to identify a therapeutic approach that can be immediately utilized in the clinic to benefit future cases.
