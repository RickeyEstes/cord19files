Within the phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ) family that hydrolyzes phospholipids to yield fatty acids and lysophospholipids, secreted PLA 2 (sPLA 2 ) enzymes comprise the largest group containing 11 isoforms in mammals. Individual sPLA 2 s exhibit unique tissue or cellular distributions and enzymatic properties, suggesting their distinct biological roles. Although PLA 2 enzymes, particularly cytosolic PLA 2 (cPLA 2 Î±), have long been implicated in inflammation by driving arachidonic acid metabolism, the precise biological roles of sPLA 2 s have remained a mystery over the last few decades. Recent studies employing mice gene-manipulated for individual sPLA 2 s, in combination with mass spectrometric lipidomics to identify their target substrates and products in vivo, have revealed their roles in diverse biological events, including immunity and associated disorders, through lipid mediator-dependent or -independent processes in given microenvironments. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the roles of sPLA 2 s in various immune responses and associated diseases. 93 sPLA 2 s in Immunity
