Objective To systematically review the literature exploring impact of isolation on hospitalised patients who are infectious: psychological and non-psychological outcomes Design Systematic review with quantification Data Sources Embase, Medline and Psychinfo were searched from inception until December 2018. Reference lists and Google Scholar were also handsearched. Twenty seven papers published from database inception until December 2018 were reviewed. A wide range of psychological and non-psychological outcomes were reported. There was a marked trend for isolated patients to exhibit higher risk of depression, anxiety and worse outcomes for a range of care-related factors but with significant variation. 5 Wigglesworth N, Wilcox MH.
