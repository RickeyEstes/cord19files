22 Secondary bacterial pneumonia following influenza infection is a significant cause of mortality 23 worldwide. Upper respiratory tract pneumococcal carriage is important as both determinants of 24 disease and population transmission. The immunological mechanisms that contain pneumococcal 25 carriage are well-studied in mice but remain unclear in humans. Loss of this control of carriage 26 following influenza infection is associated with secondary bacterial pneumonia during seasonal and 27 pandemic outbreaks. We used a human type 6B pneumococcal challenge model to show that 28 carriage acquisition induces early degranulation of resident neutrophils and recruitment of 29 monocytes to the nose. Monocyte function associated with clearance of pneumococcal carriage. 30 Prior nasal infection with live attenuated influenza virus induced inflammation, impaired innate 31 function and altered genome-wide nasal gene responses to pneumococcal carriage. Levels of the 32 cytokine IP-10 promoted by viral infection at the time of pneumococcal encounter was positively 33 associated with bacterial density. These findings provide novel insights in nasal immunity to 34 pneumococcus and viral-bacterial interactions during co-infection. 35 Main 36 Pneumonia is a major global health problem; it kills more children under 5 years of age than any 37 other disease 1 . The burden of disease is aggravated by old age, chronic lung disease, 38 immunosupression and viral co-infection. Secondary pneumonia following pandemic and seasonal 39 influenza virus infection is a significant cause of mortality worldwide 2 . 40 Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn, pneumococcus) is common with 40-41 95% of infants and 10-25% of adults colonised at any time 3 . Carriage is important as the pre-42 requisite of infection 4 , the primary reservoir for transmission 5 and the predominant source of 43 immunising exposure and immunological boosting in both children and adults 6,7 .
