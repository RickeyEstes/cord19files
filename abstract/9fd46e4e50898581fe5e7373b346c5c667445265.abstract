Viral infections in solid transplant patients p M DHPG combinated with 5 U / d IFN (Y and 95 f 5% inhibition with 1 l . l p M DHPG in combination with 0.2 ng/d IFN y (n = 3). Conclusions: IFN (Y and IFN y decrease HCMV infection in monocytic-like cell line THP-1 and may lead to an improvement of the available chemotherapy against this important human pathogen. Combination of IFNs with DHPG after lnfection showed a synergistic effect. PCV has a well-documented inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus and varicelia-zoster virus. By contrast, data on its activity against CMV are limited. We evaluated the in vim activity of PCV against 3 CMV WS (#1 and #2 from marmw transplant recipients, #3 from a neonate) and against CMV strain AD169, and compared the results with those obtained in parallel with acyclovir (ACV), ganciclovir (GCV), and foscarnet (FOS). A plaque reduction assay was used to determine the mhibitory drug concentration reducing plaque numbers by 50% (IC50). The drugs were tested in 6 human fibroblast cell lines. The results were as follows: Median ICsg of 13 p M (630) indxatmg a rerkunce to ganclclovlr.
