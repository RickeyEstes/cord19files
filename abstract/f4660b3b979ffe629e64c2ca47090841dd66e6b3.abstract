In 2004, in the United States, there were 72 million presentations with a primary diagnosis of a digestive disease and 104 million presentations with combined gastrointestinal (GI) tract diseases and other diseases ( Table 1) . 1 It was also found that those who are older tend to have more GI problems, there was no difference in the rates of digestive disease between the African Americans and the whites, and women were 20% more likely to present than men with digestive diseases. Thus, more than one-third (35%) of all presentations are for digestive diseases. In 2009, in the United States, the cancer statistics revealed 275,720 new cases of GI cancer, with colorectal and pancreatic cancer in the top 10 for both men and women. 2 There were 135,830 deaths due to GI cancer, with colorectal, pancreatic, hepatic, and esophageal cancers in the top 10 for both men and women, except for esophageal cancer, which was only listed for men (Fig. 1) . 2 Furthermore, 2 of these 3 cancers that have an increasing mortality were GI tract cancers for both genders, with esophageal and hepatic cancers among men and pancreatic and hepatic cancers among women. Worldwide the rates of digestive diseases are staggering. From 1979 to 1989, in the United States, a decrease was observed in the ambulatory care visits and hospital discharges for digestive diseases. These rates remained constant between 1990 and 1999, until 2000 when the rates climbed dramatically and was still increasing in 2004 (Fig. 2) . 1 During this period, substantial increases in the
