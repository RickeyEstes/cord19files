Increased concentrations of soluble HLA class I and class II molecules (sHLA-I and sHLA-II) have been observed in infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases. Because autoimmune mechanisms are considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), we decided to dose sHLA-I and sHLA-II in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients comparing their concentrations with those observed in serum and CSF of patients with other neurologic diseases (OND) without evidence of neuroradiologic involvement of central nervous system (CNS) and in serum of healthy donors. The serum concentrations of sHLA-I were higher in both MS and OND patients than in healthy donors (P Ï½ 0.05) whereas sHLA-II serum concentrations were lower in MS
