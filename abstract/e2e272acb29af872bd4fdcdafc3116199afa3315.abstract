Abbreviations used in text and figures: 5HT: 5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin; AC: adenylate cyclase; ACh: acetylcholine; AQP: water channels of the aquaporin family; CaCC: Ca2+-activated chloride channel; cAMP: adenosine 3'-5'cyclic monophos-Na+-independent mechanisms. Apical NaC1 entry through Na+/H + (NHE-3) and CI-/HCO 3-exchange drive electroneutral NaC1 absorption in the small intestine and colon. Na รท exits the cell through the basolateral Na+/ K+ATPase, but the route of Ck efflux is not known. The H + gradient created across the apical membrane by the Na+/H + exchange chives the cotransport of peptides. Different chemical mediators coming from enteroendocrine (EC), inmlune (Im) and enteric nervous (ENS) systems act by binding to specific receptors in the basotateral membrane coupled to adenyl cyctase or phospholipase C which result in increases in the second mensagers Ca 2+, diacylglycerol (DG) and cAMP. These regulate the activity of transporters, mainly SGLT1, by PKA and PKC mediated phosphorylation. Crypt cells': Chloride secretion in the small intestine and colon is depicted in the lower cell. CI enters cells at the basolateral membrane through Na+/K+/2C1 cotransport and leaves cells (cont. on p 28)
