Although some plant viruses make it into their target cells through open wounds, most viruses bind to a receptor molecule at the cell surface and then have to cross the cell Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2006, 16:776-786 www.sciencedirect.com Viral enzymes Mesters, Tan and Hilgenfeld 777 www.sciencedirect.com Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2006, 16:776-786 8.

Russell RJ, Haire LF, Stevens DJ, Collins PJ, Lin YP, Blackburn GM, Hay AJ, Gamblin SJ, Skehel JJ: The structure of H5N1 avian influenza neuraminidase suggests new opportunities for drug design. Nature 2006, 443:45-49. The first X-ray structure of an avian influenza type-I neuraminidase reveals an extra cavity adjacent to the active site observed in structures of type-II variants. The latter were used for structure-based design of oseltamivir and zanamivir. Clearly, this cavity can be exploited for structure-based design of new neuraminidase type-I specific inhibitors. 10.

Meylan E, Curran J, Hofmann K, Moradpour D, Binder M, Bartenschlager R, Tschopp J: Cardif is an adaptor protein in the RIG-I antiviral pathway and is targeted by hepatitis C virus. Nature 2005, 437:1167-1172. The authors describe a new CARD-containing adaptor protein, Cardif, which interacts with RIG-I, a helicase that senses double-stranded (viral) RNA. Cardif can recruit several kinases, thereby stimulating NF-kB and IRF3 promoter activation. Interestingly, in order to perturb the host's immune response (e.g. interferon-b production), Cardif is targeted and inactivated by the NS3-NS4A serine protease of HCV.
