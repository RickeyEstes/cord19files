The authors of this article are all practicing laboratory animal veterinarians with additional private practice experience with the goal of sharing our experience in diagnosing and treating the most common respiratory diseases of rodents and rabbits. Additionally, necropsy descriptions are provided for those readers who may find the information valuable for husbandry and breeding in colony situations.
