It is known, however, that quarantine and isolation measures, especially in the context of a new emerging disease, are initially not administered effectively, but are gradually refined (as more data and knowledge of the disease transmission process becomes available (see, for instance, [8])). Numerous mathematical modeling work have been carried out to assess the impact of quarantine and isolation in combatting the spread of the diseases (such as some of the aforementioned modeling studies for SARS). However, many of the models used for assessing the impact of the quarantine and isolation measures tend to be built based on the assumption that the disease stages are exponentially distributed. However, some recent studies [7, 30] show that it is more realistic to use gamma distribution assumption for the waiting time in the disease stages (rather than exponential distribution assumption). Furthermore, Feng et al. [7] showed that quarantine and isolation models that assume exponential distribution (for the disease stages) may not be suitable for diseases with relatively long latent and/or infectious periods for the case when isolation is not completely effective (i.e., isolated individuals can transmit infection). The purpose of the current study is to provide a rigorous qualitative analysis of a new deterministic model for transmission dynamics of a communicable disease, subject to the use of quarantine and isolation, where the waiting time in the associated infected classes are assumed to have gamma distribution. The model to be designed extends the SEIQHR model given in [24] by considering multiple stages of the exposed, infectious, quarantined and hospitalized individuals (unlike in [24] , it is assumed here that hospitalized individuals do not transmit the infection). Diseases like HIV [25] and influenza [6] are known to have multiple disease (infection) stages. The paper is organized as follows. The model is formulated in Section 2. The global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is established in Section 3. The existence of the endemic equilibrium is analyzed in Section 4. Local and global stability proofs for the endemic equilibrium, for special cases, are also provided using a Krasnoselskii sub-linearity trick and a non-linear Lyapunov function of Goh-Voltera type, respectively.
