KEYWORDS Lung transplantation Immunocompromised Infectious complications Cytomegalovirus Aspergillosis Prophylaxis Lung transplant recipients are at a higher risk of infectious complications than recipients of other solid organs. The major cause of mortality beyond 1 year after lung transplantation is bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (chronic allograft rejection). Infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Aspergillus species have been associated with the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. CMV and fungal prophylaxis regimens vary by transplant center. Pneuomcystis jiroveci pneumonia is rare in the era of prophylaxis.
