Journal of Infection (2015) 71, 101e109 Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Polymorphism; Susceptibility Methods: We genotyped the CCL2 G-2518A and MBL codon 54 variant (A/B) in 4 caseecontrol populations of Chinese descent, totally consisting of 932 patients with SARS and 982 control subjects. Results: Both the high-CCL2-producing GG genotype and the low-MBL-producing B allele were consistently associated with increased risks of SARS-CoV infection in all 4 caseecontrol populations (joint P Z 1.6 Â 10 À4 and 4.9 Â 10 À8 , for CCL2 and MBL respectively), with no interaction between polymorphisms could be detected. Furthermore, all the 4 caseecontrol studies demonstrated a cumulative effect on risk of SARS-CoV infection for the combination of polymorphisms (joint P Z 1.3 Â 10 À10 ). However, tests using the area under the curve (AUC) indicated that at this stage, the polymorphisms were unlikely to be appropriate for risk prediction testing because of low AUC values (all <66%). Additionally, no association was observed between the polymorphisms and severity of SARS. Conclusions: The CCL2 G-2518A and MBL codon 54 variant have a significantly cumulative effect on increased risk of SARS-CoV infection.
