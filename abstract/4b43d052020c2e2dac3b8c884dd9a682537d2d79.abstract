Exogenous administration of human albumin has been used primarily for volume expansion. Albumin accounts for 70-80% of the oncotic pressure in plasma. Other proprieties of albumin include carrying hydrophobic substances, antioxidant activity, antithrombotic effects, anti-inflammatory effects, and endothelial stabilization. A recently published review article highlights these properties and indications for exogenous albumin administration [1r].
