KEYWORDS Food safety Contamination Technology Trade Travel Foodborne illness has undoubtedly plagued humans from the beginning, as long as we have existed. The transition from hunter-gathering societies to settlements with agriculture and domesticated animals improved food security but increased the need for food safety and the opportunities for foodborne illnesses. Technology, from simple systems for sanitary disposal of human and animal waste, protection of water from fecal contamination, refrigeration, freezing, and other methods to inhibit microbial growth in food, for example pasteurization of milk, has contributed to the safety of the food supply chain and the reduction in foodborne illness. The globalization and increased magnitude of transport of food across the world, partly in response to the growth in population and in part to changes in the way that people obtain, prepare, and consume food, provides new ways for pathogens to be transported and transmitted. In addition to travel of the food supply, travel of people may expose them to foodborne illness to which they would not otherwise be exposed. Factory farming, the large-scale growth and processing especially of food animals, can easily promote unhygienic conditions and contamination in unprecedented scale of food products with pathogens, toxins, antibiotics, and other potentially dangerous substances. The scale of these factors has diminished the ability of regulatory agencies to monitor the safety of the products being consumed on a daily basis. Nonetheless, there are many opportunities to improve both technology and practice and, in turn, help to prevent or reduce future disease incidence. Infect Dis Clin N Am 27 (2013) 501-515 http://dx.
