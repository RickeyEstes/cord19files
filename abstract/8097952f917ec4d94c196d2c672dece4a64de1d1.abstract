NTCP determines viral infection specificity at entry level HBV only infects human, chimpanzees and northern treeshrew (Tupaia belangeri). It cannot infect non-human primates, mouse, rat and other The human sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (hNTCP) is a bona fide receptor for HBV and HDV. hNTCP expressing hepatoma cell lines are important tools to study HBV and HDV replication.
