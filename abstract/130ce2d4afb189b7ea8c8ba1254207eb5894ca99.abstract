A systematic survey was carried on stools from 130 children suffering of acute gastroenteritis. Electron microscopy, enzymo-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA } and counter electrophoresis were employed. This survey allowed to the detection by electron microscopy of Rotavirus (40 cases}, Coronuviruses (3 cases}, Astroviruses {2 cases}, Adenoviruses {2 cases} and Small Round Viruses (1 case}. Serological tests {complement fixation, ELISA and counter electrophoresis) done with 86 sera showed a good correlation with results obtained with electron microscopy.
