Interpretation Seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was signifi cantly higher in camel-exposed individuals than in the general population. By simple multiplication, a projected 44 951 (95% CI 26 971-71 922) individuals older than 15 years might be seropositive for MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. These individuals might be the source of infection for patients with confi rmed MERS who had no previous exposure to camels.
