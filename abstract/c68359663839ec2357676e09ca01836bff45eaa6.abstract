Furthermore, within their anatomical microenvironment, NK cells must be able to freely move and receive stimuli that will direct their migration between different organs. This chapter will provide an overview of our current understanding of the localization of NK cell populations and their ability to migrate in response to homeostatic and pathological conditions.
