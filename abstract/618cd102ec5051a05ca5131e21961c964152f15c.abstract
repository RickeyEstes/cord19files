Adenoviruses are double-strained DNA viruses found in a great number of vertebrates, 8 including humans. In order to understand their transmission dynamics, it is crucial, even from a 9 human health perspective, to investigate how host traits influence their prevalence. Bats are 10 important reservoirs for Adenoviruses, and here we use the results of recent screenings in 11 Western Europe to evaluate the association between characteristic traits of bat species and their 12 probability of hosting Adenoviruses, taking into account their phylogenetic relationships. Across 13 species, we found an important phylogenetic component in the presence of Adenoviruses and 14 mating strategy as the most determinant factor conditioning the prevalence of Adenoviruses 15 across bat species. Contrary to other more stable mating strategies (e.g. harems), swarming could 16 hinder transmission of Adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals 17 are too short. Alternatively, bat species with more promiscuous behavior may develop a stronger 18 immune system. Outstandingly high prevalence of Adenoviruses was reported for the Iberian 19 species Pipistrellus pygmaeus, P. kuhlii and Nyctalus lasiopterus and we found that in the latter, 20 males were more likely to be infected by Adenoviruses than females, due to the 21 immunosuppressing consequence of testosterone during the mating season. As a general trend 22 4 29 Author Summary 30 Adenoviruses are DNA viruses with a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans, 31 causing ocular, respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. Here, we focus on the prevalence of 32 Adenoviruses in bats, which are known to be natural reservoir of many viruses, using the results 33 of recent screenings for prevalence of these viruses in 33 European bat species. Our aim is to 34 find association between Adenoviruses prevalence and biological and behavioral host traits, 35 considering the heterogeneity both between and within species in order to have a deeper 36 understanding of mechanisms of viral transmission. Our results highlight the importance of mating strategy: bats species using swarming as mating 38 strategy are less likely to be infected by Adenoviruses. Moreover, we found that locality of 39 capture can explain a higher prevalence of Adenovirus within species. However, no general 40 pattern has been found in the analysis at individual level, suggesting a strong species specificity 41 and complex viral transmission dynamics. 42 43
