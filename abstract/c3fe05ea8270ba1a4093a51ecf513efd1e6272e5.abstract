5 0 -Fluoro-5 0 -deoxyaristeromycin (2) has been prepared via a Mitsunobu coupling of (1S,2S,3R,4S)-2,3-(cyclopentylidenedioxy)-4-fluoromethylcyclopentan-1-ol with N 6 -bis-boc protected adenine. This procedure is adaptable to preparing a number of 5 0 -fluoro-5 0 -deoxycarbocyclic nucleoside analogs with diversity in the heterocyclic base. Antiviral analysis found promising activity for 2 toward measles but no other viruses. No cytotoxicity was observed for 2.
