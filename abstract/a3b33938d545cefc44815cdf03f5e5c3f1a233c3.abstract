Several mechanisms of diarrhea are possible in ruminant neonates. This article summarizes the various mechanisms: It is important to remember that, under physiologic conditions, more fluid is secreted into the intestinal lumen, and reabsorbed, compared with the ingested amount. Therefore, impaired reabsorption of fluids has a major impact on the fluid balance of the patient. Several diarrheal pathogens interfere with digestion and absorption by blunting intestinal villi, as observed with rotavirus and coronavirus infections. Osmotic Increased solutes within the intestinal lumen osmotically pull more water into the lumen, thereby resulting in dehydration of the patient. Osmotic particles Disclosure: The authors have nothing to disclose. KEYWORDS Ruminant Enteritis Infection Juvenile Neonate Diarrhea Common causes of infectious enteritis in neonate and juvenile ruminants include viral, bacterial, and protozoal pathogens. The most common presenting sign in ruminants with infectious enteritis is diarrhea. Diagnosis of the cause of enteritis has important zoonotic and herd health implications. Severity of clinical signs with similar pathogens may differ between calves and small ruminants. Treatment of enteritis involves supportive care to correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances, provision of nutritional support for the neonate, prevention and treatment of endotoxemia or sepsis, and pathogen-specific treatments when relevant and available.
