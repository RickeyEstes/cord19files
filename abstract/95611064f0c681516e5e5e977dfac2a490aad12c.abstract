The goals of point-of-care testing (POCT) are to facilitate rapid evidence-based decisions, to improve patient outcomes, and, ultimately, to be robust and reliable enough for on-site applications in emergency and disaster settings worldwide. The objectives of this article are (1) to review current POC technologies used in disaster and emergency care, (2) to understand first responder needs, (3) to outline device design criteria based on gap analysis, and (4) to present strategies for improving future POCT for efficiency, effectiveness, and targeted treatment during on-site field operations. This article is evidence-based in that it presents preliminary results of a needs assessment survey in the United States. Readers are encouraged to participate in the needs assessment survey. Please see the instructions provided in Table 1.
