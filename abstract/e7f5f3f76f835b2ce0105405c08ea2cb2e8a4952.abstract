a b s t r a c t SARS-CoV 3CL pro plays an important role in viral replication. In this study, we performed a biological evaluation on nine phlorotannins isolated from the edible brown algae Ecklonia cava. The nine isolated phlorotannins (1-9), except phloroglucinol (1), possessed SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitory activities in a dose-dependently and competitive manner. Of these phlorotannins (1-9), two eckol groups with a diphenyl ether linked dieckol (8) showed the most potent SARS-CoV 3CL pro trans/cis-cleavage inhibitory effects (IC 50 s = 2.7 and 68.1 lM, respectively). This is the first report of a (8) phlorotannin chemotype significantly blocking the cleavage of SARS-CoV 3CL pro in a cell-based assay with no toxicity. Furthermore, dieckol (8) exhibited a high association rate in the SPR sensorgram and formed extremely strong hydrogen bonds to the catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro .
