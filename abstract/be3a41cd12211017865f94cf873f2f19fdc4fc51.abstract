A probable NRTI molecule, viz. 3 0 -N,N-dimethylamino-2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxythymidine (4) and its 5 0 -O-carboxyl ester prodrugs (7) have been synthesized and screened against HIV, HSV-1 and 2, parainfluenza-3, vesicular stomatitis and several other viruses. The compound 6 showed good antiviral activity with EC 50 value 0.03 mM (SI Â¼ 8) against VSV in Hela and HEL cell lines. However, the lead compound 4 and its derivatives 5, 6 and 7 showed no remarkable activity against HIV-1 and other viruses. Molecular docking studies with HIV-1 RT using DS 2.5 and pymol softwares have shown marked differences in the interaction patterns between the lead compound 4 and AZT.
