Hand hygiene is considered as an efficient and cost-effective way to limit the spread of diseases and, as such, it is recommended by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While the effect of hand washing on individual transmissibility of a disease has been studied through medical and public-health research, its potential as a mitigation strategy against a global pandemic has not been fully explored yet. In this study, we investigate contagion dynamics through the world air transportation network and analyze the impact of hand-hygiene behavioural changes of airport population against the spread of infectious diseases worldwide. Using a granular dataset of the world air transportation traffic, we build a detailed individual mobility model that controls for the correlated and recurrent nature of human travel and the waiting-time distributions of individuals at different locations. We perform a Monte-Carlo simulation study to assess the impact of different hand-washing mitigation strategies at the early stages of a global epidemic. From the simulation results we find that increasing the hand cleanliness homogeneously at all airports in the world can inhibit the impact of a potential pandemic by 24 to 69%. By quantifying and ranking the contribution of the different airports to the mitigation of an epidemic outbreak, we identify ten key airports at the core of a cost-optimal deployment of the hand-washing strategy: increasing the engagement rate at those locations alone could potentially reduce a world pandemic by 8 to 37%. This research provides evidence of the effectiveness of hand hygiene in airports on the global spread of infectious diseases, and has important implications for the way public-health policymakers may design new effective strategies to enhance hand hygiene in airports through behavioral changes.

The H1N1 flu, which caused around 300,000 deaths worldwide 7 , had a similar timeline. The first confirmed case of H1N1 was reported in Veracruz, Mexico on April 2009, while within few days the infection migrated to the US and Europe, and two months later the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared the disease as a global pandemic. Bacteria, pathogens and viruses are also transmitted easily at airports or during flights, causing infections and bacterial diseases that can expand to global epidemics. The pathogens are transmitted through the air 8 , resulting in the contagion of airborne diseases, or through physical contact between individuals. The transmission is accelerated when a dense population of people is concentrated in a confined area 9 like an airport, with lack of good hygiene and efficient air ventilation. After an outbreak, infections diffuse while infected individuals transmit the disease to susceptible individuals. Airports play a major role in such contagious dynamics 10 , as they contribute daily to the contact of people from all over the world, some of whom may be carrying endemic infections and bacteria from their country of origin. In addition, there are numerous highly contaminated surfaces which are frequently touched by the passengers at airports and inside aircrafts 11 . Self-service check-in screens, gate bench armrests, water fountain buttons and door handles at airports, as well as seats, tray tables and handles of lavatories in aircrafts, are all known to have high microbial contamination 12-14 . Mitigation strategies are designed and implemented to inhibit a global pandemic. At the individual level there is a focus on behavioral change towards adopting different interventions in the case of a health emergency 15, 16 . Along with other developments in medicine, vaccination has made a big contribution in that direction leading to the extinction of past epidemics and a significant reduction of mortality due to specific infections 17 . Vaccination has a substantial mitigating effect when effective vaccines are available soon enough after the emergence of a new disease and when vaccination campaigns cover about 70% of a susceptible population 18 . However, despite the known impact of vaccines on the reduction of infections, the rate of vaccination in the population has remained unchanged over the past decade 19 . Social nudges such as peer effects or education on vaccination benefits, and changes in the design of vaccination campaigns, can be deployed to change human behavior towards the increase of influenza vaccination rates 20 . In addition of preventing disease spreading by vaccination, isolating patients at home or closure of high-risk places like schools can moderate the transmission of disease-causing pathogenic microorganisms. Several actions within the world air transportation network can be implemented to control a disease spreading in the case of a health emergency 21 . At the global scale, mobility-driven interventions such as airport closures and deliberate rerouting of the travelers, can reduce the number of individuals passing through or traveling from/to regions where dangerous diseases prevail 22 . At the local scale, actions at individual airports such as frequent cleaning of public areas (e.g. toilets, gates, check-in desks, etc.), efficient air ventilation and enhanced sensitization of frequently touched surfaces can reduce the risk of contamination and the transmission of infections. Furthermore, personal hygiene is the most important factor to prevent the spread of an infection 23 . Coughing etiquette, face masks, no face touch and hand hygiene are the most common actions that air travelers can easily adopt. From those actions, hand washing is the simplest and most effective component for preventing the transmission of viruses 24-27 and bacteria, and is regularly mentioned as the first recommendation of precautions in health care (see for example 28 ). A scientific study on the effects of hand washing on the bacterial contamination of hands, showed that after a deliberate contamination of individuals by touching door handles and railings in public places, bacteria were found in 44% of the sample, while this percentage was reduced to 23% after hand washing with water only, and to 8% after hand washing with water and plain soap 29 . The same study concluded also that the effect of hand washing does not depend on the bacteria species. While hand hygiene is considered as the first prevention step in the case of an epidemic emergency, there is lack of evidence for its effects as a mitigation strategy against global epidemic spreading. In this work, we study contagion dynamics through the world air transportation network and we elucidate the impact of hand-hygiene behavioral changes on the diffusion of infections worldwide. We develop a computational model to track the realistic mobility patterns of air travelers, their hand washing behavior and the dynamics of epidemic spreading. Human mobility is modelled by a stochastic agent-base system that accounts for the spatial distribution of airports, the realistic human mobility through the world air transportation network, and the waiting-time distributions of individuals at origin, destination and connecting airports. In addition, we develop a compartmental epidemic model which relates the disease spreading with hand-hygiene behaviour. Using Monte-Carlo simulations we assess the impact of hand washing at the early stages of a global epidemic spreading. From the simulation results, we measure the early-time spreading power of the 40 busiest airports under four different intervention scenarios: 1. increase of hand washing engagement homogeneously at all airports; 2. increase of hand washing engagement only at the source of the disease; 3. increase of hand washing engagement at the ten most important airports of the world air transportation network; and 4. increase of hand washing engagement at the ten most important airports for each source of the disease. The aim of this study is to identify the most effective mitigation strategy of hand hygiene contributing the most to the reduction of global epidemic spreading.
