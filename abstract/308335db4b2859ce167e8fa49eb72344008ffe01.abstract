and polymerase L [4-7]. The mature viral particles have a filamentous shape, which varies in length [4, 8]. Structural analysis of VP40 shows a monomeric metastable conformation consisting of two structurally related ␤ sandwich domains that are loosely associated with each other [9]. Trypsin cleavage within the C-terminal domain and destabilization of the monomer by 38042 Grenoble France urea treatment, mutagenesis, and binding to synthetic liposomes leads to the formation of ring-like structures in vitro, a process that has been suggested to play a role in assembly and budding [10, 11] . The change in 08034 Barcelona Spain the oligomeric state is arbitrated by the N-terminal domain [9], while the C-terminal domain is required for 3 Institut fü r Virologie Robert-Koch-Str. 17 membrane association in vitro [10] and in vivo [12]. Filovirus assembly and budding takes place at the 35037 Marburg Germany plasma membrane, which requires lipid raft microdomains [4, 13]. Expression of Ebola virus VP40 was shown to be sufficient to induce the release of virus-like particles from mammalian cells [12, 14], whereas coexpres-Summary sion of GP improved the efficiency of particle production dramatically [13, 15]. Furthermore, VP40 contains short The Ebola virus membrane-associated matrix protein VP40 is thought to be crucial for assembly and budding sequence motifs (PPXY and PTAP) at its N terminus whose presence has been implicated in virus particle of virus particles. Here we present the crystal structure of a disk-shaped octameric form of VP40 formed by release by interacting with cellular factors [12, 16-18]. VP40 also associates with RNP structures in vivo [19] four antiparallel homodimers of the N-terminal domain. The octamer binds an RNA triribonucleotide and it has been reported to localize to late endosomal membranes [20]. Matrix protein/RNP interactions have containing the sequence 5-U-G-A-3 through its inner pore surface, and its oligomerization and RNA binding been reported for a number of enveloped viruses [21-24]. This process may generally involve interactions with properties are facilitated by two conformational changes when compared to monomeric VP40. The se-viral RNA (vRNA), such as the Corona virus M/mRNA1 recognition, which seems to be crucial for the M-NP lective RNA interaction stabilizes the ring structure and confers in vitro SDS resistance to octameric VP40. association [25]. Likewise, influenza virus M1 and vRNA were reported to promote the assembly of helical NP SDS-resistant octameric VP40 is also found in Ebola virus-infected cells, which suggests that VP40 has an structures, leading to the translocation of RNP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [26]. In addition, other studies additional function in the life cycle of the virus besides promoting virus assembly and budding off the plasma implicate matrix proteins in the interference with the cellular RNA metabolism [27, 28]. Here we present the X-ray structure of octameric VP40 assembled through its N-terminal domain (NTD). Oligo-Introduction merization is accompanied by structural rearrangements, when compared to the full-length monomeric conforma-Filoviruses belong to the order of negative-stranded nonsegmented RNA viruses and are classified into the tion of VP40. Notably, we find that a short triribonucleotide (5Ј-U-G-A-3Ј), derived from the expression host, is two genera, Ebola and Marburg viruses.

This, together with the detection of a small amount raghic fever in humans, with occasional epidemic outbreaks of the disease in regions of central Africa [1]. of octameric SDS-resistant full-length VP40 in Ebola virus-infected cells, suggests that VP40 is not only active Filoviruses are enveloped by a lipid bilayer, which anchors the glycoprotein GP to the surface of viral parti-in bilayer interaction during the assembly process, but also plays an important role either in viral or host cell cles. GP undergoes a number of posttranslational modifications, which have been associated with virus entry RNA metabolism during its replication cycle. and possibly pathogenicity [2, 3].
