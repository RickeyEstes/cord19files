Ligand-receptor interactions are customarily described by equations that apply to solutes. Yet, most receptors are present in cell membranes so that sufficiently lipophilic ligands could reach the receptor by a two-dimensional approach within the membrane. As summarized in this review, this may affect the ligand-receptor interaction in many ways. Biophysicians calculated that, compared to a threedimensional approach from the liquid phase, such approach could alter the time the ligands need to find a receptor. Biochemists found that ligand incorporation in lipid bilayers modifies their conformation. This, along with the depth at which the ligands reside in the bilayer, will affect the probability of successful receptor interaction. Novel mechanisms were also introduced, including "exosite" binding and ligand translocation between the receptor's ‚ê£-helical transmembrane domains. Pharmacologists focused attention at ligand concentrations in membrane, their adsorption and release rates and the effects thereof on ligand potency and residence time at the receptor. (G. Vauquelin). physics, biochemistry, pharmacology, biology and chemistry have contributed to a better knowledge of how membranes may affect ligand-receptor (as well as substrate-enzyme) interactions at the molecular level. The ambition of this review is to integrate the outcomes of these studies in a single comprehensive monograph and, by doing so, to stimulate interdisciplinary cross-talks on this far from obsolete topic.
