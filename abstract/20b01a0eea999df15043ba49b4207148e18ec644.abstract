His research, conducted in the early 1970s at the Regenstrief Institute in Indiana, demonstrated that even for common conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, and for common preventive measures, such as immunizations, physicians often failed to deliver required services. However, when reminded by a computer system that monitored electronic patient data about the need to vaccinate a specific patient or order a needed test, physicians complied with standards of care at twice the rate as when not reminded. When the system stopped reminding the physicians, however, their compliance rates quickly returned to baseline; thus, any "education" or "training" that the system provided had no lasting effect on compliance. McDonald's research spawned a new line of system-level thinking in medicine that continues to this day (Kohn et al., 2000 , Leavitt, 2001 , Yasnoff et al., 2004 . McDonald concluded this influential paper with the observation that, although man is not perfectible, systems of care are.
