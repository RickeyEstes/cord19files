The glycoprotein gp210 is located in the "pore membrane," a specialized domain of the nuclear envelope to which the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is anchored, gp210 contains a large cisternal domain, a single transmembrane segment (TM), and a COOHterminal, 58-amino acid residue cytoplasmic tail (CT) ). To locate determinants for sorting of gp210 to the pore membrane, we constructed various cDNAs coding for wild-type, mutant, and chimeric gp210, and monitored localization of the expressed protein in 3T3 cells by immunofluorescence micros-9 The Rockefeller University Press,
