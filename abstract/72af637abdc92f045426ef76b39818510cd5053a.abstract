We summarize all original research in the field of respiratory intensive care medicine published in 2005 in Critical Care. Twenty-seven articles were grouped into the following categories and subcategories to facilitate rapid overview: mechanical ventilation (physiology, spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation, high frequency oscillatory ventilation, side effects of mechanical ventilation, sedation, and prone positioning); infection (pneumonia and sepsis); monitoring (ventilatory monitoring, pulmonary artery catheter and pulse oxymeter); and education (training and health outcome). ALI = acute lung injury; ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; CMV = conventional mechanical ventilation; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ECMO = extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; ET = endothelin; HFOV = high-frequency oscillatory ventilation; IAP = intraabdominal pressure; ICU = intensive care unit; IPAH = idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension; IPV = intrapulmonary percussive ventilation; PCP = pulmonary capillary pressure; PEEP = positive end-expiratory pressure; SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome; VAT = ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis.
