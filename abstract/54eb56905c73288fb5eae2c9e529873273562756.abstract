A series of seventeen hitherto unknown ANP analogs bearing the (E)-but-2-enyl aliphatic side chain and modified heterocyclic base such as cytosine and 5-fluorocytosine, 2-pyrazinecarboxamide, 1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide or 4-substituted-1,2,3-triazoles were prepared in a straight approach through an olefin acyclic cross metathesis as key synthetic step. All novel compounds were evaluated for their antiviral activities against a large number of DNA and RNA viruses including herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, feline herpes virus, human cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV-1 and HIV-2. Among these molecules, only compound 31 showed activity against human cytomegalovirus in HEL cell cultures with at EC 50 of w10 mM. Compounds 8a, 13, 14, and 24 demonstrated pronounced anti-HCV activity without significant cytotoxicity at 100 mM. Ã“ 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.
