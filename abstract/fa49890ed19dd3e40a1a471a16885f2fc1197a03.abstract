Objective: Lung transplantation is therapeutic for end-stage lung disease, but survival is limited due to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and restrictive chronic lung allograft dysfunction. We sought a common denominator in lung transplant recipients, analyzing risk factors that trigger immune responses that lead to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. We collected blood from patients who underwent lung transplant at our institution. Exosomes were isolated from the sera of recipients with risk factors for chronic rejection and from stable recipients. Exosomes were analyzed with western blot, using antibodies to lung self-antigens K alpha 1 tubulin and collagen-V, costimulatory molecules (costimulatory molecule 80, costimulatory molecule 86), transcription factors (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, hypoxia-inducible factor 1a, Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex Transactivator), and 20S proteasome.
