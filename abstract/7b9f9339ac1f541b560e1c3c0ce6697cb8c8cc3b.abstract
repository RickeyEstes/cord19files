Supplementary Text 1: Details of specimen collection, processing, polymerase chain reaction 34 assays, quality control measures, and assay parameters used to identify respiratory viruses. Specimen collection 36 All swabs were collected using a plastic-shaft, rayon-budded swab in a transport tube with a foam 37 pad reservoir soaked with viral transport medium (Virocult MW950, Medical Wire & Equipment, 38 Wiltshire, England). A single swab was used to sample both nostrils. 39 Quality Control measures 40 A known amount of whole equine herpesvirus (EHV) spiked into each sample assessed nucleic 41 acid extraction quality and presence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inhibitors. 1 Any extract 42 having a >3 cycle-threshold (Ct) difference to that of the expected value by EHV real-time PCR 43 assays was considered to have failed quality control and the sample was re-extracted. Specimen quality was assessed by testing for a marker of human genomic DNA, endogenous 46 retrovirus-3 (ERV-3). 2 We have demonstrated previously that among specimens with an ERV-3 Ct a adjusted for clustering using sandwich estimators to account for within-infant correlation between observations; b Individual rhinovirus species do not add up to 'All rhinovirus' detections because of a combination of more than one rhinovirus species detected within the same ARI episode, or single new virus detection episodes where HRV positive specimens could not be sequenced.
