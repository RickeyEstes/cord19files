Pathology practice is increasingly augmented with molecular tests for improved diagnostics and patient management. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is foremost amongst these techniques. This review explains the principles of PCR and the methodological factors that contribute to a successful assay. Key PCR technique variations, such as reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and quantitative real-time (q) PCR, are described and an overview is provided of how PCR products are analysed. The review includes examples of PCR usage in clinical practice for the detection of infectious and genetic diseases, for tumour diagnostics and in molecular forensic applications such as specimen identity confirmation. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method for the in vitro amplification of DNA sequences and involves automated cycles of denaturation, annealing and extension or synthesis using a thermocycler. PCR was conceived and developed in the early 1980s by Kary Mullis, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the invention in 1993. 1 The technique allows the sensitive detection and analysis of miniscule quantities of nucleic acids. PCR has become established as a routine method in pathology diagnostics and has been adapted for the detection of infectious agents, mutations, translocations and gene amplifications, and for molecular forensic applications including identity testing. This review covers the basics of the PCR assay, describes PCR method variations and details current pathology applications.
