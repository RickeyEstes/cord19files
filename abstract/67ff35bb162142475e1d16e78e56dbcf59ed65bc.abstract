1 Background: With new cases of COVID-19 surging around the world, some countries may have to prepare 2 for moving beyond the containment phase. Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for 3 mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the increased 4 seasonal influenza activity. Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures 6 (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-7 imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of 8 diagnoses. Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack 10 rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy 11 of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number 12 of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term 13 government interventions can only delay the peak. 14 Interpretation: Handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination 15 about COVID-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. We stress the importance of 16 a rapid spread of awareness on the use of self-imposed prevention measures in the population. Early-initiated 17 short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing 18 COVID-19 burden. Evidence to date suggests that containment of SARS-CoV-2 using quarantine, travel restrictions, isolation of symp-26 tomatic cases, and contact tracing may need to be supplemented by other interventions. Given its rapid spread 27 across the world and huge implications for public health, it is urgent to understand whether non-case-based inter-28 ventions can mitigate, delay or even prevent a COVID-19 epidemic. One strategy is a broader-scale contact rate 29 reduction enforced by governments which was used during previous outbreaks, e.g., the 1918 influenza pandemic and 30 the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in Mexico. Alternatively, governments and media may stimulate self-imposed 31 prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) by generating awareness about COVID-32 19, especially when economic and societal consequences are taken into account. Both of these strategies may have 33 a significant impact on the outbreak dynamics. Currently, there are no comparative studies that investigate their 34 viability for controlling a COVID-19 epidemic. Added value of this study 36 Using a transmission model parameterized with current best estimates of epidemiological parameters, we evaluated 37 the impact of handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing due to COVID-19 awareness and of government-38 imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate, and time until the peak number of diagnoses. 39 We show that a short-term (1-3 months) government intervention initiated early into the outbreak can only delay 40 the peak number of diagnoses but neither alters its magnitude nor the attack rate. Our analyses also highlight 41 the importance of spreading awareness about COVID-19 in the population, as the impact of self-imposed measures 42 is strongly dependent on it. When awareness spreads fast, simple self-imposed measures such as handwashing are 43 more effective than short-term government intervention. Self-imposed measures do not only diminish and postpone 44 the peak number of diagnoses, but they can prevent a large epidemic altogether when their efficacy is sufficiently 45 high (about 50%). Qualitatively, these results will allow public health professionals to compare interventions for 46 designing effective outbreak control policies. Implications of all available evidence 48 Our results highlight that dissemination of evidence-based information on effective prevention measures (hand-49 washing, mask-wearing, and self-imposed social distancing) can be a key strategy for mitigating and postponing a 50 COVID-19 epidemic. Government interventions (e.g., closing schools and prohibiting mass gatherings) implemented 51 early into the epidemic and lasting for a short-time can only buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for the 52
