Supplementary Data SUPPLEMENTARY FIG. S1. High Performance Liquid Chromatography trace of branched PepC7 cyclized product. (Top Panel) Branched PepC7 with first disulfide bond formed by dissolving the linear peptide in 0.1 M NH 4 HCO 3 (1 mg/ 3 mL, pH 8) followed by the addition of 2,2Â¢-dipyridyldisulfide (1 mM) in methanol (0.2 mL/1 mg). (Middle Panel) Iodine oxidation of the Acm-protected Cys residues using a 10-fold excess of I2 per Acm as 20 mM I2 solution in acetic acid, 60 min at room temperature. (Bottom Panel) Iodine oxidation using a 20-fold excess of I2 per Acm, 30 min at room temperature.
