(GST) with various homologs differentially expressed in the lens. However, there is no direct structural information that helps to delineate the mechanisms by which S-crystallin could have evolved. Here we report the structural and biochemical characterization of novel S-crystallin-glutathione complex. The 2.35-Å crystal structure of a S-crystallin mutant from Octopus vulgaris reveals an active-site architecture that is different from that of GST. S-crystallin has a preference for glutathione binding, although almost lost its GST enzymatic activity. We've also identified four historical mutations that are able to produce a "GST-like" S-crystallin that has regained activity. This protein recapitulates the evolution of S-crystallin from GST. Protein stability studies suggest that S-crystallin is stabilized by glutathione binding to prevent its aggregation; this contrasts with GST-σ, which do not possess this protection. We suggest that a tradeoff between enzyme activity and the stability of the lens protein might have been one of the major driving force behind lens evolution. Crystallins are soluble proteins in eye lenses that play an important role in the maintenance of lens transparency and optical clarity 1 . Their aggregation can result in the formation of cataracts, which are the most common cause of blindness worldwide 2 . Up to the present, the only treatment for this is the surgical removal of cataractous lens, albeit it has been reported very recently that lanosterol may reverse aggregation of crystallin 3 . Interestingly, some taxon-specific crystallins have been found to have structures that are related to cytosolic housekeeping enzymes 4,5 . How lens crystallins evolved from such housekeeping enzymes is a most important question and answers to this question will greatly help our understanding of protein function, folding, and stability 6 . Among the crystallins, S-crystallin in the cephalopod lens has been shown to have an amino acid sequence similar to that of glutathione S-transferase (GST) 6-8 , which catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to various endogenous and xenobiotic electrophilic compounds and is a major detoxification mechanism of biological systems 9-12 (Extended data Fig. 1 ). Previous studies have led to a model that involves multiple gene duplications and exon shuffling to allow the evolution from GST to S-crystallin 4,7,8 and this process then creates a diverse and large family of S-crystallins. There are about ten, twenty four and four different S-crystallins in the lens of the squids, Nototodarus sloanii and Loligo opalescens, and Octopus vulgaris (the West Pacific octopus), respectively 7,13,14 . The cDNAs encoding these S-crystallins have nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 58% to 98%, while their proteins have identities ranging from 46% to 99% at the amino acid sequence level 7 . Among these proteins, "short-loop" S-crystallins (SL11, S4 and Cry9) are expressed less in the lens and are more GST-like, while "long-loop" S-crystallins
