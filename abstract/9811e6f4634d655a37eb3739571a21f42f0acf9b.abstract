Dedicated to Professor Koji Nakanishi on the occasion of his 80th birthday and to honor him for receiving the 2004 Tetrahedron Prize. Abstract-The proteolytic processing of polyproteins by the 3CL protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is essential for the viral propagation. A series of tripeptide a,b-unsaturated esters and ketomethylene isosteres, including AG7088, are synthesized and assayed to target the 3CL protease. Though AG7088 is inactive (IC 50 > 100 lM), the ketomethylene isosteres and tripeptide a,b-unsaturated esters containing both P1 and P2 phenylalanine residues show modest inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 11-39 lM). The Phe-Phe dipeptide inhibitors 18a-e are designed on the basis of computer modeling of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. The most potent inhibitor 18c with an inhibition constant of 0.52 lM is obtained by condensation of the Phe-Phe dipeptide a,bunsaturated ester with 4-(dimethylamino)cinnamic acid. The cell-based assays also indicate that 18c is a nontoxic anti-SARS agent with an EC 50 value of 0.18 lM.
