In 2008, >500 bats associated with possible human exposure were submitted to the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene State Laboratory for the postmortem diagnosis of rabies by direct fluorescent antibody assay. The carcasses of the bats negative for rabies were kept frozen at 80°C. A total of 120 bats were selected for necropsy, including 30 individuals for each of the following categories: juvenile male, juvenile female, adult male and adult female. The lungs and livers were dissected from the bats and pooled for virus purification and metagenomic sequencing according to previously described protocols (1,2). In short, virus particles were purified from the tissues using homogenization, filtration and nuclease treatment. Purified viral RNA was amplified with random primers using the TransPlex Whole Transcriptome Amplification kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to manufacturer's instructions. The resulting shotgun libraries were sequenced using 454 pyrosequencing with GS FLX+ Titanium, as well as Solexa Illumina sequencing. A total of 100 thousand pyrosequences and 13.5 million Illumina sequences were generated. Sequences were trimmed and those sharing at least 95% nucleotide identities over 35 bases were assembled into contigs (3). Assembled contigs were compared to the GenBank non-redundant protein database using BLASTx with an E-value cutoff of 10 4 (4).
