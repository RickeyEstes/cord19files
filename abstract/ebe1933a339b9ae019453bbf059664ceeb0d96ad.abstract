Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection and associated illness may be dramatically modified by passive transfer of immune T lymphocytes. Lymphocytes collected 10 days postinfection were transferred to naive chicks before challenge with virus. As determined by respiratory illness and viral load, transfer of syngeneic immune T lymphocytes protected chicks from challenge infection, whereas no protection was observed in the chicks receiving the MHC compatible lymphocytes from uninfected chicks. Protection following administration of T lymphocytes could be observed in chicks with three distinct MHC haplotypes: B 8 /B 8 , B 12 /B 12 , and B 19 /B 19 . Nearly complete elimination of viral infection and illness was observed in chicks receiving cells enriched in ␣␤ lymphocytes. In contrast, removal of ␥␦ T lymphocytes had only a small effect on their potential to protect chicks. The adoptive transfer of enriched CD8 ϩ or CD4 ϩ T lymphocytes indicated that protection was also a function primarily of CD8-bearing cells. These results indicated that ␣␤ T lymphocytes bearing CD8 ϩ antigens are critical in protecting chicks from IBV infection.
