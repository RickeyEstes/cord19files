Worst case scenarios for pandemic influenza planning in the US involve over 700,000 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. UK planning predicts a 231% occupancy of current level 3 (intensive care unit) bed capacity. Critical care planners need to recognise that mortality is likely to be high and the risk to healthcare workers significant. Contingency planning should, therefore, be multifaceted, involving a robust health command structure, the facility to expand critical care provision in terms of space, equipment and staff and cohorting of affected patients in the early stages. It should also be recognised that despite this expansion of critical care, demand will exceed supply and a process for triage needs to be developed that is valid, reproducible, transparent and consistent with distributive justice. We advocate the development and validation of physiological scores for use as a triage tool, coupled with candid public discussion of the process. Although some research and modelling exists regarding hospital surge capacity for major incidents, this generally relates to 'big bang' single incidents rather than 'rising tide' prolonged problems [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The closest objective evidence for efficacy of critical care in the event of a flu pandemic is extrapolated from H5N1 influenza and the recent SARS outbreak in Toronto. Of the H5N1 admissions to hospital in Thailand, 75% developed respiratory failure. Hospital mortality in these cases was 75% [12] . During the Toronto
