The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19. The outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly from its origin in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (1). A range of interventions have been implemented following the detection in late December 2019 of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology, and identification of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 in early January 2020 (2). Interventions include improved rates of diagnostic testing, clinical management, rapid isolation of suspected and confirmed cases and, most notably, restrictions on mobility (hereafter called cordon sanitaire) imposed on Wuhan city on 23 rd January. Travel restrictions were subsequently imposed on 14 other cities across Hubei Province and partial movement restrictions have been enacted in many cities across China. Initial analysis suggests that the Wuhan cordon sanitaire resulted in an average delay of COVID-19 spread to other cities of 3 days (3), but the true extent of the effect of the mobility restrictions and other types of interventions on transmission has not been examined in detail (4, 5). Questions remain over how these interventions affected the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to locations outside of Wuhan.
