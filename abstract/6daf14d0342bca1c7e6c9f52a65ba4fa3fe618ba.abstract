Supplementary material and methods HepAD38 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Christoph Seeger, Fox Chase Center (USA) and cultured as described previously. HepG2-NTCP cells were provided by Dr. Wang-Shick Ryu, Yonsei University (South Korea) and were maintained as described previously [1]. Briefly, HepG2-NTCP were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5 mM L-Glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 µg/mL streptomycin. For immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) at day 6 post-infection, cells were fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.075% Triton X-100 in PBS and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS at 4°C for 16 h. Cells were incubated with rabbit anti-HBc antibody (DAKO, USA) for 2 h, repeatedly washed and subsequently incubated with secondary antibody, anti-rabbit-IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst33342. 25 sub-layout images per well, covering an entire area of a single well, were captured by automated confocal microscopy OPERA (Perkin Elmer). Images were
