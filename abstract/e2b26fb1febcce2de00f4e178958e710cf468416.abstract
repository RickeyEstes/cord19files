Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) causes enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL), a condition that threatens the sustainability of the livestock industry. A fluorescent loop-mediated isothermal amplification (fLAMP) assay targeting BLV env sequences was developed and used to evaluate 100 bovine blood samples. Compared with a conventional real-time PCR (rPCR) assay, the fLAMP assay achieved 87.3% (62/71) sensitivity and 100% (29/29) specificity. The rPCR assay took 65 min, while the fLAMP assay took 8 min to 30 min from the beginning of DNA amplification to final judgement with a comparable limit of detection. The fLAMP is a potential tool for the rapid and simple diagnosis of BLV infection to supplement ELISA testing and can be used by local laboratories and slaughterhouses without special equipment. KEY WORDS: BLV, bovine leukemia virus, enzootic bovine leucosis, fLAMP, fluorescent loopmediated isothermal amplification Bovine leukemia virus (BLV), a member of the Retroviridae family and the Deltaretrovirus genus, causes enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL). Although BLV-infections are mainly asymptomatic, within several years approximately 30% and 0.1-10% of BLV-infected cattle develop persistent lymphocytosis and fatal lymphosarcoma, respectively [19, 23] . In the European Union (EU), BLV infections have been eradicated, and several nations are officially recognized as free from BLV infection [13, 23] . In contrast, increases in BLV infection and EBL have occurred in Japan [9] [10] [11] . In Japan, cattle diagnosed with lymphosarcoma, which are disapproved for meat consumption by legal regulations, cause vast economic losses to the Japanese livestock industry. Accurate and reliable diagnosis of BLV infection is therefore crucial to accelerate efforts to implement an effective eradication program. Serological tests that detect persistent anti-BLV antibodies, such as agar-gel immunodiffusion and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are routinely used worldwide for the effective screening of BLV-infected cattle [9, 11, 16] . However, these tests are insufficient to correctly diagnose the early stages of infection [5, 9, 16] . Therefore, supplemental use of a rapid and sensitive assay for the detection of BLV-genomic DNA is required to reinforce accurate diagnosis. Although nested PCR assays detect BLV-genomic DNA with high sensitivity [1, 14, 23], they require time-consuming and tedious electrophoretic analysis and are plagued by laboratory contamination. Although real-time PCR assays are more rapid and easier to perform compared with nested PCR assays and achieve equivalent analytical sensitivity (limit of detection, LOD), the assays require expensive equipment [3, 16] . Further, detection of at least two distinct genomic targets is desirable to prevent including false-negatives [20] . Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a promising candidate diagnostic tool for the rapid and sensitive detection of BLV genomic DNA. The LAMP assay involves isothermal amplification at 60-67Â°C within 60 min and one-step detection of a target gene using simple analysis of turbidity (turbidimetric LAMP or tLAMP) [5, 14, 15, 24] . Therefore, the assay is faster and easier to perform than nested PCR and real-time PCR assays with equivalent analytical sensitivity [5, 12, 14, 15, 24] . tLAMP assays afford rapid diagnosis of viral diseases [15, 24] , including BLV detection through targeting the long terminal repeat (LTR)
