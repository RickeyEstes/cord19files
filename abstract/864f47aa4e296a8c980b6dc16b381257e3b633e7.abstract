Word Count: 497 27 28 Data on SARS and MERS in pregnancy are sparse. For SARS, the largest series of 12 71 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%. Complications included ARDS in four, disseminated 72 intravascular coagulopathy in three, renal failure in three, secondary bacterial pneumonia in two, 73 and sepsis in two patients. Mechanical ventilation was three times more likely among pregnant 74 compared to nonpregnant women. Among seven first-trimester infections, four ended in 75 spontaneous abortion. Four of five women with SARS after 24 weeks gestation delivered 76 preterm. For MERS-CoV, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which two were 77 asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; three patients (23%) died. Two 78 pregnancies ended in fetal demise and two were born preterm. No evidence of in utero 79 transmission was seen in SARS or MERS. 80 Currently, no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and 81 Drug Administration. Because COVID-19 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, 82 management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal 83 monitoring. Principles of management of COVID-19 in pregnancy include early isolation, 84 aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, empiric 85 antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), SARS-CoV-2 and co-infection testing, fetal 86 and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory 87 failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multi-specialty 88 consultations. 89 Information on the COVID-19 is increasing rapidly. Clinicians should continue to follow 90 the CDC website to stay up-to-date with the latest information. 91 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html
