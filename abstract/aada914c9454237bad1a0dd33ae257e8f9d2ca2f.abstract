Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of and factors associated with H1N1 preventive behaviors in a community-based population. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in three urban and two rural communities in Korea. Interviews were conducted with 3462 individuals (1608 men and 1854 women) aged ! 19 years during FebruaryeMarch 2010. Influenzarelated information including anxiety, preventive behaviors and their perceived effectiveness, vaccination status, past influenza-like illness symptoms, and sources of and trust in information was obtained. Results: Among 3462 participants, 173 reported experiencing influenza-like illness symptoms within the past 12 months. The mean H1N1 preventive behavior score was 25.5 AE 5.5 (out of a possible 40). The percent of participants reporting high perceived effectiveness and high anxiety was 46.2% and 21.4%, respectively. After controlling for potential confounders, H1N1 preventive behavior scores were predicted by a high (b Z 3.577, p < 0.001) or moderate (b Z 2.529, p < 0.001) perception of their effectiveness. Similarly, moderate (b Z 1.516, p < 0.001) and high (b Z 4.103, p < 0.001) anxiety scores predicted high preventive behavior scores. Conclusion: Effective methods of promoting population behavior change may be nationwide campaigns through mass media, as well as education and promotion by health care providers and broadcasters.
