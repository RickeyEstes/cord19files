Wasting" or "fading" syndromes are common causes of death in both puppies and kittens. These poorly defined syndromes are generally characterized by anorexia, lethargy, and emaciation during the first few weeks of life and often lead to death with no apparent cause. The terms "wasting" and "fading" describe this general syndrome and will be used interchangeably throughout this article. The fading syndrome can cause major problems in breeding colonies, especially if inbreeding has occurred. 11 Many possible causes have been suggested, including viral infections, bacterial septicemias, nutritional inadequacies, toxins, and environmental factors. 6 • 7 • 11 • 27 • 28 • 31 ·33. 4 0-4 2 • 44 Several of these factors are probably capable of causing neonatal wasting and death and should be considered in a differential diagnosis. Infectious canine hepatitis virus and beta-hemolyt!c streptococcus infection in puppies 7 • 28 • 44 and feline infectious peritonitis infection in kittens 6 • 27 · 31 • 33 • 40 · 41 have been strongly implicated as causes of fading and death iii some cases. However, several authors have reported that infectious agents could not be isolated from a large proportion of puppies and kittens that fade and die, and that lesions severe enough to cause death could not be.found. 6 • 7 • 11 • 20 • 33 • 42 Therefore, the cause of the fading syndrome remains a mystery in most cases. The status of the thymus gland has not received adequate attention in diagnosis and therapy of wasting syndromes of puppies and kittens. In some species, neonatal thymectomy results in a fatal wasting syndrome 17 • 29 that can be prevented by soluble factors from the thymus. 25 • 32 This article will focus on the role of the thymus gland in maintaining the health of young animals and on how thymus dysfunction may contribute to some cases of wasting and death. Current knowledge about thymus hormones will be reviewed bfiefly, and
