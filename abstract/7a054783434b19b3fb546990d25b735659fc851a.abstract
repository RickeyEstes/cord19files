The life cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has an absolute requirement for ribosomal frameshifting during protein translation in order to produce the polyprotein precursor of the viral enzymes. While an RNA stemloop structure (the "HIV-1 Frameshift Stimulating Signal", or HIV-1 FSS) controls the frameshift efficiency and has been hypothesized as an attractive therapeutic target, developing compounds that selectively bind this RNA and interfere with HIV-1 replication has proven challenging. Building on our prior discovery of a "hit" molecule able to bind this stem-loop, we now report the development of compounds displaying high affinity for the HIV-1 FSS. These compounds are able to enhance frameshifting more than 50% in a dual-luciferase assay in human embryonic kidney cells, and they strongly inhibit the infectivity of pseudotyped HIV-1 virions. a Error represents standard error on the global fit of at least five sensorgrams. Compound injection was repeated twice at each concentration to verify consistency. Data for compound 3 is from ref 35. Conditions: (a) HBS buffer (0.01 M HEPES, 0.150 M NaCl, pH = 7.4); (b) 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.005% Tween-20.
