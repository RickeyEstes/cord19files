Nielsen, K.H., Wright, P.F., Kelly, W.A. and Cherwonogrodzky, J.H., 1988. A review of enzyme immunoassay for detection of antibody to BruceUa abortus in cattle. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol., Enzyme immunoassay has gained wide acceptance for serological diagnosis of bovine brucellosis because of its ability to detect antibody of all isotypes unlike the conventional tests. The indirect enzyme immunoassay, however, presents several parameters that require careful analysis. These parameters include the choice of antigen and antiglobulin-enzyme conjugate reagents for use in the assay, dealing with the large amount of data the semi-automatic or automatic assay can generate and the inter-and intralaboratory standardization and quality control. This review considers the various methods described in the literature and, briefly, how some of the problems have been overcome or how they might be dealt with.
