Abstract: 25 26 Macroscopic descriptions of populations commonly assume that encounters between 27 individuals are well mixed; i.e., each individual has an equal chance of coming into contact with 28 any other individual. Relaxing this assumption can be challenging though, due to the difficulty 29 of acquiring detailed knowledge about the non-random nature of encounters. Here, we fitted a 30 mathematical model of dengue virus transmission to spatial time series data from Pakistan and 31 compared maximum-likelihood estimates of "mixing parameters" when disaggregating data 32 across an urban-rural gradient. We show that dynamics across this gradient are subject not 33 only to differing transmission intensities but also to differing strengths of nonlinearity due to 34 differences in mixing. We furthermore show that neglecting spatial variation in mixing can lead 35 to substantial underestimates of the level of effort needed to control a pathogen with vaccines 36 or other control efforts. We complement this analysis with relevant contemporary environmental 37 drivers of dengue. 38 39
