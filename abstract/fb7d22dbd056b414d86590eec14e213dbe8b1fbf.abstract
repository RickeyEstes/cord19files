Viruses hijack host-cell functions and optimize them for viral replication causing a severe threat to human health. However, viruses are also tools to understand cell biology and they may be effective reagents in nanomedicine. Studies from the molecular to cellular levels are aimed at understanding the details of viral life cycles and the underlying virus-host interactions. Recent developments in electron microscopy tomography allow viral and cellular events to be observed in fine structural detail in three-dimensions. By combining highresolution structures of individual proteins and macrocomplexes obtained by crystallography and electron cryomicroscopy and image reconstruction with reconstructions performed on subtomographic volumes, electron tomography has advanced the structural and mechanistic understanding of virus infections both in vitro and in host cells.
