Diversity' is now a magic word, showing up everywhere and often used to embrace many aspects of human activity, whether in government, the arts, sciences, research, choice of research subjects or so on. In many respects diversity represents an encompassing teamwork, and we all know the success of teams in sports in popular terms and the rewards of successful research teams. Thus, we can safely conclude that a diverse team can be a creative team since when investigators of different points of view are brought together, they ponder and question the interpretations, procedures and practices of others. Such is the case for the scientific approach (1). Thus, often butting heads, sometimes even locking horns in healthy debate, is most often resolved by the emergence of creativity. I will now propose several ways in which eCAM approaches the question of diversity and I hope that in the process we also engage in this act of creation. First, the editorial board of eCAM is one that is diverse, and to ensure one aspect of creativity, many of us have never worked together, thus allowing for the infusion of different points of view. Our first purpose in establishing the eCAM editorial board has been to gather a mixture of experienced biomedical scientists and to combine them with newcomers from a variety of fields who are willing to embrace CAM and to extend themselves beyond their better known academic classifications or 'pigeonholes'. As one of our bases is in Japan, our search for diversity began in Asia at biomedical conferences and research centers in Japan,
