Hohdatsu, T., Eiguchi, Y., Tsuchimoto, M., Ide, S., Yamagishi, H. and Matumoto, M., 1987. Antigenic variation of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus detected by monoclonal antibodies. Vet. Microbiol., 14: 115-124. Mouse myeloma cells (SP2/O) were fused with spleen cells from BALB/c mice immunized with detergent-solubilized antigen of purified virus, and 21 monoclonal (MC) antibodies reactive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the T0-163 strain of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus were obtained. Of these MC antibodies, 14, 6 and 1 were IgG1, IgG2a and IgM, respectively. All of the MC antibodies contained light chains of the kappa type. Of these MC antibodies, 8 were found to have neutralization (NT) activity against the T0-163 strain. Comparison of 7 strains of TGE virus by NT tests using our panel of MC antibodies confirmed their close antigenic relationships, but also revealed the occurrence of distinct antigenic differences. These results suggest that there may be at least 6 different epitopes involved in NT reaction on the virion of the T0-163 strain. This notion was confirmed by the competitive binding assay.
