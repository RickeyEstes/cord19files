Chapes, S.K., Chitko, C.G., Thaler, R.C., Nelssen, J.L., Anderson, G.A. and Blecha, F., 1989. Activated porcine alveolar macrophages: are biological response modifiers the answer? Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol., 22: 91-99. We report that 75% of conventionally housed 3-to 4-week-old swine already have detectable activated alveolar macrophages as measured by cytotoxicity of tumor cells. These macrophages can not be further activated by the biological response modifier N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-Disoglutamine-2H20 (MDP). These macrophages lose cytotoxic activity when cultured for 24 h and this loss of activity can not be reversed by MDP. We suggest that MDP biological response modifier therapy of swine alveolar macrophages may not be a useful technique in preventing respiratory disease in swine.
