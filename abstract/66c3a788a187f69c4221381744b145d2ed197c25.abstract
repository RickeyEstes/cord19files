For many years it was difficult to persuade pig farmers and their veterinarians that pig herds could become infected by windborne spread. This was in spite of the high breakdown rate of minimal disease herds with enzootic pneumonia many of which could not be explained in any other way (Goodwin, 1985) . The sequence of events that gradually began to change their view was the epidemic of foot-andmouth disease (FMD) in England in 1967-68, followed by the research carried out at the Animal Virus Research Laboratory at Pirbright, culminating in the astonishing spread of FMD from Brittany in France to southern England in 1981. The main methods of spread of FMD are through the movement of animals, animal products, vehicles, and people, but in the epidemic that occurred in 1967-68 it became clear that an important mechanism of spread was wind. Following that epidemic, intensive research was carried out on the factors influencing the airborne excretion, transmission and survival of FMD virus under experimental conditions. Pigs were found to be the biggest shedders, one pig being capable of excreting 400 million infectious units per day. Airborne spread is usually from pigs at source to cattle downwind Donaldson, 1993, pers. comm.). The most critical factor influencing airborne survival is relative humidity; high humidity favouring virus survival, low humidity causing inactivation. Spread of virus is most likely when the wind is constant with a low to moderate speed and less likely in gusty conditions. A flat terrain or an expanse of water favours long distance spread. A computerized prediction model was derived through the unusual collaboration of veterinary virologists and meteorologists (Gloster et al., 1981 . These workers retrospectively examined the spread of FMD in previous outbreaks and found that when the climatic conditions had been conducive it had taken a predictable course following the direction of the wind. Over water itappeared to have travelled long distances. Over land it had not travelled so far. Sellers and Gloster (1980) presented evidence that the virus had been carried 20 km in an outbreak in Northumbria in 1966. In March 1981, the French veterinary authorities reported outbreaks of FMD in four pig farms in the C0tes-du-Nord department of Brittany. The meteorological conditions were exactly right and the model initially predicted that the infection would be carried about 300 km to the south coast of England and a little later that it would reach the coast near Southampton. It did. There was an outbreak in cattle on the Isle of Wight and the virus was shown to be virtually identical to that in the outbreaks in Brittany . Tracings of other possible sources drew a blank.
