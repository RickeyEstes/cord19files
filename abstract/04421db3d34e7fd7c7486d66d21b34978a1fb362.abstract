Given the pleiotropic effects of type I IFNs (Uzé et al., 2007) , we assessed the ability of Ifnar −/− and WT Ly49H + NK cells to expand in response to MCMV infection using an adoptive cotransfer system (Sun et al., 2012) where both transferred NK cell populations respond against virus and experience similar inflammatory cues within the same host environment. WT and Ifnar −/− NK cells were cotransferred into Ly49H-deficient mice, whose NK cells are unable to recognize the virus-encoded glycoprotein m157 during MCMV infection and undergo clonal expansion (Sun et al., 2009) . In contrast to the WT NK cells that robustly expanded after MCMV infection, Ifnar −/− NK cells failed to expand robustly ( Fig. 1 A) . Although they exhibited an expansion defect, Ifnar −/− NK Type I interferon (IFN) is crucial in host antiviral defense. Previous studies have described the pleiotropic role of type I IFNs on innate and adaptive immune cells during viral infection. Here, we demonstrate that natural killer (NK) cells from mice lacking the type I IFN-α receptor (Ifnar −/− ) or STAT1 (which signals downstream of IFN AR) are defective in expansion and memory cell formation after mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. Despite comparable proliferation, Ifnar −/− NK cells showed diminished protection against MCMV infection and exhibited more apoptosis compared with wild-type NK cells. Furthermore, we show that Ifnar −/− NK cells express increased levels of NK group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligands during viral infection and are susceptible to NK cell-mediated fratricide in a perforin-and NKG2D-dependent manner. Adoptive transfer of Ifnar −/− NK cells into NK cell-deficient mice reverses the defect in survival and expansion. Our study reveals a novel type I IFN-dependent mechanism by which NK cells evade mechanisms of cell death after viral infection.
