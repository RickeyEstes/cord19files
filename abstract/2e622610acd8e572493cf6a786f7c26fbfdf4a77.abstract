The process of translating strategic sustainability objectives into concrete action at project-specific levels is a difficult task. The multidimensional perspectives of sustainability such as economy, society, environment, combined with a lack of structured methodology and information at various hierarchical levels, further exacerbate the problem. This paper (Part 1 of a two-part series) proposes an analytical decision model and a structured methodology for sustainability appraisal in infrastructure projects. The paper uses the Fweighted sum model_ technique in multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and the Fadditive utility model_ in analytical hierarchical process (AHP) for multicriteria decision making, to develop the model from first principles. It discusses the development of key performance indicators encapsulated within the analytical model. It concludes by discussing other potential applications of the proposed model and methodology for process automation as part of integrated sustainability appraisal in infrastructure design and construction. Part 2 uses a case study to demonstrate the model application in infrastructure sustainability appraisal at design stages. The paper also discusses the challenges for sustainability research, and gives recommendations. D
