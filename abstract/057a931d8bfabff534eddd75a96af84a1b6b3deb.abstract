Dengue is the most widespread vector-borne viral disease caused by dengue virus (DENV) for which there are no safe, effective drugs approved for clinical use. Here, by using sequential antigen panning of a yeast antibody library derived from healthy donors against the DENV envelop protein domain III (DIII) combined with depletion by an entry defective DIII mutant, we identified a cross-reactive human monoclonal antibody (mAb), m366.6, which bound with high affinity to DENV DIII from all four DENV serotypes. Immunogenetic analysis indicated that m366.6 is a germline-like mAb with very few somatic mutations from the closest VH and Vλ germline genes. Importantly, we demonstrated that it potently neutralized DENV both in vitro and in the mouse models of DENV infection without detectable antibodydependent enhancement (ADE) effect. The epitope of m366.6 was mapped to the highly conserved regions on DIII, which may guide the design of effective dengue vaccine immunogens. Furthermore, as the first germline-like mAb derived from a naïve antibody library that could neutralize all four DENV serotypes, the m366.6 can be a tool for exploring mechanisms of DENV infection, and is a promising therapeutic candidate. Dengue virus infects 50-100 million people each year. Infection is initiated by entry of the virus into cells mediated by the viral envelope glycoproteins. There are four closely related PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.DENV serotypes, but they all are antigenically distinct, with each comprising several genotypes that exhibit differences in their infection characteristics in both the mosquito vector and in the human host. One of the confounding problems that has faced vaccine and biological drugs development for decades is the inability of antibodies to one serotype to protect against infection by another one. Instead, the induced humoral immune response to one dengue virus infection can enhance the infection and disease processes brought by a subsequent infection with another dengue serotype. In this study, by using a competitive sorting strategy to interrogate a human naïve antibody library, we identified a cross-reactive mAb, designated as m366.6, against the four DENV serotypes. The mAb m366.6 possesses only few somatic mutations from the closest VH and Vλ germline genes and high affinity to DIII. Most importantly, the germline-like m366.6 demonstrated a broad spectrum of neutralization against the four DENV serotypes. Thus, m366.6 is a promising candidate therapeutics and its epitope may imply on the design of effective vaccine immunogens to elicit m366.6-like antibodies in vivo.

The DENV E protein is consist of DI, DII and DIII, which are shown in green, cyan, and light pink, respectively. The scFv was displayed as an Aga2p (rose red) fusion protein on the surface of yeast. Antibody expression can be detected by using fluorescent anti-c-Myc antibody (green), and binding of the scFv to the biotinylated DIII can be detected using PE-conjugated streptavidin (red). HA, hemagglutinin; VL, variable light chain; VH, variable heavy chain; (G 4 S) 3 , (Gly 4 Ser) 3 -flexible peptide linker. (B) Schematic of the scFv panning process. The biotinylated DIII, shown with a fluorescent tag colored in red, was used as the antigen for bio-panning, and ten times concentration of unbiotinylated DIII K310E mutant was used as the competitor. MACS and FACS-based sorting strategies were used to isolate high affinity binders from the yeast-displayed antibody library.
