The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a serious life-threatening and strikingly mortal respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV which contains a chymotrypsin-like main protease analogous to that of the main picornavirus protease, 3CL pro . 3CL pro plays a pivotal role in the viral replication cycle and is a potential target for SARS inhibitor development. A series of isatin derivatives as possible SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors was designed, synthesized, and evaluated by in vitro protease assay using fluorogenic substrate peptide, in which several showed potent inhibition against the 3CL pro . Structureactivity relationship was analyzed, and possible binding interaction modes were proposed by molecular docking studies. Among all compounds, 8k 1 showed most potent inhibitory activity against 3CL pro (IC 50 = 1.04 lM). These results indicated that these inhibitors could be potentially developed into anti-SARS drugs.
