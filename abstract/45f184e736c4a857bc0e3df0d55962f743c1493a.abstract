One central goal of genome biology is to understand how the usage of the genome differs between 12 organisms. Our knowledge of genome composition, needed for downstream inferences, is critically 13 dependent on gene annotations, yet problems associated with gene annotation and assembly errors are 14 usually ignored in comparative genomics. Here we analyze the genomes of 68 species across 12 animal 15 phyla and some single-cell eukaryotes for general trends in genome composition and transcription, taking 16 into account problems of gene annotation. We show that, regardless of genome size, the ratio of introns to 17 intergenic sequence is comparable across essentially all animals, with nearly all deviations dominated by 18 increased intergenic sequence. Genomes of model organisms have ratios much closer to 1:1, suggesting that 19 the majority of published genomes of non-model organisms are underannotated and consequently omit 20 substantial numbers of genes, with likely negative impact on evolutionary interpretations. Finally, our 21 results also indicate that most animals transcribe half or more of their genomes arguing against differences 22 in genome usage between animal groups, and also suggesting that the transcribed portion is more 23 dependent on genome size than previously thought. 24 33 34 As the number of genome projects has grown, massive amounts of data have become available to study 35 how organisms organize and use their genomes. Genome projects vary substantially in quality of assembly 36 and annotation [3, 4] . Unfortunately, the predicted genes are often taken for granted as being correct when 37 these are only hypotheses of gene structure [5]. For example, one study found that almost half of the genes 38 in the Rhesus monkey genome had a predictable annotation error when compared to the closest human 39 homolog [6]. This has profound implications for all downstream analyses, such as studying evolution of 40 1 .

When considered 41 across all genes, systematic errors in genome assembly or annotation would severely skew bulk parameters 42 of a genome. While issues of assembly are often thought to be technical problems that are resolved before continuing, 45 all subsequent analyses are dependent upon accurate genome assembly and annotation. The absence of a 46 protein family in a particular organism is only meaningful if it is certain that it is absent from the genome 47 and not merely the annotation, therefore it is of utmost importance that all genes are properly represented. Yet for most genome projects of non-model organisms, there are limited methods to determine if the assem-49 bly and annotation are sufficient for downstream comparative analyses. Internal metrics can be used, such 50 as the fraction of raw genomic reads or ESTs that map back to the assembly, though this does not tell us if a 51 gene is believable in the context of other animals. Alternatively, counts of "universal" single-copy orthologs 52 have been proposed as a metric of genome completeness [10, 11] , though these genes only represent a small 53 subset of all genes (few hundred out of tens of thousands in most animals). 54 55 Identification of universal trends in genome organization and transcription may enable better quantita-56 tive metrics of genome completeness. Mechanistic models relating to evolution of gene content or coding 57 fractions tended to focus on bacteria or archaea because of the relative ease of annotation. In regards to 58 eukaroytes, some patterns in genome size have been discussed [12-14]. Additionally, a handful of studies 59 have analyzed genome size in connection to other parameters such as indels [15], transposon content [16-19], 60 average intron length [20, 21] or total intron length [18]. Despite these advances, none of these studies have 61 estimated the amount of the genome that is genic (exonic plus intronic, including non-coding) based on in-62 dependent examination of single genomes and without averaging over a whole kingdom. Additionally, none 63 of them have described a way to account for technical problems in assembly and annotation. 64 65 Here we examine basic trends of genome size and the relationship to annotation quality across animals 66 and some single-celled eukaryotes. We show that assembly and annotation errors are widespread and pre-67 dictable and that many genomes are likely to be missing many genes. We further show that re-annotation 68 of select species with publicly available tools and transcriptome data improves the annotation. Future users 69 may benefit if databases incorporate more recent data from transcriptome sequencing, and update annota-70 tion versions more frequently. Comparison of genomic composition across many animal groups indicated a 71 ratio of introns:intergenic approaching 1:1, suggesting this as a potential parameter to identify genome com-72 pleteness across metazoans, and potentially other eukaryotes. Finally, this implies that animals transcribe 73 at least half of their genomes whereby small, exon-rich genomes transcribe most of the genome and large 74 genomes transcribe approximately half of the genome. 75 76 Methods 77 Genomic data sources 78 Data sources and parameters are available in Supplemental Table 1. 79 80 Genomic scaffolds and annotations for Ciona intestinalis [22], Branchiostoma floridae [23], Trichoplax ad-81 herens [24], Capitella teleta [25], Lottia gigantea [25], Helobdella robusta [25], Saccoglossus kowalevskii [26], 82 Monosiga brevicollis [27], Emiliania huxleyi [28], and Volvox carteri [29] were downloaded from the JGI 83 genome portal. 84 85 Genome assemblies and annotations for Sphaeroforma arctica, Capsaspora owczarzaki [30] and Salpin-86 goeca rosetta [31] were downloaded from the Broad Institute. 87 88 GFF annotations v2.1 [32] for Amphimedon queenslandica were downloaded from the Amphimedon 89 Genome website (http://amphimedon.qcloud.qcif.edu.au/downloads.html), and v1 annotations [33] and as-90 semblies were downloaded from Ensembl. 91 2 .
