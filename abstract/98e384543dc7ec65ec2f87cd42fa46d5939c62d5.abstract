In Schaffer's 1965 issue, Diseases of the no mention is made of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). In the 1971 issue,lo4 it is discussed only briefly. Although references are made to an entity resembling NEC in the 19th and early 20th ~enturies,4~, 89, 95 it generally was not recognized as a disease that affects primarily premature infants until the 1950s and 1960~,'~, 80, 99, which attests to its relatively infrequent incidence or recognition prior to modern neonatal intensive care. During the past two decades, improvements in mechanical ventilatory support coupled with prevention and treatment for pulmonary immaturity have signifi,cantly improved the survival rate of low birth weight neonates. Concurrently, the incidence of NEC has increased in most centers and has emerged as the most common gastrointestinal emergency in neonates, affecting 2000 to 4000 newborns in the United States each year.21, 22, 65, lo2, 116, lZ5 Of these, 10% to 50% die, resulting in approximately 1000 infant deaths per year.36 This number is close to the number of all US children fewer than 15 years of age who die of leukemia, or all children and adolescents fewer than 20 years who die of meningitis. The survivors of the acute episode of NEC frequently suffer with the effects of short bowel syndr0me,6~, which is a major cause of prolonged hospitalization and high medical expenses.
