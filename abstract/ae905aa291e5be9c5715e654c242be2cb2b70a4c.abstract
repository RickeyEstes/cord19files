Aspartame The synthetic low-calorie sweetener produced from L-phenylalanine and L-aspartic acid, having the structure L-phe-L-asp-methyl ester. BOTOX, BoNT, botulinum toxin The neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, responsible for food poisoning, which includes a zinc-dependent metalloprotease. Chymosin The predominant milk-clotting enzyme from the true stomach or abomasum of the suckling calf. Directed evolution Method used in protein engineering to harness the power of Darwinian selection to evolve proteins with desirable properties. Endoproteases Proteases that attack internal peptide bonds in the peptide chain remote from the C-or N-terminal. GRAS list A list of microorganisms used in fermentation and food processes, which are 'generally regarded as safe' by the US Food and Drug Administration. Heterologous protein production Synthesis of foreign proteins in a host organism following transformation of that organism by a vector carrying genes from a different organism. k-Casein in cheese coagulation k-Casein serves to maintain the micelles in milk in suspension. The cheese-making protease, rennet, hydrolyzes a single specific peptide bond in the k-casein fraction of milk resulting in destabilization of the milk micelles and coagulation. Protease engineering Techniques for creation of proteases with new or artificial amino acid sequences. Proteasome A large multicomponent barrel-like protease complex that digests a variety of proteins into short polypeptides and amino acids. Subtilisin A serine endopeptidase initially characterized from B. subtilis, but secreted in large amounts from many Bacillus species. Proteases represent a large and diverse group of hydrolytic enzymes that are classified by their site of action, enzyme active site structure, and specific reaction mechanisms. Proteases are ubiquitous in biology where they have a biochemical and/or physiological involvement in many aspects of cell and organism function, including nutrition, protein turnover, growth, adaptation, regulation, Comprehensive Biotechnology, 3rd edition, Volume 3 sporulation and germination, disease, and death. Proteases regulate much of what occurs in the human body including the essential cellular functions of differentiation, motility, division, and cell death. Proteases participate physiologically in intracellular protein-degradation processes using several systems, including lysosomes (membrane-bound organelles containing proteases) and the more recently characterized proteasome system, consisting of very large protein barrel-like stacked four-ringed complexes, the outer rings of which function as gates to proteins entering the central pore, while the interior surfaces of the inner rings contain the proteolytic active sites. 9 Proteasome proteolytic mechanisms involve an active site threonine, and involve three different chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing substrate specificities. Proteolysis is exploited physiologically for covalent activation, regulation, and inhibition of enzymes and other protein-based or linked effectors, for example, in the biochemical cascade leading to blood clotting and in production of insulin. Proteases remove signal sequences of peptides following their transport/secretion through membranes and they remove N-terminal methionine residues after translation. Animal, plant, and, especially, microbial proteases represent the largest and most important segment of an industrial enzyme market where they are used in detergents, in food processing, in the leather industry, as biocatalysts in organic synthesis, and as therapeutics. Because proteases also function as causative agents of some diseases, protease inhibitors have also been developed as a class of therapeutics. Commercial fermentation processes for production of microbial proteases were developed from about the 1950s. Some of the workhorse protease-producing strains, including Aspergillus, Rhizopus, and Bacillus species, were the same species as were found in traditional fermented food fermentations where their proteases participated in the degradation of proteins and associated development of distinct flavors in solid mash substrates containing soy beans, cereal grains, and other plant-based food materials. The protease production fermentation processes and conditions were optimized through characterization and control of factors affecting microbial growth and enzyme production. Overproducing strains were isolated through extensive screening processes and were further improved through application of elaborate mutation/selection procedures. Developments in genetic engineering, including the ability to express recombinant proteins in different host organisms and the ability to manipulate and enhance transcription, translation, secretion, and other processes, have been exploited to enhance protease production and underlining the technoeconomics of their use. The ability to engineer proteins to modify properties, such as kinetics, specificity, and stability, has been applied to improve or expand on protease applications. Random and site-directed mutagenesis and other techniques have been particularly useful in designing, constructing, and characterizing the biocatalytic and stability properties of wholly new protease structures. The estimated size of the industrial enzyme market is about $2.5-3 billion per year, which is made up of enzymes used in food processing ($$800 million), enzymes for animal feed ($$400 million), and nonfood/feed enzyme applications ($1.4-1.7 billion). Companies reported to have the largest share of the enzyme market are Novozymes ), with respective approximate market shares of 41%-44%, 21%, and 8%. Some Japanese Companies including Shin Nihon continue to produce and commercialize enzymes using the solid culture (koji) process (http://www.aichi-brand.jp/corporate/type/chemical/shin-nihon-e. html). The Amano Enzyme Group produces a more specialized range of enzymes with major applications in biotransformations, diagnostics, and as dietary supplements (http://www.amano-enzyme.co.jp/aeu/product/presentation.html). The indicated internet sites and others provide valuable information on the principal applications of proteases as well as on new research, technology, and links to technical reports and publications. Other companies mainly based in Asia, Europe, and North America account for the residual approximately 27%-30%. Proteases are thought to account for about 60% of the total enzyme market or $1.5-1.8 billion per year. Among protease applications, the most dominant use is in the detergents accounting for sales of alkaline protease of approximately $1 billion per year. Evidence of the importance of proteases in industry may also be gleaned from a simple search of granted US patents (1976-July 2010) and patent applications (2001-July 2010) on the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) site (http://patft.uspto.gov/ netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html) as is indicated in Table 1 . It should be noted that there is some overlap in the data since patents applied for and granted since 2001 will be counted under both headers. 'Protease' was used as the initial 'term' in the search, which was separately applied to the fields 'abstract' and 'claims'. In a second search, the search term 'protease inhibitor' was used. The presumption is that the difference between these two numbers, that is, proteases but not 'protease inhibitors', provides a good indication of numbers of granted patents and applications involving proteases. In the past 10 years, nearly 6000 patents have been filed with claims dealing with protease. Examples of some selected recent patents (2008-10) related to proteases and protease inhibitors issued by the US Patent Office are listed in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Notable among the protease patents are strain-and detergent-related proteases, animal-feed
