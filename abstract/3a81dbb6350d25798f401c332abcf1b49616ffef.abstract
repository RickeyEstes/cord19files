Development of antiviral therapeutics emphasizes minimization of the effective dose and maximization 16 of the toxic dose, first in cell culture and later in animal models. Long-term success of an antiviral 17 therapeutic is determined not only by its efficacy but also by the duration of time required for drug-18 resistance to evolve. We have developed a microfluidic device comprised of ~6000 wells, with each 19 well containing a microstructure to capture single cells. We have used this device to characterize 20 enterovirus inhibitors with distinct mechanisms of action. In contrast to population methods, single-cell 21 analysis reveals that each class of inhibitor interferes with the viral infection cycle in a manner that can 22
