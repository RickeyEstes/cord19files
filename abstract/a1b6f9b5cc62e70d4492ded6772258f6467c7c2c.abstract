We have obtained evidence (1) that distinct pathways of membrane glycoprotein transport exist in polarized epithelial cell monolayers, differing in their sensitivity to monensin, a sodium ionophore. Monensin blocks the transport of secretory and membrane glycoproteins at the level of the Golgi complex, which appears dilated as an effect of the drug (2). The replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which forms at basolateral membranes of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, was markedly inhibited by monensin, with a block occurring in the transport of the membrane glycoprotein, G, to the cell surface. On the other hand, VSV G protein appears to accumulate in membranes of the dilated Golgi apparatus of monensin-treated cells. In this report, we have investigated the effects of monensin on the kinetics of transport of viral membrane glycoproteins to the cell surface. We have also studied the effect of the ionophore on the directional transport of viral glycoproteins in MDCK cells doubly-infected with influenza virus and VSV, and on the replication of viruses that are assembled at intracellular membranes.
