Fordism A system of mass production and consumption that originated with Henry Ford, and led to stabilization of wage relations, guarding against overproduction or underconsumption through state entitlements, regulation of trade agreements, and a culture of mass consumption. Keynesianism A system of social entitlements that included unemployment insurance, health care, mother's allowance, and welfare, originating with John Maynard Keynes and instituted after the Great Depression of the 1930s in many industrialized nations. Neoliberalism A strategy of governance that attempts as much as possible to reduce a state's responsibility for social entitlements and to download responsibilities for care onto cities, communities, families, and individuals. Post-Fordism A globalized system of production and consumption characterized by the increasing use of robotics in production systems, externalizing uncertainties of the market to small-time suppliers who produce on demand (just in time), and the marketing of specialized goods to globalized "niches" of consumers. Post-Structuralism A movement in French continental philosophy centered on the destabilization of claims to truth and variously connected to the antihumanist rejection of a unified rational subject; a rejection of binary oppositions; and a view which sees knowledge as fluid, unstable, and discursively produced rather than ideological. When figures as divergent as conservative British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, and left leaning political philosopher, Ernesto Laclau, declare society is an "impossible object" we might askdwhy investigate the relationship between society and space? The topic appears so vast that when properly charteddlike Borges' famous map drawn at a 1:1 scaledso much ground is covered as to become practically and analytically useless. Moreover, the relationship would seem a truism: societies create spaces that best express their needs; spaces in turn constrain or enable societal developments. But how we conceive of this relationship subtends any attempt to understand, critique, or transform, the social world. Our understanding of society-space, as a totality, determines the vantage point from which we understand the social world. It locates these delimited processes, both literally and figuratively, in relation to a social whole. The first approach views society-space in terms of exploitative relations organized in a "structured coherence"da social formation, whose territorial boundaries loosely approximate politicojuridical boundaries. Rooted in a Marxist vision of social inequity, whereby societal relations are defined by exploitationdalienated labordits debates have focused on the logical primacy of particular unequal relations (classed, gendered, and racialized) and their attendant spatialities (workplace, home, underdeveloped neighborhoods, regions, and nations). The second approach sees society-space as a "strategic field"dconstituted through productive relations of governancedan occupied zone in which struggles resemble the engagements of a war. Underpinned by philosophical approaches rooted in the work of Foucault, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Clausewitz, in this view, societies are organized through a constellation of discursive logics, enacted in everyday spaces, and through these practices the abnormal are contained, controlled, excluded, or policed. The third sees society-space as "performative field", beginning with the premise that society is fundamentally unstable, its subjects perpetually hybridizing, caught in structured instabilitiesdin a social field that is conflictual and paradoxical. In the fourth approach, society-space is an "immanent field", an expression of continuous differentiation, its subjects are unstable because they continuously transform themselves, engaging in acts of conjunction, connection, or collaboration with their milieu. These four approaches share a recognition of persistent structural social inequities, a conviction that space is complicit in the production and possible transformation of these relationships, and the belief that one should not merely analyze societies but attempt to change themdto create a more equitable world. The contemporary view is that the relationship between the spatial and social is an iterative one. This is by now so commonplace as to seem self-evident. However, this insight has only recently returned to geography after a long conceptual slumber in the seductive embrace of mathematical description. Mathematical approaches enabled a complex description of either social or spatial processes, but little theorization, and as David Harvey noted, no strategy at the interface between the spatial and the social.
