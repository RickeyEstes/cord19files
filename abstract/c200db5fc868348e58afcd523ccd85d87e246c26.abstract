While T 4 wild-type DNA is not cleaved by restriction endonucleases, the DNA of a T4 mutant, in which 5'hydroxymethyl cytosine is replaced by cytosine (T4 dC-DNA), is digested by these enzymes. We have constructed physical maps of the celavage sites generated by the restriction endonucleases Smal/Xmal, Kpnl, SaU, BglII, Xhol and Xbal (1,2). These enzymes sub-divide T4 dC-DNA into 73 defined fragments. The alignment of the physical and the genetical maps then was achieved with three sorts of experiments: a) the identification of some EcoRl restriction fragments on the T 4 physical map which are known to carry defined T 4 genes (3, 4) b) the localization of the T 4 rII region with the aid of two deletion mutants c) the hybridization of early and late mRNA to the T 4 restriction fragments, which allows the identification of those restriction fragments carrying the early and the late regions. lInstitut fiir Virologie, FB Humanmedizin, Justus Neoplastic transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts by Rous sarcoma virus is accompanied by a number of structural alterations to the cell surface and to the cytoskeleton. These changes are induced by a single viral gene, termed src, which is known to code for a phosphoprotein, pp60src. To study the dynamics of the morphological changes, fibroblasts were infected with the temperature sensitive, transformation defective mutant viruses, ts NY68 at the restrictive temperature and transformation was then in- The viral structural protein p15 carries a restrictive proteolytic activity which cannot be dissociated from the viral protein during ion exchange chromatography and size frac-
