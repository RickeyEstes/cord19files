The coronavirus RNA polymerase gene encompasses about 20,000 nucleotides and comprises two large open reading frames (ORFs), ORF la and ORF lb, that overlap in the (-1) reading frame by approximately 40-80 nucleotides. Together, these two ORFs have the potential to encode polypeptides with a total molecular mass of 750,000-800,000. In vitro studies suggest that the downstream ORF lb is expressed by a mechanism involving (-1) ribosomal frameshifting, mediated by a "slippery" sequence and a tertiary structure, the RNA pseudoknot. These elements are positioned in the RNA polymerase mRNA (which is equivalent to the viral genomic RNA) in the region of the ORF la/ORF lb overlap. 1-6 Genetic analysis of coronavirus temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants, defective in RNA synthesis at the restrictive temperature, has identified a number of distinct viral functions required for the replication and transcription of genomic and subgenomic RNAs. Characterization of these mutants by recombination and sequence analysis has allowed these functions to be located and ordered within the RNA polymerase gene. Moreover, because the complementation frequencies of these mutants are indicative of intergenic rather than intragenic complementation, they provide clear evidence for the activity of proteinases that process the primary translation product(s) of the polymerase gene into smaller, functional polypeptides. 7-1Â°
