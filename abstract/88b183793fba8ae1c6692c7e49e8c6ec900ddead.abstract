The constituents of Cimicifuga plants have been extensively investigated, and the principal metabolites are 9,19cyclolanostane triterpenoid glycosides, which are distributed widely in Cimicifuga plants, but not in other members of the Ranunculaceae family, and are considered to be characteristics of the Cimicifuga genus. This type of triterpenoid glycoside possesses several important biological activities. More than 120 cycloartane triterpene glycosides have been isolated from Cimicifuga simplex Wormsk. The aim of this review article is to summarize all the major findings based on the available scientific literatures on C. simplex, with a focus on the identified 9,19-cyclolanostane triterpenoid glycosides. Biological studies of cycloartane triterpene glycosides from Cimicifuga spp. are also discussed.

In Chinese traditional medicine, as along with other Cimicifuga species, it has been used to clear heat, relieve toxicity, disperse exterior pathogen, promote eruption, and lift spirit [3] . Plant-based formulations for various medicinal applications use different preparation methods, including powders, alcohol extracts, water extracts, and honey processed pills. The roots of C. simplex have been used to treat headache, toothache, aphtha, sore throat, measles, rectocele, and uterine prolapse [11] . The most important biologically active components of C. simplex are the cycloartenol triterpenoid saponins which have good immunosuppressive activities [12] . C. simplex Wormsk. ex DC. (Shengma in Chinese) is a deciduous perennial herb, and is widely distributed in China [13] . Currently, more than 120 cycloartane-type triterpenoids from Cimicifuga simplex have been isolated by several groups [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , including compounds of cycloartanol type, 16,23-dione type, shengmanol type, hydroshengmanol type, cimifugenin type, cimiacerogenin type, and the cimigenol type. The chemical structures of these cycloartenol triterpenoid saponins are shown in Fig.s 1−7 and are listed in Table 1 . The isolation scheme WU Lun, et al. / Chin J Nat Med, 2015, 13(2): 8189 -82 -for the 9,19-cyclolanostane triterpenoid glycosides from C. simplex is shown in Fig. 8 .
