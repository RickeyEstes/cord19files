Gross examination of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of cattle is one of the most challenging parts of a necropsy. The GIT is one of the largest and heaviest organ systems of the animal. It is initially divided into the upper GIT (oral cavity, esophagus, forestomachs, abomasum) and the lower GIT (intestines, rectum, and anus). In healthy cattle, the forestomachs occupy more than half the abdominal cavity. The rumen ( Fig. 1) alone has a capacity range of 102 to 148 L (which approximates to a similar weight in kilograms), whereas the abomasal volume ranges from 10 to 20 L. 1 The intestines occupy a much smaller space in the peritoneal cavity but have a length that is considerable, ranging from 33 to 63 m. 1 Thus, a thorough examination is physically demanding because of its size and requires a significant proportion of time to adequately examine its entirety. In addition, the GIT is one of the few organ systems that normally contain a mixture of commensal and potentially pathogenic organisms. In health, there is continuous interaction between the host and microorgansims resulting in a perpetual steady state
