Background We compared the efficacy of medical masks, N95 respirators (fit tested and non fit tested), in health care workers (HCWs). Methods A cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) of 1441 HCWs in 15 Beijing hospitals was performed during the 2008 ⁄ 2009 winter. Participants wore masks or respirators during the entire work shift for 4 weeks. Outcomes included clinical respiratory illness (CRI), influenza-like illness (ILI), laboratoryconfirmed respiratory virus infection and influenza. A convenience no-mask ⁄ respirator group of 481 health workers from nine hospitals was compared. Findings The rates of CRI (3AE9% versus 6AE7%), ILI (0AE3% versus 0AE6%), laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus (1AE4% versus 2AE6%) and influenza (0AE3% versus 1%) infection were consistently lower for the N95 group compared to medical masks. By intentionto-treat analysis, when P values were adjusted for clustering, nonfit-tested N95 respirators were significantly more protective than medical masks against CRI, but no other outcomes were significant. The rates of all outcomes were higher in the convenience no-mask group compared to the intervention arms. There was no significant difference in outcomes between the N95 arms with and without fit testing. Rates of fit test failure were low. In a post hoc analysis adjusted for potential confounders, N95 masks and hospital level were significant, but medical masks, vaccination, handwashing and high-risk procedures were not.
