Hall (Bellingham, US) Phylogenetic trees are just tools for representing the relationships among organisms. The focus of this presentation is on the interpretation of phylogenetic trees, rather than on construction of those trees. Elements that will be considered are: what are branches and nodes and what do they mean? Trees are typically drawn so that they appear to depict the order of descent from common ancestors, i.e. the direction of evolution. That appearance is often misleading. Direction of evolution and order of descent are only shown by rooted trees, whereas most phylogenetic methods produce unrooted trees. What information is required to root a tree? Trees of microbial isolates often include zero-length branches. What do zero-length branches really mean? Trees are only estimates of historical relationships they are not facts. How do we determine the reliability of those estimated trees? Recombination can dramatically affect the validity of phylogenetic trees. What do we do when there is too much recombination to construct valid phylogenetic trees? Representations of strain similarities in molecular microbial typing P. Vauterin (Ghent, BE) This talk covers a variety of grouping techniques that are used to represent the relations between strains using molecular typing data. For each technique, the strong and weak points are discussed, and guidelines are given to come to a reliable interpretation of the results. The emphasis is on traditional hierarchical cluster analysis tools, and we elaborate on the limits of their applicability. In particular, the loss of information introduced by cluster analysis is discussed, as well as the problem to degenerate solutions. The particular challenges associated with the analysis and interpretation of modern large data sets potentially include thousands of organisms, which are also covered. We also discuss novel grouping techniques, such as minimum spanning trees and self-organizing maps, and show how these tools can be used complementary to traditional cluster analysis to gain further insight in the structure of the data. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of clinically relevant anaerobes in different clinical microbiological laboratories in Europe is less and less frequently carried out due to the fact, that clinicians treat many presumed anaerobic infections empirically. Even less data are available about the antibiotic resistance levels among the anaerobic normal flora isolates developed due to the use of antibiotics for infections caused by aerobic or facultative anaerobic pathogens. New antibiotics with anti-anaerobic activity may be tested on "old" isolates instead of using "recent" clinical isolates, which may create false susceptibility data and incorrect recommendations for treatment of anaerobic infections. Most systemic data in Europe are available for few genera and species of anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis and related species, Fusobacterium spp., Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. Two Europewide resistance studies were carried out during the past 15 years involving almost all European countries evaluating the development of resistance among B. fragilis and related species. A similar study was done with clinical isolates of Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococci. Expressed differences were found in resistance levels between different Bacteroides species and between different areas of Europe for clindamycin, erythromycin, ampicillin and moxifloxacin. The same is true for Propionibacterium acnes. Resistance genes responsible for carbapenem and nitro-imidazole resistance can be found more frequently among clinical and normal flora isolates, than the expressed resistance. Despite of the fact that most anti-anaerobic drugs show good activity against anaerobic clinical isolates, the number of the resistant isolates is increasing parallel with the time. Accumulation of resistance markers can be observed among Bacteroides strains. Reported cases will be discussed where clinical failure was due to the presence of multi-resistant anaerobic pathogens. S12 Infections associated with intravascular devices Notwithstanding the progress in our understanding of the pathogenesis of foreign body infection, catheter-related infection (CRI) continues to be part of the daily life in the ICU, oncology or haematology unit. The consequential morbidity and longer hospital stay brings about considerable costs. However, several interventions can reduce the incidence of CRI. 10 years ago, catheters coated or impregnated with antiseptics or antibiotics became part of our armament against CRI. However, indiscriminate prophylactic use of antibiotics increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore the minocyclin-rifampin impregnated catheter (the only antibiotic impregnated catheter with well documented efficacy) is not available in Europe. A catheter impregnated with chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine (CS) on the outer surface is available in Europe and has been shown to have the incidence of CRI. Two recent clinical studies show that an improved version of this catheter (with CS on the inner and outer surface) reduces catheter colonization with 45-72%. In vitro evidence about the use of antiseptic agents as a substitute for antibiotic locks for the prevention of endoluminal CRI is available. However, evidence from prospective randomized controlled clinical trials on the use of antiseptic locks is still scarce. Several clinical studies and a meta-analysis support the use of chlorhexidine as the preferred disinfectant prior to catheter insertion. Recent evidence supports the use of a chlorhexidine impregnated sponge that is placed around the insertion site of the catheter to prevent recolonization of the insertion site and therefore also exoluminal CRI of short-term central venous as well as arterial catheters. In general it is correct to state that microorganisms on the outer surface of the catheter (exoluminal) are the source of infection in most of the CRI in short-term catheters and microorganisms on the inner surface (endoluminal) become more important with longer duration of catheter use. This difference is however gradual. Therefore in most settings interventions directed against exoluminal as well as endoluminal CRI should be combined. Despite the abovementioned new developments, the implementation of a structured teaching program on CRI (with a special emphasis on the adherence to full-sterile barrier precautions, chlorhexidine based skin disinfections and removal of the catheter as soon as possible) remains the cornerstone of CRI prevention.
