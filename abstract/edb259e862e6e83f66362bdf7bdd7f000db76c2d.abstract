A b s t r a c t Objective: Terminological Systems (TSs) need to be maintained in order to sustain their utility. This paper describes a study aiming at the standardization of the maintenance processes of medical TSs by capturing the criteria for the management of the maintenance processes into a framework. Furthermore, this paper describes application of the framework, which sheds light on the current practice of TS maintenance. Design: Observational study. Measurements: By means of a literature study, criteria for the maintenance of TSs were obtained and categorized into a framework. The current practice of TS maintenance was explored by a survey among organizations that maintain a TS. Results were stratified by the size of the TS being maintained.
