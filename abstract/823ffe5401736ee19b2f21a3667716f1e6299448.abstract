During a natural outbreak of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), groups of piglets were treated orally for 4 consecutive days with placebo or 1.0, 10.0 or 20.0 international units (IU ) natural human interferon alpha (nHuIFNa ). Piglets that were I -12 days of age and given 1.0, 10.0 or 20.0 IU nHuIFNa had significantly (PcO.01) greater survival rates than placebo-treated piglets; survival rates were the greater for the highest level of nHuIFNcx treatment. In contrast, beneficial effects of nHuIFNcr were not observed in piglets farrowed during the disease outbreak and given nHuIFNa within hours of birth. Oral nHuIFNa! therapy modulates the natural course of high morbidity and mortality commonly seen with TGE. * Corresponding author. 0165-2427/95/$09.50 0 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.
