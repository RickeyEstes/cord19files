Kwang, J., Littledike, E.T., Bolin, S.R. and Collett, M.S., 1991. detection of BVDV infection with cloned cDNA probes. Vet. Microbiol., 28: 279-288. We have evaluated 24 cytopathic (CP) and 37 noncytopathic (NCP) strains of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) with a dot blot assay using four different genome segments of the NADL strain as hybridization probes (p80, p54, gp53, and gp62). The p80 and p54 probes hybridized to 23/24 (96%) and 22/24 (92%), respectively, of CP strains examined. In contrast, these same two probes only detected 16/37 (43%) and 5/37 (13%), respectively, of the NCP strains examined. The gp53 probe detected 18/24 ( 75% ) and the gp62 probe detected 19/24 (79%) of the CP strains. In contrast, these latter two probes only detected 9/37 (24%) and 7/37 (20%), respectively, of NCP strains. This tow detection rate of NCP strains suggests a need for developing a probe based on NCP sequences for identification of NCP strains.
