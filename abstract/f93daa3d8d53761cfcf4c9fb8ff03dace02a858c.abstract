Previously, the cyclophilin inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and Alisporivir (ALV) were shown to 26 inhibit the replication of diverse RNA viruses, including arteriviruses and coronaviruses, which both 27 belong to the order Nidovirales. Here we aimed to identify arterivirus proteins involved in the mode-28 of-action of cyclophilin inhibitors and to investigate how these compounds inhibit arterivirus RNA 29 synthesis in the infected cell. Repeated passaging of the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus 30 (EAV) in the presence of CsA revealed that reduced drug sensitivity is associated with the emergence 31 of adaptive mutations in nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), one of the transmembrane subunits of the 32 arterivirus replicase polyprotein. Introduction of singular nsp5 mutations (nsp5 Q21R, Y113H, or 33 A134V) led to a ~2-fold decrease in sensitivity to CsA treatment, whereas combinations of mutations 34 further increased EAV's CsA resistance. The detailed experimental characterization of engineered 35 EAV mutants harboring CsA-resistance mutations implicated nsp5 in arterivirus RNA synthesis. 36 Particularly, in an in vitro assay, EAV RNA synthesis was far less sensitive to CsA treatment when 37 nsp5 contained the adaptive mutations mentioned above. Interestingly, for increased sensitivity to the 38 closely-related drug ALV CsA-resistant nsp5 mutants required the incorporation of an additional 39 adaptive mutation, which resided in nsp2 (H114R), another transmembrane subunit of the arterivirus 40 replicase. Our study provides the first evidence for the involvement of nsp2 and nsp5 in the 41 mechanism underlying the inhibition of arterivirus replication by cyclophilin inhibitors. 42 43 44 All rights reserved.
