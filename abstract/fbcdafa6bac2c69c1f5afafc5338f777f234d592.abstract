Nearly all licensed vaccines confer protection against infectious diseases by stimulating the production of pathogen-specific Abs by B cells. Understanding the nature of a successful Ab response is therefore a fundamental step to providing new tools for the design of novel or better vaccines. The isolation and characterization of the Ab repertoire produced by antigen-specific B cells has acquired a central importance in the last decade to unravel the response to vaccine antigens. Dissecting the basic mechanisms that define the dynamics of the Ab responses to vaccination and deepening the Traditionally, vaccines have been developed by cultivating infectious agents and isolating the inactivated whole pathogen or some of its purified components. 20 years ago, reverse vaccinology enabled vaccine discovery and design based on information deriving from the sequence of microbial genomes rather than via the growth of pathogens. Today, the high throughput discovery of protective human antibodies, sequencing of the B cell repertoire, and the increasing structural characterization of protective antigens and epitopes provide the molecular and mechanistic understanding to drive the discovery of novel vaccines that were previously impossible. We are entering a "reverse vaccinology 2.0" era.
