Posttranslational modification of yeast glycoproteins with od,3-1inked mannose is initiated within a Golgi compartment analogous to the medial Golgi cisternae of higher eukaryotes. We have characterized the synthesis, posttranslational modification, and localization of the yeast od,3 mannosyltransferase (Mnnlp) using antibodies prepared against a segment of this protein expressed in bacteria. Mnnlp is initially synthesized as a 98.5-kD, type II integral membrane glycoprotein that is modified with both N-and O-linked oligosaccharides. It is subject to a slow, incremental increase in molecular mass that is dependent upon protein transport to the Golgi complex. Self-modification of Mnnlp with od,3 mannose epitopes, primarily on O-linked oligosaccharides, is at least partly responsible for the incremental increase in molecular mass.
