micafungin alone or in combination with another systemic antifungal agent. Criteria for IA and therapeutic responses were judged by an independent panel. Results: Of the 331 patients enrolled, only 225 met diagnostic criteria for IA as determined by the independent panel and received at least one dose of micafungin. Patients included 98/225 who had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (88/98 allogeneic), 48 with graft versus host disease (GVHD), and 83/ 225 who had received chemotherapy for hematologic malignancy. A favorable response rate at the end of therapy was seen in 35.6% (80/225) of patients. Of those only treated with micafungin, favorable responses were seen in 6/12 (50%) of the primary and 9/22 (40.9%) of the salvage therapy group, with corresponding numbers in the combination treatment groups of 5/17 (29.4%) and 60/174 (34.5%) of the primary and salvage treatment groups, respectively. Of the 326 micafungin-treated patients, 183 (56.1%) died during therapy or in the 6-week follow-up phase; 107 (58.5%) deaths were attributable to IA. Conclusions: Micafungin as primary or salvage therapy proved efficacious and safe in high-risk patients with IA, although patient numbers are small in the micafunginonly groups.
