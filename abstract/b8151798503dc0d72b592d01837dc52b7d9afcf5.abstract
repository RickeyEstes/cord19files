. Rapid detection of viral-specific antibodies by ELISA. Vet. I~unol. Immunopathol., 17: 453-464. The development of three separate rapid ELISAs for detecting antibodies in host serum to three different viruses is described. These include: 1. A direct antigen assay using enzyme labelled anti-canine Ig for detecting antibodies to canine parvovirus, 2. A competitive ELISA using a feline infectious peritonitis virus-specific monoclonal antibody labelled with enzyme, and 3. A competitive ELISA using an equine infectious anemia virus-specific monoclonal antibody and enzyme labelled antigen, p. 26. The utility and benefits of each of the three approaches is emphasized.
