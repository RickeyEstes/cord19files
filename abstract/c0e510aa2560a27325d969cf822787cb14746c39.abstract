. The treatment of fresh water and additives, control of the residence time in the storage tanks, and control of the stagnant flow areas should be done to control the contamination sources and the microbiological populations. Systematic maintenance and cleaning of the system by using different chemicals or treatments to reduce the formation of deposits and to eliminate the already formed deposits is required. A microbiological control program requires a good knowledge of the system and the main sources of contamination. Once the sources of contamination have been reduced, the paper manufacturer can control the microbiological populations of the system. Good housekeeping and regular inspection of all areas, effective boilouts, and regularly scheduled washup reduces slime development. To reduce the number of maintenance shutdowns in the paper machines, chemical products are introduced into the system to get rid of the microorganisms by preventing their growth or by reducing the harmful effects they produce. The chemical products most commonly used are dispersants and biocides. Other control methods are the enzymatic degradation of microbiological deposits and controlling the population by limiting nutrients
