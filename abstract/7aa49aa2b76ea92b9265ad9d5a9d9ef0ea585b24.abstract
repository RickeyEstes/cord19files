17 18 Background: Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase 19 when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. Therefore, this study aims to 20 examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the 21 COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong. 22 23 Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 24 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for 25 survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve 26 .

Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high 30 perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily 31 routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and 32 Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Nearly all respondents were alert to the disease 33 progression (99.5%). The most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast 34 (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 35 34%; newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. Enhanced personal 36 hygiene practices and travel avoidance to China were frequently adopted (>77%) and considered 37 effective (>90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers 38 for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New 39 Territories (aOR:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and 40 being more anxious (aOR:1.07). 41 42 Discussion: Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high. Most respondents are alert 43 to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures. This study contributes by examining the 44 psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied mechanistic aspects, during the 45 early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic. The timely psychological and behavioral assessment of 46 the community is useful to inform subsequent interventions and risk communication strategies as the 47 epidemic progresses. 48 49
