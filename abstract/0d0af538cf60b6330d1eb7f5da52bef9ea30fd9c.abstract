W e are gratified that Ron Fouchier has joined (1) the important effort to quantify the risks (2-5) of the creation of potential pandemic pathogens, including ferret-transmissible variants of influenza A/H5N1. However, we disagree with many aspects of his assessment. As in our article and Fouchier's letter, here we proceed through the calculation, starting with probability of laboratory-acquired infections and the conditional probability of sparking a pandemic given such an infection and concluding with the consequences thereof. We then discuss some more general considerations. Fouchier bases his calculations on one of the sources we also used, the tabulation by Henkel et al. of reports of accidents involving select agents in the United States between 2004 and 2010 (6). However, he argues that the risk in his laboratory is considerably lower than the lower bound obtained from these reports of 0.2% per laboratory-year in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory. He states, "These estimates, however, do not take into account specific pathogen types or research settings. This is crucial, because working practices in, e.g., virology and microbiology laboratories are different and because each biosafety laboratory is unique" (1). He proposes an alternative calculation based on 0 viral laboratoryacquired infections (LAI) in BSL3 labs over 2,044 lab-years in BSL2, -3, and -4 labs with select agents (6) and suggests that the proper value is Ͻ1/2,044 lab-years, or Ͻ5 ϫ 10 Ϫ4 /lab-year. These numbers are both conceptually and statistically invalid. While bacteriology and virology labs certainly perform some different activities, neither the references cited by Fouchier nor any other evidence of which we are aware justifies the relevant claim: that BSL3 bacteriology labs are more accident-prone than BSL3 virology labs over a given time span. Absent any such evidence, the proper comparison would be BSL3 LAI/BSL3 lab-years. Unfortunately, BSL3 lab-years are not publicly available. Therefore, in our original calculation, we used 2,044 lab-years in BSL2, -3, and -4 labs as a denominator to calculate a lower bound on the risk, with LAI in BSL3 as the numerator. Fouchier's suggestion to use the same (too-large) denominator to form an upper bound is inappropriate and is made more so by excluding bacterial LAI from the numerator but keeping bacterial lab-years in the denominator. If one does choose to use 0 viral LAIs as the numerator, one would need to specify the number of viral BSL3 lab-years for a proper denominator. In this case, given the uncertainty surrounding a rare event, the proper way to account for 0 observed events is not to say that the true rate is less than one divided by the number of lab-years, but that the true rate has a 95% confidence interval Citation Lipsitch M, Inglesby TV. 2015.
