Remyelination is the phenomenon by which new myelin sheaths are generated around axons in the adult central nervous system (CNS). This follows the pathological loss of myelin in diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). Remyelination can restore conduction properties to axons (thereby restoring neurological function) and is increasingly believed to exert a neuroprotective role on axons. Remyelination occurs in many MS lesions but becomes increasingly incomplete/inadequate and eventually fails in the majority of lesions and patients. EVorts to understand the causes for this failure of regeneration have fueled research into the biology of remyelination and the complex, interdependent cellular and molecular factors that regulate this process. Examination of the mechanisms of repair of experimental lesions has demonstrated that remyelination occurs in two major phases. The first consists of colonization of lesions by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), the second the diVerentiation of OPCs into myelinating oligodendrocytes that contact demyelinated INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF 589 NEUROBIOLOGY, VOL. 79
