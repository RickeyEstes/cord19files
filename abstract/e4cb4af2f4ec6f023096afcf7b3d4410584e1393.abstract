Human gremlin-1 is a physiologically versatile signaling molecule that has been associated with several human diseases including cancer. The ability of gremlin-1 to induce fibrosis in organs and transduce angiogenesis makes it a target for cancer therapy. RNAi-based therapy has proven to be very efficient and specific in tumor growth inhibition. The efficacy and specificity of siRNA-mediated gene silencing depends on the designing approaches. Here, empirical guidelines for siRNA design and comprehensive target site availability analysis were used to select effective siRNA from a plethora of potential candidates designed using several computation algorithms. Then, the selected siRNA candidates were subjected to stringent similarity searches in order to obtain siRNA candidates with reduced off-target effects (high specificity). The best candidates were compared to experimentally successful gremlin-1 siRNAs in order to predict the silencing potency of the selected siRNAs. siRNA-6 (sense strand: 5'-CCAAGAAAUUCACUACCAU-3'), siRNA-7 (sense strand: 5'-CCAUGAUGGUCACACUCAA-3') and siRNA-47 (sense strand: 5'-GGCCCAGCACAAUGACUCA-3') were predicted to be highly effective siRNA candidates for gremlin-1 silencing. These siRNAs can be considered for RNAi-based therapy because off-target effects are predicted to be minimal.
