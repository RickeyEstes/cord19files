20 E-probe Diagnostic for Nucleic acid Analysis (EDNA) is a bioinformatic tool originally 21 developed to detect plant pathogens in metagenomic databases. However, 22 enhancements made to EDNA increased its capacity to conduct hypothesis directed 23 detection of specific gene targets present in transcriptomic databases. To target specific 24 pathogenicity factors used by the pathogen to infect its host or other targets of interest, 25 e-probes need to be developed for transcripts related to that function. In this study, 26 EDNA transcriptomics (EDNAtran) was developed to detect the expression of genes 27 related to aflatoxin production at the transcriptomic level. E-probes were designed from 28 genes up-regulated during A. flavus aflatoxin production. EDNAtran detected gene 29 transcripts related to aflatoxin production in a transcriptomic database from corn, where 30 aflatoxin was produced. The results were significantly different from e-probes being 31 used in the transcriptomic database where aflatoxin was not produced (atoxigenic AF36 32 strain and toxigenic AF70 in Potato Dextrose Broth). 33 34 Maize [1], peanuts [2], tree nuts, dried spices [3] and cottonseed [4] are crops that can 35 be infected during the pre-harvest, post-harvest and/or storage period with Aspergillus 36 flavus Link. This fungus produces polyketide secondary metabolites named aflatoxins. 37
