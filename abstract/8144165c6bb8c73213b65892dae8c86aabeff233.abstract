Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were coated on a sample of glass fiber air filter medium at atmospheric pressure and room temperature using electro-aerodynamic deposition (EAD). In the EAD method, CNTs (diameter: 50 nm, length: 2-3 lm) were aerosolized, electrically charged, and injected through a nozzle. A voltage was applied externally between the ground nozzle and a planar electrode on which the sample was located. The charged CNTs were deposited on the sample in a vertically standing posture even at a low flow velocity. Before the deposition experiment, a calculation was performed to determine the applied voltage by simulating the electric field, flow field, and particle trajectory. Using CNT-coated filter samples, virus aerosol filtration and anti-viral tests were carried out using the aerosol number counting method and the plaque counting method, respectively. For this purpose, bacteriophage MS2 was aerosolized with an atomizer. The particle filtration efficiency was increased to 33.3% in the most penetration particle size zone (100 nm) and the antiviral efficiency of the CNT filter was 92% when the coating areal density was 1.5 Â· 10 9 #/cm 2 . The susceptibility constant of virus to CNTs was 0.2 cm 2 /lg. (J. Hwang).
