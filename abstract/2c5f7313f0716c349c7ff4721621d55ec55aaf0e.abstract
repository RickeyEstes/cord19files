Many viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm compartmentalize their genome replication and transcription in organelle-like structures that enhance replication efficiency and protection from host defenses. In particular, recent studies with diverse positive-strand RNA viruses have further elucidated the ultrastructure of membrane-bound RNA replication complexes and how these complexes function in close coordination with virion assembly and budding. The structure, function, and assembly of some positive-strand RNA virus replication complexes have parallels and potential evolutionary links with the replicative cores of doublestrand RNA virus and retrovirus virions and more general similarities with the replication factories of cytoplasmic DNA viruses. .
