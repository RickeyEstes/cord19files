The combination of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, and malaise is the symptomatic profile that constitutes an uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection (URI), also known as the common cold. It is a pervasive illness; approximately 25 million people in the United States visit their doctor every year seeking treatment for a URI. 1 Nationally, the economic burden of URI is estimated to be approximately $40 billion per year, including $22 billion from nearly 200 million lost work days every year. 2 Because no known cure exists for the common URI, numerous products are available for treatment, each marketed with the promise of alleviating the associated symptoms and/or shortening the duration of illness.

Treatment of URI remains focused on symptom management and the tincture of time. Antibiotics and surgery have no role in the treatment of an uncomplicated URI.
