The Gillespie Algorithm 693 In the section "Predicting epidemic behavior", we discussed that to use Eq. (11) to 694 project the expected behavior of an epidemic outcome Z using the accrued observation 695 Y i at time t i , one needs access to a stochastic simulator to sample from the random 696 variable Z|ν i for a given set of parameter values θ. We use the Gillespie algorithm [40] 697 for this purpose. To describe the steps of the Gillespie algorithm, we consider an 698 epidemic model with K compartments (e.g. in the model described in ➜ "Design of the 699 Performance Analysis", K = 4). Let ν(t) = (ν 1 (t), ν 2 (t), . . . , ν K (t)) denote the state of 700 the epidemic at time t, where ν k (t) denotes the number of individuals in compartment 701 k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , K} at time t. The state of an epidemic (i.e. ν(t)) may change due to the occurrence of specific 703 events, such the transmission of the disease to a susceptible or the recovery from the 704 disease. We use Q to denote the number of such events. In the model shown in Fig 3, 705 these epidemic events include Infection, Seeking Treatment, and Recovery (and hence 706 Q = 3). Let Λ q (ν(t), θ) denote the rate at which the event q is occurring when the 707 epidemic is at state ν(t) and with parameter values θ that is a transformation of the 708 parameter θ. Note that the stochastic model usually uses a volume dependent transformation of 710 the parameter θ from the ODE model. We do not need this transformation as our ODE 711 description is volume independent. In the model described in ➜-"Design of the Performance Analysis", the force of N (t) , the rate of seeking treatment is θ 2 ν I (t), and the rate of 714 recovery is θ 3 ν T (t), where ν S (t), ν I (t) and ν T (t) denote, respectively, the number of 715 individuals in the compartments Susceptible, Infective, and Treatment (see Fig 3) . The 716 Gillespie algorithm proceeds as follows. Assuming that the epidemic is at state v(t) at time t : 1. Calculate the sum of rates: Λ 0 = PLOS 24/38
