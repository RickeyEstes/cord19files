Recent studies have suggested that bats are the natural reservoir of a range of coronaviruses (CoVs), and that rhinolophid bats harbor viruses closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV, which caused an outbreak of respiratory illness in humans during [2002][2003]. We examined the evolutionary relationships between bat CoVs and their hosts by using sequence data of the virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene and the bat cytochrome b gene. Phylogenetic analyses showed multiple incongruent associations between the phylogenies of rhinolophid bats and their CoVs, which suggested that host shifts have occurred in the recent evolutionary history of this group. These shifts may be due to either virus biologic traits or host behavioral traits. This fi nding has implications for the emergence of SARS and for the potential future emergence of SARS-CoVs or related viruses. November 2002 in southern People's Republic of China (1), and a SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identifi ed as the etiologic agent (2). These events and the identifi ca-tion of SARS-CoV in animals associated with the wildlife trade in southern China (3) have led to a rapid resurgence of interest in CoVs of different origins. This resurgence led to discovery of 2 novel human CoVs (4,5); identifi cation of SARS-like CoVs in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus macrotis, R. ferrumequinum, R. pearsoni, and R. sinicus) (6,7); and identifi cation of other CoVs in bat species (R. sinicus, R. ferrumequinum, Miniopterus magnater [M. magnater has been misidentifi ed as M. schreibersi (8) in reports on SARS-like CoV], Pipistrellus abramus, P. pipistrellus, Tylonycteris pachypus, Myotis ricketti, and Scotophilus kuhlii) (7, (9) (10) (11) (12) . However, evolutionary relationships among these CoVs and their bat hosts have not been examined. Studies in species other than bats have examined hostvirus phylogeny and identifi ed coevolutionary relationships (13-16) or incongruous phylogenetic patterns (17). These fi ndings suggest recent pathogen host shifts (defi ned as interspecies transmission followed by establishment and long-term persistence in the new host species [18] ). Other studies have demonstrated that the relationship between viral phylogeny and geographic location and identifi cation hosts (viral phylogeography [19] ) can yield information on the origin of emerging zoonoses (19, 20) . Knowing the high genetic diversity of bat CoVs, we carried out a systematic phylogenetic study of the viruses and their hosts to examine evolutionary relationships between bat CoVs and bats. The aim was to further investigate the origin of SARS-like CoVs and SARS. Our results suggest host-pathogen divergence and host shifts in the recent evolutionary history of these viruses and their hosts. We discuss host behavioral traits and viral traits that might have given rise to these patterns and comment on the implications of our fi ndings for the emergence of SARS-CoV.
