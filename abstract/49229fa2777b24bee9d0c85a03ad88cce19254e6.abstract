• We propose the daily basic reproduction number for MERS-CoV in South Korea. • We use an SIR model with piecewise constant contact and removed rates. • We apply the explicit Euler's method for the solution of the SIR model. • We use nonlinear least-square fitting procedure for finding the best parameters. In this paper, we propose the daily computed weighted averaging basic reproduction number R n 0,k,ω for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea, May to July 2015. We use an SIR model with piecewise constant parameters β (contact rate) and γ (removed rate). We use the explicit Euler's method for the solution of the SIR model and a nonlinear least-square fitting procedure for finding the best parameters. In R n 0,k,ω , the parameters n, k, and w denote days from a reference date, the number of days in averaging, and a weighting factor, respectively. We perform a series of numerical experiments and compare the results with the real-world data. In particular, using the predicted reproduction number based on the previous two consecutive reproduction numbers, we can predict the future behavior of the reproduction number.
