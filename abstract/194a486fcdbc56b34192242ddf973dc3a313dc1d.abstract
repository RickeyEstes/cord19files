Interventions: Anesthetic management and infection control guidelines for emergency procedures in patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were drafted and applied in four hospitals in Wuhan. Cross-infection in the operating rooms of these four hospitals has been effectively reduced by taking these measures and procedures. As for patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or suspected infection, majority of them were female (23 [62%] of 37); with a mean age of 41.0 years old (SD, 19.6; range, 4 to 78). Ten (27%) patients had chronic medical illness, including 4 (11%) with diabetes, 8 (22%) with hypertension, and 8 (22%) with digestive system disease. Twenty-five (68%) patients showed lymphopenia and 23 (62%) patients exhibited multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on CT scanning. Our study indicated that 2019-nCoV specific guidelines for emergency procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV may effectively prevent cross-infection in the operating rooms. Most patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV presented with fever, dry cough, and developed bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on chest CT scans.
