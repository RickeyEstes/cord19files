Synthesis and evaluation of new scaffold phenylisoserine derivatives connected with the essential functional groups against SARS CoV 3CL protease are described. The phenylisoserine backbone was found by simulation on GOLD software and the structure activity relationship study of phenylisoserine derivatives gave SK80 with an IC 50 value of 43 lM against SARS CoV 3CL R188I mutant protease. Ã“ 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a contagious respiratory disease in humans which is caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). [1] [2] [3] The key enzyme in the processing of polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, translated by the viral RNA genome of SARS-CoV is called a 3C-like protease (3CL protease). Due to its functional importance in the viral life cycle, SARS-CoV 3CL protease is considered to be an attractive target for a drug for SARS therapy. For this reason, a variety of 3CL protease inhibitors have been reported in the literature over the past decade. 4-11 They are nonpeptidyl compounds derived from natural products and/or substrate-based peptidemimetics. However, no effective therapeutic drug or vaccine has been developed to date, although many candidates targeting SARS 3CL protease have been identified. In a research program on SARS 3CL protease, we found for the first time that mature SARS 3CL protease is subject to degradation at the 188Arg/189Gln site. R188I mutant protease with high activity and stability was prepared. 10 Although our group additionally found that tetrapeptide aldehyde Ac-Thr-Val-Cha-His-H (1) showed high inhibitory activity with an IC 50 value of 98 nM against SARS 3CL R188I mutant protease in 2008, 12 there are generally enzymatic digestions of peptide chains and a-proton racemization. Next, we designed and synthesized serine derivatives focusing on the P1, P2 and P4 sites of tetrapeptide aldehyde (1) by the combination of docking simulation and a structure activity relationship study. As for the results, SK23 (2) was given as a candidate compound against SARS 3CL R188I mutant protease. 13 In this case, the inhibitory activity of SK23 (2) was much lower than the peptide aldehyde inhibitor (1). However, SK23 (2) has no thiol capture unit and achieved a marked structural transformation from peptidyl compounds based on a substrate mimic strategy. Investigation of a scaffold with three essential functional groups is needed to develop small molecular inhibitors using a serine scaffold for non-peptidyl compounds (Fig. 1) . Scaffold hopping techniques have been widely applied by medicinal chemists to discover equipotent compounds with novel backbones that have improved properties. 14 Scaffold hopping into four major categories, namely heterocycles replacements, ring opening or closure, peptidemimetics and topology-based hopping, has been classified. In the technique for SARS 3CL protease inhibitors, we are interested in a peptidomimetics approach based on the scaffold hopping strategy. We herein report the design, synthesis and evaluation of a new scaffold, a phenylisoserine (PIS) derivative, for SARS-CoV 3CL protease inhibitors. We performed a variety of molecular mechanics calculations with SPARTAN from Wavefunction and docking simulations of protein interactions using GOLD from CCDC for the 1,2-hydroxyamine http://dx.
