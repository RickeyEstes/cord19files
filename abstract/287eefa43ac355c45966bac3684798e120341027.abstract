In seven of the 10 patients with gastrointestinal disease, stool samples tested for human rotavirus were positive by ELISA, whereas in 20 unaffected infants, no stools tested demonstrated HRV (P = 0.0001). Eleven staff members had serologic evidence of recent HRV infection. Comparison of risk factors traditionally associated with the development of NEC between the affected and unaffected infants revealed no significant differences. Rotavirus infection was the only finding that was highly correlated with this epidemic. (J PEDIATR 103:454, 1983.) From the
