printex 90-carbon black particles + B(a)p (18.8 %). High indicences of cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas were noted in rats that received 15 mg B(a)P (14.6 %) or 30 mg B(a)P (72.7 %) intratracheally. Immunohistochemical labeling of nuclei with PCNA demonstrated proliferative activity in one or two (and focally more than two) peripheral cell layers of cystic keratinizing epitheliomas and in more than three peripheral cell layers of cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas and keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas. The wall of keratinizing cysts showed no or a weak reaction. Exp Toxic Pathol49 (1997) 6 433
