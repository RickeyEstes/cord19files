We developed a 1-hour fi eld enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detecting antibody to Sin Nombre virus in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). The assay specifi city and sensitivity were comparable to those of a standard EIA. This test will permit identifi cation of rodents with antibody to this and perhaps other hantaviruses.
