Pos. ssRNA Taxonomic structure of the family Family Since only one genus is currently recognized, the family description corresponds to the genus description. Type species Gill-associated virus Virions are enveloped, bacilliform in shape with rounded ends, and 40-60 nm î€³150-200 nm in dimensions ( Figure 1 ). The envelope is studded with prominent peplomers projecting approximately 11 nm from the surface. Nucleocapsids are 20-30 nm in diameter and have a helical symmetry with coil periodicity of 5-7 nm. Long filamentous nucleocapsid precursors (approximately 15 nm in diameter and 80-450 nm in length) occur in the cytoplasm of infected cells and acquire envelopes by budding at endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Newly budded mature enveloped virions often appear as multimers butted end-to-end and paracrystalline arrays of virions can occur within vesicles.
