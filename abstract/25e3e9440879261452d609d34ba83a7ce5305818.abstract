Computer-assisted design software (CADs) have been developed to ensure efficient and consistent design of synthetic DNA sequences at the genome scale [8 ,9 ]. The design space of synthetic DNA is enormous and many (if not infinite) design blueprints are possible, as long as they can result in the viability of the cell, to achieve the design intention [10] . Initial projects aiming to synthesize a whole genome were conservative in
