The Ca 2+ mobilizing second messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) regulates intracellular trafficking events, including translocation of certain enveloped viruses through the endolysosomal system. Targeting NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ signaling may therefore be an effective strategy for discovering novel antivirals as well as therapeutics for other disorders. To aid discovery of novel scaffolds that modulate NAADPevoked Ca 2+ signaling in human cells, we have investigated the potential of using the sea urchin egg homogenate system for a screening campaign. Known pharmacological inhibitors of NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ release (but not cADPR-or IP 3 -evoked Ca 2+ release) in this invertebrate system strongly correlated with inhibition of MERSpseudovirus infectivity in a human cell line. A primary screen of 1534 compounds yielded eighteen 'hits' exhibiting > 80% inhibition of NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ release. A validation pipeline for these candidates yielded seven drugs that inhibited NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ release without depleting acidic Ca 2+ stores in a human cell line. These candidates displayed a similar penetrance of inhibition in both the sea urchin system and the human cell line, and the extent of inhibition of NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ signals correlated well with observed inhibition of infectivity of a Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pseudovirus. These experiments support the potential of this simple, homogenate system for screening campaigns to discover modulators of NAADP, cADPR and IP 3 -dependent Ca 2+ signaling with potential therapeutic value. H + -ATPase inhibitor and various lysosomal disruption agents [28, 29] ). Second, agents that interfere with NAADP binding, including trans-Ned-19 (a member of a NAADP conformer series identified by virtual screening, [30]) and the nucleotide mimetics PPADS and PPNDS [31]. Third, agents that act as TPC pore blockers, including Ca v channel antagonists (diltiazem, nifedipine, < 10 u M [13,32]) and possibly tetrandrine (sub-micromolar range [17] and structurally-related https://doi.
