We screened 23 children with severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease and 23 children with mild RSV disease for human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Although HMPV was circulating in Connecticut, none of the 46 RSVinfected patients tested positive for HMPV. In our study population, HMPV did not contribute to the severity of RSV disease.
