To determine the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of rhinothermy for the common cold. Design: Open label randomised placebo-controlled feasibility study. Setting: Single centre research institute in New Zealand recruiting participants from the community. Participants: 30 adult participants with symptoms of a common cold, presenting within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either: 35L/min of 100% humidified air at 41 O C via high flow nasal cannulae (HFNC), two hours per day for up to five days (rhinothermy); or Vitamin C 250mg daily for five days (control). The proportion of screened candidates who were randomised. In all 30/79 (38%, 95% CI 27 to 50) of potential participants screened for eligibility were randomised. Rhinothermy was well tolerated and all randomised participants completed the study (100%, 95% CI 88 to 100%). The reduction from baseline in the modified Jackson score was significantly greater with rhinothermy compared with control at days 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with the maximum difference at day 4 (-6.4, 95%CI -9.4 to -3.3). The substantial clinical benefit threshold for modified Jackson score was a 5 unit change. Conclusions: This study shows that an RCT of rhinothermy compared with vitamin C in the treatment of the common cold is feasible. A robust adequately powered RCT is needed, particularly as this feasibility study identified that rhinothermy improved symptoms of the common cold compared with control.
