Rhinovirus infection is typically associated with the common cold and has rarely been reported as a cause of severe pneumonia in immunocompetent adults. A 55-year-old previous healthy woman, who consumed half a bottle of alcohol daily, presented with respiratory failure after one week of upper respiratory infection symptoms. Radiography revealed bilateral, diffuse ground glass opacity with patchy consolidation in the whole lung field; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis indicated that rhinovirus was the causative organism. After five days of conservative support, the symptoms and radiographic findings began to improve. We report this rare case of rhinovirus pneumonia in an otherwise healthy host along with a review of references. causative and commensal pathogens in specimen obtained by nasopharyngeal aspiration. Data on viral pneumonia are increasing; however, severe rhinovirus pneumonia resulting respiratory failure in an immunocompetent host is still regarded as extremely unusual. A 55-year-old woman visited our emergency department in September with two-day history of progressive dyspnea. The patient had never smoked and had no other previous medical history, but consumed half a bottle of alcohol daily. The patient had got a common cold one week prior, but her symptoms aggravated despite empirical treatment. After 5 days, she began to experience shortness of breath. Exertional dyspnea progressed to resting dyspnea the following day and at the emergency room, her initial peripheral oxygen saturation was 70%. Wet crackles and expiratory wheezing sounds were present in the whole lung field area. Evaluation of the patient' s vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 140/80 mm Hg, body temperature of 36.6 o C, pulse rate of 108 beats per minute, and respiration rate of 30 breaths per minute. Simple chest radiography showed the predominance of bilateral consolidation with ground glass opacity (GGO) in both lower lobes ( Figure  1A ). Chest computed tomography indicated diffuse GGO
