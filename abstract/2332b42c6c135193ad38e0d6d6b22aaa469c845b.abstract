A novel titanium dioxide-coated cordierite foam (TiO 2 /cordierite foam) was developed for use in air cleaners. By a simple impregnation procedure, TiO 2 nanoparticles were immobilized firmly onto the surface of a cordierite foam substrate through high-temperature (500 • C) calcination. The strong bactericidal performance of the fabricated foam was evaluated by a newly developed test method for complex threedimensional through-pore structures. This method could trace 5-6 log units of decrease in bacterial cell numbers in an air environment, thus meeting the criteria of both the JIS and ISO standard test methods. With 0.25 mW cm −2 of UV-A irradiation for 24 h, the bactericidal rate of the TiO 2 /cordierite foam exceeded 99.9% for five types of airborne or droplet-based infectious pathogens: Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The results of repeat testing, where the same sample was used three times, revealed that the bactericidal rate for E. coli was maintained at 99.9% in the second and third use, indicating that the TiO 2 /cordierite foam possesses a long-term bactericidal action. The TiO 2 /cordierite foam also exhibited a high photocatalytic degradation capability on gaseous acetaldehyde, which is associated with sick building syndrome, and volatile organic compounds to generate CO 2 and H 2 O. The results demonstrated that TiO 2 -coated cordierite foam has great potential for use in air-cleaning filters with not only high bactericidal performance to remove pathogens in the air and in droplets, but also strong decontaminating and deodorizing functionality. (Y. Yao). medical drugs, fungicides and bactericidal materials, is becoming a central concern in many scientific fields. Recently, titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) has attracted widespread attention as an antimicrobial semiconductor photocatalyst because it is regarded as environmentally friendly, while at the same time possessing strong bactericidal properties. This activity is associated with the strong oxidizing power of TiO 2 when it is exposed to UV light with wavelengths of less than 385 nm. When exposed to near-UV light, TiO 2 can generate a hole-excited electron pair due to band gap excitation on its surface [5] . Through the combined action of superoxide radicals (O 2 •− ) produced by the reduction of oxygen with an excited electron, hydroxyl radicals (OH • ) produced by the oxidation of water and photo-generated electrons/holes, most organic compounds can be decomposed and mineralized to CO 2 and H 2 O [6-9]. As the single most important effect of TiO 2 photocatalysis, its bactericidal activity has been studied in various microorganisms including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), as well as in fungi. In addition, the mechanism of this antimicrobial photocatalysis has been 0926-3373/$ -see front matter
