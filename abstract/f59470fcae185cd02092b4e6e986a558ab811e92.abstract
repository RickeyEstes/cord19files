An efficient Z1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal requires an RNA slippery sequence and a downstream RNA stimulator, and the hairpin-type pseudoknot is the most common stimulator. However, a pseudoknot is not sufficient to promote Z1 PRF. hTPK-DU177, a pseudoknot derived from human telomerase RNA, shares structural similarities with several Z1 PRF pseudoknots and is used to dissect the roles of distinct structural features in the stimulator of Z1 PRF. Structurebased mutagenesis on hTPK-DU177 reveals that the Z1 PRF efficiency of this stimulator can be modulated by sequential removal of base-triple interactions surrounding the helical junction. Further analysis of the junction-flanking base triples indicates that specific stem-loop interactions and their relative positions to the helical junction play crucial roles for the Z1 PRF activity of this pseudoknot. Intriguingly, a bimolecular pseudoknot approach based on hTPK-DU177 reveals that continuing triplex structure spanning the helical junction, lacking one of the loop-closure features embedded in pseudoknot topology, can stimulate Z1 PRF. Therefore, the triplex structure is an essential determinant for the DU177 pseudoknot to stimulate Z1 PRF. Furthermore, it suggests that Z1 PRF, induced by an in-trans RNA via specific basetriple interactions with messenger RNAs, can be a plausible regulatory function for non-coding RNAs.
