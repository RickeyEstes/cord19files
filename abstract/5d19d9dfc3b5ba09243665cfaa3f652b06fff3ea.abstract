This paper tests the relationship among heterogeneous beliefs, short sale restrictions and timevarying conditional skewness under different market conditions. The results show that heterogeneous beliefs and short sale restrictions have negative impacts on conditional skewness during periods of market decline but have negative, positive or no impacts during periods of market growth. This evidence reconciles conflicting evidence in recent empirical studies on the relationship among heterogeneous beliefs, short sale restrictions and conditional skewness. The skewness of conditional return distributions has been widely recognized as a common phenomenon in financial markets. Some important aspects of skewness in returns have also been studied. First, a substantial body of literature documents that negative unconditional skewness is caused by asymmetric volatility (Engle & Ng, 1993; Glosten, Jagannathan, & Runkle, 1993; Nelson, 1990) . Second, many authors have noted that financial time series behave differently during market declines and periods of market growth. Officer (1973 ), Schwert (1989a ,b), and Campbell and Lettau (1999 indicated that volatility is higher when markets decline than it is when they expand, while Perez-Quiros and Timmermann (2001) identified a more pronounced negative conditional skewness during late expansions and early recessions. Third, starting from Hansen (1994) , several empirical studies have documented that conditional skewness in market returns is time varying and predictable. Harvey and Siddique (1999 ), Jondeau and Rockinger (2003 ), Brooks, Burke, Heravi, and Persand (2005 ), Leon, Rubio, and Serna (2005 , and Lanne and Saikkonen (2007) found a significant presence of time-varying conditional skewness in market returns. These studies viewed conditional skewness as analogous to heteroskedasticity and modeled conditional skewness as a function of lagged skewness. However, more recent studies show evidence of the substantial instability of skewness over time, and thus, scholars have argued against the use of lagged skewness as the sole determinant of time-varying conditional skewness (Boyer, Mitton, & Vorkink, 2010) . Motivated by the theory proposed by Hong and Stein (2003) , which predicts negative skewness to be more pronounced when investors disagree more and short selling is restricted, a number of empirical studies have addressed this question by analyzing the relationship among skewness, short sale constraints, and heterogeneous beliefs. Tests on the validity of the theory, however, have returned conflicting findings. Daouk and Charoenrook (2005) , Chang, Cheng, and Yu (2007), and Hueng and McDonald (2005) found either an insignificant or positive relationship among short sale restriction, heterogeneous beliefs, and skewness, whereas Chen, Hong, and Stein (2001) and Boyer et al. (2010) found a negative relationship among these factors. The details about these empirical https://doi. T studies will be discussed in Section 1 below. The empirical analyses of skewness mentioned above pays no attention to the behavior of skewness under different market conditions. This paper argues that the relationship among short sale restrictions, heterogeneous beliefs, and conditional skewness behaves differently during periods of market decline and periods of market growth. The time series models that ignore this difference are highly likely to be mis-specified if the sample skewness measured during market declines behaves differently from that in expansion periods. Several theoretical and empirical papers motivate our empirical investigation on the effect of heterogeneous beliefs, short sale restrictions, and market direction on conditional skewness. Section 1 reviews the theoretical and empirical works that motivate our study. Section 2 discusses the theoretical background of our empirical work. Section 3 presents the conditional skewness model, which helps us test our idea. Section 4 discusses our empirical results, and Section 5 concludes the study. A number of theories have been proposed to explain the existence of skewness. One of the most influential theories of skewness, first documented by Black (1976) , attributes the negative relationship between current stock prices and future volatility to leverage. An increase in financial leverage followed by a period of price decline increases future volatility and thus introduces negative skewness when the debt level is fixed. Although the empirical effect of leverage on volatility has been proven to be statistically significant (Christie, 1982) , the effect is not sufficiently large to account for all the asymmetries in stock prices (Figlewski & Wang, 2000; Schwert, 1989b) . The second theory is the rational bubble theory (Blanchard & Watson, 1983; Diba & Grossman, 1988). A sharp fall in price followed by a period of sustained stock price increase contributes to the overall negative unconditional skewness in the market. The rational bubble theory, however, does not help us model skewness. Just as the bubble theory itself cannot predict when the bubble will burst, the model tells us nothing about when the distribution of returns will become more negatively skewed. The third theory is the volatility feedback model (French, Schwert, & Stambaugh, 1987; Pindyck, 1983) , which assumes that both good news and bad news generate uncertainty and, hence, volatility shocks with respect to future prices. Risk-averse investors will therefore require a higher rate of return and consequently a lower current price to compensate for the higher risk level, regardless of the nature of the news. This volatility feedback effect strengthens the effect of the negative impact of bad news but moderates the effect of the positive impact of good news. As a result, on average, the magnitude of the effect of negative events is larger than that of positive events, contributing to negative skewness in equity returns. The volatility feedback assumption is consistent with the empirical findings in Nelson (1990) , Engle and Ng (1993) , Glosten et al. (1993) , and other empirical asymmetric GARCH studies. The above theories are representative-agent-based and assume rationality. The fourth theory, the heterogeneous-agent-based theory proposed by Hong and Stein (2003) , however, suggests the use of a mild assumption of investor irrationality together with some institutional frictions that offer us some insights into the abnormal behavior of skewness. They assume that some investors are overconfident and believe in their own private signals, which in turn generates differences of opinion; when differences of opinion are large and short selling is not allowed, the market prices reflect only the valuation of the optimist investors since short sale constraints prevent negative information from being revealed in the market. Aligned with earlier studies of the effects on asset pricing caused by heterogeneous beliefs and short sale constraints (Harrison & Kreps, 1978; Miller, 1977) , Hong and Stein (2003) theory suggests that short sale constraints with heterogeneous beliefs lead to overpricing. Furthermore, Hong and Stein (2003) theory extended earlier studies by suggesting that if other previously optimistic investors bail out of the market, then the originally pessimistic group may become the marginal buyers and more will be learned about their negative signals. Thus, the accumulated hidden information is revealed during the market decline, and these returns will be more negatively skewed with high trading volume, which is a proxy of the degree of heterogeneous beliefs. The positive relationship between negative asymmetries and the degree of heterogeneous beliefs is an implication of Hong and Stein (2003) paper. Chen et al. (2001) developed a series of cross-sectional analyses in an attempt to test this idea. In their analysis, they found that a higher detrended turnover, a proxy of the degree of heterogeneous beliefs, can predict more negatively skewed daily returns. Thus, they found evidence to confirm the theory proposed by Hong and Stein (2003) . Through the use of a similar methodology, Boyer et al. (2010) found similar results by showing that firms that have high turnover usually have more negatively skewed returns. Not all evidence points to the same conclusion. There is empirical evidence against Hong and Stein (2003) theory. Charoenrook and Daouk (2004) found that a higher detrended turnover predicts more negative unconditional skewness in countries where short selling is allowed than in countries where short selling is not allowed. Chang et al. (2007) found that the skewness of unconditional returns increases when stocks are not allowed to be sold short and decreases when stocks are allowed to be sold short. Blau and Pinegar (2009), who approximate short sale constraints by using relatively short interest, show that there are positive relationships among turnover, relatively short interest, and unconditional skewness. Hueng and McDonald (2005) tested the behavior of timevarying conditional skewness by assuming a skewed t distribution on conditional returns. They show that a larger variance today is positively related to contemporaneous skewness at the market level. Finally, the price convexity theory (Xu, 2007) provides the fifth potential explanation for market skewness. Unlike the abovementioned theories that explain negative asymmetries, the price convexity theory explains positive market asymmetries. The model assumes that people may react to the same signal to a different extent. Since high precision traders react more than low precision traders to the same signal, price reactions are stronger to positive than to negative signals with the presence of short sale constraints. When the distribution of the signal is symmetric and no other factors affect the skewness of market return, the overall level of market skewness is positive. The price convexity theory, however, does not rule out the possibility of overall negative skewness. The model
