Bismuth has been used in medicine for over two centuries for the treatment of various diseases, in particular for gastrointestinal disorders, owing to its antimicrobial activity. Recent structural characterization of bismuth drugs provides an insight into assembly and pharmacokinetic pathway of the drugs. Mining potential protein targets inside the pathogen via metallomic/metalloproteomic approach and further characterization on the interactions of bismuth drugs with these targets laid foundation in understanding the mechanism of action of bismuth drugs. Such studies would be beneficial in rational design of new potential drugs.

(a) Dimeric bismuth citrate building block with ball-stick model and polyhedral; (b) the polymeric framework of bismuth citrate linked by three types of bismuth citrate building blocks represented by adjacent green, blue and purple polyhedral respectively; (c) the two-dimensional polymeric structure of the polymeric framework with pyridine rings in the channels (represented as space-filling mode); (d) structural model of rantidine bismuth citrate with ranitidine inserted in the channel; (e) core structure of bismuth subsubsalicylate [Bi 9 O 7 (HSal) 13 ((CH 3 ) 2 CO) 5 ] showing the shrouding of the Bi 9 O 7 core by 13 salicylate ligands (stick structures) and (f) structure of the Bi 9 O 7 core showing the octahedral arrangement of the bismuth atoms (ark brown balls) with seven octahedral faces capped by an oxygen atom (red balls).
