Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) DNA was detected in 7 (1.3%) of 526 respiratory tract samples from patients in Australia with upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms. Partial T antigen and major capsid protein sequences of MCPyV identifi ed in respiratory secretions showed high homology (99%-100%) to those found in Merkel cell carcinoma.
