The discovery of discontiguous tRNA genes triggered studies dissecting the process of tRNA splicing. As a result, we have gained detailed mechanistic knowledge on enzymatic removal of tRNA introns catalyzed by endonuclease and ligase proteins. In addition to the elucidation of tRNA processing, these studies facilitated the discovery of additional functions of RNA ligases such as RNA repair and non-conventional mRNA splicing events. Recently, the identification of a new type of RNA ligases in bacteria, archaea, and humans closed a long-standing gap in the field of tRNA processing. This review summarizes past and recent findings in the field of tRNA splicing with a focus on RNA ligation as it preferentially occurs in archaea and humans. In addition to providing an integrated view of the types and phyletic distribution of RNA ligase proteins known to date, this survey also aims at highlighting known and potential accessory biological functions of RNA ligases. Transfer RNAs (tRNA) are transcribed as precursor transcripts and are subjected to a series of posttranscriptional processing events before they are matured to fulfill their biological functions [1, 2]. Sequence analysis of tRNA genes in yeast [3, 4] , and later in archaea [5], plants [6] , and mammals [7], revealed the existence of tRNA genes disrupted by intervening sequences. Intron harboring tRNA genes are now known to occur in the genomes of organisms from all three domains of life [8] . After the discovery of intron-containing tRNAs [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , the mechanistic features of tRNA splicing were extensively studied [2, [9] [10] [11] . This review aims at providing an overview of the mechanistic aspects and enzymes involved in tRNA splicing across the three major lines of descent considering in particular a novel type of RNA ligases recently identified in bacteria, archaea, and humans. In contrast to bacterial pre-tRNAs-which are disrupted by self-splicing group I introns [12, 13]-archaeal and eukaryal pre-tRNA transcripts undergo enzymatic splicing. The latter achieves intron removal by endoribonucleolytic cleavage and subsequent ligation rather than by two consecutive transesterification events as employed by selfsplicing introns or the spliceosome. In archaea, as many as 70% of genetically encoded pre-tRNAs can be disrupted by introns of 16-44 nucleotides in length, which are characterized by the presence of a highly conserved ''bulge-helix-bulge'' motif [14, 15] . In some archaeal species, pre-tRNAs harbor up to three introns inserted at various sites [16] (Fig. 1A, schemes a and b) . Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (
