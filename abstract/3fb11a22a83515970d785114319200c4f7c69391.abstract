Human and bovine respiratory syncytial viruses (HRSV and BRSV) are two closely related, worldwide prevalent viruses that are the leading cause of severe airway disease in children and calves, respectively. Efficacy of commercial bovine vaccines needs improvement and no human vaccine is licensed yet. We reported that nasal vaccination with the HRSV nucleoprotein produced as recombinant ringshaped nanoparticles (N SRS ) protects mice against a viral challenge with HRSV. The aim of this work was to evaluate this new vaccine that uses a conserved viral antigen, in calves, natural hosts for BRSV. Calves, free of colostral or natural anti-BRSV antibodies, were vaccinated with N SRS either intramuscularly, or both intramuscularly and intranasally using Montanide TM ISA71 and IMS4132 as adjuvants and challenged with BRSV. All vaccinated calves developed anti-N antibodies in blood and nasal secretions and N-specific cellular immunity in local lymph nodes. Clinical monitoring post-challenge demonstrated moderate respiratory pathology with local lung tissue consolidations for the non-vaccinated calves that were significantly reduced in the vaccinated calves. Vaccinated calves had lower viral loads than the nonvaccinated control calves. Thus N SRS vaccination in calves provided cross-protective immunity against BRSV infection without adverse inflammatory reaction. (S. Riffault). 1 Contributed equally to the work. more than 60% of the epizootic respiratory diseases observed in dairy herds and up to 70% in beef herds [2] . Mortality caused by BRSV infections ranges generally between 0.5% and 3% but can reach up to 20% in some outbreaks [3] . The control of BRSV infections is a high priority for animal health and farming organizations, not only for economic reasons, but also due to the impact on animal welfare. Several commercial BRSV vaccines, including modified-live virus and inactivated single fraction are available for use in cattle. Their efficacy needs improvement in terms of duration of protection, clinical and virological protection. Even though the commercial bovine vaccines probably have reduced the prevalence of infection, BRSV continues to circulate in cattle populations. No commercial vaccine is available against HRSV, a pathogen of major importance in infants. HRSV induced-bronchiolitis is the most common cause of infant hospitalization in industrialized countries and is a suspected risk factor of recurrent wheeze and asthma in later life [4] .
