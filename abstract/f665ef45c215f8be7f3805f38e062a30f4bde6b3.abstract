Infectious clone A full-length DNA copy of an RNA virus genome from which full-length viral RNA can be generated, leading to production of infectious virus. Nidovirales (nidoviruses) An order comprising positive-sense RNA coronaviruses, toroviruses, arteriviruses, and roniviruses that have a common genome organization and expression, similar replication/transcription strategies, and form a nested set of 3 0 co-terminal subgenomic mRNAs (nidus, Latin for nest). Ribosomal frameshifting Movement (shift) backward by one nucleotide of a ribosome that is on an RNA, caused by particular RNA structures and sequences. Subsequent continuation of the progress of the ribosome is in a different open reading frame.
