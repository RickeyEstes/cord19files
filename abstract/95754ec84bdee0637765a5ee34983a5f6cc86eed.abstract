B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) has a dual function, acting both as an oncogene 20 and an anti-tumor gene. It is well known that Bcl-2 exerts its tumor promoting 21 function through the mitochondrial pathway. However, the mechanism by which 22 Bcl-2 suppresses tumor formation is not well understood. We have previously shown 23 that Bcl-2 inhibits cell cycle progression from the G 0 /G 1 to the S phase after serum 24 starvation, and that quiescent Bcl-2 expressing cells maintained a significant lower 25 level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the control cells. Based on 26 the fact that ROS mediate cell cycle progression, and are controlled by peroxisome 27 proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), a key molecule induced by 28 .

Here, we showed that 30 PGC-1α was upregulated upon Bcl-2 overexpression and downregulated following 31 Bcl-2 knockdown during serum starvation. Knockdown of PGC-1α activated Bcl-2 32 expression. Taken together, our results suggest that after serum depletion, PGC-1α 33 might coordinate with Bcl-2 to reduce ROS, which in turn delay cell cycle 34 progression. 35 36
