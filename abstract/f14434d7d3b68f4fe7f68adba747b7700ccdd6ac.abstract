Background: Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified virus which mainly spreads from person-to-person. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been constantly reported in stools of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there is a paucity of data concerning fecal shedding of the virus in pediatric patients. Objective: To investigate dynamic changes of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory and fecal specimens in children with COVID-19. , three pediatric cases of were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data of these children were collected. Real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and fecal specimens. Patients were followed up to March 10, 2020, the final date of follow-up, and dynamic profiles of RT-PCR results were closely monitored. Results: All the three pediatric cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. Severity of disease was mild to moderate and fever was the most consistent and predominant symptom at onset of illness of these children (two cases had body temperature higher than 38.5°C). All children showed increased lymphocytes (>4.4×10 9 /L) with normal white blood cell counts on admission. Radiological changes were not typical for COVID-19. All children showed good response to supportive treatment. Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas viral RNA remained positive in stools of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks. Two children had fecal SARS-CoV-2 turned negative 20 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 8 days. Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 may exist in gastrointestinal tract for a longer time than respiratory system. Persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children indicates the potential for the virus to be transmitted through fecal excretion. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools. All rights reserved.
