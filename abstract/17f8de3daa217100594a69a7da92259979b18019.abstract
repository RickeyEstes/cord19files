Kidney, liver, heart, pancreas, lung, and small intestine transplantations are viable therapeutic options for patients with end-stage organ failure. Ongoing advancements of surgical techniques, immunosuppressive regimens, and perioperative management have resulted in improved survival of allograft recipients. Despite these refinements, infections still contribute to substantial morbidity and mortality, limiting long-term success rates of these procedures. Infections are particularly problematic among transplant recipients for several reasons. Immunosuppressive regimens are necessary to limit allograft rejection but weaken host immune responses to exogenously acquired pathogens and enable endogenous reactivation of latent infection. Frequent medical care of newly transplanted patients exposes them to potentially drug-resistant pathogens. Infections of the respiratory tract are common and could herald the development of more severe diseases. This is largely because of constant contact with the environment, which uniquely predisposes the respiratory system to direct microbial inoculation. Moreover, lung recipients specifically suffer from mucociliary dyskinesia, with reduced mechanical clearance of respiratory pathogens, as a result of airway anastomoses and a denervated allograft.
