In Taiwan, a temperature-monitoring campaign and hotline for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) fever were implemented in June 2003. Among 1,966 calls, fever was recorded in 19% (n = 378); 18 persons at high risk for SARS were identified. In a cross-sectional telephone survey, 95% (n = 1,060) of households knew about the campaign and 7 households reported fever. F ever is one of the first signs of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1-3). Persons with fevers initially attributed to other illnesses have caused outbreaks of SARS in hospitals and the community (1-7). This finding highlights the need for early recognition of cases. On June 1, 2003, in Taiwan, a National Temperature Monitoring Campaign and SARS fever hotline were launched. These were intended to raise public awareness about SARS (and fever as an early sign of SARS), improve early detection of possible SARS cases, and prevent SARS transmission. In the campaign, fever was defined as forehead or axillary temperature >37°C, oral temperature >37.5°C, or tympanic or rectal temperature >38°C (8). 2 In conjunction with this campaign, persons with fevers were encouraged to call a toll-free SARS fever hotline. The hotline objectives were to appropriately triage persons with fever, reduce clinic visits by the "worried well," identify persons at high risk for SARS, reduce opportunities for SARS exposure, and increase the public's sense of security. Both the body-temperature monitoring campaign and the hotline were publicized through television, posters, fliers, radio, the Internet, magazines, and newspapers. We describe and evaluate the body-temperature monitoring campaign and the SARS fever hotline.
