Inhalation of Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula causes "farmer's lung" disease, a classic example of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of mice challenged with S rectivirgula, and S rectivirgula induces MCP-1 secretion by alveolar macrophages. We tested the hypothesis that MCP-1 and its receptor CC chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) are essential to the development of experimental HP by treating mice with MCP-1 antibody and using CCR2 ؊/؊ mice. Administration of anti-MCP-1 did not change the response to intratracheally administered S rectivirgula. CCR2 ؊/؊ animals responded in a fashion similar to that of wild-type animals to intratracheally administered.S rectivirgula. To determine the influence of the MCP-1-CCR2 interaction in vitro, we transferred S rectivirgula-cultured spleen cells from S rectivirgulasensitized mice, to naïve recipients. Later, challenge of the recipients with intratracheal S rectivirgula and examination of both lung histology and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid characteristics were used to determine whether adoptive transfer had occurred. We found that cultured cells from CCR2 ؊/؊ animals were fully capable of adoptive transfer. We conclude that interaction of MCP-1 with CCR2 is not necessary for the development of pulmonary inflammation in response to intratracheally administered S rectivirgula or cells able to adoptively transfer experimental HP.
