Motivation: Detecting protein domains sharing no similarity to known domains, as stored in domain 1 databases, is a challenging problem, particularly for unannotated proteomes, domains emerged recently, 2 fast diverging proteins or domains with intrinsically disordered regions. 3 Results: We developed pyHCA and HCAtk, a python API and standalone tool gathering together 4 improved versions of previously developed methodologies, with new functionalities. The developed tools 5 can be either used from command line or from a python API. state of the art of our current knowledge of the protein domain universe [11, 18] . However, many protein 15 sequences escape, at least partially, domain annotation, particularly in non-model organisms and remain 16 in the so-called dark protein sequence universe [4] . Classical methodological approaches model protein 17 domain families as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). However, to that aim, sequences need to be clustered 18 and aligned based on the identification of sequence similarities. Therefore, proteins from organisms distant 19 from the species considered in the model, fast diverging proteins, recently emerged domains and domains 20 containing disordered regions, are less likely to be annotated using this methodology [5]. Here, in order to 21 provide a comprehensive view of protein domain architectures, we present a standalone software named 22 42 REMOte homoLOgy) [9]. Using as queries domains delineated using Seg-HCA, remote similarity search 43 is performed against protein sequences from the Uniprot database [29] using HHBlits [25]. For each hit, Therefore, the HCA score scales with the density in hydrophobic clusters and in hydrophobic residues 112 inside the clusters. As the HCA score calculation motivation is to provide an estimation of the globular 113 character, i.e. the foldability of an HCA domain, the value of each of the three classes was optimized to 114 maximize the separation between the distributions of the HCA scores computed on disordered sequences 115 5/16 .

The absence of any clear annotation in the N-terminal part of the protein, including two 158 small regions predicted as disordered, but in which a potential order is detected, suggests the presence of 159 an un-detected domain of unknown function [4]).
