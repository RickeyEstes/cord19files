Along with tRNAs, enzymes that modify anticodon bases are a key aspect of translation across the 12 tree of life. tRNA modifications extend wobble pairing, allowing specific ("target") tRNAs to 13 recognize multiple codons and cover for other ("non-target") tRNAs, often improving translation 14 efficiency and accuracy. However, the detailed evolutionary history and impact of tRNA modifying 15 enzymes has not been analyzed. Using ancestral reconstruction of five tRNA modifications across 16 1093 bacteria, we show that most modifications were ancestral to eubacteria, but were repeatedly 17 lost in many lineages. Most modification losses coincided with evolutionary shifts in non-target 18 tRNAs, often driven by increased bias in genomic GC and associated codon use, or by genome 19 reduction. In turn, the loss of tRNA modifications stabilized otherwise highly dynamic tRNA gene 20 repertoires. Our work thus traces the complex history of bacterial tRNA modifications, providing 21 the first clear evidence for their role in the evolution of bacterial translation. 22 23
