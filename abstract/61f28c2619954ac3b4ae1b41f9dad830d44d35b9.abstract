The complete nucleotide sequence of the second largest RNA segment of Dhori/lndia/l313/61 virus was determined and the deduced amino acid sequence was compared with the polymerase (P) proteins of influenza A, 6, and C viruses. RNA segment 2 (2224 nucleotides) of Dhori virus contains a single long open reading frame that can encode a 716amino acid polypeptide (81.3 kDa). The predicted polypeptide shares between 27 and 31 o/o sequence identities with the PBl polypeptides of influenza A, B, and C viruses. Among the regions most highly conserved are the sequences around the Asp-Asp motif common to many RNA polymerases. In spite of the high level of sequence identity between the Dhori RNA segment 2 gene product and the influenza A, B, and C virus PBl proteins the amino acid composition of the Dhori protein indicates an acidic charge feature at pH 7.0 in contrast to the basic nature of the PBl proteins of the influenza viruses. We suggest that the Dhori PBl -like protein be designated the Pa protein of this virus.
