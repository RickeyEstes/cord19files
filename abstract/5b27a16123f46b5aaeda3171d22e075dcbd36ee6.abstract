It has been recently estimated that one-third of the world population will be infected by Zika virus, but unfortunately so far there is no vaccine or medicine available. In particular, the special concern on the vaccine treatment to Zika and Dengue arising from antibody-dependent enhancement strongly emphasizes the irreplaceable role of its NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) as a target for anti-Zika drug discovery/design due to its absolutely-essential role in viral replication. Very recently we identified two small molecules inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro in non-competitive mode, with Ki values of 0.57 and 2.02 ÂµM respective for p-Nitrophenyl-p-guanidino benzoate and qucertin. Here, by molecular docking, we show that although one is designed compound while another is a natural product, both molecules bind to the same pocket on the back of the substratebinding pocket of Zika NS2B-NS3pro. As the two inhibitors fundamentally differ from cn-716, the only known peptidomimetic boronic acid inhibitor in both structure scaffolds and inhibitory modes, our discovery might open up a new avenue for the future development of allosteric inhibitors, which is highly demanded to achieve therapeutic inhibition of flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes. Furthermore, as qucertin is abundant in many vegetables and fruits such caper, lovage, tea and red onion, our results should benefit the public to immediately fight Zika virus. author/funder.
