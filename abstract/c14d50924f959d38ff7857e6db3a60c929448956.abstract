Viruses must hijack cellular translation machinery to efficiently express viral genes. In many 17 cases, this is impeded by cellular stress responses. These stress responses swiftly relocate 18 and repurpose translation machinery, resulting in global inhibition of translation and the 19 aggregation of stalled 48S mRNPs into cytoplasmic foci called stress granules. This results in 20 translational silencing of all mRNAs excluding those beneficial for the cell to resolve the 21 specific stress. For example, expression of antiviral factors is maintained during viral infection. Here we investigated stress granule regulation by Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis 23 virus (IBV), which causes the economically important poultry disease, infectious bronchitis. Interestingly, we found that IBV is able to inhibit multiple cellular stress granule signaling 25 pathways whilst at the same time IBV replication also results in induction of seemingly 26 canonical stress granules in a proportion of infected cells. Moreover, IBV infection uncouples 27 translational repression and stress granule formation and both processes are independent of 28 eIF2Î± phosphorylation. These results provide novel insights into how IBV modulates cellular 29 translation and antiviral stress signaling. 30 31 32 105 Cells, viruses and reagents 106 Vero cells were maintained in 1x Eagle's modified essential medium (Sigma) supplemented 107 with 1x L-glutamine (Gibco) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Recombinant IBV strain 108 BeauR has been described previously (Britton et al., 2005). Inactivated IBV was generated by 109 treatment with binary ethylenimine (BEI). Briefly, virus was incubated in 0.1 M BEI for 48 110 hours at 37 o C followed by inactivation of BEI by addition of 1 M sodium thiosulfate. Inactivation of virus was confirmed by RT-qPCR following infection of cells. Sodium arsenite, 112 cycloheximide, puromycin and emetine were purchased from Sigma.
