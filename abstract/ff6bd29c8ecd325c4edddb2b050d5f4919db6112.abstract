15 Current prophylactic and therapeutic strategies targeting human influenza viruses include 16 vaccines and antivirals. Given variable rates of vaccine efficacy and antiviral resistance, 17 alternative strategies are urgently required to improve disease outcomes. Here we describe the 18 use of HiSeq deep sequencing to analyze host gene expression in primary human alveolar 19 epithelial type II cells infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus. At 24 hours 20 post-infection, 623 host genes were significantly up-regulated, including the cell adhesion 21 molecule CEACAM1. The up-regulation of CEACAM1 was blocked in the presence of the 22 reactive oxygen species inhibitor, apocynin. H5N1 virus infection stimulated significantly higher 23 CEACAM1 protein expression when compared to low pathogenic PR8 H1N1 virus, suggesting a 24 key role for CEACAM1 in influenza virus pathogenicity. Furthermore, silencing of endogenous 25 CEACAM1 resulted in reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine production, as 26 well as reduced levels of virus replication following H5N1 infection. Our study provides 27 evidence for the involvement of CEACAM1 in a clinically relevant model of H5N1 infection and 28 may assist in the development of host-oriented antiviral strategies. 29 30 IMPORTANCE 31 Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus continues to pose a potential pandemic 32 threat. Therapeutic strategies that enhance host immune responses to promote clearance of 33 influenza virus infection are urgently needed. CEACAM1 was significantly up-regulated in 34 primary alveolar epithelial type II cells infected with H5N1 virus. It was one of 623 human genes 35 identified using HiSeq deep sequencing analysis that were up-regulated following H5N1 36 infection. Although CEACAM1 is known for its multifaceted immune regulatory role, little is 37 known about its contribution to host immunity. The results presented here show that CEACAM1 38 All rights reserved.
