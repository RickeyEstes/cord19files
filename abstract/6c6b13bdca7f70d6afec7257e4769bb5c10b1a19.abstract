The interferon (IFN)-inducible antiviral state is mediated in part by the 2=,5=-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase (OAS)/ RNase L system. 2-5A, produced from ATP by OAS proteins in response to viral double-stranded RNA, binds to and activates RNase L. RNase L restricts viral infections by degrading viral and cellular RNA, inducing autophagy and apoptosis, and producing RNA degradation products that amplify production of type I interferons (IFNs) through RIG-I-like receptors. However, the effects of the OAS/RNase L pathway on IFN induction in different cell types that vary in basal levels of these proteins have not been previously reported. Here we report higher basal expression of both RNase L and OAS in mouse macrophages in compari- son to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In MEFs, RNase L gene knockout decreased induction of IFN-␤ by encephalomyocarditis virus infection or poly(rI):poly(rC) (pIC) transfection. In contrast, in macrophages, RNase L deletion increased (rather than decreased) induction of IFN-␤ by virus or pIC. RNA damage from RNase L in virus-infected macrophages is likely responsible for reducing IFN-␤ production. Similarly, direct activation of RNase L by transfection with 2-5A induced IFN-␤ in MEFs but not in macrophages. Also, viral infection or pIC transfection caused RNase L-dependent apoptosis of macrophages but not of MEFs. Our results suggest that cell-type-specific differences in basal levels of OAS and RNase L are determinants of IFN-␤ induction that could affect tissue protection and survival during viral infections. Our studies suggest that during viral infections, the OAS/RNase L pathway can either enhance or suppress IFN production, depending on the cell type. IFN regulation by RNase L is suggested to contribute to tissue protection and survival during viral infections. Citation Banerjee S, Chakrabarti A, Jha BK, Weiss SR, Silverman RH. 2014.
