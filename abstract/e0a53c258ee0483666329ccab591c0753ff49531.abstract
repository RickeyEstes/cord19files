2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) had typical clinical manifestations (fever and cough) ,and presented with characteristic chest CT imaging features (multiple lesions in both lungs, often accompanied by GGO, vascular enlargement and cobblestone/reticular pattern), which are helpful to the radiologist in the early detection and diagnosis of this emerging global health emergency. In addition, changes in these main CT features can indicate development of the disease. Highlights: 1.Fever (85.7%) and cough (80.9%) were the two main symptoms of NCP patients.The incidence of shortness of breath was 85.7% in the severe cases, significantly higher than 21.4% in the mild cases. 2. Multiple lesions in both lungs and with incidence of GGO (100%), vascular enlargement (76.5%) and cobblestone/reticular pattern (70.6%) were the major features of NCP patients. 85.7% of cases in serve group displayed 4-5 lobes were involved simultaneously. 3.Changes in these main CT imaging features can indicate development of the disease. About 19.1% of patients (4 of 21) presented with a normal CT. All rights reserved.
