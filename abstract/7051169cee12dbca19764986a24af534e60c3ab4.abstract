Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the major immune-mediated demyelinating human disease, affecting more than 2.5 million people [1] . It is characterized by varying amounts of demyelination, remyelination, inflammation, gliosis and axonal injury [1, 2] . In the majority of patients, the disease starts with a relapsing course (relapsing/remitting MS), followed by a progressive phase (secondary progressive MS) years later. In other patients, the relapsing form is missing and the disease is progressive right from the beginning (primary progressive MS). The mechanisms responsible for lesion induction and progression are complex and heterogeneous, and likely reflect different causes and immunopathogenetic mechanisms [3, 4]. A pathohistological comparison revealed that while focal, heavily inflamed, white matter plaques dominate in acute, relapsing MS, a more diffuse inflammatory process that affects the whole central nervous system is associated with massive cortical demyelination and diffuse axonal injury in progressive MS [5]. Based on these findings, Lassmann suggested that progression to progressive MS is associated with the development of a compartmentalized immune response, including intrathecal antibody production trapped behind a closed blood-brain barrier [6, 7]. The currently available antiinflammatory, immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies which successfully reduce the severity and rate of relapses, however, frequently fail to prevent clinical and pathological deterioration of patients with progressive MS [6]. Infection of susceptible mouse strains with low neurovirulent strains of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) results Abstract like receptor-4-induced pathways were intimately associated with demyelination as measured by immunohistology. Conclusively, although transcriptional changes were dominated by the adaptive immune response, the main pathways associated with demyelination included up-regulation of toll-like receptor 4 and down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol biosynthesis is a rate limiting step of myelination and its down-regulation is suggested to be involved in chronic demyelination by an inhibition of remyelination.
