We investigate the time-optimal control problem in SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemic models, focusing on different control policies: vaccination, isolation, culling, and reduction of transmission. Applying the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) to the unconstrained control problems (i.e. without costs of control or resource limitations), we prove that, for all the policies investigated, only bang-bang controls with at most one switch are admitted. When a switch occurs, the optimal strategy is to delay the control action some amount of time and then apply the control at the maximum rate for the remainder of the outbreak. This result is in contrast with previous findings on the unconstrained problems of minimizing the total infectious burden over an outbreak, where the optimal strategy is to use the maximal control for the entire epidemic. Then, the critical consequence of our results is that, in a wide range of epidemiological circumstances, it may be impossible to minimize the total infectious burden while minimizing the epidemic duration, and vice versa. Moreover, numerical simulations highlighted additional unexpected results, showing that the optimal control can be delayed also when the control reproduction number is lower than one and that the switching time from no control to maximum control can even occur after the peak of infection has been reached. Our results are especially important for livestock diseases where the minimization of outbreaks duration is a priority due to sanitary restrictions imposed to farms during ongoing epidemics, such as animal movements and export bans. (L. Bolzoni). riod needed for outbreaks eradication in the affected areas represents a public health priority. There exist several examples of livestock epidemics causing huge sanitary and economic impacts, such as the 1996 epidemic of classical swine fever in The Netherlands [3] , the 2001 epidemic of foot-and-mouth in the UK [4] , and the 2015 epidemic of high pathogenic avian influenza in Midwestern USA [5] . From the epidemiological point of view, the main indicators generally used to describe the severity of these infection events in livestock are: ( i ) the total number of infected animals and farms during an epidemic, and ( ii ) the duration of the epidemic. The rationale behind these indicators is based on the evidence that epidemic surveillance and control costs are directly related to spatial and temporal extension of the epidemic events [6] . Furthermore, the effect of the epidemic duration on the socio-economic burdens associated to livestock diseases is larger than in human diseases. This is due to the sanitary restrictions imposed to farms in infected areas during ongoing outbreaks, such as animal movement and export bans. Moreover, the block or the restriction of farm activities can go over http://dx.
