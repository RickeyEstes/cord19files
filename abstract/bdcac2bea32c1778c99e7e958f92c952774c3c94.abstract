We retrospectively analyzed 48 CNS lymphoma patients who received HDC/ASCT using TBC conditioning. We found a 2-year PFS and OS rate of 80.5% and 80.1%, respectively. Toxicities included nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, and febrile neutropenia. Treatment-related mortality was 8.3% in the first 100 days post-transplant. This data supports the use of consolidative ASCT in PCNSL and secondary CNS lymphoma patients.
