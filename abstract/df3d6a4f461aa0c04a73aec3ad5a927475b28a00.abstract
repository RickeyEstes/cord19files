Single-stranded nucleic acid loops are important structural and functional segments. Due to the polyanionic nature of nucleic acids, metal ions in solutions are crucial to the loop folding thermodynamics. Here, we use the previously developed tightly bound ion theory [1,2] to quantify the contributions of Na þ and Mg 2þ to the loop thermodynamics, where the loop conformational ensembles are produced based on the virtual-bond model [3]. The predicted loop thermodynamics are strongly dependent on loop length, endto-end distance, and Na þ /Mg 2þ concentrations. Based on the calculations, we derive the empirical formulas for the loop thermodynamic parameters as functions of chain length, end-to-end distance, and Na þ /Mg 2þ concentrations. For the three specific loops, namely, hairpin, bulge, and internal loops, the predicted entropies agree with the experimental data at standard salt (1M Na þ ). Furthermore, we apply the calculated loop free energy to predict RNA hairpin stability in Na þ /Mg 2þ solutions. The results show good agreement with available experimental data. We find that both helix and loop can cause significant salt-dependence for the hairpin stability.
