Subsequently, we determined in a blinded setting the presence of LGV in a selected group of patients (clinical spectrum and epidemiology described elsewhere [8] ) according to C. trachomatis-positive rectal swab (Chlamydia 2SP Collection & Transport Kit [Quelab] by commercially available PCR (COBAS AMPLICOR, Hoffman-La Roche Ltd). By using the 2 reference standard techniques to type C. trachomatis serovars (PCR-based RFLP of the omp1 gene or sequencing the variable segment 2 [VS-2] of the omp1 gene) (9,10) with DNA isolated from rectal swab specimens (standard isopropanol DNA isolation method), we identified 28 of 125 men as LGV-positive. These 28 samples were also positive in both the TaqMan and Rotorgene assays. We also identified 2 additional LGV infections, which were initially typed and then retested as single-strain infections with serovars E and D by both PCRbased RFLP analysis and VS-2 sequencing. This discrepancy is most likely due to a double infection, which will, in most cases, result in the preferential amplification of 1 strain in the omp1 PCR and PCR-based sequencing methods; in the TaqMan and Rotorgene assays, only LGV strains can be amplified. Whether this outbreak is partially technically driven must be assessed in the future by retrospectively investigating the presence of these LGV infections in men who have sex with men and the presence of the L2b strain in the past, since at present only LGV infections from 2003 to 2005 have been investigated.
