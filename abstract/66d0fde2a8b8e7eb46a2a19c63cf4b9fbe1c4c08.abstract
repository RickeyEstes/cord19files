McFee, DO, MPH, FACPM, FAACT An article about emerging pathogens would be remiss in not discussing travel-related illness (TAI). As of 2010 it was estimated that nearly 940 million tourists arrived at international destinations, which is twice that of 1990. 1,2 Of note, journeys to developing regions represented 47% of travel in 2010 compared to 31% in 1990. Given that the burden of disease, especially infectious diseases, remains high in the often impoverished developing world, it is not surprising that more than half of international travelers to developing countries become ill during their trip according to a study, and approximately 8% seek medical care for TAI during or after their journey. 1-4 Not unexpectedly, there are changes in the type of TAI reflective of the changing destinations-from tourism to work and destination-based travel, and the local, endemic illnesses found therein. 5 The most common sites for contracting malarial illness, the most common TAI in a study, were sub-Saharan Africa (77%) and Oceania (6%). 1,2 Giardiasis and dengue fever were the second and third most commonly diagnosed TAI, respectively. Of note, gastrointestinal illness represented 25% of diseases, and febrile or viral syndrome caused about 10% with respiratory syndromes affecting about 5% of TAI patients. These data are not unexpected given travelers often spend upward of 7-17 h in close proximity during airline travel. Even with improved ventilation and air turnover in modern jet travel, the small distance between and prolonged exposure to people make travelers vulnerable to respiratory and other infections. Financial considerations impact airlines; it is obvious to any frequent flier there remains a lack of proper between-flight cleaning of surfaces (seatback trays, lavatories, and arm rests), which increases the likelihood of disease transmission. Frequent hand washing, avoiding touching nose, mouth, and eyelids are important basic approaches travelers can take to reduce risk, as well as proper vaccination. Adding to the challenge of characterizing and quantifying the extent of and patterns associated with TAI is the lack of data. Studies about travel-associated illness, including the medical response to TAI, are limited. Nevertheless, some disturbing results have been published. Data suggest that among patients who presented to an ED with symptoms consistent with a potential TAI, and who were eventually diagnosed as such, less than 10% were asked about travel at their first presentation to the HCF, resulting in delayed diagnosis, delayed treatment, and unnecessary patient discomfort. 6,7 We can do better. One of the few, recent, and large-scale TAI studies involved over 40,000 ill travelers. 1,2 It revealed the most common destinations were sub-Saharan Africa (26%), Southeast Asia (17%), South-central Asia (15%), and South America (10%). And noted increases in enteric fever and dengue TAI.
