Protein therapeutics represent a significant and growing component of the modern pharmacopeia, but their potential to treat human disease is limited because most proteins fail to traffic across biological membranes. Recently, we discovered that cell-permeant miniature proteins (CPMPs) containing a precisely defined, penta-arginine motif traffic readily to the cytosol and nucleus with efficiencies that rival those of hydrocarbon-stapled peptides active in animals and man. Like many cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), CPMPs enter the endocytic pathway; the difference is that CPMPs are released efficiently from endosomes while other CPPs are not. Here, we seek to understand how CPMPs traffic from endosomes into the cytosol and what factors contribute to the efficiency of endosomal release. First, using two complementary cell-based assays, we exclude endosomal rupture as the primary means of endosomal escape. Next, using a broad spectrum of techniques, including an RNA interference (RNAi) screen, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and confocal imaging, we identify VPS39-a gene encoding a subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex-as a critical determinant in the trafficking of CPMPs and hydrocarbon-stapled peptides to the cytosol. Although CPMPs neither inhibit nor activate HOPS function, HOPS activity is essential to efficiently deliver CPMPs to the cytosol. Subsequent multi-color confocal imaging studies identify CPMPs within the endosomal lumen, particularly within the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of Rab7 + and Lamp1 + endosomes that are the products of HOPS-mediated fusion. These results suggest that CPMPs require HOPS to reach ILVs-an environment that serves as a prerequisite for efficient endosomal escape. 4 conclude that HOPS allows CPMPs to traffic into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), a favorable environment for endosomal escape. The identification of ILVs as a portal for passing proteins into the cytosol will aid the development of next-generation biologics that overcome the limitations imposed by cellular membranes. RESULTS The simplest way for a CPMP to escape from an endosome is if the endosome ruptures, in part or in full (25). Although there has been limited work on the effects of certain CPPs on the integrity of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) in vitro (26), the concentration-dependent effects of CPMPs or more traditional cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) on endosomal integrity in cultured cells have not been thoroughly evaluated. Thus, we began our analysis with two complementary assays that together detect both subtle and severe endosomal damage in cells treated with a CPMP or CPP. One assay exploits a set of eGFP-labeled galectins to fluorescently tag damaged endosomes to enable their visualization using confocal microscopy, while the other employs a fluorescently tagged version of the nonalysine (Lys9) peptide to quantify the extent of endosome rupture in cells treated with a CPMP or CPP. In both cases, the effects of the two most efficient CPMPs-aPP5.3 (1) and ZF5.3 (2)-were compared with those of prototypic members of three CPP families: the hydrocarbon-stapled peptide SAH-p53-8 (3) (22); Doctaarginine (D-Arg8, 4) (27), and a cyclic peptide containing both natural and unnatural amino acids, CPP12 (5) (26) (Figure 1 and Figure S1 ). SAH-p53-8 (3) is a hydrocarbon-stapled peptide that reaches the cell interior despite the absence of excess positive charge, D-octaarginine is the proteolytically stable enantiomer of the widely studied octapeptide L-Arg8 (27, 28), and CPP12 (5) is a cyclic peptide that reportedly reaches the cytosol with an efficiency that rivals aPP5.3 (26). A characteristic feature of endosomes that have been damaged by invading viruses (29, 30), bacteria-triggered autophagy (31-34), or endosomolytic nanoparticles (35) is the cytosolic display of β-galactosides linked to proteoglycans that are ordinarily found on the luminal side of endolysosomal compartments (36). Once displayed to the cytosol, β-galactosides recruit cytosolic galectin (Gal) proteins (37, 38), such as Gal1, 3, 4, 8, and 9, that share a conserved βgalactoside binding site ( Figure S2A ) (39, 40). In particular, Gal3 and Gal8 are recruited to damaged Rab7 + and Lamp1 + endosomes that form along the degradative branch of the endocytic pathway (33, 40). Previous work has shown that endosomal damage can be detected by monitoring the translocation of eGFP fusions of Gal3 or Gal8 from the cytosol to endosome surfaces (29-34). Fusions of Gal3 or Gal8 and eGFP have also been used to visualize late endosome damage upon siRNA release from endosomes (40), screen for small molecules that induce lysosomal rupture (41), visualize endosomal leakage induced by osmocytosis and .
