Camelids are adapted to the high plains of South America, with cool, dry winters and mild, dry summers. This makes parts of North America challenging for their survival. Depending on area, considerations for shelter should include provision of air flow in the summer with wind breaks in the winter, shade, and dry ground. 1 The hierarchy within camelid herds makes it imperative that shelters be sufficiently large, with large enough openings that all animals, especially the young, old, or thin, are able to enter without harassment. It is easy to design and provide adequate pasture and shelter for the healthy population of animals on the farm. On the other hand, hospital, maternity, and quarantine facilities should be well designed and constructed to be separate from each other and from the main herd groups. Shelter that provides shade, ventilation, and wind protection is a must for camelids. Heat stress is a major health concern in the southern United States, and handling and housing of animals in consideration of the Heat Stress Index (HSI) is important. The formula and interpretation guidelines for the HSI are: HSI 5 humidity (%) 1 temperature ( F) HSI 5 less than 120, handling is considered safe HSI 5 120-150, unnecessary handling should be avoided HSI 5 greater than 160, handling is considered dangerous and animals should be closely monitored In areas where high HSI occurs throughout the year, air-flow and shade provision are of utmost importance. In cold winters, straw bedding and wind-breaks should be provided. In summer, however, straw bedding closes the thermal window, which in camelids is the ventral thorax and abdomen, and does not allow for heat dissipation.
