Bronchiolitis is the number one cause of hospitalization in infants during the first year of life. Clinical guidelines recom mend primarily supportive care and discourage use of pharmacotherapies and diagnostics. However, there con tinues to be widespread use of nonrecommended therapies and variation in the use of therapeutic interventions among hospitals in the United States. Here we review evidence-based man agement of this common disease in order to optimize resource utilization, decrease healthcare costs, and de crease unnecessary hospitalization. Current evidence does not support the routine use of chest radiographs, viral testing or laboratory evaluation in chil dren with bronchiolitis. In addition, rou tine administration of bronchodilators, including albuterol and nebulized epi nephrine, corticosteroids and hypertonic saline are not recommended for infants and children with bronchiolitis. Intrave nous or nasogastric hydration and nutri tional support, supplemental oxygen, and respiratory support are recom mended. Standardization of bronchiolitis care with evidence based institutional clinical pathways spanning ED to inpa tient care can help optimize resource utilization while simultaneously improv ing care of bronchiolitis and reducing hospital length of stays and costs.
