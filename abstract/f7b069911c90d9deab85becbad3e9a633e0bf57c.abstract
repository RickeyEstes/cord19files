We estimate the number of COVID-19 cases from newly reported deaths in a population without previous reports. Our results suggest that by the time a single death occurs, hundreds to thousands of cases are likely to be present in that population. This suggests containment via contact tracing will be challenging at this point, and other response strategies should be considered. Our approach is implemented in a publicly available, userfriendly, online tool. .

We applied our approach to three countries which recently reported their first COVID-19 deaths (Spain, Italy, and France), using the same range of parameters as in the single-death analysis. In order to compare predictions to cases actually reported in these countries, projections were run until 4th March. Overall, predictions from the model using the baseline scenario (R = 2, CRF = 2%) were in line with reported epidemic sizes (Table 2). Results from other scenarios are presented in the Supplementary Material. Actual numbers of reported cases fell within the 50% quantile intervals of simulations in all three countries Italy (median: 1 294 ; QI50%: [390 ; 3 034]; reported: 2 037), France (median: 592 ; QI50%: [177 ; 1 705]; reported: 190) and Spain, (median: 202 ; QI50%: [95 ; 823]; reported 202). .
