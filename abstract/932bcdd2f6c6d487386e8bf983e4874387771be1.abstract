Virus-specific CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity will be reviewed from the aspect of CD8+ T cell effector function in different anatomical sites, and in the context of the nature and limitations of immune memory and the recall response. Particular attention will be given to recent experiments that use reverse genetics technology to explore the interaction between responses to bmajorQ and bminorQ epitopes. The relative importance of quantity versus quality of response will be considered, together with the characteristics of immunodominance hierarchies. Factors determining the nature of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires will be explored using approaches that combine single cell PCR with mutational and structural biology analysis. We are beginning to understand the chemistry of the TCR/epitope interaction in ways that will hopefully inform both our fundamental insights and practical considerations like vaccine design. The molecular diversity of CD8+ T cell response profiles will also be discussed. Primed individuals not only can mount secondary immune responses that are more rapid and effective than primary responses, but also maintain, in the absence of further boosting, a certain level of effector T cells and antibodies for a lifetime. These aspects of immunological memory have a distinct cellular basis. Recall responses are mediated in secondary lymphoid organs by central memory T cells and memory B cells, while immediate protection is mediated in peripheral tissues by effector memory T cells and by antibodies produced by long-lived plasma cells. I will review the experimental evidence supporting a bstem cell modelQ of immunological memory. Central memory T cells and memory B cells are intermediates of a progressive differentiation process, which have acquired the capacity to proliferate and differentiate in response to polyclonal stimuli such as cytokines, microbial products or bystander T cell help. While self renewing, central memory T cells and memory B cells continuously spill out effector T cells and plasma cells, thus replenishing those that turn over. I will describe in detail the mechanisms that sustain serum antibody levels following vaccination and discuss the implications of these findings for vaccine design. The finding that the central nervous system (CNS) embodies neurogenetic regions enriched of neural stem cells (NSCs) has spurred a flurry of studies on both their basic biology and their perspective application for the therapy of many neurological disorders. NSCs are multipotential precursors that grow and selfrenew for extensive time in culture. It has recently been argued that NSCs undergo rapid, spontaneous transformation, which would represent an obstacle to their use both in therapeutic applications for neurological disorders as well as in basic research. In my talk, I shall present an overview of the state of the art in this field and discuss recent findings that demonstrate the extreme functional stability of NSCs, particularly of human origin, their actual capacity to act as therapeutic entities in the damaged CNS and their involvement in the formation and propagation of the most malignant adult human brain tumor, i.e., the glioblastoma multiforme. CNS-reactive T cell clones are present in the healthy immune repertoire. They attack their target tissue only upon full activation. Invasion of the CNS by inflammatory cells occurs in two waves. Shortly after transfer, some few activated T cells pass through the intact BBB. They reside in the CNS for 72-96 h without causing disease. Then, a second, much larger wave of cells invades the CNS and apparently precipitates neurological defects and loss of weight. We have traced the migratory pathways of encephalitogenic T cells before, during and after clinical EAE in the Lewis rat. We study retrovirally transduced GFP expressing (bgreenQ) myelin specific T cells combining serial 2-photon imaging with real-time assays of gene transcription and protein expression. We find that activated encephalitogenic T cells radically re-program their gene expression pattern during a first 72 h prodromal period while sitting in peripheral immune organs, by down-regulating activation markers and upregulating chemokine receptors. After 72-96 h, large numbers of these T cells invade the CNS via the BBB. Two-photon imaging reveals that many of the cells rapidly cruises through the brain parenchyma, while the others seem to be arrested. We shall present evidence that the arrested cells recognize locally presented autoantigen. Intra-parenchymal T cell activation seems to underlie the pathogenic inflammatory response responsible for clinical EAE. Shortly after re-activation, most, if not all of the green T cells undergo apoptotic cell death. Their depletion from the CNS coincides with termination of the clinical EAE episode.
