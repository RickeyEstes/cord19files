R E V I E W / The weak cat Although neurological paresis is recognized somewhat infrequently in cats, it is important for the practitioner to become proficient at localizing neurological lesions to the central and/or peripheral nervous systems. LMN paresis UMN paresis Mentation Unaffected Unaffected Gait and posture Short and choppy gait, crouched posture Long-strided, spastic gait accompanied by general proprioceptive ataxia Spinal nerve reflexes Decreased Normal to exaggerated Muscle tone Decreased Increased Postural reactions Normal to delayed Delayed LMN = lower motor neuron, UMN = upper motor neuron Neurological examination findings that distinguish between LMN and UMN paresis TABLE 2 Key differences between LMN and UMN paresis ✜ A short and choppy gait is seen with LMN paresis, versus a long-strided, spastic gait and general proprioceptive ataxia with UMN paresis ✜ Spinal nerve reflexes and muscle tone typically are decreased with LMN paresis, and normal to exaggerated with UMN paresis ✜ Postural reactions typically are delayed with UMN paresis and may be normal to delayed with LMN paresis FIG 1 Pelvic limb UMN paresis. Note the increased muscle tone, knuckling and crossing over of the pelvic limbs
