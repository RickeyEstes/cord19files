In many viruses, À1 ribosomal frameshifting (À1RF) regulates synthesis of proteins and is crucial for virus production. An RNA pseudoknot is one of the essential components of the viral À1RF system. Thermodynamic or kinetic control of pseudoknot folding may be important in regulating the efficiency of À1RF. Thus, small molecules that interact with viral RNA pseudoknots may disrupt the À1RF system and show antiviral activity. In this study, we conducted virtual screening of a chemical database targeting the X-ray crystal structure of RNA pseudoknot complexed with biotin to identify ligands that may regulate an À1RF system containing biotin-aptamer as an RNA pseudoknot component. After docking screening of about 80,000 compounds, 58 highranked hits were selected and their activities were examined by in vitro and cell-based À1 frameshifting assays. Six compounds increased the efficiency of À1 frameshifting, and these are novel small molecule compounds that regulate the À1RF.
