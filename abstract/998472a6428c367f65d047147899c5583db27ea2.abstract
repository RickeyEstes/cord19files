Meta-analysis of genome-wide association data identifies a risk locus for major mood disorders on 3p21.1. Nat Genetics 2010; 4: 128-31 (a) Gene ID Gene Name Immune Function of Gene PBRM1 polybromo 1 aka BRG1-associated factor 180 (BAF180) PBRM1 codes for a protein component (BRG1-associated factor 180 [BAF 180]) of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which is crucial for activation and proliferation of T cells in response to antigen stimulation, 1 and which regulates induction and temporal sequencing of proinflammatory cytokines in response to an immune challenge, 2 as well as antigen receptor assembly (i.e. VDJ recombination) in B cell precursors; 3 following bacterial TLR stimulation, the BRG1/BRM subunits of the SWI/SNF complex are consistently required for the activation of secondary response genes and primary response genes induced with delayed kinetics within macrophages; 4 BRG1 and other BAF elements within the SWI/SNF complex has been identified as activators of transcription within the nuclear interactome for the HIV-1 virulence factor "Trans-Activator of Transcription" (Tat), 5-7 and the SWI/SNF complex more generally regulates retroviral gene integration into, and expression in, infected host cells, [8][9][10][11] and contributes to viral replication; 12 PBRM1 (BAF 180) is required for expression of the IFITM1 gene in response to interferon signaling, 13 and IFITM1 has been shown to restrict entry of a range of viruses, including HIV and SARS, into host cells, 14,15 consistent with fact that BAF complex within SWI/SNF is essential for IFN-target-gene dependent cellular antiviral activities; 16 BRG1 is essential for IFN-gamma induction of CIITA, the master regulator of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression, 17 and a switch from hBrm to BRG1 regulation of expression is an indicator of genes that are responsive to IFN-gamma signaling; 18 BRG1 contributes to MHC I immunity by upregulating enhancer A; 19 knock-down of BRG-1 activity blocks human papillomavirus E-2 driven transcriptional activation and DNA replication; 20 mice that constitutively express the SWI/SNF complex are highly susceptible to experimentally induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis; 1 GNL3 guanine nucleotide binding protein-like 3 GNL3 codes for a GTPase nucleostemin that is involved in stem cell proliferation and that upregulates the transcription factor CDX2, 21 which is a homeodomain transcription factor specific to the intestinal epithelium crucial for pathogenic E. coli to induce the di/tripeptide transporter PepT1 in gut and also to activate NFkB and MAPK leading to production of IL-8. 22 The chemokine CCL25 which plays an important role in recruiting lymphocytes to the intestinal epithelium is enhanced by CDX2, which regulates CDDL25 transcription. 23 CCL25, in turn, is believed to play a role in the development of T cells, 24 and is chemotactic for thymocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. 25,26 1.
