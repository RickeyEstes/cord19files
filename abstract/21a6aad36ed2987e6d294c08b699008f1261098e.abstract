S ystemic glucocorticosteroids (steroids) are commonly prescribed in dyspneic patients with wheezing. Studies support the use of steroids for the treatment of exacerbations of COPD and acute asthma, as both conditions are increasingly recognized as infl ammatory syndromes. 1,2 Short courses of systemic steroids have been shown to improve spirometric and clinical outcomes in patients with COPD exacerbations, although patients with documented viral infections have not been studied. 3,4 Precipitants of exacerbations of COPD and asthma include infection, environmental irritants, and allergens. Although corticosteroids reduce infl ammation, long-term use has clear detrimental Rationale: Systemic glucocorticosteroids (steroids) are commonly prescribed for patients with exacerbations of COPD during acute viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The effects of short-term high-dose steroid treatment on viral load and adaptive immunity to RSV have not been examined in adults. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to measure peak viral load and duration of viral shedding, serum and nasal cytokines, RSV-specifi c antibody response, and lymphocyte subsets in patients admitted to the hospital with RSV infection and to compare patients treated with steroids to patients untreated with steroids. Main Results: Thirty-three of 50 (66%) patients hospitalized with RSV received systemic steroids for a mean duration of 11 days. Those who received steroids more frequently wheezed and were less often febrile. There were no serious adverse events related to steroids and no signifi cant differences in peak viral load, duration of RSV shedding, nasal cytokines, or lymphocyte subsets in patients treated with steroids and patients untreated with steroids. Antibody responses to RSV were slightly blunted in the steroid-treated group. Conclusions: Short courses of systemic steroids in patients hospitalized with RSV infection did not affect viral load or shedding. Humoral immunity may be mildly diminished, and thus potential benefi ts of systemic steroids must be balanced against potential risks.
