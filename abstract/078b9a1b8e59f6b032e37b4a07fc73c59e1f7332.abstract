COVID-19 has caused a major epidemic worldwide, however, much is yet to be known 39 about the epidemiology and evolution of the virus. One reason is that the challenges 40 underneath sequencing HCoV-19 directly from clinical samples have not been com-41 pletely tackled. Here we illustrate the application of amplicon and hybrid capture (cap-42 ture)-based sequencing, as well as ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic (meta) 43 sequencing in retrieving complete genomes, inter-individual and intra-individual var-44 iations of HCoV-19 from clinical samples covering a range of sample types and viral 45 load. We also examine and compare the bias, sensitivity, accuracy, and other char-46 acteristics of these approaches in a comprehensive manner. This is, to date, the first 47
