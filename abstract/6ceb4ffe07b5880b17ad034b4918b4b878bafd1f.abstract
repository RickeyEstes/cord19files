A chemo-enzymatic synthesis of [(5-acetamido-9-O-acetyl-3,5-dideoxy-D D-glycero-a-D D-galacto-2-nonulopyranosylonic acid)-(2?3)-O-(b-D D-galactopyranosyl)-(1?3)-O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-a-D D-galactopyranosyl)]-L L-serine acetate (1) has been accomplished by a regioselective chemical acetylation of Neu5Ac (2) to give 9-O-acetylated sialic acid 3, which was enzymatically converted into CMP-Neu5,9Ac 2 (4) employing a recombinant CMP-sialic acid synthetase from Neisseria meningitis [EC 2.7.7.43]. The resulting compound was then employed for the enzymatic glycosylation of the C-3 0 hydroxyl of chemically prepared glycosylated amino acid 10 using recombinant rat a-(2?3)-O-sialyltransferase expressed in Spodooptera frugiperda [EC 2.4.99.4] to give, after deprotection of the N a -benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz)-protecting group of serine, target compound 1. The N a -CBz-protected intermediate 11 can be employed for the synthesis of glycolipopeptides for immunization purposes.
