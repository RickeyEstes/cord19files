Background: Influenza acts synergistically with bacterial co-pathogens. Few studies have described coinfection in a large cohort with severe influenza infection. Objectives: To describe the spectrum and clinical impact of co-infections. Study design: Retrospective cohort study of patients with severe influenza infection from September 2013 through April 2014 in intensive care units at 33 U.S. hospitals comparing characteristics of cases with and without co-infection in bivariable and multivariable analysis.
