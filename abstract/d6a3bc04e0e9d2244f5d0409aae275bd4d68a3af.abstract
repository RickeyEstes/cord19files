Younger patients are affected more often by osteonecrosis than by osteoarthritis, and osteonecrosis has significantly greater long-term morbidity. Corticosteroids are the most common cause of nontraumatic osteonecrosis. The femoral head is the most common site of osteonecrosis. In rare instances, osteonecrosis of the jaw has been associated with bisphosphonate exposure. This phenomenon is more common with repeated intravenous infusions of bisphosphonates.
