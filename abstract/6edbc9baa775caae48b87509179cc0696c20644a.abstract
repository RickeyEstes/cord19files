Enterotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains have been difficult to grow in cell culture. In an attempt to develop an efficient in vitro cultivation system for enterotropic MHV strains (MHV-RI and MHV-Y), 8 murine cell lines were inoculated with MHV-RI-or MI-IV-Y-infected infant mouse intestinal homogenates and screened for the production of cytopathic effects. MHV-RI and MHV-Y consistently produced cytopathic effects only in J774A.l cells. Both strains produced titers of > lo6 TCID,,/ml in subsequent passages in 5774.1 cells. MHV strains -1, -3, -A59, -JHM, -S and -DVIM also produced high-titer viral stocks in J774A.l cells. Therefore J774A.l cells are the first cells found that support the replication of these 8 enterotropic and respiratory MHV strains. After passage in J774A.l cells, MI-IV-RI and MHV-Y could infect previously non-susceptible cell lines (17Cl-1, CMT-93, N18 and NCTC 14691, though cytopathic effects were often negligible with MHV-RI. MHV-Y, but not MHV-RI, grew in L2(Percy) cells. Using L2(Percy) cells, an agarose overlay and Giemsa staining, MHV-Y could be quantified by plaque assay. Infant mouse bioassays, plaque assays and cell culture infections were compared for their sensitivity in detecting MI-IV-Y in infected intestinal homogenates and cell supematants. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a singular name for several murine coronaviruses, causes a wide spectrum of clinical syndromes ranging from subclinical infection to enteritis, hepatitis, encephalitis and death. MHV strains can be segregated into two biotypes, based on their initial site of replication: respiratory (polytropic) and en-* Corresponding author.
