The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is an endangered species and indigenous to China. In mammals, multiple subtypes of interferon-␣ (IFN-␣) exist, most of which possess antiviral activity. Little is known about giant panda IFN-␣ genes and the role they may play in giant panda immunological responses to viruses. We have cloned genes encoding 12 giant panda IFN-␣ (AmIFN-␣ or AmIFNA) subtypes that share from 90 to 99% amino acid sequence identity. AmIFN-␣12 has one additional amino acid at position 57, which is not present in other subtypes. Sequence identity of the AmIFN-␣ proteins encoded by the 12 genes compared to human IFN-␣2 is approximately 58%. Unlike most of the human subtypes, each of the 12 giant panda IFN sequences has an N-glycosylation recognition site. Expression of all 12 AmIFN-␣ subtypes in 293 cells was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. The antiviral activity and antiproliferative activity of each AmIFN-␣ subtype produced in transiently transfected 293 cell cultures were tested in vitro. All AmIFN-␣ subtypes were found to be stable at pH 2 or 65 • C and to exhibit antiviral activity. Some IFN subtypes (AmIFN-␣8 and AmIFN-␣4) showed higher biological activity levels than others, whereas AmIFN-␣11 exhibited lower activity. AmIFN-␣ had various antiproliferative activities to different target cells. To B16 cells, AmIFN-␣3, AmIFN-␣4, AmIFN-␣8 had the highest activities, while to K562 cells, AmIFN-␣3, AmIFN-␣7, AmIFN-␣10 had the highest activities. The various IFN-␣ subtypes displayed a good correlation between their antiviral and antiproliferative potencies.
