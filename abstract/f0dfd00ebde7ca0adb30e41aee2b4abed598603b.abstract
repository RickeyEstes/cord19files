Although canine herpesvirus (CHV) (also referred to as canine herpesvirus 1, canid herpesvirus 1, neonatal herpes, genital herpes, ocular herpes, and CHV-1) infections and related diseases have been recognized since the early 1960s, 1-5 there has been a resurgence of interest in the various clinical manifestations of the virus, which makes this review very timely. 6 -11 The various forms of CHV-associated infections are listed in Table 1 . In some cases these infections were directly related to clinical symptoms, such as acute neonatal viremia resulting in puppy mortality; systemic viremia in naive pregnant females resulting in fetal death, abortion, and mummification; and ocular-respiratory disease in dogs of various age ranges. 12 What has changed within the past decade has been the ability to detect the virus in its subclinical state, which allows for a much clearer understanding of the importance of 2 subpopulations of dogs: carrier-shedder adult dogs, and CHVlatently infected dogs in the animal populations with which we work. 13-17 The increased sensitivity of both antibody-based serology assays and nucleic acidbased polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have increased our level of clinical inquiry regarding CHV, as well as the other canine infectious microorganisms. 18 -22 In addition to recognizing CHV adult carriers in the general population, this new momentum has allowed for clinicians to screen dogs that are undergoing The authors have nothing to disclose.
