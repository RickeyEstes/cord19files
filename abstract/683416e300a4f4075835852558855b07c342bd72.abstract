Zika virus (ZIKV) is a global public health issue due to its association with severe 33 developmental disorders in infants and neurological disorders in adults. Because ZIKV uses 34 glycosylation of its envelope (E) protein to interact with host cell receptors to facilitate entry, 35 these interactions could also be important for designing therapeutics and vaccines. Due to a lack 36 of information about Asn-linked (N-glycans) on ZIKV E, we analyzed ZIKV E of various strains 37 derived from different cells. ZIKV E proteins are extensively modified with oligomannose-, 38 hybrid-and complex-N-glycans of a highly heterogeneous nature. Host cell-surface glycans 39 correlated strongly with the glycomic features of ZIKV E. Mechanistically, we discovered that 40 ZIKV N-glycans are important in viral pathogenesis, as mannose-specific C-type lectins DC-41 SIGN and L-SIGN mediate cell entry of ZIKV. Our findings represent the first detailed mapping 42 of N-glycans on ZIKV E of various strains and their functional significance. 43 44 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Recently, 47 the considerable increase in ZIKV infection rates has raised urgent global urgent concerns, 48 especially after the outbreaks in Yap Islands (2007) 3,4 , French Polynesia (2013) 5,6 , Easter Island 49 (2014) 7 , and Brazil (2015) 8,9 . These ZIKV outbreaks were associated with a sharp increase in 50 cases of Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disease featured by weakening and 51 paralysis of the limbs and face. In 2015, Zika spread to South and Central America, infecting 52 thousands of people in Brazil and Colombia, where it was associated with an increase in GBS 53 rates as well as a significant increase in severe fetal abnormalities including spontaneous 54 abortion, stillbirth, hydrocephaly, microcephaly, hydranencephaly/hydrops fetalis, and placental 55 insufficiency 10-14 . ZIKV is a small, enveloped positive-strand RNA virus 15 . The genomic RNA 56 of this mosquito-borne flavivirus contains a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a 57 polyprotein 16,17 . This polyprotein undergoes co-and post-translational processing to produce 58 three structural proteins, which are capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E), in 59 addition to seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) 17,18 . 60 Of the three structural proteins, E is the major surface glycoprotein, containing three domains (I, 61 II, III) and two transmembrane helices 17-19 . The majority of flaviviruses E proteins are post-62 translationally modified by N-glycans at amino acid 153/154 within a highly conserved 63 glycosylation motif of N-X-T/S at positions 154-156 (where X is any amino acid except proline) 64 16 . This is a primary target of neutralizing antibodies and is required for virus entry 20 . 65 Previously, it was demonstrated that the N-glycosylation sites on the E protein of flaviviruses are 66 highly conserved (Supplementary Fig. 1) , playing a vital role in both infectivity and assembly 67 All rights reserved.

When produced in 103 C6/36, Vero, THP-1, and SNB19 cells, these N-glycan profiles were heavily dominated by 104 sialylated glycans. For these four cell lines, bi-and tri-sialylated tri-antennary N-glycans (3241.8 105 m/z and 3603.0 m/z) were the most abundant found on ZIKV E, followed by bi-sialylated bi-106 antennary (2792.5 m/z) and tetra-sialylated tri-antennary (3964.2 m/z) N-glycans 107 (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b) . ZIKV E produced in SNB19 cells was also found to be decorated 108 with Man5 (1579.9 m/z), agalactosylated bisected (1907.1 m/z), core-fucosylated non-sialylated 109 bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z), and core-fucosylated mono-sialylated bi-antennary (2605.5 m/z) N-110 glycans (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). When expressed in the LLC-MK2 and JEG-9 cell lines, the 111 N-glycan profiles of MR766 and IbH strains of E were markedly different. When produced in 112 LLC-MK2 cells, bi-sialylated bi-antennary (2792.5 m/z) and core-fucosylated agalactosylated 113 (1836.0 m/z) N-glycans were by far the two most abundant glycan species (Supplementary Fig. 114 4a, b). More complex N-glycans, with three or more sialic acids and additional lactosamine 115 repeats, were not identified in ZIKV E expressed in LLC-MK2 cells. Finally, the ZIKV E 116 produced in JEG-3 cells revealed a different N-glycosylation pattern between MR766 and IbH 117 strains. While the di-and tri-sialylated N-glycans (2792.5, 3241.8, and 3603.0 m/z) were the 118 most abundant for the MR766 ZIKV-E produced in JEG-3, the variety of N-glycans identified in 119 JEG-3 cells was greater, notably including Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (1579.9 m/z), Man 6 GlcNAc 2 (1784.0 120 m/z), Man 7 GlcNAc 2 (1988.1 m/z), Man 8 GlcNAc 2 (2192.2 m/z), asialo bi-antennary (2070.2 121 m/z), and core fucosylated asialo-bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z) N-glycans (Supplementary Fig.   122 4a). In contrast, the IbH strain produced in the JEG-3 cells displayed a more restricted N-glycan 123 profile, with the notable absence of sialylated N-glycans and with the core fucosylated asialo-bi-124 All rights reserved.
