Al ibrary of mannose-and fucose-based glycomimetics was synthesizeda nd screened in am icroarray format againstaset of C-typel ectin receptors (CLRs) that included DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR, langerin, andd ectin-2. Glycomimetic li-gandsa ble to interact with dectin-2w ere identified for the first time. Comparative analysiso fb inding profiles allowed their selectivity against other CLRs to be probed.
