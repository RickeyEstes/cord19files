Herein we describe the Archaea diversity in a shallow pond in the Cuatro Ci√©negas Basin (CCB), 24 Northeast Mexico, with fluctuating hypersaline conditions containing elastic microbial mats that 25 can form small domes where their anoxic inside reminds us of the characteristics of the Archaean 26 Eon, rich in methane and sulfur gases; thus, we named this site the Archaean Domes (AD). These 27 domes only form after heavy rains that are rare in the Chihuahuan desert. CCB is a unique oasis 28 with hundreds of ponds, containing endemic species of animals, plants and highly diverse and 29 unique microbial communities, despite its very biased stoichiometry, due mostly to extreme low 30 phosphorus content (soils, water columns and sediments). This extreme oligotrophy has favored 31 survival of ancestral microorganisms. Whole metagenome sequencing approach was performed for 32 this unusual site in three different seasons to assess the extent of the Archaea biodiversity, with a 33 focus on extremophiles, since members of the Archaea had been underrepresented in different study 34 sites within the oasis. We found a highly diverse Archaea community compassing ~5% of the 35 metagenomes. The archaeal portion in all three metagenomes maintained its abundance and most of 36 the strains showed to form a resilient core during three seasonal samplings (2016-2017), despite 37 environmental fluctuations. However, relative abundances of all 230 archaeal OTUs (defined using 38 a 97% cutoff) were low enough (<0.1%) to be considered part of the rare biosphere. AD finding and 39 their description within CCB confirms that this particular pond is the most diverse for Archaea that 40 we are aware of and opens new paths for understanding the forces that once drove and keep shaping 41 microbial community assemblage. 42 43 44 45 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/766709 doi: bioRxiv preprint this nutrient deficiency CCB is considered a biodiversity hotspot for macroorganisms [22] and one 69 of the most diverse sites for microorganisms in the world [23][24][25][26][27]; this microbial biodiversity is 70 mirrored by its extreme diversity in virus [28]. CCB biodiversity is believed to have evolved as a 71 result of a long time environmental stability of a deep aquifer [29], as suggested by the marine 72 affiliations in many of the studied bacterial genomes [25, 30], virus [31], and probably, Archaea. 73 These observations led CCB scientists to raise hypothesis and propose CCB as a model of "lost 74 world", where extreme conditions favored the survival of ancestral marine lineages that in some 75 cases persist exclusively in this area [32]. Nevertheless, Archaea in CCB has been poorly studied 76 since they were underrepresented in previous metagenomic studies [24, 28, 33, 34]. 77 During a late March 2016 field work, an atypical spring rain apparently dissolved the salty 78 crust of an unnoticed shallow pond, allowing the uniquely flexible and impermeable microbial mats 79 to arise from the ground building bubbles, or domes with a strong sulfur-like smell. Our hypothesis 80 was that gas production of methanogenic as well as other microorganisms associated to the sulfur 81 cycle were degassing creating a locally anaerobic atmosphere. Therefore, the anaerobic layer of the 82 microbial mats were creating the domes by raising the flexible and impermeable mat where 83 photosynthesis was evident given the purple, and green layers, creating an unique "alien" local 84 landscape ( Figure 1 ). Based on the macroscopic morphology of the microbial mats, this locality in 85 the Pozas Azules ProNatura ranch (a private ecological reserve) was named by us the "Archean 86 Domes" (AD thereafter) (Fig. 1a) . 87 These unusual structures in an small extremophilic and fluctuating pond, are by themselves a 88 singularity, within CCB unique nature and amazing microbial diversity that has fascinated scientists 89 with unexpected findings [19-21, 25, 27, 29, 30, 33, 35-43].
