1 To explore potential intermediate host of a novel coronavirus is vital to rapidly control 2 continuous COVID-19 spread. We found genomic and evolutionary evidences of the 3 occurrence of 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus (named as Pangolin-CoV) from dead Malayan 4 Pangolins. Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical at the whole genome level to 5 2019-nCoV and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively. Pangolin-CoV is the lowest common 6 ancestor of 2019-nCoV and RaTG13. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more 7 closely related to 2019-nCoV than RaTG13. Five key amino-acid residues involved in the 8 interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and 2019-9 nCoV but four amino-acid mutations occur in RaTG13. It indicates Pangolin-CoV has 10 similar pathogenic potential to 2019-nCoV, and would be helpful to trace the origin and 11 probable intermediate host of 2019-nCoV.
