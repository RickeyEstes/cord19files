Infectious diarrhea remains one the biggest health challenges in both the beef and dairy industries. More than 20% of beef cattle owners feel that calf diarrhea has a significant impact on their economic productivity, 1 and diarrhea accounts for more than half of all calf mortality on dairy farms. 2 Currently, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus, and coronavirus appear to be the most significant infectious causes of calf diarrhea. Research into the pathophysiology of these organisms may ultimately lead to more specific treatment and control recommendations. Epidemiologic studies of both beef and dairy calves have implicated ETEC as the major cause of neonatal diarrhea occurring in the first 4 days of life; however it rarely leads to diarrhea in older calves or adult cattle. 3-6 Immediately after birth, oral exposure to fecal coliforms leads to colonization of the gut with the normal commensal flora, and these organisms continue to move caudally through the gastrointestinal tract with ingesta. 7,8 If environmental contamination is high, ETEC organisms are ingested at this same time and are able to produce disease caused by the presence of two virulence factors, K99 fimbria and heat stable toxin. Because nonpathogenic E coli are extremely common, fecal cultures as a diagnostic test are of little value unless the presence of these two virulence factors can be demonstrated. Attachment to the intestinal epithelium allows the bacteria to maintain residence in the small intestine and multiply instead of being passed though with the ingesta. Studies have shown that up to 80% of the organisms are attached in calves with ETEC diarrhea, instead of only 10% to 20% in normal calves. 3, 9, 10 This attachment is mediated by the presence of fimbrial antigens. The antigen most commonly associated with
