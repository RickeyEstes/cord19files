C-tkl, which has previously been isolated from a chicken spleen eDNA library is a new member of the src-family of proto-oncogenes. It codes for a protein, which has most significant homology to lck. The new gene is therefore referred to as c-tkl for cellular tyrosine kinase related to lck. -C-tkl was inserted into the genome of a baculovirus. Extracts from insect cells infected with tkl-recombinant baculovirus were incubated with antibodies raised against pS1 c-tkl and a protein kinase assay was performed. Under these experimental conditions PS1 c-tkl shows autophosphorylation activity. -Furthermore we examined the expression of c-tkl related genes in human tissues and corresponding tumors. We found tkl-specific transcripts in lymphocytes, spleen, colon and stomach, which are 3.8 and 11.5 kb in length.
