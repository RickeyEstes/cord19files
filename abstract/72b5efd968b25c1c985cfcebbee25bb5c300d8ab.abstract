Beverley Paterson and David Durrheim make five statements in their letter [1]: (1) That a standard universal case definition of ILI would be helpful but "most formal definitions include a measured temperature and this is not always possible, particularly in developing settings where thermometers may not be readily available." (2) "The spectrum of influenza illness is phenomenal and depends on the characteristics of particular circulating strains." (3) The use of SARI would "likely cause great confusion." (4) The Australian Flutracking system provided "real-time evidence of a mismatch between vaccine components and the circulating strains" and (5) that ILI "offers the opportunistic capacity to identify increases in a range of pathogens that can present with ILI symptoms." http://dx.
