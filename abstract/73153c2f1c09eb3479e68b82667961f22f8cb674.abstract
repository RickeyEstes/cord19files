In order to investigate the ability of an oil adjuvanted vaccine containing bovine coronavirus antigen to enhance lactogenic immunity in the calf, pregnant cows and heifers were vaccinated and speci®c virus neutralising antibody levels determined in serum, colostrum and milk. Pre-existing antibody titres (as a result of natural infection) in the serum of these animals were found to be signi®cantly increased as a result of a single shot vaccination carried out between 2 and 12 weeks before calving. This was re¯ected in a similar increase in the titre and duration of speci®c antibody in milk and colostrum that was passed on to the calves. The overall response observed was highly dependent on an adequate antigen payload being incorporated within the single dose vaccine. No abnormal local or systemic reactions were observed as a result of vaccination. It is hoped that this approach will lead to the production of a superior commercial vaccine for the protection of neonatal calves against enteric coronavirus infection. 7
