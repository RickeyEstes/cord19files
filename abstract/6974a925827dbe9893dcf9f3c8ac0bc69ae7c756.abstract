In the last 30 years, the study of virus evolution has undergone a transformation. Originally concerned with disease and its emergence, virus evolution had not been well integrated into the general study of evolution. This chapter reviews the developments that have brought us to this new appreciation for the general signifi cance of virus evolution to all life. We now know that viruses numerically dominate all habitats of life, especially the oceans. Theoretical developments in the 1970s regarding quasispecies, error rates, and error thresholds have yielded many practical insights into virus-host dynamics. The human diseases of HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus cannot be understood without this evolutionary framework. Yet recent developments with poliovirus demonstrate that viral fi tness can be the result of a consortia, not one fi ttest type, a basic Darwinian concept in evolutionary biology. Darwinian principles do apply to viruses, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution distinguish virus evolution from classical studies. The available
