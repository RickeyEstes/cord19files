Ribonuclease L Oligoadenylate synthetase Influenza A virus Innate immunity Inflammasome Autophagy 2 0 -5 0 Phosphodiesterase Cell migration a b s t r a c t Ever since the discovery of the existence of an interferon (IFN)-regulated ribonuclease, significant advances have been made in understanding the mechanism and associated regulatory effects of its action. What had been studied initially as a ''unique" endoribonuclease is currently known as ribonuclease L (RNase L where ''L" stands for latent). Some of the key developments include discovery of the RNase L signaling pathway, its structural characterization, and its molecular cloning. RNase L has been implicated in antiviral and antibacterial defense, as well as in hereditary prostate cancer. RNase L is activated by 2 0 -5 0 linked oligoadenylates (2-5A), which are synthesized by the oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs), a family of IFN-regulated pathogen recognition receptors that sense double-stranded RNAs. Activated RNase L cleaves single stranded RNAs, including viral RNAs and cellular RNAs. The catalytic activity of RNase L has been found to lead into the activation of several cellular signaling pathways, including those involved in autophagy, apoptosis, IFN-b production, NLRP3 inflammasome activation leading to IL-1b secretion, inhibition of cell migration, and cell adhesion. In this review, we will highlight the newest advances in our understanding of the catalytic role of RNase L in the context of different cellular pathways and extend the scope of these findings to discussion of potential therapeutic targets for antimicrobial drug development.
