Medical imaging is achieving greater effectiveness as a tool to make accurate diagnoses, assess biological aggressiveness and monitor treatment response. Molecular imaging represents a group of integrated and complementary methods that evaluate the biological information resolved in time and space in vivo, at high resolution and by using with specific probes, contrast agents or MR methods with a view not only to understand cell biology but also to provide early diagnosis and support emerging therapies. The use of imaging probes based on different tracers with advanced high-resolution equipment allows viewing complex molecular and cellular structures. Implementation and evaluation of multimodality molecular imaging technology producing multiparametric and multivariable techniques is reinforced. Recent developments in CT technology (increased number of detector rows, shorter turnaround times and radiation dose modulation) and PET technology (more efficient scintillation crystals, 3D and 4D detection technology, TOF and iterative reconstruction algorithms) have been spectacular. PET-MR produces images with excellent tissue contrast, dynamic and functional information. The simultaneous acquisition of PET and MR images allows temporary correction of dynamic PET studies. Positron-emitting radionuclides for PET images, created in a cyclotron (18 F, 11C, 15O, 64Cu, 124I, 13N) or in a generator (68Ga), will be described. In this talk, the principal radiotracers and multimodality (PET-CT and PET-MR) devices will be summarised by showing their possible contribution to the early diagnosis, risk stratification and prognosis and treatment monitoring of biological processes and disease-related cell. The main indications for multimodality PET in the field of oncology, neurology and cardiology will be commented. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the multimodality approach to MI based on PET-CT-MRI. 2. To learn about the different radiotracers that can be used with multimodality equipment. 3. To be informed about future developments that may potentially be used with these techniques. 14:00 -15:30 Room B Interactive Teaching Session EÂ³ 220 Acute abdominal inflammatory disorders A-004 14:00 A. Colitis and enterocolitis C. Hohl; Siegburg/DE (christian.hohl@helios-kliniken.de) The clinical picture of acute abdominal inflammatory disorders comprises of a variety of different disease patterns. In daily practice our colleagues are often referring patients with unspecific clinical symptoms such as abdominal pain, elevated inflammation markers and diarrhoea. Depending on the referring department there are always some presumptive diagnoses -if you are holding a hammer everything looks like a nail. Now it is our turn as diagnostic radiologists to choose the appropriate imaging modality as we have a whole toolbox instead of just holding a hammer. The first step is to get clear about the most likely differential diagnoses. In patients with acute abdomen without history of trauma, the most common diagnoses are ischaemia, inflammation and obstruction. The second step is to adapt the diagnostic tools to the individual case. Beside abdominal plain film and ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are two new and powerful imaging methods that have basically revolutionised the role of conventional radiology in the evaluation of the acute abdomen. To date, contrastenhanced CT is the gold standard in the study of acute abdomen. MRI can add crucial additional information with its superior intrinsic contrast and the options of functional-MRI. In specific cases such as ischaemia angiography can complete the diagnostic workup in patients with acute abdomen. In the third step images have to be interpreted and correlated with the clinical findings. In order to successfully solve the case it is of paramount importance to know the appearance of the top differential diagnoses. Learning Objectives: 1. To know how to choose the appropriate imaging modality. 2. To be familiar with the patterns of distribution and appearance in imaging. 3. To learn how to differentiate ischaemia from inflammation.
