Red pandas are popular exhibit animals and their veterinary care has attracted a fair amount of study and attention. While the information we have on the health of red pandas relies on observations of a relatively small captive population, there have been regular reviews of the pathology of captive red pandas [1Ã€5] (see Chapter 16). Additionally, reports on the management of clinical diseases have slowly increased. As with many captive animals, red panda health problems can be categorized into two age-based groups: paediatric and adult. This chapter addresses the broad health concerns of those two groups, followed by sections on parasites, infectious diseases, and vaccination, and concludes with suggestions for chemical restraint and anaesthesia of red pandas.
