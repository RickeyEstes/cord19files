Pigeons and doves have been associated with humans since 3000 to 5000 BC and make up an estimated 50% of all birds in captivity. Columbids are used for food, hobby, sport (racing homers), entertainment (rollers), display (exotic doves), shows and competitive exhibition (fancy breeds), research and communication (racing homers, tumblers and high fliers). All domestic pigeon breeds are derived from the common rock dove (Columba livia), and there are now more than 800 varieties. Common domesticated doves include the diamond dove (Geopelia cuneata) and European ringneck dove (Streptopelia risoria). There are many excellent books, book chapters, journal articles, and conference proceedings manuscripts on the subject of pigeon medicine. 1-14 This article focuses on bacterial and parasitic diseases of domestic columbiform birds, with special mention of several important underlying viral infections. One of the most important factors in preventing infectious disease in columbid flocks is to incorporate a sound preventative medicine program. Medications are thus rarely necessary if these guidelines are followed by the pigeon fancier: Buy quality stock from quality breeders. Do not introduce new birds into an existing flock until they have been quarantined and physically examined. The optimal length of quarantine is the time for a pair to raise two or three sets of babies. When quarantine is over, introduce one pair at a time to the existing flock. Allow each pair to establish territory before adding the next pair. This method minimizes the stress of pairs finding a place in the loft. Examine all new birds for ectoparasites, such as lice, mites, and pigeon flies. Perform fecal floatation and direct smears to check for helminths and Coccidia
