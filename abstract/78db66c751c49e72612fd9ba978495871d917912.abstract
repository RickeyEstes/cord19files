Background Human infection with avian infl uenza H5N1 is an emerging infectious disease characterised by respiratory symptoms and a high fatality rate. Previous studies have shown that the human infection with avian infl uenza H5N1 could also target organs apart from the lungs. We studied post-mortem tissues of two adults (one man and one pregnant woman) infected with H5N1 infl uenza virus, and a fetus carried by the woman. In-situ hybridisation (with sense and antisense probes to haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein) and immunohistochemistry (with monoclonal antibodies to haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein) were done on selected tissues. Reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR, real-time RT-PCR, strand-specifi c RT-PCR, and nucleic acid sequence-based amplifi cation (NASBA) detection assays were also undertaken to detect viral RNA in organ tissue samples. Interpretation In addition to the lungs, H5N1 infl uenza virus infects the trachea and disseminates to other organs including the brain. The virus could also be transmitted from mother to fetus across the placenta.
