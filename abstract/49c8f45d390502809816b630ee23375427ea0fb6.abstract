A 12-year-old, 3.6-kg, spayed female domestic shorthaired cat had a 2-month history of anorexia and weight loss. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed an exophytic mass originating from the jejunum with very poor central and poor peripheral contrast enhancement. On day 14, surgical resection of the jejunum and mass with 5-cm margins and an end-to-end anastomosis were performed. Histopathological examination revealed the mass was a transmural, invasive cancer showing exophytic growth and originating from the small intestinal muscle layer. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor cells revealed diffuse positivity for KIT protein and negativity for desmin and S-100. The mass was diagnosed as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Ultrasonographic findings indicated the tumor probably metastasized to the liver and omentum, as seen in humans and dogs. The owner rejected further treatment at the last visit on day 192. To our knowledge, this is the first report of intestinal tumor and metastasis in feline GIST and its imaging features. Intestinal tumors are generally rare in cats. Lymphomas account for nearly 30% of all feline tumors and are the most common intestinal tumors [20] . Adenocarcinomas are the second most frequent tumors in cats, followed by mast cell tumors. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are thought to originate from the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), which form a network that coordinates peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract [11] . Many of the smooth muscle tumors in human and canine patients have now been reclassified as GISTs, which by definition express CD117 (KIT) [13, 15] . GISTs have been described in humans, dogs, horses, Spanish ibex, a ferret, a rat, and nonhuman primates [5, 18, 19] . These occur most frequently in the jejunum, cecum and colon [16] . To the authors' knowledge, only one report has described "a feline GIST" in the stomach [17] . A 12-year-old, 3.6-kg, spayed female domestic shorthaired cat with a body condition score of 2/5 presented with a 2-month history of anorexia and weight loss. On physical examination, the animal had a palpable large mass (about 5.0 cm) in the abdomen. No lymphadenopathies were noted at the superficial lymph nodes. A complete blood count test revealed a low packed cell volume (PCV, 24.0%; reference range, 30.3-52.3%), neutrophilia (21,141/µl; reference range, 2,500-12,500/µl) and monocytosis (1,292/µl; reference range, 0-850/µl). A serum biochemical profile revealed hypoalbuminemia (2.6 g/dl; reference range, 2.7-3.8 g/dl) and hyperglobulinemia (5.4 g/dl; reference range, 2.8-5.1 g/dl). The serum protein fraction was normal. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus yielded negative results. Radiography indicated a large mass in the abdomen. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic mass (approximately 41.8 × 60.6 mm) containing hyperechoic and hypoechoic areas of unknown origin and a nodule (approximately 8.4 × 9.5 mm) containing a hypoechoic rim and an isoechoic center in the left lateral lobe of the liver (Fig. 1A and 1B) . Moreover, ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of the large mass showed mostly macrophages and neutrophils. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the abdominal mass sample was negative for feline coronavirus. On day 7, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed under anesthesia. Iopamidol (300 mg I/ml, Oypalomin injection 300; Fuji Pharma Co., Ltd., Toyama, Japan) was used as the contrast medium at a dose of 2 ml/ kg and was injected using a power injector over 15 to 20 sec via the jugular vein. Images were acquired before contrast medium injection, in an arterial phase (20 sec), in a portal phase (40 sec) and at equilibrium (180 sec) after contrast medium injection. CT examination revealed the exophytic mass originating from the jejunum. It had very poor contrast enhancement centrally and poor contrast enhancement peripherally (Fig. 1C) . It was assumed to reflect a cavity of necrotic tissue. In the left lateral lobe of the liver, the hypoattenuating nodule was observed in all the phases (Fig. 1D) . We concluded that the mass originated from the jejunum and could be surgically resected. On day 14, laparotomy was used to expose the mass originating from the jejunum that had an irregular surface and adhesive omentum. Surgical resection of the jejunum including the mass with 5-cm margins and an end-to-end anastomosis were performed ( Fig. 2A) . During surgery, we found enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes
