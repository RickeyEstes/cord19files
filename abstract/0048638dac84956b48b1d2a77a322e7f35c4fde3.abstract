There is increasing interest in understanding the processes that maintain phenotypic variation in groups, populations, or communities. Recent studies have investigated how the phenotypic composition of groups or aggregations (e.g., its average phenotype or phenotypic variance) affects ecological and social processes, and how multi-level selection can drive phenotypic covariance among interacting individuals. However, we argue that these questions are rarely studied together. We present a unified framework to address this gap, and discuss how group phenotypic composition (GPC) can impact on processes ranging from individual fitness to population demography. By emphasising the breadth of topics affected, we hope to motivate more integrated empirical studies of the ecological and evolutionary implications of GPC. Many central questions in evolutionary biology rely on understanding how individual-level and group-level selective processes interact to shape phenotypic variation and specialisation. Individuals can aggregate into groups, and the composition of these groups, populations, or communities (herein group phenotypic composition or GPC, see Glossary) can affect group-level dynamics and self-organisation. For example, large groups of highly similar individuals can benefit from lower predation pressure by making it difficult for predators to track individuals (the confusion effect [1,2]). Eventually, this can drive selection operating on individual phenotypes [3, 4] , in this case by selecting against rare phenotypes because individuals who look different will be more likely to be taken by predators (the oddity effect [1]). Selection arising from GPC can lead to an evolutionary response of individual phenotypes. GPC can shape the evolution of behaviours that mediate individual movements between groups, phenotypic plasticity (individuals adjust their phenotype in response to particular GPCs), or phenotypic traits that allow individuals to manipulate the characteristics of their group. Selection from GPC can also directly modify the covariance between individual and group phenotypes through the removal of particular phenotypes within generations. All these evolutionary responses at the individual level are likely to modify GPC itself. Despite extensive theoretical considerations (see [5] ), the role of GPC as an agent of selection shaping individual fitness and as an emergent property of the individual phenotypes have rarely been considered together in empirical studies. Research across a range of disparate topics will benefit from simultaneously developing an understanding of how GPC affects individual fitness and exerts selection on individual Trends Members of animal groups often vary in their phenotypes (e.g., personality, morphology). Many recent studies have shown how different aspects (e. g., phenotypic average, variation, extreme) of GPC affect group-level outcomes (e.g., foraging success, mating system). Group-level outcomes can shape selection when individual and group phenotypes co-vary. Selection arising from GPC can drive changes in traits that affect aspects of individual-togroup covariance, such as behaviours that determine group membership or by changing the expression of traits (via phenotypic plasticity or indirect genetic effects). A framework based on interacting phenotype theory can quantify the selective consequences and evaluate the evolutionary implications of GPC. This framework is still largely unexplored empirically but it is applicable to many topics in evolutionary biology. phenotypes, and assessing how individual phenotypes respond to GPC, ultimately driving an evolutionary response to selection arising from GPC. For example, moving animal groups can contain both leaders and followers [6, 7] . Much could be learnt about the evolution of leadership by simultaneously assessing how consistent behavioural differences affect group-level outcomes [8] and how group-level outcomes select for particular phenotypes or shape the distribution of phenotypes in the population. Social selection [4] and social heterosis [9] offer candidate frameworks to study selection arising from the social context, but these still need to be expanded to capture the complexities that can arise from the interactions between individuals (Figure 1 ). To study the consequences of group composition, we need to draw on evolutionary theory which integrates quantitative genetics and selection. In this paper we propose that a framework based on the theory of interacting phenotypes [4, 5, 10] can integrate the key mechanisms determining how GPC affects selection acting on individual phenotypes and the subsequent evolutionary implications of GPC.
