These methods can handle the parallel sequencing of several samples by molecular barcoding at very high-throughput and at reduced per nucleotide costs due to the miniaturization of the sequencing reactions. For metagenomic applications an added advantage was the lack of need for prior cloning of amplified target genomic DNA/RNA. With the initiation of NGS methods, the efficiency of DNA and RNA-base examinations explosively increased and the relative costs of sequencing have dramatically decreased (Escobar-Zepeda et al., 2015; Kulski, 2016; Metzker, 2010) . The first commercially available NGS technology was the "pyrosequencing technique" developed by 454 Life Sciences in 2005 and acquired by Roche in 2007, which is a sequencing-by-synthesis method (Barzon et al., 2011; Hutchison, 2007; Kulski, 2016; Schuster, 2008) . During the process, pyrophosphate synthesis is measured with the utilization of chemiluminescent method. In brief, when a nucleotide is incorporated into the DNA chain, pyrophosphate is released ( Fig. 2.2) . The Adenosine triphosphate sulfurylase converts pyrophosphate into ATP, which is used as a substrate for luciferase, hence visible light is detected and measured (chemiluminescence) with charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. The process is reinitiated by adding the next complementary dNTP in the next dispensing cycle (Heather and Chain, 2016; Hutchison, 2007; Kulski, 2016) . The method has disadvantages, including the high error rates in homopolymer repeats, the appearance of indels (insertions, deletions), as well as the time consuming sample preparation protocols. In contrast, the number of sequencing reactions and reads dramatically extended, the quality of data improved by reducing cross-talk between reaction wells, and the system was miniaturized (PicoTiterPlates) enabling the reduction of reaction volume. Furthermore, this platform provides long read lengths (400 bp to 1 kb) (Heather and Chain, 2016; Kulski, 2016; Metzker, 2010; Schuster, 2008 ). 33 2.4 Sequencing technologies FIGURE 2.2 Principle of next generation sequencing platforms currently available. Roche 454, specific adaptor containing DNAs are denatured into single strands and captured by amplification beads followed by their emulsion PCR then pyrosequencing where oxyluciferin release is monitored. SOLiD, this is a ligation based method that uses DNA ligase enzyme to identify the presence of nucleotide at a given position in a DNA sequence. Illumina, selected DNA fragments are ligated with adaptors, and primers designed against them are used for the synthesis. Bridge amplification is carried by PCR and polony generations take place. Oxford Nanopore, This is actually based on the tunneling of polymer molecules passing through a protein nanopore, separating two compartments. Movement of DNA through this pore causes disruption in the current set against the voltage across the pore. Change in the current helps to identify the specific molecule and real time advances the quick data analysis.
