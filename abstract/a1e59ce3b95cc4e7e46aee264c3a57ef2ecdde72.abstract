The biochemical profiles of crossbred dogs experimentally infected with the parasite Angiostrongylus vasorum were studied. Two groups of five dogs were experimentally inoculated with 50 and 100 third stage infective larvae (L 3 ) of A. vasorum per kilogram of body weight. A third group of five uninfected animals were used as control. Serum from these animals were used for biochemical tests to measure total and fractioned proteins, urea, creatinine and to determine the activities of aspartate (AST), alanine (ALT) aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (PAL) and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB). The a-1, a-2 and b-globulins fractions showed alterations during acute phase of the infection. No modifications were observed in the biochemical profiles of ALT, AST, GGT, PAL, urea and creatinine. CK-MB was shown to be a good early indicator of cardiac injury in dogs experimentally infected with A. vasorum. #
