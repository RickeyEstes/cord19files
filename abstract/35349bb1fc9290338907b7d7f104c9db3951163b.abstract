Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) are standard of care for treatment of congestive heart failure, but aldosterone breakthrough occurs when ACEi are used in both dogs and humans. Entresto®, a combinational angiotensin-receptor blocker/neprilysin inhibitor, showed superiority in reducing mortality in human patients with heart failure compared to enalapril. Pharmacodynamics of Entresto® have been evaluated in healthy dogs, showing efficacy in altering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) without causing adverse effects. The aim of this prospective, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study was to compare the pharmacodynamic effects of Entresto® to placebo in dogs with preclinical myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) and to evaluate the safety profile of Entresto® in dogs with cardiac disease. Client-owned dogs weighing 4-15 kg with ACVIM Stage B2 MMVD were enrolled. Dogs with clinically significant pulmonary hypertension or systemic disease were excluded, as were dogs on any medication(s) known to alter the RAAS. All dogs received pimobendan throughout the study period. Each patient was evaluated at three time points (Day 0, Day 7, and Day 30). Echocardiography, thoracic radiographs (CXR), Doppler systemic arterial pressure (SAP), complete blood count, serum biochemical profile, plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration, and urinary aldosterone to creatinine ratio (UAldo:C) were evaluated on Day 0. On Day 0, each dog was randomly allocated to a treatment group (Entresto®; 20 mg/kg BID) or a placebo group by the attending pharmacist. Investigators, veterinary technicians, and owners were blinded to treatment. Serum renal enzyme and electrolyte concentrations and SAP were rechecked on Day 7. Echocardiography, CXR, SAP, renal panel, plasma NT-proBNP concentration, and UAldo:C were rechecked on Day 30. Thirteen dogs were recruited: Entresto® (n = 7) and placebo (n = 6). The median percent increase in UAldo:C between Day 0 and Day 30 was significantly lower in the Entresto® group (12%; P = 0.032) as compared to the placebo group (195%). The median percent decrease of NT-proBNP concentration from Day 0 to Day 30 was not statistically different between groups (P = 0.68). No statistical differences were seen in echocardiographic, CXR, SAP, or biochemical profiles measured at any time point between groups. No adverse events were noted by the owners for dogs in either group. This study suggests that Entresto® efficiently inhibits RAAS in dogs with cardiomegaly secondary to MMVD in comparison to placebo. Entresto® is safe in regards to SAP and renal enzyme and electrolyte concentrations. No adverse effects were noted in any dog taking Entresto®. Future studies comparing Entresto® to ACEi, evaluating the concomitant use of diuretics and Entresto®, and evaluating longterm (> 30 days) effects of Entresto® are warranted. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), the oxidized product of trimethylamine, is produced by gastrointestinal microbiota from certain dietary nutrients including choline and L-carnitine. Elevated plasma concentrations of TMAO, choline, and L-carnitine have been shown to be associated with the presence and severity of cardiovascular disease in people and are independent predictors of adverse cardiac events and mortality. This prospective study investigated whether there are differences in concentrations of circulating TMAO, choline, or L-carnitine in dogs with degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) compared to healthy controls (Controls). Thirty client-owned dogs were recruited, including 10 dogs with CHF secondary to DMVD, 10 dogs with asymptomatic DMVD, and 10 Controls. Echocardiography was performed, and fasting plasma concentrations of TMAO, choline, and carnitine fractions were measured. Data were compared among the three groups using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Trimethylamine N-oxide (P = 0.034), total L-carnitine (P = 0.034), carnitine esters, and carnitine esters to free carnitine ratio (E/F ratio) were significantly higher in dogs with CHF compared to asymptomatic DMVD. Trimethylamine N-oxide (P = 0.022), choline (P = 0.011), total L-carnitine (P = 0.011), carnitine esters, free carnitine, and E/F ratio were significantly higher in dogs with CHF compared to Controls. No differences were detected between asymptomatic DMVD dogs and Controls. Dogs with DMVD and CHF had higher concentrations of TMAO compared to both asymptomatic DMVD dogs and Controls. Prospective studies are warranted to determine if TMAO concentrations can be altered with dietary or gut microflora modification, and whether altering TMAO concentrations could impact disease progression. Loop diuretics provide symptomatic relief for congestive heart failure, yet stimulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). We hypothesized that the two potent loop diuretics, torsemide and furosemide, at approximately equipotent dosages (similar diuresis), would have comparable effects on the circulating RAAS. Six, healthy, middle-aged, male beagles were randomized to receive torsemide (0.1mg/kg PO q12h), furosemide (2.0mg/kg PO q12h), or placebo for 10 days during 3 separate experiments, in a crossover design with a 10-day washout period between experiments. Blood was collected on days 1, 5, and 9 and 24-hour urine collection ended on days 2, 6, and 10. After repeated measures analysis and Bonferonni correction, variables with an adjusted P < 0.05 were investigated further, using Tukey';s method. Twenty-four hour urine production differed significantly between the diuretics only on day 10, with torsemide causing a 38% greater diuresis than furosemide. There was, however, no significant difference in average 3-day diuresis. There were no significant differences between diuretics in the 24-hour urinary excretion of Na + , Cl -, or K + , though furosemide caused less kaliuresis than torsemide. Serum renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone and the urine aldosterone-to-creatinine ratio were significantly increased in the diuretic groups, as compared to placebo on days 5/6 and 9/10. There were no significant differences in these parameters between diuretics. Creatinine and BUN concentrations rose comparably in the 2 diuretic groups, remaining within reference intervals in all dogs. At approximately equipotent dosages (20:1), torsemide and furosemide produced comparable RAAS activation. This, and torsemide';s greater kaliuretic effect decrease support for torsemide';s hypothesized mineralocorticoid-receptor blocking capability. Transvenous pacemaker implantation is the definitive treatment for pathologic bradyarrhythmias, though reported complication rates have historically been high. The purpose of this study was to determine survival times and complication rates for dogs who underwent transve-Atenolol is a β 1 -receptor antagonist commonly prescribed in cats affected with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. The traditional oral dose is 6.25 to 12.5 mg per cat q12-24h. The oral tablet is highly bioavailable (90 ± 9%) with peak atenolol concentration occurring 1-2 hours post administration in cats. However results from several studies indicate owner compliance may be poor with long-term oral treatment, and feline disposition can present specific challenges to owners with chronic oral medication administration.
