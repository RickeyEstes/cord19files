Bats have always fascinated people. Unfortunately, much of the connotations around them have been negative. Their odd appearances, nocturnal life styles, and the fact they harbor a variety of zoonotic diseases, particularly rabies, have lead them to be feared rather than respected. However, beneath the surface of the legend, they are members of a diverse group of animals, many of which are essential for the maintenance of ecosystems. In fact, because of disease and habitat destruction, humans are a greater threat to bats than they are to humans. 68 Recent events such as the emergence of white nose syndrome (WNS) and the continued recognition of metabolic diseases in captive bats have shown that much more research is needed into the medical and environmental needs of these animals. Improving veterinary care, conservation efforts, and captive husbandry relies on a deeper understanding of bat biology and how these unique animals fit into larger ecosystems.
