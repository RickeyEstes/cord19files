During the second phase of the outbreak in April 2003, a coordinated network of hospital is designed to isolate the patients and provide best evidenced care with optimal protection of the caregivers. Several recommendations resulted from the retrospective analysis of these events. These were used to develop a transformation of the healthcare system in Ontario, with creation of local health integrated networks, reorganization of the acute care system with increased capacity, development of infectious disease control. In preparation of a new outbreak, provincial and local task forces have been implemented to provide recommendations in collaboration with the newly created Public Health Agency of Canada.
