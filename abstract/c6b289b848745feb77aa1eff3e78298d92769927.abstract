Similar to most thrombolytic agents, rt-PA carries a signifi cant dose-dependent risk of bleeding. Optimal dosing that maximizes benefi ts and minimizes bleeding complications is important. Methods: A prospective, randomized, multicenter trial was conducted in which 118 patients with acute PTE and either hemodynamic instability or massive pulmonary artery obstruction were randomly assigned to receive a treatment regiment of either rt-PA at 50 mg/2 h (n 5 65) or 100 mg/2 h (n 5 53). The effi cacy was determined by observing the improvements of right ventricular dysfunctions (RVDs) on echocardiograms, lung perfusion defects on ventilation perfusion lung scans, and pulmonary artery obstructions on CT angiograms. The adverse events, including death, bleeding, and PTE recurrence, were also evaluated. Results: Progressive improvements in RVDs, lung perfusion defects, and pulmonary artery obstructions were found to be similarly signifi cant in both treatment groups. This is true for patients with either hemodynamic instability or massive pulmonary artery obstruction. Three (6%) patients in the rt-PA 100 mg/2 h group and one (2%) in the rt-PA 50 mg/2 h group died as the result of either PTE or bleeding. Importantly, the 50 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen resulted in less bleeding tendency than the 100 mg/2 h regimen (3% vs 10%), especially in patients with a body weight , 65 kg (14.8% vs 41.2%, P 5 .049). No fatal recurrent PTE was found in either group. Conclusions: Compared with the 100 mg/2 h regimen, the 50 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen exhibits similar effi cacy and perhaps better safety in patients with acute PTE. These fi ndings support the notion that optimizing rt-PA dosing is worthwhile when treating patients with PTE.
