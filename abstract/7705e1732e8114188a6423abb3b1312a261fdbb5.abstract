Molecular diagnostic methods have evolved and matured considerably over the last several decades and are constantly being evaluated and adopted by clinical laboratories for the identification of infectious pathogens. Advancement in other technologies such as fluorescence, electronics, instrumentation, automation, and sensors have made the overall diagnostic process more accurate, sensitive, and rapid. Nucleic acid based detection procedures, which rely on the fundamental principles of DNA replication have emerged as a popular and standard diagnostic method, and several commercial assays are currently available based on different nucleic acid amplification techniques. This review focuses on the major amplification chemistries that are used for developing commercial assays and discusses their application in the clinical virology laboratory. The development of PCR by Kary Mullis in the 1980s revolutionized the detection of microbial pathogens in clinical specimens. PCR is a highly sensitive method that involves cyclical heating and cooling of the reaction mixture to facilitate amplification of the target DNA [3]. The method consists of three basic steps (denaturation, annealing, and extension) and the reaction mixture requires four primary components (template DNA, primers, nucleotides, and a DNA polymerase) (Fig. 1a) . Double-stranded target DNA (dsDNA) is thermally denatured to form a single-stranded DNA template (ssDNA). Oligonucleotide primers anneal to complementary target sequences on the nucleic acid template and are extended by the DNA polymerase, thus creating the resultant PCR product (amplicon). The reaction occurs in a programmable thermal https://doi.
