Canine coronavirus (CCV) is a common faecal agent which is difficult to isolate. This study shows CCV to survive well at temperatures below -20°C but not at temperatures above 4°(:. The presence of faecal material markedly reduced CCV survival times at temperatures ranging from 20°C to -70°C. Thus, it is suggested that diagnostic faecal material should be diluted 1:10 (w/v) with growth medium and examined at the earliest opportunity.
