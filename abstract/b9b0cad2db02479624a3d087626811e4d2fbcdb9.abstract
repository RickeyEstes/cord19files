Host shifts -where a pathogen jumps between different host species -are an 18 important source of emerging infectious disease. With ongoing climate change 19 there is an increasing need to understand the effect changes in temperature may 20 have on emerging infectious disease. We investigated whether species' 21 susceptibilities change with temperature and ask if susceptibility is greatest at 22 different temperatures in different species. We infected 45 species of Drosophilidae 23 with an RNA virus and measured how viral load changes with temperature. We 24 . CC-BY 4.0
