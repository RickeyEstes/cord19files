Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations for stem cell-based product manufacture and characterization incorporate the tremendous experience gained in many cell therapy clinical trials and the experience of the entire field of stem cell research. In advising sponsors about their stem cell development program, the FDA recognizes the need for flexibility in its recommendations and will consider many factors, including the intended target population, the seriousness of the disease under study, and the potential benefits and risks from the investigational product. The agency continually updates and reassesses recommendations for stem cell production and testing based on the growing experience and on feedback from a variety of sources. This chapter describes development of FDA recommendations and summarizes current recommendations applicable to stem cell-based cellular therapies.
