The advent of the genomic era has made elucidating gene function at large scale a pressing challenge. ORFeome collections, whereby almost all ORFs of a given species are cloned and can be subsequently leveraged in multiple functional genomic approaches, represent valuable resources towards this endeavor. Here we provide novel, genome-scale tools for the study of Candida albicans, a commensal yeast that is also responsible for frequent superficial and disseminated infections in humans. We have generated an ORFeome collection composed of 5,102 ORFs cloned in a Gateway™ donor vector, representing 83% of the currently annotated coding sequences of C. albicans. Sequencing data of the cloned ORFs are available in the CandidaOrfDB database at http://candidaorfeome.eu. We also engineered 49 expression vectors with a choice of promoters, tags, and selection markers and demonstrated their applicability to the study of target ORFs transferred from the C. albicans ORFeome. In addition, the use of the ORFeome in the detection of protein-protein interaction was demonstrated. Mating-compatible strains as well as Gateway™-compatible two-hybrid vectors were engineered, validated and used in a proof of concept experiment. These unique and valuable resources should greatly facilitate future functional studies in C. albicans and the elucidation of mechanisms that underlie its pathogenicity. author/funder.

Human ORFeomes have also been generated and made publicly available, with the latest version containing sequence-confirmed ORFs for more than 11,000 human genes (29). Most ORFeome libraries are created using the highly versatile Gateway™ cloning approach (30). The Gateway™ technology employs the recombination system of bacteriophage lambda with two sets of reactions: the BP reaction, catalysed by Gateway™ BP Clonase™, facilitates recombination between attB and attP sequences, and the LR reaction, catalysed by Gateway™ LR Clonase™, promotes recombination between attL and attR sequences (30). Previously, we have reported the development of a first generation C. albicans ORFeome, in which 644 full-length ORFs, encoding signaling proteins (transcription factors and kinases), as well as cell wall proteins and proteins involved in DNA processes (repair, replication and recombination), were cloned in the Gateway™ vector pDONR207 (31). Here we describe the generation and validation of the latest Candida albicans ORFeome collection, which consists of 5,102 ORFs in pDONR207, allowing the transfer of the cloned genes into a variety of C. albicans Gateway™-compatible expression vectors. To this end, we also provide a panel of 15 expression vectors that differ in the combination of promoter/selection marker they are carrying, and give different options regarding the tagging of the cloned gene product. These 15 expression vectors have been validated using the filament-specific transcription factor UME6. In addition, we also provide a secondary collection of 34 expression vectors with additional options regarding the choice of the promoter and the tagging of the cloned gene product. Finally, among the numerous applications of ORFeome collections, we present a author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
