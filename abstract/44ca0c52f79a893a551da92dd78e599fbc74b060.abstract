Site-directed mutagenesis in vitro was used to introduce stop codons in the genomic DNA of the a and/3 chains of the murine class II major histocompatibility complex antigen, I-A k. Mutated DNA was transfected into B lymphoma cells that were then selected by neomycin resistance and for their ability to express I-A k molecules on their plasma membrane. The translational diffusion coefficient (Dtat) of I-A k molecules composed of a wild-type/3 chain paired with an ot chain missing either 6 or 12 amino acids from the cytoplasmic domain is on the average threefold higher than the D,,, of wild-type I-A k molecules as measured by fluorescence photobleaching and recovery. The removal of 12 amino acids from the cytoplasmic domain of the/3 chain did not change the D~a~ value from that of wild-type I-A k if the truncated/3 chain was paired with a wild-type c~ chain. Removing all amino acids of the cytoplasmic domains of both the ot and/3 chains resulted in a 10-fold increase in the Dtat, the highest value for any of the truncated I-A k molecules tested. These data indicate that the carboxy-terminal six amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of the et chain and the six plasma membrane-proximal amino acids of the/3 chain are important in constraining the translational diffusion of I-A k molecules in the plasma membrane.
