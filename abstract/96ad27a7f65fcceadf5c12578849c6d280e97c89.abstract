Public health services and systems Organizational capacity Survey Follow-up study Canada a b s t r a c t The collective impact of major shifts in public health infrastructure and numerous new chronic disease prevention (CDP) capacity-building initiatives that have taken place in Canada over the last decade is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine if CDP capacity (i.e., skills and resources) and involvement in CDP programming improved in public health organizations in Canada from 2004 to 2010. Data for this repeated crosssectional study were drawn from two waves of a national census of organizations mandated to carry out primary prevention of chronic disease and/or promotion of healthy eating, physical activity and tobacco control. Medians for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables were compared across time. Neither resources nor level of priority for CDP increased over time. There was little difference in the proportion of organizations with high levels of skills and involvement in core CDP practices (i.e., needs assessment, identification of relevant practices, planning, evaluation). Skills and involvement in CDP risk factor programming showed some gains, some steady states and some losses. Specifically, skill and involvement in tobacco control programming declined markedly while the proportion of organizations involved in healthy eating and physical activity programming increased. Skills to address and involvement in programming related to social determinants of health remained low over time as did involvement in * Corresponding author. 3875, rue Saint-Urbain, 1st Floor,
