The World Health Organization has recently declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-27 19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, as pandemic. There is 28 currently a lack of knowledge in the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 29 infection. One major immunological question is concerning the antigenic differences 30 between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by using plasma from 31 patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and plasma obtained from infected or 32 immunized mice. Our results show that while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the 33 spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses is rare, indicating the 34 presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether these non-neutralizing antibody responses will lead to antibody-dependent 36 disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only 37 addresses a fundamental question regarding the antigenicity differences between 38 SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, but also has important implications in vaccine 39 development.
