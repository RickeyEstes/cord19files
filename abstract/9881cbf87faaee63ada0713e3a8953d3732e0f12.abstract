The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is where the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules are loaded with epitopes to cause an immune cellular response. Most of the protein antigens are degraded in the cytoplasm to amino acids and few epitopes reach the ER. Antigen targeting of this organelle by Calreticulin (CRT) fusion avoids this degradation and enhances the immune response. We constructed a recombinant adenovirus to express the E7 antigen with an ER-targeting signal peptide (SP) plus an ER retention signal (KDEL sequence). In cell-culture experiments we demonstrated that this new E7 antigen, SP-E7-KDEL, targeted the ER. Infection of mice with this recombinant adenovirus that expresses SP-E7-KDEL showed interferon induction and tumour-protection response, similar to that provided by an adenovirus expressing the E7 antigen fused to CRT. This work demonstrated that just by adding a SP and the KDEL sequence, antigens can be targeted and retained in the ER with a consequent enhancement of immune response and tumour protection. These results will have significant clinical applications. Mice. Female C57BL6 mice (6-8 weeks old) were purchased from Harlan (México City, México), housed in the animal facilities of the Histology Department of the School of Medicine, UANL, and cared for in conformity with good laboratory practice guidelines. Cell lines. HEK293 cells were maintained in advanced DMEM supplemented with 4% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS). TC-1 cells derived from primary epithelial cells of C57BL/6 mice co-transformed with HPV-16 E6 and E7 and the c-Ha-ras oncogenes, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. All of the cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). Adenovirus Purification kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Lysed cells, mixed with 30 l 2ϫ SDS loading buffer, were heated at 100ЊC for 5 min., and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein samples were separated by electrophoresis gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 hr with 10% non-fat dry milk in TBST (135 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 24.8 mM TRIS . HCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) and then probed with an antibody in TBST for 1 hr at 25 ЊC. A monoclonal antibody against HPV16 E7 protein (Zymed) was used to probe the expression of E7. Blots were rinsed with TBST, incubated with rabbit antimouse IgG-HRP second antibody (Sigma) for 1 hr, then rinsed with TBST again, and developed with Super Signal West Pico stable peroxide solution (Pierce).
