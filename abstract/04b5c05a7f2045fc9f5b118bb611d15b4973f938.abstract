A series of 1 0 -substituted analogs of 4-aza-7,9-dideazaadenosine C-nucleoside were prepared and evaluated for the potential as antiviral agents. These compounds showed a broad range of inhibitory activity against various RNA viruses. In particular, the whole cell potency against HCV when R = CN was attributed to inhibition of HCV NS5B polymerase and intracellular concentration of the corresponding nucleoside triphosphate.

Structural modification of natural N-nucleosides on either the sugar or the base has led to the discovery of a variety of therapeutic agents, which includes antivirals and anticancer agents. This approach has been continuously employed to further identify agents with improved efficacy and safety over existing drugs, overcome issues associated with drug-resistance, and expand into new therapeutic areas. 1 Among all the conceivable modifications of the sugar moiety, incorporation of a substitution at 1 0 -position of the N-nucleosides has been rarely exploited in drug discovery. 2 This is partly due to the chemical instability induced by the 1 0 -substituent (i.e., ready dissociation of the base and the sugar at lower pH). For example, 1 0 -C-Me adenosine is rapidly degraded in aqueous solutions at pH <7. 3 However, C-nucleoside, in which the sugar and the base are linked through the C-C bond, should be hydrolytically stable even with a 1 0 -substituent. Thus, we envisioned that C-nucleoside could be an ideal scaffold to explore various 1 0 -substituted nucleosides for their therapeutic potential. As part of an on-going effort to identify new antiviral agents, we were interested in investigating 1 0 -substiuted nucleosides as inhibitors of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Such nucleoside inhibitors should be converted by intracellular kinases to the triphosphorylated nucleosides, which then function as competitors of the natural nucleoside triphosphates (TP) in RNA synthesis. 7-Deazaadenosine (1, Tubercidin) is a naturally occurring, cytotoxic N-nucleoside. It is triphosphorylated inside the cells and then incorporated into RNA by host RNA polymerases, which is believed to be the main mode of action for the observed cytotoxicity. 4 A C-nucleoside analog of 1, 4-aza-7.9-dideazaadenosine (2) has shown equally potent cytotoxicity to cancer cell lines. 5 The TP of 2 was also shown to be a substrate of host RNA polymerases and incorporated into RNA (unpublished results). Thus, we chose compound 2 as a template to investigate the effect of the 1 0 -substituent on antiviral activity and selectivity. Here, we report (1) preparation of a series of novel 1 0 -substituted analogs of compound 2, (2) their antiviral activities against a panel of RNA viruses, and (3) correlation of the observed anti-HCV potency with both intrinsic enzyme (HCV NS5B) activity and intracellular level of the corresponding TP.
