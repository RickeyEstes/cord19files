A novel series of 5-arylcarbamoyl-and 5-arylmethyl-2-methylisoxazolidin-3-yl-3-phosphonates have been synthesized via cycloaddition of N-methyl-C-(diethoxyphosphoryl)nitrone with N-substituted naphthalimide acrylamides and N-allylnaphthalimides. All cis-and trans-isoxazolidine phosphonates obtained herein were assessed for antiviral activity against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses. Isoxazolidines trans-9d and trans-9f exhibited the highest activity (EC 50 = 8.9 lM) toward cytomegalovirus. Compounds cis-and trans-9d as well as cis-and trans-9f were found potent against HSV and Vaccinia viruses (EC 50 in the 45-58 lM range), whereas isoxazolidines 10a and 10d suppressed replication of Coxsackie B4 and Punta Toro viruses (EC 50 in the 45-73 lM range). Antiproliferative evaluation of all obtained isoxazolidines revealed the promising activity of cis-9b, cis-9d, trans-9d, cis-9e, trans-9e, cis-9f and trans-9f toward tested cancer cell lines with IC 50 in the 1.1-19 lM range.
