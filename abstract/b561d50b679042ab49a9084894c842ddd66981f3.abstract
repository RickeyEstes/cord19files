Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common complication of critical illness or injury associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The pathogenesis of ARDS involves mechanical and inflammatory injury to the lungs that causes marked derangement in alveolar-capillary permeability and the passage of protein-rich edema fluid into the air spaces. 1,2 ARDS usually occurs in a context of uncontrolled response to local or systemic inflammation and most recently two endotypes of ARDS-namely, hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory-have been identified with different therapeutic responses and prognoses. 3, 4 The clinical pathogenesis is often multifactorial, with complex interaction of risk factors and risk modifiers (Fig. 15.1) .
