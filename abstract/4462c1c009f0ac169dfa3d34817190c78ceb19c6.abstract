Excitotoxins are thought to kill neurons while sparing afferent fibers and axons of passage. The validity of this classical conclusion has recently been questioned by the demonstration of axonal demyelination. In addition, axons are submitted to a profound alteration of their glial environment. This work was, therefore, undertaken to reassess axonoglial interactions over time after an excitotoxic lesion
