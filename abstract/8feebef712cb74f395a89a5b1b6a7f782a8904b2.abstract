Translation then proceeds in the Ϫ1 frame. All examples of eukaryotic ϩ1 frameshifting thus Summary far also entail a site at which recoding occurs, and a stimulator. Frameshifting occurs either by slippage (Bel-We investigated a herpesvirus mutant that contains a court and Farabaugh, 1990) or by a mechanism whereby single base insertion in its thymidine kinase (tk) gene specific structural features of the tRNA in the P site yet expresses low levels of TK via a net ϩ1 translational appear to facilitate out-of-frame binding of an aminoarecoding event.
