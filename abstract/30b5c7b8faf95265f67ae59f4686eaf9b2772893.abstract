14 Traveller screening is being used to limit further global spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) 15 following its recent emergence. Here, we project the impact of different travel screening 16 programs given remaining uncertainty around the values of key nCoV life history and 17 epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will 18 miss more than half of infected travellers. Breaking down the factors leading to screening 19 successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally 20 undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were 21 exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill 22 after being missed by a travel screening program. We make our model available for interactive 23 use so stakeholders can explore scenarios of interest using the most up-to-date information. We 24 hope these findings contribute to evidence-based policy to combat the spread of nCoV, and to 25 prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.
