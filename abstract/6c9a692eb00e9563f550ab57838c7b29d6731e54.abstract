Viral respirator 5" in(ectians represent a significant segment of the total respiratory disease speclrum; however, until reeentl 5" the laboralory diagnosis oJ viral respiratory infections was relalirely im;f#icient. Development of new and hnproved immunologic assay systems has paved the way for accurate and reliable rapid diagnostic tests that detect viral antigens in clinical specialens. We conducted a careful and elaborate study in which radioimmunoassay for antigen detection was compared with u battery of tissue culture systems for viral isolation and iden-ti#Tcati(m. Using a lTne plastic catheter, a specimen of mucus was aspirated from the nasopharynx o.f patients with clinical signs and symptoms of acute viral upper respiratory tract infections. Each spechnen was divided into two portions; one was used to inoculate a variety o.f tissue culture cell lines and the other was used for radioimmunoassay tests for influenza A and B. adenavirus, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, and respiratory syncytial virus. Radioimmunoassav results campared very favorably with the tissue culture data with on/v one exception-adenovirus. Essentially this degree of accuracy and reproducibility was obtained with an enzrnle-liaked imnmnosorbent assay test. which has replaced radioimmunoassa.r. Tissue cultures are still used for backup, but with a rapid antigen detection system in place, coupled with a modern computer program ta facilitate the laboratory data to the clinician, considerable strides hare been nlade, and will continue to be made, in the diagnosis and therapy of viral respirat()r 5" tract infections.
