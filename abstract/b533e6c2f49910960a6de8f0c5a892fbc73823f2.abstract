Hemagglutination inhibition The ability of an immune serum to block the clumping of red blood cells caused by cross-linking of the cells by multivalent viruses with receptors for red blood cell surface antigens. Heterotypic Able to recognize more than one virus serotype. Jennerian A vaccine approach in which an animal virus is used to protect humans from disease. Reassortment The exchange of gene segments between viruses with multipartite genomes during coinfection. Split vaccine A vaccine with antigens from chemically disrupted virus particles. Subunit vaccine A vaccine with antigens that are purified virus or microbe components. Toll-like receptors A type of receptor that recognizes conserved microbial components and triggers an innate immune response but does not undergo splicing recombination to generate diversity. Viremia Presence of virus in the blood. Most vaccines in use today are the result of empirical development. The mechanism of action of many vaccines in common use remains incompletely understood. Understanding how such vaccines protect is an ongoing subject of study using increasingly sophisticated immunological tools, such as B cell and T cell repertoire and transcriptome analysis. Such tools are also being applied to the design of vaccines against those viral targets that have evaded vaccine-mediated protection thus far. As basic immunological science intersects with the practicalities of assuring vaccine safety, tolerability, efficacy, and consistency in the clinic, the practical utility of more sophisticated immunological measures for vaccine development may be determined by whether they can be reduced to simply executed, highly standardized, reproducible assays with outcomes that have clear interpretations for vaccine development and use. Basic immunology, empirical vaccine testing, and regulatory science are all necessary contributors to developing the next generation of vaccines, including vaccines effective against the pathogens for which vaccines are not currently available.
