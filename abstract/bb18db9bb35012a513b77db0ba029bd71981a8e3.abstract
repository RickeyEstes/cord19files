Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) belongs to the Semliki Forest antigenic group of the genus Alphaviridae, which includes other arthritogenic alphaviruses, such as o'nyong-nyong, Ross River, Barmah Forest, and Mayaro viruses. 1,2 Its genome is closely related to that of o'nyong-nyong virus, and consists of a single 11.8-kbp strand of positive sense RNA, which encodes a 2472 amino acid nonstructural and a 1244 amino acid structural polyprotein. 3 The polyproteins give rise to the four nonstructural proteins (nsP1-4) that make up the viral replication machine, and five structural proteins. Each spherical viral particle is approximately 70 nm in diameter and is comprised of a strand of genomic RNA, encapsidated by capsid (C) proteins, surrounded by a host cell-derived lipid bilayer spiked with heterodimers of envelope proteins E1 and E2. 4 The other two structural proteins, 6K and E3, are leader peptides for E1 and E2, respectively, and are not observed in abundance in the mature virion. 4 Disclosure Statement: The authors have no relevant disclosures. KEYWORDS Chikungunya virus Alphavirus Arbovirus Togaviridae Chikungunya is an arboviral infection that causes debilitating arthritis and arthralgia. Chikungunya virus has caused explosive epidemics in the past decade, and has spread rapidly from Africa to Asia to the Americas. Improved diagnostic testing and surveillance for chikungunya infection is needed to detect and respond to future outbreaks. Further investigation into the pathogenesis of chikungunya infection is needed to understand its long-term sequelae, and to develop effective therapies.
