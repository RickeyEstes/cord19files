Previous studies have examined different strategies for siRNa delivery with varying degrees of success. These include use of viral vectors, cationic liposomes, and polymers. several copolymers were designed and synthesized based on blocks of poly(ethylene glycol) PeG, poly(propylene glycol) PPG, and poly(l-lysine). These were designated as P1, P2, and P3. We studied the copolymer self-assembly, siRNa binding, particle size, surface potential, architecture of the complexes, and siRNa delivery. silencing of GFP using copolymer P3 to deliver GFP-specific siRNa to Neuro-2a cells expressing GFP was almost as effective as using Lipofectamine 2000, with minimal cytotoxicity. Thus, we have provided a new copolymer platform for siRNa delivery that we can continue to modify for improved delivery of siRNa in vitro and eventually in vivo. Figure 9 . Gene silencing of GFP protein in Neuro 2a/GFP cells at a final concentration of 80 nM siRNa. cells were treated with complexes of copolymer P1, P2, and P3 with GFP siRNa at N/P ratio of 6, 12, and 24. cells were also treated with naked siRNa or Lipofectamine-complexed siRNas as additional controls.
