Viral Fusion Protein Structures and N-glycosylation Sites (NGS). Viral fusion proteins are typically trimers of heterodimers with a globular head domain and a stalk/transmembrane domain. A GlucNAc 1 or GlucNac 2 are modeled at each NGS (Blue). (a) Lassa virus (LASV) glycoprotein (GP) complex contains 11 (NGS) with 7 in GP1 and 4 in GP2 (PDB: 5VK2) [27]. (b) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) Envelope (Env) GP contains around 29 NGS with 25 in gp120 the outer Env domain and 4 in gp41 the transmembrane domain (PDB: 5FYK) [49 ]. (c) Ebola virus (EBOV) GP has 17 NGS with 15 on GP1 and 2 on GP2 (PDB: 6G9B) [101]. (d) Coronavirus (CoV) spike GP has 26 NGS with 15 in subunit 1 and 11 in subunit 2 (PDB: 6BFU) [89]. (e) Influenza virus hemagglutinin is a homotrimer with 11 NGS (PDB: 4FNK) [92].
