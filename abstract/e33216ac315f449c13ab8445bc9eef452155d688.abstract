There are six major causes of diarrhea in calves less than 21 days of age: enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium parvum (C parvum) type II, Salmonella enterica (S enterica) subsp. enterica serovars, and nutritional. Regardless of the etiology, calves with diarrhea often have increased coliform bacterial numbers in the small intestine; small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is associated with altered small intestinal function, morphologic damage, and increased susceptibility to bacteremia and endotoxemia. 1-3 The importance of bacterial overgrowth in calf diarrhea has garnered renewed attention with the realization that D-lactic acid plays an important role in the development of acidemia in calves with diarrhea. Production of D-lactic acid results from bacterial fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract and is a common finding in neonatal calves with and without diarrhea. 4-8 D-lactic acid is a major component of acidemia in diarrheic calves 6, 8, 9 and is accompanied by systemic signs of weakness and ataxia. 10 This review focuses on adjunct therapy of diarrhea in the first 3 weeks of life and therefore does not address the efficacy of adjunct treatment for calf diarrhea due to Eimeria bovis, Eimeria zurneii, or Giardia duodenalis. The main principles of ancillary treatment in neonatal calves with diarrhea and systemic illness are: (1) treat or prevent Gram-negative septicemia and bacteremia; (2) decrease the numbers of coliform bacteria in the proximal small intestine and abomasum; (3) increase nonspecific resistance; (4) provide nutrients that facilitate repair of damaged intestine and prevent negative energy balance; and (5) provide analgesia and reduce stress to the calf.
