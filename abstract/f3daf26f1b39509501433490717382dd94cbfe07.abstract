In this study, peptides were selected to recognize staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) which cause food intoxication and can be used as a biological war agent. By using commercial M13 phage library, single plaque isolation of 38 phages was done and binding affinities were investigated with phage-ELISA. The specificities of the selected phage clones showing high affinity to SEB were checked by using different protein molecules which can be found in food samples. Furthermore, the affinities of three selected phage clones were determined by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors. Sequence analysis was realized for three peptides showing high binding affinity to SEB and WWRPLTPESPPA, MNLHDYHRLFWY, and QHPQINQTLYRM amino acid sequences were obtained. The peptide sequence with highest affinity to SEB was synthesized with solid phase peptide synthesis technique and thermodynamic constants of the peptide-SEB interaction were determined by using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and compared with those of antibody-SEB interaction. The binding constant of the peptide was determined as 4.2 ± 0.7 Â 10 5 M À1 which indicates a strong binding close to that of antibody. Ó 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Phage display techniques have aroused interest as a new tool in protein-ligand interaction studies since described by Smith [1]. This technology has been used to detect peptides which show high affinity to target molecules required for immunological and biological studies, drug discovery, pharmacology, plant science, and also inorganic materials [2] . Also through this technology, detection of ligands which are specific target proteins is accomplished without animal or human immunization system. Recombinant protein and/or peptides structures which have recognize capability of target molecules are fused on Ff class (M13, f1, and fd) of filamentous phages. DNA fragments which code peptides are added pVIII, pIII or pVI gen regions of phages capsid proteins. Random DNA sequences that coded different peptides on phage genomes supply different peptides or proteins which have different antigen specificities [3] [4] [5] . The foreign DNA sequences can be originated from a natural source, or it can be advisedly designed and synthesized chemically [5] . Using a process of biopanning, selection of peptides from phage library is accomplished. Phage library is added to immobilized target molecules which in plates. After incubation non-binding phages washed away and selectively bound phage to target molecules are eluted and amplified in host bacteria. These amplified phages serve as input for another round of biopanning. Rounds of selection are generally repeated two or three times in same way and affinity of each phage clone from eluted phages to target molecules are ascertained by phage-ELISA and sequences of peptide are determined [3, 6] . Phage display technology has been used for selection and production of molecules that have antibody characteristics. Recombinant antibodies have been selected against various analytes like staphylococcal enterotoxin B [6], spores of Bacillus anthracis [7], Art v1 glycoprotein [8], rotavirus NSP4 enterotoxin [9], coronavirus [10], Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin serotype A [11], Salmonella typhimurium [12], and human Gonadotropin-releasing hormone promoter [13] by phage display technology. It also has been used to design high affinity super antigens for immunochemical application and immunotherapy [14] and to choose specific molecules to inorganic materials [2]. In this study, we have used a peptide-phage display library to identify peptides binding to SEB. SEB, produced by Staphylococcus aureus, is a pyrogenic toxin responsible for staphylococcal food poisoning in humans and has been an attractive choice of biological aerosol weapon due to its inherent stability and high intoxication effect [15] . Numerous immunological techniques have been applied to the detection of SEB such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELI-SA) [16] . Because the traditional immunological methods are in most cases time-consuming and inconvenient, many novel and rapid immunosensors have been developed for the detection of SEB based on piezoelectric crystal sensors [17, 18] , surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors [19] [20] [21] , and fiber optic sensors [22] . 0006-291X/$ -see front matter Ó
