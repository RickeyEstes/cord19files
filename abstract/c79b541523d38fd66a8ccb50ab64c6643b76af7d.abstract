Background: Passive immunotherapy using polyclonal antibodies (immunoglobulins) has been used for over a century in the treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of various infections and toxins. Heterologous polyclonal antibodies are obtained from animals hyperimmunised with a pathogen or toxin. Aims: The aims of this review are to examine the history of animal polyclonal antibody therapy use, their development into safe and effective products and the potential application to humans for emerging and neglected infectious diseases. Methods: A literature search of OVID Medline and OVID Embase databases was undertaken to identify articles on the safety, efficacy and ongoing development of polyclonal antibodies. The search contained database-specific MeSH and EMTREE terms in combination with pertinent text-words: polyclonal antibodies and rare/neglected
