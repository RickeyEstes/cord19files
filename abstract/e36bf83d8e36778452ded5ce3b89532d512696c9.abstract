The coronavirus spike glycoprotein (S) mediates both the attachment of virus to the host cell receptor and membrane fusion. We describe here the characterization of a temperature-sensitive mutant of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59) having multiple S protein-related defects. The most remarkable of these was that the mutant, designated Albany 18 (Albl8), assembled virions devoid of the S glycoprotein at the nonpermissive temperature. Albl8 also failed to bring about syncytia formation in cells infected at the nonpermissive temperature. Virions of the mutant assembled at the permissive temperature were much more thermolabile than wild type. Moreover, mutant S protein that was incorporated into virions at the permissive temperature showed enhanced pH-dependent thermolability in its ability to bind to the MHV receptor. Albl8 was found to have a single point mutation in S resulting in a change of serine 287 to isoleucinÂ¢, and it was shown by revertant analysis that this was the lesion responsible for the phenotype of the mutant.
