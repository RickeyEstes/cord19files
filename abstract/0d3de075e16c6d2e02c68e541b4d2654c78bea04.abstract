Bilateral pulmonary nodules and acute respiratory failure in a 22-year-old man with dyspnoea and fever. Breathe 2017; 13: 317-322. Bilateral pulmonary nodules and acute respiratory failure in a 22-year-old man with dyspnoea and fever A 22-year-old white male presented complaining of a 3-week history of fatigue, cough and haemoptysis, accompanied by fever (38Â°C max), dyspnoea and mucopurulent sputum in the last few days. He denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dysuria and weight loss. He reported being a smoker (10 pack-years) and a cannabis user, and had a history of allergic rhinitis. He denied occupational exposures. Before our evaluation, he received empiric antibiotic therapy for 5 days, which resulted in the abatement of fever. Following the persistence of dyspnoea and haemoptysis, he had chest radiography with multiple nodular opacities associated with pleural effusion on the left (figure 1) and lung ultrasound (US) with a convex probe showing multiple hypoechoic, bilateral foci associated with B-lines and bilateral pleural effusion, mainly on the left.
