Regulated secretory cells have two pathways that transport secreted proteins from the Golgi complex to the cell surface . To identify carrier vesicles involved in regulated and constitutive secretion, PC12 pheochromocytoma cells were labeled with [33S]sulfate to identify markers for the two secretory pathways, then mechanically permeabilized and incubated in vitro. Small constitutive secretory vesicles, containing mostly sulfated proteoglycans, accumulated during an in vitro incubation with ATP In the presence of M EMBRANE traffic between compartments involves carrier vesicles that bud from a donor compartment and fuse with the acceptor compartment . To explain how membrane proteins are sorted to different organelles, we need to know how the carrier vesicle selects a subset of the proteins present in the donor membrane compartment and how it fuses exclusively with the acceptor. With these questions in mind, considerable effort has been expended in identifying carrier vesicles involved in ER to Golgi transport, intra-Golgi transport and post-trans-Golgi
