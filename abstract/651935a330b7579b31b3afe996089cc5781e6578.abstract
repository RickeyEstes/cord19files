The role of Group X secreted phospholipase A 2 (GX-sPLA 2 ) during influenza infection has not been previously investigated. We examined the role of GX-sPLA 2 during H1N1 pandemic influenza infection in a GX-sPLA 2 gene targeted mouse (GX À / À ) model and found that survival after infection was significantly greater in GX À / À mice than in GX þ / þ mice. Downstream products of GX-sPLA 2 activity, PGD 2 , PGE 2 , LTB 4 , cysteinyl leukotrienes and Lipoxin A 4 were significantly lower in GX À / À mice BAL fluid. Lung microarray analysis identified an earlier and more robust induction of T and B cell associated genes in GX À / À mice. Based on the central role of sPLA 2 enzymes as key initiators of inflammatory processes, we propose that activation of GX-sPLA 2 during H1N1pdm infection is an early step of pulmonary inflammation and its inhibition increases adaptive immunity and improves survival. Our findings suggest that GX-sPLA 2 may be a potential therapeutic target during influenza.
