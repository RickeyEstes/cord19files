Background: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for infectious diseases, with a turn-around time 37 <2 hours, are promising tools that could improve patient care, antimicrobial stewardship and 38 infection prevention in the emergency department (ED) setting. Numerous RDTs have been 39 developed but not necessarily for the ED environment. Their successful implementation in 40 the ED relies on their performance and impact on patient management. 41 Objectives: The aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview of currently available 42 RDTs for infectious diseases in the ED. 43 Sources: PubMed was searched through August 2019 for available studies on RDTs for 44 infectious diseases. Inclusion criteria included: commercial tests approved by the FDA or CE-45 IVD with data on clinical samples, ability to run on fully-automated systems and result 46 delivery within 2 hours. 47 Content: A non-exhaustive list of representative commercially available FDA or CE approved 48 assays was categorized by clinical syndrome: pharyngitis and upper respiratory tract 49 infection, lower respiratory tract infection, gastrointestinal infection, meningitis and 50 encephalitis, fever in the returning traveler and sexually-transmitted infection including HIV. 51 The performance of tests was described based on clinical validation studies. Further, their 52 impact on clinical outcomes and anti-infective use was discussed with a focus on ED-based 53 studies. 54 Implications: Clinicians should be familiar with the distinctive features of each RDT and 55 individual performance characteristics for each target. Their integration into ED workflow 56 should be pre-planned considering local constraints of given settings. Additional clinical 57 studies are needed to further evaluate their clinical and cost effectiveness. 58 345 17. Pierce VM, Elkan M, Leet M, McGowan KL, Hodinka RL.
