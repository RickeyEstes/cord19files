h a p t e r The importance of carbohydrate-recognizing viral surface glycoproteins in a range of clinically important viral infections has been identified and a number of these proteins have been investigated as possible drug discovery targets. As a part of these investigations several of these proteins have had their three-dimensional structures determined by either nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic or X-ray crystallographic methods. This structural information has provided an excellent basis for structure-assisted inhibitor design using computational chemistry methods. This chapter describes some of the most significant developments in the field of structure-based investigations of viral surface-resident carbohydrate-recognizing proteins. Specifically, an overview of these carbohydrate-recognizing proteins from four important human viruses, including influenza, dengue, rotavirus and parainfluenza, and associated structural investigations will be presented.
