Benzo [b]furo [3,2-d] [1, 3]oxazine Anti-osteoclastic bone resorption activity Antagonistic activity for the cysLT1 receptor Growth inhibitory activity for MIA PaCa-2 and MCF-7 (5) with a characteristic exo-formylmethylene group on the oxazine ring. The Z-isomer was more stable than the E-isomer. The Z-isomers ((Z)-5) were reacted with phosphonate reagents under two different conditions to obtain various butadiene derivatives (12) containing benzo[b]furo[3,2-d][1,3]oxazine skeleton. Typical compounds (5 and 12) were evaluated for their anti-osteoclastic bone resorption activity, antagonistic activity for the cysLT1 receptor and growth inhibitory activity for MIA PaCa-2 and MCF-7. Compounds 12f and 12j showed potent anti-osteoclastic bone resorption activity comparable to E 2 (17b-estradiol).
