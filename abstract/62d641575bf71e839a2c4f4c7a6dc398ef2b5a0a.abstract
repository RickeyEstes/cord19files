As a result, they believe that comparative medicine is an interdisciplinary subject of Laboratory Animal Science and Medicine, focusing on the similarities and differences in medical problems in humans and animals of different species. By establishing animal models of various human diseases, they have studied the occurrence, development, and outcome of diseases caused by the same pathogen in different species, and systematically compared and studied the molecular, organizational, and overall mechanisms that cause these differences in order to understand the nature of human diseases, aging, and life span. They have applied this theory in infectious diseases that have troubled human beings throughout history. In the past 30 years, many new infectious diseases, including AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Lyme disease, Hantavirus pneumonia, Nile virus infection, Ebola virus hemorrhagic fever, avian influenza, have emerged, and some diseases are still spreading around the world. Animal models of infectious diseases are indispensable for the study of pathogen-host interactions, immune regulation, and evaluation of vaccines and therapeutic drugs. There are a few key points that need to be considered in the development of infectious disease animal models. Which animals are sensitive to new pathogens? Will the animal-specific diagnostic reagents be developed in time since the clinical ones cannot be applied to animal models? Is there any animal model for simulating the whole process of infectious diseases to support the research? According to these concerns, Prof. Qin Chuan and her team have analyzed the receptors of pathogens and immune systems of different species and strains of animals by comparative medicine methods. The resource bank of susceptible animals with different pathogens has been established to solve the problem of timeliness in the establishment of animal models. By comparing and analyzing the genome, immune factors of humans and different species of animals, and eliminating the background interference of animals, 19 kinds of pathogen monitoring reagents for animal models have been developed. This has solved the problem of clinical reagents being unsuitable for animal detection due to species differences and the short time scale for establishing models. Aimed at the same pathogens, the animal model system (AMS) of different animal species and genetically modified animals has been established, so that factors such as genome, receptor, immunity, pathology, and transmission have been clinically compared and analyzed. The AMS is able to reflect the whole process of various diseases, which has solved the problem of a single animal model being unable to simulate diseases comprehensively. Under this guideline, in 2004, Prof. Qin and her team developed the first nonhuman primate model for SARS infection, which reflects the pathogenesis process of clinical SARS infection. 1 In 2009, they developed the H1N1 transmission model to predict the risk of spread and the carrying of pathogens in animals in close contact with humans. 2 In 2010, the
