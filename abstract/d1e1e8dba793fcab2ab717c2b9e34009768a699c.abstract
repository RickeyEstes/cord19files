KEY WORDS immune response.modifier; anogenital warts; human papillomavirus miquimod is an immune-response modifier available as a 5% cream for treating external anogenital warts. Demonstrated to exert antiviral activity by stimulating a local immune response, imiquimod 5% cream offers an effective, nonablative alternative to current treatments. Imiquimod (AldaraTM, 3M Pharmaceuticals, St. Paul, MN) is an immune-response modifier. In the United States, it is currently indicated for the treatment of external anogenital warts. Available in a 5% cream, it is applied by the patient to the warts and adjacent skin three times a week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday) for up to 16 weeks until warts are gone. Imiquimod (1-(2-methylpropyl)-lH-imidazo[4,5c]quinolin-4-amine) has a structural formula indicative of a novel compound. The mechanism of action of imiquimod in treating genital and perianal warts is unknown. It has no direct antiviral activity in cell culture. Studies in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) suggest that imiquimod induces cytokines, including interferon-o, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor. 1,e Additionally, results of a vehicle-controlled clinical trial demonstrated that application of imiquimod 5% cream induced local production of interferon and reduced the viral load of human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes 6 and 11. -PHARMACOKINETICS Minimal systemic absorption of imiquimod through intact skin occurs during treatment with topically applied imiquimod 5% cream. Clinical studies showed no quantifiable concentrations of imiquimod or metabolites in serum, and <0.9% of a single 5-mg dose was excreted in urine and feces. Imiquimod 5% cream is generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events occurred at the wart site and were mild to moderate in intensity. Discomfort was reported by fewer than 50% of patients receiving imiquimod 5% cream during clinical trials, and fewer than 2% discontinued therapy because of adverse events. The most common application-site reactions reported at least once by women were itching (32%), burning (26%), pain (8%), and soreness (3%). Treatment with imiquimod 5% cream is also associated with local skin reactions, the most common of which, in female patients, were erythema (65%), erosion (31%), excoriation/flaking (18%), edema (18%), ulceration (8%), and induration (5%) at the wart site. Erythema is characteristic of a local immune response. Imiquimod 5% cream is rated Pregnancy Category B. There arc no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of imiquimod 5% cream in pregnant women. Additionally, safety and efficacy in
