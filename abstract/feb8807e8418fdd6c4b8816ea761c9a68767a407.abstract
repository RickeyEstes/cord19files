Xylella fastidiosa is an insect-borne bacterium confined to the xylem vessels of plants. This plant 15 pathogen has a broad host range estimated to 560 plant species. Five subspecies of the pathogen with 16 different but overlapping host ranges have been described, but only three subspecies are widely 17 accepted, namely subspecies fastidiosa, multiplex and pauca. Initially limited to the Americas, Xf has 18 been detected in Europe since 2013. As management of X. fastidiosa outbreaks in Europe depends on 19 the identification of the subspecies, accurate determination of the subspecies in infected plants as early 20 as possible is of major interest. Thus, we developed various tetraplex and triplex qPCR assays for 21 Xylella fastidiosa detection and subspecies identification in planta in a single reaction. We designed 22 primers and probes using SkIf, a bioinformatics tool based on k-mers, to detect specific signatures of 23 the species and subspecies from a dataset of 58 genome sequences representative of X. fastidiosa 24 diversity. We tested the qPCR assays on 39 target and 30 non-target strains, as well as on 13 different 25 plant species spiked with strains of the different subspecies of X. fastidiosa, and on samples from 26 various environmental and inoculated host plants. Sensitivity of simplex assays was equal or slightly 27 better than the reference protocol on purified DNA. Tetraplex qPCR assays had the same sensitivity 28 than the reference protocol and allowed X. fastidiosa detection in all spiked matrices up to 10 3 cells.mL -29 1 . Moreover, mix infections of two to three subspecies could be detected in the same sample with 30 tetraplex assays. In environmental plant samples, the tetraplex qPCR assays allowed subspecies 31 identification when the current method based on multilocus sequence typing failed. The qPCR assays 32 described here are robust and modular tools that are efficient for differentiating X. fastidiosa subspecies 33 directly in plant samples. 34
