The crystal structure Boston, Massachusetts 02115 of the Bcr coiled coil has recently been solved (Zhao et al., 2002), and the monomer forms a left-handed ␣ helix characterized by a heptad repeat with apolar residues Summary in the first (a) and fourth (d) positions of the repeat. Two monomers associate in an antiparallel dimer that stacks Bcr-Abl is a dysregulated tyrosine kinase whose to form a tetramer, consistent with experimental obmechanism of activation is unclear. Here, we demonservations. Deletion of the initial 63 amino acids of Bcr strate that, like c-Abl, Bcr-Abl is negatively regulated or insertion of proline-containing peptides into the through its SH3 domain.

These results suggest that Bcr-Abl has merized by extracellular ligands (Schlessinger, 2000) , a a monomeric, unphosphorylated state with the SH3 simple model suggests that fusion of Bcr activates the domain engaged intramolecularly to Pro1124 in the Abl kinase by dimerization-induced intermolecular auto-SH2-CD linker, the form that is sensitive to the inhibitor phosphorylation.

The sole function of the coiled-coil lacking the coiled-coil domain can be restored by redomain is to disrupt the autoinhibited conformation placement with the leucine zipper domain from GCN4 through oligomerization and intermolecular autophos-(McWhirter and Wang, 1997) or a conditional oligomerphorylation. ization motif (K.M.S. and R.A.V., unpublished data), demonstrating that the transforming properties of Bcr-Introduction Abl, , To clarify the role of the Bcr coiled-coil domain in 1998; Brasher et al., 2001; Van Etten et al., 1995) and regulating the catalytic and oncogenic activity of p210 N-terminal domains (Pluk et al., 2002), regulatory tyro-Bcr-Abl, we generated several novel Bcr coiled-coil musine phosphorylation (Brasher and Van Etten, 2000; tations that are predicted to abrogate oligomerization, Dorey et al., 2001), and binding of cellular inhibitors as well as complementary point mutations in the SH3 (Pendergast et al., 1991a; Wen and Van Etten, 1997). domain, a putative SH3 binding site, and potential auto-Despite almost two decades of intensive research, the phosphorylation sites in Abl.
