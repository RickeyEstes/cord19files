Cancer and the immune system are intimately related. Much of the bulk of tumors is comprised of stromal leukocytes with immune functions, which serve to both promote and inhibit tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. The T lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system are essential for tumor immunity, and these T cells are generated by cross-priming against tumor associated antigens. Dendritic cells (DCs) are essential in this process, serving as the cellular link between innate and adaptive immunity. As a prerequisite for priming of adaptive immune responses, DCs must take up tumor antigens, process them and present them in the context of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). DCs also serve as sensors of innate activation signals from cancer that are necessary for their activation and effective priming of cancer specific T cells. Here we discuss the role of DCs in the sensing of cancer and in priming the adaptive response against tumors. Furthermore, we present the essential role of the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) signaling pathway in producing type I interferons (IFNs) that are essential in this process. 2.1.1. Conventional DCs; cDC1 and cDC2-cDC1s are efficient at cross-presenting and priming CD8+ T cells against cell-associated antigens, but have relatively low CD4+ T cell activating potential (Shortman and Heath, 2010). Mouse cDC1s express high levels of CD11c, MHCII, CD8Î±, CD24, and often XCR1, CD141, Clec9a, DEC-205 and CD103 and Vatner and Janssen
