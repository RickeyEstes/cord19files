finding of the clinical and the environmental isolate (1,2). The existence of MATa in nature is also supported by recent studies designed to established the origin of the serotype AD strains (4, 5) . These studies demonstrated that AD strains were diploid or aneuploid hybrids derived from a fusion of serotype A and D parents and that several of them were harboring a serotype A MATa locus. These hybrid strains have been found fairly often in Europe (9,10). The finding of this isolate provides evidence of the pathogenic role of this rare mating type, emphasizes the critical function of molecular genetic tools in the characterization of C. neoformans populations, and represents an advance in knowledge of this fungal species whose genome is undergoing identification by a worldwide research team.
