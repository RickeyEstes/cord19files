Natural selection acting on synonymous mutations in protein-coding genes influences genome composition and evolution. In viruses, introducing synonymous mutations in genes encoding structural proteins can drastically reduce viral growth, providing a means to generate potent, live attenuated vaccine candidates. However, an improved understanding of what compositional features are under selection and how combinations of synonymous mutations affect viral growth is needed to predictably attenuate viruses and make them resistant to reversion. We systematically recoded all non-overlapping genes of the bacteriophage ΦX174 with codons rarely used in its E. coli host. The fitness of recombinant viruses decreases as additional deoptimizing mutations are made to the genome, although not always linearly, and not consistently across genes. Combining deoptimizing mutations may reduce viral fitness more or less than expected from the effect size of the constituent mutations and we point out difficulties in untangling correlated compositional features. We test our model by optimizing the same genes and find that the relationship between codon usage and fitness does not hold for optimization, suggesting that wild-type ΦX174 is at a fitness optimum. This work highlights the need to better understand how selection acts on patterns of synonymous codon usage across the genome and provides a convenient system to investigate the genetic determinants of virulence. : bioRxiv preprint host-phage relationships that are too short-lived for selection to fine tune codon usage in the phage, or inadequate understanding of the features under selection. Empirically developed (e.g. serial passage viral adaptation) vaccines have saved millions of lives over the last century, yet methodological improvements make rationally designed, recombinant vaccines attractive because they can be rapidly produced and specifically engineered for safety and effectiveness (46-50) . One proposed method of generating recombinant vaccines involves making many synonymous, attenuating changes to viral genomes, i.e. "deoptimizing" the viral genes (51) . The recombinant vaccine can be made by either editing the genome of the wild-type virus or by generating a viral genome entirely from synthesized nucleic acids. Synonymous deoptimization offers a potentially efficient and effective way of making vaccines: the protein sequences of recoded vaccines are identical to their target viruses, they replicate in their host to provide prolonged exposure to the antigen, and the introduction of many synonymous changes presumably assures evolutionary robustness, preventing the evolution of virulence by reversion. Poliovirus serves as a very good example for the synonymous recoding strategy. Development of a robust, live-attenuated poliovirus vaccine is desired because in some areas on Earth wild poliovirus and the emergent vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) continues to cause concern over the resurgence of poliomyelitis (52-55) . A synthetic poliovirus was assembled in 2002 (56) , codon deoptimized in 2006 (57, 58) , codon pair deoptimized in 2008 (59) , and dinucleotide deoptimized in 2009 (11) . In all cases, attenuated viruses were produced by recoding the P1/capsid region of the genome. In vitro , these viruses replicate slower and produce lower viral titers than wild-type virus. In vivo the codon pair deoptimized strain protected mice against challenge by wild poliovirus (59) . While the mechanism of attenuation is not yet fully elucidated, reduced protein expression of the deoptimized genes is observed (11, 57-59) . These deoptimized poliovirus constructs are genetically stable and remain non-virulent for up to 25 passages in cell culture (57, 59) . The apparent success of building poliovirus vaccine candidates using synonymous recoding led to similar attempts to develop vaccines for influenza, adeno-associated, human immunodeficiency, papilloma, chikungunya, respiratory syncytial, simian immunodeficiency,
