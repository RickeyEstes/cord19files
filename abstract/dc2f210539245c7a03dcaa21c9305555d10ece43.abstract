Although the CD4 + CD25 high regulatory T cell population represents only 2-3% of all peripheral blood CD4 T cells, it contains over one third of all class II expressing T cells in the peripheral blood. Highly purified, FACS-sorted DR + (~30% DR + CD25 high ) and DR-(~70% DR-CD25 high ) CD4 + CD62L high CD25 high Treg cells demonstrate equivalent suppressive activity in an anti-CD3 driven, in vitro dmicroT co-culture system. Both types of CD25 high Treg cells exhibit cell contact-dependent suppression, anergy, and expression of Foxp3 mRNA, at only slightly different levels. Substantial differences in the inhibitory nature of the DR + CD25 high and DR-CD25 high populations are uncovered when the cells are provided with different strength costimulatory signals. Upon CD2 costimulation, DR + CD25 high co-cultures exhibit a strong, early suppression of both proliferation and Th1/Th2 cytokine production, while DR-CD25 high co-cultures exhibit a much delayed suppression (late) that is accompanied by a preferential inhibition of Th1 cytokines (IFNg), and often an induction of IL-10 and IL-4. Importantly, IL-10 has contrasting effects on regulation by these two different types of Treg cells, underscoring another major difference between these two types of CD25 high Treg cells. Unlike the usual effect of IL-10 in reducing the immune response, IL-10 actually inhibits the suppression by DR + CD25 high and thus enhances co-culture responses. In contrast, IL-10 appears to be a component of the suppressive mechanism of the DR-CD25 high cells. Possibly due to this differential involvement of IL-10, the DR + CD25 high and DR-CD25 high populations cross regulate each other in vitro, and may do so in vivo as well. Importantly, these differences in the kinetics of suppression, Th1/ Th2 skewing, and involvement of IL-10 between the DR + CD25 high and DR-CD25 high populations are only seen when these two populations are studied as distinct populations. Thus it is apparent that the study of heterogeneous combined Treg populations would obscure possibly contrasting responses. It is possible that these different functional features may reflect a temporal order to the utilization of different regulatory subsets in vivo as the immune response switches from innate to adaptive immunity. Chronic progression of relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (R-EAE) in the SJL mouse is dependent on the activation of T cells to endogenous myelin epitopes, i.e. epitope spreading which plays a major pathologic role in disease progression. Using transfer of naive CFSE-labeled TCR transgenic T cells and mixed bone marrow chimeras, we show that activation of naive PLP139-151-specific T cells in SJL mice undergoing PLP178-191-induced R-EAE occurs directly in the CNS and not in the cervical lymph nodes, spleen or other peripheral lymphoid organs. Flow cytometric and histologic examination of the CNS during R-EAE revealed the infiltration of significant numbers of CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) (including myeloid, lymphoid and plamacytoid subsets) which are not seen in the healthy CNS. Functional examination of the antigen presentation capacity of APC populations purified from the CNS of mice with established PLP178-191-induced R-EAE shows that only F4/80-CD11c+CD45hi DCs efficiently present endogenous antigen resulting in the activation of naive PLP139-151-specific Tg T cells. In contrast, DCs as well as F4/80+CD45hi macrophages and F4/80+CD45lo microglia have the capacity to activate memory PLP139-151-specific Th1 cells. The current results indicate that naive T cells can gain access to the inflamed CNS, bypassing the need for activation in peripheral lymphoid sites, and that epitope spreading initiates principally within the CNS target organ. Further, activation of naive T cells is involved in chronic R-EAE is mediated by CNS DCs, not infiltrating macrophages or resident microglia. Consequently, blocking the recruitment or differentiation of DCs may be a viable target for inhibiting relapse and disease progression in murine MS models and possibly MS patients themselves. ; 5 These Authors Contributed Equally to the Work. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by localized areas of inflammation and demyelination. MS can present itself as various clinical forms: a relapsing-remitting course, progressive course or unusual progression like in DevicTs disease in which lesions are found only in the optic nerve and in the spinal cord but not the brain. In addition, the first clinical presentation in a significant proportion of MS patient is often isolated optic neuritis (ON). The underlying immunological basis for different forms of MS and its association with other diseases like optic neuritis is not well defined. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a T cell mediated disease that shares many clinical and histological features with MS. However, to date, the development of ON has always been associated with EAE and there is no spontaneous animal model of DevicTs disease. Although myelin-specific Th1 cells are able to induce EAE in unimmunized mice, studies in both MS and EAE suggest that B cells and antibodies may play a role in demyelination. We have developed a TCR transgenic mouse, 2D2, specific for a minor protein of the CNS myelin called myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and have previously reported that a large proportion (47%) of these TCR transgenic mice developed spontaneous isolated ON. We have now crossed our TCR transgenic 2D2 mice to an IgH knock-in mutant mouse (Th) in which all the B cells are specific for MOG and produce MOG-specific antibodies. The knock-in mice do not spontaneously develop EAE. However, over 60 % of 2D2xTh mice, which express both MOG-specific T and B cells, developed a very early and severe form of EAE. Histological examination of the central nervous system of these animals reveal a selective distribution of the inflammatory foci and lesions restricted to spinal cord and optic nerve, a lesion pattern that is typical of DevicTs subform of MS. The importance of MOG specific T and B cells cooperation, and the role of antibodies in the development of DevicTs disease will be discussed. Antibody-induced demyelination is an important component of the pathology in multiple sclerosis (MS). In particular, antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) are elevated in MS patients and have been implicated as mediators of demyelination. The aim of our studies is to elucidate the mechanism of anti-MOG mediated demyelination. We show that antibody cross-linking of MOG in oligodendrocytes results in the repartitioning of MOG into lipid rafts, leading to changes in the phosphorylation of specific proteins, and culminating in rapid morphological alterations. Using proteomic analyses, we have identified 10 target proteins whose phosphorylation state is altered upon anti-MOG treatment. These proteins fell into functional categories related to the regulation of signal transduction, leading to cellular stress response and cytoskeletal instability. These changes were specific for anti-MOG; although cross-linking myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) also instigates signaling modifications, these are distinct from those observed with MOG and did not result in oligodendrocyte morphological alterations. We next applied our findings to EAE models, analyzing antibodies to MOG that develop after immunization of C57BL/6 mice with MOG from rat or human origin. Interestingly, although these regimens result in EAE with similar anti-MOG antibody titers as evaluated by ELISA, only human MOG requires B cells for disease induction. Further, IgG to human, but not rat MOG, bound unfixed rodent oligodendrocytes and induced repartitioning of MOG into lipid rafts and morphological alterations. These data suggest a novel mechanism for antibody pathogenicity in B cell mediated EAE, and provide in vitro tools to determine whether an autoimmune antibody is pathogenic, and may be useful for evaluating the pathogenicity of antibodies in MS patients as an adjunct to diagnosis and treatment.
