Sia come in 21 a variety of chemically modified forms, including those with acetyl modifications at the 22 C7, C8, and C9 positions. Here, we analyzed the distribution and amounts of these 23 acetyl modifications in different human and canine cells. As Sia or their variant forms 24 are receptors for influenza A and influenza C viruses, we examined the effects of these 25 modifications on virus infections. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl and 7,9-O-acetyl 26 modified Sia are widely but variably expressed across cell lines from both humans and 27 canines. While they were expressed on the cell surface of canine MDCK cell lines, they 28 were located primarily within the Golgi compartment of human HEK-293 and A549 cells. 29 The O-acetyl modified Sia were expressed at low levels of 1-2% of total Sia in these cell 30 lines. We knocked out and over-expressed the sialate O-acetyltransferase gene 31 (CasD1), and knocked out the sialate O-acetylesterase gene (SIAE) using 32 CRISPR/Cas9 editing. Knocking out CasD1 removed 7,9-O-and 9-O-acetyl Sia 33 expression, confirming previous reports. However, over-expression of CasD1 and 34 knockout of SIAE gave only modest increases in 9-O-acetyl levels in cells and no 35 change in 7,9-O-acetyl levels, indicating that there are complex regulations of these 36 modifications. These modifications were essential for influenza C infection, but had no 37 obvious effect on influenza A infection. 38
