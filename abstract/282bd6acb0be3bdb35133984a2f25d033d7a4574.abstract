The propagation of a mouse-adapted strain (67N) of haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus in infected mice and murine cells was examined by viral re-isolation and immunostaining. Viral propagation was strictly limited to the neurons and to an established line ofneuroblastoma cells in in-vivo and in-vitro experiments. These results provide adequate evidence that this virus is neurotroplc.
