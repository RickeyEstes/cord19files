The reaction of ethyl dibromofluoroacetate with imines using zinc metal gave 2-fluoroaziridine-2-carboxylates via aza-Darzens reaction of the primary product of the Reformatsky reaction with high diastereoselectivity in excellent yields (quantitative yield and Dr = 85:15). This chemoselective formation of 2-fluoroaziridines was achieved by using CH 3 CN as a solvent. Interestingly, the reaction proceeded without activation of zinc metal, which was necessary for the Reformatsky reaction of bromodifluoroacetate. None of a-bromo-a-fluoro-b-lactams, four-membered cyclization products, and noncyclized 3-amino-2bromo-2-fluorocarboxylic esters, usual Reformatsky adducts, were formed. Many methods were developed to introduce fluorine functional groups to various bioactive molecules, since the interesting effects of fluorine functional groups were brought about by putting them on a suitable position of bioactive compounds. 1 Among them, fluorinated amino acids and the peptides derived from them have been attracting much attention in medicinal field. 1c,2 On the other hand, aziridine compounds have been used in many fields. For example, these compounds are used as building blocks to form aand b-amino acids by ring-opening reaction. 3 Further, aziridine-2-carboxylates themselves have been applied to antibacterial agents 4 and SARS-CoV protease inhibitor. 5 Recently, we reported that the Reformatsky-type reaction of ethyl dibromofluoroacetate (1) with imines (2) using Et 2 Zn gave syn-a-bromo-a-fluoro-b-lactams (3) in good yields (Scheme 1). 6 The products were obtained with perfect diastereoselectivity and high chemoselectivity. In this reaction, a small amount of 2-fluoroaziridine-2-carboxylate (4) was isolated as a side product, which must be formed by the aza-Darzens reaction of the primary product. We call this side of reaction as the Reformatsky-type aza-Darzens reaction. Surprisingly, only two methods for the synthesis of 2-fluoroaziridine-2-caboxylates (4) have been reported, in one of which the construction of fluorinated aziridine-2-carboxylate was achieved by addition of an a-fluoro-a-ethoxycarbonylcarbene to a C@N double bond 7 and in the other by addition of a nitrene to an a-fluoroa,b-unsaturated ester. 8 However, these reactions gave the products only in low yields. Further, it was troublesome to generate the nitrene or carbene species. Recently, Jubault and co-workers reported Et 2 Zn-promoted reactions of 1 with ketone in the presence of N,N-dimethylaminoethanol as an additive to give fluorinated glycidic esters via common Darzens reaction. 9 Our previous results 6 stimulated us to examine the Reformatsky-type aza-Darzens reaction of 1 with imines (2) in order to obtain 2-fluoroaziridine-2-carboxylate (4) selectively (Scheme 2). In this report, we wish to describe our recent results on the Zn-mediated chemo-and stereoselective formation of 4 by adjusting the reaction condition. Using our previous condition, 6 the reaction of 1 with benzylidenebenzylamine (2a) and Et 2 Zn in Et 2 O at À10°C gave 3a as a main product with a small amount of 4a (Table 1 , entry 1). Depending on the reaction conditions, the ratio of products changed dramatically. The desired product 4a was obtained selectively in CH 3 CN (entry 2). Conventional Reformatsky condition using activated Zn metal also led to selective formation of 4a (entry 3). Interestingly, unac-0040-4039/$ -see front matter Ó
