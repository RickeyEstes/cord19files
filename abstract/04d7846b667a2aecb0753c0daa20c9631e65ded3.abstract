After a brief historical introduction and the distinction between hydrolysable and condensed tannins, a description of their chemistry and a short historical review on their use in leather tanning, the more recent developments in tannins for adhesives with and without the use of any aldehyde-yielding compounds, even without the use of any hardeners, are described. Examples of the use of tannins for other industrial, nonleather, applications are reported. In particular, this chapter focuses briefl y on their new intended use in the medical and pharmaceutical fi elds. New data on their antiviral effectiveness against a great number of different viruses compared to their higher, lower or absent cytotoxicity are also presented. Tannins are a renewable resource that is ' coming of age ' in several fi elds different from their usual, classical application, namely hide tanning to produce heavy duty leather. Leather tanning has been used for centuries, millennia in fact, by immersing hides in pits in which tree bark or wood rich in tannin, such as oak, had been left in. This method took up to one full year to produce good leather. However, the actual tannin extraction industry is relatively more recent. It started in Lyon, France and in northern Italy in the 1850s to satisfy the need for black dyes for silk clothes. As the fashion of women silk blouses waned towards the 1870s, the multitude of small chestnut tannin extraction factories that had sprung up underwent a dramatic change of fortune, many going into bankruptcy and closing down, others combining to build enough critical mass to fi nd an alternative use for tannin extract [1] . The few surviving producers, managed to convince the leather manufacturers that, by dissolving tannin extract in the treatment pits, leather could be manufactured in just 1 month, instead of the 1 year it took on an average with the traditional bark bath technology. As a consequence, the tannin extraction industry started its second life for an application quite different from the original one. The advantages of tannin extract in leather making, and the timesaving involved by its use, were such that the industry underwent rapid expansion and prospered. The short availability of materials in Europe to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for tannin extracts for leather prompted the opening of factories in far-away countries and the use of new types of tannins. Thus, in the early 1900s, tannin factories using quebracho tannin from South America and Mimosa tannin from Southern and Central Africa started their extraction in industrial quantities and exported them to the main northern hemisphere markets. 179 -8 -
