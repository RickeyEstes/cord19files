Supporting Experimental Procedures HepaRG cells (Biopredic) were cultured with Williams' medium E (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 mg/ml streptomycin, 10% FBS, 5 mg/ml insulin (Wako), 20 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech), 50 mM hydrocortisone (Sigma) and 2% DMSO (Sigma). HepAD38 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Christoph Seeger at Fox Chase Cancer Center) (33) were cultured with DMEM/F-12+GlutaMax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES (Invitrogen), 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 mg/ml streptomycin, 10% FBS, and 5 mg/ml insulin in the presence of 400 mg/ml G418 (Nacalai) and 0.3 mg/ml tetracycline. Tetracycline was removed to induce HBV production. Huh-7.5.1 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Francis Chisari at Scripps Research Institute) were cultured as described previously (51). The isolation of and the culture medium for primary human hepatocytes (PHH) (Phoenixbio) were described previously (52). Most experiments in this study utilized HBV derived from HepAD38 cells (33). To induce virus production, HepAD38 cells were cultured in the absence of tetracycline. Culture medium, collected every three days over the period 7-31 days post-induction, was passed through a 0.45 mm filter. Virus was precipitated using 10% PEG8000 and 2.3% NaCl. The precipitates were washed and resuspended with medium at approximately 200-fold concentration. HBV DNA was quantified by real time PCR. For Fig. 3A, we recovered the media of HepG2 cells transfected with an expression plasmid for HBV genotype A, B, or D (HBV/Aeus, HBV/C-AT, or HBV/D-IND60) (53) at 3 and 6 days posttransfection. Virus was concentrated and quantified as described for HepAD38 cells. HepaRG cells and PHH were infected with HBV at 2000-20000 (normally 6000) genome equivalents (GEq)/cell in the presence of 4% PEG8000 at 37ËšC for 16 h as previously described (23). Under these conditions, efficient infection of HepaRG cells using virus derived from HepAD38 or HepG2.2.15 cells requires an inoculum of >10 4 HBV GEq/cell (i.e. 1.25 -40 x 10 4 GEq/cell) (54).
