Resistance of mice to mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) infection is genetically determined. Normal adult AI] mice are resistant, and BALB/c mice are susceptible. Higher titers of virus and interferon (IFN) in vivo were found in MHV3-infected BALB/c mice compared with AI] mice. In vitro activation of macrophages (M<IÂ» by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) delayed MHV3 replication only in cells that originated from AI] mice, although cell populations from both AI] and BALB/c mice were able to synthesize comparable amounts of IFN-a/~. Using specific antibodies, we have shown that the delayed MHV3 replication in LPS-activated AI] M<I> was due, in part, to IFN-a/~. AI] M<I> were found to be more sensitive to IFN-y than to IFN-a/~, and BALB/c M<I> did not develop an antiviral state to either IFN. Cultured spleen cells from AI] mice synthesized more IFN-y than BALB/c spleen cells after specific or non-specific stimulation. The results indicate that IFN-activated M<I> may playa crucial role in the resistance to MHV3 infection. Since IFN-y is produced in large amounts by AI] spleen cells after specific stimulation with MHV3 and is efficient in activating the AI] M<I>, a T cell-dependent mechanism is likely to be involved.
