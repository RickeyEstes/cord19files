There is extensive evidence that cultured macrophages from genetically resistant or susceptible strains of mice reflect the genetic resistance or susceptibility of the host. Yet the effects of cortisone, cytoxan, and epierythrozoon in vitro are minimal or absent. However, experiments reported here have shown that certain substances (lymphokines) in supernatant fluid from allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) rendered the macrophages of C3H mice susceptible to MHV. Fluid derived from congenic MLC did not change the resistance of C3H macrophages to the virus. Mice. Three inbred strains of mice were used: PRI, a genetically susceptible strain (4); C3H, a genetically resistant strain (4); and C3Hss, a strain that carries a single gene for susceptibility. Both the PRI and C3H strains have been maintained in our laboratory through brother-sister mating since 1955 (4). The C3Hss was developed in this laboratory by backcrosses with PRI mice; progeny were selected on the basis of susceptibility of their cultured macrophagee to destruction by the Princeton strain of MHV (MHV.PRI). Mice from two other strains that are not histocompatible with the C3H strain were also used. These were C57 black/6 and DBA/2 stock mice, 4-6-wk old, from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine. Virus. The MHV-2 strain of mouse hepatitis virus was originally obtained from Dr. John Nelson of the Rockefeller Institute, Princeton, in 1952, and has since been passed in our laboratory by intraperitoneal inoculation of l-too-old PRI mice. This is the the MHV-PRI virus. A 10% (wt/ vol) liver homogenate was prepared by grinding up livers of moribund infected mice in Hanks' balanced salt solution (BSS) (Grand Island Biological Co., Grand Island, N. Y.). This was kept as stock virus and stored at -70°C. Macrophage Cultures. Methods of harvesting and preparing cultures of mouse peritoneal macrophages have been previously described (5). In the present experiments, macrophages were seeded in 13 x 100-ram Wassermann tubes and incubated at 37°C in a roller drum. MLC. Individual spleens from PRI, C3H, and C3Hss mice were removed and passed through a 60-mesh stainless steel wire cloth (Small Parts, Inc.). Cells were counted and suspended in a medium consisting of 80% RPMI-1640 (Grand Island Biological Co.), 20% Chang's medium (6) (90% horse serum, 8% Hanks' BSS and 2% beef embryo extract), and 100 U/rag per ml of penicillin and streptomycin. Equal amounts of PRI and C3Hss or C3H lymphocytes were mixed and cultivated in glass Petri dishes in a 37°C incubator maintained with 5% CO2. C57 black/6 and DBA/2 spleens were processed and cultivated in the same manner.
