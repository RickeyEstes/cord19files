30 Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are small, double-stranded DNA tumor viruses carried by diverse 31 vertebrates. PyVs have previously been considered highly host restricted in mammalian hosts, 32 with host-switching events thought rare or nonexistent. Prior investigations have revealed 33 short-range host-switching events of PyVs in two different African bat species within the 34 horseshoe bat genus Rhinolophus. Herein, we have conducted a systematic investigation of PyVs 35 in 1,083 archived bat samples collected from five provinces across China, and identified 192 36 PyVs from 186 bats from 15 host species within 6 families (Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae, 37 Hipposideridae, Emballonuridae, Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae) representing 28 38 newly-described PyVs, indicative of extensive genetic diversity of bat PyVs. Surprisingly, two 39 PyVs were identified in multiple bat species from different families, and another PyV clustered 40 phylogenetically with PyVs carried by bats from a different host family, indicative of three 41 inter-family PyV host-switching events. The time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 42 the three events was estimated at 0.02-11.6 million years ago (MYA), which is inconsistent with 43 the estimated tMRCA of their respective bat hosts (36.3-66.7 MYA), and is most parsimoniously 44 explained by host-switching events. PyVs identified from geographically separated Chinese 45 horseshoe bat species in the present study showed close genetic identities, and clustered with 46 each other and with PyVs from African horseshoe bats, allowing assessment of the effects of 47 positive selection in VP1 within the horseshoe bat family Rhinolophidae. Correlation analysis 48 indicated that co-evolution with their hosts contributed much more to evolutionary divergence of 49 PyV than geographic distance.

In this 56 study, we have identified multiple cases of host-switching events of PyVs by large scale 57 surveillance in diverse bat species collected in China. These host-switching events occurred 58 between bat families living in the same colony, indicating that a large population with frequent 59 contacts between different bat species may represent an ecological niche facilitating PyV 60 host-switching. The cases studied involved members of bats from several families, including 61 horseshoe bats, which were previously found to harbor a number of highly virulent viruses to 62 both humans and domestic animals. Our findings have provided evidence that even highly 63 host-specific DNA viruses can transmit between bats of different species and indicate an 64 increased propensity for spillover events involving horseshoe bats. We propose an evolutionary 65 scheme for bat-borne PyVs in which intra-host divergence and host-switching has generated the 66 diverse PyVs in present day bats. This scheme provides a useful model to study the evolution of 67 PyVs in other hosts and, potentially, the modeling of bat zoonoses and the transmission of other 68 DNA viruses in other mammals, including humans. 69 .

These diverse mammals harbor numerous highly virulent 73 viral pathogens, including rabies virus [2], Marburg virus [3], Ebola virus [4], Nipah virus [5], 74 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronavirus [6-8] and the newly identified 75 swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus [9]. Spillover of viruses from bats to humans or 76 domestic animals can give rise to outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases [10]. 77 Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are non-enveloped icosahedral DNA viruses containing a circular and 78 highly stable double-stranded DNA genome [11, 12]. PyVs can induce neoplastic transformation 79 in cell culture [12], and are associated with malignancy in humans [13, 14] and raccoons [15]. 80 Currently, 98 species carried by various mammals, birds and fish are recognized within the 81 family Polyomaviridae by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and 82 classified into four separate genera (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-and Deltapolyomavirus) with nine 83 floating species [16]. Recent identification of diverse PyV-like sequences in different fish species 84 [17] and invertebrates (including arachnids and insects) has revealed a deep co-evolutionary 85 history of PyVs with their metazoan hosts [17]. PyVs are highly host-specific in different 86 mammalian species, and long-range host jumps leading to productive infection and transmission 87 within mammalian genera are considered rare or nonexistent [17, 18]. Recently, an intra-host 88 divergence model with contributions from viral lineage duplication, recombination and, 89 potentially, host-switching at evolutionary timescales has been proposed to explain the extant 90 diversity based on the available genetic data [17]. .

These studies identified significant diversity 94 and high positive rates (10-20 %) using PCR-based approaches [27]. PyVs with complete or 95 partial genomes has also been identified by metagenomic analyses in bats collected in China and 96 recently from Saudi Arabia [28-30]. Investigation of PyVs in African insectivorous and 97 frugivorous bats [25, 26] has revealed evidence for short-range host-switching events of PyVs in 98 horseshoe bats (family Rhinolophidae, genus Rhinolophus) following identification of nearly 99 identical viruses (99.9% at the genomic level) in Rh. blasii and Rh. simulator [26]. 100 In the present study, we have characterized the diversity and genetic relationships of novel 101 PyVs from a large number of insectivorous and frugivorous bat samples collected in diverse 102 ecological environments in China, resulting in the identification of inter-family host-switching 103 events in these bat-borne PyVs. The findings challenge the prevailing paradigm of intra-host PyV 104 diversification in their mammalian hosts and extend the knowledge of PyV genetic diversity, 105 evolution, host restriction and host-switching.
