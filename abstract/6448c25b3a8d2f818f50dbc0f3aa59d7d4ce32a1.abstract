Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common infection for which antibiotics are prescribed in children, resulting in more than 20 million antibiotic prescriptions annually. New practice guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians [1] call for the judicious use of antibiotics in view of increasing antibiotic resistance and the unclear necessity of the use of antibiotics in children with uncomplicated AOM. These guidelines are reviewed below. In addition, this article reviews several other common ear, nose, and throat (ENT) entities, including sinusitis and dental emergencies, and current strategies in diagnosing and treating these conditions. Otitis externa is an inflammation of the external auditory canal and external surface of the tympanic membrane, which can be caused by a variety of conditions that compromise the lining of the canal. The ear canal is lined with squamous epithelial cells and cerumen glands that provide a lipid protective barrier [2] . When the skin of the ear canal is exposed to water for long periods, it becomes macerated and desquamates, causing the development of microfissures. The protective cerumen is washed away and the pH level of the ear canal changes [3] . Otitis externa is, therefore, seen frequently in swimmers, hot and humid climates, and in conditions that lead to water retention in the ear such as pro-0031-3955/06/$ -see front matter D
