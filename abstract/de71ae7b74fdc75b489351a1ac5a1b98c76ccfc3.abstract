Quantitative structure-activity relationship Multivariate adaptive regression splines Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system a b s t r a c t In this work, the inhibitory activity of pyridine N-oxide derivatives against human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is predicted in terms of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. These models were developed with the aid of multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) combined with shuffling cross-validation technique. A shuffling MARS algorithm is utilized to select the most important variables in QSAR modeling and then these variables were used as inputs of ANFIS to predict SARS inhibitory activities of pyridine N-oxide derivatives. A data set of 119 drug-like compounds was coded with over hundred calculated meaningful molecular descriptors. The best descriptors describing the inhibition mechanism were solvation connectivity index, length to breadth ratio, relative negative charge, harmonic oscillator of aromatic index, average molecular weight and total path count. These parameters are among topological, electronic, geometric, constitutional and aromaticity descriptors. The statistical parameters of R 2 and root mean square error (RMSE) are 0.884 and 0.359, respectively. The accuracy and robustness of shuffling MARS-ANFIS model in predicting inhibition behavior of pyridine N-oxide derivatives (pIC 50 ) was illustrated using leave-oneout and leave-multiple-out cross-validation techniques and also by Y-randomization. Comparison of the results of the proposed model with those of GA-PLS-ANFIS shows that the shuffling MARS-ANFIS model is superior and can be considered as a tool for predicting the inhibitory behavior of SARS drug-like molecules.

Recently, a total of 119 compounds that all belong to the class of the pyridine N-oxide derivatives with good inhibitory concentration has been reported against . To find and design new compounds with enhanced inhibitory activity, a systematic study of the different substituents on the activity of the analogues is needed. On the other hand, the growth of computational techniques has accelerated the drug design process. Many databases of inhibitors exist that have yet to be evaluated against SARS. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) has been demonstrated as a capable tool for the investigation of bioactivity of various classes of compounds [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Experimental evaluation of inhibitory activity of newly designed compounds is time-consuming and expensive; as a result, it is of interest to develop a method for the prediction of biological activity before the synthesis. QSAR searches information relating chemical structure to biological activity by developing a mathematical model. Building of a QSAR model begins with calculating theoretical parameters or selecting structural features for the compounds involved. Nowadays, hundreds of descriptors could be generated in QSAR studies, but only some of them are statistically significant in terms of correlation with biological activity for a particular analy-0731-7085/$ -see front matter
