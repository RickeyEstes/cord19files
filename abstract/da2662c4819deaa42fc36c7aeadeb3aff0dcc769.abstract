What is already known about this topic? Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) is a tool that can be used to diagnose asthma and to predict a positive response to inhaled steroid therapy, and can help measure adherence with inhaled steroid therapy in patients with chronic asthma. Unfortunately, its utility in the management of acute asthma has not been widely studied. What does this article add to our knowledge? This study found that in children with an acute asthma exacerbation, FENO levels are elevated compared with baseline levels. In addition, FENO levels rise to a greater extent in children who do not have a viral-induced asthma exacerbation, suggesting that eosinophilic inflammation plays more of a role in noneviralinduced asthma exacerbations. Last, prednisone was effective in reducing FENO levels to their baseline state, with the biggest reduction seen in those with viral infections. How does this study impact current management guidelines? This study suggests that FENO is a useful marker of inflammation during an acute asthma exacerbation and that prednisone therapy improves lung function and normalizes FENO levels in children with acute asthma regardless of the underlying cause of their exacerbation. BACKGROUND: Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) level is used as an aid in the diagnosis and management of chronic asthma. Its role in acute asthma remains to be studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether FENO levels are elevated in children with asthma exacerbations compared with baseline, and whether there is a difference in FENO levels based on PCR
