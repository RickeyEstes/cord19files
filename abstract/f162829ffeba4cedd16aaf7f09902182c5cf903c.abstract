Understanding the causes of the cost is considered the Holy Grail in the antibiotic resistance field, as it is the main determinant of the prevalence of resistances upon reducing antibiotics use. We show that DNA breaks can explain most of the variation in the cost of resistances common in pathogens. Here we demonstrate that targeting the RNase that degrades R-loops, which cause DNA breaks, exacerbates the cost of resistance. Consequently, lack of RNase HI function drives resistant clones to extinction in populations with high initial frequency of resistance, both in laboratory conditions and in a mouse model of gut colonization. Thus, RNase HI provides a target specific against resistant bacteria, which we validate using a repurposed drug. In summary, we revealed key mechanisms underlying the cost of antibiotic resistance that can be exploited to specifically eliminate resistant bacteria. Antibiotic resistance entails a large health and economic burden worldwide (1). Its maintenance and spread in bacterial populations depend on the rate at which resistance is acquired and on its effect on bacterial fitness. This effect is typically deleterious, resulting in the so-called cost of resistance. The cost of resistance is influenced by the environment, by interactions between the resistances and the genetic background in which they appear (epistasis), and by subsequent acquisition of mutations compensating for fitness defects (compensatory evolution) (2). Importantly, the magnitude of the cost is the main biological parameter influencing the fate of resistances upon reducing antibiotic use (3). Despite its importance, the causes of the cost are far from being completely understood (4), and the identification of these causes has become the "Holy Grail" in the antibiotic resistance field. Resistance mutations often map to genes encoding proteins targeted by antibiotics. These target proteins are typically involved in essential functions, such as transcription, translation, DNA replication or cell wall biosynthesis. Resistance mutations cause alterations in the structure of the target protein, rendering it insensitive to the drug, but often adversely affecting its function (2,3,5). These pleiotropic effects hold the key to manipulating resistance levels in bacterial populations (3). Rifampicin and streptomycin resistance mutations (Rif R and Str R ), common in pathogenic bacteria (6-8), map to the genes rpoB and rpsL, encoding the β' subunit of the RNA polymerase and the protein S12 of the 30S ribosomal subunit, respectively. Rif R and Str R mutations are representative examples of resistances to antibiotics targeting transcription and translation, respectively. Rif R mutations show different costs (9,10) and cause alterations in the rates of transcription initiation, elongation, slippage or termination (9,11-23). Likewise, most Str R mutations also cause a cost (24-26) and affect translation fidelity and processivity (24, (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) . Thus, at present, the costs of Rif R and Str R mutations are thought to be caused by defects in protein synthesis, either at a global cellular level (35-37) or limited to specific functions or regulons (22, 24, 38, 39) . We recently showed that the fitness cost of double resistance (Rif R Str R ) can be reduced via overexpression of nusG or nusE (40), which encode the proteins that physically connect the RNA polymerase and the ribosome (41). This suggests that the reduction of the cost can be achieved by reinforcing the coupling between transcription and translation, besides the previously described partial recovery in protein biosynthesis (3). Coupling between transcription and translation is known to prevent spontaneous backtracking of the RNA polymerase which, if exacerbated, can cause a series of molecular events that ultimately lead to the generation of double-strand DNA breaks (42)(43) (44) (45) (46) . This led us to hypothesize that cells carrying different Rif R and Str R mutations have higher number of DNA breaks, which greatly contribute to their cost. In this study, we show that DNA breaks caused by resistance mutations are major contributors to their fitness cost, explaining 73% of its variation across resistant genotypes. The involvement of Rloops in the generation of DNA breaks allowed us to identify RNase HI as an important determinant of the cost of resistance, which we validate using a repurposed drug. We further show that targeting RNase HI is a plausible strategy for the selective elimination of resistant bacteria, as lack of RNase HI leads to extinction of resistant clones when competing against sensitive bacteria in laboratory conditions, abolishing compensatory evolution. Importantly, eradication of resistant bacteria lacking RNase HI is remarkably efficient in the mammalian gut as well. Altogether, we reveal an unexpected cause of the cost of antibiotic resistance, which can be exploited to selectively eliminate resistant bacteria in polymorphic populations.

We carried out these assays in sensitive Escherichia coli, Str R strains (RpsL K43N , RpsL K43T , and RpsL K43R ), Rif R strains (RpoB H526L , RpoB H526Y , and RpoB S531F ), and double resistant mutants carrying the nine possible combinations of these resistance alleles. Remarkably, fourteen out of the fifteen resistant strains show increased SOS activation ( Figure 1A ), demonstrating that resistance mutations indeed cause DNA breaks. Moreover, the SOS induction strongly correlates with the cost of resistance, explaining 73% of its variation ( Figure 1B) , suggesting that DNA breaks are key contributors to the cost of resistance. To independently confirm the occurrence of DNA breaks in resistant bacteria, we used a system which permits direct visualization of double-stranded DNA ends by fluorescence microscopy (49). We combined this system with the SOS reporter, and analyzed a subset of resistant mutants and sensitive bacteria. As expected, this corroborated that resistance mutations indeed cause increased number of DNA breaks (Table 1, Figure S1 ). We then asked if resistance mutations involving a different mechanism which could lead to perturbations of transcription-translation coupling also generate DNA breaks. The commonly used antibiotic erythromycin targets the 50S ribosomal subunit, affecting translation and its coupling with transcription (50). Erythromycin resistance mutations (Erm R ) mapping to the genes rplD and rplV (encoding the 50S ribosomal subunit proteins L4 and L22, respectively) are known to reduce translation elongation rate (51,52), likely affecting transcription-translation coupling. We isolated Erm R clones carrying either RplD G66R or RplV Δ(82-84) mutations and found that both mutants show fitness cost and increased SOS ( Figure 1C ), demonstrating that other resistance mutations, with a 99 double orbital shaking (set as "fast") in a Biotek SYNERGY H1 benchtop microplate reader, measuring OD600 every 30 minutes during 24h. Adult C57BL/6J female mice (six to eight weeks old) were kept in ventilated cages under specified pathogen free (SPF) barrier conditions at the animal facility of the IGC. To overcome bacterial colonization resistance, mice were treated with streptomycin (5 g/L) in drinking water during seven days and then put on regular autoclaved water for two days to wash out the antibiotic from the intestine. The following day, animals were deprived of food and water during the 4 hours prior to inoculation by oral gavage of 100 µl of bacterial suspension containing ~10 9 cells. All animals were then individually-caged, with food and water being available ad libitum. Each animal (6 per group) was gavaged with a mix (9:1) of CFP-tagged sensitive (either WT or ΔrnhA) and YFP-labeled double resistant bacteria (either RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y or ΔrnhA RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y ). In order to obtain the bacterial suspensions, the strains were streaked individually onto appropriate antibiotic-supplemented LB agar plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. The next day, three independent colonies from each strain were inoculated separately in assay tubes containing 5ml of BHI broth supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic and bacterial cultures were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking (240 r.p.m). The next day, each bacterial culture was diluted 100-fold (20 µl of overnight culture in 2 ml of fresh BHI broth, in 125 ml flasks) and incubated at 37°C with shaking (240 r.p.m) until reaching an OD600 ≈ 2. Then the cultures were washed once with 1X PBS and Flow cytometry was used to assess the appropriate cells numbers and prepare bacterial mixes for gavage. Mouse fecal pellets were collected at 8 hours after gavage, and afterwards on a daily basis during 13 days, to analyze the loads and frequency of each strain colonizing the gut along time. Fecal samples were stored in 15% glycerol at -80°C. In order to measure the loads (CFUs/g of feces) and the frequency of each strain along the experiment,
