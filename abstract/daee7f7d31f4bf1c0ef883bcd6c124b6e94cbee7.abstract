McCrate -S2 Additional parameters for non-standard bases were incorporated in the Cornell et al. forcefield (1). Partial atomic charges were calculated for ms 2 t 6 A, mcm 5 s 2 U and ψ ( Figure S1 ), derived by fitting Hartree-Fock (2) restricted electrostatic potentials (RESP) (3) using the 6-31G* basis set (4-6) and normalizing the charges to have the same net charge as the corresponding unmodified base adenine or uridine. All electronic structure calculations were carried out using Gaussian 03M, Revision A.6 (7). Atom types were chosen from those already present in the Cornell et al. (1) or Generalized AMBER (8) Force Field ( Figure S2 ). In a few cases, additional force constants were assigned (Table S1 ). However, since similar connectivities were already present in the forcefield, the force constants for those connectivities were employed. All-atom root mean square deviations (RMSD) from starting structures were found to fluctuate around constant values ( Figure S3 ). Convergence of helical parameters was monitored over the 4.0 ns production run for all simulations. The moving averages of the average value over the duplex region for three helical parameters base-pair twist, base-pair inclination and xdisplacement form the global axis are shown in Figures S4-S6 . McCrate -S3 Hydrogen bonding data for water to ψ39 are presented in Table S2 . The water molecules bridged between A38 O2P, ψ39 NH3, and ψ39 O1P in a classic configuration. However, sometimes the water molecule oscillated back and forth between A38 O2P and O1P while maintaining a constant hydrogen bond to ψ39 NH3. Residence lifetimes of water molecules are also present in Table S2 .
