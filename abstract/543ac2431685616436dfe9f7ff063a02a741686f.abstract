Background: Acute diarrhea is a common clinical presentation of dogs. The effect of specific anti-diarrheal probiotic pastes (ADPPs) in the management of acute, uncomplicated diarrhea in dogs is unknown. Hypothesis: Administration of an ADPP containing Enterococcus faecium 4b1707 will improve the clinical outcome of acute, uncomplicated diarrhea in dogs compared to placebo. Animals: One hundred forty-eight client-owned dogs with acute diarrhea as the main clinical sign. Methods: Double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, blocked, multicenter clinical field study conducted at 14 primary care veterinary practices in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The ADPP was associated with better clinical outcome compared to placebo in dogs with acute, uncomplicated diarrhea. Dogs in the ADPP group had a significantly shorter duration of diarrhea (ADPP: median, 32 hours; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2-118; n = 51; Placebo: median, 47 hours; 95% CI, 4-167; n = 58; P = .008) and the rate of resolution of diarrhea was 1.60 times faster in the ADPP group than in the Placebo group (ratio, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.08-2.44; P = .02). Fewer dogs required additional medical intervention (AMI) for non-improvement or worsening in the ADPP group compared to the Placebo group (3.5% of dogs and 14.8% of dogs, respectively), with a relative risk of 0.88 (P = .04; AMI, ADPP, 3.5%, 2/57 dogs; Placebo, 14.8%, 9/61 dogs; relative risk, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77-0.99). Conclusion and Clinical Importance: The ADPP may accelerate resolution of acute diarrhea in dogs and decrease the requirement for AMI. K E Y W O R D S
