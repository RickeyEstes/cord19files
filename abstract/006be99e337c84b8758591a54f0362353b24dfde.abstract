253 protein, C-reactive protein (CRPt), varies markedly under differing physiologic conditions (47). CRP, a homopentamer composed of nonglycosylated 24-kD subunits associated by noncovalent forces (24, 29), is a plasma protein whose rate of synthesis by the hepatocyte increases by several hundredfold or more during the systemic acute phase response to tissue injury (39). In studies of the synthesis and secretion of CRP by rabbit primary hepatocyte cultures prepared from animals stimulated in vivo to undergo the acute phase response, the half-time for secretion of newly synthesized CRP was found to decrease markedly from as much as 18 h in control hepatocytes to as little as 75 min in cells from acute phase animals (47), while the kinetics of albumin secretion determined in the same cultures, were rapid (half-time of 30-45 min) and did not vary during the acute phase response. Results of studies in which a fusion gene consisting of the rabbit CRP gene linked to the mouse metallothionein promoter was transfected into HeLa cells (29) indicated that the default rate of rabbit CRP secretion was rapid and suggested that changes in its transit time were due to its specific retention within unstimulated rabbit hepatocytes, rather than to facilitated export in cells from stimulated animals. However, CRP does not contain carboxy-terminal sequences reported to result in ER retention (29). Further, assembly of CRP does not appear to be rate-limiting, since in control as well as stimulated cells >90% of antigenically detectable CRP labeled in a 10-min pulse is pentameric as judged by its size on gel filtration, its differential reactivity with structure-specific antibodies, and its ability to bind phosphocholine (29, 46, 47, and our unpublished observations). In the present report, pulse-chase subcellular fractionation experiments identify the ER as the compartment in which CRP is retained. Both biochemical and immunohistochemical methods demonstrate specific binding of CRP to the lumenal face of detergent-permeabilized rough microsomes, but not to Golgi subfractions. Kinetic and equilibrium binding studies identify a high affinity CRP binding site which is present in hepatic rough microsomes from normal rabbits, but is not detected in microsomes from animals undergoing the acute phase response. Finally, nitrocellulose blots probed with radiolabeled CRP demonstrate a 60-kD band, distinct from BiP, which is detected in extracts of control rough microsomes, but not in Golgi fractions or rough microsomes from stimulated animals. Together, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that CRP is specifically retained within the ER by a novel mechanism which is downregulated during the acute phase response.
