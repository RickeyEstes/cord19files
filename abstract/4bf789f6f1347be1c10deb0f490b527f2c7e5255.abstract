582 saccharopine sallimus satellite virus A term used in plant virology for a virus associated functionally, at least for the purpose of its own replication, with another virus. saturated fatty acids Fatty acids without double bonds. In eukaryotic membranes mostly stearic, palmitic and myristic acids, linear aliphatic chains with no double bonds. Prokaryotes have numerous branched-chain saturated fatty acids. saturation The state in which all receptors or binding sites are effectively occupied all the time, can be said to occur in a simple binding equilibrium when the concentration of ligand is more than five times the K d value, although strictly it will only be true at infinite ligand concentration. 585 sarcolipin saturation scanning tunnelling microscopy SCG10 gene scotophobin SDH segment long-spacing collagen selenoprotein
