Clinical progression over time and cytokine profiles have not been well defined in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. We included 17 patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV during the 2015 outbreak in Korea. Clinical and laboratory parameters were collected prospectively. Serum cytokine and chemokine levels in serial serum samples were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All patients presented with fever. The median time to defervescence was 18 days. Nine patients required oxygen supplementation and classified into severe group. In the severe group, chest infiltrates suddenly began to worsen around day 7 of illness, and dyspnea developed at the end of the first week and became apparent in the second week. Median time from symptom onset to oxygen supplementation was 8 days. The severe group had higher neutrophil counts during week 1 than the mild group (4,500 vs. 2,200/µL, P = 0.026). In the second week of illness, the severe group had higher serum levels of IL-6 (54 vs. 4 pg/mL, P = 0.006) and CXCL-10 (2,642 vs. 382 pg/mL, P < 0.001). IFN-α response was not observed in mild cases. Our data shows that clinical condition may suddenly deteriorate around 7 days of illness and the serum levels of IL-6 and CXCL-10 was significantly elevated in MERS-CoV patients who developed severe diseases. During the outbreak of MERS-CoV in Korea, all laboratory-confirmed cases were admitted to the government-designated hospitals regardless of their severity of illness. They were discharged from the hospitals when two consecutive daily real-time reverse transcription (rRT)-PCR were all negative after 48 hours of the resolution of all clinical symptoms. The laboratory diagnosis was made by WHO guideline (12). We included all patients admitted to three Seoul National University (SNU) affiliated hospitals (SNU Hospital, SNU Bundang Hospital, and SNU Boramae Medical Center). We excluded those patients who were admitted 14 days after symptom onset. These patients were the same as those of our studies reported previously (10,11). Board certified infectious disease specialists in each hospital prospectively documented clinical symptoms, physical examinations, and laboratory values using standardized case recording form. For the patients who were transferred from other hospitals, the medical records and chest radiographs of the patients at the hospital were also reviewed. Serum samples were collect-ed at serial interval and stored at -70°C. The patients were categorized into severe or mild group depending upon oxygen supplementation requirements. The severe group required oxygen supplementation to maintain arterial saturation above 90%.
