A 45-year-old male had a history of heavy smoking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, a history of atrophied right kidney, and ischemic heart disease. He presented with a 3-day complaint of fever of 38 C and a cough that had become productive. A chest film was unremarkable, and he was discharged home. The following day, he visited the hospital's emergency room with the same complaints. The oxygen saturation on room air and chest film was normal, and he was discharged home on oral cefuroxime. Two days later, he returned to the emergency room with worsening dyspnea and required continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to maintain oxygenation. Chest film revealed patchy infiltrates in his right lower lobe. Treatment with parenteral ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and oral oseltamivir were commenced after specimens were collected for diagnostic testing. He became progressively more hypoxic over the next 24 hours. Chest film revealed patchy infiltrates in his right lower lobe. Routine bacteriology, acid-fast bacillus smears, and screening influenza exams were negative. He further deteriorated and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Antibiotics were changed to piperacillin-tazobactam plus linezolid; treatment with corticosteroids was initiated. Immunofluorescent staining of respiratory epithelial cells for influenza A, B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza 1-3, and adenovirus were negative, and he was confirmed to be seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Q fever, and Brucella. Upper tract swabs in viral transport media were forwarded to the Saudi Ministry of Health regional 185 Emerging Infectious Diseases.
