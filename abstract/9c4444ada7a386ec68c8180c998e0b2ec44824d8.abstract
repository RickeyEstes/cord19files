increasing research has demonstrated that expression of brain and muscle arnT-like 1 (BMal1) and other circadian clock genes can be regulated by drugs and toxicants. We previously demonstrated that icariin, extracted from Herba epimedii, sromotes osteogenic differentiation. However, the mechanism underlying the association between icariin and BMal1 in osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMScs) remains unclear. The present study was designed with an aim to clarify the association between icariin and BMal1 in osteogenic differentiation of BMScs. The cell counting Kit-8 assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation. The expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), runX family transcription factor 2 (runX2), alkaline phosphatase (alP), osteocalcin (oc) and BMal1 in BMScs was evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative Pcr and western blotting. alP and alizarin red S (arS) staining were also performed. icariin promoted BMSc proliferation, and upregulated expression of osteogenic genes and BMal1. in addition, expression of the osteogenic genes BMP2, runX2, alP and oc were upregulated by BMal1 overexpression. Furthermore, we confirmed that BMal1 deficiency suppressed osteogenic differentiation in BMScs. Finally, arS staining of BMal1 -/-BMScs revealed that BMal1 was an essential intermediary in matrix mineralization during osteogenic differentiation. in conclusion, these results demonstrated that icariin promoted osteogenic differentiation through BMal1-BMP2 signaling in BMScs. The present study thus described a novel target of icariin that has potential applications in the treatment of osteogenic disorders.
