Introduction: Next to the clinical important Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) Nontuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) are pathogens especially in immunocompromised and senior people. Species identification is important for diagnosis and optimal treatment. MALDI-TOF identification of some Mycobacterium strains is hampered by low quality of acquired mass spectra from samples processed by standard procedures. Therefore, a new preparation method for Mycobacteria was established and influence of an additional preceding heat inactivation step was evaluated. Methods: 14 Mycobacterium strains were prepared using standard ethanol/formic acid extraction procedure. The new established Mycobacteria bead preparation protocol was tested with these 14 and additional 22 strains. An extended protocol named inactivated Mycobacteria bead preparation method was tested with 10 strains. Mass spectra were recorded in a microflex LT MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer and identification was done applying MALDI Biotyper 3.0 software (Bruker Daltonik, Germany). Results: Out of 83 Mycobacterium spp. strains tested (data not shown) 14 strains were hard to analyse by MALDI-TOF and therefore selected for this study. Consequently, standard ethanol/formic acid extraction procedure failed to acquire mass spectra from 12 strains. A significant improvement of quality of mass spectra was achieved by using Mycobacteria bead preparation method with glass beads for cell suspension and disruption. Now, 11 out of 14 Mycobacterium strains resulted in good quality mass spectra and three ones in average quality. In addition, 22 further Mycobacterium strains were processed according to this new protocol and all resulted in good quality spectra. An additional heat inactivation step was introduced for safety reasons. Mass spectra of 10 Mycobacterium spp. strains processed by Mycobacteria bead preparation method with and without heat inactivation step were compared. Mass spectra revealed only minor differences, just higher peak intensities were obtained in general with the heat inactivation procedure. Conclusion: A fast, secure and easy to perform method was developed for mycobacterial protein extraction. These extracts are highly accessible to MALDI-TOF analysis and good quality mass spectra are a precondition for identification of Mycobacteria by this technique. The new preparation method was successfully tested for 36 different strains representing 30 species. A supplemental heat inactivation step was introduced for minimizing hazards by handling living MTC cells. The main mechanism of bacterial resistance against ß-lactam antibiotics is the expression/overexpression of ß-lactamases which destroy the ß-lactam ring of ß-lactam antibiotics by hydrolysis. This reaction results in a mass shift of plus 18 Da easily detectable by mass spectrometry. A rapid MALDI-TOF MS based assay was set up to detect ß-lactam resistance of bacteria from blood cultures. Methods: Blood culture bottles were inoculated with different E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia strains and incubated at 37°C until they were indicated as positive. Subsequently, 1 ml fresh positive blood culture was processed according to a slightly modified protocol of the MALDI Sepsityper kit. The washing step was repeated once and subsequently bacteria were incubated with the corresponding antibiotics solution for 3 h at 37°C under agitation. Ampicillin was tested with the E. coli strains. Ertapenem was tested with the Klebsiella pneumonia strains. After incubation of the bacteria with the corresponding antibiotics and subsequent centrifugation, the supernatant was directly applied to a MALDI sample carrier. Dried spots were overlaid with MALDI matrix (HCCA). MALDI-TOF MS spectra were acquired on a microflex LT benchtop mass spectrometer. Inhibition of hydrolysis was performed in the presence respective ß-lactamase inhibitors. Results: The MS spectrum corresponding to DH5alpha revealed the molecular peak of Ampicillin (350 Da) and the respective sodium adducts. The spectra derived from the ß-lactamase producing strains show peaks at 368, 394, 412 and 324 Da corresponding to the hydrolyzed form, its sodium adducts and the hydrolyzed, decarboxylated form of ampicillin, respectively. A slight spontaneous hydrolysis was also observed in the spectra of DH5alpha. Successful inhibition of Ampicillin hydrolysis was demonstrated by incubation in the presence of calvulanic acid. Incubation of Ertapenem with Klebsiella pneumonia strains revealed a clear difference between the carbapenem sensitive strain and carbapenamase positive strains. For the carbapenem sensitive strain the molecular peak of Ertapenem [M+H] + at 476 Da was clearly detectable. Incubation of Ertapenem with the carbapenemase positive strains resulted in the disappearance of the molecular peak of Ertapenem. In contrast to Ampicillin, the hydrolyzed form of Ertapenem was very instable and immediately broke down further. Therefore, only the decrease of the molecular peak of Ertapenem can be employed as indicator for resistance against carbapenems at the moment. Additional peaks appear in the spectra of the carbapenemase positive strains but these do not directly correspond to the hydrolyzed form of Ertapenem and have not been identified so far. Discussion: The developed approach provides a rapid method for the detection of beta-lactamase activity of bacteria within less than 4 h from positive blood cultures. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the genotype distribution of S. maltophilia isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) by repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) using DiversiLab System. Methods: Sputum samples (n=623) from 165 CF patients were inoculated onto a selective medium for improved isolation of S. maltophilia over a period of two years. Suspected isolates were identified by conventional standardized methods, as well as by sequencing. A total of 65 S. maltophilia isolates from 33 CF patients were detected. For genotyping, DNA extraction was performed with the UltraCleanTM microbial DNA isolation kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacture´s instructions. DiversiLab bacterial DNA fingerprinting kit (bioMérieux, Marcy I´Etoile, France) was used for typing following the protocol of the manufacturer. The relatedness was determined by cluster analysis using Pearson´s Correlation coefficient. Isolates with a similarity of 95% were considered as clinical related, and isolates with a similarity >98% were considered as indistinguishable. Results: Rep-PCR demonstrated that S. maltophilia isolates from CF patients exhibited a high rate of genetic diversity. A small proportion of isolates were clonally related (12%), suggesting either cross-transmissions or a common source of exposure. Conclusions: S. maltophilia from CF patients showed a wide variation of the molecular profiles. Further epidemiological studies such as source tracking are required to elucidate the route of colonization/infection in CF patients. The objective of this study was to determine whether photochemical inactivation of viruses could be accomplished with high efficiency while preserving the molecular integrity of viral targets allowing subsequent diagnostic tests to be performed at a lower level of containment and cost. We studied the effect of either 5-Iodonaphthyl 1-azide (INA) and amotosalen (AMO, also known as S-59), that are known to target either viral proteins or viral nucleic acids. We found that Vaccinia virus (VacV), an orthopox virus with a DNA genome, and Pixuna virus (PIXV), an alphavirus with an RNA genome, were stable when irradiated with UVA alone or when exposed to either INA or AMO in the dark. AMO followed by UVA exposure was at least one-thousand-fold more virucidal than INA/UVA on VacV and on PIXV treated under similar conditions. Photoinactivation with either INA or AMO at conditions that abolished viral infectivity resulted only in minimal impairment of subsequent ELISA and PCR testing. The presented data could assist in developing methods to inactivate in the field environmental and forensic samples suspected of contamination with high virulence virus, thus limiting the need for costly security and safety operations after an accidental or intentional viral release. The systemic symptoms of diphtheria are caused by the tox-encoded diphtheria toxin (DT) which is produced by toxigenic Corynebacterium spp. In recent years, the emerging zoonotic pathogen C. ulcerans has replaced C. diphtheriae as the major agent for diphtheria in several industrialized Western countries. The reliable detection of toxigenic Corynebacterium spp. is substantial for both diphtheria surveillance in the public health sector and the clinical work-up of a patient with diphtherialike symptoms. Since the respective tox genes of C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans differ in both DNA and amino acid sequence from each other, both tox genes should be covered by novel real-time PCR methods. We describe the development and validation of a LightCycler PCR assay which reliably recognizes tox genes from both C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans and differentiates the respective target genes by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) hybridization probe melting curve analysis. Background: Detection of Enterobacteriaceae carrying carbapenemases is challenging since the MIC can be in the susceptible range and because differentiation between carbapenem resistance due to carbapenemases or other mechanisms is not possible by routine susceptible testing. Methods: Enterobacteriaceae with elevated carbapenem MICs were sent to the German National Reference Laboratory for multidrug-resistant gramnegative bacteria. For this study 80 strains were used, for which carbapenemases were excluded by a bioassay based on cell-free extracts and up to 15 specific PCRs. In addition, 80 strains with carbapenemases characterized by sequencing were studied. In all strains the MIC for carbapenems was determined by Etest, the modified Hodge-Test (MHT) was performed on different media and combined disk tests with EDTA and boronic acid were performed. Results: The collection comprised K. pneumoniae (n = 82), E. coli (n = 24), E. cloacae (n = 23), E. aerogenes (n =12) and other Enterobacteriacea species. Strains with OXA-48 (n = 24), OXA-162 (n = 4), KPC-2 (n = 12), KPC-3 (n = 11), VIM-1 (n = 15), VIM-2 (n = 2), VIM-4 (n = 4), NDM-1 (n = 4) and GIM-1 (n = 3) were included.The sensitivity of the MHT on Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid) was 98.8%, 88.8% and 93.4% for imipenem,meropenem and ertapenem, respectively, whereas the specifity was 71.3%, 91.3% and 86.3%. For the subgroup of metallo-betalactamases (n = 27) the MHT was performed on four different agar media with the lowest sensitivity for the MHT with meropenem performed on MH agar by Merck (7.4%). Addition of 20 μl 50 mM zinc to the disk increased the sensitivity only to 30%. The sensitivity of the MBL Etest was 74.1%, whereas the combined disk test with EDTA had a sensitivity of 96.3%. Conclusions: In contrast to recommendations by CLSI the MHT should also be performed for imipenem. Despite a lower specifity the importance of carbapenemase detection justifies a higher sensitivity. Caution should be used in choosing the test media since huge differences in metallobetalactamase detection are seen. Due to a better sensitivity the combined disk test with EDTA should substitute the MBL Etest in Enterobacteriaceae. Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most common nosocomial infections worldwide. Standard procedures for the identification of uropathogens are based on the cultivation on agar plates and the subsequent biochemical differentiation (e.g. with VITEK™, API™ etc.) and often require more than one day so that the initial antibiotic treatment is non-specific for the species. We developed a protocol for a fast (< 30 min) direct identification of the species of pathogens in urine samples based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Methods: We analysed urine samples from inpatients sent to the Institute for Medical Microbiology for routine diagnostic. We separated the uropathogens from the sediment consisting of leucocytes, erythrocytes, cell detritus and protein cylinders by centrifugation and filtration protocols. The filter residue was then eluated and transferred onto the spot of a metal plate. After inactivation with 2.5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as organic matrix the protein spectra were acquired by a MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometer (Voyager-DE™ STR, AppliedBiosystems). For identification the spectra were compared with a database (SARAMIS™, AnagnosTec, now BioMérieux). The whole process was completed within 30 minutes. Results: Direct identification of uropathogens is already successful in > 60 %. In 90 % of the unidentifiable samples a very intense peak triplet occurs corresponding to the human alpha-defensins 1, 2, and 3 as interfering factor at m/z values of around 3440 Da. These proteins are produced naturally in the body and cannot be removed simply by washing the filter residue because they closely interact with the bacterial membrane. Therefore we have to improve our protocol for purification of the separated bacteria. In ticks different pathogens can be found that may cause serious infections in humans and domestic animals. For the reliable detection of these pathogens by PCR, isolation of nucleic acids is one of the most important prerequisites influencing the whole diagnostic procedure. Therefore an optimized protocol for DNA isolation from ticks is required. Since the question regarding optimal DNA extraction from ticks is only poorly addressed so far, the present study compared different methods for isolation of DNA from ticks. Material and Methods: Four different methods for the DNA extraction from field-collected, unfed ticks were compared. DNA-quantification in all experiments was done by 1) NanoDrop-spectrometer and 2) quantitative PCR measurement of tick beta-actin. In experiment 1 DNA was isolated from each 15 single homogenized nymphs per method: a) high-salt DNA isolation protocol (PeqLab, Germany) b) MagBeads DNA extraction protocol (Carl-Roth, Germany) c) column-based DNA extraction protocol (PeqLab, Germany) and d) a modified TriPure-isolation protocol (PeqLab, Germany). Experiments a-c were done according to the manufacturer's instructions. In experiment 2 the best DNA extraction method of experiment 1 was used for an additional enrichment of DNA. Again 15 single nymphs per treatment were used, each pre-treated e) with liquid nitrogen or f) without pre-treatment prior DNA isolation. These experimental runs were combined with different additional steps of proteinase K treatment prior to experiments e and f based on differences in the treatment duration. Finally the best method of experiment 2 was used for the DNA-isolation from adult ticks in comparison to the methods a-c. Results: In experiment 1 the highest DNA-yields were obtained by the modified TriPure DNA isolation protocol with up to 15 times higher DNAamount (p<0.001). In experiment 2 the pre-treatment with proteinase k overnight combined with an additional liquid nitrogen treatment showed the highest DNA recovery (p<0,03). Finally these findings were transferable to the DNA isolation results from adult ticks (p 0,001) ( fig. 1 ). Discussion: For the detection of different pathogens in ticks a reliable and repeatable method for the DNA-isolation is an important prerequisite. Our experiments clearly show a significant different performance of various DNA extraction methods when applied to ticks. Furthermore, modifications clearly enhanced the quantity of isolated DNA. Using this optimized method, studies with a new qualitative and quantitative PCR are on the way to measure the amount of borrelia in single ticks in Germany. -lactamases-producing (ESBL) Enterobacteriacea show resistance against various -lactam-antibiotics like penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam. As minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of these strains can be increased but below the standard CLSI-breakpoints, further confirmatory tests are required. This study compared ESBL-screenig results of MIC-determination, disk diffusion confirmatory test and growth onto a chromogenic ESBL-detection agar. Program 1378 E. coli from diseased food-delivering and companion animals were collected from 2006 to 2007. MIC determination by broth microdilution to -lactam-antibiotics (penicillin G, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, cefquinome, ceftiofur), and disk diffusion confirmatory test for ESBL (ceftazidine (30μg)/ ceftazidine-clavulanic acid (30μg/10μg) and cefotaxime (30μg)/ cefotaxime-clavulanic acid (30μg/10μg) were performed in accordance to CLSI document M31-A3. Brilliance ESBL ® chromogenic agar (Oxoid) was applied corresponding manufacturer's constructions. ESBL-suspicious strains were verified by detection of blaCTX-M-, blaOXA-, blaTEM-, and blaSHV-genes. Results: At broth microdilution testing, 49 E. coli (3.55%) exhibited MIC values of 2 mg/L for cefotaxime (=CLSI ESBL-screening concentration). Simultaneously performed disk diffusion test and screening onto chromogenic agar resulted in 27 (1.96%) and 26 (1.87%) ESBL-suspicious strains respectively. By PCR 26 ESBL-positive E. coli could be confirmed. All these strains were characterized by MIC values of 16 mg/L for cefotaxime, a 5mm increased zone diameter in disk diffusion ESBL confirmatory test and blue growth onto chromogenic ESBL-detection agar. Conclusions: Overall, disk diffusion ESBL confirmatory test as well as chromogenic ESBL-detection agar were suitable to detect ESBL-positive E. coli. Both tests showed a sensitivity of 100%. The chromogenic agar further resulted in a specifity of 100%, whereas by disk diffusion test one falsepositive strain was detected. However, use of disk diffusion tests is often more staff-and time-intensive. Background: Enterobacteriaceae resistant to carbapenems are a growing problem in an increasing number of countries worldwide. In Germany, carbapenemase resistance is still rare, but appears to be rising, and several hospital outbreaks have been described. As many infections with carbapenem resistant strains are acquired abroad, special precautions have to be undertaken to control infection and local spread. Rapid isolate typing is a cornerstone for infection control. Outbreak description and results: In our institution, no carbapenemase producing enterobacteriaceae have been isolated previously. In January, 2011, a Russian patient was admitted, and screening for multiresistant microorganisms revealed colonization with a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain of increased MIC for imipenem and meropenem. Carbapenemase production was demonstrated by modified Hodge Test and confirmed by genotyping for OXA-48 type carbapenemase. Subsequently, four additional patients were found to be colonized with K. pneumoniae strains of identical resistance patterns and later as OXA-48 producers. It is suspected that transmission occurred during the time span between admission and initiation of infection control measures on the index patient. Random PCR (RAPD) was attempted to prove clonal origin of the isolates, yet, in case of these K. pneumoniae isolates the method was not discriminative. As an alternative for rapid typing, MALDI-TOF spectra of isolates were compared yielding an excellent spectrum identity between outbreak strains and a good discrimination towards other unrelated isolates, yet, automated calculation of the dendrogram by the biotyper software was not applicable for intra-species differentiation. Results were subsequently confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Conclusion: In conjunction with or instead of other rapid typing methods (e.g. RAPD), the diagnostic use of MALDI-TOF spectra may be helpful for preliminary epidemiologic analysis of clinical outbreaks within few hours. The values and limitations of the method need to be further validated for different microorganisms by a standard procedure (e.g. PFGE, MLST), yet, ease of applicability and low running costs make mass spectra analysis a promising tool for first line clinical outbreaks analysis.
