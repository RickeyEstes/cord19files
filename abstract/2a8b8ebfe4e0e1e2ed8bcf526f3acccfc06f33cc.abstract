The distinguishing feature of public health research is its focus on assessing, measuring, and monitoring the health of populations; in contrast, traditional biomedical research focuses on studying disease and treatment for individual patients [1]. Compared with most medical specialties, emergency medicine (EM) is well positioned to bridge biomedical and public health approaches for preventing disease and injury and promoting health through population-based strategies targeted at the community [2]. In its strategically vital position at the boundary between the hospital and the surrounding community, the emergency department (ED) is actually the linchpin for multiple systems of care. When all systems are functioning, EM offers access for all patients 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, regardless of their ability to pay. EM provides triage and care for both mental and physical health conditions, and links patients with the most appropriate providers and care settings for their presenting conditions. EM identifies unmet health needs and interfaces with primary care, specialty care, inpatient, outpatient, and community-based social services. The ED also collects data used for surveillance of infectious diseases (eg, sexually transmitted infections, tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]) and environmental emergencies
