Epidemiologic estimates suggest an incidence of 200,000 patients annually for ALI/ARDS, 1,2 with a comparably large and growing incidence of sepsis. 3 The morbidity and mortality of these disease processes likewise are staggering. In-hospital death rates range from 26% to 38% in studies of ARDS, 1,2 whereas sepsis kills nearly one-half of those severely affected. 4 For patients who ultimately survive their initial hospitalization, quality of life often is dramatically reduced, and the economic impact is considerable. Sepsis, for instance, contributes nearly $17 billion toward the burgeoning costs of US critical care delivery. 5 From a pathophysiologic perspective, sepsis, ALI, and ARDS are all characterized by abnormally enhanced coagulation, dysregulated and often injurious host immunity, microvascular dysfunction, and tissue necrosis. Increasing evidence suggests that hematologic derangements are associated with and may be important contributors to disease severity, largely infl uenced by alterations in platelet and leukocyte function. 6 Although platelet-mediated thrombosis has been implicated in their pathobiology, a host of other platelet-associated effects can infl uence their natural history. Understanding the pluripotential impact of platelets in immunopathology and their specifi c role in the development and progression of Sepsis, acute lung injury, and ARDS contribute substantially to the expanding burden of critical illness within our ICUs. Each of these processes is characterized by a myriad of injurious events, including apoptosis, microvascular dysfunction, abnormal coagulation, and dysregulated host immunity. Only recently have platelets-long considered merely effectors of thrombosis-been implicated in infl ammatory conditions and the pathobiology of these disease processes. A growing body of evidence suggests a prominent role for maladaptive platelet activation and aggregation during sepsis and ARDS and has begun to underscore the pluripotential infl uence of platelets on outcomes in critical illness. Not only do platelets enhance vascular injury through thrombotic mechanisms but also appear to help orchestrate pathologic immune responses and are pivotal players in facilitating leukocyte recruitment to vulnerable tissue. These events contribute to the organ damage and poor patient outcomes that still plague the care of these high-risk individuals. An understanding of the role of platelets in critical illness also highlights the potential for both the development of risk stratifi cation schema and the use of novel, targeted therapies that might alter the natural history of sepsis, acute lung injury, and ARDS. Future studies of adenosine, platelet polyphosphates, and the platelet transcriptome/proteome also should add considerably to our ability to unravel the mysteries of the versatile platelet.
