Diarrhea is defined as the passage of an increased number of stools of less-than-normal form and consistency. Acute diarrhea refers to acute onset of symptoms of less than 14 to 30 days' duration. Diarrhea lasting longer than 1 month is considered chronic. The severity of acute diarrhea can be defined as mild, where no change in daily activities is noted; moderate, where a change in daily activities is required but the patient is able to function; and severe, where the patient is disabled by the symptoms. American adults average about one episode of acute diarrhea annually. Acute diarrhea is one of the most common medical conditions seen by primary care practitioners. In the United States, approximately 1 million hospital admissions and 6000 deaths per year are attributed to acute diarrhea, and in most, an etiology is not identified. Worldwide, diarrhea-related diseases are among the most common causes of morbidity and mortality and, for children younger than 4 years, the most common cause of death. Most cases of acute diarrhea are self-limited and require no medical evaluation. Nearly half of the cases last for less than 1 day. Evaluation should be reserved for patients with evidence of systemic toxicity (dehydration, bloody diarrhea, fever, severe abdominal pain), diarrhea of more than 48 hours' duration, and elderly or immunocompromised patients. Infectious dysentery, inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), and ischemic colitis. Dysentery is a disease process characterized by diarrhea that contains blood and polymorphonuclear cells. Dysentery results when an organism causes an inflammatory reaction, either by direct invasion of the colonic/ileal epithelium or by producing a toxin that causes cellular death and tissue damage. Symptoms associated with dysentery may include abdominal pain and cramping, tenesmus (painful urgency to evacuate stool), fever, and dehydration. 6. Name the common causes of infectious dysentery in the United States Campylobacter and Salmonella spp. are the principal causes of dysentery in the United States. Shigella sp. and certain strains of Escherichia coli (specifically O157:H7) are less common. Rarer causes include Yersinia, Entamoeba, Aeromonas, and Plesiomonas spp. 7. What is the significance of stool leukocytes (white blood cells) and how are they detected? The presence of fecal leukocytes helps to distinguish inflammatory from noninflammatory diarrhea. Normally, leukocytes are not present in stool. Fecal leukocytes are usually found in infectious diarrhea caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia spp.; Clostridium difficile; enterohemorrhagic and enteroinvasive strains of E. coli; and Aeromonas sp. In cases of ischemic colitis and inflammatory bowel disease, fecal leukocytes are the result of mucosal bleeding. Diarrhea secondary to toxigenic bacteria (e.g., enterotoxigenic E. coli [ETEC], Vibrio cholerae), viruses, and small bowel protozoa (e.g., Giardia sp.) do not contain stool leukocytes. The presence of white blood cells (WBCs) in the stool can be assayed by microscopic examination of the stool or by means of an immunoassay for the neutrophil marker lactoferrin. The sensitivity of fecal lactoferrin and microscopy for fecal WBCs is 92% and 72%, respectively. 8. If 100 random patients with acute diarrhea underwent evaluation with stool cultures, how many would be positive? Which patients with acute diarrhea should be evaluated with a stool culture? Published studies show the diagnostic yield of stool cultures to be 1.5% to 5.6%. This percentage range can be increased if tested patients are selected carefully. A stool culture should be obtained from patients with dysentery symptoms, persistent diarrhea (beyond 3 to 5 days) or from patients who are immunocompromised. Patients with dysentery symptoms are much more likely than the other two groups to have a positive stool culture. The rate of positive stool culture in patients hospitalized with dysentery is 40% to 60%. Generally, a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy is not needed for the evaluation of acute diarrhea. Most cases of acute diarrhea are self-limited, and endoscopic exam findings add usually little information to the history, physical exam, and stool tests. However, patients with prolonged symptoms or those suspected to have pseudomembranous colitis, ischemic colitis, or inflammatory bowel disease should be considered for endoscopic evaluation. The toxins produced by organisms can be classified into two categories: cytotonic and cytotoxic. Cytotonic toxins cause a watery diarrhea by activation of intracellular enzymes, which cause net fluid secretion into the intestinal lumen. Examples of cytotonic toxins include those produced by V. cholerae and enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli . Cytotoxic toxins cause structural injury to the intestinal mucosa, which, in turn, causes inflammation and mucosal bleeding. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli produces a cytotoxic toxin ( Shiga -like toxin). Campylobacter transmitted? C. jejuni accounts for 98% of reported Campylobacter isolates and is the most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in industrialized nations. The less common isolates are C. fetus and C. fecalis. Direct contact with fecal matter from infected persons or animals and ingestion of contaminated food or water have been implicated in the transmission of Campylobacter infection. Website
