. Intraocular coronavirus inoculation results in a biphasic retinal disease in susceptible mice BALBrc characterized by an acute Ž . inflammatory response, followed by retinal degeneration associated with autoimmune reactivity. Resistant mice CD-1 , when similarly Ž . inoculated, only develop the early phase of the disease. Blood-retinal barrier BRB breakdown occurs in the early phase in both strains, coincident with the onset of inflammation. As the inflammation subsides, the extent of retinal vascular leakage is decreased, indicating Ž . that BRB breakdown in experimental coronavirus retinopathy ECOR is primarily due to inflammation rather than to retinal cell Ž . Ž destruction. Vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF is upregulated only in susceptible mice during the secondary retinal . degeneration phase. q
