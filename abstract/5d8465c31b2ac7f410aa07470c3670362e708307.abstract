Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy wrote, "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." This so-called Anna Karenina Principle applies to supply-chain disruptions in that every disruption comes with its own roster of causes, its own cascade of effects, and its own litany of misery. More than two decades of research-culminating in two books: The Resilient Enterprise (Sheffi, 2005) and The Power of Resilience (Sheffi, 2015)-have traced the increasing numbers of ways that companies' supply chains can be unhappy. Factors such as rising global trade, a growing middle class in developing countries, outsourcing, and increasing product complexity have all contributed to an expanded geographic risk footprint of many companies. At the same time, rising global competition, lean manufacturing, natural resource constraints, and consolidation of suppliers in some industries have made organizations more vulnerable to remote disruptive events. Models of supply-chain risks often start with simple actuarial or theoretical models of the likelihood and impact of root causes of damage to the company's own facilities from fires, floods, earthquakes, and so forth. Next, the models extend to include the sites of suppliers. Third, understanding some categories of risks also entails understanding deeper supply-chain structures into which there is far less visibility on specific sites and vulnerabilities. With these three levels comes an understanding of how disruptions arise and propagate in supply chains; this understanding, in turn, enables companies to develop both quantitative and qualitative insights into the likelihood and impact of disruptions so that they can prioritize their risk management efforts. This first section of this chapter provides a classification of disruptions that can affect supply-chain operations, from natural disasters to accidents to intentional disruptions to global crises. The second section focuses on 55 Finance and Risk Management for International Logistics and the Supply Chain
