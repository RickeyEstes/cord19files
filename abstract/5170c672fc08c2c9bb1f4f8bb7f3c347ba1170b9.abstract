Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still a common and potentially lethal infectious disease. CAP is the leading cause of death from infectious diseases and the sixth-ranked cause of death overall in the United States [1]. It is estimated that 4 to 5 million cases of CAP occur annually, accounting for approximately 10 million physician visits, 500,000 hospitalizations, 45,000 deaths, and an annual cost of $23 billion [2,3]. The overall CAP-related mortality rate has ranged from 2% to 30% among hospitalized patients, whereas the mortality rate is less than 1% for patients who are not hospitalized [2] . Disputes over diagnostic evaluations and therapeutic decisions exist for patients with CAP [1]. The causative pathogen remains unknown in 30% to 60% of cases despite vigorous clinical investigation [4]. Based on a review of more than 15 published reports from North America covering more than two decades of experience in hospitalized patients, the detection of specific bacterial pathogens as causes of pneumonia ranges from 20% to 60% for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 3% to 10% for Haemophilus influenzae, 1% to 6% for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 4% for Chlamydia pneumoniae, 2% to 8% for Legionella species, 2% for viruses, 6% to 10% for aspiration, 3% for Staphylococcus aureus, 3% to 5% for gramnegative bacilli, and 10% to 20% for other identified causes [1] . This article summarizes the epidemiology, risk factors, and outcomes of microorganisms associated with CAP.
