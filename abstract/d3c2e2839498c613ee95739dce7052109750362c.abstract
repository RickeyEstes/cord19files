23 BACKGROUND 24 The ongoing worldwide outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is markedly similar to the severe acute 25 respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 17 years ago. During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, 26 healthcare workers formed a special population of patients. Although virus-specific IgG play 27 important roles in virus neutralization and prevention against future infection, limited information is 28 available regarding the long term persistence of IgG after infection with SARS-like coronavirus. 29 METHODS A long-term prospective cohort study followed 34 SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers from a 31 hospital with clustered infected cases during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, China, 32 with a 13-year follow-up. Serum samples were collected annually from 2003-2015. Twenty 33 SARS-CoV-infected and 40 non-infected healthcare workers were enrolled in 2015, and their serum 34 samples were collected. All sera were tested for IgG antibodies with ELISA using whole virus and a 35 recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV, as a diagnostic antigen. 36 RESULTS Anti SARS-CoV IgG was found to persist for up to 12 years. IgG titers typically peaked in 2004, declining rapidly from 2004-2006, and then continued to decline at a slower rate. IgG titers in 39 .

Patients 40 treated with corticosteroids at the time of infection were found to have lower IgG titers than those 41 without. 42 CONCLUSIONS 43 IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV can persist for at least 12 years. The presence of SARS-CoV IgG 44 might provide protection against SARS-CoV and other betacoronavirus. This study provides valuable 45 information regarding humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV and the 2019-nCoV. 46 47
