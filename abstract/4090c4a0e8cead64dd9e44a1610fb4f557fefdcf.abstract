The Zika virus (ZIKV) can induce inflammation in immunoprivileged organs (e.g., the brain and testis), leading to the Guillain-Barr√© syndrome and damaging the testes. During an infection with the ZIKV, immune cells have been shown to infiltrate into the tissues. However, the cellular mechanisms that define the protection and/or immunopathogenesis of these immune cells during a ZIKV infection are still largely unknown. Herein, we describe methods to evaluate the virus-specific T-cell functionality in these immunoprivileged organs of ZIKV-infected mice. These methods include a) a ZIKV infection and vaccine inoculation in Ifnar1 -/mice; b) histopathology, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry assays to detect the virus infection and inflammation in the brain, testes, and spleen; c) the preparation of a tetramer of ZIKV-derived T-cell epitopes; d) the detection of ZIKV-specific T cells in the monocytes isolated from the brain, testes, and spleen. Using these approaches, it is possible to detect the antigen-specific T cells that have infiltrated into the immunoprivileged organs and to evaluate the functions of these T cells during the infection: potential immune protection via virus clearance and/or immunopathogenesis to exacerbate the inflammation. These findings may also help to clarify the contribution of T cells induced by the immunization against ZIKV. October 2018 | 140 | e58110 | Page 2 of 10 immunoreactivity induced by an adenovirus-vector-based ZIKV vaccine could be detected in immunized mice, and both M and E glycoproteins were shown to induce robust antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell immunoreactivity 13 . During a virus infection, the recognition of peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to the T-cell receptor (TCR) is an important T-cell-mediated mechanism for protecting the host 14 . Based on this theory, tetramer technology is a unique tool to elucidate the roles that antigen-specific T cells play in regulating the immune responses 15 . This protocol describes the establishment of the Ifnar1 -/mouse model for ZIKV infections, and the detection of reactive T cells in the spleen, brain, and testes of the mice by using tetramer technology. Additionally, we used the ZIKV-E 294-302 tetramer to detect and evaluate T-cell immunoreactivity induced by a ZIKV vaccine (AdC7-M/ E) in immunized mice. This study provides guidance for investigating T-cell responses in immunoprivileged organs and provides a reference for the potential applications in the placenta or fetal brain.
