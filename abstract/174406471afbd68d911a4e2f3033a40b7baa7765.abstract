In order to determine the minimum RNase A concentration to degrade siRNA completely, siRNA (300 ng) was incubated with different amounts of RNase A in TE 1X pH 8 buffer (0.02, 0.07, 0.162, 0.348, 0.7, and 3.3 g RNase A per 1 g siRNA) for 45 min at 37C, in presence or absence of RiboLock ® RNase Inhibitor (RI, 1L = 40U). The concentration of 0.35 g RNase A per 1 g siRNA has been reported in literature to be enough to degrade a large fraction of siRNA in polyplexes, 1, 2 and based on that, the amount of RNase A was varied in this experiment. Next, samples were frozen at -20C overnight, and loaded in the slots of casted agarose gel (1.5 % w/v in TAE 1X pH 8.2 buffer) stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 g  mL -1 ). The electrophoresis was performed at 60V (E0160-VWR Mini Gel Electrophoresis) for 40 min, and the siRNA-dye migration was visualized under UV irradiation (FOTO/Analyst ® Investigator/Eclipse with UV Transilluminator Fotodyne Inc.) and the images were recorded using the FOTO/Analyst ® PC Image software (v.5). The result is shown in Figure S1 , and clearly indicates that free siRNA (not protected by RNase inhibitor) was completely degraded by RNAse A starting at concentration 0.162 g RNase A per 1 g siRNA, since no siRNA band was observed in lane 6 compared to lane 7 and lane 1.
