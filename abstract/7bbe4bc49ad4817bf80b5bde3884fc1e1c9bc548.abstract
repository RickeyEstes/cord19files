ELSEVIER Veterinary immunology and Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 45 (1995)265-284 immunopathology In order to evaluate mucosal antibody responses to rotavirus, an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay was adapted to enumerate antibody-secreting cells ( ASC ) in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), lamina propria (LP) of the small intestine and spleens of gnotobiotic pigs orally inoculated with porcine rotaviruses (SB 1 A and Gottfried). Rotavirus-specific IgM ASC occurred by post-inoculation day (PID) 3, and numbers peaked in spleen and MLN tissues by PID 7 and in intestinal LP by PID 7-14. Numbers of rotavirus specific IgA and IgG ASC in these tissues peaked at PID 14-2 1. Rotavirus specific IgA ASC were predominant in the gut and IgA to IgG rotavirus specific ASC ratios were highest for all rotavirus antigen coatings in the gut LP. However, the relative ratios of specific IgA to IgG ASC were lower (ratios of 5 to 7) against combined structural and nonstructural viral antigens (rotavirus-infected fixed cell ELISPOT plates) than ratios ( 13 to 46) against only viral structural antigens (rotavirus-coated ELISPOT plates). indicating that there were proportionately more specific IgG ASC to the nonstructural viral antigens in the LP, the tissue adjacent to the site of rotavirus replication in the intestine. In the node cells (spleen and MLN) rotavirus-specific IgA to IgG ASC ratios were lowest and against the various ELISPOT rotavirus coatings ranged from 0.7 to 4. Gnotobiotic piglets inoculated at different ages with porcine rotaviruses generally showed similar specific immunoglobulin Ig) ASC responses to rotavirus infection, along with similar diar-' Present address: Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, The Ohio State University, I (216) 263-3677. 0165-2427/95/$09.50 0 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.
