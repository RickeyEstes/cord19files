The envelope glycoproteins S1 and S2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mediate viral entry by conformational change from a prefusion state to a postfusion state that enables fusion of the viral and target membranes. In this work we present the characterization of the dynamic properties of the SARS-CoV S2-HR2 domain (residues 1141-1193 of S) in the prefusion and newly discovered transition states by NMR 15 N relaxation studies. The dynamic properties of the different states, which are stabilized under different experimental conditions, extend the current model of viral membrane fusion and give insight into the design of structure-based antagonists of SARS-CoV in particular, as well as other enveloped viruses such as HIV.

SARS-CoV 1 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) enters target cells by first binding to the cell membrane and subsequently inducing fusion of the viral and cellular membranes [1,2]. The envelope proteins S1 and S2 mediate the binding and fusion steps, respectively [3], in a manner that is thought to be similar to the well-characterized envelope proteins of HIV and influenza [4, 5] . During the fusion step, SARS-CoV S2, as well as its homologs in HIV and influenza, is thought to undergo a series of conformational changes from a prefusion state to a postfusion state [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . SARS-CoV S2 possesses 2 heptad repeat domains termed HR1 and HR2, which have a high propensity to form helix. The high-resolution structure of the SARS-CoV S2 in the postfusion state has been determined [6] [7] [8] . In the postfusion state of SARS-CoV S2, as well as the postfusion form of the analogous proteins in Ebola, HIV, influenza and parainfluenza [9-12], the HR1 domains self associate as parallel trimers and the HR2 domains associate with the HR1 in an anti-parallel orientation to form the ''6 helix bundle". More recently structures of the prefusion states of SARS-CoV S2-HR1 [8] and S2-HR2 [13] have been determined. Other examples of prefusion structures include influenza HA2 [14] and parainfluenza virus 5 F [15] . Support for the presence of the prefusion conformation in vivo arises from the anti-viral activities of peptides, corresponding to the HR1 and HR2 sequences, that apparently inhibit virus entry by binding to the prefusion conformation and thereby prohibit the transformation to the postfusion form [16] [17] [18] . A peptide termed T20 or fuzeon, which stems from the HIV gp41 HR2 sequence, is currently used in humans [19] . A central feature of the viral entry model is the transformation from the prefusion state to the postfusion state. Recently, S2-HR2 has been shown to be in a dynamic equilibrium between a structured coiled-coil trimer, which is thought to represent the prefusion state, and unstructured monomer, which is thought to represent a metastable transition state [20] . In the present work, we present the detailed characterization of the dynamic properties of SARS-CoV S2-HR2 in the prefusion and transition states using NMR relaxation. We will discuss the importance of considering the S2-HR2 dynamic properties in the viral entry model, as well as in the design of future envelope-based anti-virals. Recombinant SARS-CoV S2-HR2, consisting of residues 1141-1193 of S, was prepared as previously described [13] . NMR samples were prepared by ultrafiltration (YM3, Amicon, Billerica, MA) using the appropriate buffer (10 mM PO 4 /pH 7.0 or 10 mM PO 4 /pH 7.0, 30% TFE-d3, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA). The final concentration of S2-HR2 was 400 lM (R xy of the prefusion state was also determined at 1 mM protein concentration). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic triple resonance probe. Spectra were processed by NmrPipe and visualized with NmrDraw [21] . The backbone assignments at 25°C in the presence and absence of 30% TFE have been reported elsewhere [13, 20] . The backbone assignments of S2-HR2 at 45°C were determined from a series of the standard triple resonance experiments [13] . The 15 N R z (1/T 1 ), 1090-7807/$ -see front matter Ó
