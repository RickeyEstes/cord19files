Background: On-site vaccination arrangements were introduced in 2005 to improve influenza vaccination rate among employees of a 1500-bed tertiary hospital in Singapore. Methods: On-site arrangements include mobile teams to 3 distant departments and same-service area vaccination for employees at 4 service areas. Results: Influenza vaccination rate in 2005 was 66.4% (versus 56.8% in 2004, odds ratio 1.50, 95% confidence interval 1.39-1.62). Employees who attended on-site arrangements had higher influenza vaccination rate (97.0%). Conclusion: On-site vaccination arrangements improved influenza vaccination rate among hospital employees.
