R E V I E W / Feline transfusion medicine Mik is a newly described blood group in cats that has been identified as a cause of incompatibilities between donor and recipient blood that are not related to the AB blood group system. Mik antibodies (named after the alloantibody identified in the first blood donor cat, Mike) were discovered in three cats that had not previously received transfusions. 36 The clinical relevance of this is that haemolytic transfusion reactions can occur in previously naive, AB-typed cats. As it is not possible to examine for the presence of this blood group, cross-matching has been recommended by some authors. Reactions can be subclinical and result in more rapid destruction of donor blood cells. The importance of this blood group has not been investigated outside of the USA.

The best way of determining whether a transfusion is indicated is by assessing the patient for clinical signs referable to anaemia, through physical examination, in concert with clinicopathological data.
