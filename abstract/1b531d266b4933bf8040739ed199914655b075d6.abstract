The outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan 17 City of China obtained global concern, the population outflow from Wuhan has 18 contributed to spatial expansion in other parts of China. We examined the effects of 19 population outflow from Wuhan on the 2019-nCoV transmission in other provinces 20 and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan. We observed 21 a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of 22 cases. Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two 23 days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could be prevented, and if two days 24 later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible. Our findings suggest 25 that population movement might be one important trigger of the 2019-nCoV infection 26 transmission in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to prevent the 27 epidemic. 28
