Cardiac transplantation End-stage heart failure Rejection Immunosuppression Heart transplantation is indicated in patients with heart failure despite optimal medical and device therapy, manifesting as intractable angina, refractory heart failure, or intractable ventricular arrhythmias. The evaluation for heart transplantation focuses on assessment of the presence of optimal medical management, the stability of extracardiac function, and adequate compliance and caregiver support. Standard immunosuppression after transplantation consists of triple-drug therapy with corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors (most commonly tacrolimus), and antiproliferative agents (most commonly mycophenolate mofetil). Treatment of rejection is progressively more aggressive as the patient's clinical status worsens, and ranges from an oral corticosteroid bolus and taper to intravenous pulse corticosteroids, cytolytic therapy with antithymocyte globulin, intravenous immune globulin, plasmapheresis, and circulatory support with inotropic therapy, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The major long-term complications of heart transplantation are cardiac allograft vasculopathy, infections, and malignancy. Cardiol Clin 32 (2014) 95-112 http://dx.
