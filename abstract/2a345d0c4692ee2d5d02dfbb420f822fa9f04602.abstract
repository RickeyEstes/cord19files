C3G is involved in signalling from crk to JNK. C3HA An inbred strain of mice that originally was very suceptible to mammary tumours. although the third to be activated in the classical pathway. Becomes activated by cleavage (by C1) to C4b, which complexes with C2a to act as a C3 convertase, generating C3a and C3b. The C4b2a3b complex acts on C5 to continue the cascade. Human C4 is polymorphic at two loci, C4A and C4B. C4 plants Plants found principally in hot climates whose initial fixation of CO 2 in photosynthesis is by the HSK pathway. The enzyme responsible is PEP carboxylase, whose products contain four carbon atoms. Subsequently the CO 2 is released and re-fixed by the Calvin-Benson cycle. The presence of the HSK pathway permits efficient photosynthesis at high light intensities and low CO 2 concentrations.
