Infectious bronchitis (IB) causes significant economic losses in the global poultry industry. Control of infectious bronchitis is hindered by the genetic diversity of the causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which has led to the emergence of several serotypes that lack complete serologic cross-protection. While serotyping by definition requires immunologic characterization, genotyping is an efficient means to identify IBVs detected in samples. Sanger sequencing of the S1 subunit of the spike gene is currently used to genotype IBV; however, the universal S1 PCR was created to work from cultured IBV and it is inefficient at detecting mixed isolates. This paper describes a MinION-based AmpSeq method that genetically typed IBV from clinical samples, including samples with multiple isolates. Total RNA was extracted from fifteen tracheal scrapings and choanal cleft swab samples, randomly reverse transcribed, and PCR amplified using modified S1-targeted primers. Amplicons were barcoded to allow for pooling of samples, processed per manufacturer's instructions into a 1D MinION sequencing library, and sequenced on the MinION. The AmpSeq method detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive samples. AmpSeq accurately detected and genotyped both IBV lineages in three of five samples containing two IBV lineages. Additionally, one sample contained three IBV lineages, and AmpSeq accurately detected two of the three. Strain identification, including detection of different strains from the same lineage, was also possible with this AmpSeq method. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using MinION-based AmpSeq for rapid and accurate identification and lineage typing of IBV from oral swab samples. Infectious bronchitis virus is an enveloped, pleomorphic gammacoronavirus with an unsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense, 26-27.8 Kb, RNA genome that encodes the nonstructural polyprotein,1a and 1b, and several structural proteins: spike (S), envelop (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). 38,41 In addition, two accessory genes, expressing 3a, 3b and 5a and 5b, respectively, have also been described. 6, 14, 38 The S protein is highly glycosylated and post-translational cleavage leads to two subunits: S1 and S2. 10,48 Besides acting as the viral attachment protein, the S1 protein is a major target of neutralizing antibodies. 7 As with many attachment proteins that are targets of virus-neutralizing antibodies, the S1 subunit is highly diverse with almost 50% of the amino acids differing among IBV serotypes. 2,21,38 Such variation leads to important biological differences between IBV serotypes and the emergence of novel variants. More than 60 serotypes of IBV have been reported, but the most common serotypes of All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. Massachusetts. 16 This genetic diversity leads to emergence of new serotypes and a lack of complete cross-serotype protection by vaccines. 29 The correlation of IBV genotypes and serotypes of IBV has been reported 45 ; therefore, accurate genotypic identification of IBV is an important step to diagnose IBV in clinical respiratory cases, ensure selection of proper IBV vaccines for use in vaccination programs, and to better understand the epidemiology of this global virus. One of the recent comprehensive classification schemes for IBV uses S1 gene sequencebased phylogeny of IBV and identified six genotypes (I-VI), 32 sub-genotypic lineages, and a number of inter-lineage recombinants in global strains of IBV. 44 Among the six genotypes, genotype I (G-I) is the most diverse group of viruses, with 27 unique lineages. 44 As such, sequencing of the S1 subunit provides important information regarding the classification of IBV within samples. The genetic classification of IBV has relied on genotype-specific RT-qPCR assays, serotype-specific S1 RT-qPCR 32,40 and/or pan-IBV S1 RT-PCR assays coupled with Sanger sequencing. 8,31,49 Genotype-specific RT-qPCRs are limited to short fragments, which may miss important changes in the S1 (~1.6 kb) 44 outside the short target. Additionally, since the target is short, the primers lie within the variable regions of the S1 and may require a different assay for each genotype. Lastly, the pan-IBV S1 primers 1, 17, 22, 23, 25, 33 , while only requiring one reaction, have relatively low sensitivity and are typically used only on egg-cultured virus, which adds an additional, time consuming step and many diagnostic labs do not have SPF embryos readily available. Lastly, cloning of PCR products has been used to detect multiple IBV sub-populations in the sample 30 ; however, this is inefficient when potentially dealing with multiple (three or four) All rights reserved.

As such, the development of a pan-IBV sequencing method to rapidly determine the genotype(s) in samples would aid in lineage typing and tracking of IBV genotypes circulating in poultry flocks. Recently, third generation sequencing technology has been used for detection of viral nucleotides and sequencing ultra-long DNA molecules. 34 The MinION Nanopore sequencer, a new DNA sequencing technology that allows for rapid, in-house, real-time technique detection and differentiation of IBV lineages, may be cost effective and useful in the field. 19 Ampliconbased sequencing has also been used to amplify specific regions of Newcastle disease 3,13 , infectious laryngotracheitis virus 39 Zika 34 , Ebola 35 and avian influenza viruses 46 , by simple RT-PCR and then sequencing on the MinION device. Real-time data analysis, the lack of significant start-up cost investment or maintenance expenses, simultaneous and sequential multiplexing unique to MinION, and the ability to sequence long DNA molecules so that primers are in conserved regions while the product contains the variable region are the features that make this technology highly feasible to be used for disease diagnostics. Accurate identification of IBV genotypes from samples, including detection of multiple isolates from a single sample, is crucial to respiratory disease diagnosis, selection of appropriate IBV vaccines, and epidemiologic studies. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to create a single, amplicon-based protocol to sequence IBV-S1 gene and develop a sequence analysis workflow to identify IBV isolates from clinical swab samples. This method provides a useful assay for IBV and a model for the development of future amplicon sequencing (AmpSeq) based assays. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. A universal S1 primer set, 27 tailed with the MinION universal adapter sequence of 22 nucleotides (underlined, Table 2 ) to allow barcoding of amplicons, was used for targeted amplification of the IBV S1 gene for IBV. The PCR reaction mixture (Expand High Fidelity PCR system, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was composed of 10 µl of cDNA, 1 µl of 10 µM forward primer, 1 µl of 10 µM reverse primer, 2.5 µl of 10× Expand high fidelity buffer, 1 µl of Expand High Fidelity Enzyme Mix, and 1 µl of 10mM dNTPs, to a final volume to 25 µl with 9 µl of nuclease-free water. The following thermocycling conditions were used for amplicon synthesis: denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 minutes, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. See Table 2 for details about all three primer sets used in this study. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen) for visual evaluation. Amplified DNA was purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) at 1.6:1 (volumetric bead:DNA) and quantified using the dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit on a Qubit® Fluorimeter 3.0. The amplicons obtained from the tailed S1 primer set were then used to prepare MinIONcompatible DNA libraries. Briefly, each of the amplicons were diluted to 0.5 nM and amplified using barcoding primers (1D PCR Barcoding Amplicon Kit, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, [ONT], UK) and LongAmp Taq 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) with the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min; 15 cycles of 95 °C for 15 seconds, 62 °C for 15 seconds, 65 °C for 80 seconds; and 65 °C for 80 seconds. The barcoded amplicons were bead purified (1:1.4; bead:solution), pooled (Run1; pool of 10 samples, Run2; pool of 5 samples) into a single All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. Centrifuge 24 , Kraken 50 , QIIME 5 and Mothur 37 have been used to identify and profile microbial species; however, the high error rate 20 of Nanopore reads translates to poor classification accuracy for many of these tools. Alternatively, de novo 3,26 or reference-based 18 assembly methods have been used in MinION and other deep sequencing platforms. Using a strategy similar to other unbiased laboratory tests (e.g., standard bacterial cultures), an approach was developed to maximize usage of reads (i.e., reads are not discarded based on pre-set length or abundance requirements, similar to how a single colony may be interpreted as a significant result). This approach uses read-based classification against a database containing an equal number of representative sequences per lineage to detect and classify the reads based on their lineage, before conducting read-based classification to the isolate level by using all available IBV sequences in a separate database. Finally, lineage-clustered isolate-level read assignments are interpreted by a veterinary diagnostician to result in reads available for consensus building. The use of a final consensus alignment helps to overcome the individual error rate of MinION sequencing. 3 Similarly, the absence of predetermined metrics used in de novo assembly allows for the informed decision as to how many consensus sequences to build, a bioinformatics problem when dealing with clinical cases that can contain more than one isolate (e.g., similar to how there is not a predetermined number of significant bacterial colonies). Confirmatory followup tests (e.g., RT-PCR) may be needed when dealing with low number of reads in clinical samples; however, future testing of this new technology will allow for creating standards for such confirmatory testing. Taken together, these results suggest the application of MinION-based AmpSeq, specifically for detecting IBV isolates from clinical samples within a few days, compared to several days to weeks and multiple diagnostic assays to culture and detect multiple IBV All rights reserved.
