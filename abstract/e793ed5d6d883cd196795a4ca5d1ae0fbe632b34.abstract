Thank you for the submission of your manuscript to EMBO Molecular Medicine. We have now heard back from two of the three referees whom we asked to evaluate your manuscript. As these two referees have very similar recommendations, we decided to go ahead and make a decision now. Although referees do find the study suitable for publication in principle, referee 2 suggested expanding the discussion and providing additional explanations here and there. We would welcome the submission of a revised version for further consideration and depending on the nature of the revisions, this may be sent back or not to the referees for another round of review.
