The development of modern respiratory medicine in China has undergone three phases, primarily driven by the disease burdens and the corresponding regulation priorities. The fi rst phase (1920s to 1960s) was a phase of prevention and management of TB. During this period, pulmonary TB was the most common respiratory disease in China. TB was extensively studied, and TB control was one of the top priorities in national public health programs in the 1950s. 1 When effective prevention and treatment became available and TB was brought under control, the focus gradually shifted to other respiratory diseases. The second phase (1970s to mid-1990s) was that of prevention and management of cor pulmonale. The prevention and treatment of the four respiratory diseases of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, cor pulmonale, and infl uenza dominated the fi eld. As a result, a specialized department focusing on respiratory medicine was established in most general hospitals, and many participating physicians became respiratory specialists. This period laid a solid foundation for the development of respiratory medicine in China. The third phase (mid-1990s to present) is that of modern respiratory medicine. Respiratory medicine has developed rapidly in China. Respiratory medicine and critical care medicine have been merged as one department of respiratory and critical care medicine in many leading hospitals, and respiratory/medical ICUs The past century witnessed a rapid development of respiratory medicine in China. The major burden of respiratory disease has shifted from infectious diseases to chronic noninfectious diseases. Great achievements have been made in improving the national standard of clinical management of various respiratory diseases and in smoking control. The specialty of respiratory medicine is expanding into pulmonary and critical care medicine. Nevertheless, respiratory diseases remain a major public health problem, with new challenges such as air pollution and nosocomial infections. This review describes the history, accomplishments, new challenges, and opportunities in respiratory medicine in China.
