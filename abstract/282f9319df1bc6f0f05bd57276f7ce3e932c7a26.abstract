The fabrication of miniaturized and integrated devices as micro-and nano-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS) has provided the development of an innovative family of biochemical sensors based on transducers involving mechanical phenomena. Biosensors based on microcantilevers have become a promising tool for directly detecting biomolecular interactions with great accuracy, especially when an optical read-out scheme is applied. The number of applications of these sensors has shown a fast growth in diverse fields, such as genomic, proteomic, environmental, or food quality control, being a promising alternative to the currently exploited biosensor techniques. Cantilever biosensors The spring constant, k, and resonance frequency, f0, for a rectangular cantilever clamped at one end are given by where E is the Young's modulus, m is the cantilever effective mass, w is the width, h is the thickness, and L is the length, respectively. Interaction or binding of molecules to one of the cantilever surfaces may lead to a change in the angle of cantilever bending or a shift in its resonance frequency. The detection of these responses is usually referred as static and dynamic modes of operation, respectively. But the mechanical response is also sensitive to different factors, such as temperature, heat, electromagnetic field, stress, and mass. These transducers can be employed for several applications besides biosensing. Figure 10 .1
