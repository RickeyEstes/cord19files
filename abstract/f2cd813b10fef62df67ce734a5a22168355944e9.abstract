Many adenovirus field strains exhibit serological relationship to two different prototypes. Differences were found by SN and HI. Examples are intermediate strains (ISIH9, 171H29; H = Hemagglutinin), doubly neutralizable strains (3+ 161H16, 11 +3SIH3S), or strains cross-reacting in HI with two different types (211H21 +35). The variants were further characterized by DNA restriction analysis using at least seven endonucleases. While the DNA of serologically identical strains showed slight variations, only, the comparison of the variants with the serologically related prototypes resulted in only moderate DNA relationship (50 to 70% comigrating fragments, with few exceptions). It is possible that the serologic variants have originated by recombination of two prototype-like strains. Respective data will be presented for A VlS/H9 intermediate strains. Aim of this investigation was to answer three questions: 1. Prevalence of Delta hepatitis in South-West-Germany? 2. Prevalence of inapparent HDV infection? 3. Is the clinical course of Delta hepatitis different from that of hepatitis B? Material and methods: Six hundred and fifty-three HBsAg pas. and one hundred and fifty-two HBsAg neg.lanti-HBclHIV pos. sera were reinvestigated for anti-Delta IgG and IgM (DELTAK, DELTA-IGMK, SORIN). Data on the clinical course were taken from patients history. Results and discussion: The prevalence of Delta hepatitis is 4.3% (28/653) in HBsAgpos. patients. The prevalence of inapparent HDV infection in HBsAg neg.lanti-HBc pos. drug addicts is 4,6% (71152). From this identical prevalence of HDV infections with apparent and unapparent HBV infections, we conclude, that about every other HDV infection is correlated with clinical hepatitis. Anti-Delta IgM was detected in 22 of the 28 HBsAg/anti-Delta pos. sera as well an in 2 of 7 anti-Delta/anti-HBc pos. sera of HBsAg neg. drug addicts. Autoantibodies were detected in 82% of the patients (23128). All cases, in which liver biopsies were done, demonstrated anti-Delta IgM and autoantibodies. Thus, the detection of anti-Delta IgM and autoantibodies indicates chronic a. H.
