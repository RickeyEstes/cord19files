Cell culture and mTOR inhibition. HeLa (ATCC: CCL-2), HEK293T (ATCC: CRL-326), primary human foreskin fibroblasts (ATCC: SCRC-1041), TZM-bl (NIH AIDS Reagent Resource: 8129) and murine embryonic fibroblasts (a gift from M. Diamond) and any derivatives produced in this study were cultivated at 37°C and 5% CO2 in DMEM (Gibco) complemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) and regularly passaged with the aid of Trypsin-EDTA (0.05%). Rapamycin, Torin 1, bafilomycin A1, MG-132, cycloheximide (Sigma) and EGA (Calbiochem) were reconstituted in DMSO and stored in aliquots at -20°C. Earle's Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS) without calcium, magnesium, or phenol red was purchased from Gibco. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Cells were seeded (15,000/well) in Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Thermo Fisher) overnight and treated with DMSO, rapamycin (20 uM), or rapamycin and bafilomycin A1 (1uM) for four hours followed by fixation/permeabilization with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD) for 20 minutes. Primary antibodies were diluted in Odyssey blocking buffer in PBS (Li-Cor) and incubated with cells for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor-labeled secondary antibodies for 30 minutes at room temperature.
