Two tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-derived replicons, created by deletion of most of the 126/18$ .40e open reading frame (ORF), replicated and systemically invaded tobacco plants when sorted by wild type TMV. One RNArepecon contained an internal direct repast of 476 nucleotides from the 3' end of the 30-kOa ORF . ARhaugh this ORA was replicated, most of the progeny were heterogeneous in size and smaller than the origin transcript . A aeoand WVderived RPM replicon, without any Internally repeated sequences and containing a deletion of the !y portion of the 30-kDa ORF as well as most of the 1281183-kDa ORF, was created and coinoculated with wild type TMV as helper. This ANA also wasreplicatedeAk :ientyandsystemicallyinvadedtobaccoplama .Anexaminationofthe ofcONA clones obtained after PCR amplification of the progeny population of this RNA repfibon dernonshrolead a that the observed size heterogeneity was due to deletions and insertions adjacent to the artificially created d1FeNtan junction . Them data demonstrate that a TMV Infection is capable of supporting an artificially created RNA rapfical olnier to defective interfering RNAM or satellites . However, these dependent RNAs were replicated without noticeably interfering with wild type TMV symptoms or replication .
