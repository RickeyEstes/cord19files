Comment www.thelancet.com/infection Vol 20 January 2020 17 rise of flavivirus infections demands vaccines to protect people living in, and travelling to endemic countries. Lack of vaccine safety will dramatically affect the public trust in vaccines for flaviviruses and other diseases, as shown by the recent measles outbreak affecting thousands of unvaccinated children in the Philippines, after the risks of CYD-TDV dengue vaccine became apparent. 11 Vaccines are extremely safe and have saved millions of lives. The problems associated with the dengue vaccine CYD-TDV are therefore an unfortunate event. As a result, new tests are urgently needed to determine flavivirus serological status, ideally suitable for point-of-care testing to allow approaches that pair screening with vaccination. 12 However, the complexity of flaviviral immune interplay might require determination of other flaviviruses besides dengue, and at the very least semi-quantitative techniques including innovative tools for test interpretation that are currently entirely unavailable for point-of-care testing.
