Cilia are organelles specialized for movement and signaling. To infer when during animal 24 evolution signaling pathways became associated with cilia, we characterized the proteomes of 25 cilia from three organisms: sea urchins, sea anemones and choanoflagellates. From these 26 ciliomes, we identified 437 high confidence ciliary candidate proteins conserved in mammals, 27 including known regulators of Hh, GPCR and TRP channel signaling. The phylogenetic profiles 28 of their ciliary association indicate that the Hh and GPCR pathways were linked to cilia before 29 the origin of bilateria and TRP channels before the origin of animals. We demonstrated that some 30 of the candidates not previously implicated in ciliary biology localized to cilia and further 31 investigated ENKUR, a TRP channel-interacting protein that we identified in the cilia of all three 32 organisms. In animals, ENKUR is expressed by cells with motile cilia, ENKUR localizes to cilia 33 in diverse organisms and, in both Xenopus laevis and mice, ENKUR is required for patterning 34 the left/right axis. Moreover, mutation of ENKUR causes situs inversus in humans. Thus, 35 proteomic profiling of cilia from diverse eukaryotes defines a conserved ciliary proteome, 36 reveals ancient connections to Hh, GPCR and TRP channel signaling, and uncovers a novel 37 ciliary protein that controls vertebrate development and human disease. 38 39 such as light and chemical cues such as odors (Bloodgood, 2010; Malicki and Johnson, 2016) . 48 Cilia and the related structures, flagella, are comprised of microtubular cores called 49 axonemes that emanate from basal bodies and are ensheathed by membranes that are 50 compositionally distinct from the contiguous plasma membrane 51
