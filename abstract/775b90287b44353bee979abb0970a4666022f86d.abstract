Introduction: A bee sting can result in a myriad of manifestations ranging from acute localized cutaneous response to unusual delayed reactions. Here we report a case of a 15 year old boy who developed bloody diarrhea 72 hours following a bee sting. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such report of delayed gastrointestinal manifestation. Case Report: A 15 year old male presented for evaluation of allergy to honey bee. He stated that on 2 occasions he was stung by a bee resulting in localized swelling of affected area, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain after the sting, then bloody diarrhea approximately 72 hours after. The most recent episode was 1 week prior to clinic visit when the patient was stung by a bee on his toe, following which he had a local reaction. Then 3 days later he had abdominal pain and loose stools with blood. Examination revealed a well healed puncture mark on his toe. His vitals were normal and CBC, ESR, CMP and a stool culture were unremarkable. Skin prick testing was positive for honey bees. Intradermal testing at lowest concentration (1/100000) was positive for all other Hymenoptera (wasp, yellow jacket, hornet) with negative saline. Immunocap showed positivity to all Hymenoptera species. Discussion: Delayed gastrointestinal hemorrhage is an unusual manifestation after sting by a honey bee that cannot be explained by IgE-mediated mechanisms. We postulate that this response could be due to a delayed type hypersensitivity leading to deposition of immune complexes in the basement membrane of small blood vessels causing vasculitis. This may explain the delayed manifestation of bloody diarrhea 72 hours after the sting. It is also possible that the etiology of this unusual reaction may not be immunologically mediated and may be due to a direct cytotoxic effect of honey bee venom component like Melittin on gastrointestinal tissue. Melittin is known to cause complement cleavage and the release of Bradykinin which are both associated with hemolysis. Studies indicate that Melittin and Phospholipase A2 can decrease smooth muscular contractility and thus potentially induce hemorrhage. Conclusion: We report an unusual and rare case of bee sting induced bloody diarrhea in an adolescent which was reproducible on two different occasions. We hypothesize that this could be due to a delayed hypersensitivity reaction or a direct cytotoxic effect of bee venom.
