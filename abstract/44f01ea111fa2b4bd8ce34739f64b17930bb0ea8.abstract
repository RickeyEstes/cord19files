The possible occurrence of a highly pathogenic influenza strain is of concern to health authorities worldwide. It is believed that developing countries may experience a higher illness attack rate compared to developed countries. Intervention strategies shown by modelling studies to be highly effective for developed countries give limited guidance as to the impact which an influenza pandemic may have on low-income countries such as Papua New Guinea (PNG), given different demographics and resource constraints. To address this, an individual-based model of a PNG community was created, used to simulate the spread of a novel influenza strain and the results compared to those obtained from a comparable Australian model. Design A modelling study. Setting The towns of Madang in PNG (population ~35,000) and Albany (population ~30,000) in Australia. Daily and cumulative illness attack rates in both models following introduction of a novel influenza strain into a naive population, for an unmitigated scenario and two social distancing intervention scenarios. The unmitigated scenario indicated a ~50% higher attack rate in PNG compared to the Australian model. The two social distancing-based interventions strategies were 60% -70% less effective in a PNG setting compared to an Australian setting.
