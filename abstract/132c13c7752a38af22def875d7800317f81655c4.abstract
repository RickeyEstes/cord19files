A computer-assisted comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences of (putative) thiol proteases encoded by the genomcs of scvcral diverse groups of positive-stranded RNA viruses and distantly related to the family of cellular papain-like proteases is presented. A high level of similarity was detected between the leader protcasc of foot-and-mouth-disease virus and the protease of murine hepatitis coronavirus which cleaves the N-terminal ~28 protein from the polyprotcin. Statistically significant alignment of a portion of the rubella virus polyprotein with cellular papain-like proteascs was obtained, lasding to tentative identification of the papain-like protcase as the enzyme mediating processing of the non-structural proteins of this virus. Specific grouplyg between the sequences of the proteases of cr-viruses, and poty-and bymoviruses was revealed. It was noted that papainlike protcases of positive-str;qded RNA viruws are much more variable both in their sequences and in genomic locations than chymotrypsin-related proteases found in the same vim: class. A novel conarvcd domain of unknown function has also been identified which flanks the papain-like pro. teases of er-. rubi-and coronaviruses.
