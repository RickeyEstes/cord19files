Viruses possessing class I fusion proteins require proteolytic activation by host cell proteases to mediate 18 fusion with the host cell membrane. The mammalian SPINT2 gene encodes a protease inhibitor that 19 targets trypsin-like serine proteases. Here we show the protease inhibitor, SPINT2, restricts cleavage-20 activation efficiently for a range of influenza viruses and for human metapneumovirus (HMPV). SPINT2 21 treatment resulted in the cleavage and fusion inhibition of full-length influenza A/CA/04/09 (H1N1) HA, 22
