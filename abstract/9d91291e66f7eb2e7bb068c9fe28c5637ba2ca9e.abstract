Vaughn, J.M. and Landry, E.F., 1984. Public health considerations associated with molluscan aquaculture systems: human viruses. ~quucuiture, 39: 299-315. The documentation of several recent outbreaks of human virus diseases associated with the consumption of shellfish has reiterated the threat posed by these agents to the shellfish industry. This article reviews pertinent outbreaks, identifies principal viral agents involved, and delineates systems which may be at greatest risk. The results of two recent laboratory studies which sought to define environmental factors that contribute to virus accumulation by shellfish are also discussed. First, the accumulation of environmentally significant levels of feces-associated and monodispersed poliovirus by oysters (Crassostrea virgbica) and clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) was investigated. The results of this study suggested that virus accumulation by mollusks may not be significant when water column concentrations are below ~0.01 plaque-forming units (PFU) per milliliter. The second study focused on the relative contributions of undisturbed sediments versus those in the water column in the accumulation of viruses by epifaunal and infaunal shellfish (C. virgikca and M. mercenarid. Viruses were found to be most efficiently accumulated when suspended in the water column.
