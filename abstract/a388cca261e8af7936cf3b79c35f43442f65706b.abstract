SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a common human receptor ACE2. Protein-protein interaction structure modeling indicates that spike-RBD of the two viruses also has similar overall binding conformation and binding free energy to ACE2. In vitro assays using recombinant ACE2 proteins and ACE2 expressing cells confirmed the two coronaviruses' similar binding affinities to ACE2. The above studies provide experimental supporting evidences and possible explanation for the high transmissibility observed in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Potent ACE2-blocking SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies showed limited cross-binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2. ACE2-non-blocking SARS-CoV RBD antibodies, though with weaker neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV, showed positive cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 with an unknown mechanism. These findings suggest a trade-off between the efficacy and spectrum for therapeutic antibodies to different coronaviruses, and hence highlight the possibilities and challenges in developing broadly protecting antibodies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its future mutants. Various estimates and analyses suggest SARS-CoV-2 and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) may have similar transmissibility with an estimated reproductive number (R 0 ) of 3.77 (2.23-4.82) for SARS-CoV-2 and between 2.9-3.3 for SARS-CoV 8 . SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a common host-cell receptor protein, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressed on epithelial cells in the respiratory track system and various human organs, such as the lung 9,10 . Receptor recognition by coronaviruses is the first and essential step for infecting host cells 11,12 . An envelope-anchored trimeric spike (S) protein mediates the binding of the two coronaviruses to human ACE2 13,14 , and is cleaved by the host protease into two separate polypeptides as S1, which contains the receptor binding domain (RBD), and S2, which is responsible for the homotrimer formation and mediates fusion of the virion with cellular membranes 15 . The receptor binding motif (RBM) in RBD is responsible for direct binding to ACE2 and its binding affinity may directly affects the virus infectivity and transmissibility 16, 17 . The amino acid sequence homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 approximates to 75% for the spike proteins, and are 73.7% and 50.0% for RBDs and RBMs, respectively. Here we investigated the optimized complex structure conformations between the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2
