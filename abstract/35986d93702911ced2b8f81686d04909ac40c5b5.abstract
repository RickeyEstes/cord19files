Monolayers of pancreatic p-cells from strains of mice susceptible @IL/J) and resistant (C57BL/&l) to the development of virus-induced diabetes mellitus were inoculated with the M variant of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus. Immunofluorescence showed that viral antigens appeared in up to 10 times more /3 cells from susceptible &IL/J mice than from resistant C57BLKJ mice. Infectious center assays revealed that lo-30 times more &IL/J /I cells contained infectious virus than C57BLFJ p cells. Viral attachment experiments showed no difference in the binding of EMC virus when embryonic fibroblasts, pancreatic fibroblasts, and kidney cells from SJLlJ and C57BL/&J mice were compared. However, at least twice as much virus attached to the pancreatic /3 cells from susceptible than from resistant strains of mice. Our data suggest that genetically determined differences in viral receptors on the surface of fi cells may be one of the factors controlling susceptibility to EMC-induced diabetes mellitus. 606
