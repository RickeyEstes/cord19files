1. Shock is the clinical expression of dysoxia. Dysoxia is lack of oxygen supply to, or use by, the cells, limiting energy production. 1 Poor perfusion and diminished oxygen delivery to the tissues with resulting signs of pallor, tachycardia, tachypnea, and altered pulse quality is another way to describe shock. 2. Oxygen delivery (DO 2 ) is the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues as determined by cardiac output and oxygen carrying capacity. 2 It is described best by the equation CO Ã‚ CaO 2 , in which CO is cardiac output (the heart rate multiplied by stroke Disclosure: The author has nothing to disclose. Shock Physiology Critical care Exotic animals Most of the literature discussing shock, systemic inflammation, and sepsis relates to experimental studies using small mammals such as rodents and rabbits; there is a paucity of research of these syndromes in other species, such as ferrets, birds, and reptiles. Although small mammals, experimentally, have a similar autonomic response to dogs during induced hemorrhage and shock states, this response is not noted in the clinical setting, in which decompensated shock is more commonly reported. Poor perfusion affects every major organ system, but particular attention should be given to the immune system, coagulation system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. Knowing how these systems are affected helps explain to clinicians why patients with shock can later become septic or coagulopathic. To ensure the best outcomes in patients who have shock or systemic inflammatory response syndrome, early recognition and intervention by provision of supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation is essential.
