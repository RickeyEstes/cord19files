Blood donation is critical to all of transfusion therapy, as it provides the starting product. In the United States and many other economically developed nations, all of the blood is given by volunteer, nonremunerated donors. Donated whole blood is then made into transfusable components, which include but are not limited to packed red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, and frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate. Other lesser utilized blood components, such as granulocytes and cryoprecipitate-depleted plasma, also have important therapeutic value. Individual plasma proteins, such as factor VIII, have been manufactured using recombinant methods for years; however, there is no commercial product, single or combined, with the clinical properties of frozen plasma. Each of these components make possible an extraordinary number of traditional and state-of-the-art medical therapies, including trauma surgery, organ transplantation, and cancer chemotherapy. At the time of this writing, there are no clinically effective or available substitutes for RBCs, platelets, or plasma in the United States. In 2001, the National Blood Donor Resource Center estimated that 8 million volunteer U.S. blood donors contributed approximately 15 million whole blood donations per year, the majority of which were manufactured into separate components, such as RBCs, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. 1 These components allowed transfusion of 29 million blood components in the United States. Thus, in the United States, the average volunteer blood donor gives blood about 1.6 times a year. Of that total, almost 2% represent donations indicated for a specific recipient other than the donor. These are generally referred to as directed or designated donations. In addition, approximately 3% of blood donations are autologous: blood that is donated by an individual for his or her own use, usually for a prescheduled elective surgery. 2-4 Although it is estimated that 60% of the adult population in the United States is eligible to donate blood, at present it is believed that less than 5% of the eligible population donates within any given year. 5,6 The various reasons that some people give blood readily and others do not have been studied for several decades, but the blood donation process and applicable statistics during this time have changed little, if at all. Blood donation can be divided into five processes that are directly related to the donor: recruitment, screening, physical examination, collection, and post-donation care. Recruitment of blood donors is a specialized task. It is often performed by telerecruiters, and the message delivered must be convincing and compelling to result in a scheduled appointment to donate blood. Once a donor has been recruited, the screening process is carried out to make sure that the donation process will be safe for the donor and that the collected blood will be safe for the recipient. The prospective donor is initially given information about criteria for eligibility for blood donation and about the process itself. The screening process consists of a questionnaire that seeks to find medical conditions and behaviors that might make donation unsafe for the donor or recipient. Critical information is confirmed by direct verbal questioning to ensure that the answers are accurate. If no disqualifying information is uncovered during the screening process, a brief physical examination follows, which includes examination of antecubital veins, followed by measurement of body temperature, donor hematocrit or hemoglobin, and heart rate. After the venipuncture is performed, blood is collected, labeled, and temporarily stored until it can be transferred to a manufacturing center for further processing and distribution. Specimen tubes are drawn at the time of collection for infectious disease testing; these tubes are sent for testing immediately after collection. After the donation, donors receive oral fluids and remain under observation for a period of time so that any post-donation reactions may be treated appropriately. Post-donation instructions are given to help the donor avoid untoward side effects. The donor is instructed to call the blood center with any post-donation information, such as the development of worrisome physical symptoms or information remembered that would change the answers given during the screening process. Maintaining an adequate blood supply is an ongoing challenge. Attrition of blood donors due to older age and illness, implementation of new regulations resulting in deferrals, or other reasons makes it difficult for blood collection centers to keep pace with the increasing demand for blood. Thus, the recruitment of new blood donors must be ongoing and vigorous. New exclusionary criteria and serologic testing make this task increasingly difficult, as does the fact that newly recruited blood donors are nearly twice as likely to have disqualifying medical conditions as are established blood donors. 7 It is unacceptable to provide volunteer blood donors with monetary compensation (i.e., cash or cash equivalents), so the act of blood donation in the United States is voluntary. Thus, without paying donors for their time and blood, the
