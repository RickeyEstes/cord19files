Little is known about clinical factors associated with undetectable pneumonic shadows on chest radiographs (CRs) for diagnosing pneumonia in the primary care setting. A retrospective assessment of CRs was conducted to compare chest computed tomography (CT) images of patients admitted to Kesennuma City Motoyoshi Municipal Hospital who were diagnosed with pneumonia from Results: Eighty-three patients were included, and their average age was 83.8 years. Sixtyeight patients (81.9%) were officially certified as requiring long-term care or support. Twenty-nine of the 83 patients (34.9%) had either negative or normal findings on CRs, and positive findings consistent with pneumonia on CT. There were no significant differences in gender, age, cardiothoracic ratio on CR, or severity between the CR-negative and CRpositive groups. The proportion of negative CRs was significantly higher in patients with certified care level 5 under the long-term care system in Japan and tube feeding. The failure rate of CRs for detecting pneumonic shadows was significantly higher in patients with certified care level 5 and tube feeding. certified care level, chest radiograph, computed tomography, pneumonia, tube feeding | 399 SUGISHITA eT Al. We retrospectively studied patients admitted to our hospital who were diagnosed with pneumonia from April 2014 through June 2016. The diagnoses were based on the consensus between our hospital doctors at admission. We selected patients who underwent chest radiography (posterior-anterior or anterior-posterior) and CT on the same day, excluding those for whom a diagnosis of active pneumonia was difficult due to nonpneumonic or interstitial shadows. We analyzed each patients' characteristics, clinical parameters, and radiographic findings at the time of diagnosis. We obtained CRs with the use of a KONICA MINOLTA FPD digital radiography with a 100 kV tube voltage and 1.5 m receptor distance. For sequential CT scans, we used a 16-detector-row CT scanner (Alexon TSX-032A, Toshiba Medical Systems, Tochigi, Japan) with a slice thickness of 2 mm, scanning parameter of 120 kVp, and field of view of 32 cm. We divided the patients into two groups according to their radiographic findings. Patients whose CRs as well as CT images noted diagnostic findings were classified in the CR-positive group. Those whose CRs were negative or nondiagnostic and whose CT images solely noted diagnostic findings consistent with pneumonia were classified in the CR-negative group. Gender, age, cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) on CRs, severity of pneumonia, level of long-term care or support, and form of feeding (oral or tube feeding) were compared between the two groups. The severity of pneumonia was evaluated with the A-DROP (age, dehydration, respiratory failure, orientation disturbance, and low blood pressure): scoring system used in Japan proposed by the Japan Respiratory Society (JRS). We evaluated patients' performance status (PS) using certified care or support level under the long-term care system in Japan. The Long-term Care Insurance Act in Japan assigns seven levels in accordance with the degree of care required for insured persons: support levels 1 and 2, and care levels 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in order. People certified to be in high-care levels such as level 4 or 5 are severely disabled or have severe dementia. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney test for quantitative variables. A value of P<.05 was considered significant. A statistical software package (MedCalc version 16.4.3, Belgium) was used for the analysis.
