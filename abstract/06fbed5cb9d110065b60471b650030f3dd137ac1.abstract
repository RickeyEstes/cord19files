Procedures for synthesizing a-amino acids on a chip for coordination with transitional metal ions and a His-Tagged protein have been successfully developed as a stable protein microarray. Using the recombinant His-Tagged 3CL-protease (3CL pro ) as a model for attachment to chips containing D D-/L L-Glu, Asp, Orn, Ser via different transitional metal ions, it was found that the Orn chip was the best of affinity binding and stability by which Zn 2+ was the best metal ion for affinity while Co 2+ was the best metal ion for stability. Thus, this protein microarray can be alternatively used as a high throughput screening method for rapid detection against SARS CoV 3CL pro and/or efficient purification of other Tagged proteins.
