Two series of 6-(1,2,3-triazolyl)-2,3-dibenzyl-L-ascorbic acid derivatives with the hydroxyethylene (8aÀ8u) and ethylidene linkers (10cÀ10p) were synthesized and evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against seven malignant tumor cell lines and antiviral activity against a broad range of viruses. Conformationally unrestricted spacer between the lactone and 1,2,3-triazole units in 8aÀ8u series had a profound effect on antitumor activity. Besides, the introduction of a long side chain at C-4 of 1,2,3triazole that led to the synthesis of decyl-substituted 2,3-dibenzyl-L-ascorbic acid 8m accounted for a selective and potent antiproliferative activity on breast cancer MCF-7 cells cells in the nM range. Further analysis showed that compound 8m strongly enhanced expression of hypoxia inducible transcription factor 1 a (HIF-1a) and to some extent decreased expression of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) suggesting its role in regulating HIF-1a signalling pathway. The p-methoxyphenyl-substituted derivative 10g displayed specific anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) potential, whereas aliphatic-substituted derivatives 8l and 8m had the most potent, yet relatively non-specific, anti-varicella-zoster (VZV) activity.
