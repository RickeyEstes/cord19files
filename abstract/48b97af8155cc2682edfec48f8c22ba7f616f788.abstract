Veterinary Microbiology, 15 {1987) 261-278 261 ABSTRACT Lamouliatte, F., Du Pasquier, P., Rossi, F, Laporte, J. and Loze, J.P., 1987. Studies on bovine Breda virus. Vet. Microbiol., 15: 261-278. Diarrheic feces from 21 calves were examined by electron microscopy and 16 contained particles morphologically similar to those of Breda virus. The particles were spherical or elongated, 60-270 nm in greatest dimension and had surface spikes 9-13 nm long. Convalescent serum from a human patient with Breda virus-associated diarrhea reacted with one of the bovine viruses by immune electron microscopy, suggesting a serological resemblance between human and bovine Breda-like viruses. Immune electron-microscopy and immunofluorescence demonstrated that isolates of bovine Breda virus from the U.S.A. were related to the French virus. One of the viruses had a density in sucrose solution of 1.16, similar to the value for Berne virus.
