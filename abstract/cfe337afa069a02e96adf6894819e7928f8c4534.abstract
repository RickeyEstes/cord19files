Background: Acquired myasthenia gravis (AMG) is increasingly recognized in cats, yet information regarding the natural history of the disease, treatment, and outcome including occurrence of immune and spontaneous remission remains limited. Objective: To determine the long-term outcome of cats with AMG without evidence of a cranial mediastinal mass (CMM). Animals: Eight cats diagnosed with AMG without evidence of a CMM. : Retrospective case series. The medical records of cats diagnosed with AMG between 2005 and 2018 from 2 veterinary referral hospitals were reviewed for inclusion. Inclusion criteria consisted of a diagnosis of AMG, thoracic imaging, serum biochemistry including measurement of creatine kinase, and a CBC. Exclusion criteria were the presence of an identifiable CMM, or administration of methimazole or carbimazole.
