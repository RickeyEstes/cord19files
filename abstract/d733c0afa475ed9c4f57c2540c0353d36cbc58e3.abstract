Sialic acids (Sias), 9-carbon-backbone sugars, are among the most complex and versatile molecules of life. As terminal residues of glycans on proteins and lipids, Sias are key elements of glycotopes of both cellular and microbial lectins and thus act as important molecular tags in cell recognition and signaling events. Their functions in such interactions can be regulated by postsynthetic modifications, the most common of which is differential Sia-O-acetylation (O-Ac-Sias). The biology of O-Ac-Sias remains mostly unexplored, largely because of limitations associated This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). with their specific in situ detection. Here, we show that dual-function hemagglutinin-esterase envelope proteins of nidoviruses distinguish between a variety of closely related O-Ac-Sias. By using soluble forms of hemagglutinin-esterases as lectins and sialate-O-acetylesterases, we demonstrate differential expression of distinct O-Ac-sialoglycan populations in an organ-, tissueand cell-specific fashion. Our findings indicate that programmed Sia-O-acetylation/de-Oacetylation may be critical to key aspects of cell development, homeostasis, and/or function. Graphical Abstract Cells are covered by a dense thicket of glycans. Though attached to proteins and lipids, these oligo-and polysaccharides are more than decoration. With a structural complexity vastly exceeding that of proteins and nucleic acids, they act as molecular tags in cell recognition and signaling events. Mammalian glycans form linear and branched chains of variable size and composition yet commonly with sialic acids (Sias) as terminal, surface-exposed residues. In consequence of this topology, Sias are key elements of the glycotopes of many regulatory cellular lectins (Crocker et al., 2007; Schauer, 2009 ). For the same reason, they have become attachment factors of choice for a range of pathogens including protozoa, fungi, bacteria, and viruses.
