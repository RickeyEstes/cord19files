Graphical Abstract Highlights d CRISPR screening identified FcRn as an essential and universal EV-B receptor d FcRn facilitates EV-B uncoating and CD55 for attachment d High-resolution Cryo-EM structures described the mechanism of virus entry d The molecular mechanism of dual (attachment versus uncoating) receptor-usage was illustrated SUMMARY a structural basis for understanding the mechanisms of enterovirus entry.
