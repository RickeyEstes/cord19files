SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that is responsible for the COVID-19 2 pandemic. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was reported recently, but its 3 transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary 4 sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the 5 SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing 6 shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous 7 recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the 8 genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses, 9 SARS-CoV-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown ORFs 10 with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA 11 sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral 12 transcripts, with the most frequent motif being AAGAA. Modified RNAs have 13 shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the 14 internal modification and the 3 ′ tail. Functional investigation of the unknown 15 ORFs and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions 16 to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. 17 Kim et al. Highlights 21 • We provide a high-resolution map of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and 22 epitranscriptome using nanopore direct RNA sequencing and DNA 23 nanoball sequencing. 24 • The transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination 25 events, both canonical and noncanonical. 26 • In addition to the genomic and subgenomic RNAs common in all 27 coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 produces transcripts encoding unknown 28 ORFs. 29 • We discover at least 41 potential RNA modification sites with an AAGAA 30 motif. 31 Kim et al. designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 34 (Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Like other coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, 35 family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae), SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped 36 virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of~30 kb. 37 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus betacoronavirus, together with SARS-CoV 38 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (with 80% and 39 50% homology, respectively) (Kim et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Coronaviruses 40 (CoVs) were thought to primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and 41 mammals. But, the recurring outbreaks of SARS, MERS, and now COVID-19 42 have clearly demonstrated the remarkable ability of CoVs to cross species 43 barriers and transmit between humans (Menachery et al., 2017). 44 CoVs carry the largest genomes (26-32 kb) among all RNA virus families 45 (Figure 1). Each viral transcript has a 5 ′ -cap structure and a 3 ′ poly(A) tail (Lai 46 and Stohlman, 1981; Yogo et al., 1977). Upon cell entry, the genomic RNA is 47 translated to produce nonstructural proteins (nsps) from two open reading 48 frames (ORFs), ORF1a, and ORF1b. The ORF1a produces polypeptide 1a (pp1a, 49 440-500 kDa) that is cleaved into 11 nsps. The −1 ribosome frameshift occurs 50 immediately upstream of the ORF1a stop codon, which allows continued 51 translation of ORF1b, yielding a large polypeptide (pp1ab, 740-810 kDa) which 52 is cleaved into 16 nsps. The proteolytic cleavage is mediated by viral proteases 53 nsp3 and nsp5 that harbor a papain-like protease domain and a 3C-like protease 54 domain, respectively. 55 The viral genome is also used as the template for replication and 56 transcription, which is mediated by nsp12 harboring RNA-dependent RNA 57 polymerase (RdRP) activity (Snijder et al., 2016; Sola et al., 2015) . 58 Negative-strand RNA intermediates are generated to serve as the templates for 59 the synthesis of positive-sense genomic RNA (gRNA) and subgenomic RNAs 60 (sgRNAs). The gRNA is packaged by the structural proteins to assemble progeny 61 virions. Shorter sgRNAs encode conserved structural proteins (spike protein (S), 62 Kim et al.
