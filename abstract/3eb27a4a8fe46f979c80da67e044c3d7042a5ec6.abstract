OC 2 H 5 O H II III 7aj S3 Scheme S1. Catalytic cycle of organo-NHC catalyzed aldol-type condensation product In the view of green chemistry, our methodology was compared with reported methodologies constructing isatin derivatives in Table 1 . Our method presented efficient E-factor and 100% atom economy from starting material to product. THF, the major solvent in our methodology showed the low or middle range scores in scoring information of solvent elicited from ACS GCI pharmaceutical roundtable consists of safety, health, air environment, water environment, and waste. In addition, our method (within 15 min at ambient temperature) could show comparative advantage in energy consumption and accident prevention. Our catalysis condition was impressive difference in loading amount and didn't require protecting group (additional protection/deprotection steps). With the mentioned merits, the most outstanding advantage of our methodology in factors of green chemistry was only renewable catalyst between each other batches among thirteen methods. 13 Calculated the E-factor and atom Economy (%) as E -Factor = Amount of waste Amount of product Amount of waste = Total amount of reactants -Amount of product (assuming that the same amount of solvents in the beginning and end of the reaction) S4
