During her recent literature review as preparation for this update, the author has noted a significant increase in both interest and literature on this topic. There are now comprehensive guidelines readily available for small animal practitioners regarding canine and feline pediatric (and adult) vaccination recommendations.

It is the practitioner's role to educate pet owners regarding actual risks associated with both undervaccination and overvaccination. The goal is to reach the highest level of overall animal health with the minimum number of adverse events, based on scientific and epidemiologic merit.
