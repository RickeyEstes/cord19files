Positive-stranded RNA (+RNA) viruses exploit host cell machinery by subverting host proteins and membranes and altering cellular pathways during infection. To achieve robust replication, some +RNA viruses, such as poliovirus (PV), build special intracellular compartments, called viral replication organelles. A recent work from the Altan-Bonnett laboratory [1] gave new insights into the formation of poliovirus replication organelles, which are unique subcellular structures containing many individual replication complexes as a result of dynamic cellular membrane remodeling. Plus-stranded +RNA viruses replicate in the host cells by recruiting a set of host factors, such as proteins, membranes and metabolites. The recruited host factors then perform novel functions to promote various steps during virus replication, including assembly of viral replicase complexes (RCs) on intracellular membranes [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The outcome of the viral infection is that many original cellular processes and pathways are "rewired" during viral infections, rendering the cells dramatically different from the uninfected ones. +RNA viruses can also induce anti-viral responses by infected host cells, leading to the activation of the innate immune responses. Altogether, viruses are successful pathogens because they can reprogram host cell metabolism to support the infection process and to suppress host defense mechanisms. OPEN ACCESS
