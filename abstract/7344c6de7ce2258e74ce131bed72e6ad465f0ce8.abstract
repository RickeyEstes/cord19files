In order to quantitatively characterize the epidemic of COVID-19, useful relations among parameters describing an epidemic in general are derived based on the Kermack-McKendrick model. The first relation is 1/τ grow =1/τ trans −1/τ inf , where τ grow is the time constant of the exponential growth of an epidemic, τ trans is the time for a pathogen to be transmitted from one patient to uninfected person, and the infectious time τ inf is the time during which the pathogen keeps its power of transmission. The second relation p(∞ ) ≈ 1− exp(− (R 0 − 1)/0.60) is the relation between p(∞ ), the final size of the disaster defined by the ratio of the total infected people to the population of the society, and the basic reproduction number, R 0 , which is the number of persons infected by the transmission of the pathogen from one infected person during the infectious time. The third relation 1/τ end =
