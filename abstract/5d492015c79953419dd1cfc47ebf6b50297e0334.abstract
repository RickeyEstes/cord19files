In the history of vaccine development, the synthetic vaccine is a milestone that is in stark contrast with traditional vaccines based on live-attenuated or inactivated microorganisms. Synthetic vaccines not only are safer than attenuated or inactivated microorganisms but also provide the opportunity for vaccine design for specific purposes. The first generation of synthetic vaccines has been largely based on DNA recombination technology and genetic manipulation. This de novo generation is occasionally time consuming and costly, especially in the era of genomics and when facing pandemic outbreaks of infectious diseases. To accelerate and simplify the R&D process for vaccines, we developed an improved method of synthetic vaccine construction based on protein assembly. We optimized and employed the recently developed SpyTag/ SpyCatcher technique to establish a protein assembly system for vaccine generation from pre-prepared subunit proteins. As proof of principle, we chose a dendritic cell (DC)-targeting molecule and specific model antigens to generate desired vaccines. The results demonstrated that a new vaccine generated in this way does not hamper the individual function of different vaccine components and is efficient in inducing both T and B cell responses. This protein assembly strategy may be especially useful for high-throughput antigen screening or rapid vaccine generation. S ince the creation of the first vaccine, for cowpox, by Edward Jenner in the late eighteenth century 1 , immunological research on vaccines has focused on deconstruction analysis, or evaluation of the importance and mechanisms of each component of a vaccine that may determine its effect. This research strategy has led to the discovery of a large, increasing number of functional elements of different categories including antigens, immune modulators and adjuvants, and delivery systems, among others 2 . A successful vaccine is usually composed of multiple elements, such as those listed above. Given the multitude of choices, the construction of different elements into an integrated, functional whole has become a new challenge in the field. Although genebased synthetic and recombinant DNA technologies provide great flexibility for construction, certain limitations still exist: (1) large fusion proteins containing multiple functional elements are occasionally technically difficult to express or purify, and (2) de novo generation is usually a tedious and long process that is especially inadequate in the face of emergent pandemics of infectious diseases, when screening and identification of antigens are crucial for vaccine development 3,4 . Facing such difficulties and demands, instead of making complex fusion-protein candidate vaccines de novo every time, it would be easier, faster, more flexible and more efficient to prepare the smaller building blocks first and then to assemble them into a whole, as needed. To achieve this goal, in the present study, we have developed a new method for synthetic vaccine construction based on a novel protein-protein conjugation technique. The SpyTag/SpyCatcher conjugation technique was recently developed based on the split protein CnaB2 from Streptococcus pyogenes 5-7 . This protein contains two fragments: one named SpyTag (13aa), and the other named SpyCatcher (138aa). Once combined under nearly any common conditions, SpyTag and SpyCatcher can rapidly and efficiently covalently conjugate to each other through an isopeptide bond 5 . We hypothesized that this conjugation technique could allow us to achieve our goal and assemble vaccines based on different pre-prepared functional components. Dendritic cell (DC) targeting has emerged as an important strategy for vaccine development due to the increasing recognition of this small population of cells in both cellular and humoral immune responses 8-13 . DEC205 is a C-type lectin endocytic receptor that is highly expressed on CD8a 1 DCs in mice 14 and on CD141 1 DCs in humans 15 . An antibody against DEC205 has been developed as a useful targeted delivery molecule. When conjugated to this antibody, an antigen can be efficiently delivered to DCs, an approach that has been found to be superior in mediating both cytotoxic T cell responses [16] [17] [18] and antibody responses 19,20 .
