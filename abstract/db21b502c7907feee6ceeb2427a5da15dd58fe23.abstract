Norman Î•. Kowal et al. Irrigation of crops with waste water will probably be widely practiced because it meets both needs simultaneously." Still more recently the U.S. General Accounting Office (1978) concluded that greater use of land application as an alternative wastewater treatment technique is needed, because it provides the benefits of (1) the elimination of point discharge to surface waters, (2) higher levels of treatment than generally provided by conventional secondary treatment, and (3) recharge of groundwaters. The GAO felt that land application techniques have not been widely used because (1) restrictive state pre treatment requirements have caused these techniques to compare unfavorably with conventional treatment alternatives, (2) lim ited technical and health effects information is available, and (3) suitable land may not be available. is the most commonly used land treatment system. Wastewater, usually pretreated by some process, is applied by sprinklers, surface flooding, or ridge-and-furrow irrigation, at a rate of between 0.6 and 6 m/yr. Soils are usually medium to fine textured with moderate permeability, and percolated water is either collected by drainage tile or reaches the groundwater. Surface vegetation has included pastures, forests, lawns and golf courses (for highly treated wastewater), but crops (usually for animal consumption) are most commonly grown. Climatic constraints may require some winter storage of wastewater (Reed, 1979). Re cycling benefits include moderate groundwater recharge and the utilization of wastewater nutrients in crop production. The objectives of these systems are usually to produce clean irrigation water (e.g., for golf course application) or highly treated water for groundwater recharge. From a wastewater treatment point of view, land application in these systems is a form of tertiary treatment or effluent "polishing", rather than true land treatment. In land treatment systems, the subject of this paper, it is assumed that raw wastewater is given only a minimum preapplication treatment, or "pretreatment", e.g., by a stabilization pond, before being applied to the land, and the land itself is the site of the major portion of the wastewater treatment. It is assumed that raw sewage will not be used for irrigation. With the application to land of large volumes of minimally pretreated wastewater, it is evident that considerable potential 13.
