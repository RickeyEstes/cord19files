Understanding and quantifying the transmission of zoonotic pathogens is essential for 24 directing public health responses, especially for pathogens capable of transmission between 25 humans. However, determining a pathogen's transmission dynamics is complicated by 26 challenges often encountered in zoonotic disease surveillance, including unobserved sources of 27 transmission (both human and zoonotic), limited spatial information, and unknown scope of 28 surveillance. In this work, we present a model-based inference method that addresses these 29 challenges for subcritical zoonotic pathogens using a spatial model with two levels of mixing. 30 After demonstrating the robustness of the method using simulation studies, we apply the new 31 method to a dataset of human monkeypox cases detected during an active surveillance program 32 from 1982-1986 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Our results provide estimates 33 of the reproductive number and spillover rate of monkeypox during this surveillance period and 34 suggest that most human-to-human transmission events occur over distances of 30km or less. 35 Taking advantage of contact-tracing data available for a subset of monkeypox cases, we find that 36 around 80% of contact-traced links could be correctly recovered from transmission trees inferred 37 using only date and location. Our results highlight the importance of identifying the appropriate 38 spatial scale of transmission, and show how even imperfect spatiotemporal data can be 39 incorporated into models to obtain reliable estimates of human-to-human transmission patterns. 40 Author Summary Surveillance datasets are often the only sources of information about the ecology and 42 epidemiology of zoonotic infectious diseases. Methods that can extract as much information as 43 possible from these datasets therefore provide a key advantage for informing our understanding 44 .

We first used simulated datasets to 47 explore which information about the disease dynamics of a subcritical zoonotic pathogen could 48 be successfully extracted from a line-list surveillance dataset with non-localized spatial 49 information and unknown geographic coverage. We then applied the method to a dataset of 50 human monkeypox cases detected during an active surveillance program in the Democratic 51 Republic of the Congo between 1982 and 1986 to obtain estimates of the reproductive number, 52 spillover rate, and spatial dispersal of monkeypox in humans. 53 [1][2] [3] [4] [5][6][7][8]. By definition, zoonotic pathogens can transmit from animals to humans; those also 58 capable of human-to-human transmission are of particular public health concern [5, 9] . Infectious 59 disease surveillance serves a crucial role for detecting and gathering information on zoonotic 60 pathogens: data obtained through surveillance are often the primary resource available for 61 informing public health management decisions [10]. Developing methods that improve our 62 ability to infer information about a pathogen's transmission dynamics from available 63 surveillance data is therefore an essential frontier for understanding and ultimately combating 64 these pathogens [11, 12]. 65 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/677021 doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 For zoonoses, three epidemiological measures are crucial for summarizing transmission 66 dynamics and informing risk assessments. The first of these is the spillover rate, which indicates 67 how frequently the pathogen is transmitted from the animal reservoir into humans and helps 68 inform the total expected disease incidence [13]. The second measure describes the pathogen's 69 potential for further spread once in the human population and is commonly assessed using the 70 reproductive number (R), which gives the average number of secondary human cases caused by 71 an infectious individual [14, 15]. Values of R greater than one indicate that the pathogen is 72 capable of sustained (i.e. 'supercritical') transmission in humans. Pathogens with subcritical 73 transmission (R less than one but greater than zero) can cause limited chains of transmission in 74 humans after a zoonotic introduction, and they pose a risk of acquiring ability for supercritical 75 transmission via evolutionary or environmental change [2,5,16]. The third epidemiological 76 measure is the distance over which human-to-human transmission occurs, which informs how 77 the disease will spread spatially and the risk of it being introduced into new populations. 78 Combined, these three measures can help evaluate the current public health threat posed by the 79 pathogen, the risk of future emergence, and the most effective approaches for disease 80 management. 81 Estimating epidemiological measures is a challenging task in any pathogen system, and 82 the unique properties of zoonotic diseases can exacerbate these difficulties. Infectious disease 83 surveillance often records temporal information and certain aspects of spatial information about 84 human cases, but the underlying transmission events are seldom observed. In a zoonotic system, 85 this means that an observed human infection could have been caused by a previous human case 86 or by zoonotic spillover. Without intensive contact tracing, or sequence data in the case of fast-87 evolving pathogens, quantifying the relative contribution of zoonotic versus human-to-human 88 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/677021 doi: bioRxiv preprint 5 transmission is a major challenge; identifying the source of infection for specific individuals is 89 an even bigger one. 90 Epidemiological analyses are often hindered by data truncation and unknown 91 denominators [17,18]. In many disease surveillance systems, the total set of localities under 92 surveillance (i.e. those that would appear in the dataset if a case occurred there) can be separated 93 into 'observed localities,' which appear in the dataset because they reported one or more cases, 94 and 'silent localities,' which have no cases during the surveillance period and therefore do not 95 appear in the dataset. This form of truncation, where localities with zero cases are absent from 96 the dataset, obscures the true scope of the surveillance effort. Without knowledge of the total 97 number of localities under observation (the 'unknown denominator'), accurately estimating the 98 spillover rate and probability of human-to-human transmission between localities is not 99 straightforward. Simply disregarding these silent localities in the analysis is the functional 100 equivalent of selectively removing zeros from the dataset and can lead to problematic inference 101 biases. 102 Complicating inference efforts further is the fact that surveillance datasets often report 103 the geographic location of cases only at a coarse resolution, obscuring information about a 104 transmission process that occurs on a much finer scale [19] [20][21]. Precise spatial information is 105 often absent from historic datasets and data collected in remote or low-resource areas, replaced 106 by the names of the locality and broader administrative units where the case occurred. For 107 example, only the village name and the region and country to which the village belongs may be 108 recorded in a dataset. Furthermore, linking a village name to spatial coordinates is often 109 impossible when maps of the region do not exist or only unofficial local names are used. 110 Although collecting exact spatial coordinates has become more practical in contemporary disease 111 .

Methods that can use this inexact spatial information 114 are especially needed for zoonotic diseases, where any additional information about the 115 proximity of human cases to one another can improve the power to distinguish between human-116 to-human transmission and zoonotic spillover. 117 Despite these challenges, a series of research efforts have expanded our ability to 118 estimate the transmission properties of zoonotic pathogens from case onset data. A key set of 119 methods revolve around inferring R from the sizes of case clusters (a cluster is defined as a group 120 of cases that occur in close spatiotemporal proximity to one another) or from the proportion of 121 observed cases that were infected by zoonotic spillover [16,[26][27][28][29][30]. However, these approaches 122 either require detailed case investigations to determine whether a case was infected by a zoonotic 123 or human source or assume that each cluster is caused by one single spillover event followed by 124 human-to-human transmission. A likelihood-based approach for estimating R for human-to-125 human transmission using only symptom onset dates of cases was introduced by Wallinga and 126 Teunis [31]. This method was extended to apply to zoonotic systems by Lo Iacono et al. [32], but 127 the extension requires that chains of exclusively human-to-human transmission can be identified, 128 and is thus not applicable to many zoonotic surveillance systems where human and zoonotic 129 transmissions are intermixed. A different approach was taken by White and Pagano [33], who 130 introduced a different likelihood-based method that compares the observed number of cases on 131 each day with the expected number, as calculated using the number and timing of previous cases. 132 Though the White and Pagano approach was only applicable to human-to-human transmission, it 133 was expanded by Kucharski et al. [34] to work in zoonotic spillover systems in scenarios where a 134 .

To make use of this form of non-localized spatial data, our 152 model considers two scales of spatial mixing and transmission (Fig 1A) , reminiscent of the 153 'epidemics with two levels of mixing' structure utilized in Ball et al. [41] and Demiris and 154 O'Neill [42]. The first mixing level is the locality in which the case occurred, such as a village, 155 conceptualized as a group of individuals geographically separated from other localities. We 156 assume that individuals within the same locality have more frequent contact with one another 157 .

To generate simulated test datasets and perform 217 parameter inference, we used a mathematical model of the zoonotic pathogen's transmission into 218 and among humans. The model tracks the number of human cases that occur in each locality on 219 each day; infections can arise from spillover from the zoonotic reservoir or from human-to-220 human transmission (Fig 1B) . Three key parameters govern the behavior of the system.
