Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T cell driven autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Despite its association with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), how viral infections promote MS remains unclear. However, there is increasing evidence that the CNS is continuously surveyed by virus-specific T cells, which protect against reactivating neurotropic viruses. Here, we discuss how viral infections could lead to the breakdown of self-tolerance in genetically predisposed individuals, and how the reactivations of viruses in the CNS could induce the recruitment of both autoaggressive and virus-specific T cell subsets, causing relapses and progressive disability. A disturbed immune surveillance in MS would explain several experimental findings, and has important implications for prognosis and therapy. MS is the most common inflammatory autoimmune disorder of the CNS [1,2]. It is characterized by the destruction of the protective myelin sheath of neurons, resulting in macroscopic lesions in the brain and causing progressive disability. MS can be subdivided into relapsing-remitting (RR), primary progressive (PP) or secondary progressive (SP; i.e., the RR subtype worsening over time to SP-MS) forms. RR-MS is the dominant form at disease onset, and is characterized by acute clinical attacks followed by apparent disease stability. Symptoms can be alleviated with several therapies, but, in some patients, there is no beneficial effect and the disease may evolve to a SP form. PP-MS and SP-MS remain difficult to treat and are also mechanistically poorly understood [3] . The etiology of MS is still unknown, but both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the risk of developing MS [1,2]. The major genetic risk factor maps to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene cluster, and the strongest risk is conferred by HLA-DRB1*15:01 in the class II region [4, 5] . The principal function of MHC class II proteins is to present peptide ligands to CD4 + [ 6 6 4 _ T D $ D I F F ] lymphocytes and these T cells are consequently believed to have a key pathogenic role in MS. However, the MHC class I cluster, which regulates cytotoxic lymphocyte responses, contains polymorphic regions that are associated with protection against MS [4] . Several other gene
