Logistically, the Hajj, the most monumental mass migration of humanity today, would challenge the most highly industrialized nations in the world. Saudi Arabia, a relatively young economy, has fostered the most enormous growth in this religious pilgrimage history has yet seen, with aggressive and rapid modernization in all aspects of Hajj planning: Hajj facilities, procedures, healthcare and policy making are all comprehensive and on an immense scale. Still, there is no sign of slowing in the growth of pilgrim attendance. As Hajj congregations grow in the order of millions, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia rises to new challenges on colossal scales with relentless drive, challenges that are the focus of this chapter discussion. Hajj is the greatest assembly of humankind on earth. More than 2.5 million Muslims attended Hajj this year (Figure 31 .1). Of these, 1.5 million were overseas visitors, 89% of whom arrived by air. The majority of the remainder (10%) arrived by land and 1% by sea. We can expect the Hajj to become bigger: Islam now is a growing religion with 1.3 billion followers of diverse ethnicity from communities within 140 countries. Over the years, not only has there been growth in numbers, but also resulting demands on planning have also increased. Umrah, a 'mini-pilgrimage' (which the Muslim can undertake at any time of the year) also involves traveling to Makkah and circumambulating the Ka'aba. The steady increase in numbers participating in Umrah throughout the calendar year demonstrate both the increased numbers of Muslims and their growing ability and willingness to travel to Makkah.
