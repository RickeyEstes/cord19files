In this study, we used pan RNA-seq analysis to reveal the ubiquitous existence of 5' end and 3' end 23 small RNAs. 5' and 3' sRNAs alone can be used to annotate mitochondrial with 1-bp resolution and nuclear 24 non-coding genes and identify new steady-state RNAs, which are usually from functional genes. Using 5', 3' 25 and intronic sRNAs, we revealed that the enzymatic dsRNA cleavage and RNAi could involve in the RNA 26 degradation and gene expression regulation of U1 snRNA in human. The further study of 5', 3' and intronic 27 sRNAs help rediscover double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) cleavage, RNA interference (RNAi) and the 28 regulation of gene expression, which challenges the classical theories. In this study, we provided a simple 29 and cost effective way for the annotation of mitochondrial and nuclear non-coding genes and the 30 identification of new steady-state RNAs, particularly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). We also provided 31 a different point of view for cancer and virus, based on the new discoveries of dsRNA cleavage, RNAi and 32 the regulation of gene expression.
