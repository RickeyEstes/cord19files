Cellular 5 0 -3 0 mRNA Exonuclease Xrn1 Controls Double-Stranded RNA Accumulation and Anti-Viral Responses Graphical Abstract Highlights d Vaccinia virus (VacV) replication requires the host Xrn1 mRNA decay enzyme d The 5 0 -3 0 mRNA exonuclease Xrn1 limits dsRNA accumulation d In the absence of Xrn1, host dsRNA-responsive innate immune defenses are activated d VacV antagonists of dsRNA-responsive host defenses are Xrn1 dependent In Brief dsRNA produced during virus infection is a potent innate immune stimulus. Burgess and Mohr show that the host mRNA exonuclease Xrn1 stimulates vaccinia virus replication by restricting dsRNA accumulation. This reveals a role for the host mRNA decay machinery in regulating dsRNA accumulation and counteracting innate anti-viral responses.
