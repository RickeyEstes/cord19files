Infection prevention Hand hygiene Environmental cleaning Central line-associated bloodstream infection Catheter-associated urinary tract infection Ventilator-associated pneumonia Emergency department The emergency department (ED) presents unique challenges to infection control and prevention. Hand hygiene is a fundamental strategy for preventing the transmission of infectious disease in health care settings. Transmission-based precautions, environmental cleaning, and appropriate reprocessing of reusable medical devices provide added layers of protection to counter the spread of infectious disease. Health care-associated infections (eg, catheter-associated urinary tract infection, ventilatorassociated pneumonia, central line-associated bloodstream infection) are often preventable but require systems-based strategies. Future research and innovation are needed to optimize infection prevention practices in the ED.
