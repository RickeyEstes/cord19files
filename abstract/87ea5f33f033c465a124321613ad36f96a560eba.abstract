Memory CD8 T cells can provide protection from re-infection by respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS. However, the relative contribution of memory CD8 T cells in providing protection against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is currently unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we utilized a prime-boost immunization approach to induce robust memory CD8 T cell responses in the absence of RSV-specific CD4 T cells and antibodies. Unexpectedly, RSV infection of mice with pre-existing CD8 T cell memory led to exacerbated weight loss, pulmonary disease, and lethal immunopathology. The exacerbated disease in immunized mice was not epitope-dependent and occurred despite a significant reduction in RSV viral titers. In addition, the lethal immunopathology was unique to the context of an RSV infection as mice were protected from a normally lethal challenge with a recombinant influenza virus expressing an RSV epitope. Memory CD8 T cells rapidly produced IFN-γ following RSV infection resulting in elevated protein levels in the lung and periphery. Neutralization of IFN-γ in the respiratory tract reduced morbidity and prevented mortality. These results demonstrate that in contrast to other respiratory viruses, RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells can induce lethal immunopathology despite mediating enhanced viral clearance. Memory CD8 T cells have been shown to provide protection against many respiratory viruses. However, the ability of memory CD8 T cells to provide protection against RSV has not been extensively examined. Unexpectedly, mice with pre-existing CD8 T cell memory, in the absence of memory CD4 T cells and antibodies, exhibited exacerbated morbidity and mortality following RSV infection. We demonstrate that the PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.immunopathology is the result of early and excessive production of IFN-γ by memory CD8 T cells in the lung. Our research provides important new insight into the mechanisms of how memory T cells induce immunopathology. In addition, our findings serve as an important cautionary tale against the use of epitope-based T cell vaccines against RSV.

The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. immunized mice were assessed for (A) survival, (B) weight loss, (C) Penh, and (D) MVb following RSV infection. (E) Lungs from naive, control, and M2 82 DC-LM-immunized mice were collected at day 5 p.i. and sections were stained for H&E. Representative images were captured at 200X magnification. Black arrows highlight a region of cellular debris and fibrin partially obstructing the alveolar duct. Red arrows highlight multifocal hyaline membranes. (F) Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) scores were determined on day 5 following infection. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of two independent experiments (n = 7 naive mice, n = 8 mice for control and M2 82 groups). Groups were compared using Student's t test for (A-D) and one-way ANOVA in (F), Ã p<0.05, ÃÃ p<0.01, ÃÃÃ p<0.001.
