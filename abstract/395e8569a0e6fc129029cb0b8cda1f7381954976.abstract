Models of host-microbe dynamics typically assume a single-host population infected by a single 21 pathogen. In reality, many hosts form multi-species aggregations and may be infected with an 22 assemblage of pathogens. We used a meta-transcriptomic approach to characterize the viromes of 23 nine avian species in the Anseriformes (ducks) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds). This revealed the 24 presence of 27 viral species, of which 24 were novel, including double-stranded RNA viruses 25 (Picobirnaviridae and Reoviridae), single-stranded RNA viruses (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, 26
