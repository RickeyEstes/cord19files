Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) contains two major open reading frames (ORFs) and the ORF2 gene encodes the major structural capsid protein. In this study, nuclear localization of ORF2 was demonstrated by fluorescence observation and subcellular fractionation assays in ORF2-transfected PK-15 cells. The subcellular localization of truncated ORF2 indicated that the 38 N-terminal amino acids were responsible for the nuclear localization of ORF2. The truncated and site-directed mutagenesis of this domain were constructed, and the results demonstrated that the basic amino acid residues at positions 8-32 were essential for the strict nuclear localization. The basic motifs 8 RRR-R-RRR 16 and 16 RRRHRRR 22 were further shown to be the key functional nucleolar localization signals that guide PCV3 ORF2 into nucleoli. Furthermore, sequence analysis showed that the amino acids of PCV3 nuclear localization signals were highly conserved. Overall, this study provides insight into the biological and functional characteristics of the PCV3 ORF2 protein. case of PCVs, the N-terminus of ORF2 is rich in basic amino acids and displays nuclear localization signals (NLSs) [14] [15] [16] . The NLS is a short stretch of amino acids that mediates the transport of nuclear proteins into the nucleus. NLS motifs play a key role in this mechanism. NLS sequences are often composed of basic amino acids and can be classified as either monopartite or bipartite motifs [17, 18] . The nuclear targeting of PCV2 ORF2 is directed by the bipartite motifs situated at the N-terminus of the proteins [14, 15] . NLSs of PCV1 ORF2 show high homologies to classical monopartite or bipartite NLS, which is essential for the complete nuclear import of PCV1 ORF2. The N-terminus of PCV1 and PCV2 ORF2 contain several conserved basic amino acid stretches [15, 19] , and shares 70.7% in nucleotide identity and 82.9% in amino acid similarity. Verification of NLS and demonstration of intracellular distribution facilitate understanding of viral protein function. The amino acids of PCV3 ORF2 are markedly different from those of the other PCVs. This led us to study the functional motifs in nuclear targeting of PCV3 ORF2. In this study, a series of recombinant plasmids expressing PCV3 ORF2 fused to EGFP were constructed, and we identified the main motifs of the NLSs mediating nuclear localization of PCV3 ORF2.
