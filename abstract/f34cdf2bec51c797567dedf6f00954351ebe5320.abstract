Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) strain MRV00304/13 was isolated from diarrheic calves. The serotype-specific antigen 1 was found to be 95% identical to that of bovine MRV1. All predicted viral proteins had >92% identity to those of MRV except 2 and 1s (80 and 72% identities, respectively), suggesting that MRV00304/13 is a novel reassortant MRV1.
