The antibiotics currently in Phase I, II and III will each be reviewed with respect to their utility and spectrum of activity. Many of these are agents for the treatment of Gram positive infections and most are new derivatives from existing antibiotic classes and thus do not provide the much needed quantum jump away from established resistance mechanisms. Consequently, over the next 5-10 years few novel antibiotics with entirely new mechanisms of action are destined to reach the clinic. Bacterial genomics has been hailed as the solution to identifying new antibacterial strategies and the tremendous impact that genomics and genomic based technologies has had on the discovery of new antibacterial targets will be illustrated. However, progressing from a novel genomics derived target to identifying a development candidate has proven to be an exceptionally challenging process, exemplified by the small number of novel mechanism agents currently in development. The complexities of delivering new antibiotics in the post genomic era will be illustrated along with perspective on potential solutions to some of the key research hurdles to enhance and facilitate the discovery of new class antibiotics. Despite the vast amount of press in professional and lay journals relating to molecular diagnostics the majority of work still carried out in clinical microbiology laboratories is based upon conventional technologies. There is a steady rise in the application of molecular techniques to the diagnosis and management of infection. There has been no single massive application of molecular technology, more an accumulation of applications in various areas which are either in trial or in day to day application being either more sensitive or cost effective than other non molecular technologies. Perhaps the most striking method which is about to influence every clinical bacteriology lab is the use of molecular technology to detect MRSA. There are a plethora of PCR based techniques for the detection of the mecA gene and other targets which identify Staphylococcus aureus or other staphylococcal species. New developments are the utilisation of the light cycler based or isothermal amplification methods. These being applied both to the characterisation of cultured staphylococci and direct detection from specimens. The theme of direct detection from specimens obviously is seductive as it offers the prospect of altering or initiating therapy much more rapidly than conventional culture methods. A notable addition is the description of a DNA probe based PCR assay for the detection of Campylobacter spp. in faeces. This assay utilises a variant of the reverse line blot as hybridisation assay which utilises immobilised oligonucleotide probes and hybridisation with a labelled PCR product from the specimen. This technology has recently found a number of applications. In the area of epidemiological typing a number of advances have been made with the application particularly in the typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains of variable number tandem repeat typing using various platforms including both DNA sequencers and DHPLC. One useful area would be the ability to use PCR typing for MRSA but a recent evaluation showed that as yet PFGE is superior. Bacterial species identification is of considerable interest and recently the application rpoB gene sequencing was found to be both sensitive and specific when applied to both mycobacteria and bacillus, enabling the rapid and definitive identification of B. anthracis and M. tuberculosis. No review would be complete without reference to SARS this year and the value and availability of rapid reverse transcriptase based DNA sequencing of the SARS coronavirus and the subsequent design of rapid PCR assays is undoubtedly helpful in the identification of cases, although the sensitivity of molecular methods does not approach that of retrospective sero conversion methods. Finally DNA and protein arrays are a potentially powerful tool within the study of pathogenicity and physiology of micro organisms. At the moment their complexity and expense rules them out from routine application in diagnostic laboratories, however, it will not be long before the first commercially based arrays are applied to areas of diagnosis from which the quantity and type of information cannot be gained by any other method.
