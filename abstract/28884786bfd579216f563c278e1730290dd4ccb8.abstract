SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, has caused a global public health emergency. 1 Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved heptatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. 2 Here, using model polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrate that the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3'fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine and AZT), to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp where they also terminate further polymerase extension. Given the 98% amino acid similarity of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. These results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anticoronavirus agents. The recent appearance of a new coronaviral infection, COVID-19, in Wuhan, China, and its worldwide spread, has made international headlines. Already more than 3,000 deaths have been ascribed to this virus, and COVID-19 has reached near pandemic status. The virus has been isolated from the lower respiratory tracts of patients with pneumonia, sequenced and visualized by electron microscopy. 1 The virus, designated SARS-CoV-2, is a new member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus, in the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, but is distinct from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. 1 The coronaviruses are single strand RNA viruses, sharing properties with other single-stranded RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), West Nile virus, Marburg virus, HIV virus, Ebola virus, dengue virus, and rhinoviruses. In particular, coronaviruses and HCV are both positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses, 3,4 and thus have a similar replication mechanism requiring a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The coronavirus life cycle has been described. 3 Briefly, the virus enters the cell by endocytosis, is uncoated, and ORF1a and ORF1b of the positive strand RNA is translated to produce nonstructural protein precursors, including a cysteine protease and a serine protease; these further cleave the precursors to form mature, functional helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A replication-transcription complex is then . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 : bioRxiv preprint sequence of the primer and template used for this extension reaction is shown at the top of the figure. Polymerase extension reactions were performed by incubating UTP with pre-assembled SARS-CoV polymerase (nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8), the indicated RNA template and primer, and the appropriate reaction buffer, followed by detection of reaction products by MALDI-TOF MS. The detailed procedure is shown in the methods. The accuracy for m/z determination is Â± 10 Da.
