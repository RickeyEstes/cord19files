1. Application of capsaicin solution onto the rat pharyngeal mucosa caused a wellreproducible increase in vascular permeability in the pharynx. 2. Capsaicin-induced pharyngeal inflammation was unaffected by a histamine Hi blocker and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, whereas dexamethasone was effective in its inhibition. 3. FK224, a dual antag~onist of tachykinin NKI and NKz receptors, and FK888, a selective antagonist of NKI receptor, significantly inhibited capsaicin-induced plasma exudation in the pharynx. 4. In capsaicinized animals, the application of capsaicin solution in the pharyngeal mucosa did not induce pharyngitis. 5. These results suggest that the mechanism of the capsaicin-induced pharyngitis primarily involves tachykinins. GEN PHARMAC 30;1:109--114, 1998.
