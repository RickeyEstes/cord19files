An Extended Signal Involved in Eukaryotic Ϫ1 Frameshifting Operates through Modification of the E Site tRNA tural element, often a pseudoknot or a stem-loop (Jacks et al., 1988). The secondary structure induces a ribosomal pause at the slippery site, and the heptamer sequence allows the slippage of ribosome bound A and P site tRNAs by one nucleotide in the 5Ј direction. The Mixte de Recherche 8621 Bâ timent 400 pause increases the probability of ribosomal movement Université Paris-Sud in the 5Ј direction, although pausing seems necessary, 91405 Orsay Cedex but not sufficient, for stimulation (Kontos et al., 2001).
