Health care settings, while providing a safe environment for patient care, are complex settings and can produce conditions that facilitate the transmission of organisms and outbreaks. First, patients are vulnerable hosts due to immunosuppressive conditions, disruptions of their skin and mucous membranes, medications, and extremes of age. Second, the facility design, the multitude of life-saving invasive procedures using complicated equipment, contamination of the hospital environment with organisms (including multidrug-resistant organisms), the close proximity of patients who harbor transmissible organisms, and frequent contact with health care personnel, who can themselves transmit organisms, can provide an ideal environment for the propagation of an infectious agent.

KEYWORDS Outbreaks Health care settings Sources of outbreaks Evaluation Review Outbreaks and pseudo-outbreaks that occur in health care settings should be approached systematically using advanced laboratory testing and epidemiologic tools to guide evaluation of events and to determine course of action. Multiple sources, such as health care personnel, the health care environment, supplies and equipment, and potable water, have been associated with outbreaks. Multiple organisms, such as atypical mycobacteria, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and fungal species have been associated with outbreaks in health care settings. Certain settings, including the neonatal intensive care unit, endoscopy, oncology, and transplant units, have specific issues that impact the approach to investigation and control of outbreaks in these settings.
