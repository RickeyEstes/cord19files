Mutation rates can evolve through genetic drift, indirect selection due to genetic hitchhiking, or 28 direct selection on the physicochemical cost of high fidelity. However, for many systems, it has 29 been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an 30 observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their 31 extremely high mutation rates are advantageous, because they may allow for increased 32 adaptability. This argument has profound implications, as it suggests that pathogenesis in many 33 viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here we present data for an alternative 34 model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for 35 increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3D G64S , has a significant 36 replication defect and that wild type and 3D G64S populations have similar adaptability in two 37 distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3D G64S under r-selection led to 38 reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3D G64S exhibited 39 delayed morbidity at doses well above the LD 50 , consistent with attenuation by slower growth as 40 opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3D G64S growth defect 41 restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent 42 with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more 43 important than accuracy. In contrast to what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find 44 that within host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic 45 diversity. 46 47 3 mutation rates. Since most mutations are deleterious and mutation rates are tuned by natural 53 selection, we asked why hasn't the virus evolved to have a lower mutation rate? We used 54 experimental evolution and a murine infection model to show that RNA virus mutation rates may 55 actually be too high and are not necessarily adaptive. Rather, our data indicate that viral 56 mutation rates are driven higher as a result of selection for viruses with faster replication kinetics. We suggest that viruses have high mutation rates, not because they facilitate adaption, but 58 because it is hard to be both fast and accurate. 59 60 Introduction 61 Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation, and mutation rates can have a significant 62 impact on evolutionary rate [1-3]. The intraspecific variability in mutation rate in many viruses 63 and bacteria indicates that mutation rates have been optimized by natural selection [4-13]. Given that most mutations are deleterious, the burden of excess mutational load will select 65 against strains with abnormally high mutation rates [14][15][16][17]. This principle led to Sturtevant to 66 ask, "Why does the mutation rate not evolve to zero?" [18,19]. A large body of theoretical and experimental work suggests that the selective pressure for 69 higher mutation rates is due to either the physicochemical cost of maintaining a lower one or a 70 selective advantage from an increased supply of beneficial mutations [20-23]. Many have 71 argued for the adaptive benefit of high mutation rates in pathogenic microbes, which often exist 72 in dynamic environments and are subject to host immune pressure [7,24,25]. However, direct 73 selection of a variant with a higher mutation rate will only occur if it has been advantageous in 74 the past, and in many cases, it has been difficult to separate the causes of a higher mutation 75 rate from its consequences [19,26]. 76 77 .

While 78 interspecific mutation rates range from 10 -4 to 10 -6 errors per nucleotide copied [4], studies of 79 antimutators and hypermutators suggests that fidelity can only vary by several fold within a 80 species [27]. The severe burden of mutational load exerts a strong downward pressure on 81 mutation rates and hypermutator strains are attenuated in vivo [9,28-31]. Given the short 82 generation times and remarkable fecundity of many RNA viruses, a small kinetic cost to higher 83 fidelity should result in strong selection against antimutators [32,33]. However, the observed 84 attenuation of antimutator RNA viruses in vivo has led many to argue for the adaptive benefit of 85 high mutation rates, as genetic diversity provides a rich substrate for a virus' evolution in the 86 face of varying intrahost environments [7,10,34-38]. This concept is central to viral quasispecies 87 theory, which generally proposes a link between genetic diversity and viral fitness [24,25]. Here, we define the selective forces that shape viral mutation rates by studying an antimutator 90 variant. The 3D G64S mutant of poliovirus was selected after serial passage in ribavirin, an RNA 91 virus mutagen. The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, 3D) of this variant contains a 92 single glycine to serine substitution [5-7]. The basal mutation rate of 3D G64S is reported to be 93 ~20-30% that of wild type virus (WT). While the 3D G64S mutant is attenuated in poliovirus 94 receptor transgenic mice, the relative importance of replicative speed and fidelity to this 95 phenotype is not clear [7,36]. Biochemical assays of 3D G64S suggest a physicochemical cost of 96 high fidelity, but as in other systems, its contribution to overall fitness remains unquantified 97 [6,19,39]. 99 Results We measured the relative fitness of 3D G64S by direct competition over serial passage by RT-101 qPCR (Fig. 1A) . Here, the fitness of 3D G64S is 0.78 ± 0.01 (n=3 replicates) relative to WT. This is 102 a moderate fitness defect, falling in the 64 th percentile in a dataset of 8970 fitness values 103 .

We also measured the relative growth properties 105 of WT and 3D G64S using a plaque size assay, which measures the growth, burst size, and 106 spread of individual viruses in the absence of competition [40][41][42]. The distribution of clonal 107 plaque sizes was significantly different (p<0.005, unpaired t-test with Welch correction, n=272 108 WT and n=220 3D G64S plaques), and consistent with a moderate fitness defect in 3D G64S (Fig.   109 1C). In contrast to prior work, we were able to detect a significant replication defect for 3D G64S by 110 one step growth curve, but only with rigorous synchronization, more frequent time points, and 111 larger numbers of replicates (Fig. 1D ). This replication defect was not specific to HeLa, as we 112 observed a similar lag for 3D G64S in a 3T3 cell line that we derived from mouse embryonic 113 fibroblasts from poliovirus receptor transgenic mice (PVR-3T3, Fig. 1E ). These data 114 demonstrate that the fitness defect of 3D G64S is largely attributable to its slower replicative 115 kinetics and is consistent with biochemical assays on purified RdRp [6,39]. The reduced mutation rate and replicative fitness of 3D G64S suggest a trade-off between speed 118 and fidelity in RNA virus replication. Here, the fitness gain from increased replicative speed is 119 offset by a reduction in fitness due to increased mutational load. We derived a quantitative 120 model of this trade-off (see SI Model 1) by measuring the replicative fitness (Fig. 1F ) and 121 mutation rate (Fig. 1G, Table S1 ) of WT and 3D G64S under exposure to an exogenous mutagen, 122 ribavirin [43]. Wild type and 3D G64S had equal fitness at approximately 150µM ribavirin. Based 123 on these data, our model indicates that WT incurs a fitness cost of 0.137 from mutational load 124 alone. Therefore, any fitness benefit of the high baseline mutation rates in WT would 125 presumably need to offset this cost. In 3D G64S , the cost of mutational load is reduced to 0.037. If viral RdRp are constrained by a speed-fidelity trade-off, selection for increased replicative 128 speed (r-selection) will increase mutation rate. We subjected the 3D G64S-1nt point mutant
