CI = confidence interval; EBV = Epstein-Barr virus; FEV 1 = forced expiratory volume in 1 second; NNT = number needed to treat; PaO 2 = arterial partial pressure of oxygen; RR = relative risk; SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome. Traditional teaching suggests that corticosteroids should be avoided during acute infectious episodes for fear of compromising the immune response. However, the outcome benefit shown through steroid administration in early septic shock implies this paranoia may be misplaced. We therefore performed a systematic review of the literature to identify the current strength of evidence for the use of corticosteroids in specified infections, and to make appropriate graded recommendations.
