Three groups of calves (n = 5 per group) were fed 1% pooled colostrum supplements (birth to 7days of age) from BRV seropositive cows vaccinated with recombinant SAll (P[2/G3) rotavinus-like particles (VLPs), recombinant SAll rotavirus core-like particles (CLPs), or inactivated SAll rotavirus (SAll). Control calves (n = 5 per group) received either pooled colostrum from unvaccinated (BRV field exposure seropositive) control cows, or no colostrum. IgGl antibody titers to IND BRV for the pooled colostrum were: 1048576 (VLP); 1048576 (CLP); 262144 (SAlI); and 16384 (control colostrum). Elevated titers of BRV neutralizing (VN) antibodies were present in VLP colostrum (98000), and SAll colostrum (25000), but not in CLP colostrum (1400), compared to colostrum j?om nonvaccinates (2081). Calves were orally inoculated with virulent INL) BRV at 2 days of age and challenged at post-inoculation day (PID) 21. Calves were monitored daily for diarrhea and faecal BRV shedding through PID 10 and post-challenge day (PCD) 10. After colostrum feeding, the IgGl antibody titers were highest in serum and faeces of calves fed VLP and CLP colostrum, but VN and IgA antibodies were highest in calves fed VLP colostrum. After BRV inoculation, calves fed colostrum from vaccinated cows had significantly fewer days of BRV-associated diarrhea and BRV shedding than control calves. All calves fed VLP colostrum were protected from diarrhea after BRV inoculation; two calves shed BRK In the CLP colostrum group, one calf developed BRVassociated diarrhea and all calves shed virus. In the SAll colostrum group, three calves developed BRVassociated diarrhea and four calves shed virus. BRV-associated diarrhea and shedding occurred in 9 of 10 control calves. Active IgM antibody responses occurred in faeces and/or serum of most calves after BRV inoculation. However; the highest active antibody responses (Igh4 and IgGl in serum, and IgM, IgGl or &A in faeces) after BRV inoculation were in calves fed control or no colostrum, in association with clinical diarrhea in most of these calves. After challenge at PID 21, BRV-associated diarrhea and shedding were of short duration or absent, in all groups. These results demonstrate the efJicacy of colostrum from VLP vaccinated cows to provide heterologous, passive protection against BRV diarrhea and shedding in calves. In comparison, calves fed CLP or SAll colostrum were only partially protected against BRV diarrhea or shedding. 0 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved
