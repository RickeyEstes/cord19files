tRNA delivery by L11-tRNA smFRET. Typical real-time TC delivery traces measured using Cy3-R and Cy5-L11 (A) or Cy3-F and Cy5-L11 (B), for ribosomes programmed with mPL in the absence of EF-G·GTP. Cy3 fluorescence (Green) and sensitized emission of Cy5 (FRET, Blue) were collected under 532 nm excitation. Preformed POST E (1) or POST R (4) with Cy5-L11 were immobilized in flow chambers in A and B, respectively. Camera recording was started 5 seconds prior to injection of Cy3 labeled tRNA TC and continued for 1 minute at 33 ms integration time per frame. Dwell time distributions of POST E complexes (C, 1) and POST R complexes (D, 4) were measured from the injection until the appearance of steady Cy3 and FRET intensities. (E and F). Apparent tRNA delivery rates of Cy3-R and Cy3-F, respectively, from single exponential fitting (black curves) of dwell times of POST E (C) and POST R (D) complexes. Error bars are S.E.M.s, n ≥ 104. Supplementary Figure 2 FRET transition density map constructed from L1-tRNA FRET measurements with mRNA mPL. The map is a two-dimensional density plot of transitions identified by a Hidden Markov Modeling algorithm (HaMMy), indicating FRET efficiencies before vs. after each transition. This plot demonstrates that FRET transitions are unidirectional, as from 0.07 to 0.66, from 0.66 to 0.40, and from 0.40 to 0.78, which were assigned to complexes 2 → 3, 3 → 4-5, and 4-5 → 6 as explained in the main text. Supplementary Figure 3 L1-tRNA FRET probability density plots as a function of time for L1-tRNA FRET traces recorded from mRNA mPL with 50 nM Phe TC (A), mPL with 5 nM Phe TC (B), and mPK with 50 nM Phe TC (C). All traces are aligned to the beginning of the last FRET state (mean 0.78) as t = 0. Decreasing concentration of Phe TC (A vs. B) mainly increases the dwell time of the 0.40 and 0.66 FRET states; whereas the pseudoknot mRNA (C) structure mainly increases the dwell time of the 0.78 FRET state. A multiple turnover tRNA-tRNA FRET recording, in which the ribosome follows the 2-1-2 pathway. ALEX fluorescence traces were collected after injecting 10 nM Cy3-R, Cy5-F, and Cy5-V ternary complexes, 50 nM unlabeled Y and E ternary complexes, 2 µM EF-G, and 2 mM GTP into a flow chamber containing immobilized ribosomes programmed with mRNA mPL. Different complexes, formed by tRNA association and dissociation, as indicated by changes of Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence intensity, are marked by arrows. Note that Cy3-R dissociated before Cy5-V bound indicating the 2-1-2 pathway 1 .
