Case 11-1 (Figure 11-1)  RockN'Roll, a 12-year-old Thoroughbred mare, foaled uneventfully at approximately 4 PM on April 14, 2004. '03 RockN'Roll stood within two hours of delivery and nursed. He passed meconium at approximately four hours of age, and he seemed bright and alert. On the morning of April 15, the owners found the foal straining to defecate. The local veterinarian was called for further evaluation and found a quiet but alert foal with a normal rectal temperature and heart rate. Meconium staining was noted on the tail. Gastrointestinal sounds were audible on both sides of the abdomen. A digital rectal examination was performed, and firm meconium was palpable in the rectal ampulla. A nasogastric tube was passed. No reflux was obtained, thus 30 ml of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS) was given. In addition, 50 mg of flunixin meglumine was given intravenously and a DSS and water enema was administered. The foal continued to strain and was intermittently recumbent, prompting referral to the University of Georgia's Veterinary Teaching Hospital. At the time of presentation, '03 RockN'Roll was approximately 26 hours old. The foal was quiet, but tracked the mare well and was interested in nursing. The abdomen was slightly distended, and meconium staining was present on the tail and perineum. Shortly after admission, the foal was observed to raise his tailhead and strain Intermittent straining, as well as flank biting, continued. The foal then became recumbent and rolled up onto his back. There were no other significant physical findings. The major problems identified were straining to defecate, mild abdominal distension, acute abdominal pain (colic), and firm feces at the pelvic inlet.
