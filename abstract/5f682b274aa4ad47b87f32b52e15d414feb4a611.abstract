Visitor restriction policies are meant to prevent health care-acquired viral infections; however, data on their efficacy in hospitalized children are limited. We report a 37% reduction in health care-acquired respiratory viral infections in a children's hospital following standardization of the visitation policy that limited the number of visitors during a patient's hospitalization. Health care-acquired respiratory viral infections in critically ill children have been associated with adverse medical outcomes and increased health care costs. 1-4 Visitor restriction policies are implemented as part of multifaceted approaches to reduce health careacquired infection, especially in high-risk areas such as intensive care units (ICUs), bone marrow transplant wards, and oncology wards. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] There are limited data, however, on the efficacy of these restrictions in the reduction of health care-related respiratory viral transmission. The purpose of this study was to describe the incidence of health care-acquired respiratory viral infections following changes to the visitation policy at a pediatric quaternary care hospital.
