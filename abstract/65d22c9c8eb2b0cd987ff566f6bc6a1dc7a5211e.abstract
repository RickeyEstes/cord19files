These genes are therefore particularly interesting, con-660 South Euclid Avenue St. Louis, Missouri 63110 sidering that nonessential accessory genes from a wide array of viruses function to circumvent host innate and adaptive immune responses (Alcami and Koszinowski, 2000; Ploegh, 1998). Summary In this study, we examine the product of the SARS-CoV accessory gene ORF 7a (Snijder et al., 2003) (also The open reading frame (ORF) 7a of the SARS-associknown as ORF 8 or X4) (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., ated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes a unique type 2003) . Sequence analysis predicts that ORF 7a en-I transmembrane protein of unknown function. We codes a type I transmembrane protein, 122 amino acids have determined the 1.8 Å resolution crystal structure in length, consisting of a 15 residue N-terminal signal of the N-terminal ectodomain of orf7a, revealing a peptide, an 81 residue luminal domain, a 21 residue compact seven-stranded ␤ sandwich unexpectedly transmembrane segment, and a 5 residue cytoplasmic similar in fold and topology to members of the Ig sutail. Although the orf7a sequence has been identified in perfamily. We also demonstrate that, in SARS-CoVall isolates of SARS-CoV collected from both human infected cells, the orf7a protein is expressed and reand animal sources, it appears to be unique to SARS, tained intracellularly. Confocal microscopy studies displaying no significant similarity to any other viral or using orf7a and orf7a/CD4 chimeras implicate the nonviral protein. Here, we examine the orf7a accessory short cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain in protein in an attempt to clarify its biological signifitrafficking of the protein within the endoplasmic reticcance and evaluate its potential as a therapeutic target. ulum and Golgi network. Taken together, our findings Using an E. coli expression system, we have successprovide a structural and cellular framework in which fully produced the luminal domain of orf7a as soluble to explore the role of orf7a in SARS-CoV pathoprotein by oxidative refolding.

Current evidence suggests the virus emerged from nonhuman sources (Guan Results et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2003), possibly as a recombination event between mammalian-like and avian-like parent Production of Soluble Refolded Orf7a Protein We initiated our studies of orf7a by cloning a cDNA viruses (Rest and Mindell, 2003; Stanhope et al., 2004; Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004). fragment encoding the mature N-terminal ectodomain into a bacterial expression vector.
