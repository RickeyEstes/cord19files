Natural disasters are destructive forces of nature that severely affect human lives as well as the environment. Catastrophic health emergencies including human-made and natural disasters usually result in mass casualties that require hospitals to increase capacity. 1,2 However, to increase capacity and provide quality patient care, facilities must have adequate staffing. Researchers have shown that health care professionals (HCP), including nurses, physicians, and dentists, feel responsible for responding to disasters; however, these same studies indicate that approximately 40% of health care professionals reported that they would not respond during health emergencies. 3, 4 Nurses' intent to respond to disasters is a topic that has not been exhaustively researched. It is prudent to understand nurses' intent to respond, as the capacity of hospitals is directly related to the number of staff nurses available to care for the influx of patients during disasters. 5 Because nurses are invaluable to disaster response efforts, more research is necessary to validate findings of recent studies and clarify the needs of nurses who respond to disasters and other health emergencies. Existing literature does not adequately describe the needs of nurses while working during disaster situations, nor is it clear why nurses do or do not respond. Further complicating nursing's response to emergencies is the influence of the nursing shortage and the identified lack of education preparing nurses for disaster response, making these recommended areas for further exploration. 6 The purpose of this article is to provide a critique of published works that are representative of research studies that have explored disaster preparedness related to nursing. In addition, rationale for conducting future research in the area of nurses' experiences of intent to respond and working during major disasters is discussed. An extensive review of the literature was completed using health care literature databases including The author has nothing to disclose.
