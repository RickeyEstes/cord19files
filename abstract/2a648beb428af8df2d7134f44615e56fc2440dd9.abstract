Highlights d Intranasal but not subcutaneous vaccination protects mice from pathogenic human CoVs d Protection is mediated by airway memory CD4 + T cells d IFN-g produced by airway memory CD4 + T cells is required for protection d A conserved epitope in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV induces cross-reactive T cell responses SUMMARY MERS-CoV-have crossed species to cause severe human respiratory disease. Here, we showed that induction of airway memory CD4 + T cells specific for a conserved epitope shared by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is a potential strategy for developing pancoronavirus vaccines. Airway memory CD4 + T cells differed phenotypically and functionally from lungderived cells and were crucial for protection against both CoVs in mice. Protection was dependent on interferon-g and required early induction of robust innate and virus-specific CD8 + T cell responses. The conserved epitope was also recognized in SARS-CoV-and MERS-CoV-infected human leukocyte antigen DR2 and DR3 transgenic mice, indicating potential relevance in human populations. Additionally, this epitope was cross-protective between human and bat CoVs, the progenitors for many human CoVs. Vaccine strategies that induce airway memory CD4 + T cells targeting conserved epitopes might have broad applicability in the context of new CoVs and other respiratory virus outbreaks.
