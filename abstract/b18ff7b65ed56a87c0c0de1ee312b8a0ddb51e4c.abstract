Small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein α (SGTA) has been implicated as a co-chaperone and regulator of androgen and growth hormone receptor (AR, GHR) signalling. We investigated the functional consequences of partial and full Sgta ablation in vivo using Cre-lox Sgtanull mice. Sgta +/− breeders generated viable Sgta −/− offspring, but at less than Mendelian expectancy. Sgta −/− breeders were subfertile with small litters and higher neonatal death (P < 0.02). Body size was significantly and proportionately smaller in male and female Sgta −/− (vs WT, Sgta +/− P < 0.001) from d19. Serum IGF-1 levels were genotype-and sex-dependent. Food intake, muscle and bone mass and adiposity were unchanged in Sgta −/− . Vital and sex organs had normal relative weight, morphology and histology, although certain androgen-sensitive measures such as penis and preputial size, and testis descent, were greater in Sgta −/− . Expression of AR and its targets remained largely unchanged, although AR localisation was genotype-and tissue-dependent. Generally expression of other TPRcontaining proteins was unchanged. In conclusion, this thorough investigation of SGTA-null mutation reports a mild phenotype of reduced body size. The model's full potential likely will be realised by genetic crosses with other models to interrogate the role of SGTA in the many diseases in which it has been implicated. Small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing protein α (SGTA) belongs to a family of molecular co-chaperone proteins that possess a TPR motif. This motif, when arrayed in tandem, forms a protein-protein interaction module capable of facilitating interactions with a diverse range of client proteins (as reviewed in refs 1-3). Since its discovery 15 years ago 4 , SGTA has been implicated in a myriad of biological processes 1 including cell cycle and apoptosis 5 , viral assembly and release 4,6-9 , hormone signalling 5,10-17 , intracellular compartmentalization 10,11 , neuronal synaptic transmission 18 and the post-translational transport [19] [20] [21] [22] and modification 17,23 of proteins. Due to its broad pattern of tissue expression 1,24,25 (Suppl Fig. 1A ,B) and its engagement in many biological processes, SGTA has been implicated in many diseases including cancer of the prostate 10,26 , ovary 27 , liver 28 and oesophagus 29 ; hormone-related polycystic ovary syndrome 30 ; and amyloid-related Alzheimer's 18 and prion 31 diseases. Given the overarching cellular role of SGTA in co-chaperoning client proteins to ensure their correct folding, trafficking and/or appropriate subcellular movement in the aforementioned biological processes 1 , it is surprising that its essential normal biological functions remain uncharacterised. Throughout evolution SGTA, and in particular its TPR motif, has remained conserved 4,6,10,11,14,32 , with orthologs to human Sgta detected in Caenorhabditis elegans 32 , Drosophila melanogaster 33 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 32 . SGTA is ubiquitously expressed in human and murine tissues, with M. musculus SGTA exhibiting 83% and 88% identity to human SGTA at the mRNA and protein levels, respectively, with similar distribution of functional domains (Suppl Fig. 1D-F) . Knockdown of SGTA in vitro can impair cellular proliferation (NBE, HeLa, C4-2B cells), reduce cell viability (C4-2B cells) 26 and promote cell death (NBE, HeLa cells) 5, 34 . No study to date has reported the effect of SGTA ablation in vivo. Given that SGTA is expressed in early development 35 and has a ubiquitous co-chaperoning role, we aimed to determine the physiological importance of SGTA in vivo by assessing the effect of SGTA ablation on normal development and fecundity in mice. Sgta −/− Mice are Viable but Tended to Exhibit Reduced Perinatal Viability. Sgta +/− breeders were overtly normal in appearance and were fertile, with time to litter comparable to Sgta-intact animals, and viable offspring representing all possible genotypes (Sgta −/− , Sgta +/− and WT) were produced (Table 1) . Gross phenotypic inspection of offspring indicated that all were visibly normal. Sgta +/− breeders yielded litters of normal size, with unchanged neonatal mortality rate, as compared to Sgta-intact litters (Table 1) . However, the Mendelian ratio of inheritance was altered in progeny from Sgta +/− matings; irrespective of gender, Sgta −/− pups tended to be less frequently observed than the expected ratio (22.49% vs expected 25%, P = 0.095). However, when separated by sex this was most pronounced for female Sgta −/− pups (18.80% vs 25.76% for males, compared to expected 25%), suggesting that female Sgta −/− mice were less viable during the perinatal period. Sex ratios did not deviate from normal (1.06M: 0.94F vs expected 1M: 1F, P = 0.38). Having determined that Sgta −/− mice are viable, we next characterised the functional consequence of the Sgta disruption. The Cre/Lox knockout strategy used in this study (Fig. 1A) involved floxing exons 4 and 5 of M. musculus Sgta for disruption by Cre. In silico analysis of the knockout strategy demonstrated that in the case that a stable mRNA species was transcribed, SGTA would be truncated at the TPR domain, generating a novel 27 amino acid sequence, followed by a stop codon, theoretically producing a 96 amino acid-long protein devoid of TPR-motifs (Fig.
