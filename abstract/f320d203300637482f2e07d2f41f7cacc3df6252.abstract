The structures of three new compounds were identified by analyzing their NMR spectroscopic and HRESIMS data. Compounds 4, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 17, [21] [22] [23] were isolated from T. regelii for the first time. Compounds 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14 and 16 showed inhibitory effects on the proliferation of human breast cancer cells MCF-7 by 24.1%, 69.6%, 72.8%, 21.6%, 23.1%, 43.3%, 25.5% and 23.5% (p b 0.05) at a concentration of 10 Î¼M, respectively.
