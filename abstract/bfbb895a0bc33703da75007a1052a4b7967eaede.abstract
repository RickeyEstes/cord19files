A 2-year-old female domestic shorthair cat was referred with a 2 month history of lethargy, weight loss, recurrent hyperthermia and polyarthropathy despite prednisolone. Upon physical examination, the cat showed apathy, hyperthermia, multiple appendicular joint pain and swelling. The CBC showed severe macrocytic normochromic non-regenerative anemia and thrombocytopenia. A population of immature large granular lymphocytes (LGL) was noted on blood smear. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (LNs), hyper echoic liver and splenomegaly. Cytology of fine needle aspirate of synovial fluid, spleen, liver, enlarged abdominal LNs and bone marrow supported a diagnosis of LGL leukemia with concurrent articular infiltration.
