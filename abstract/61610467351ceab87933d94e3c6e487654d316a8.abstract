The de novo and ancestral genes can be identified with the greatest reliability under three conditions: a) the de novo gene is restricted to a monophyletic clade (the focal clade), whereas the ancestral gene is found throughout this clade but also in an outgroup clade; b) all the de novo genes within the focal clade share significant sequence similarity; c) the overlapping regions of the ancestral genes share significant sequence similarity within the focal clade but also with the outgroup taxa. These conditions were met for most the overlaps used in our analysis. We explain below our approach to identify the de novo and ancestral genes in overlaps where these conditions were not met. Figure S1 presents a case in which some genes are demonstrably de novo and occur within the same clade but have no statistical significant similarity with each other. All of the ancestral genes (red arrows) share significant sequence similarity over the overlapping region. The two de novo genes represented by blue arrows have similar sequences. The de novo gene of taxon T3 (black arrow) does not have significant sequence similarity to the other two taxa (T1 and T2). Because the three de novo genes form a monophyletic clade and have the same genomic location, we infer that the black gene is homologous to the blue genes but that its sequence has diverged beyond recognition. Therefore, we included all three taxa in the clade and deduced the Last Common Ancestor (LCA) of the de novo gene at the branch leading to the three taxa (marked by a blue circle). The alternative scenario, i.e. that the blue and the black genes
