Natural compounds are becoming popular for the treatment of illnesses and health promotion, but the mechanisms of action and safety profiles are often unknown. Xyloketal B (XKB) is a novel marine compound isolated from the mangrove fungus Xylaria sp., with potent antioxidative, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects. However, its molecular targets and effects on drug-metabolizing enzymes are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the potential molecular targets of XKB using bioinformatic approaches and to examine the effect of XKB on the expression and activity of rat cytochrome P450 3a (Cyp3a) subfamily members using midazolam as a model probe. DDI-CPI, a server that can predict drug-drug interactions via the chemical-protein interactome, was employed to predict the targets of XKB, and the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was used to analyze the pathways of the predicted targets of XKB. Homology modeling was performed using the Discovery Studio program 3.1. The activity and expression of rat hepatic Cyp3a were examined after the rats were treated with XKB at 7 and 14 mg/kg for 8 consecutive days. Rat plasma concentrations of midazolam and its metabolite 1′-OH-midazolam were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Bioinformatic analysis showed that there were over 324 functional proteins and 61 related signaling pathways that were potentially regulated by XKB. A molecular docking study showed that XKB bound to the active site of human cytochrome P450 3A4 and rat Cyp3a2 homology model via the formation of hydrogen bonds. The in vivo study showed that oral administration of XKB at 14 mg/kg to rats for 8 days significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of midazolam, with a concomitant decrease in the plasma clearance and AUC ratio of 1′-OH-midazolam over midazolam. Further, oral administration of 14 mg/kg XKB for 8 days markedly reduced the activity and expression of hepatic Cyp3a in rats. Taken together, the results show that XKB could regulate networks of molecular proteins and related signaling pathways and that XKB downregulated hepatic Cyp3a in rats. XKB might cause drug interactions through modulation of the activity and expression of Cyp3a members. More studies are warranted to confirm the mechanisms of action of XKB and to investigate the underlying mechanism for the regulating effect of XKB on Cyp3a subfamily members.

In particular, there is a lack of data on molecular targets, mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics (PKs, mainly focused on absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion [ADME]), and toxicology for most natural products. 2,3 On the other hand, many of the natural products have the ability to regulate important drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, such as the cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) and P-glycoprotein. This has raised a safety concern regarding the use of natural products due to their modulatory effect on the activity and expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, resulting in potentially harmful drug interactions and eventually adverse drug reactions. 4 Human CYPs are a superfamily consisting of 57 functional genes that oxidize over 95% of the drugs in clinical use. 5,6 The human CYP3A subfamily contains four members, with CYP3A4 being the most abundant enzyme in the liver and intestine. 5 Importantly, CYP3A4/5 is predisposed to induction and inhibition when exposed to a number of endogenous and exogenous factors, probably resulting in an altered PK profile of the victim drug and adverse drug reactions, in particular, for those drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, such as digoxin, warfarin, and carboplatin. 7,8 The rat Cyp3a subfamily contains Cyp3a1, 3a2, 3a9, and 3a62. Both rat Cyp3a1 and 3a2 have 72% identity in amino acid sequence to human CYP3A4 and share a lot of substrate specificity and inhibitor selectivity with CYP3A4. 9,10 Cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as coronary heart disease and stroke, is the leading cause of death throughout the world. About 17.3 million people died from CVD in 2008, accounting for 30% of all global deaths. 11, 12 Of these, about 7.3 million deaths resulted from coronary heart disease and 6.2 million deaths were due to stroke. 11,12 The incidence of CVD is increasing, exposing individuals, family, and society to a great burden. The pathogenesis of CVD is complicated, and oxidative stress has been proposed to be a causal factor in the pathogenesis. 13,14 Reducing oxidative stress has been reported to be a promising strategy for the treatment of CVD. 13 A number of natural products show potent antioxidative effects, and coadministration of natural products with cardiovascular drugs has gained increasing popularity because of these effects, although there is a lack of systematic preclinical and clinical data on their PKs, molecular targets, mechanisms of action, and toxicology. 15, 16 Marine organisms are an attractive source for drug development. Numerous compounds have been isolated from marine organisms, with a wide range of pharmacological activity, including antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. 17-18 Xyloketal B (XKB, Figure 1)  Ketoconazole Midazolam Probucol Xyloketal B Following target prediction, the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery version 6.7 (DAVID, http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) was used to provide a biological functional interpretation of the potential targets of XKB derived from DDI-CPI. The protein IDs of these targets from UniProtKB, National Center for Biotechnology Information, and other sources were converted into gene lists by using the Gene ID conversion tool in DAVID. DAVID adds biological function annotation including gene ontology, pathway, proteinprotein interactions, functional groups of genes (ie, clustering), and disease associations derived from main public data sources. The genes of interest were visualized using BioCarta and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway maps. The highest classification stringency was selected for functional annotation clustering. Enrichment scores and Fisher's Exact test P-values (and the corresponding false discovery rate) were then calculated to identify which functional-related gene groups are significantly enriched in the target list. These significant enriched gene groups could provide clues on how XKB interacts with molecular targets in a systematic way.

After ligand preparation, XKB, midazolam, ketoconazole, and probucol were docked into the active sites of the human CYP3A4 and rat Cyp3a2 homology model. Electrostatic energy and van der Waals forces were considered during the docking process. A harmonic potential with a force constant of 300 kcal/mol was applied outside the grid boundary. 28 Prediction of ADME and toxicity of XKB, midazolam, ketoconazole, and probucol Using the Discovery Studio program 3.1 designed by Accelrys Inc, the ADME and toxicity (ADMET) profiles of XKB, midazolam, ketoconazole, and probucol were predicted. Briefly, the chemical structures of XKB, midazolam, ketoconazole, and probucol were retrieved from the PubChem database ( Figure 1 ). All the structures were introduced into the Discovery Studio program and prepared. During preparation of these structures, the duplicate chemical structures were deleted and the ionization change, tautomer or isomer generation, Lipinski filter, and three-dimensional generator were all set true. Following preparation of the structures, XKB, midazolam, ketoconazole, and probucol were subject to ADMET evaluation using the ADMET Predictor module. Parameters including solubility, absorption, permeability across the blood-brain barrier, interactions with CYP2D6, hepatotoxicity, and plasma protein binding were predicted. There are four different ADMET absorption levels, ranging from 0, 1, 2, to 3, indicating good, moderate, low, and very low absorption, respectively. The ADMET aqueous solubility level is classi-
