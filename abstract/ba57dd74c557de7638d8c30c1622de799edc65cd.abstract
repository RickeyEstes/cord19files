With cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurring across geographic regions, data collection on the effectiveness of intervention strategies should be standardized to facilitate analysis. We propose a minimum dataset to capture data needed to examine the basic reproduction rate, case status and criteria, symptoms, and outcomes of SARS. F irst detected in China, confirmed and probable cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have now appeared in at least 30 countries in five continents. SARS is the first new severe infectious disease to occur in the 21st century, and little is known about its epidemiologic features (1). To assess the effect of SARS on public health and outcomes, data are needed about who becomes ill, how they contracted their illness, and the sequelae. A minimum set of data on intervention effectiveness should be collected in a uniform manner from each identified SARS case-patient at each location. Without such standardization, datasets from different locales may not be sufficiently comparable, thereby limiting the ability to scientifically evaluate both the effect of SARS and the interventions to control and prevent its spread. We propose a minimum set of epidemiologic and clinical variables that should be among the top priorities when designing data collection protocols related to SARS interventions. We set priorities for the variables in the minimum dataset as a guide for agencies unable to collect all the recommended data. Additionally, we summarize the health measures constructed from each of the variables, along with the possible policy implications, to provide further guidance to health agencies regarding the importance of each variable. A case study is available in an online appendix. Previous tools have been used to understand the spread of SARS and associated illnesses (2). These tools have not provided all necessary data to facilitate modeling usefulness and cost-effectiveness of interventions. Researchers have published results from relevant epidemiologic data, but no forms of itemized data are readily available (3). Our minimum dataset differs from minimum reporting requirements recently published by the World Health Organization (WHO) (2). WHO data templates include a daily summary of SARS cases to be reported at the national level and a case-reporting form that contains detailed clinical information (based on current WHO case definitions), including patient demographics, exposure, contact follow-up, daily reporting of symptoms, hospital admission, final case classification, and final case status. The dataset we propose captures information on length of exposure, incubation period from exposure to symptom onset, and use of health care resources (e.g., length of hospitalization, length of isolation, and admission to intensive care) not currently collected by WHO's template.
