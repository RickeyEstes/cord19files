Ribavirin has proven to be effective against several viruses in the clinical setting and a multitude of viruses in vitro. With up to five different proposed mechanisms of action, recent advances have begun to discern the hierarchy of antiviral effects at play depending on the virus and the host conditions under scrutiny. Studies reveal that for many viruses, antiviral mechanisms may differ depending on cell type in vitro and in vivo. Further analyses are thus required to accurately identify mechanisms to more optimally determine clinical treatments. In recent years, a growing number of ribavirin resistant and sensitive variants have been identified. These variants not only inform on the specific mechanisms by which ribavirin enfeebles the virus, but also can themselves be tools to identify new antiviral compounds. Ribavirin (RBV) is a synthetic guanosine analog with a broad-spectrum of antiviral activity. It is clinically effective against several viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus [1], several hemorrhagic fever viruses [2] [3] [4] and HCV when combined with pegylated interferon-a [5] . Moreover, it is effective against a large panel of RNA and DNA virus infections in vitro (summarized in Table 1 ). Nevertheless, the mechanism(s) of action of ribavirin are still under scrutiny, appearing to differ depending on the virus in question and the cell line used for study. Of the proposed mechanisms, two indirectly affect the virus. One of them is based on the inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) by ribavirin-5 0 -monophosphate, which leads to the depletion of intracellular GTP pools. The second one proposed postulates that unphosphorylated RBV has immunomodulatory effects on antiviral cellular responses, enhancing the T-helper type 1 over type 2 responses, or upregulating the interferon-stimulated response element. In addition, three direct mechanisms have been proposed: first, by inhibition of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) through direct interaction with ribavirin-5 0 -triphosphate; second, by interfering with RNA capping activity (although this has not been extensively studied or demonstrated in recent years); and third, by increasing viral mutation rates through the misincorporation of RBV into the genome, leading to population extinction [6] . Here, we will review recent studies on RBV effects on viral replication and propagation in vitro and in vivo, and the molecular basis of ribavirin resistance. Several recent studies have continued to explore RBV as an antiviral and therapeutic treatment against different viruses. In recent years, these studies have focused on whether RBV is directly inhibiting the RdRp, mutagenizing the genome, inhibiting IMPDH, or a combination of the three. Inhibition of RNA synthesis is observed for the influenza virus polymerase in cells treated with either RBV or methotrexate, an inhibitor of purine synthesis that decreases intracellular concentrations of purines. In this case, loss of polymerase activity at low concentrations of nucleotide is considered to be the culprit [7] . For hepatitis E virus (HEV) replication in vitro, RBV has the same antiviral effect as two other IMPDH inhibitors, mycophenolic acid (MPA) and 5-ethynyl-1-b-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (EICAR) that can be neutralized by the addition of guanosine. HEV replication appears to be inhibited through the depletion of GTP pools and inhibition of IMPDH [8] . Similarly, RBV's effect on HCV seemingly acts through the inhibition of IMPDH, since the addition of guanosine negates this effect and HCV RNA synthesis is suppressed in IMPDH-knockdown cells. No mutagenic activity was observed for HCV infection of Li23 hepatoma cells [9] . These results are in contradiction with those later obtained in the Huh-7.5 cell line, where mutagenic activity was indeed observed [10,11]. This mutagenesis is not mediated through the depletion of GTP levels, since the addition of guanosine does not significantly alter these effects. Depletion of GTP by MPA also has no mutagenic effect, suggesting that direct incorporation of RBV into the HCV genome is the underlying mechanism. Nevertheless, the study did uncover NTP imbalances resulting from RBV treatment that might contribute to the inhibition of RNA synthesis by mechanisms related to, or independent of, mutagenesis. In the case of arenaviruses, it appears that RBV has multiple effects. With lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LMCV), inhibition is likely mediated through a decrease in GTP levels caused by ribavirin-5 0 -monophosphate inhibition of IMPDH, while a mutagenic activity also occurs through incorporation of RBV into nascent RNA [12 ] . Finally, a direct interaction with the viral polymerase was suggested in the case of Hantaan virus (HTNV). In Vero cells treated with RBV, a reduction in viral genomic RNA and infectious particles is observed that is not associated with a significant reduction in GTP levels, as would be expected if IMPDH inhibition were the primary antiviral effect. Rather, an observed increase in ribavirin-5 0 -triphosphate supports that direct interactions with the RdRp is the mechanism of inhibition [13 ,14]. It is likely then, that for most viruses, ribavirin does indeed have pleiotropic effects that may differ in importance depending on concentration and cell type. These studies highlight the possible contradiction of results due to choice of cell line, and question to what extent cell lines represent in vivo settings. Although the study of ribavirin as an antiviral drug has been justly focused its effects on the virus, an important set of recent studies examined how host cells may react to RBV exposure. One study revealed dramatic variations in the accumulation of RBV in seven different cell lines [15 ] . The authors showed that while uptake of RBV by the equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT1 and 2) is similar for all cell types, the levels of intracellular RBV in seemingly resistant cells like BHK21, A549 and Vero are noticeably lower than those in BSRT7, HeLa, 4T1 or HEp2. Importantly, these profiles correlate with the lack of antiviral efficacy against VSV and Sendai virus. The authors concluded that the ability of a given cell type to metabolize RBV may determine which of RBV's antiviral effects will be at play. In the case of the hCoV-EMC coronavirus, a lack of sensitivity to interferon-a2b and RBV is also observed in Vero cells, while LLC-MK2 cells are more responsive [16 ] . Interestingly, RBV-responsive Huh7.5 cells passaged in the presence of ribavirin develop resistance phenotypes that correlate with reduced RBV uptake and/or processing. Furthermore, reduced uptake develops in PBMC of healthy donors treated for 1 week with RBV, and in the PBMC of HCVinfected patients receiving ribavirin-interferon combination therapy [17 ] .
