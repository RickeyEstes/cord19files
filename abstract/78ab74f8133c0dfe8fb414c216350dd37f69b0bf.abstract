Animal relocation data has recently become considerably more ubiquitous, finely structured (collection frequencies measured in minutes) and co-variate rich (physiology of individuals, environmental and landscape information, and accelerometer data). To better understand the impacts of ecological interactions, individual movement and disease on global change ecology, including wildlife management and conservation, it is important to have simulators that will provide demographic, movement, and epidemiology null models against which to compare patterns observed in empirical systems. Such models may then be used to develop quantitative narratives that enhance our intuition and understanding of the relationship between population structure and generative processes: in essence, along with empirical and experimental narratives, quantitative narratives are used to advance ecological epistemology. Here we describe a simulator that accounts for the influence of consumer-resource interactions, existence of social groups anchored around a central location, territoriality, group-switching behavior, and disease dynamics on population size. We use this simulator to develop new and reinforce existing quantitative narratives and point out areas for future study. The health and viability of species are of considerable concern to all nature lovers. Population models are central to our efforts to assess the numerical and ecological status of species and threats posed by climate change. Models, however, are crude caricatures of complex ecological systems. So how do we construct reliable assessment models able to capture processes essential to predicating the impacts of global change on population viability without getting tied up in their vast complexities? We broach this question and demonstrate how models focusing at the level of the individual (i.e., agent-based models) are tools for developing robust, narratives to augment narratives arising purely from empirical data sources and experimental outcomes. We do this in the context of nesting social groups, foraging for food, while exhibiting territoriality and group-switching behavior; and, we evaluate the impact of disease on the viability of such populations. 7 laboratory at the microcosm scale [7], but for populations of most vertebrates such 8 microcosm studies are not applicable, and we need to resort to the mesocosm level [8] or 9 use alternative methods to obtain insights. One of these methods is to build simulation 10 models that incorporate demographic, spatial, movement, and other relevant behavioral 11 and community processes, and then compare simulations of these models across various 12 scenarios [9] or outcomes with and without epidemiological processes added to the mix. 13 We take this latter approach and our primary aim is to develop a tool that can be used 14 to study the impact of disease on colonial populations and metapopulations [10] . This 15 tool must be comprehensive enough to include critical processes needed to address 16 questions that will extend our current knowledge in significant ways. Its application, of 17 course, is limited by the structure of the model. Thus, in building the model, we are 18 guided by principles related to concepts of "appropriate complexity modeling" [11, 12] . The standard approach to modeling disease outbreaks caused by 20 directly-transmitted pathogens is through systems of differential or difference equations 21 that model the number or density of susceptible (S), infectious (I), and recovered or 22 removed (R) individuals [13, 14]. These formulations may either be deterministic or 23 stochastic, and elaborated to include time-delays [15], demographic (births, deaths, and 24 recruitment [16]), metapopulation [17] and other spatial processes [18]. Examples of 25 these elaborations can be found in the context of modeling, inter alia, influenza [19, 20], 26 measles [21], SARS [22, 23], and Ebola [24-28] outbreaks. 27 Systems approaches to modeling disease limit our ability to consider individual-level 28 traits, unless these traits can be reasonably well expressed by dividing the population 29 into a limited number of subgroups, such as groups of individuals infected with different 30 strains of pathogens [29]. Including individual-level variation in disease models, however, 31 requires an agent-based approach [30], which then allows both individual behavior (e.g., 32 relevant to evaluating the probability of pathogen transmission) and pathogen exposure 33 history (e.g., relevant to evaluating the immunological state and hence the susceptibility 34 of an individual) to be incorporated into the model. It also allows one to trace the 35 number of individuals the each pathogen infects [25] and, hence, to identify individuals 36 that may be acting as super-spreaders [31]. Here, we develop an agent-based formulation that has application to studying 38 disease outbreaks in wildlife populations whose state of health-and hence, 39 susceptibility-is impacted by various factors, including social factors related to group 40 living and the structure of social networks [32], ecological factors related to foraging 41 success, and the movement behavior of individuals (which influences exposure to 42 pathogens). The model also includes a periodic return to a colony or nest cell, which 43 implies that the model has both a population-level and a group-association level (core 44 or household) structure. Such models have applications in animal production systems 45 (e.g., managing foot and mouth disease [33]), wildlife conservation [2], and disease 46 management at the human-animal interface [34]. The latter involves diseases such as 47 anthrax [35], bovine tuberculosis [36], and brucellosis in cattle and wild ungulates [37], 48 chronic wasting disease in deer [38], and toxoplasmosis in rats, cats and humans [39]. 49 Rather then following a formulaic ODD (Overview, Design concepts, and Design 50 details; [30, 40]) or extended ODD [41] prescription in presenting our model, we take a 51 more expository approach by first crafting a broad outline of our model's general 52 October 1, 2019 2/28 All rights reserved.

In addition, to keep the paper reader-friendly, we relegate the mathematical 53 details of our model to a Technical Methods section at the end of the paper and the 54 algorithmic details to a supporting online file (SOF). In the Results section, we report 55 the results of simulations of several illustrative scenarios, and in the Discussion section 56 we present the findings in the form of a quantitative narrative that provides insights 57 into the role different processes play in creating the population patterns observed in our 58 simulations. At this point, a few brief remarks on quantitative narratives in disease ecology are in 60 order. Unlike the canonical theories of physics-with kinematics, electromagnetism, 61 general relativity, and quantum mechanics providing prime examples, ecology has no 62 fundamental theories and associated mathematical formulations that can be used to 63 develop an ecological epistemology. Rather, the complexity of the field induced by the 64 plethora of processes involved requires that we focus only on a limited number of these 65 processes when building models, where the selection of process depends on the questions 66 at hand [11]. Our understanding of these processes requires an analysis of associated 67 quantitative formulations, but the soundness of the arguments cannot be adjudicated by 68 comparing, say, the accuracy of Mercury's orbit as predicted by Newtonian versus 69 Einsteinian physics. Rather, ecological epistemology is woven from a collection of 70 quantitative narratives that provide current best explanations for, or fits to, observed 71 empirical and experimental data. While statistical null models are use to develop 72 consilient empirical and experimental narratives, dynamic null models are used to 73 develop quantitative narratives that are consilient with empirical and experimental 74 narratives (Fig. 1). Such dynamic null models have a Goldilocks quality in the sense of 75 containing just the right amount of biological process detail [42]: too little and model 76 simulations are rejected as providing adequate descriptions of observed data; too much 77 process detail and the null-model-parsimony principle, as discussed by Gotteli and 78 Graves ( [42], p. 6), is violated. 79 Fig 1. A sketch of the role of empirical, experimental and quantitative narratives in the formulation of canons and construction of syntheses in the development of an ecological epistemology. In ecology, quantitative narratives, derived from the Gause-Lotka-Volterra 80 competition model, were used to construct the concept of a niche [43]. This narrative 81 begins with insights into competitive exclusion [44, 45], supported by additional 82 quantitative ideas relating to niche breadth and overlap [46, 47]. In epidemiology, 83 quantitative narratives, derived from analyses of SEIR epidemic models (S: susceptible; 84 E: exposed but not yet infectious; I: infections; R: removed-that is, recovered with 85 immunity or dead) [13] , have been used to identify critical differences in the emergence 86 of outbreak thresholds depending on whether pathogen transmission is dependent on quantitative narratives in epidemiology that incorporate aspects of the movement of 89 individuals [50] or particular ecological processes have been used to develop canonical 90 theories [51][52][53][54][55]; however, these are limited in scope and generality by the analytical 91 difficulties of studying dynamical systems, as well as networks that include more than 92 one ecological or behavioral process. The challenge here is to keep the models somewhat 93 general and broadly applicable, while including several key processes such as: spatial 94 demography; consumer-resource ecology with associated reproduction, growth, stress, 95 and mortality processes; movement and contact behavior; and SEIR epidemiology, in 96 ways that are simple enough to interpret the effects of each process. Sensitivity analyses 97 provide one type of approach to separating out effects [56][57][58][59]. Another is to use 98 methods relating to the practice of appropriate complexity modeling [11, 12] . 2 Methods The model we present here only incorporates the focal processes of interest and those 101 needed to attain a level of realism required to adequately address the questions at hand. 102 Thus, for example, we do not include agent age structure in the model even though age 103 structure is known to have important effects on population growth patterns [60], 104 persistence [61], and epidemics [62]. Agent age structure would certainly add complexity 105 to our narratives; but, whether its impacts are critical (i.e., it qualitatively changes the 106 structures we explain) or only elaborative (i.e., has quantitative but not qualitative 107 implications regarding the questions asked) is a issue to be examined in future studies. 108 For clarity, we enumerate below-without mathematical details-the processes 109 incorporated in our model, leaving such details to the Technical Methods Section at the 110 end of the paper. Aspects of the Numerus Model Builder construction of the model and 111 the generated NovaScript (extended JavaScript language) implementation are provided 112 in a Supporting Information file. 113 2.1 Model Outline 114 The model is formulated as a set of agents (individuals) moving over a cellular array. The agents themselves can be differentiated with respect to type (e.g., sex), can undergo 116 discrete state transitions (e.g., disease state) and can also change continuously over time 117 with respect an agent-level state vector. In our case, the latter contains the variables 118 "mass" (also a surrogate for fitness) and "stress" (which accumulates when the individual 119 is unable to meet its resource needs each time period). The cells in the cellular array 120 may also have relatively complex states that, in our model, include a list of the agents 121 in each cell and the level of a dynamically responding resource, which determines the 122 environmental context for the agents. Movement of agents occurs under the assumption 123 that, apart from reproduction, ecological and epidemiological processes are independent 124 of agent type. More specifically, in our model, the following objects and concepts apply: 125 Simulation world. This is the set of agents moving over a hexagonal cellular array 126 (we use a toroidal topology to eliminate boundary effects).
