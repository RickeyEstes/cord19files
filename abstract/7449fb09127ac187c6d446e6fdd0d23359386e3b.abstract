Objective: To evaluate a commercial kit for the detection of Salmonella spp. in faecal specimens based on Real-Time PCR (Real-Art TM Salmonella RG PCR Kit). Methods: A total of 1000 faecal specimens obtained consecutively from individual patients of Thessalia (Central Greece) were included in this study. Genomic DNA extractions were performed by use of commercially available isolation kits, while the commercial kit described above, according to the instructions of the manufacturer did real-time PCR. Results obtained from Real-Time PCR assay were compared with bacterial culture results to determine sensitivity and specificity. Results: According to the results obtained by Real-Time PCR, fifty-three of 1000 faecal specimens were positive for Salmonella spp. Salmonella was detected by bacterial cultures in all, except two, the positive specimens. Repetition of two negative cultures after enrichment detected the pathogenic micro organisms. The mean time for the detection of Salmonella by Real-Time PCR was approximately 5-6 hours, while detection by traditional culture methods required 2-3 days. Conclusion: The high sensitivity and specificity of this Real-Time PCR assay emphasizes the need of its application in a routine clinical laboratory for the rapid and accurate detection of Salmonella in faecal specimens. Objective: To prospectively assess the performance of a PCR-ELISA assay (OnychodiagÒ, Bio Advance, France) for diagnosis of onychomycosis due to dermatophytes. Patients/Methods: Three-university hospital labs specialized in medical mycology participated to the study. In each lab, nail samples (NS) were collected from patients (pts) suspected for onychomycosis (n = 404) or healthy controls (n = 108). In labs A and B, trained mycologists taking care to collect the sample as close as possible to the lesion collected NS. In lab C, NS were collected by other physicians and referred to the lab. Each NS was processed by classical mycological techniques i.e. direct examination (DE) and culture (Cult) and tested by OnychodiagÒ blindly to the results of mycology. For 75 pts, an additional distal sample (DS), obtained by clipping the nail plate, was collected from the same dystrophic nail and tested by OnychodiagÒ only, as such sample is improper for mycology. OnychodiagÒ processed each NS as follow: DNA extraction, amplification by PCR, hybridization with a labelled dermatophyte-specific probe and immobilization in a microplate well recoated with a capture probe. Results were expressed as OD values and considered positive for OD > 0.5, negative for OD < 0.3 and borderline (grey zone) for 0.3 < OD < 0.5. Results: Using the PCR-RFLP method, we examined the polymorphism of gap gene. During this study we determined the gap genotypes by AluI PCR-RFLP for further six staphylococcal species, therefore we were able to increase the list of species from 24 to 30. PCR-RFLP results were consistent with the results of partial sequencing of 16S rRNA, sodA and rpoB. Biochemical tests agreed in only 86% with other methods tested. Conclusion: These results suggest that the PCR-RFLP assay provides rapid, accurate, and reliable species-level identification of staphylococci. By using a series of control strains in each experiment the assay will be easy to standardise and interpret. Objective: To determine the clonal features of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI) by Coagulase-Negative Staphylococcus (CNS) and to evaluate the application of molecular tools in the CR-BSI diagnosis. Methods: We studied 61 CNS CR-BSI episodes from 55 patients with CNS cultured from peripheral blood and catheter tip cultures. All different CNS morphotypes (colonies with different morphology) were picked from each culture, and biotype, antibiotype and genotype (PFGE type) were obtained. Results: Morphological differences were correlated with differences in the PFGE type in 71% of the cases. Among these, 98% correlated with differences in antibiogram, 61% in biotype and 14% at species level. Simultaneous presence of more than one CNS clone (polyclonality) was found in 17% of catheters and in 44% of bloodstream infections. Only 77% of the CNS CR-BSI suspected cases were confirmed by molecular methods and 44% of true CNS CR-BSI episodes had not been diagnosed if only a single colony had been randomly selected from blood and catheter tip cultures. In 5% of the molecularly confirmed CR-BSI, two different CNS clones were tracked in catheter tip and blood cultures and they were the cause of polyclonal CR-BIS. In half of the true CR-BSI episodes, the CNS clone involved in CR-BSI was accompanied by other CNS clones, and in 24% CNS CR-BSI this clone was minority found in blood cultures (less than 50% of the isolates involved). Epidemiological study revealed 105 clones, grouped in 35 mayor clusters of isolates (from 1 to 8 clusters) with > 80% homology. There was no greater presence of any clone in any of the hospital services or during any particular month. Conclusion: Molecular tools allowed revealing the microbiological complexity of CR-BSI by CNS. A precise analysis and diagnostic of CNS CR-BSI requires to consider this finding and to consequently redefine the microbiological procedures and tools to efficient management of this entity. Screening with the convential culture, which takes 2 or 3 days, would not be possible for such women. Objectives: Numerous PCR-based assays have been developed for the identification of Brucella to improve diagnostic capabilities. For some purposes, the simple identification of Brucella is adequate. However, PCR with IPS1 and IPS2 primers is a reliable tool for rapid identification of Brucella species and its differentiation from closely related organisms. A fundamental question that arises during epidemiological investigations of outbreaks is whether the outbreak strain is genetically related to a proposed strain. Highly discriminating genetic markers for characterizing bacterial strains can help in clarifying the genetic relationships among strains. The Brucella AMOS (AbortusMelitensisOvisSuis)-PCR assay was previously developed to identify and differentiate specific Brucella species. Material and methods: Twenty strains of B. melitensis isolated from humans and animals using traditional techniques during four field trips to rural areas in two regions of Kazakhstan. Total 360 people were examined. B. melitensis biovars 1, 2 and 3 were isolated in 18 cases out 130 individuals presumed to be infected with Brucella sp. Two B. melitensis biovar 2 were isolated from sheep milk. Twenty isolates were identified and tested by the conventional biochemical tests, PCR-based and Brucella AMOS PCR Results: Twenty isolates were identified and tested by the conventional biochemical tests, PCR-based and Brucella AMOS PCR. This included 6 isolates identified as B. melitensis biovar 1; 10-identified as B. melitensis biovar 2; 4-identified as B. melitensis biovar 3. The results of classical typing for 20 B. melitensis cultures isolated from humans and animals were confirmed at genetic level by PCR. The high specificity of this PCR-based assay was demonstrated by testing all of the biovars of twenty strains of B. melitensis. The Brucella AMOS PCR correctly identified each isolate as a B. melitensis. However due to AMOS, but not biological typing, genetic features of 2 strains of B. melitensis biovar1 and 2 have been found. Two B. melitensis biovar 1 and 2 have been isolated from the people with serological positive acute brucellosis (SAT: 1: 1600). Conclusion: The PCR-based test and AMOS-PCR could be used as a complementary test to identify genus Brucella and differentiate specific Brucella species. However, to explain further genetic distinctions, fingerprinting is required.
