With an ongoing threat posed by circulating zoonotic strains, new strategies are required to 8 prepare for the next emergent coronavirus (CoV). Previously, groups had targeted conserved 9 coronavirus proteins as a strategy to generate live-attenuated vaccine strains against current 10 and future CoVs. With this in mind, we explored whether manipulation of CoV NSP16, a 11 conserved 2'O methyltransferase (MTase), could provide a broad attenuation platform against 12 future emergent strains. Using the SARS-CoV mouse model, a NSP16 mutant vaccine was 13 evaluated for protection from heterologous challenge, efficacy in the aging host, and potential 14 for reversion to pathogenesis. Despite some success, concerns for virulence in the aged and 15 potential for reversion makes targeting NSP16 alone an untenable approach. However, 16 combining a 2'O MTase mutation with a previously described CoV fidelity mutant produced a 17 vaccine strain capable of protection from heterologous virus challenge, efficacy in aged mice, 18 and no evidence for reversion. Together, the results indicate that targeting the CoV 2'O MTase 19 in parallel with other conserved attenuating mutations may provide a platform strategy for 20 rapidly generating live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines. .

Targeting both conserved coronavirus activities produced a stable, attenuated virus capable of 80 protection from heterologous challenge, efficacy in aged mice, and absence of reversion in 81 immunocompromised models. Together, the results indicate that targeting coronavirus NSP16 82 may be a critical component of a future live attenuated coronavirus vaccine approach. 83 84 .

Our results indicate that the attenuated 2'O MTase SARS-CoV mutant is 131 capable of inducing robust protection from the zoonotic group 2B spike virus in terms of 132 disease. Weight loss data, viral lung titer, and hemorrhage score indicated little to no disease in 133 mice vaccinated with dNSP16 compared to mock vaccinated mice ( Fig. 2A-C) . Importantly, while not equivalent to neutralization of wild-type SARS-CoV, sera from dNSP16-vaccinated 135 mice were able to effectively block the SHC014 chimeric virus, likely contributing to protection
