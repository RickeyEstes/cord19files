Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large and diverse group of positive-stranded RNA viruses in the Coronaviridae family, which also comprises members of the Torovirus genera. 1 Together with the Arteriviridae and Roniviridae families, Coronaviridae are grouped in the order of Nidovirales, based on their conserved genome organization and mechanism of replication. 2 The name Nidovirus is derived from their unique transcription strategy involving formation of nested (in Latin: nidus) mRNA molecules with identical 3 0 ends during an infection. 3,4 Coronavirus particles are enveloped and measure 120 to 160 nm in diameter, containing a linear, single and positive stranded RNA genome with an average length of 27 to 31 kb, the largest RNA genome described so far. 2,5 The viral RNA molecule is organized together with multiple copies of the nucleocapsid (N) protein to form a flexible core inside the viral membrane that constitutes the spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins. In certain isolates, an additional structural protein is present on the virion: hemagglutinin esterase (HE). The heavily glycosylated S proteins are crucial for CoVs to establish and maintain an infection cycle, by interacting with specific cellular entry molecules to initiate a fusion between viral and cellular membranes. 6 In the 1930s, isolation of the first CoV, avian bronchitis virus (IBV), was reported. 7 Ever since, many CoVs have been discovered in a broad range of hosts, including mammals and birds. CoVs are transmitted by means of respiratory aerosols and the fecal-oral route of infection, and primarily target mucosal surfaces of respiratory and intestinal tracts, causing illnesses of varying severity.
