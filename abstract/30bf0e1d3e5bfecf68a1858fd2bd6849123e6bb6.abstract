Dicer Dicer is an endoribonuclease member of RNase III family encoded by dicer gene, which has the function of cleaving long double-stranded RNA or pre-miRNA into siRNA or miRNA that are in 20-25 base pairs length with 2 nt overhangs at 3 0 ends. MicroRNA (miRNA) miRNA is a kind of 22 nt small non-coding RNA fragments discovered in viruses, plants, animals and human, which have the functions of post-transcriptional regulation in gene expression. p19 protein Plant tombusvirus 19 kDa protein (p19) is an RNA silencing suppressor protein. p19 selectively binds to exactly matched, double-stranded antiviral siRNAs of 21 nt, but not to imperfectly paired miRNAs, ssRNAs or other dsRNAs. Prokaryotic siRNA (pro-siRNA) Pro-siRNA are bacterial RNase III products that have chemical and functional properties similar to eukaryotic siRNAs. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) RNA is a linear molecule composed of four types of smaller molecules called ribonucleotide bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U).
