The bacterial pathogens most frequently found are enteropathogenic clones of E. coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella enterica subsp., Campylobacter spp. and Aeromonas spp. The most frequently identified causative viruses (outside local epidemics) include rotavirus, caliciviruses (norovirus and sapovirus), astrovirus and enteric adenovirus. Less prevalent viruses include paramyxovirus, morbillivirus, rubivirus and reovirus. The prevalence of norovirus has been recently estimated to be 12% in children under 5 years of age hospitalized for severe diarrhea and 12% of mild and moderate diarrhea cases among patients of all ages. 12 These authors estimated that noroviruses were responsible for up to 200 000 deaths of children <5 years of age in LMIC. 12 SURVEILLANCE Not all enteric pathogens are notifiable, depending on the country. Moreover, a recent study in six US states indicated that multiple steps between onset of food-borne illness and its investigation by a public health agency could take up to 3 weeks. 6 Infected persons, animals and the inanimate environment are sources of pathogens. Indeed, diarrhea is a contagious situation where infected persons are the main source of contamination, implying the isolation of the infected person as recalled by the recent outbreak of cholera in Haiti. 7 However, some enteric pathogens are zoonotic and contaminated poorly cooked food is the source of infection, as in the case of enteroinvasive Escherichia coli strains and Campylobacter 8 and Listeria monocytogenes. 9 Contaminated water is less likely to be a source of infection except in circumstances where there is a leak between potable and unpotable water networks. Water-borne outbreaks associated with recreational water (e.g., swimming or wading pools) are another source of acute diarrhea. These are associated most frequently with Cryptosporidium (50%) in treated water sources and with toxigenic E. coli (25%) and norovirus (25%) in freshwater sources. When there is a direct transmission of water-borne and food-borne pathogens, hands are increasingly recognized as vectors of enteric pathogens. 10 Travel is increasingly reported as a circumstance for acute diarrhea, including enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection. Aeromonas infections have been traced to aquarium water. 11 Diarrhea reflects an increased water content of the stool, whether due to impaired water absorption or active water secretion by the bowel. In severe infectious diarrhea, the daily volume of stool may exceed 2 liters. Dehydration and loss of potassium (hypokalemia) are two lifethreatening consequences of severe diarrhea. Water is mainly absorbed in the small bowel (about 8 liters a day in an adult) and further in the
