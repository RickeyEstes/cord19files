Studies examining Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs) in Emergency Department (EDs), particularly in rural and remote areas, are rare. This study aimed to examine the burden of ARIs among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children presenting to Western Australian (WA) EDs from 2002 to 2012. Method Using a retrospective population-based cohort study linking ED records to birth and perinatal records, we examined presentation rates for metropolitan, rural and remote Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children from 469,589 births. We used ED diagnosis information to categorise presentations into ARI groups and calculated age-specific rates. Negative binomial regression was used to investigate association between risk factors and frequency of ARI presentation. Overall 26% of presentations were for ARIs. For Aboriginal children, the highest rates were for those aged <12 months in the Great Southern (1,233 per 1,000 child-years) and Pilbara regions (1,088 per 1,000 child-years). Rates for non-Aboriginal children were highest in children <12 months in the Southwest and Kimberley (400 and 375 per 1,000 child-years respectively). Presentation rates for ARI in children from rural and remote WA significantly increased over time in all age groups <5 years. Risk factors for children presenting to ED with ARI were: male, prematurity, Caesarean delivery, and residence in the Kimberley region and lower socio-economic areas. Conclusion One-in-four ED presentations in WA children are for ARIs, representing a significant outof-hospital burden with some evidence of geographical disparity. Planned linkages with hospital discharge and laboratory detection data will aid in assessing the sensitivity and specificity of ARI diagnoses in ED. • This study demonstrates that emergency department presentation for acute respiratory infections is common in children and identifies population subgroups which utilise emergency services more frequently than others. • We have conducted a state-wide in-depth investigation into the diagnostic information available from the emergency department data systems with regard to respiratory infections and provided age-specific presentation rates by condition and by geographic location, which can inform future disease control strategies. • As emergency department location was not available the postcode of the child at birth was used to stratify data by location, which is a limitation of this study.
