Editor's Comment: There is growing recognition of the importance of the multitude of organisms (100 trillion of them!!) that reside in our intestinal tract, labeled the gut microbiota, not only with regard to their impact on gut function but on many other aspects of human function and behavior. In this timely review, Parashar and Udayabanu provide a thorough and thought-provoking tour through the fascinating landscape provided by the intersection between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease and the possible role the gut microbiota may play, not only in producing clinical symptoms in individuals with Parkinson's disease, but also with regard to the possible genesis of the disease itself. I believe readers will find this review tremendously interesting, informative, and enlightening. Gut microbiota (GM) can influence various neurological outcomes, like cognition, learning, and memory. Commensal GM modulates brain development and behavior and has been implicated in several neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, anxiety, stress and much more. A recent study has shown that Parkinson's disease patients suffer from GM dysbiosis, but whether it is a cause or an effect is yet to be understood. In this review, we try to connect the dots between GM and PD pathology using direct and indirect evidence.
