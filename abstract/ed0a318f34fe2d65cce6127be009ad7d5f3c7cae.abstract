Knowledge of the host factors required for norovirus replication has been hindered 2 by the challenges associated with culturing human noroviruses. We have combined 3 proteomic analysis of the viral translation and replication complexes with a CRISPR 4 screen, to identify host factors required for norovirus infection. The core stress 5 granule component G3BP1 was identified as a host factor essential for efficient 6 human and murine norovirus infection, demonstrating a conserved function across 7 the Norovirus genus. Furthermore, we show that G3BP1 functions in the novel 8 paradigm of viral VPg-dependent translation initiation, contributing to the assembly of 9 translation complexes on the VPg-linked viral positive sense RNA genome by 10 facilitating 40S recruitment. Our data suggest that G3BP1 functions by providing viral 11 RNA a competitive advantage over capped cellular RNAs, uncovering a novel 12 function for G3BP1 in the life cycle of positive sense RNA viruses and identifying the 13 first host factor with pan-norovirus pro-viral activity. 14 15 16
