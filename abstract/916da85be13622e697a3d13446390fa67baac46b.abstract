This chapter addresses diseases and syndromes which have been shown, or are reported, to have adverse effects on egg production and quality. However, any disease of poultry can adversely affect egg production and quality indirectly, by affecting the health of the bird. The main topics are the effect on egg production and quality of bacteria (Salmonella, Mycoplasma, Escherichia coli, infectious coryza, Ornithobacterium, Gallibacterium, spirochaetosis), viruses (infectious bronchitis virus, egg drop syndrome, swollen head syndrome, avian encephalomyelitis, influenza, Newcastle disease, laryngotracheitis), syndromes (fatty liver haemorrhagic syndrome, cage layer osteoporosis) and toxic agents. A short section on clinical perspectives reports on information obtained from practising poultry veterinarians as such observations can provide valuable starting points for future research. nutrition and disease may, in combination, result in a reduction in egg internal quality and/or egg shell quality. The most recent comprehensive review of diseases affecting egg quality is that of Spackman (1987) who, although focusing on egg shell quality, also discussed the effects of disease on egg internal quality. This chapter addresses diseases and syndromes which have been shown, or are reported to, have adverse effects on egg production and quality. Emphasis will be on developments since Spackman's 1987 review, except where earlier information is fundamental to the discussion. The main experimental developments that have occurred since Spackman's review are new information about the effect of Australian strains of infectious bronchitis virus on the oviduct and egg quality and the reporting of egg apex abnormalities caused by Mycoplasma synoviae (particularly in combination with infectious bronchitis virus). 16.2.
