Callebaut, P., Pensaert, M.B. and Hooyberghs, J., 1989. A competitive inhibition ELISA for the differentiation of serum antibodies from pigs infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) or with the TGEV-related porcine respiratory coronavirus. Vet Mtcrobml, 20: 9-19. A competitive inhibition ELISA was developed to detect non-neutralizing antibodies to the peplomer protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in porcine sera using a monoclonal antibody as an indicator. It was demonstrated that field stratus of the TGEV-related porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) did not induce this antibody, whereas the Miller strain and field strains of TGEV did. The sensitivity of the competitive inhibition ELISA appeared to be similar to that of the virus neutralization (VN) test. The test enables differentiation of pigs which were previously infected with TGEV or PRCV and which cannot be distinguished by the classical antl-TGEV neutralization test. The present test is useful for selective serodiagnosis.
