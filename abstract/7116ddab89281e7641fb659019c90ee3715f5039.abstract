Persistent bacterial bronchitis is a leading cause of chronic wet cough in young children. This 20 study aimed to characterise the respiratory bacterial microbiota of healthy children and to 21 assess the impact of the changes associated with the development of persistent bacterial 22 bronchitis. 23 Blind, protected brushings were obtained from 20 healthy controls and 24 children with 24 persistent bacterial bronchitis, with an additional directed sample obtained from persistent 25 bacterial bronchitis patients. DNA was extracted, quantified using a 16S rRNA gene 26 quantitative PCR assay prior to microbial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene 27 sequencing. 28 No significant difference in bacterial diversity or community composition (R 2 = 0.01, P = 29 0.36) was observed between paired blind and non-blind brushes, showing that blind 30 brushings are a valid means of accessing the airway microbiota. This has important 31 implications for collecting lower respiratory samples from healthy children. 32 A significant decrease in bacterial diversity (P < 0.001) and change in community 33 composition (R 2 = 0.08, P = 0.004) was observed between controls and patients. Bacterial 34 communities within patients with PBB were dominated by Proteobacteria, and indicator 35 species analysis showed that Haemophilus and Neisseria were significantly associated with 36 the patient group. In 15 (52.9%) cases the dominant organism by sequencing was not 37 identified by standard routine clinical culture. 38 The bacteria present in the lungs of patients with persistent bacterial bronchitis were less 39 diverse in terms of richness and evenness. The results validate the clinical diagnosis, and 40 suggest that more attention to bacterial communities in children with chronic cough may lead 41 to more rapid recognition of this condition with earlier treatment and reduction in disease 42 burden. 43
