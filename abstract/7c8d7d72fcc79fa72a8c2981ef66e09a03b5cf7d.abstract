80 % with an exposure time of 30 seconds. Viral titers are displayed as 50 % tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 /mL) values. Cytotoxic effects are displayed as dashed bars are and were calculated analogous to virus infectivity. RFs are included above the bar. The mean of two -three independent experiments with standard deviation are shown. LLOQ: lower limit of quantification. Top inserts: Regression analysis of the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, bovine CoV (BCoV), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by WHO formulation I (A) and II (B). Depicted is the percentage of inactivation at different concentrations.
