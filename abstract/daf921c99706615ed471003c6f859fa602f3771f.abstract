Security activities for an organization are often centered within a department dedicated to delivering value to the organization through services. As the previous chapter indicated, much flux occurs in the nature of organizations themselves and within various departments providing such services. Still, some generalizations can be made that will be appropriate for various types of managerial situations. This chapter examines the means whereby organizations with dedicated security departments are organized to serve the entire operation. It further looks at the relationship between organizations that contract out for routine security services. We begin by examining core competencies of security operations. Core competencies refer to the fundamental abilities a protective program needs in order for it to deliver services effectively. These needs will vary according to the type of organization, its size and geography, recent history, criticality of resources, vulnerability to losses, and other factors. No single executive is expected to be competent in all demands required of the position, but the subsequent subsections serve as a means of generating thought as to what a protective operation's value to the organization is or could be. This list is dynamic and reflects the changing nature of the requirements of security programs and of the expectations of people heading them. As discussed in the previous chapter, problems and opportunities require appropriate response. The circumstance might be minor, requiring brief intervention. Or it could be a situation requiring the creation of new managerial protocols. That is, a program needs to be developed. The identification of these situations, their analysis after fact-finding, the organizing of an appropriate program, the appointing of a deputy to operate the new program, and its supervision and constant improvement are reasonable expectations. Three skills 2 38 SeCurITy OperATIONS MANAgeMeNT reflect the core competencies executive management expects from the senior security personnel: Organizations are never static. New issues require fresh responses. Assume that in 5 or 7 years the organization will be considerably different than it is today. Security management programs change in parallel with other activities in the workplace. Operating existing programs. The ability to initiate a successful program is a strategic skill, whereas the operation of existing programs is less challenging. Nonetheless, this is the basis of most daily work and includes opportunities for creativity and constant program improvement, much as what occurs in the initiating of such activities. Another core skill is the ability to collect information that is critical to the operation and assess the success of ongoing programs (see Box 2.1). The manager or director for such operations normally manages the budget for these activities (see Chapter 8). Handling personnel administration. The recruiting, screening, hiring, training, supervising, promoting, disciplining, terminating, and conducting of other personnelrelated activities are expectations of high-performance security operations (see Chapters 3-7). Once goals are set, data are needed to evaluate how successfully aims are being reached. relevant data collection can also point to other issues that require more attention than what was initially apparent. Managers believe that data -the metrics -are indispensable in creating a sensible program. Much of the burden of collecting systems inputs can be collected through automated systems. The data can then be analyzed, sometimes with the use of computer programs that can produce extensive reports, nuanced to the issues that are important. Analysis is improved. This is partially why security operations have provided greater measurable value over the years. Criminal incidents must be collected for legal and risk management purposes and also so that they can be measured for any relevant trend. Services performed by security personnel may be collected and measured for the same reasons. The following reflects the information a security department might collect to assess programmatic developments. , including: • Robbery • Aggravated assault • Other assault • Burglary • Larceny (theft): employee • Larceny: nonemployee • Motor vehicle theft
