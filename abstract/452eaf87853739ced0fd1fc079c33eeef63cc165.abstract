The cause and clinical manifestations of pneumonia were studied in 98 pediatric outpatients. A viral diagnosis was established in 38 (39%) of the 98 patients, and a bacterial diagnosis in 19 (19%). Ten (53%) of the 19 patients with bacterial pneumonia had a concurrent viral infection. No clinical, laboratory, or radiographic findings that would reliably differentiate viral from bacterial infection were identified. This study suggests that bacterial pneumonia is more common in pediatric outpatients than previously reported, and that the clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings in patients with bacterial infection may be indistinguishable from findings in patients with viral infection. (J PEDIATR 1987;111:194-200) Most children with pneumonia are managed as outpatients. 1 In contrast, most published information about pneumonia, particularly bacterial pneumonia, has been derived from hospitalized patients. This situation reflects the lack of simple, reliable methods for establishing a diagnosis of bacterial infection in the outpatient setting. The diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia in pediatric patients generally depends on isolation of the infecting organism from the blood. Blood cultures, however, have been reported to be positive in only 13% of patients with bacterial pneumonia documented by lung punctures. 2 Lung puncture, which provides sensitive and specific detection of bacterial pneumonia, is too invasive to be used in patients who are not severely ill. The detection of bacterial antigen in body fluids by counterimmunoelectrophoresis has proved useful for bacterial diagnosis in a number of clinical syndromes? Antigen can be detected by CIE in the sputum, serum, and urine of patients with bacterial pneumonia? -1~ Antigen detection methods appear to be more sensitive than blood cultures for the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia, although the absolute sensitivity of these methods is not known.
