KEYWORDS Myomorphs Sciuromorphs Dental disease Pseudo-odontoma Elodontoma The order Rodentia is the largest and most diversified mammalian group, comprising approximately 40% of all mammalian species, differing widely in size, behavior, feeding habits, anatomy, and physiology. All rodent species have 2 well-developed maxillary and mandibular aradicular incisor teeth, which represent the most distinguishable dental feature of this order. Myomorphs and sciuromorphs have elodont incisors and anelodont cheek teeth, whereas hystrychomorphs have full anelodont dentition. Odontogenic tumors and tumor-like lesions (odontomas, complex odontomas and elodontomas) affecting incisor teeth are frequently seen in sciuromorph rodents, including pseudo-odontoma in prarie dogs. Challenging surgical approaches may be required for treatment. The use of computed tomography is particularly useful and has great advantages compared with standard radiography.
