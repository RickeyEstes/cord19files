During an outbreak of severe acute respiratory infections in 2 orphanages, Vietnam, 7/12 hospitalized children died. All hospitalized children and 26/43 children from outbreak orphanages tested positive for rhinovirus versus 9/40 control children (p = 0.0005). Outbreak rhinoviruses formed a distinct genetic cluster. Human rhinovirus is an underappreciated cause of severe pneumonia in vulnerable groups. T he World Health Organization estimates that ≈2 million children die each year from acute respiratory tract infection (ARI), and most live in developing countries (1). Human rhinovirus (HRV), a common cause of mild upper respiratory tract infections, may also cause severe ARI in children. We report on an outbreak of severe ARI caused by HRV in children living in orphanages in Vietnam. During December 2007-February 2008, twelve infants <6 months of age with severe ARI infection were admitted to 2 hospitals in Hanoi. Because all 12 infants lived in 2 orphanages in Hanoi, the National Hospital of Pediatrics (NHP) initiated an outbreak investigation. Data on demographic characteristics, clinical features, and outcomes were collected for the 12 infants. Researchers visited 1 of the outbreak orphanages and 1 control orphanage (40 km apart, no severe ARI observed). Patient histories were obtained from orphanage staff; all infants were examined, and nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were collected. Respiratory specimens were tested by bacterial culture and multiplex reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR, Seeplex RV12 Kit; Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) for the following respiratory viruses: infl uenza A/B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, coronavirus (OC43/HKU1 and 229E/NL63), adenovirus, parainfl uenzavirus, and human metapneumovirus (2). This outbreak investigation was approved by the Scientifi c Committee of NHP. Twelve patients with severe ARI were admitted to the NHP intensive care unit over 38 days during the cool months of December 2007-February 2008 (temperature 5°C-14°C). The 12 hospitalized infants (11 female) were 2-to 4-months-old. Most (10/12) were from 1 orphanage, which was selected for investigation. Two hospitalized children had a known underlying condition: congenital hypothyroidism (n = 1) and HIV infection (n = 1). Seven infants were underweight (sex-specifi c weight-for-age; z score <2 SDs). All exhibited cough, coryza, wheezing, and dyspnea, and 6 (50%) had a documented fever. Acute respiratory distress syndrome developed in all 12 a mean of 8.3 (95% CI ± 5 days) days after onset. Mean pressure of arterial oxygen/fractional inspired oxygen ratio was 66.0 (95% CI ± 30.6, range 25.1-131.0). Chest radiographs showed extensive bilateral infi ltrates. Blood cultures for bacteria were negative. Despite mechanical ventilation and administration of intravenous broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs, 7 patients died and 3 patients recovered (2 were lost to follow up). HRV was detected by RT-PCR in all infants; 2 patients were co-infected with RSV and adenovirus (Table) . In addition, 1 bronchoalveolar lavage specimen from 1 patient was HRV positive. The outbreak orphanage was visited within 1 week of outbreak detection. The visit revealed that several other infants had been hospitalized elsewhere, but we could not obtain detailed data about them. We tested nasal-pharyngeal swab specimens (pooled) from all 43 infants (100% <12 months of age) living in the outbreak orphanage and nasal swab specimens from the 40 youngest children (97.5% <12 months of age) at the control orphanage within 2 weeks of the outbreak. In both orphanages, 5-9 children lived in 1 room and shared the same bed, wiping cloths, basic utensils such as cups, and clothing. Most children in the outbreak orphanage were female (31/43 [72%]), compared with 50% (20/40) in the control orphanage. Of children whose specimens were tested by RT-PCR, 98% (42/43) of the infants from the outbreak orphanage had at least 1 symptom of respiratory tract infection compared with 14 (35%) of 40 infants at the control orphanage. Among children from the outbreak orphanage (both hospitalized and nonhospitalized [n = 55]), a single pathogen was identifi ed in 31 (56.4%) infants and >2 pathogens were found in 9 (16.4%) children (Table) . The most frequently detected pathogen was HRV (n = 38). In the control orphanage, 9 (22.5%) children tested positive DISPATCHES 1886 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.
