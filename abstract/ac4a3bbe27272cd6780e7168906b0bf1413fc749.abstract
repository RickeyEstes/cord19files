The detection of nucleic acids by pattern recognition receptors is an ancient and 27 conserved component of the innate immune system. Notably, RNA virus genomes 28 are sensed by mammalian cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors, thereby activating 29 interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression to restrict viral replication. However, 30 recent evidence indicates that the cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway also 31 protects against RNA viruses. So far, the mechanisms responsible for DNA sensing 32 of RNA viruses, which replicate without known DNA intermediates, remain unclear. 33 By using cGAS gene knockout and reconstitution in human and mouse cell 34 , we discovered that DNA sensing and cGAMP synthase activities are 35 required for cGAS-mediated restriction of vesicular stomatitis virus and Sindbis 36 virus. The level of cGAMP produced in response to RNA virus infection was below 37 the threshold of detection, suggesting that only transient and/or low levels of 38 cGAMP are produced during RNA virus infections. To clarify the DNA ligands that 39 activate cGAS activity, we confirmed that cGAS binds mitochondrial DNA in the 40 cytosol of both uninfected and infected cells; however, the amount of 41 cGAS-associated mitochondrial DNA did not change in response to virus infection. 42 Rather, a variety of pre-existing cytosolic DNAs, including mitochondrial DNA and 43 endogenous cDNAs, may serve as stimuli for basal cGAS activation. Importantly, 44 cGAS knockout and reconstitution experiments demonstrated that cGAS drives 45 low-level ISG expression at steady state. We propose that cGAS-STING restricts 46 RNA viruses by promoting a preparatory immune activation state within cells, likely 47 primed by endogenous cellular DNA ligands. 48 . Importance 49 Many medically important RNA viruses are restricted by the cGAS-STING 50 DNA-sensing pathway of innate immune activation. Since these viruses replicate 51 without DNA intermediates, it is unclear what DNA ligand(s) are responsible for 52 triggering this pathway. We show here that cGAS's DNA binding and signaling 53 activities are required for RNA virus restriction, similar to the mechanisms by which it 54 restricts DNA viruses. Furthermore, we confirmed that cGAS continuously binds host 55 DNA, which was unaffected by RNA virus infection. Finally, cGAS expression 56 correlated with the low-level expression of interferon-stimulated genes in uninfected 57 cells, both in vitro and in vivo. We propose that cGAS-mediated sensing of 58 endogenous DNA ligands contributes to RNA virus restriction by establishing a 59 baseline of innate immune activation. doi: bioRxiv preprint 61 A key feature of innate immunity is the detection of pathogen-associated 62 molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (1). For 63 mammalian cells, viral nucleic acids are detected by distinct PRRs, triggering 64 interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression to set up an antiviral state. During RNA 65 virus infections, uncapped and double-stranded RNAs are detected in the cytosol by 66 the PRRs retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and related RIG-I-like receptors 67 (RLRs). However, the recent discovery of the cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA sensing 68 pathway, and the observation that it can also restrict RNA viruses (2), reveals a need 69 to further investigate the mechanisms of nucleic acid sensing during RNA virus 70 infection. 71 The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an endoplasmic reticulum-and 72 mitochondrial-bound protein that spontaneously activates ISG expression when 73 overexpressed (2). Although STING is involved in DNA sensing, STING -/mice and 74 mouse endothelial fibroblasts (MEFs) are more permissive for vesicular stomatitis 75 virus (VSV), a negative-stand RNA virus (2, 3). Additionally, studies in MEFs 76 deficient in three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), a nuclease important for the 77 turnover of cytosolic retroelement cDNAs (4), have described enhanced antiviral 78 phenotypes in response to a wide array of RNA viruses and retroviruses, 79 presumably due to the accumulation of DNA in the cytosol (5, 6). It appears that this 80 DNA-based restriction is broad, as many RNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to 81 subvert the cGAS-STING pathway, including flaviviruses (7-9), hepaciviruses (10, 82 STING does not directly interact with cytosolic DNA, but functions as an innate 84 immune adaptor protein to transduce signals between cyclic GMP-AMP synthase 85 (cGAS) and Tank-binding kinase 1, which subsequently phosphorylates the 86 transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to initiate an ISG response doi: bioRxiv preprint 157 158 growth of VSV-GFP, VSVΔM51A-GFP, and SINV-GFP, while THP-1 KO cells or 159 THP-1 KO cells reconstituted with inactive hcGAS-HA3x mutants showed little or no 160 restriction (Figure 3D-3F). As observed previously in MEFs, VSVΔM51A-GFP was 161 more potently restricted than VSV-GFP, but unlike in MEFs, infected fewer cells 162 expressing mutant cGAS. This was also true for SINV-GFP, albeit restriction with 163 WT hcGAS-HA3x was extremely potent, comparatively. It is unclear whether these 164 modest decreases in infection of the cGAS mutants was due to hcGAS-HA3x 165 overexpression in THP-1 cells, residual hcGAS activities, or normal clonal 166 variation of cells. Nevertheless, these results are most consistent with an integral 167 role for cGAS DNA binding and cGAMP synthase activities in RNA virus restriction. 168 Detection of cGAMP produced in response to DNA transfection but not 169 RNA virus infection. Because cGAMP synthesis activity was essential for RNA 170 virus restriction, we next sought to identify cGAMP produced in response to RNA . 676 2013.
