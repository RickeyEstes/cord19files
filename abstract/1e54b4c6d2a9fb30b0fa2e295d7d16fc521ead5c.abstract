To this insightful phrase, numerous biologists studying biodiversity have added the corollary: Everything in biology makes more sense in light of phylogeny. As portions of the Tree of Life (e.g., vertebrates, butterflies) have been better resolved, together with the recent publication of the first rough draft tree of all named life (see Chapter 3), the scientific community, as well as the general public, have increasingly come to appreciate its value. Through yielding powerful insights into the past, the Tree of Life provides a means to interpret the patterns and processes of evolution, as well as the ability to predict the responses of life in the face of rapid environmental change. Broad knowledge of species relationships is fundamental, providing crucial new information regarding the discovery of medicines, combatting diseases, and crop improvement. This information has also had major impacts in the diverse fields of genomics, evolution, and development, while providing insights into the study of adaptation, speciation, community assembly, and ecosystem functioning. Given the many benefits, it is therefore hard to summarize, in a few words, the immense implications and applications of the Tree of Life to biology and human well-being. All of these benefits of a better knowledge of phylogeny and the Tree of Life are made possible for the same reason that a clear understanding of your own family tree is important-knowledge of relationships matters. We all seem to have a fascination with family trees-who were my ancestors? How am I related to others? In addition, we all understand clearly that if a close relative has a disease that is inherited, say a certain cancer, then there is a good probability that we may have inherited the genes for that trait (Fig. 5.1) . In much the same way as understanding your family tree is enlightening, the Tree of Life similarly has informative and predictive value. We The Great Tree of Life
