and Blautia (P = 0.008) significantly decreased on day 20 and C. hiranonis (p = 0.001) on day 60. Blautia (P = 0.017) remained decreased on day 60. E.coli remained unchanged on day 20 (P = 0.999) but decreased on day 60 (P = 0.0001). Faecalibacterium remained unchanged on day 20 (P = 0.711) but increased on day 60 (P = 0.0002). In group 3, no statistically significant differences were identified. Administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or doxycycline had profound effects on certain bacterial groups potentially associated with dysbiosis in these kittens. Several studies have reported intestinal microbial dysbiosis in dogs with chronic enteropathy. Limited data is available about the microbiota gene function in this pathology in dogs. Determining the functional attributes of the microbiome is essential for understanding their role on host metabolism and disease. The aim of this study was to compare the functional roles of the fecal microbiota in healthy dogs and dogs with CE by fecal DNA shotgun sequencing. Fecal samples were collected from 14 healthy dogs and 20 dogs with chronic enteropathy (CE). Fecal DNA was extracted using a commercial kit (PowerSoil, QIAGEN). Functional characterization of the shotgun sequence reads in the KEGG database was performed using next generation sequencing, in order to identify the relative abundance of specific metabolic pathways. A Wilcoxon test was used for comparison of the gene abundance between groups. Significance was set at q < 0.05. At phylum level, low abundance of Bacteroidetes was observed in dog with CE, compared to healthy control dogs (48.5 vs 1.6%; q = 0.0006). Fusobacteria was also significantly increased in healthy controls (0.25 vs 0.04%; q = 0.0111). The pathway enrichment analysis of the bacterial metagenomes showed that 130 of 360 (36.1%) total metabolic modules were differentially abundant between studied groups. Genes for carbohydrate metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids (lysine, threonine, histidine, isoleucine, tryptophan, leucine and serine) and vitamins (ascorbate, thiamine and riboflavin) were decreased in dogs with CE, while genes involved in transport of molecules and homeostasis maintenance during oxidative stress (glutathione biosynthesis) were increased in CE. Our data presents, as previous reported, an intestinal microbial dysbiosis in dogs with CE. As new finding, our results show an altered microbial metabolism in dogs with CE compared to healthy dogs, characterized by reduction of amino acid biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism. Further studies including transcriptomic analysis are warranted to define the consequences of this microbiota dysfunction on dogs with CE. 'Protein-losing-enteropathy' (PLE) is a syndrome caused by various diseases including idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, primary lymphangiectasia, lymphoma, and severe acute gastroenteritis. Certain breed predispositions, such as the soft-coated Wheaten Terrier, are well known. Our clinical experience suggests that pugs with PLE respond poorly to treatment, but this is not described in the literature. The aim of the current study was to assess whether the pug breed demonstrates a worse response to treatment for PLE than other breeds of dog. This was a retrospective study comparing the response to treatment in all pugs diagnosed with PLE between 2009 and 2018 in five referral centres in the United Kingdom. Approval for the study was granted by the University of Liverpool Research Ethics Committee. A group of non-pug dogs, also diagnosed with PLE within the same period, was selected for comparison. PLE was defined as any gastrointestinal disease resulting in serum albumin below the laboratory reference interval that could not be explained by another cause. Factors associated with survival were assessed using simple statistics (Mann-Whitney tests and chi-square test as appropriate) and Cox's proportional hazards regression. Initially, factors were tested individually using simple regression; a multiple regression model was then created, subsequently refined by backwards stepwise elimination until the best model was found. A total of 35 pugs were diagnosed with a PLE between 2009 and 2018 and were compared with 113 dogs from other breeds. On simple regression analysis, factors associated with survival (at P < 0.1) were pug breed (P = 0.002), diet used for treatment (P = 0.022), receiving immunosuppressive therapy (P = 0.089), and treatment with cobalamin (P = 0.005). However, the only factors that remained in the final model were the pug breed and the diet used for treatment. In this respect, dogs of the pug breed were associated with a greater hazard of dying (compared with non-pugs: hazards ratio [HR] 2.67 (CI 1.60-4.47; P < 0.001), whilst being fed a hydrolysed diet was associated with a lesser hazard risk of death than when fed other diets (compared with low-fat diets: HR 0.50, 95%-CI: 0.26-0.97; P = 0.042; compared with other diets including highly-digestible diets: HR 0.35, 95%-CI: 0.17-0.71; P = 0.004). In conclusion, this study demonstrated an association between the pug breed and a poorer response to treatment for PLE compared to other breeds. Further research should be undertaken as to the underlying cause. ABSTRACTS Disclosures to report.

Retrospective analysis of prevalence and clinical significance of hypo-or hyperfolataemia in dogs with chronic enteropathies A. Petrelli, S. Salavati Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies and the Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, United Kingdom Assessment of serum folate (SF) is routinely performed in dogs with chronic enteropathies (CE), most often in conjunction with serum cobalamin. Traditionally, their combination has been used to differentiate intestinal malabsorption from dysbiosis. Despite the fact that the diagnostic and prognostic value of serum cobalamin is well documented, the prevalence of hypo-and hyperfolataemia and the clinical and prognostic value of its assessment has not been scrutinised in dogs with CE. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of SF abnormalities in dogs with CE, as well as its relationship to other laboratory parameters and outcome. Files of dogs presented for chronic gastrointestinal (GI) signs (> 3 weeks duration) between 2014 and 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. Exclusion criteria were lack of SF assessment, and supplementation of folate or cobalamin beforehand. 321 dogs (100 FN, 109 MN, 34 FE, 78 ME; median age of 65 m, range 2-171) were included. Hypofolataemia was present in 97/321 (30%), hyperfolataemia in 86/321 (27%), with the remaining 138/321 dogs (43%) having normal SF values. Initially, dogs were divided into groups according to the final diagnosis: CE (n = 215), other GI disease (n = 76), non-GI disease (n = 30). SF values were not significantly different across those groups (Kruskal-Wallis, P = 0.83). When dividing CE dogs into different subgroups of food-(FRE), antibiotic-(ARE), steroid-responsive (SRE) or protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), no difference in SF values was observed (ANOVA, P = 0.92). When all dogs were grouped by their SF status (low, normal, high), significant differences in serum cobalamin (P = 0.001), alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.01), cholesterol (p = 0.03) and total calcium (p = 0.01) were identified (ANOVA, Dunn's post hoc test). Multivariate analysis confirmed the correlation between SF and cobalamin (P = 0.009), as well as cholesterol (P = 0.028) and total calcium (p = 0.038). However, none of these correlations were linear (Spearman, all P > 0.05). Kaplan Maier analysis of follow-up and survival times by SF status showed no significant differences. In conclusion, SF was not associated with GI disease or subgroup of CE. Improvement of clinical signs or survival was not associated with SF status. In this study, no diagnostic or prognostic benefit of assessing SF in dogs with chronic GI signs could be detected. Future prospective studies should assess if folate supplementation in the 30% of CE dogs with hypofolataemia can accelerate clinical improvement or influence outcome/ prognosis. Acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea syndrome (AHDS) in dogs is often treated with antibiotics due to the potential risk of bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract to the blood stream. However, recent studies indicate that antibiotics are not always necessary. According to the Danish antibiotic use guidelines for companion animals 2012, antibiotics are not recommended for routine treatment of AHDS but only indicated in hospitalized dogs with severely affected overall condition and signs of systemic inflammation (SIRS)/sepsis. The aim of this study was to evaluate severity of disease and outcome in hospitalized dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea that did not receive antibiotics. The study was performed as a retrospective, observational study based on information from medical records for dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea of unknown aetiology, hospitalized at the University Hospital for Companion Animals during the period 25/2-2014 to 9/10-2018. Signalments, concurrent diseases, clinical disease at the time of hospitalization and during each consecutive day, treatment prior to and during hospitalization, days of hospitalization/euthanasia and laboratory results were registered for each patient. Clinical disease was scored according to the AHDS-scoring system from 0-18 and the number of SIRS criteria (tachycardia (HR > 120), tachypnea (RR > 40), hyper or hypothermia (T > 39.0 C or < 37.5 C), leucocytosis (WBC > 18*10 9 / L), leukopenia (WBC < 5*10 9 /L, band neutrophilia and/or hypoglycaemia [glucose <4 mmol/L]) were recorded. One-hundred and seventy-two dogs were excluded from the analysis due to suspected drug induced disease (vaccination(s) (N = 4), anaesthetics (N = 5), corticosteroids or NSAIDs (N = 81)), alimentary foreign body (N = 5) or treatment with antibiotics during hospitalization (N = 128). Of the 128 dogs, where an obvious cause for the diarrhoea were not found and that only received supportive treatment (intravenous fluid therapy N = 128; antiemetics N = 98; gastroprotectants N = 107), 98% survived to discharge (125/128 dogs). Two dogs were euthanized due to financial constraints and reluctance from the owner to proceed with further treatment due to advanced age and one brachycephalic dog suffered a respiratory crisis with respiratory arrest nonresponsive to resuscitation. The surviving 125 dogs were hospitalized for an average of 1.7 days (range 1-4 days) with a mean AHDS-score of 12 at hospitalization (range 4-16). The mean AHDS-score after 24 hours of hospitalization was 5.5 (range 0-14). 29% (37/128) of the ABSTRACTS 341 dogs met ≥2 SIRS criteria during hospitalization. None of the 128 dogs had a degenerative left-shift. These results suggest that antimicrobial therapy in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea may not always be necessary in dogs even when 2 or more SIRS-criteria are met. Recent studies have shown alterations in faecal bile acid (BA) profiles in dogs with chronic enteropathy, potentially contributing to clinical signs. The study aim was to assess faecal BA concentrations in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea syndrome (AHDS-D) over time and to compare it to that of healthy control dogs (HC-D). Twenty-five AHDS-D and 53 HC-D were enrolled. Faecal BA concentrations were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry on days 0, 2, 7, and 14 in AHDS-D, and on day 0 in HC-D. Statistical analysis was performed with Friedman test for comparison of BA over time in AHDS-D, and unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney-test for comparison between AHDS-D and HC-D (P < 0.05). On day 0, concentration of lithocholic acid was significantly lower in AHDS-D than in HC-D (p < 0.001). On day 2, total faecal BA were significantly increased in AHDS-D (p < 0.001) compared to HC-D. More precisely, primary BA were significantly increased in AHDS-D on day 2 (P = 0.034) with significantly higher concentration of cholic acid (p = 0.004), while secondary BA were significantly decreased (p < 0.001) with significantly lower concentrations of deoxycholic acid (p < 0.001) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (p < 0.001). Dogs in AHDS-D showed a significant decrease in total primary BA concentrations (P = 0.021) with significantly lower concentrations of cholic acid (P = 0.027) and deoxycholic acid (p = 0.021) on day 14 compared to day 2. In conclusion, AHDS-D show alterations in faecal BA profiles compared to HC-D. However, faecal BA profiles normalize rapidly suggesting that BA dysmetabolism does not seem to play a major role in the pathophysiology of AHDS. Pimobendan is frequently used off-label for treatment of cats with congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary hypertrophy cardiomyopathy (HCM). Concerns exist regarding the safety of pimobendan in the subset of cats with HCM and dynamic outflow tract obstruction (HOCM). The purpose of this study was to evaluate safety and tolerability of pimobendan in cats with CHF secondary to HOCM compared with nonobstructive HCM. Medical records from 94 cats with CHF (47 with HOCM, 47 with nonobstructive HCM) at two tertiary referral hospitals were reviewed. Demographic, clinicopathologic, echocardiographic, and treatment data were collected and compared between groups, including information regarding possible adverse effects of pimobendan. Average age of cats (9 +/− 4 years) did not differ between HOCM and HCM (P = 0.12). Compared to cats with HCM, cats with HOCM were more likely to manifest CHF as pulmonary edema (44/47 versus 32/47; P = 0.003) and less likely to have pleural effusion (13/47 versus 25/47; P = 0.02). Other than a higher incidence of heart murmurs in cats with HOCM (P < 0.001), clinical variables did not differ between groups. Pimobendan was typically initiated on the date of CHF diagnosis (median time from diagnosis of CHF to initiation of pimobendan was 0 days). Initial dose of pimobendan was 0.25 +/− 0.07 mg/kg every 12 hours; dose (or frequency) was escalated at some point during CHF management in 31/94 (33%) of cases, with no difference between HOCM and HCM cats. Clinical signs that could potentially represent adverse effects of pimobendan (vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, lethargy, new-onset arrhythmias) were noted in 13/47 (28%) HCM cats and 9/47 (19%) HOCM cats (P = 0.34). Based on patterns of timing and resolution, these signs were generally ascribed to recurrence of CHF rather than pimobendan administration. Pimobendan was discontinued due to adverse effects in only 1 cat with nonobstructive HCM that experienced lethargy and nausea 2-3 hours following pimobendan administration (resolved when pimobendan discontinued). Pimobendan was discontinued in 7 additional cats, either because owners were unable to administer the medication (n = 2) or because CHF had resolved (n = 5 cases where CHF was precipitated by an acute external event, such as fluid overload or injectable glucocorticoid administration). No cats experienced acute adverse hemodynamic effects (hypotension, cardiovascular collapse) following pimobendan administration. Results of this study suggest that pimobendan is well-tolerated in cats with cardiomyopathy and CHF, regardless of presence of dynamic outflow tract obstruction. Systolic heart murmurs (SM) are commonly diagnosed in healthy cats. The aim of this study was to determine whether the aorto-septal angle (AoSA) is associated with SM in cats. More, we hypothesised that SM are related to the presence of septal bulge, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM) and increased aortic flow velocity (AoV). Between November 2014 and February 2018, 316 client owned cats referred for a cardiology evaluation were prospectively examined. Regardless the presence of a systolic murmur, cats with a ABSTRACTS Pathways that disrupt the cardiovascular-renal axis in dogs are incompletely defined. The renal endothelin (ET-1) system may play a key role because it regulates blood pressure and sodium homeostasis in the kidney, but also mediates vascular dysfunction and pro-fibrotic/ inflammatory changes that increase cardiovascular risk in people. Urinary ET-1 (UET-1) is a marker of renal vascular and tubular ET-1 activity, and so could provide insight into changes in renal ET-1 signalling that contribute to cardiovascular-renal interactions in dogs. We hypothesised that renal ET-1 activity increases in advanced canine chronic cardiac and renal diseases. In this pilot study, we compared UET-1 and cystatin C (a marker of renal injury/dysfunction) concentrations in surplus urine from four ABSTRACTS Complete and balanced diets, one test and one control, were evaluated in this prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study for effect on clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic parameters in forty-four client-owned cats with asymptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (aHCM). Cats with diastolic interventricular septum (IVSd) and/or left ventricular wall (LVWd) thickness ≥ 6 mm were included after informed ownerconsent. Examination of non-sedated, fasted cats before and after 6 and 12 months of test or control diet included auscultation, bodyweight (BW), body condition score (BCS) and echocardiography. Wall Clinical environment can be stressful for cats, thereby affecting blood pressure (BP) recordings. The aim was to investigate how different clinical settings, and the order (sequence) in which settings are performed, affect BP recordings in healthy cats. Ninety-six healthy cats were prospectively included. The health examination included physical examination, echocardiography, hematology, and biochemistry. Blood pressure was measured with a high-definition oscillometric (HDO) device, with cuff on tail in three clinical settings; (1) cat taken out of its carrier and placed on examination table with veterinarian present, (2) cat in its own carrier with veterinarian present, or (3) cat in its own carrier without veterinarian present.
