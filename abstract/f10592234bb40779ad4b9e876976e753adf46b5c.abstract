Provide cut-off times for processing test requests and turnaround times for reporting results Provide guidelines for specimen collection and transport Maintain an effective computerized system for acknowledging receipt of specimens, testing in-progress, and reporting of results; immediate notification to the physician of critical results should be a component of an overall communication system Periodic publication of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for the most commonly isolated bacteria in the institution Maintain a program of quality control that ensures the accuracy of all offered tests Establish a laboratory that conforms to regulatory standards A system of short-term storage of all specimens and long-term storage of important isolates should be established to facilitate additional testing if required Maintain knowledge of the laboratory test menu and specimen collection and transport guidelines Alert the laboratory when a specific organism is sought (e.g., a fastidious or highly pathogenic organism) Establish an open communication with the laboratory director when testing needs are not satisfied by the available test menu or special handling of a specimen is required Aspirate of pus or fluid in anaerobic transport vial is preferred; swabs usually have insufficient material for stains and culture. Clean surface of closed abscess with 70% alcohol; collect specimens at margins of abscess. Aspirates in anaerobic transport tubes are acceptable for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures. Specimen sent immediately in capped syringe after the air is excluded is also acceptable. Specify location of abscess for optimal processing; provide all other pertinent information (e.g., surgical infection, trauma, bite wound). Routine aerobic and anaerobic bacteria Disinfect bottle tops with 70% isopropyl alcohol; disinfect phlebotomy site with alcohol, followed by tincture of iodine or chlorhexidine; allow the disinfectants to dry. Collect 10-20 mL/adults and 1-3 mL/child for each blood culture; divide blood into two blood culture bottles, preferably an aerobic and an anaerobic bottle; collect two to three cultures per 24-hr period.
