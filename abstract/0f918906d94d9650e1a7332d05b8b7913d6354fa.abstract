Many viruses induce hepatitis in humans, highlighting the need to understand the underlying mechanisms of virus-induced liver pathology. The murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), causes acute hepatitis in its natural host and provides a useful model for understanding virus interaction with liver cells. The MHV accessory protein, ns2, antagonizes the type I interferon response and promotes hepatitis. We show that ns2 has 2 0 ,5 0 -phosphodiesterase activity, which blocks the interferon inducible 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway to facilitate hepatitis development. Ns2 cleaves 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylate, the product of OAS, to prevent activation of the cellular endoribonuclease RNase L and consequently block viral RNA degradation. An ns2 mutant virus was unable to replicate in the liver or induce hepatitis in wild-type mice, but was highly pathogenic in RNase L deficient mice. Thus, RNase L is a critical cellular factor for protection against viral infection of the liver and the resulting hepatitis.

At the indicated times, titers of viruses in the cell lysates combined with supernatants were determined by plaque assay (n = 3). (C) BMMs derived from B6 or RNase L À/À mice were infected (MOI = 0.01 PFU/cell). At 48 hr p.i., the cells were stained with anti-MHV N antibody and Hoechst. The scale bar represents 100 mm.
