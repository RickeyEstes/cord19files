Excessive stimulation by the octapeptide angiotensin II contributes to a range of cardiovascular pathologies and diseases via angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT 1 R) activation. On the other hand, tElsevier Inc.he angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT 2 R) is thought to counter-regulate AT 1 R function. In this review, we describe the enhanced expression and function of AT 2 R in various cardiovascular disease settings. In addition, we illustrate that the RAS consists of a family of angiotensin peptides that exert cardiovascular effects that are often distinct from those of Ang II. During cardiovascular disease, there is likely to be an increased functional importance of AT 2 R, stimulated by Ang II, or even shorter angiotensin peptide fragments, to limit AT 1 R-mediated overactivity and cardiovascular pathologies.
