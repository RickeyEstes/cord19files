Influenza A virus (IAV) and influenza B virus (IBV) cause yearly epidemics with significant 25 morbidity and mortality. When zoonotic IAVs enter the human population, the viral 26 hemagglutinin (HA) requires adaptation to achieve sustained virus transmission. In 27 contrast, IBV has been circulating in humans, its only host, for a long period of time. 28 Whether this entailed adaptation of IBV HA to the human airways is unknown. To address 29 this question, we compared seasonal IAV (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and IBV viruses 30 (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineage) with regard to host-dependent activity of HA as the 31 mediator of membrane fusion during viral entry. We first investigated proteolytic activation 32 of HA, by covering all type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) and kallikrein 33 enzymes, many of which proved present in human respiratory epithelium. Compared to 34 IAV, the IBV HA0 precursor is cleaved by a broader panel of TTSPs and activated with 35 much higher efficiency. Accordingly, knockdown of a single protease, TMPRSS2, was 36 sufficient to abrogate spread of IAV but not IBV in human respiratory epithelial cells. 37 Second, the HA fusion pH proved similar for IBV and human-adapted IAVs (one exception 38 being HA of 1918 IAV). Third, IBV HA exhibited higher expression at 33°C, a temperature 39 required for membrane fusion by B/Victoria HA. This indicates pronounced adaptation of 40 IBV HA to the mildly acidic pH and cooler temperature of human upper airways. These 41 distinct and intrinsic features of IBV HA are compatible with extensive host-adaptation 42 during prolonged circulation of this respiratory virus in the human population. 43 2 All rights reserved.

IBV causes 45 substantial disease, however it is far less studied than IAV. While IAV originates from animal 46 reservoirs, IBV circulates in humans only. Virus spread requires that the viral hemagglutinin (HA) 47 is active and sufficiently stable in human airways. We here resolve how these mechanisms differ 48 between IBV and IAV. Whereas human IAVs rely on one particular protease for HA activation, this 49 is not the case for IBV. Superior activation of IBV by several proteases should enhance shedding 50 of infectious particles. IBV HA exhibits acid-stability and a preference for 33°C, indicating 51 pronounced adaptation to the human upper airways, where the pH is mildly acidic and a cooler 52 temperature exists. These adaptive features are rationalized by the long existence of IBV in 53 humans, and may have broader relevance for understanding the biology and evolution of 54 respiratory viruses. 55 3 All rights reserved.

Gene reassortment between the two lineages is common yet 66 not seen for the HA, PB1 and PB2 gene segments (7). Whereas IAV is widespread in 67 birds and mammals (8), IBV is restricted to humans with no sustained animal reservoir (9) 68 and only rare spillover events (10). When a zoonotic IAV enters the human population, 69 adaptive changes in multiple viral proteins are required to achieve sustained human-to-70 human transmissibility (11). Which adaptive features were acquired by IBV as a result of 71 its long existence in humans has hardly been investigated (9). 72 73 One major protein involved in this host adaptation is the viral hemagglutinin (HA), the 74 mediator of viral entry (12, 13). HA binds to sialylated glycans on the cell surface to enable 75 virus uptake by endocytosis. Next, HA mediates fusion of the viral envelope and 76 endosomal membrane, allowing release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. 77 Membrane fusion occurs when virus-containing endosomes mature from early (pH ~6) to 78 4 All rights reserved.

To gain membrane fusion-competence, HA relies on 80 host cell proteases for posttranslational cleavage of the HA0 precursor into two 81 polypeptides, HA1 and HA2, a process termed priming or activation (15). In human IAV 82 and IBV strains, HA0 has a monobasic (single arginine) cleavage site that is recognized 83 by trypsin-like serine proteases. Understanding the protease dependency of HA might 84 reveal biological differences between IAV and IBV, and direct drug concepts to target 85 these proteases for influenza therapy (16, 17). A series of proteases have been proposed 86 for IAV (reviewed by Böttcher-Friebertshäuser et al. (18)), but for IBV hardly any 87 information is available. The type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) TMPRSS2 88 (transmembrane protease serine 2) is an activator of IAV HA0 in cell culture and essential 89 for IAV replication in mice, at least for some IAV subtypes (19-22). In humans, a gene 90 polymorphism leading to higher TMPRSS2 expression was correlated with the risk for 91 developing severe influenza (23). In cell culture, IAV can also be activated by some other 92 TTSPs and kallikreins, but which of these support spread of IAV in human airways remains 93 to be demonstrated [reviewed in: (16, 24)]. Regarding IBV, TMPRSS2 was shown to 94 cleave IBV HA0 (17) and mediate virus spread in some human airway cell culture models 95 (25), however this protease appeared dispensable for IBV pathogenesis in mice (26). 96 Hence, the protease recognition profile of IBV HA is largely unknown. 97 98 Two other adaptive features of HA are related to its pH-and temperature-dependence. 99 Again, data for IBV are very limited. Successful virus replication and transmission require 100 a balance between the low pH that triggers HA refolding and membrane fusion during viral 101 entry, and acid-stability of progeny virus in the respiratory tract and environment (27, 28). 102 5 All rights reserved.

The acid-stability of HA appears 104 to increase when a zoonotic IAV enters the human population and evolves into a human-105 to-human transmissible strain (31, 32). Studies in ferrets showed that increased IAV HA 106 acid-stability contributes to airborne transmissibility (31, 33, 34). In addition, human 107 airways exhibit a temperature gradient, from ~30-32°C in the nasal mucosa (35), to ~32°C 108 in the upper trachea and ~36°C in the bronchi (36). Avian IAVs, adapted to the 109 temperature of the avian enteric tract (40°C), show restricted growth at cooler 110 temperatures (~32°C).
