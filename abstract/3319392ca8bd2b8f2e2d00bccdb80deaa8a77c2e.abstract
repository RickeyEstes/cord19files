The ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia in China and beyond is associated with a novel 28 coronavirus, provisionally termed 2019-nCoV. This outbreak has been tentatively associated 29 with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of 30 zoonotic infection. Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for 2019-nCoV, the identity of 31 any intermediate host facilitating transfer to humans is unknown. Here, we report the 32 identification of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in 33 anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin 34 associated CoVs that belong to two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses, 35 including one very closely related to 2019-nCoV in the receptor-binding domain. The 36 discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to 2019-nCoV 37 suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts for this novel 38 human virus and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.
