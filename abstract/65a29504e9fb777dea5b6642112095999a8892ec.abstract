Determination of the UspA1 crystal structure Crystals of UspA1 were grown by vapour diffusion from 12 % PEG 3350 and 0.2 M ammonium phosphate, to which 25 % glycerol was added before cooling to 100K. Diffraction data were collected on beamline BM14 (λ= 0.95350 Å) at ESRF Grenoble, France, and at the Daresbury SRS. Data were integrated and scaled in HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) and manipulated with the CCP4 suite of crystallographic software (1994). The structure was solved by a novel exploratory molecular replacement method using in excess of 20 different coiled-coil structures as search models in the program PHASER (McCoy et al., 2005) . The coordinates of a single strand of the coiled coil of cortexellin (1D7M.pdb), which has no recognisable sequence identity to UspA1 , was eventually successful despite being from a dimeric coiled coil. Solutions from PHASER had Z scores of 6 and 13 after rotation and translation respectively to find the first molecule in the asymmetric unit, and 5 and 9 for the second molecule.
