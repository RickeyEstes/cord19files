Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has infected millions of people in Africa, Europe, and Asia1,2 since its re-emergence in Kenya in 2004. The severity of disease and spread of this epidemic virus present a serious public health threat in the absence of vaccines or anti-viral therapies. Here, we describe a novel vaccine that protects against emerging CHIKV infection of non-human primates (NHP). We show that selective expression of viral structural proteins gives rise to virus-like particles (VLPs) in vitro that resemble replication-competent alphaviruses. Immunization with these VLPs elicited neutralizing antibodies against envelope proteins from different CHIKV strains. Monkeys immunized with VLPs produced high titer neutralizing antibodies that protected against viremia after high dose challenge. We transferred these antibodies into immunodeficient mice, where they protected against subsequent lethal CHIKV challenge, establishing a humoral mechanism of protection. Immunization with alphavirus VLP vaccines represents a strategy to contain the spread of CHIKV and related pathogenic viruses in humans. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne alphavirus in the family Togaviridae, was first isolated in Tanzania in 19523. Infection by this virus in humans is characterized by rash, high fever and, its hallmark feature, severe arthritis that can persist for years1,2. An epidemic strain of CHIKV appeared on Reunion Island in 2005 and has since spread to more than 18 countries4 (see also http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/chikungunya/ CH_GlobalMap.html). Dissemination of this epidemic virus is associated with genetic mutations that facilitate adaptation to a new insect vector, the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes
