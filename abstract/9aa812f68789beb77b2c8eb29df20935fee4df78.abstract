Objective: Neopterin is generated and released in increased amounts by macrophages upon activation by interferon-g during Th1-type immune response. The potential usefulness of neopterin in early prognostic information of dengue virus infection was investigated. Methods: Neopterin concentrations were determined in serum samples from 110 dengue fever (DF) patients. The neopterin levels were compared with those in 50 measles and 40 influenza patients; 155 healthy blood donors served as controls. Results: In acute sera of DF patients mean neopterin concentration was 48.2 nmol/ L, which was higher than that in patients with measles (mean: 36.3 nmol/L) and influenza (18.8 nmol/L) and in healthy controls (6.7 nmol/L; P < 0.001).
