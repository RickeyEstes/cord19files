T GVN centers. In contrast to previous GVN meetings (4-5 oral presentations on related subjects in each block) sessions were arranged as a series of talks that covered a quite diverse repertoire of issues of interest to virologists around the world. Criteria for the selection of this award include: 1. The candidate has published important scientific information on virology in the areas of interest to the GVN, including but not limited to: basic science, clinical aspects, pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnostics, antivirals, and vaccine development. 2. The candidate has made a consequential and meaningful contribution to the GVN and has furthered the mission of the GVN, including but not limited to; development of the network of Centers of Excellence, participation in training programs, contributions to meetings and other GVN activities, and contributions to advocacy and public communication activities. The 2019 Robert C. Gallo award for scientific excellence and leadership was awarded to Dr. William Hall, GVN Co-founder. Scientific presentations Scott C Weaver (University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston, USA) gave an overview on the history and the distribution of Zika virus (ZIKV). He summarized the recent epidemic of ZIKV in the Americas and depicted the association between ZIKV and microcephaly that was established late in 2015. He then illustrated the reaction of GVN with the assembly of a global Zika Task Force that was established within three months after the association between ZIKV infection and microcephaly was recognized. This task force gathered experts on flaviviruses, arboviruses, and viral congenital diseases from 13 GVN centers from 13 countries. Besides communication of the latest information on ZIKV and the distribution of expert reviews (Weaver et al., 2016) the task force, which was supported by a private donation, established the GVN ZIKV Serum Bank. This serum bank collected and characterized more the 100 sera from donors who had been exposed in different countries all across South and Latin America. They made this collection of highly characterized sera available to international expert labs by providing lyophilized aliquots. They further provided a collection of ZIKV strains, different virus antigens, and two cDNA infectious clones. Weaver also reported on ZIKV vaccine strains that were attenuated through deletions in the 3′UTR. As a DNA-launched ZIKV live-attenuated vaccine, having a 20-nucleotide deletion, this mutant virus gave rise to high antibody titers after a single immunization and was highly protective in a ZIKV mouse model, as well as, in a rhesus macaque infection model (Zou et al., 2018) . Núria Busquets (Centre de Recerca en Sanitat Animal, Spain) highlighted the importance of arboviruses as pathogens and focused on the surveillance of vectors and animal reservoirs. She gave a short overview on the emergence of arboviruses which over the last 40 years has become an important global public health threat causing significant morbidity and mortality among humans and animals. While for Chikungunya, Dengue, and Zika virus carrying mosquitos easily can spread also other arboviruses, e.g. Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV), and West Nile virus (WNV), there is a critical role for vertebrate hosts as animal reservoirs. Dr. Busquets stressed that good surveillance data are the base for intervention strategies thus helping to protect public health and to save money. Thus, detailed knowledge on which mosquitoe species are competent hosts for the virus and where and when these mosquitoes are present, as well as, on which the vertebrate hosts are the reservoir and their presence are important. So is the knowledge on the kinetics of R. Akkina, et al.
