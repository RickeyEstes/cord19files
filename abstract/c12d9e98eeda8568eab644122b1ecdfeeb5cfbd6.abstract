Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) is a C-type lectin receptor that recognizes N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides and branched fucosylated structures. It is primarily expressed by dendritic cells and mediates the capture, destruction and presentation of microbial pathogens to induce successful immune responses. Furthermore, DC-SIGN is involved in the priming of T-cell responses and facilitates dendritic cell homeostasis by controlling extravasation into peripheral tissues. However, an increasing amount of evidence suggests that pathogens also exploit DC-SIGN to subvert host immune responses. Herein, we discuss the current state of knowledge of DC-SIGNcarbohydrate interactions and investigate how these interactions influence dendritic cell functioning. First, an overview of the structure of DC-SIGN is provided and its expression pattern among immune cells is discussed. After this, the molecular aspects that underlie the selectivity of DC-SIGN for mannoseand fucose-containing carbohydrates are detailed. Finally, the role of DC-SIGN in dendritic cell biology is discussed and how certain bacterial pathogens exploit DC-SIGN to escape immune surveillance. 34
