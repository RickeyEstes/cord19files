METHODS Subjects with CF were recruited from the two CF centres by personal invitation from the Investigators (SCB, CEW) or the Study Coordinators (MEW, JC). All CF patients were >12-years of age, had chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and at least one positive sputum culture in the prior 12-months. The majority of patients were studied during clinical stability, however, four patients were studied close to the completion of intravenous antibiotics for logistic reasons (e.g. travelling long distance, avoid missing school attendance). Healthy control participants were recruited from contact with staff at both healthcare facilities including relatives of the staff for the younger controls. Nineteen CF patients with CF and 10 healthy controls participated. Two patients and two controls performed only one of the experiment days. The Distance Rig consisted of an expandable wind tunnel that allowed high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered air to be introduced upstream of the subject;[1] ensuring unidirectional air flow of particle-free air and permitting measurement of cough aerosols at distances of 0 to 4-metres from the subject without interference from other particle sources ( Figure E1 ). The air velocity was maintained at 0.1-metres/sec, typical of a mechanicallyventilated indoor environment, such as a hospital.[2-4] The Rig was positively pressurized to prevent room air contamination. A six-stage Andersen Impactor (Thermo Scientific, Franklin, MA) captured and sized viable cough aerosols in the six stages between 0.6 and >7 m. [5] A vacuum pump was used to draw 28.3 L/min of air through the Impactor. The pump flow was checked daily using a rotameter, and all Andersen Impactor O-rings were inspected for wear. Exhaust air from the pump was HEPA-filtered. A Lasair II-110 (Particle Measuring Systems, Boulder, CO) optical particle counter (OPC) measured real-time particle concentration in six channels between 0.1 and >5 µm using a sample flow of 28.3 L/min, permitting detection of very low concentrations. The OPC verified that there were no room air particles present before each test, subjects' lungs were free of residual room air, and no contamination of aerosols occurred during testing. It also confirmed that the total particle concentration in the Rig was <0.01 particles per cm 3 (p/cc) prior to the subject coughing, which was approximately 10 4 times lower than the room air concentration and similar to an ISO 4 cleanroom. The Andersen Impactor and OPC samples were collected through a common 12.5 cm circular, sharp-edged isokinetic inlet. It was set parallel to the airflow and provided 100% particle aspiration efficiency at the tunnel air velocity of 0.1 metres/sec. [6] Smoke visualization tests confirmed sample extraction by the inlet was uniform. One metre of conductive tubing transported samples from the inlet to the Andersen Impactor and OPC. The tubing residence time was 1-sec for Andersen samples and 0.06-sec for OPC samples. Sample losses due to gravitational settling and inertial impaction were from 0 to 8% and 0 to 1%, respectively, and diffusion losses were negligible.[6] Air velocity was monitored continuously using a 9535 hot-wire anemometer (TSI Inc., St. Paul, MN). Temperature and water vapour concentration were measured simultaneously work environments are related to indoor air symptoms. J Occup Environ Med 2007;49(6):641-50. 3. Baldwin PE, Maynard AD.
