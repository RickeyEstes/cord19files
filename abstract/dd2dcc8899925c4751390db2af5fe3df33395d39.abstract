Historically, public health agencies, emergency departments, and emergency medical services (EMS) systems have functioned independently from one another and have typically maintained informational systems that were not interactive. Given the rapid growth in information technology, exchange of information has an unprecedented potential for addressing public health emergencies in a timely and effective manner, yet this exchange of information goes largely unrealized. Essential communication links are required within and between public-safety and public-service communication systems. Units from two or more different agencies must be able to interact with one another and to exchange essential information to coordi-nate operations in an effective manner. Exchange of information often requires communication between governmental and nongovernmental public-safety and publicservice providers. Interoperability in communications can be defined as the ability of first-responders to communicate in the field across agency and jurisdictional lines. In this context, we use interoperability as a very broad term, incorporating all aspects of collaboration and interaction that are needed among all responders during a masscasualty event. To promote linkages in communication between various stakeholders involved in acute care, EMS, and public health, a twoday meeting was convened on July 8 and 9, 2003, in Washington, DC. The purpose of this meeting was to identify opportunities for the rapid exchange of information, with the theory that interactive information systems between EMS physicians and public health agencies would strengthen day-to-day operations and better prepare systems for catastrophic events. The meeting featured presentations from experts in communications, EMS, acute care, public health, and hospital care. Presenters were asked to identify problem areas and opportunities for improving linkages between EMS, acute care, and public health. These presentations were used to stimulate discussion among all attendees on each of these topics, and to develop strategies for improvement. The meeting attendees and the organizations they represented are shown in Appendix C. A writing team was assembled before the conference, whose charge it was to analyze the information presented at the meeting and produce this overview based on the proceedings. The proceedings were divided into five general areas: communications, EMS, acute care, public health, and hospital care. What follows is a summary of each of the meeting topics. INTEROPERABILITY IN EMS COMMUNICATIONS The role of public-safety communicators has been the recent focus of media attention,
