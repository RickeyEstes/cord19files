Closed/primary interface For domain-swapped proteins, the intermolecular interfaces in the oligomer that possess identical intramolecular counterparts in the monomer form are called the 'closed' or primary interface. Domain swapping Domain swapping is a special type of oligomerization, during which two or more homo-polypeptide chains exchange identical units. The hinge loop is the only region of the protein that adopts a different conformation in monomeric and domain-swapped structures. Morpheeins Special cases of multimers are the so-called morpheeins, which are homo-oligomeric proteins that can switch their structure between functionally distinct alternate quaternary states. Open/secondary interface For domain-swapped proteins, the newly created contact surfaces in the oligomer constitute the 'open' or secondary interface.
