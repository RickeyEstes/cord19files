Use nonlinear dynamical method to model the YRD urban agglomerations ESER system. The YRD urban agglomerations ESER system has stronger capacity to resist concussion. Carbon tax is more suited for the development of ESER in YRD urban agglomerations. The measures to promote development of carbon tax properly are put forward.
