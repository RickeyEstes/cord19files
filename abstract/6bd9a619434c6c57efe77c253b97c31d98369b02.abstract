Acute transverse myelitis is a rare spinal cord inflammatory disorder that manifests as sudden onset of motor, sensory, and autonomic dysfunctions. Here, we report a case of acute transverse myelitis in a 13year-old boy secondary to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. He presented with left facial palsy and contralateral upper extremity weakness without sensory or autonomic changes. The patient was diagnosed with transverse myelitis based on his magnetic resonance imaging findings, although his presentation was mainly motor dysfunction, which is more consistent with acute flaccid paralysis. A 13-year-old previously healthy boy presented to the emergency department (ED) in August 2018 with neck pain and left sided facial drooping which started on the day of presentation. He had history of nasal congestion, cough, and fever for five days. He was initially diagnosed with Bell's palsy and started on prednisone. The patient returned to the ED two days later with new onset right shoulder and arm weakness. He was tachypneic to 32 breaths/minute, tachycardic to 108 beats/minute, and afebrile with normal blood pressure. He was alert and oriented with Glasgow coma scale 15/15. Neurological examination was significant for left facial drooping and inability to fully close his left eye. He had neck weakness as well and was unable to hold his head unsupported. Pupils were equal and reactive to light. Muscle strength in the right upper extremity was 1/5 proximally and 4/5 distally. He had normal strength of left upper extremity and both lower extremities. Reflexes were absent in right biceps
