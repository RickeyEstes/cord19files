A. The basic reproduction number R 0 of system (1) Through simple calculation, we can obtain a disease free equilibrium E 1 = (S 1 , 0, 0, 0, 0, R 1 ). Then we use the spectral radius of the next generation matrix (the method proposed by the Van Den Driessche in [1]) to get the expression of R 0 of system (1) . Firstly, only the infected compartments satisfied by the following system are considered: where F denotes the rate of appearance of new infection and V denotes the rate of transfer of individuals. Calculating the derivative of F and V about x = (E, A, I, H), respectively. Then substitute initial data(S 0 , E 0 , A 0 , I 0 , H 0 , R 0 ) into variables, we can get: and thus where R 0 is the biggest eigenvalue of matrix F V −1 i.e. R 0 = ρ(F V −1 ). The expression of R 0 is as follows:
