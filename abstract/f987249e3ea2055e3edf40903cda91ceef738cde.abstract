KEYWORDS Prematurity Neonatal immunology Neonatal infection Virus Lymphocytes Bronchopulmonary dysplasia Chronic lung disease of prematurity Preterm In the first year of life, preterm infants are rehospitalized twofold to fivefold times more frequently than infants born at term, primarily for respiratory symptoms. Mediators of inflammation tend to enhance lung maturation but impair alveolar septation and developmental vascular remodeling. The developmental age of the immune system at birth, and at early-age infections, may significantly alter the acute response, and the sequelae, to inflammatory stimuli. Prenatal and postnatal infection and immune responses contribute to the severity of chronic lung disease of prematurity. Clin Perinatol 42 (2015) 697-718 http://dx.
