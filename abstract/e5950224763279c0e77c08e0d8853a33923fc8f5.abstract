Randy S. Wax, MD, MEd, FRCPC, FCCM There are 4 phases of disaster management: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. This article focuses on critical care preparedness aspects of disaster management by discussing what disaster scenarios should be considered, who should be involved in disaster preparedness, and some recommendations for preparedness efforts. Effective preparedness will increase the effectiveness of disaster mitigation, disaster response, and disaster recovery. Unfortunately, interest in disaster preparedness waxes and wanes depending on the temporal proximity of the latest disaster threat, and often focuses efforts on the last disaster instead of the next one. 1 Disaster preparedness must strike a balance between all-hazards and hazard-specific approaches. The all-hazards approach takes into account generic threats to critical care demand and supply issues regardless of the cause of the disaster or surge event.

A critical care-specific hazard-vulnerability analysis can be conducted to identify priorities for hazard-specific planning. When a critical care team prepares for disaster, the entire interprofessional team should have an opportunity for input. Broad stakeholder input from other services within the hospital should also be sought, especially when planning for special populations, such as pediatric and obstetric critically ill patients. Critical care teams should regularly participate in disaster exercises to test and refine their plans based on immediate and delayed reflective feedback. Focus should include practice of unfamiliar tasks (eg, hospital incident command system, disaster triage, biohazard infection control) and use of disaster-specific equipment (eg, advanced personal protective equipment, stockpile mechanical ventilators).
