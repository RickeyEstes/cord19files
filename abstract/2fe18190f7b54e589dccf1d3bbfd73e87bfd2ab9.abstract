12 The current classification of animal viruses primarily relates to the virus molecular world, the 13 genomic architecture and the corresponding host-cell infection cycle. This virus centered 14 perspective does not make allowance for the precept that virus fitness hinges on the virus 15 transmission success. Virus transmission reflects the infection-shedding-transmission 16 dynamics and, with it, the organ system involvement and other, macroscopic dimensions of 17 the host environment. This study examines the transmission ecology of the world main 18 livestock viruses, 36 in total, belonging to eleven different families, and a mix of RNA, DNA 19 and retroviruses. Viruses are virtually ranked in an outer-to inner-body fashion, based on 20 the shifting organ system involvement and associated infection-shedding-transmission 21 dynamics. As a next step, this ranking is disentangled with the aim to contrast two main host 22 45 the virus. Two opposing virus evolution pathways emerge, respectively for generalist type, 46 outer-body and for specialist, inner-body viruses.
