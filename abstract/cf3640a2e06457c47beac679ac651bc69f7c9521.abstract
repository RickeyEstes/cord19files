Many different agents, incding mineri oil and silicone, have the capacity to act as immunoloajal adjuvants i.e., they can contribute to the activaton of the immune stem. Some adjumants, inldudbig mineral oil, asre known to induce arthritis in certain stain of-rats after mal injecton or pcutaneous The aim of.this suy was to dete if common commeial cosmetic prd&coaning mal oil could induce arthrtis in th higWy suseptbe DA (DarkAgouti) rat Intadmal injecrion offive out ofeight assyed cosmetic products without fiurte additv resulted iart is with:synovitis.One ofthe pr indied avery ag:garth , which had delined after 5-9 weeks. 'When this product w also ed for ariae upon pcutaneous administrtion, it induced a mild and transitat atitis in 5 our of 10 DA rats, whera control animals showed no linici involvement No arthitic reactn ws sen in rats after peroral feedlug with the most togenprout or by intra plic tion ofFreunds adjuvants. Silicone gel implnts in DA rats did not cause arthritis. We con de that mineral oiLs induded in common commercially aaila;blel productsran theradj n ties and are a it ic in the presendy investigated arthriis-prone rat strain. There is yet no evidence that mineral oils present in mics may con tbu o arthritis in human but we suggest that this paesion should be subject to fiuther investigation. 1&ywon& adjuvants, arthritis, cosmetic products, mineral oil, rats, silicone gel.
