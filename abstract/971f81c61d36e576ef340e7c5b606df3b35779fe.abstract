We report in this Letter the synthesis of prodrugs of 2-fluoro-2-deoxyarabinose-1-phosphate and 2,2-difluoro-2-deoxyribose-1-phosphate. We demonstrate the difficulty of realising a phosphorylation step on the anomeric position of 2-deoxyribose, and we discover that introduction of fluorine atoms on the 2 position of 2-deoxyribose enables the phosphorylation step: in fact, the stability of the prodrugs increases with the degree of 2-fluorination. Stability studies of produgs of 2-fluoro-2-deoxyribose-1-phosphate and 2,2-difluoro-2-deoxyribose-1-phosphate in acidic and neutral conditions were conducted to confirm our observation. Biological evaluation of prodrugs of 2,2-difluoro-2-deoxyribose-1-phosphate for antiviral and cytotoxic activity is reported. Ó 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Glycosyl-1-phosphates are important compounds in many life processes. They are essential constituents of larger biomolecules and are key intermediates in the metabolism of sugars and their transformation into nucleosides. Among them, 2-deoxy-⇑ Corresponding author.
