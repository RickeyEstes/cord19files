This percentage is higher in children, particularly children under 5, due to the large proportion of cases caused by RSV. In adults, the contributions of identified viral etiologies were 8% for influenza viruses, 6% for rhinoviruses, 3% for coronaviruses, and 2% for RSV. In children under 5 with LRTIs, strong causal associations for RSV, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and metapneumovirus were found in comparison with healthy controls, and less so for adenoviruses, bocaviruses, and coronaviruses. 7,8
