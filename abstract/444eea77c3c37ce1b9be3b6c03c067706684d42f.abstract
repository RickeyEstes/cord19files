Most cases of rhinosinusitis are caused by viral upper respiratory tract infections. These infections lead to inflammation and edema causing obstruction of the sinus ostia and a decrease in mucociliary clearance of the sinuses. These effects create conditions that are favorable to bacterial growth. It is estimated that 0.5% to 2% of viral upper respiratory tract infections become secondarily infected with bacteria.3O Other causes of rhinosinusitis include anatomic deformities such as septa1 deviation or polyps, foreign bodies such as nasogastric tubes, allergy, and immunodefi~iency.3~~ 56 Direct injury to the upper teeth can form fistulas that can lead to anaerobic growth within the sinuses. It is estimated that 10% of maxillary sinusitis is associated with dental disease.21, 22 Microbiology The two most common bacterial causes of acute sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae. These bacteria account for 50% to 75% of organisms causing acute bacterial sinusitis.56 Moraxella catarrhalis, other streptococcal species, and anaerobes cause a smaller percentage of acute sinusitis.3o, 56 At least half of acute sinusitis is caused by viruses.32 Rhinovirus, parainfluenza, and influenza are the most common viral causes of acute sinusitis.% Fungal etiologies of acute and chronic sinusitis are also increasingly re~ognized.'~ The most common organisms isolated in chronic sinusitis are Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and anaerobes.52 Sixteen percent of chronic sinusitis is caused by multiple organisms.'2, 52 Other organisms found in chronic sinusitis include Streptococcus viridans, H. influenzae, and gram-nega tive organisms.12, 38 The diagnosis of sinusitis is usually based on clinical findings; however, other illnesses, such as allergic rhinitis, may present similarly. Common symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis include purulent nasal discharge, facial pain, congestion, cough, and fever. These symptoms are not specific to s i n~s i t i s .~~ The most specific symptom in sinusitis is maxillary toothache, but this symptom is limited to 11% of patients with In a study by Williams and Sime1,68 findings of purulent or Penicillin (PCN) and cephalosporins PCN V, 250-500 mg PO q6-8h PCN G, 0.5-0.2 mU IV q6h Amoxicillin, 500 mg PO tid Ampicillin, 0.5-0.2 g mg IV q6h Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) 500 mg PO tid or 875 PO bid Ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn), 1.5-3 g IV q6h
