Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is an important transcription factor that induces the expression of antiviral genes and viral genes. NF-κB activation needs the activation of NF-κB upstream molecules, which include receptors, adaptor proteins, NF-κB (IκB) kinases (IKKs), IκBα, and NF-κB dimer p50/p65. To survive, viruses have evolved the capacity to utilize various strategies that inhibit NF-κB activity, including targeting receptors, adaptor proteins, IKKs, IκBα, and p50/p65. To inhibit NF-κB activation, viruses encode several specific NF-κB inhibitors, including NS3/4, 3C and 3C-like proteases, viral deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), phosphodegron-like (PDL) motifs, viral protein phosphatase (PPase)-binding proteins, and small hydrophobic (SH) proteins. Finally, we briefly describe the immune evasion mechanism of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) by inhibiting NF-κB activity in productive and latent infections. This paper reviews a viral mechanism of immune evasion that involves the suppression of NF-κB activation to provide new insights into and references for the control and prevention of viral diseases. (MyD88), Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR)-containing adaptor-inducing IFNβ (TRIF), and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). The innate immune system is the first line of defense against foreign pathogens. NF-κB plays a major role in innate immune responses by inducing antiviral genes, such as interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). Additionally, NF-κB also promotes viral gene transcription that is harmful to some viruses' latency. Therefore, over the long course of evolution, viruses have developed multiple methods that interfere with NF-κB activity to promote viral survival. In this review, we focus on a viral immune evasion mechanism that functions by suppressing NF-κB activation, including targeting receptors, adaptor proteins, IKKs, IκBα, and p50/p65. Additionally, we describe several specific NF-κB inhibitors, including NS3/4, 3C and 3C-like proteases, viral deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), phosphodegron-like (PDL) motifs, viral protein phosphatase (PPase)-binding proteins, and small hydrophobic (SH) proteins. To better understand the role of NF-κB in viral immune escape, we use human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) as an example, and describe how inhibiting NF-κB activity promotes HIV-1 immune escape in different viral life cycles: productive infection and latent infection. We hope that this review can provide a reference for the prevention and control of viral diseases. Classical activation of NF-κB needs the activation of receptors, adaptor proteins, IKKs, IκBα, and p50/p65 (Figure 1 ). When cellular receptors sense external stimuli, they transmit signals to the IKKs via adaptor proteins, resulting in the phosphorylation of IKKs, degradation of IκBα, nuclear transfer of p50/p65, and activation of NF-κB.

When cellular receptors sense external stimuli, they transmit signals to the IKKs via adaptor proteins, resulting in the phosphorylation of IKKs, degradation of IκBα, nuclear transfer of p50/p65, and activation of NF-κB. Figure 1 . The activation of the NF-κB. The major upstream receptors of NF-κB-TLRs, RIG-I, TNFR, and IL-1R1-sense external stimuli and transmit signals to their adaptor proteins. TLRs transmit signals to MyD88 or TRIF, RIG-I to MAVS, TNFR1 to receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1), and IL-1R to MyD88. Then, MyD88 activates interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) and TNFRassociated factor 6 (TRAF6), MAVS interacts with TRAF6, and TRIF interacts with RIP1. TRAF6 and RIP1 both activate the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complex. The activated TAK1 complex then activates IKKs, resulting in the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα and the release of p50/p65. The released p50/p65 enters the nucleus, binds specific DNA sequences, and activates NF-κB transcriptional activity.
