T he etiologic association between an identifi ed respiratory virus (RV) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in a particular patient is not clear cut, making the use of the term "viral CAP" problematic. An RV can be the principal or only cause of CAP, but it also can simply represent a factor that predisposes the respiratory tract to superinfection by another pathogen that is the primary cause of the pneumonia. 1 In addition to these two possibilities, one should consider the possibility that the patient is an asymptomatic carrier of the RV without any relation to the CAP. Given these three possibilities, it is not surprising that no association has been found between the identification of an RV in adult patients with CAP and the clinical manifestations of the disease. [2] [3] [4] The involvement of RV in CAP has been recognized for many years, but over recent years, this phenomenon has gained increasing research interest. This interest is manifested in the increase in the number Background: Use of nucleic acid amplifi cation techniques has increased the identifi cation of respiratory viruses (RVs) in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The objectives of the present study were to identify RV in patients with CAP using three different sampling methods and to compare CAP virus proportions and types with two comparison groups. Results: At least one RV was identifi ed in 58 patients with CAP (31.7%) compared with 32 (7.1%) in control subjects and 104 (51.7%) in patients with NPLRTI ( P , .01 and P , .01, respectively). Coronaviruses were identifi ed in 24 (13.1%) patients with CAP, compared with 17 (3.8%) in control subjects, and 21 (10.4%) patients with NPLRTI. Respiratory syncytial virus was identifi ed in 13 (7.1%), four (0.9%), and seven (3.5%); rhinovirus in nine (4.9%), nine (2.0%), and 15 (7.5%); and infl uenza virus in eight (4.4%), two (0.4%), and 63 (31.3%) patients with CAP, control subjects, and patients with NPLRTI, respectively. Conclusions: The proportion of RV involvement in CAP is higher than previously reported. The proportion of RV identifi ed in healthy subjects is signifi cantly lower than in CAP, but it is not zero and should be weighed when interpreting corresponding proportions among patients.
