The emergence of intestinal organoids, as a stem cell-based self-renewable model system, has led to many studies on intestinal development and cell-cell signaling. However, potential issues regarding the phenotypic stability and reproducibility of the methodology during culture still needs to be addressed for different organoids. Here we investigated the transcriptomes of intestinal organoids derived from the same pig as well as batch-to-batch variation of organoids derived from different pigs over long-term passage. The set of genes expressed in organoids closely resembled that of the tissue of origin, including location specific functions, for at least 17 passages. Minor differences in gene expression were observed between individual organoid cultures. In contrast, most tissue-specific genes were not expressed in the transformed jejunum cell line IPECJ2, which also showed gene expression consistent with cancer phenotypes. We conclude that intestinal organoids provide a robust and stable model for translational research with clear advantages over transformed cells. Methods Jejunum tissue segments were obtained from control piglets used for another study, following guidelines of the animal ethics committee of Wageningen University. Two 5-week-old piglets were used for generating organoids following procedures previously described [11, 13] . Briefly, a 2 cm section of the mid-jejunum was dissected and placed in ice-cold PBS. After opening the sections longitudinally, jejunum segments were washed three times in ice-cold PBS and villi removed by carefully scraping with a scalpel. Small sections of the mucosa were cut from the muscle layer, divided into small cubes, and transferred into ice-cold PBS containing 30 mM EDTA and incubated with rotation at room temperature for 15 min. The PBS -EDTA was then replaced and incubation continued for 10 min at 37 °C. After washing in ice-cold DMEM supplemented with 5% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), the crypts were dissociated by rigorous vortexing and passed through a 100 µm strainer into cold DMEM containing 5% foetal bovine serum (FBS, v/v). Crypts were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min, and suspended in Matrigel (Basement Membrane, Growth factor reduced, REF 356231, Corning, Bedford, MA, USA). To improve surface tension, empty 24-well plates were pre-incubated overnight at 37 °C. Matrigel containing crypts was then plated at 7 domes per well (approx. 35 µl per well) and inverted to polymerize at 37 °C. After polymerization, 600 µl F12 cell culture medium (Gibco) was added, supplemented with 100 μg/ml primocin (Invivogen), 10 mM HEPES (HyClone), 1 × B-27 (Gibco), 1.25 mM N-acetylcysteine (Sigma), 50 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor (R&D systems), 15 nM gastrin, 10 mM nicotinamide, 10 μM p38 MAPK inhibitor (Sigma), 600 nM TGFβ receptor inhibitor A83-01, and conditioned media for recombinant Noggin (15% v/v), Spondin (15% v/v), and Wnt3A (30% v/v) provided by dr. Kuo and Hubrecht Institute (Utrecht, the Netherlands). Organoids were passaged at a 1:5 ratio every 5 days using ice-cold DMEM by mechanical dissociation, centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min, and plating in fresh Matrigel matrix droplets as previously described [11] . Directly after crypt isolation, organoid cultures were separated into three batches per animal and grown independently for 17 passages. Jejunum organoids were grown for 3 and 12 weeks (4-17 passages) and extracted using ice-cold PBS. After washing twice in PBS, intact organoids were pelleted at 300 x g for 5 min and suspended in RLT lysis buffer and stored at -80°C prior to RNA isolation. Porcine jejunum epithelial cell line IPEC-J2 (ACC-701) was grown in DMEM F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S, Gibco) in 75 cm 2 culture flasks. Data for one IPEC-J2 transcriptome was kindly provided by dr. Richard Crooijmans, via the Functional Annotation of ANimal Genomes (FAANG, BioSamples accession SAMEA4447551) [14] . For the analysis of the remaining two lines, IPEC-J2 at passage 87 and 91 were seeded at 5 x 10 4 cells/well in 24-well plates and grown to confluence within 48h with reduced P/S (1%). The monolayers were subsequently left to differentiate for 5 days, lysed using RLT-buffer, and stored at -80 °C prior to RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions including a 15 min on-column DNAse step. Preliminary tRNA concentrations, contamination and degradation were identified using Qubit (Thermo-Fisher) and gel-electrophoresis. The quantity and integrity of RNA was measured using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent).
