Background We investigated the potential of proteomic fi ngerprinting with mass spectrometric serum profi ling, coupled with pattern recognition methods, to identify biomarkers that could improve diagnosis of tuberculosis. Methods We obtained serum proteomic profi les from patients with active tuberculosis and controls by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation time of fl ight mass spectrometry. A supervised machine-learning approach based on the support vector machine (SVM) was used to obtain a classifi er that distinguished between the groups in two independent test sets. We used k-fold cross validation and random sampling of the SVM classifi er to assess the classifi er further. Relevant mass peaks were selected by correlational analysis and assessed with SVM. We tested the diagnostic potential of candidate biomarkers, identifi ed by peptide mass fi ngerprinting, by conventional immunoassays and SVM classifi ers trained on these data. were identifi ed and quantitated by immunoassay. Because these peptides refl ect infl ammatory states, we also quantitated neopterin and C reactive protein. Application of an SVM classifi er using combinations of these values gave diagnostic accuracies of up to 84% for tuberculosis. Validation on a second, prospectively collected testing set gave similar accuracies using the whole proteomic signature and the 20 selected peaks. Using combinations of the four biomarkers, we achieved diagnostic accuracies of up to 78%. Interpretation The potential biomarkers for tuberculosis that we identifi ed through proteomic fi ngerprinting and pattern recognition have a plausible biological connection with the disease and could be used to develop new diagnostic tests.
