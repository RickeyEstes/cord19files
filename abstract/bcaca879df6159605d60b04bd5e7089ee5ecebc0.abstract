Viruses manipulate cellular machinery and functions to subvert intracellular environment conducive for viral proliferation. They strategically alter functions of the multitasking mitochondria to influence energy production, metabolism, survival, and immune signaling. Mitochondria either occur as heterogeneous population of individual organelles or large interconnected tubular network. The mitochondrial network is highly susceptible to physiological and environmental insults, including viral infections, and is dynamically maintained by mitochondrial fission and fusion. Mitochondrial dynamics in tandem with mitochondria-selective autophagy 'mitophagy' coordinates mitochondrial quality control and homeostasis. Mitochondrial dynamics impacts cellular homeostasis, metabolism, and innate-immune signaling, and thus can be major determinant of the outcome of viral infections. Herein, we review how mitochondrial dynamics is affected during viral infections and how this complex interplay benefits the viral infectious process and associated diseases.

The impact of viral infection on mitochondrial functions has been described elsewhere [10,11]. Mitochondrial homeostasis is broadly maintained by the two closely interlinked and crucial processes, i.e. mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy [12] . Molecular and morphological analysis of mitochondrial network provides evidence that a single mitochondrion, in its life cycle, undergoes fission and fusion several times and when the cell's machinery senses any impaired mitochondria, they are eliminated by a process known as mitophagy [13] . A series of key events associated with this process is described in Fig. 1 . Although mitophagy is broadly considered to be a central route for the elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria, in many biological events mitophagy plays an active role in eliminating the fully functional mitochondria such as during starvation, fertilization and erythroid differentiation [14] [15] [16] . The fission, fusion and mitophagy are interlinked but distinct processes that together facilitate segregation of impaired mitochondria and subsequent delivery to the lysosomes for complete elimination [13] . Fission has been implicated in the sorting of the mitochondria with mutant mtDNA copies [17] . Unlike fission, the fusion is a route by which the mitochondria quickly exchange and equilibrate matrix metabolites, intact mtDNA copies, and mitochondrial
