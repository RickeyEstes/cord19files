Precise estimation of genetic substitution patterns is critical for accurate reconstruction of 18 pathogen phylogenies. Few studies of viral evolution account for variations of mutation rate 19 across a single gene. This is especially true when considering evolution of segmented viruses 20 where individual segments are short, encoding for few proteins. However, the structural and 21 functional partitions of these proteins could provide valuable information for more accurate 22 38 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
