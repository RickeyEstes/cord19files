Proteins fused to the elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) tag can be selectively separated from crude cell extract without chromatography. To avoid the interference of the ELP tag on properties of the target protein, it is necessary to remove the ELP tag from target protein by protease digestion. Therefore, an additional chromatographic purification step is required to remove the proteases, and this is time-and laborconsuming. Here we demonstrate the utility of the ELP-tagged proteases for cleavage of ELP fusion proteins, allowing one-step removal of the cleaved ELP tag and ELP-tagged proteases without chromatography.

For this purpose, a lot of protein purification methods have been explored. Among them, Meyer and Chilkoti reported a nonchromatographic method for purification of recombinant proteins using an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) 2 tag [1]. The ELP tag is an artificial biopolymer consisting of repeating pentapeptides, Val-Pro-Gly-Xaa-Gly (VPGXG), where Xaa can be any amino acid except Pro [2]. The ELP can undergo a reversible phase transition from soluble forms into aggregates by increasing the salt concentration or heating. The ELP aggregates can be recovered by centrifugation and resolubilized in buffer at a temperature below the transition temperature. Importantly, target proteins fused to the ELP tag still retain the phase transition behavior [1]. This characteristic transition allows the recombinant ELP fusion protein to be isolated from the cell lysate by repeated steps of aggregation, centrifugation, and resolubilization without chromatography. This nonchromatographic method for protein purification was termed as inverse transition cycling (ITC) [1, 3] . Recombinant ELP fusion proteins at different expression levels can be efficiently recovered by the ITC method [4, 5] . In addition to simple separation of recombinant proteins, ultra-high-level recombinant proteins can be produced by fusion with the ELP tag [6] . Due to the attractive advantages of the ELP tag, various proteins of interest have been expressed and purified using the ITC method [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . For crystal structural and biochemical characterization, however, it is necessary to remove the ELP tag from the target proteins. Cleavage of fusion proteins using proteases is feasible, but an additional purification step is needed to remove the proteases, and this is time-consuming. To solve this problem, self-cleaving ELP tags have been devised for purification of the tag-free recombinant proteins without using proteases [12, 13] . Here we report the application of ELP-tagged proteases for cleavage of the ELP fusion proteins to improve the ELP-tag-based nonchromatographic purification method. The principle using ELP-tagged proteases for the separation of tag-free target proteins is shown in Fig. 1 . The human rhinovirus 3C protease and small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) protease from yeast were used to demonstrate the proof-of-principle for this method. The human rhinovirus 3C protease is a specific protease that recognizes a peptide LEVLFQ/GP and cleaves between the Gln and Gly residues [14] . SUMO protease can recognize the tertiary structure of SUMO moiety instead of a peptide sequence and cleave in the diglycine motif at the junction between SUMO and the target proteins [15, 16] . Both proteases have been expressed and purified from Escherichia coli [16, 17] . An ELP gene encoding 90 repeating VPGXG was synthesized as described previously [1] and inserted into the plasmid pET23a (Novagen) to generate the vector pET23a-ELP under control of 0003-2697/$ -see front matter Ó
