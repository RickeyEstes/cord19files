Humans are colonized after birth by microbial organisms that form a heterogeneous community, collectively termed microbiota. The genomic pool of this macro-community is named microbiome. The gut microbiota is essential for the complete development of the immune system, representing a binary network in which the microbiota interact with the host providing important immune and physiologic function and conversely the bacteria protect themselves from host immune defense. Alterations in the balance of the gut microbiome due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors can now be associated with detrimental or protective effects in experimental autoimmune diseases. These gut microbiome alterations can unbalance the gastrointestinal immune responses and influence distal effector sites leading to CNS disease including both demyelination and affective disorders. The current range of risk factors for MS includes genetic makeup and environmental elements. Of interest to this review is the consistency between this range of MS risk factors and the gut microbiome. We postulate that the gut microbiome serves as the niche where different MS risk factors merge, thereby influencing the disease process. (J. Ochoa-Rep√°raz).

Environmental, genetics and microbial risk factors associated with CNS demyelinating disease Environmental, genetic, immunological and infectious diseases have been associated with MS [2]. The genetic background is thought to be a critical epidemiologic risk factor. As reviewed by Compton and colleagues, the familial recurrence rate in MS is 20% [7] . Monozygotic twins, sharing the 100% of the genetic information, have an MS lifetime risk of approximately 25-30%, siblings with two affected parents approximately a 20%, whereas dizygotic twins have a 5% lifetime risk, frequencies that suggest that the genetic background could interact with other risk factors. Alterations in immuno-regulatory or structural genes might increase the susceptibility to MS. Differences in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system-genes in the chromosome 6 that serve as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in humans-haplotypes DRBl*1501 and DQ6 have been suggested as genetic risk factors [8] . Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reveal an evident effect of these genetic risk factors, with particular importance of HLA class II region, but also class I [9,10]. Interestingly, the genetic factors associated with MS are involved in immunological processes [11] , providing strong theoretical support to the autoimmune nature of MS, and moreover, provides the potential framework that environmental factors may be intimately involved in the modulation and/or perhaps even the trigger for disease susceptibility.
