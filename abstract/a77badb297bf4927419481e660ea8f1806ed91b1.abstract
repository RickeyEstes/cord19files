mRNA pseudoknots have a stimulatory function in programmed À1 ribosomal frameshifting (À1 PRF). Though we previously presented a model for how mRNA pseudoknots might activate the mechanism for À1 PRF, it did not address the question of the role that they may play in positioning the mRNA relative to the ribosome in this process [E. P. Plant, (2003) RNA, 9, 168-174]. A separate 'torsional restraint' model suggests that mRNA pseudoknots act to increase the fraction of ribosomes directed to pause with the upstream heptameric slippery site positioned at the ribosome's A-and P-decoding sites [J. D. Dinman (1995) Yeast, 11, 1115-1127. Here, experiments using a series of 'pseudo-pseudoknots' having different degrees of rotational freedom were used to test this model. The results of this study support the mechanistic hypothesis that À1 ribosomal frameshifting is enhanced by torsional resistance of the mRNA pseudoknot.
