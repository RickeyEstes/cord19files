Annotations the influence on the carrier host of the reoviruslike agent is not yet' understood, the possibility of an infectious etiology of BN was further supported by the demonstration of virus-like particles in renal biopsy specimens of three further BN p~tients, as well as by the findings Of Apostolov and colleagues! Who lately described corona virus particles in the cytolJlasm of renal cells obtained by biopsy from patients with clinically confirmed BN (corona viruses have previously been named "reo-like," "reovirus-like," or "difficult viruses,', etc). Since no in vitro serologic procedure has been developed as a useful diagnostic tool in this disease, and the involved virus has not been Cultivated in tissue culture or laboratory hosts, little is known of the nature of this agent. Repetitio~ of such attempts and extension of the studies to embrace most of the modern techniques of virology are prerequisite to any progress in this field. Meanwhile, evidence of viral etiology in BN is still entirely morphological.
