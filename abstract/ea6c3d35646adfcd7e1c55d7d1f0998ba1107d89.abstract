Adenoviruses replicate primarily in the host cell nucleus, and it is well established that adenovirus infection affects the structure and function of host cell nucleoli in addition to coding for a number of nucleolar targeted viral proteins. Here we used unbiased proteomics methods, including high throughput mass spectrometry coupled with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and traditional two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, to identify quantitative changes in the protein composition of the nucleolus during adenovirus infection. Twodimensional gel analysis revealed changes in six proteins. Human adenoviruses comprise a non-enveloped icosahedral particle of 90 nm in diameter containing a linear doublestranded DNA genome of ϳ36 kbp. After virus attachment and entry to the host cell, the genome is delivered to the host cell nucleus, initiating a cascade of viral gene expression that results in viral DNA replication and accumulation of viral proteins that eventually form new infectious particles. During viral replication, host cell rRNA processing and export from the From the ‡Department
