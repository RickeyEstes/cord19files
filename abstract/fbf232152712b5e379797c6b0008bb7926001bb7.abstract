SM934 is an artemisinin analogue with immunosuppressive properties and potent therapeutic activity against lupus-like diseases in autoimmune mice. In this report, the therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanisms of SM934 on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was investigated using collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1J mice. We demonstrated that SM934 treatment alleviate the severity of arthritis in CIA mice with established manifestations. The therapeutic benefits were associated with ameliorated joint swelling and reduced extent of bone erosion and destruction. Bcl-6. Moreover, SM934 decreased the IL-21producing CD4 + T cells and dampened the IL-21 downstream signaling through STAT3. These finding offered the convincing evidence that artemisinin derivative might attenuate RA by simultaneously interfering with the generation of Tfh cells and Th17 cells as well as the subsequent antibody-mediated immune responses.
