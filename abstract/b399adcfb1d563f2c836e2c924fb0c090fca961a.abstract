► This birth cohort study has documented the influence of ARI on infant's pulmonary function test indices as indicated by significantly lower infant pulmonary function test (IPFT) indices for forced expiratory volume and flow rate, and higher indices reflecting airway resistance. ► Apart from respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus, human coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus infections were also significantly associated with impairment of IPFT indices. ► This is one of the first prospective birth cohort studies from Asia which has demonstrated objectively the association between ARI in infancy, irrespective of their aetiology, and impaired IPFT indices reflecting flow limitation and increased resistance at 3 years of age. Introduction Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in infancy may have a long-term impact on the developing respiratory system. We planned a prospective cohort study to determine the impact of ARI during infancy on the pulmonary function test indices at 3 years of age. Methods A cohort of normal, full-term newborns were followed up 6 monthly and during ARI episodes. Infant pulmonary function tests (IPFTs) were performed at baseline and each follow-up visit using tidal breathing flow-volume loop, rapid thoracoabdominal compression (RTC) and raised volume RTC manoeuvres. During each ARI episode, nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for respiratory pathogens by real-time PCR. Results We screened 3421 neonates; 310 were enrolled; IPFT was performed in 225 (boys: 125 (55.6%)) at 3 years. During infancy, 470 ARI episodes were documented in 173 infants. At 3 years, children with history of any ARI episode during infancy had lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1.0 ), forced expiratory volume in 0.75 s (FEV 0.75 ), forced expiratory volume in 0.5 s (FEV 0.5 ), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF 25-75 ), and maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC (MEF 25 ) as compared with those without any ARI episode during infancy. The ratio of tidal expiratory flow (TEF) at 25% or 50% of tidal expiratory volume to peak TEF (TEF 50 or TEF 25 /peak TEF) at 3 years was significantly increased in children who had ARI in infancy. Conclusions ARI during infancy is associated with impaired pulmonary function indices such as increased resistance and decreased forced expiratory flow and volume at 3 years of age.
