is essential to evaluate their evolutionary potential. Darwinian fitness, defined as the advantage of a given genotype with respect to a reference one, is a mesoscopic property that captures into a single figure differences in performance at every stage of viral infection. But to which extent viral fitness results from particular molecular interactions with host factors and regulatory networks during infection? Can we identify host genes, and then functional classes, whose expression depends on viral fitness? Here, we compared the transcriptomes of tobacco plants infected with seven genotypes of tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) that differ in fitness. We found that the larger the fitness differences among genotypes, the more dissimilar the transcriptomic profiles are. Consistently, two different mutations, one in the viral RNA polymerase and another in the viral suppressor of RNA silencing, that led to close fitness values, also resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles. Moreover, we identified host genes whose expression showed a significant correlation, positive or negative, with TEV fitness. Over-expression of genes with positive correlation activates hormone-and RNA silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense. By contrast, underexpression of genes negatively correlated reduces metabolism, growth, and development. Fitness is a complex parameter often used by evolutionary biologists and ecologists to quantitatively describe the reproductive ability and evolutionary potential of an organism into a particular environment 1,2 . Despite this apparently simple definition, measuring fitness is difficult and most studies only measure one or more fitness components (e.g., survival to maturity, fecundity, number of mates, or number of offspring produced) as proxies to total fitness 1,2 . In the field of virology, it has become standard to measure fitness by growth-competition experiments in mixed infections with a reference strain 3,4 . With this experimental set up, fitness is just the relative ability of a viral strain to produce stable infectious progeny in a given host (cell type, organ, individual, or species) when the available resources have to be shared with a competitor 5 . Regardless its limitations, at least, this approach provides a metric for ranking viral strains according to their performance in a particular environment/host. Such a fitness measure has been pivotal for quantitatively understanding many virus evolution processes: the effect of genetic bottlenecks and accumulation of deleterious mutations in RNA virus populations 6-8 , the rates and dynamics of adaptive evolution into novel hosts 9, , the pleiotropic cost of host range expansion 10-12 , the cost of genome complexity 13,14 , the cost of antiviral escape mutations 15-17 , the topography of adaptive fitness landscapes 18-20 , and the role of robustness in virus evolution 21-23 . But differences in viral fitness should also matter in genome wide studies seeking to understand the mode of action of the viruses (i.e., the precise way they interact with their hosts). Even though it has been argued that an integrative systems biology approach to viral pathogenesis would result in a better understanding of pathogenesis and in the identification of common targets for different viruses, therefore serving as a guide to a more rational design of therapeutic drugs 24-30 , pioneering studies have ignored the high genetic variability of viruses and subsequent differences in fitness and in mode of action. Experimental evidences support that even single nucleotide substitutions have significant effects on viral fitness, regardless they are synonymous or nonsynonymous, or they affect coding or non-coding genomic regions 31-37 . A common trend among all these studies is that, whenever fitness is evaluated in the standard host, the distribution of mutational effects is highly skewed towards deleterious effects, with a large fraction of mutations being lethal. Furthermore, increasing evidences suggest that the shape and location of the distribution of fitness effects depends on the host species, being the difference among two hosts (e.g., a tested host and the natural one) greater as their genetic divergence increases 12, 20, 38, 39 . Together, all these observations suggest that the fitness of a given viral genotype depends not only on its own genetic background, but also on the host where fitness is evaluated. Arguably, differences in viral fitness reflect differences in the virus-host interaction, with respect to a reference strain. As the cellular parasites they are, viruses need to kidnap all sort of cellular factors and resources, reprogram gene expression patterns into their own benefit, and block and interfere with cellular defenses. And all these processes take place embedded into the host complex network of intertwined interactions and regulations. Interacting in suboptimal ways with .
