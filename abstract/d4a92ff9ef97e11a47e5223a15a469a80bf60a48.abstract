In recent years a variety of issues have emerged concerning the epidemiology of zoonotic protozoan infections that result from the ingestion of environmentally resistant infective stages. They have many features in common regarding their transmission, which can be direct, or via water or food, and most exhibit low host specificity. Although they have been the subject of research for many years, recent studies have raised fundamental questions concerning our understanding of the epidemiology of infections with these parasites. Giardia and Blastocystis both have wide host ranges and are genetically very divergent yet how this variability is reflected in terms of zoonotic potential, clinical significance and virulence is not clear. With Cryptosporidium, many taxonomic and epidemiological questions have been resolved but recent studies have not only questioned Cryptosporidium's phylogenetic affinities, but have also revealed new aspects about its life cycle and development. These findings will have a major impact on both surveillance and control. In the case of Toxoplasma, recent studies in domestic animals and wildlife have raised questions about how the parasite is maintained in nature. In particular, the role of vertical transmission in wildlife populations may have been underestimated. In the case of Blastocystis, Entamoeba coli, Chilomastix and Dientamoeba, they have been largely overlooked in terms of their impact on public health yet their common, and sometimes concurrent occurrence, has raised questions about their clinical and zoonotic potential. These emerging issues will be discussed with emphasis on how molecular tools and epidemiological studies can help resolve these questions.
