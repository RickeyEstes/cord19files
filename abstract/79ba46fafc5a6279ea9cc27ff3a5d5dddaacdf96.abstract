The Chinese University of Hong Kong Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused Hong Kong, China by infection with the SARS coronavirus (SCV) [10-12]. 5 München, Germany SCV was rapidly sequenced following its identification [13, 14], leading to the recognition of a number of possible drug targets. Although treatment with ribavirin and corticosteroids has been shown to have a slight posi-Summary tive effect [15], side-effects [16] and lack of activity of ribavirin in cell culture [17] highlight the need for more Bananins are a class of antiviral compounds with a effective treatments. Most recent anti-SCV drug develunique structural signature incorporating a trioxaopment has targeted the viral main protease, also adamantane moiety covalently bound to a pyridoxal called the 3CL protease, and following an initial crystal derivative. Six members of this class of compounds: structure [18], a structure together with inhibitors was bananin, iodobananin, vanillinbananin, ansabananin, solved [19]. Other classes of boronic-acid-based proteeubananin, and adeninobananin were synthesized and ase inhibitors have also been identified [20], and largetested as inhibitors of the SARS Coronavirus (SCV) scale screens have identified SCV inhibitors effective helicase. Bananin, iodobananin, vanillinbananin, and against the protease [21]. We and collaborators have eubananin were effective inhibitors of the ATPase acalso recently identified inhibitors of the SCV helicase, tivity of the SCV helicase with IC 50 values in the range the protease and spike-mediated viral entry by a chem-0.5-3 M. A similar trend, though at slightly higher ical genetics approach [22]. In this paper we focus inhibitor concentrations, was observed for inhibition specifically on the SCV NTPase/helicase. Drugs targetof the helicase activities, using a FRET-based fluoresing viral helicases have had marked success in animal cent assay. In a cell culture system of SCV, bananin models of herpes simplex virus [23, 24], and there has exhibited an EC 50 of less than 10 M and a CC 50 of been progress in targeting the hepatatis C virus heliover 300 M. Kinetics of inhibition are consistent with case [25]. We have previously cloned, purified, and perbananin inhibiting an intracellular process or proformed an initial biochemical characterization of the cesses involved in SCV replication.

It has also been shown recently that the SCV helicase possesses Adamantanes, formally designated tricyclo[3.3.1.1] an RNA 5#-triphosphatase activity that may be involved decanes, are structurally unusual compounds where in capping viral RNA [28]. four cyclohexane rings are fused to each other in a par-The SCV helicase consists of three major domainsticularly strain-free, all chair conformation. Oligo-oxaa putative N-terminal metal binding domain (MBD), a adamantanes contain oxygens in place of methylene hinge domain, and an NTPase/helicase domain. It is linkages within the structure and play a variety of roles clear from previous work on another member of the Niin nature; from the infamous neurotoxin from the puffer dovirales order, equine arterivirus (EAV), that the metal fish tora fugu, tetrodotoxin (TTX) (Figure 1) [1], to plant binding domain is essential to viral viability [29, 30]natural product steroids such as daigremontianin [2]. this is also likely to be the case for closely related SCV. Not all adamantane derivatives are extremely toxic, and In this paper, we investigate the effects of the bananin many synthetic derivatives such as amantadine are series of compounds on both the ATPase and helicase used clinically (Figure 1) [3]. Amantadine is used as an activities of the SCV helicase, and also test bananin antiviral agent [3], and as a muscle relaxant in the treatagainst SCV in cell culture. We find that bananin and three of its derivatives are potent inhibitors of both the ATPase and helicase activities of the SCV helicase, and *Correspondence: andreas.kesel@t-online.de (A.J.K.); jdhuang@hkucc. that bananin inhibits SCV replication at a concentration hku.hk (J.-D.H.) 6 These authors contributed equally to this work. significantly below that at which it is toxic to the cell. 24, 36, or 48 hr mayer, E.M., Paulshock, M., Watts, J.C., Wood, T.R., Hermann, E.C., and Hoffmann, C.E.
