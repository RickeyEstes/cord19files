Graphical Abstract Highlights d The Collaborative Cross models the phenotypic diversity observed in human immunity d QTL mapping in the CC reveals candidate genes linked to T cell phenotypes In Brief Graham et al. advance the use of the Collaborative Cross (CC), a panel of reproducible recombinant inbred mouse strains, for immunology research. They demonstrate that the CC better models the phenotypic diversity in human T cell immunity and use quantitative trait locus mapping to reveal candidate genes linked to T cell phenotypes.
