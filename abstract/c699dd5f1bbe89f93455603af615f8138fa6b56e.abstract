Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has emerged as a clinically important neurotropic virus that can cause acute flaccid paralysis and encephalitis, leading to cardiopulmonary failure and death. Recurring outbreaks of EV71 have been reported in several countries. The current lack of approved anti-EV71 therapy has prompted intense research into antiviral development. Several strategies -ranging from target-based chemical design to compound library screenings -have been employed, while others revisited compound series generated from antiviral developments against poliovirus and human rhinoviruses. These efforts have given rise to a diversity of antiviral candidates that include small molecules and nonconventional nucleic-acid-based strategies. This review aims to highlight candidates with potential for further clinical development based on their putative modes of action. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is described as one of the human enterovirus A species under the genus Enterovirus in the Picornaviridae family of viruses, which includes poliovirus [1] . While efforts to eradicate poliovirus through vaccination programs have limited the number of polio-endemic countries to just four (Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan) [2], EV71 has emerged as an important non-polio neurotropic enterovirus. EV71 was first isolated from patients with central nervous system diseases in California between 1969 and 1974 [3]. The same authors also described the EV71 prototype strain, BrCr, isolated from a twomonth-old patient who presented with aseptic meningitis. Since then, EV71 outbreaks have been reported in several countries beyond North America, including Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia and Singapore [4]. These outbreaks have mainly involved young children, with most cases displaying mild, self-limiting hand, foot and mouth disease; however, EV71 outbreaks have also been associated with a variety of severe neurological complications that can deteriorate rapidly to involve cardiopulmonary failure with high mortality rates. Transmission of EV71 can occur rapidly via the fecal-oral and droplet and/or aerosol routes. During the largest EV71 outbreak to date, in Taiwan in 1998, more than 100,000 children were affected, with 405 severe cases involving neurological or cardiopulmonary complications, of which 78 were fatal [5] .
