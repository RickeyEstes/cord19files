emerged in late 2019 1,2 . Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8% cases with severe-, and 6.1% with critical courses 3 . This severe presentation corresponds to the usage of a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung 2,4 . By causing an early onset of severe symptoms, this same receptor tropism is thought to have determined pathogenicity but also aided the control of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 5 . However, there are reports of COVID-19 cases with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, suggesting a potential for pre-or oligosymptomatic transmission 6-8 . There is an urgent need for information on body site -specific virus replication, immunity, and infectivity. Here we provide a detailed virological analysis of nine All rights reserved.
