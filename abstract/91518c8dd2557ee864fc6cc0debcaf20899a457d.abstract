was performed with RdRpSeq-Fwd (similar to the first round) and RdRpSeq-Rnest primer by using MyFi ™ Mix Kit (Bioline, USA) according to the following parameters: 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 15 seconds, 56 °C for 15 seconds, 72 °C for 20 seconds, and 2 min at 72 °C for terminal elongation[5]. The resulted amplicons were separated by gel electrophoresis, and the DNA fragments were excised, purified and subjected to sequencing in both directions. The obtained sequences were verified by basic local alignment search tool. As for the amplification of complete N gene region, cDNA was synthesized by using SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen, USA) with NR2 primer (Table 1). Two microliters of the generated cDNA was subjected to one round of PCR cycle by using MyFi ™ Mix Kit (Bioline, USA) with NF1 and NR2 (Table 1) primers following the parameters: 95 °C for 1 min followed by 25 cycles at 95 °C for 15 seconds, 52 °C for 15 seconds and 72 °C for 30 seconds and terminal elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. Then, 0.5 μL of the resulted PCR amplicon was further subjected to the second round PCR following the abovementioned parameters. The resulted PCR product was separated by gel electrophoresis while the DNA fragment was excised, purified and subjected to sequencing by using NF1, NR1, NF2, NR2 and N350R primers. The obtained sequences were analyzed by using ChromasPro version 1.7.4 (Technelysium Pty Ltd, Australia). Multiple sequence alignment was performed by using Clustal X (version 2.0.11) with 44 human-derived (including the Malaysian case; MyH010414; GenBank accession No: KP769415) and 3 camel-derived MERS-CoV sequences[6]. Maximum likelihood analysis was conducted by using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis 6.06[7]. The evolutionary history was computed by using Tamura-Nei model with 1 000 replicates of bootstrap analysis. Extracted RNA from combination of throat and nasal swabs from the case was detected positive both in rRT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR for partial RdRp and N gene. The cycle threshold values for upE, ORF1a and ORF1b were 28.19, 29.16 and 33.36, respectively. Amplification of partial RdRp and N gene regions resulted in DNA fragment of ~240 bp and ~310 bp, respectively (data not shown). Initial sequencing result of these fragments showed highly identical nucleotide sequence (99%) to MERS-CoV strain Jeddah_1_2013 (KJ556336.1), further confirming the MERS-CoV infection.
