Faecal samples from I 12 dogs both with and without diarrhoea were screened for parvovirus by a haemagglutination titration test and then examined by electron microscopy for the presence of viruses and virus-like particles. On the basis of morphology eight distinct viruses or virus-like particles were identified. Particles identified were coronaviruses, coronavirus-like particles, rotavirus-like particles, papovavirus-like particles, torovirus-like particles, picomavirus-like particles, 27 nm virus-like particles with projections and parvovirus-like particles which did not cause haemagglutination.
