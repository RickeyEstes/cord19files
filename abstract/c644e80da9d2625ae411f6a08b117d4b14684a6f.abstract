The oligomerization state of the reovirus cell attachment protein al (49K monomeric molecular weight) ormined by biochemical and biophysical means . Full-length (protein product designated A) and C-Miminaltruncated (protein product designated 8) serotype 3 reovirus St mRNA transcripts synth zed in vitro were In a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and the products were analyzed by sodium dodecyl su fate-polyecrytamide'get sis (SDS-PAGE) under conditions which allowed for the identification of oligomeric forms of at . A total of four aligomeric protein bands (corresponding to Aa , A2B" A,B2 , and B a , respectively) was consistently observed, which suggests that the protein is made up of three monomeric subunits . Biophysical charactedza!Ion of purified a1 using column filtration and sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis confirmed the highly asymmetric s atpe of al and allowed us to determine the molecular weight of the native protein to be^-132K (a trimed . Similarblophililploslasellysiss o n the two trypdo fragments of the at [N-terminal fibrous tail (26K monomeric molecular weight) and the C-terminal globular head (fit monomeric molecular weight)] yielded molecular weights of 77K and 64K, both again corresponding to framers . We therefore conclude that protein a1 is a homotrimer and provide, with soppONI M +aplerfmental evidence, a rationale for the anomalous behavior of the okgomertc protein in SDS-polyaary8Slde9SL which, coupled with chemicalcross4inking studies, has in part led to the previous suggestion that at might be a higher order oligomer . n
