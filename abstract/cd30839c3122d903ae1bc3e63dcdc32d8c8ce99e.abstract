Like asthma itself, the association between respiratory infections and the inflammatory immune response is complex and incompletely understood. One can clearly see the effects of infections on wheezing, asthma inception, and exacerbations, but dissecting out the mechanistic details is the challenge confronting research in this decade. As always, it is hoped that a more complete understanding of the cells, cytokines, and signaling pathways involved, along with knowledge of the temporal progression of events and the role of regulatory factors such as microRNAs, will lead to more effective treatments, individualized to the patient. Asthma afflicts more than 300 million individuals of all ages and ethnic groups, and results in approximately 250,000 deaths worldwide. More than 7 million children younger than 18 years have been diagnosed with asthma in the United States alone. 1 In 2003, asthma-related hospitalizations neared 500,000 in the United States and the annual direct medical expenses associated with asthma care were $12.7 to $15.6 billion. 2,3 According to a cross-sectional international study conducted from 2002 to
