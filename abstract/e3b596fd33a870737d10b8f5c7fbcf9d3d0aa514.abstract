This year, the Editorial Board has given much attention to convergence. By systematically combining diverse fields of study, efforts have been made to overcome the limitations of existing interpretations. The convergent status of rehabilitation exercises and the need to overcome medical and societal problems through convergence, which was emphasized during the MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreak, were introduced. Now, in the last issue of the year, we reconsider the concept of penile rehabilitation, which has until now been recognized as safe. We suggest an urgent need to conduct high-quality prospective studies with regard to the biochemical recurrence of cancer, specifically with regard to the mechanism by which phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5I) may affect the course of prostate cancer when taken after radical prostatectomy. Drugs like Viagra and Cialis work by deactivating the enzyme PDE5-a chemical that takes away an erection after sex by limiting blood supply. However, scientists now think that malignant melanoma is fueled by a faulty gene (a family of serine-threonine protein kinases, BRAF) which suppresses the enzyme PDE5, suggesting that PDE5 plays an important role in preventing the spread of cancer cells, including prostate cancer cells. It is feared that Viagra, and drugs like it, could be mimicking the effect of the mutated BRAF gene. The early administration of PDE5I after radical prostatectomy is helpful in the patient's fast recovery of erectile function, and it is often used clinically as a means of penile rehabilitation. However, according to one recent retrospective analysis of patients who received bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, it was suggested that taking PDE5I might be associated with the biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer (Loeb et al., 2015; Michl et al., 2015) . Hence, the relationship between PDE5I medication and the biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer needs to be reviewed, based on reports of the impact of PDE5I on prostate can-
