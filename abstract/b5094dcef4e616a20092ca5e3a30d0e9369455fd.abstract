Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is found to cause a large outbreak started from Wuhan since December 2019 in China and SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported with epidemiological linkage to China in 25 countries until now. We isolated SARS-CoV-2 from the oropharyngeal sample obtained from the patient with the first laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Korea. Cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the Vero cell cultures were confluent 3 days after the first blind passage of the sample. Coronavirus was confirmed with spherical particle having a fringe reminiscent of crown on transmission electron microscopy. Phylogenetic analyses of whole genome sequences showed that it clustered with other SARS-CoV-2 reported from Wuhan. Coronaviruses (CoVs), within the order Nidovirales, are enveloped, single-strand, positivesense RNA viruses with a large genome of approximately 30 kbp in length. CoV was cultured for the first time in human embryonic tracheal organ cultures by Tyrrell and Bynoe in 1965, 1 and it was named as 'corona' due to crown-like appearance of the surface projections on electron microscopy. All CoVs develop only in the cytoplasm of infected cells, bud into cytoplasmic vesicles, and then extrude in virus particles of 70-80 nm in diameter by exocytic secretory pathway. Among four genera of CoVs, beta-CoV includes five subgenus-embevovirus, sarbecovirus including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, merbecovirus including Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, nobecovirus, and hibecovirus. Because CoVs can infect a variety of animals, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV crossed the species barriers. Since December 2019, 2019 novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) has been making a large outbreak involving 49,053 laboratory-confirmed patients and 1,383 mortality in 25 countries including J Korean Med Sci. 2020 Feb 24;35(7):e84 https://doi.
