The definition of mitigation includes a wide variety of measures taken before an event occurs that will prevent illness, injury, and death and limit the loss of property. Taking steps to mitigate potential hazards has taken on increasing favor in disaster preparedness circles, particularly in the international arena, where the pursuit of disaster risk reduction (DRR) and disaster risk management (DRM) is emphasized above efforts focused simply on disaster event response. The absolutely stunning loss of life, illnesses, injury, psychological impact, displacement from home and community, and social and financial consequences of a disaster, coupled with its disproportionate impact on the already disadvantaged, makes it imperative to fully implement the best principles and practices of disaster mitigation. 1 These principles and practices fall into two types: 1. Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) aims to reduce the damage caused by natural hazards like earthquakes, floods, droughts, and cyclones, through the ethic of prevention. 2 2. Disaster Risk Management (DRM) includes management activities that address and seek to correct or reduce disaster risks that are already present. 3 The Hyogo Framework for Action 4 offers guiding principles, priorities for action, and practical means to achieve disaster resilience for vulnerable communities. Priorities for action include the following: 1. Ensure that DRR is a national and local priority with a strong institutional basis for implementation 2. Identify, assess, and monitor disaster risks and enhance early warning 3. Use knowledge, innovation, and education to build a culture of safety and resilience at all levels 4. Reduce the underlying risk factors 5. Strengthen disaster preparedness for effective response at all levels Although the primary emphasis on the Hyogo Framework is natural disasters, the processes discussed and framework for community resiliency and partnerships have application to all types of hazard responses. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reinforces the importance of engaging "not only FEMA and its federal partners, but also local, tribal, state and territorial partners; non-governmental faith-based and nonprofit organizations, and private sector industry; to individuals, families and communities, who continue to be the nation's most important assets as first responders during a disaster." Engaging local communities and a diverse set of partners ensures that the "unique and diverse needs of a population" are met and helps communities become more resilient after a disaster. 5
