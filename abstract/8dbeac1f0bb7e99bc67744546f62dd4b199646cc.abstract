Real time detection of acute (IP)cocaine-enhanced dopamine and serotonin release in ventrolateral nucleus accumbens of the behaving Norway rat. PHARMA-COL BIOCHEM BEHAV 46(3) 715-722, 1993.-Cocaine (10 mg/kg), administered intraperitoneal (IP), was studied for its effects on dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) release in ventrolateral nucleus accumbens (vlNAcc) of conscious and behaving male, virus-free, Sprague-Dawley rats with in vivo electrochemistry (voltammetry). Miniature stearate probes detected DA and 5-HT release, on line and within a temporal resolution of seconds. Psychostimulant behaviors, in the form
