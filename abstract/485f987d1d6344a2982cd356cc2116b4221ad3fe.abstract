Tubuloreticular inclusions (TRIs) are subcellular structures located within the cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum. Formation of TRIs has been linked to the exposure of excess interferon (IFN), either from endogenous or exogenous sources. In renal disease, TRIs have been most commonly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Case reports of patients with renal biopsies showing TRIs without underlying SLE or HIV are infrequent in adults, and to our knowledge none have been reported in children. We report 3 pediatric cases in which the renal biopsy showed TRIs on electron microscopy without underlying SLE or HIV infection. The first patient presented at 2 years of age with nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. His renal biopsy revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and TRIs. The second patient presented at 6 months of age with infantile nephrotic syndrome, and his renal biopsy revealed membranous Case Rep Nephrol Dial 2017;7:91-101
