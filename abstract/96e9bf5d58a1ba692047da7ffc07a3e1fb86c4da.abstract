A recombinant SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein vaccine produced in insect cells in a pre-clinical development stage is described. A truncated version of S glycoprotein, containing only the ecto-domain, as well as a His-tagged full-length version were cloned and expressed in a serum-free insect cell line, ExpresSF+ ® . The proteins, purified to apparent homogeneity by liquid column chromatography, were formulated without adjuvant at 3, 9, 27, and 50 g per dose in phosphate saline and used to immunize mice. Both antigens in each formulation elicited a strong immune response after two or three vaccinations with the antigen. Neutralizing antibody titers correlated closely with standard ELISA reactivity against the S glycoprotein. The truncated S protein was also formulated with an adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide, at 1 g per dose (±adjuvant), and 5 g per dose (±adjuvant). Significantly enhanced immune responses, manifested by higher titers of serum ELISA and viral neutralizing antibodies, were achieved in adjuvanted groups with fewer doses and lower concentration of S glycoprotein. These findings indicate that the ecto-domain of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein vaccine, with or without adjuvant, is immunogenic and induces high titers of virus neutralizing antibodies to levels similar to those achieved with the full S glycoprotein vaccine. The development of SARS-CoV vaccines has become a priority for preparedness for future outbreaks to protect health care workers managing new cases as well as the general population. A Phase I clinical trial using killed-whole SARS-CoV vaccine has been conducted by Sinovac Biotech Ltd. However, concerns have been raised for the use of inactivated virus vaccines based on observations with feline coronavirus. There are also several subunit vaccines in pre-clinical development, targeting SARS-CoV structural proteins, including the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Other vaccine candidates include vector-based DNA vaccines [7-11], a combination of whole killed virus and DNA vaccines [12], inactivated whole virus vaccines [13, 14] , a combination of DNA and S-peptide vaccines [15] , and other recombinant proteins and their fragments. 0264-410X/$ -see front matter
