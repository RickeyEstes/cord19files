Several important viruses including the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the SARSassociated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) employ programmed À1 ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) for their protein expression. Here, a kinetic framework is developed to describe À1 PRF. The model reveals three kinetic pathways to À1 PRF that yield two possible frameshift products: those incorporating zero frame encoded A-site tRNAs in the recoding site, and products incorporating À1 frame encoded A-site tRNAs. Using known kinetic rate constants, the individual contributions of different steps of the translation elongation cycle to À1 PRF and the ratio between two types of frameshift products were evaluated. A dual fluorescence reporter was employed in Escherichia coli to empirically test the model. Additionally, the study applied a novel mass spectrometry approach to quantify the ratios of the two frameshift products. A more detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying À1 PRF may provide insight into developing antiviral therapeutics.
