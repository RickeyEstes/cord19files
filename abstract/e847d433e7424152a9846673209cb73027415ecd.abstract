Martinez-Martinez (Santander, ES) Objectives: To evaluate the reliability of the MicroScan WalkAway 96 system (W/A) for determining susceptibility testing of gram-negative bacteria isolated from clinical samples to quinolones, including organisms totally resistant or with low level resistance. Methods: We evaluated 278 clinical isolates (1 per patient) with different phenotypes of resistance to quinolones, including 108 E. coli, 43 P. mirabilis, 19 K. pneumoniae, 15 M. morganii, 11 C. freundii, 20 other enterobacteria, 47 P. aeruginosa, 11 A. baumannii and 4 other non fermenters. Enterobacteria were selected for including consecutive isolates with the following phenotypes (CLSI definitions): Group 1 (54 E. coli and 52 non-E. coli): susceptible to nalidixic acid (NAL) and to ciprofloxacin (CIP); Group 2 (26 E. coli and 34 non-E. coli): NAL-resistant (R), and with MIC of CIP ranging 0.5-2 mg/l; Group 3: (28 E. coli and 22 non-E. coli): NAL-R and CIP-R. W/A testing was done with Combo Urine 1S panels, containing NAL (4, 16 mg/l), CIP (0.12, 0.5, 1, 2 mg/l), norfloxacin (NOR: 8, 16 mg/l) and ofloxacin (OFL: 2, 4 mg/l). The reference method was microdilution (MD, CLSI; 128-0.06 mg/l for NAL, 32-0.015 mg/l for others). Results of W/A and MD were compared by calculating agreement in clinical categories, number of minor, major (ME, false resistance) and very major errors (VME, false susceptibility), and essential agreement (that in ±1 dilution, considering no disagreement when both MICs by W/A and MD were under or over the limit 2006 Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 12, Supplement 4 concentrations in W/A panels). NAL was evaluated only for enterobacteria. Results: Agreements in clinical categories and essential agreements were: 98.2% and 97.8% (NAL), 93.5% and 92.8% (CIP), 97.5% and 99.6% (NOR) and 95.3% and 99.0% (OFL). For the 1050 organism-quinolone combinations there were 3 (0.3%) VME: 1 each for CIP, NOR and OFL, all in P. aeruginosa; 6 (0.6%) ME: 2 for NAL (1 E. coli, 1 P. mirabilis), 2 for CIP (1 P. mirabilis, 1. S. maltophilia) and 2 for OFL (2 S. marcescens); and 31 (2.9%) minor errors: 15 for CIP (7 P. mirabilis, 2 P. aeruginosa, 2 S. marcescens, 4 others), 6 for NOR (2 P. aeruginosa, 2 S. marcescens, 2 others) and 10 for OFL (4 P. mirabilis, 3 M. morganii, 3 others). Conclusions: The W/A system can be reliably used for testing gram-negative bacteria to quinolones, including isolates resistant or with decreased susceptibility to these antimicrobial agents. False resistance to amikacin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa with the MicroScan WalkAway 96 system F. Unda, J. Calvo, M. Armengol, L. Martínez-Martínez (Santander, ES) Objectives: To determine the reliability of susceptibility testing results of P. aeruginosa strains reported as resistant to amikacin (AMK) with the MicroScan WalkAway 96 system (W/A). Methods: We evaluated 131 consecutive non duplicated P. aeruginosa strains isolated during February 2004-January 2005, resistant to AMK according to the W/A system. Identification and susceptibility testing was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Two type of panels with the following concentrations (mg/L) of aminoglycosides were used: Negative Combo 1S panel [gentamicin (GEN): 4 and 8; tobramycin (TOB): 4 and 8, AMK: 8 and 16] and Urine Combo 1S panel (GEN 4 and 8; TOB 4 and 8; AMK 16 and 32). The results were compared with those obtained by reference microdilution (CLSI guidelines). MICs were also obtained with Etest. For comparisons, MICs by Etest within two values of the 2-log dilution scale were rounded up to the next higher dilution. Percentages of agreements in clinical categories were calculated. Disagreements were defined as very major errors (VME: resistant by microdilution and susceptible by W/A or Etest), major errors (ME: susceptible by microdiluiton and resistant by W/A or Etest) and minor errors (mE: intermediate by one method and susceptible or resistant by the other one). Agreements of MICs by Etest within one and within two dilution steps of those obtained by microdilution were also calculated. Results: Percentages of agreement in clinical categories between W/A and microdilution for GEN, TOB and AMK were 81.7%, 92.4% and 3.0%, while for Etest and microdilution the corresponding values were 97.7%, 100% and 99.2%. No VME were obtained with W/A, but ME were observed for 18/131 (13.7%), 9/131 (6.9%) and 120/131 (91.6%) of the strains. mE with W/A were obtained in 6/131 (4.58%), 1/131 (0.7%) and 7/ 131 (5.3%) of the strains. Only mE were obtained with the Etest: 3/131 (2.3%) for GEN and 1/131 (0.7%) for AMK. Agreement within one and within two dilution step of MICs by Etest and by microdilution were 91.6% and 98.4% (AMK), 81.6% and 94.6% (TOB) and 87.0% and 97.7% (GEN). Conclusions: In his study, the W/A system was not reliable for susceptibility testing of P. aeruginosa to AMK, as most strains reported as AMK-resistant actually were susceptible to this antibiotic. To a lesser extent, major errors were also noted for GEN and TOB. On the other hand the Etest agreed very well with reference microdilution for all three aminoglycosides. Objectives: To evaluate the Vitek-2 (V2) system (bioMérieux, France) using AST-N020 or AST-N041 cards for susceptibility Abstracts 2006 Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 12, Supplement 4 ISSN: 1470-9465 testing and recognition of phenotypes of resistance of clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (Eco) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kpn) resistant to beta-lactams. AST-N041 contains specific test for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) detection. Methods: We tested 136 organisms: 44 Eco and 20 Kpn producing TEM, SHV or CTX-M ESBL, 39 Eco hyperproducing chromosomal AmpC (HAmpC), 11 Kpn ESBL(+) and lacking porins [POR (-)] and 22 Kpn with plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase (pACBL). MICs were determined by microdilution (MD, CLSI guidelines); resistance mechanisms were studied by beta-lactamase characterization (isoelectric focusing and gene sequencing) and SDS-PAGE of outer membrane proteins. MICs of amoxicillin-CLV (AMC), piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ), cefoxitin (FOX), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ) and cefepime (FEP) determined with N020 and N041 cards were compared between them and with the reference MD. Presumed phenotypes of resistance by the V2 advanced expert system (AES), and suggested changes in clinical categories were also compared for both cards. Results: For the 136 strains, MICs of AMC, PTZ, and FOX with each card were within one dilution step for 135 strains; MICs of CTX, CAZ, and FEP with N020 were ‡2 dilutions higher than with N041 for 7, 2 and 0 strains, while the reverse was noted for 8, 6 and 3 strains. MICs of FEP with N020 and N041 were ‡2 dilutions lower than with reference MD for 28/64 ESBL organisms, and for 10/33 Kpn POR (-) or pACBL (+), but agreed for all Eco HAmpC. Phenotypes suggested by the AES with N020 card agreed with reference results for 59/64 ESBL (+) strains, 9/11 ESBL (+)/POR(-) and 19/22 pACBL. With N041 these values were 61/64, 11/11 and 17/22, respectively. For 31/ 39 Eco HAmpC the AES with N020 suggested several phenotypes, including an ESBL, reporting them as resistant to CTX, CAZ and FEP; the N041 card correctly discarded the presence of an ESBL in all 39 strains. Conclusions: Differences in MICs of CTX, CAZ and FEP obtained with AST-N020 and AST-N041 cards for organisms ESBL(+) or pACBL(+) were noted in comparison with reference results, but this usually did not translate into changes in clinical categories after AES suggestions. The AES shows excellent agreement with underlying mechanisms of resistance with card N041, but with N020 it suggests false presence of ESBLin most Eco HAmpC. Objective: Unusual species of Enterobacteriaceae can cause clinical infections in humans on rare occasions. However, there have been few studies evaluating the accuracy of susceptibility testing methods for these organisms. The objective of this study was to determine whether disk diffusion (DD) and Vitek 2 gave accurate susceptibility test results for these unusual isolates when compared to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution (BMD) reference method. Methods: Sixty-one isolates representing 15 genera and 25 different species including Buttiauxella, Cedecea, Ewingella, Kluyvera, Leminorella, Rahnella, and Yokenella from the strain collection of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were tested by the DD and BMD reference methods using Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar and cation-adjusted MH broth at 35C for 18-20 h. Antimicrobial agents included aminoglycosides, carbapenems, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, penicillins, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. CLSI interpretative criteria for Enterobacteriaceae were used. Identification and susceptibility of the isolates were also tested by Vitek 2 as described by the manufacturer; identification results were compared to conventional biochemical tests. Results: Of the 12 drugs tested by BMD and DD, 10 showed >95% categorical agreement (CA). CA was lower for ampicillin (80.3%) and cefazolin (77%). There were three very major errors (all with cefazolin, one resolved on repeat testing), one major error (also with cefazolin), and 22 minor errors. Thirty-four of 40 isolates (covering 12 species) that were in the Vitek 2 database were identified correctly to species level, 1 was correct to genus level, and five were reported as unidentified. Vitek 2 generated MIC results for 41 (67.2%) of 61 isolates but categorical interpretations (S, I, R) were provided only for 24. For the 17 drugs tested by both BMD and Vitek 2, essential agreement (41 isolates) ranged from 80.5-100% and CA (24 isolates) ranged from 66.7% (ampicillin) to 100%; twelve drugs exhibited 100% CA. Conclusions: DD, which is often the backup method for laboratories with automated systems, provided accurate susceptibility test results for these unusual organisms. The Vitek 2 identified 85% of a subset of isolates correctly, but only provided MIC interpretations for 58.5%. Thus, DD provides a reliable alternative to BMD for testing unusual Enterobacteriaceae, some of which cannot be tested with automated methods. H. Rodriguez-Villalobos, J. Smet, C. Nonhoff, S. Crevecoeur, R. De Mendonça, M. Struelens (Brussels, BE) Objective: VITEK 2 (BioMerieux) has developed novel gramnegative susceptibility cards (AST-045 and AST-046) to improve the accuracy of ESBL detection among E. coli and Klebsiella spp. These cards contain a specific ESBL test combining cefotaxime, cefepime and ceftazidime alone and with clavulanate. We evaluated these cards and Advanced Expert System (AES) ability to detect ESBL mediated resistance in a well characterized collection of ESBL-producing E. coli and Klebsiella spp clinical isolates. Methods: A total of 100 E. coli strains (83 ESBL and 16 AmpC producing E. coli) and 26 Klebsiella spp isolates (26 ESBL strains) were included. The presence of ESBL was confirmed by double disc synergy test and combined disc with three substrates and PCR for bla TEM, bla SHV and bla CTX-M genes. ESBL were characterized by isoelectric-focusing and/or DNA sequencing. ESBL strains included E. coli harbouring CTX-M group 1 enzymes in 50%, CTX-M group 2 in 11%, TEM enzymes in 13% and SHV enzymes in 6%. All ESBL producing Klebsiella spp harboured CTX-M enzymes in combination with TEM or SHV beta-lactamases. Organisms were subcultured twice on bloodsheep agar before loading the AS045 and AS046 cards according to the manufacturer recommendations. Results: No discordances were observed between the two cards. The mean time to obtain results was 7.5 h (range 5.75-9.25). Overall agreement for enzyme detection was 97 %. ESBL VITEK 2 test was positive in all ESBL-producing strains. Sensitivity and specificity were: E. coli, 99% and 100% respectively, K. pneumoniae 100% for both and K. oxytoca 71% and 100% respectively. Disagreements concerned mainly CTX-M producing K. oxytoca in which the ESBL positive card test was systematically interpreted by AES as high-level penicillinase production. In 33% of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae AES inferred the expression of impermeability mechanism in addition to ESBL production. Conclusion: These new AST VITEK 2 cards showed accurate and rapid detection of ESBL-producing E. coli and K.pneumoniae, including strains harbouring CTX-M enzymes. The lower sensitivity of AES to detect CTX-M producing K. oxytoca indicates the difficulty to detect this emerging phenotype in this organism. Objective: VITEK 2 AST-045 and AST-046 cards (BioMerieux) for Gram-negative susceptibility testing include a specific ESBL detection test combining cefotaxime, cefepime and ceftazidime alone and with clavulanate. Because this test has been validated by the manufacturer only for E. coli and Klebsiella spp , the result is reported only for these species. We determined the ability of VITEK 2 and Advanced Expert System (AES) to detect ESBL mediated resistance in Enterobacter clinical isolates using these cards. Methods: A total of 76 Enterobacter isolates : 63 ESBL producing strains (32 E. aerogenes and 31 E. cloacae) and 13 non ESBL producing strains (7 E. aerogenes and 6 E. cloacae) were inoculated into the VITEK 2 AST-045 and AST-046 cards according to the manufacturer recommendations. Production of ESBL was confirmed by double disc synergy test (with ceftazidime, cefotaxime and cefepime), combined disc method (Oxoid) and PCR for bla TEM, bla SHV and bla CTX-M genes. E. cloacae harboured SHV12 in combination with CTX-M9 in 94%. E. aerogenes ESBLs included: TEM enzymes in 59%, SHV in 9% or other combinations of enzymes in 32%. Results were graded as ''agreement'' when AES inferred ESBL mechanism, ''partial agreement'' when AES suggested several mechanisms including ESBL and ''disagreement'' when AES concluded to different mechanism(s). Results: Results are summarized in the table.Overall sensitivity was 92% (91% for E. aerogenes and 94% for E. cloacae) and specificity 23.1% (14.3% for E. aerogenes and 33.3% for E. cloacae). The mean time to obtain results was 8.2 h (range 6.25-11). Conclusion: This study shows that VITEK2 AES provides a rapid and sensitive tool to detect possible ESBL production in Enterobacter spp by using AST-045 or AST-046 cards but confirmatory analysis is frequently necessary. More efficient automated methods should be developed to distinguish ESBL production from AmpC hyperproduction in this genus. Enterobacteriaceae is an absolute must as antimicrobial therapy is guided by the susceptibility results of the organism. In the present study we evaluated the VITEK 2 ESBL test, consisting of indicator antibiotics with and without clavulanic acid, on a set of ESBL-positive clinical isolates. Methods: Eighty E. coli and 85 K. pneumoniae strains were obtained at the Dr Soetomo Hospital in Surabaya, Indonesia. Strains originated mainly from urine (n = 104) and blood specimens (n = 18). All isolates were ESBL-positive by the Abstracts 2006 Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 12, Supplement 4 ISSN: 1470-9465 double disc test method and by ESBL combination discs (Oxoid). Of all isolates, b-lactamase enzymes were isolated for Iso-electric point determination. Strains were tested in the VITEK 2 AST-N041 panel containing cefepime, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime alone and in combination with clavulanic acid. Results: The VITEK 2 ESBL test confirmed 72 of the E. coli (90%) and 73 of the K. pneumoniae (86%) as ESBL positive. For two E. coli strains VITEK 2 gave an indeterminate result. The six E. coli ESBL-negative strains consisted out of isolates containing TEM-like enzymes (n = 4), TEM + chromosomal beta-lactamase (n = 1) and SHV + chromosomal beta-lactamase (n = 1). TEMtype beta-lactamases (n = 72) were most prevalent in E. coli ESBL-positive isolates. The 12 K. pneumoniae ESBL-negative isolates consisted out of isolates containing no plasmid encoded beta-lactamases (n = 6), SHV-like enzymes (n = 3), TEM-like enzymes (n = 2), CTX-M + SHV-like (n = 1). In the ESBLpositive isolates (n = 73) CTX-M like enzymes were demonstrable in 33 isolates. Conclusions: The ESBL VITEK 2"R" test gives rapid and conclusive results. However, the discrepant results have to be resolved in order to give the ''true'' accuracy of the VITEK 2 ESBL test.
