Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) proteins belong to a large group of proteins that is diYcult to express in traditional expression systems. The ability to express and purify SARS-CoV proteins in large quantities is critical for basic research and for development of pharmaceutical agents. The work reported here demonstrates: (1) fusion of SUMO (small ubiquitinrelated modiWer), a 100 amino acid polypeptide, to the N-termini of SARS-CoV proteins dramatically enhances expression in Escherichia coli cells and (2) 6£ His-tagged SUMO-fusions facilitate rapid puriWcation of the viral proteins on a large scale. We have exploited the natural chaperoning properties of SUMO to develop an expression system suitable for proteins that cannot be expressed by traditional methodologies. A unique feature of the system is the SUMO tag, which enhances expression, facilitates puri-Wcation, and can be eYciently cleaved by a SUMO-speciWc protease to generate native protein with a desired N-terminus. We have puriWed various SARS-CoV proteins under either native or denaturing conditions. These puriWed proteins have been used to generate highly speciWc polyclonal antibodies. Our study suggests that the SUMO-fusion technology will be useful for enhancing expression and puriWcation of the viral proteins for structural and functional studies as well as for therapeutic uses. 
