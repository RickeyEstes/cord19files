The spike protein 'of avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus comprises two glycopolypeptides Sl and S2 derived by cleavage of a proglycopolypeptide So. the nucleotide sequence of which has recently been determined for the Beaudette strain (Binns, M.M. et al., 1985, J. Gen. Virol. 66, 719-726). The order of the two glycopolypeptides within So is aminoterminus(Sl-S2-carboxyterminus(C). To locate the N-terminus of S2 we have performed partial amino acid sequencing on S2 from IBV-Beaudette labelled with ['Hlserine and from the related strain IBV-M41 labelled with [3H]valine, leucine and isoleucine. The residues identified and their positions relative to the N-terminus of S2 were: serine. 13; valine, 6, 12; leucine. none in the first 20 residues: isoleucine, 2, 19. These results identified the N-terminus of S2 of IBV-Beaudette as serine. 520 residues from the N-terminus of Sl. excluding the signal sequence. Immediately to the N-terminal side of residue 520 So has the sequence Arg-Arg-Phe-Arg-Arg; similar basic connecting peptides are a feature of several other virus spike glycoproteins. It was deduced that for IBV-Beaudette Sl comprises 519 residues (M, 57.OK) or 514 residues (56.2K) if the connecting peptide was to be removed by carboxypeptidase-like activity in vivo while S2 has 625 residues (69.2K). Nucleotide sequencing of the cleavage region of the So gene of IBV-M41 revealed the same connecting peptide as IBV-Beaudette and that the first 20 N-terminal residues of S2 of IBV-M41 were identical to those of the Beaudette strain. IBV-Beaudette grown in Vero cells had some uncleaved So; this was cleavable by 10 pg/ml of trypsin and of chymotrypsin.
