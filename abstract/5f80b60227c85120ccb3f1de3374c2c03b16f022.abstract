Type I interferons (IFN-a and -b) play an important role in the innate host defense against viral infection by inducing antiviral responses. In addition to direct antiviral activities, type I IFN serves as an important link between the innate and adaptive immune response through multiple mechanisms. Therefore, the outcome of a viral infection can be affected by IFN induction and the IFN sensitivity of a virus. North American porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) field isolates were studied with regard to IFN-a sensitivity and induction in order to understand the role of type I IFN in PRRSV pathogenesis. PRRSV isolates were differentially sensitive to porcine recombinant IFN-a (rIFN-a) and varied in their ability to induce IFN-a in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) cultures as measured by a porcine IFN-a specific ELISA on cell culture supernatants. Fifty-two plaques were purified from three PRRSV isolates (numbers 3, 7, and 12) and tested for IFN sensitivity and IFN induction. Plaque-derived populations were composed of heterogeneous populations in terms of IFN-inducing capacity and sensitivity to rIFN-a. When macrophages infected with isolates 3, 7, or 12 were treated with polycytidylic acid (polyI:C), IFN-a production was enhanced. Cells infected with isolate 3 and treated with polyI:C showed the most consistent and strongest enhancement of IFN-a production. It was demonstrated that the relatively low concentrations of IFN-a produced by isolate 3 contributed to the enhanced IFN-a synthesis in response to polyI:C. Isolates 7 and 12 significantly suppressed the enhanced IFN-a production by isolate 3 in polyI:C treated cells. To determine if suppression was at the level of IFN-a transcription, quantitative RT-PCR was performed for IFN-a mRNA and compared to GAPDH and cyclophilin mRNA quantification. However, the relative number of IFN-a transcript copies did not correlate with IFN-a protein levels, suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism of suppression. In summary, these results demonstrate that PRRSV field isolates differ both in IFN-a sensitivity and induction. Furthermore, a PRRSV field isolate strongly enhance polyI:C-induced IFN-a production in PAM cultures and this priming effect was suppressed by other PRRSV isolates. #
