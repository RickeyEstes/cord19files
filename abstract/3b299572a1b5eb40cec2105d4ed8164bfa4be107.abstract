The experimental approach to toxicity testing was de fined in 1955 with the appearance in the Food Drug Cosmetic Law Journal of contributions by the combined staff of the Divisions of Pharmacology and Food of the Food and Drug Administration of the USA outlining procedures for the ap praisal of the toxicity of food additives, drugs and other chemicals (13). Since these precepts were first laid down, there have been only minor modifications to basic study de signs. Such studies assume that there are appropriate animal models, and that a dose-response relationship can be estab lished defining at the lower end the "no detectable toxic effect" level and at the upper end target-organ systems. These studies are required in rodent and non-rodent species, for it is argued that a multiple-species approach will pro vide the greatest likelihood of accurate qualitative and quantitative predictions. Animal studies pose two major problems: the first problem is that of species differences; the second concerns differences in the conditions under which compounds are ad ministered. The species differences present insurmountable difficulties; the matter is worse confounded when one appre ciates the major differences existing between breeds and strains, and often these differences extend to variations between substrains. The conditions under which experiments are conducted cannot be standardized: environmental stress factors vary from laboratory to laboratory, practices of animal management differ and it is difficult, if not impos sible, to repeat precisely any toxicological study. The health status of the animals is one of the many factors that can introduce variations in toxicology studies, thus affect ing the accuracy and reproducibility of the measurements.
