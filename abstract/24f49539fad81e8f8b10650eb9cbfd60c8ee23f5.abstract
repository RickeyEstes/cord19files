replicase. We identified that the STMV CP-HV replicase interaction requires a positively charged residue at the third position (3R) in the N-terminal 13 amino acid (aa) motif. Far-Northwestern blotting showed that STMV CP promotes binding between HV-replicase and STMV RNA. An STMV CP variant having an arginine to alanine substitution at position 3 in the N-terminal 13aa motif abolished replicase-CP binding. The N-terminal 13aa motif of the CP bearing alanine substitutions for positively charged residues located at positions 5, 7, 10 and 11 are defective in packaging full-length STMV, but can package a truncated STMV RNA lacking the 3′ terminal 150 nt region. These findings provide insights into the mechanism underlying the regulation of STMV replication and packaging. Satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) was originally found in association with its helper virus (HV) Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV strain U5) in natural infections of tree tobacco (Nicotiana glauca) 1 . The replication of STMV depends on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) encoded by TMV U5, which has since been renamed Tobacco mild green mosaic virus. Other strains of TMV such as U1 and U2 also have been shown to support the replication of STMV 1 . The genome of STMV is composed of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of 1059 nucleotides (nt) 2,3 . STMV RNA does not show appreciable sequence homology with helper TMV RNA, except for the 3′ -terminal 150 nt that exhibit 65% homology with the corresponding tRNA-like structure (TLS) located at the 3′ end of TMV RNA 2 . Biologically active icosahedral virions of STMV are 17-18 nm in diameter with a T = 1 symmetry 4 and are assembled from 60 identical capsid protein (CP) subunits of 17.5 kDa 2 . The 3D structure of STMV has been determined at 1.8 Å 5 . A hallmark feature of STMV is that it is the only satellite virus, whose HV is a rod-shaped tobamovirus. Additionally, STMV stands out among other spherical viruses because of the high degree of order adopted by the RNA within the capsid 6 . Despite its simple genome organization, information concerning STMV replication is limited 7,8 . Previous studies 7 revealed that a mutation engineered to completely block CP synthesis severely reduced the replication of STMV while a variant designed to express only the N-terminal 13 amino acid (aa) motif retained wild type replication via an unknown mechanism.
