The design and evaluation of a novel decahydroisoquinolin scaffold as an inhibitor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ) are described. Focusing on hydrophobic interactions at the S 2 site, the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold was designed by connecting the P 2 site cyclohexyl group of the substrate-based inhibitor to the main-chain at the a-nitrogen atom of the P 2 position via a methylene linker. Starting from a cyclohexene enantiomer obtained by salt resolution, transdecahydroisoquinolin derivatives were synthesized. All decahydroisoquinolin inhibitors synthesized showed moderate but clear inhibitory activities for SARS 3CL pro , which confirmed the fused ring structure of the decahydroisoquinolin functions as a novel scaffold for SARS 3CL pro inhibitor. X-ray crystallographic analyses of the SARS 3CL pro in a complex with the decahydroisoquinolin inhibitor revealed the expected interactions at the S 1 and S 2 sites, as well as additional interactions at the N-substituent of the inhibitor.
