from camels in Amibara District in the Afar region of Ethiopia. Swabs were placed in virus transport medium and kept in ice packs until transported to the laboratory where they were stored at −80°C. The frozen swab samples were shipped on dry ice to the University of Hong Kong for virus detection, sequencing, and virus culture. Of the 4,204 swabs collected, 173 specimens were positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR: 25 of the 451 from Burkina Faso, 75 of the 723 from Ethiopia, 3 of the 381 from Morocco, and 70 of the 2,649 from Nigeria. Detection and Genetic Analysis. Total nucleic acid was extracted from swab samples using the easyMAG (bioMerieux) system and was tested for the presence of MERS-CoV RNA upstream of the envelope gene (UpE) by an RT-qPCR hydrolysis probe assay. All positive specimens were confirmed by a second RT-qPCR assay targeting the ORF1a region of the genome (3). Representative swab specimens with high MERS-CoV viral load (low CT values) were selected for full-genome sequencing. In addition, a specimen with high viral load from a study of MERS-CoV in Nigeria from which partial virus genome sequences were previously reported (1) was also selected for full-genome sequencing. Multiple reversetranscription reactions with gene-specific primers targeting different regions of the genome were used to generate MERS-CoV cDNA and were amplified using multiple PCRs with primers designed to produce overlapping DNA fragments covering the complete virus genome. These PCR products were sequenced directly using Sangersequencing methods. Specific overlapping RT-PCR reactions were set up to amplify a 1,554-bp fragment covering the gene region ORF3, ORF4a, and ORF4b, and these genes were sequenced from additional MERS-CoV-positive swab samples from which full-genome sequences were not obtainable because of lower viral loads. The primers used were 5′-GAGGAATACGACCTCGAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTGGA-GAATGGCTCCTCTTC-3′ (reverse) for ORF3 to ORF4a and 5′-ACAAAAGCTTTGGCCAAACAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGC-TAAAGCAGCTACATAGC-3′ (reverse) for ORF4a to ORF4b. The full and partial genome sequences were aligned using Geneious V8.0.5 (https://www.geneious.com/). The MERS-CoV full genomes were phylogenetically analyzed using PhyML and BEAST.
