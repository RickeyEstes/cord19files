Enterovirus G (EV-G) belongs to the family of Picornaviridae. Two types of recombinant porcine 36 EV-Gs carrying papain-like cysteine protease (PLCP) gene of porcine torovirus, a virus in 37 Coronaviridae, are reported. Type 1 recombinant EV-Gs are detected in pig feces in Japan, USA, 38 and Belgium and carry the PLPC gene at the junction site of 2C/3A genes, while PLPC gene 39 replaces the viral structural genes in type 2 recombinant EV-G detected in pig feces in a Chinese 40 farm. We identified a novel type 2 recombinant EV-G carrying the PLCP gene with flanking 41 sequences in place of the viral structural genes in pig feces in Japan. The ~0.3 kb-long upstream 42 flanking sequence had no sequence homology with any proteins deposited in GenBank, while the 43 downstream ~0.9 kb-long flanking sequence included a domain having high amino acid sequence 44 homology with a baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat superfamily. The pig feces, where the 45 novel type 2 recombinant EV-G was detected, also carried type 1 recombinant EV-G. Although the 46 phylogenetic analysis suggested that these two recombinant EV-Gs have independently evolved, 47 type 1 recombinant EV-G might have served as a helper virus by providing viral structural proteins 48 for dissemination of the type 2 recombinant EV-G. 49 50
