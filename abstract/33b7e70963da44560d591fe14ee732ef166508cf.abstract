The mammary glands represent one part of the mrrcosal immune system, a definable, subunit of humoral and cellular immune functions in man that appears to have developed particular qualities well suited to guard our inteflace with the environment. As our und~standing of secretory immunoglobulins and lymphocyte migration patterns continues to deveiop, the immunologic components found in breast milk appear increasingly hkely to play a spect& immunologic role in the protection of the nursing infant. The biologic basis for the observed protective effect of breast-feeding is reviewed with an emphasis on the mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of mucosal immunity in general.
