Charley, B., Laverne, S. and Lavenant, L., 1990. Recombinant porcine interferon-gamma activates in vitro porcine adherent mononuclear cells to produce interleukin 1. Vet. Immunol. Irnmunopathol., The effect of recombinant porcine interferon-gamma (rPoIFNT) on in vitro production of interleukin 1 (IL-1) by porcine blood monocytes was studied. Three-day-old cultures of porcine adherent blood mononuclear cells were treated by doses of rPoIFN7 for 3 or 6 days befi~re lipupolysaccharide (LPS)-induction. While rPoIFN7 alone had no effect, a combined treatment by rPolFN7 and LPS enhanced the IL-1 secretory potential of adherent mononuclear ceils and, to a lesser extent, the level of cell-associated IL-1. The IL-1 activity was neutralized by anti porcine IL-lo~ and/? antisera. These results demonstrate that rPoIFN7 has immunomodulatory effects in vitro on porcine monokine production.
