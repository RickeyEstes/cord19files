A review h i g h l i g h t s g r a p h i c a l a b s t r a c t Principles, configurations and fluorescence techniques using fiber optic and planar waveguide biosensors are discussed. The biorecognition elements and sensing schemes used in fiber optic and planar waveguide platforms are reviewed. Some major and recent applications of fiber optic and planar waveguide biosensors are introduced. The application of optical biosensors, specifically those that use optical fibers and planar waveguides, has escalated throughout the years in many fields, including environmental analysis, food safety and clinical diagnosis. Fluorescence is, without doubt, the most popular transducer signal used in these devices because of its higher selectivity and sensitivity, but most of all due to its wide versatility. This paper focuses on the working principles and configurations of fluorescence-based fiber optic and planar waveguide biosensors and will review biological recognition elements, sensing schemes, as well as some major and recent applications, published in the last ten years. The main goal is to provide the reader a general overview of a field that requires the joint collaboration of researchers of many different areas, including chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, and material science.
