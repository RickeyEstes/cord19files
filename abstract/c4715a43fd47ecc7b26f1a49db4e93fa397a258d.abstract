Introduction: C9orf72 intronic GGGGCC hexanucleotide expansion has been recognized as the most common genetic alteration associated with familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Approximately 1% to 7% of patients with Huntington disease (HD) phenotype do not carry the CAG expansion within the HTT gene. Additionally, there might be phenotypic overlap between ALS, FTLD and HD, since these are neurodegenerative diseases that may clinically present with motor symptoms associated with variable levels of cognitive impairment. Recent studies have demonstrated C9orf72 expansion as the most common identified genetic alteration in patients with HD-like phenotype and negative HD genetic testing, with a prevalence of approximately 2% to 5% based on European studies. In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of the C9orf72 expansion in individuals with negative testing for HTT gene CAG expansion in a North American tertiary referral laboratory. Methods: De-identified DNA samples (n=236) that previously tested negative for CAG expansion of the HTT gene were evaluated by genotyping PCR. C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat region was amplified using fluorescentlylabeled primers flanking the hexanucleotide repeat region and fragments were visualized by capillary electrophoresis. Allele size was determined using GeneScan 500 ROX dye size standard and GeneMarker software. Follow-up Southern blot analysis using XBaI and HindIII restriction enzymes separately and a 32 P-labeled oligonucleotide probe to specifically detect a region immediately upstream of the hexanucleotide repeat region was performed for apparently homozygous samples and those with intermediate (20 to 29 repeats) alleles. Results: Of the 236 cases, 3 (1.3%) tested positive for a C9orf72 expansion. Two cases had >2000 repeats, a repeat expansion range typically seen in our positive ALS/FTD samples. A single case had approximately 80 to 100 repeats. Of the remaining 233 cases, 1 (0.4%) had an intermediate allele (22 repeats) and 232 (98.3%) had <20 repeats, with 2 and 5 repeats as the most common and the second most common alleles, respectively. Conclusions: C9orf72 expansion was identified in a small subset of patients with negative HD genetic testing in a North American tertiary referral laboratory. This finding suggests that C9orf72 expansion is a genetic alteration that may be identified in patients in which HD is a clinical differential diagnosis prompting genetic testing, and supports consideration of C9orf72 expansion evaluation for individuals with HD-like phenotype and negative HTT gene expansion testing. Introduction: Clinical next generation sequencing (NGS) is rapidly becoming an established diagnostic tool. Because positive test results can influence significant medical decisions, many labs rule out false positive calls by confirming variants with an orthogonal method such as Sanger sequencing. The collective experience of many laboratories doing so is that the great majority of NGS positives indeed confirm, and therefore the need to broadly apply orthogonal confirmation has been questioned. However, identifying the highest confidence NGS calls and quantifying our degree of confidence in these calls can be challenging. A cross-laboratory framework to rigorously address this challenge has not yet been established but has clear value to the medical community. Methods: We report a framework that can apply across different assay targets, NGS protocols, bioinformatics algorithms, and QC criteria. In brief, our framework involves: 1) assembling confirmation data from each laboratory across clinical and reference samples, 2) determining the QC characteristics of subsets of variants that each data set adequately describes, and 3) using proper statistical metrics to both establish reliable filtering thresholds and to quantify the performance of variants that meet these thresholds. We propose the use of multiple threshold tiers: a strict tier, over which the likelihood of a false positive is exceedingly low, and a lower tier established to ensure sensitivity. Reported variants from the lower tier would need orthogonal confirmation whereas confirmation of the higher tier variants may depend on clinical factors (e.g. actionability or population prevalence) and/or operational criteria (e.g. positive sample tracking). Results: To date, we have applied this framework to data from 4 different laboratories. For example in one data set for a 184 gene NGS panel, 3082 variants were assembled as a complete and representative set of NGS calls that a) met that lab's top tier QC criteria (eg, read depth and other factors), and b) had high-quality orthogonal data available. All 3082 were confirmed as true positives. Further bioinformatic analysis identified a subset of 2394 with homogeneous properties in terms of genomic context, variant types and local sequence properties. The observed analytic false discovery rate (FDR) for the 2394 remains 0.0% and our statistical estimate is that these data demonstrate an FDR of at most ~0.1% for such variant calls (at p=0.05). Conclusions: Our framework is the first effort to combine data across clinical NGS labs to help evaluate the value of orthogonal confirmation and determine the appropriate burden of proof to potentially change practice in distinct cases. We believe these results and this framework can contribute to the ongoing community dialog on this subject. Introduction: Identification of mutations in the mitochondrial genome is critical to confirm multiple mitochondrial disorders. A next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay, using an orthogonal confirmation approach, was validated to sequence the entire mitochondrial genome. This assay detects single nucleotide variants (SNVs), up to 38 bp insertions, up to 44 bp deletions, and large deletions greater than approximately 500 bp. Methods: The mitochondrial genome was amplified in two overlapping products by long-range PCR. PCR products were quantified and mixed equimolar. NGS was then performed using two orthogonal methods: 1) TruSeq Nano library preparation sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq (primary) and 2) Ion Plus Fragment library preparation sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM (Life Technologies) (confirmatory). Large deletions detected by the MiSeq were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Haplogroup classification was performed using Phylotree and HaploGrep software. To demonstrate accuracy, we tested 127 DNA samples (extracted from whole blood, blood spots, cultured cells, and muscle biopsy) previously genotyped using established methods. Precision was assessed using eight samples run in triplicate both on the same run and across three separate runs. Limit of detection (LOD) studies were performed to assess: 1) minimum input of DNA for long-range PCR, 2) minimum long-range PCR product input for library preparation, 3) minimum detectable variant frequency, and 4) 95% confidence of detection of variant frequencies. Results: Previously identified variants were detected for 126 out of 127 samples during validation. After excluding the discordant sample due to a sample mix-up, results were 100% concordant. 100% of variants detected by the MiSeq and within the LOD were orthogonally confirmed by the Ion Torrent PGM. Of the large deletions detected by the MiSeq, 100% were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The samples run for the precision study were in fact mixtures of samples, so as to create a range of variant frequencies (100% down to <1%). All results were 100% concordant among replicates down to the LOD. The LOD was determined to be 1.875 ng input of DNA for long-range PCR (standard protocol: 30 ng) and 25 ng input PCR product for library preparation (standard protocol: 100 ng). The minimum detectable variant frequency was determined to be 6% for SNVs and insertions/deletions, and 20% for large deletions. The lower 95% confidence levels were calculated for three different variant frequencies: 16.8% to 24.8% for 20% variants, 8.1% to 12.1% for 10% variants, and 4.2% to 6.6% for 5% variants. Conclusions: We have demonstrated validity of an NGS assay for sequencing and haplogroup classification of the complete mitochondrial genome. Introduction: Several in silico tools have been shown to have reasonable predictive value in classifying sequence variants in coding regions, but no method has been shown to perform this function in non-coding regions. Combined annotation dependent depletion (CADD) generates predictive scores for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) all areas of the genome, including non-coding regions. It has been shown that CADD compares well with other tools for nonsynonymous variants, but no one has explored whether this method can be used to effectively stratify variants in non-coding regions. Methods: We evaluated all unique SNVs with CADD scores for 624 patient samples submitted for germline mutation testing in a cancer risk gene panel. entries in the 1000 genomes database. We used the Wilcoxin Rank Sum test to compare distribution of CADD scores of rare SNVs to that of common SNVs in our patient population and that of all possible SNVs defined by Kircher et al, stratifying by genomic region (eg, downstream, intergenic, etc.). We visually compared distributions that were found to be significantly different to determine if rare SNVs were appropriately overrepresented at high CADD scores. Results: We identified 783,387 total variants with CADD scores in the 624 samples. 12,391 variants were unique, and 8929 of these were rare. The median CADD scores of intronic and nonsynonymous variants were significantly different between rare and common SNVs (p<0.0001). On visual inspection, rare variants were overrepresented at higher CADD scores for these two regions. Rare downstream, intergenic, intronic, upstream and 5' UTR rare variants were underrepresented at the lowest CADD scores and overrepresented at the highest CADD scores compared to all possible variants (p<0.0001 for difference in median). A similar pattern was seen between common and all possible SNVs for intergenic and upstream regions (p<0.0001 for difference in median). When the rare SNVs with the highest CADD scores were evaluated, we found only one definitively pathogenic variant, which was a nonsynonymous SNV in a coding region. On further evaluation, other variants with disproportionately high CADD scores were deemed unlikely to be disease causing in the context of patients' cancer phenotypes. Conclusions: We found that the median CADD scores of rare SNVs are significantly 754 AMP Abstracts jmd.amjpathol.org ■ The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics higher for intronic and nonsynonymous regions compared to common variants in our patient population. However, the rare intronic SNVs with the highest CADD scores were unlikely to be disease causing in our patients. Thus, we determine that CADD scores are not useful for identifying pathogenic mutations in non-coding regions in clinical cancer risk samples.
