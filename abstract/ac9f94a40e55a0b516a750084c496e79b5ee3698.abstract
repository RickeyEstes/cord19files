a b s t r a c t 5-Arylcarbamoyl-2-methylisoxazolidin-3-yl-3-phosphonates have been synthesised from N-methyl-Cdiethoxyphosphorylnitrone and N-arylacrylamides in good yields. cis-and trans-isoxazolidine phosphonates obtained herein were evaluated for activity against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses. None of the compounds were endowed with antiviral activity at subtoxic concentrations. Isoxazolidines having phenyl substituted with halogen (Ar = 2-F-C 6 H 4 ; 3-Br-C 6 H 4 ; and 4-Br-C 6 H 4 ) have been found to inhibit proliferation of L1210, CEM as well as HeLa cells with IC 50 in the 100-170 lM range.
