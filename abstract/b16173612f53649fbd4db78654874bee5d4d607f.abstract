The vacuolar aTpase (V-aTpase) plays an important role in tumor progression and metastases. a novel peptide from the a2 isoform of V-aTpase called a2NTD has been shown to exert an immunoregulatory role in the tumor microenvironment by controlling the maturation of monocytes toward a tumor-associated macrophage phenotype. Our data indicate that a2NTD binds to the surface of monocytes. a2NTD was preferentially endocytosed by pro-inflammatory monocytes bearing a cD142 + cD16 + phenotype, which is associated with the monocyte-to-macrophage maturation process. Both a2NTD binding and internalization led to production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-1β by cD142 + cD16 − (classical) and cD142 + cD16 + (intermediate) monocytes. a2NTD was internalized via a macropinocytosis mechanism utilizing scavenger receptors. however, the inhibition of a2NTD endocytosis did not reduce cytokine production by monocytes. This points to the existence of two receptors that respond to a2NTD: scavengers receptors that mediate cellular uptake and an hitherto unidentified receptor stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines.
