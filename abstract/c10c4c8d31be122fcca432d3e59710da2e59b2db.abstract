Graphical Abstract Highlights  VUV/UV/persulfate (VUV/UV/PS) process obviously enhanced methylene blue degradation. VUV UV HO • other SO 4 •-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f  Degradation and mineralization of methylene blue exhibited different trends with pH.  HO • and SO4 •were proved to be the principal reactive oxygen species.  The application potential of VUV/UV/PS process was demonstrated in real waters.  Solution pH notably affected photon absorption distributions and reaction mechanism. This study investigated methylene blue (MB) degradation by the vacuumultraviolet/ultraviolet/persulfate (VUV/UV/PS) process using a mini-fluidic VUV/UV photoreaction system. Results show that MB degradation by the VUV/UV/PS process was significantly higher than that of the conventional UV/PS process, as the VUV photolysis of H2O and PS generated more reactive oxygen species (ROSs). HO • and SO4 •-, identified as the main ROSs, were mostly consumed by dissolved organic carbon and Clin real waters, respectively. Additionally, the impacts of solution pH and the concentrations of PS, humic acid, and inorganic ions (HCO3 -, Cl -, NO3 -, SO4 2-, Fe(II), and Fe(III)) were systematically evaluated. The solution pH significantly affected the photon absorption distributions, as well as the contributions of photolysis and oxidation to MB degradation, resulting in different variations in the degradation rate constant and total organic carbon removal ratio with increasing solution pH. At all tested pH levels (3.0-11.0), particularly under acidic conditions, HO • and SO4 •were two predominant contributors to MB degradation, while VUV and UV photolysis contributed more when the solution pH increased. This study provides a highly efficient process for organic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f pollutant removal, which could be applied in water treatment.
