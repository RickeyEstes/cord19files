Oral corticosteroids are the cornerstone of acute asthma management in the emergency department. Recent evidence has raised doubt about the efficacy of this treatment in preschool-aged children with viral-induced wheezing and in smoking adults. The aims of the study are to: (1) document the magnitude of response to oral corticosteroids in children presenting to the emergency department with moderate or severe asthma; (2) quantify potential determinants of response to corticosteroids, and (3) explore the role of gene polymorphisms associated with the responsiveness to corticosteroids The design is a prospective cohort study of 1008 children aged 1-17 years meeting a strict definition of asthma and presenting with a clinical score of ≥4 on the validated Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM). All children will receive standardized severity-specific treatment with prednisone/prednisolone and co-interventions (salbutamol with/without ipratropium bromide). Determinants, namely viral aetiology, environmental tobacco smoke, and single nucleotide polymorphism will be objectively documented. The primary efficacy endpoint is hospital admission within 72 hours. Secondary endpoints include other measures of asthma severity and time to recovery within 7 days of the index visit. The study has 80% power for detecting a risk difference of 7.5% associated with each determinant from a baseline risk of 21%, at an α of 0.05. Ethical approval has been obtained from all participating institutions. An impaired response to systemic steroids in certain subgroups will challenge the current standard of practice and call for the immediate search for better approaches. A potential host-environment interaction will broaden our understanding
