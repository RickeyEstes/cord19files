medRxiv preprint 6 datasets. The predictive performance was further evaluated in test dataset on lung lobe-and patients-level. Short-term hospital stay (â‰¤10 days) and long-term hospital stay (>10 days). The CT radiomics models based on 6 second-order features were effective in discriminating short-and long-term hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with areas under the curves of 0.97 (95%CI 0.83-1.0) and 0.92 (95%CI 0.67-1.0) by LR and RF, respectively, in the test dataset. The LR model showed a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 and 0.89, and the RF model showed similar performance with sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 1.0 in test dataset. The machine learning-based CT radiomics models showed feasibility and accuracy for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. All rights reserved.

Results A total of 52 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and initial CT images were enrolled from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Lanzhou, and Linxia, China. As of February 20, 14 patients were still hospitalized, and 7 patients had non-findings in CT images. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in the final analysis. The training and inter-validation cohort comprised 26 patients (12 from Ankang, 8 from Lishui, 4 from Lanzhou, and 2 from Linxia) with 59 lesion segments, and test cohort comprised 5 patients from Zhenjiang with 13 lesion segments. The median age was 38.00 (interquartile range, 26.00-47.00) years and 17 (57%) were male. Comorbidities, symptoms and laboratory findings at admission were summarized in Table 1 . The CT radiomics model, based on 6 features (supplementary Table1), showed the highest AUC on the training and inter-validation dataset. The performance of modeling using LR and RF methods was shown in Figure 2. On lung lobe-level, models using LR method significantly distinguished short-and long-term hospital stay (In training and inter-validation datasets, cut-off value 0.31, AUC 0.94 (95%CI 0.92-0.97), sensitivity 1.0, specificity 0.87, NPV 1.0, and PPV 0.88; In test dataset, AUC 0.97 (95%CI 0.83-1.0), sensitivity 1.0, specificity 0.89, NPV 1.0, and PPV 0.8). Besides, models using RF method obtained satisfied results (In training and inter-validation datasets, cut-off value 0.68, AUC 1.0 (95%CI 1.0-1.0), All rights reserved.
