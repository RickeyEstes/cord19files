Rotavirus (RV) replicates in round-shaped cytoplasmic viral factories although 37 how they assemble remains unknown. 38 During RV infection, NSP5 undergoes hyperphosphorylation, which is primed by 39 the phosphorylation of a single serine residue. The role of this post-translational 40 modification in the formation of viroplasms and its impact on the virus replication 41 remains obscure. Here we investigated the role of NSP5 during RV infection by 42 taking advantage of a modified fully tractable reverse genetics system. An NSP5 43 trans-complementing cell line was used to generate and characterise several 44 recombinant rotaviruses (rRVs) with mutations in NSP5. We demonstrate that a 45 rRV lacking NSP5, was completely unable to assemble viroplasms and to 46 replicate, confirming its pivotal role in rotavirus replication. 47 A number of mutants with impaired NSP5 phosphorylation were generated to 48 further interrogate the function of this post-translational modification in the 49 assembly of replication-competent viroplasms. We showed that the rRV mutant 50 strains exhibit impaired viral replication and the ability to assemble round-shaped 51 viroplasms in MA104 cells. Furthermore, we have investigated the mechanism of 52 NSP5 hyper-phosphorylation during RV infection using NSP5 phosphorylation-53 negative rRV strains, as well as MA104-derived stable transfectant cell lines 54 expressing either wt NSP5 or selected NSP5 deletion mutants. Our results 55 indicate that NSP5 hyper-phosphorylation is a crucial step for the assembly of 56 round-shaped viroplasms, highlighting the key role of the C-terminal tail of NSP5 57 in the formation of replication-competent viral factories. Such a complex NSP5 58 phosphorylation cascade may serve as a paradigm for the assembly of functional 59 viral factories in other RNA viruses. 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 .

The non-structural 69 protein NSP5, which undergoes a complex hyperphosphorylation process during 70 RV infection, is required for the formation of these virus-induced organelles. 71 However, its roles in viroplasm formation and RV replication have never been 72 directly assessed due to the lack of a fully tractable reverse genetics (RG) 73 system for rotaviruses. Here we show a novel application of a recently developed 74 RG system by establishing a stable trans-complementing NSP5-producing cell 75 line required to rescue rotaviruses with mutations in NSP5. This approach 76 allowed us to provide the first direct evidence of the pivotal role of this protein 77 during RV replication. Furthermore, using recombinant RV mutants we shed light 78 on the molecular mechanism of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation during infection and 79 its involvement in the assembly and maturation of replication-competent 80 viroplasms. 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97
