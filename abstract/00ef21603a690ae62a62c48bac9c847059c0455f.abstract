In order to establish the prevalence of viral infections of the bovine fetus in Argentina, a serological survey for antibodies against viral agents currently affecting cattle in this country was conducted. Antibodies against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), bovine herpesvirus-1 (BUY-0, bovine leukaemia virus (BLV), bovine rotavirus (BRV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and parainfluenza-3 (ei-3) were investigated in a total of 315 fetal serum samples. Conventional techniques were used: indirect immunofluorescence (FMDV, BHV-1, BVDV and BCV), radial immunodiffusion (BLV), ELISA (BRV) and haemagglutination inhi. bition (eI-3). Antibodies against BHV-1, BVDV and PI-3
