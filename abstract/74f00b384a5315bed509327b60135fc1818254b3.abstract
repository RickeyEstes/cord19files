Non-invasive mechanical ventilation has been increasingly used to avoid or serve as an alternative to intubation. Compared with medical therapy, and in some instances with invasive mechanical ventilation, it improves survival and reduces complications in selected patients with acute respiratory failure. The main indications are exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, pulmonary infi ltrates in immunocompromised patients, and weaning of previously intubated stable patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Furthermore, this technique can be used in postoperative patients or those with neurological diseases, to palliate symptoms in terminally ill patients, or to help with bronchoscopy; however further studies are needed in these situations before it can be regarded as fi rst-line treatment. Non-invasive ventilation implemented as an alternative to intubation should be provided in an intensive care or high-dependency unit. When used to prevent intubation in otherwise stable patients it can be safely administered in an adequately staff ed and monitored ward. We searched Medline, EmBase, and the Cochrane database, using the keywords "non-invasive" or "noninvasive (mechanical) ventilation", for all reports of adults, published until March, 2009. Our search was not limited to publications in English. We selected relevant reports and comprehensive reviews. We also searched the reference lists of identifi ed publications, selecting relevant articles with an emphasis on research of acute respiratory failure.
