To, L.T., Bernard, S. and Lantier, !., 199 l. Fixed-cell immunoperoxidase technique for the study of surface antigens induced by the coronavirus of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV). l~,t. Microbiol., 29: 361-368. An immunoperoxidase technique performed on the TGEV-infected cells was developed for detection of virus-induced antigens. The presence of M antigen of TGEV on the surface of infected cells was demonstrated by this technique. This finding is in contrast to the M protein of murine hepatitis coronavirus which migrates to the Golgi apparatus but is not traasported to the plasma membrane. The time coupe ofannearance M and S antigens on the surface of TGEV-mfected cell can _he_ studied by this technique. 0378-I 135/91/$03.50
