Purpose: There are concerns within the medical profession that antimicrobial agents used in livestock production contribute to the increased antibiotic resistance observed in zoonotic bacterial pathogens. To minimise this risk, evidence-based control strategies need to be implemented. We investigated the effect of chlortetracycline treatment on a tetracycline resistant population of Salmonella typhimurium DT104 and the commensal Escherichia coli population in pigs. Results: Our results show that pigs treated with chlortetracycline consistently shed higher numbers of resistant S . typhimurium DT104 than untreated pigs for up to 6 weeks post-treatment. We also identified a 30% increase in E. coli with a chlortetracycline MIC!/ 16 mg/l and a 10% increase in E. coli with an MIC!/50 mg/l. These effects persisted for up to 2 weeks post-treatment. The tetracycline resistance gene was characterised by gene probing and PCR. The level of chlortetracycline in the pig faeces, as measured by HPLC, fell below our detection limit 5 days after treatment. Conclusion: This study provides direct evidence that oral administration of chlortetracycline to pigs significantly increases the proportion of resistant enteric bacteria, and this shift in resistance outlasts any residual chlortetracycline in the pig faeces. Background: Helicobacter pylori resistance to antimicrobial agents is an important factor compromising the efficacy of therapy. Since initial treatment for H. pylori infection is often empirical, therefore it is very important to monitor the local resistance pattern. Objectives: The aims of our study were: to determine the prevalence of H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole and amoxycillin in children prior to eradication therapy, and to detect mutations responsible for clarithromycin resistance. Material and methods: During 2000 Á/ 2001, 57 H. pylori strains were isolated from gastric biopsies. Susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined by the E -test. Mutations in the 23S rRNA gene associated with clarithromycin resistance were analysed by PCR-RFLP and direct sequencing. Results: Overall, 24 strains (42%) were resistant to metronidazole, 25 strains (44%) were resistant to clarithromycin, and 14 strains (25%) were simultaneously resistant to both drugs. All cultured isolates were sensitive to amoxicillin. Primary resistance to clarithromycin was mainly associated with an A2143G mutation in the 23S rRNA gene of H. pylori . However, isolates containing an A2142G mutation had higher MICs of clarithromycin. Conclusion: Our results show the high prevalence of H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin in Polish children, which implies a need for pretreatment susceptibility testing. 23S rRNA genotype in Helicobacter pylori strains resistant to clarithromycin in children SoA4.3 Objectives: To study the primary resistance to clarithromycin (CLA) in children, to analyse the point mutations associated with CLA resistance and to compare these data with the resistance obtained from adults. Methods: Thirty-six resistant strains from children and 30 from adults were obtained from gastric biopsies. In vitro susceptibility to CLA was determined by an agar dilution method. DNA from the isolates was extracted by the Ge and Taylor method. A2142G and A2143G mutations were determined by PCR-RFLP (Versalovic, 1996). A 1.4 kpb of the 23S rRNA gene was amplified and digested with Bsa I or Mbo II. : S 0 9 2 4 -8 5 7 9 ( 0 2 ) 0 0 0 3 3 -X Contribution of rdxA and frxA mutations to metronidazole resistance in Helicobacter pylori : an examination of multiple-isolate patient sets SoA4.4 Chisholm SA, Owen RJ. Central Public Health Laboratory, Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens, London, UK Purpose: Mutations in rdxA and frxA genes, encoding NADPH nitroreductase and NADPH flavin oxidoreductase, respectively, reportedly lead to metronidazole (Mtz) resistance in Helicobacter pylori . As no single mutation type has been identified that directly correlates with resistance acquisition, we examined rdxA and frxA in paired Mtz sensitive (S) and resistant (R) isolates and in mixed Mtz-S/R strain populations. Isolates from nine dyspeptic patients that had different Mtz susceptibilities (S and R) before and after therapy and mixed Mtz-S/R subpopulations that were separated were tested. Both rdxA and frxA from each isolate population was sequenced. Results: Several different mutations were identified in rdxA , but rarely in frxA , of Mtz-R strains (post-treatment) that were absent in matched Mtz-S strains (pre-treatment). In contrast, sequences from pre-treatment Mtz-R sub-populations were identical to Mtz-S strains in 5/9 cases for rdxA and in 8/9 cases for frxA . Conclusions: Data suggest mutations in rdxA were not always essential for acquisition of Mtz resistance. Observed mutations in the post-treatment Mtz-R isolates may therefore be coincidental and not contributing to the Mtz-R phenotype. For most strains, frxA mutations were not a factor in Mtz resistance of these isolates. Other mechanisms therefore may contribute to Mtz resistance in H. pylori . Accuracy of 23S ribosomal RNA gene mutation analysis for predicting high level clarithromycin resistance in Helicobacter pylori in the United Kingdom SoA4.5 Elviss NC, Owen RJ. Central Public Health Labortory, Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens, London, UK Pre-treatment resistance of Helicobacter pylori to clarithromycin (CLA) and metronidazole (MTZ) is a key factor in eradication therapy failure. Adenine (A) to guanine (G) or A to cytosine (C) mutations at nucleotide 2142, or A to G at 2143 in the 23S rDNA confer in vitro CLA resistance. Our aims were to determine if mutation type and high level CLA resistance was linked and to test for cross-associations with high level MTZ resistance. One thousand one hundred and fifty-one UK isolates from routine endoscopies were tested for susceptibility to CLA and MTZ using E -test. PCR-RFLP identified rDNA mutations in the 92 CLA resistant isolates using Mbo II and Bsa I, respectively for the A2142G and A2143G mutations, and by PCR assay for the A2142C mutation. Mutation frequency was: A2142G, 22.8%; A2143G, 63.0%; and A2142C, 3.3%. In addition, 3.3% were heterozygous for A2142G and A2143G. No mutation was detected in 7.6% of resistant strains (confirmed by sequencing). High level CLA resistance (MIC !/ 256 mg/ml) occurred in 43.3% strains representing 17/21 A2142G mutations. Fifty-six isolates were both CLA and MTZ resistant, of these 30 strains had high level CLA resistance and 27 high level MTZ resistance. No single mutation predominated in dual resistant strains. Our findings indicate that an A2142G mutation predicts a 81.4% likelihood of high level CLA resistance. Our mutation assays provide a specific basis to obtain CLA resistance data for treatment and surveillance. Real-time PCR detection of 23S rDNA mutations conferring clarithromycin resistance in Helicobacter pylori using the Roche Light-Cycler SoA4.6 Lawson AJ, Elviss NC, Owen RJ. Central Public Health Laboratory, Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens, London, UK Helicobacter pylori colonizes the gastric mucosa of Â/50% of the worlds human population. In a significant subgroup of infected hosts, H. pylori is associated with the aetiology of a number of gastric diseases, most notably gastric and duodenal ulceration. The macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin is a key component of many combination therapies used to eradicate H. pylori infection. However, resistance to clarithromycin is an important cause of treatment failure. Clarithromycin resistance is associated with mutations in 23S rRNA nucleotides 2142 and 2143 that inhibit the binding of the drug to the ribosome. A rapid, real-time PCR assay for the detection of 23S rDNA mutations conferring clarithromycin resistance was developed using the Roche LightCycler. The assay utilized a pair of biprobes, one specific for the A2142G mutation and one for the wild type sequence (A2142C and A2143G mutations were detected by characteristic reduction in biprobe Tm). The PCR assay was applied to DNA extracted from 150 selected H. pylori isolates from UK patients and identified the 23S rDNA as wild type (45), A2142G (17), A2142C (3), A2143G (70) and heterozygous (15). These results correlated (95%) with those obtained by disk diffusion sensitivity testing and PCR-RFLP based methodologies. The LightCycler assay was successfully applied to DNA extracted from 20 gastric biopsy samples, thus offering the potential to inform patient management without the necessity of culture.
