Background Acute stroke patients with large artery occlusive disease (LAOD) have a distinct pathophysiology and may respond diff erently to anticoagulation treatments. We compared the effi cacy of a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), nadroparin calcium, with aspirin in Asian acute stroke patients with LAOD. Methods Acute ischaemic stroke patients with onset of symptoms less than 48 h and LAOD (diagnosed by transcranial doppler imaging, carotid duplex scan, or magnetic resonance angiography) were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous nadroparin calcium 3800 anti-factor Xa IU/0路4 mL twice daily or oral aspirin 160 mg daily for 10 days, and then all received aspirin 80-300 mg once daily for 6 months. This study is registered at www.strokecenter.org/trials (number 493). Rankin scale dichotomised at 0-1 (odds ratio 1路55, 95% CI 1路02-2路35). Haemorrhagic transformation of infarct and severe adverse events were similar in both groups. Post-hoc analyses of patients without LAOD, and all treated patients, showed similar proportions with a good outcome in aspirin and LMWH groups (78% vs 79% and 73% vs 75%, respectively). Interpretation Overall, the results do not support a signifi cant benefi t of LMWH over aspirin in patients with LAOD. The benefi ts indicated in most outcome measures warrant further investigation into the use of anticoagulation for acute stroke in patients with large artery atherosclerosis, particularly in intracranial atherosclerosis.
