a b s t r a c t The complexes [Cu 2 (o-NO 2 -C 6 H 4 COO) 4 (PNO) 2 ] (1), [Cu 2 (C 6 H 5 COO) 4 (2,2 0 -BPNO)] n (2), [Cu 2 (C 6 H 5 COO) 4 -(4,4 0 -BPNO)] n (3), [Cu(p-OH-C 6 H 4 COO) 2 (4,4 0 -BPNO) 2 ÁH 2 O] n (4), (where PNO = pyridine N-oxide, 2,2 0 -BPNO = 2,2 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0 -dioxide, 4,4 0 -BPNO = 4,4 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0 -dioxide) are prepared and characterized and their magnetic properties are studied as a function of temperature. Complex 1 is a discrete dinuclear complex while complexes 2-4 are polymeric of which 2 and 3 have paddle wheel repeating units. Magnetic susceptibility measurements from polycrystalline samples of 1-4 revealed strong antiferromagnetic interactions within the {Cu 2 } 4+ paddle wheel units and no discernible interactions between the units. The complex 5, [Cu(NicoNO) 2 Á2H 2 O] n Á4nH 2 O, in which the bridging ligand to the adjacent copper(II) ions is nicotinate N-oxide (NicoNO) the transmitted interaction is very weakly antiferromagnetic.
