This article investigates the dispersion of airborne pollutants emitted from different locations near a high-rise building. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for simulating the wind flow field and the pollutant dispersion was developed and validated by wind tunnel data. Then the spreading of the pollutant emitted from different locations to a rectangular-shaped high-rise residential (HRR) building was numerically studied. The pollutant source location was set in a wide range of the position angle and distance between the source and the building. It was found that the pollutant concentration on the building decreases with an increase in the emission distance whereas the effect of the position angle is more complicated. Interestingly, there is a critical range of the position angle from which the emitted pollutants will not spread to the building in a significant way. The effect of the source location was linked to the wind flow field around the building, particularly with several major flows. The vertical distributions of the pollutant concentration on different faces were also investigated, and it was found that these are more affected by the vertical flow near each face. Finally, a mathematical model was developed to evaluate the pollutant concentration as a function of the emission distance and position angle. These findings are helpful to the understanding of the dispersion of airborne pollutants around high-rise buildings and the related hazard management in urban design. et al. / Applied Mathematical Modelling 81 (2020) 582-602 583 Rising reports of such outbreaks have attracted scientific attention on understanding the spreading of airborne hazards in urban areas, which is helpful for the prediction and control of the outbreak of airborne diseases for public health [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The pollutant outbreaks are riskier near high-rise residential (HRR) buildings due to the high population density [12] . Additionally, the spreading of pollutants around and inside such buildings is more complex as a result of strong windstructure interactions and diverse spreading scenarios. Pollutants may be emitted from an HRR building (e.g. from a kitchen exhaust) and spread to the same building at different positions [13 , 14] , like the possible SARS spreading in typical HRR buildings in Hong Kong [15] [16] [17] . Pollutants may also be released from sources located around a HRR building at lower levels [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , such as the evaporative facilities (e.g. cooling tower or air scrubber) of public facilities, which have been responsible for reported disease outbreaks [23] [24] [25] . Accordingly, the position of the potential pollutant source is an important factor in evaluating the risk of the spreading of pollutants near an HRR building, but it has not been fully evaluated in terms of the distance and the position angle between the source and the building. The spreading of pollutants in urban areas has been studied using various methods. Wind tunnel is a valuable tool in studying such pollutant dispersion under controllable wind flow and weather conditions [14 , 26-28] . However, detailed information, such as the flow field, is difficult to obtain from wind tunnel experiments, even with the most advanced techniques such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) [29] . Therefore, numerical models based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have been increasingly used to assist physical experimental studies. Such CFD models need to be carefully calibrated for specific problems, especially when considering the turbulence model and boundary conditions [30] . With the increasing of CFD studies in recent years, several effort s have been made to establish standard procedures for the accurate CFD simulation of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) in wind tunnels [31] [32] [33] . The choice of turbulence model in a CFD model normally needs to consider the balance between prediction accuracy and computational effort, which could be different for different problems investigated. It has been shown that Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models are capable of predicting accurate pollutant dispersions in 2D and 3D urban models [34] [35] [36] . It has been shown that the combination of CFD and wind tunnel is effective in studying the detailed wind flow field and the spreading of pollutants, which is very helpful to the understanding of the micromechanisms of various controlling variables, such as the emission height, the re-entry of the building, the wind incident angle, the buoyancy effect, inter-unit dispersion, intake fraction and residential exposure [17 , 37-41] . However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive studies have been conducted on the effect of the pollutant source location on the spreading of pollutants to a nearby highrise building. This paper contributes to filling this gap using a numerical model. The model was validated by good agreement with the measured data in a wind tunnel experiment on the pollutant dispersion around a high-rise building [28] . Then the model was used to investigate the spreading of pollutants from a wide range of emission locations around a building. From the numerical simulations, the pollutant concentrations on different faces and levels of the building were quantified and analyzed in connection with the wind flow field. The correlation between the pollutant concentration and the pollutant source location was studied. Based on that, a mathematical model was established, which can help assess the risk of pollutant dispersion from different regions around a building in an overall picture. These results are helpful in the planning and risk management of urban HRR buildings. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The studied building and environment and the corresponding CFD model are introduced in Sections 2.1 and Section 2.2 , respectively, and the model validation is presented in Section 2.3 . Then Section 3.1 analyses the simulated wind flow and pollutant dispersion to each building face in regards to pollutant source location, Section 3.2 further investigates the vertical distribution of the pollutant concentration on the building faces, and Section 3.3 proposes a mathematical model which facilitates an overview of the effect of pollutant location. Finally, Section 4 summarizes the findings and concludes the paper. The grid information and mesh independence analysis are described in the Appendix to avoid distracting the attention of the readers. Model description The physical model used in the model validation was based on a 1:30 scaled model of a 10-storey high-rise building 30 m in height, which is a typical HRR building in Hong Kong, and with a cruciform section and a so-called "re-entry" along each wing. Re -entry is a cul-de-sac design in order to accommodate a window/opening for all rooms to comply with the Hong Kong building code. Pollutant emission from an exhaust on the building was studied in a series of wind tunnel experiments [28] . The Reynolds number based on the building's height (ReU H H/ Î½) exceeds the suggested value of 15,0 0 0 to ensure that the measurements were independent of Re and the reduced-scale model can be reliably used [42] . The dimensions of the building model and wind properties were extracted from the boundary layer wind tunnel test and used for the validation of the numerical model. Additionally, a generic rectangular-shaped building was also modelled, which has the same outer profile as the cruciform-shaped building with the ratio between the height H, breadth B and depth D given by H:B: D = 1:0.98:1.04, as shown in Fig. 1 . Note the cruciform-shaped building model was used mainly for the validation of the numerical model as it was used in the wind tunnel experiment. The flow domain considered in the numerical model is illustrated in Fig. 2 . Although some guidelines recommend the maximum blockage ratio for wind tunnel modelling can be as high as 10% [32] , a blockage ratio smaller than 3% is normally recommended for modelling the hypothetic open terrain [43] to prevent an artificial acceleration of the flow around the building, and there are recommendations for the blockage E.
