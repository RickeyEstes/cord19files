Cell culture Buffalo green monkey (BGM) kidney cells, HeLa R19 cells, and rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells were grown at 37Â°C, 5% CO 2 in DMEM Ready Mix (PAA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum or in DMEM (Lonza) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Vero, HeLa H and BGM cells used in the multicycle antiviral assays were grown in MEM supplemented with 10% FCS (Integro), 2 mM Lglutamine and 20 mM HEPES. HAP1 cells (Carette et al., 2011) (provided by Thijn Brummelkamp, NKI, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) were grown in IMDM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
