Taxonomic classification for the Coronaviridae can be challenging, due to the wide host tropism 30 and highly variable genome of the viruses in this Family. Within the Alphacoronavirus genus, there is a 31 single species Alphacoronavirus 1 that encompasses several biologically distinct viruses of distinct animal 32 species. Here, we carried out phylogenetic analysis of members of the Alphacoronavirus genus, focusing 33 on the viral spike gene, which is a primary driver of viral tropism and pathogenesis. We identify two 34 distinct clades (A and B) within the Alphacoronavirus 1 species. Alphacoronavirus 1 clade A 35 encompasses serotype I FCoV and CCoV, and Alphacoronavirus 1 clade B, encompasses serotype II 36 FCoV and CCoV and TGEV-like viruses. We propose this clade designation, along with the newly 37 proposed Alphacoronavirus 2 species, as an improved way to classify the diverse Alphacoronavirus 38 genus.
