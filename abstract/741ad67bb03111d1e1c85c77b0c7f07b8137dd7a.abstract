An analytical method for the quantitative measurement of ML-7, a product with possible anti-immune escape activity for feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), in feline plasma was developed and validated. The sample preparation consists of a solid-phase extraction step on an MCX cartridge. ML-7 and ML-9, used as the internal standard for the analysis, were separated on an ACQUITY UPLC TM BEH C 18 reversedphase column (1.7 m, 50 mm × 2.1 mm I.D.), using isocratic elution with acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water as the mobile phase. Both compounds were subsequently quantified in MRM mode on a Micromass ® Quattro Premier TM XE triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The use of a Thermo Scientific ® Exactive TM orbitrap mass spectrometer made it possible to confirm the proposed fragmentation pattern of both ML-7 and ML-9. A validation study according to EC requirements was carried out, in which the method showed good performance. Linear behaviour was observed in the 1-2500 ng ml −1 range, which is relevant for real sample analysis. Accuracy and precision were within the criteria requested by the EC requirements throughout this concentration range. Extraction recovery of ML-7 was 72%. Matrix effect for ML-7 was not higher than 8%. The method was successfully used for the monitoring of ML-7 in feline plasma after intravenous, subcutaneous or oral administration of an ML-7 formulation, for the determination of pharmacokinetic parameters, with a limit of quantification of 1 ng ml −1 and a limit of detection of 0.4 ng ml −1 . The proposed method also shows good characteristics for the analysis of ML-7 in plasma of other animal species and human plasma.
