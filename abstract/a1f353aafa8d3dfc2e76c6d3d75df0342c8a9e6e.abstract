RNA extraction, a 10-µL aliquot of the extracted preparation was mixed with 15 µL of reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) master mix, which containing 12.5 µL of 2× reaction mix, 0.5 µL of SuperScript III RT/ Platinum Taq Mix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 5 pmole of each forward and reverse primer, and adjusted to a volume of 15 µL with nuclease-free distilled water. For influenza A H1, the reaction condition was 30 min at 45°C for reverse transcription followed by 2 min at 94°C, and 30 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 52°C and 1 min at 68°C; and a final extension of 10 min at 68°C. The reaction condition for influenza A H3 was similar, except that reverse transcription was carried out at 50°C and the annealing temperature was 55°C. The PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis and visualized by SYBR safe DNA stain (Invitrogen) under gel documentation system. The product size of influenza A H1 was 431 bp; the influenza A H3 product was 232 bp.
