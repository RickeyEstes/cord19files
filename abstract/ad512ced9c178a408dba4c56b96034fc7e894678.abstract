Public Health immunization registries and the immunization ecosystem have evolved over the past two decades to become significant population health data assets. Clinical providers and pharmacists are reporting the immunizations given to their patients to public health registries in 49 states and all territories, creating consolidated immunization event patient records. This paper builds upon early experiments to empower individuals in this ecosystem by leveraging the value of these public health data assets and trusted communications, illustrating the possibilities for engaging consumers to support reducing the impact of emerging diseases, outbreaks and the next pandemic. This paper will suggest the value of the IE and the role individuals can play within their own social networks to advance public health efforts to manage disease events. In turn, this social mission would encourage consumers to be more proactive in managing their own healthcare.
