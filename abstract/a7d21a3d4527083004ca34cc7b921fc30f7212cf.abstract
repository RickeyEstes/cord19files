The collection and evaluation of synovial fluid in veterinary medicine was first used for the diagnosis of large animal lameness and joint disease. With the growth of knowledge and sophistication in the medical, radiographic, and orthopedic specialties, our focus in small animal arthrology and orthopedics expanded from fracture and cruciate repair to include the evaluation of degenerative, immune-mediated, infectious, and noninflammatory joint diseases. In the laboratory, methods for small animal specimens were modified to accommodate the smaller sample volumes. Concurrently, there has been a rapid increase in the number of serologic tests for the detection of infectious agents and immune disorders. From these beginnings, veterinarians can now recognize and treat an expanding list of joint diseases.
