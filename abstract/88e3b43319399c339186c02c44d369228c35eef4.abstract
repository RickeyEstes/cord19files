Cancer gene therapy is a great promising tool for cancer therapeutics due to the specific targeting based on the cancerous gene expression background. Binary systems based on sitespecific recombination are one of the most effective potential approaches for cancer gene therapy. In these systems, a cancer specific promoter expresses a site-specific recombinase/integrase that in turn controls the expression of a toxin gene. In the current study, we have developed a new HK022 bacteriophage Integrase (Int) based binary system activating a Diphtheria toxin (DTA) gene expression specifically in cancer cells. We have demonstrated the efficiency, and the high specificity of the system in vitro in cell cultures and in vivo in a lung cancer mouse model. Strikingly, different apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors demonstrated a remarkable efficacy killing capability of the Int-based binary system compared to the conventional hTERT-DTA mono system in the LLC-Kat lung cancer mice model; we observed that the active hTERT promoter down regulation by the transcription factors Mad-1 is the cornerstone of this phenomenon. The new Int-based binary system offers advantages over already known counterparts and may therefore be developed into a safer and efficient cancer treatment technology.
