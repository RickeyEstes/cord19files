Arthritogenic alphaviruses comprise a group of enveloped RNA viruses that are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and cause debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease 1 . The host factors required for alphavirus entry remain poorly characterized 2 . Using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screen, we identified the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 as an entry mediator for multiple emerging arthritogenic alphaviruses including chikungunya (CHIKV), Ross River, Mayaro, and O'nyong nyong (ONNV) viruses. Gene editing of mouse Mxra8 or human MXRA8 resulted in reduced viral infection of cells, and reciprocally, ectopic expression resulted in increased infection. Mxra8 bound directly to CHIKV particles and enhanced virus attachment and Users may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use: http://www.nature.
