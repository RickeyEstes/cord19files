Background: Early administration of appropriate antimicrobials has been correlated with a better prognosis in bacteremic patients, but a research highlighting a comparison of the adverse impact of inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy between patient with Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteremia is insufficient. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, adults with communityonset monomicrobial bacteremia during the 6-year period were enrolled. Clinical information was retrieved from medical records, using a predetermined case record form. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the disk diffusion method, based on performance standards of the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute in 2016. A propensity-score-matched analysis was performed to control for the baseline characteristics at bacteremia onset between the Gram-positive and Gram-negative groups. The propensity score was calculated by the independent predictors of 28-day crude mortality recognized by a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: The total 2,053 adults (Gram-positive, 566 patients and Gram-negative, 1,487) presenting with community-onset monomicrobial bacteremia between the six-year period were recruited. Bacteremia severity (a Pitt bacteremia score) at onset and initial manifestation was different between two groups. On the basis of seven independent predictors of 28-day mortality recognized by the multivariate regression.566 of the 1,487 patients in the Gramnegative group were matched to 566 patients in the Gram-positive group with the closest propensity scores. After appropriate propensity-score matching, no significant differences were observed in baseline characteristics and patient outcomes between the two groups, in terms of age, bacteremia severity, major comorbidities, comorbidity severity, and 28-day mortality.
