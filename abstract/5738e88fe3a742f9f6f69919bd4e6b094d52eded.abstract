Objective: Six core competencies designed by Accreditation council for Graduate medical education (ACGME) is essential for establishing a patient center holistic medical system. Postgraduate year-1 (PGY 1 ) residents are main members to take care of patients in the medical system. In order to train PGY 1 resident, we should construct a training program for clinical teacher to help them familiar with ACGME competencies. Our study aims to assess the effectiveness of "training program of ACGME competencies for clinical teacher". Methods: During 2009 and 2010 years, we trained 134 clinical teachers to teach and train PGY 1 residents about ACGME competencies. Results: The participants of our training program reported that the most teaching skills that they used in teaching were learnt from circuit and itinerant bedside, physical examination (PE) teaching demonstration, lectures and video watching of "how to teach ACGME Competencies?". Participants reported that circuit bedside teaching demonstration mainly train the teaching skills of participants for the interpersonal and communication skills (ICS) domain; itinerant teaching demonstration mainly teach the participants the teaching skills of professionalism (P) domain. Both lectures of training camp and video watching for "how to teach ACGME competencies?" increase the familiarity of participants to train and teach PGY 1 resident about ACGME competencies. Participants came from internal medicine departments; longer years as the attending physical and having the experience of PGY 1 clinical teachers applied the most teaching skills learnt from training program on their teaching. Conclusions: Our study suggested that ACGME competencies-based "training program of ACGME competencies for clinical teacher" were effectively established the training and teaching skills of clinical teachers for PGY 1 residents.

Our study used questionnaires analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the training activities of our center on the teaching and evaluation of PGY 1 clinical teachers for six core-competencies. The 40-hour basic training course effectively improved the attitudes, familiarity and training abilities of participants in the domains of patient care, interpersonal and communication skills, and medical knowledge. Post-course training workshops and video watching further enhanced the familiarity and teaching ability of clinical teachers in the domains of system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, and professionalism. Different activities in the training program cultivate the teaching skills of different domain of ACGEM six core competencies. Data from questionnaires after finishing the basal 40-hour training course, the post-course workshop and video watching and 3-month follow-up suggested that the degree of the application of teaching skills learnt from different activities are increased progressively. This study finds that a competency-based training program can effectively establish the training and instructional skills of clinical teachers, ensuring that PGY 1 resident competencies are taught effectively. This study is limited by the fact that questionnaire used to track and assess the effectiveness of the training program may have had information and recall bias. In addition, this study had a small sample size and did not contain a control group. There are as yet no controlled educational trials on this subject.
