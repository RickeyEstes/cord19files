► This study quantified household preparedness for emergency events for the first time in China and identified factors associated with emergency preparedness. ► The findings of the determinants of poor household preparedness are closely aligned with the Chinese auspicious culture. ► One adult respondent from each household was invited to complete the survey but opinions from the family members might not have always been consistent. ► The 14 emergency items included in this study reflected priorities in emergency responses in China which might not be exhaustive. The importance of the emergency items was not differentiated either. ► We presented the results of both logistic regression and linear regression analyses which were largely consistent. Objective This study aimed to assess household preparedness for emergency events and its determinants in China. Design A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted on 3541 households in China in 2015. Participants Households were selected using a stratified cluster sampling strategy, representing central, eastern, western and southern regions of China. The designed questionnaires were administered through face-to-face interviews. Outcome measures Household emergency preparedness was measured with 14 indicators, tapping into the supply of nine emergency necessities (food and water, extra batteries, battery-powered radio, battery-operated torch, first-aid kit, gas mask, fire extinguisher, escape ropes, whistle), coverage of accident insurance, knowledge of local emergency response systems (emergency numbers, exit routes and shelters) and availability of a household evacuation plan. If an individual acted on 9 of the 14 indicators, they were deemed well prepared. Logistic regression models were established to identify predictors of well preparedness based on 3541 returned questionnaires containing no missing values. results Only 9.9% of households were well prepared for emergencies: 53.6% did not know what to do and 31.6% did not want to think about it. A higher level of preparedness was found in the respondents who have attained higher education (adjusted OR=0.826 compared with the higher level), participated in emergency training activities (adjusted OR=2.299), had better emergency knowledge (adjusted OR=2.043), reported less fate-submissiveness (adjusted OR=1.385) and more self-reliance (adjusted OR=1.349), prior exposure to emergency events (adjusted OR=1.280) and held more positive attitudes towards preparedness (adjusted OR=1.286). Conclusion Household preparedness for emergency events is poor in China. Lack of motivation, negative attitude to preparedness and knowledge shortfall are major but remediable barriers for household preparedness.
