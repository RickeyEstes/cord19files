Peritoneum and retroperitoneum of pyriform or crescent-shaped organisms, about 5 X 7 txm in size, with a faint nucleus and eosinophilic cytoplasm, applied to the surface epithelium, or in the lumen of colonic glands, usually in large numbers. However, the organisms are present in only a little over half the sections examined from infected cats, and multiple samples may be necessary in order to have a high probability of detecting them. In some cases, trichomonads appear to disrupt the epithelium, attaining the subepithelial lamina propria around crypts, or they are associated with ulceration and loci of necrosis and pyogranulomatous inflammation that are distributed transmurally in affected areas of colon, and in draining lymph nodes.
