The 4a and 4b proteins of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been described for their antagonism on host innate immunity. However, unlike clustering patterns of the complete gene sequences of human and camel MERS-CoVs, the 4a and 4b protein coding regions did not constitute species-specific phylogenetic groups. Moreover, given the estimated evolutionary rates of the complete, 4a, and 4b gene sequences, the 4a and 4b proteins might be less affected by species-specific innate immune pressures. These results suggest that the 4a and 4b proteins of MERS-CoV may function against host innate immunity in a manner independent of host species and/or evolutionary clustering patterns. Human infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the family Coronaviridae, was first reported in 2012 [1]. Since then, more than 2,200 laboratory-confirmed cases have been described with an estimated 35.5% case-fatality rate [2] . Middle East countries appeared to be mainly affected by the life-threatening pathogenicity of the virus, but some exported cases were also reported in Asia, Europe, and the United States of America [1,3]. Given zoonotic transmission of the virus from dromedary camels to humans and its lethality in humans [1], vaccines and/or antivirals should be prepared, but no approved medical countermeasures are available, yet. In line with the pathogenic mechanisms reported with MERS-CoV [4], such as acute respiratory symptoms and local immune responses, viral antagonism against host innate immune responses may be of great significance in terms of the pandemic potential and host range restriction of the virus. Viral antagonism had been already described for , and, of the MERS-CoV proteins, protein 4a was suggested responsible for its role against RNA-dependent protein kinase-mediated antiviral immunity and activation of retinoic acidinducible gene I and Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5 of host cells [6, 7] . The antagonistic effects of MERS-CoV protein 4b were also demonstrated against nuclear factor-ÎºB-dependent immunity and RNase L activation of host cells [8, 9] . As shown for influenza and Zika viruses [10, 11] , the species-specific effects of viral antagonism of MERS-CoV on J Vet Sci.
