Cole T, Dale P, van Dolleweerd CJ, Isitt V et al.: Regulatory approval and a first-in-human phase I clinical trial of a monoclonal antibody produced in transgenic tobacco plants. Plant Biotechnol J 2015, 13:1106-1120. This is an excellent case study to learn about the historical development of plant-derived HIV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (P2G12) which has been entering into the clinical phases. The clinical evaluation proved that P2G12 was safe and well tolerated in healthy women when administered intravaginally.
