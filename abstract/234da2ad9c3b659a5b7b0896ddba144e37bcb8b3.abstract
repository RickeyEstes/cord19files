They also received 0.23 (95% CI: 0.03e0.44, p Z 0.0283) more doses of bronchodilator in the first hour of ED stay. Improvements in asthma education and discharge planning were noted, but the changes were not statistically significant. Conclusions: After the implementation of an evidence-based guideline reminder card, medication treatment for acute asthma in the ED was significantly improved; however, asthma education and discharge planning remained unchanged. Future efforts on promoting guideline-based practice in the ED should focus on these components. ª
