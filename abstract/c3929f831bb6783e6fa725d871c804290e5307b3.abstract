ing in the cell that synthesizes and maintains the myelin sheath , we analyzed JHMV pathogenesis in transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative IFN-␥ receptor on oligodendroglia. Defective IFN-␥ signaling was associated with enhanced oligodendroglial tropism and delayed virus clearance. However, the CNS inflammatory cell composition and CD8 ؉ T-cell effector functions were similar between transgenic and wild-type mice , supporting unimpaired peripheral and CNS immune responses in transgenic mice. Surprisingly , increased viral load in oligodendroglia did not affect the extent of myelin loss, the frequency of oligodendroglial apoptosis , or CNS recruitment of macrophages. These data demonstrate that IFN-␥ receptor signaling is critical for the control of JHMV replication in oligodendroglia. In addition, the absence of a correlation between increased oligodendroglial infection and the extent of demyelination suggests a complex pathobiology of myelin loss in which infection of oligodendroglia is required but not sufficient.

For example, viruses that preferentially infect and/or persist in neurons are generally controlled by noncytolytic effector strategies, including neutralizing antibodies (Ab) and interferon-␥ (IFN-␥). 2 By contrast, acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, which results in inflammation of the choroid plexus and meninges, is controlled by CD8 ϩ T cells that use perforin-dependent cytolysis. 3,4 However, during chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection in which virus persists predominantly in neurons, cytolytic CD8 ϩ T-cell mechanisms are ineffective with recovery mediated by Ab and cytokines. 5,6 The neurotropic coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain JHM (JHMV), induces an acute encephalomyelitis associated with myelin loss; however, an insufficient immune response results in viral persistence. 7,8 JHMV initially infects ependymal cells, but as infection progresses it becomes polytropic and infects astrocytes, microglia, and macrophages. 8 As infection enters the white matter, oligodendroglia are primary targets of JHMV replication. 8 A concerted immune response, involving cellular and humoral effector mechanisms, controls acute and chronic JHMV infection. 7,9 -11 JHMV infection induces CNS recruitment of inflammatory cells comprising components of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. Virus-specific CD4 ϩ and CD8 ϩ T cells are both present within the inflamed CNS. 9 However, CD8 ϩ T cells are directly associated with the control of infectious virus. 9,10 By contrast CD4 ϩ T cells appear to play an auxiliary role by promoting CD8 ϩ T cell expansion and survival 12 and
