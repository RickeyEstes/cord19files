Astrocytes can function as antigen-presenting cells (APC) upon expression of class II antigens, which are induced by interferon-7 (IFN-7). Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) can act synergistically with IFN-7 with respect to class II expression on a variety of cells. As brain cells themselves can secrete TNF-like factors upon stimulation, we examined the effect of TNF-a on IFN-y-mediated class II induction on astrocytes. TNF-a alone had no effect on class II expression, but did synergize with IFN-7 for enhanced expression of class II antigens. The specificity of TNF-a activity was demonstrated by blocking the amplifying effect of TNF-a with a polyclonal anti-TNF-a antibody. Kinetic analysis of the synergistic effect indicated that optimal TNF-a enhancement of class II expression was observed when astrocytes were pretreated with IFN-7 12-24 h prior to TNF-a addition. A possible mechanism for the synergistic action between IFN-y and TNF-a may be increased TNF-a receptor expression by IFN-y. Astrocytes treated with IFN-7 for 24 h express more TNF-a receptors (3900/ce11) than do untreated astrocytes (2483/ce11), with no significant change in the binding affinity (Ka). These results suggest that the synergistic activity of TNF-a requires an inductive signal from IFN-7, which in part may be increased TNF-a receptor expression. Altogether, our observations indicate that TNF-a enhances ongoing class II major histocompatibility complex gene expression in rat astrocytes, which in this system is initially induced by IFN-7. TNF-a exerts its effect by binding to high affinity TNF-a receptors on astrocytes, whose expression is also enhanced by IFN-7. These two cytokines work in concert to elevate class II expression on astrocytes, an event which can contribute to initiation and/or perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses.
