Background: Seasonal influenza vaccination routinely has been recommended for healthcare personnel (HCP) since 1984. The influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine (H1N1 vaccine) became available in the U.S. in October 2009. Purpose: To assess 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccination coverage and identify factors independently associated with vaccination among HCP in the U.S. Methods: Data from the 2009 -2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) influenza supplemental survey were analyzed in 2011. Multivariable logistic regression and predictive marginal models were performed to identify factors independently associated with vaccination among HCP. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis procedure was used to estimate the cumulative proportion of people vaccinated. Results: Among 16,975 HCP surveyed, 2009 H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccination coverage were 34.1% (95% CIϭ32.7%, 35.5%); 52.4% (95% CIϭ50.9%, 53.9%); and 58.0% (95% CIϭ56.5%, 59.5%), respectively, all of which were signifıcantly higher than those for non-HCP (19.1%, 34.9%, and 40.3%, respectively). The H1N1 vaccination coverage among HCP ranged from 18.4% in Mississippi to 56.1% in Massachusetts and seasonal influenza vaccination coverage ranged from 40.4% in Florida to 73.1% in Nebraska. Characteristics independently associated with an increased likelihood of 2009 H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccinations among HCP were as follows: non-Hispanic white, higher income, having a high-risk condition, having health insurance, the ability to see a doctor if needed, and having had a routine checkup in the previous year. Conclusions: Vaccination coverage was higher among HCP than non-HCP but still below the national health objective of 90%. Knowledge of national and state-specifıc H1N1 and seasonal vaccination coverage among HCP is useful for evaluating the vaccination campaign and implementing strategies for increasing yearly seasonal vaccination coverage and improving vaccination coverage among HCP in possible future pandemics.
