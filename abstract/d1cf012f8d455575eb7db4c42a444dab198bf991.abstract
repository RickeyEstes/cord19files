The 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is vital for SARS-CoV replication and is a promising drug target. Structure based virtual screening of 308 307 chemical compounds was performed using the computation tool Autodock 3.0.5 on a WISDOM Production Environment. The top 1468 ranked compounds with free binding energy ranging from À14.0 to À17.09 kcal mol À1 were selected to check the hydrogen bond interaction with amino acid residues in the active site of 3CL pro . Fifty-three compounds from 35 main groups were tested in an in vitro assay for inhibition of 3CL pro expressed by Escherichia coli. Seven of the 53 compounds were selected; their IC 50 ranged from 38.57 ± 2.41 to 101.38 ± 3.27 lM. Two strong 3CL pro inhibitors were further identified as competitive inhibitors of 3CL pro with K i values of 9.11 ± 1.6 and 9.93 ± 0.44 lM. Hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions of compound with amino acid residues in the active site of 3CL pro were also identified. Ó 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a severe febrile respiratory illness caused by SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 1,2 A global outbreak of SARS between March 2003 and July 2003 caused over 8 000 probable or confirmed cases and 774 deaths. 3 A mortality rate as high as 10% has been estimated by the World Health Organization. 3, 4 The possibility of the reemergence of SARS is a serious threat, since efficient therapy and a vaccine are not currently available. 5 The SARS-CoV genome contains 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs). 6 Two large 5 0 -terminal ORFs, designated 1a and 1b, encode two overlapping polyproteins, respectively designated pp1a and pp1b, which have to be cleaved extensively to produce proteins necessary for viral RNA synthesis and genome replication. 6,7 SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) plays a major role in the processing of the viral polyproteins and control of the activity of the replicase complex. 8 The enzymatic activity of 3CL pro is essential for the viral life cycle and, therefore, represents an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs directed against SARS-CoV and other coronavirus infections. 9 Over the past decade, high-throughput virtual screening (VS) has emerged; especially structure based virtual screening (SBVS), as a reliable, cost-effective and time-saving technique for the discovery of lead compounds as an alternative to high-throughput screening. 10 VS applied to the discovery of new enzyme inhibitors involves docking, computational fitting of structures of compounds to the active site of an enzyme, and scoring and ranking of each compound. 11 In this study, we identified novel 3CL pro inhibitors among 308,307 compounds by SBVS with docking calculations on a WIS-DOM (Wide In Silico Docking On Malaria) production environment (WPE). 12 Additionally, the inhibition activity and enzyme kinetics were characterized by in vitro enzyme assay. A 3-Dimensional coordinate in the X-ray crystal structure of 3CL pro (PDB accession code 2ZU5) 13 obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB; http:// www.pdb.org) 14 was used as the receptor model in the SBVS with docking simulations. After removing the water molecules, the polar hydrogen (H) atoms were added to the macromolecule, histidine residues were made neutral and Kollman charges were assigned for all atoms. 15 The docking library for 3CL pro was comprised of 0960-894X/$ -see front matter Ó
