Scuba diving is one of the dominant activity-based tourism options found in tropical and temperate waters worldwide. The major recreational diver training agencies recorded 1,73,476 new diver certifications in 2003. Each certification supports dive travel, accommodation, equipment sales and a range of marine facilities. Despite this role the global industry is in something of a crisis where, after many years of sustained growth, certification rates for new divers show signs of decline (Dive Equipment Manufacturer's Association, 2004). Since mistakes made in the marine environment can have very serious consequences, safety has always been of particular concern to dive tourism operators and government agencies charged with protecting visitors. The recent release of the movie 'Open Water' describing two American tourist scuba divers left at sea by a charter operator has increased public interest and attention to safety in dive tourism. This chapter details the challenges and responses for dive tourism drawing on Australian experiences.
