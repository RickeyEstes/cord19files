Escherichia coli was first recognized as a cause of diarrhea and septicemia in calves more than 115 years ago. 1 Intestinal infection with E coli manifested principally by diarrhea is commonly known as enteric colibacillosis, in contrast to septicemic and enterotoxemic colibacillosis, which are characterized by systemic infection and peracute collapse. 2,3 Diarrheagenic E coli are now broadly placed into 6 classes based on virulence mechanisms. 4,5 One of these classes, enterotoxigenic E coli (ETEC), is the most common cause of diarrhea in beef and dairy calves in the first 4 days of life. 3,6 ETEC are characterized principally by the production of fimbriae and enterotoxins, with strains producing K99 (now called F5) fimbria and heat-stable enterotoxin-a (STa) as the main ones causing disease in calves. 3-6 Two other diarrheagenic classes, namely enterohemorrhagic E coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E coli (EPEC), are important causes of disease in human beings, but less well substantiated causes of diarrhea in calves. [3] [4] [5] [6] E coli strains that cause hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans, express high levels of Shiga toxin (Stx), cause attaching-effacing (A/E) lesions in intestinal epithelial cells, and possess a specific 60-MDa EHEC plasmid are known as EHEC. 7 Hence, using this original definition, the causation of human illness (HC or HUS) was an obligatory criterion for identification of an isolate as EHEC. 7 One feature EHEC and EPEC have in common is the causation of intestinal epithelial lesions known as attaching and effacing (A/E). 4, 5, 8 Attaching-effacing E coli (AEEC) is a designation for those E coli strains known to cause A/E lesions or at least carry the genes for this trait, and therefore include organisms that fall into either the EHEC or EPEC classes. 4, 5, 8 A distinction between EHEC and EPEC is that the former produce Stx, whereas the latter do not. 4,5 E coli strains that produce or carry genes for the production of Stx (also known as Verotoxin or Verocytotoxin [VT], and formerly
