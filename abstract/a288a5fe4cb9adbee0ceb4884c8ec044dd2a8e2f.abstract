The objective of this paper is to review adaptive immunity of young animals using examples from my own experience and from the literature. Trials carried out by us with a modified live and inactivated canine parvovirus vaccine in newborn puppies provide evidence of the immune capacity of these puppies. With regard to transfer of immunity from mother to offspring, there is a role for transplacental and colostral immunity Examples of passive protection of young animals against diRerent infections include passive protection of kittens against the feline immunodeficiency virus. However; passive immunity, though very useful at an early age, varies in duration and makes implementation of standard vaccination schedules dificult. Other experiments demonstrate that, under certain conditions, it is possible to overcome residual maternally-derived antibodies and to induce post-vaccinal immunity 0 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.
