The genus Torovirus (subfamily Torovirinae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) 12 encompasses a range of species that infect domestic ungulates including cattle, 13 sheep, goats, pigs and horses, causing an acute self-limiting gastroenteritis. Using the 14 prototype species equine torovirus (EToV) we performed parallel RNA sequencing 15 (RNA-seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) to analyse the relative expression levels 16 of the known torovirus proteins and transcripts, chimaeric sequences produced via 17 discontinuous RNA synthesis (a characteristic of the nidovirus replication cycle) and 18 changes in host transcription and translation as a result of EToV infection. RNA 19 sequencing confirmed that EToV utilises a unique combination of discontinuous and 20 non-discontinuous RNA synthesis to produce its subgenomic RNAs; indeed, we 21 identified transcripts arising from both mechanisms that would result in sgRNAs 22 encoding the nucleocapsid. Our ribosome profiling analysis revealed that ribosomes 23 efficiently translate two novel CUG-initiated ORFs, located within the so-called 5' 24 UTR. We have termed the resulting proteins U1 and U2. Comparative genomic 25 analysis confirmed that these ORFs are conserved across all available torovirus 26 . CC-BY 4.0
