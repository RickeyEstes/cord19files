New protein-protein interactions were predicted through an integrative probabilistic approach combining multiple lines of evidence. Our method integrated many features, trained prediction models using different classifiers, and then combined their results to obtain the final prediction. Cross-validation and independent evaluation showed that our predictions were significantly enriched for true protein-protein interactions. The prediction model consisted of two stages. In the first stage, both a decision tree (C4.5) and Naive Bayes models were trained separately using the attributes described below. Each of the two methods assigned a numeric value between 0 and 1 to each pair of proteins, representing the probability that the pair has an interaction. The two probabilities were then combined in a logistic regression model. Probabilities reported by the logistic regression model were taken to be the final probability representing the possibility that a protein pair is a true interaction. We predicted protein interactions for pairs with probabilities greater than 0.95 and removed proteins having more than 80 predictions to obtain a final set of reasonable size. The final set of predictions contained 24,798 interactions covering 4,702 fly proteins with an average distance of 4.15 links between proteins. Attributes used in training and prediction. The following attributes were used in training and interaction prediction:
