Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection causes watery diarrhea, dehydration, and high mortality in neonatal pigs, due to its clinical pathogenesis of the intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction. e host's innate immune system is the first line of defence upon virus invasion of the small intestinal epithelial cells. In turn, the virus has evolved to modulate the host's innate immunity during infection, resulting in pathogen virulence, survival, and the establishment of successful infection. In this review, we gather current knowledge concerning the interplay between PEDV and components of host innate immunity, focusing on the role of cytokines and interferons in intestinal antiviral innate immunity, and the mechanisms underlying the immune evasion strategies of PEDV invasion. Finally, we provide some perspectives on the potential prevention and treatment for PEDV infection. As a swine enteric coronavirus, PEDV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus [8] . e PEDV genome of 28.5 kb is polycistronic and consists of ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF3, spike protein, envelope protein, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid protein [9] .
