Background: A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 which have caused more 24 than 80 thousand persons infected globally is still ongoing. This study aims to calculate its 25 case fatality rate (CFR). 26 The method, termed as converged CFR calculation, was based on the formula of 27 dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases T days before, where 28 T was an average time period from case confirmation to death. It was found that supposing a 29 T, if it was smaller (bigger) than the true T, calculated CFRs would gradually increase 30 (decrease) to infinitely near the true T with time went on. According to the law, the true T 31 value could be determined by trends of daily CFRs calculated with different assumed T values 32 (left of true T is decreasing, right is increasing). Then the CFR could be calculated. 33
