Template Assembly: All DNA oligonucleotides utilized in this work were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies. The plasmid constructs for target reporter expression were designed utilizing a NUPACK script (SI Note 1). Inverse PCR was then employed to clone desired target reporter cassette constructs into a low copy p15A backbone. Assembly reactions were transformed into NEB® Turbo Competent E. coli, colonies isolated, and sequence confirmed (Quintara Biosciences). A table of all DNA sequences used in this work can be found below in SI Table 1 . Chi6 DNA stocks for cell free gene expression reactions were assembled by annealing complimentary oligonucleotides (Chi6 and Chi6-complement, SI Table 1 ) on a thermocycler programed to begin at 95ᵒC and drop stepwise to 25ᵒC at a rate of -0.1ᵒC/s throughout 3 minutes.
