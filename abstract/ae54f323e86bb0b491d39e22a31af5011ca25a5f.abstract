Since the ancient times, natural products have served as a major source of drugs. About fifty percent of today's pharmaceutical drugs are derived from natural origin. Interest in natural products as a source of new drugs is growing due to many factors that will be discussed i n this article. Viruse s have been resistant to therapy or prophylaxis longer than any other form of life. Currently, there are only few drugs available for the cure of viral diseases including acyclovir which is modeled on a natural product parent. In order to combat viruses which have devastating effects o n humans, animals, insects, crop plants, fungi and bacteria, many research efforts have been devoted for the discovery of new antiviral natural products. Recen t analysis of the number and sources of antiviral agents reported mainly in the annual reports of medicinal chemistry fro m 198 4 to 199 5 indicated that seven out often syntheti c agents approved by FDA between 1983-1994 , are modeled on a natural product parent. I t has been estimated that only 5-15% of the approximately 250,000 species of higher plants have been systematically investigated for the presence of bioactive compounds while the potential of the marine environment has barely been tapped. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the central role of natura l product s i n the discover y an d development o f ne w antiviral drug s by displaying 340 structures of plant, marine and microbial origin that show promising in vitro antiviral activity.
