A novel natural rubber/silica (NR/SiO 2 ) nanocomposite is developed by combining self-assembly and latex-compounding techniques. The results show that the SiO 2 nanoparticles are homogenously distributed throughout NR matrix as nano-clusters with an average size ranged from 60 to 150 nm when the SiO 2 loading is less than 6.5 wt%. At low SiO 2 contents (64.0 wt%), the NR latex (NRL) and SiO 2 particles are assembled as a core-shell structure by employing poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) as an inter-medium, and only primary aggregations of SiO 2 are observed. When more SiO 2 is loaded, secondary aggregations of SiO 2 nanoparticles are gradually generated, and the size of SiO 2 cluster dramatically increases. The thermal/thermooxidative resistance and mechanical properties of NR/SiO 2 nanocomposites are compared to the NR host. The nanocomposites, particularly when the SiO 2 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed, possess significantly enhanced thermal resistance and mechanical properties, which are strongly depended on the morphology of nanocomposites. The NR/SiO 2 has great potential to manufacture medical protective products with high performances.
