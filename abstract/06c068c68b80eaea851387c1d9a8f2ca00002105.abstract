We have employed NMR to investigate the structure of SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein dimer. We found that the secondary structure of the dimerization domain consists of five a helices and a b-hairpin. The dimer interface consists of a continuous four-stranded b-sheet superposed by two long a helices, reminiscent of that found in the nucleocapsid protein of porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus. Extensive hydrogen bond formation between the two hairpins and hydrophobic interactions between the b-sheet and the a helices render the interface highly stable. Sequence alignment suggests that other coronavirus may share the same structural topology.
