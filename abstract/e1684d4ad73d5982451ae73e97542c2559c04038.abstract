The intracellular bacterial pathogen, Chlamydia trachomatis, is a tryptophan auxotroph. Therefore, induction of the host tryptophan catabolizing enzyme, indoleamine-2,3-dioxgenase-1 (IDO1), by interferon gamma (IFNγ) is one of the primary protective responses against chlamydial infection. However, despite the presence of a robust IFNγ response, active and replicating C. trachomatis can be detected in cervical secretions of women. We hypothesized that a primary C. trachomatis infection may evade the IFNγ response, and that the protective effect of this cytokine results from its activation of tryptophan catabolism in bystander cells. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel method to separate a pool of cells exposed to C. trachomatis into pure populations of live infected and bystander cells and applied this technique to distinguish between the effects of IFNγ on infected and bystander cells. Our findings revealed that the protective induction of IDO1 is suppressed specifically within primary infected cells because Chlamydia attenuates the nuclear import of activated STAT1 following IFNγ exposure, without affecting STAT1 levels or phosphorylation. Critically, the IFNγ-mediated induction of IDO1 activity is unhindered in bystander cells. Therefore, the IDO1-mediated tryptophan catabolism is functional in these cells, transforming these bystander cells into inhospitable hosts for a secondary C. trachomatis infection. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen, causing a myriad of diseases that can impinge severely on female fertility and the health of neonates. Under permissive physiological conditions, these obligate intracellular bacteria can invade, replicate, and establish long-term infections in the columnar epithelium of the urogenital tract, indicating their capacity to evade host immune responses. C. trachomatis has evolved many evasive strategies to promote its long-term survival within its human host. These include inhibition of apoptosis 1-3 , modulation of NFκB signaling 4,5 , downmodulation of CD1d 6 , and inhibition of transcription factors necessary for the expression of MHC classes I and II 7,8 . Evidence from multiple animal studies indicates that a major host defense against C. trachomatis is mediated by IFNγ that is secreted by NK cells and T cells in the infected microenvironment 9-13 . IFNγ induces the expression of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), an enzyme that catabolizes tryptophan to kynurenine 14,15 . By depleting tryptophan, IDO1 activation curtails the growth of C. trachomatis, which is a tryptophan auxotroph 16 . Under conditions of limited tryptophan availability, the chlamydial life-cycle deviates from normal development to form an aberrant, viable but non-cultivable, growth form termed persistence 17,18 . Renewal of tryptophan availability can reactivate persistent forms to return to normal development 19 . However, when initial levels of tryptophan are already limiting, IFNγ exposure can block all development, including the onset of persistence 20 . Curiously, although IFNγ inhibits the growth of C. trachomatis in cells that are pre-depleted of tryptophan in vitro, the developmental cycle of C. trachomatis serovar D exhibits a moderate resistance to the effects of IFNγ
