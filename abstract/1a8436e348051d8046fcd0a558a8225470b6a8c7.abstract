The uncontrolled progression of the aids epidemic has made the development of an efficacious human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine a major objective of scientific research. No effective preventive vaccine against HIV is currently available and sterilizing immunity has not yet been achieved in animal models. This review analyses the major challenges in developing an aids vaccine, in particular the mechanisms involved in viral escape from the immune response, and summarizes the results obtained with the different prototypes of therapeutic and preventive vaccines. Finally, social, economic and healthcare aspects of research into HIV vaccines and current controversies regarding the development of clinical trials are discussed.
