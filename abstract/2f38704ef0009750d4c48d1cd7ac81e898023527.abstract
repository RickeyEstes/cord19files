Background: Inhibitor of kappa kinase 2 (IKK2) deficiency is a recently described combined immunodeficiency. It undermines the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB) activation pathway. The clinical and immunological data of four patients diagnosed with combined immunodeficiency (CID) from two related Saudi families were collected. Autozygosity mapping of all available members and whole exome sequencing of the index case were performed to define the genetic etiology.
