Shigellosis is an acute invasive disease of the lower intestine, which afflicts millions of people worldwide with an estimated one million fatalities per annum. Despite of extensive research during the last two decades, a vaccine against multi-drug resistant Shigella is not yet available in the market. To provide a safe, effective and broad-spectrum vaccine against Shigella, we explored food grade bacteria Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) for the delivery of conserved antigenic protein; Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) to the mucosal sites for effective elicitation of systemic and mucosal immunity. We have previously confirmed the immunogenic potential of recombinant L. lactis expressing OmpA (LacVax Ò OmpA) in BALB/c mice. In the present study, we have characterized the humoral and cellular immune profile of LacVax Ò OmpA and assessed its protective efficacy using a newly developed human like murine shigellosis model. The significant increase in OmpA specific serum IgG, fecal sIgA and a Th1 dominant immune response (indicated by high INF-c/IL-4 ratio) in LacVax Ò OmpA immunized mice revealed successful activation of humoral and cellular immunity. The LacVax Ò OmpA immunized animals were also protected from human-like shigellosis when challenged with S. flexneri 2a ATCC 12022. The antigen specific serum IgG, fecal sIgA, INF-c and IL-10 levels were found to be the significant correlates of protection. Collectively these results suggest that the LacVax Ò OmpA is a promising prophylactic candidate against shigellosis. However, the protective efficacy of LacVax Ò OmpA in the higher animals would further strengthen its future application in humans.
