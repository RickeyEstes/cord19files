Complementing our previous introduction of human neutrophils as APCs in allergic LPR, the results presented here provide insights in their mechanisms of T-cell activation. Our findings indicate that neutrophils fully activate T cells by costimulation of CD2 with CD58 and promote T-cell-mediated inflammation. We conclude that neutrophils, which are recruited in high numbers to inflammatory sites, also contribute to allergic inflammatory diseases through the activation of allergen-specific T cells.
