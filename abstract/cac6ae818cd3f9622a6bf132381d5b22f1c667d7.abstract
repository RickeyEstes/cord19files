Aktract: Two sponges from the Phih'ppines, one a Xestospongia sp. (Hapluscledda, Petr~iidae) and the other e~ unidentified hapiosclerid sponge, both contained the unusual steroidal sulfamate esters, haplosamates A (I) end B (2), the structures of which were determined by interpretation of spectral data= Haplusamates A (1) and B (2) inhibit HIV-I integruse with ICso's of 50pg/mL and 15pg/mL, respectively. A recent review of sulfated compounds from marine organisms recorded about 100 sulfates from sponges, 35 of which were sterol sulfates) Sponges of the family Petrosiidae are known to contain a variety of sterols, notably petrosterol from Petrosiaficiformis, 2 weinbersterol disulfates A and B and orthoesterol disulfates A, B and C from Petrosia weinbergi, 3'4 contignasterol from Petrosia contignata, ~ and the aragusterols from Xestospongia sp. ~ Of these, the cfisulfates from P. weinbergi showed in vitro activity against feline leukemia virus, mouse influenza virus, mouse coronavirus and HIV. Although sulfated sterols have gained a reputation as "nuisance compounds", due largely to the broad spectrum of biological activity associated with more common sulfates such as halistanol sulfate, 7 we believe that they may represent an opportunity for drug discovery. As part of an ongoing investigation to isolate biologically active marine metabolites, we found that methanolic extracts of two sponges from the Philippines, aXestospongia sp. (Haplosclerida, Petrosiidae) and an unidentified haplosclerid sponge, displayed mild in vitro activity against prostrate, human colon, colon carcinoma and mouse lung carcinoma. In this paper we report the isolation and structure elucidation of haplosamates A (1) and B (2), which were obtained from both sponges. These compounds represent the first examples of marine sterols with the sulfamate functionality and an unprecedented six-membered ether ring.
