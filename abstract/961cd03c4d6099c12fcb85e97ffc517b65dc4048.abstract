KEYWORDS Necrotizing enterocolitis Neonate Bacteria Virus Fungi Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common cause of gastrointestinal morbidity and mortality in premature infants. The exact role of microbes in the pathogenesis of NEC is still incompletely understood. The presence of specific bacteria, viruses, and fungi has been associated with NEC predominantly in relatively rare outbreak situations. Aberrant bacterial colonization seems necessary for NEC development but is unlikely to cause disease by itself. Future studies are needed to determine how therapeutic interventions on microbial communities may prevent the development of NEC. Clin Perinatol 42 (2015) 133-154 http://dx.
