Viruses are intracellular parasites that ensure their existence by converting host cells into viral particle producing entities or into hiding places rendering the virus invisible to the host immune system. Some viruses may also survive by transforming the infected cell into an immortal tumour cell. MicroRNAs are small non-coding transcripts that function as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. Viruses encode miRNAs that regulate expression of both cellular and viral genes, and contribute to the pathogenic properties of viruses. Hence, neutralizing the action of viral miRNAs expression by complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides or so-called anti-miRNAs may represent a strategy to combat viral infections and viral-induced pathogenesis. This review describes the miRNAs encoded by human viruses, and discusses the possible therapeutic applications of anti-miRNAs against viral diseases. MiRNAs are noncoding small RNA molecules that act as posttranscriptional regulators. They seem to be an inherent part of the genomes of most living organisms as they have been described in plants, unicellular and lower invertebrates, all vertebrates, and in viruses. Their exact functions start to emerge and include control of cellular processes such as differentiation, morphogenesis, organogenesis, and metabolism [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . MiRNAs are typically generated by RNA polymerase II. The primary transcript (pri-miRNA) is processed by the RNase III enzyme Drosha, in concert with double-stranded (ds) RNA-binding protein DGCR8 into a âˆ¼60 pre-miRNA hairpin. This nuclear pre-miRNA is then transported into the cytoplasma by exportin 5/Ran-GTP and cleaved by the cytoplasmic RNase III Dicer to generate an imperfect ds RNA of 21-25 nucleotides. One of the strands, the mature miRNA strand or guide strand, is loaded in the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC), and directs RISC to the target mRNA, where the complex hybridizes to (partially) complementary sequences resulting in cleavage or translational inhibition of the target mRNA. The unincorporated strand, called the passenger strand, is degraded. The seed region, which encompasses nucleotides 2 to 8 of the 5' ends of miRNA, plays a pivotal role in target selection by RISC-bound miRNA (for recent reviews see [23] [24] [25] ). In animals, mature miRNAs do not require complete complementarity to their target mRNAs, enabling them to bind to and prevent translation of several mRNAs. Experimental evidence suggests that a single miRNA can potentially target as many as 200 different mRNAs [26] [27] [28] . As such, miRNAs have merged as pivotal posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes and aberrant expression can contribute to diseases ([28] and references therein).
