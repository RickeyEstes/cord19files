The spread of infectious diseases has become a global health concern. In order to diagnose infectious diseases quickly and accurately, next-generation DNA sequencing techniques for genetic analysis of infectious viruses have been developed rapidly. However, it takes a very long time to pretreat clinical samples for genetic analysis using next-generation sequencers. We have therefore developed a microfluidic chromatography chip that can purify and enrich viruses in a sample using hydroxyapatite particles packed in a micro-column. We demonstrated the purification of virus from a mixture of virus and FBS protein, and enrichment of the virus using this novel microfluidic chip. . His current research projects are to understand molecular mechanism of virus pathogenesis, especially influenza viruses, and metagenomic analysis of viral infections in humans. Arai is Professor at the Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University, Japan. He is mainly engaging in the research fields of micro-and nano-robotics and its application to the micro-and nano-assembly and cell manipulation, bioautomation systems, medical robotic systems, micro-and nano-electro mechanical systems, intelligent robotic systems.
