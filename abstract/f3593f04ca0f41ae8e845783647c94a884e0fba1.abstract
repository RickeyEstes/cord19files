Testing the repatriated for SARS-Cov2: Should laboratory-based quarantine replace traditional quarantine?, Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease (2020), doi: https://doi. We tested 337 passengers at day 0 and day 5. All the tests for SARS-CoV2 were negative. By optimising the sampling process, sending samples sequentially and reducing the time-scale for biological analysis, we were able to test the samples within five hours (including sampling, shipment and biological tests). Optimising our procedures reduces anxiety and reassures the population and decision makers.
