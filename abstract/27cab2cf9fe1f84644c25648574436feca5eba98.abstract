Azidation (TMSN 3 , SnCl 4 ) of a 9:1 mixture of transand cis-5-acetoxy-2-methylisoxazolidin-3-yl-3phosphonates at the anomeric carbon atom led to the formation of the equimolar mixture of cisand trans-5-azido-2-methylisoxazolidin-3-yl-3-phosphonates, which were efficiently separated. The 1,3dipolar cycloaddition of pure transand cis-5-azidoisoxazolidin-3-yl-3-phosphonates with selected alkynes gave the respective nucleoside mimetics containing a 1,2,3-triazole linker. The (1,2,3-triazolyl) isoxazolidine phosphonates obtained herein were evaluated in vitro for activity against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses. None of the compounds were endowed with antiviral activity at subtoxic concentrations. Compounds 15fej and 16fej were cytostatic in the higher micromolar range.
