Stress and immunosuppression are often underlying factors for many diseases affecting captive crocodilians. Stress has been defined as "a physiological answer to a perceived threat that includes, but is not restricted to, increased adrenal secretion." 1 Stress is also thought of as any event that challenges homeostasis, and likely the response to that challenge involves more than an adrenal response. The autonomic nervous system, the hypothalamic adrenal axis, neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, and neuroimmunologic mediators all have a role in the response of the immune system to stress. 2 Studies in crocodilians have evaluated the stress associated with restraint, long-term corticosterone implants, cold shock, and stocking densities. 3-6 Lance et al. provide an overview of the physiology and endocrinology of stress in crocodilians. 7 Catecholamines, glucocorticoids, glucose, and lactate have been implicated in the stress response of crocodilians. In addition, an argument is made for immunosuppression on the basis of changes observed in the white blood cells. [3] [4] [5] 7 Factors that influence stress in crocodilian and reptile species are reviewed by Rooney and Guillette. 1 Enough evidence exists to suggest that stress plays an important role in the physiology of crocodilians, and it may indeed predispose them to illness. Overcrowding, handling, excessive noise, diet changes, water and air quality, temperature irregularities, and more should all be considered as predisposing or confounding factors of disease.
