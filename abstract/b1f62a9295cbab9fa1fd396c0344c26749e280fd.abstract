To halt the global tuberculosis epidemic, transmission must be stopped to prevent new infections and new cases. Identifi cation of individuals with tuberculosis and prompt initiation of eff ective treatment to rapidly render them non-infectious is crucial to this task. However, in settings of high tuberculosis burden, active case-fi nding is often not implemented, resulting in long delays in diagnosis and treatment. A range of strategies to fi nd cases and ensure prompt and correct treatment have been shown to be eff ective in high tuberculosis-burden settings. The populationlevel eff ect of targeted active case-fi nding on reducing tuberculosis incidence has been shown by studies and projected by mathematical modelling. The inclusion of targeted active case-fi nding in a comprehensive epidemic-control strategy for tuberculosis should contribute substantially to a decrease in tuberculosis incidence.
