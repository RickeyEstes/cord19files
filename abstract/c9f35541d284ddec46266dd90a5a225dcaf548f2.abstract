Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) Peri-engraftment respiratory distress syndrome (PERDS) Acute lung injury remains a major cause of early post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) nonrelapse mortality. Pulmonary function testing results before transplant may help to identify a group of patients at high risk for post-HSCT respiratory failure and death. Early enthusiasm for treatment of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome with etanercept has been dampened by results of recent studies in adult HSCT recipients.
