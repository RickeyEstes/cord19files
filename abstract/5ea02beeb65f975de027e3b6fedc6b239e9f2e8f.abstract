siRNA-aptamer chimeras have emerged as one of the most promising approaches for targeted delivery of siRNA due to the modularity of their diblock RNA structure, relatively lower cost over other targeted delivery approaches, and, most importantly, the outstanding potential for clinical translation. However, additional challenges must be addressed for efficient RNA interference (RNAi), in particular, endosomal escape. Currently, vast majority of siRNA delivery vehicles are based on cationic materials, which form complexes with negatively charged siRNA. Unfortunately, these approaches complicate the formulations again by forming large complexes with heterogeneous sizes, unfavorable surface charges, colloidal instability, and poor targeting ligand orientation. Here, we report the development of a small and simple protein tag that complements the therapeutic and targeting functionalities of chimera with two functional domains: a dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD) for siRNA docking and a pH-dependent polyhistidine to disrupt endosomal membrane. The protein selectively tags along the siRNA block of individual chimera, rendering the overall size of the complex small, desirable for deep tissue penetration, and the aptamer block accessible for target recognition. More interestingly, we found that extending the c-terminal polyhistidine segment in the protein tag to 18 amino acids completely abolishes the RNA binding function of dsRBD. s iRNA is of considerable current interest because it can elicit potent, target-specific knockdown of virtually any mRNA, creating new opportunities for personalized medicine and for addressing a broad range of traditionally undruggable disease targets using small molecules 1-3 . Similar to other antisense approaches, however, cell-specific delivery of siRNA technology in vivo still represents a major technical hurdle 4 . To guide siRNA to diseased cells, targeting ligands such as small molecules, lipids, peptides, and proteins have been identified and linked directly to siRNA or on the surface of siRNA nanocarriers 5-10 . Considering the complex physical and chemical structures of various formulations, the siRNA-targeting ligand-delivery vehicle complexes face difficulty in large-scale production and regulatory approval for clinical uses. Recently, siRNA-aptamer chimera, employing only RNA molecules, has emerged as a highly promising approach for cell type-specific RNAi, owing to its low immunogenicity, ease of chemical synthesis and modification, small size, and the targeting specificity of aptamers. RNA-based aptamers are identified through in vitro enrichment known as SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) 11-14 . Similar to antibodies, they are capable of binding to various molecular targets including small molecules, proteins, and cells, while offering key advantages as they can be completely identified and produced with desired chemical modifications in vitro through automated processes. For aptamer-guided siRNA delivery, exciting works by McNamara, Dassie, and coworkers show that chimeras composed of aptamer targeting prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and siRNA targeting anti-apoptotic genes (Plk1) have been made and optimized 15,16 . The aptamer block recognizes PSMA on prostate tumor cell surface and leads to chimera cell internalization, whereas the siRNA block enzymatically cleaved from the chimera promotes cell death. Significantly reduced tumor mass was observed in mouse xenograft models of prostate tumor after administration of the chimera, though the exact mechanism of chimera endosomal escape remains unclear 17 . This limitation helps explain why high concentrations of chimera were required in these pioneer studies to treat prostate tumors 15, 16 . An obvious solution to this problem is to combine chimeras with nanocarriers with endosome rupturing capabilities. Common delivery vehicles include lipids, polymers, and inorganic nanoparticles such as gold, silica, magnetic, and semiconductor nanoparticles [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . For siRNA immobilization, condensation, stabilization against enzymatic degradation, and endosomal escape, virtually all these nanocarriers are positively charged, and so are their siRNA complexes. Unfortunately, the electrostatically induced nanocarrier-chimera condensation almost completely defies the purpose of simple formulation for siRNA clinical translation because the final nanoparticles become complex again, with mixed sizes, surface properties, aptamer conformations and orientations, and batchto-batch variations.
