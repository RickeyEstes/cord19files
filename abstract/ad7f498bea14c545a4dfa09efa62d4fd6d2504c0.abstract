Studies support the efficacy of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a therapeutic for alcoholic liver disease, however the molecular mechanisms that govern SAM-associated protection are not known. Data presented herein suggest that the beneficial effects of SAM in treating alcohol hepatotoxicity are mediated via mitochondrial pathways. For these studies, mitochondria respiration and superoxide production were measured in liver mitochondria from rats fed control and ethanol diets with and without SAM (0.8 mg/mL diet) for 5 wks. Superoxide production was determined using the coelenterazine assay and mtDNA damage was assessed using QPCR. Chronic ethanol feeding caused a significant decrease in State 3 respiration and RCRs. SAM supplementation prevented these ethanol-mediated defects as State 3 respiration was preserved in ethanol-fed animals coadministered SAM. Chronic alcohol consumption induced a 30-50% increase in the level of mitochondrial superoxide production as compared to control levels. In contrast, levels of superoxide were largely unchanged in liver mitochondria from ethanol-fed animals co-administered SAM as compared to controls. Immunoblot analysis indicated a 70% decrease in the level of the mitochondrial encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit I protein in mitochondria from ethanol-fed rats versus controls, which was largely attenuated by co-administration of SAM. Ethanolassociated mtDNA damage was also prevented by SAM treatment. These results demonstrate for the first time that SAM prevents changes to the mitochondria genome and proteome induced by chronic ethanol. These results lay the ground work to identify mechanisms that link SAM-mediated protection to the effects of oxidative and nitrosative stress on mitochondrial function in response to chronic ethanol. The lives of more than 600,000 Americans and 50,000 Canadians are threatened each year by stroke. Up to 50% are hyperglycemic at the time of their stroke, which results in accelerated neurological damage. Increased free radical production is believed to play a major role in the early damage associated with stroke. We believe that superoxide radicals are produced in excess in hyperglycemic cerebral ischemia. We have investigated the hypothesis that dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), a superoxide scavenger, reduces neurological damage. Using a three vessel occlusion model of cerebral ischemia in the rat under normo-and acute hyperglycemic conditions, we have evaluated manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and copper/zinc (CuZnSOD) gene and protein expression 3 hours post-ischemia. Tissue samples for analysis by RT-PCR and Western blot were taken from the ischemic cortex, as well as corresponding sites from sham operated animals treated with DHA. Our results show that SODs protein expression is exacerbated in hyperglycemic cerebral ischemia compared to normoglycemic conditions and this increase is normalized by DHA. The latter also decreases edema formation (associated with hyperglycemia and superoxide production) and the zone at risk for infarction as determined by TTC staining. In conclusion, hyperglycemia during stroke is associated with an early induction of SODs and pretreatment with DHA delays infarction and normalizes SODs expression. 1 research centre on aging. IUGSherbrooke. Canada HDL plays an important role in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). During ageing, several changes in the HDL may occur and then affect their function. Therefore, in this study, we investigate: 1-Whether ageing can affect the ability of HDL, (HDL2 & HDL3) to take up cellular free cholesterol (FC) execs and their susceptibility to oxidation. 2-the role of PON-1 in the RCT. HDL cholesterol efflux was carried out using human THP-1 macrophage incubated for 24h in the presence of: A-Native HDL, HDL-2 or HDL-3; B-Oxidised HDL; C-Oxidised HDL in the presence of PON-1. HDL oxidation was evaluated by measuring CD and MDA formation as well as vitamin E disappearance. SDS-PAGE was used in order to evaluate apoA1 desegregation following oxidation. Our results show that whole HDL and HDL-3 induced mobilisation of cellular FC which was significantly higher in younger than for older subjects (P= 0.0264 (HDL); P= 0.0123 (HDL-3); respectively). In the younger patients, FC effluxing capacity was more important for HDL3 than HDL2 (P=0.0186). Oxidation of HDL induces an increase in the CD, MDA production and the rate of vit-E disappearance. These HDL oxidation markers were higher in elderly than in young subjects. Significant negative correlation was observed between oxidised HDL and cholesterol efflux (CE) from THP-1 (P<0.001). However, at the same level of oxidation, mean (CE) was significantly higher with oxidised-HDL from young than from elderly subjects (P<0.05). The decrease of CE from macrophage with oxidised-HDL was abolished in the presence of increased concentrations of PON-1. Our data indicate that ageing affect negatively the ability of HDL to mobilise free cholesterol from cells and that PON-1 protecting HDL towards oxidation may restore or enhance RCT. The transport and intracellular accumulation of ascorbic acid is achieved by the Na + dependent ascorbic acid transporters, SVCT1 and SVCT2. In addition, the oxidized form of vitamin C, Dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) is transported into cells by the facilitative glucose transporters, GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4. Once inside the cell, DHA is rapidly reduced to Ascorbic acid by both enzymatic and non-enzymatic means. Despite a wealth of data concerning vitamin C's transport mechanisms, it is still unclear whether its intracellular accumulation is mediated by SVCTs or GLUTs, or, depending on S F R B M 2 0 0 4 S33 available substrate, a mixture of the two. To solve this issue we have synthesized an analog to ascorbic acid, namely 6, Bromo ascorbic acid, which we hypothesize will be a substrate for SVCTs, but not GLUTs. To test this hypothesis we first compared the redox properties of the analog with ascorbic acid: analog was oxidizable and reducible, similar to ascorbic acid. Thereafter, the transport specificities of the oxidized and reduced forms of the analog were determined using Xenopus oocytes expressing SVCTs or GLUTs. 6,Bromo ascorbic acid was completely specific for SVCT1 and SVCT2, whereas 6,Bromo dehydroascorbic acid was not transported by the SVCT or GLUT transporter family. These data represent the first full characterization of an alternative substrate for the SVCTs, and indicate halo ascorbic acid analogs are ideal compounds to determine ascorbates transport pathways and function in vivo. There has been mounting evidence that estrogens exert positive effects in part by suppressing neurotoxic stimuli via their direct radical-scavenging antioxidant activity. We have found that the 17(β)-butyl ether of estradiol (17Bu-E2) manifested reduced affinity to estrogen receptors but, nevertheless, was a more powerful neuroprotectant than E2 against glutamate induced neurotoxicity in cultured hippocampus derived (HT-22) cells. When capturing the most harmful ROS (hydroxyl radical, OH•), the phenolic A-ring of 17Bu-E2 was shown to be converted to a non-aromatic para-quinol structure, which was expected to render
