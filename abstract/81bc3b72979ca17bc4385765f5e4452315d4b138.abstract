In a recent article for Critical Care, Bermejo-Martin and colleagues [1] describe Th 1 and Th 17 hypercytokinemia as an early signatur e host response to severe infection by the pandemic variant of the infl uenza virus (nvH1N1). Th e nvH1N1 infection is usually self-limiting in nature, but some patients develop severe symptoms requiring hospitalization [2] . Th e host immune response may play an important role in poor outcomes after infection. Th e human host immune response to nvH1N1 infection is unknown at this time and studies on its contribution to disease pathogenesis are desperately needed to improve prevention and treatment strategies.
