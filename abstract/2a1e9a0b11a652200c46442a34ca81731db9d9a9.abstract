Five new steroid sulfates, sodium 2␤,3␣-dihydroxy-5␣-cholestane 3-sulfate (6), sodium 2␤,3␣-dihydroxy-5␣-cholestane 2-sulfate (7), disodium 2␤,3␣-dihydroxy-5␣-cholestane disulfate (8), sodium 3␣-acetoxy-2␤-hydroxy-5␣-cholestane 2-sulfate (12), and sodium 2␤-acetoxy-3␣-hydroxy-5␣-cholestane 3-sulfate (13), have been synthesized starting from 3␤-hydroxy-5␣-cholestane (1). The synthetic steroids were completely characterized by one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR and FABMS spectra. Sulfation was performed using triethylamine-sulfur trioxide complex in dimethylformamide as the sulfating agent. The sulfated steroids were comparatively evaluated for their inhibitory effect on the replication of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Compounds 7 and 8 were the most effective in their inhibitory action against HSV-2. The disulfated steroid 8 also proved to be active against DEN-2 and JV. (M.S. Maier). synthesize disodium 2␤,3␣-dihydroxy-5␣-cholestane (8) disulfate as well as monosulfated and acetylated derivatives of 2␤,3␣-dihydroxy-5␣-cholestane (6, 7, 12, 13) ( Fig. 1 ) in order to evaluate the antiviral activity of these compounds and gain insight into structure-activity correlations.
