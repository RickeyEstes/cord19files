The emergence of a novel, highly pathogenic coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, in China, 24 and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency. Coronaviruses use their spike proteins to select and enter target cells and insights into 26 nCoV-2019 spike (S)-driven entry might facilitate assessment of pandemic potential and 27 reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that 2019-nCoV-S uses the SARS-28 coronavirus receptor, ACE2, for entry and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for 2019-nCoV-29 S priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. 30 Finally, we show that the serum form a convalescent SARS patient neutralized 2019-nCoV-31 S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between 2019-nCoV and 32 SARS-coronavirus infection, which might translate into similar transmissibility and disease 33 pathogenesis. Moreover, they identify a target for antiviral intervention. 34 35 One sentence summary: The novel 2019 coronavirus and the SARS-coronavirus share central 36 biological properties which can guide risk assessment and intervention. 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 author/funder.
