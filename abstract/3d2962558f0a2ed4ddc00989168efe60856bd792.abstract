Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell monolayers in culture tubes were inoculated with 200 µl of the nasal swabs-virus transport medium suspension and the cells were maintained in serum-free minimum essential medium (MEM, Gibco, N.Y., USA) containing tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (2µg/ml) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and incubated at 33 o C for 7 days (MDCK cells).
