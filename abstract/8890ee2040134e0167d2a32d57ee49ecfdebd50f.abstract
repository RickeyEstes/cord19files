When Lydia was about 12 years of age her family moved from the city of London out to a suburb in the nearby county of Kent. Lydia's parents wanted her to go to a particular school that she was not very keen on attending. So, even though her mother was not an animal lover Lydia's mother agreed to allow her to have a pet. Lydia really wanted a dog, but her parents refused this request and agreed that she could have either a cat or rabbit. Lydia ended up with both. During the most difficult times of Lydia's adolescent life she would often sit in her room with her cat, Cleo, or her rabbit, Bonnie, on her lap, petting it, as she listened to music to alleviate her sadness or worries. The above anecdote supports much of the literature regarding what adolescents often say about their pets
