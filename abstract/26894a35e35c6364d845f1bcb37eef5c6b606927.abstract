brane, ligands, and receptors, are either recycled to the cell surface or shuttled to lysosomes via late endosomes for eventual degradation. The lysosomal degradation pathways are shown schematically in Figure 3 . This figure also illustrates the functional relationships between the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membrane and the lysosomes. Nonlysosomal degradation pathways are also present in cells. These pathways differ from the lysosomal pathways in subcellular localization, sensitivity to inhibitors, substrate specificity, pH optima, and physiological functions and are regulated independently. For a discussion of the regulation of nonlysosomal degradation pathways and their participation in cell pathology, see Lee and Marzella (1994) . More than fifty lysosomal enzymes have been identified and have been shown to degrade nearly all biological molecules (proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids) (de Duve, 1983) . Most enzymes are "soluble" or loosely associated with the lysosomal membrane. A few enzymes, such as the membrane-associated form of acid phosphatase, are tightly bound and are considered integral membrane proteins (Himeno et al., 1989) . Within the lysosomal matrix, the lysosomal enzymes may exist as aggregates. This property favors the retention of the lysosomal enzymes within the lysosomal matrix. It is not known whether individual lysosomes contain the full range of degradative enzymes or if variable numbers and types of hydrolases are present in each lysosomal organelle. The turnover rate oflysosomal enzymes is relatively rapid (approximately one to two days) (Burnside and Schneider, 1982) . The half-life of individual lysosomal enzymes varies from 15 hrs to 3 days . Proteins are degraded to the level of constituent amino acids through sequential attack by a variety oflysosomal proteases (see below). The hydrolysis of lipids also takes place in the lysosomal compartment by the action of acid lipases to yield glycerols and fatty acids. Glycolipids, sphingomyelins, and phospholipids are all degraded in lysosomes. The degradation of glycogen can occur in lysosomes by acid a-glucosidases. The degradation of carbohydrate moieties in sugars, proteins, and lipids proceeds by the action of exoenzymes (e.g., glycosidases) giving monosaccharides. In the case of glycoproteins, the peptide backbone is degraded by various lysosomal proteases, followed by the breakdown of glycans. Nucleic acids are first hydrolyzed by an endonuclease, either acid deoxyribonuclease or ribonuclease, into oligonucleotides. Then the oligonucleotides are cleaved by an acid exonuclease to release 3'-phosphomononucleotides and subsequently nucleosides and inorganic phosphates. Breakdown products of lysosomal degradation (amino acids, fatty acids, glycerol, monoacylglycerols, cholesterol, and sugars) return to the cytosol by diffusion/permeation or are transported out of the lysosome by newly discovered specific carriers systems. At least 14 systems active in the transport of
