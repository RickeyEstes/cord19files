Accuracy in translation of the genetic code into proteins depends upon correct tRNA-mRNA recognition in the context of the ribosome. In human tRNA Lys;3 UUU three modified bases are present in the anticodon stem-loop-2-methylthio-N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine at position 37 (ms 2 t 6 A37), 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine at position 34 (mcm 5 s 2 U34) and pseudouridine (c) at position 39-two of which, ms 2 t 6 A37 and mcm 5 s 2 U34, are required to achieve wild-type binding activity of wild-type human tRNA Lys;3 ]. Molecular dynamics simulations of nine tRNA anticodon stem-loops with different combinations of nonstandard bases were performed. The wild-type simulation exhibited a canonical anticodon stairstepped conformation. The ms 2 t 6 modification at position 37 is required for maintenance of this structure and reduces solvent accessibility of U36. Ms 2 t 6 A37 generally hydrogen bonds across the loop and may prevent U36 from rotating into solution. A water molecule does coordinate to c39 most of the simulation time but weakly, as most of the residence lifetimes are ,40 ps.
