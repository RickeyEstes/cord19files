The oligomerization domain of the reovirus cell attachment protein (01) was probed using the type 3 reovirus 01 synthesized in vitro. Trypsin cleaved the al protein (49K molecular weight) approximately in the middle and yielded a 26K N-terminal fragment and a 23K C-terminal fragment. Under conditions which allowed for the identification of intact ~1 in the oligomeric form (-200K) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the N-terminal 26K fragment was found to exist as stable trimers (80K) and, to a less extent, as dimers (54K), whereas the C-terminal fragment remained in the monomeric form. A polypeptide (161 amino acids) containing the N-terminal heptad repeat region synthesized in v&o was capable of forming stable dimers and trimers. Using various criteria, we demonstrated that the stability of the intact al oligomer is conferred mainly by the N-terminal heptad repeat region. Our results are summarized in a model in which individual heptad repeats are held together in a three-stranded a-helical coiled-coil structure via both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. o 1991 Academic PVS, I~C.
