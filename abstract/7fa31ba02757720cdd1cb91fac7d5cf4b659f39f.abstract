Objectives: The exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by a strain of Geobacillus thermodenitrificans and a strain of Bacillus licheniformis were used to evaluate their immunoregulatory and antiviral effects. The two strains were isolated from a shallow marine hot spring of Vulcano Island (Italy). In view of the important regulatory role in antiviral defence played by cytokines modulator factors, we analysed both the effects of EPS of two marine bacteria on cytokine production and the antiviral activity on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Methods: PBMC were obtained from healthy donors, after centrifugation of heparinised venous blood over a Ficoll-Hipaque gradient. Supernatants were harvested and analysed for the presence of IFNc, IFNa, TNFa, IL-12, IL-18, IL-4. In order to establish if the EPS antiviral activity was related either to the marked production of Th1 cytokines or to a direct interaction with virus replication, we used WISH cell line. To evaluate the effects of the on HSV-2 replication in PBMC and WISH cell line, the amounts of virus production were titrated and expressed as PFU/mL. Results: The EPS trigger mononuclear phagocytes in releasing cytokines involved in Th1 profile, such as IL-12, IFNc, IFNa, TNFa, IL-18, whereas did not induce the production of Th2 cytokine (IL-4). Furthermore, treatment of HSV-2 infected PBMC with EPS down-regulated virus replication. This effect on HSV-2 replication seems to be related to the pattern of cytokines induced in PBMC by EPS. The addition of EPS to WISH cells, infected with HSV-2, did not show any antiviral effect. Conclusion: We have shown that the two EPS are powerful stimulators of Th1 cell-mediated immunity. They are immunomodulatory agents which could be potentially used as a therapy in the immunocompromised host.
