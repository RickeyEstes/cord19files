The isotype antibody responses to bovine IND p, G6 and simian SAll P', G3 rotavirus and SAll rotavirus proteins (VP4, VP6 and VP7) in serum, colostrum and milk were analysed by ELBA in three groups of vaccinated cows and nonvaccinated controls. Pregnant cows were vaccinated intramuscularly and intramammarily with recombinant baculovirus-expressed SAll rotavirus VLP (triple-layered virus-like particles containing rotavirus VP2, VP4, VP4 and VP7); CLP (double-layered core-like particles containing rotavirus VP2 and VP6); or inactivated SAll rotavirus, respectively. Rotavirus antigen titers were highest (30-200-fold) in ELISA in the VLP vaccine compared to the inactivated SAll vaccine. The IgGl, IgG2 and IgM geometric mean antibody titers (GMT) to rotavirus (titers to bovine rotavirus vs SAll rotavirus did not d@er signtjicantly for any isotype or group) and the IgG2 GMT to VP6 in serum at calving in the vaccinated groups were significantly (P cO.05) higher than in the control group. In colostrum, IgGl and IgA rotavirus antibody titers were significantly elevated for VLP (IgGl GMT 832225; IgA GMT 16384), CLP (IgGl GMT 660561; IgA GMT 10321) and S ill (IgGl GMT 131072; IgA GMT 1448) vaccinated cows compared to control cows ( igG1 GMT 1158.5; IgA GMT 45). The IgGl and IgA GMT to rotavirus were sign$cantly elevated (6-loo-fold) in milk of VLP and CLP vaccinated cows compared to SAll vaccinated or control cows. The isotype antibody responses to VP6 in serum, colostrum and milk paralleled the responses to rotavirus, but titers were -2--IO-fold lower. Only cows vaccinated with VLP had significantly enhanced serum, colostral and milk antibody titers to rotavirus VP4 and VP7. These results demonstrate that rotavirus antibody titers in serum, colostrum and milk are significantly enhanced by use of non-infectious VLP, CLP and inactivated SAll rotavirus vaccines, but the VLP or CLP vaccines induced the highest antibody responses, corresponding to their higher rotavirus antigen titers measured by ELISA.
