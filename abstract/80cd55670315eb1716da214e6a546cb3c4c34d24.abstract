Proteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are properly folded with the assistance ofER chaperones. Accumulation ofmisfoldedprotein in the ER triggers an adaptive ER stress (ERS) response termed the unfolded protein response. Recent interest has focused on the possibility that the accumulation ofmisfolded proteins can also contribute to reproductive response, including preimplantation embryos, testicular germ cell, placenta, and unexplained intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The major ERS pathway constituents are present at all stages ofpreimplantation development and that the activation of ERS pathways can be induced at the 8-cell, morula and blastocyst stage. This review mainly introduced the research progress ofERS induced apoptosis of reproductive cells, providing a new direction for the research of reproductive disease therapy. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a vital organelle that plays an important role in the regulation of cellular homeostasis and communicationt-". At the same time, the ER is the cellular organelle where proteins and lipids are synthesized and modified. Many protein Correspondingauthor: Hua
