The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the largest intracellular organelle. It forms a complex network of continuous sheets and tubules, extending from the nuclear envelope (NE) to the plasma membrane. This network is frequently perturbed by positive-strand RNA viruses utilizing the ER to create membranous replication factories (RFs), where amplification of their genomes occurs. In addition, many enveloped viruses assemble progeny virions in association with ER membranes, and viruses replicating in the nucleus need to overcome the NE barrier, requiring transient changes of the NE morphology. This review first summarizes some key aspects of ER morphology and then focuses on the exploitation of the ER by viruses for the sake of promoting the different steps of their replication cycles. In the following sections we briefly summarize the morphologies and properties of these ER 44 subdomains. 45 46 Figure 1. Schematic representation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network organization. (A) The 47 ER network comprises the nuclear envelope (NE) and the peripheral ER. The peripheral ER is 48 composed of stacked sheets, studded with ribosomes, and tubules extending the reticular network to 49 the plasma membrane; (B) Schematic of an ER sheet, depicting its multidimensional properties and 50 the ER-shaping proteins that are responsible for the characteristic, flattened morphology. CLIMP63 is 51 a coiled-coil protein forming oligomers bridging across the luminal space of the sheets that are also 52 studded with ribosomes. High membrane curvature at the edges of the sheets is stabilized by 53 reticulon/DP1/Yop1p proteins, forming wedges inside the bilayer and arc-like scaffolds around the 54 edge. Sheets are also connected to neighboring sheets by membranous twists ("Parking garage 55 model", [7]); (C) Schematic of two ER tubules. Reticulon/DP1/Yop1p oligomers might not only 56 determine the size of the sheet edges, but also the diameter of the tubules. These are interconnected 57 through proteins such as atlastins/Sey1p residing at three-way junctions. The models in (B) and (C) are adapted from [8, 9] . Dimensions of ER sheets and tubules refer to those found in mammalian cells. 59 2.1.1. Nuclear Envelope (NE) 60 The nuclear envelope consists of two flat ER membrane bilayers, the inner nuclear membrane 61 (INM) and the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). The NE morphology is maintained via protein 62 linkers within the perinuclear space (PNS), keeping a constant distance of 50 nm between the two 63 membrane layers [10,11]. In addition, interactions of the INM proteins with chromatin and the lamin 64 and of the ONM with nuclear pores and the cytoskeleton (reviewed in [12-14]) are required for the 65 maintenance of the NE structure. This double membrane separates the intranuclear space from the 66 cytoplasmic compartment and is only interrupted by nuclear pores, composed of nuclear pore 67 complexes (NPCs) responsible for nucleocytoplasmic transport. Molecules up to 9 nm in diameter 68 can passively diffuse through their inner channel [15], while molecules up to 39 nm in diameter in 69 most cases require active nuclear import/export. Efficient translocation is carried out by transport 70 receptors (karyopherins) that recognize cargos carrying specific recognition signals: nuclear 71 localization and nuclear export signals (NLS and NES, respectively) [16]. 72 73
