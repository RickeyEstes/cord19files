The first classification of viruses as a group distinct from other microorganisms was based on the capacity to pass through filters of a small pore size (filterable agents). Initial subclassifications were based primarily on pathologic properties such as specific organ tropism (e.g., hepatitis viruses) or common epidemiologic features such as transmission by arthropod vectors (e.g., arboviruses). Current classification systems are based on the following: (1) the type and structure of the viral nucleic acid and the strategy used in its replication; (2) the type Chapter 134 Biology of Viruses and Viral Diseases
