of the two amino-terminal domains of intercellular adhesion molecule-l, the receptor for the major group of human rhinovirus serotypes, diffract to 30 A resolution. The crystals are trigonal in space group P3,21 or P3221 with cell dimensions of a = b = 557 A, c = 166.3 A, with probably six molecules per unit cell.
