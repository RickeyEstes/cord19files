The HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) binds to cell surface-associated receptor (CD4) and coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) by one of its two noncovalently associated subunits, gp120. The induced conformational changes activate the other subunit (gp41), which causes fusion of the viral with the plasma cell membranes resulting in delivery of the viral genome into the cell Prabakaran et al. Liganded gp120 CD4 BS CD4 BS mAbs X5, 17b (CD4i) Unliganded gp120 mAbs X5, 17b (CD4i) B A CD4 FIGURE 4 Molecular surface diagrams of unliganded (A) and liganded (B) gp120 cores are rendered as viewed from the perspective of CD4 receptor binding. The residues in direct contact with CD4 are in blue; residues contacting the CD4i antibodies, namely, 17b and X5 are in red. The contact residues were selected by limiting interatomic distance of 3.8 Ã… between gp120 core to the CD4 and CD4i antibodies. Prabakaran et al.
