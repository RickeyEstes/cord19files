Aims: To better inform medical practitioners on the role of antiseptics in oropharyngeal health and disease, this article focuses on povidone-iodine (PVP-I), an established and widely-available antiseptic agent. Methodology: Review of the anti-infective profile, efficacy and safety of PVP-I in managing common upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold, influenza and tonsillo-pharyngitis, as well as oral complications resulting from cancer treatment (oral mucositis), and dental conditions (periodontitis, caries). Results: Antiseptics with broad-spectrum anti-infective activity and low resistance potential offer an attractive option in both infection control and prevention. While there is some evidence of benefit of antiseptics in a variety of clinical settings that include dental and oral hygiene, dermatology, oncology, and pulmonology, there appears to be discordance between the evidence-base and practice. This is especially apparent in the management and prevention of oropharyngeal infections, for which the use of antiseptics varies considerably between clinical practices, and is in marked contrast to their dermal application, where they are extensively used as both a prophylaxis and a treatment of skin and wound infections, thus minimising the use of antibiotics. Conclusion: The link between oral and oropharyngeal health status and susceptibility to infection has long been recognised. The high rates of antibiotic misuse and subsequent development of bacterial resistance (e.g. increasing vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)) in large parts of the world, especially across Asia Pacific, highlight the need for identifying alternative antimicrobials that would minimise the use of these medications. This, together with recent large-scale outbreaks of, for example, avian and swine influenza virus, further underline the importance of an increasing armamentarium for infection prevention and control. Data were collected through PubMed using specified search criteria based on efficacy, safety and microbicidal activity of PVP-I. Other health-based search engines that included the Cochrane Library were also used to search for reviews on antiseptic use in defined clinical settings. General searches using Google for non-English articles on PVP-I were also conducted. Expert opinion was sought in areas of limited published information such as optimal duration of PVP-I treatment. While the current evidence-base for antiseptic use in the oropharyngeal setting per se is limited compared with other settings, studies of PVP-I demonstrated effectiveness against a broad spectrum of common mouth and throat pathogens and minimised the risk of upper respiratory tract infections, certain dental conditions, and severity of cancer therapy-associated oral complications. Use of PVP-I may thereby assist in the rationalisation of antibiotic prescription. Âª
