Basic reproduction number (R 0 ): expected number of secondary cases caused by a single infectious individual in a fully susceptible population. Critical community size (CCS): host population size below which a disease cannot persist in the long term. Effective reproductive number: expected number of secondary cases caused by each infectious individual in a partially immune population. Endemic: an infection is endemic in a population when it is maintained without the need for external introductions. Force of infection: hazard rate of infection from a defined source to susceptible host individuals in a defined population. Incidence: number of new cases in a particular time interval. Maintenance community: any set of connected host (sub)populations that together can maintain a pathogen over the long term. A minimal maintenance community is a maintenance community of which all subsets are nonmaintenance. Trivially, a maintenance population is also a (minimal) maintenance community. Maintenance population: single host population capable of maintaining a pathogen over the long term. Metapopulation: set of populations that are connected by transmission. It can comprise structured populations of the same species (e.g., in space), populations of different species, or a combination thereof. Patch value: measure of the contribution of individual populations to the reservoir capacity of a metapopulation. Prevalence: proportion of positive cases in a population at a particular time point. Reservoir capacity: measure of the potential of a host metapopulation to support long-term pathogen persistence in the absence of external imports. Reservoir of infection: one or more epidemiologically connected populations or environments in which a pathogen can be permanently maintained and from which infection is transmitted to the target population. Stuttering chain: pattern of cases in the form of short chains when transmission among hosts occurs but is too weak to support endemic or epidemic transmission. 0169-5347/ ÃŸ
