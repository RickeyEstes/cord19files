If the fluid is clear initially and then turns red, iatrogenic blood contamination is likely. Conversely, if a sample is red throughout collection, a hemorrhagic fluid should be suspected. The fluid should be collected into both a lavender-top tube (EDTA anticoagulant) for evaluation of nucleated cells and 6 of the near colorless effusions depends on the etiology. Mild increases of cells and/or protein related to increased hydrostatic pressure (modified transudate) often result from chronic transudation of fluid or passage across a membrane. Exudation of significant numbers of neutrophils and/or macrophages from injured lymphatic and blood vessels (exudate) results from infectious or noninfectious etiologies. Colored effusions are distinctive forms of exudation. (Modified from Meyer DJ, Harvey JW: Veterinary laboratory medicine-interpretation and diagnosis, ed 3, Elsevier, St Louis, 2004.) KEY POINT Do not use gel-containing serum separator tubes for submission of fluid to a reference laboratory. Cells may bind to the gel in these tubes and result in an artifactual low cell count.
