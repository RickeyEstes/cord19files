he past several years have seen an enormous proliferation of the literature of multiple sclerosis, reflecting intensive research activity in numerous areas. Much of it has recently been reviewed in great detail elsewhere 35 and can only be summarized here. Virology, immunology, epidemiology, genetics, neurophysiology, and radiology have all contributed new information. Unfortunately much of it has been contradictory and controversial. The results of some of the newer diagnostic techniques are forcing a re-examination of long held ideas regarding the natural history of the disease and its pathogenesis. Two major hypotheses regarding etiology and pathogenesis continue to dominate research in multiple sclerosis: the search for a single, specific causative viral agent with prolonged latency, and the discovery of an altered immunologic status, based upon the animal model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. In spite of very large amounts of time and money spent on these endeavors, knowledge of the etiology and the exact pathogenesis of the disease still eludes us. No reliable laboratory test for the diagnosis or for the measurement of the activity of the disease has become available. Because of these factors, therapeutic regimens, many of which reflect a rather naive understanding of the natural history and pathology of multiple sclerosis have been proposed in support of a particular hypothesis, ranging from the reasonable to the outlandish. 41 ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS The search for a single, specific slow viral infection continues unabated.
