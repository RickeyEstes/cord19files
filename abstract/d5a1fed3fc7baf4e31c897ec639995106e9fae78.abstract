The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 31 infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health. To 32 develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular 33 mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be confirmed. Therefore, we herein 34 used a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that 35 SARS-CoV-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of 36 SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core 37 of the HR1 and HR2 domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that 38 several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with 39 enhanced interactions with HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus 40 fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by 41 divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We 42 then generated a series of lipopeptides and found that the EK1C4 was the most potent 43 fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and 44 pseudovirus infection with IC 50 s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241-and 149-fold more 45 potent than that of EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective 46 against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses 47 tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, potently 48 inhibiting replication of 4 live human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. 49 Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected 50 mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and 51 treatment of infection by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and emerging 52 SARSr-CoVs. 53 including 2,618 deaths, were reported in China and 27 other countries 11 , posing a 70 serious threat to global public health and thus calling for the prompt development of 71 specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics for treatment and prevention 72 of COVID-19. 73 Coronaviruses (CoVs), the largest RNA viruses identified so far, belonging to the 74 Coronaviridae family, are divided into 4 genera, α-, β-, δ-and γ-coronaviruses, while 75 the β-coronaviruses are further divided into A, B, C, and D lineages. The seven CoVs 76 that can infect humans (HCoVs) include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in the 77 α-coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the β-coronaviruses lineage A, 78 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the β-coronaviruses lineage B (β-B coronaviruses), 79 and MERS-CoV in the β-coronaviruses lineage C 6 . To develop specific SARS-CoV-2 80 fusion inhibitors, it is essential to study the fusion capacity of SARS-CoV-2 compared 81 to that of SARS-CoV. Particularly, the spike (S) protein S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2, We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2's 6-HB core and 111 identified several mutated amino acid residues in HR1 domain responsible for its 112 enhanced interactions with HR2 domain. By conjugating the cholesterol molecule to 113 the EK1 peptide, we found that one of the lipopeptides, EK1C4, exhibited highly 114 potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion and PsV 115 infection, about 240-and 150-fold more potent than EK1 peptide, respectively. 116 EK1C4 is also highly effective against in vitro and in vivo infection of some live 117 HCoVs, such as SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV, suggesting potential for 118 further development as pan-CoV fusion inhibitor-based therapeutics and prophylactics 119 for treatment and prevention of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 120 and MERS-CoV, as well as future reemerging SARS-CoV and emerging 121 SARSr-CoVs. 122 Results 123 The capacity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion 124 From the GISAID Platform (https://platform.gisaid.org), we obtained the 125 full-length amino-acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV 2019-2020) S protein 126 (GenBank: QHD43416). Through alignment with SARS-CoV and SL-CoVs S 127 proteins, we located the functional domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which 128 contains S1 subunit and S2 subunit with the cleavage site at R685/S686 15 . S1 subunit 129 is located within the N-terminal 14-685 amino acids of S protein, containing 130 N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor binding domain (RBD), and receptor binding 131 motif (RBM). S2 subunit contains fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), heptad 132 repeat 2 (HR2), transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic domain (CP) (Fig. 1b) . Recent biophysical and structural evidence showed that SARS-CoV-2 S protein 134 binds hACE2 with 10-fold to 20-fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV S protein, 135 suggesting the higher infectivity of the new virus 12 . Unlike other β-B coronaviruses, 136 S protein of SARS-CoV-2 harbors a special S1/S2 furin-recognizable site, indicating 137 that its S protein might possess some unique infectious properties.
