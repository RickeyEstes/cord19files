Health-care and public health professionals rely on accurate, real-time monitoring of infectious diseases for outbreak preparedness and response. Early detection of outbreaks is improved by systems that are pathogen-specific. We describe a system, FilmArray Â® Trend, for rapid disease 45 reporting that is syndrome-based but pathogen-specific. Results from a multiplex molecular diagnostic test are sent directly to a cloud database. www.syndromictrends.com presents these data in near real-time. Trend preserves patient privacy by removing or obfuscating patient identifiers. We summarize the respiratory pathogen results, for 20 organisms from 344,000 patient samples acquired as standard of care testing over the last four years from 20 clinical 50 laboratories in the United States. The majority of pathogens show influenza-like seasonality, rhinovirus has fall and spring peaks and adenovirus and bacterial pathogens show constant detection over the year. Interestingly, the rate of pathogen co-detections, on average 7.7%, matches predictions based on the relative abundance of organisms present. 55 All rights reserved.

Additionally, numerous next generation, syndromic surveillance systems; e.g., pharmacy sales 70 records [17, 18], Twitter conversations [19, 20], and Wikipedia hits [21, 22], have come online in the past five years. However, these systems cannot report the specific pathogen causing an increase in a particular set of symptoms. Finally, there are more localized efforts such as GermWatch in Utah [23, 24] and the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS) in New York [25, 26] that draw from hospital (HIS) and laboratory (LIS) information systems. 75 This disparity in technologies and data collection methods results in incomplete surveillance. Comprehensive and uniform diagnostic test data will aid in the identification of potential outbreaks. A combination of broad respiratory pathogen testing and an internal electronic surveillance system enabled the rapid dissemination of data across the largest health care system 80 in New York, the North Shore-LIJ Health System (now Northwell Health) during the influenza A H1N1-2009 pandemic in the New York City area. Pathogen-specific molecular testing permitted rapid a) notification to state epidemiologists; b) tracking of the virus so that health care resources could be managed effectively; and c) evaluation of influenza diagnostics [27, 28] .
