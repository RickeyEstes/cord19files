This chapter discusses the role of composite nonwoven fi lters in different structural forms such as combining mechanical support and durability with fi ltration, providing two or more layers of different fi ltration effi ciency and combining different separation technologies/functionality into one fi lter medium. In many situations, composite nonwovens might fulfi ll multiple objectives. Applications of composite nonwovens are quite diverse and increasing in the area of air, liquid and engine fi ltration. The developmental objectives of composite fi ltering media are lower energy consumption, longer fi lter life, high fi ltration capacity, greater dust holding (in depth fi ltration) and easy cleanability (of surface fi lter), satisfying more than one functional requirement and easier maintenance.
