In the present retrospective analysis, we introduce a custom suture-button fixation device for acute ankle syndesmotic injuries that allows for early weightbearing without another planned operation for hardware removal. We evaluated 87 consecutive ankles in 87 patients (49 males [56.32%] and 38 females [43.68%]). Of the 87 patients, 15 (17.24%) withdrew or were lost to follow-up, leaving 72 patients (82.76%) in the present study. Their mean age was 35.2 (range 17 to 67) years. Nineteen patients (26.39%) presented with a pure syndesmotic disruption, and 53 (73.61%) had associated malleolar fractures. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society scale score improved significantly from 31.2 AE 4.2 preoperatively to 88.5 AE 5.3 at an average of 24 months postoperatively (p < .0043). Revision was undertaken because of implant failure in 4 ankles (5.56%). Two revisions (2.78%) were performed in 2 ankles because of early weightbearing in the first 2 weeks after surgery. The third patient (1.39%) underwent revision at 5 weeks postoperatively. This syndesmotic reduction failure was attributed to failure of the threads, which was noted at the second surgery. The fourth patient (1.39%), a 66-year-old male, underwent revision at 5 months postoperatively because of persistent infection. An 18-month postoperative radiograph was available for all patients. The medial clear space had significantly decreased, from 8.2 AE 3.1 mm preoperatively to 3.5 AE 2.2 mm at 18 months postoperatively (p < .0344). Likewise, the tibiofibular clear space had decreased significantly, from a mean of 8.8 AE 3.7 mm preoperatively to a mean of 3.7 AE 2.2 mm at 18 months postoperatively (p < .0322). In conclusion, suturebutton fixation described in the present report delivered satisfactory functional outcomes and anatomic reduction at minimum of 18 months after surgery. The distal tibiofibular syndesmosis is essential for weightbearing activities. The suture-button (SB) technique has increased in popularity for the management of syndesmotic injuries because it allows for physiologic movement of the distal tibiofibular joint (1-5). Nevertheless, in developing countries, the increased expenses of the commercial construct have been a burden on already limited funds. Syndesmotic injuries account for 10% of fractures around the ankle and 20% of fractures requiring operative intervention (6). Various methods of fixation have been described for management of syndesmotic injuries, including the SB technique. The SB allows for more flexibility, resulting in physiologic movement of the distal tibiofibular joint (1,7) . However, because of cost issues, it is difficult to use the commercially available options routinely in our institution. Consequently, the need to design an alternative similar construct was substantial. In the present retrospective study, we introduce, describe, and evaluate a custom-made SB construct for acute ankle syndesmotic injuries that allows for early weightbearing without another operation for hardware removal. Three of us (M.I., A.M., and M.N.) retrospectively evaluated the first 87 consecutive ankles with syndesmosis injury in 87 patients (49 males [56.32%] and 38 females [43.68%]), with a mean age of 35.2 (range 17 to 67) years in whom the described SB technique was used. These patients were treated from January 2010 to January 2014. All the patients were followed up radiologically for a minimum of 18 months after surgery and clinically for 2 years postoperatively. Of the 87 patients, 2 (2.30%) died in the first year after surgery; 1 (1.15) within the first 6 months of severe acute respiratory syndrome attributed to multiple injuries, and 1 of other irrelevant medical comorbidities. Neither death was related to the ankle fixation, and both ankles were stable in situ at the time of death. Another 13 patients (15 total [17.24%]) either withdrew from the study or were lost to follow-up, leaving 72 patients (82.76%) for the final analysis. These Financial Disclosure: None reported.
