A cat was referred because of diffuse parenchymal lung disease. Close examinations revealed a swollen abdominal lymph node and multiple nodules of the liver. Mycobacterium avium subspecies hominissuis infection was confirmed by culture and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of samples recovered from the liver and bronchoalveolar lavage. After administration of combination antibiotics for 6 months, culture results were negative. Though atonic seizures were observed during the treatment, it disappeared after isoniazid discontinuation and pyridoxal phosphate administration. On day 771 of illness, no clinical signs, lung diseases, or obvious swelling of lymph nodes was observed. This is the first report to confirm Mycobacterium avium subspecies hominissuis infection in cats through gene analysis and to completely cure it with combination antibiotics. Mycobacterium avium subspecies hominissuis (MAH), a species of nontuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM), is a slow-growing bacteria that is widely detected in the environment. In human medicine, NTM produce pulmonary infiltrates and disseminated diseases, mainly in immunocompromised hosts [5, 7] . Incidence of NTM infections is reportedly increasing worldwide, and the prevalence of NTM species varies between countries. In Japan, MAH is the most common pathogen of NTM diseases [14, 24, 25] . A previous study has revealed that combination antibiotics following guidelines for the treatment of pulmonary NTM disease achieves positive clinical results [16] . In dogs and cats, MAH infection occurs via ingestion of infected meat or water, or contact with polluted soils [6] . Despite the widespread distribution of MAH, infection in dogs and cats is uncommon due to their innate immunity [13] . Little is therefore known about the clinical implications, treatment, and prognosis of MAH infection in cats. We report here a case of disseminated MAH infection in a young male Somali cat who recovered due to combination antibiotics and describe a side effect observed during treatment. A 4-year-old neutered male Somali cat was kept completely indoors, and received a medical check-up every year. Diffuse parenchymal lung disease had been detected without any symptoms or blood test abnormalities in a medical check-up 3 months previously. Antibiotics and prednisolone (0.55-1.1 mg/kg every 24 hr) had been administered for the previous 2 months due to symptoms such as a poor appetite, moderate tachypnea, and a mild fever. The antibiotics clindamycin (5.5 mg/kg every 12 hr), doxycycline (11 mg/kg every 12 hr), and enrofloxacin (5.6 mg/kg every 24 hr) were administered separately. Despite the drug administration, his symptoms and lung disease were not improved. He was therefore referred to the Veterinary Medical Center of Osaka Prefecture University. On physical examination, a body weight of 4.4 kg, body temperature of 39.0Â°C, heart rate of 180/min, and rhonchi lung sounds (respiratory rate: 30/min) were observed. A complete blood cell count revealed neutropenia (Table 1) . The general chemical profile
