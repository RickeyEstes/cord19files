Human immunoglobulin G (IgG) has been used to treat people with inherited immunoglobulin deficiencies since 1952 when Bruton 1 infused a child with undetectable ''gamma globulin'' levels and who suffered from recurrent pneumococcal infections. Subcutaneous infusions of 3.2 g/mo produced measurable gamma globulin levels and completely eliminated pneumococcal infections. Human IgG soon became the standard treatment for patients with primary antibody deficiencies who develop chronic bacterial infections. The first human IgG produced on a large scale was known as immune serum globulin or ISG. It was produced by a cold ethanol precipitation process developed in the early 1940s by E. J. Cohn and his coworkers 2,3 in the Department of Physical Chemistry at Harvard Medical School. ISG was formulated at a protein concentration of 165 mg/mL that contained 0.3 Molar glycine, 0.9% (weight/volume) sodium chloride and 0.1 g/L merthiolate. ISG solutions were adjusted to pH 6.8 AE 0.4 and stored at 5 C. With time, ISG solutions tended to form particles (aggregates) during storage. Aggregates were generally believed to be the cause of adverse events when ISG was injected intravenously. Therefore, the first commercial immunoglobulins were restricted to intramuscular or subcutaneous injections. In 1962, spontaneous complement activation (anticomplement activity) by IgG aggregates was proposed as the principal cause of adverse side reactions when ISG was injected intravenously. 4 The desire to eliminate anticomplement activity
