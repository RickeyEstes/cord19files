The following review is based on notes used in the teaching of clinical immunology to veterinary students. Immune diseases of the dog are placed into six different categories: (1) type I or allergic conditions; (2) type II or auto-and allo-antibody diseases; (3) type III or immune complex disorders; (4) type IV or cell-mediated immune diseases; (5) type V conditions or gammopathies; and (6) type VI or immunodeficiency disorders. Separate discussions of transplantation immunology and the use of drugs to regulate unwanted immune responses are also included. # 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.
