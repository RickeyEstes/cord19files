KEYWORDS Syndromic panel Respiratory panel Sepsis panel Gastroenteritis panel Meningitis panel Encephalitis panel Syndromic panels should evolve to include additional pathogen targets. Syndromic panels should be flexible in design to better meet the user's needs. Syndromic panels should include host response markers to correlate with pathogen detection. Syndromic panels should have shorter run times, less complexity, and be placed near the point of care. Syndromic panels should be expanded to include more antimicrobial resistance determinants and phenotypic susceptibility results.
