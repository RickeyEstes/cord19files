The DA virus IS a neurotroplc murlne virus which can induce acute encephalomyelitis in suckling mice and a chronic myelopathy in weanhngs The agent has been attenuated by serial passage in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells When attenuated virus is inoculated in 8-week-old C3HeJ mice a myelopathy of delayed onset with promlnent demyehnatlon of lateral and anterior columns occurs The DA virus is believed to be related to the Theller murlne encephalomyelitis (TME) viruses because of the similar clinical and pathological conditions which it causes, and because neutralization tests indicate shared antigens between it and GD7, a TME virus This paper reports electron-microscopic studies of BHK-21 cells infected with DA virus The cells were prepared 24 and 48 hr after inoculation Cytopathlc effects were observed and infected cells contained plaques consisting of numerous 25 nm virus particles in crystalline array The Vlrlons were exclusively lntracytoplasmlc and were morphologically indistinguishable from human pohomyehtls virus These observations appear to establish DA as a plcorna virus, related to the TME vtrus group The chronic myelopathy caused by DA may prove relevant to chronic demyehnative myelopathles in man, such as multiple sclerosis, and also to amyotrophlc lateral sclerosis
