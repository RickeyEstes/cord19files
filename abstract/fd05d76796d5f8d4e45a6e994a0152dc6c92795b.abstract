Astrocyte Glial cell that secretes neuroprotective factors and is associated with maintenance of the BBB. Blood-Brain Barrier Endothelial cells connected by tight junctions that form a highly selective barrier between the circulating blood and the CNS parenchyma. Central Nervous System In vertebrates, it comprises the brain and spinal cord; the complex of nerve tissues that controls the activities of the body. Microglial cell Bone marrow-derived macrophage lineage glial cell that is the resident 'macrophage' of the CNS. They constantly survey the CNS and become immunologically active upon pathogen detection. Neuron Electrically active cell that transmits signals from the periphery and within the central nervous system. Oligodendrocyte Glial cell that produces the myelin sheath around neuronal axons and promotes conduction. For recovery from infection, the immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) must eliminate or control virus replication without destroying nonrenewable, essential cells. Thus, upon intracellular virus detection, the infected cell must initiate clearance pathways without triggering neuronal cell death. As a result, the inflammatory response must be tightly regulated and unique mechanisms contribute to the immune response in the CNS. Early restriction of virus replication is accomplished by the innate immune response upon activation of pattern recognition receptors in resident cells. Infiltrating immune cells enter from the periphery to clear virus. Antibodies and interferon-g are primary contributors to noncytolytic clearance of virus in the CNS. Lymphocytes are retained in the CNS after the acute phase of infection presumably to block reactivation of virus replication.
