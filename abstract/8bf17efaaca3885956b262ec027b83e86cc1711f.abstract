A method based on Melting Temperature analysis of Hypervariable regions (HVR) of S1 gene within a RT-qPCR was developed to detect different genotypes of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and identify the Mass genotype. The method was able to rapidly identify the Mass genotype among IBV field isolates, vaccine attenuated strains and reference M41 strain in allantoic liquid and also directly in tissues. The RT-qPCR developed detected the virus in both tracheal and pulmonary samples from M41-infected or H120-infected birds, in a larger post-infection period compared to detection by standard method of virus isolation. RT-qPCR method tested provided a sensitivity and rapid approach for screening on IBV detection and Mass genotyping from IBV isolates. KEY WORDS: avian infectious bronchitis virus, Massachusetts, melting temperature analysis, RT-qPCR, S1 gene Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute and highly infect-contagious viral disease, responsible by significant economic loss to the poultry industry worldwide that is caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [6] . IBV genome is well known to be highly prone to undergo mutations, leading to changes on nucleotide and/or amino acids sequences of the major structural IBV genes/proteins, resulting in multiple variants of this virus. Most important target of mutations is the spike 1 (S1) glycoprotein gene, especially those located in HVR I, (region encoding amino acid residues 56-69), and HVR II (region encoding amino acid residues 117-131). These regions of S1 glycoprotein have sites involved on the virus attachment to the receptors in the target host cells and the most important neutralizing epitopes. Mutations in the S gene could result in antigenic changes and emergence of IBV variants. This constant arising of new IB variants in different countries [8, 18] is usually pointed as the main cause of vaccine failures in the field and constitutes a great challenge for the molecular direct diagnosis of IBV. Variants of IBV are mutants evolving from parental strains of this virus that differ from strains considered classic, such as those from Massachusetts group, regarding genotype, pathotype, antigenicity and/or immunogenicity. Additionally, IBV mutants are constantly subject to host immune selection and only strains with high antigenic variation are able to evade immune responses induced by vaccines and to survive in the population of hosts, leading to the development of clinical disease [25] . Protection studies between commercial vaccines and IBV variants, especially those using Massachusetts (Mass) vaccines, which is the most common attenuated available vaccine, have demonstrated at least partial cross-protection by some authors [9, 10, 12, 14, 34] , while another studies have not found cross-protection [7, 35] . Therefore, the rapid detection of IBV infection in poultry flocks and its classification between Mass and variants is considered as major challenge, which requires use of appropriate diagnostic methods. To overcome this issue, several rapid assays have been developed focusing on detection and/or characterization of S1 gene of IBV, including direct gene sequencing, RT-PCR methods with serotype-specific primers, and RT-PCR/RFLP, have become widely used, because their results correlated well with the virusserotyping [19, 21, 22, 33] . Beside these molecular methods, RT-qPCR methods using primers and probes for S1 gene or UTR region were developed and applied for IBV diagnosis, resulting in high sensitivity and specificity [5] . A SYBR Green RT-qPCR was tested on a wide range of coronaviruses and clinical samples, but it was not able to discriminate the different virus genus or
