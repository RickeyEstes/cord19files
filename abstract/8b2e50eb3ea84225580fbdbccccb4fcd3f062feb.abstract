Background 33 An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia was first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and then spread rapidly to 35 other regions. It has been declared that at least one confirmed case infected by 36 SARS-CoV-2 was found in each province of China by late January 2020. 37 We collected the time series data of the cumulative number of confirmed infected, 39 dead, and cured cases from the health commissions in 31 provinces in mainland China. 40 A simple descriptive model in a logistic form was formulated to infer the intrinsic 41 epidemic rules of COVID-19. Furthermore, we compared the intrinsic epidemic rules 42 of COVID-19 in Hubei with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 43 Beijing, which was obtained from the Ministry of Public Health of China in 2003. 44 The feature of data of three population groups in all the provinces could be well 46 captured (R 2 >0.95) by the proposed descriptive model with slight variation among 47 (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .
