Animals at Chulalongkorn University (Bangkok, Thailand) investigated a suspected outbreak of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) infection in piglets with acute diarrhea, gilts, and sows that occurred on a commercial swine farm. Epidemiolgic investigation, pathologic examination, sample collection, and laboratory diagnosis were conducted to determine the cause of the outbreak. Blood (n = 10), intestine (n = 8), lymph node (n = 2), feces (n = 6), and feed (n = 4) samples were collected for 2 day-old piglets and 17-, 19-, and 20-week-old fattening pigs. Because sick pigs had clinical signs similar to those of pigs with other swine virus diseases, all samples were tested for transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus; PEDV; rotaviruses A, B, and C; porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and circovirus (1-5). For PDCoV identification, RNA was extracted from homogenized tissue and fecal, blood, and feed samples by using the QIAamp RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized by using the Improm-II Reverse Transcription System and random primer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). In brief, 5 L of virus RNA and 5 L of random primers (100 µmol/L) in a total reaction volume of 22 L were incubated at 70C for 15 min and at 4C for 5 minutes. A total of 4 L of 5× cDNA buffer, 1 L of 0.5 mmol/L dNTP mixture, 2 L of 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.3 L of RNase inhibitor, 1 L of ImProm-II reverse transcriptase, and 3.7 L of distilled water were added to the RNA-primer mixture. The mixture was incubated at 25C for 5 min, 42C for 60 min, and 72C for 15 min. PDCoV identification was conducted by using a PCR protocol previously described (6). In brief, 10 L of PCR mixture contained 0.5 L of cDNA, 0.4 L (10 mol/L) of each forward and reverse primer, 5 L of 2× TOP Taq Master Mix (QIAGEN), 1 L of 10× CoralLoad, and 2.7 L of distilled water. PCR conditions for PDCoV identification were initial denaturation at 94C for 3 min;
