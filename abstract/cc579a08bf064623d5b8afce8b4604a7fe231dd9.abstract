. Ultrastructure and protein A-gold lmmunolabelling of HRT-18 cells infected with turkey enteric coronavirus. Vet Mzcrobml, 20" 21-33. The Minnesota strata of turkey enteric coronavlrus (TCV) was propagated m HRT-18 cells, a cell line derived from human rectum adenocarcinoma. A productive non-cytopathlc refection was established, without a previous adaptation, in these cells as shown by the specific hemagglutmatlng activtty in cell culture supernatants. A post-embedding lmmunochemmal technique, usmg specific antiserum directed against the original egg-adapted virus and colloidal-gold-labelled protein A as the electron-dense marker, was used for the identification of the virus and related antigens in the cells by electron microscopy. Budding of typmal coronavtrus particles, through mtracytoplasmic membranes and accumulation of complete virus within cytoplasmm vesicles or the lumen of rough endoplasmlc reticulum, were the mare features of the viral morphogenes~s Late m refection, numerous progeny viral particles were shown at the outer surface of infected cells, but budding could not be demonstrated at this level. Two different types of surface projections were observed on the extracellular particles of this avian coronavlrus. These morphological charactenstms have been thus far described only for mammahan hemagglutinating coronaviruses
