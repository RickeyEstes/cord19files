Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is present within the ventricular system of the brain, the central canal of the spinal cord, and the subarachnoid space (SAS) between the pia mater and the arachnoid mater. CSF is a component of, and is continuous with, the interstitial fluid of the central nervous system (CNS). It is separated from the bloodstream and from the CNS parenchyma by an intricate barrier system comprising ependymal epithelium, choroid plexus epithelium, the leptomeninges, areas of modified leptomeninges, and the arachnoid villi (the reader is referred elsewhere for a thorough discussion of these barriers and their transport mechanisms). 1,2 CSF has mechanical (protection) and metabolic (transport, excretion) functions. Sampling of the CSF is an important part of the minimum database for patients with neurological signs and may be useful in monitoring response to therapy in CNS inflammatory disease. When performed correctly, acquisition is a rapid, inexpensive, and technically simple method of sampling the local environment of the CNS extracellular space for evidence of inflammatory, neoplastic, traumatic, or degenerative disease. It is not without risk, however, and should be performed judiciously, that is, when clinical indication exists and no contraindications are present. This chapter will review the biology of CSF, methods for collection, and causes for abnormalities in parameters, such as protein concentration and nucleated cell count.
