Background Southeast Asia has been at the epicentre of recent epidemics of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases. Community-based surveillance and control interventions have been heavily promoted but the most effective interventions have not been identified. This review evaluated evidence for the effectiveness of community-based surveillance interventions at monitoring and identifying emerging infectious disease; the effectiveness of community-based control interventions at reducing rates of emerging infectious disease; and contextual factors that influence intervention effectiveness. Inclusion criteria Communities in Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. Non-pharmaceutical, non-vaccine, and community-based surveillance or prevention and control interventions targeting rabies, Nipah virus , dengue, SARS or avian influenza. Two independent reviewers critically appraised studies using standard Joanna Briggs Institute instruments. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. A customised tool was used to extract quantitative data on intervention(s), populations, study methods, and primary and secondary outcomes; and qualitative contextual information or narrative evidence about interventions. Data was synthesised in a narrative summary with the aid of tables. Meta-analysis was used to statistically pool quantitative results. Fifty-seven studies were included. Vector control interventions using copepods, environmental cleanup and education are effective and sustainable at reducing dengue in rural and urban communities, whilst insecticide spraying is effective in urban outbreak situations. Communitybased surveillance interventions can effectively identify avian influenza in backyard flocks, but have not been broadly applied. Outbreak control interventions for Nipah virus and SARS are effective but may not be suitable for ongoing control. Canine vaccination and education is more acceptable than culling, but still fails to reach coverage levels required to effectively control rabies. Contextual factors were identified that influence community engagement with, and ultimately effectiveness of, interventions. Despite investment in community-based disease control and surveillance in Southeast Asia, published evidence evaluating interventions is limited in quantity and quality. Nonetheless this review identified a number of effective interventions, and several contextual factors influencing effectiveness. Identification of the best programs will require comparative evidence of effectiveness acceptability, cost-effectiveness and sustainability. Interventions are more effective if there are high levels of community ownership and engagement. Linkages between veterinary and public health surveillance systems are essential. Interventions are not well accepted when they fail to acknowledge the importance of animals for economic activity in communities. Evidence is needed on functioning and outcomes of current surveillance systems and novel low-cost methods of surveillance. Evaluations of control interventions should control for confounding and report measures of disease, cost and sustainability. Translational research is needed to assess generalisability and evaluate roll-out of effective interventions as regional or national programs. Page 4 places a strong emphasis on both the early detection and early control of infectious disease outbreaks. Early detection of disease outbreaks requires effective disease surveillance systems. Systems in developing countries face many operational challenges, including a lack of accurate and timely information exchange between local, provincial, national and regional levels, and inadequate human resource and laboratory capacity for speedy diagnosis. The WHO's Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases 2010 highlights the need for community involvement in surveillance. 2 Zoonotic disease detection and control also depends on effective veterinary surveillance and the ability to contain outbreaks amongst animal populations, systems that are often poorly developed or nonexistent in developing countries. Jones et al. 5 suggest that local targeted surveillance of at-risk people may be the best way to prevent large-scale emergence. Brownstein et al. 6 in their discussion of web surveillance suggest that the use of news media and other non-traditional sources of surveillance data such as web-accessible discussion sites and disease reporting networks could facilitate early outbreak detection and increase public awareness of disease outbreaks prior to their formal recognition. May et al. 7 review the evidence for syndromic surveillance systems in developing countries (systems utilising existing clinical data prior to a diagnosis) and find that this may be a feasible and effective approach to infectious disease surveillance in developing countries. The effectiveness of surveillance systems in responding generally to emerging infectious diseases has not been reviewed systematically. Reviews aimed at particular contexts (for example, prevention of bioterrorism 8 and public health surveillance for trachoma 2 ) have been undertaken, however, neither review was able to state whether surveillance systems are achieving the ultimate goal of detecting outbreaks early and providing an accurate picture of infection rates in the area covered by the surveillance program. 2 Most evaluations of surveillance programs have been qualitative, and focused on evaluating the practical structure and operation of the system, rather than the impact on infectious disease transmission. 9-11 Many researchers have used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline which recommends how a surveillance system can be assessed to verify if it meets its objectives. 12 This provides a framework for evaluating how well a system is functioning and determining reasons why it may or may not be functioning to detect and respond to infectious disease outbreaks and/or support ongoing control activities to tackle endemic diseases. The CDC guideline recommends that reports of surveillance systems include the following:  descriptions of the public health importance of the health event under surveillance; the system under evaluation; the direct costs needed to operate the system; the usefulness of the system;  evaluations of the system's simplicity, stability (its ability to withstand external changes), flexibility (that is, -the system's ability to change as surveillance needs change‖), acceptability (-as reflected by the willingness of participants and stakeholders to contribute to the data collection, analysis and use‖), sensitivity to detect outbreaks, positive predictive value of JBI Database of Systematic Reviews & Implementation Reports JBL000603 2013;11(2)1-235 Page 5 system alarms for true outbreaks, representativeness of the population covered by the system, and timeliness of detection. Control of emerging infectious disease requires an effective response to surveillance data. Single measures such as the use of vaccines or antiviral drugs may be unavailable, unaffordable or not in sufficient quantity. The control of these infectious diseases in resource constrained settings is more likely to be influenced by community-based and behavioural change interventions as well as by strengthening of national and international commitment to their control. 13 Over the last decade there have been increased efforts to promote community-based infectious disease control. 2 For vector-borne infections, such as dengue, attention has been focused on interventions to reduce larval, and ultimately adult, vector populations. Programs have attempted to achieve this via a range of chemical, biological and physical interventions to reduce vector populations, as well as trying to initiate behavioural change at the community level to prevent contact with the mosquito vectors. 14 Heintze et al. have previously reviewed the evidence for community-based dengue control programs. 15 This systematic review completed in 2005 found at that time that the evidence for these activities was weak and inconclusive and suggested a number of priorities for future research in this area. However, the review has not since been updated. Community-based interventions to control the spread of respiratory viruses, such as influenza, have focused on hygiene and respiratory etiquette to prevent human-to-human transmission. Many of these interventions have only been evaluated in a developed country context. Aledort et al. 16 and Jefferson et al. 13 undertook systematic reviews of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. Both reviews found handwashing was effective whilst there was no evidence to support school/workplace closure. However, these findings are from a predominantly North American context and may not be generalisable to countries with limited access to safe water and sanitation. To understand whether community-based control activities will be effective and why requires us to look at the behavioural mechanisms through which these interventions work and the context in which they are based. Behavioural mechanisms operate through the experiences, beliefs and values of groups and individuals. These mechanisms are therefore dependent in part on the context in which they are used. This framework was used in a recent synthetic review of water and sanitation projects. 17 The framework is shown in Figure 1 . The objective of this review is to identify the effectiveness of surveillance systems and communitybased interventions in identifying and responding to emerging and re-emerging zoonotic infections in SE Asia. It aims to provide a critical review of published evidence that evaluated the effectiveness of community-based surveillance and prevention and control interventions for emerging zoonotic infectious diseases. In addressing the three research questions outlined below we will summarise evidence for not only the effectiveness of community surveillance and prevention and control interventions in SE Asia in identifying and responding to these infectious diseases, but also explore the contextual factors that influenced their success. More specifically the review questions were: 1. What is the effectiveness of community-based surveillance interventions designed to identify emerging zoonotic infectious diseases? 2. What is the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical community-based interventions designed to prevent transmission of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases? 3. How do factors related to the emergence and management of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases impact the effectiveness of interventions designed to identify and respond to them?
