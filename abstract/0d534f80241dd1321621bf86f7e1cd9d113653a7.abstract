lack of physician communication, and poor interpersonal skills. The trial attorneys believe that the threat of litigation makes doctors discharge their services more safely. 7 A deep-seated tension exists between the malpractice system and the goals and initiatives of patient safety. 7 Interestingly, improvements in patient safety have been accompanied by an increase in claims of professional medical liability. 4 The number of medical negligence cases against doctors, hospitals, and nursing homes is increasing day by day, globally. Ethical analysis in general is accused of being abstract and abstruse, as practitioners face difficulties in making decisions while handling cardiac emergencies. At the same time, analysis of the moral concepts of clinical problems, issues, challenges, and arguments among professionals based on scientific evidence help to move the field forward and/or provide clarity. Doctors face ethical complexities among the cases handled by them, and while most of the issues are very similar, they receive less attention or go unnoticed, are not recorded, and are rarely documented. Because ethics pervades all areas of practice in one or other way, it has to be considered, realized, studied, and practiced. Medicine, law, and social values are dynamic. New additions are constantly incorporated into health laws because of new issues and technological advances. The American College of Physicians Ethics Manual covers emerging issues in medical ethics 8 and reiterates ethical principles. Moral principles form the basis for ethics and are incorporated into the ethical rules of different professions. Historically, the practice of medicine was subject to legal restrictions in ancient Egypt. Also the right to practice was restricted to certain members. Doctors had to learn and follow certain percepts laid down by their predecessors. All these were practiced probably with an intension to protect the public from quackery. Although many professions deal with people who are in vulnerable states and have access to the inner lives of other human beings through service or trust, the impact of medical service on individuals is one reason why medicine and physicians exist in the first place. 9 The main goals of medical ethics are to improve the standard of care by identifying, analyzing, and attempting to resolve ethical problems that arise in medical practice. 10 Organizations that lack adequate role-modeling have resulted in a lack of ethical concern for patients, inadequate monitoring of institutional ethics, and a lack of improvement in patient care resulting in deteriorating outcomes of health care. 10 This chapter discusses ethical and legal aspects based on generally accepted principles, including cardiology-related emerging issues for developing appropriate patient care. In addition, the educational aspects related to law and ethics are briefly highlighted. Health care delivery has to be tailored with regard to recipients' status such as attitude, knowledge, beliefs, understanding, social system position, resources, The Heart and Toxins culture, views, religious sentiments, and so on. Thus, the influencing factors for delivery of services are status and the channel adopted by the health care team. The quality of care and the quality of caring are integrated with each other in many ways. Medicine has to be practiced by knowledgeable, competent, and compassionate physicians who have high-quality therapeutic and healing relationships with patients and their families or caregivers in the setting of a safe and efficient health care system. 11 With good documentation, legal issues are less likely to occur. Analyzing the existing status of health care delivery, the Supreme Court of India has stated that doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, and other connected health care establishments are to be dealt with strictly if found to be negligent. Patients, irrespective of their social, cultural, and economic background, are entitled to be handled with dignity. Seven ideal physician behaviors were identified by Bendapudi et al.: 12 physicians should be confident, empathetic, humane, personal, forthright, respectful, and thorough. These seven ideal behaviors reflect deep-seated character traits that the physician should have, as well as more superficial behaviors or skills. 11 Physicians should remember that the opposite of desired physician behaviorfor example, poor service, arrogance in dismissing patients' input, disinterest in the patient, impatience in answering a patient's questions, and callousness in discussing the patient's prognosis-are considered negatively by patients. 12 Pellegrino's virtues of a good physician are benevolence, compassion, courage, fidelity to trust, intellectual honesty, prudence, and truthfulness. 13 All of these behaviors are essential for delivering appropriate, effective, efficient, equitable, patient-centered, safe, and easily accessible health care. 14 Ayurveda, one of the ancient systems of medicine in India, insists on medical ethics; doctor√Äpatient relationships; and the qualities of teacher, physician, and student. The cornerstones of medical ethics in Ayurveda medicine are compassion, integrity, respect, honesty, courage, and conscientiousness. 15 Ayurveda's paternal beneficence is different from modern medical ethics. Individual factors that impair the decision-making process and their failure to maintain technical competency, such as health status, stress, alcohol, and drugs, may be seen in some physicians. A number of people in India believe that doctors are negligent, not courteous enough, not easily accessible, and prescribe unnecessary investigations and drugs; 16 they attribute medical negligence to lack of knowledge on the part of doctors. Despite this, many cases go unnoticed and very few come to consumer courts. Doctors have long been portrayed as wise and dedicated healers; however, this positive image has been in decline since 1970. Recent movies have portrayed doctors as masters, commanders, greedy, egotistical, uncaring, and unethical. 17,18 Complaint letters about physicians often relate to their inappropriate attitude, lack of satisfaction,
