A synthesis of (±)-thia-calanolide A 3 has been successfully accomplished starting from 3,5-dimethoxythiophenol 4, in six steps in an overall yield of 4.5%. The key reaction involved Friedel-Crafts tigloylation of 5,7-dihydroxy-4-n-propyl thiocoumarin 6 employing an appropriate solvent of CS 2 -PhNO 2 in a ratio of 7:3. In its biological evaluation for anti-HIV activity, (±)-thia-calanolide A 3 demonstrated comparatively less activity with calanolide A and its synthetic analogue aza-calanolide. Further, (±)-3 has been resolved by chiral HPLC to (+) and (À)-3. ª 2012 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.
