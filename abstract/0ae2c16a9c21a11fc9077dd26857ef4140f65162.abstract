This brief review has a limited scope. It focuses on technical developments of practical interest concerning construction of hybridomas and their expansion for large scale production of monoclonal antibodies. Some of the procedures surveyed are not yet routinely applied but are promising. Highlighted are tactics to improve fusion efficiency and production of antibodies in vitro, the use of chemically defined culture media, and attempts at generating antibodies other than murine, especially human. Beginners in hybridoma technology and those planning to use it soon should be aware of current trends beyond the classical technology. These trends should be carefully considered before making basic decisions, for example what cell line to use as a fusion partner. It should be clear that new avenues are being explored with success. Mouse and rat hybridomas are no longer the only alternatives. Monoclonal antibodies of other species, e.g., human, are within the realm of the possible. The same can be said for
