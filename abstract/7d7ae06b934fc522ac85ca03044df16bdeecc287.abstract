The history of antiviral and antiretroviral therapy is recent compared with many other medical therapies, including traditional antibiotics in pregnancy. Given the proliferation of these recent agents, there are few long-term data on which to base decisions of management in pregnancy. Accessing up-to-date information is critical to optimizing the safety of care for mothers and their infants. The general avoidance of unnecessary medications in the first trimester is still prudent, and judicious use of these medications in later pregnancy is sensible. Exposure to medications in pregnancy can be toxic to a fetus in a gestational age-dependent manner [1] . Medications that are teratogenic at certain stages in the first trimester may be safe later in pregnancy, and medications later in pregnancy may have metabolic effects that interfere with neonatal function. Determination of safe medications for use in pregnancy must take into consideration the relative need for the use of certain medications and the possibility of inadvertent exposure in early pregnancy because of unplanned pregnancies. This article reviews the most commonly used antiviral and antiretroviral agents and places particular emphasis on the issues regarding use in pregnancy. Amantadine and rimantadine are related drugs used in the treatment of influenza A. Mechanism of action of these drugs is not well understood, but it is believed that they likely act as membrane fusion inhibitors and as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors [2, 3] . Amantadine is excreted unchanged in the urine, whereas rimantadine is metabolized in the liver. The main described side effects are central nervous system based, including insomnia, impaired thinking, and confusion [4] . Information in pregnancy is limited, but amantadine has shown teratogenic and embryotoxic effects when given in high doses to rats. No adequate human studies have been conducted.
