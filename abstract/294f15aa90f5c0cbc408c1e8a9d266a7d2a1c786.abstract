Extensive studies suggest that although changes in immunity with healthy aging (termed immunosenescence) occur at the most rapid rate of any physiologic system, it is the compounding effects of age-related diseases and external conditions that result in an overall state of a dysfunctional immunity responsible for the increased risk for and severity of common infections in older adults. Hence, immunosenescence is a predisposing condition, but its contribution to infection risk likely is small until immunity is impaired further as a result of accumulating chronic illness, external conditions, or repeated or chronic infections. This is different from the changes related to immunosuppression that result from certain conditions, such as HIV infection, or immunosuppressive medications that result in unusual, opportunistic infections. Unfortunately, the challenge of studying a diverse population with multiple confounders and the focus of gerontologists on studying normal aging have limited research and understanding of why frail, older adults are so susceptible to common infections and outbreaks of infectious syndromes, including influenza, West Nile virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and experience frequent vaccine nonresponse. The high risk for infection in those of advanced age and who have multiple comorbidities is underscored by the high rates of health care-acquired infections in older adults residing in long-term care facilities (LTCF).
