We implemented a carbapenem-saving strategy in hemato-oncology patients from 2013, using an empirical combination of piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin for high-risk hemato-oncology patients with febrile neutropenia, who remain hemodynamically unstable > 72 hours despite initial cefepime treatment. All-cause mortality was not different between the two periods (6.54 and 6.57 deaths per 1,000 person-day, P = 0.926). Group 2 carbapenem use significantly decreased after strategy implementation (78.43 vs. 67.43 monthly days of therapy, P = 0.018), while carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli did not show meaningful changes during the study period. Our carbapenem-saving strategy could effectively suppress carbapenem use without an increase of overall mortality. To reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and improve outcomes, development of facility-specific guidelines for fever and neutropenia in hemato-oncology patients is required. 1 Our center, a 1,950-bed tertiary care hospital, used cefepime as an initial empirical antibiotic for hematooncology patients with febrile neutropenia according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America. 2 Empirical antibiotics were escalated to group 2 carbapenems (Gr2Cs) for highrisk patients who remain hemodynamically unstable despite initial treatment. 2 However, this approach raised concerns about carbapenem overuse. From 2013, we implemented a carbapenem-saving strategy using an empirical combination of piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin (PTZ/AMK) as a bridging regimen before using Gr2C. To evaluate the effects of this strategy, we reviewed antibiotic use, antimicrobial resistance, and overall mortality before and after strategy implementation. Our strategy was based on in vitro data showing that PTZ/AMK combination covered 92.8% of extended spectrum Î²-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli isolates. 3 Since aminoglycosides were rarely used in our hospital, amikacin susceptibility was also relatively well preserved
