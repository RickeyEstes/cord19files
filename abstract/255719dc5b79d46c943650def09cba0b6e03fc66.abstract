Glycans form a highly variable constituent of our mucosal surfaces and profoundly affect our susceptibility to infection and disease. The diversity and importance of these surface glycans can be seen in individuals who lack a functional copy of the fucosyltransferase gene, FUT2. Representing around one-fifth of the population, these individuals have an altered susceptibility to many bacterial and viral infections and diseases. The mediation of host-pathogen interactions by mucosal glycans, such as those added by FUT2, is poorly understood. We highlight, with specific examples, important mechanisms by which host glycans influence infection dynamics, including by: acting as pathogen receptors (or receptor-decoys), promoting microbial stability, altering the physical characteristics of mucus, and acting as immunological markers. We argue that the effect glycans have on infection dynamics has profound implications for many aspects of healthcare and policy, including clinical management, outbreak control, and vaccination policy. Mucosal infections account for over one-tenth of deaths globally, and are a major source of morbidity [1]. These are predominately infections of the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract. With these sites exposed to external sources, encounters with microbial pathogens are unavoidable; however, the likelihood that an interaction will result in an infection varies substantially between individuals [2]. The ability to predict the outcome of exposure remains a central challenge in modern medicine. i
