J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Highlights  The article provides a summary on cellular receptors involved in virus immunity.  It presents an overview of the current understanding of inflammasomes complex activation, comparing its different types with special focus on NLRP3.  The article summarizes key findings on viroporins, a novel class of viral proteins and their role in the virus life cycle and host cell interactions.  The article sheds the light on the correlation between viroporins and inflammasomes activation and their possible contribution to aggravated inflammatory cytokines production.  The article proposes targeting inflammasomes in combination with viroporin inhibitors in virus-induced disease as an emerging attractive therapeutic option. Abstract Viroporins are virus encoded proteins that alter membrane permeability and can trigger subsequent cellular signals. Oligomerization of viroporin subunits results in formation of a hydrophilic pore which facilitates ion transport across host cell membranes. These viral channel proteins may be involved in different stages of the virus infection cycle.
