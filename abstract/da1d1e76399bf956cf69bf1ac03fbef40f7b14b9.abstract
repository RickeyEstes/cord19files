Approximately one-third of school-aged children who present with a sore throat will have GAS as the causative organism; this declines to <15% in adulthood. In temperate climates, there is significant seasonal variation in the rates of GAS pharyngitis, peaking during winter/early spring. In tropical climates, the seasonal variation appears to be less marked, although robust data are lacking. 4 It is unclear as to whether other factors affect this (e.g., increased viral transmission or crowding). 5 Impetigo is common in childhood; transmission occurs readily in school and pre-school care settings, especially during summer in humid locations. In tropical settings where the burden is particularly high, almost half of children can have impetigo at any one time. 6
