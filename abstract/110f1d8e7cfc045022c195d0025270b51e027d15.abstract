Background: As part ofour influenza pandemic preparedness, we studied the dispersion distances of exhaled air and aerosolized droplets during application of a jet nebulizer to a human patient simulator (HPS) programmed at normal lung condition and different severities of lung injury. Methods: The experiments were conducted in a hospital isolation room with a pressure of -5 Pa. Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke. The jet nebulizer was driven byair at a constant flow rate of 6 Umin, with the mask reservoir filled with sterile water and attached to the BPS via a nebulizer mask. The exhaled leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light sheet and images captured by high-de6nition video. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke and droplet particles. Finding.: The maximum dispenion distance of smoke particles through the nebulizer side vent was 0.45 m lateral to the HPS at normal lung condition (oxygen consumption, 200 mUmin; lung compliance, 70 mUcm H.O), but it increased to 0.54 m in mild lung injury (oxygen consumption, 300 mUmin; lung compliance, 35 mUcm H.O), and beyond 0.8 m in severe lung injury (oxygen consumption, 500 mUmin; lung compliance, 10 mUcm H.O). More extensive leakage through the side vents of the nebulizer mask was noted with more severe lung injury. Interpretation: Health-care worken should take extra protective precaution within at least 0.8 m from patients with febrile respiratory illness of unknown etiology receiving treatment via a jet nebulizer even in an isolation room with negative pressure.
