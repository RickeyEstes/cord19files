The nuclear organization of the cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic and orexinergic systems in the brains of three species of strepsirrhine primates is presented. We aimed to investigate the nuclear complement of these neural systems in comparison to those of simian primates, megachiropterans and other mammalian species. The brains were coronally sectioned and immunohistochemically stained with antibodies against choline acetyltransferase, tyrosine hydroxylase, serotonin and orexin-A. The nuclei identified were identical among the strepsirrhine species investigated and identical to previous reports in simian primates. Moreover, a general similarity to other mammals was found, but specific differences in the nuclear complement highlighted potential phylogenetic interrelationships. The central feature of interest was the structure of the locus coeruleus complex in the primates, where a central compactly Abbreviations: III, oculomotor nucleus; IV, trochlear nucleus; Vmot, motor division of trigeminal nerve nucleus; Vsens, sensory division of trigeminal nerve nucleus; VI, abducens nucleus; VIId, dorsal division of facial nerve nucleus; VIIv, ventral division of facial nerve nucleus; X, dorsal motor vagus nucleus; XII, hypoglossal nucleus; 5n, trigeminal nerve; 3V, third ventricle; 4V, fourth ventricle; A1, caudal ventrolateral medullary tegmental nucleus; A2, caudal dorsomedial medullary nucleus; A4, dorsolateral division of locus coeruleus; A5, fifth arcuate nucleus; A6c, compact portion of locus coeruleus; A6d, diffuse portion of locus tract cluster of orexinergic neurons; P, putamen nucleus; pVII, preganglionic motor neurons of the superior salivatory nucleus or facial nerve; pIX, preganglionic motor neurons of the inferior salivatory nucleus; PBg, parabigeminal nucleus; PC, cerebral peduncle; pg, pineal gland; PIR, piriform cortex; PPT, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus; py, pyramidal tract; pyx, decussation of the pyramidal tract; R, thalamic reticular nucleus; Rmc, red nucleus, magnocellular division; RMg, raphe magnus nucleus; ROb, raphe obscurus nucleus; RPa, raphe pallidus nucleus; RtTg, reticulotegmental nucleus of the pons; RVL, rostral ventrolateral serotonergic group; S, septal nuclear complex; SC, superior colliculus; scp, superior cerebellar peduncle; Sep.m, medial septal nucleus; Sp5, spinal trigeminal tract; Stn, subthalamic nucleus; vfu, ventral funiculus; vh, ventral horn of spinal cord; VPO, ventral pontine nucleus; xscp, decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle, zizona incerta; Zic, zona incerta cluster of orexinergic neurons.
