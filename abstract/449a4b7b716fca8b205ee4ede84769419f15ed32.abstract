Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form is intended for publication with all accepted life science papers and provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. Every life science submission will use this form; some list items might not apply to an individual manuscript, but all fields must be completed for clarity. Describe how sample size was determined. With baseline carriage rates of 50% (expected based on prior data from our model), 73 participants in each arm were required for 80% power to detect a 50% relative increase in pneumococcal acquisition at any time point, after 10% drop-out. Describe any data exclusions. Of 130 vaccinated volunteers, five were natural pneumococcal carriers (two in LAIV arm and three in control arm) and were excluded from further analysis. Another 8 subjects in the LAIV arm were excluded following a systematic LAIV dispensing error by a single practitioner, as recommended by the trial steering group. This resulted in a final 55 subjects analysed in the LAIV arm and 62 subjects in the control arm. Describe the measures taken to verify the reproducibility of the experimental findings. Key findings, including monocyte recruitment to the nasopharynx were validated in an independent patient cohort. All attempts are replication findings were successful. Describe how samples/organisms/participants were allocated into experimental groups. Using a permuted-block algorithm (1:1, blocks of 10) held in sealed envelopes, participants were randomised to receive either nasal LAIV (Fluenz Tetra or FluMist Tetra, AstraZeneca, UK, used interchangeably due to procurement shortages) paired with intramuscular placebo (0.5ml normal saline), or nasal placebo [control] (0.2ml normal saline) paired with intramuscular Quadrivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccination (Fluarix Tetra, GlaxoSmithKline, UK) (see supplemental methods for flu strains). Describe whether the investigators were blinded to group allocation during data collection and/or analysis. This was a double-blinded, randomized trial where investigators were blinded during data collection and data analysis Note: all in vivo studies must report how sample size was determined and whether blinding and randomization were used.
