Zika virus (ZIKV) is a highly transmissive virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family, which comprises several other pathogens that threaten human health. This re-emerging virus gained attention during the outbreak in Brazil in 2016, where a considerable number of microcephaly cases in newborns was associated with ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Lacking a preventive vaccine or antiviral drugs, efforts have been made to better understand the viral life cycle. In light of this, the relevance of the endosomal-lysosomal compartment for the ZIKV life cycle was investigated. A549 and SH-SY5Y cells were infected with either the African strain (associated with mild symptoms) or the French Polynesia strain (associated with neurological complications). For both strains, the V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, efficiently inhibited ZIKV entry and prevented the spread of the infection by interfering with viral maturation. Additionally, affecting cholesterol metabolism and transport with the drug U18666A, which inactivates late endosomes and lysosomes, impairs the viral life cycle. The data presented show a clear antiviral effect of two compounds that target the same compartments in different ways. This highlights the relevance of the endosomal-lysosomal compartment for the viral life cycle that should be considered as a target for antivirals. Viruses 2019, 11, 524 2 of 25 life cycle initiates with the interaction between the viral envelope protein and the host cell receptors and adhesion/entry factors, such as DC-SIGN, AXL, Tyro3 and Tim-1 [15] . Nevertheless, there are conflicting data about the relevance of AXL as the primary receptor of ZIKV entry [16] [17] [18] . After internalization via receptor-mediated endocytosis, it is assumed that the acidification of the late endosomes, also termed multivesicular bodies (MVBs), promotes a structural change in the viral envelope, allowing the fusion between the endosomal membrane and the envelope. This leads to the release of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm and, consequently, to the disassembling of the capsid and the uncoating of the viral RNA [19, 20] . After the genomic RNA has been translated and replicated, a newly synthesized immature viral particle is assembled and conducted to the secretory pathway. In this immature form, the pr peptide covers approximately 12 amino acids of the fusion loop of the envelope protein and, thus, prevents premature fusion within the cell. In the trans-Golgi network (TGN), the viral particle undergoes maturation as a result of a structural modification induced by the low pH that allows the cleavage of the prM by a furin-like protease, exposing the fusion loop. Lastly, the infectious viral particle exits the cell by exocytosis and the pr fragment dissociates from the virion due to the neutral pH of the extracellular environment [21, 22] . Besides the bite of an infected mosquito (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus), ZIKV infection can occur through perinatal transmission, sexual contact and blood transfusion [23] [24] [25] [26] . Since there is no vaccine or a specific antiviral drug available against ZIKV, understanding the viral life cycle and finding ways to control infection has become urgent. Although the ZIKV life cycle is often described to resemble the life cycle of other flavivirus members, a variety of open questions with respect to the viral life cycle still exists. In light of this, the importance of the endosomal-lysosomal compartment for the ZIKV life cycle was investigated. Firstly, the acidification of the late endosomes/MVBs and the TGN compartments was impaired by the highly selective inhibitor of the vacuolar H + -ATPase (V-ATPase), bafilomycin A1 [27] . The relevance of the acidification of the endosomal compartment for ZIKV entry has been previously studied in Huh 7 cells by Cortese et al., more recently,. Our data from A549 cells show that on the one hand, bafilomycin A1 was able to fully inhibit ZIKV entry and, on the other hand, it interferes with viral maturation. Concerning the SH-SY5Y cells, bafilomycin A1 decreased ZIKV entry. In the second part of this study, the functionality of the late endosomes and lysosomes was hindered by the amphipathic steroid drug, U18666A. U18666A inhibits the intracellular trafficking of cholesterol and lipids by the direct inhibition of the Niemann-Pick type C protein. This results in cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes/MVBs and lysosomes, which leads to the impairment of their functionality [31] . Several reports showed that U18666A inhibits crucial steps of dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus and feline coronavirus life cycles [32] [33] [34] [35] . However, no studies were performed to investigate the impact of U18666A on ZIKV infection. This work provides further insights into the ZIKV life cycle and elucidates crucial steps for viral entry and release.
