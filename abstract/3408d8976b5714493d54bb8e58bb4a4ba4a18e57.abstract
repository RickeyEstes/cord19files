A single tube¯uorogenic RT±PCR-based`TaqMan' assay was developed for detection and classi®cation of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). TaqMan±PCR was optimized to quantify BVD virus using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system and dual-labeled¯uorogenic probes. Two different gene speci®c labeled¯uorogenic probes for the 5 H untranslated region (5 H UTR) were used to differentiate between BVD types I and II. Sensitivity of the single tube TaqMan assay was compared with two-tube TaqMan assay and standard RT±PCR using 10-fold dilutions of RNA. Single tube TaqMan assay was 10±100-fold more sensitive than the two-tube TaqMan assay and the standardized single tube RT±PCR. Speci®city of the assay was evaluated by testing different BVD virus strains and other bovine viruses. A total of 106 BVD positive and negative pooled or single serum samples, ®eld isolates and reference strains were tested. Quantitation of cRNA from types I and II BVD virus was accomplished by a standard curve plotting cycle threshold values (C T ) versus copy number. Single tube TaqMan±PCR assay was sensitive, speci®c and rapid for detection, quantitation and classi®cation of BVD virus. #
