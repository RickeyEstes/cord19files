This review presents recent information on the expression of intestinal brush-border disaccharidases (maltase-glucoamylase, sucrase-isomaltase, lactase and trehalase) and peptidases (aminopeptidases A and Nand dipeptidyl peptidase IV) during development in growing animals. The biosynthesis, structure and function of these intestinal enzymes are reported. Analysis of their localisation along the crypt-villus axis shows that levels of intestinal enzyme mRNA and specific activity are at their highest in the lower half of the villi. The distribution of intestinal enzymes along the proximal-distal axis of the intestine changes after birth. This results in the establishment of specific distribution patterns in sucking or weaned animals, according to the enzyme examined. The expression of brush-border enzymes is developmentally imprinted. Nevertheless, there is a role for substrates in the regulation of enzyme expression. Weaning induces dramatic changes in the specific activities of the disaccharidases, and to a lesser extent in peptidase specific activities. Finally, it is concluded that studies of the regulation of intestinal gene expression are relatively scarce in porcine and bovine species. Development of new molecular tools, in particular high-density microarrays, is expected to provide new and relevant information for improved understanding of the physiology of the small intestine.
