Syndromic panels Point-of-care molecular diagnostics Multiplex PCR Group A Streptococcus Influenza-like illness Meningitis Gastroenteritis Blood stream infections Syndromic and point-of-care molecular diagnostic testing methods have revolutionized infectious disease testing by permitting the simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens and drug resistance mechanisms directly from clinical specimens and positive blood cultures. Syndromic testing panels currently include those designed for the detection of pathogens responsible for bloodstream, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract infections as well as some biothreat agents. Point-of-care molecular diagnostic systems afford providers the ability to generate laboratory-quality results without the need for confirmatory testing of negative specimens. Implementation of syndromic and point-of-care molecular infectious disease testing methods has curbed the unnecessary use of antibiotics, strengthening antimicrobial stewardship practices. Development of methods for the detection of infectious diseases beyond those that are detectable by current technologies is an area of investigation.
