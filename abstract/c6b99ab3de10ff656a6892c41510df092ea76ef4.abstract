To determine the ability of nanopore sequencing to provide rapid genomic data on RNA virus pathogens, a workflow was adopted and developed from cDNA sequencing protocols created by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (Oxford, UK) (MAP SEQ-002) (Figure 1, panel A). In brief, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) vaccine strain TC-83 and Ebola virus (EBOV) variant Makona isolate C05 stock IRF0137 (EBOV/Mak-C05) were grown and RNA isolated from clarified cell-culture supernatants. VEEV TC-83 was prepared from stocks derived from United States Army Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus TC-83 stocks. One MOI of VEEV TC-83 was adsorbed on Vero E6 monolayers for 2 hours. After 48 h of incubation in Minimum Essential Medium-α + 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, Gaithersburg, MD; ThermoFisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), cell culture supernatants were collected and clarified by centrifugation at 650 × g for 10 min at 4°C. RNA was isolated from cell-culture supernatant using the QIAamp MinElute virus spin kit (QIAGEN) for isolated VEEV particles.
