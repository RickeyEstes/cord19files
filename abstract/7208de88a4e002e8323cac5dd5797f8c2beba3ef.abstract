Once clinical virology's best kept secret, the Molecular Virology Workshop and Clinical Virology Symposium (CVS), held in Clearwater Beach, Florida each Spring, are secret no more. The 20th annual CVS (25-28 April, 2004) was attended by 727 clinical virologists and other interested individuals, while 304 attended the Workshop (23-24 April, 2004). Both meetings are organized by the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology (PASCV) and the University of South Florida College of Medicine. The gatherings are characterized by the high quality and focus of the presentations, lively question and answer sessions, and (not least) the meeting location in a modest older hotel on a beautiful Gulf of Mexico beach. Their increasing popularity meant that this year, for the first time, shuttle buses had to be hired to bring attendees from other nearby hotels.
