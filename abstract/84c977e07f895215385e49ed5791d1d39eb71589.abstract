The pathogen safety of blood/plasma-derived products has historically been a subject of significant concern to the medical community. Measures such as donor selection and blood screening have contributed to increase the safety of these products, but pathogen transmission does still occur. Reasons for this include lack of sensitivity/specificity of current screening methods, lack of reliable screening tests for some pathogens (e.g. prions) and the fact that many potentially harmful infectious agents are not routinely screened for. Methods for the purification/inactivation of blood/plasma-derived products have been developed in order to further reduce the residual risk, but low concentrations of pathogens do not necessarily imply a low level of risk for the patient and so the overall challenge of minimising risk remains. This review aims to discuss the variable level of pathogenic risk and describes the current screening methods used to prevent/detect the presence of pathogens in blood/ plasma-derived products. j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / b l r e which may contain infectious agents) is effective in reducing the rate of pathogen transmission, but may result in the unnecessary wastage of blood/plasma-derived products. Since recombinant clotting factors are not derived from blood or plasma, they present a minimal risk of pathogen transmission (particularly third generation factors, which have no contact with blood/ plasma-derived components whatsoever) and can therefore be considered safer than using plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates [11] . However, there has been concern that the use of recombinant clotting factors may be associated with an increased rate of inhibitor formation in patients who regularly receive these products [12] ; this is another factor that may influence the overall clinical assessment of patient risk. Recombinant clotting factors are available for the treatment of haemophilia A (FVIII) and B (FIX) and factor VII/XIII deficiency, while plasma-derived concentrates are available for most other clotting factors (including von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen and the vitamin K dependent clotting factors). In some cases only fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate are available for replacement therapy (e.g. factor V deficiency). Ideally, plasma and plasma-derived products would be completely replaced by recombinant products in order to minimise the risk of pathogen transmission; however, this is not always possible. A recent article comprehensively reviewed the pathogen safety of plasma-derived and recombinant clotting factors [13] . This review examines the potential for transmission of infectious agents that might be present in blood/plasma-derived products used to treat haemostatic disorders. We focus on the identities of these agents and the screening procedures used for their detection, as well as the limitations of screening. Current unmet needs in the field of pathogen safety of blood/plasma-derived products are also discussed. The PubMed database was interrogated from 1 January 2000 to the present using the search strings 'bleeding disorders OR haemophilia' and 'pathogens AND blood safety'. The search terms 'virus', 'bacteria', 'haemorrhagic disorders', 'von Willebrand disease', 'FVII deficiency' and 'FXIII deficiency' were added to this search but did not yield any additional pertinent result. The bibliographies of reviews were also used to identify relevant references and individual searches were conducted for information on specific pathogens. Information and opinions were also provided by the authors. 3. Infectious agents present in blood/plasma-derived products: lessons from the past and current concerns
