Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient cells are highly susceptible to viral infection. This study examined the mechanism underlying this phenomenon by measuring the expression of antiviral genes-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and GTPase myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1)-in G6PD-knockdown cells upon human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. Molecular analysis revealed that the promoter activities of TNF-α and MX1 were downregulated in G6PD-knockdown cells, and that the IκB degradation and DNA binding activity of NF-κB were decreased. The HSCARG protein, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) sensor and negative regulator of NF-κB, was upregulated in G6PD-knockdown cells with decreased NADPH/NADP + ratio. Treatment of G6PD-knockdown cells with siRNA against HSCARG enhanced the DNA binding activity of NF-κB and the expression of TNF-α and MX1, but suppressed the expression of viral genes; however, the overexpression of HSCARG inhibited the antiviral response. Exogenous G6PD or IDH1 expression inhibited the expression of HSCARG, resulting in increased expression of TNF-α and MX1 and reduced viral gene expression upon virus infection. Our findings suggest that the increased susceptibility of the G6PD-knockdown cells to viral infection was due to impaired NF-κB signaling and antiviral response mediated by HSCARG. Viruses 2015, 7, 6689-6706 deficiency predisposes cells to increased oxidative stress. G6PD-knockdown cells exhibit premature senescence, growth retardation, and increased susceptibility to stress-induced apoptosis [4] [5] [6] . Clinically, in addition to the classical association with hemolytic anemia [7, 8] , patients with G6PD-deficiency have an increased risk of degenerative diseases [9] [10] [11] [12] . G6PD-deficient cells are more susceptible to enterovirus, coronavirus, and dengue virus infections [13] [14] [15] . These findings suggest that the G6PD status, and hence the redox environment, is a risk factor for viral infection. The mechanism underlying the effect of the redox environment on viral replication remains elusive. Viral replication and spread is inhibited by the antiviral defense mechanisms of the host. The replication and spread normally involves activation of the antiviral innate immune responses and culminates in the production of type I interferons (IFNs) [16] and proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) [17, 18] . Both IFNs and TNF-α are antiviral cytokines and display strong antiviral activity in host innate immunity [19] . Type I IFNs are the principal antiviral cytokines produced during the innate immune responses to viral infections, and upregulate antiviral proteins [20] [21] [22] . More than 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are initiated by type I IFN signaling, have been discovered. Some ISG-encoded proteins, such as GTPase myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) [23], protein kinase R (PKR) [24], and 2 1 -5 1 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) [25] , are implicated in the antiviral state. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play crucial roles in many cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and signal transduction [30] [31] [32] . ROS have also been shown to trigger the signaling process of innate immune responses [33, 34] . Oxidative stress affects viral replication partly by altering host immunity [35, 36] . The inhibitory effect of the G6PD status on viral replication is unknown, which can be attributed to the alteration of the host innate immune response from modulating the redox homeostasis of the host cells. HSCARG, also called NMRAL1, is an NADPH sensor; changes in the NADPH/NADP + ratio can induce allosteric change and the subcellular redistribution of HSCARG [37, 38] . HSCARG regulates the proteolysis of RelA and the phosphorylation of IKKβ [39] and plays an essential role in NF-κB signaling [39] [40] [41] . Moreover, HSCARG suppresses the TNF-α-stimulated activation of NF-κB [40] , suggesting that the NADPH/NADP + ratio or the redox status affects the NF-κB-mediated immune response through the modulation of HSCARG. HSCARG can inhibit TRAF3 ubiquitination and negatively regulate the cellular antiviral response [42] . Because of the crucial role of G6PD in maintaining cellular NADPH/NADP + , examining the relationship among the G6PD status, HSCARG, and host innate immune response is worthwhile. This study addresses how the G6PD status affects the innate immune response to viral infection. The expression of viral genes is substantially higher in G6PD-knockdown cells infected with human coronavirus strain 229E (HCoV-229E) and EV71 than in infected control cells. The expression of antiviral genes, such as MX1 and TNF-α, is upregulated, albeit to lower levels, in G6PD deficient cells. HSCARG, whose expression is enhanced in G6PD-deficient cells, inhibits IκB degradation and the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. Exogenous G6PD or isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), which increases cellular NADPH/NADP + , restores NF-κB-mediated antiviral response. These findings demonstrate that G6PD activity, and hence NADPH/NADP + status, can affect antiviral immunity through the modulation of HSCARG and the NF-κB signaling cascade.
