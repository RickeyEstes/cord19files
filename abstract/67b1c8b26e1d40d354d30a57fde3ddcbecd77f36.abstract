Microbiota Dysbiosis Intestinal tract Skin Oral cavity Necrotizing enterocolitis Late-onset sepsis The intestinal microbiota of the extremely preterm infant differs dramatically from that of term infants, children, and adults with decreased diversity and high numbers of g-proteobacteria and Firmicutes and low numbers of common commensal microbes. Alterations in the intestinal microbiota of the preterm infant precede the onset of necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis. Altering the intestinal microbiota with diet, antibiotics, and prebiotic and probiotic supplements may be less effective in extremely preterm infants, prompting the need for novel approaches to dysbiosis in this population.
