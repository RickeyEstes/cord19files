Fig. S1. Related to Fig. 1. The morphologies of WT CVB3 and CVB3 3A-H57Y ROs in BGM cells are indistinguishable. BF738735 treatment does not affect Golgi apparatus architecture. A) BGM cells infected with WT CVB3 and prepared for EM by HPF-FS reveal typical enterovirus ROs, including single-membrane tubules, DMVs and multilamellar vesicles (left to right). B, C). BGM cells either untreated (B) or treated with BF738735 for 7 hours (C) were fixed for EM analysis. Representative images are shown illustrating that the morphology of the Golgi apparatus was unaffected by treatment. Scale bars, 200 nm (A) or 1 µm (B, C). Fig. S5. Related to Fig. 6. Innate antiviral responses during CVB3 3A-H57Y infection. U2OS or HEK293T cells (KO for PKR, MAVS and AGO where indicated) were infected with CVB3-Rluc 3A-H57Y at MOI 0.01. Following infection, the inoculum was removed and fresh medium with or without BF738735 inhibitor was added to the cells. Cells were lysed to determine the intracellular amounts of luciferase as a measure of genome replication. Values represent mean values of triplicates ± standard error of the means.
