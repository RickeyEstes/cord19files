Highlights d Viral infection leads to redox dysregulation including the downregulation of SOD1 d Sod1 À/À mice exhibit aggravated viral hepatitis, which is rescued by antioxidants d IFN-I signaling via STAT1 drives SOD1 downregulation and early liver damage d Ablation of IFN-I signaling ameliorates viral hepatitis in Sod1 À/À and WT mice Correspondence abergthaler@cemm.oeaw.ac.at Bergthaler and colleagues show that superoxide dismutase 1 protects the liver from type I interferon-driven oxidative damage in viral hepatitis. Liver damage was mediated by hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1-STAT1 signaling.
