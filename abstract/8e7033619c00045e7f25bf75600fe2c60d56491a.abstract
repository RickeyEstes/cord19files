Many of us were drawn to the specialty of dermatology by the excitement of recognizing key dermatologic features that led to the diagnoses of important systemic disorders. Although there is significant overlap between the skin signs of systemic disease in children and adults, there are several conditions in which important distinctions exist in the characteristic clinical presentation. Our author, Dr. Amy Gilliam, has special experience and expertise in pediatric rheumatologic disorders. In an interesting case-based format, Dr. Gilliam provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical findings in several rheumatologic conditions that are more specific to children in contrast to their adult counterparts. Furthermore, she provides an update on diagnosis and management of several uniquely pediatric disorders including neonatal lupus erythematosis, childhood vasculitides (Kawasaki disease, Henoch Schonlein Purpura, acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy) and the more recently described neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disorder (NOMID) syndrome. This article provides clinically relevant information that may aid the clinician in the accurate and prompt recognition of these challenging diseases. Timely diagnosis will hopefully result in more effective therapy as well as prevention of disease-related complications that may ultimately improve the outcomes in these complex patients. T he diagnostic criteria for many systemic disorders in both adults and children include at least one skin finding, and the skin may be the first of several organs affected by these conditions. Early recognition of subtle cutaneous signs of systemic illness in childhood can help to prevent adverse outcomes through earlier initiation of appropriate treatment. Although adults and children are affected by many of the same systemic conditions, there are some dermatologic features of these illnesses that are unique to the pediatric population. In this review, several cases of children presenting with cutaneous features of systemic disease will be discussed.
