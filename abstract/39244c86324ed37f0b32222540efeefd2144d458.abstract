Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), is a highly infectious disease in pigs. Vaccination is an effective approach to prevent TGEV infection. Here, we evaluated the potential of TGEV S1 as a DNA vaccine and porcine interleukin (pIL)-12 as an adjuvant in a mouse model. A DNA vaccine was constructed with the TGEV S1 gene to induce immune response in an experimental mouse model; pIL-12 was chosen as the immunological adjuvant within this DNA vaccine. The pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(pIL-12) vectors were transfected into BHK-21 cells and expressed in vitro. Experimental mice were separately immunized with each of the recombinant plasmids and controls through the intramuscular route. The lymphocytes isolated from the blood and spleen were analyzed for proliferation, cytotoxic activities, and populations of CD4 + and CD8 + cells. The titers of TGEV S1 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and TGEV neutralizing antibodies and the concentrations of interferon (IFN)-Î³ and IL-4 were also analyzed in the serum. The plasmids pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(pIL-12) could be expressed in BHK-21 cells, and the combination of pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(pIL-12) could induce a significant increase in all markers. pIL-12 could act as an immunological adjuvant in the DNA vaccine for TGEV-S1. Furthermore, the DNA vaccine prepared using TGEV-S1 and porcine IL-12 could induce excellent humoral and cellular immune responses. Transmissible gastroenteritis is a highly infectious and acute digestive disease caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection. The classical symptoms of this disease include severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. Swine of different ages and breeds are susceptible to TGEV infection. TGEV is often isolated in cases of poly-infections involving other pathogens and mainly infects piglets. The mortality rate can be as high as 100% and may decline as the animal gets older; however, the decrease in the feed utilization of infected animals may have huge economic consequences [11, 16] . TGEV is a coronavirus and contains a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome [28] , which encodes four structural proteins and three non-structural proteins. Spike (S) protein is the major component of the virion surface and possesses four antigen sites,
