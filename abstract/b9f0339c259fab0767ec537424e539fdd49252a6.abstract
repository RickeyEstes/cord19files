Graphical Abstract Highlights d Influenza A virus PA-X targets the majority of host mRNAs for destruction d Downregulation by PA-X correlates with the number of splice sites in a transcript d Splicing renders RNAs susceptible to PA-X d The cellular CFIm complex interacts with PA-X and contributes to PA-X activity Correspondence craig.mccormick@dal.ca (C.M.), d.khaperskyy@dal.ca (D.A.K.), marta.gaglia@tufts.edu (M.M.G.) In Brief Gaucherand et al. uncover a unique relationship between RNA degradation by the influenza A virus ribonuclease PA-X and host RNA splicing, which allows PA-X to selectively target host RNAs for destruction.
