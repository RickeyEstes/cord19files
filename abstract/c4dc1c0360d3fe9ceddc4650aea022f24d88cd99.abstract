Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne disease 34 caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection. Despite a gradual increase of SFTS cases and high 35 mortality in endemic regions, no specific viral therapy nor vaccine is available. Here, we 36 developed a single recombinant plasmid DNA encoding SFTSV genes, Gn and Gc together 37 with NP-NS fusion antigen, as a vaccine candidate. The viral antigens were fused with Fms-38 like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt3L) and IL-12 gene was incorporated into the plasmid to 39 enhance cell-mediated immunity. Vaccination with the DNA provides complete protection of 40 IFNAR KO mice upon lethal SFTSV challenge, whereas immunization with a plasmid 41 without IL-12 gene resulted in partial protection. Since we failed to detect antibodies against 42 surface glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, in the immunized mice, antigen-specific cellular immunity, 43 as confirmed by enhanced antigen-specific T cell responses, might play major role in 44 protection. Finally, we evaluated the degree of protective immunity provided by protein 45 immunization of the individual glycoprotein, Gn or Gc. Although both protein antigens 46 induced a significant level of neutralizing activity against SFTSV, Gn vaccination resulted in 47 relatively higher neutralizing activity and better protection than Gc vaccination. However, 48 both antigens failed to provide complete protection. Given that DNA vaccines have failed to 49 induce sufficient immunogenicity in human trials when compared to protein vaccines, 50 optimal combinations of DNA and protein elements, proper selection of target antigens, and 51 incorporation of efficient adjuvant, need to be further investigated for SFTSV vaccine 52 development. 53 54 Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infection 58 endemic to East Asia including China, Korea, and Japan. Gradual rise of disease incidence 59 and relatively high mortality have become a serious public health problem in the endemic 60 countries. In this study, we developed a recombinant plasmid DNA encoding four antigens, 61 Gn, Gc, NP, and NS, of SFTS virus (SFTSV) as a vaccine candidate. In order to enhance cell-62 mediated immunity, the viral antigens were fused with Flt3L and IL-2 gene was incorporated 63 into the plasmid. Immunization with the DNA vaccine provides complete protection against 64 lethal SFTSV infection in IFNAR KO mice. Antigen-specific T cell responses might play a 65 major role in the protection since we observed enhanced T cell responses specific to the viral 66 antigens but failed to detect neutralizing antibody in the immunized mice. When we 67 immunized with either viral glycoprotein, Gn protein induced relatively higher neutralizing 68 activity and better protection against SFTSV infection than Gc antigen, but neither generated 69 complete protection. Therefore, an optimal combination of DNA and protein elements, as 70 well as proper selection of target antigens, might be required to produce an effective SFTSV 71 vaccine. 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 .
