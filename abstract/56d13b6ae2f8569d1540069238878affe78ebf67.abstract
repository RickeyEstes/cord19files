Objective: This study investigated whether outpatient visits of acute upper respiratory infections for children aged less than 15 years are associated with temperature, air pollutants and circulating respiratory viruses in Taipei, Taiwan, from 2003 to 2007. Methods: Outpatient records for acute upper respiratory infections (ICD9 CM codes: 460, 462, 463,464, 465.9 and 487) in a randomly selected sample (n ¼ 39,766 children in 2005) was used to estimate the cumulative relative risks (RR) associated with average temperature lasting for 8 days (lag 0-7 days), air pollutants (NO 2 , O 3 and PM 2.5 ) lasting for 6 days (lag 0-5 days), and virus-specific positive isolation rate lasting for 11 days (lag 0-10 days) using distributed lag non-linear models after controlling for relative humidity, wind speed, day of week, holiday effects and long-term trend. Results: Average temperature of 33 1C was associated with the lowest risk for outpatient visits of acute upper respiratory infections. Relative to 33 1C, cumulative 8-day RR was highest at 15 1C of ambient average temperature [RR ¼1.94; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.78, 2.11]. With the first quartile as reference, cumulative 6-day RRs were 1.25 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.29) for NO 2 , 1.04 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.06) for O 3 , and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.03) for PM 2.5 at the 95th percentile. Per-standard deviation (SD) increase of virus-specific isolation rate for influenza type A (SD ¼13.2%), type B (SD ¼ 8.76%), and adenoviruses (SD ¼5.25%) revealed statistical significance for overall 11-day RRs of 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.03), 1.05 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.06) and 1.04 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.05), respectively. Conclusions: Current study suggested a positive association between outpatient visits for acute upper respiratory infections and ambient environment factors, including average temperature, air pollutants, and circulating respiratory viruses.
