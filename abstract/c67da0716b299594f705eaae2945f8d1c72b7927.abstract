LETTERS thrombocytopenia, hepatomegaly, and recent exposure to ticks. Although Amblyomma americanum, the main known vector of E. chaffeensis, has not been reported in Venezuela, Rhipicephalus sanguineus and A. cajennense are abundant in rural areas of Venezuela; their ability to be vectors should be investigated. We are grateful to Jacqueline Dawson for providing the DH82 cell lines infected with E. canis and E. chaffeensis. We also thank Guillermo Comach for performing serologic testing, isolation, and PCR techniques for dengue virus.
