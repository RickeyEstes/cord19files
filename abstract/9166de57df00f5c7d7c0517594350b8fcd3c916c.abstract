A 44-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency room with the complaints of abdominal pain, generalized muscle pain, cramps, and dark urine lasting for the last five days. She was well orientated with a body temperature of 37.3Â°C, blood pressure of 110/80 mmHg, and pulse rate of 84/min. Systemic examination did not reveal any pathological finding. The biochemical tests showed elevated levels of ALT (1196 U/L), AST (1200 U/L), LDH (1768 U/L), creatinine (2.1 mg/dL), and BUN (62 mg/dL). Viral hepatitis, leptospirosis and hepatorenal syndrome were considered in the differential diagnosis and the patient was transferred to the Infectious Diseases Department. She was diabetic and hypertensive for a year and was taking gliclazide 60 mg/day, lisinopril 20 mg/day. She was also taking Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 11, Supplement 2, 2005 The urinary tract infection is the most frequent site of nosocomial infections, accounting for approximately 40% of all NCIs. Catheterization is the most risk factor that predispose for such UTI. Two hundred sixty-six strains (76%) out of 348 catheterized patients were isolated. Out of these 266 strains, 212 cases were identified as NCIs, 54 cases (20%) were identified as community acquired infection. The isolated strains were found to be 202 (76%) Gram-negative bacilli, 32 (12%) S. aureus and 32 (12%) Candida isolates. The organisms were more common in NCIs than in community-acquired infections. Nosocomial infections were higher in the urology ward than in other ward involved in Abstracts Objectives: Recently, DIN 58940 was altered, now recommending to test the beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of Sulbactam in presence of a constant concentration of 4 mg/L instead of E. coli (n = 289) Ertapenem Imipenem Meropenem RANGE <0.03-4 <0.03-1 <0.03-0.5 MIC50 <0.03 0.125 <0.03 MIC90 0.125 0.25 <0.03 K. pneumoniae (n = 174) RANGE <0.03-4 <0.03-1 <0.03-0.25 MIC50 <0.03 0.125 <0.03 MIC 90 0.25 0.25 0.06 Objective: The antimicrobial resistance of nosocomial isolates, especially from intensive care units (ICUs), is increasing worldwide. The aim of this analysis was to assess the in vitro activity of meropenem (MEM) and eight other antibiotics against Gramnegative isolates from a paediatric ICU. Methods: Eight hundred and eighty Gram-negative isolates were obtained from clinical specimens of children hospitalized in ICU during 1997-2004. The isolates were identified using conventional methods. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of MEM, imipenem (IMP), piperacillin + tazobactam (TAZ), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefepime (CPE), gentamicin (GM), tobramycin (TM) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) were determined using the NCCLS agar dilution method.
