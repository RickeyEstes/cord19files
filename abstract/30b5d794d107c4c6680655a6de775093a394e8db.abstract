KEYWORDS Sarcoidosis Antimicrobials Infectious antigens There is a growing body of literature supporting the role of infectious antigens, in particular mycobacteria and propionibacteria, in sarcoidosis pathogenesis. Immunologic studies reveal that mycobacterial virulence factors are the targets of the immune response in sarcoidosis diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Recently, case reports and clinical trials have emerged reporting the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy on cutaneous and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Although the studies are not conclusive, they demonstrate efficacy on endpoints associated with sarcoidosis morbidity and mortality, such as forced vital capacity (FVC).
