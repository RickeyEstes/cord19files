The ability to rapidly assemble and prototype cellular circuits is vital for biological research and its applications in biotechnology and medicine. Current methods that permit the assembly of DNA circuits in mammalian cells are laborious, slow, expensive and mostly not permissive of rapid prototyping of constructs. Here we present the Mammalian ToolKit (MTK), a Golden Gate-based cloning toolkit for fast, reproducible and versatile assembly of large DNA vectors and their implementation in mammalian models. The MTK consists of a curated library of characterized, modular parts that can be easily mixed and matched to combinatorially assemble one transcriptional unit with different characteristics, or a hierarchy of transcriptional units weaved into complex circuits. MTK renders many cell engineering operations facile, as showcased by our ability to use the toolkit to generate single-integration landing pads, to create and deliver libraries of protein variants and sgRNAs, and to iterate through Cas9-based prototype circuits. As a biological proof of concept, we used the MTK to successfully design and rapidly construct in mammalian cells a challenging multicistronic circuit encoding the Ebola virus (EBOV) replication complex. This construct provides a non-infectious biosafety level 2 (BSL2) cellular assay for exploring the transcription and replication steps of the EBOV viral life cycle in its host. Its construction also demonstrates how the MTK can enable important and time sensitive applications such as the rapid testing of pharmacological inhibitors of emerging BSL4 viruses that pose a major threat to human health. and Extensible Mammalian Modular Assembly kit (EMMA) 3 based on Golden Gate assembly reactions were proposed. Both methods use sets of modular parts with given functionality, which can be assembled directionally into transcription units (TUs) by type-IIS restriction enzymes. While useful, all three methods have important shortcomings. GMAP requires sequencing in between all cloning steps, which makes the method slow and expensive. EMMA and mMoClo provide a method to hierarchically assemble DNA vectors that encode large circuits, but fall short on shareability, integration of Cas9 sgRNA cloning, a library of tested parts, and ease of use. While in yeast and plant systems, methods for the rapid, efficient and hierarchical assembly of genetic circuits from a large library of well described modular parts [8] [9] [10] [11] exist, we are unaware that such a cloning toolkit for mammalian systems is readily available. In this work, we adapted the modular cloning strategy (MoClo) 12 strategy to build mammalian expression vectors. The Mammalian ToolKit (MTK) is a library of over 300 parts including vetted promoters, 3'UTRs, fluorescent proteins, insulator and P2A elements that can be combined to build large genetic circuits in a rapid and efficient fashion. These vectors can be delivered to a wide range of cell types, through viral, recombinase and CRISPR/Cas9 methods. As a proof of concept, we built a hAAVS1 landing pad for single integration of genetic circuits, created and delivered libraries of protein variants and sgRNAs and rapidly compared multi-species Cas9-based genetic circuits. Finally, we used Ebola virus (EBOV) as a test case to address an emerging need to streamline the generation of BSL2 reagents during outbreaks of novel BSL4 viruses. Using the MTK, we rapidly built a non-infectious multicistronic ribonucleoprotein expression system for EBOV in a mammalian host. This system recapitulates the transcription and replication sub-lifecycle of the virus in a mammalian host, and can therefore be used to accelerate the study of viral biology and discovery of antiviral molecules.
