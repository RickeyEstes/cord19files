Modulation of resistance to Salmonella typhimurium infection in mice by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) . Microbial Pathogenesis 1989 ; 6 : 81-91 . Prior infection of mice with a field strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) increased the early resistance of euthymic mice to virulent Salmonella typhimurium strain SR-11 infections (as defined by significantly fewer salmonella colony-forming units (cfu) present in spleens and livers 4 days after salmonella infection) . This increase in salmonella resistance was observed when the interval between MHV and salmonella infections was 6 days, but not at 3, 10, or 14 day intervals . The mouse Ity locus, which controls the number of intracellular salmonella, had a significant effect on the ability of MHV to induce resistance to salmonella . MHV caused an increase in resistance to salmonella in ltyg (salmonella susceptible) mice at all doses of salmonella tested (100 to 10000 cfu) . In the lty' (salmonella resistant) mice tested the beneficial effect of MHV on salmonella resistance was small and when observed, was only present at salmonella doses of 10000 cfu or greater . Neither the Lpsd nor Xid mutations affected the ability of MHV to increase resistance to salmonella infection . In contrast to euthymic mice, MHV infection greatly decreased the resistance of athymic (nude) mice to salmonella infection . Since the Nu locus does not affect the resistance of mice to salmonella (at 4 days post salmonella infection), these results indicate that MHV infection and the nude phenotype interact to increase susceptibility to salmonella . These findings re-emphasize the importance of keeping laboratory mice used in research free of MHV and other immunomodulatory pathogens .
