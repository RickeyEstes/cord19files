Supplementary Data 1. The entire list of neoepitopes predicted from the six primary:relapsed TARGET NBL patients. Each sheet on the table describes the results from one sample including the mutated genes, the specific mutation, the neoepitopes and its corresponding binding MHC, and a binding score. Samples were processed in small groups across multiple Azure machines. Mutation rates predicted with and without OxoG filtering, and the corresponding CA/GT rates are provided for each sample. Samples in processing groups F1-15 denote samples that non-deterministically failed the automated runs. These samples were rerun individually to ensure successful completion.
