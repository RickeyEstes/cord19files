has gained considerable attention through its role in the aetidogy of bovine abortion. Ihre to its close phylognetic relationship with Toxoplasma gondii, respective unequivocal differentiaI diagnosis deserves special consideration. In order to evaluate the diagnostic performance of molecular and insmunodiagnosric te&n@es and to provide insights into the epidemiological significance of bovine neosporosis in Switzerland, we aondu&ed a sQ# on 83 cases of bovine abortion: of these, 24 (29%) foetal brains were positive by Neospora-FCR, six of these fo%Wses were simultaneously seropositive in Neospora-IFAT and/or somatic antigen-ELISA. Converseiy, four (5%)feMal k&s were considered positive by Toxoplasma-PCR, two of which were also seropositive in the Toxu@zs~~-P%J-~L~~A and/or direct agglutination test. The seroprevalence in 1689 cattle sera obtained from 113 dairy farms was 11.3% (95% confidence interval: 9.2-13.8) by Neospora-somatic antigen-ELISA and 10.7% (95% confidence interval: U-12.6) by Toxopkrma-P30-ELISA. From the same samples, l.l%, less than statistically expected, were positive in bo6h BUSA. Within selected groups of cow-calf farms, the seroprevalence determined using the Neospora-somatic anwn-ELBA was 14% (95% confidence interval: U-23.0) for darns and 15% (95% confidence interval: 3.0-28,O) for ~a~~~~a~ves. Seroprevalences detetmined by Toxoplasma-P30-ELISA were 8% (95% confidence interval: 4.0-12.0) for dams and 3% (95% confidence interval: 0.3-6.0) for calves. None of the sera gave a positive reaction in both ELISA. Oar data indicated that prenatal neosporosis appears as an important cause of bovine abortion in Switzerland. 8 199S Australian Society for Parasitology. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.
