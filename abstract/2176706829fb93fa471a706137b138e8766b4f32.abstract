Cyclosporin A (CsA) ~ is a potent reversible immunosuppressive agent which is able to suppress allograft rejection and acute allogeneic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1-7). Although CsA dramatically improves survival after allogeneic marrow transplantation, rats treated with a short course of CsA develop delayed onset GVHD after CsA withdrawal. This paper presents new evidence which indicates that GVHD may develop upon CsA withdrawal following not only allogeneic but also syngeneic and even autologous bone marrow reconstitution. Rats. Lewis female RT1 ~ rats, 6-8 wk old, were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN. Radiation. Lewis rats were irradiated on day -1 (1,020 rad) at 120 rad/min from a dual source Cs ~3~ small animal irradiator (Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., Ottawa, Ontario). Leg-shielded rats were then anesthetized with chloral hydrate, their right tibias shielded with a lead doughnut 1.5 cm thick and 2.5 cm long, and irradiated with 1,020 rad. Marrow Transplantation. Donor marrow from tibias, femurs, and humeri was sus-7 pended at 6 Ã— 10 nucleated cells/ml in Hanks' solution supplemented with 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 ng/ml streptomycin. On day 0 rats received 1 ml via the tail vein. Antibiotics. Rats received medicated drinking water supplemented with bactrim, neomycin, and polymyxin B and were given 2.5 mg/kg gentamycin per day subcutaneously for 20 d. Rats that developed overt clinical infections were routinely sacrificed and excluded from the study. Cyclosporin A. CsA was the generous gift of Sandoz, Inc., Hanover, NJ. Emulphor EL-620 was obtained from GAF Corp., New York. Powdered CsA was dissolved in absolute ethanol, added to emulphor, and mixed with water to yield a final emulphor concentration of 5%. Rats were weighed daily and received 1 ml/100 g body weight per day subcutaneously from day 0 to 40 or as indicated. Assessment of GVHD. Rats were examined daily for signs of clinical GVHD such as red ears, dermatitis, or diarrhea. Skin biopsies were taken at frequent intervals. When rats developed severe clinical GVHD characterized by weight loss, hunched appearance, and extensive dermatitis they were sacrificed and autopsied. Previously described criteria were
