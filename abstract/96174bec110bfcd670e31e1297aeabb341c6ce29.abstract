Summarv: Airway mucus hypersecretion occurs in response to infection and irritation and poses an import-ant and poorly understood clinical problem. In order to gain insight into its pathogenesis, we have focused on an mRNA encoding the major mucus glycoprotein, mucin. Northern blots showed that mucin mRNA was abundant in the intestine of specific pathogen free rats whereas it was undetectable in the airways of these rats until pathogen-free conditions were suspended and rats acquired Sendal (Parainfluenza I) virus infections. Airway mucin hybridization signals in rats that were both infected with Sendai virus and exposed to SO2 were more intense than those in rats with infection alone. These results suggest that pathogen-and irritant-induced hypersecretion may be partly controlled at the level ofmucin mRNA. Mucus hypersecretion is a common response of the pulmonary airways to infection or injury and is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, and asthma [1]. In these conditions, excessive mucus accumulates in the air passages, compromising airflow to the lung, causing respiratory insufficiency, and sometimes death [2], [3], [4] . The pathophysiology of hyperseeretion is likely to involve abnormalities at control points regulating the production of the major mucus glycoprotein, mucin. These abnormalities could occur at the level of transcription, processing, or stability of RNA transcripts, as well as translation, processing, or stability of the protein. Some of the most common mechanisms modulating protein biosynthesis act by regulating RNA steady state, either by altering the transcription or degradation rate of specific mRNAs [5] . To determine whether mucin mRNA steady state varies under conditions of infection and irritation, we monitored airway mucin mRNA steady state by Northern blot in specific pathogen-flee (SPF) rats, rats acquiring respiratory tract infections, and rats exposed to the irritant SO2. The results clearly showed that airway mucin mRNA steady state increases in the presence of infection and irritation. A preliminary report has appeared [6].
