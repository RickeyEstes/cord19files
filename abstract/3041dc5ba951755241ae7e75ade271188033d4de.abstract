Ribophorins I and II are type I transmembrane glycoproteins of the ER that are segregated to the rough domains of this organelle. Both ribophorins appear to be part of the translocation apparatus for nascent polypeptides that is associated with membranebound ribosomes and participate in the formation of a proteinaceous network within the ER membrane that also includes other components of the translocation apparatus. The ribophorins are both highly stable proteins that lack O-linked sugars but each contains one high mannose N-linked oligosaccharide that remains endo H sensitive throughout their lifetimes. We have previously shown (Tsao, Y. S., N. E. Ivessa, M. Adesnik, D. D. Sabatini, and G. Kreibich. 1992. J. Cell Biol. 116:57-67) that a COOHterminally truncated variant of ribophorin I that contains only the first 332 amino acids of the luminal domain (RI3a2), when synthesized in permanent transformants of HeLa cells, undergoes a rapid degradation with biphasic kinetics in the ER itself and in a second, as yet unidentified nonlysosomal pre-Golgi compartment. We now show that in cells treated with brefeldin A (BFA) RI332 molecules undergo rapid O-glycosylation in a multistep process that involves the 9 The Rockefeller University Press, Cultures of HeLa-RI332 cells were fixed first in the dishes with 2% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and after scraping the cells were left in this fixative for a total of 2 h. Samples were stored overnight in 0.1 M sodium caeodylatr buffer and processed for cryomicrotomy and immunolabeling, essentially as described by Tokuyasu (1980) with minor modifications (Ivanov et al., 1984; De Lemos-Chiarandini et al., 1987) . Lectin labeling with WGA or RCA was carried out as described by Caiffiths et al. (1982), using anti-lectin antibodies and protein A-gold (5-ram-diameter). Sections infused with LR White acrylic resin (Keller et al., 1984) were examined with a Philips 301 electron microscope operated at 60 kV.
