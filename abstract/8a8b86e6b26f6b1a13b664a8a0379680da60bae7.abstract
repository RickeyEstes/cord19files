Early and accurate diagnosis of late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS) is a major diagnostic challenge in neonatology. 1,2 LONS occurs most frequently in preterm and very low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants and in newborns with surgical conditions that require prolonged parenteral nutrition and hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A recent multicenter survey suggests that more than one-fifth (21%) of VLBW infants have at least 1 episode of late-onset culture-proven sepsis. 2 To date, clinical differentiation between LONS, including septicemia, meningitis, and systemic infection/inflammation (eg, necrotizing enterocolitis [NEC]), and noninfectious conditions (eg, acute exacerbation of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, apnea of prematurity, and gastrointestinal dysmotility) remains difficult, if not impossible, at an early stage of the illness. 1,3 A test or biomarker, which can accurately identify active infection/inflammation including septicemia and NEC in these vulnerable patients, would provide invaluable information for diagnosis and management. This review focuses on (1) the properties of an ''ideal'' diagnostic marker (or panel of biomarkers) of infection, (2) different categories of inflammatory mediators, such as acute phase proteins, chemokines, cytokines, and cell-surface antigens, that could potentially be used as clinical biomarkers, and (3) the use of molecular and biogenetic techniques for identification of pathogens in sterile body fluids. The authors also discuss recent scientific advances to search for novel biomarkers of infection in newborns. The authors have previously proposed a set of clinical and laboratory criteria to assist neonatologists in identifying the ideal diagnostic marker of infection. 1 Although the Financial disclosure: The authors do not have any financial disclosure.
