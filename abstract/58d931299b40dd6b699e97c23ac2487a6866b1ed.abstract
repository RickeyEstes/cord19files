Background Approximately 15.5 million deaths from cardiovascular diseases occur every year. About half are due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and 80% occur in low-and middle-income countries. Therefore, low-cost therapies would be invaluable. Although glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) infusion and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) appear to be promising in AMI, the available trials are inconclusive and these treatments require rigorous evaluation. Evaluation-Estudios Clínicos Latino America (CREATE-ECLA) study is a randomized controlled trial in ST-elevation AMI patients evaluating a 24-hour infusion of Glucose-Insulin-Potassium (GIK) intravenous vs usual care (control) on 30-day mortality in 20 000 patients from 21 countries. Patients from India and China (n ϭ 15 000) are also randomized using a factorial design to receive low-molecular-weight heparin (Reviparin) or placebo injection twice daily for 7 days to assess the impact on the composite outcomes of death, reinfarction or stroke (first co-primary outcome) or the composite ϩ refractory ischemia (second co-primary outcome). Twenty thousand two hundred and one (20,201) GIK/control patients and 15,570 Reviparin/placebo patients have been included, with results expected in November 2004. The CREATE-ECLA trial will provide definitive answers to the role of 2 practical, promising and lowcost therapies, LMWH and GIK, in AMI patients. If effective, these therapies could be used in small medical centers in low-and middle-income countries. The experiences in this trial indicate that large trials of important questions can be successfully conducted in resource-poor settings, by academic groups without industry involvement.

Approximately 15.5 million deaths from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) occur every year. 1 Of these, about half are due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and over 80% of these occur in low-and middle-income countries (LIC and MIC), especially in the Indian subcontinent and China.
