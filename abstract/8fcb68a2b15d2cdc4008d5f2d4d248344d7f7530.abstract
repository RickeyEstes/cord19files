Highly virulent strains of Clostridium diffi cile have emerged since 2003, causing large outbreaks of severe, often fatal, colitis in North America and Europe. In 2008-10, virulent strains spread between continents, with the fi rst reported cases of fl uoroquinolone-resistant C diffi cile PCR ribotype 027 in three Asia-Pacifi c countries and Central America. We present a risk assessment framework for assessing risks of further worldwide spread of this pathogen. This framework fi rst requires identifi cation of potential vehicles of introduction, including international transfers of hospital patients, international tourism and migration, and trade in livestock, associated commodities, and foodstuff s. It then calls for assessment of the risks of pathogen release, of exposure of individuals if release happens, and of resulting outbreaks. Health departments in countries unaff ected by outbreaks should assess the risk of introduction or reintroduction of C diffi cile PCR ribotype 027 using a structured risk-assessment approach.
