On the basis of our previous study on antiviral agents against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, a series of nucleoside analogues whose 5 0 -hydroxyl groups are masked by various protective groups such as carboxylate, sulfonate, and ether were synthesized and evaluated to develop novel anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) agents. Among these, several 5 0 -O-masked analogues of 6-chloropurine-2 0 -deoxyriboside (e.g., 5 0 -O-benzoyl, 5 0 -O-p-methoxybenzoyl, and 5 0 -O-benzyl analogues) were found to exhibit effective anti-HCV activity. In particular, the 5 0 -O-benzoyl analogue exhibited the highest potency with an EC 50 of 6.1 lM in a cell-based HCV replicon assay. Since the 5 0 -O-unmasked analogue (i.e., 6-chloropurine-2 0 -deoxyriboside) was not sufficiently potent (EC 50 = 47.2 lM), masking of the 5 0 -hydroxyl group seems to be an effective method for the development of anti-HCV agents. Presently, we hypothesize two roles for the 5 0 -O-masked analogues: One is the role as an anti-HCV agent by itself, and the other is as a prodrug of its 5 0 -O-demasked (deprotected) derivative.
