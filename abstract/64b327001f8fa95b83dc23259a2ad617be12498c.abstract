One unexplored aspect of HIV-1 genetic architecture is how codon choice influences 27 population diversity and evolvability. Here we compared the development of HIV-1 28 resistance to protease inhibitors (PIs) between wild-type (WT) virus and a synthetic 29 virus (MAX) carrying a codon-pair re-engineered protease sequence including 38 (13%) 30 synonymous mutations. WT and MAX viruses showed indistinguishable replication in 31 MT-4 cells or PBMCs. Both viruses were subjected to serial passages in MT-4 cells 32 with selective pressure from the PIs atazanavir (ATV) and darunavir (DRV). After 32 33 successive passages, both the WT and MAX viruses developed phenotypic resistance to 34 PIs (IC 50 14.6 ± 5.3 and 21.2 ± 9 nM for ATV, and 5. 9 ± 1.0 and 9.3 ± 1.9 for DRV, 35 respectively). Ultra-deep sequence clonal analysis revealed that both viruses harbored 36 previously described resistance mutations to ATV and DRV. However, the WT and 37 MAX virus proteases showed different resistance variant repertoires, with the G16E and 38 V77I substitutions observed only in WT, and the L33F, S37P, G48L, Q58E/K, and L89I 39 substitutions detected only in MAX. Remarkably, G48L and L89I are rarely found in 40 vivo in PI-treated patients. The MAX virus showed significantly higher nucleotide and 41 amino acid diversity of the propagated viruses with and without PIs (P < 0.0001), 42 suggesting higher selective pressure for change in this recoded virus. Our results 43 indicate that HIV-1 protease position in sequence space delineates the evolution of its 44 mutant spectra. Nevertheless, the investigated synonymously recoded variant showed 45 mutational robustness and evolvability similar to the WT virus. 46 47 IMPORTANCE 48 Large-scale synonymous recoding of virus genomes is a new tool for exploring various 49 aspects of virus biology.

In this study, we evaluated how synonymous recoding of 52 the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease impacts the development of 53 protease inhibitor (PI) resistance. HIV-1 protease is a main target of current 54 antiretroviral therapies. Our present results demonstrate that the wild-type (WT) virus 55 and the virus with the recoded protease exhibited different patterns of resistance 56 mutations after PI treatment. Nevertheless, the developed PI resistance phenotype was 57 indistinguishable between the recoded virus and the WT virus, suggesting that the 58 synonymously recoded protease HIV-1 and the WT protease virus were equally robust 59 and evolvable.
