Acute kidney injury Acute respiratory distress syndrome Angiotensin Angiotensin-converting enzyme Sepsis Inflammation Septic shock Renin Activation of the endocrine renin-angiotensin system (RAS) cascade induces immediate metabolic, hemodynamic, and renal responses, in response to changes in blood pressure and homeostasis. Renin and angiotensin II are upregulated in the setting of sepsis and septic shock. Higher renin and angiotensin II and lower circulating angiotensin-converting enzyme levels are associated with worse survival. Classic and nonclassic RASs modulate the inflammatory and immune responses. The angiotensin II axis stimulates a proinflammatory beneficial antibacterial response. In patients with vasoplegic shock, the infusion of exogenous angiotensin II lowers vasopressor requirements, and improves renal-related outcomes. Experimental evidence supports the direct role of classic RAS in the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome, whereas clinical data suggest a lung protective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 administration.
