Most emerging pathogens can infect multiple species, underscoring the importance of 33 understanding the ecological and evolutionary factors that allow some hosts to harbor greater 34 infection prevalence and share pathogens with other species. However, our understanding of 35 pathogen jumps is primarily based around viruses, despite bacteria accounting for the greatest 36 proportion of zoonoses. Because bacterial pathogens in bats (Order: Chiroptera) can have 37 conservation and human health consequences, studies that examine the ecological and 38 evolutionary drivers of bacterial prevalence and barriers to pathogen sharing are crucially 39 needed. We here studied hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. (i.e., hemoplasmas) across a species-rich 40 bat community in Belize over two years. Across 469 bats spanning 33 species, half of individuals 41 and two-thirds of species were hemoplasma positive. Infection prevalence was higher for males 42 and for species with larger body mass and colony sizes. Hemoplasmas displayed high genetic 43 diversity (21 novel genotypes) and strong host specificity. Evolutionary patterns supported co-44 divergence of bats and bacterial genotypes alongside phylogenetically constrained host shifts. 45 Bat species centrality to the network of shared hemoplasma genotypes was phylogenetically 46 clustered and unrelated to prevalence, further suggesting rare-but detectable-bacterial sharing 47 between species. Our study highlights the importance of using fine phylogenetic scales when 48 assessing host specificity and suggests phylogenetic similarity may play a key role in host shifts 49 for not only viruses but also bacteria. Such work more broadly contributes to increasing efforts to 50 understand cross-species transmission and epidemiological consequences of bacterial pathogens. 51
