The effects of a range of metallopeptidase inhibitors on the activities of the porcine kidney cell surface zinc aminopeptidases, aminopeptidase A (AP-A; EC 3.4.11.2), aminopeptidase N (AP-N; EC 3.4.11.7) and aminopeptidase W (AP-W; EC 3.4.11.16). have been directly compared. Amastatin and probestin were effective against all three aminopeptidases, with the eon~entration of inhibitor required to cause 50% inhibition (iso) in the low micromolar range (I~~ = 1.5-20 @M), except for probestin with AP-N which displayed an I 5o of 50 nM. Actinonin failed to inhibit significantly either AP-A or AP-W, and thus can be considered a relatively selective inhibitor (I~" = 2.0 PM) of AP-N. In contrast, bestatin was a relatively poor inhibitor of AP-N (I~" = 89 PM) and failed to inhibit AP-A, but was more potent towards AP-W (1~0 = 7.9 PM). Thus, some of the observed chemotherapeutic actions of bestatin may be due to inhibition of cell-surface AP-W. A number of other metallopeptidase inhibitors, including inhibitors of endopeptidase-24.11 {EC 3.4.24.11) and membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.11), and the carboxyiaIky1 and phospho~l inhibitors of an~otensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) failed to inhibit significantly AP-A, AP-N or AP-W. However, AP-W was inhibited with lzo values in the micromolar range by the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors rentiapril (I~,, = 1.6 PM),
