Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are zoonotic pathogens that originated in wild animals. HCoVs have large genomes that encode a fixed array of structural and nonstructural components, as well as a variety of accessory proteins that differ in number and sequence even among closely related CoVs. Thus, in addition to recombination and mutation, HCoV genomes evolve through gene gains and losses. In this review we summarize recent findings on the molecular evolution of HCoV genomes, with special attention to recombination and adaptive events that generated new viral species and contributed to host shifts and to HCoV emergence. Video Abstract The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and of Middle East respiratory syndrome-related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae) as dangerous zoonoses stirred great interest in the ecology and evolution of coronaviruses. Before the SARS-CoV epidemic only two HCoVs were known: HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. Two additional HCoVs, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, were discovered in 2004-2005 from clinical specimens [1]. These viruses originated in animals and are mainly responsible for respiratory diseases in humans ( Figure 1A , Key Figure) . Specifically, all HCoVs are thought to have a bat origin, with the exception of lineage A beta-CoVs, which may have reservoirs in rodents [2] . The phylogenetic relationships of HCoVs and other animal CoVs mentioned in this review are summarized in Figure 1A .
