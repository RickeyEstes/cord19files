Sarcoidosis is an incurable, chronic granulomatous disease primarily involving the lungs and lymph nodes of unknown etiology, treated with non-specific antiinflammatory/immunosuppressive drugs. Persistently symptomatic patients worsen with a disabling, potentially fatal clinical course. To determine a possible infectious cause, we correlated in a case control study clinical information with the presence of bacterial DNA in sarcoidosis mediastinal lymph nodes compared to control lymph nodes resected during cancer surgery. We retrospectively studied formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, mediastinal lymph nodes from 30 sarcoidosis patients and 30 control lung cancer patients. Nucleic acids were extracted from nodes, were evaluated by rRNA PCR for bacterial 16S rDNA, and the result was sequenced and compared to a bacterial sequence library. Clinical information was correlated. : 11/30 (36.7%) of lymph nodes from sarcoidosis patients had detectable bacterial DNA, significantly more than control patient lymph nodes (2/30, 6.7%), p = 0.00516. At presentation, 19/30 (63.3%) sarcoidosis patients were symptomatic including all patients with detectable bacterial DNA. Radiographically, there were 18 Stage I and 12 Stage II patients. All Stage II patients were symptomatic and 75% had PCR-detectable bacteria. After a mean followup of 52.8 + 32.8 months, all patients with PCR-detectable bacteria were persistently symptomatic requiring treatment. DISCUSSION: 36.6% of sarcoidosis patients had detectable bacteria DNA on presentation, all were quite symptomatic, and most were radiographically-advanced stage II patients. These findings suggest bacterial DNA-positive, symptomatic patients have more aggressive
