Many of these RBPs localize several mRNAs and may have additional direct interaction partners to regulate their functions. Using immunoprecipitation from whole Drosophila ovaries coupled to mass spectrometry, we examined protein-protein associations of 6 GFP-tagged RBPs expressed at physiological levels. Analysis of the interaction network and further validation in human cells allowed us to identify 26 previously unknown associations, besides recovering several well characterized interactions. We identified interactions between RBPs and several splicing factors, providing links between nuclear and cytoplasmic events of mRNA regulation. Additionally, components of the translational and RNA decay machineries were selectively co-purified with some baits, suggesting a mechanism for how RBPs may regulate maternal transcripts. Given the evolutionary conservation of the studied RBPs, the interaction network presented here provides the foundation for future functional and structural studies of mRNA localization across metazoans. : bioRxiv preprint Interactome of RNA Binding Proteins from Drosophila ovaries 5 consistent with the role of their mammalian homologs (38, 50-52). During early oogenesis, both Vas and Nos are involved in the maintenance of germline stem cells, in oocyte differentiation and other aspects of oocyte development (26, 35, 53-56). In embryos, Nos functions in germline development (53, 57-61) and further promotes the inclusion of germline cells in the developing ovary (53, 62). In addition to oogenic processes, Nos and Stau are also involved in the development of the Drosophila nervous system (63, 64). Many RBPs in Drosophila oogenesis have overlapping functions that are likely differentially regulated. Little is known about this regulation and it may involve several as yet unidentified mRNP components. To comprehensively identify RBP interactors, we carried out a systematic in vivo purification screen of GFPtagged RBPs coupled with mass spectrometry. We employed both labeled and label-free MS methods and identified several proteins significantly enriched with the purified RBPs. The interactomes of the individual RBPs were largely independent with some overlap. Our screen identified several previously unknown interactions, many of which we validated in vitro. This work presents an extended interaction network of RBPs in Drosophila, offering a new reference point for future functional and structural studies of mRNA localization. Experimental procedures Cloning and DNA constructs For cloning purposes, total RNA was extracted from wild-type ovaries using TRI-Reagent (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed using Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MuLV) reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), in the presence of oligo (dT)15 primers. To express proteins in human HEK293 cells, genes of interest were amplified from Drosophila cDNA, or in some cases from the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center (DGRC) clones, using the standard PCR conditions. Accession numbers of all the genes cloned are provided in Table S1. Fragments were cloned into mammalian expression vectors based on pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), bearing an N-terminal EGFP tag or modified to contain either HA or HA-Flag tags (provided by Elisa Izaurralde, MPI Tübingen). Full-length cDNAs were cloned, except for protein Nucampholin (Ncm), where a sequence encoding amino acids 359-664 was amplified. The boundaries were designed based on the MIF4G domain of the human ortholog CWC22, which has been shown to bind eIF4AIII (65). To serve as a control, either MBP or EGFP alone was used. : bioRxiv preprint Interactome of RNA Binding Proteins from Drosophila ovaries 6 Drosophila stocks All flies were kept at room temperature on standard Drosophila medium. Oregon R flies were used as wildtype. Fosmid lines expressing GFP-tagged proteins were purchased from the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center (VDRC 318283, 318719, 318195, 318157, 318898, 318766), as previously published (66). To generate the control fly line expressing the tag only, the tag sequence was cloned in a modified pUAST-attB vector (67) (without UAS sites or SV40 poly(A) signal), downstream of a moderately expressing exu promoter using KpnI and BamHI sites. The purified vector was injected into embryos from a recombinant stock with a genotype y[1] M{vas-int.Dm} ZH-2A w[*]; PBac{y[+]-attP-3B}VK00033 (BDSC 24871). Transgenic flies were identified in the F1 generation by the presence of red eyes (dsRed) and a stable fly line was established. Cell culture and co-IP from HEK cells Human HEK293 cells were grown in standard Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum, Glutamine and Penicillin-Streptomycin solution, at 37 ºC in the presence of 5% CO2. For co-immunoprecipitations (co-IP), transfections were carried out in six-well plates with Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Typically, 5 μg of DNA was transfected in each well and the ratio of two plasmids was adjusted based on their expression levels. If required, a third empty plasmid with HA tag was supplemented, to reach a total amount of 5 μg. Cells were collected 2 days after transfection and washed with PBS prior to lysis. Cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 at 4 ºC, 100 mM NaCl, 250 mM Sucrose, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitors (cOmplete™, EDTA-free Protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche). For efficient lysis, cells were mechanically sheared by passing them through a needle (Sterican 21G 7/8" Ø 0.8X22mm) several times. Cell lysates were cleared at 16,000g for 15 min at 4 ºC and supernatants were supplemented with 5 µl/ ml of RNase A/T1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at 4 ºC. After clearing the lysate again at 16,000g for 15 min, 12-20 µl of GFP-TRAP MA beads (Chromotek) were added to the supernatant and the mixtures were rotated for 1 hour at 4 ºC. For Flag pull-downs, 1.8 µg of monoclonal anti-Flag (Sigma #F1804) was added to the supernatant, post RNase treatment. After 1 hour at 4 ºC in rotation, 20 µl of GammaBind Plus Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were added, and the mixtures were rotated for an additional hour at 4 ºC. Beads were washed with lysis buffer and proteins were eluted in sample buffer by boiling at 95 ºC for 10 min.
