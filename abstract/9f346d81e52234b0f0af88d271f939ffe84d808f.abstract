Prior to diving into the various aspects of building a travel risk management (TRM) program in the subsequent chapters, the purpose of this chapter will be to broaden your perception of why each and every company must address TRM at some level. The chapter begins with the corporate obligation of "duty of care" and what that means at a fundamental level, and then provides examples of different kinds of risks that companies should think about and implement plans to address. There are an infinite number of potential use cases for risk exposure to travelers, but these examples provide good food for thought, in particular to those companies whose knee-jerk reactions to creating a TRM program is typically comments about their not necessarily needing one because they don't believe that they travel to high-risk destinations, which is a farce. As you will learn throughout this text, risk exposure is not always directly related to the risk rating of a particular destination as provided by risk intelligence providers. It can also be about risks that are specific to a traveler, their behavior and any number of other factors, some of which may be foreseeable, and some not. This information is important, but in the absence of a moderate to high risk rating, there is still the potential for an individual or widespread crisis that can affect groups of people and even an entire company. Subsequent chapters will delve into greater detail on some more common risk factors, along with case studies and precedents.
