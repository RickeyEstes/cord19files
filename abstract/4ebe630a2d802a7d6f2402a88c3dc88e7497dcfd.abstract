Highlights d ENDU-2 nuclease regulates nucleotide metabolism and germ cell proliferation in worms d ENDU-2 expression is induced by nucleotide imbalance and other genotoxic stresses d ENDU-2 inhibits CTP synthase phosphorylation by repressing PKA and HDA-1 in the gut d ENDU-2 function may be conserved in mammalian cells
