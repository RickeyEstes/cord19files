The purpose of this study was to detect porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) subclinically infected pigs shipped from non-case farms to slaughterhouses. Systematic sampling was conducted at two slaughterhouses. A total of 1,556 blood samples were collected from 80 case and non-case farms from pigs over 6 months old. Blood samples were centrifuged to obtain sera. Serial serum dilutions were subjected to serological examination for PEDV presence using Neutralization test (NT). The cut-off titer was set at titer of 1:2 dilution and farms with at least one positive sample in duplicate were classified as PED-positive farms. Several non-case farms (9.4%, 6/64) and 100% (16/16) of the case farms were indeed positive for PEDV. The proportion of seropositive animals from case farms was 63.7%, significantly different from that of non-case farms (4.3%, P<0.05). In both case and non-case farms, the proportion of seropositive animals in farrow-to-finish farms was significantly higher than in wean-to-finish farms (P<0.05). Seropositive animals in non-case farms were detected by NT in a sero-survey by sampling at slaughterhouses. Therefore, subclinically infected pigs should be considered prior to shipment. KEY WORDS: passive surveillance, porcine epidemic diarrhea, subclinical infection, swine Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, causes acute diarrhea and dehydration in piglets, among which mortality rate can reach up to 100% [5, 16] . PEDV results in significant economic losses due to the high morbidity and mortality in neonatal piglets [1, 2, 10, 11, 17, 21] . There is an age-dependent resistance to pathogenic PEDV infection in pigs [15] , where 2-and 7-day-old pigs inoculated with PEDV developed severe diarrhea and died. On the other hand, 2and 4-week-old pigs presented with mild diarrhea and survived after inoculation with PEDV. The 8-and 12-week-old pigs did not show any clinical signs, but antibody against PEDV were detected by Neutralization test (NT) and immunofluorescence assay [15] . The virus was first identified in the United Kingdom in 1971 [20] and is now widespread throughout the United States, Canada, and many Asian countries including Japan. In Japan, PED cases were first observed in 1982 [18] and only sporadic cases were reported between 1997 and 2006, with no cases were reported from 2007 to 2012 [9] . However, large-scale PED outbreaks occurred during 2013-2015. Over 800 infected farms were identified in 38 out of 47 prefectures, resulting in at least 40,000 mortal cases, predominantly in piglets [8, 9] . Out of these cases, over 40% were confirmed in Kyushu island which possesses the largest
