Epitope (determinant) spreading is the development of immune responses to endogenous epitopes secondary to the release of self antigens during a chronic autoimmune or inflammatory response. The past year has seen considerable advances in our understanding of the contribution of epitope spreading to the chronic pathogenesis of experimental T-cell-mediated and antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. Most significantly, conclusive functional evidence for a major role for epitope spreading in the chronic pathogenesis of murine relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a CD4 + T-cell-mediated model of multiple sclerosis, was forthcoming. antigen-presenting cell BCR B cell receptor CNS central nervous system DTH delayed-type hypersensitivity EAE experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis GAD glutamic acid decarboxylase MBP myelin basic protein NOD nonobese diabetic PLP proteolipid protein R-EAE relapsing-remitting EAE SLE systemic lupus erythematosus TCR T cell receptor TNF tumor necrosis factor
