25 Nutritional stress, and especially a dearth of pollen, is considered an important factor associated 26 with honey bee colony losses. We used pollen-restricted colonies as a model to study the 27 nutritional stress conditions experienced in colonies within intensively cultivated agricultural 28 areas. This model was complemented by the establishment of an experimental design, which 29 allowed us to uncouple the effect of nutrition, behavior and age in colonies of similar size and 30 demography. We used this system to determine the effect of pollen restriction on workers' 31 behavioral development. Then, we analyzed the effect of nutritional stress, behavior and age on 32 the expression of key physiological genes involved in the regulation of division of labor. Finally, 33 we analyzed the effects of these variables on the expression of immune genes and the titers of 34 honey bee viruses. Our results show that pollen restriction led to an increased number of 35 precocious foragers and this behavioral transition was associated with important changes in the 36 expression of nutritionally regulated physiological genes, immunity and viral titers. Vitellogenin 37 (vg) and major royal jelly protein 1 (mrjp1) were the most predictive markers of nutrition and 38 behavior. The expression of immune genes was primarily affected by behavior, with higher levels 39 in foragers. Deformed wing virus (DWV) titers were significantly affected by behavior and 40 nutritional status, with higher titer in foragers and increased levels associated with pollen 41 ingestion. Correlation analyses support the predominant effect of behavior on immunity and 42 susceptibility to viral infection, revealing that both immune genes and DWV exhibited strong 43 negative correlations with genes associated with nursing, but positive correlations with genes 44 associated with foraging. Our results provide valuable insights into the physiological mechanisms 45 by which nutritional stress induce precocious foraging and increased susceptibility to viral 46 infections. 48 Approximately 35-40% of the world's crop production comes from plant species that depend on 49 animal pollination [1] which is carried out primarily by honey bees [2]. However, populations of 50 honey bees have experienced a severe decline during recent years worldwide [3, 4]. Possible 51 causes for colony losses have been proposed, including the effects of pesticides [5], nutritional 52 stress [6-8], the parasitic mite Varroa destructor [9, 10] and synergistic interactions between 53 Varroa and honey bee viruses [11]. However, none of these independent factors is consistently 54 associated with colony losses to suggest a single causal agent [3]. Thus, colony losses are likely 55 the result of the combination of several underlying factors [12, 13]. 56 57 There are several lines of evidence indicating that nutritional stress is an important contributing 58 factor for colony losses. First, there is a positive relationship between the area of uncultivated 59 forage land surrounding an apiary and annual colony survival [6, 8] suggesting that habitat loss 60 play a significant role in honeybee colony losses. Second, at individual levels, honey bees from 61 colonies kept in areas of high cultivation exhibited decreased levels of physiological biomarkers 62 associated with nutrition compared with bees kept in areas of low cultivation [7, 14], 63 demonstrating that availability of floral resources affects the nutritional state of honey bees. 64 65 Habitat loss associated with increased use of monocultures reduces both the quality (diversity of 66 plant sources) and the quantity of the pollen collected by the bees [15]. Simultaneous flowering in 67 monocultures provide pollen for a restricted period, and hives surrounded by monocultures 68 presumably experience pollen dearth before and after this period. Pollen is the main source of 69 proteins and lipids for honey bees [16, 17] and pollen from different plants differ in amino acid 70 content [18, 19] and fatty acids [20]. Thus, the consumption of pollen from diverse plant sources 71 increases the probability of obtaining the set of nutritional components (e.g., essential amino 4 72 acids and fatty acids) required for balanced nutrition. 73 74 Plasticity is a key feature of honey bee behavioral development [21], which is important for 75 understanding the consequences of nutritional stress on colony health and fitness. In the honey 76 bee, as in other eusocial insects, behavioral division of labor in workers is initially age-dependent 77 [21, 22]. Under typical spring and summer conditions in temperate climates, honey bee lifespan is 78 approximately one month. During the first two to three weeks of adult life, workers perform tasks 79 in the hive such as brood care ("nursing"); while in the last one to two weeks of life, workers 80 forage for food outside the colony [23, 24]. However, honey bee behavioral development is 81 flexible and can be accelerated or delayed according to colony demography and as an adaptive 82 response to different challenges [21]. In particular, the timing of nurse to forager transition is 83 normally accelerated in response to diverse types of stressors, including diseases [25] and 84 malnutrition [26]. 85 86 Interactions among key elements of the extended insulin/insulin-like growth signaling/target of 87 rapamycin (IIS/TOR) pathway including vitellogenin (Vg), juvenile hormone (JH) and insulin-88 like peptides (ILPs), regulate important physiological processes in honey bees, including 89 behavioral division of labor [27-31]. Vg is a yolk protein highly expressed in the fat bodies [29], 90 secreted into the hemolymph and then imported by developing oocytes [32]. JH, one of the major 91 insect hormones, is synthesized in the corpora allata in a final reaction catabolized by the enzyme 92 methyl farnesoate epoxidase (MFE) [33]. There are two genes encoding insulin genes (ilp1 and 93 ilp2) in the honey bee genome [34], which are expressed in several tissues and organs including 94 the brain and fat bodies [27, 29, 30]. In workers, negative interactions among vg with JH and 95 insulin like peptides are associated with task performance: while vg levels are higher in nurses 96 compared with foragers [29, 35-37], JH titers [21, 36, 38, 39] brain ilp1 and fat body ilp2 mRNA 5 97 levels follow an opposite pattern [27, 29, 30]. Experimental manipulations showed that these 98 correlations reveal causative positive and negative interactions among these three regulatory 99 elements. Thus, JH treatments inhibit vg expression [35, 40], but induce higher brain ilp1 levels 100 [29] and precocious foraging [21, 41]. Consistently, experimental reduction of vg by RNA 101 interference also result in higher levels of JH [27] and precocious foraging [28]. 102 103 In recent years, the proposal that nutrition is an important factor regulating the division of labor 104 among social insects has received increased support [26, 30, 42-46]. Pollen consumption is low in 105 young bees, largest in about 9-day-old nurses and then declines to minimal amounts in foragers 106 [47], which rely primarily on honey intake. Cage experiments showed that 6-day-old workers 107 eating pollen and sugar have higher abdominal vg and low brain ilp1 levels, while same-age bees 108 fed with only sugar had the inverse pattern [30]; resembling the expression profiles observed in 109 colony-reared nurses and foragers, respectively [29]. The effect of pollen on behavioral 110 development could result from its protein content. In support of this view, it has been shown that 111 increased levels of hemolymph amino acids, induced by protein injection, resulted in high vg 112 mRNA levels and delayed foraging [27]. Additionally, lipid metabolism also has been involved 113 in nutritional regulation of division of labor. Lipid content closely correlates with task 114 performance, being higher in nurses compared to foragers [43]. Feeding of an inhibitor of fatty 115 acid synthesis (TOFA) induced precocious foraging [48], further supporting a role of lipids on 116 the regulation of division of labor. However, it remains to be tested whether supplementary lipids 117 (e.g., essential fatty acids) have an effect on the nutritional regulation of this process. 118 119 Since genes that regulate behavioral division of labor are nutritionally regulated, they could be 120 expected to be ideal biomarkers of both nutritional and behavioral state in cage as well as colony-121 level studies. Progressive evidence is revealing that behavioral and nutritional states influence 6 122 honey bee immunity and susceptibility to pathogens. Thus, the use of reliable markers for these 123 traits can also facilitate effective disease diagnosis. Indeed, the initial use of vg as a predictive 124 marker of colony losses [49] and colony nutritional state [14] provides a promising starting point 125 toward this direction. 126 127 Although insects lack an acquired immunity, they have developed an efficient innate immune 128 system against a broad variety of pathogens [50]. Innate immunity has been traditionally divided 129 into humoral and cellular responses, but there are complex interactions and no clearly defined 130 boundaries between both types of immune responses [51]. Four main gene pathways mediate 131 insect innate immunity: Toll, IMD, JNK and JAK/ STAT, which include elements implicated in 132 both the humoral and cellular immune responses and belong to gene families involved in 133 signaling, pathogen recognition and effector functions [52, 53]. 134 135 Humoral immune responses are mainly associated with antimicrobial effectors belonging to the 136 Toll pathway such as abaecin [54], defensin1 (def1) [55] and hymenoptaecin (hym) [56]. On the 137 other hand, cellular immunity is mediated by haemocytes and involves responses including 138 phagocytosis, nodulation and encapsulation [57] While phagocytosis is mediated by pathogen 139 recognition proteins (e.g., peptidoglycan recognition proteins L and S) [58] and transmembrane 140 proteins such as eater [59], nodulation and encapsulation are often accompanied by melanization, 141 a process catalyzed by the pro-phenoloxidase (PPO) and pro-phenoloxidase activator (PPOact) 142 enzymes [52, 60, 61]. 143 144 Different studies have revealed interactions among nutrition, immunity and physiological changes 145 associated with behavioral development. First, nutrition affects the expression of immune genes 146 [62-64] and susceptibility to different pathogens [65-68]. Second, infections of pathogens and 8 171 almost 3X higher when compared with P-UR colonies (100 and 35, respectively; P= <0.0001). 172 Analysis of nectar and pollen foragers in each nutritional group showed higher numbers of both 173 types of foragers in P-R compared with P-UR colonies (nectar: P-R=53, P-UR-24, P= <0.0001; 174 pollen: P-R=47, P-UR=11, P= <0.0001). While no significant differences were found between the 175 number of nectar and pollen foragers in P-R colonies (P=0.52), the difference between both types 176 of foragers in P-UR colonies was highly significant (P=0.0027) with a lower number of new 177 pollen foragers than nectar foragers under this condition ( Figure 1A and Figures S2 and S3 ). 178 179 2. Brood production. 180 Two days after the end of the behavioral observations, and one day after the last collection of 3-181 week-old workers, newly-emerged bees were counted on frames from P-R and P-UR colonies 182 until the last bees emerged after 16 days. The cumulative number of newly-emerged bees from P-183 R colonies was significantly lower compared to P-UR colonies (2573 and 3881, respectively. 184 P=0.014) (Figure 1B). 185 186 Figure 1. Effects of pollen restriction on foraging and brood production. Values were pooled 187 from eight pollen restricted (P-R) and eight pollen un-restricted colonies (P-U). The upper panel 188 (A) shows the effect of nutrition on the average number of new foragers per day. The y-axis 189 indicates the number of nectar foragers, pollen foragers and total foragers observed per day (sum 190 of 3 periods of 15 min each). Nutritional groups plotted in the x-axis are as follow: pollen-191 restricted colonies (R), pollen-unrestricted colonies (UR). The lower panel (B) compares the total 192 number of bees born (y-axis) from colonies in both nutritional conditions (x-axis). Error bars 193 represent SE across colonies. Significant differences in the total number of foragers between R 194 and UR colonies are represented with black stars. Differences in pollen or nectar foragers 195 between nutritional conditions are represented with blue stars. 196 197 198 199 200 9 201 3. Behavioral, nutritional and age analyses of gene expression and virus titers 202 Genes associated with physiological activity 203 204 Vg expression was significantly affected by behavior, with higher levels in nurses in all 205 nutritional and age groups (P= <0.0001 for all behavioral comparisons). Expression levels in 206 nurses were on average 3.75X higher compared with foragers. (Figure 2A) . Nutritional 207 treatments also had a significant effect on vg expression, with higher levels in nurses from 208 colonies with unrestricted access to pollen (P-UR) compared with nurses from colonies with 209 restricted access to pollen (P-R) in both age groups (2-week-old: P= <0.0001; 3-week-old: 210 P=0.0075). Foragers also showed higher levels of vg in P-UR colonies compared with P-R 211 colonies, but only at the younger group (P=0.0003). Lastly, age comparisons showed a 212 significant increase in 3-week-old workers in all the nutritional and behavioral comparisons with 213 the exception of foragers from P-UR colonies (Figure 2A and Table S2 ). 215 Mrjp1 expression levels were strongly affected by behavior with higher levels in nurses compared 216 with foragers in all the nutritional and age comparisons. On average, mrjp1 levels in nurses were 217 5X higher compared with foragers. On the other hand, nutritional comparisons showed that pollen 218 consumption induced a significant increase of mrjp1 in younger nurses (P=0.009) and foragers 219 (7.2e-6) compared with workers from P-R colonies. No nutritional differences were observed in 220 older 3-week-old workers. Age comparisons showed a tendency toward higher levels in older 221 foragers, which become significant in all the comparisons with the exception of foragers from P-222 UR colonies. It is interesting to note, that our whole-body analyses reveal that mrjp1 mRNA 223 levels were substantially higher compared with vg, being on average over 500X higher ( Figure   224 2A). 225 10 226 Mfe expression showed behaviorally related changes in 2-week-old workers, with higher levels in 227 nurses compared with foragers (P-R= 0.015, P-UR=0.016). In contrast, no significant behavioral 228 differences were observed in 3-week-old workers. On the other hand, nutritional comparisons 229 showed significantly higher mfe expression associated with pollen intake exclusively in 3-week-230 old workers (nurses: P=0.035, foragers: P=0.014). Lastly, age comparisons revealed a trend 231 toward down-regulation of mfe expression in older workers. However, significant differences 232 were only found in foragers from P-R colonies (P=0.002). ( Figure 2B ). 234 The expression of ilp1 revealed complex interactions in our behavioral and nutritional analyses. 235 The behavioral analysis showed significantly higher levels in younger foragers from P-UR 236 colonies (P=0.033) and in older nurses from P-R colonies (P=0.034). On the other hand, 237 nutritional comparisons exhibited higher levels in 2-week-old foragers from P-UR colonies and 238 3-week-old nurses from P-R colonies (2-week-old: nurses P=0.61, foragers P=0.014; 3-week-old 239 nurses P=0.01, foragers P=0.30). In contrast with behavior and nutritional analyses, age 240 comparisons revealed a significant down-regulation in the expression of ilp1 in most of the 241 nutritional and behavioral groups of older workers (P-R nurses: P=0.058, P-R foragers: P= 242 <0.0001, P-UR nurses: P= 0.0001, P-UR foragers: P= 0.0005) ( Figure 2B ). 244 Expression of ilp2 showed behavioral differences only in younger workers, with higher levels in 245 foragers both from P-R (P=0.0001) and P-UR (P=0.006) colonies. Nutritional comparisons 246 showed a trend toward higher ilp2 levels with pollen consumption in 2-week-old workers, but the 247 differences were marginally significant (P-R=0.08, P-UR=0.08) (Table S2 ). In contrast, higher 248 expression of ilp2 was associated with pollen restriction in both 3-week-old nurses (P=0.0001) 249 and foragers (P=0.037). Age comparisons revealed higher ilp2 expression in workers from 250 colonies experiencing pollen restriction (nurses P= <0.0001, foragers P=0.001). Additionally, our
