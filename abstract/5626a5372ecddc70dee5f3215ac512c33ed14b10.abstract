Coronavirus infections are significant in the world's cat population. 1 • 2 As many as 80% to 90% of cats are affected within individual catteries and multicat households. 2 Cats are susceptible to infection with several different strains of feline corona virus. 2 • 3 Depending on the involved strain, clinical signs may range from asymptomatic infection _to gastrointestinal disease of varying severity to widespread fibrinous serositis and disseminated vasculitis, commonly known as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). 2 Coronaviruses are spherical, enveloped viruses that average 100 nm in diameter, possessing a single-stranded nonsegmented RNA genome of positive polarity. The virus particle is composed of structural proteins: nucleocapsid protein and spike glycoproteins. 19 • 35 The nucleocapsid protein occurs in the core of the virus and is composed of only polypeptides. The spike glycoproteins are associated with the envelope of the virus. 35 The spike glycoproteins occur as petal-shaped projections, or peplomers, that extend outward from the envelope of the virus; 13 these proteins are associated with attachment of the coronavirus to receptor sites on susceptible cells. Peplomers also may be major inducers of protective immunity in an infected host. After ingestion or inhalation of a coronavirus, younger members of the host species tend to develop signs of infection, whereas the asymptomatic carrier state is more common in adult animals. Replication of coronaviruses occurs at the cytoplasmic membranes, as the virus buds into vacuoles within cell cytoplasm. 36 Corona virus remains cell-associated throughout the course of infection and is released after the cell is destroyed. Replication of virus is rapid; cycle is complete in less than 24 hours. 36
