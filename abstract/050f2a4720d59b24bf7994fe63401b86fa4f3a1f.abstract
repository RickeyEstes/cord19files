Using 11 overlapping synthetic peptides covering more than 95% of the amino acid sequence of capsid protein of rubella virus, 7 CD4+ T cell clones (Rl 0, Rl 1, R18, A2, Al 0, Al 1, and Al 2) isolated from 2 rubella seropositive donors reacted strongly to rubella capsid peptides C6 (residues 119-l 521, C9 (residues 205-233), or Cl 1 (residues 255-280), respectively, in both proliferation and cytotoxicity assay. Truncated peptides C6E (residues 125-l 39), C9B (residues 205-216), and Cl 1 E (residues 260-272) were shown to be involved directly to the T cell determinants of C6, C9, and Cl 1, respectively. Genetic restriction of these T cell clones was analyzed by using human cell lines with various HLA-DR phenotypes as targets and/or antigen-presenting cells in cytotoxicity assay and/or proliferation assays. The results indicated that the recognition of peptide C6 byT cell clones (Rl 1 and R18) was associated with DRw9 molecule, while the HLA restriction element of the responses of other T cell clones (A2 and Al 1, Al 0, and Al 2) that reacted with peptide C9 or Cl 1 was DR4 molecule. However, there may be a cross-recognition by the T cell clone (Al 2) between DRl and DR4 subtypes.
