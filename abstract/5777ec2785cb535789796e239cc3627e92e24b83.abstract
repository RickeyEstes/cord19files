The El glycoprotein from an avian coronavirus is a model protein for studying retention in the Golgi complex . In animal cells expressing the protein from cDNA, the El protein is targeted to cis Golgi cisternae (Machamer, C. E., S. A. Mentone, J. K. Rose, and M. G. Farquhar. 1990 . Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 87:6944-6948) . We show that the first of the three membrane-spanning domains of the El protein can retain two different plasma membrane proteins in the Golgi region of transfected cells. Both the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein and the alphasubunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (anchored to the membrane by fusion with the G protein membrane-spanning domain and cytoplasmic tail) were retained in the Golgi region of transfected cells when 19
