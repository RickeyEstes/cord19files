This paper analyzes the crisis mismanagement of the Hong Kong government during the SARS outbreak. It addresses eight factors that characterize a government crisis and uses them as guidelines to assess how the Hong Kong government performed in SARS. The Hong Kong government faced a major crisis when SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) broke out in 2003. There was a total of 1755 Hong Kong residents who got infected. The epidemic finally claimed 299 lives, including 6 medical workers. The Hong Kong government's image and reputation were at stakes as local citizens and media accused it of being "impotent" in handling the crisis. This paper examines the unique characteristics of government crises and uses them as a guideline to demonstrate how the Hong Kong government's crisis communication lost the public trust in the SARS epidemic.
