Calculation of free energies for forming Stem 1 hairpins and the "reference" structures from unfolded RNA, and of free energies for forming pseudoknots from unfolded RNA by models in NUPACK (33) and SPM (42). • The free energies of Stem 1 hairpins are predicted from INN-HB model (39) combined with hairpin loop (60) and dangling end (61-62) free energy parameters. • The free energies of "reference" structures are from two parts: hairpin and newly formed duplex. The hairpin part is predicted in the same way as Stem 1 hairpin. o In BWYV PSK 1, the duplex part is predicted from INN-HB model (39) with 5΄CF/3΄GQ free energy increment (Table 1) . o In BWYV PSK 2 and its mutants, the free energies of duplex parts are derived from optical melting result (-12.9 kcal/mol) of model duplex 5΄GAACAAACGG3΄/3΄AACUUGUUUGF5΄ (Table 1) , by making it less favorable by 1.9 kcal/mol for 3΄ dangling AA (62). Additional assumptions described on the figures are used to estimate stability increments for the fluorescent end of the duplex. The hairpin part and duplex part are coaxially stacked onto each other and stabilize the "reference" structure (63).
