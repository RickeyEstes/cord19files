Purpose: Published literature regarding calf nutrition was reviewed to create an information base for the implementation of proper nutritional management to maximize health and productivity. Sources: The main source of data and information for this review was peer-reviewed literature. Synthesis: Feeding a sufficient volume of colostrum during the first hours of life is crucial to calf health and survival; however, less is known about transition milk feeding and the potential benefits of the myriad of bioactive compounds it contains. After feeding colostrum and transition milk, calves are susceptible to diarrhea when moved onto high amounts of milk, and antibiotic use is often necessary to decrease disease. Feeding an elevated plane of milk nutrition results in increased ADG and, in some studies, increased future milk production. Thus, this nutritional strategy is recommended; however, weaning calves from high volumes of milk represents massive changes in the structure and microbiology of the gastrointestinal tract. Conclusions and Applications: Colostrum and transition milk contain an abundance of bioactive molecules that can positively affect gut development and microbiota. There is significant potential for the use of novel feeding strategies and microbial-based products as alternatives to antibiotics. Calves fed an elevated plane of nutrition in the first month of life have greater productivity and growth. However, weaning should take place later in life. Moreover, applying a proper step-down feeding protocol is recommended, as it allows calves to intake and digest sufficient solid feed for growth and minimize distress at weaning.
