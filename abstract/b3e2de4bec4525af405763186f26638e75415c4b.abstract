Fluid therapy for diarrheic neonatal calves is increasingly recognized as the most appropriate and practical solution for providing life support. Restoration and maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance as well as energy provision are necessary considerations. To be maximally effective, fluid therapy for diarrheic calves or other neonates must fulfill several criteria. Dehydration must be reversed and adequate fluid provided for normal body water turnover plus continued diarrheal fecal losses. From the animal's point of view, the optimum therapeutic approach would be a continuous fluid input at a rate equal to body losses, a condition best provided by slow intravenous administration. 29,54.69 This is not a practical approach under many field conditions. As an alternative, subcutaneous fluid administration can be effective for providing a sustained fluid input, because subcutaneous fluids are slowly absorbed over several hours. 7 Over the past several years, the major emphasis on fluid and electrolyte maintenance for diarrheic calves has become focused on the use of oral fluids. A basis for this has been the outstanding success of oral glucose-electrolyte therapies for the treatment of Vibrio cholera and infant diarrhea in humans. Associated with this beneficial effect is the recognition that the mechanism by which Escherichia coli enterotoxin induces diarrhea is analogous to the pathogenesis of V. cholera diarrhea as well as diarrhea induced by other enterotoxigenic bacteria. Increased secretory activity is the initiating cause, yet absorption may continue and even be increased. 3 ,lo,41,68 However, the simplistic assumption that, during diarrhea, absorption is normal or increased as is seen with many bacterial diarrheas,21 may be fallacious when considering the spectrum of diarrheal etiologies. Motility changes may also modify gastrointestinal function. 58 Increased motility due to inflammation, local irritation, or other activation of smooth muscle may increase transit rate and diminish the time available for nutrient exposure to the enteric surface, thereby limiting absorption. Conversely,
