Autophagy is a universal catabolic cellular process for quality control of cytoplasm and maintenance of cellular homeostasis upon nutrient deprivation and environmental stimulus. It involves the lysosomal degradation of cellular components such as misfolded proteins or damaged organelles. Defects in autophagy are implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases including cancers, myopathy, neurodegenerations, infections and cardiovascular diseases. In the recent decade, traditional drugs with new clinical applications are not only commonly found in Western medicines, but also highlighted in Chinese herbal medicines (CHM). For instance, pharmacological studies have revealed that active components or fractions from Chaihu (Radix bupleuri), Hu Zhang (Rhizoma polygoni cuspidati), Donglingcao (Rabdosia rubesens), Hou po (Cortex magnoliae officinalis) and Chuan xiong (Rhizoma chuanxiong) modulate cancers, neurodegeneration and cardiovascular disease via autophagy. These findings shed light on the potential new applications and formulation of CHM decoctions via regulation of autophagy. This article reviews the roles of autophagy in the pharmacological actions of CHM and discusses their new potential clinical applications in various human diseases. Molecules 2016, 21, 359 2 of 45 obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypoalphalipoproteinemia [13] [14] [15] [16] . A murine model with autophagy related gene (Atg7) conditionally knockout from pancreatic β-cells induced hyperglycemia as a result of reduced insulin synthesis and secretion [17] . In addition, aging is the chronic recession of metabolism and cellular homeostasis, the diminishing macroautophagy over time leads to aged-related physiological and pathological changes, and is reversely related to longevity [18] [19] [20] . Also, dampened macroautophagy-induced cellular toxicity promotes tumorigenesis. The progression of prostate, breast and ovarian cancers, and brain tumors including glioblastoma and myeloma are accelerated accompanying dysregulated Atg activities [21] [22] [23] . The macroautophagy inducer metformin has demonstrated cytotoxicity against colon cancer cells with mechanism independent of p53 signaling [24] . Saikosaponin-d, (Z)-3,4,5,4 1 -trans-tetramethoxy-stilbene, liensinine, isoliensinine, dauricine and cepharanthine can be used to treat drug-resistant and apoptosis-resistant cancers by triggering autophagic cell death [25] [26] [27] . Macroautophagy also regulates pathogens removal and immunocellular homeostasis maintenance suggesting its critical role in autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders, for example, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS) [28] [29] [30] . Clinical treatment with small molecules impeding macroautophagy activity, such as CQ (chloroquine), HCQ (hydroxychloroquine), FTY720 (a sphingosine analogue) and P140 peptide (a phosphopeptide), are therapeutically beneficial to lupus patients [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . As such, macroautophagy has become an ideal pharmaceutical target for in-depth investigation. Up-to-date Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) researches have demonstrated that single small-molecules or herbal extracts isolated from herbal medicines such as Bupleurum, curcumin, Polygonum cuspidatum, Rabdosia rubescens, Magnolia hypoleuca, Ligusticum wallichii franchat, and Panax notoginseng can modulate macroautophagy with intervention effects towards tumorigenesis, infectious diseases, as well as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular impairments [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . This review will discuss the context of macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) regulatory mechanisms and their role in human diseases. Further discussion on specific CHMs will focus on their new therapeutic usage through regulation of autophagy. 2.1. The Ras-Raf1-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 Cascade ERK activity is an autophagy inducing signaling cascade in the intestinal-derived cells effecting through the phosphorylation of GTPase-activating protein G α interacting protein (GAIP) by ERK which is phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1/2) [43] . The activated ERK also abrogates the autophagy inhibitory effects of the trimeric Gi3 protein [44] . Increased level of amino acid negatively regulates autophagy by phosphorylating the Ser 259 of Raf1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase), the pivotal gatekeeper of the cascade [45]. Amino acid starvation stimulates beclin 1-class III PtdIns3K interaction for protein complex formation through the assembly of beclin 1 with proteinaceous components like Vps34 (class III PtdIns3K) and p150 facilitating the upregulation of autophagy [46] [47] [48] [49] . This process is independent of mTOR and is regulated by anti-apoptotic proteins which are regulated by JNK1-and death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) [50] [51] [52] . Nutrient deprivation activated DAPK to phosphorylate Thr 119 within the BH3 domain which releases beclin 1 to bind with PtdIns3K for autophagy stimulation [51] . When subjected to starvation, JNK1 phosphorylate T 69 , S 70 , and S 87 of Bcl-2 to detach beclin 1 from the beclin 1-BcL-2 complex for autophagy activation [50] .
