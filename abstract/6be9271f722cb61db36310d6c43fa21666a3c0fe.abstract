In stage II (moderate COPD), the FEV 1 is above 30%, but less than 80% of the predicted value. Stage III (severe COPD) is defined by an FEV 1 below 30% of the predicted value or the presence of respiratory failure or right-sided heart failure. Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis are associated with worsened dyspnea, elevated sputum production, and increased sputum purulence. These can be classified as severe (type 1) if all three of symptoms are present and moderate (type 2) if two of the three are present. A mild exacerbation is diagnosed if one of the above symptoms occurs along with at least one of the following: upper respiratory tract infection in the past 5 days, fever without other apparent cause, increased wheezing, increased cough, and respiratory rate or heart rate elevated at least 20% above baseline.
