KEYWORDS Adolescent Liver disease Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease Hepatitis There are challenges that must be addressed to effectively care for, not only liver disease in the adolescent but also the patient as a whole. Evaluation of an adolescent with new-onset liver enzyme abnormalities should be individualized based on the patient's history and physical exam, but there are a few diseases that need to be ruled out for any adolescent with elevated liver enzymes.

Transition of care to adult-centered care is a continuous process throughout adolescence and should incorporate interventions to promote self-management skills and adherence.
