Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a member of the genus Enterovirus within the family Picornaviridae and is an important pathogen of viral myocarditis, which accounts for more than 50% viral myocarditis cases. VP1 is major capsid protein that this region has a low homology in both amino acid and nucleotide sequences among Enteroviruses. Therefore we have chosen this region for designed a set of RT-LAMP primers for CVB3 detection. For this the total RNA was extracted from 24-h post infected-HeLa cells with complete cytopathic effect (CPE), and applied to a one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction (RT-LAMP) using CVB3-specific primers. The optimization of RT-LAMP reaction was carried out with three variables factors including MgSO 4 concentration, temperature and time of incubation. Amplification was analyzed by using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide and SYBR Green staining. Our results were shown the ladderlike pattern of the VP1 gene amplification. The LAMP reaction mix was optimized and the best result observed at 4 mM MgSO 4 and 60Â°C for 90 min incubation. RT-LAMP had high sensitivity and specificity for detection of CVB3 infection. This method can be used as a rapid and easy diagnostic test for detection of CVB3 in clinical laboratories.
