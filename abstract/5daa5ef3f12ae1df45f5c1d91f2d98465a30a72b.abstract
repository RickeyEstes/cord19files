A simple protocol for generating a highly stable and active surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor surface of recombinant human hexahistidine cyclophilin A (His-CypA) is described. The sensor surface was sensitive and stable enough to allow, for the first time, the screening and ranking of several novel small-molecule (M r $250-500 Da) ligands in a competition binding assay with cyclosporin A (CsA). It also allowed us to accurately determine the kinetic rate constants for the interaction between His-CypA and CsA. His-CypA was first captured on a Ni 2+ -nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) sensor chip and was then briefly covalently stabilized, coupling via primary amines. The significant baseline drift observed due to dissociation of weakly bound His-CypA from the Ni 2+ -NTA moiety was eliminated, resulting in a surface that was stable for at least 36 h. In addition, immobilized protein activity levels were high, typically between 85 and 95%, assayed by the interaction between His-CypA and CsA. The mean equilibrium dissociation constant for CsA (K dCsA ) binding to the immobilized His-CypA was 23 ± 6 nM, with on and off rates of 0.53 ± 0.1 lM À1 s À1 and 1.2 ± 0.1 (·10 À2 ) s À1 , respectively. These values agree well with the values for the corresponding binding constants determined from steady-state and kinetic fluorescence titrations in solution. sulfoxide; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; BSA, bovine serum albumin. www.elsevier.com/locate/yabio Analytical Biochemistry 345 (2005) 214-226 ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
