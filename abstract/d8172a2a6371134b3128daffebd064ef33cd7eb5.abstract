We found that astrocytes expressed the a subtype of protein kinase C. Treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) caused cultured astrocytes to proliferate. This effect of TPA was blocked by staurosporine, a potent protein kinase C inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of protein kinase C in astrocyte proliferation. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin formation, enhanced both the normal and TPA-induced proliferation of astrocytes. Authentic prostaglandin E 2 blocked this effect of indomethacin and also partially blocked the effect of TPA, suggesting that the intracellular mechanisms involved in prostaglandin E2-regulated astrocyte growth might differ from those acting in protein kinase-dependent growth. The effect of prostaglandin E 2 was blocked by a specific anti-prostaglandin E 2 polycional antibody. Cultured astrocytes and microglia produced and released prostaglandin E 2 in response to stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide, TPA, and lymphokines. Since the sensitivity of astrocytes and microglia to these stimuli was different, prostaglandin E 2 may differentially regulate astrocyte proliferation under different physiological conditions, acting in an autocrine fashion for astrocytes and in a paracrine fashion for microglia.
