Objective This study aimed to assess household preparedness for emergency events and its determinants in China. Design: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted on 3,541 households in China in 2015. Participants: Households were selected using a stratified cluster sampling strategy, representing central, eastern, western and southern regions of China. The designed questionnaires were administered through face-to-face interviews. Outcome Measures: Household emergency preparedness was measured with 14 indicators, tapping into the supply of nine emergency necessities (food and water, extra batteries, battery-powered radio, battery-operated flashlight, first aid kit, gas mask, fire extinguisher, escape ropes, whistle), coverage of accident insurance, knowledge of local emergency response systems (emergency numbers, exit routes and shelters), and availability of a household evacuation plan. If an individual acted on nine of the 14 indicators, they were deemed well-prepared. Logistic regression models were established to identify predictors of well-preparedness based on 3,541 returned questionnaires containing no missing values. Results: Only 9.9% of households were well-prepared for emergencies: 53.6% did not know what to do and 31.6% did not want to think about it. A higher level of preparedness was found in the respondents who participated in emergency training activities (AOR=2.458), had better emergency knowledge (AOR=2.278), reported less fate-submissiveness (AOR=1.622) and more self-reliance (AOR=1.376), had a higher income (AOR=1.400), and held more positive attitudes toward preparedness (AOR=1.295). Household preparedness for emergency events is poor in China. lack of motivation, negative attitude to preparedness and knowledge shortfall are major but remediable barriers for household preparedness.
