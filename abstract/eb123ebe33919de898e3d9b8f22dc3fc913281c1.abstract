a r t i c l e i n f o a b s t r a c t Article history: Flos Chrysanthemi (the flower of Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.) is widely used in China as a metabolites of luteolin in vivo by cathechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). However, there was lack of pharmacokinetic information of chrysoeriol and diosmetin after oral administration of Flos Keywords: Chrysanthemi extract (FCE). The present study aimed to develop an HPLC-UV method for Luteolin simultaneous determination of rat plasma concentration of luteolin, apigenin, chrysoeriol and Chrysoeriol diosmetin and utilize it in pharmacokinetic study of the four compounds after orally giving FCE to Diosmetin rats. The method was successfully validated and applied to the pharmacokinetic study when oral Pharmacokinetics administration of FCE to rats with or without co-giving a COMT inhibitor, entacapone. Chrysoeriol Flos Chrysanthemi and diosmetin were detected in rat plasma after oral administration of FCE and their Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) concentrations were significantly decreased after co-giving entacapone. Furthermore, AUC of luteolin was significantly increased by entacapone, while that of chrysoeriol was decreased by entacapone, which revealed COMT might play an important role in the disposition of luteolin in rats after dosing of FCE. In conclusion, a sensitive, accurate and reproducible HPLC-UV method for simultaneous determination of luteolin, apigenin, chrysoeriol and diosmetin in rat plasma were developed, pharmacokinetics of chrysoeriol and diosmetin combined with luteolin and apigenin were characterized after oral administration of FCE to rats, which gave us more information on pharmacokinetics and potential pharmacological effects of FCE in vivo.
