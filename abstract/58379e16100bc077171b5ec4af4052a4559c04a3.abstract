References (1-5) DNA synthesis. DNA sequences were synthesized on an ABI 3400 DNA synthesizer. The synthesis protocol was set up according to the requirements specified by the reagents' manufacturers. Following on machine synthesis, the DNA products were deprotected and cleaved from CPG by incubating with 2.5 mL AMA (ammonium hydroxide/methylamine 50:50) for 17 hours at 40°C in water bath. The cleaved DNA product was transferred into a 15 mL centrifuge tube and mixed with 250 µL 3.0 M NaCl and 5.0 mL ethanol, after which the sample was placed into a freezer at -20 °C for ethanol precipitation. Afterwards, the DNA product was spun at 4000 rpm under 3°C for 20 minutes. The supernatant was removed, and the precipitated DNA product was dissolved in 500 µL 0.2 M triethylamine acetate (TEAA Glen Research Corp.) for HPLC purification. HPLC purification was performed with a cleaned Alltech C18 column on a Varian Prostar HPLC machine. The collected DNA product was dried, and detritylation was processed by dissolving and incubating in 200 µL 80% acetic acid for 20 minutes. The detritylated DNA product was mixed with 400 µL ethanol and vacuum dried. The DNA products were quantified and stored in DNA water for subsequent experiments. The detailed sequence information is described in Table S1 . DNA purification. Native PAGE was applied to purify the AM, BM and PG duplex strands to remove excess strands and avoid undesired system leakage. The ssDNA components
