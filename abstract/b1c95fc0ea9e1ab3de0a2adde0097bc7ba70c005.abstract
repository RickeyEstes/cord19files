About 200 million cases of viral community-acquired pneumonia occur every year-100 million in children and 100 million in adults. Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our uwnderstanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, and fi ndings indicate that the incidence of viral pneumonia has been underestimated. In children, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfl uenza viruses are the agents identifi ed most frequently in both developed and developing countries. Dual viral infections are common, and a third of children have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection. In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular infl uenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia. Presence of viral epidemics in the community, patient's age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help diff erentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia. No clear consensus has been reached about whether patients with obvious viral communityacquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics. Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by infl uenza viruses, there is no clear role for use of specifi c antivirals to treat viral community-acquired pneumonia. Infl uenza vaccines are the only available specifi c preventive measures. Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, regional diff erences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more data from developing countries.
