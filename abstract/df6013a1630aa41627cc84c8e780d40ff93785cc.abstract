To compare the secondary structures of RNA molecules we developed the CROSSalign method. CROSSalign is based on the combination of the Computational Recognition Of Secondary Structure (CROSS) algorithm to predict the RNA secondary structure at single-nucleotide resolution using sequence information, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method to align profiles of different lengths. We applied CROSSalign to investigate the structural conservation of long non-coding RNAs such as XIST and HOTAIR as well as ssRNA viruses including HIV. In a pool of sequences with the same secondary structure CROSSalign accurately recognizes repeat A of XIST and domain D2 of HOTAIR and outperforms other methods based on covariance modelling. CROSSalign can be applied to perform pair-wise comparisons and is able to find homologues between thousands of matches identifying the exact regions of similarity between profiles of different lengths. The algorithm is freely available at the webpage Sequence similarity is often considered the key feature to investigate evolutionary conservation of coding transcripts [1]. Yet, knowledge of secondary structure provides important insights into the biological function of RNAs by allowing the study of physical properties, such as for instance molecular interactions [2]. In most cases, information about the RNA folding complements sequence analysis [3] and is useful to understand mechanisms of action: microRNA precursors, for example, are processed by DGCR8 only if properly folded in hairpin loop structures [4]. Similarly, the architecture of ribosomal RNAs evolves in a self-contained way through conservation of stem loops present in ancient species [5,6], indicating distinct requirements for structural elements. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are regarded as a mystery in terms of sequence and structural conservation [7]. The vast majority of lncRNAs evolve under little or no selective constraints, undergo almost no purifying selection, show poor expression, and do not have often easily identifiable orthologues [7,8]. Indeed, the average sequence homology of evolutionarily conserved lncRNAs is 20% between human and mouse and drops to 5% between human and fish [7]. Thus, primary structure does not provide relevant information to study lncRNA conservation and secondary structure could be used for better characterization. Similarly to lncRNAs, the transcriptomes of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses retain their fold even if sequences mutate rapidly [9], which indicates that secondary structure investigation could be key to revealing evolutionary properties. To study the structural conservation of two RNA molecules, we developed the CROSSalign method. CROSSalign, available at our webpages http://service.tartaglialab.com//new_submission/crossalign, is based on the combination of two methods: 1) Computational Recognition Of Secondary Structure (CROSS), which is an algorithm trained on experimental data to predict RNA secondary structure profiles without sequence length restrictions and at singlenucleotide resolution [10]; 2) the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to assess the similarity of two profiles of different lengths [11].

Moreover, CROSS shows better performances than algorithms such as RNAstructure [13,14] and RNAfold [12] (respective correlations 0.71 and 0.47 with crystals; Supplementary Figures 3 and 4) . shows comparable correlations with structural distances calculated with either CROSS or crystallographic profiles (respectively: 0.80, 0.83, 0.38 with author/funder.

While CROSS and crystallographic profiles identify specific clusters of RNA molecules with low sequence identity and high structural similarity (colored in red, orange and green according to difference confidence thresholds; Figures 1C, 1D, 1E) , SHAPE data cannot be used to identify these structures. To further test the usefulness of CROSSalign, we compared its output with that of CMfinder [15]. CMfinder is a method to compute multiple sequence alignments that exploits structural motifs for ranking (Materials and Methods, Comparisons with CMfinder). We analyzed the largest multiple sequence alignments reported in the CMfinder test set (cobalamin, intron gp II, s box, lysine and histone 3) and used the minimal structural distance to assign the closest match to each transcript. Selecting equal-size groups (lowest and highest CMfinder scores), we measured CROSSalign performances on CMfinder rankings, achieving an AUC of 0.80 (Supplementary Methods; Supplementary Figure 5A). We note that CROSSalign has particularly strong performances on the largest dataset: cobalamin (71 sequences of 216nt; AUC of 0.95; Supplementary Figure 5B). Ribosomal RNAs are considered one of the most ancient, structured and conserved classes of RNA molecules [5]. The first step to validate CROSSalign was to search for structural similarities between the Small SubUnit (SSU) of the rRNA of different bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Deinococcus radiodurans). All the rRNAs show significant structural similarity (p-value <10 -5 ) with a low structural distance (~0.08; Table 1A ). By contrast, shuffling one of the two sequences in CROSSalign predictions results in non-significant scoring (p-values of 0.10 or higher; Table 1A ), indicating the importance of the sequence context in our calculations. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli are the most similar SSUs (structural distance of 0.06; p-value <10 -5 ). As the SSU of the rRNAs is thought to have evolved in a self-contained structure where the secondary structure of the ancient species is author/funder. All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/284869 doi: bioRxiv preprint 5 contained in the other ones [6], we searched the complete SSU of Escherichia coli in the SSU of other species such as Pyrococcus furiosus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens. The results show a strong and significant structural similarity, in agreement with the theory of self-contained evolution (Table 1B) . By contrast, comparison with randomized E. coli SSU or H. sapiens mRNA of the same length results in non-significant scores (p-values of 0.10 or higher Table 1B) . XIST is a lncRNA characterized by several repetitive domains showing different structural properties (Figures 2A and 2B) [16]. The 5' conserved region, named Arepeat (or RepA), is indispensable for gene-silencing and has been shown to be highly conserved in mammals. In mouse it consists of 7.5 copies (8.5 in humans) of 26-mers separated by U-rich linkers (Figure 2A) [17]. In 2015 and 2017, two reports on the XIST A-repeat structure were published [18,19], both making use of experimental techniques to infer XIST structure . The A-repeat structures obtained are similar with strikingly identical stem-loop structures, both emerging from larger RNA bulges of repeats 3, 5, and 6 (for a comparison with CROSS predictions, see our previous manuscript [10]). To evaluate the ability of CROSSalign to recognize the structural content in RepA, we used RNAinverse from Vienna suite [12] to generate 50 different sequences (average identity of 40%; Supplementary Table 1) with the same structure as RepA (Materials and Methods; Reverse engineering: from structure to sequence). The sequences were then divided into a reference (25 transcripts) and a positive (25 transcripts) set, and we built a list of negative cases by shuffling 25 times the original RepA. We then used CROSSalign to compute all scores for the positive and negative set against the corresponding reference set and used the minimal structural distance to assign the closest match to each transcript. The strong performances obtained highlight the ability of CROSSalign to identify structural similarities regardless of the sequence similarity (AUC of 0.85; Figure 2C ). As a further test of the usefulness of CROSSalign we compared the above results with those obtained using CMsearch from the Infernal-1.1.2 package, an algorithm based on author/funder.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/284869 doi: bioRxiv preprint 6 a covariance model approach [20]. In this case, CMsearch is not able to identify any match between either the positive or negative list and the reference sets (AUC of 0.5; CROSSalign is able to recognize structural similarities between non-similar sequences, outperforming covariance-based approaches such as CMsearch. After this first validation step, we used CROSSalign to study structural similarities of XIST domain RepA in 10 different species [21]. Our analysis reveals that primates cluster close to human (Supplementary Figure 6A) while other species are more distant (Supplementary Figures 6A and 7) . By contrast, calculating sequence similarity with respect to human XIST (computed with EMBOSS; see Materials and Methods), we could not identify a specific cluster for primates (Supplementary Figure   6B ). Thus, our results indicate that secondary structure shows a higher degree of conservation than sequence. We then selected RepA of orangutan and searched for structural similarities within all human intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs 8176 sequences; ENSEMBLE 82). XIST was ranked as the best significant match in the pool (structural distance 0.01; p-value < 10 -6 ) and RepA was correctly identified (predicted coordinates: 328-764; 95% overlap with the query region; Figure 3A ; Supplementary Table 2) . Similar results were observed for baboon RepA (best result: 0.032; 86% overlap with the query region) and lemur RepA (best result: 0.075; p-value; 97% overlap with the query region), suggesting a strong structural conservation within primates ( Figure 3B ). By contrast, human and mouse RepA showed a larger distance in terms of both structural and sequence similarity, which is in agreement with previous studies on lncRNA conservation [22]. We used CROSSalign to search for the human RepA within all mouse lncRNAs and identified XIST as the 5 th best hit (structural distance 0.085; p-value < 10 -6 ; Figure 4A ). In this case, the position of RepA was not correctly assigned (coordinates: 10306-10698; 0% overlap) but the best match falls into the regulatory region of exon 7, and the structural relation between RepA and exon 7 has been reported [23]. Importantly, the correct coordinates of human RepA within mouse XIST rank second in our analysis (structural distance 0.086; p-value < 10 -6 ), while the best match is a miRNA-containing the gene Mirg (ENSMUSG00000097391) and the two secondary structure profiles author/funder.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/284869 doi: bioRxiv preprint 7 show a strong correlation of 0.92 ( Figure 4B) . Interestingly, even if little information is available on Mirg, the transcript is prevalently expressed in the embryo [24]. This result unveils a previously unreported relationship between XIST and Mirg, in which structural and functional homologies can be linked. Intriguingly, also the second best result, Rian (ENSMUSG00000097451), is expressed in embryo, while no information is available on the third and fourth hits (ENSMUSG00000107391 and ENSMUSG00000085312). We note that the five matches here are not listed in the top 20 hits obtained by analysis of sequence similarity (<34%). Our results suggest that the secondary structure of RepA is conserved among primates, and diverges between human and mouse. However, analyzing the information contained in structured nucleotides (i.e., nucleotides with CROSS score < 0 are set to 0) we could identify XIST as the best match of human RepA within all mouse lncRNAs (structural distance 0.034; p-value < 10 -6 ; Figure 4C ). This result indicates that double-stranded regions are more conserved than single-stranded regions. In addition, we note that by sequence identity, XIST ranks as the 14 th hit of human RepA in all mouse lncRNAs, which indicates that methods based on sequence comparison show a significantly lower ability to identify structural homologues. HOTAIR shows a complex secondary structure, divided into four domains (D1, 2, 3, 4; Figures 5A and 5B) [25]. Experimentally it has been determined that more than 50% of the nucleotides are involved in base pairing (CROSS achieves an AUC > 0.80 in predicting its SHAPE profile; Supplementary Figures 8A and 8B) [26]. The region D2 is highly structured and consists of 15 helices, 11 terminal loops, and 4 junctions (three 5-way junctions and one 3-way junction) [26]. The D2 domain of HOTAIR is predicted by CROSS to be the most structured ( Figure   5B ). We used the same reverse engineering process as for RepA to generate 50 different sequences (average identity of 40%; Supplementary Table 1) with the same secondary structure as D2 (Materials and Methods; Reverse engineering: from structure to sequence). Also in this case, CROSSalign reports good performances (AUC of 0.72; Figure 5C ) that are superior to those obtained using the covariance-author/funder. All rights reserved.
