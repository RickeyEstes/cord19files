The influenza-confirmed patients reported reductions in the severity of fever (P Z 0.002), cough (P Z 0.023) and expectoration (P Z 0.004) after one-day of treatment with Antiwei, compared to placebo. The adverse event profiles were similar for Antiwei and placebo. Conclusion: Antiwei was effective and well tolerated in treatment of natural influenza infection in adults. Antiwei represents a clinically valuable intervention in the management of influenza. ª
