A draft genome was produced using reads from both the Illumina HiSeq and Roche 454 platforms using the following pipeline: first Illumina HiSeq reads were filtered and corrected using the standalone read correction tool ErrorCorrectReads.pl available with ALLPATHS-LG (1). Resulting reads were filtered for possible cross-contamination by aligning reads against human, rhesus macaque monkey and mycoplasma reference genomes using the tool Bowtie2 (2) and removed from subsequent processing steps. Due to their larger read length, Roche 454 single-end reads were filtered for contamination from the same sources using DECONSEQ (3). Reads aligned to the above contaminant genomes with 90% identity over at least 90% of their length were removed from further steps unless they also mapped to T. gondii. In addition, for paired-end reads, if either end of the read was aligned under default parameters with any of these possible contaminant genomes, both ends were removed from the data set. Single-end reads were then assembled using the short read assembler Ray (4), using a kmer value of 41 and default parameters. All contigs greater than 500 bp (N50=12,617) were subsequently split into pseudoreads of length 400 bp, with 200 bp of overlap remaining between adjacent pseudo-reads to maximize support for pre-assembled contig continuity in the next assembly step. Next, after filtering for adapter sequence contamination, 454 reads were combined with the filtered pairedend set of Illumina sequence data and assembled using Newbler v2.8 (454 Life Sciences, Roche Applied Science, Branford, CT). Subsequently, single-end Illumina reads assembled by Ray were added to the assembly project as pseudo-reads in a strategy that has previously been demonstrated in two diverse genome projects (5, 6). 75 contigs under 2000 bp in length were removed from the Newbler assembly as they aligned with the human genome using Bowtie2 with default settings. All 454 reads and assembled pseudo-reads were required to overlap by at least 90 bp with 98% identity. During assembly we ensured that all reads were used only once. Gene models were created using the tools Genemark-ES, Augustus, SNAP, exonerate, EVM, PASA,. Augustus parameters were obtained from those generally used to predict genes in the closest S. neurona relative available, T. gondii. Genemark-ES was trained automatically using the S. neurona scaffolds using default settings. SNAP was trained in MAKER on the genome of T. gondii by running Augustus, outputting predictions to zff files, and improving SNAP Hidden Markov model (HMM) parameters based on the new predictions. The subsequent HMM was then used to scan the S. neurona genome. Expressed sequence tags from S. neurona and T. gondii were downloaded from NCBI: redundant reads were removed using CD-HIT (15) using default parameters. Gene models from T. gondii, E. tenella, and N. caninum were downloaded from ToxoDB (v8.2) (16). All forms of physical evidence, as well as output from the tools Augustus and Genemark-ES were then combined using MAKER. SNAP was then adjusted using the novel gene models, and MAKER was run again. Repeats were masked on this second run using T. gondii's library of repeats (available from the Genetic Information Research Institute) as well as repeat families identified in the S. neurona genome after 4 rounds of the ab initio repeat family prediction tool, RepeatModeler (17). In a separate run, SNAP was iteratively trained completely independently of the T. gondii genome using
