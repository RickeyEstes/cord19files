The STAT1 cycle: signaling pathway and recycling. Schematic diagram of STAT1 activation and de-activation following IFN-g stimulation. Following the binding of the cytokine to its receptor, a series of tyrosine phosphorylation events (red circles) occur: first the JAKs autophosphorylate and transphosphorylate each other; they then phosphorylate the intracellular part of the receptor, creating a docking site for STAT1. Recruited STAT1 are also phosphorylated by the JAKs, leading to their removal from the receptor, dimerization and translocation to the nucleus to modulate target gene expression. STAT1 dephosphorylation occurs in the nucleus and STATs are then exported back to the cytoplasm.
