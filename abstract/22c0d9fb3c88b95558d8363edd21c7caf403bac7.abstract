There are no unique boxing diseases but certain factors contributing to the spread of illnesses apply strongly to the boxer, coach, and the training facility. Like many athletes, boxers spend long hours preparing alone as well as with other boxers and coaches. The very nature of the exercise, surrounding environment, and final competition can increase the likelihood of infection through airborne, contact, and bloodborne routes of transmission. In addition, boxing is one of the unique sports in which the audience can potentially become contaminated and exposed to certain diseases. Fortunately, there have been no documented disease outbreaks associated with the sport. Also, the gross underreporting of boxing illnesses in the literature makes discussions of these situations more speculative than evidence-based. This article includes evidence from other sports such as running, wrestling, and martial arts to help elucidate the pathophysiologic elements that could be identified in boxers. Often, before an important fight a boxer is isolated from his usual environment in an attempt to enhance his focus by minimizing distractions. The additional benefit of the seclusion is that it minimizes exposure to potential infectious agents that could jeopardize his or her health before an important fight. Vigorous physical exertion produces alterations in the body's ability to fight infection. 1 The circulatory system stimulates the changes in the immune system on several levels affecting the skin cells, upper respiratory tract mucosa, lung, peritoneal cavity, and muscles. Exerciseinduced stress affects the natural killer cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. Changes occur by influencing stress hormones, cytokine concentration, body temperature, blood flow, and hydration. The result is immune dysfunction lasting 3 to 72 hours. This dysfunction provides organisms a window of opportunity to increase the risk of subclinical and clinical infection. 1, 2 The overall effect appears to be modified by the degree of stress. 3 There is an increased risk associated with heavy training, whereas moderate training has been associated with a reduction in upper respiratory tract
