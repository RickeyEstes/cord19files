Some people may produce food they don't consume people consume the food they produce. As well as providing nutrition and supporting livelihoods, a range of negative health impacts result from this. Among the most important health impacts of livestock are those resulting from infectious diseases: especially, zoonoses, emerging infectious diseases, foodborne disease and antimicrobial resistance. These categories overlap. There are complex linkages between agriculture and agriculture associated disease. Zoonoses are diseases transmissible between animals and people and may be endemic (continually present) or epidemic (occur in outbreaks). Many zoonoses have mainly been controlled in high income countries but are serious health issues in low and middle income countries. Many zoonoses are considered neglected diseases. Diseases emerging from agriculture typically get high levels of attention. Many originate in wildlife and then spillover to people, often using livestock as bridges. There is consensus that emerging zoonotic pathogens are best managed by One Health approaches in which human health, animal health and the environmental sectors work together. Recent epidemics and pandemics of emerging disease highlight the importance of good surveillance and rapid response. The public health importance of foodborne disease is just starting to be recognised. The first global assessment of FBD, developed by the World Health Organisation, suggested the health burden of FBD was comparable to that of malaria, HIV-AIDS or tuberculosis. There are several strategies for managing foodborne disease including good practices, technologies and training. Human infections that do not respond to treatment impose a large burden of illness and death as well as entailing enormous health care costs. An unknown but potentially substantial amount of this burden is due to the use of antimicrobials in agriculture. Multiple initiatives are underway to promote prudent use. It is widely appreciated that agriculture development contributes significantly to public health outcomes. Collaborations that bridge the structural divisions between the agriculture and health sectors provides an opportunity for better managing these important diseases.
