Control of emerging infectious diseases can be a daunting task given the large number of disease-causing organisms, their ability to adapt to changing environments, survive in transit, develop resistance to antimicrobials, fiscal, regulatory, and technical limitations to new drug or vaccine development, limitations in public health capacity and constraints to the health care delivery system, not to mention time, space, and patient population considerations. Whether practicing in a faculty clinic, public health facility, or hospital based environment, such as the emergency department or urgent care center, there are some common practices that can help reduce the spread of communicable diseases, and facilitate more rapid diagnosis, treatment, and control of infectious illnesses. Moreover, a one size fits all approach may not be appropriate for all health care or community environments. However there are some strategies that can be applied near universally, and can confer benefit in a variety of settings. These include the following: Patient behaviors remain a challenge in the therapeutic environment. Consider hypertension, just to improve medication and life style adherence requires multiple approaches. The growing obesity problem underscores the challenges health care professionals face in terms of educating, motivating, and helping patients change lifestyles. But human to human transmission of infections requires us to educate patients in terms of infection control measures in public, and in the home.
