Methods The study group comprised of 171 ischemic stroke patients (including both new and recurrent stroke patients) from the major hospitals of Hyderabad, Bhagwan Mahavir Medical Research Centre and Govt. Nizamia General Hospital of (A.P., India). Patients with acute stroke were examined by a qualified stroke neurologist to confirm the diagnosis and the ischemic strokes were differentiated by computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging. Classification of subtypes was done according to TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria. 12 Patients with hemorrhagic stroke were excluded from the study. The Institutional Ethics Committee approved this study and written informed consent was obtained from all the subjects who participated in the study. Information on demographic characteristics was collected using a standard questionnaire prepared especially for this purpose. Age matched control subjects (153) from the comparable socioeconomic background were selected for comparison. Risk factors including hypertension and diabetes were documented. Hypertension was defined according to Joint National Committee VI-VII, as a systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg based on the average of the 2 blood pressure measurements. Diabetes was diagnosed if fasting plasma glucose was >126 mg/dl in accordance with the American Diabetes Association. 13 Information was also collected on the number of cigarettes smoked per day and duration of smoking. People consuming one drink in a week were considered as alcohol users. 2 ml of venous blood was collected from each participant/subject in an EDTA tube for DNA extraction. DNA was isolated by salting out method. 14 In brief, equal amount of RBC lysis buf-ABSTRACT Background: Ischemic stroke is a complex vascular and metabolic process resulting in neuronal death and progression with time. Cytokines play a role in immune response and also maintains the normal homeostatic environment of the central nervous system. IFN-γ is one of the key effector cytokines produced by NK and T cells that enhances microbicidal activity of macrophages and neutrophils. Purpose: As the association of IFNγ +874A/T gene polymorphism with stroke has not been investigated in Indian population, we wanted to evaluate the association of this polymorphism with ischemic stroke in a South Indian population. Methods: We genotyped 171 ischemic stroke patients and 153 age-matched control subjects. Results: Statistical analysis showed a significant association of TT homozygote with ischemic stroke (OR=1.9, 95% CI=1.05-3.43, p=0.03), while AA (OR= 0.84, 95% CI=0.54-1.31, p=0.46) and AT(OR=0.80, 95% CI=0.51-1.26, p=0.34) genotypes were not significantly associated. A and T allele frequencies in stroke were 58.78% and 41.22% as against 65.36% and 34.64% in control group, respectively, thus, suggesting no statistically significant differences in the A (OR=0.75, 95% CI=0.54-1.03, p=0.08) and T (OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.96-1.82, p=0.08) allele frequencies between the two groups. Conclusion: We conclude that the IFN-γ +874 TT genotype is associated with the increased risk of ischemic stroke.
