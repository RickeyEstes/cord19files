The Ϫ2/Ϫ1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (Ϫ2/Ϫ1 PRF) mechanism in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) leads to the translation of two additional viral proteins, nonstructural protein 2TF (nsp2TF) and nsp2N. This Ϫ2/Ϫ1 PRF mechanism is transactivated by a viral protein, nsp1␤, and cellular poly(rC) binding proteins (PCBPs). Critical elements for Ϫ2/Ϫ1 PRF, including a slippery sequence and a downstream C-rich motif, were also identified in 11 simarteriviruses. However, the slippery sequences (XXXUCUCU instead of XXXUUUUU) in seven simarteriviruses can only facilitate Ϫ2 PRF to generate nsp2TF. The nsp1␤ of simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) was identified as a key factor that transactivates both Ϫ2 and Ϫ1 PRF, and the universally conserved Tyr111 and Arg114 in nsp1␤ are essential for this activity. In vitro translation experiments demonstrated the involvement of PCBPs in simarterivirus Ϫ2/Ϫ1 PRF. Using SHFV reverse genetics, we confirmed critical roles of nsp1␤, slippery sequence, and C-rich motif in Ϫ2/Ϫ1 PRF in SHFV-infected cells. Attenuated virus growth ability was observed in SHFV mutants with impaired expression of nsp2TF and nsp2N. Comparative genomic sequence analysis showed that key elements of Ϫ2/Ϫ1 PRF are highly conserved in all known arteriviruses except equine arteritis virus (EAV) and wobbly possum disease virus (WPDV). Furthermore, Ϫ2/Ϫ1 PRF with SHFV PRF signal RNA can be stimulated by heterotypic nsp1␤s of all non-EAV arteriviruses tested. Taken together, these data suggest that Ϫ2/Ϫ1 PRF is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism employed in non-EAV/-WPDV arteriviruses for the expression of additional viral proteins that are important for viral replication.
