An ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus 2) is hitting Wuhan City and has spread to other provinces/cities of China and overseas. It very 29 urgent to forecast the future course of the outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the potential 30 total number of confirmed cases in mainland China by applying Boltzmann-function based 31 regression analyses. We found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 32 14, 2020 for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were all well 33 fitted with the Boltzmann function (R 2 being close to 0.999). The potential total number of 34 confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI) 35 as 79589 (71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 36 16092), respectively. Notably, our results suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases
