Cellular mRNA of higher eukaryotes and many viral RNA are methylated at the N-7 and 2′-O positions of the 5′ guanosine cap by specific nuclear and cytoplasmic methyltransferases (MTases), respectively. Whereas N-7 methylation is essential for RNA translation and stability 1, the function of 2′-O methylation has remained uncertain since its discovery 35 years ago 2-4. Here, we show that a West Nile virus (WNV) mutant (E218A) that lacks 2′-O MTase activity was attenuated in wild type primary cells and mice but was pathogenic in the absence of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. 2′-O methylation of viral RNA did not affect IFN induction in WNVinfected fibroblasts but instead modulated the antiviral effects of IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT), which are interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) implicated in regulation of protein translation. Poxvirus and coronavirus mutants that lacked 2′-O MTase Users may view, print, copy, download and text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use:
