Objective: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an online tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19. Results: Using our online tool and the available social contact data, we illustrate that social distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s).
