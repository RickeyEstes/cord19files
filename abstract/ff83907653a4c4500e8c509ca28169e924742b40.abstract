We have combined in vivo and in vitro approaches to investigate the function of CENP-B, a major protein of human centromeric heterochromatin . Expression of epitope-tagged deletion derivatives of CENP-B in HeLa cells revealed that a single domain <158 residues from the amino terminus of the protein is sufficient to localize CENP-B to centromeres. Centromere localization was abolished if as few as 28 amino acids were removed from the amino terminus of CENP-B. The centromere localization signal of CENP-B T HE centromere (primary constriction) of human mitotic chromosomes consists ofa compacted network of heterochromatin containing highly repeated satellite DNA sequences and their associated proteins. The kinetochore, the site of microtubule attachment to the chromosomes (Luykx, 1965 ; Brinkley and Stubblefield, 1966; Jokelainen, 1967) , is situated at the surface of the centromeric heterochromatin . The kinetochore is now believed to be the location of the mechanochemical motors (such as dynein) (Pfarr et al ., 1990 ; Steuer et al., 1990; Wordernan et al., 1991) that move chromosomes in mitosis . Both gene expression and recombination are strongly suppressed in regions of heterochromatin (Brown, 1966; Henikoff, 1981; Daniels et al., 1986) . The interrelationship between the kinetochore and the underlying heterochromatin is unknown . Centromeric heterochromatin is largely composed of a-satellite DNA, a highly polymorphic family of repetitive DNA sequences that comprises N5 % of the human genome (Willard and Waye, 1987) . The role ofa-satellite DNA in human chromosome structure and function is not known . The consensus monomer for a-satellite DNA (171 by in length) is typically found in higher-order repeats that may be as large as 35-mers (Choo et al., 1991). Within a repeat, adjacent monomers commonly show up to 40% sequence divergence (Willard and Waye, 1987) . Arrays ofa-satellite DNA apparently span contiguous regions of the centromeric DNA of two to three megabases (Wevrick and Willard, 1989 ; Jabs et al., 1989) . In humans, only a single heterochromatin protein has been identified to date. This protein, CENP-B, was originally discovered when centromeric autoantigens (termed CENP antigens) recognized by sera of patients with scleroderma spectrum disease were identified by immunoblotting (Earnshaw
