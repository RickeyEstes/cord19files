In the current era of emerging pathogens such as Ebola virus, removal of personal protective equipment (PPE) is crucial to reduce contamination of health care workers. However, current removal practices are not well described. We undertook a systematic evaluation of health care worker removal of PPE for contact isolation to examine variation in removal procedures. Findings indicate that under usual conditions, only about half of health care workers correctly remove their PPE, and very few remove their PPE in the correct order and dispose of it in the proper location.

For many infectious diseases, standard and transmission-based precautions are commonly employed by health care workers (HCWs). These involve the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), which may include precautions against droplet, contact, or airborne transmission. Appropriate, consistent use of PPE is essential to reducing nosocomial transmission and protecting patients and HCWs. 1 In the current age of emerging pathogens such as Ebola virus, the order and technique with which HCWs remove their PPE is of the utmost importance. Improper removal of PPE may result in the transmission of infections to HCW. However, there is a paucity of literature on practices regarding removal of PPE in the setting of routine clinical care. 2,3 It has been shown that breaches in PPE use and removal provide opportunities for transmission of infections to HCWs. 2 A previous study that took place shortly after the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak of the early 2000s, concluded that conflicting PPE removal recommendations are available and that few HCWs are familiar with how to avoid contaminating themselves. 3 We undertook direct observations to examine the sequence and technique of PPE removal in an academic health center. Direct observations using a previously created and routinely used checklist were undertaken to collect data on the PPE removal practices of HCWs. Observations were undertaken from October 13-31, 2014, at various times during the week. Health care workers entering and exiting patient rooms were observed and documented, including physicians, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and nursing assistants. Observations were undertaken on 5 different units in our tertiary academic medical center: surgical transplant, internal medicine, general surgery, hematology/oncology, and cardiothoracic medicine. A single trained observer performed these observations outside of patient rooms for no longer than 3 hours at a time. All patient rooms observed were specified as following isolation precautions. HCWs caring for patients in these rooms were not made aware of the observer's presence, nor was the observer a part of the hospital's infection control team. No efforts were made to disguise the purpose of the observations if directly asked, but the presence of students at our teaching hospital is commonplace and usually does not provoke attention. Auditing of infection control and prevention practices is a component of typical infection control activities. We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations to guide our direct observations. These recommendations regarding correct removal of PPE state that removal of contaminated gloves should occur first followed by gentle removal of the gown from the back of the neck while in the isolation patient's room. 4 This was considered full compliance. If an individual failed to remove his or her PPE in the proper order, or wore a component of the PPE outside of the isolation patient's room, that individual was considered to be partially compliant. We observed PPE removal technique by assessing how the gowns were removed. An HCW's PPE removal was not considered gentle if the removal process
