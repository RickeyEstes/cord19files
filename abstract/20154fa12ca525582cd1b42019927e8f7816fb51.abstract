The use of metabolomics profiling to understand metabolism under different 20 physiological states has increased in recent years, which created the need for robust analytical 21 platforms. Here, we present a validated method for targeted and semi-quantitative analysis of 102 22 polar metabolites that covers major metabolic pathways from 24 classes in a single 17.5-min assay. The method has been optimized for a wide range of biological matrices from various organisms, 24 and involves automated sample preparation, and data processing using in-house developed R 25 package. To ensure reliability, the method was validated for accuracy, precision, selectivity, 26 specificity, linearity, recovery, and stability according to European Medicines Agency guidelines. We demonstrated excellent repeatability of the retention times (CV<4%), calibration curves 28 (R 2 â‰¥0.980) in their respective wide dynamic concentration ranges (CV<3%), and concentrations 29 (CV<25%) of quality control samples interspersed within 25 batches analyzed over a period of one- year. The robustness was demonstrated through high correlation between metabolite 31 concentrations measured using our method and NIST reference values (R 2 =0.967), including cross-32 platform comparability against the BIOCRATES AbsoluteIDQp180 kit (R 2 =0.975) and NMR analyses 33 (R 2 =0.884). We have shown that our method can be successfully applied in many biomedical 34 research fields and clinical trials, including epidemiological studies for biomarker discovery. In 35 summary, a thorough validation demonstrated that our method is reproducible, robust, reliable, 36 and suitable for metabolomics studies.
