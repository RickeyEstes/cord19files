It results from the alternate or synchronous contraction of reciprocally innervated, antagonistic muscles. • Disease of the nervous system (central and peripheral) and muscle may result in tremor, shaking or twitching. • Usually tremors with increased amplitudes and slower frequencies (coarse tremor) are associated with cerebellar disorders. Those tremors with decreased amplitudes and faster frequencies (fine tremor) are associated with diffuse central nervous system disease or muscle weakness. • Tremor can have differing amplitudes (the distance traveled during the movement) and frequencies (how fast the tremor is).
