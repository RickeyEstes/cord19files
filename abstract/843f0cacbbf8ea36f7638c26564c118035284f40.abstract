The HIV-1 protein Nef inhibits antigen presentation by class I MHC (MHC-I). Here the mechanism of this activity is revealed by the crystal structure of a protein complex consisting of Nef, the MHC-I cytoplasmic domain (MHC-I CD), and the μ1 subunit of the clathrin adaptor protein complex 1. A ternary, cooperative interaction clamps the MHC-I CD into a narrow binding groove at the Nef-μ1 interface encompassing the cargo-recognition site of μ1 and the proline rich strand of Nef. The Nef C-terminus induces a novel conformational change in μ1, while the Nterminus binds the Nef core to position it optimally for complex formation. Positively charged patches on μ1 recognize acidic clusters in Nef and MHC-I. The structure shows how Nef functions as a clathrin-associated sorting protein to alter the specificity of host membrane trafficking and enable viral evasion of adaptive immunity. Evasion of immune surveillance is a strategy commonly employed by viruses to persist in the host. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protein Nef enables the evasion of cellular adaptive immunity by antagonizing the antiviral activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes 1 . These cells recognize viral peptides displayed on the cell surface by the class I Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC-I) and limit viral replication by killing the infected cells. Nef antagonizes cytotoxic T cells by decreasing the surface expression of MHC-I, thereby reducing viral antigen presentation on the infected cells 1,2 . Nef plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection 3 : defective nef genes are associated with substantially delayed progression to AIDS 4,5 . Nef decreases the surface expression of MHC-I by associating the MHC-I cytoplasmic domain (MHC-I CD) with the clathrin adaptor protein complex 1 (AP1) at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 6-10 . The AP complexes are a family of heterotetramers that recognize cytoplasmic sorting motifs in transmembrane proteins and package them into clathrin-coated Users may view, print, copy, download and text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use:
