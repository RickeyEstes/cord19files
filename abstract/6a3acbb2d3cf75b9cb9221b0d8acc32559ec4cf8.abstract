Transgenic mice (Tg) overexpressing human apolipoprotein D (H-apoD) in the brain are resistant to neurodegeneration. Despite the use of a neuron-specific promoter to generate the Tg mice, they expressed significant levels of H-apoD in both plasma and liver and they slowly develop hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. We show here that hepatic PPARγ expression in Tg mice is increased by 2-fold compared to wild type (WT) mice. Consequently, PPARγ target genes Plin2 and Cide A/C are overexpressed, leading to increased lipid droplets formation. Expression of the fatty acid transporter CD36, another PPARgamma target, is also increased in Tg mice associated with elevated fatty acid uptake as measured in primary hepatocytes. Elevated expression of AMPK in the liver of Tg leads to phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase, indicating a decreased activity of the enzyme. Fatty acid synthase expression is also induced but the hepatic lipogenesis measured in vivo is not significantly different between WT and Tg mice. In addition, expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, the rate-limiting enzyme of beta-oxidation, is slightly upregulated. Finally, we show that overexpressing H-apoD in HepG2 cells in presence of arachidonic acid (AA), the main apoD ligand, increases the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. Supporting the role of apoD in AA transport, we observed enrichment in hepatic AA and a decrease in plasmatic AA concentration. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the hepatic steatosis observed in apoD Tg mice is a consequence of increased PPARγ transcriptional activity by AA leading to increased fatty acid uptake by the liver. highly expressed in the brain, adrenal glands, kidneys, pancreas and placenta and to a lower extent in intestine and liver [1, [8] [9] [10] . In contrast, the murine expression of the apoD gene is almost exclusively expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) [11, 12] . We have previously shown that transgenic mice (Tg) overexpressing human apoD (H-apoD) in the brain are protected against neurodegeneration and injuries [13, 14] suggesting that apoD could be a good therapeutic target against neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, these mice develop, with age, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance as well as hepatic and muscular steatosis [15] . Our previous observations showed that the peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma (PPARγ) mRNA expression is increased in the liver of H-apoD Tg mice [15] . PPARγ is a nuclear receptor implicated in adipocyte differentiation. Two isoforms exist: PPARγ1 is ubiquitously expressed while PPARγ2 is almost exclusively expressed in the adipose tissue [16, 17] . When activated by one of its ligands, PPARγ heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) and binds to the peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE) on the promoter of its target genes [18, 19] . PPARγ regulates positively its own transcription and induces transcription of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), which in turn also activates PPARγ gene expression [20, 21] . Many natural PPARγ ligands have been discovered including AA, prostaglandins, oxidized fatty acid (FA) and some polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Activation of hepatic PPARγ leads to an upregulation of free FA (FFA) uptake by increasing the expression of fatty acid transporter CD36 [27] . PPARγ is also involved in lipid droplets (LD) formation through increased expression of LD-associated proteins such as perilipin 2 (Plin2) and cell death-inducing DFFA-like effectors (Cide) A and C [28] [29] [30] . These LD-associated proteins down-regulate LD lipolysis by reducing association of lipases with the surface of the LD [31-33]. On the other hand, hepatic PPARα regulates energy combustion [34] by activating the mitochondrial and the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathways as well as the microsomal ω-oxidation pathway [35] . Paradoxically, PPARα also activates lipogenesis by regulating the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1c) and liver X receptor α expression (LXRα) [36] . Many studies have demonstrated a link between elevated PPARγ expression and hepactic steatosis. Adenoviral over-expression of PPARγ1 in PPARα knockout (KO) mice displaying reduced fatty acid oxidation in liver, induces ectopic fat accumulation and lipogenesis leading to hepatic steatosis [37] . In Ob/Ob and lipoatrophic mice, elevated expression of PPARγ2 is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) while inhibition of PPARγ expression reduces hepatic steatosis through downregulation of lipogenesis and inhibition of LD formation [38] [39] [40] . Lipogenesis is regulated at various levels. SREBP-1c and LXRα are the main transcription factors responsible for the induction of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression, the two rate-limiting enzymes of lipogenesis. These enzymes produce nonesterified FA (NEFA) that are subsequently desaturated by the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1). These NEFA are further esterified to form the triglycerides (TG) by enzymes such as the diglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) [41] . Lipogenesis can be inhibited by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) through phosphorylation and inhibition of both . In the present study, we demonstrate that H-apoD Tg mice express significant amounts of H-apoD in the liver. As a result, these mice develop hepatic steatosis through over-expression and activation of PPARγ1. Consequently, the expressions of Plin2, Cide A and C are increased leading to stabilization of LD. In addition, we observed an increase in CD36 expression associated with an elevation of FA uptake. In these conditions, lipogenesis remains unaffected despite an elevated expression of FAS and an inhibition of ACC activity. Overexpressing H-apoD in HepG2 cells in the presence of AA strongly suggests that the presence of hepatic steatosis in Tg Activation of Fatty Acid Uptake by apoD PLOS ONE | 2 / 21 protein expression standardized by amidoblack staining.
