Graphical Abstract Highlights d Inclusion bodies (IBs) of HPIV3 induce membrane rearrangement of ER d PI4P generated by PI4KB on IBs facilitates replication of HPIV3 d PI4KB is recruited to IBs via interaction with the HPIV3 phosphoprotein, P d Remodeling ER is a general mechanism for IBs of negativestrand RNA viruses SUMMARY Many positive-strand RNA viruses remodel the endomembrane to form specialized replication organelles. However, knowledge regarding whether negative-strand RNA viruses take advantage of intracellular membranes for replication is limited. Here we show that a negative-strand RNA virus, human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), remodels the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to form inclusion bodies (IBs), whereby the phosphoprotein (P) of HPIV3 recruits phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta (PI4KB) to IBs to generate PI4P, creating a PI4P-enriched microenvironment to promote HPIV3 replication. In addition, we find that human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) also takes advantage of the ER to form IBs and that these IBs are also enriched with PI4P. The nucleoprotein of HRSV recruits PI4KB to IBs. These results suggest that paramyxoviruses also exploit the host endomembrane to form IBs and that PI4KB is recruited by viral proteins to enrich IBs with PI4P to facilitate viral replication.
