Human respiratory syncytial virus is an important cause of severe respiratory disease in young children, the elderly , and in immunocompromised adults. Similarly , bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is causing severe , sometimes fatal , respiratory disease in calves. Both viruses are pneumovirus and the infections with human respiratory syncytial virus and BRSV have similar clinical , pathological , and epidemiological characteristics. In this study we used ex- the epithelial cells of the bronchi up until apoptosis was no longer detected , thus in the bronchi there was no indication of direct contact-dependent T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity in the primary infection.
