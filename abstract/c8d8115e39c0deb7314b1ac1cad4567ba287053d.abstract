Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) was the causative agent of the SARS outbreaks in [2002][2003]. A safer in vitro system is desirable for conducting research on SARS-CoV and to screen for antiviral drugs against the virus. Based on the infectious cDNA clone of rSARS-CoV-DE, in which the E gene has been deleted, a safe non-infectious replicon was constructed by replacing the S gene with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene. Successful replication was achieved as evident from continuous expression of eGFP detected by both fluorescence and Western blot. Treatment with antiviral drugs demonstrated that the replication could be significantly inhibited by 0.4 mg/ml of cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64D, but not by ribavirin. The same replicons containing further deletion of the coding regions for non-structural proteins (nsp) 1, 2 or 16 confirmed previous observation that nsp16, but not nsp1 or nsp2, was essential for efficient viral replication or transcription.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) illness which was caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1] first arose in Guangdong province, China, in late 2002. The virus spread rapidly to 26 countries and killed 916 people out of 8422 infected patients with a fatality rate of 11% [2]. Though SARS epidemic was finally controlled by patient isolation and the ban of wild animal trading, the significant morbidity and mortality, especially the potential threat from SARS reemergence, reminds us the continuous risk facing the public health system [1]. Moreover, the wide distribution and genetic diversity of SARS-like CoVs discovered in China [3] [4] [5] also serve as a warning for potential human infection by related bat-borne CoVs. SARS-CoV resembles to members of the three previously known groups of coronavirus and was classified as a member of group 2b in the family Coronaviridae based on phylogenetic analysis of genome sequences [6, 7] . The SARS-CoV virion contains a singlestranded 29,700-nt RNA genome of positive polarity. The first two-thirds of the genome encode two overlapping polyproteins, ORF1a and ORF1b. Like other coronaviruses, these two polyproteins are processed into 16 mature replicase proteins by viral specific proteinases and most of them are believed to associate with a poorly characterized replication/transcription complex that mediates the synthesis of genome RNA (replication) and subgenomic mRNAs (transcription) [7] [8] [9] [10] . Recently, the functions of several non-structural proteins (nsps) have been determined, including a non-canonical RdRp (nsp8), a single-stranded RNA-binding protein (nsp9), a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), a superfamily 1-like helicase (nsp13), a 3 0 ? 5 0 exonuclease (nsp14), a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (nsp15), and a 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase activities (nsp16) [11] [12] [13] [14] . The complicated interactions network among these nsps makes it difficult, if not impossible, to fully understand their functions [15, 16] . The rest of 3 0 end genome codes for four main structural proteins, the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S protein, which mediates both cell attachment and membrane fusion, is responsible for virus host range and tissue tropism. Proteins E, M, N can assemble into non-infectious virus like particles (VLPs) in the absence of S [17] . Besides the nsps and major structural proteins, SARS-CoV possesses several group-specific proteins and their functions during virus life cycle remain elusive and deletion of genes for those proteins seems to have no effect virus replication and/or transcription [18] . Recent studies on these group-specific proteins revealed that some of them may be associated with virus pathogenesis and virus-host interaction [19] [20] [21] [22] . SARS-CoV is highly virulent and classified as a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) agent, which can only be handled in a BSL3 laboratory. For in-depth study of functions of different viral proteins and regulatory sequence elements by reverse genetics, full-length infectious cDNA clones have been established using various techniques including bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector [23] [24] [25] and SARS-CoV replicon cell lines [26] , which can also be used for antiviral drug screening. Among them, the SARS-CoV replicon cell lines which retain the genes necessary for replication and 0006-291X/$ -see front matter Ó
