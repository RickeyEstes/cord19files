The possibility of performing fast and small-volume nucleic acid amplification and analysis on a single chip has attracted great interest. Devices based on this idea, referred to as micro total analysis, microfluidic analysis, or simply 'Lab on a chip' systems, have witnessed steady advances over the last several years. Here, we summarize recent research on chip substrates, surface treatments, PCR reaction volume and speed, architecture, approaches to eliminating cross-contamination and control and measurement of temperature and liquid flow. We also discuss product-detection methods, integration of functional components, biological samples used in PCR chips, potential applications and other practical issues related to implementation of lab-on-a-chip technologies. SUBSTRATES AND SURFACE TREATMENTS TO REDUCE BIOMOLECULE ADSORPTION Most PCR microchambers or microchannels are fabricated from silicon (10-25) or glass (26-36) substrate. Polymers, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (37-55), polycarbonate (PC) (56-63) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) (64-68) have increasingly been utilized as alternative substrates. New substrates, such as SU-8
