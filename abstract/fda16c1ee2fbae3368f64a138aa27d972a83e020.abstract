Formation of stress granules (SGs), cytoplasmic condensates of stalled translation initiation complexes, is regulated by post-translational protein modification. Alphaviruses interfere with SG formation in response to inhibition of host protein synthesis through the activities of nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3). nsP3 has a conserved N-terminal macrodomain that binds and can remove ADP-ribose from ADPribosylated proteins and a C-terminal hypervariable domain that binds essential SG component G3BP1. We showed that the hydrolase activity of chikungunya virus nsP3 macrodomain removed ADPribosylation of G3BP1 and suppressed SG formation. ADP-ribosylhydrolase-deficient nsP3 mutants allowed stress-induced cytoplasmic condensation of translation initiation factors. nsP3 also disassembled SG-like aggregates enriched with translation initiation factors that are induced by the expression of FUS mutant R495X linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Therefore, our data indicate that regulation of ADP-ribosylation controls the localization of translation initiation factors during virus infection and other pathological conditions.

Non-membranous structures are prevalent in cells and critical for cellular functions, including RNA metabolism, embryonic cell fate specification, and neuronal activities [1] [2] [3] . Although the components of these non-membranous structures are often dynamically exchanged with the surrounding milieu, the compositions of these cellular structures remain distinct [4] . It is, however, unclear how individual components are selectively retained in these non-membranous structures. Stress granules (SGs), one of the best characterized dynamic non-membranous structures, are RNAprotein assemblies formed in response to a variety of environmental cues [3] . In most cases, these environmental cues activate stress-responsive protein kinases that phosphorylate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), resulting in the stalling of translation initiation [3] . The sudden influx of untranslated mRNAs is proposed to seed the formation of SGs, where the polynucleotide promotes local concentration of proteins through non-covalent binding [5] . These RNA-binding proteins are highly enriched with low-complexity regions, and emergent data indicate that the nonspecific, weak interactions between these regions are responsible for the condensation of proteins to form higherorder structures, such as microscopically visible SGs [6] [7] [8] . Depending on the type of stress, the composition of SGs could vary [9], but certain common components, such as Ras GTP-activating protein-binding proteins G3BP1/2, are essential for SG formation [10, 11] . Dysregulation of SG assembly/disassembly and mutations in the low-complexity region of specific SG proteins are implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as viral infection, cancer and neurodegeneration [1, [12] [13] [14] . Therefore, understanding the regulatory mechanisms of SG assembly is critical for designing novel therapeutics. SG assembly is regulated positively and negatively by post-translational modifications of proteins, including those that conjugate simple chemical groups (such as phosphorylation, O-GlcNAc glycosylation, methylation, acetylation), attach polypeptides (e.g., neddylation), and add nucleotides as in the case of ADP-ribosylation [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .

In humans, ADP-ribosylation is accomplished primarily by a family of 17 ADP-ribosyltransferases, a subset of which is commonly known as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) [22] [23] [24] . Polymers of ADP-ribose [i.e., poly(ADP-ribose or PAR], five PARPs and two isoforms of the degradative enzyme PAR glycohydrolase (PARG) have been identified in SGs, where selective SG proteins are 25, 26] . Overexpression of these PARPs and PARG isoforms induces and suppresses SG formation, respectively, while PARG knockdown delays SG disassembly [19, 25] . PAR, like RNA, has been proposed to seed formation of non-membranous structures by facilitating the high concentration of low complexity region-containing proteins locally through noncovalent binding to the repetitive monomeric units of the polymer [19, [25] [26] [27] [28] . The non-covalent PAR-protein interaction also facilitates the targeting of specific proteins to SGs [25, 26, 29] , such as TDP-43-a key protein involved in several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Such a targeting mechanism based on PAR-binding to protein is proposed to regulate TDP-43 localization and prevent the formation of pathological aggregates in ALS patients [25, 26] . Certain PARP inhibitors prevent the neurotoxicity in neuronal cells [26, 30] , suggesting that pharmacological modulation of PAR-mediated protein targeting could have potential therapeutic benefit. SG assembly and disassembly are tightly regulated during infection by many viruses, often reflecting cellular translation status [31][32][33][34]. In the early phase of infection, the presence of doublestranded viral RNAs activates protein kinase R (PKR), resulting in eIF2α phosphorylation, mRNA translation stalling and assembly of SGs enriched with translation factors [32,34]. Yet, many viruses disassemble SGs or suppress SG formation [32,34], but the mechanisms and the physiological roles remain largely unclear. For example, the mosquito-borne alphaviruses, which cause a range of diseases from rashes and arthritis to encephalitis, induce SG formation transiently in the early stage of infection, followed by disassembly [32,[34] [35] [36] . Previous studies have identified the alphaviral nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3), a key factor for virus replication and virulence [37] [38] [39] , as able to suppress SG assembly [36, [40] [41] [42] . nsP3 is a tripartite protein composed of a highly conserved All rights reserved.
