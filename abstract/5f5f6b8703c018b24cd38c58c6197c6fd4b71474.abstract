INDEX Cross-reference terms in italics are general cross-references, or refer to subentry terms within the main entry (the main entry is not repeated to save space). Readers are also advised to refer to the end of each article for additional cross-references e not all of these cross-references have been included in the index cross-references. The index is arranged in set-out style with a maximum of three levels of subheading. Major discussion of a subject is indicated by bold page numbers. Page numbers suffixed by t, f, and b refer to Tables, Figures, and Boxes respectively. vs. indicates a comparison. The index entries are presented in word-by-word alphabetical sequence in which a group of letters followed by a space is filed before the same group of letters followed by a letter. For example, entries beginning 'air density' are alphabetized before 'aircraft.' Prefixes and terms in parentheses are excluded from the initial alphabetization. Where index subentries and sub-subentries pertaining to a subject have the same page number, they have been listed to indicate the comprehensiveness of the text.
