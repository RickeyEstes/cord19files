Traditional surveillance is defined as systematic and continuous collection, analysis, and interpretation of the predefined and representative data (e.g., notifiable report, diagnosis/treatment registration, and death registration, etc.), closely integrated with the timely and coherent dissemination of the results and assessment to those who have the right to know so that action can be taken. On the Internet, there is a lot of open access information related to infectious disease, i.e., official announcement, media news, bulletin boards, blogs, and other social media, which could be an important data source of nontraditional surveillance. With different, surveillance using Internet-based data has three characteristics: (1) The data amount is so huge and scattered, which requires proper data retrieving and screening methods to improve the timeliness of early detection for infectious disease. And the data sources generally have poor stability and representation. (2) When establishing an Internet-based surveillance system, it should be an event-based surveillance system, as it is nearly impossible to apply an indicator-based surveillance. (3) Its purpose would focus on the early detection or getting the whole situation awareness of a particular event, which might be an important supplement to the traditional surveillance. For example, when an infectious disease outbreak or epidemic takes place, in addition to notifiable infectious disease case surveillance or event-based surveillance and other traditional surveillance approaches that allow us to understand the situation, we can also identify epidemic situation that is missed or lagged by traditional surveillance system, through media reports on the Internet, official announcement, agency or personal social communication media, forums, etc., and learn about the people's risk perception and response to the event, and the response of international peers and other agencies, in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the situations. These characteristics of surveillance using Internet-based data have important implications for early warning of infectious diseases. Since the 2003 SARS epidemic, China became aware of the importance of information from nondedicated report sources, particularly surveillance using Internet-based data, in addition to the strengthening infectious disease Early Warning for Infectious Disease Outbreak. http://dx.
