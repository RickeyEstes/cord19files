The ongoing novel coronavirus pneumonia COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, has engendered 25 numerous cases of infection and death. COVID-19 diagnosis relies upon nucleic acid detection; 26 however, current recommended methods exhibit high false-negative rates, low sensitivity, and 27 cannot identify other respiratory virus infections, thereby resulting patient misdiagnosis and 28 impeding epidemic containment. Combining the advantages of target amplification and long-read, 29 real-time nanopore sequencing, we developed nanopore target sequencing (NTS) to detect SARS-30
