Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, has caused significant damage to the Asian and American pork industries. Coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CL pro ), which is involved in the processing of viral polyproteins for viral replication, is an appealing antiviral drug target. Here, we present the crystal structures of PEDV 3CL pro and a molecular complex between an inactive PEDV 3CL pro variant C144A bound to a peptide substrate. Structural characterization, mutagenesis and biochemical analysis reveal the substrate-binding pockets and the residues that comprise the active site of PEDV 3CL pro . The dimerization of PEDV 3CL pro is similar to that of other Alphacoronavirus 3CL pro s but has several differences from that of SARS-CoV 3CL pro from the genus Betacoronavirus. Furthermore, the non-conserved motifs in the pockets cause different cleavage of substrate between PEDV and SARS-CoV 3CL pro s, which may provide new insights into the recognition of substrates by 3CL pro s in various coronavirus genera.
