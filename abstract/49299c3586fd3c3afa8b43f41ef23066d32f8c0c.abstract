Synthetically combining the C-4 0 side-chain structural features of the antiviral candidates 5 0 -methylaristeromycin and 5 0 -homoaristeromycin into a diastereomeric pair of C-4 0 side-chain dihydroxylated aristeromycins (6 and 7) is reported. Broad antiviral analyses of the both targets found promising effects towards HBV (6, 6.7 lM and 7, 7.74 lM) and HCMV (only 7, 0.72 lM). No other activity was found. Neither of the diastereomers was cytotoxic in the assays performed. Ó 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. While the report of biologically inactive carbocyclic thymidine (1) in 1962 1 introduced a new class of nucleosides, it was the synthesis of racemic carbocyclic adenosine (aristeromycin, 2) 2 and subsequent isolation of the (À)-enantiomer from Streptomyces citricolor 3 that the era of carbocyclic nucleosides began and became a focal point for the pursuit of carbocyclic nucleosides as therapeutic candidates and as probes for biological processes. 4 Our interest in aristeromycin and analogs therefrom began with the report of 5 0 -noraristeromycin (3) with activity towards human cytomegalovirus. 5 Over the years 6 since 1992 we have looked back to see what analogs lie in the wake of our work that suggested a further look into structural possibilities. Recently, in that regard, we were drawn to our reports that 5 0 -methylaristeromycin (4) 7 and 5 0 -homoaristeromycin (5) 8 have meaningful antiviral properties that had not been developed through analog design. This stimulated us to consider combining the two side chain features of 4 and 5 into diastereomers 6 and 7 (whose designation is derived from 5 0 -homoaristeromycin in blue possessing a 5 0 -hydroxyl). The outcome of that pursuit is presented here (see Fig. 1 ). Oxidation of alkenes to glycols is well established in the synthetic organic toolbox. Thus, for this investigation, the known N-6 protected carbocyclic adenine nucleoside with the unsaturated C-4 0 side chain 8 (available from D-ribose) 9 served as the starting point. To achieve the requisite diastereomers 9a and 9b ADmix-a (for 9a) and ADmix-b (for 9b) were employed, respectively. Deprotection of 9a and 9b with 2 N hydrochloric acid produced 6 and 7.
