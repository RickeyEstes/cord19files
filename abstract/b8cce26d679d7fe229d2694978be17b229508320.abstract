we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1,295 undergraduate students in Guangzhou, China, where the population of immigrants from Africa is high (online Technical Appendix, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/22/1/15-0898-Techapp1.pdf). Our aim was to measure students' anticipated negative emotional responses and avoidance activities (dependent variables) to a possible outbreak of EVD (5). We constructed scales for the dependent and independent variables to assess EVD-related perceptions: 1) misconceptions/knowledge about transmission modes, 2) scenarios of an EVD outbreak in Guangzhou (chances, severity, control), 3) efficacy of preventive measures and self-protection, and 4) public stigma toward EVD survivors. MLwiN 2.30 (Centre for Multilevel Modeling, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK) was used for multilevel regression analyses (online Technical Appendix). We analyzed data from 1,155 (89.2%) students who had heard of EVD. To the example of 2-3 EVD cases detected in Guangzhou, 31.0% showed >4 types of anticipated negative emotions (e.g., fear, panic, worry); 59.5% showed >3 types of anticipated unnecessary avoidance. Most (80.0%) indicated >1 misconception regarding transmission mode (e.g., believed it was droplet or waterborne) but knew that direct contact with the corpse of an infected person (69.0%) and body fluids (81.4%) could lead to infection and perceived EVD as fatal (85.6%,) and highly infectious (81.6%). About half of respondents believed that effective treatment and a vaccine were unavailable (51.9% and 59.1%, respectively); 22.2% anticipated EVD outbreaks among Africans in Guangzhou (during the next 12 months). Many students perceived severe consequences if a small EVD outbreak occurred in Guangzhou and believed an outbreak would have a high fatality rate (70.5%), EVD is highly infectious (65.4%), an outbreak would be of long duration (47.5%), and the number of infected persons would be high (
