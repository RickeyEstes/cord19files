Analysis of the protein composition of t.omato spott.ed wilt virus (TSWV), purified by an improved procedure, by polacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed t,hree major structural proteins (of MW 84,000, 50,000, and 29,OOOdj and a minor one of MX' 220,000d. The three major proteins constitute about 98?;, of the total viral protein and all three were shown to be glycoproteins. One of t.he major proteins (MW 29,000d) and the minor protein were shown t.o be associat.ed with subviral particles isolated bJ t,reatment of virus with the nonionic detergent. Nonidet P-40. Only traces of the other two proteins were detected in t.he subviral particles. Synthesis of virus-induced proteins in TSWV-infected t.obacco leaves was studied by labeling infected and healthy tissue with ["HI and [lJC]valine, respectively. The labeled tissues were then fractionated into crude subcellular fractions and protein patterns of healthy and infected tissues were compared by coelect,rophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. Only one virus-specific protein (of MW J9,OOOd) was detected in the virus-enriched fractions; t,his corresponded with t.he viral structural protein of MW 50,000d. 12
