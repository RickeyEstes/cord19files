One cross-sectional study describing the clinicopathologic abnormalities in 24 dogs seropositive to Bartonella vinsonii ssp. berkhoffi was identified. Three of 4 anemic dogs tested were Coombs'-positive, 1 yielding an IME value of 3.81. Bartonella spp. induce IMHA is low. As the range of pathogenesis for this organism is still emerging, further prospective, controlled studies are needed to address this question. Borrelia spp. One retrospective study described 1 dog with IMHA that was seropositive for B. burgdorferi, A. phagocytophilium, and R. rickettsii. 2 Owing to the co-exposure status, evidence for B. burgdorferi as a cause of IMHA could not be evaluated. In a separate study, a Coombs'positive anemia was documented in a dog with Borrelia turicatae spirochetemia, 3 yielding an IME value of 2.37. Based on isolated case reports, the overall evidence that Borrelia spp. infection induces IMHA is negligible. Considering that Borrelia infection in dogs is associated with other immune-mediated conditions (notably polyarthritis), 4 future prospective,
