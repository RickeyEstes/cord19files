We describe here the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of molecules toward the development of novel peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . A docking study involving binding between the initial lead compound 1 and the SARS-CoV 3CL pro motivated the replacement of a thiazole with a benzothiazole unit as a warhead moiety at the P1 0 site. This modification led to the identification of more potent derivatives, including 2i, 2k, 2m, 2o, and 2p, with IC 50 or K i values in the submicromolar to nanomolar range. In particular, compounds 2i and 2p exhibited the most potent inhibitory activities, with K i values of 4.1 and 3.1 nM, respectively. The peptidomimetic compounds identified through this process are attractive leads for the development of potential therapeutic agents against SARS. The structural requirements of the peptidomimetics with potent inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV 3CL pro may be summarized as follows: (i) the presence of a benzothiazole warhead at the S1 0 -position; (ii) hydrogen bonding capabilities at the cyclic lactam of the S1-site; (iii) appropriate stereochemistry and hydrophobic moiety size at the S2-site and (iv) a unique folding conformation assumed by the phenoxyacetyl moiety at the S4-site. j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / b m c S1 0 -pocket that was larger than the size of the thiazole unit, and the N-terminal P4-moiety protruded from the binding site ( Fig. 1B) . Thus, P1 0 and P4 were sequentially optimized in a stepby-step approach that involved testing a wide variety of substructural substitutions in 1. The P2 and P1-sites were focused in parallel. As a result, some analogs were identified that exhibited potent inhibitory activity on the submicromolar to nanomolar range. Here we describe the results of these extensive studies in detail, including the design, synthesis, molecular modeling and biological evaluation of a series of SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors. 3CL pro inhibitors are generally synthesized by assembling two key fragments: dipeptidic 9 and the C-terminal thiazole derivatives 13 or 17. The dipeptides 9 were prepared via Fmoc-based solidphase peptide synthesis over Wang resin. The corresponding Fmoc-amino acids were introduced onto the resin via diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC)-mediated coupling in the presence of catalytic amounts of 4-N,N 0 -dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) in DMF (Scheme 1). The resulting intermediate 6 was treated with 20% piperidine in DMF to remove the Fmoc-group and coupled to Fmoc-valine, yielding 7, via the DIC-HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole) method in DMF. Further Fmoc-deprotection and the reaction of 7 with various carboxylic acids or acid chlorides produced the crucial P4-attached dipeptides 9 after treatment of resin 8 with trifluoroacetic acid/water (10:1) for 1 h. The dipeptides 9 were used directly in the next step without further purification. The syntheses of key intermediates on the path to the thiazoles 13, as well as the title inhibitors 2, 3 and 5, are indicated in Scheme 2. The optically pure glutamic acid ester 10 was converted to c-lactam-acid 11 26,27 by treatment with bromoacetonitrile, followed by reduction with PtO 2 (5%), cyclization and hydrolysis. Further coupling of 11 to N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine via the 1-ethyl-3-(3dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimideÁhydrochloride (EDCÁHCl)-HOBt method yielded the Weinreb amide 12. 26 The Weinreb amide was then coupled to an appropriate thiazole in the presence of nbutyl lithium (n-BuLi) or lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at À78°C to afford the thiazoles 13, which were deprotected and subsequently reacted with the dipeptides 9 in the presence of O-benzotriazole-N,N,N 0 ,N 0 -tetramethyluroniumhexafluoro phosphate (HBTU), HOBt, and DIPEA in DMF to afford the title compounds 2, 3 and 5.
