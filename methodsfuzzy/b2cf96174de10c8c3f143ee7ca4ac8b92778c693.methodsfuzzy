2.1. BVDV reference strains, field isolates, and other bovine pathogens BVDV reference strains, field isolates, and other bovine pathogens used in the study are listed in Table 1 . Three BVDV genotype 1 (BVDV1) reference strains, 13 BVDV1 field isolates, and 1 BVDV genotype 2 (BVDV2) reference strain were used to develop and optimize the RT-LAMP conditions. The BVDV reference virus strains were propagated in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Shijiqing, China, free of BVDV and antibody to BVDV). Thirteen field isolates were isolated from calves with typical BVDV clinical signs such as diarrhea, miscarriages and stillborn. For virus isolation, a total of 1 g of fresh aseptically collected liver tissues was homogenized in 4 ml of phosphatebuffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2). A 1:10 dilution of the supernatants was then inoculated onto MDBK monolayer cultures and incubated for 6 days. The presence or absence of cytopathic effect was recorded. After 3 times of freezing and thawing, culture supernatants were collected after centrifugation and stored at −70 • C for further characterization with indirect immunoperoxidase (IPX) test and electron microscopy (EM). All 13 field isolates were BVDV positive as revealed by both positive IPX staining and the typical BVDV morphology (40-60 nm in diameter) under an electron microscope. Five other bovine pathogens, 2 negative tissue samples (1 healthy bovine nasal swab and 1 healthy bovine blood sample), 28 fecal negative samples, and 5 individual MDBK cell culture samples were included as negative controls to test the specificity of the assay (Table 1) . All the BVDV positive and negative samples were validated by both the BVDV antibody test kit (IDEXX, USA) and an RT-PCR assay.
