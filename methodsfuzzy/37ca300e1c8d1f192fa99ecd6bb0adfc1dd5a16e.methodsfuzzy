The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) international standard method E1052-11 for ''Standard Test Method to Assess the Activity of Microbicides against Viruses in Suspension" was followed. The challenge viruses, PIV3 (strain C243 ATCC VR-93) and CMV (strain ATCC-2011-8 ACTT VR-1788) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). PIV3 was propagated in Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) and CMV in MRC-5 cells (ATCC CCL-171). The test substances were honey and lemon AMC/DCBA lozenge, cherry menthol hexylresorcinol lozenge, placebo lozenge, AMC/DCBA as free active substances and hexylresorcinol as a free active substance (Table 1) . A positive control (sodium hypochlorite) and negative control (dilution medium) were also tested. A 2.7 mL aliquot of each test substance (Table 1) was transferred into a 50 mL conical tube. Then 0.3 mL of the virus stock (titre of 10 6 -10 8 TCID 50 /mL for PIV3 and 10 5.5 -10 7.5 TCID 50 /mL for CMV) was added and mixed immediately (by vortexing) at ambient room temperature (21°C). Different contact times (1, 5 or 10 min) were used for each test (Table 1) . Upon completion of the contact time, the reaction mixture was immediately mixed (by vortexing) with an equal volume of neutralizer (RPMI medium + 10% newborn calf serum + 1% HEPES + 1% NaHCO 3 for the AMC/DCBA and PIV3 experiments, MEM for the hexylresorcinol and PIV3 experiments and MEM + 10% fetal bovine serum + 1% HEPES + 1% NaHCO 3 for the AMC/DCBA and CMV experiments). The quenched sample was serially diluted 10-fold with dilution medium. Serial dilutions were inoculated onto host cells in a 24-well plate (1 mL inoculum per well, n = 4 per dilution). The inoculated plates were incubated at 36 ± 2°C in 5 ± 1% CO 2 for 7 days for the AMC/DCBA and PIV3 experiments, 5-9 days for the hexylresorcinol and PIV3 experiments and 14 days for the AMC/ DCBA and CMV experiments. After the incubation period, the titre of infectious virus was determined by TCID 50 assay using the Spearman-Karber formula. The results from the negative control was used as the input viral load and compared with the test substances to evaluate the viral reduction by each test substance. Each experiment (for each test substance, each control and each contact time) was run in triplicate. The mean reductions in viral titre were compared between the test substances and the placebo lozenge using the two-sided Student t-test. Additional control tests were also conducted to assess the effectiveness of the neutralizer and cytotoxicity of the test substances. A 2.7 mL aliquot of the test substance (each lozenge and each combination of free active substances) was mixed with 0.3 mL of dilution medium, incubated at ambient room temperature (21°C) for each contact time, and then an equal volume of neutralizer was added. Following serial dilution of the reaction mixture in dilution medium, 100 lL of a low titred virus stock (containing no more than approximately 5000 units of virus) was added to 4.5 mL of each dilution and incubated at ambient room temperature (21°C) for at least 10 min. These were then inoculated onto the host cells which were assessed for the presence of infectious virus at the end of the incubation period. To evaluate cytotoxicity, the AMC, amylmetacresol; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DCBA, 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol; MEM, minimum essential medium; PIV3, parainfluenza virus type 3. * 4.2 g sodium bicarbonate, 0.5 g sodium chloride, and 0.2 g potassium carbonate was added to $900 mL of sterile deionized water. 3 g of bovine serum albumin was added to the solution and the pH adjusted to 6.5 ± 0.5. Sterile deionized water was added to reach a total volume of 1000 mL. condition of the host cells was recorded at the end of the incubation period. The viability of the host cells and sterility of the cell culture medium were tested by inoculating control cells with medium during the incubation period of the study. The titre of the virus stock was confirmed by inoculating virus stock onto the host cells.
