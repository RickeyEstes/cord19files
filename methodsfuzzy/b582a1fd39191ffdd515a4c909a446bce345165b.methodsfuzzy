11 available complete genome sequences of archaeal virus were downloaded from NCBI (〈http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/〉), involving sulfolobus virus Kamchatka 1 (SSVK1), sulfolobus virus 2 (SSV2), sulfolobus virus 1 (SSV1), sulfolobus spindle-shaped virus Ragged Hills (SSVRH), sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus 1 (SIRV1), sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus 2 (SIRV2), sulfolobus spindle-shaped virus 4 (SSSV4), acidianus rod-shaped virus 1 (ARV1), acidianus filamentous virus 1 (AFV1), halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 (HRPV1), and natrialba phage PhiCh1 (PhiCh1) ( Table 1 ). The former nine belongs to viruses in the kingdom Crenarchaeota, while the latter two pertains to viruses in the kingdom Euryarchaeota. The genome serial number (GSN), strain, their responding host, Genbank accession numbers, genome length, G þC content and references are listed in Table 1 . From these genomes, we only extract the predicted ORFs that show significant matches to sequences in public databases. In addition, to minimize the sampling error, genes either with 499% sequence identities or have internal termination codons were excluded. Also, we only retain those genes, which are greater than or equal to 300 bp. Finally 26 genes were selected for analysis (Table 2) . Correlation analysis was carried out using the Spearman's rank correlation analysis method. In order to compare the variation of codon usage among different gene groups, one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) and multiple comparison have been used. Using a hierarchical cluster method the cluster analysis and the distances between selected sequences were calculated by the Euclidean distance method. All statistical analyses, as well as cluster analysis, were implemented using the statistical analysis software SPSS Version 11.5.
