Summaries of the subject characteristics were obtained within the two study cohorts, counts and percentages for categorical features and medians and interquartile ranges (25th and 75th percentiles) for continuous features. Principal components analysis of a large collection of independent SNPs was applied to estimate and define racial groups, as previously described [34, 35] . As the Rochester cohort was predominantly Caucasian, the data for both cohorts was subset to this race. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested within the Caucasian subsets of each cohort. Principal component analysis was repeated via EIGENSTRAT [36] on a collection of SNPs except those that were in low linkage disequilibrium (r 2 ,0.1) and that had HWE p-values.1610 23 . Non-autosomal SNPs, or SNPs that had a minor allele frequency less than 0.01, were not included in these population stratification analyses, which produced additional race and cohort-specific population stratification eigenvectors. Linear regression models, which modeled the quantitative neutralizing antibody outcome as a linear combination of covariates and SNP genotype variables, were used to assess associations between neutralizing antibody levels and SNP genotypes. An additive genetic model, which coded SNP genotypes into a single variable reflecting the number of minor alleles carried by each individual, was used for the primary tests of significance. As sensitivity analyses, dominant and recessive genetic effects were also examined for their associations with the outcome, but for most of the SNPs these alternative models did not prove to be superior compared to the additive genetic model used in our primary assessment of significance. Neutralizing antibody (NT 50 ) levels were analyzed as the phenotype of interest after logarithmic transformation in order to conform to linear models assumptions. SNP associations were assessed while adjusting for gender, assay batch effect, quartiles of age at enrollment, immunization age, time since last immunization to enrollment, and race-specific population stratification eigenvectors. Associations were tested independently within each cohort, and the results were compared between the two cohorts. In order to determine which SNPs were potentially associated with neutralizing antibody titers across the two study cohorts, a fixed effects meta-analysis was performed for each SNP [37] . These metaanalyses used estimates of effect from the two study cohorts, and combined them using a fixed effects paradigm, to obtain a pooled estimate of effect, along with its pooled standard error and test of significance. Additionally, the meta-analyses provided a test of heterogeneity between cohorts. SNPs that did not display significant heterogeneity between the two cohorts (p.0.1) and that had meta-analysis p-values less than 0.05 were considered to be potentially associated with neutralizing antibody levels, and meriting further follow-up in future studies. Analyses were carried out using the SAS software system (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and the PLINK whole genome data analysis software package.
