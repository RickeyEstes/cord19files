Cells from Human Donors. Cord blood (CB) was generously donated from the Cleveland Cord Blood Center, Cleveland, for isolation of CD34 + cells and adult mobilized peripheral blood CD34 + cells were obtained from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Processing and Procurement Core under the approved institutional protocol of the Scripps Research Institute (no. IRB-13-6173). Viruses and Infections. Replication-incompetent lentivector (HIV-VSV-G) was produced by transfecting 293T with 15 μg of pNL4-3ΔEnv (82) (a gift from O. Schwartz, Institut Pasteur, Paris) and 5 μg of pMD2.G (VSV-G, 12259; Addgene) using the calcium phosphate method. Briefly, six million 293T cells were seeded in a T75 flask. Plasmid DNA was mixed with sterile H 2 O, CaCl 2 , and Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer, and the totality was combined with Hepes-buffered saline (HBS). The transfection volume was added dropwise, and cells were incubated at 37°C for 48 h. Supernatants were clarified by centrifugation, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, and stored at −80°C. Lentivector titers were measured using an HIV-1 p24 ELISA kit (XpressBio). To produce lentivector for FRET-based virus-cell fusion measurements, 293Ts were transfected with 15 μg of pNL4-3ΔEnv, 5 μg of pMD2.G (VSV-G), and 5 μg of pCMV4-BlaM-Vpr (21950; Addgene). HeLa cells were seeded in 24-well plates (50,000 per well) overnight and overlaid with 50 ng of p24 equivalent of BlaM-Vpr-containing HIV-VSV-G for 2 h. Cells were washed and labeled with the CCF2-AM β-lactamase Loading Kit (Invitrogen) for an additional 2 h and analyzed for virus-cell fusion as described (18, 83) . Influenza A virus [A/PR/8/34 (PR8), H1N1] and Sendai virus (Cantell strain) supplied as clarified allantoic fluid were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Infectious virus titers were calculated using a flow cytometry-based method in HeLa cells (84) , and infections were performed as follows: Cells were seeded in 24-well plates (50,000 per well) overnight and overlaid with indicated amounts of virus in a final volume of 225 μL for ∼18 h. Cells were washed with 1× PBS, detached with Trypsin-EDTA, fixed/permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm, immunostained with antibodies to IAV NP or SeV proteins, respectively, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Flow Cytometry. Cells were fixed/permeabilized with Cytofix/CytoPerm reagent (BD) for 20 min and washed in Perm/Wash buffer (BD). Cells were pelleted and resuspended in primary antibodies diluted in Perm/Wash buffer, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and washed in Perm/Wash buffer. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in Perm/Wash buffer, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and washed in Perm/Wash buffer, and cells were acquired and analyzed on a LSRFortessa (BD). The following primary antibodies were used to score virus infections: anti-HIV Gag KC57-FITC (BD), anti-p24 Gag (3537; NIH AIDS Reagent Resource), anti-IAV-NP (AA5H; Abcam), and anti-SeV (PD029; MBL). Endogenous IFITM3 was measured by anti-IFITM3 (EPR5242; Abcam) while exogenous IFITM3 WT and mutants, IFITM2, and IFITM1 expressed from pQCXIP were measured by anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma). Endogenous LAMP1 and EEA1 were measured by anti-LAMP1 (H5G11, sc-18821; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-EEA1 (clone 14, 610456; BD). The following reagent was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: Human Recombinant IFN Beta, rHuIFN-β ser17 (NR-3085). Plasmid Transfection, RNA Interference, and CRISPR-Cas9-Generated Knockouts. LAMP1-RFP (carboxyl-terminal tag, a gift from V. Pathak, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD) was transfected into TZM-bl and HeLa cells using Mirus TransIT-LT1. IFITM3-YFP (amino-terminal tag; Genecopoeia) was transfected into HeLa cells using Mirus TransIT-LT1. Stably expressing cells were created following selection with Geneticin/G418 for 3 wk. pQCXIP-IFITM1, -IFITM2, -IFITM3 (a gift from C. Liang, McGill University, Montreal), and -IFITM3 mutants containing amino-terminal FLAG (previously described) (47, 83) were transfected into 293T cells with Mirus TransIT-LT1. Stably expressing cells were created following selection with puromycin for more than 2 wk. HeLa cells stably expressing shRNA were created by transduction with a pGIPZ-GFP-based lentivector expressing shRNA (scrambled control and IFITM3) (V3LHS_325106; Thermo Fisher). HeLa and TZM-bl IFITM3 KO cells were created by transfection with a set of plasmids encoding Cas9 and three IFITM3-specific guide RNAs (sc-403281; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a set of three plasmids providing templates for homologydirected repair (sc-403281-HDR; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A population of modified cells was selected following puromycin treatment for 3 wk. HeLa SDS/PAGE and Western Blot Analysis. Whole cell lysis was performed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with Halt Protease Inhibitor mixture EDTA-free (Thermo Fisher). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and supernatants were collected and stored at −80°C. Protein concentration was determined with the Protein Assay Kit II (Bio-Rad), and 5 to 15 μg of protein were loaded into 12% acrylamide Criterion XT Bis-Tris Precast Gels (Bio-Rad). Electrophoresis was run with NuPage Mes SDS Running Buffer (Invitrogen), and proteins were transferred to Amersham Protrain Premium Nitrocellulose Membrane, pore size 0.20 μm (GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer in PBS (Li-Cor) and incubated with dilutions of the following primary antibodies: anti-IFITM1 (60074-1-Ig; Proteintech), anti-IFITM2 (66137-1-Ig; Proteintech), anti-IFITM3 (ab109429; Abcam), anti-IFITM2/3 (66081-1-Ig; Proteintech), antitransferrin receptor (ab1086; Abcam), anti-LC3 (PM036; MBL), anti-TSG101 (14497-1-AP; Proteintech), anti-ATG9a (ab108338; Abcam), anti-Raptor (42-4000; Thermo Fisher), anti-Rictor (D16H9, 9486; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-actin (C4, sc-47778; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-tubulin (B-7, sc-5286; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary antibodies conjugated to DyLight 800 or 680 (Li-Cor) and the Li-Cor Odyssey imaging system were used to reveal specific protein detection. Images were analyzed and assembled using ImageStudioLite (Li-Cor) .
