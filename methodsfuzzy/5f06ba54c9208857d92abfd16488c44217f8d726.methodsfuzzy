Scintillator crystal preparation The single crystal Ce:GAGG was synthesized using the conventional Czochralski method in Furukawa11,12. For luminescence measurements and all experiments except for implantation in the brain, the crystal was fabricated into 3−8 mm rectangular blocks 0.5−1 mm thick. For implanting the crystals in the mouse brain, rod-shaped Ce:GAGG crystals (0.5 mm × 0.5 mm × 3.0 mm) obtained from Furukawa were cut into smaller pieces (0.5 mm × 0.5 mm × 1.0−1.5 mm) using a laser cutter and then slightly filed to round off the corners.
