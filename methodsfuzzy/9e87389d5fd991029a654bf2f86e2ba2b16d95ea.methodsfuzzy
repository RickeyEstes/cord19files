Ziehl Table 1-2 on morphological identification is reduced and diagnosis often requires examination of multiple fecal specimens. In these cases, the newer enzyme immunoassays designed to detect Cryptosporidium antigens in feces have proven more sensitive. 40 Difficulties in detection and enumeration of oocysts in fecal specimens are compounded by variation in consistency among individual fecal specimens, the amount of specimen used, and oocyst losses incurred during recovery processes. Real-time PCR for diagnosis of Cryptosporidium spp. infection is readily available in large reference laboratories, and studies utilizing this diagnostic modality have demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. in infected cats compared with microscopic evaluation and immunoassay methods. 6 A study compared the performance characteristics of a ZN stain, direct fluorescent antibody technique, and three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests (Table  1 -2). 21 It revealed that the Remel ProSpecT Microplate ELISA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lenexa, Kansas) was the most sensitive diagnostic test for Cryptosporidium spp. on a single day, whereas the ProSpecT Rapid ELISA was highly insensitive and should not be utilized by veterinary diagnostic laboratories.
