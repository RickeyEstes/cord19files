This study was carried out on 256 K. pneumoniae isolates over a period of two years. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested for 14 antibiotics. ESBL detection was done as per CLSI followed by a multiplex PCR. Integrase gene PCR was done to detect class 1, class 2 integrons; similarly for class 3 and class 4 integron using specific primers. Sequencing was done for representative number of strains. Results: Out of the 256 isolates, 167 (65.2%) were ESBL producers. blaSHV (77.2%) and blaCTX-M (85.6%) were the most common. Of the 167 ESBL positive isolates, 121 (72.4%) carried class 1 integron; 51 (42.1%) isolates carried class 2 integron. Both class 1 and class 2 were found in 33 (27.2%) and none had class 3 or class 4 type. Sequencing and blasting results confirmed their identities. The drug resistant rates of integron positive isolates were 23% higher compared to integron negative strains. Conclusions: A higher percentage of class 2 integrons association with ESBL strains is being noted for the first time from our region, also the co-existence of both class 1 and class 2 types increases the higher risk of multidrug resistant gene transfer rates. These findings strongly suggest that integrons have a major role in the dissemination of ESBL mediated resistance among nosocomial isolates of K. pneumoniae. A total of 72 bacteria were defined by 16S rRNA sequencing (Figure 1 ). The antimicrobial susceptibilities of 72 bacteria isolated were investigated to penicillin, ampicillin, lincomycin, erythromycin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tetracyclin, and chloramphenicol by agar diffusion MIC method. Strains with high MICs for lincomycin, chloramphenicol and penicillin were tested for inactivation by Gots' test. b lactamase positive strains were tested for ESBL production. All strains with high level MICs for gentamicin, tetracyclin, and chloramphenicol were studied for the presence of known gene by PCR. Gram positive bacteria were tested for the presence of erytromycin, and vancomycin resistanve genes. The following genes were tested for their presence: ermA, ermB, ermC, vanA, tetA, aac-aph and cat. Results: Among isolates high MIC rates were 76.3%, 75%, 70.8%, 68%, 54.1%, and 47.2% for ampicillin, penicillin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin, respectively among all isolates. MIC values were evaluated for lincomycin, erythromycin and vancomycin among Gram (+) bacteria which showed 88.6%, 45.4%, and 15,9% high level MICs, respectively. Gots' test showed that, 35 isolates inactivates penicillin and only one isolate inactivates chloramphenicol. Among b-lactamase (+) strains one was ESBL producer. Of 20 isolates with high level erythromycin MICs 2 had ermB, 1 ermC, and 0 ermA. Of 51 isolate with high gentamicin MICs only 1 had aac-aph. Of 39 tetracyclin resistant isolates 4 had tetA and 2 had tetM genes but 33 were negative for both. Of 21 vancomycin resistant isolates 1 had vanA. The vanA (+) isolate was E. faecium and ST type of this strain was close to 17 with one allele difference. or Proteus mirabilis with reduced susceptibility to ESCs (cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime MICs >1 mg/L) during the period 2007-2008. ESBL production was confirmed using the double-disk synergy test. ESBL and CBL determinants were characterized by DNA hybridization and confirmed by PCR and sequencing. Clonal relatedness was investigated by RAPD. Results: A total of 444 cases of infection caused by Enterobacteriaceae with reduced susceptibility to ESCs were enrolled (268 by E. coli, 74 by K. pneumoniae and 102 by P. mirabilis). ESBL production was confirmed in 396 (89%) of isolates, CBL production was observed in all ESBLnegative P. mirabilis. Among the ESBL producers, CTX-M-type enzymes were overall the most prevalent (80% overall, 91% in E. coli, 90% in Klebsiella, and 12% in Proteus) and mostly (95.8%) belonged in group 1 (CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-15). However, CTX-Ms of groups 2 (1.1%, CTX-M-2) and 9 (3.1%, CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-27) were also detected. Other ESBLs included TEM-and SHV-type variants (10% and 4.7% overall, respectively, including TEM-92, TEM-72 and SHV-12, SHV-2a). All CBLs belonged in the CMY-2 lineage, being totally represented by CMY-16. Clonal heterogeneity was observed among the ESBL producers of each species, although clonal expansion phenomena caused by CTX-M-producing E. coli ST131 were observed. All CBLproducing P. mirabilis isolates were clonally related with each other. A retrospective study of all adult patients with pneumococcal infections who were hospitalized at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, was carried out from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2009. In addition, a trend of prevalence of penicillin-and cephalosporin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PNSP and CNSP) from 1997 to 2009 in our institute was analyzed. Results: Of 86 pneumococcal isolates, there were 70 (81.40%), 5 (5.81%), and 11 (12.79%) patients with pneumonia, primary bacteremia, and meningitis, respectively. There were 56 (65.11%) males and 30 (34.89%) females with the mean age of 62 + 10 years (range 15-101 years). Of 70 patients with pneumonia, there were 67 (95.70%), 3 (4.30%), 0 (0%), 70 (100%), 0 (0%), and 0 (0%) of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), cefotaxime-susceptible S. pneumoniae (CSSP), cefotaxime-intermediate S. pneumoniae (CISP), and cefotaxime-resistant S. pneumoniae (CRSP), respectively. Of 5 patients with primary bacteremia, there were 5 (100%) and 5 (100%) of PSSP and CSSP, respectively. Of 11 patients with meningitis, there were 7 (63.64%), 4 (36.36%), 10 (90.91%), 1 (9.09%), and 0 (0%) of PSSP, PRSP, CSSP, CISP, and CRSP, respectively. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. A trend of prevalence of meningitis caused by PNSP and CNSP from 1997 to 2009 in our institute is summarized in Table. Conclusions: There is a relatively high prevalence of infections caused by PNSP and CNSP in adult patients in our institute. This emphasizes an urgent need to strengthen both appropriate use of antimicrobials and strict infection control measures to help reduce the occurrence of DRSP. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of imipenem, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone were checked by E-test analysis to these isolates. Primers specific for resistance genes (blaIMP-1, blaVIM-1, blaADC) and upstream regions of insertion sequences (ISAba1, ISAba2, ISAba3, ISAba4 or IS1008) were designed for PCR amplification and sequence identification. All 62 A. baumannii isolates in 2009 were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The 30-day mortality data of patients with isolates in 2009 were collected. Results: The upstream ISAba1 was found in 53 isolates with blaOXA-23, including Tn2006 (ISAba1-blaOXA-23-ISAba1, n = 47) and Tn2008 (ISAba1-blaOXA-23, n = 6), and in 9 isolates with blaOXA-51-like. All these isolates expressed full resistance to imipenem (MIC >32) (Table 1) . ISAba3-blaOXA-58-ISAba3 was found in 3 isolates and offered 2 isolates with resistance to imipenem (MIC >12). In the contrast, without upstream ISAba1, or ISAba3, isolates with OXA-type b-lactamases were all susceptible to imipenem. The upstream ISAba1 found in 50 isolates with blaADC-25 and the upstream ISAba1 or ISAba3 found in other 3 isolates with OXA-type b-lactamases offered these isolates with full resistance to both ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. Isolates with the combination of upstream ISAba1 or ISAba3 and OXAtype b-lactamases or blaADC-25 showed more resistant to imipenem, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone than those without such combination (all P < 0.001 All the strains produced one (77%) or more (23%) b-lactamases of different types. There were 4 types of b-lactamases with isoelectric points (pI) 5.4 (TEM-1), 5.7 (PSE), 7.0 (OXA-1) and 7.6 (SHV-1) detected. Predominant types of enzymes, responsible for the resistance to ampicillin, were OXA-1 (52.2%) and TEM-1 (46.0%). Frequency of other types of b-lactamases was lower: 17.7% for SHV-1 and 8.0% for PSE. Totally ten spectrums of b-lactamases were detected. The prevalence of one enzyme production in the studied strains was revealed − OXA-1 (39.8% strains) or TEM-1 (25.7%). The combination of two enzymes − TEM-1+SHV-1 or TEM-1+OXA-1 produced 9.7% and 8.8% of strains respectively. The other combinations of enzymes were revealed only in 1−2 strains. Few strains produced only one enzyme − PSE or SHV-1 − 6.2% and 5.3% respectively. Only one strain (S. enteritidis) produced three types of enzymes (TEM-1+OXA-1+SHV-1). The 24 isolates were identified to species level and underwent detailed susceptibility testing using disc diffusion, agar dilution MIC determination and automated "Walkaway Microscan™" methods. PCR was then used to detect the presence of CTX-M groups, and Escherichia coli isolates underwent PCR for phylogrouping. Results: Samples from outpatients, inpatients, and ICU grew 11 Escherichia coli, 9 Klebsiella spp. and 4 Enterobacter cloacae isolates. 33% of the isolates were from urine, 33% from wounds and sputa, 21% from ICU screening swabs and 13% from blood cultures. 11/24 isolates (3 E. coli, 5 Klebsiella spp, 3 E. cloacae) were from patients with contact with ICU. The patients from whom the 24 strains were isolated originated from the Middle East (13), UK (9) and Nigeria (2). The average interval from admission to detecting the first significant isolate was between 0 and 85 (mean 13, median 2 days). PCR showed that 20 of the 24 isolates belonged to CTX-M group 1, potentially CTX-M-15s by inference of the MICs. Care in ICU was a significant risk factor for the finding of CTX-M ESBL producing pathogens (p < 0.05). Phylogrouping of the 11 E. coli strains revealed 2 group A, 6 group B1, 3 pathogenic group D, and no pathogenic B2 strains. Conclusions: MICs, PCR and phylogrouping of the 24 isolates suggest that despite the profile of sensitivity being consistently to only amikacin and carbapenem, that this profile was created by expression of heterogeneous resistance mechanisms, which would preclude concerns about cross infection. Further work to characterise the CTX-M group 1 ESBL cluster and molecular environment of these genes could clarify the resistance mechanisms and origins of these strains. A. Doudoulakakis, A. Nika, P. Giakkoupi, M. Papadimitriou, A. Papaioannou, J. Kapetanakis, A. Vatopoulos, E. Lebessi* (Athens, GR) Objectives: Enterobacter cloacae has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen in neonatal units. The aim of this study was to investigate a massive colonization of neonates with ESBL producing E. cloacae in a 30-bed, university-affiliated, level II-IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at a large pediatric hospital in Athens. Methods: Routine surveillance cultures for the detection of multidrug resistant bacteria at the throat and rectum of the neonates at admission and weekly until discharge is a standard practice in our NICU. Environmental samples are collected during suspected outbreaks. Clinical and environmental samples are processed according to classic microbiologic methods and the susceptibility to antimicrobials are tested according to the CLSI guidelines. ESBLs are detected by phenotypic methods. Molecular typing of isolates is determined by PFGE after digestion of genomic DNA with XbaI. Results: On August 2010 seven neonates were found colonized with ESBL producing E. cloacae as opposed to only 5 neonates found colonized during their NICU stay (NICU-acquired cases), and one neonate colonized upon admission (referred case) during the last 12 months. A nosocomial outbreak due to ESBL(+) E. cloacae was then highly suspected, and a one-day survey was performed on 2/9/2010. Twenty out of 26 neonates were found colonized with ESBL(+) E. cloacae reported. Environmental samples were all found negative. To check if results obtained by the first study were reproducible, we repeated the conjugation assays and picked up 25 independent transconjugant colonies, selected with ceftazidime and rifampin. The plasmid and chromosomal location of bla(DHA-1) in the parental and the 25 transconjugants selected was then investigated by S1 and Xba1 digestion of the entire DNA followed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and probing with 32P labelled bla(DHA-1) probes. Results: S1-PFGE and hybridisation analyses with bla(DHA-1) probe among the donor and the 25 transconjugant colonies analysed revealed that bla(DHA-1) genes were carried on plasmids in the donor and six of the 25 transconjugants tested, but also on the chromosome in all cases. Moreover, multiple hybridisation bands were observed when hybridising the Xba1-PFGE with bla(DHA-1) in all transconjugants. Conclusions: Acquired AmpC b-lactamases has recently been described mobilised by integrative conjugative elements (ICEs). These elements are capable to transfer themselves from chromosome to chromosome via conjugation. As bla(DHA-1) was present on the chromosome of the donor and was transferred to the chromosome of all 25 transconjugants, we hypothesize that an ICE could be involved in the mobilisation the bla(DHA-1) genes in these E. coli isolates. Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) is a method to discriminate microbial isolates through the partial sequencing of selected housekeeping genes. The BioNumerics ® software is widely used for the storage and analysis of MLST sequences. With the use of an adapted plugin tool, BioNumerics automatically assembles and processes sequence trace files, connects to the online MLST database, and retrieves corresponding allele numbers, sequence types as well as available clonal complex information. The study was conducted in the Ankara Training & Research Hospital, a 670-bed tertiary care teaching hospital. The hospital contains 23 operation rooms and over 15.000 operations are performed within a year. On the 16th of December 2010 infectious diseases consultants went to the operation rooms of eight surgery clinics (Plastics & reconstructive surgery, general surgery, ophthalmology, ear-nose-throat, orthopaedics, urology, obstetrics & gynaecology (O&G) and neurosurgery) and investigate the prophylactic antibiotic regimen before the surgeries. The duration of the intended use of antibiotics after the surgeries was also included in the questionnaire. Results: Seventy-two of 196 hospitalized surgery patients were underwent different kind of surgeries. 50 of them (69.4%) were using prophylaxis. Cefazolin (45.8%), sulbactam-ampicillin (11.1%) and ceftriaxone (6.9%) were the most frequent antibiotics used for prophylaxis. In four patients (5.6%) combined antibiotics (metronidazole plus any antibiotics above) were used. 30.6% of the patients did not get any prophylaxis. The mean duration of the antibiotic use was 2.7 (1−22) days and the intended use of the antibiotic prophylaxis after the surgeries was 3.8 (1−10) days. 45 (62.5%) of the antibiotic prophylaxis regimens were inappropriate according to the guidelines. The reasons for the inappropriateness were as follows: wrong antibiotic (8.9%), wrong doses and duration (84.4%) and no antibiotics in spite of the need (6.7%). The study was conducted in a 132 bed-hospital. Antibiotic consumption was monitored one year prior (2008)  The CB group consisted of 9 patients (5 women and 4 men; mean standard deviation (SD) age: 49±9 years) that had been diagnosed with brucellosis between five and 35 years prior to the study. Two of the CB patients had focal disease (one spondylitis and one multifocal motor neuropathy). The remaining 7 subjects had non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, arthralgia and/or myalgia. Five of the 9 CB patients had been diagnosed of CFS. The control group consisted of 7 matched healthy volunteers (4 women and 3 men; mean standard deviation (SD) age: 31±3 years). PBMCs were isolated by densitygradient centrifugation. Target proteins were probed using a Western Blot procedure. Results: PBMC extracts from all subjects give rise to a major 83 kDa and a minor 37 kDa polypeptide band. The ratio of RNase L isoforms (37 kDa/83 kDa) of 0.4 used as a cut-off, allowed discrimination of CB patients from controls with high sensitivity (88.9%), specificity (85.7%), a positive prognostic value (88.9%) and a negative prognostic value (85.7%). The mean amount of the ratio of RNase L isoforms (37 kDa/83 kDa) in chronic brucellosis patients (0.84) was higher than in healthy subjects (0.22) (P < 0.05). The study was carried out in Tel-Aviv Medical Center from 9.5-30.11.2010. Patients were selected from different surgical wards: neurosurgery, thoracic, orthopedic, vascular and plastic surgery. Nasal swabs from the patients were collected using a double swab; one swab was used for molecular testing on GeneXpert (Xpert MRSA/SA Nasal Assay − Cepheid) and the other was used for confirmatory culture on solid (chromagar MRSA II and 5% sheep blood) and liquid medium (brain heart Infusion broth). Results: 174 patients were sampled. 54 patients (31%) were found to be cariers of S. aureus by molecular testing: 49 (28%) MSSA, 5 (2.9%) MRSA. Compared to routine culture the sensitivity and specificity of the molecular testing were 94% and 95% respectively; the positive predictive value (ppv) and negative predictive value (npv) were 89% and 98%. 13 patients had invalid results on initial molecular testing. On repeated molecular testing (with the swab used initially for culture) only 3 had invalid results. We analysed 55 septicaemic patients on the ICU in whom blood cultures (BC) were taken. Together with the BC (n = 90), an additional blood sample (EDTA) was taken from the same sample site, for analysis with the Sepsitest™-assay (ST). The assay consists of a pre-test-enrichment on 1 ml EDTA-sample, followed by bacterial lysis and DNA-isolation, and subsequent amplification using 16Sbased universal primers for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Amplicons are detected by agar-based gel-electrophoresis. In accordance with instructions of the manufacturer, EDTA-samples were analysed in duplicate, and a sample was considered positive if at least one of the duplicates was positive. Results: Of the 90 BC, 5 (6%) yielded positive results; S. aureus (n = 1), E. faecalis (n = 3), and CNS with E. faecalis (n = 1). Bacteraemia was diagnosed in 3/50 (6%) of the patients. ST was positive in 11/90 (12%) of the samples. Compared to BC, sensitivity was 80% (4/5 positive BC). In total 2/3 patients (66%) with positive BC was positive with ST. Seven patients had positive ST and negative BC. In all of these patients, the clinical suspicion of bacterial infection was high, and 3 of them showed positive BC during septicemia, but at another time point when no EDTA-samples had been taken for this study. These results might therefore represent additional yield of the Sepsitest™-assay. Sequencing of amplicons is currently being performed, to provide species-specific results and control for false-positive results. This study was case-control and prospective from 1387-1388, carried out in Bandar Abbas. 50 patients aged 4−16 years suffering from recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) over 3 months which interfered with their normal life style were selected randomly. 50 healthy preschool and school children with same age were selected as control group. Demographic data were collected in a questionnaire. After physical examination, both groups were checked for Helicobacter pylori stool antigen test (HPSA). Results: 58% (29) patients were female. 14% in case group suffering from RAP and 10% in control group had a positive HPSAg and 1 person (2%) had a borderline result. HPSAg was more positive in males, and not related to age, route of delivery child was born or the family history of peptic ulcer disease. HPSAg result did not differ significantly in case or control group. Initiation of supplemental feeding after 6 months was a strong risk factor for h.pylori infection. Objectives: The prenatal hypoxia is the leading of nervous system patology on one side and infectious processes with tendency of generalization on the other side. We use a tandem of markers in intensive care newborns: PCT − a biomarker of a bacterial infection and S100B − a marker of brain damage. Methods: 31 newborns (3−6 days) in ICU transported from maternity clinic. The gestational age was 28−40 weeks. PCT and S100 serum levels were measured by Elecsys immunoassay. Results: 13 newborns (42%) were with HIE and 18 (58%) with IVH. Patients with IVH was with pre-natal pneumonia in 10 (77%) cases and in 9 (69%) necrotizing coloenteritis. Whereas at patients with HIE an aspiration pneumonia is prevailed (11. 61%). Necrotizing coloenteritis is diagnosed in 4 (22%) cases. PCT level was1.54 ng/ml after hospitalization ( The level of S100B is directly correlate with PCT level (r = 0.51). Subsequent assay was made by 18 patients. PCT was 0.39 (0.192−1.1) ng/ml. In 9 cases PCT have normalized after initially levels more than 2 ng/ml level. In other cases decreased of PCT level before treatment was more than 50%. While S100B remained the same 0.347 (0.192-0.438 Every inoculation was performed in triple on blood agar plates and the experiment was repeated four times. For the implementation of the WASP in the routine microbiology laboratory, results of the inoculation of fifty urine samples and fifty MRSA-screening samples by the WASP were compared with results of manual inoculation. For urine samples, 1 mL was planted on blood agar and McConkey agar plates in a four quadrants streaking pattern. Ten mL of the MRSA screening samples (eSwab) was planted on a chromogenic agar and inoculated in TSB salt enrichment medium. After overnight incubation, enrichment broths were planted onto chromogenic agar plates both by WASP and manually. This study was carried out in 2009, among inmates of the fifth biggest Bulgarian prisons (men n = 367 and women n = 131) and a juvenile correctional institution (n = 86). Anonymous cross-sectional data was collected from prisoners who agreed to participate in the study and who were interviewed using a standard questionnaire including demographic, imprisonment history and HCV related risk behaviors items. Thereafter, the blood drawn from the participants were tested for anti-HCV antibodies and HCV-RNA. Discarded serum samples were tested also for a presence of hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis D antibodies (anti-HDV) and antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV Objectives: Shigatoxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are an important cause of foodborne disease. It is transmitted to humans primarily through consumption of contaminated food, such as raw or undercooked ground meat products and raw milk. We report on the first occurrence of STEC O174:H2 in Austria. Methods: Biochemical identification, serotyping and virulence testing were done at the National Reference Centre for Escherichia coli. A descriptive investigation was performed in order to describe the outbreak and to identify the outbreak genesis. The study has been based on a review of the medical records of adult patients older than 14 years, followed with the diagnosis of brucellosis from March 1997 to October 2010. The demographical data, disease diagnosis, course, treatment and termination data of the patients were recorded. Results: 317 patients, including 136 males (43%) with average age 40±17 were included in the analysis. There was a statistically significant relationship between advanced age and development of spondylitis and arthritis (respectively p = 0.000 and p = 0.028). Besides, the frequency of splenomegaly and neurobrucellosis among the young population was found high, which was statistically significant (respectively p = 0.005 and p = 0.001). In cases of spondylitis, the most common (~85%) involvement was of the lumbar vertebrae. Also there was a statistically significant relationship between high ESR and spondylitis, sacroilliitis and visceral abscess (p = 0,001, 0,013 and 0,049 respectively). We retrospectively examined 114 patients with febrile bacterial infections admitted to our department over a period of 2 (two) years. No one had a history of established cardiac failure. The diagnostic of the sepsis was based on clinical and laboratory data. We measured BNP, PCT and CRP in blood samples, taken the first 2 (two) days of hospitalization. The outcome was determined as survivors and nonsurvivors. Results: We had 66 female and 48 male patients. Among those patients, 68 were survivors (59,6%) and 46 (40,4%) non-survivors. There was a significant increase of BNP levels in non-survivors patients (1027) vs. BNP levels in survivors patients (432, 55) . Also the PCT mean levels were higher in the non-survivors's group (20,65) vs. the survivors's group (3, 6) . Finally, the mean levels of CRP in survivors was 167,21 and in the non-survivors was 166,4. Conclusions: In our study BNP and PCT levels measured soon after admission were increased significantly in sepsis and they seem to be a valuable prognostic marker in the outcome of these patients. The difference of the CRP mean levels in the 2 (two) groups was not significant. T. Cirkin Guzel*, N. Baykam, S. Menekse Yilmaz, A. Kocagul Celikbas, S. Eren Gok, H. Esener, S. Yaprakci, B. Dokuzoguz (Ankara, TR) Introduction: H1N1 influenza pandemic caused higher morbidity and mortality among pregnant women than in the general population underscores the medical community's urgent need for data regarding the safe and effective use of medications during pregnancy. Although the benefits of treatment appears to outweigh the theoretical risks of antiviral use there is few data about the newborns who borned from mothers who took medications for H1N1 during their pregnancy. In this study we aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of H1N1 influenza in pregnant women and follow up the health status of newborns of these mothers after delivery. Methods: Twenty pregnant women with clinical symptoms and diagnosis of influenza A (H1N1) were included in this study from October 2009 to January 2010. All the study population were followed up until delivery and newborns were evaluated for any complication associated with infection or medication. Results: Twenty of 276 hospitalized patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza were pregnant (7.2%). The mean age was 24±3 (17−30years). Thirteen (65%) pregnant women were in 2nd trimestre, 5 (25%) were in 3rd trimestre and 2 (10%) were in 1st trimestre when they admitted to hospital. Although 80% of patients had pathologic respiratory auscultation findings, only 4 pregnant patients accepted chest X-ray test and all of them had bilateral patchy alveolar opacities. Two of them required mechanical ventilation. One of the mechanically ventilated pregnant woman died at the second day of hospitalization. Six of the patients didn't accept to get antiviral medication. Only one pregnant women who got antiviral medication (oseltamivir) had premature birth at 36th week. All other deliveries were in term and no complications were detected in newborns up to 4th week of their life. Conclusion: Although early evidence suggests that pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe complications (including stillbirth) from novel H1N1, the benefits of treatment appears to outweigh the theoretical risks of antiviral use. Early anti-viral therapy, may bring clinical benefits to pregnant patients.  The clinical isolate of A. baumannii and the standard strain of P. aeruginosa PAO1were used in this study. To form biofilm, the 5cm square stainless steel plate was added in TSB of each bacterial suspension of McFarland No.0.5 and incubated at 37ºC for 24hr under anaerobic conditions. These stainless plates were added in water tank and irradiated a supersonic wave of 38 kHz for 5, 10 or 30 minutes. Whereas, a plasma flow generated by a dielectric barrier discharge in air at 12 kVpp with 2 k Hz was irradiated to another plates with each biofilm-formed bacteria for 1, 10 or 30 minutes. After irradiation, each plate was cultured on the MH agar plate at 37 oC for 24hr. Bactericidal effect was observed using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the above-mentioned cultural method. Results: Both strains of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa except biofilmformed strains were sterilized by the supersonic wave for 5 minutes. However, biofilm-formed both strains were not sterilized by that of 30 minutes. On the other hand, all strains were sterilized within 10 minutes by the plasma irradiation. With or without biofilm, the bursting of bacteria by the plasma irradiation was confirmed using the SEM. We performed an observational intervention study in a 550bed education and training hospital in Ankara, Turkey with twelve neurology-neurosurgery, ten coronary, six cardiovascular surgery and nine general ICU beds. The study was carried out in three phases, as preintervention, intervention, and postintervention. After six months of preintervention period, we performed education meetings to all ICU doctors and nurses. Education program highlighted prevention bundle of urinary catheter (UC) and CVC related infections. We observed CVC and UC with checklists and follow-up charts. CRBSI and CRUTI diagnosis were performed according to CDC definitions. Six months after the education, all staffs of the departments which decreased their infection rates were promised to be awarded with 10% pay raise. Results: During the study period 462 CVCs and 1258 UCs were inserted to 1075 patients and catheter days were 4313 and 6918, respectively. Most observed indications of CVC are peripheral intravenous access problem (41%) and haemodialysis (29%). Insertion sites were 41% jugular and 41% subclavian. 20% of CVCs were inserted in emergency conditions. Mean lenght of catheterisation was 11 days. Compliance to maximum barrier precautions was 41%, but this rate was correlated with doctors' education years. Most common displacement reasons for CVC were exitus (50%) and discontinuity of indication (32%). Compliance to prevention bundle was 13%. Mean lenght of catheterisation was 13.25 days. There was a relationship between the clinic which inserted the catheter and compliance to maximum barrier precautions for CVCs and UCs. We decreased our CRBSI rates from 8.2 to 3.19 (61%) and CRUTI rates from 3.7 to 2.19 (40.8%). The programme of prevention and control was implanted in 2003 after a nosocomial MRSA outbreak, with an incidence of 0.24% in 2002. It is based in a bundle of recommendations: identification, isolation and control of the incidental cases, early detection of the condition of carrier and record of incidental cases in a database. This computing record is linked to the hospital information system (HIS) that allows us to detect the hospital readmissions of colonized/infected patients. These patients are isolated immediately. Results: After the programme implementation, a gradual increase of the incidence was observed in the last six years at expense of communityassociated MRSA (0.08% in 2003, 0.09% in 2004, 0.13% in 2005, 0.15% in 2006, 0.16% in 2007, 0.16% in 2008 and 0.25% in 2009 ) while the incidence of nosocomial MRSA has kept around 0.1% (0.15% in 2003, 0.10% in 2004, 0.11% in 2005, 0.07% in 2006, 0.14% in 2007, 0.12% in 2008 and 0.12% in 2009) . The most frequent location of infection for nosocomial MRSA during these years has been always the low respiratory tract infection with or without pulmonary condensation (25.0%) followed primary bacteraemia (11, 8%) , and for communityassociated MRSA the cutaneous infections (72,7%). All patients were isolated after detecting the MRSA: the daily average was 5 isolated patients which represented 2.5% of hospital bed occupancy. We distributed a 12-question multiple-choice questionnaire to HCWs in both units between November 2009 and May 2010. We also recorded participants' demographic data. Each correct answer was scored as 1 and incorrect answers as 0. We created individual and grouped scores of adequate responses ranging from 0 to 12. Results: We collected 174 questionnaires from both the P-ICU and the N-ICU (91 and 83, respectively). Of these, 6 (3.4%) were returned by medical staff, 2 (1.1%) by medical residents, 99 (56.9%) by nurse staff, 18 (10.3%) by replacement nurses, 8 (4.6%) by nursing students, and 41 (23.6%) by nursing assistants. The overall mean score was 7.05. As for professional category, there were statistically significant differences between mean scores for nursing assistants (5.9) and medical/nursing staff (8.7 and 7.6). Moreover, years of experience were associated with better scores (>10y, 8.1 vs. <1y, 6.9 and 1−5 y, 6.7) and those participants who received training sessions in the last year had better scores than those who did not (7.7 vs. 6.6). Conclusions: Our results show that there is room for improvement in HCWs knowledge of prevention of CVC infection. Simple, easyto-obtain scores can help to evaluate the impact of educational and interventional bundles. Clinical epidemiology of nosocomial infections (POWI, VAP, UTI, BSI, . . . ) The records of patients >18 years old, admitted with head injury in Crete Univ Med Ctr between 1999 and 2005 were abstracted. Data were analysed with SPSS. Results: 760 patients (75% men, median age 41) were analyzed. Two hundred fifty eight patients (33% of the admissions) underwent 342 surgical procedures. Burr-hole was the most common procedure (29.2%). The median duration of surgery was 2 hours. In 23% of the patients there was some kind of drain inserted. Two hundred fourteen infections were observed. The majority were infections of the lower respiratory tract (47%), mainly ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) (33%), followed by surgical site infections (SSI) (17%). Fifty three of the admissions (6.3%) were complicated with at least one SSI, superficial or deep. The most common SSI was wound infection (2.2% of the cohort). The patients who underwent neurosurgery had a lower Glasgow Coma scale (GCS) on admission, they were more prone to be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and bear drains. They were also more prone to develop meningitis, SSI and had increased mortality. Multivariate analysis showed that SSI development was independently associated with performance of >2 procedures (p < 0.001), presence of concomitant infections, namely VAP (p = 0.004) and urinary tract infections (p = 0.001), insertion of lumbar (p = 0.002) and ventricular drains (p = 0.050) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak (p = 0.050). Meningitis was independently associated with prolonged hospitalisation (p = 0.001) and insertion of lumbar (p < 0.001) and ventricular drains (p = 0.0017). There was a predominance of Acinetobacter spp as a VAP pathogen (38%) whereas Gram(+) organisms (especially coagulasenegative staphylococci) remained the most prevalent in SSI (53%). Conclusions: Respiratory tract infections were the most common among patients with head injury. Device-related communication of the CSF with the environment and prolonged hospitalisation were independent risk factors for SSI and meningitis. The prevalence of the pathogens must be determined upon institutional basis for the establishment of proper treatment of these life threatening infections. The study was carried out at the Duzce University Hospital (350-bed). 2009 prevalence of hospital-acquired infections in our hospital was prospectively evaluated. A total of 11333 inpatients were searched. The study was conducted in adult medical/surgical ICUs at two university hospitals. All adult patients with ICU-acquired BSI due to Candida, excluding patients with neutropenia, malignancy or AIDS, between 2007-2009 were included. Potential factors occurring up to 30 days before candidemia, including demographic characteristics, comorbidities, exposure to antibiotics and antifungals, ICU-related factors (i.e TPN, invasive procedures) and outcome were determined. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed using broth microdilution assay method described by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. Results: Clinical characteristics of the patients were presented in the Table. Seventy-six cases (59,4%) of candidemia were due to C. albicans and 52 (40,6%) to NAC spp. Distribution of the first three NAC spp. was C. tropicalis (22/52, 42,3%), C. glabrata (12/52, 23,1%) and C. parapsilosis (9/52, 17,3%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the factors showed that presence of glucocorticosteroid treatment and a central venous catheter were variables independently associated with BSI due to NAC, compared with BSI due to C. albicans (P:0,001, OR: 7,18, 95% CI: 2,22−23,22; and P0,001, OR: 20,13, 95% CI: 3,64-111,18, respectively). A total of 65 patients died within 30 days of the diagnosis of candidemia. The mortality rate was higher in those with NAC than C. albicans BSI (61,5% vs 43.4%) and candidemia due to NAC spp. was independently associated with death (P: 0.04). Except for one C. lusitaniae strain, which was resistant to amphotericin B and four C. glabrata strains, which were fluconazole susceptible dose dependent, all Candida species were susceptible to fluconazole, caspofungin, voriconazole and amphotericin B. Conclusion: Presence of a central venous catheter and glucocorticosteroid treatment were significantly associated with BSI due to NAC. BSI due to NAC was significantly associated with death, compared with BSI due to C. albicans. The in-vitro activity of fluconazole is encouraging, and this agent, an efficacious, inexpensive and safe drug, can continue to play an important role in the management of invasive candidiasis. We bronchoscoped 3 patients: ABPA, prior IA and COPD and Aspergillus bronchitis. We compared (1) the UK standard method for processing respiratory cultures (BSOP57) (modified to plate 10uL instead of 1uL) with (2) high volume culture (range 20 mL − 2.3mL, avg 0.5mL) (100% plated) on Sabouraud dextrose agar (37ºC) and 3) real time PCR (MycAssay Aspergillus) preceded by DNA extraction using the MycXtra kit. The sensitivity of this assay is <1 genome, following a >10% extraction efficiency. Sputum samples were obtained before and after the bronchoscopy procedure. Material obtained was split into 'highly mucoid' material and more liquid material, if possible. Approximately equal volumes of material (33% each) were used for the PCR and 2 culture methods. Results: 21 samples were cultured. All (100%) were Aspergillus negative by routine culture and 14 of 21 (67%) negative by high volume culture. Only 2 (10%) were negative by PCR, 3 were below clinical cutoff (Ct <36) and 16 (76%) positive (Ct values 28.9-35.7). Of the 6 sputum samples (2 split), all were positive by PCR and 5 of 8 (63%) were positive by high volume culture (1−6 CFU). BAL samples were all Aspergillus culture negative, and 8 of 10 samples (80%) were PCR positive. In 2 patients the highest PCR yield was the initial bronchoscopy trap aspiration (often discarded as contains lignocaine), but not in one patient; hyphae and Charcot-Leyden crystals were visible in this sample from patient with ABPA and 19 CFU were grown in high volume culture. Prevalence of individual fungi T. Dantin-Delafoulhouze, S. Lucas-Daver, S. Dumas, T. Fosse, R. Collomp (Nice, FR) Candidaemia are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitals, especially among severe patients. Over the past decade, the epidemiology and antifungal therapies have evolved. Our university hospital is committed since 2005 in a multidisciplinary approach to help diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections (IFI) initially focused on costly treatments. Our objectif was to study trends in epidemiology, susceptibility, and antifungal use in our hospital. Methods: All patients with a blood culture yielding yeast between January 2007 and December 2009 were included. Patient data, epidemiology, susceptibility, treatments and interventions of our antifungal team were collected from computerized patient records, the Mycology Laboratory and the Pharmacy. Results: 74 patients were included. During this period a diversification of yeast species was observed, with a significant reduction of Candida albicans (25% in 2009 vs 52% in 2007) . The rate of resistance to fluconazole has not exceeded 6% among strains of Candida and the first strain of Candida parapsilosis resistant to caspofungin was isolated in 2009. First line antifungal treatments have been established according to local recommendations (96%). The antifungal team has intervened for nearly 80% of patients in 2009, to continue the initial antifungal treatment or to propose a de-escalation therapy (20%). In 2009, 45% of patients (11/24) died, underlyng the severity of those IFI. Conclusion: This work has underlined our local specificity both in terms of epidemiology (most important decrease in Candida albicans compared the litterature), and in terms of multidisciplinary management of IFI. Among the proposals from this study include the systematic monitoring of Candidaemia during our antifungal team meetings wathever the drug and the search for a possible nosocomial cause of these severe infections. We retrospectively included all patients admitted with AECOPD and isolation of Aspergillus over the last 3 years. IPA was defined according to Bulpa criteria. Charts were retrospectively reviewed and patients were classified into probable IPA and colonization. Results: We identified 68 patients admitted in the last 3 years with AECOPD and aspergillus isolation. Thirty-seven (54%) had COPD stage III-IV. Forty-six (68%) were male and median age was 69 (55−90). Fifty-five patients (81%) had increased dyspnoea and 52 (76%) had radiological alterations, mostly new infiltrates in chest x-ray. Thirty-nine (57%) received >700 mg of steroids during admittance and 16 (24%) had received >20 mg/day during the past 3 months. Twenty patients (28%) had more than one aspergillus isolation. Twenty four patients (35%) received voriconazole for a median of 19 days (1−50 days). Crude mortality was 21% (14/68). Patients with COPD stage III-IV were older (71 vs 63 years, p = 0,02) and had higher mortality, 13/37 (35%) vs 3/32 (9%) (p = 0, 01, OR: 3, 9 CI95: 1, (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Similarly, patients with COPD stage III-IV received more frequently high dose steroids 28/37 (76%) vs 11/32 (34%), p < 0,001, and had more frequently increased dyspnoea during admittance, 36/37 (97%) vs 20/32 (62%), p < 0,001. Neither daily dose of steroids nor voiconazole therapy were associated with increased mortality. In multivariate analysis, only increase dyspnoea was significantly associated with mortality. Conclusion: COPD patients stage III-IV had increased mortality because of IPA although it is lower than described by other authors. Neither previous nor high steroid doses during admittance were associated with mortality. We did a meta-analysis of relevant studies, identified through PubMed and Scopus. Eligible studies were those that reported BDG diagnostic data in cases with documented PCP and controls with other conditions. We excluded cases of invasive fungal infections or healthy controls. We performed a bivariate meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity and constructed a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (HSROC) curve. Results: Twelve studies were included in the meta-analysis. BDG data were provided for 334 PCP cases and 1663 controls. The pooled (95% confidence interval) sensitivity and specificity of BDG were 94.7% (90.2-97.2%) and 86.6% (81.5-90.5%), respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 7.1 (5.1−9.9) and 0.06 (0.03-0.12), respectively. The area under the HSROC curve was 0.964 (0.944-0.977 Objectives: This study assessed a pilot antifungal prevention strategy based on itraconazole levels in consecutive high risk patients with the aim of reducing empirical treatment. The patients underwent chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation for haematological malignancies and received itraconazole suspension prophylaxis. The study is ongoing. Methods: 48 neutropenic febrile episodes, 25 of which were refractory at 4 days to broad spectrum antibiotics initiated on day one, were studied. All patients had serum galactomannan assays (EIA) twice a week and trough itraconazole levels measured on day one of fever. If they were still febrile after 4 days, HRCT scan chest was performed. Antifungal treatment was required to be given only when well defined clinical, microbiological and radiological criteria were present. Invasive Fungal Disease ( Conclusions: The incidence of probable or proven IFD was 2%. Three patients with possible IFD died (all had received iv antifungal therapy). 20% of the patients overall had subtherapeutic itraconazole levels. Our strategy reduced the rate of antifungal use by 50%. We conducted a retrospective audit of 27 adult asthmatic patients who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for either ABPA or SAFS. All patients had previously received itraconazole. Vori (300-600 mg/day) or posa (800 mg/day) (adjusted by TDM) was given for at least 6 months if tolerated. Clinical, radiological and immunological evaluation was used to assess response. We defined response as improvement in symptoms and either fungal serology or radiological abnormalities. The rates of clinical response or failure and their adverse effects (AEs) after 3, 6, and 12 mos of treatment were analyzed. Co-existing diagnoses, Aspergillus antibody titre, vori and posa levels and lung function were used as covariates. Results: There were 27 patients, ABPA (n = 22) or SAFS (n = 5), 11 males, median age = 59 yrs. All patients had failed itra (n = 11) or developed AEs (n = 12), had low serum concs (n = 2) or itra resistance (n = 2). There were 34 courses of therapy analysed, 25 with vori and 9 with posa; only 2 posa courses were not preceded by vori (resistance). Clinical response to voriconazole was observed in 17/25 (68%) at 3 mos, 15/20 (75%) at 6 mos and 12/16 (75%) at 12 mos, compared to 7/9 (78%) at 3, 6 and 12 mos for posa. 6/25 (24%) vori pts had AEs requiring discontinuation before 6 mos compared to 0/9 posa patients. Vori AEs included GI upset (7), skin photosensitivity (11), blistering (4), visual light flashes (10), insomnia (2), visual hallucinations (2), depression (1), adrenal suppression (2), peripheral neuropathy (4), eye irritation (2), vivid dreams (1), dizziness (1) and headache (1) but most of them were transient and mild. Posa AEs included insomnia (2), GI upset and mild liver impairment. Among those who discontinued, 4 relapsed (one at 3 mo, 3 at 12 months). Conclusion: Both voriconazole and posaconazole are safe and effective treatment options as second line antifungal therapy for SAFS and ABPA. Larger prospective studies are required. The SNP S180L was determined in a cohort of 179 HIV-1 infected Greek patients. Analysis of the prevalence of this SNP in relation to the infectious complications was evaluated. Results: Twenty eight consecutive (28) patients with varied forms of tuberculosis were enrolled. The baseline CD4 counts of patients (mean ±SD of 556.8±297.8) were significantly reduced as compared with matched controls (1132.3±259.9) at a p value of 0.000. Further the pretreatment and post treatment values of patients were significantly different as recorded as follows: 556.8±297.8 versus 954.3±210.9 with a p value 0.000. The baseline CD8 counts were not significantly reduced (p value 0.013) as the values were 1136.0±512.1 and 1461.9±367.0 for patients and controls respectively. However, there were improvement of the CD8 counts after treatment; baseline counts of 1136.0±512.1 versus 1316.5±286.2 after treatment (P value, 0.002). A total of non-duplicated 315 semen samples collected from 127 infertile and 188 control men seen at the infertility clinics in Maternity hospital were studied after informed consent. Semen analysis was performed according to the guidelines of World Health Organization. The specimens were examined for the presence of Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma genitalium and Chlamydia trachomatis by PCR using published specific primers. Biodata, such as age, nationalities, and marital status were carefully recorded. Results: The frequency of genital U. urealyticum, M. hominis, M. genitalium and C. trachomatis in all semen samples was respectively 26% (82/315), 27% (86/315), 5.4% (17/315) and 8.3% (26/315). Mixed infections were detected in 14% (44/315). The infertile participants positive for U. urealyticum and M. hominis, respectively had semen samples that showed statistically significant difference in the mean of sperm concentration, vitality percentage, total progressive and rapid progressive motility in comparison to control fertile participants (P < 0.001). Similar statistical significance difference was noted for those infertile and fertile men positive for M. genitalium and C. trachomatis (P < 0.001). Infections in infertile men who had been married for less than 5 years were significantly higher than in infected fertile men of the same length of marriage. We randomly selected hospitalized inpatients in the North Denmark Region with a first-time discharge diagnosis of pleural empyema between 1995 and 2009. We retrieved and reviewed medical records and estimated the positive predictive value (PPV) of the empyema diagnosis. Definite empyema was defined by frank pus aspirated from the pleural space, a positive Gram stain/subculture for pathogenic micro-organisms in the pleural fluid, and/or an autopsy diagnosis of empyema. Patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of empyema in association with compatible radiographic features (e.g. pleural thickening, loculated and/or septated pleural effusions) who did not meet the criteria for definite empyema were classified as having probable empyema. Results: We could retrieve the medical records of 224/225 sampled patients with empyema (99.6%). Of those, we classified 182 (81.3%) as being definite empyema cases. Another 21 patients were classified as probable empyema cases. In 21 patients whose empyema diagnosis was rejected, eight had pneumonia, one had a pulmonary abscess, one pulmonary tuberculosis, one had sarcoidosis, two had emphysema. The overall PPV of the empyema diagnosis was 90.1% (95% CI 86.0-94.1). The PPV was 81.3% (95% CI 81.3-86.1) when including definite cases only. PPVs of empyema diagnosed in 1995-1999, 2000-2004, and 2005-2009 were 90.7% (95% CI 81.7-96.2), 94.6% (95% CI 86.7-98.5), and 86.7% (95% CI 76.8-93.4), respectively, indicating that no major changes in coding validity occurred over the 15-year study period. The PPV decreased slightly from 95.7% in patients aged 15−39 years to 87.5% in patients aged 80 years and over but was uniformly high regardless of study period, hospital or department type, or cause of empyema. Prospective, open-label study of 75 subjects randomised to daptomycin (DAP) 6 or 8 mg/kg, or comparator (vancomycin, teicoplanin, or semi-synthetic penicillin) undergoing 2-stage replacement for a hip or knee PJI. After removal of the prosthesis, subjects received 6 weeks treatment and a 2−6 week antibiotic-free period before implanting a new prosthesis. Test of cure (TOC) was 1−2 weeks after re-implantation. The primary objective was evaluation were measured to compare the prevalence of IDA and H. pylori infection in the groups. Results: 52.5% of cases were girls (53.1% of cases and 51.4% of control group) and 47.8% were boys (46.9% of cases group and 48.6% of controls). H. pylori serology was positive in 46.3% of cases and 19% of control group were infected. There were a meaningful difference (p-value >0001). Conclusion: Our results support the proposal that H. pylori infection is associated with IDA in children. A. Herrera-Martinez*, Y. Herrera-Martinez, M. Limper (Barquisimeto, VE; Amsterdam, NL) Background: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) during pregnancy pose a major risk to the fetus due to vertical transmission. Congenital disease still represents a significant public health problem worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Methods and Materials: A retrospective investigation was performed comprising all pregnant women with HIV and/or syphilis infections admitted at the central hospital cof two Western Cities of Venezuela, during January 2007-September 2010; pregnant women without STDs served as control group. Epidemiological characteristics were reported, anthropometrical variables in newborns were considered. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed on SPSS v.17 ® . Results: 76 pregnant HIV patients and 77 patients with syphilis infection were identified, three of them being coinfected. 87 pregnant women without STD served as controls. Mean age of infected mothers (HIV/syphilis) was 26 years (range 14−42 yrs) with a mean of 3 pregnancies (range 1−12). In the control group, pregnancies of 38±1 weeks were observed; newborns had a mean birth weight of 3,220±524 and a mean height of 51±3cm. In HIV infected patients, mean gestation was 36 weeks (range 26−41 weeks). Mean birth weight of newborns was 2,829±686 g (range 510−3,900 g); 22,6% were low birth weight newborns; mean birth height was 49±4 cm (range 30−56). In syphilis infected patients, mean gestation was 37 weeks (range 22−41 weeks). Mean birth weight of newborns was 3,159±649 g (range 700−4,240 g); 11,5% were low birth weight newborns, mean birth height was 51±4 cm (range 33−59 cm). Maternal VDRL titers were strongly associated with birth weight; higher mother VDRL titers correlated with lower birth weight. Cephalic, thoracic and abdominal circumference did not show considerable differences between groups. Conclusion: STDs cause considerable morbidity in women during the gestational period. Congenital and perinatal infection of the newborn, miscarriage and low birth weight have been described. In this study, both HIV and syphilis infections resulted in lower birth weight, particularly in newborns from HIV infected patients. Treatment of the etiologic agent is considered effective for prevention of vertical transmission and is recommended for STDs. To determine whether oral administration of heat-killed b240 would affect the survival of mice after S. Typhimurium infection, mice were orally administered b240 or saline daily for 3 weeks. S. Typhimurium was orally inoculated and survival of the mice was monitored until 20 days after inoculation. To study the effect of b240 on bacterial translocation of S. Typhimurium, mice were treated orally with b240 or saline daily for 3 weeks. Various organs were removed 6 days after S. Typhimurium inoculation and viable numbers of bacteria were evaluated. We also examined the effects of b240 on adhesion and invasion of S. Typhimurium into HeLa cells by in vitro assay. This cross-sectional, observational study was conducted in Clinical Immunology outpatient clinic, Alzahra University Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, between 2008 and 2010. Cases were 43 women with RPL referred by Obstetric and Gynecology outpatient clinic and controls were randomly selected from healthy age match multiparous women without history of abortion. Inclusion criteria were at least 3 recurrent spontaneous abortions, and no history of any diagnosed underlying diseases as etiology of RP L. Blood samples were obtained from patients and controls to evaluate CMV IgG and IgM antibodies and IgG avidity index by the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay Method (ELISA). Data were analyzed with SPSS version 16.0, using Student's t-test, chi-squared test, and multivariate analyses. Results: One case (2.3%) of positive IgM in each group of RPL's and controls was detected. Also, there were 39 (90.6%) and 30 (69.8%) cases of positive IgG in RPL's and controls, P < 0.05. Patients and controls were similar regarding serum IgM titer (P > 0.05). But, IgG titer was significantly higher in RPL group, P < 0.05. No differences were found between the two groups in IgG avidity index (P > 0.05). In multivariate analyses, only IgG positivity was related to RPL (P < 0.05) and avidity was not related to RPL (P = 0.277). Also, IgG positivity (P = 0.159), IgM positivity (P = 0.856), or avidity index (P = 0.440) were not related to the number of abortions in RPL patients. Conclusions: Previous exposure to CMV detected by a positive IgG antibody is significantly related to RPL in the present study. However, we found no relationship between IgG avidity index and RPL. Whether Latent CMV infection starting an indirect process of autoimmune etiology in RPL's or women with RPL had recurrent or reactivation of CMV infection but avidity index is not the best index to detect it, mostly because of altered immune function to CMV in RPL patients need further investigations. The differences between adherence to seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination after the implementation of a vaccination program between health-care workers were assessed and compared by age, gender, professional category and workplace. Two different prognostic models for predicting adherence to seasonal and pandemic influenza were developed. In statistical analysis, univariate logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors associated with adherence to vaccinations. Multiple regression analysis backwards, stepwise variable selection was used to identify independent risk factors for adherence. The internal validation of the predictive models was evaluated by measures of calibration and discrimination power. Results: 7.6% of professionals were vaccinated against pandemic influenza, and 33.7% against seasonal influenza. Statistically significant differences were observed for both vaccines when comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated professionals as for age, professional category and workplace, while sex differences were only related to pandemic influenza. The predictive model of adherence to pandemic H1N1 vaccine, which showed a good discriminatory power (Area under ROC curve: 0.843), included the variables age, professional category, workplace and previous vaccination against seasonal influenza as independent predicting factors. On the contrary, the predictive model of adherence to seasonal vaccine, which showed a poor discriminatory power (Area under ROC curve: 0.567), included the variables age, gender and workplace. Both models showed a good calibration (table 1) . Conclusions: Adherence to pandemic H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccination program was very low, which suggests the need to implement new strategies into vaccination programs aimed at healthcare professionals. A good model for predicting adherence to pandemic vaccine was developed when compared with the poor discriminating power of the predictive model for seasonal influenza vaccination.
