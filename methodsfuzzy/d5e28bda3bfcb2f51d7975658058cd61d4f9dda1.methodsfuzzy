We are in the process of collecting data from the genetic characterisation of protozoa such as Iodamoeba, Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba hartmanni and Entamoeba polecki-like organisms isolated from clinical samples. Knowing the amount of diversity displayed among clinical isolates of these (and other) parasites will help us generate specific and sensitive primers that can be used in cases where a definitive diagnosis cannot be established on the basis of microscopy. Preliminary results show that the genetic diversity within Entamoeba coli is extensive, and that no less than four genetic subtypes of uninucleate amoebic cysts can be isolated from human faeces. We have also obtained genetic data from protozoan genera that have not been sequenced before. Conclusion: If future platforms for the diagnosis of intestinal protists are to rely on PCR, comprehensive data from molecular characterisation of these organisms are needed to design, evaluate, validate and optimise PCR protocols. A successful four-step synthesis of a new series of 4 -fluoro analogues has been designed and applied to the synthesis of an array of 10 analogues. Malaria parasites were maintained in continuous culture using the method of Jensen and Trager. Antimalarial activity was assessed with an adaption of the 48-h sensitivity assay of Desjardins et al.. using [3H]-hypoxanthine incorporation as an assessment of parasite growth. The fluoroquinolone-resistant S. Typhimurium was obtained in vitro by serial passage of the wild-type strain in increasing concentrations of ciprofloxacin, whereas the reverted strain was obtained from passage of the fluoroquinolone-resistant strain on antibiotic-free media. J774.2 macrophages were seeded at 2×10 5 cells per well and left to adhere for 24 hours. Control wells were fixed with paraformaldehyde. Prior to infection, wells were blocked with BSA for 30 minutes. Bacterial cultures were grown to log phase and then diluted to infect the macrophages with an MOI of 100. A gentamicin protection assay was performed, with viable counts performed at 0, 1, 4 and 24 hours. Results: Fluoroquinolone-resistant S. Typhimurium showed significantly decreased overall survival in comparison to wild-type (median area under the curve (AUC) of 1.49×10 6 versus 1.43×10 5 , statistically significant at the 1% level). In most experiments, there was a log difference in bacterial concentration (cfu ml-1) between the wild-type and resistant strains at all timepoints. There was not a significant difference between the wild-type and reverted strains or between the reverted and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. To determine whether there was a difference in intracellular replication, data were analysed as a percentage of the bacterial concentration at t = 0 (that is, 90 minutes after infection). There was not a statistically significant difference between groups (p = 0.96). Conclusions: Fluoroquinolone-resistant S. Typhimurium showed decreased survival in murine macrophages. Further work is needed to identify the genes responsible for this change, since the mutants were not isogenic. S18 20th ECCMID, Oral presentations O81 Binding and activation of plasminogen on Fusobacterium necrophorum P. Kuusela°, N. Friberg, H. Jarva, P. Mattila, R. Soliymani, M. Baumann (Helsinki, FI) Objective: Many bacteria have plasminogen (Plg) receptors (PlgR) on their surface. Binding to PlgRs enhances activation of the bound Plg to active enzyme plasmin and leads to protection of surface-associated plasmin against physiological plasmin inhibitors. Surface-associated plasmin is thought to play a pathogenetic role in various infections. In this work we have studied Plg binding and activation on Fusobacterium necrophorum (Fnec), an important Gram-negative rod-shaped anaerobe causing Lemierre's syndrome characterized by sepsis and internal jugular vein thrombosis preceded by an oropharyngeal infection. Methods: Plg binding was monitored by incubating bacteria isolated from clinical samples with I125 Plg alone or in various combinations with lysine analog epsilon-amino-caproic acid (EACA), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and alfa2-antiplasmin (alfa2AP), the physiological plasmin inhibitor, followed by counting of the bound radioactivity or by analyzing the bound Plg with SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Plg activation was recorded by following the breakdown of the chromogenic substrate S-2251 in various reagent combinations. Tentative fusobacterial PlgRs were identified by means of ligand blotting of bacterial outer membrane proteins with Plg and by subsequent MALDI-Tof analysis. Results: Fnec (n = 11) bound significantly better iodinated Plg than F. nucleatum (n = 14). Binding was inhibited by EACA and lead to enhanced activation by tPA. Formed plasmin was protected against inhibition by alfa2AP. Additionally, SDS-PAGE analysis of the bound plasmin revealed trimming of the formed Glu-plasmin to a slightly shorter Lys-form of the enzyme. Ligand blotting/MALDI-Tof analyses revealed that acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was a predominant Plg binder among the fusobacterial outer membrane proteins. A human epithelial Hep2 cell line is used to measure cytotoxicity of the Klebsiella product qualitatively and quantitatively via the MTT viability assay. A random miniTn5 transposon mutagenesis created a library of randomly inserted knock out mutants in an AAHC patient isolate of K. oxytoca. The mutant library was screened for loss of cytotoxicity. The transposon insertion sites of toxin negative mutants were identified through isolation of adjacent chromosomal DNA via a plasposon rescue protocol followed by DNA sequencing. Finally, specific deletion mutants of the identified genes were generated and complementation of the cytotoxin negative phenotype was performed. Structure and regulation of cytotoxin production genes and the cytotoxin's chemical nature are under investigation. Cytotoxin positive and -negative K. oxytoca strains will be screened furthermore for distribution of those genes. Results: So far screening the mutant library revealed two toxin negative mutants. The insertion sites cluster in the same region, indicating an operon. Three functionally related putative genes could be identified: a non-ribosomal peptide synthase, a DAHP synthase and a Xaa proline amino peptidase. The genes are involved in the non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis and are not conserved in other Klebsiella species. Conclusion: The clustering of mutations leading to a cytotoxin negative phenotype suggests that the non-ribosomal biosynthesis pathway is essential for cytotoxin production. The substance family known to be synthesized through that pathway in other organisms includes numerous fungal and bacterial effector substances, including antibiotics, cytostatics and siderophores. The genes speA, speB, speC, speF, speH, and ssa were PCRscreened in a total of 724 GAS isolates (160 from invasive infections and 564 from pharyngitis). PCR-negative results for speB and speF were confirmed by Southern blot hybridization with probes specific for each gene. Long-range PCR with primers specific for the regions flanking the putative deletions was performed, and the exact deletion breakpoints were determined by sequencing. Age-and sex-matched C57BL/6 and Lcn2−/− mice were inoculated intranasally with Streptococcus pneumoniae and sacrificed 6 or 48 hours after infection or monitored for survival. Lungs were homogenized and plated on agar plates for bacterial counts and cytokine detection or embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. Results: We observed significantly more KC and IL-6 in the bronchoalveolar lavage of Lcn2−/− mice 6 hours after infection. This resulted in significantly increased neutrophil influx after 6 hours leading to improved bacterial clearance after 48 hours. Consistent with this observation we found decreased cytokine levels and reduced lung inflammation in Lcn2−/− mice at later time-points after infection. Finally, Lcn2KO mice displayed a significant survival advantage over wild type animals. Conclusion: Lcn2 is detrimental during murine pneumococcal pneumonia. We postulate that Lipocalin 2 prevents the early induction of inflammation upon S. pneumoniae infection and thus impairs clearance of bacteria and survival. We organised a network of 106 laboratories capable of isolating C. difficile strains in 34 European countries. In November 2008, 1−7 hospitals per country, depending on population size, tested stool samples of patients aged >2 years who were suspected of CDI, or who had developed diarrhoea after 3 days of hospital admission. CDI was defined by a positive enzyme immunoassay for C. difficile toxin A and/or B, a positive cytotoxicity test, or positive culture of a toxigenic strain. Each hospital collected detailed clinical data of the first 10 CDI cases, and sent stool isolates of C. difficile for PCR-ribotyping and characterization of toxin A, toxin B and binary toxin genes. After 3 months, follow-up clinical data were collected. Results: CDI incidence varied across hospitals (mean: 5.5 per 10,000 patient-days per hospital; range: 0 to 36.3). Detailed information was obtained on 509 patients and 395 isolates of these patients were available for characterization. Sixty-two different PCR ribotypes were found, among which 014 (15%), 001 (10%) and 078 (8%) were most prevalent. The prevalence of PCR ribotype 027 was 5%. Most patients had the previously identified risk profile of an elderly patient with co-morbidity and recent antibiotic use. At follow-up, 22% of patients had died and in 40% of these deaths CDI played a role. In multivariate analysis, age 65 yrs, use of macrolides and infection by PCR ribotypes 015, 018 and 056 were significantly associated with death to which CDI contributed. Ceftazidime use and having recurrent CDI at inclusion were significantly associated with recurrences during follow-up. Conclusion: In this pan-European, hospital-based study, the incidence of healthcare-associated CDI varied widely between hospitals. The overall and attributable mortality were high. Dominant PCR ribotypes were 014, 001 and 078, whereas 015, 018 and 056 were associated with a complicated disease course. These data emphasise the importance of multi-country surveillance and indeed that PCR ribotypes other than 027 are prevalent causes of CDI in Europe. In AC, 1,045 CDI-patients were reported; CDI incidence was 2.18 cases per 10,000 pd (1.05 case per 1,000 admissions). By origin, 686 (66%) cases were healthcare-associated (HA), 598 (87%) of which were acquired in the reporting HCF; 294 (28%) community-associated (CA); 65 (6%) of unknown origin (UO). Among 734 CDI-patients diagnosed in HCF actively following them up for a month, 100 (14%) were severe cases and 25 (3%) died from their CDI. In RLTC, 251 CDI-patients were reported; CDI incidence was 1.31 cases per 10,000 pd. By origin, 231 (92%) cases were HA, 204 (88%) of which were acquired in the reporting HCF; 8 (3%) CA; 12 (5%) of UO. Among 186 CDI-patients diagnosed in HCF actively following them up for a month, 4 (2%) were severe cases and died from their CDI. Last, 237 C. difficile strains were sent by 54 HCF to the NRC; their characterisation and typing are underway. Conclusions: Preliminary results from this survey confirm that CDI incidence in France is much lower than reported in other European countries, and suggest that CDI are adequately controlled in French HCF. However, the high proportion of CA cases reported in AC wards suggests the need for further studies. Final results from this survey will be presented in April. The cross-sectional study was performed in February-March, 2008, in 150 retail outlets randomly sampled in 3 provinces of North-Eastern Italy. Among those 3 provinces retailer's sample size was proportional to resident population. In each sampled retailer one laboratory sample of minced beef and one of pork was randomly collected. Each sample was microbiologically processed using the Clostridium difficile selective medium Cefoxitine Cycloserine Fructose broth (added with Taurocolate). After 10 days of incubation broth cultures were plated on blood agar base, horse blood red cells added (5% v/v), and tested by PCR for detection of Clostridium difficile DNA according to Penders (2005) . The presence of toxins A and B in the broth culture was evaluated by Techlab C.diff quik chek complete kit (Techlab). A positive control (meat experimentally infected with Clostridium difficile spores) was carried out simultaneously with each batch of the experimental samples. The current read-out of MLPA is done by capillary electrophoresis, a method that is expensive and time-consuming and therefore difficult to implement and sustain in low-income countries. Recent developments in biotechnology have raised the opportunity to transfer the assay to a liquid array. Current MLPA-probes were modified to be compatible with such a system. To cover the increasing prevalence of MDR-and XDR-TB isolates, targets revealing resistance to several important second-line drugs (e.g. fluoroquinolones) were included in the MLPA assay, as well as additional genotypic markers. Using an ex vivo model based on human peripheral blood cells the conditions and cofactors required for the recognition of delta lgt-LTA by innate immune cells were investigated. The patients have been separated in two groups: first group, where the diagnosis of TB meningitis has been confirmed by positive culture from CSF and efficacy of treatment; second group with non-TB meningitis. We performed QuantiFERON-TB Gold in Tube (QFT-G) in blood and CSF at all patients. Results: From a total of 46 children enrolled, 21 cases has been diagnosed with TB meningitis and 25 patient was in the control group; B:F = 18:10; mean of age was 9.75 (age range 6 months to 17 years). The symptoms and physical examination at the admission may suggest TB meningitis: fever, headache, vomiting and neck stiffness at 17 patients, cranial nerve palsies at 2 patients, hemi paresis at 3, altered mental status at 13 and seizures at 6 subjects. TST was positive at 13 patients in the first group and at 6 in the second. The CSF analyses were suggestive for TB at 16 patients: pleocytosis 300 elements/ml, high CSF protein level and low CSF glucose. All patients had negative smear and only 7 (33.3%) had positive culture. The mean time interval required for QFT-G results was 48 hours and for cultures was 25.6 days. In the first group, the results of QFT-G in blood samples were: 15 (71.4%) subjects had QFT-G positive, 5 (23.8%) had QFT-G negative and one indeterminate (4.7%). In CSF, 16 (76.2%) patients had positive results, 3 (14.3%) had negative and 2 (9.5%) indeterminate. In group of non TB meningitis, 23 (92%) patients had negative results in blood and 2 (8%) positive; in CSF, 19 (76%) subjects had negative results and 6 (24%) indeterminate. The sensitivity of QFT-G in CSF was 84.2% and 75% in blood; specificity 100% in CSF and 92% in blood; the positive predictive value of QFT-G was 100% in CSF and 88.2% in blood; negative predictive value was 86.3% in CSF and 82.1% in blood. The sensitivity of TST was 61.9% and specificity 76%. The sensitivity of the culture from CSF was only 33.3%. The sensitivity and specificity of QFT-G was higher than TST and culture and better in CSF than in blood. The virulence study included a) 8 multi-azole resistant AF clinical isolates with different mutations in the CYP51A gene (3 strains with TR/L98H, 1 each with M220I, M220V, M220K, G54W, G138C) b) 3 wild-type azole susceptible (WT) strains as reference and c) 2 isogenic isolates with no CYP51A mutations (1 susceptible and 1 resistant strain) which were serially recovered from a single patient pre-and post-antifungal treatment. Microsatellite-typing method and CSP-method were performed to verify the genetic relationship of the 2 isolates. Susceptibility testing was performed based on the CLSI-M38A method. RT-PCR was performed to determine the CYP51A expression. In vitro growth rates were determined using a previously -Ollivier AAC 2008, 52:3092) , were analyzed by sequencing the hotspot regions of the FKS genes. Initial isolates were also analyzed when available and serial isolates were genotyped using polymorphic microsatellite markers. All medical charts of patients harbouring such isolates were reviewed. Results: For the 14 episodes involving isolates with reduced susceptibility to caspofungin, patients (sex ratio M:F = 10:4, mean age: 44y) were diagnosed with candidemia (n = 8), other invasive infections (n = 4) and oropharyngeal candidiasis (n = 2). Underlying diseases were hematological malignancies (n = 6), solid organ transplant (n = 2), HIV infection (n = 1), and other conditions (n = 5). Candida species were 7 C. albicans, 6 C. glabrata, and 1 C. krusei. All 14 isolates have been recovered after the patient was treated with caspofungin for a duration ranging from 10 days to several months. All had mutation in FKS genes. Among 10 patients for whom a previous isolate was available, paired isolates shared identical genotypes. Furthermore, for each pair, the isolate recovered before caspofungin treatment had higher susceptibility (MIC < 0.25 mg/ml) to caspofungin than the second ones, and had wild-type FKS genes. Conclusions: Caspofungin resistance in Candida spp. was always associated with prior exposure to the drug in severely ill patients. Further analysis should uncover if other factors such as treatment's duration influence its occurrence. Invasive infections due to various species of Candida spp. with acquired reduced susceptibility to caspofungin deserve attention. O347 Innovative multiplex diagnostics for Candida spp. using MLPA G. Dingemans°, R. Boesten, C. Klaassen, M. Reijans, J. Meis, T. Boekhout, G. Simons (Maastricht, Utrecht, Nijmegen, NL) Objective: Candida yeasts are the fourth most common source of nosocomial bloodstream infections. Especially during the last decade, the prevalence of opportunistic Candida infections has increased and has become a serious threat to high risk patients. To date, most molecular diagnostic tools are based on ribosomal regions. Although broadly applied, these target genes have difficulties discriminating closely related species, causing misidentification and underestimation of polymicrobial infections. This results in an urgent need of high discriminatory and accurate detection methods for clinical purposes using novel probes. The aim of this project is to improve molecular diagnostics of yeastrelated infections. Methods: A novel DNA based diagnostic system using Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) technology serves as our platform for molecular diagnostics using newly developed diagnostic probes. A Candida-MLPA assay containing probes for C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, and C. lusitaniae has been developed. Results: The specificity of the assay was validated on 50 Candida/non-Candida spp. from CBS Fungal Biodiversity Centre. In addition, 95 clinical isolates were screened with the MLPA assay and the results were compared with AFLP profiles. In case of any discordance the identity of the strain was established by sequencing the ITS region. Furthermore, the total screening encompassed phylogenetically related species, including 31 Candida spp., 4 Pichia spp. and S. cerevisiae. The Candida-MLPA assay showed a 100% concordance with the ITS sequences. The analytical sensitivity of the Candida-MLPA assay was established on 100 fg gDNA, which represents less than two yeast cells. Conclusions: We demonstrated that an assay based upon the MLPA technology was able to identify 8 Candida spp. in one reaction. Multiple infections, up to 7 species in one sample, could be identified. Due to the nature of the MLPA technology highly complex assays are possible providing room for additional probes like a generic Candida probe or probes for other emerging species. The specificity and sensitivity of this multiparameter assay shows great potential for a fast and comprehensive screening approach for clinically relevant Candida spp. in a diagnostic setting. Hospital and St. Louis Children's Hospital were identified based on morphological and/or biochemical characteristics. DNA was extracted from the fungi using the BD GeneOhm kit with a 5 min lysis followed by heating at 95 C for 15 min. The ITS1−5.8s rRNA-ITS2 region from 133 isolates was amplified and PCR products were bi-directionally sequenced on an ABI 3130. Trimmed sequences were then aligned with sequences in the NCBI nr/nt database using BLAST. Filamentous fungi and yeast from 33 genera and 55 species were included in the study. Results: For 64 of the 133 isolates sequenced, the morphological identification matched the sequence based identification. Morphologic and sequence based identification were disparate in 38 cases. For 31 of the isolates, the sequence-based identification was equivocal; that is, the morphologic identification was found in the top ten "hits" in the sequence database, but the morphologic identification was not the first choice or there were other choices that were equal probability matches. Sequence identification performed well for most yeast species, and for some filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus, Scedosporium and Fusarium spp. Sequence identification was not as accurate for identification of dermatophytes, Zygomycetes, and dematiaceous moulds. Conclusions: Use of the NCBI sequence database for identification of clinical isolates of fungi may result in incorrect identification and administration of appropriate antifungal therapy. Once our data have been compiled into a database of fungal sequences, we will conduct challenge experiments for the identification of clinical isolates. The inhibitory effect of 14 mercapto-phosphonate derivatives against representatives of the three subclasses of MBLs (VIM-4 (B1), CphA (B2) and L1 (B3)) was previously reported [1] . Here, in order to determine the interactions mediating the positioning of the inhibitors in the active site of each enzyme, crystallographic and docking studies were performed with 10a and 18, both inhibitors being active against the three subclasses. The antimicrobial activity of BAL30072 was tested against 39 strains (20 wild type and 19 ESBL-producers). MICs were determined using agar dilution on Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 2, 2' bipyridyl to induce iron transport. In vivo efficacy was evaluated against a CTX-M-15-like-producing E. coli strain using a lethal peritonitis sepsis model in neutropenic ICR mice. Survival was monitored for seven days after infection. E. coli inocula ranged from 2.5×10 6 to 5.0×10 6 cfu/mouse (2−5 X LD50) and BAL30072 was administered intraperitoneally 3 times daily for 3 days (doses of 100 mg/kg down to 12.5 mg/kg) following infection. Saline was administered to the untreated control group and meropenem was administered to the treated control group. Results: MIC50/MIC90 of BAL30072 for wild type, and ESBLproducing E. coli were 0.125/0.5, and <0.0625/1 mg/L, respectively (ranges <0.0625−1 and <0.0625-256 mg/L, respectively). The MIC of BAL30072 against the ESBL-E. coli used in the mouse model was <0.0625 mg/L. In vivo experiments in mice infected intraperitoneally with various E. coli inocula showed that, at doses from 100 mg/kg down to 12.5 mg/kg, BAL30072 conferred protection similar to meropenem (90-100% survival). Survival in the placebo group was 0−33%. Conclusion: BAL30072 is an effective antibacterial agent against clinical isolates of E. coli, including ESBL-producing strains. It is highly effective treatment against infection caused by ESBL-producing E. coli as demonstrated in mice peritonitis-sepsis model. Objectives: ACHN-490 is a novel sisomicin derivative stable to nearly all aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. We compared its activity with that of other aminoglycosides vs. clinical Enterobacteriaceae representing the diversity of carbapenem resistance types now emerging in the UK. Most were multiresistant. Methods: The 81 isolates comprised those with the Class A carbapenemases KPC (n = 10) or SME-1 (1); Class B enzymes, IMP (13), VIM (5) and NDM (17) and the Class D enzyme, or with combinations of impermeability plus an AmpC or ESBL (16). They included 52 Klebsiella spp., 18 Enterobacter spp., 6 E. coli and 5 others. Carbapenemase genes were identified by PCR and sequencing as were those encoding the 16S rRNA methylases ArmA and RmtA-C. MICs were measured by CLSI agar dilution. S389 From case reports to causality: how can we quantify rare adverse events, how should they be considered in the treatment decisions? In the 2008 database of the national antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (ISIS-AR) each pt with a positive culture with either Escherichia coli (EC) or Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) (intermediate) resistant (I/R) to third generation cephalosporines (CEPH) and at least one follow up culture with an EC or KP were identified. For each pt the time period was determined between the first ESBL positive and first negative culture. The primary end point was July 31st, 2009. The duration of colonisation was estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, in which all pts without a last negative culture were censored. Figure. Days to 3rd gen. cephalosporin susceptible isolate. The TDC of fourteen high touch objects was evaluated using a fluorescent dye based targeting method in two hospital systems consisting of 12 hospitals (Group A) and 7 hospitals (Group B) administratively related within each group but geographically and functionally independent institutions. A three phase intervention was utilized as previously described (ICHE 2008; 29: 1035−41) . TDC scores were provided to the environmental services administration at each hospital and on a regular basis as part of system-wide quality assurance reviews for each system. At each meeting TDC scores were reviewed and the most effective programmatic and educational interventions shared. Results: As noted in the Figure, and 2,132 patients in G2. Among all the treated patients, G2 received less AM combination (G1: 33%; G2: 24%) and parenteral AM (G1: 65%; G2: 57%). The top three AM classes prescribed were similar in both groups and corresponded to combinations of penicillins with b-lactamase inhibitors (G1: 18%; G2: 24%), fluoroquinolones (G1: 12%; G2: 14%) and third-generation cephalosporins (6% for both groups). Infections represented 74% and 83% of all indications in G1 and G2, respectively. Respiratory tract infections were the commonest infections in both groups (G1: 29%; G2: 33%) followed by skin-soft-tissues-and-bonejoint infections in G1 (18%) and urinary tract infections in G2 (23%). The proportion of surgical prophylaxis was lower in the oldest patients (G1: 69%; G2: 66%). The >1 day duration of surgical prophylaxis was 54% in both groups. The prescribed doses for 5 parenteral AM, i.e. benzylpenicillin, gentamicin, cefuroxime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin were higher in G1 whilst amoxycillin and cefazolin were higher in G2. The original data presented in 'unit dose' is obtained from the Hospital's information database called the Diver Solution TM , which can interface with Microsoft ® Excel 2007. The aggregate in-hospital consumption data that includes both issues from and returns to pharmacy from 2005 to 2008 were collected. The ABC Calc. (version 3.1, 2006) was adapted in an Excel worksheet to create the antimicrobial consumption database, converting consumption data from 'unit-dose' to DDD/100 bed-days. Monte Carlo simulations with a 2-compartment model were performed in Berkeley Madonna to simulate plasma and tissue concentrations of 1000 patients for intravenous moxifloxacin as an example drug. Simulation scenario A assumed that the tissue concentration is proportional to the concentration in the peripheral compartment. For scenario B, rate and extent of tissue penetration were estimated and tissue volume fixed to a small value. Population optimal sampling times were determined in WinPOPT (V1.2). For 12 sampling schedules, 100 datasets of 48 patients were drawn randomly and analyzed by the MC-PEM algorithm in S-ADAPT V1.56 using the true model (2400 population PK analyses in total). Bias and precision of mean population PK parameters and variances representing BSV were calculated. Results: Except for designs that sampled both plasma and tissue at the same time in all patients, in scenario A bias was <8% and precision <19% for population means and bias was generally <25% and precision <30% for BSV for all PK parameters. For scenario B and designs with 5 optimized plasma sampling times and one tissue sample per patient: (1) Designs with all tissue samples at the same time showed bias up to 48% for extent of tissue penetration and up to 78% for rate of tissue penetration. (2) A design with random tissue sampling times had bias <7% and precision <21% for all population means. (3) A design with four groups (each: n = 12) of patients each sampled at one optimized tissue sampling time achieved bias <3% and precision <13% for all population means and bias <18% and precision <33% for all BSV estimates. Conclusions: Tissue samples should be obtained at multiple optimized time points to determine the rate and extent of penetration, even if only one tissue sample per patient can be obtained. Designs with serial plasma samples at population optimal times were beneficial. Designs with one plasma and one tissue sample per patient all at the same time performed poorly and benefitted from a full Bayesian approach for PK analysis. T. Maier, V. Böttcher, M. Kostrzewa°(Bremen, DE) Objectives: MALDI-TOF fingerprint analysis became a valuable tool for microorganism identification and classification, recently. While for bacteria and yeasts simple and robust approaches for sample preparation have been reported, leading to reproducible results with low impact of cultivation conditions and growth state, the situation for filamentous fungi keeps more complicated. In particular, sample preparation of molds with rigid cell walls is more challenging and the fingerprint spectra derived from spores and mycel show significant differences. Also fingerprint spectra seem to be dependent on cultivation media. We present a novel approach for sample preparation of fungi prior to MALDI-TOF MS improving reproducibility and quality of spectra, significantly. Methods: Fungal species (e.g. Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp.) harvested from solid media were grown over night in liquid medium. Subsequently, cell material was harvested by centrifugation, and washed with water. The pellet was dried well and extracted using 35% formic acid/50% acetonitrile. 1ml of the extract was spotted onto a MALDI target, dried on air, and overlaid with HCCA matrix. Mass spectra were acquired in the linear mode, mass range 2000 to 20000 Da, using a microflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen). Spectra were analysed using the flexAnalysis software, reference libraries were created and bioinformatic analyses were performed with the MALDI Biotyper 2.0 software (Bruker Daltonik). Results: Culture in liquid medium has lead to mycelia without spores and thereby largely homogenous cell material. These samples facilitated a successful protein extraction by a simple, short standardised method. Mass spectra generated based on the novel sample preparation method were reproducible and contained many characteristic peaks, thereby leading to a significantly improved identification security. Further, the higher quality of spectra increased the differentiation power of the method and could highlight subspecies differences. A core database of 50 filamentous species has been established and used for first comparative studies. Technical and biological replicates could be identified successfully as well as isolates not included in the database. Reproducibility of results obtained with different mass spectrometers could be demonstrated. In a prospective, observational study in 22 Dutch hospitals, patients ( 18years) admitted to the ER with a clinically suspected CAP were included between January 2008 and March 2009. Recent hospitalization (<2 wks), stay in long-term care facilities, known bronchial obstruction or a history of post-obstructive pneumonia, primary or metastatic lung cancer, AIDS/ PCP/ TBC and unconsciousness were exclusion criteria. History taking, physical examination, biochemical and hematological blood testing, blood-and sputum cultures and BINAX pneumococcal urinary antigen testing were performed in all patients. All pneumococcal bacteremia isolates were serotyped (at the Netherlands Reference Laboratory Amsterdam). Pneumococcal CAP was defined on the presence of clinical criteria for CAP, radiographic confirmation by a radiologist and isolation of S. pneumoniae from blood or sputum (if dominant flora) or positive antigen testing in urine. Results: Of 1631 included patients, 1115 had radiographically confirmed CAP and 210 (18.8%) had pneumococcal CAP, diagnosed on isolation of S. pneumoniae from blood culture (n = 82, 7.3% of all bloodcultures), sputum culture (n = 24), or positive urinary antigen test (n = 151). 75 bacteremia isolates were serotyped. Serotypes 14 (n = 9), 1, 7F, 19A and 22F (n = 8) were most common. Potential vaccine coverage was 28% for the 7-valent, 67% for the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and 93% for 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PS). Conclusion: Based on bacteremia isolates vaccine coverage would be 67% with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that is currently investigated in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in the Netherlands. O571 Serotype-specific mortality risk among patients with invasive pneumococcal disease: Swedish population-based study P. Naucler°, J. Darenberg,Å.Örtqvist, B. Henriques Normark (Stockholm, SE) Objectives: To investigate pneumococcal serotype-specific mortality risk correlated to the serotype invasive disease potential among patients with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Methods: In Sweden it is mandatory to report IPD and isolates are collected for serotyping and molecular typing. Of 4195 episodes of IPD among adults reported between Jan 2007 to Oct 2009 a total of 3692 isolates were serotyped (88%). A questionnaire study was performed to obtain clinical and socio-demographic information about patients with serotyped IPD [obtained for 1657/3692 patients (45%)]. In a preliminary analysis of the 1657 patients we assessed the absolute serotype-specific 30-day mortality risks and relative risks using regression modeling on group level according to previously defined invasive disease potential [high (serotypes 1 and 7), medium (serotypes 4, 9, 14 and 18) and low (serotypes 3, 6A, 6B, 8, 15, 19, 33 and 38) and for individual serotypes. Risk estimates were adjusted for potential confounders. Results: Pneumococcal serotype prevalence ranged from 0.05% for serotype 5 to 13.4% for serotype 14 and was stable over the observed period. Absolute mortality risk was highest for serotypes with low invasive disease potential (12.8%) followed by serotypes with medium-(8.6%) and high (4.9%) invasive disease potential. Serotypes with low invasive disease potential were associated with increased mortality risk in unadjusted but not adjusted analyses [relative risks 2.62 (95% CI 1.38-5.00) and 1.61 (95% CI 0.84-3.09) respectively] and a test for trend according to invasive disease potential was significant in unadjusted (p-value: 0.001) but not adjusted (p-value: 0.10) analyses. Patients infected with serotypes of lower invasive disease potential were older, more likely to be diagnosed with meningitis, suffer from chronic disease and immunosuppression (all p-values <0.003). Serotype 3, 6B, 11A, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F were associated with increased mortality risk in crude analyses but only serotype 6B and 11A were associated with increased mortality risk in adjusted analyses.
