Apart from the determinants that affect New Zealand's inbound tourism discussed above, this section reviews recent developments in tourism forecasting methodology that could be applied for forecasting New Zealand's visitor arrivals in this study. In relation to tourism demand modelling, numerous studies (e.g. Goh and Law, 2011; Lim, 1997; Peng et al., 2014; Song and Li, 2008; Witt and Witt, 1995) have offered structured reviews of the forecasting methodologies used to forecast tourism demand. In particular, Song and Li (2008) reviewed the most popular times series and econometric models (e.g. the simple na√Øve models, ARIMA-based methods, GARCH-based models and the vector error correction model -(VECM)) as well as a number of new quantitative and qualitative techniques (e.g. the almost ideal demand system (AIDS), artificial intelligence (AI) methods and artificial neural networks (ANN)) for tourism forecasting. They suggested that there is no single forecasting model that can consistently outperform other forecasting models in all situations. Similarly, Peng et al. (2014) also mentioned that no agreement has been reached regarding the superiority and advantages of different forecasting models. However, the ARMA-based models are still widely used to forecast tourism demand. For example, Chu (2009) used three different ARMAbased models to forecast worldwide visitors to nine countries (Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines). Baldigara and Mamula (2015) also used the Box-Jenkins SARIMAX model to forecast German tourism demand in Croatia and identified the determinants affecting the number of tourist arrivals. In addition, Tsui and Balli (2015) used the Box-Jenkins SARIMAX model to forecast and predict air passenger throughput for Hong Kong International Airport. Recently, Alsumair and Tsui (2017) also used the Box-Jenkins SARIMAX models to model and forecast the international inbound tourism of Saudi Arabia. It should be noted that the Box-Jenkins SARIMAX models used in these studies are significantly accurate for forecasting tourism demands. Furthermore, the volatility models in the finance literature have been adapted and applied to estimate tourist numbers for several countries in tourism studies (e.g. Chan et al., 2005 , Chang et al., 2011a , 2011b Coshall, 2009; Hoti et al., 2007; Kim and Wong, 2006; Divino and McAleer, 2010) . Note that the GARCH methodology was developed for investigating and modelling time-varying volatility in financial time series data and stock returns (e.g. Balli et al., 2013; Bollerslev, 1986; Engle et al., 1990; Poon and Granger, 2003) . However, Chang et al. (2011b) mentioned that the analysis of tourism volatility is still a relatively new approach within tourism research and literature. Importantly, the GARCH methodology has been applied for modelling volatility because tourism demands, just like macroeconomic indicators, exhibit varying degrees of volatility and heteroskedastic behaviour Shareef and McAleer, 2007; Song and Li, 2008) .
