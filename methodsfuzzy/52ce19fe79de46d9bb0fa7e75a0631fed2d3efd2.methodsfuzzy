For similarity analysis of isolates, the following procedure has been applied consisting of two steps: 1. identification of structurally identical parts of isolates, i.e., insertion and deletion sites 2. identification of SNPs in structurally identical parts. Step 1 has been carried out by a function performing similarity analysis of subsequences of a given length (e.g., 100 bps), and identifying significantly non-matching strings as being inserted in the corresponding sequence (i.e. deleted from the other). Since significant number of isolates have the same length (29727 bases) and starting and ending subsequences (that seem to be the exact starts and ends of the complete SARS-CoV genome up to the poly-"a" at the 3' end), they may be considered as forming a representative group. The nucleotide structure of all other isolates was analyzed with respect to this representative group. For each pair of isolates (x,y) (x from the representative group), a file InsDelx-y has been produced containing positions and lengths of each of the insertions or deletions in the isolate y. Step 2 has been carried out by comparing structurally identical parts (of the same length) of pairs of isolates. The starting and ending positions of those parts have been taken from the file InsDelx-y (for comparison of x and y), produced in step 1. The procedure returns results in a file with SNPs in the two sequences (files Mismx-y). We also used the CLUSTALW program [10] for multialignment as a control process, as well as for phylogenetic investigations. In order to use similarity analysis results for drawing any phylogenetic conclusions about the SARS-CoV genome dataset, a CLUSTALW [10] multialigned output has been generated and a bootstrapped phylogenetic tree has been produced and drawn using the PhyloDraw program [15] .
