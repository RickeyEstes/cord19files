Viruses. For the present work, we employed the same JEV strains as in our previously published in vivo studies (8, 9, 12) : JEV Laos, belonging to genotype 1 (CNS769_Laos_2009; GenBank accession number KC196115.1 [67] ; kindly provided by R. Charrel, Aix-Marseille Université, France), and JEV Nakayama, genotype 3 (National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses, Salisbury, UK). JEV was propagated in Vero cells (ATCC CCL81) in G-MEM BHK-21 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biowest, Nuaillé, France) and cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Viral titers were determined in Vero cells using the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) with the anti-flavivirus E antibody 4G2 (ATCC HB-112). Titers were calculated and expressed as 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) per milliliter. JEV infection of porcine nasal mucosa explants. Nasal mucosa explants were isolated from four 3-month-old pigs at a local slaughterhouse. The nasal cavity was opened in the longitudinal axes, and nasal mucosa was removed in strips (3 by 8 cm). After the tissues were rinsed with minimum essential medium (MEM; Thermo Fisher) supplemented with antibiotics (100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 g/ml of streptomycin, 0.25 g/ml of amphotericin B, and 50 g/ml of gentamicin; Sigma-Aldrich), they were placed onto sterile surgical compresses sodden with fresh MEM and kept on ice. Surgical compresses were cut in squares of 1.2 cm, placed in 12-well plates, and filled until the top of the compress surface with bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM [68] ), supplemented with antibiotics (see above). Next, the nasal mucosa tissues were cut in 1-cm squares and placed onto the compresses in 12-well plates and refilled with medium, keeping the apical side of the tissue at the ALI. After incubation overnight at 37°C in 5% CO 2 , mucus was washed away with BEGM, and mucosa pieces were transferred to new empty 12-well plates without compresses. There tissues were challenged with JEV at 10 5 TCID 50 s/ml in 400 l, incubated for 1.5 h at 37°C, and washed 3 times with BEGM. In order to establish again the ALI conditions, mucosa was transferred onto new freshly prepared 12-well plates with compresses and fresh BEGM with antibiotics. After 2, 24, and 48 hpi one piece of tissue per condition and animal was processed for RNA extraction. At 72 hpi, additional tissues were embedded and cryopreserved in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT; Leica Microsystems). Using a cryostat, nasal mucosa sections at a thickness of 4 m were cut and then fixed with acetone-methanol (1:1). Generation of porcine NEC. NEC were generated as previously described (68), with improvements. Briefly, nasal epithelial tissues were harvested from pigs at a local slaughterhouse, and tissues were transported on ice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) lacking Na 2 Ϫ and Ca 2 Ϫ (PBS Ϫ/Ϫ ; supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin; Sigma). After washing and removal of fat and connective tissue, the epithelium was treated with 0.1% protease (mass/volume [m/v]; from Streptomyces griseus type XIV; Sigma) and desoxyribonuclease I (0.001% m/v; from bovine pancreas; Sigma) for release of epithelial cells. After 48 h the cells were harvested by gently scratching the apical surface and washed twice with PBS Ϫ/Ϫ . Between the washing steps, the cells were passed through a 100-m cell strainer (Becton, Dickinson). Then 2 ϫ 10 6 cells were seeded in T75 tissue culture flasks coated with collagen types I and III (VitroCol; Sigma), in 25 ml of bronchial epithelial cell serum-free growth medium (BEGM; LHC basal medium supplemented; Thermo Fisher) supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF, 25 ng/ml; Thermo Fisher) and retinoic acid (50 nM; Sigma) and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . The medium was changed after 24 h and then every 2 to 3 days until confluence was reached. Cells were detached using trypsin (Sigma) and frozen in liquid nitrogen with 40% FBS and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Glutamax and without phenol red (DMEM; Gibco, Thermo Fisher) at 2.5 ϫ 10 6 cells per tube. For ALI cultures, 12-well inserts with a pore size of 0.4 m (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were coated with collagen type IV (Sigma), and 2 ϫ 10 5 cells per insert were seeded in 500 l of BEGM (EGF, 25 ng/ml; Thermo Fisher) and 1 ml in the lower chamber, and cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . After 24 h, the insert medium was replaced, and then the medium in both chambers was changed every 2 to 3 days. After reaching confluence, the cells were shifted to ALI by removing the medium in the upper chamber, and in the basal chamber BEGM was replaced with ALI medium (1:1 [vol/vol] LHC basal medium plus DMEM, supplemented as BEGM with 1 ng/ml of EGF; Thermo Fisher). Experiments were performed as soon as movement of cilia was visible, indicating full differentiation of cultures. Flavivirus infection of porcine NEC. NEC were apically challenged with an MOI of 0.1 TCID 50 /cell for 1.5 h at 37°C. Then the virus inoculum was discarded, the NEC apical surface washed three times with prewarmed PBS Ϫ/Ϫ , and the inserts were transferred into new plates with fresh ALI medium in the basolateral chamber for culture at 37°C and 5% CO 2. Mock infection controls were included. After 24, 48, and 72 hpi, apical washes and basolateral medium were collected and stored at Ϫ70°C for later titrations. RNA was extracted from NEC at each indicated time postinfection. An extra insert was kept for 72 hpi to fix in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for immunolabeling. RNA extraction and RT-qPCR. RNA was extracted using NucleoSpin RNA II filtered columns (Macherey-Nagel). cDNA was generated with the Omniscript reverse transcription (RT) kit (Qiagen) using random hexamers (Thermo Fisher). RT-quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using TaqMan Fast Universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The primer and probe sequences used in this work are listed in Table 1 . Fold change of gene expression was calculated using the threshold cycle (2 ϪΔΔCT ) method (69) , and the 18S housekeeping gene was used for normalization. Relative gene expression results are presented on a base 2 logarithmic scale. Cytokine measurements. Basolateral supernatants of NEC harvested at 24, 48, and 72 hpi were used for determination of porcine IL-1␤, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). Porcine macrophages preparation and infection. MDM were generated from monocytes as previously described (70) . To this end, blood from 6-to 24-month-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Swiss Large White pigs from our own breeding facilities was taken, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using density centrifugation (1.077 g/liter; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Then monocytes were isolated by magnetic cell sorting with an LS column (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) as CD172a ϩ cells using monoclonal antibody (MAb) clone 74-22-15 (ATCC). Sorted monocytes were seeded at 5 ϫ 10 5 /ml in DMEM-10% FBS and porcine macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; 20 U/ml, produced in-house [70, 71] ) and cultured for 3 days at 39°C and 5% CO 2 . After MDM differentiation, medium was replaced with fresh MDM (for nonpolarized MDM) or with medium supplemented with IL-4 (100 U/ml, produced in-house; for IL-4-polarized MDM) (72, 73) and incubated for another 24 h. To investigate the ability of JEV released to the basolateral side of porcine NEC to infect MDM, the cells were incubated with 200 l of the basolateral medium collected at 72 hpi from JEV-infected NEC. As controls, MDM were challenged with JEV from our virus stocks at an MOI adapted to that of the basolateral NEC medium. To determine if epithelial alarmins influence JEV infection (Laos; MOI, 1 TCID 50 /cell) of MDM, recombinant human IL-25, IL-33, TSLP (Thermo Fisher), or any possible combination thereof was added at 10 ng/ml each, with the virus inoculum and removed at the same time after incubation. For MDM infection, the cells were incubated 1.5 h at 37°C and 5% CO 2 with the virus, washed three times with PBS Ϫ/Ϫ , and incubated at 39°C and 5% CO 2 for 24 h in fresh DMEM-2% FBS. The MDM were harvested as cell suspensions, immunolabeled with the anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2, and acquired on a FACSCantoII (Becton, Dickinson). Dead cells were excluded by electronic gating in forward/side scatter plots, followed by exclusion of doublets using Flowjo V.9.1 software (Treestar, Ashland, OR). Ethics statement.

First, 600 l per well of basolateral supernatants from JEV-infected porcine NEC were harvested at 72 hpi and dispensed into 24-well plates. Next, 10 6 monocytes were added into Transwell inserts with 3-m-diameter pores (Becton, Dickinson) and placed in the wells filled with the porcine NEC culture-derived basolateral medium. After 3 h of incubation at 39°C and 5% CO 2 , basolateral medium was harvested and total monocytes were harvested and quantified. Monocyte phenotype was verified by immunolabeling with anti-porcine CD14 (MIL2; Bio-Rad). Controls included ALI medium, medium collected from mock-treated porcine NEC, and porcine CCL2 (200 pg/ml in ALI medium; Kingfisher Biotech, St. Paul, MN). For monocyte quantification by flow cytometry, CountBright absolute counting beads (Thermo Fisher) were used following the manufacturer's manual. Dead cells were excluded by electronic gating in forward/side scatter plots, followed by exclusion of doublets. Confocal microscopy imaging. Porcine nasal mucosa tissue slices 4 m thick were washed in confocal buffer (CB; 50 nM ammonium chloride and 0.1% saponin in PBS Ϫ/Ϫ ) for 30 min and then incubated with anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 for 2 h. After 3 washes with CB, the tissue was incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-IgG2a (Thermo Fisher), and Cy3-conjugated anti-␤tubulin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used for the detection of cilia. Porcine NEC cultured on the Transwell membranes were washed with PBS Ϫ/Ϫ and incubated in 4% PFA for 15 min. In the second step, the membranes were incubated in CB for 30 min. Cells were incubated with anti-ZO-1 (Thermo Fisher) and anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 for 2 h, followed by Alexa Fluor 633-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher), Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-IgG2a (Thermo Fisher), and Cy3-conjugated anti-␤-tubulin (Abcam). For evaluation of cell death in porcine NEC, Abcam's Fixable Cell Viability Assay Kit (Fluorometric-Blue)-CytoPainter was applied for 30 min, and then cells were washed with PBS Ϫ/Ϫ and fixed with 4% PFA, followed by an incubation with anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 as described before and labeling with phalloidin conjugated with AF555 (Thermo Fisher) and Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-IgG2a (Thermo Fisher) for 1 h. As a positive control for cleaved caspase 3 (C-Cas3) staining, apoptosis in porcine NEC was induced by incubation with anti-human CD90 (5E10; Becton, Dickinson). For detection of apoptotic cells, inserts were fixed with 4% PFA and incubated in CB for 30 min, incubated with anti-C-Cas3 (Cell Signaling Technologies), anti-flavivirus E protein antibody 4G2 for 2 h, washed, and labeled with phalloidin conjugated with AF647, Alexa Fluor 633-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-IgG2a (Thermo Fisher) for 1 h. All incubations were performed at room temperature in the dark. For each staining, 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Sigma) at 2 g/ml was applied for 5 min at 37°C and washed off with PBS Ϫ/Ϫ . Then tissue slices of porcine NEC were mounted on glass slides in Mowiol 4-88 reagent (Sigma). For confocal microscopy analysis, a confocal microscope A1 (Nikon AG) combined with an ECLIPSE Ti inverted microscope (Nikon) and digital imaging Nikon software (AR 3.30.02) were used. The image acquisitions were performed with the 40ϫ objective, sequential channel acquisition and not simultaneous was employed; in order to give high-resolution images, the acquiring setting was performed with optimized voxel size and automatic threshold. The images were analyzed with Imaris 8.0.2 software (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). To avoid false-positive emissions, different settings were applied, including background subtraction, threshold applications, gamma correction, and maxima. Insert surface staining (for E protein, CytoPainter, and C-Cas3) was calculated as average of positive signal of each channel from 20 different nonoverlapping fields in triplicate porcine NECs using confocal microscopy. Statistics. Figures and data collection analysis were done using GraphPad Prism 7 software (Graph-Pad Software, San Diego, CA). For viral titrations, differences between groups were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis analysis, and for individual differences the Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction as post hoc was employed. For the rest of the comparisons, such as differences between groups in the percentage of infected cells or gene expression levels, we employed a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A P value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
