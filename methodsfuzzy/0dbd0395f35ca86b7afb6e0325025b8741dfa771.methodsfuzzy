Risk analysis is a key management approach for both applied epidemiologists and invasion biologists. In this section, we focus primarily on risk assessment and return to discuss risk management later. Risk assessment is applied to help develop policies in anticipation of, and in response to, disease emergence events and biological invasions. To support these risk assessments, both disciplines aim to identify qualities (traits or syndromes) that (i) make species 'invaders' or 'emergers' (e.g. [72] [73] [74] ), (ii) make source environments more likely to yield them (e.g. [74] ), and (iii) render receiving environments susceptible or resistant to invaders or emerging pathogens [75] . Modelling is used in both invasion science and epidemiology to elucidate biological processes, predict establishment and spread, to support risk assessment and to assess effectiveness of interventions. The same 'top-down' (correlative, e.g. statistical models, ecological niche models and machine learning) and 'bottom-up' (mechanistic, e.g. dynamic simulation models, network analysis, individual-based models) methods are used for predicting the possible current and future extent of EIDs and invasive species [32, 76] . Disease modelling methods used by epidemiologists would, of course, be directly relevant to modelling all types of infectious diseases, including those that affect species other than vertebrates, including plant pathogens [77] . Methods for monitoring invasive species, including active field surveillance and citizen science-based passive surveillance, have much in common with methods used to monitor risks from emerging zoonoses and vector-borne diseases in the environment [78 -81] . Similar sampling designs are used and their implementation in target regions or sentinel sites is often determined by similar criteria, such as likely spread patterns predicted by species distribution and spread models, and occurrence of locations where impact may be greatest (e.g. [82] ). In both disciplines, molecular approaches are used to confirm species identities and for source attribution [83, 84] , and both are exploring Earth observation data as proxies for potential occurrence of invaders [85] , or risk from EIDs [86] . 3. Useful differences: opportunities for synergies 3  As invasion biologists and epidemiologists have practical objectives of reducing impacts of the species that are their focus (by prevention, eradication, containment, control or impact reduction), sharing of tools, methods and activities that facilitate these objectives may have considerable value. This subject is worthy of a review in its own right-the following are simply examples. While risk assessment of an anticipatory nature is very similar in the fields of infectious disease epidemiology and biological invasions, there are differences when risk management is conducted in the face of invasions or EIDs. In invasion science, risk management addresses the consequences of inaction by estimating the 'invasion debt', primarily of existing introduced species [99] . This approach could be readily adapted to risk management practices for EIDs. Those responsible for managing invasions use a range of tools, such as eradographs, to visualize the impacts of interventions to control geographical spread [100] and identification of management-specific switch points in control programmes that determine if and when management objectives should be changed [101] . Field surveillance/monitoring is conducted for both EIDs (particularly when these are zoonoses or vector-borne) and invasive species [102, 103] , and it may be practical and economical to develop combined field surveillance programmes. For example in Canada, south-to-north invasion of tick and fly vectors and of vector-borne pathogens of human and livestock health significance is occurring or a threat [102, 103] . While the vectors and vector-borne diseases of livestock may not have human health importance, surveillance may use methods and/or locations similar enough for collaborations in field surveillance to be logical. Molecular methods are mainstream in identifying microbial pathogens in infectious disease surveillance programmes, but these methods are almost entirely used for identifying pathogens and comparisons to identify disease clusters or to attribute sources [104] . More detailed royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsos R. Soc. open sci. 6: 181577 molecular analytical approaches are used in invasion science to understand invasion dynamics, such as underlying propagule pressure [105] , landscape-scale dispersal patterns and rates [106] , or to reconstruct invasion history and pathways [83, 107] . These approaches may assist risk assessment and policies for management [108] , while analysis of environmental DNA using meta DNA barcoding can assist in detecting any species (non-infectious invasive and EIDs) during transport, thereby aiding in preventing introductions from occurring [109] . While molecular approaches are often used to identify the provenance of source populations of invading populations and EIDs [84] , they can also provide information relevant to biological control of invasive populations, for example, identifying the native regions where the prospects of identifying co-evolved biological control agents are more likely [110] . All of these more detailed approaches could be more widely implemented in the field of EID surveillance. Passive citizen science methods of collecting information on species distributions are used both in public health and in ecology. In ecology, the object is monitoring of biogeography and global biodiversity information (e.g. eButterfly-http://www.e-butterfly.org/ and iSpot-https://www. ispotnature.org/). However, in public health, these methods have been developed to the point where data are systematically collected and analysed in national surveillance programmes to provide early warning of emerging vector-borne diseases allowing rapid responses [111] . Because most invasion science does not (directly) address human health issues, funding is probably much more difficult to mobilize for work on invasions than for EIDs. This means that cheaper means must be sought to detect new introduced species than can be implemented for EIDs. Nonetheless, the experience of public health epidemiologists in this area may benefit the field of invasion science, and epidemiologists may benefit from incorporating more cost-efficient methods developed in invasion biology. In public health epidemiology, the need for rapid, specific and sensitive methods to detect clusters of disease cases as the first sign of an outbreak has led to a revolution in molecular and bioinformatics methods ( particularly whole-genome sequencing and analysis) for species identification [104] . Given the potential for EID epidemics to arise rapidly, there has been considerable effort in public health to implement these molecular methods into programmes that systematically identify and control EIDs [111] . These complement data-driven international efforts to detect EID events including the joint WHO-OIE-FAO Global Early Warning System (GLEWS) for health threats and emerging risks at the human -animal-ecosystems interface (http://www.glews.net/), active detection of possible EID events via international media reports by the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), and passive detection of EID events by interested, voluntarily participating public health, infectious disease, veterinary, microbiology and academic experts in systems such as Promed (https://www. promedmail.org/) and Health Map (https://www.healthmap.org/en/) [111] . In general, control methods for EIDs (e.g. vaccines and quarantine) and invasive species (e.g. plant removal) are highly idiosyncratic, even if at first sight (such as chemical control of insects), they may seem very similar. However, despite these clear differences, prevention and control programmes for both EIDs and invasive species share the potential for interactions with the public to be crucial for programmes to succeed. Public trust and engagement (for example, in terms of personal and environmental impact, privacy/data-security, land ownership and access) may be essential for successful prevention and control [112] . Collaborations in developing procedures for public engagement may be very fruitful. The often-rapid nature of disease emergence requires quick mobilization of expertise, and resources, including funding and personnel. The immediate relevance of EIDs to humans has united global efforts to counter them, and this has resulted in national and international networks of public health organizations coordinated (in the case of international outbreaks) by WHO. By contrast, calls for unity over invasions (e.g. [113] ) have so far largely failed to produce effective agencies. There is, for example, no equivalent to public health organizations such as US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control that has prime responsibility for the detection and control of invasive species. This contrast is probably due to a number of reasons, including the local, regional or national (versus international) scope of many invasions, the often long time lag between biological invasions and detected impacts, and the generally slower nature of invasions, which together result in fractionated efforts that may be ineffective. Responsibilities for coordinating responses to EIDs of public health significance always lie with public health organizations, but responsibilities for responding to invasive species vary depending on the impact or location of the invasive species and may be organizations responsible for agriculture, fisheries, environment, natural resources, transport or local government entities [114] . 4) . These functions are, to a greater or lesser extent, already undertaken independently by those involved in the study, prevention and control of EIDs and biological invasions. However, we advocate for a strong, collaborative One Health approach in these actions that integrates across human, animal and environmental health, including both invasion biology and epidemiology in the field of EIDs. There are clear opportunities for immediate collaboration: (1) Predictive modelling: Modelling of dispersal, introduction and spread of EIDs and invasive species would be a relatively simple point of collaboration as the objectives are similar. This would be applicable to all parts of the continuum of management functions, but particularly to anticipating the risk of invasions and EIDs. (2) Monitoring of EIDs and invasions: International scanning, as conducted for EIDs, could be readily applied to biological invasions as has been proposed previously [115] . The increasing availability of 'big data' to support detection and monitoring of EIDs and biological invasions, and the challenges of analysing these data to provide intelligence, is a particularly needed avenue of collaborative action and research [115, 116] . Collaborative monitoring (and more systematic surveillance) for EIDs and invasive species at points of entry, monitoring in field studies (including assessing indirect effects of invasions on health), and collaboration on the development and application of molecular methods for detection and demographic analysis of populations of invasive species and EIDs are all areas where synergistic activities could increase efficiency. (3) Management of invasions and EIDs: Given the transferable skill sets between those involved in EID and invasive species management, and the possibilities for synergies between the fields, collaboration across the range of management activities could be very advantageous, recognizing that the responsibilities for managing biological invasions and EIDs may be distinct. We are not aware of examples where the application of epidemiology to biological invasions or invasion biology to EIDs has resulted in improved outcomes in terms of prevention or control. However, the application of epidemiological modelling may well have contributed to understanding patterns of spread of chytridiomycosis in amphibians, which is very likely a transmissible disease (e.g. [117] ). Similarly, while the emerald ash borer beetle and WNV (both invasive species) arrived almost simultaneously at the US -Canada border, to date practical spread modelling of the emerald ash borer as conducted by invasion biologists [118] has only been matched by theoretical mathematical modelling of the spread of WNV [119] . Furthermore, there is no cross-talk between those responsible for predicting spread and responding to the emerald ash borer (https://www.nrcan. gc.ca/forests/fire-insects-disturbances/top-insects/13377), and those responsible for responding to WNV (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/west-nile-virus/surveillance-westnile-virus.html), when it is recognized that changes in biodiversity (such as those occurring as a consequence of the invasion of emerald ash borer) may have impacts on risk from WNV [120] . The lack of integration of these responses provides a clear example of a missed opportunity to benefit from the One Health framework. Throughout, collaborations need to be win-win for epidemiologists and invasion biologists, and they need to be enabled. 'Soft' collaborations within the academic context would be the easiest to set up, and may only require simple encouragement (e.g. joint seminars, learning exchanges or workshops). More solid collaborations on joint projects, such as proposed for 'Global networks for invasion science' [121] , would require collaborative funding opportunities. Possibly the most enabling step would be the development of common collaborative programmes founded on common policy initiatives of national and international organizations responsible for managing EIDs and biological invasions. In the One Health field, this has begun with the animal health, human health and food security organizations working collaboratively on the FAO/OIE/WHO Tripartite Collaboration on antimicrobial resistance (AMR: http://www.who.int/foodsafety/areas_work/antimicrobial-resistance/ tripartite/en/). While human health has a UN organization, the WHO, that provides international leadership and coordination on EIDs, there is currently no analogous body for invasion science. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and IUCN's Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) may be two of the most promising institutional bodies that could facilitate interactions between invasion biologists and epidemiologists (and their organizations).
