SELEX technology is a common screening process for specific aptamers, including five main steps ( Fig.1) : combination, separation, elution, amplification and regulation. The first step is to use a random nucleic acid library (ssDNA or RNA) of 10 13 to 10 15 sequences to incubate with a target molecule, followed by the physical methods to separate the nucleic acid sequences combining the target molecule. Eluting and collecting the bound sequences, which are amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to generate the enriched library for the next cycle. For every target, 6 to 20 consecutive cycles are performed and the final enriched library is cloned and sequenced to obtain aptamers specifically recognizing the target molecule [11] . The SELEX process for screening aptamers of pathogenic microorganisms has two critical steps: selection of the targets for screening aptamers and separation of the binding sequences. In the SELEX aptamer selection process, the effective separation method of the nucleic acid sequences bound targets is the most critical step. In addition to the traditional separation methods including centrifugation, filtration, affinity chromatography, magnetic bead separation, some new separation technologies such as flow cytometry [65] , capillary electrophoresis [19] , surface plasmon resonance [20] , atomic force microscopy [66] are also used in separate binding sequences. These new technologies can improve the separation efficiency and reduce filtering cycles. The process can also obtain the affinity information of aptamers and the target, which greatly simplify the screening procedure and reduce the screening time. Combining these new high-performance separation methods with SELEX, the aptamer selection process to screening aptamers for a variety of pathogenic microorganisms is the future development direction in the field.
