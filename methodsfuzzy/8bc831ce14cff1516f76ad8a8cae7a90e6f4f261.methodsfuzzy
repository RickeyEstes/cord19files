Cells, virus, and antibody. The murine astrocytoma cell line DBT (Hirano et al., 1974) was used for virus growth, virus infection, and RNA transfection. The naturally occurring small plaque mutant JHM2c, the parental JHM(2), and JHM(3) strains (Makino et al., 1984 (Makino et al., , 1988 , A59, and MHV-1 were used in this study. The goat antiserum specific to MHV E protein was kindly provided by Dr. Julian Leibowitz, University of Texas in College Station, and its specificity was confirmed previously (Yu et al., 1994) . The M2 monoclonal antibody specific to an eightamino acid flag-epitope was purchased from BAbCo, Inc. Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction and cloning of viral subgenomic mRNAs. For detection of viral subgenomic mRNAs, DBT cells were infected with JHM2c at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Virus grew in the presence of actinomycin D (10 g/ml). Intracellular RNAs were isolated from cells at 7 h postinfection by the Nonidet P-40 method as described previously and used for cDNA synthesis by RT with an antisense primer 3ЈIG5-300 (5Ј-GCG TAG GCC GTG AAG CTA-3Ј). This primer is complementary to a sequence approximately 300 nucleotides downstream of the IG consensus sequence between genes 6 and 5 of viral RNAs. An additional sense primer (5ЈL9) specific to the leader was used for the subsequent PCR amplification. The conditions for the RT-PCR were essentially the same as described previously . Briefly, the RT reaction was carried out at 42°C for 90 min, and the PCR was performed in a thermocycler (DNA Engine PTC-200, M.J. Research) for 30 cycles. The condition for each cycle was denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 62°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 1 min. For detection of subgenomic mRNAs containing the CAT reporter gene, RT-PCR was carried out using a CAT-specific antisense primer 3Ј-CAT542 (5Ј-TTA CGC CCC GCC CTG CCA CTC ATC GC-3Ј, complementary to the 3Ј-end of the CAT ORF) and the leader-specific sense primer 5Ј-L9. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis either directly or after cloning and restriction enzyme digestion as indicated. PCR products were directly cloned into the pTOPO2.1 TA cloning vector (In Vitrogen). For detecting mRNA5-1 in other MHV strains [JHM(2), JHM(3), A59 and MHV-1], the antisense primer 3Ј-IG6-50 (5Ј-GCT GTC CAT TGG TAG ACG-3Ј, complementary to a sequence at nt 30-47 of the ORF6) was used for RT reaction and the primer pair 5Ј-L9 and 3Ј-IG6-50 for PCR. Analysis and sequencing of cDNA clones. All cDNA clones for JHM2c were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. RT-PCR products representing cDNA fragments derived from JHM(2), JHM(3), A59, and MHV-1 were purified from agarose gel with the gel extraction kit (GelExII, Qiagen) and used directly for DNA sequencing. Sequences were determined with the automatic DNA sequencer (Model Prizm 377, ABI) in the core facility of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, UAMS. For sequencing of the cloned DNA, either the T7 promoter primer or the M13 reverse primer was used; for direct sequencing of PCR fragments, primer 3Ј-IG6-50 was used. Plasmid constructions. For generating a DI CAT reporter plasmid containing the IG5-1 sequence (upstream of ORF5b), a three-step jumping PCR was performed. In the first PCR, pTA-IG5-370 DNA was used as a template. pTA-IG5-370 contains the 5Ј-end 370 nt of mRNA5, which was cloned after RT-PCR amplification (see Figs. 1 and 2). The sense primer was 5Ј-SpeIG5-1 (5Ј-TTA CTA GTT GTG AGT GAC GCC T-3Ј), which contains a SpeI site at the 5Ј-end (italic) and a sequence at nt 81-95 downstream of the consensus IG5 site. The antisense primer was 3Ј-IG5-1 CAT (5Ј-ATT TTT TTC TCC ATA CCC TGG TTG CTA CA-3Ј), which contains a sequence from nt 206 to 221 downstream of the consensus IG5 and the first 14 nt of the CAT ORF (italic). In the second PCR, the CAT ORF was amplified from the pDECAT2-1 DNA template with the primer pair 5Ј-CAT (5Ј-ATG GAG AAA AAA AT-3Ј) and 3ЈCAT542. Products from these two PCR reactions were purified with the Gel Elution Kit (Qiagen) following agarose gel electrophoresis and were used as templates for a third PCR with the primer pair 5ЈSpeIG5-1 and 3Ј-CAT542. The final PCR products were digested with SpeI and BspEI, and they were directionally cloned into the SpeI and BspEI sites of pDECAT2-1, generating pDECAT5-1(140). This construct contains 140 nt of the IG5-1 sequence in front of the CAT ORF. For making two deletion constructs, pDECAT5-1(140) was used as a template for PCR amplification with the primer pair 5Ј-SpeIG5-1⌬63 and 3ЈCAT542, and 5Ј-SpeIG5-1⌬76 and 3ЈCAT542, respectively. 5Ј-SpeIG5-1⌬63 (5Ј-TTA CTA GTG CTT CCA ATT TAA-3Ј) contains a SpeI site (italic) and a sequence at nt 144-156 downstream of the IG5 consensus sequence. 5Ј-SpeIG5-1⌬76 (5Ј-TTA CTA GTT ATT GCC AAC CCC GA-3Ј) contain a SpeI site at the 5Ј-end (italic), and a sequence at nt 157-172 downstream of IG5 consensus sequence. The PCR products were digested with SpeI and BspEI, and directionally cloned into the SpeI and BspEI sites of pDECAT2-1, resulting in pDECAT5-1⌬63 and pDECAT5-1⌬76, respectively (Fig.  4) . For creating DI CAT reporter constructs containing the 13-nt core sequence and its mutant, DNAs were synthesized from the pDECAT2-1 DNA templates by PCR with the primer pairs 5Ј-SpeIG5-1(13)CAT (5Ј-TTA CTA GTG CTT CCA ATT TAA ATG GAG AAA AAA AT-3Ј) and 3Ј-CAT542, and 5Ј-SpeIG5-1(13)CGC-CAT (5Ј-TTA CTA GTG CTT CCC GCT TAA ATG GAG AAA AAA AT-3Ј) and 3Ј-CAT542, respectively. Both 5Ј-primers contain a SpeI site at the 5Ј-end (italic) and the first 14 nucleotides of the CAT ORF at the 3Ј-end. While 5Ј-SpeIG5-1(13)CAT contains the wild-type, core 13-nt sequence downstream of the IG5 consensus sequence, 5Ј-SpeIG5-1(13)CGC-CAT has 3-nt mutations within this core sequence (doubleunderlined). PCR fragments were digested with SpeI and BspEI and directionally cloned into pDECAT2-1, resulting in pDECAT5-1(13) and pDECAT5-1(13)m, respectively (Fig. 4) . To construct pDECAT5 (Fig. 6) , RT-PCR was performed to generate cDNA fragments encoding the 5a gene from JHM2c RNA with the sense primer 5Ј-IG5-70 (5Ј-GTC TAC CTT GGT AGT TCA A-3Ј, corresponding to nt 70 to 53 upstream of the IG5 consensus sequence) and the antisense primer 3Ј-IG5abCAT [5Ј-ATT TTT TTC TCC ATT AAA TTA AAC ATT TC-3Ј, complementary to the first 14 nt of CAT ORF (italic) and a sequence at the overlapping junction between JHM2c ORF 5a and 5b]. In the second PCR, the CAT ORF was synthesized with primers 5Ј-CAT and 3Ј-CAT542. PCR products were purified with the Gel Elution Kit (Qiagen) following agarose gel electrophoresis and used as templates for a third PCR with the primer pair 5Ј-IG5-70 and 3Ј-CAT542. The PCR products were digested with SpeI (a natural SpeI site present immediately upstream of the IG5 consensus sequence) and BspEI, and the digested fragments were directionally cloned into the SpeI and BspEI sites of pDECAT2-1, generating pDECAT5. To create mutant pDECAT5m (Fig.  6) , an upstream DNA fragment was amplified from pDECAT5 DNA templates with the sense primer 5Ј-IG5-70 and an antisense primer 3Ј-IG5bMCG [5Ј-AAC GGG AAG CAA AAA TCT-3Ј, complementary to a sequence at the IG5-1 site with 2-nt mutations (doubleunderlined) ]. An overlapping downstream DNA fragment was amplified from the same templates with the sense primer 5Ј-IG5bMCG [5Ј-UUU UGC UUC CCG UUU AAU UAU UGC CA-3Ј, corresponding to a sequence at IG5-1 site with 2-nt mutations (double-underlined)] and the antisense primer 3Ј-CAT542. These two PCR fragments were purified and used as templates for the third PCR, in which the primer pair 5Ј-IG5-70 and 3Ј-CAT542 was used. Products were cloned into the pDECAT2-1 in the same manner as for pDECAT5. For constructing pDECAT5-1L and pDECAT5-1Lm, PCR was performed with the pair of primers (5Ј-SpeIG5-1 and 3Ј-CAT542) on the template DNAs of pDECAT5 and pDECAT5m, respectively. The PCR products were digested with SpeI and BspEI and directionally cloned into the pDECAT2-1. Mutations of these clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For in vitro transcription and translation study, a plasmid containing the 5Ј-end authentic mRNA5-1 sequence was constructed in three steps. First, a cDNA was synthesized with RT-PCR with the sense primer 5ЈSpeIG5-1 and the antisense primer 3ЈIG6-50. PCR products were digested with DraI to remove the 5Ј-end sequence of Ϸ115 nt. Second, PCR was performed to generate a cDNA containing the 5Ј-end of mRNA5-1 using pTA-mRNA5-1 DNA as a template, which was cloned in the pTOPO2.1 TA vector (see Figs. 1 and 2) . The primer pair was T7 promoter primer and 3ЈIG5-300. Third, DNA fragments from the first and second PCR were mixed and used as templates for a third PCR, in which the primer pair (the sense T7 promoter primer and the antisense primer 3ЈIG6-50) was used. PCR fragments were digested with SnaBI and blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and used for cloning. pDECAT2-1 DNA was digested with SnaBI and XbaI to remove all but the 5Ј-end 24-nt of the DI RNA, blunt-ended, and used as a vector for cloning of the above PCR fragments. The resultant plasmid pBS-mRNA5-1 contains the 5Ј-end of mRNA5-1 with the complete ORF5b (Fig. 5) . In vitro transcription and RNA transfection. For generating DI RNA for transfection, plasmid DNAs were linearized with XbaI. RNAs were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase using the MegaScript in vitro transcription kit according the manufacturer's instruction (Ambion). For generating mRNAs for in vitro translation study, plasmid DNAs were linearized with XbaI. Capped mRNAs were transcribed with the MegaScript kit in the presence of cap-analog (BRL-Gibco). DNA templates were digested with RQ DNase I (Promega). mRNAs were purified with G25 column (Ambion). The in vitro transcribed DI RNAs were transfected into MHV-infected DBT cells with the transfection reagent DOTAP according to the manufacturer's instruction (Boehringer Mannheim) as described previously . Extraction of cell lysate and CAT assay. Infected and transfected DBT cells from a 60-mm Petri dish were harvested at 8 h p.i. in most experiments, resuspended in 150 l of 0.25 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and lysed by freezing and thawing three times. Cellular lysate was incubated at 60°C for 10 min. Following a brief centrifugation, 50 l of each sample was assayed for CAT activity using an assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The CAT reaction was carried out for 12 h as described previously . In vitro translation. The in vitro translation reaction was carried out in the nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of 35 S-methionine using the in vitro transcribed RNAs according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega). Immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was carried out in 200 l of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF) containing 10 l of the in vitro translation products and 1 l of the goat-anti-E polyclonal antiserum by constant rocking on a rocking platform at 4°C overnight. The antibody-antigen complexes were then precipitated with protein G-agarose beads (Boehringer Mannheim) at 4°C for 2 h. Agarose beads were washed 3-5 times with RIPA buffer. Protein complexes were denatured by boiling for 3 min in Lammeli's sample loading buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 200 mM DTT, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenal blue, 20% glycerol) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were exposed to X-ray film and autoradiographed.
