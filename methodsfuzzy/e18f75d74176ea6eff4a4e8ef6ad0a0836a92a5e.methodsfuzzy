We designed a retrospective analysis of all children younger than 16 years of age admitted to the Department of Paediatrics, Nordsjaellands Hospital, Hillerød, Denmark, that were investigated for M. pneumoniae either by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or by serology (M. pneumoniae antibody test and cold-agglutinin test). The study period was 01.02.2010 to 31.01.2012. We collected PCR results and blood sample results from both our local microbiology laboratory (PCR) and from SSI (PCR and serology). Data were matched on social security number to avoid double sampling. PCR was performed on oropharyngeal-swabs that were stored and transported cooled to the laboratory. Diagnosis of M. pneumoniae was based on a commercially available real-time-PCR (RT-PCR) kit (Minerva Biolabs Venor R Mp Mycoplasma pneumoniae -Diagnostic Kit for qPCR type I) targeting the P1 cytoadhesion gene. The PCR was a multiplex analysis also targeting Chlamydophila pneumoniae/psittaci. The assay was performed in accordance with the manufactures description. In short 10μl sample was added to 14.4μl mastermix containing 14μl buffer, 0.2μl Taq-polymerase and 0.2μl Uracil-N-Glycosylase. RT-PCR was performed under the following conditions on a Stratagene Mx 3005P RT-PCR machine: 10 min at 95˚C followed by 45 cycles of 30 sec at 95˚C, 30 sec at 55˚C and 30 sec at 60˚C. M. pneumoniae was detected in the FAM filter. The serological tests were performed by an external commercial provider (SSI) and were based on M. pneumoniae specific IgM antibodies (MPT) together with cold-agglutinins (KAT). A titre of both MPT and KAT above or equal to 64 was considered as a positive test. Since the KAT titres fall more rapidly after a passed infection, it was used to strengthen the likelihood of an ongoing infection. It is estimated that 95% of persons under the age of 20 have positive KAT titres in response to an M. pneumoniae infection (SSI test-information). Children who presented with two or more positive PCR-tests within three months were considered as the same infective episode and only included once. The children were referred by general practitioners or the hospital's emergency department. The doctor on call ordered the M. pneumoniae sampling according to the clinical evaluation. Demographic and clinical data were collected for the 134 children, who tested positive for M. pneumoniae, by medical chart review. The charts of 612 children with negative tests have not been audited. Medical history was systematically reviewed using computerised medical records, radiological reports and laboratory reports. Characteristics analysed included demographics (age, gender, medical history prior to admission), clinical presentation (pulmonary and extra-pulmonary symptoms, clinical examination; respiratory rate, auscultation, temperature, oxygen saturation), radiological findings, biochemistry (C-reactive protein (CRP), leucocyte count at admission) co-infections, complications and medical treatment. Children were divided in age-groups for data analysis, less than two years old (referred to in the text as infants), 2-6-year-olds and 7-15-year-olds (school-aged children). To further meet the question of viral co-infections, a post-hoc analysis of the original, frozen, oropharyngeal swab specimen, from 49 of the M. pneumoniae positive cohort, were tested by PCR using a commercially available kit (Biomerieux Respiratory MWS R-Gene range) for a wide range of respiratory viruses (including; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, bocavirus and adenovirus). In short, PCR was performed in four dual-plexes; a 10μl sample was added to 15μl mastermix containing a buffer, Reverse transcriptase and primer/probe-mix. RT-PCR was performed, under the following conditions, on a Stratagene Mx 3005P RT-PCR machine: 5 min at 50˚C, 15 min at 95˚C followed by 45 cycles of 10 sec at 95˚C, 40 sec at 60˚C and 25 sec at 72˚C. Al targets were detected in the either the FAM or HEX filter. Samples positive after more than 35 Ct-cycles were re-evaluated to confirm a true positive result. The Ethical Committee of Region Hovedstaden (protocolnumber: H-2-2012-132) as well as the Danish Data Protection Agency approved the study. This approval included acceptance of reviewing the medical records without informed consent of the patients. Statistical analyses were performed in STATA 10.0, software packages SPSS version 22 and Microsoft Excell. Chi 2 -test, Fishers Exact test or Z-score test was used for categorical data analysis and two-sample T-test for numerical data. A p-value of < 0,05 was considered significant.
