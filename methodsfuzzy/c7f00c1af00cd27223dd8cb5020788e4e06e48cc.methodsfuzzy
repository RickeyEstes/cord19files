All reactions with air-and moisture-sensitive materials were performed in oven-dried glassware fitted with rub-ber septa or three-way T taps under a positive pressure of argon or nitrogen. Air-and moisture-sensitive liquids and solutions were transferred via syringe. Organic solutions were concentrated by rotary evaporation at 23-80°C (water-bath temperature). Column chromatography was performed employing Merck silica gel (60 Å pore size, 70-230 mesh ASTM). Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using glass plates pre-coated with Merck silica gel (60 Å pore size) impregnated with a fluorescent indicator (254 nm). TLC plates were visualized by I 2 vapors, UV lamp, phosphomolybdic acid solution in ethanol, or 0.5% ninhydrin in ethanol followed by brief heating on a hot plate. Commercial solvents and reagents were used as received without further purification. They were purchased from Aldrich, ACROS, BACHEM, or other commercial sources. Compounds are characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectroscopy. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) spectra and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (
