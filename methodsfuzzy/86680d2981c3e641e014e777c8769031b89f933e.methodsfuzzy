This study is designed as a two-phase multi-method study, incorporating focus groups and a questionnaire survey. In phase one, qualitative methods will be used to collect the views of a purposive sample of HCWs, to determine the range of factors associated with their responses to the prospect of working through pandemic influenza. In phase two, the findings from the focus groups, combined with the available literature, will be used to inform the design of a survey to determine the generalisability of these factors, enabling the estimation of the likely proportion of HCWs affected by each factor, and how likely it is that they would be willing and/or able to continue to work during an influenza pandemic. The study setting is the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom, which comprises 10% of the population of England, and is demographically comparable (age, gender) to the wider population, with relatively high proportions of ethnic minorities in some areas (24) . Within the West Midlands, healthcare services are provided in both rural and urban settings, and in teaching/non-teaching hospitals/community healthcare practices, allowing access to a wide range of HCWs across a wide demographic range.
