The following new procedure for bacterial sampling was used. Twenty-three patients for this portion of the study were debonded in the private office of the principle investigator (P.M.G.). The bonding resin used was chemically cured composite adhesive (Reliance Phase II; Reliance Orthodontic Products, Itasca, Ill). Patient exclusion criteria were no signs of respiratory infection, no antibiotic therapy at least 2 weeks before debanding, no steroid use during orthodontic therapy, no dental prophylaxis within 30 days preceding debanding, and at least 10 brackets per arch present. A modified bleeding index was recorded before sampling. The patient's age and total number of teeth to be debonded were also recorded. Baseline ambient air samples were collected in an enclosed room measuring 10 × 10.5 × 11.5 feet with a transparent vinyl resuscitation mask (CE 0086; Ace Surgical Supply, Brockton, Mass) connected to a 3-to 6-in sterile latex rubber surgical tube of 1/4 × 3/32-in diameter, fitted to an industrial air-suction pump (SKC Model 224-XR; SKC, Inc, Eighty Four, Pa). The mask had a porthole on its right side that intimately accommodated a high-speed handpiece (Fig 1) . The hole was cut to permit free rotation of the handpiece, yet allowed only minimal air to escape at the junction of the mask and handpiece. The pump was connected to a sterilized 0.22 μm millipore filter mounted in an ethylene oxide sterilized 37-mm cassette with support pad. Pump intake was calibrated at 4 mL per minute to simulate the average normal adult breathing flow rate. Two control samples were collected at the head of the dental chair in the same room that was used to debond the patient. The brackets were removed from the teeth with standard orthodontic debonding pliers. The patient was not permitted to rinse but could expectorate after the brackets were removed. The resuscitation mask contacted the subject's face lightly and was kept in position by the investigator (Fig 2) . The sampler was activated, and the remaining bonding resin was removed from the patient's teeth by using the high-speed handpiece operating at 30,000 rpm without suction or water coolant. A spiral fluted carbide finishing bur (FG #7901; SS White Burs, Inc, Lakewood, NJ) was used for all debonding procedures. The patient was instructed to remain silent during the entire procedure. The sampler was turned off as soon as bonding resin removal was completed. The total time of sampler operation was recorded. The patient was asked to remain still for 10 minutes. The cassettes were sealed and transported to an off-site oral microbiologic laboratory. Each cassette was opened in the laboratory within 5 hours in a contained, aerobic chamber. Each filter was placed on a blood agar plate. The plates were inverted and aerobically incubated at 35°C for 4 days. The colonies were then identified by an oral microbiologist, aerobically incubated for another 2 to 4 days, and assessed with dark-field microscopy for determination of morphotype and bright-field microscopy to observe gramstained smears. Growth viability of the colonies was then determined. Microorganisms were identified and compared with the control sample to determine genus and species. The first 11 samples were collected with the industry-approved technique for particulate sampling. This method used a 37-mm metallic cyclone (aluminum funnel) connected via a vinyl hose leading to an autoclaved 0.22-μm filter mounted in factory-sterilized plastic cassettes. These filters allowed only bacteria of 0.22-μm diameter or less to be retained for future culture and assay. It was difficult to determine whether the samples were contaminated because the autoclaved filter and cassettes, which were assembled before sampling by the investigator using a dental mask and gloved hands, became contaminated during handling. The cassettes could not be autoclaved without perishing because they could not tolerate the heat and pressure of the autoclave. The rest of the samples were then collected by using cassettes with 0.22-μm filters that were placed into the cassettes before ethylene oxide sterilization. This was accomplished by arrangement with a hospital facility to ensure full sterilization. Sterilized rubber tubing replaced the vinyl tubing. Additionally, the collection cyclone was replaced by a modified vinyl resuscitation mask that was disinfected by thorough washing in antibacterial soap. The flexible resuscitation mask effectively adapted to the patient's lower facial contours during debonding. After it was established that the collection technique was effective in harvesting airborne microbes, 2 commonly used dental masks, Fluid Resistant Molded Face Mask (3M ESPE Dental Products, St Paul, Minn) and Allegiance Caliber Brand Instagard Face Mask (Allegiance Healthcare, McGaw Park, Ill), were tested for efficacy in preventing bacteria from operator inhalation (Fig 3) . Additionally, the industrial N-95 mask (MSA Affinity Plus, model #PL-200-2; Approved Gas Masks, Beltsville, Md) from a local hardware store, but also used by health care professionals treating severe acute respiratory syndrome and H5N1 avian influenza patients, was tested. The mask tests were accomplished by the placement of a 37-mm diameter mask remnant over the collection filter in the cassette for use. The assembly was then sterilized with ethylene oxide. A different mask type was used for each of the 3 subjects. Sampling was then conducted as listed above, by using a split-mouth design as follows. All bands and bonds were removed with pliers. Half of the subject's mouth (right or left side, both maxil- lary and mandibular teeth) was then sampled during removal of bonding resin as previously described, by using the sterilized cassette (without mask remnant) prepared with the identical filter assembly as described above. The first cassette was then removed, and a second sterilized cassette was attached to the mask and pump. This cassette contained 1 of the 3 commercial dental masks placed at the intake port of the cassette lumen so that incoming air passed through the mask material and then to the filter via the suction generated by the pump. Bonding resin was then removed with the handpiece at the other side of the mouth. This technique was intended to determine whether microbes were effectively trapped by the dental mask before reaching the sampling filter. The cassettes were then sent to the laboratory for study of growth viability under anaerobic conditions followed by inspection by the microbiologist to determine differences in quantity of bacteria colony formation with and without the mask material. The collected samples were cultured on the same day as collection. Each filter was placed on a blood agar plate that was inverted and anaerobically incubated at 35°C for approximately 4 days. The agar plates were then removed from the incubator for inspection. The filter was removed, and the colonies were identified by an oral microbiologist using a 2-times magnification lens. The total number of each species type was recorded as the number of colony-forming units. The same procedure was repeated for all collected filters. Each representative colony was subsequently cultured onto another agar plate and reincubated for another 2 to 4 days for further microbiologic identification with the following testing methods: dark-field microscopy, gram-stain microscopy, speciation via chemical identification method, and growth viability under aerobic conditions. These 4 techniques are summarized below. In dark-field microscopy, from a freshly grown 4day culture, a single isolate was removed from the agar plate with a sterile loop and smeared onto a glass slide with 1 drop of distilled water. The slide was examined under a 1000-times dark-field microscope for bacterial morphotyping (eg, cocci, rod). All identifications were conducted by the same oral microbiologist. In the gram-stain microscopy, from a freshly grown 4-day culture, a single isolate was removed from the agar plate and smeared onto a glass slide for gram staining. After the sample was dried, the cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet basic dye for 1 minute. This dye is absorbed by all bacteria in a similar manner. The slides were then treated for an additional minute with a mordant (I2-KI mixture) to fix the stain, washed briefly with 95% alcohol for 10 seconds to destain the sample, and then counterstained with a paler dye of different color (safranin) for 30 seconds. Grampositive organisms retain the initial violet stain, but gramnegative organisms are decolorized by the organic solvent and thus display pink counterstain. All bacteria slides were then examined under the oil immersion lens for gross identification of the species. For growth viability under aerobic conditions, a single isolate was removed from the agar plate with a sterile loop and transferred onto another agar plate, which was then aerobically incubated at 35°C. Confirmation of growth was documented after 4 days of incubation. In the chemical identification method, from a freshly grown 4-day culture, a single isolate was removed from the agar plate with a sterile loop and transferred into growth broth and subjected to a 24-hour incubation period before chemical testing. Each species was subjected to a panel of wells (MicroScan: Rapid Anaerobe ID Panel and MicroScan: Pos Combo Panel Type 12; DADE Behring, West Sacramento, Calif) to increase identification accuracy. The sample was placed in each well, and the composite reaction of the sample generated a numeric code that was correlated to positive species identification.
