Ethics statement. Ethical P. vivax isolates. P. vivax isolates were collected from patients with acute P. vivax infection attending clinics in the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU) in Mae Sot, Thailand and from communities close to Iquitos city in the region of Loreto, Peru. A 5-ml sample of blood was collected by venipuncture in lithium-heparinized tubes from patients with P. vivax malaria mono-infection with a parasite density >1/1000 red blood cells. Samples with ≥80% parasites at the ring stage were platelet-and leukocyte-depleted using a CF11 column as previously described 67 . Purified parasites were frozen in glycerolyte 42 and stored in liquid nitrogen. The samples were then shipped to ITM, Belgium where the experiments were performed. Table S1 shows a summary of the P. vivax isolates used in each experiment and the parasite density at the time of collection. Reticulocyte-enriched red blood cells from hemochromatosis patients. Reticulocytes were enriched from 450 ml of peripheral blood collected from 13 hemochromatosis patients undergoing therapeutic phlebotomy at the ZNA Sint-Erasmus Hospital in Antwerp, Belgium. Blood samples were collected in SEPACELL bags (Fresenius Kabi) and processed within 48 hours following previously described protocols 68 . In brief, we pass blood through the leucocyte depleting filter (Fresenius Kabi) connected with SEPACELL blood bag. The Duffy phenotype (Fy) was determined by standard serologic methods (DiaMed-ID Micro Typing Systems, DiaMed) and blood grouping was done using a standard ABO antisera kit (Diamed). After depleting platelets and leukocytes, reticulocytes were concentrated by centrifugation (15 min at 400 g without applying a brake) through 70% Percoll 42 with minor modifications to Percoll concentration, which was adjusted in each sample to obtain a higher reticulocyte yield ( Table 1 ). The proportion of reticulocytes was calculated from the thin smear stained with New Methylene Blue (Sigma) under light microscopy. Samples with a proportion of reticulocytes higher than 25% were used for P. vivax invasion tests. Reticulocyte freezing and thawing was performed as previously described 42 . Invasion inhibition assays. P. vivax maturation and invasion assays were performed as previously described 42, 47 . Briefly, thawed P. vivax parasites were cultured to the schizont stage. Mature schizonts were concentrated after centrifugation (15 minutes at 1200 g) through 45% Percoll solution, which yields 90-98% enrichment of schizonts. The concentrated mature schizonts were mixed with the reRBC samples in a 1:6 (1 µl schizont and 6 µl reRBC) ratio, and cultivated in McCoy medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 25% human serum and 0.5% glucose for 25 h. Invasion inhibition assays were set up in a 96-well culture plate with a final volume of 150 µl per well. Parasite cultures were monitored by microscopic examination of the Giemsa-stained thin film. Invasion rate was defined as the percentage of P. vivax ring-stage invaded RBCs per 9,000 RBCs 24 hours post-invasion. Invasion inhibition was measured in paired reRBC samples (treated vs. untreated control well) using the same parasite isolate. An invasion assay was considered valid when parasitemia of the untreated control well was ≥0.5% with one exception (0.42%). Erythrocyte invasion with 3D7 P. falciparum parasites were used as a positive control for reRBC invasion. The used sCR1 is commercially available (Cat No 5748-CD-050, R&D SYSTEMS, USA) and supplied as lyophilized power in sterile condition without a hazard preservative and constituted in sterile PBS (400 µg/ml) as per manufacturer's instruction. We performed invasion inhibition with sCR1 (50 µg/ml concentration) as described in previous P. falciparum experiments 15, 16 . Bovine serum albumin (BSA: 50 µg/ml) and PBS (12.5%) controls were used to assess the specificity of the assay. Non-hazardous effect of the non-dialyzed sCR1 protein was tested in P. falciparum 3D7 invasion assays compared to the dialyzed sCR1 protein. Paired comparisons of invasion rates between treatments were analyzed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test in STATA v13. Enzymatic treatment of red blood cells. Enzymatic treatment of reticulocyte-enriched samples was performed by incubating 10 µl of the cell suspension with 1 mg/ml trypsin (from bovine pancreas, Sigma), 1 mg/ ml chymotrypsin (from bovine pancreas, Sigma) and 0.5 U/ml neuraminidase (from Vibrio cholerae, Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 hour 69 . CR1 enzymatic cleavage efficiency was tested by FACSCalibur 4-color flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) 15 and neuraminidase treatment was assessed by performing an agglutination test using lectin from the peanut Arachis hypogaea, to detect T-antigen which is exposed after sialic acid cleavage 69 . Flow cytometry. Expression levels of CR1 and CD71 were quantified with a FACSCalibur 4-color flow cytometer. Briefly, 200,000 cells were incubated with 5 µl of monoclonal mouse anti-human CR1-PE [E11 mAb] (Biolegend), 20 µl of monoclonal mouse anti-human CD71-APC (BD Biosciences), and 20 µl of monoclonal mouse anti-human DARC/Duffy antigen-FITC (LSBio) for one hour at room temperature. IgG1-PE, IgG1-APC and IgG-FITC conjugated antibodies were used as negative controls. Protein levels are expressed as MFI ( Figure S1 ). Protein expression and purification. DNA sequences encoding PvRBP1a (amino acids 160-1170), PvRBP1b (amino acids 140-1275), PvRBP2a (amino acids 160-1135), PvRBP2b (amino acids 161-1454), and PvRBP2c (amino acid 501-1300) were codon-optimized from the Sal-I protein sequences for Escherichia coli expression and inserted into a pPROEX HTB expression vector (Life Technologies). Protein expression and purification was performed as described earlier 70 . Immuno-precipitation assays. sCR1, recombinant PvRBPs and PfRH4 (88 kDa) 71 were incubated at 0.05 mg/ml in a reaction volume of 50-100 µl for 1 hour at room temperature. Anti-CR1 monoclonal antibody HB8592 (ATCC) was added to the mixture at 0.02 mg/ml for 1 hour, followed by additional incubation with 10 µl of packed Protein G Sepharose beads to capture the anti-CR1 mAb. The beads were washed three times with 200 µl PBS and the proteins were eluted with equivalent volumes of 2X reducing sample buffer and boiled for three www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ minutes before separating on SDS/PAGE gels. Immuno-precipitation eluates were fractionated on SDS-PAGE and visualized using SimplyBlue SafeStain (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer's protocol. CR1 SNP genotyping. Genotyping of 582 blood samples (Supplemental data) was performed following previously described protocols 23 . Primer sequences, amplification conditions, and restriction enzymes are detailed in Table S4 . For some of the reRBC samples an aliquot for DNA extraction was not available and therefore, we extracted RNA and genotyping PCR was performed on cDNA. Allele frequency distribution and linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis. LD was assessed using data from 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3, genotyping data retrieved from published studies 23, 51, 57, 72 ) and in-house genotyped. R 2 and D' were measured using LDlink web tool (http://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/LDlink/) 73 , Ensembl database (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html) for biallelic SNPs 74 and CubeX (http://www.oege.org/software/ cubex/) 75 for genotype data. R 2 and D' values ≥0.8 were considered indicative of significant correlation and LD between both SNPs. CR1 SNP data was extracted from publicly available databases, i.e., the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 76 , ALFRED (Allele Frequency Database, U.S. National Sciences Foundation) 77 , and SGVP (Singapore Genome Variation Project) 78 , and from 39 international peer-reviewed publications (Table S3 ). Comparisons were performed using chi-squared tests. P values < 0.05 were considered significant.
