The data were from nine commercial dairy farms located in south-west Sweden and participating in an experiment on the effect of group size on health and growth rate of calves from September 2002 to December 2003 (Svensson and Liberg, 2006) . Each farm had 80-120 dairy cows and housed their young calves in two group pens with automatic milk feeders, one holding 6-9 calves and the other 12-18 calves. The present study comprised 833 of the 892 calves from the above experiment, i.e. all calves which were successfully sampled for S-Hp at between 3 and 8 weeks of age. The number of studied calves per herd was 42-155 (median: 103). The calves were Swedish Reds (52%), Swedish Holsteins (40%), crossbreeds between milk breeds including Jersey (6%) or crossbreeds with a beef breed, such as Aberdeen Angus, Charolais, Hereford or Simmental (3%). Except for two herds, in which the calves were transferred to individual pens immediately after birth, each calf was kept together with its dams in a calving pen for 0.5-3 days. The animal was then housed in a single calf pen, and at 2-35 (median: 12) days of age transferred to a group pen on the farm, randomly allocated to one of the two groupsize treatments (one pen per treatment per farm). Except in one herd, where the calves were kept in cubicles bedded with sawdust with access to a concrete feeding alley, the group pens were straw-bedded or, on three farms, consisted of a straw-bedded lying area and a concrete or slatted-floor feeding alley. The total areas of the pens used for the smallsized group ranged from 11 to 40 (median: 18) m 2 , and the pens for the large-sized group measured from 19.5 to 42.2 (median: 27.0) m 2 . The lying area per calf measured 1.4 to 3.2 (median: 1.6) m 2 in the small-sized groups and 1.4 to 2.4 (median: 1.6) m 2 in the large-sized groups. The calves received their first meal of colostrum through a nipple in six of the herds and by suckling the dam in the rest of the herds. They then received whole milk (4 herds), milk replacer (1 herd) or combinations of milk replacer and whole milk (4 herds) until weaning at 8-11 weeks of age. The calves had free access to roughage (hay, silage or a grain and silage mix) from 1 to 10 days of age and free access to concentrates in the form of pelleted calf feed or, in the case of one herd, crushed grain, starting from 1 to 14 days of age. The calves had free access to water from cups from 4 to 14 days of age. The same feeding and management regimes were applied to all calves within a herd.
