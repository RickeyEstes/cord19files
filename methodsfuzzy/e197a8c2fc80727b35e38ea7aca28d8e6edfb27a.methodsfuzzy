Animals and sample preparations. A total of 17 domestic cats (Felis catus) from three different, independent households (10, four and three cats from household A, B, and C, respectively) locating in Bangkok metropolitan, Thailand, showed a similar acute onset of depression followed by bloody diarrhea, hemoptysis and seizure. The beginning of the clinical presentation was evident within 24 h after recognition of the animal's depression. Initial diagnostic tests were performed on all cats, including hematology, serum chemistry profiles and fecal examination, upon their hospital visit. The antigen of FPLV, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline coronavirus (FCoV), and antibody of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) were screened for using commercial test kits (Rapid Anigen, Bionote, South Korea). General toxicology, including warfarin and organophosphate poisoning, detection from urine and feces, and bacterial cultures from nasal and/or fecal swabs were performed in randomized cats. During supportive treatment, fecal swabs were further collected in all cats for further investigation. All experimental protocols were approved by the Chulalongkorn University Animal Care and Use Committee (No. 1631002). All procedures were done in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. The dog owners gave his/her written consent for sample collection and data publication. Later, a total of 13 of these cats died (10, two and one from household A, B, and C, respectively). With permission of the owners, three of the 13 moribund cats (one from each household) were submitted for necropsy at Department of Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University. Selected tissue samples, including the brain, lung, heart, stomach, small and large intestine, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and kidney, were collected, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and submitted for routine histopathology plus Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue staining. Microscopic findings were evaluated by an American board-certified veterinary pathologist (TK). Moreover, fresh tissues, including the brain, trachea, lung, thymus, submandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and intestines, were harvested for further molecular analysis. Fecal swabs from all 17 cats and fresh tissues from the three necropsied cats were separately homogenized and total viral RNA/ DNA was extracted using a viral nucleic acid extraction II kit (Geneaid, Taipei, Taiwan). The quality and quantity of extracted RNA/DNA was determined by absorbance of A260/280 ratio using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Thermo Scientific ™ , USA). Pan-respiratory and intestinal virologic PCR panels, including detection of herpesvirus 38 , paramyxovirus 39 , parvovirus 40 , coronavirus 41 , and BoVs 1 , were performed in selected fresh tissue samples (lung, lymph nodes, and intestine) derived from three necropsied cats. The pan-calicivirus-specific PCR primers; forward (CV2429F): 5′GAACTACCCGCCAAT3′ and reverse (CV2550R): 5′AGCACRYCATATGCGGC3′, were designed from alignment of the ORF1 sequences of various caliciviruses and then performed in the same samples. To establish the prevalence of the FBoV-1 in healthy cats and non-FPLV cats showing diarrhea, fecal swab samples from twenty healthy and fifteen fecal samples from non-FPLV cats locating in the same area (Bangkok, Thailand) of the outbreaks were included for FBoV-1 detection.
