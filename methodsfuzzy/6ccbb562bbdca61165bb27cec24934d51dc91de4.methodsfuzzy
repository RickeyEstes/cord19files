Two analyses were pre-specified: all patients who received at least one dose of micafungin (full analysis set [FAS]) were included in the safety analysis, and a per protocol set (PPS) was defined as those patients who had proven or probable IA at baseline and had received at least seven doses of study drug. All patients who received at least one dose of study drug and who met the protocolspecified criteria as determined by the independent review panel were analyzed as a modified full analysis set (mFAS). Treatment success rate was based on the global assessment of efficacy at the end of therapy following the independent review. A two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) was constructed based on the large sample normal approximation of the binomial distribution. The primary endpoint was analyzed by key demographic variables and fungal infection risk factors. Selected laboratory data, including hematology and serum chemistry data, were tabulated by patient group (primary, efficacy failure micafungin and other, efficacy failure micafungin alone, and toxicity failure). Summary statistics for each assessment time and changes from baseline were generated.
