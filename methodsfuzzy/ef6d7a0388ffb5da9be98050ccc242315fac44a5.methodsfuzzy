To determine the sensitivity of the assay for detecting mutated oseltamivir-resistant codons -120V (GTA), 276Y (TAT), and 294K (AAG) and particularly when they appear in a mixed population of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant quasispecies, five NA plasmids (Genescript, China), one wild-type containing both H276 (CAT) and R294 (AGG) codons, one wild-type containing E120 (GAA) codon, three mutations containing 276Y (TAT), 294K (AAG) and 120V (GTA) codons were constructed, respectively. The H7N9 viral RNA transcripts of NA genes were amplified from these plasmids with primers containing T7 promoter sequence in the reverse sides and were in vitro transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (TaKaRa, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The synthetic RNA transcripts were then purified, quantified, mixed in equal-molar amounts, and diluted serially to final concentrations from 10 7 to 10 1 RNA copies per assay. The synthetic RNA transcripts were also adjusted to defined 120E/V, 294R/K, and 276H/Y mixtures (100/0, 90/10, 80/20, 50/50, 20/80, 10/90, 0/100), respectively, and were amplified and pyrosequenced. To evaluate the specificity of the RT-PCR-Pyroseq procedure, the isolates of seasonal influenza H1N1, H1N1pdm09, H3N2, H5N1, H9N2, influenza type B, parainfluenza viruses (types 1, 2, and 4), human coronaviruses (229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63), respiratory syncytial viruses and rhinoviruses were tested using the RT-PCR-Pyroseq method.
