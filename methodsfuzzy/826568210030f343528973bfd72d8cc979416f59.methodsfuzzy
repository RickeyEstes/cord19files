In situ hybridisation In situ hybridization (ISH) has been used to detect and specifically locate M. hyopneumoniae DNA in formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue of naturally (Kwon and Chae, 1999) and experimentally infected pigs (Kwon et al., 2002) . This technique uses a digoxigenin-labelled specific probe targeting a repetitive sequence of the M. hyopneumoniae genome. A fluorescent oligonucleotide probe targeting 16S ribosomal DNA has also been used for species-specific identification of M. hyopneumoniae, M. hyosynoviae, and M. hyorhinis (Boye et al., 2001) . Drawbacks of this method are that it requires post-mortem samples and it is relatively time-consuming and therefore not suitable for rapid diagnosis.
