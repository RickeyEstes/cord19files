Cell lines, viruses and drugs HP-PRRSV/SD16 used in this study was isolated from an intensive pig farm with an atypical PRRS outbreak in Shandong province of China in 2012 [16] . The complete cDNA of the HP-PRRSV/SD16 genome was fully sequenced and confirmed [GenBank: JX087437]. Marc-145 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. The cyclophilin inhibitors CsA (Bioaustralis) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). CsA stock at 50 mg/mL was stored at −20°C.
