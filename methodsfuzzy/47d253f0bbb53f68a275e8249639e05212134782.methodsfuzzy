VLBW infants consecutively admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, during the 2 time periods-(1) November 1998 to May 2000 (phase 1) and (2) August 2002 to September 2006 (phase 2)-and satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria were eligible for recruitment into the study. The phase 1 study represented the period in which patients were recruited for the preliminary RCT, 11 and the phase 2 study comprised the period of subsequent recruitment for the extended trial. The gap period of nonrecruitment was the time taken to plan the phase 2 study and to apply for external funding to continue with the research project. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the 2 recruitment periods were identical. In brief, the inclusion criteria were preterm infants (1) with birth weight Ͻ1500 g, (2) who received less than half of the total daily fluid intake or Ͻ75 mL/kg/day of milk feeds by the oral route on day 14 of postnatal age, and (3) with parental consent for entering into the study. 11 Infants were excluded if they had the following: (1) lethal congenital abnormalities or chromosomal disorders; (2) congenital cyanotic heart disease; (3) anatomic obstructive gastrointestinal pathologies, such as intestinal malrotation with or without volvulus, stenosis, or atresia, gastroschisis, exomphalos and Hirschsprung's disease; (4) NEC; or (5) undergone major gastrointestinal surgery within the first 14 days of life. 11 The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong for both phase 1 and phase 2 studies, and written parental consent was obtained before randomization and enrolment for each case.
