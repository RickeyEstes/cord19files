Holstein bull calves (n = 12) from a few days to 2 wk old from a farm with no evidence of mycoplasma in any cows or calves were sought. Mycoplasma among dairy calves is common; the percentage of dairy herds with at least 1 calf that has positive results for microbial culture of nasal swabs for Mycoplasma spp. has been reported between 80 and 92% (Springer et al., 1982; ter Laak et al., 1992) . Prevalence of Mycoplasma spp. (M. bovis is the single most common species isolated) among young dairy calves from 3 to 60 d old has been reported as greater than 50% (Muenster et al., 1979; Catry et al., 2008) . The sensitivity of diagnostic methods for detection of mycoplasma in an infected calf has been reported as approximately 25% for nasal or ear swabs (Thomas et al., 2002) and 75% for tracheal swabs (Marois et al., 2007) . Therefore, some assumptions were made to screen for a mycoplasma-free herd. Multiple dairy farms were visited, and 8 calves per farm from 7 to 60 d old were sampled using nasal and ear swabs. Sensitivity of mycoplasma detection was estimated as 25%, and mycoplasma prevalence (if the herd had any mycoplasma infections) was estimated at 50% of the calves; therefore, each calf tested was assumed to have a 12.5% probability (0.25 Ã— 0.50) of testing positive for Mycoplasma spp. if the herd was positive. The probability of failure to detect the disease at the herd level in any given calf was (1 -0.125) = 0.875; using sequential probability, the probability of failing to detect mycoplasma in a positive herd (false negative herd status) if 8 of 8 calves tested negative was (0.875) 8 = 0.34 (i.e., a 66% probability that the herd was truly free of mycoplasma in calves). A dairy farm was eventually found where all 8 calves tested negative; the farm was revisited and 24 additional young calves were nasal and ear swabbed for mycoplasma and also all tested negative. With all 32 calves testing negative, the probability that the herd was truly infected and all mycoplasma test results were false-negative was (0.875) 32 = 0.013 (i.e., a 99% probability that the herd was truly free of mycoplasma in calves). After selection of the source herd, 12 additional bull calves were obtained for study on d 1 (n = 7), 31 (n = 3), and 38 (n = 2) of the study based on availability and physical examination by 2 of the authors (D. Wilson and A. Justice-Allen) . The study protocol was approved by the Utah State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
