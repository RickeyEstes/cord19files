Pigs Thirty-two hysterectomy-derived, colostrum-deprived, new born pigs were randomly assigned to two equal groups. One group was designated 3-day-old pigs and the other designated 3-wk-old pigs. Eight pigs were selected randomly from each group to be infected. All pigs were raised in the laboratory in isolation to prevent inadvertent exposure to the virus. Pigs were fed 100 ml of sterilized cow's milk [supplemented with vitamins, minerals, and eggs (11) ] twice a day into which was incorporated the water-soluble marker polyethylene glycol-4000 (PEG) at a concentration of 5 gIL. Pigs maintained for 3 wk were also given 15 ml of a ground, grain-based pig starter ration twice a day beginning at week 2, and this was increased to 30 ml by week 3. Feed intake was restricted to insure complete consumption of the meal. Both control and infected pigs readily consumed the total amount of feed given at each feeding. Steady-state marker conditions were approximated as described by Hamilton and Roe (12) . On the day of necropsy, the daily feedings were divided into eight equal GASTROENTEROLOGY Vol. 86, No.6 portions and fed at hourly intervals for 3 h and at 30-min intervals for a remaining 2 h. Although Hamilton and Roe (11) had established that a relatively constant concentration of PEG was obtained by 5 h with this schedule by means of a fistula near the ligament of Treitz, it was questioned whether or not steady-state marker conditions would be obtained throughout the digestive tract, especially in the more distal segments. We define the steady state as a constant perfusion of PEG in amount (CV) per unit time (t) throughout the digestive tract, where C is PEG concentration and Vis volume flow. Then, CjV/t = CoValt, where i and 0 refer to the input and output, respectively, to any segment of the digestive tract. Therefore, the flow rate past a sampling point is Volt = Cj V/Cot. These conditions imply that in the steady state, C and V must be constant in any given segment as a function of time. In order to test the assumption that relatively stable PEG concentrations were obtained in each segment, preliminary experiments were conducted with control pigs of each age group. These pigs were fed their meals according to the above schedule and were necropsied in groups of three at 3, 4, 5, and 6 h following the initial morning feeding. This procedure permitted examination of the change in marker concentrations with time in various segments of the bowel. These studies showed that relatively constant marker concentrations were established by 5 h in all segments of the tract examined (see Results), and, therefore, 5 h appeared sufficient to approximate steady-state conditions in the main experiment. The constancy of V is only assumed, but appears reasonable in view of the small, frequent feedings.
