In preparing the ''report card'', we pursued two lines of inquiry. First, we considered the extent to which G7 countries have lived up to their Summit commitments. Second, we considered the adequacy of those commitments when measured against relevant population health challenges. In other words, we were concerned both with the policy effectiveness of the G7, when assessed with reference to their stated intentions, and with the substantive impact of their policies, when assessed with reference to a large and growing body of research on the determinants of health in the developing world (for overviews see Evans, Whitehead, Diderichsen, Bhuiya, & Wirth, 2001; WHO, 2002c) . These lines of inquiry are analytically distinct, but also related. Notably, in 2000 the G7 committed themselves ''to the agreed international development goals (IDGs), including the overarching objective of reducing the share of the world's population living in extreme poverty to half its 1990 level by 2015'' (G8, 2000, p. 13) . These IDGs were published in 2000 as a joint effort of the UN, the OECD, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (2001), with the comment that: ''Each of the seven goals addresses an aspect of poverty. They should be viewed together because they are mutually reinforcing'' (International Monetary Fund, OECD, United Nations & World Bank Group, 2000, p. 4) . A resolution (A/RES/55/2) of the UN General Assembly in 2000 incorporated several of the IDGs, as well as other objectives that are equally ambitious, and also directly related to health (Table 1) , to generate a list that is now widely referred to as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Because the G7 countries, both individually (the MDGs) and collectively (the IDGs), have committed themselves to support a range of goals that are related to improving global health, it is appropriate to assess their Summit undertakings in light of that position. We analysed commitments made at the three Summits preceding the start of our research: Cologne (1999), Okinawa (2000) and Genoa (2001) . In addition, we limited our focus to the G7 countries, given Russia's newer membership and transitional situation. Early on, we confronted a fundamental choice. We could restrict our assessment of G7 performance to a few narrowly specific commitments, ideally involving dichotomous end points. Alternatively, we could err on the side of inclusiveness, starting from an inventory of statements many of which were not readily amenable to quantitative assessment of subsequent performance. We followed the latter course, for two reasons. First, the complexity of the determinants of health and the long period of time that sometimes elapses between policy change and health impact mean that it is necessary to assess patterns of policy commitment and implementation over time. Second, as we have noted, the fact that the G7 countries have lived up to the specific terms of a commitment made at the Summits says nothing about the adequacy of the response described in that commitment, or about its consistency with other policy objectives such as those embodied in the IDGs/MDGs. We began with key texts from the 1999-2001 Summits, primarily the formal statements issued at the start of Summits and the Communiqu! es issued at their conclusion. 1 Three individuals, each familiar with 1 An electronic archive of these texts is maintained by the University of Toronto G8 Research Centre at http://www.g8.u-(footnote continued) toronto.ca. It must be emphasized that the commitments made at Summits represent the carefully choreographed end points of a long process of networking and negotiation by officials of member governments; by no stretch of the imagination can they be considered ''off the cuff'' utterances. population health determinants (the two social scientist authors of this article and a post-doctoral researcher with training in health sociology) read these texts and independently identified statements with potential significance for population health using 13 subject matter headings. Summit commitments were then classified into one (or, sometimes, more) of three columns in a matrix: 1. Commitments that could be assessed in quantitative or dichotomous terms (e.g. expenditure figures, actions taken or not). 2. Commitments about which data exist, but where assessment would be primarily qualitative or narrative (e.g. commitments using language such as ''improve'' or ''increase''). 3. Commitments reflecting a pre-existing, but contestable or problematic position on appropriate social and economic policies (e.g. the presumption that integrating developing countries into the global economy represents the only appropriate development strategy). The matrix is available in full on the Internet (http://www.spheru.ca/www/html/Research/ Research globalization.htm). Many commitments spanned more than one column; some also related to more than one subject matter heading. This article summarizes our findings with respect to health systems and to three other areas that are especially important influences on determinants of health: macroeconomic policy, nutrition, and education. We then surveyed what turned out to be a massive literature in order to assess G7 performance with respect to Summit commitments, and the health implications of the policies reflected by those commitments. The literature comprised: quantitative data assembled by organizations including the World Bank, OECD, and several United Nations agencies; an extensive body of research by civil society organizations (CSOs) such as Oxfam and Jubilee Research; and an expanding research literature on determinants of population health in the developing world. These categories tend to overlap, in particular as the work of key CSO-affiliated researchers is published by ''mainstream'' agencies (Third World Network, 2001; Pettifor & Greenhill, 2002; . We carried out our own calculations and policy evaluations using these data, but did not check on their accuracy beyond the identification of clear inadequacies in the data as published. It must be noted that at least as many questions have been raised about the accuracy of data generated by agencies such as the World Bank and the World Health Organization (e.g. Musgrove, 2003; Reddy & Pogge, 2003) as about the research and policy recommendations of CSOs. Table 2 shows in extremely condensed form our inventory of ''promises kept, promises broken'' with respect to the subject areas included in this article, along with a one-sentence commentary. We explain these findings in the sections that follow, after which we discuss the links between the policies that they document and a more general conception of the development process that appears to underpin and unify the positions taken by the G7. That development model incorporates a powerful presumption against substantial international redistribution of resources, but our findings indicate that genuinely redistributive policies are imperative in order to improve the health of populations in the developing world.
