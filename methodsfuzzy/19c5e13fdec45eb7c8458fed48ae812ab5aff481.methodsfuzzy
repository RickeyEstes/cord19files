Six-to 11-week-old male BALB/c mice (Japan SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) were used. The animals were maintained on ovalbumin-free diets and kept under special pathogen-free conditions in a laminar flow container. Each group of animals was isolated. All experimental animals used in this study were maintained under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Yokohama City University School of Medicine.
