All existing DNA detection methods can be used for off-line detection of on-chip PCR products. The use of intercalators in combination with gel electrophoresis is the most widely used method for the detection of post-PCR products (14, 23, 25, 28, 30, 38, 40, (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) 50, 51, 54, (56) (57) (58) (59) (60) (62) (63) (64) 66, 70, 72, 77, 89) . In this combination, the DNA molecules are effectively labeled with an intercalating dye and subsequently separated according to their sizes. Upon binding to double-stranded DNA, the intercalator molecules exhibit significant enhancement in their fluorescence quantum efficiencies. Ethidium bromide (EtBr) and SYBR Green I are the most popular intercalator dyes, but other intercalating dyes, such as GoldView TM , have also been investigated (74) (75) (76) . The use of intercalator to detect DNA molecules has two main advantages: real-time detection (10, 20, 77, 79, 80) and versatility. However, indiscriminate binding is also a major disadvantage: both specific and nonspecific PCR products can produce the same type of signal and it is difficult to differentiate between them. In addition, this technique is time-consuming and labor intensive. CE is another widely used off-line detection technique (97) (98) (99) (100) . The use of CE for DNA separation detection has several obvious advantages including low operating costs, high separation efficiency, small sample volume, short analysis time, versatility and simplicity. Incorporation of CE on a chip fully utilizes these advantages. CE chips were first demonstrated in 1990 by Manz et al. (101) and have now become commercially available. One notable example is the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Recently, this commercial CE chip has been used for off-line detection of PCR products (10, 11, 13, 16, 69, 73) . Other microchip electrophoresis systems include the Hitachi SV 12-channel electrophoresis microchip (Hitachi Electronics Co.) (73) , LabChip Ã• 90 Automated Electrophoresis System (Caliper Lifesciences) (20) and CE chips with laserinduced fluorescence (LIF) detection (41, 52, 53, 56) . The off-line CE chip platform can offer walkaway and unattended analysis of DNA molecules, eliminate the time-consuming and messy slab gel process, generate much more reproducible and high quality data, and allow high-throughput laboratory analysis; however, the manual sample loading may increase the risk of cross contamination and the total analysis time. In order to circumvent the drawbacks of off-line DNA detection methods, great efforts have been made to develop on-line DNA detection methods. Some of the on-line detection methods described below may soon be routinely implemented for on-chip quantitative and/or qualitative PCR detection. Fluorescence-based DNA detection method. Fluorescencebased real-time and end-point DNA detection is a powerful and important detection technique. The realtime detection kinetically observes the fluorescence signals from the interaction between the dye or probe and the increasing amount of double-stranded DNA molecules during PCR (10, 16, 20, 37, 39, 50, 54, (77) (78) (79) (80) ; the end-point detection measures the fluorescence only before and after PCR amplification, by which it can be established whether the DNA template is successfully amplified (17, 49, 71) . Although the end-point method is simple and can be used for single cell or molecule analysis (17, 49) , it is difficult to obtain reliable results if the DNA template concentrations are calculated only by the fluorescence signals. The realtime method has become popular. It uses an analysis procedure called threshold method. The threshold value (also called C T value) represents the number of cycles necessary to produce an exact amount of DNA. By using a series of different C T values, one can calculate the DNA template concentrations and obtain the PCR efficiency. If the C T value is further used as a criterion for the PCR efficiency, the dynamic parameters of the onchip PCR can be optimized (80) . However, since the sequence-nonspecific fluorescence dyes are often utilized for the on-chip real-time PCR systems, both specific and nonspecific products will produce the same fluorescence signals that are difficult to differentiate. In order to overcome this challenge, after on-chip PCR a MCV can be performed to determine the purity of the PCR and to identify the specific target products (10, 16, 20, 78, 79) . Other on-chip fluorescence-based detection technologies are also being developed. One such example was the DNA-'up-converting' phosphor particles (UPT)-lateral flow (LF) assay on a single chip proposed by Wang et al. (63) , in which the PCR products were labeled with the UPT reporter particles in an incubation chamber, applied to the LF strip, bound to pre-immobilized ligands and detected with an IR laser. On-chip CE separation integrated with PCR. One of the most common components integrated with PCR on a single chip is CE. A hybrid DNA analytical chip that performs PCR in a silicon microheater and CE in a glass chip was first reported by Woolley et al. in 1996 (102) . Since then, a variety of chips with different degrees of functional integration have been reported (4) . Nowadays, the integrated PCR-CE chip is still a burgeoning research area (26, 27, (31) (32) (33) 35, 40, 43) . For example, Easley et al. proposed on-chip pressure injection for integration of IRmediated PCR amplification with CE separation (26) . It was reported that the total analysis time was 12 min, representing the fastest PCR-CE chip integration achieved to date. Within another integrated chip recently reported by Easley et al. (27) , nucleic acid purification through SPE, followed by PCR amplification and microchip CE amplicon separation and detection, was completed in less than 30 min. Huang et al. presented an integrated chip for DNA/RNA amplification, CE separation and on-line optical detection (40) . This work has two important improvements: (i) The sample template can be DNA or RNA and (ii) using a buried optic fiber instead of the LIF to optically detect the PCR products can avoid the bulky optical detection apparatus. Another notable work is the development of four-lane PCR-CE chip that is capable of performing multiple (RT-) PCR-CE analyses in parallel (31, 35) . Recently, Prakash and Kaler reported an integrated PCR-CE chip that performed nine PCR reactions simultaneously in separate chambers and then sequentially analyzed the PCR product from each chamber by CE (33) . Those works may represent the development trend of the future PCR-CE chips: high analytical speed, high functional integration without the need for the external bulky equipments and improved parallelism. On-chip DNA hybridization integrated with PCR. DNA hybridization is a highly selective and sensitive reaction which takes place between target DNA/RNA and a DNA probe. With the advent of microfabrication techniques, the miniaturization of the DNA probe detection has proven to be feasible, and both DNA hybridization and PCR amplification can be incorporated on a single chip to directly detect the PCR products. For example, Guttenberg et al. used the on-chip SAW pump to combine the PCR amplification with the PCR product hybridization detection (77) . Hashimoto et al. applied the PCR and/ or LDR chips combined to hybridization microarrays to detect low-abundance DNA point mutations in a continuous-flow format (59, 60) . The coupling of functional biochip and informational biochip not only allows functional operations such as sample preparation and PCR amplification by controlling the biological microfluids, but also provides information on the amount, sequence and even DNA/RNA target source through DNA hybridization microarrays.
