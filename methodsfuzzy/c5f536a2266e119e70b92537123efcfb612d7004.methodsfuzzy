Becke3-Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) [24] level with 6-311 ++ G(d,p) basis set using Gaussian 09 W [25] program package was employed for all the theoretical computations. Using the Gaussian 09 W software the spectroscopic profiling of the title molecule was carried out in its optimised state. VEDA [26] program enabled percentage potential energy distribution (PED) analysis. In addition, the relative Raman intensities were attained from the scattering activities of the fundamental modes [27, 28] . Electrostatic potential (ESP) on molecular vdW (vander Waal) surface is a useful guide to the molecule's reactive behavior, especially in noncovalent interactions [29] . ELF and LOL are tools for performing covalent bonding analysis, as they reveal regions of molecular space where the probability of finding an electron pair is high [30, 31] . The Fukui functions are electron density-based local reactivity descriptors, proposed to explain the chemical selectivity or reactivity at a particular site of a chemical system [32] . The analyses such as ESP, Molecular orbitals, Fukui functions, ELF and LOL were finished by Multiwfn 3.4.1 [33] , which is a multifunctional wavefunction analysis program. The ESP map was rendered by VMD 1.9.1 program [34] based on the outputs of Multiwfn. Frontier molecular orbitals were plotted and the charge transfer interactions were studied. NBO analysis gives a clear evidence of stabilization originating from hyperconjugation of various intramolecular interactions. The reactive sites of the title compound were identified by calculating the Fukui functions for all the atomic sites. AutoDock Suite 4.2.1 [35] was used to find the minimum binding energy, inhibition constant and various parameters of the ligand-protein docking interactions [36] .
