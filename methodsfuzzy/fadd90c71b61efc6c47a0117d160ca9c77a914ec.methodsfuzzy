Since the first reports of single-cell RNA-sequencing in 2009 [110, 111] , novel strategies have been developed by the scientific community to increase the efficiency of the methods and achieve high-resolution results. The main steps for the transcriptional analysis of single cells include (1) single-cell isolation, (2) sequencing library preparation and (3) RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses.
