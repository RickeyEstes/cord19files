Individual data record was constructed for 10,185 children for diarrhoea and 10,180 children for fever. Each record consisted of morbidity information and a list of covariates as shown in Appendix A. Geo-additive logistic models were used (on the probability of a child having diarrhoea and fever during the reference period) to determine the socio-economic and demographic variables that are associated with the ailments while simultaneously controlling for spatial dependence in the data and possible nonlinear effects of covariates. The DHS data have been collected hierarchically at the family and community levels which are inter-related. Standard analysis of the fixed effects covariates for child morbidity neglects this correlation structure and dependence in the data. This neglect leads to underestimation of standard errors of the fixed effects that inflates the apparent significance of the estimates (Bolstad & Manda, 2001) . Our analysis includes this correlation structure and account for the dependence of community in the model. The model also permitted borrowing strength from neighbouring areas to obtain estimates for areas that may, on their own, have inadequate sample sizes. This gives more reliable estimates of the fixed effect standard error. The response variable in this application is defined as Y i ¼ 1 if child i had diarrhoea or fever during the reference period t, and Y i ¼ 0 otherwise. The commonly adopted model for the analysis of this data is the probit or logistic model, and the standard measure of effects is the odds ratio (OR) (Mbonye, 2003 (Mbonye, , 2004 Woldermicael, 2001; Yoannes, Streat-eld, & Bost, 1992) . Because of the geographical nature of our data and the presence of nonlinear effects for some covariates, the assumption of a strictly linear predictor may not be appropriate, however. We use semi-parametric models to flexibly model the effects of selected socio-economic factors, continuous (metrical) and spatial covariates. Our analysis is based on a flexible geo-additive model using the district as the geographic unit of analysis, which allows separating smooth structured spatial effects from random effect and estimate the effect of continuous covariates nonlinearly without assuming a linear functional form. A probit model with dynamic and spatial effects Pr was used instead; where h is a known response function with a probit link function, and f 1 . . . ; f p are nonlinear smooth effects of the nonlinear covariates and f spat is the effect of district s i 2 f1; . . . ; Sg where child i lives. In a further step, we split up the spatial effect f spat into a spatially correlated (structured) and an uncorrelated (unstructured) effect: The rationale is that a spatial effect is usually a surrogate of many unobserved influences, some of them may obey a strong spatial structure and others may be present only locally. Models with a predictor that contains a spatial effect are also called geo-additive models (see Kammann & Wand, 2003) . More detailed description of these models is available elsewhere (for example, Kandala, Lang, Klasen, & Fahrmeir, 2001; Kandala & Madise, 2004) . This model is an extension of the probit or logistic model with a strictly linear predictor Z i ¼ a þ w 0 i g, the two main differences are the use of a flexible predictor to model the effects of covariates that clearly have nonlinear effects on diarrhoea and fever and the use flexible methods to introduce the spatial dimension on determinants of diarrhoea or fever and allocate these spatial effects to structured and unstructured (random) components. This is done jointly in one estimation procedure that simultaneously identifies socio-economic determinants, and the spatial effects that are not explained by these socio-economic determinants. In this way, we are able to identify district patterns of prevalence of diarrhoea and fever that are either related to socio-economic variables that are not in the model and that have a clear spatial pattern, or point to spatial (possibly epidemiological or environmental) processes that account for these spatial patterns. Identifying spatial patterns of disease prevalence beyond the known family socio-economic determinants should also assist in poverty mapping and associated district targeting of resources (Elbers et al., 2001) . The standard measure of effect is still the OR for logistic model and mean for probit model (but because of the use of a fully Bayesian approach that relies on prior assumption to make posterior inference, instead of 'OR' or mean, we have 'posterior OR' or posterior mean), and tests for significance, linear trends and interactions are not carried out as usual using likelihood ratio tests but the Deviance Information Criteria (DIC) (Spiegelhalter, Best, Carlin, & Van der Line, 2002) is used instead for model fit and comparison. To account for possible departures from the assumed distribution, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the posterior ORs and probability maps (the equivalent of CIs for the spatial effects) are calculated using robust standard errors estimated via Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques. The estimated coefficients follow the same interpretation as those of ordinary logistic regression: y 1 ¼ 0, y 2 ¼ 1, and exp (b i ) is the OR that y ¼ 1 when X i increases by 1. Note that the probit model corresponds to a logistic model with the cumulative distribution function replaced by the standard normal distribution. The coefficient of covariates (say, child's place of delivery: hospital, Antenatal visit, marital status, etc.) represent the difference in posterior log odds between the various categories and they are not easy to interpret apart from the sign. Taking the exponential of the coefficients gives the posterior OR and exponentiating the 95% confidence limits gives the confidence interval for the OR. Although the estimation process is complex, 1 the estimated posterior coefficients (posterior mean) should be interpreted as those of ordinary probit models.
