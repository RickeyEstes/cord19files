Cloning, expression, and purification of soluble forms of hRSV F and hMPV F and chimeric derivatives The following pRB21 (Blasco & Moss, 1995) plasmids encoding soluble forms of either hRSV F or hMPV F proteins were used in this study: (i) pRB21/prefusion hRSV F (Pre-hRSV F): This plasmid encodes the ectodomain of hRSV F (residues 1-524) from the Long strain, stabilized in its prefusion conformation by incorporating the mutations described by McLellan et al (McLellan et al, 2013a) for the DS-Cav1 protein, which included addition of both an intraprotomer disulfide bridge (S155C-S290C) and two cavity-filling substitutions (S190F and V207L) . (ii) pRB21/postfusion hRSV F (Post-hRSV F): This plasmid encodes residues 1-524 of the hRSV F ectodomain (Long strain) with a deletion of the fusion peptide (residues 137-146) to avoid aggregation (McLellan et al, 2011b; Palomo et al, 2016) . (iii) pRB21/postfusion hMPV F (Post-hMPV F). This plasmid encodes residues 1-489 of the hMPV F ectodomain (NL/1/00) in which the natural cleavage site was substituted by a polybasic furin site and the first nine amino acids of the fusion peptide (residues 103-111) were deleted . Plasmids encoding the chimeras of Fig EV1 were obtained by mutagenesis of the corresponding pRB21 plasmids using the Phusion Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and designed primers, as recommended by the manufacturer. Sequences of those primers can be obtained from the authors upon request. In all cases, the foldon trimerization domain (Meier et al, 2004) was added at the C-terminus of the F protein ectodomain, flanked upstream by a TEV protease site and downstream by a Factor Xa protease site and 6xHis-tag. The different plasmids were tested for transient expression of the wild-type or chimeric proteins as follows: monolayers of CV-1 cells growing in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (DMEM10) were infected with the furin-expressing vaccinia virus VV:bfur (Vey et al, 1994) (m.o.i . 10 pfu/cell) followed by transfection with 5 lg/ml of each plasmid mixed with 15 lg/ml of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours later, the supernatants were tested for the presence of wild-type or chimeric proteins by ELISA, with the antibodies indicated in the figure legends. For large-scale production, vaccinia virus recombinants encoding the chimeric proteins were obtained by the method of Blasco and Moss (1995) based on recombination of vRB12 with pRB21 plasmids. The vaccinia strain vRB12 lacks most of the gene encoding vp37 and hence is deficient in plaque formation under standard conditions. pRB21-derived plasmids carry a complete copy of the vp37 gene and thus, via homologous recombination with vRB12, restore vp37 function. Proteins were produced in CV-1 cells infected with the matching vaccinia virus and purified from culture supernatants using Ni 2+ columns followed by gel filtration on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column, as described .
