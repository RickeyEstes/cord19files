Cell-based testing of EBOV antiviral agents. The cell-based EBOV drug screen and cytotoxicity assays were performed as previously described 25 . Briefly, Vero E6 and Huh 7 cells were seeded at 3 × 10 4 cells/well, and MDMs at 1 × 10 5 cells/well in 96-well plates. After 24 h, cells were treated with compounds at 2-fold dilutions starting from 40 µM. The starting concentration of the ASAQ tablet suspension corresponded to 40 µM of the AQ base component. Cells were infected with EBOV/Mak 1 h after the addition of the drugs in biosafety level 4 (BSL4) containment at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.2-0.5. After 48 h, plates were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin (Richard-Allan Scientific), and EBOV/Mak was detected with a mouse antibody specific for EBOV VP40 protein (#B-MD04-BD07-AE11, USAMRIID) 27 followed by staining with Alexa Fluor ® 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (heavy + light chain) antibody (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) or with anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase labeled antibody (KPL#074-1802). Fluorescence or luminescence was quantified on a plate reader (Infinite ® M1000 Pro, Tecan US, Morrisville, NC). The signal of treated infected wells was normalized to uninfected control wells and measured (in percent) relative to untreated infected wells. Non-linear regression analysis was performed, and the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) were calculated from fitted curves (log [agonist] versus response [variable slope] with constraint to remain above 0%) (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The EBOV drug screen assay was performed with three replicates for each drug concentration, and the assay was repeated at least twice for confirmation. To evaluate cytotoxicity, cells were treated with compounds as described above in absence of virus. At 48 h after drug addition, cell viability was quantified using the CellTiter Glo luminescent cell viability assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Pharmacokinetic analysis of amodiaquine in nonhuman primates. Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were obtained from Covance Research Products (Princeton, NJ). Two groups (n = 4, 2 females and 2 males per group) were dosed with 20 or 40 mg/kg amodiaquine hydrochloride (US Pharmacopeia, Rockville, MD; Cat. 1031004; Lot J01144) orally via nasogastric intubation once daily for 3 days. NHPs were housed in stainless steel primary enclosures singly or in pairs if compatible. NHPs were provided Teklad Certified Global 20% Protein Primate Diet (#2050c) and purified water ad libitum. Clinical observations were conducted for 5 days including the day of dosing. Blood (maximal 500 μL) was collected from cephalic vessels on day 1 and day 3. On day 1, blood was collected pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h post-dose (immediately prior to dosing on day 2). On day 3, blood was collected 24 h after dose 2 (or 48 h after dose 1), immediately prior to dosing on day 3, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after dose 3. Drug concentrations of AQ and its metabolite, DEAQ, were determined in collected plasma samples using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Plasma samples (volume 50 μL) were prepared by adding 1 mL of methyl t-butyl ether. Each tube was vortexed for approximately 15 minutes (min) at maximal speed and centrifuged for 10 min at 18,000 g to facilitate separation of the liquid phases. Upper layers (850 μL) were transferred to new tubes, and the solvent was removed under vacuum in a centrifugal evaporator. The dried residues were reconstituted with 100 μL of internal standard solution (400 ng/mL risperidone and 400 ng/mL chloroquine in 75: 25 [v:v] acetonitrile:water). The tubes were vortexed 3 min and clarified by centrifugation (18,000 g) for 3 min. The clarified extracts were transferred to high performance liquid chromatography vials containing glass inserts for subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis. LC-MS/MS was performed using a LC-20AD pump system (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) and a 4000 QTrap mass spectrometer (Sciex, Concord, Ontario, Canada) in multiple reaction monitoring mode and a Polaris C18-A column (50 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm; Agilent, CA), using gradient elution with 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile as the mobile phase. The lower limit of quantitation for AQ and DEAQ of the method was 5 ng/mL. The following parameters and constants were determined: maximal plasma concentration (Cmax), time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve to the last time point and extrapolated to infinity (AUC last and AUC inf ), terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), apparent volume of distribution (V/F), and total clearance (Cl/F) after oral administration. PK parameters were analyzed using Phoenix ® WinNonlin ® software (v 6.3; Certara, Princeton, NJ) to perform noncompartmental data analysis for extravascular administration. For clinical pathology (serum chemistry, hematology), blood (1 mL) was collected prior to dosing on day 1 and approximately 24 h after the final day 3 dose. Treatment and challenge of nonhuman primates. Rhesus macaques of Chinese origin (n = 15, adult, <10 years of age) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Frederick, MD). Animals were singly housed in stainless steel primary enclosures and provided chow and purified (reverse osmosis) water ad libitum. The vehicle control group (group 1; n = 3) was treated with sterile water. Two treatment groups were treated with AQ orally once daily as a consecutive 3-day course of 20 mg/kg free base (26 mg/kg amodiaquine hydrochloride (US Pharmacopeia, Rockville, MD; Cat. 1031004; Lot J01144). Treatment began on the day of EBOV exposure (group 2; n = 6, 3 females and 3 males), or on day 3 postexposure (group 3; n = 6, 3 females and 3 males). All groups were challenged IM with a target dose of 1000 PFU) of EBOV/Mak (actual dose = 1080 PFU). The plaque assay back-titration of the challenge material was initiated on the day of preparation (study day 0) on Vero E6 cells, and plaques were fixed with 10% formalin and stained with crystal violet 8 days later. Animals were observed and weighed daily. The vehicle control group (group 1, n = 3) received an equivalent volume of sterile water (Gibco, Cat. A1287302, Lot 1835987). Weight was recorded on day -12 and day -7, then daily starting one day before challenge until primates succumbed to disease. Responsiveness of the animals was monitored following 5-point range, in which a score of 4 met primary endpoint criteria and 3 initiated secondary criteria evaluation (Table 2) . When NHPs scored a 3 for primary euthanasia criteria and their temperature was above 34 °C, secondary euthanasia criteria were reviewed. An NHP had to meet at least two secondary criteria, blood urea nitrogen ≥ 68 mg/dL, calcium ≤ 6.8 mg/dL, GGT ≥ 391 U/dL, and/or creatinine ≥ 2.8 mg/dL, for required euthanasia. Two rhesus macaques were euthanized based on their secondary criteria. Six of the fifteen rhesus macaques were euthanized based on veterinary discretion, not based on their clinical score or secondary criteria. Hematology and serum chemistry. Complete blood count with leukocyte differential was performed from peripherally collected blood samples using Vacuette K 3 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes and a Sysmex XT-2000iV hematology instrument using a preprogrammed monkey species profile (Sysmex America, NY). Plasma and serum were prepared by separation for 10 min at ambient temperature with centrifuge set to 1800 RCF. Serum chemistries were performed using the Piccolo Xpress Analyzer and General Chemistry 13 discs (Abaxis, Abbott Point of Care, NJ) from Vacuette Z Serum Clot Activator tubes (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC). Pathology and histology. All animals were humanely euthanatized in accordance with defined experimental endpoints, and gross necropsy was performed. Tissue samples were inactivated by fixing for 72 h in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Following fixation and removal from the BSL-4 laboratory in accordance with standard operating procedures, tissue samples were routinely processed in a Tissue-Tek VIP-6 automated vacuum infiltration processor (Sakura Finetek USA, Torrance, California, USA) followed by paraffin embedding with a Tissue-Tek model TEC unit (Sakura Finetek USA, Torrance, CA, USA). Using a standard semiautomated rotary microtome and lighted water flotation bath (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany), tissue sections were cut at a thickness of 4 µm and mounted on positively charged uncoated glass slides (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), air-dried at room temperature, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and coverslipped for microscopic evaluation by the pathologist.
