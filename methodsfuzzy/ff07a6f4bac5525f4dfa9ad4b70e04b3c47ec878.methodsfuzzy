This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. The index patient with SARS visited the emergency department of Hospital A on April 9, 2003, and hospitalacquired infections spread in Hospital A (a community hospital). Subsequently, index patients with SARS seen at HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED SARS IN TAIPEI, TAIWAN Hospital B (another community hospital) resulted in additional cases of hospital-acquired SARS. Hospitals A and B were closed subsequently. The Taipei Veterans General Hospital (Hospital C), the largest tertiary and national teaching hospital in Taipei City, was ordered by the government to admit the 12 patients with hospital-acquired SARS from Hospitals A and B. Two hospital staff members (a physician and an emergency department nurse) at Taipei Veterans General Hospital also acquired the SARS infection. We conducted the initial management and data-collecting protocol on April 20, 2003, and enrolled these 14 patients from April 25 to May 7, 2003 ; follow-up extended through December 2003. All 14 patients met the World Health Organization case definition, established on April 17, 2003, for SARS 1-3 : fever (temperature ≥38°C), cough or shortness of breath, and pulmonary infiltration in the absence of an alternative diagnosis to explain the clinical presentation, combined with a history of direct exposure to SARS or returning from a SARS-infected area. Although the initial chest x-ray films were normal in 3 patients, radiographic abnormalities were noted on films obtained 1 to 2 days later. All 14 of these patients with SARS were admitted to the isolation wards at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. We classified the severity of SARS into 3 groups on the basis of the oxygenation status of the patients at enrollment: mild was defined by a normal PaO 2 , moderate was defined by an abnormally low PaO 2 but a PaO 2 /fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO 2 ) ratio of 200 mm Hg or higher, and severe was defined by a PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio lower than 200 mm Hg. (Patients with severe SARS developed adult respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] and required mechanical ventilation.)
