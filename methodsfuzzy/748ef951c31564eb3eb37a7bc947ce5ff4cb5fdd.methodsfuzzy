Materials. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT), which purified them by HPLC and tested molecular weights by mass spectroscopy. Fluorescent oligonucleotides had fluorescein attached by a linker of six carbons . The concentrations of single-strand oligonucleotides were calculated from 80°C absorbance and single-strand extinction coefficients, approximated by IDT by a nearest-neighbor model (56, 57) . UV Melting of Duplexes. Optical melting was performed in standard melting buffer [1.0 M NaCl, 20 mM sodium cacodylate, and 0.5 mM Na 2 EDTA (pH 7.0)]. Single strands for forming non-self-complementary duplexes were mixed in 1:1 molar ratios, then annealed at 85°C for 2 min, and cooled to 5°C at a rate of ∼5°C/min. Absorbance versus temperature melting curves were measured at 280 nm with a heating rate of 1°C/min on a Beckman Coulter DU 640 spectrophotometer controlled by a Beckman Coulter high-performance temperature controller cooled with water flow. Duplexes were melted over a 60-fold range in oligonucleotide concentration. Data were analyzed by fitting the transition to a two-state model with sloping baselines using a nonlinear least-squares program (58, 59) . Fluorescence Competition Assay with a Donor-Acceptor Pair (FCA/DA). FRET-based titration assays have been used to directly detect free energy differences between a "reference" structure and a related "test" structure of DNA, which allows calculation of the free energy for the test structure (53) . Figure 2A illustrates the application of this method for measuring the free energy of an RNA pseudoknot. The pseudoknot (P) is labeled with fluorescein at the 3 0 end and acts as the FRET donor strand. The fluorescence intensity for the pseudoknot at 10 nM in 250 μL of standard melting buffer is measured and used as the starting point of the titration. In comparison to the BWYV pseudoknot reported elsewhere (44, 45) , which is named 437D PSK ( Figure 1B ), there is a GC dangling 3 0 end here (Figure 2A ), so the fluorescein is not directly adjacent to the pseudoknot. This construct is called PSK 1. The free energy contribution for this dangling 3 0 end was measured by melting the model duplexes 5 0 CUGGC/3 0 FCGGACCG and 5 0 CUGGC/3 0 GACCG, where F is fluorescein. To measure the free energy change for the formation of PSK 1, a strand was designed to be Watson-Crick complementary to the sequence at the 3 0 end of the pseudoknot so that its binding could compete with formation of stem 2 and thus unfold the pseudoknot. This strand was labeled with a quencher (Iowa Black FQ) to serve as an acceptor and named competitor 1. Titrations were performed in 1.0 M NaCl, 20 mM sodium cacodylate, and 0.5 mM Na 2 EDTA, at pH 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0. Aliquots of a mixture of the concentrated acceptor strand and 10 nM donor strand were added to a 10 nM donor strand solution, so the donor concentration remains constant. Aliquots were added until the fluorescence intensity remained constant within experimental error. There were typically 10 points (at least seven points) in the titration curves, from point zero to saturation. In this process, the competitor strand will break the pseudoknot and form a reference structure, whose free energy can be predicted with the INN-HB model (39) combined with hairpin loop (60) and dangling end (61, 62) free energy parameters (see the Supporting Information). Following Gelfand et al. (53) , for each titration point, the solution to be measured at pH 6.0 or 7.0 was annealed for 3 min at 75°C in a water bath and then equilibrated at 37°C for at least 15 min in a 4 mm Â 4 mm quartz cuvette in a HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer. To check for equilibrium, fluorescence intensity was measured for 150 s at intervals of 5 min. If no change was observed between two measurements, then the average over the last 150 s was taken as the fluorescence intensity of the titration point. Fluorescence was excited at 494 nm with a 2 nm band-pass, and emission was measured at the peak of the emission, 520 nm, with a 1 nm band-pass. For titration points in buffer at pH 8.0, the annealing process was omitted to avoid hydrolysis, and the measuring time for fluorescence intensity was shortened to 30 s to avoid photobleaching. The time for equilibrating was at least 30 min. To check for equilibrium, fluorescence intensity was measured at intervals of 10 min. All other operations were the same as in buffers at pH 6.0 or 7.0. Fluorescence Competition Assay (FCA). Duplex formation quenches the fluorescence by up to 30% of a 3 0 -dangling fluorescein directly adjacent to a terminal G-C base pair. Thus, a fluorescence competition assay does not require a non-nucleotide quencher. This permits a fluorescence competition assay in which only the short competition strand is labeled, which is more economical than synthesizing fluorescently labeled pseudoknots ( Figure 2B ). In this case, the equilibrium is forced to shift to the reference structure with an increase in the pseudoknot concentration. The free energy of this reference structure can be calculated by combination of optical melting results with duplex 5 0 GAACAAACGG/3 0 AACUUGUUUGF (Table 1) Because the 5 0 end dangling GG used for crystallography is not related to the competition and it is expected to stabilize stem 1 of the pseudoknot by only 0.4 kcal/mol (61, 62, 64) , it was eliminated to give the construct called PSK 2 ( Figure 2B ). Note, however, that the 5 0 nucleotide is labeled C3 to match with the 437D PSK numbering in Figure 1B . In FCA experiments, the initial solution was the fluoresceinlabeled competitor 2 at 2 nM in 250 μL of standard melting buffer and its fluorescence intensity was measured for the zero point of titration. Aliquots of a mixture of concentrated pseudoknot and 2 nM competitor 2 were added. Then, the solution was annealed at 75°C for 3 min and equilibrated for at least 15 min at 37°C. The relative fluorescence intensity was measured in the same way as in FCA/DA experiments except with a 4 nm emission band-pass. Calculating Pseudoknot Stability from FCA and FCA/ DA Data. Below is the derivation of the equation for fluorescence intensity as a function of solution composition for FCA titrations. The derivation for FCA/DA is similar. Figure 3 illustrates the equilibria involved in the calculations. Relative to fluorescein, the fluorescence from nucleotides is very low and can be neglected. The fluorescence comes from fluorescein in the free competitor single strand (C) or reference structure (RS). Therefore, the fluorescence intensity, F, is where f C and f RS are the fluorescence efficiencies for the competitor and reference structure, respectively, [C] is the concentration of free competitor strand, and [RS] is the concentration of the reference structure. The total concentration of the competitor strand is From eqs 1 and 2 In the solution, the pseudoknot RNA could be in different forms: pseudoknot ([P] for the concentration), reference structure, and hairpin ([H] for its concentration). Therefore, the total concentration of pseudoknot RNA can be expressed as Other possible conformations of the pseudoknot could be added to the equation if needed. The equilibrium constant, K c , for the competition ( Figure 3A ) can be written as From eqs 2, 4, and 5 Equation 6 can be rewritten as Solving for [RS] gives
