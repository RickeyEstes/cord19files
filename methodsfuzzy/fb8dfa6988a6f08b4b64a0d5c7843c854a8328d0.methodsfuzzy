The sequence of the TMDs of p7 was taken from the HCV genotype 1a, H77 strain (Pavlovic et al. 2003) : ALENLVILNA 10 ASLAGTHGLV 20 SFLVFFCFAW 30 YLKGRWVPGA 40 VYAFYGMWPL 50 LLLLALPQR 60 AYA. The following systems have been used in this study: TMD1 10-32 , TMD1 1-32 , and TMD2 36-58 , M L (monomer p7 with loop, residues 10-57). The assembled monomer, TMD1 and TMD2 without a loop (no loop), is named 'M NL '. The following mutations in TMD2 were generated: TMD2 36-58 Y42/45F, TMD2 36-58 Y42/45S, and TMD2 36-58 F44Y. The transmembrane domains TMD1 and TMD2 were generated as ideal helices using the MOE software package (Molecular operating environment, www.chemcomp.com).
