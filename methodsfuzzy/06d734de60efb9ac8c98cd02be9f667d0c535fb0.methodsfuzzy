This study was undertaken at the Healthy Infrastructure Research Centre at University College London. Ethical approval was obtained from University College London Research Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained in writing from all participants. Eight healthy volunteers, 4 males and 4 females working in the Research Centre participated. The experiments were conducted in a closed room free from drafts. The study subjects were in the age range 20 to 45 years and all self reported as being free from illness. To avoid cross contamination a new vuvuzela instrument was provided for each participant (Boogie Blast Co, Johannesburg, SA). The velocity of air leaving the instrument was measured using a hot-wire anemometer (Testo, UKFlow) and duration of playing recorded with a stopwatch. Our initial measurements showed that the average time of playing the vuvuzela was about 2 sec. To enable comparison with other activities undertaken at sporting events each individual tested was requested to also shout into a paper cone constructed to have the same diameter exhale opening as the vuvuzela (Figure 1 ). Subjects were requested to hold their shout for about 2 sec (not compulsory) and to shout the word ''GO''. Particles exiting the vuvuzela or the shouting cone were measured using a six channel laser particle counter (Lighthouse 5016, UK). Particles were enumerated in six categories according to their diameter: 0.5-0.7 mm; 0.7-1.0 mm; 1.0-3.0 mm; 3.0-5.0 mm; 5.0-10.0 mm and .10.0 mm. A 0.047 litre sample of air was tested every second and the number of particles recorded. Analyses are based on either the average or peak concentration observed during the vuvuzela or shouting event. Triplicate experiments were undertaken for each individual tested. Volume of the airflow was estimated by multiplying the peak air velocity recorded in the anemometer with the duration of playing and shouting and the surface area of the exhale opening of the vuvuzela and paper cone.
