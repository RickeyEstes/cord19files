A reliable turbulence model, numerical scheme, and numerical algorithm could increase the accuracy of simulation. In this study, the CFD software Airpak [13] was utilized to predict room airflow distribution and concentration fields. Airpak is used as a tool for modeling, meshing, and post processing the computational model. Table 2 Terms, coefficients and constants used in the governing equations [14] the solver engine solves the governing equations for the conservation of mass and momentum as well as for energy and other scalars, such as turbulence and chemical species. Turbulence models (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations), especially two-equation model, already become the universal used methods in the computation of indoor flow field [15] . The popular k-e model has been successfully applied to simulate indoor airflow fields [16, 17] , and the performance of the standard k-e turbulence model is good for the prediction of natural and forced convection in a room [16] . The standard k-e turbulence model [18] developed earlier, gained the broadest application in the indoor airflow calculation [7, 11, [19] [20] [21] [22] , and was used to predict the airflow field in our study. The related fundamentals of CFD modeling of fluid flow and turbulence are available in References [23] . A control-volume-based technique [14] is used to convert the governing equation into an algebraic equation that can be solved numerically. This control volume technique consists of integrating the governing equations about each control volume, yielding discrete equations that conserve each quantity on a control-volume basis. The governing equation complies with the principle of conservation and is expressed in general form as follows: Here q represents the density, / the dependent variables, C/ the effective exchange coefficient for the dependent variable /, and S/ the source term. Table 2 tabulates the parameters /, C/, and S/ employed in continuity, momentum, energy, contaminant, and turbulence equations. Field variables (stored at cell centers) must be interpolated to the faces of the control volumes in the finite volume method. Accounting for the buoyancy flow within the model room, the Boussinesq approximation was employed. The diffusion terms were central-differenced and always second-order accurate. Using the second-order discretization will generally obtain more accurate results. Thus, the second order upwind scheme was used for the treatment of the convection and diffusion-convection terms in the governing equation. After discretization, the transport equation contains the unknown scalar variable / at the cell center as well as the unknown values in surrounding neighbor cells. This equation, in general, is non-linear with respect to these variables. A linearized conservation equation for a general variable / at a cell P can be written as follows [14] : where the subscript nb refers to neighbor cells, a p the center coefficient for /, a nb the influence coefficients for the neighboring cells / nb , and b the source term. This results in a set of algebraic equations with a sparse coefficient matrix. For scalar equations, Fluent solves this linear system using a point implicit (Gauss-Seidel) linear equation solver in conjunction with an algebraic multi-grid (AMG) method. The algorithm of semi-implicit method for pressure linked equations (SIMPLE) [24] was used to solve iteratively the pressurevelocity coupling equations [11, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Moreover, this study judged the convergence not only by examining residual levels, but also by monitoring relevant integrated quantities. All discrete conservation equations are obeyed in all cells to a specified tolerance and solution no longer changes with more iterations. The convergence criterion in this study requires that the scaled residuals decrease to 10 À4 for all equations in the governing equations except the energy, for which the criterion is 10 À6 . Four grid densities, 83,274 (Case 1), 153,618 (Case 2), 220,714 (Case 3), and 310,284 (Case 4) cells, were investigated to perform the gird sensitivity study. The grid is structured, and cells are hexa-hedral. Fig. 2 presents the results of grid independent test; here V refers to the velocity magnitude of room air monitored at a specific location close to the patient, Vo the maximum velocity magnitude of room air at the boundary condition of velocity inlet, H the height of room air monitored at the specific location close to the patient, and Ho the height of room. The dimensionless velocity at the monitored points in the case of 220,714 cells was quite close to the one in the case of 310,284 cells; moreover, the relative error of the average dimensionless velocity of room air between Cases 1 and 2, Cases 2 and 3, and Cases 3 and 4 reported 0.89%, 1.06%, and 0.42%, respectively. As the difference between Cases 3 and 4 was insignificant, it could be concluded that the grid system reached an independent solution. Therefore, the grid density with 220,714 cells was found to be sufficient and applied into the continue study. The standard wall functions for the k-e turbulence model were adopted to link the solution variables at the near-wall cells and the corresponding quantities near the wall. The standard wall functions employed in our study is based on the proposal of Launder and Spalding that have been extensively used for industrial flows. To resolve reliable turbulence phenomena near the wall, the grid nearest to the wall fell into the logarithmic layer (that is, y+ >30-60). Moreover, the turbulence kinetic energy k and the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate e employed in air supply and air outlet are calculated by the following equations: where u avg refers to the mean flow velocity, I the turbulence intensity, D h the hydraulic diameter, and C l = 0.09.
