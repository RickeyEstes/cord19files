2.1. Biopanning of phage display lung cDNA libraries with SARS-CoV 3CL pro The 3CL pro -expressing E. coli strain described in our previous report [17] was used for generation of recombinant 3CL pro His-tag fusion protein. For biopanning, the T7Select human lung cDNA library fused at the C terminus of phage capsid protein 10B was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). Following the biopanning procedure in our previous report [18] , five rounds of biopanning for screening 3CL proaffinity phage clones were carried out using 3CL pro -coated microplates (5 lg per well). The 3CL pro -affinity phage clones were eluted with the soluble 3CL pro . For direct ELISA binding assay, the individual eluted phage clones that were determined using a plaque assay were coated onto microplates (10 10 p.f.u./well) for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking phage-coated plates, 100 ll of 20 lg/ml 3CL pro was added to each well for additional 1-h incubation. Bound 3CL pro was detected using the ELISA with the anti-His tag monoclonal antibody and antimouse IgG antibodies conjugated to peroxidase (Pharmacia). ELISA product was developed with a chromogen solution containing ABTS (2,2 0 -azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate)) and hydrogen peroxide and then measured at A 405 nm . The lung cDNA genes displayed on 3CL pro -affinity phages were directly amplified using PCR with the T7 Select UP primer 5 0 -GGAGCTGTCGTATTCCAGTCA-3 0 and the T7 Select DOWN primer 5 0 -CCCCTCAAGACCCGTTTA-3 0 . The nucleotide sequences of each PCR product were determined using the sequencing with the ABI PRISM 377 DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, USA). The deduced amino acid sequences of 3CL pro -interacting lung cDNA clones were aligned using the BLAST search (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).
