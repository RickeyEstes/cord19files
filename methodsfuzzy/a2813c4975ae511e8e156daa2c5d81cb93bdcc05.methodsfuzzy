DEA has been recognized as an effective nonparametric model to assess the relative efficiencies of a set of DMUs which consume multiple inputs to produce multiple outputs [34] . DEA models evaluate the relative efficiency of DMUs by creating a production frontier using the best practice of observed data. A DMU is to be rated as fully efficient on the basis of available evidence if and only if the performances of other DMUs does not show that some of its inputs or outputs can be improved without worsening some of its other inputs or outputs. After more than thirty-five years of development, research related to DEA is still growing at a very fast rate. Liu et al. [35] has summarized that during the period 2010 to 2014, around 2,000 more DEA-related papers have been published, in addition to the existing 4,500 collections before 2010 as reported by Liu et al. [36] . In this section, we first introduce a novel generalized and slacks-based non-oriented DEA model, and then, combine it with the Malmquist index.
