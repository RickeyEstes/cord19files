The CDC instructions for hospital management of biowarfare disasters provide no specific guidelines for the ED. 2 Following a review of the most effective strategies used in the SARS epidemic, as well as CDC and military guidelines on biowarfare, 3 6 basic areas were identified for effective ED management of individuals exposed to or contaminated with a biological agent. These included the following: 1) prevent hospital contamination by locking down the hospital and controlling access to the ED; 2) protect emergency care personnel through use of the appropriate level of personal protective equipment; 3) decontaminate patients to prevent ED contamination; 4) isolate patients; 5) treat patients with appropriate medications or measures, including decontamination of wounds; and 6) adhere to restrictive admission and transfer guidelines. These steps were used during a state mandated bioterrorism mass-casualty drill. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak represented a good model for management of a biowarfare agent for several reasons. SARS is spread by airborne viral particles, is difficult to detect and identify, and is highly contagious. It also has the potential to cause widespread fear and panic. These are all characteristics of an effective biowarfare agent. One of the foremost hospital priorities continues to be preventing a hospital outbreak and contain the epidemic. In Taiwan, 100 hospitals were surveyed regarding their response to SARS. 4 These surveys revealed many attempts at patient management, the most successful of which resulted in good outcomes as measured by low rates of hospital and staff infection. The largest contributor to staff infection rates was a delay in acknowledging the infectious disease emergency. 4 In Taiwan, several hospitals delayed calling the SARS epidemic a disaster. This was because of concerns that implementing strict infection-control protocols would decrease the other hospital services and incite panic. The EDs that implemented disaster infection control procedures early in the outbreak reported that fewer than 9% of their employees had a fever and had to stay home. This was compared to 47% of employees of hospitals who delayed in calling the epidemic. 4 In both Taiwan and Toronto, hospital administration restricted access by limiting the number of entranceways. 9 Several hospitals used existing lockdown procedures, such as those used for riots or fires, and involved announcing a disaster code over the PA system and coordination with security personnel. Because the most important route of exposure to biological agents is through inhalation, respiratory precautions were necessary. 6 The CDC recommends that N95 masks be used as a minimum, with powered air purifier respirators being the standard if the contaminate is unknown. 7 Complete biohazard suits ( personal protective equipment [PPE] level A) are expensive and should be used in the hot zone were the possibility of contamination is the greatest. During the SARS epidemic, the Toronto and Taiwan EDs used mostly level D working PPE: eye protection, gloves, gown, and N95 masks. 9 Biowarfare victims need to be carefully managed from the point of the event through hospital admission. Prehospital protocols based on the CDC guidelines for contaminated or infectious individuals are taught to most emergency medical system first responders; thus, a discussion of the prehospital response is not addressed here. 1 Although many hospital plans are predicated on the notion that contaminated individuals will be decontaminated prior to transport, most studies show that patients will not be decontaminated on site and transported. 8 Therefore, patients must be grossly decontaminated before entering a medical facility; a decontamination tent or isolated shower may be used. The SARS outbreak represented a good model for management of a biowarfare agent. The decontamination process includes removing and securing contaminated clothing (in biohazard bags), gently scrubbing the skin to mechanically remove large dry particles, and showering or bathing with soap and copious amounts of water. In a nonideal setting, a warm water hose can be used for decontamination. 8 Once free of visible contamination, patients are transferred to a clean area known as the cold zone, usually located inside the ED. A tape or rope line is used to physically and visibly demarcate the hot from the cold areas. Once decontaminated and located in the cold zone, patients are retriaged, have their wounds redressed, and have other devices reapplied. Patient quarantine was addressed both by physically isolating patients and by having them wear surgical masks. Isolation rooms may quickly fill, requiring the use of other non-ED treatment areas in order to separate exposed individuals from other ED patients. Toronto hospitals used separate buildings for triage and patient care. 9 Surgical masks on patients can help limit aerosolized particles when N95 masks are not available. Initial priorities are initiation of resuscitation and stabilization measures, followed by rapid disposition decisions. Definitive laboratory testing will be limited to specialized facilities. Therefore, a working diagnosis should be made based on clusters of symptoms (i.e., pulmonary complaints can be caused by tularemia, plague, or anthrax). Since our scenario presumed anthrax exposure, ciprofloxacin was used as the Food and Drug Administrationeapproved drug of choice for anthrax exposure and treatment. Doxycycline (200 mg intravenous (IV) load, followed by 100 mg IV every 12 hours) was used for pregnant patients, children, and individuals allergic to ciprofloxacin. Weight-based dosing of doxycycline was available for children less than 12 years of age. 3 Anthrax prophylaxis involves the use of ciprofloxacin for 4 weeks until receiving 4 doses of the anthrax vaccine. The vaccine is handled by the CDC and should be started immediately. Oral doxycycline (100 mg twice a day) or amoxicillin (500 mg every 8 hours) were acceptable alternatives for pregnant females or appropriate weight-based dosing for children less than 12 years of age. 3 Treatment guidelines for other potential bioagents are available in numerous references. 2 In Taiwan and Toronto, lack of beds led to restrictive admission and transfer behaviors. In Toronto, transfers were discouraged, as certain hospitals became designated SARS centers. Conversely, Taiwanese tertiary medical centers received multiple transfers from outlying rural EDs. These rural EDs subsequently limited their contamination rate by transferring potentially infectious patients once their own bed capacity was reached. Lack of isolation rooms became the key reason for transferring patients out and restricting the admissions. 4
