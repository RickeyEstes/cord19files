A solution of valproic hydrazide 2 (316 mg, 2 mmol) in ethanol (20 mL) was added to a solution of substituted isatin 3a-h (1 mmol) in ethanol (20 mL), and glacial acetic acid (2 drops); the reaction mixture was refluxed for 3-4 h. The product was separated out on cooling, filtered, and recrystallized from ethanol or ethylacetate to afford N′-(2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)-2-propylpentanehydrazide derivatives 4a-h.
