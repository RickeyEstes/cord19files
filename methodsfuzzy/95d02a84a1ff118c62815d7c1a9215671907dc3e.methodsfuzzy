Four cell lines derived from domestic cats and two cell lines derived from cheetahs were used to determine the cell susceptibility to the cheetah coronavirus, WSU 83-4497 (Table 1 ). Cells were maintained by weekly passage in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 pg/ml streptomycin, and 25 pg/ml of fungizone. A persistent virus-infected cell line of Crandell feline kidney (CrFK) cells was used as the source of the cheetah coronavirus 83-4497 (Evermann et al., 1984) . The persistently infected cells (CrFK 83-4497) were maintained as described above except were passaged every 3-4 weeks. Serum-free medium containing 5 p&/ml trypsin was used to enhance the cytopathic effect (CPE) and virus titers of UCD-1, UCD-4, and 83-4497 (Hoffmann and Wyler, 1988; Toth, 1982) .
