In a strict sense, the concept of phylodynamics is anything but new. The phylogenetic tree reconstructed by Haeckel in 1876 using phenotypic traits [31] was used to explain the distribution of the earliest humansthe "twelve races of Man"-across the globe and the location of the "Centre of Creation." This incorporation of both spatial information and phylogenetic relationships in the inference of population distributions and diversity among geographical locations is a branch of phylodynamics, often referred to as phylogeography. Since then, the progression of genetic sequencing technology as well as geographical information systems (GIS) has enabled evolutionary biologists to gain a higher resolution view of infectious disease dynamics. The 21 st century, in particular, has witnessed unparalleled advances in methods and techniques for molecular sequence data generation and analyses. However, the relationship of progress and perfection is far from linear, along with its relationship to navigational ease. For example, phylodynamic inference has transitioned into a highly statistics-focused process with the corresponding challenges, including informative samples that can significantly affect the accuracy of results [32] [33] [34] . Several research groups [32, 33] have reviewed and/or demonstrated the impact of neglecting critical quality control steps on obtaining reliable inferences using the recently developed phylodynamic frameworks, particularly with high throughput, or next-generation, sequencing (NGS) data. Some important steps include ensuring uniform spatial and temporal sampling [32] , sufficient time duration between consecutive sample collections for observing measurable evolution [33] , coverage of deep sequencing, and consideration of genomic recombination [34] . The reliance on phylodynamic methods for estimating a pathogen's population-level characteristics (e.g., effective population size) and their relationships with epidemiological data suffers from a high costincreasing the number of inference models, and thus parameters associated with these models, requires an even greater increase in the information content, or phylogenetic resolution, of the sequence alignment and associated phenotypic data. Low coverage [35] and the presence of organism-or sequencing-mediated recombination [36] , can skew estimates of the evolutionary rate and even impact the underlying tree topology, particularly when dealing with priors in the Bayesian statistical framework commonly used for phylodynamic inference. Programs such as SplitsTree [37] can take as input a nucleotide alignment and output a network in which the dual origins of recombinant sequences are displayed in a phylogeneticlike context. However, network-reconstructing programs have difficulty distinguishing actual recombination events from phylogenetic uncertainty, and branch lengths do not usually reflect true evolutionary distances [38] . Despite much work ongoing in this area, there are currently no broadly applicable methods that are able to reconstruct phylogenetic network graphs that explicitly depict recombination and allow for phylodynamic inference. Although the Bayesian framework has shown to be fairly robust with the inclusion of recombinant sequences in large population studies [39] , the inclusion threshold has not been thoroughly investigated and is likely dependent on a number of factors, such as sample size and sequence length. Recombinant sequences are thus usually removed prior to analysis; however, the ability to incorporate recombinant sequences is imperative given our knowledge of the role of recombination in virus adaptation [40] , for example. More details on methods that can potentially account for recombination, applicable to a variety of pathogens, are discussed by Martin, Lemey, & Posada [36] . While the traditional realm of phylogenetics has focused on rapidly evolving viruses, the development of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has made possible the expansion of phylodynamic methods to the analysis of slower-evolving microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and other cell-based pathogens. WGS has widened the range of measurably evolving pathogens, allowing for the identification of sparse, genetically variable sites, referred to as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), among populations sampled at different time points. The use of WGS in phylogenetics is highly beneficial not only in resolving relationships for slower-evolving organisms but also in reconstructing a more accurate evolutionary history (phylogeny) of an organism, rather than the genealogy (single gene), which can differ significantly from the phylogeny due to the presence of selective pressure or even genetic composition [41] . However, as with phylodynamic analysis of rapidly evolving viruses, WGS analysis of cell-based pathogens comes with its own challenges, as discussed in detail elsewhere [42] . Implementation of phylodynamic and/or phylogeographic analysis has transitioned over the last two decades from maximum likelihood to the Bayesian framework. This framework provides a more statistical approach for testing specific evolutionary hypotheses by considering the uncertainty in evolutionary and epidemiological parameter estimation. Given surveillance data (e.g., the duration of infection) and the specification of an epidemiological mathematical model, Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction can also be used to estimate epidemiological parameters that might otherwise be difficult to quantify [21] . For example, during the early stage of an epidemic, wherein the pathogen population is growing exponentially, the rate of exponential growth can be estimated from the phylogeny using a coalescent model that describes the waiting time for individual coalescent events of evolutionary lineages. This rate estimate can be combined with knowledge of the duration of infection for a particular pathogen to estimate the basic reproduction number, R 0 (e.g., [43] ), as well as the prevalence of infection and number of infected hosts. Transmission dynamics can similarly be inferred following the early exponential growth of the pathogen, during which the pathogen has become endemic. Estimation of these parameters is described more thoroughly in Volz et al. [21] . With the expansion of phylodynamic methods to global epidemics, theoretical studies have found that inferences of infection dynamics within the coalescent framework are limited by the assumption of a freely mixing population [32] . This assumption is often violated with the inclusion of several isolated geographical areas with single or few pathogen introductions. Without considering this factor, population structure within a phylogeny can severely bias inferences of the evolutionary history and associated epidemiological parameters [32, 44] . To overcome this limitation, software packages such as BEAST (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees) [45] [46] [47] have recently developed algorithms that allow for the integration of coalescent, mathematical, and spatial diffusion models [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . More importantly, BEAST readily implements a comparative phylogenetic approach, which incorporates parameterization of phenotypic trait evolution to identify predictors of population dynamics and spatial spread, all of which are estimated/assessed simultaneously during reconstruction of the evolutionary history [54, 55] . Statistical evaluation of the risk factors for pathogen population growth and spread can be performed concurrently with the assessment of phylogenetic resolution within the data [54] , discussed above as a challenge to complex phylodynamic analyses. For example, in the absence of strong phylogenetic resolution, Bayesian statistics are more sensitive to long-branch attraction bias [56, 57] , wherein rapidly evolving lineages appear to be closely related, regardless of their true evolutionary relationships. This phenomenon, therefore, influences inferences of spatiotemporal spread of the studied pathogen, as well as estimation of the relationship of pathogen population behavior with potential risk factors, such as climate change, host and/or vector distribution, accessibility and so on. The influence of low-resolution molecular data on the reliability of phylodynamic inferences highlights the importance of the implementation of the method described by Vrancken et al. [54] , or even a priori estimation of the phylogenetic and temporal resolution (sufficient time between sampling) [58, 59] . Unlike other phylogenetic frameworks, Bayesian inference enables utilization of prior knowledge in the form of prior distributions (in combination with information provided by the data); however, abuse of prior knowledge is possible and can lead to incorrect conclusions. Even within the Bayesian school of thought, scientists do not always agree with regard to the specification of prior distributions under certain conditions. The incorporation of prior information is, however, intuitively appealing, as it allows one to rationalize the probability of an estimate based on previous knowledge of the typical behavior of the parameter among populations of the organism under study. But what can we do if we have no knowledge regarding a particular organism or population? This has become a more pertinent issue recently with the increasing rate of discovery, facilitated by NGS, of organisms for which we have limited prior knowledge, such as novel viruses and bacteria, [60] . One of the advantages of the Bayesian phylodynamic approach is the ability to test multiple hypotheses regarding the evolution or epidemiological models used to describe infectious disease behavior, but because of the intricate relationship of these models, reliable inferences require testing of all combinations of the individual proposed models. Although often neglected due to computational complexity, improved estimates of marginal likelihoods used for statistical model comparison have been demonstrated with less computational effort [61] . Additionally, if we know that we know nothing about the parameter in question, then, in fact, we know something. Referred to as the "objective Bayesian" approach, this ideal allows researchers to alter a normally "subjective" prior to create one that is minimally informative. This term is used because the impact of this type of prior on parameter estimation can be controlled to a minimum, allowing the data to dominate the analytical process and conclusions drawn [62] . Although similarly appealing, this approach can be particularly problematic with small datasets [63] or biased datasets, such as the exclusion of potential intermediate sampling locations [27] . The expanding volume of sequence data and increasing efforts to combine epidemiological and laboratory data in open access locations can help to improve evolutionary estimates. Additionally, the growing availability of data and collaboration can accelerate our understanding of the emergence and spread of infectious diseases through coordinated efforts by multidisciplinary researchers across various institutions and public health organizations. More detail on the benefits of open access databases and data sharing in the context of phylogenetic epidemiology is reviewed in [64] and [65] .
