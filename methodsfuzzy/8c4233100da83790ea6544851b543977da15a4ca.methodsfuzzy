Effector Cells. In this investigation we used purified primary CD8 + spleen CTLs, induced by acute infection of adult C3H/ HeSnJ x C57BL/6J)F1 mice for 8 d with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), strain Armstrong (5). The use of these primary CTL (LCMV-CTL) precludes artifactual problems associated with CTL lines. These LCMV-CTL contain azurophilic granules and specifically induce the lysis and DNA fragraentation of LCMV-infected targets in an MHC class I-restricted fashion (7). A Con A lectin-dependent killing assay was used to bypass the requirements for specific antigen, in order to compare the susceptibility of various target cells to CTL-induced apoptosis (5) . CTL Assa?s. Mouse target ceils (L-929, BALB/c NIH 3T3, P815, YAC-1, and A20) were labded either with sodium Slchromate for a cytoplasmic label or with [SH]thymidine or [mI]iododeoxyuridine (12sI-IUDR.) for a DNA label and examined for the release of labels as specified in the figure legends. Where indicated, DNA was purified by guanidine HC1 denaturation in the absence of detergent and dectrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels, as described (5).
