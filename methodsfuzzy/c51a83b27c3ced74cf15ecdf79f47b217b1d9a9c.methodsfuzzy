All studies complied with American Physiology Association guidelines for animal care. Male Spragne-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to one of 3 groups (n = 5/group) as follows: Group 1 (control): no intervention; Group 2: Acute pancreatitis (AP) induced by intraperitoneal 1-arginine hydrochloride, 250 mg per 100g body weight on day 0; Group 3: AP + selenium ( 15 ixg/kg) at 24 and 48 h after induction of AP. All animals were given buprenorphine for analgesia (previously demonstrated to have no effect on outcome in this model) and sacrificed at 72h. Samples for pancreatic and lung histology were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and examined after haematoxylin and eosin staining by a histopathologist blind to group allocation. Biochemical endpoints were: serum amylase, serum anti-oxidant levels, bronchoalveolar lavage protein (BAL) and lung mydoperoxidase activity (MPO). Statistical comparisons were by non-parametric tests with P <0.05. Results: k-arginine induced AP characterised by oedema, neutrophfl infiltration, acinar cell degranulation and elevated serum amylase. Selenium supplementation had no effect on serum selenium levels. However selenium supplementation was associated with a reduction in BAL protein when compared to AP (P<O.01; Mann-Whitney U-test). In addition, acinar cell degranulation and pancreatic inflammatory cell infiltration were absent in selenium treated animals Conclusion: In this relatively prolonged study model intervention with selenium starting 24fi after induction of AP ameliorates histological stigmata of acinar cell injury and reduces pancreatic inflammatory infiltrate and has a protective effect on lung injury. These findings suggest that post-induction selenium can modulate pancreatic and lung injury in experimental AP,
