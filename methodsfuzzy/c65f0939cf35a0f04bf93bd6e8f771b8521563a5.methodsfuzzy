We take the farm as the unit of our study and ignore the possible impact of within-farm epidemic dynamics. Thus we implicitly assume disease spread within a farm is so rapid as to be practically instantaneous, with all animals on a farm becoming infectious at the same time. Our data consists of information on all the farms in the UK listed in the 2000 agricultural census [see http://www.defra.gov. uk/footandmouth/cases/index.htm ]. There were a total of 134,986 farms listed in that dataset and uniquely identified by their County/Parish/Holding (CPH) number. Their spatial coordinates are provided together with the number of animals by species within each farm. A partition of all GB farms according to the animal types represented is shown in Figure 1a . Their geographical distribution is represented in Figure 1b as the number of farms per 565 km. Notice the high density areas in the North West (Cumbria), South West (Devon), Wales and Scotland where the main epidemic foci developed. There is also an area of high density in the Shetland Islands corresponding to very small crofter smallholdings. Figure 1c and d show the numbers of sheep and cattle kept per 565 km square. During the 2001 FMD outbreak, a total of 2026 infected premises (IPs) were recorded -farms where FMD was diagnosed, and which were subsequently culled. The IP dataset contains, for each farm, the estimated date of infection (determined by a clinical evaluation of the age of lesions on affected animals), and the dates of disease reporting, confirmation and culling. A total of 7457 other (non-IP) farms were also culled -mostly as contiguous premises (CPs, about 3103) or dangerous contacts (DCs, about 1287), but some under other local culling policies used in Cumbria and Scotland. For instance about 1846 (79%) out of a total of 2342 sheep farms in Cumbria had all sheep culled under the ''local 3 km radial sheep cull'' policy adopted there. Some of the farms (about 30) were recorded both as DCs and CPs. Multiple records per farm were often found in the disease control management system dataset, and it was often unclear whether this was due to data entry errors or as a result of sequential species-specific culls on the same farm. In our analysis we therefore considered the whole farm to be culled at the last recorded date of culling. The most frequent species are cattle and sheep (see Figure 1a ). There are less than 3% farms with pigs only and only 10 farms with just pigs were diagnosed as IPs in 2001 (less than 1% of all the IPs). This indicates a-priori that pigs contributed far less to the 2001 outbreak than many other FMD outbreaks (despite their high levels of shedding [1, 17] ), and we therefore decided to discard pigs-only farms from the current study to simplify the analysis. The Sensitivity Analysis section shows that this simplification does not significantly affect estimates of other epidemiological parameters. We discarded another three IPs due to missing information or possible mistakes regarding their location or number of animals, leaving a total of 2013 IPs in our analysed dataset.
