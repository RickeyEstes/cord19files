Cells. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 5000 U penicillin, and 5 lg streptomycin, in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37째C. The culture medium was changed every other day until the cells reached confluence. Computer prediction of the secondary structure of NV 3 0 UTR. Computer analysis of the 3 0 UTR and 3 0 UTR(A) of NV was performed using the mfold-2 software [22] in http://www.rpi.edu/ezukerm/. In vitro transcription of 3 0 NV genomic RNAs. Two RNA molecules were synthesized, both containing nt 7588-7654 of the NV 3 0 UTR genome, (3 0 UTR), and only one of them having a poly(A) tail of approximately 24 nts (3 0 UTR(A)). The RNAs were produced by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase from the two PCR-amplified cDNAs containing the respective regions. The PCR was performed using the complete NV cDNA as template. The sense primer used in the PCR contained the bacteriophage T7 promoter sequence, while the antisense poly(A) primer was used for the addition of the 24 A to the 3 0 UTR PCR product. The PCR was performed for 35 cycles of 94째C for 1 min, 42째C for 1 min, and 75째C for 30 s, using a Perkin-Elmer Cetus DNA thermocycler. The resulting PCR products were purified by a QIAquiq gel extraction G-50 kit (Qiagen) before they were used as templates for RNA synthesis. After transcription reaction, the DNA template was removed by treating the samples with DNase RQ1 (Promega). Unincorporated nucleotides in the reaction mixture were removed by gel filtration. For synthesis of radiolabeled RNA transcripts, [a-32 P]UTP or [a-32 P]ATP (Dupont) was included in the transcription reaction. Preparation of HeLa cell extracts. HeLa cells were prepared using a method previously described [24] . Mobility shift electrophoresis assay. Mobility shift electrophoresis assay was performed using a method previously described [23] . The amount of S10 extract from HeLa cells varied from 5 to 20 lg, while 500 nM of the recombinant PABP (rPABP) was used. Mobility supershift electrophoresis assay. As much as 1.5 ll of polyclonal anti-PABP and anti-GADPH antibodies was incubated separately with 10 lg of S10 extracts. The antigen-antibody reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min on ice before addition of the labeled RNA. The RNA-protein supercomplexes were analyzed in a 6% native gel as described before. UV cross-linking of RNA-protein complex. UV-induced crosslinking assay of RNA-protein complexes was performed using a method previously described [24] in the presence of 40 or 60 lg of S10 extract from HeLa cells and 100 or 500 ng of the recombinant PTB protein. Immunoprecipitation of UV-induced cross-linked La-protein complexes. Immunoprecipitation of the cross-linked La-protein complex was performed using a method previously described [23] . Five hundred nanograms of monoclonal anti-La or anti-actin antibodies was used.
