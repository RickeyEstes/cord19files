The probability of a passenger being infected with pandemic influenza (Pip) in the first 100 days of a global epidemic was calculated upon the assumption that the initial cases originate in the Asian continent with a reproductive rate (Ro) value of 3 ( Fig. 1) . Ro value assumptions for other regions as follows: Europe Z 2.4, Latin America Z 2.1, Canada and U.S. Z 2.0. Ro values were derived from Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Global Quarantine and Migration, scenarios and Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS) calculations. 1 The integrated stochastic discrete event passenger process simulation involved probabilities of infected states of passengers over time (not infected, infected with PI, infected with other respiratory illness), number and originating location of international air flights arriving to the 18 U.S. airport ports of entry, and screening process decision points (Fig. 2) . Additional detailed methodology on the simulation is available. 2 The arriving international passenger screening process for U.S. airports utilized in this study is detailed in Fig. 3 . The time period of 100 days from the initial start of the global pandemic was chosen for greatest efficacy of screening; once the epidemic has been significantly established within a country, continuing to supply extensive resources to screen international travelers for a relatively low number of newly arriving cases will not significantly affect the epidemic curve within a country. Three scenarios were chosen based upon the likelihood of an individual's decision to travel when ill. In scenario 1, 50% of passengers predicted to be possibly infected with pandemic or other respiratory illness attempt to embark on international flights. High detection rates (80%) for symptomatic individuals with fever, cough, myalgia, exist at various screening layers, most importantly at the point of embarkation. This scenario results in significant number of ill passengers being identified and prevented from traveling at origin, resulting in more true positives (TP) infected with pandemic influenza detected upon U.S. arrival than false negatives (FN). False negative pandemic influenza infected but undetected asymptomatic travelers have no or minimal symptoms and only 6% are identified in the screening process. In scenario 2, 100% of passengers predicted to be possibly infected with pandemic or other respiratory illness elect to travel when ill or incubating PI, ignoring regulations for isolation and quarantine. They attempt to embark on flights and high detection rates (80%) exist at various screening layers. More total pandemic and other infected passengers are introduced into system than in scenario 1, therefore more TPs and FNs exist at U.S. screening ports of entry. In scenario 3, 50% of passengers predicted to be possibly infected with PI or other respiratory illness embark on flights with significantly reduced detection rates (<50%) especially at embarkation points. The same amount of pandemic infected passengers is introduced into the system as in scenario 1, but since less infected passengers are identified at origin, there are more TPs and FNs identified at U.S. entry screening. The predicted false negative (pandemic influenza infected but undetected) passengers were then entered into EPICAST (Epidemiological Forecasting model design and parameterization) for prediction of epidemic diffusion in the United States with resulting morbidity and mortality. 3 True Positives, passengers with pandemic influenza identified at arrival screening, are treated and isolated, thereby removed as a transmission source within the U.S. but after exposure to passengers, travel companions, and aircrew during their travel.
