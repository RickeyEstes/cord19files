Cell lines. A lymphoblast cell line, designated as T2 (174xCEM. T2), was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (cat. no. CRL-1992™; Manassas, VA, USA). This cell line is transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)-deficient and expresses HLA-A2. In the absence of exogenous antigen peptide load, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression levels on its surface are very low due to the poor stability of non-peptide-loaded MHC class I molecules. Epitope prediction. To identify the potential T-cell epitopes for EPS8, the HLA-A*0201 allele was screened, covering a wide range of populations (17) . First, the protein sequence was screened for the best binding epitopes using the algorithms SYFPEITHI (http://www.syfpeithi.de/) and Bioinformatics and Molecular Analysis Section (BIMAS; http://www-bimas. cit.nih.gov/). The cut-off score was adjusted to >20 for SYFPEITHI and T 1/2 >100 for BIMAS, and peptides matching these two criteria and which were shared by the two algorithms were selected. Second, the NetChop algorithm (http://www. cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetChop/) was used to predict whether the selected peptides in the first step would be cleaved at the C-terminus. Third, protein sequences were analyzed with five different algorithms for HLA-A*0201, including immune epitope database (IEDB; http://www.iedb.org/), NetMHC (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHC/), SVMHC (http://www.sbc.su.se/~pierre/svmhc/), EpiJen (http://www. ddg-pharmfac.net/epijen/EpiJen/EpiJen.htm) and Rankpep (http://imed.med.ucm.es/Tools/rankpep.html). Peptides predicted by at least four algorithms were selected. The known HLA-A*0201-restricted carcinoembryonic antigen peptide-1 (CAP-1, YLSGANLNL) was used as a positive control peptide (18) , while the HBcAg-derived HLA-A*2402-restricted peptide HBc117e125 (EYLVSFGVW) was used as a negative control peptide (19) , and all peptides were synthesized using standard 9-fluorenylmethyl-oxycarbonyl chemistry by the Chinese Peptide Company (Hangzhou, China). They were of >95% purity as determined by reverse-phase chromatography and their identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The lyophilized peptide powder was dissolved according to the manufacturer's instructions in ultrapure water or in dimethylsulfoxide (BioLegend), diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen Life Technologies) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and stored in aliquots at -80˚C until use. Peptide binding affinity assay. To evaluate the binding affinity of each candidate peptide to the HLA-A*0201 molecule, a classic T2 peptide-binding assay was performed as described by Dervillez et al (20) with certain modifications. T2 cells are TAP-deficient and HLA-A*0201-positive, but due to the poor stability of non-peptide-loaded HLA-A*0201 molecules, its HLA-A*0201 expression levels on the surface are low. Exogenous peptides are able to induce the accumulation of HLA-A*0201 molecules, and thus, upregulation of HLA-A*0201 molecules on T2 cells may be detected by florescent intensity exchange which reflects peptide binding ability to HLA-A*0201 molecules. Briefly, T2 cells were incubated overnight with peptides (final concentration, 100 µM) in IMDM serum-free medium containing human β2-microglobulin (final concentration, 3 µg/ml) in a humidified 26˚C incubator with 5% CO 2 . Following 18 h, the temperature was raised to 37˚C for 2 h. Cells were harvested by gently transferring into a sterile centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 200 x g for 5 min. Subsequently, cells were washed twice, firstly with serum free IMDM and then with cell staining buffer (BioLegend; cat. no 420201). The cells were then stained directly with anti-HLA-A*0201 monoclonal antibody conjugated to FITC for 30 min at 4˚C, and then analyzed using an Elite flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA). Three duplicate wells were set to each group and experiments were repeated three times; CAP-1 was used as a positive control, HBc117e125 was used as negative control, and T2 cells without any added peptide was used as a background control. The fluorescence index (FI) was calculated using the following formula: FI = [mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) sample -MFI background ] / MFI backgro und , where MFI background represents the value without peptide. FI>1.5 indicated that the peptide had a high affinity for HLA-A*0201 molecules, 1.0<FI<1.5 indicated that the peptide had moderate affinity for the HLA-A*0201 molecule, and 0.5<FI<1.0 indicated that the peptide had low affinity for the HLA-A*0201 molecule. BFA decay assay. A BFA decay assay was performed to evaluate peptide-HLA-A*0201 complex stability as described by Saini et al (21) with certain modifications. Briefly, T2 cells were seeded at 1x10 6 per well in 24-well plates and cultured with either the candidate peptides or the control peptide (final concentration, 100 µM) at 26˚C overnight in serum-free IMDM medium containing β2-microglobulin (final concentration, 3 µg/ml) to accumulate peptide-receptive class I molecules at the cell surface. Following 18 h of incubation, cells were washed and incubated with 10 µg/ml BFA dissolved in serum free IMDM for 1 h at 37˚C. Cells were harvested by gently transferring into a sterile centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 200 x g for 5 min, then washed and resuspended. The cells were then stained with anti-HLA-A*0201 fluorescent monoclonal antibody and analyzed using flow cytometry. The calculated MFIs were used as values for the time-point 0. In another group, cells were treated similarly to those above; following washing three times, cells were re-suspended in IMDM medium in the presence of 0.5 µg/ml BFA and incubated in a humidified 37˚C incubator with 5% CO 2 . Cells were harvested by gently transferring into a sterile centrifuge tube at the indicated time points and centrifuged at 200 x g for 5 min, washed and stained with anti-HLA-A*0201 fluorescent antibody. The stability of each peptide bound to HLA-A2 was measured as the DC 50 -value, which was defined as an estimate of the time required for a 50%-reduction of the MFI-value recorded at time 0. The DC 50 -value was calculated according to the formula: MFI at indicated time points / MFI at time 0 x 100%. Three duplicate wells were set for each group or experiments were repeated three times, with CAP-1 used as control.
