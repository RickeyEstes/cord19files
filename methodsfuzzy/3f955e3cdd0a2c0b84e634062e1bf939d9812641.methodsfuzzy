Filtration based samplers are relatively simple and less expensive. They are highly effective means of collecting bioaerosols. In filtration method airborne microorganisms are collected by passing air through porous membrane filters made of glass fiber, polyvinylchloride (PVC), polycarbonate or cellulose acetate (incubated by transferring onto the surfaces of growth agar media) or gelatin. Out of these gelatin filters offers a much better environment (Mandal and Brandl, 2011) . The forces that are responsible for collection of particles are inertial forces, diffusion and electrostatic attraction (Gilbert and Duchaine, 2009 ). The filter method is generally used in personal samplers (such as worn by workers at relevant facilities) rather than in general sampling due to their small size. In fact filter-based samplers when used as nonpersonal samplers were more suitable for qualitative assessments of airborne micro-organisms only (Predicala et al., 2002) . According to size fraction bioaerosol collection can be done by using polyurethane foam inserts (Kenny et al., 1998) . When filtration based samplers are used in highly contaminated environment enumeration of bioaerosol becomes impossible just similar to impaction samplers due to overloading of filters with microorganisms (Eduard and Heederik, 1998) . Desiccation/drying off of microorganisms on the filters post collection is another problem related to filtration based samplers (Hinds, 1982) . Though some microorganisms such as fungi and spore forming bacteria are sometimes found alive on the filters, vegetative bacterial cells such as Gram negative bacteria cannot tolerate the desiccation stress at all . In fact sampling time and relative humidity plays a major role in determining the loss incurred due to desiccation. It has been reported that when temperature exceeds 30Â°celsius and relative humidity increases from 30 to 85% fungal propagules are still viable while many vegetative bacterial cells become nonviable . The filters when vortexed help in the recovery of bacterial cells (Douglas, 2012) .
