The aims of this review are to examine the history of animal polyclonal antibody therapy use, its development into a safe and effective product and its potential future application to humans for emerging viruses and neglected tropical diseases. A literature search was undertaken by an experienced medical librarian to identify articles on both the safety of polyclonal In 1890, von Behring and Kitasato discovered that sera from rabbits immunised against diphtheria or tetanus were able to protect exposed mice [1] . By 1894, animal derived anti-diphtheria serum was used in humans during a European epidemic [2] ; concurrently, Phisalex and Bertrand demonstrated that the blood of horses immunised with Viper aspis (the European viper) had antivenin properties [3] . Sera from both humans and animals were subsequently used for management of illness caused by viruses such as measles, varicella and the pandemic Spanish influenza of 1918 [4, 5] . Anti-rabies polyclonal antibody preparations from hyper-immunised horses were developed in the early 20th century [6] . In this pre-antibiotic era, serum therapy was also applied to bacterial infections such as pneumococcal pneumonia, meningococcal meningitis and streptococcal scarlet fever [7, 8] . The early, crude preparations of serum were often contaminated with animal proteins; as a result, serum sickness and anaphylaxis limited their safe application. Antibiotics against bacterial infections largely superseded serum therapy in the late 1930s and 1940s [7] . During the 1960s, however, there were improvements in enzymatic digestion and purification of equine immunoglobulins, enabling safer polyclonal antibody therapies to be developed for envenomation, rabies exposure and viral infections such as hepatitis A and B, varicella-zoster virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [8] . The development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the 1970s enabled large quantities of specific antibody to be produced [8] . The humanisation of mAbs allowed their use in the treatment of chronic disease by repeated administration. However, polyclonal antibodies still proved more effective than monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of many infectious diseases. To date, most monoclonal antibody therapies are produced for either autoimmune conditions (such as systemic lupus erythematosus or Crohns disease) or neoplastic conditions. The only licenced monoclonal antibody to an infectious target is palivizumab, for RSV [9] . In contrast to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal therapy, by targeting multiple epitopes, can protect against epitope mutation [4] . Additionally, more may be needed of a low avidity monoclonal antibody preparation, compared with a polyclonal preparation, to neutralise a given amount of toxin or pathogen, as is generally the case for antitoxins to snake envenomation [10] . Animal derived polyclonal antibody therapy has been successfully and safely applied to (i) medication overdoses such as colchicine and digoxin, (ii) poisoning by snake, arachnid, marine and plant toxins, and (iii) post-exposure prophylaxis against the rabies virus [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Polyclonal antibody products can be made in large quantities and cost-effectively to respond to the great endemic demands in Asia and Africa as well as potential pandemic situations, globally.
