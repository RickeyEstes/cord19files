From April 1, 1990 , to March 30,1991, 29 patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis or cirrhosis were referred for hepatic biopsy and were entered into the study. 27 were anti-HCV positive by a first-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Chiron/Ortho Diagnostics, Raritan, New Jersey, USA). Serum samples were retested with a second-generation anti-HCV ELISA and by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA, Ortho) to measure antibodies against different viral antigens. 1 patient remained seronegative and was excluded. In the other 28 patients (9 men, 19 women; mean age 60, range 32-80 years), HCV infection was considered to be the cause of chronic liver disease because of epidemiological and histological data (table i) and other causes of chronic hepatitis, particularly autoimmune hepatitis, were excluded. No patient had antimitochondrial or liver-kidney microsomal antibodies, and smooth-muscle antibodies were found in only 3 patients at a titre below 1:100; antinuclear antibodies were found by indirect immunofluorescence on rat liver and kidney sections in 12 patients, but at a low titre (table i), and always with an irregular immunofluorescence pattern. 20 patients subsequently received 3 million units a-interferon thrice weekly; transaminase concentrations at 3 months had returned to normal in 8 patients, had improved but were still raised in 8, and were unchanged in 4. The likely cause of HCV infection was blood transfusion in 13 (mean delay 13 [SE 8] years between transfusion and biopsy), acupuncture in 1, and intravenous drug injection in 1, and no clear risk factor could be identified in 13. Table I shows the activity of liver disease characterised by Knodell's score;9 24 patients also had histological evidence of cirrhosis, with striking steatosis (> 10% hepatocytes) in 14 and large lymphocytic nodules in 9. 22 consecutive patients who underwent necropsy in our institution during the same period were used as controls for histological examination of the salivary glands. 2 were secondarily excluded, 1 because of HCV cirrhosis and 1 with autoimmune cirrhosis. Of the 20 remaining controls studied, 7 were men and 13 women with a mean age of 70 years (range 32-92). The main cause of death was stroke in 4, cancer in 5, alcoholic cirrhosis in 3, cardiac failure in 2, pulmonary embolism in 2, bacterial infection in 3, and multiple myeloma in 1; the main associated diseases were diabetes mellitus in 2, hypertension in 5, renal failure in 3, arteritis in 2, and hypothyroidism in 1. Patients with HCV infection were asked directly about symptoms of xerostomia and xerophthalmia. As no patient complained of ocular symptoms, 6 were randomly selected to undergo ophthalmologic examination, including Schirmer's tear test and the rose-bengal dye test. Labial salivary glands were sampled in normal mucosa according to the same protocol in patients and controls;" all samples were of similar size and were fixed in Boin's fluid, embedded in paraffin, and stained with haematoxylin-eosinsafranin. All sections were examined by the same pathologist, who was not aware of the origin of the samples, and were graded according to Chisholm and Mason's classification." Sections of
