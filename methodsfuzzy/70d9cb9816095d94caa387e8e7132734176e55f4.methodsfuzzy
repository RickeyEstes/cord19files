To allow an exact estimate of the antibacterial capacity of the sample, the E. coli must grow in an exponential curve in time to provide a standard growth curve for evaluating the concentration of bacteria solution. The selected single colony cultured in LB medium was kept at 37 8C and shaken at 200 rpm for 12 hours. It was then diluted to reduce the original concentration of bacteria in a stepwise manner. The diluted samples have different values of optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) reflecting the different concentrations of bacteria in solution by UV-visible adsorption spectrum apparatus. Figure 3 , A shows the plots of the OD 600 values versus the corresponding logarithmic values of the multiple of the diluted bacteria concentration (M). This standard growth curve of E. coli could be used to evaluate the concentration of bacteria in solution and reduce the experimental error. Figure 3 , B is a photomicrograph showing the E. coli on the sample surface; the bacteria were cultured in LB agar obtained by flushing with 100 mL LB medium after the experiment. The precise value of colonyforming units (CFU) of E. coli could be obtained from Figure 3 , B, using the following three steps: (1) collecting all E. coli in LB medium after exposure, (2) inoculating E. coli onto LB agar for 12 to 16 hours at 37 8C, and (3) counting the yellow colonies of E. coli. The units for CFU are CFU/mL. According to a general rule, the survival rate of bacteria can be defined by a simple formula shown as follows: where x and y are the CFU before and after exposure, respectively. Figure 4 , A shows photographs of the sample exposed to fluorescent light for different lengths of time. The survival rate of the E. coli can be calculated from Figure 4 , A and Eq. (1) using the method that has just been expressed. The result is shown in Figure 4 , B. We can also use the JISL 1902-1998 rule to estimate the antibacterial effectiveness of the defective TiO x (x b 2) photocatalyst thin film. This rule has been used for estimating the toxicity of novel drugs. According to the rule, the antibacterial index (ABI) and kill-bacteria index (KBI) of the photocatalyst thin film can be calculated by the following formulas: Here, A is the initial CFU value in which the bacteria was dropped onto the surface of a noncoated sample and was flushed immediately, B is the CFU value of a noncoated positive control sample exposed to fluorescent lamps or a coated sample in a dark field for 6 to 18 hours, and C is the CFU value of a coated photocatalyst thin film sample exposed to fluorescent lamps for 6 to 18 hours.
