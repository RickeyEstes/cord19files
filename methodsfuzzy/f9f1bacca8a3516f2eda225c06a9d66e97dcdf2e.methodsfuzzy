Given the complexity of China' PHERIS and the lack of previous research on this topic, a case research method was employed by this study. Interviews with two professors at Health Science Center of Beijing University, three healthcare informatics experts, and six healthcare IT practitioners were conducted to collect data of the development of China's PHERIS. Additional documents were reviewed to retrieve pertinent information. These documents include government IT policies and regulations, meeting minutes, reports, development plans, media reports, and news. The credibility of the governmental documents is guaranteed, since they were either obtained from government officials or downloaded from official government websites. The quality of media reports and news is likely to be questionable. Nevertheless, this is not considered a problem, since the triangulation method was employed in this study. Triangulation is a widely accepted case research method which requires collecting data from multiple information sources and posits that multi-source data will corroborate each other and increase validity [27] . Using the triangulation method, we only included in this article the information that appeared consistently in multiple sources and discarded the conflicting information. In addition, the manuscript of this paper was reviewed by a leading health informatics researcher in China who has worked with China's central government on major public health information technology initiatives, including the PHERIS project. His review has largely ensured the validity of this paper by verifying the information gathered from interviews and non-governmental sources, such as media reports and news. The rest of this paper is mainly based on the analysis of the data we collected from interviews and documents.
