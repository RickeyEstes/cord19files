An observational study was used to identify omissions in infection control practice in four clinical settings in an acute hospital (medical wards, surgical wards, accident and emergency department, and intensive care unit), and the medical and surgical wards in two rehabilitation hospitals. Data were collected in each study ward during morning (56.8%), afternoon (40.8%) and night (2.4%) shifts. Non-participant observations were conducted for 1 h on each ward. In order to reduce observer bias and the Hawthorne effect, observers were trained to observe behaviour in a neutral and non-judgemental manner, and instructed to record any additional activities that occurred during the observation period. A non-probability quota sampling method was used and a stratified sample of 206 health and support workers based on years of working experience was assembled. The sample was stratified on the basis of total numbers in each setting. For the acute hospital, samples of 76, 50 and 18 for the three strata (years of working experience of 5, 6-10, >10) respectively, and 17, 27 and 18 for each stratum for the two rehabilitation hospitals, were required. The final sample contained 109 (52.9%) nurses, 45 (21.8%) doctors, 8 (3.9%) therapists, and 44 (21.4%) support workers, most of whom were female (72%). Two-thirds (69%) worked in medical wards, 34 (16%) in surgical wards, 14 (7%) in the accident and emergency department, and 16 (8%) in the intensive care unit. Of the participants, 45% had <6 years working experience, 37% had 6-10 years, and 18% >10.
