The cardiac pathology archive of the Caspary Research Institute was reviewed for cats that died of idiopathic cardiomyopathy. This search identified formalin-fixed hearts from 120 cases between 1994 and 1997. One-quarter of these were randomly selected for study and represented 18 cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 6 with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), and 7 with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). For comparison, formalin-fixed, ageand gender-matched cats were selected from the pathology archives of The Ohio State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital who died for noncardiac conditions. Between 1995 and 1997, 17 such cases were identified and comprised the control group. We screened for feline panleukopenia (a parvovirus), calici, herpes, and corona virus, agents that are prevalent in the domestic cat (19) , and reported to cause myocarditis in humans, dogs, rabbits, and pigs (10, 16, (20) (21) (22) (23) .
