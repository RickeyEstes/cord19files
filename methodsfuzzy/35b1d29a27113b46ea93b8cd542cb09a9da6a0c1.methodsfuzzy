It is challenging to diagnose pathogen in case of influenza, because it shows similar symptoms like rhinoviruses, parainfluenza, adenoviruses and respiratory syncytial virus. Influenza virus spreads quickly within 24 h and can be collected within 2-5 days from nasal and tracheal-throat swabs that are introduced in transport media to keep them alive until transportation to specific laboratories and media sample to detect influenza quickly. A large number of tests are possible for detection, which have different specificity based on the type of detection factor that can be antibody production, direct culturing in cell and nucleic acid amplification detection like RT-PCR and RT-LAMP as shown in Figure 2 . These methods help in early treatment of a patient before converting infection into a severe case. All available detection methods for detection of A (H1N1) pdm09 with their analytic characteristics, merits and demerits are mentioned in Tables 1 and 2 . Earlier, Chauhan et al. [31] reviewed some methods of influenza A(H1N1) detection such as viral culture, rapid antigen tests, direct immune fluorescence (DFA) and RT-PCR. The detection methods of influenza A(H1N1) can be classified as follow:  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the method of choice that is currently in use for swine flu detection and for many other pathogens also. It can be reverse transcriptase based PCR and real-time PCR. Every time WHO publish guidelines for the detection of swine flu. Basically in a two step RT-PCR, RNA first has to be converted into cDNA using reverse transcriptase enzymes and then in second step random hexamers are used for amplification of segments. Whereas, in one step RT-PCR gene specific primers with reverse transcriptase enzyme were added in one flow. Virus type specific differentiation is carried out using matrix gene amplification because matrix gene shows conservation in virus that makes it useful for the typing of influenza. Subtyping is carried out with HA gene using specific primers. These methods are very sensitive, but take long time for confirmation. Testing is carried out at Specific centres which further delay diagnosis and make condition of patient severe. In 1999, a reverse transcription based polymerase chain reaction was developed to differentiate between two different subtypes of influenza A H1 and H3. Test was held in both for egg derived isolates and also from lung tissue homogenates. Positive samples were confirmed using immunological assays and it was found that sensitivity was 88.2%, 70% and specificity was 100%, 95.2% in case of egg fluids and lung tissue homogenates respectively [66] . A new real-time PCR and conventional RT-PCR assay was developed for detection of novel A(H1N1)pdm09, which can discriminate seasonal H1N1 viruses from other subtypes and also between other swine viruses and human H1 types successfully [67] . A number of studies also reported development of multiplex real-time PCR assay based on matrix gene for detection of reverse zoonotic influenza infection H1N1 pdm2009 from endemic swine influenza viruses [68] . These PCR assays provide good results but on the other hand they are laborious and expensive too. Non PCR-based RNA specific detection methods Loop-mediated isothermal amplification is an excellent, specific and sensitive one step amplification method for detection of pathogens. Its fundamental property is that it does not require any high profile machine for processing like real-time PCR and conventional PCR for amplification. It can amplify even in hot water bath. By adding reverse transcriptase, it can also be applied for the detection of RNA viruses. Generally, four primers were used that recognizes six different sites on target DNA [69] . A specific RT-LAMP method was developed for specific evaluation and subtyping of influenza viruses by [70] . In this method, two sets of forward primer and two sets of inner primers were used in which one set recognizes outer region and the other set recognizes inner region and gives a result with 93.8% specificity. Some researchers also add two extra primers for loop regions that increase its sensitivity and specificity. All primers, DNA polymerase (isolated from Bacillus stearothermophilus), reverse transcriptase (avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV)), template RNA with all buffers are included in a single reaction tube like PCR, but it follows a different amplifying process. Further, strand displacement is considered to be the most important step as it determines the time for completion of the process.
