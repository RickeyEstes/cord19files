Sample preparation. Control viruses were cultured for RNA extraction. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), MERS-CoV, SARSr-CoV, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) samples were cultured in Vero, swine testis (ST), Huh7, Vero E6, and DBT cells, respectively. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Once cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed, 140 l of supernatant was collected for RNA extraction. To analyze clinical samples, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 were extracted from human oral swabs. RNA for BtMiCoV-1r, BtMiCoV-HKU8r, BtHpCoV-HKU10r, BtHpCoV-CHB25, BtScCoV-512r, BtRaCoV-229Er, BtRhCoV-HKU2r, BtPiCoV-HKU5r, and BtTyCoV-HKU4r, which were collected during previous bat CoV surveillance projects, was extracted from bat rectal swabs (11, 23, 24) . To process RNA, 560 l of buffer AVL (Qiagen) was added to the tube containing 140 l swab sample or culture supernatant. Samples were vortexed for 15 s and then centrifuged at 12,000 ϫ g for 10 min to obtain a clear supernatant. Viral nucleic acid was extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. qPCR. For quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis, primers based on the CoV RdRp gene were used (Table S1 in the supplemental material). RNA was reverse transcribed using PrimeScript RT master mix (TaKaRa). The 10-l qPCR mixture contained 5 l 2ϫ SYBR premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa), 0.4 M each primer, and 1 l cDNA. Amplification was performed as follows: 95°C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 30 s and an additional melt step. Preparation of Illumina DNA libraries from RNA. Libraries for NGS were constructed from total RNA using the TruSeq stranded mRNA library preparation kit for Illumina (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 8 l of total RNA was added to first-strand synthesis buffer and random primers before a 4-min incubation at 94°C to generate RNA fragments larger than 300 nucleotides (nt). Following first-and second-strand cDNA synthesis, double-stranded cDNA was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics) and eluted in 20 l nuclease-free H 2 O. To obtain a library size larger than 300 nt, the library was amplified by PCR using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 98°C for 30 s, 10 cycles of denaturation for 10 s at 98°C, annealing for 30 s at 60°C, and extension for 30 s at 72°C, and then a final extension for 5 min at 72°C. Libraries were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics), eluted in 10 l nuclease-free H 2 O, visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel, and quantified using a Bioanalyzer high-sensitivity DNA assay (Agilent). Once prepared, the libraries were divided in two. Half the library was sequenced directly to obtain the unbiased reads, and half was enriched prior to NGS. Enrichment of CoV sequences in libraries. Targeted CoV genome enrichment was achieved using our customized biotinylated 120-mer xGen Lockdown baits (Integrated DNA Technologies) (18) . Prior to capture of viral sequences, 2 l of xGen universal blocker-TS mixture (Integrated DNA Technologies), matched according to the library index, was added to 20 l of library DNA. To block binding of baits to nonviral regions of library fragments, 0.5 l of 5 g Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen) was added. Blocked libraries were ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 2.5 l of nuclease-free H 2 O, 3 l NimbleGen hybridization solution, and 7.5 l NimbleGen 2ϫ hybridization buffer (Roche). Following a 10-min incubation at room temperature, resuspended libraries were denatured at 95°C for 10 min and cooled on ice before the addition of the CoV bait pool. A total of 3 pmol of baits was added and hybridized to the libraries for 4 h at 65°C. To capture virus-specific library fragments, 100 l of Dynabeads M-270 streptavidin magnetic beads (Life Technologies) was added to the hybridization reaction mixture and the mixture was incubated for a further 45 min at 65°C with shaking at 2,000 rpm on a ThermoMixer C shaker (Eppendorf). Streptavidin beads were washed to remove unbound DNA, using the SeqCap EZ hybridization and wash kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A postcapture PCR amplification with P1 and P2 primers (Illumina) was performed using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, 20 cycles of denaturation for 20 s at 95°C, annealing for 20 s at 65°C, and extension for 15 s at 72°C, and then a final extension step for 3 min at 72°C. The enriched library was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics) and eluted in 10 l nuclease-free H 2 O, visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel, and quantified using a Bioanalyzer high-sensitivity DNA assay (Agilent). All samples were subjected to the same library preparation and enrichment. Data analysis. Each unbiased NGS library was run on one HiSeq lane. The 17 enriched libraries were made into two pools (8 or 9 per each) and run on HiSeq lanes. NGS reads were assembled into genomes using the Galaxy platform (25) . PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to fill the genome gaps. All genomes were interrogated for ORFs using ORFfinder (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/). The search parameters were set to ignore nested ORFs and filter out ORFs of less than 150 bp. The standard genetic code and the "ATG only" rule were selected. Each ORF was identified and annotated through BLASTN and BLASTX using the NCBI database. Read mapping or PCR resequencing was used to verify novel ORFs. Read depth was assessed by mapping reads from direct or enriched NGS to their respective genomes using CLC Genomics Workbench version 12.0 (Qiagen). Bait positions were calculated by aligning baits to each genome by BLASTN. The ratio of viral reads to total reads was calculated for each sample. The ORF1b sequences of 38 ICTV reference genomes and 17 CoV genomes from this study were aligned by ClustalW (version 2.1). The phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor-joining method in the maximum-composite-likelihood model in MEGA (version 7.0.18) with nucleotide substitution type and 1,000 bootstrap iterations. The schematic diagrams of CoV genomes, including bait positions and read depths of NGS, were prepared using Circos (version 0.69.8). Graphs displaying the data size and viral read ratios were generated using Prism (GraphPad Prism 7). Data availability. Viral genome data for new CoVs obtained from this study are available in GenBank under accession numbers MN611517 to MN611525.
