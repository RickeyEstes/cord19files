This pilot survey's structure was adapted from high-level isolation unit checklists developed by the European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases 12 but modified and expanded with input from a panel of medical waste subject matter experts. We adapted a similar structure to conduct a survey in the death care sector. 13 In the fall of 2016, this medical waste gap-analysis survey was distributed via Qualtrics Software Version 2016.17 (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) (Institutional Review Board exemption Indiana University Kuali Coeus no. 1607534532). Two surveys were developed-one at the lead-supervisor-management level (lead) and the other at the worker-employee level (worker) and divided into 3 sections: (1) demographics; (2) industry-specific questions on comfortability and willingness to encounter HID scenarios, and current policies and procedures in place to address category A waste; and (3) levels of knowledge, training, resources, and personal protective equipment (PPE) to address HID scenarios. Sections 1 (9 questions) and 3 (6 questions) were identical in the lead and worker pilot surveys, with the only discrepancy being the directive pronoun. Section 2 at the lead level was 63 questions, whereas section 2 at the worker level was only 4 questions because the former asked detailed questions on organizational waste policies and procedures. Survey participants were able to select the link to which survey they felt was more appropriate-worker or lead. The survey predominantly consisted of multiple choice questions, lending the ability to provide qualitative responses where appropriate. Descriptive statistics were deliberately used given this being a pilot survey and the smaller sample size. National medical waste organizations (Stericycle, Inc, Healthcare Waste Institute, Larson-Miller Medical Waste Disposal Service, and Republic Services) requested their waste facilities throughout the nation to disseminate the anonymous Uniform Resource Locator survey links to employees. Two follow-up e-mails were sent to solicit further participation; the survey links were closed after 105 days.
