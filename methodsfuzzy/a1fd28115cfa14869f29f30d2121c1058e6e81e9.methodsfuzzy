Patients-We studied two groups of pa tients by the following methods. The first was a population of 56 industrial employees who had epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. These patients were described in detail elsewhere, 8 but the data concerning their ocular findings were not presented. The second group of 64 patients comprised a heterogeneous population seen during an 18-month period. The only criterion for se lection was follicular conjunctivitis. All but nine patients were seen in the emergency room, clinic, or staff offices at Barnes Hos pital from November 1971 to December 1972. The other nine were followed at the National Eye Institute from July 1970 to June 1971. One of us (H.L.S.K.) saw every patient during the acute or subacute phase of the illness and followed them until signs and symptoms abated. There were 32 males and 32 females, ranging in age from 3 to 77 years old (mean, 31.8 years). Twenty-nine patients were black, 33 were white, and two were orientals. All were ambulatory and in good health. Collection of virus culture specimens-Fifty-eight of the 64 nonepidemic patients had viral cultures. A cotton swab was rolled in the inferior cul-de-sac and transferred to a carrier medium (sodium chloride, potas sium chloride, dipotassium phosphate, char coal, and agar, pH 7.0). The contents of this tube were either stored at -70°C for a short period or immediately transferred to tissue culture tubes of human diploid fibroblast, primary human embryo kidney cell, or human epidermoid carcinoma. Stan dard culture methods have been described previously.* All viruses isolated in this initial attempt were passed and compared to ref erence prototype virus strains for indication of atypicality. The methods for viral culture in the 56 epidemic keratoconjunctivitis patients have been described elsewhere. 3 A single patient was cultured for trachoma inclusion con junctivitis (TRIC) agent by other meth ods. 8 Serologic studies-Of the original 64 study patients, 13 did not return for a convalescent serum. Therefore these serologic results are based on 51 patients. We collected sera dur ing the acute phase and once or twice during the convalescent phase. There were two family groups in which a specimen from one uninf ected member was considered acute and another infected member's specimen was considered convalescent. We took a con valescent specimen from 34 of the 51 pa tients within 30 days of the initial visit; 14 within 60 days; and three patients had speci mens that were separated by more than 60 days. The sera were tested for antibodies to the prototype strains of many respiratory and other viruses in order to survey all of the likely causes of follicular conjunctivitis (Table 1) . Complement-fixation, hemagglutination-inhibition, indirect hemagglutination, or serum neutralization tests were employed as appropriate for each particular virus. The sera were heat-inactivated (56°C, 30 minutes) for all serologic tests. Antibodies to influenza A, B, and C, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, mumps virus "viral antigen," rubeola, respiratory syncytial virus (RS v), coronavirus OC-43 and 229E, herpes simplex 1, varicella, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bedsonia (TRIC agent), cytomegalovirus, and adeno virus group-specific hexon-antigen were as sayed by the standardized complement-fixa tion test with overnight fixation of 5 units of complement. 4 ' 8 Antibodies to influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, 4A, and 4B, Newcastle disease virus, mumps virus, rubeola, coronavirus OC-43, vaccinia, and adenovirus types 1 to 33 were assayed by the standardized hemagglutination-inhibition test with 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline diluent and spectrophotometrically standard ized 0.4% mammalian or 0.5% avian red blood cells. 7 Antibodies to coronavirus 229E were additionally measured by an indirect hemagglutination test. 8 Neutralizing anti bodies to rubeola, RS v, selected adenoviruses, the six coxsackie B viruses, echovirus types 4 and 9, and coxsackievirus A-10 were assayed by serum neutralization tests in human epidermoid carcinoma or monkey kidney tissue culture.' Neutralizing VOL. 80, NO. 4 VIRAL KERATOCONJUNCTIVITIS 663 antibody titers to vaccinia, herpes, coxsackievirus A-9, A-16, and A-21, and four strains of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis virus were similarly assayed by serum neutraliza tion tests in human diploid fibroblast tissue culture. Serum neutralization antibodies in coxsackievirus A-4 and A-7 were assayed in suckling mouse brain. 10 For diagnostic purposes a fourfold titer change (either rise or fall) was consid ered significant for any of the serologic tests. In addition a stable titer of > 1:32 in any serologic test (hemagglutination-inhibition, serum neutralization, or complement-fixa tion) suggested infection with that agent if the clinical course and other serologic tests were confirmatory. When serologic comparisons were carried out, as with the adenovirus groups described below, all of the testing was done in a stan dardized manner. We used only the hemag glutination-inhibition test, with 0.01 M phos phate-buffered saline and standardized mam malian or avian red blood cells, to compare adenovirus types. Antigens for types 1 to 33 were maintained at the Center for Disease Control and were used for similar serologic studies in the past. 7 Other serologic test re sults did not enter into the calculations for significance of titer levels. We tested all sera simultaneously and in duplicate with the same cell lots whenever possible so that test ing conditions and results would be equiv alent. Clinical examinations-Those patients who had epidemic keratoconjunctivitis 8 were ex amined during the initial phase of their ill ness and approximately one month after res olution of all symptoms. Visual acuity was re corded and, by slit-lamp microscopy, we made a determination of presence or absence of subepithelial infiltrates. There was no at tempt to quantitate these or to judge sever ity. The patients in the nonepidemic group were treated in a different manner. All pa tients were seen at least twice for evaluation of subjective and objective evidence of ocu lar illness. During each examination, we at tempted to document severity of symptoms, visual acuity, the presence of pre-auricular nodes (or other adenopathy), and the appear ance of the conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior chamber by slit-lamp microscopy. Detailed drawings of the cornea were made in keratitis cases, but the exact number of lesions was not recorded. Instead, we attempted to depict accurately the areas of cornea in volved for future evaluation. Each patient was followed until keratitis showed signs of stability or actual regression. When possible, those patients with persistent lesions were followed for a longer time period. At the end of the study period, all of the drawings were re-examined. For each pa tient we estimated the percentage of cornea involved with infiltrates during the peak phase of the illness. We assigned values be fore the serologic data were available. When all of the serologies were complete, the adeno virus groups were investigated separately. We calculated the severity of keratitis vs. sero logic titer by hemagglutination-inhibition test values and the percentage of corneal involve ment arrived at previously. Therapeutic regimen-Almost all of the patients were treated with topical antibiotics, compresses, or astringents. Two of the pa tients in the adenovirus group received « corticosteroids after cessation of the acute phase and when visual acuity decreased. Pa tients in the herpes group were given various antiviral preparations. Although these were generally effective in controlling the acute disease, we did not attempt statistical corre lations to determine efficacy. Ancillary studies-We took swabs for rou tine bacterial cultures in 26 nonepidemic pa tients simultaneously with the viral cultures. Although most of these were taken at ran dom, occasionally patients presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of bacterial conjunctivitis complicating the viral illness; these patients were cultured specifically to identify possible infectious agents. In addi tion, conjunctival scrapings were examined 664 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY OCTOBER, 197S in 27 patients. These were processed with Giemsa or Gram stains, or both. Tear studies-Tears were collected from ten patients with acute and chronic, nonepidemic viral infections or chronic noninfectious conjunctivitis. The details for collect ing, processing, and quantitating immunoglobulins in tears have been described pre viously. 11 ' 12 The viral serologic studies on the tear specimens were similar to those done on the sera from these individuals, but the tear specimens were not heat-inactivated and were diluted starting at 1:2 instead of 1:8. (Other studies involving the epidemic keratoconjunctivitis group have been de scribed previously. 8 )
