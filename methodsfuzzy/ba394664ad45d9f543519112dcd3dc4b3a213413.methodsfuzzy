Sampling, extraction of RNA and RT-qPCR A nostril specimen was collected from a calf naturally exposed to BCoV during a transmission study [12] . Briefly, a flocked eSwab™ (Copan Diagnostics, CA, USA) was swept inside the calf's nostril and kept frozen in 1 ml transport medium at -80˚C until analysis. The specimen was thawed on ice and the swab medium centrifuged at 9700 x g for 10 min. Two technical replicates were processed individually until library preparation and NGS. The supernatant (140 μl) was treated with 2.8 μg RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) and 6 Units Turbo DNase (Ambion, MA, USA) for 30 min at 37˚C. Thereafter RNA was extracted with QIAzol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and chloroform phase separation. The RNA containing aqueous phase was mixed with 70% ethanol (1:1) and added to an RNeasy Mini Kit column (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer. The RNA concentration (3-5 ng/μl) and purity were measured by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, DE, USA) and the RNA was kept at -80˚C until further use. Estimation of the BCoV copy number (4,1 x 10 5 genome copies used) was done with RT-qPCR using primers and probe as described by Decaro and colleagues [13] . A tenfold dilution series of a plasmid containing the BCoV amplicon was used as a quantification standard. Quantification of a bovine rhinitis virus (700 genome copies used) that was incidentally found in the nasal sample, was performed in an identical way after establishing a rhinitis virus RT-qPCR and production of a plasmid containing the rhinitis virus target. SISPA-Sequence independent single primer amplification (sample S1 and S2) A variant of the SISPA protocol was followed [14] . Ten μl RNA was reverse transcribed and tagged using 10 μM primer FRoV26-N (GCC GGA GCT CTG CAG ATA TCN NNN NN) [15] and Superscript III (Invitrogen, MA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Second strand was made by adding 0.5 μl of Klenow fragment (3' -> 5' exo-) (New England Biolabs, England) to the cDNA and incubation at 37˚C for 60 min and 75˚C for 10 min. Double stranded (ds) DNA was kept at -20˚C prior to PCR amplification. Three aliquots of 6 μl tagged dsDNA were amplified using 0.8 μM of primer FR20 (GCC GGA GCT CTG CAG ATA TC), 1 U KOD DNA polymerase (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), 1 mM MgCl 2 and 0.2 mM dNTP. The amplification steps were 95˚C for 20 s followed by 30 cycles at 95˚C for 30 s, 58˚C for 30 s, 72˚C for 90 s and completed at 72˚C for 10 min. The PCR products were purified with the NucleoSpin 1 Gel and PCR clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), according to the manufacturer's protocol for products in solution, and eluted in 45 μl buffer. Primer sequences were cleaved off using 30 U EcoRV (Promega, WI, USA) and incubation at 37˚C for 60 min, before pooling of aliquots and purification using NucleoSpin 1 Gel and PCR clean up kit with a final elution volume of 65 μl. The DNA concentration was measured using Nanodrop (50-52 ng/μl).
