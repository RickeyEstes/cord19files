This study was carried out in the Campania region, Southern Italy, during 2008-2009, using samples taken from 248 water buffalo calves bred in 58 different farms. The animals were aged between 1-12 weeks old and were all affected by gastroenteritis with lethal outcome. During necropsy, the intestinal lesions were evaluated and the intestinal content of the involved sections was collected and tested for the presence of Salmonella spp. In addition, the presence of E. coli, Eimeria spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., Coronavirus, Rotavirus, and C. perfringens were also determined to investigate their association with Salmonella spp. The isolation of Salmonella spp. was performed according to ISO 6579:2002 [21] . The isolated Salmonella spp. were serotyped according to the Kaufmann-White scheme [22] . Phage-typing of the isolated S. Typhimurium strains was performed by the Italian National Reference Centre for Salmonellosis (Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie). The presence of Rotavirus and Coronavirus was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification [23, 24] . Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. antigens were detected by chromatographic immunoassay (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK). The presence of Eimeria spp. was examined by flotation technique using saturated saline [25] . E. coli and C. perfringens were isolated according to the protocol reported by Quinn et al. [2] . E. coli hemolytic activity was evaluated by growing colonies on blood agar base, while virulence factors (lt-heat-labile toxin, st-heatstable toxin, stx1-Shiga toxin 1, stx2-Shiga-toxin 2, eaeintimin, cnf-cytotoxic necrotizing factor, and cdt-cytolethal distending toxin) were detected by molecular assays, as previously reported [26] [27] [28] .
