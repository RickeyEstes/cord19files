Virus, cells, and medium. ANDV strain Chile-9717869 (30) was propagated in Vero E6 cells (Vero C1008, ATCC CRL 1586). The preparation of twice-plaque-purified ANDV stock has been described previously (30) . Cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium with Earle's salts containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1ϫ penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), and gentamicin sulfate (50 g/ml) at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. Challenge with hantavirus. Female Syrian hamsters 6 to 8 weeks of age (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were anesthetized by inhalation of vaporized isoflurane using an IMPAC 6 veterinary anesthesia machine. For i.m. challenges, anesthetized hamsters were injected with 80 PFU (10 50% lethal doses [LD 50 ]) of virus diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.2 ml, caudal thigh) delivered with a 1-ml syringe with a 25-gauge, fiveeighths-inch needle. For i.n. challenges, anesthetized hamsters were administered 50 l delivered as 25 l per naris with a plastic pipette tip (total amount of ANDV, 4,000 PFU; 42 LD 50 ). Groups of 8 hamsters were typically used for experimental treatments, unless otherwise stated. All work involving hamsters was performed in an animal biosafety level 4 (ABSL-4) laboratory. Hamsters were observed two to three times daily. Euthanasia was performed on animals meeting early endpoint criteria. Macrophage depletion. Clodronate-encapsulated liposomes (5 mg/ml clodronate; Clodrosome) (referred to here as liposomal clodronate) and control PBS-encapsulated liposomes (Encapsome) (referred to here as control liposome) were purchased from Encapsula Nano Sciences. Hamsters were anesthetized using 0.2 ml/100 g of body weight rat KAX (ketamine-acepromazin-xylazine) administered by i.m. injection. Each animal was then placed in a dorsal recumbent position, and an otoscope (Welch Allyn) was used to visualize the vocal folds. The vocal folds were numbed by topically administering a 2% lidocaine HCl jelly (Akorn), and then a 16-gauge 1.25-in Surflo catheter (Terumo) was passed between the vocal folds. Hamsters were then treated with either 0.2 ml liposomal clodronate or 0.2 ml control liposome by attaching a loaded syringe to the catheter and aspirating the contents into the lung. Flow cytometry analysis. Hamsters were deeply anesthetized (0.4 ml Rat KAX/100 g) and then extensively perfused with sterile saline (Baxter) before being euthanized. To isolate alveolar macrophages, animals were placed in a dorsal recumbent position, and then a midline neck incision was made and downward dissection was performed carefully so that the trachea was exposed. A second incision was made near the xyphoid process, and scissors were used to remove the rib cage and expose the lungs. Care was taken to ensure the lungs were not damaged. A 16-gauge 1.25-in catheter was inserted into the trachea, and the lungs were lavaged 3 times using 1 ml of a 0.02% EDTA solution. BAL samples were then centrifuged at 514 ϫ g for 5 min. Cells were then collected and washed twice in PBS containing 2% FBS. In some experiments, cells were incubated at 4°C for 15 min in a blocking buffer consisting of PBS containing 2% FBS and 2% normal rat serum (Sigma-Aldrich) prior to staining with antibody. Approximately 10 6 cells were stained with mouse-anti-hamster MARCO (32) (clone PAL-1; 10 g/100 l; AbD Serotec) followed by anti-mouse IgM (clone RMM-1; 0.4 g/ml; BioLegend) for 15 to 20 min at 4°C. Stained cells were then fixed in Cytofix buffer (BD Biosciences) for 15 min at 4°C before being analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences) or FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using FACsDiva software (BD Biosciences). AM and neutrophil cell numbers in BAL fluid preparations were mathematically determined by comparing cell numbers to numbers of PKH26 reference microbeads (Sigma) using the following formula: N cells/ml ϭ (N cell events ϫ dilution factor/N bead events ϫ dilution factor) ϫ N beads/ml , where N cells/ml is the number of cells per milliliter, N cell events is the number of cell events, N beads/ml is the number of beads per milliliter, and N bead events is the number of bead events. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar). Plaque assay. Hantavirus plaque assays were performed as previously described (33) . Isolation of RNA and real-time PCR. Approximately 250 mg of lung tissue was homogenized in 1.0 ml TRIzol reagent using gentleMACS M tubes and a gentleMACS dissociator on the RNA setting. RNA was extracted from TRIzol samples as recommended by the manufacturer. The concentration of the extracted RNA was determined using a NanoDrop 8000 instrument and raised to a final concentration of 10 ng/l. Real-time PCR was conducted on a Bio-Rad CFX thermal cycler using an Invitrogen Power SYBR green RNA-to-C T one-step kit according to the manufacturer's protocols. Primer sequences are as follows (26) : ANDV S 41F, 5=-GAA TGA GCA CCC TCC AAG AAT TG-3=; ANDV S 107R, 5=-CGA GCA GTC ACG AGC TGT TG-3=. Cycling conditions were 30 min at 48°C, 10 min at 95°C, and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. Data acquisition occurred following the annealing step. Hamster cytokine ELISAs. Anti-hamster MIP-1␣ (MBS033532), MIP-2 (MBS006761), TNF-␣ (MBS046042), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) (MBS024541) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were purchased from MyBioSource and were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Preparation of tissues for histology. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, trimmed, processed, embedded in paraffin, cut at 5 to 6 m, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histopathology analysis. To determine the presence of ANDV antigens in association with alveolar macrophages or colocalized with endothelial cells, serial sections were then stained as follows. For ANDV immunohistochemistry, a monoclonal antibody (USAMRIID number 1244) against ANDES virus was used on all tissue slides. Normal mouse IgG was used as the negative serum control for the control slides. Briefly, the unstained sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and pretreated with Tris-EDTA buffer for 30 min at 95 to 100°C. Slides were rinsed, and a serum-free protein block with 5% horse serum was applied for 30 min. The monoclonal antibody was then applied to the tissue at a dilution of 1:1,200 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were then treated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary mouse IgG antibody (catalog number MP-5402; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min at room temperature. All slides were exposed to ImmPACT Vector Red (catalog number SK-5105; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) substrate-chromogen for 30 min, rinsed, counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and coverslipped with Permount (catalog number SP15-500; Fisher). For CD31 immunohistochemistry, an immunoperoxidase assay was performed using a rabbit anti-CD31 polyclonal antibody (catalog number ab28364; Abcam). A normal rabbit IgG was used as the negative serum control for the control slides. Briefly, the unstained sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, subjected to a methanol hydrogen peroxide block, rinsed, and pretreated with Tris-EDTA buffer for 30 min at 95 to 100°C. Slides were rinsed, and a serum-free protein block with 5% goat serum was applied for 30 min. The polyclonal antibody was then applied to the tissue at a dilution of 1:75 and incubated overnight at room temperature. The slides were then treated with the EnVision horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (catalog number K4007; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) for 30 min at room temperature. All sections were exposed to a DAB (3,3-diaminobenzidine) substrate-chromogen for 5 min, rinsed, counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and coverslipped with Permount. Statistical analysis. Survival curves were compared with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log rank comparisons and Dunnett's correction. Comparisons of viral genome, infectious virus, alveolar macrophage, and neutrophil percentages and numbers and ELISA cytokine titers were done using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's multiple-comparison test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. Analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism (version 5).
