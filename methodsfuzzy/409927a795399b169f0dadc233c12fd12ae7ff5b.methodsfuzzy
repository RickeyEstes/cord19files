This has been the most commonly used IEM method for viewing virus immune complexes prepared from tissue culture isolates or clinical specimens. The recommendation of Almeida and Waterson (7) involves the interaction of equal volumes of concentrated antigen with dilutions of antiserum (undiluted, 1:10, 100) at 37°C for I hour; the solution is then left overnight at 4°C. The immune complexes are centrifuged the following morning. The pellet is resuspended in a small volume of distilled water, then stained with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) on a grid before viewing. Although the EM is being used near the limit of practical resolution in these studies, basic phenomena concerning antibody structure and function have been reported. Using ferritin (20) or dinitrophenylpolymethylenediamine (DNP) (49) as antigens, the dimer structure of immunoglobulin G (IgG) was confirmed with the two Fab portions in the form of a "V" and the Fc fraction forming the leg of a "Y" There are many studies describing the morphology of IgM, but few deal with conformational changes during binding (25) . IgM molecules have been visualized in the EM by employing erythrocyte membrane fragments (7), bacterial flagella (21) or foot and mouth disease virus (2) as antigens. They appear as long (~ 350 A), flexible, looping molecules in the shape of a fivepointed star with 10 proposed binding sites (7 space, and Golgi apparatus of human lymphoid cells from a variety of sources (39) . Direct IEM methodology has been used to study basic morphology of several viruses that present a problem with ordinary conventional EM. Antibody attachment to rubella virus .allows its separation from contaminating debris of equal size and density and a morphological definition of the periphery of the virus particles (13) . Similarly, IEM has enabled basic observations on the morphology of rhinoviruses (30) and polyoma and wart viruses (4) . IEM has also contributed to our knowledge of diseases caused by viruses that have been difficult or impossible to cultivate in vitro. During an outbreak of nonbacterial gastroenteritis (NBG) in Norwalk, Ohio in 1971, Kapikian and coworkers reacted stool filtrate with convalescent serum from a diseased volunteer and observed 27-nm particles in aggregates surrounded by clumped antibodies (28) . Subsequently, it was found that certain individuals with NBG develop serologic evidence of infection detectable by IEM. IEM methods were also used to demonstrate experimental infection (46), and further outbreaks of human disease were identified by related agents from Hawaii and Maryland (47). Several other agents resembling the Norwalk virus in morphology have been identified, and their relationship to the Norwalk group has been studied by IEM. Brandt and coworkers (14) have recently compared direct EM, IEM, and enzyme immunoassay for the detection of viruses in feces and rectal swabs. Used with commercial gamma globulin, IEM had a distinct advantage with all viruses detected in rectal swabs and small 27-nm particles in feces, but added little to increase the number of rotaviruses or adenoviruses viewed in stool. The relationship between hepatitis A virus (27-nm particles) and infectious, non-B viral hepatitis was uncovered using similar IEM techniques (31) . Coproantibodies A and M to hepatitis A virus, a~ well as the virus itself, have been detected in the feces of a small percentage of patients within 10 days of clinical hepatitis (36) . The morphologies of hepatitis B virus and its markers (5) and rotavirus (22) have been studied using similar methods. Coronaviruses (29) have been rescued from cell or organ cultures and viewed under the EM by forming immune complexes with serum from patients convalescing from respiratory disease. The direct IEM technique has also been used for serotyping within major virus groups, including the papovaviruses (23, 42), picornaviruses (8, 15, 27, 43) and adenoviruses (50, 51). Almeida et al. (1) recently introduced a direct IEM method that adds prepared virus to EM-negative material before the addition of virus-specific antiserum. Mixed immune aggregates (MIA) of rotavirus and of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were observed when tested on a low molecular weight subunit of rotavirus and a micellar form of HBsAg, respectively. Thus, these MIAs demonstrated that the unknown components had antigens in common with the established virus or antigen. Although IEM direct methodology had been used extensively for the serologic diagnosis of viral diseases such as hepatitis A and Norwalk virus gastroenteritis, it has, for technical reasons, been replaced by hemagglutination and radio-or enzyme-immunoassays (31). Using a technique similar to methods for fluorescent antibody studies, some workers have employed a second antispecies antibody, with or without a label, to enhance the appearance of virusantibody complexes formed in the direct IEM method. The procedure as described for adeuovirus identification (50) from cell ~ulture harvest or clinical speci~hens involves the incubation of an optimal concentration of rabbit antihuman IgG and the adenovirus immune complexes in equal volumes at 6°C overnight. Using these procedures, these workers demonstrated enhanced viewing of virus particles and greater sensitivity than by the direct method. Ferritin-labelled antispecies antibodies have been used in the indirect method for the demonstration of antibodyattachment to influenzavirus (41) and hepatitis B core antigen (26) . A rapid indirect noncentrifugation ferritin method for the identification of rotaviruses, adenoviruses, and Coxsackie virus B-5 has recently been described (12) . Anderson and Doane described this modification of the AGD technique and used it to serotype enteroviruses by incorporating the antisera into the agar (8). Dilutions of single or pooled reference sera were added to a cool molten solution of 1070 agar in microtiter plate wells. Formvar-carbon-coated grids were placed on the surface of the agar, and the viral specimens (1 or 2 microdrops) were added and allowed to dry. Homologous antibodies rapidly diffuse from the agar to the specimen, and immune complexes are easily seen in the EM after negative staining. These authors have reported the SIA-IEM method to be as sensitive as the direct method and have used it to type other viral groups. Berthiaume et al., using commercially available pools of human gamma globulins, instead of virusspecific antisera, detected several gastroenteric viruses in clarified feces and cell culture supernatant fluids (ll). Rotaviruses, adenoviruses, astroviruses, picornaviruses, parvoviruses, and coronaviruses were detected. In this study the specimen was dropped onto the agar surface and then picked up on an inverted grid similar to the AGD method. Using these techniques, Trepanier et al. made a comparison of direct EM with direct gamma globulin SIA and indirect ferritin IEM techniques on feces samples submitted to a diagnostic laboratory (48). These two approaches enumerated 25 and 103 more rotaviruses per grid square, respectively, as compared to the direct EM technique. Similarly, Lamontagne and coworkers (35) found specific IEM 100 times more sensitive for detecting rotaviruses and adenoviruses and up to 10 times more sensitive for bovine herpes virus.
