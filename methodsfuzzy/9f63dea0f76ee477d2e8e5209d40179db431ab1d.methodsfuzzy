Sources of data. We recruited kindergartens, primary and secondary schools in February-May, 2015 and September 2015-January 2016, covering the major peak HFMD seasons in Hong Kong. We recruited all students from the classes which reported HFMD cases. Classes with â‰¥2 HFMD cases were selected for the present analysis of incubation periods. We distributed questionnaires to the parents or legal guardians of the participated students to collect demographic and epidemiological information. We also collected key information related to disease transmission and progression of HFMD, such as dates of symptom onset (specifically for fever, oral ulcer and rash), dates of sick absence, and potential epidemiological link to other HFMD cases in household. Incentives were provided for the HFMD cases who provided more detailed information. We also collected attendance records from the schools, stratified by HFMD cases and non-cases to assess data completeness. Ethics approval. Written informed consent was provided by all participating schools. Proxy written consent from parents or legal guardians were obtained for the students. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster and was performed in accordance to relevant guidelines. Statistical analysis. We fitted parametric distributions to the time from infection to the earliest symptom onset of fever, oral ulcer or rash 16 . The exact infection times were not observable but the exposure windows were defined from the symptom onset to the day before sick absence, assuming HFMD cases were infectious only after symptom onset 17 . All potential infectors in the same class were included to construct the exposure windows, assuming limited transmission between different classes. Cases with missing illness onset or absence date, along with subsequent cases in the same class were excluded from the analysis. In other words, only transmissions with complete observation of exposure windows were included in the analysis. Students with earlier HFMD cases in their households were assumed to be infected outside schools, and were included in the analysis only for the exposure to subsequent cases. We also accounted for weekends and school holidays during which there were no exposure in schools. We used maximum likelihood to fit gamma, Weibull and log-normal distributions to the potential incubation intervals and selected the best models using Akaike information criterion (AIC). We estimated the median incubation period for children in kindergartens (aged about 2-5 years), primary (aged about 6-11 years) and secondary schools (aged about 12-18 years) respectively and computed the relevant 95% confidence interval (CI) by the parametric bootstrap approach using 1000 replicates. The 95% percentile of the incubation period was then calculated from the fitted distribution 16 . Further details of the statistical analyses are described in the Supplementary Information.
