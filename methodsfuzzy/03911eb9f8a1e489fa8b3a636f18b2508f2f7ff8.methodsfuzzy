2.1. Protozoan strain and culture conditions C. anatis infected intestinal tracts were procured from turkeys in North Carolina that were negative for Coronavirus antibodies based on indirect fluorescent antibody testing (Patel and Gonder, 1977) . The parasite was identified based on the presence of an anterior adhesive disk, four anterior flagella, one dorsal flagellum, one recurrent flagellum and its characteristic motility pattern (Bermudez, 2003) . At the University of Missouri, the protozoa were maintained by inoculating 20 1-week-old poults with an intestinal inoculum prepared from a euthanized colony of 3-week-old C. anatis infected poults. This procedure resulted in the passage of the inoculum in poults every 2 weeks. Intestinal inoculums from the infected poults were transported to the University of Arkansas where successive passages were continued every 2 weeks. Poults utilized at both university laboratories were acquired from a commercial hatchery where breeder flocks were monitored by the National Poultry Improvement plan and were negative for Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synovia and Mycoplasma meleagridis. One-day-old female poults were brooded in stainless steel heated batteries in an environmentally controlled animal housing facility. The poults were given feed and water ad libitum. The University of Arkansas and the University of Missouri Animal Care and Use committees approved all animal use protocols.
