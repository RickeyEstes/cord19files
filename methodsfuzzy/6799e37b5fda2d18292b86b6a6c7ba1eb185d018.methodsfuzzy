Biological materials. The A431 human epithelial carcinoma cell line stably expressing AnxA6 (A431-AnxA6; provided by T. Grewal, Sydney) has been described previously (40) . The A431 wild-type cells (A431-WT; provided by T. Grewal, Sydney), the A431-AnxA6 cells, and the A549 human alveolar epithelial cell line (provided by S. Ludwig, Muenster) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCKII) cells (provided by S. Ludwig, Muenster) were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM). Cell culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Merck catalog no. S0615), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. For IFN pretreatment, cells were exposed to 10 ng/ml IFN-␤ (recombinant human interferon beta; ImmunoTools catalog no. 11343524) for 16 h. Transient transfection of plasmids and siRNA. A549 and A431 cell lines were transfected with plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. pCMV-myc-hIFITM3 was kindly provided by Jacob Yount (Addgene plasmid number 58461). Human AnxA6 was expressed from the plasmid pEGFP-N1 (41), and murine NPC1 was expressed from the plasmid pEYFP-N2 (42) . pEGFP-N3 served as a control. Kühnl et al. ® CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. IFITM3 was knocked out in A549 cells through the use of gene editing plasmids from Santa Cruz. The IFITM3-specific CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid was cotransfected with the IFTM3-specific HDR plasmid, and KO cells were positively selected in puromycin-containing (2 g/ml) selection medium. Basal IFITM3 expression and IFN-induced IFITM3 expression in WT and IFTM3KO cells were compared by Western blotting using an anti-IFITM3 antibody (Proteintech catalog no. 11714-1-AP). To verify that IFN signaling was not affected in the IFITM3 KO cells, IFN-mediated STAT1 induction (43) was monitored by Western blotting (Cell Signaling catalog no. 9172). Detection of GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) (Santa Cruz catalog no. sc-25778) served as a control to confirm equal levels of protein loading. siRNA against human IFITM3 (SMART pool siGENOME, human IFITM3 siRNA M-014116-01; GE Dharmacon) was used for knockdown of IFITM3 protein expression in A431-WT and A431-AnxA6 cells, and nontargeting siRNA (ON-Target plus siControl; GE Dharmacon) served as a negative control. IAV infection. H1N1 IAV strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8M) was obtained from the virus strain collection of the Institute of Virology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany, and H3N2 IAV strain X31 was provided by Thorsten Wolff, Robert Koch Institut, Berlin, Germany. Both IAV strains were propagated in MDCKII cells. For infection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and exposed to the indicated multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of virus diluted in PBS with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma catalog no. A7979), 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.9 mM CaCl 2 , 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (PBS-BSA) at 37°C or on ice. If not otherwise indicated, the inoculum was aspirated after 30 min. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated in DMEM with 0.2% BSA, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (DMEM-BA) for the respective periods of time. ; 1:100 in 2% BSA) for 1 h after filipin staining. Confocal microscopy was performed using an LSM 780 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Jena, Germany) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63ϫ/1.4 oil immersion objective. z-stacks of individual cells were subjected to threshold processing, and Manders' colocalization coefficients of the respective endosomal/lysosomal marker with filipin signal were analyzed using the ImageJ plugin Jacop (44) . Additionally, the numbers of voxels that were positive for both filipin and LysoTracker (or for filipin and CD63) were related to the total number of LysoTracker-positive (or CD63-positive) voxels, regardless of the intensity of the filipin or LysoTracker/CD63 signal strength. To generate the heat map presentations of filipin stainings, the different filipin pixel intensities were color-coded according to the gradient presented in a color look-up table (LUT), with the gradient of colors ranging from blue (lowest intensity) to white (highest intensity). To analyze the clustering of acidic endosomes, the grayscale images were processed in a binary manner by replacing LysoTracker intensity values above the globally determined threshold with a value of 1 and setting all other values to 0. With the help of the ImageJ plugin collection "BioVoxxel Toolbox," the resulting binary images were then used to determine the number of neighbors of each endosome in the individual cells, and the data were expressed as frequency distributions of at least 5 cells per condition. Cell lysis and Western blotting. For protein sample preparation, cells were washed in PBS, harvested in 8 M urea, and subjected to sonication. The protein concentration in the lysates was determined by the Bradford method. The primary antibodies used for detection of the respective proteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were anti-annexin VI antibody (N-19; Santa Cruz catalog no. sc-1931), anti-GAPDH antibody (FL-335; Santa Cruz catalog no. sc-25778), anti-IFITM3 antibody (Proteintech; 11714-1-AP), anti-IFITM2/3 antibody (Proteintech; 66081-1-Ig), anti-influenza M1 antibody (clone GA2B; AbD Serotec [MCA401]), and anti-␣-tubulin antibody (clone B-5-1-2; Sigma catalog no. T5168). IRDye secondary antibodies (Li-COR) labeled with near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dyes were used for direct, nonenzymatic detection of primary antibodies coupled with IRDye 680CW and IRDye 800CW for donkey anti-mouse IgG (HϩL), donkey anti-rabbit IgG (HϩL), and donkey anti-goat IgG (HϩL). An Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-COR) was used for NIR fluorescence detection. Western blots were quantified using Odyssey infrared imaging system software version 3.0.25. Single-cycle infection analysis. Cells were pretreated as indicated in the respective figure legends, seeded on covers slips 1 day prior to infection, and infected with PR8M by a standard procedure as described above. At 4 h p.i., cells were fixed (4% PFA-PBS ϩϩ for 10 min), permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100 -PBS ϩϩ for 30 min), and blocked (2% BSA-PBS ϩϩ , overnight, 4°C). Staining with anti-NP antibody (mouse anti-influenza A virus nucleoprotein, clone AA5H; AbD Serotec [MCA400]) for 2 h and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (donkey anti-mouse IgG [HϩL] secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 594; Invitrogen catalog no. A21203) for 1 h with DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Sigma) was done using 2% BSA. Transfected cells were identified by confocal microscopy using an LSM 800 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Jena, Germany) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63ϫ/1.4 oil immersion objective and were categorized for the presence or absence of distinct IAV NP signal. Acidic bypass. The applied assay was established previously by Stauffer et al. (23) . Prior to infection, cells were preincubated with bafilomycin A1 (Cayman catalog no. cay-11038) (250 nM). Virus (PR8M) was primed for 1 h at 37°C with DMEM adjusted to pH 5.8 with MES (morpholineethanesulfonic acid) (30 mM). Cells were infected at an MOI of 50 with primed virus for 1 h on ice and subsequently washed twice with
