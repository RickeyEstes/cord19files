Generation of L1 Homology Models. L1 homology models were created from the L1 amino acid sequences of L1L2 PsV representing HPV16, HPV31, HPV33, HPV35, HPV52 and HPV58 (sequences available from http://home.ccr.cancer.gov/LCO/packaging.htm) using SWISS MODEL (http://swissmodel.expasy. org/) 56, 57 . The crystal structure of the HPV16 L1 capsomer (PDB code: 2R5H) 41 was used as the template to which the target L1 amino acid sequences of the Alpha-9 PsV were modelled. The quality of a predictive model is measured by the GMQE score which ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the expected accuracy of the resulting model, with a score of 1 indicating the highest level of quality estimation reliability 58 . L1 Modelling. DeepView Swiss-Pdb viewer v4.0 59 was used to perform pairwise L1 model comparisons by superimposition and predicted structural differences between models were measured in Å. The superimposition of L1 homology models was supported by a RMS value, which represents the average Å distance between corresponding atoms in the two models. The lower the RMS value the closer two models are related, with a model compared to itself generating an RMS value of 0 59 . The crystal structure of the HPV35 L1 capsomer (PDB code: 2R5J) 41 was used as a pairwise comparison control for the HPV35 L1 homology model. The DeepView programme was additionally used to model the positions of amino acid residues of interest on to the L1 homology models. L1L2 PsV. The L1 genes with HPV31 or HPV35 backbones and reciprocal inter-genotype loop swaps were synthesised by GeneArt ® (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and were applicable site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). L1 genes were subcloned into the p31sheLL or p35sheLL plasmids in conjunction with the Rapid DNA Dephos & Ligation kit (Roche). HPV31, HPV35 and chimeric L1L2 PsV carrying a luciferase reporter were expressed and purified as previously described 33 . Particle formation and size were determined by electron microscopic analysis of negatively stained particles. Ten PsV particles were measured in nanometres (nm) from each preparation and the median diameter and inter-quartile range calculated (Fig. 2b) . The equivalent of a 50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID 50 ) was estimated for each PsV preparation using the Spearman-Karber equations and a standardised input of 300 TCID 50 was used for all PsV 33 . The L1 concentrations of PsV stocks were estimated by semiquantitative L1 Western blot analysis using CamVir-1 antibody (Abcam, United Kingdom). Particle-to-infectivity ratios were determined on the basis of an estimated particle amount of 3 × 10 7 particles per ng L1 protein (http://home.ccr.cancer.gov/lco/production.asp), with the ratio being normalized for the input volume and the TCID 50 Gardasil ® n = 17) taken 1 month after receiving the final dose, were selected for analysis based upon HPV31 cross-neutralisation antibody titres 23 . L1L2 PsV Neutralisation Assay. Samples were subjected to 5 serial dilutions, with the antibody titre resulting in an 80% reduction in the luciferase signal produced by control wells containing PsV and cells only estimated by interpolation. HPV antibody control reagents were included in each assay run 60 alongside heparin (H-4784; Sigma-Aldrich) which was used as a positive inhibitor control: Median heparin concentration (μ g/mL) against PsV HPV31 5.5 (IQR, 3.8 to 6.7; n = 6) and HPV35 3.1 (IQR, 2.5 to 3.3; n = 6); Median neutralisation titres of the positive antibody control reagent (high titre HPV16/18) against PsV HPV31 389 (IQR, 333 to 427; n = 12) and HPV35 46 (IQR, 42 to 53; n = 12). The negative antibody control reagent (HPV negative) had a titre of < 40 in all assays (n = 24). Statistical analysis. The Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test was used for the comparison of cross-neutralising antibody titres between different L1L2 PsV targets. The test was performed using the statistical package, Stata 12.1 (StataCorp LP).
