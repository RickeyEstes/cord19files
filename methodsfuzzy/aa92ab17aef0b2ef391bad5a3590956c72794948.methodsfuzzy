We used a convolution-based method for obtaining real-time estimates of IHP and IAR from serial cross-sectional serologic data and hospitalization data. The same method has been used to estimate incidence of pdmH1N1 in England [9, 10] . A schematic of this method is shown in Figure 1 . The method requires knowing (1) the cumulative distribution function of the time from illness onset to hospitalization F Hosp , (2) the cumulative distribution function of time from illness onset to seropositivity F Seropos , and (3) the proportion of infections that eventually became seropositive, h. In principle, all these should be directly observable from pandemic surveillance. The basic algorithm of this method was as follows. At any time t during the epidemic: (1) Use F Hosp to deconvolute daily hospitalizations h 0 ,…,h t to obtain an unscaled incidence (daily number of infections) curve a 0 ,…,a t [17] . If IHP is known, the true incidence curve is estimated by dividing a 0 ,…,a t by IHP. This step can be skipped if the actual onset dates of hospitalized cases are known. (2) Use F Seropos to construct an estimated seroprevalence curve b 0 ,…,b t from the unscaled incidence curve a 0 ,…,a t : where P 0 is the true pre-pandemic seroprevalence. (3) Fit the estimated seroprevalence curve b 0 ,…,b t to the serial cross-sectional serologic data by finding the values of IHP and P 0 that maximize the following likelihood function: where the product is over all times t i #t for which cross-sectional serologic data are available, with each component being the (binomial) probability of getting x t i seropositives from testing n t i samples collected at time t i if the true seroprevalence was b t i . IAR can then be estimated by dividing the unscaled incidence curve by our maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of IHP. In this basic algorithm, sensitivity and specificity of serologic testing were assumed to be 100%. The method can be extended to incorporate imperfect sensitivity and specificity, temporal variation in IHP (e.g., weekend and seasonal effects) and different titer cutoffs for seropositivity. See Text S1 for the generalized algorithm that takes into account these factors. Note that sensitivity (specificity) here referred to the probability that the result of the serologic test was positive (negative) if the serum specimen was truly seropositive (seronegative), regardless of whether seropositivity was due to pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies or antibodies generated by recent pandemic infection. Therefore, our definitions of sensitivity and specificity were different from that in recent Step 3: Statistical inference of IHP True seroprevalence = Pre-existing seroprevalence + Find the best value of IHP and pre-existing seroprevalence that fit seroprevalence curve to serial cross-sectional serologic data using maximum likelihood. Divide unscaled incidence by the estimated IHP to obtain incidence. unscaled seroprevalence IHP related publications on the performance of pdmH1N1 serologic assays in which sensitivity was defined as the probability of a positive serologic result among infected individuals and specificity the probability of a negative serologic result among uninfected individuals [14, 18] .
