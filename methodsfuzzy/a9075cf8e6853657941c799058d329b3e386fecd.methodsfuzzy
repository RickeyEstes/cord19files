If the sequence similarity of a part of the viral target genomes to sequences in the databases is low, it is sometimes still possible to apply remote homology detection methods (Kuchibhatla et al., 2014) , such as PSI-BLAST and HMMER3 (Altschul, 1997; Finn et al., 2011) and profile-profile comparison (HHpred Kuchibhatla et al., 2014) , HHblits (Remmert et al., 2012) , FFAS (Jaroszewski et al., 2011) , WebPRC (Brandt and Heringa, 2009 ). To apply remote homology detection it is necessary that the viral family of the target genome was identified, for example by the identification of a highly conserved stretch, and that sequence profiles of this families are present in the respective databases [e.g., in pFAM (Finn et al., 2014) or Uniprot (Magrane and Consortium, 2011)] or can be produced from multiple sequence alignments. Another method to link fragments is to extract all information obtained from an assembly by looking at the original contig graphs (Mulyukov and Pevzner, 2002) . Information on adjacency of contigs can be found in such graphs and extracted for genome finishing. This method has successfully been applied when sequencing the gram-negative bacteria Rickettsia prowazekii (Nagarajan et al., 2010) . Contig adjacency information is especially useful if repeats exist that are longer than the read length, and contigs were split at positions where the reconstruction was ambiguous.
