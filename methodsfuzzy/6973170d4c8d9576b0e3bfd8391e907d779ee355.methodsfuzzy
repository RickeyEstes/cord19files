We compared the performance of the RPI-Pred with Muppirala's method (36) on the RPI2241 and RPI369 data sets, respectively, using 10-fold CV. This comparison shows the prediction performance of the RPI-Pred method and the importance of structures in the prediction of RPI. We compared our RPI-Pred results obtained from RPI2241 and RP1369 data sets (RPI2241-RPI-Pred and RPI369-RPI-Pred, respectively) using AUC, PRE, REC, FSC and ACC measurements. The comparison results are shown in Table 1 . We denoted Muppirala et al.'s results as RPI2241-SVM, RPI369-SVM, RPI2241-RF and RPI369-RF, based on the two classifiers, SVM and RF, and the used training databases. As shown in Table 1 , our RPI2241-RPI-Pred result showed a prediction accuracy of 84%. This is ∼3% and ∼5% less than the results from the RPI2241-SVM (∼87%) and RPI2241-RF (∼89%) results, respectively. On the other hand, the RPI369-RPI-Pred result showed a prediction accuracy of 92%, implying an increase of ∼24%, and ∼18% over RPI369-SVM (∼72%) and RPI369-RF (∼76%) results, respectively. These results illustrate that our RPI369-RPI-Pred could outperform RPI369-SVM and RPI369-RF classifiers in predicting the pairs of non-ribosomal RNA interacting with protein. Also inclusion of structure features can improve the RPI prediction (36) . Slightly lower prediction accuracy was observed for the RPI2241 data set, which contained more ribosomal RNAs paired with proteins. Ribosomal RNA structures are more likely to contain pseudoknot structures (40, (65) (66) (67) . However, the RNA-fold which was used in this work does not have the ability to predict such structures, and thus the proposed RPI-Pred cannot consider pseudo-knot structures. This may affect the correct prediction of ribosomal RNAs interacting with proteins. Further, Muppirala et al. (36) used 3-mer sequence features while our RPI-Pred uses 1-mer features of sequence and structure to perform RPI prediction. This leads to an increased dimensionality in feature space, which could lead to an improved prediction. However, this also results in a more complex model, and a significantly longer processing time. Recently, Wang et al. (38) developed RPI prediction method using NB and ENB classifiers on RPI2241 and RPI369 data sets. We also compared the performance of our prediction of RPI-Pred method on these two data sets with Wang et al. (38) reported results. For this comparison, we grouped the results in (38) into four categories: RPI2241-NB, RPI369-NB, RPI2241-ENB and RPI369-ENB, based on the data set and classifiers used. The RPI-Pred method had an increased prediction accuracy of ∼9% and ∼10% over RPI2241-NB (75.7%) and RPI2241-ENB (74.0%), respectively. Our RPI-Pred method on RPI369 data set also showed an increased prediction accuracy of ∼15% and ∼17% over RPI369-NB (77.7%) and RPI369-ENB (75.0%), respectively.
