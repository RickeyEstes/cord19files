Briefly, viral nucleic acid was extracted using the Xtractor-Gene nucleic acid extraction procedure (Corbett Life Sciences, Sydney, Australia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A starting volume of 200 mL was used to elute 60 mL of viral RNA/DNA and 5 mL of this eluate was used for each PCR reaction, with a 25 mL final reaction volume. Four quadriplex real-time (TaqMan Ã’ ) PCR assays were employed to detect the following respiratory viruses; influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, parainfluenza (PIV) types 1e4, adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), group 1 coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63), group 2 coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1), and SARS associated coronavirus. Full details of the PCR methods including primer and probe sequences, controls and cycling conditions have been previously described. 4 All respiratory virus testing was performed by the same staff using the Rotor-Gene 3000 PCR machine (Corbett Life Sciences, Sydney, Australia) with standard laboratory protocols. Laboratory staff were blinded to clinical data.
