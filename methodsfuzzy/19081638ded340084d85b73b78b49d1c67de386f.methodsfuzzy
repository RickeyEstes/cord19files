Acetoxymethyl ethers 539 and 540 could be prepared from the mixture of glycerol formals 537 and 538. Reaction of 539 with GuAc2 gave N-9 (541) (and N-7) guanine derivatives as racemic forms whose deacetylation gave 542 (84TL905; 85JMC926). Alkylations of benzimidazole 547 and benzotriazole 548 with the triacylated derivatives 543 or 545 and their dideoxy derivative 544 gave after deprotection 550 and 551, respectively (88KFZ714). The benzotriazoles had greater antiviral activity to enterovirus than the benzimidazoles. The acyclic derivatives derived from 549 are only moderately virucidal to some RNA-containing viruses (89KGS493). The reaction of 546 with l(3)-Himidazo[4,5-b]pyridine gave the 1-and 3-isomers 553 and 554 (90MI1). 552 was formed similarly. The respective optical isomers (R)-and (S)-iNDG were prepared by reacting the enantiomers of the 1,2-di-O-benzylglycerols 556 and 565 with paraformaldehyde and anhydrous HC1 to give the corresponding chloro- methyl ether 557 and its isomer 566, respectively. They reacted with the tris (trimethylsily1)guanine to give 558 and 567, respectively. Their catalytic hydrogenation gave the corresponding 559 and 568 (85JMC926). The precursor for the chiral glycerol 556 was the D-mannitol derivative 555, whose periodate oxidation and reduction gave 556, whereas the other isomer 565 was prepared from the D-mannitol derivatives 560, whose oxidation and reduction gave 561. The last, upon benzylation and hydrolysis, gave 562, which upon tritylation gave 563; subsequent benzylation gave 564. Hydrolysis then gave 565. The racemic form exhibited potent antiviral activity (84TL905). The (S)-iNDG was found to be more active than the R enantiomer against HSV-1 and HSV-2 in cell culture; it had an EDSo comparable to those for ACV and 2' NDG. The inferior activity of (R)-iNDG parallelled the poor inhibition of viral DNA polymerase by its phosphorylation products. In mice (S)-iNDG was less efficacious than 2'NDG, but comparable to or more active than ACV (85EUP130126; 85JMC926). An alternative source for the chiral nucleoside 559 utilizes methyl-2,3,4tri-0-benzyl-a-D-glucopyranoside (569); this was chloromethylated to give 570, which upon reaction with 2-amino-6-benzyloxypurine gave 571. Debenzylation of 571 gave 572, whose periodate oxidation followed by reduction gave the glycerol derivative 573, which upon acid hydrolysis gave 559 (85TL1815). Debenzoylation of the nucleoside analogs 612 gave 613, which upon periodate oxidation and reduction gave the optically pure enantiomers 614. Similarly, uracil analog 615 gave also the corresponding 614 (88KGS223). The racemic analogue 620 was prepared by alkylation of N-23diacetylguanine with 2,3-dichlorotetrahydrofuran 616. The adduct 617 was deacetylated to give 618, and then monomethoxytritylated followed by elimination of HCI to give 619. Treatment of 619 with Os04-NaI0, and then reduction gave 620 (86CJC1885). The racemic analogs were also obtained by replacement of the halogen atom in 2-chloromethyldioxolane 622, obtained from ethylene glycol and 621, by an acetoxy group to give 623. Subsequent opening of the dioxolane ring with acetic anhydride in presence of ZnClz gave 624, followed by reaction with the base to give 625. 1-Alkyl derivatives were almost the only product of the alkylation of trimethylsilyl derivatives of pyrimidine bases, whereas a mixture of the 9and 7-substituted isomers was formed in the case of 6-N-benzoyladenine. Treatment of the protected analogs with a methanolic solution of ammonia led to 626 (88KGS223). Alternatively, ring opening of various 2-substituted dioxolanes 627 with trimethylsilyl iodide provided acyclic sugar analogs 629, via 628; these are lacking only C-3'. Coupling with the sodium salt of 6-chloropurine gave 630, whose reaction with NH3 gave 631 (79JOC3733). Other pyrimidine analogs 632 were also prepared from 1,3-dioxolanes 627 by treatment with base in the presence of a Lewis acid (anhydrous stannic chloride or zinc chloride) in an inert solvent under similar conditions to those of the modified Hilbert-Johnson method. This was followed with methanol containing sodium hydrogen carbonate or aqueous sodium hydroxide to give N-lsubstituted pyrimidine (uracil) acyclonucleosides 632 and a minor product of the respective N-l,N-3-bis-substituted derivatives (85CPB1703).
