We used numbers and percentages to present categorical variables and mean Â± SD or median (P 25 , P 75 ) to present continuous variables. We used the two-sample t test or Satterthwaite t test to compare the lung function variables between patients who had abnormal CT and normal CT findings. We use the mixed-model repeated-measures analysis to compare model-adjusted least-squares means over 15 years. The model included the fixed effects of the follow-up years, and the random effect (random intercept) was the "participant". We performed all statistical analyses using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and all testing was two-sided with the significance level set at P < 0.05.
