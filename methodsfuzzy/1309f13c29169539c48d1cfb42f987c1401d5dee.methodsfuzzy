For closely related protein sequences with identities higher than 30-40%, the alignments produced by all methods are almost always largely correct. The quickest way to search for suitable templates in this regime is to use simple pairwise sequence alignment methods such as SSEARCH, 38 BLAST, 39 and FASTA. 38 Brenner et al. showed that these methods detect only $18% of the homologous pairs at less than 40% sequence identity, while they identify more than 90% of the relationships when sequence identity is between 30% and 40%. 40 Another benchmark, based on 200 reference structural alignments with 0-40% sequence identity, indicated that BLAST is able to correctly align only 26% of the residue positions. 41  The sensitivity of the search and accuracy of the alignment become progressively difficult as the relationships move into the twilight zone. 37,42 A significant improvement in this area was the introduction of profile methods by Gribskov and co-workers. 43 The profile of a sequence is derived from a multiple sequence alignment and specifies residue-type occurrences for each alignment position. The information in a multiple sequence alignment is most often encoded as either a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) 39, 44, 45 or as a hidden Markov model (HMM). 46, 47 To identify suitable templates for comparative modeling, the profile of the target sequence is used to search against a database of template sequences. The profile-sequence methods are more sensitive in detecting related structures in the twilight zone than the pairwise sequence-based methods; they detect approximately twice the number of homologs under 40% sequence identity. 41, 48, 49 The resulting profile-sequence alignments correctly align approximately 43-48% of residues in the 0-40% sequence identity range; 41,50 this number is almost twice as large as that of the pairwise sequence methods. Frequently used programs for profile-sequence alignment are PSI-BLAST, 39 SAM, 51 HMMER, 46 HHsearch, 52 HHBlits, 53 and BUILD_PROFILE. 54 As a natural extension, the profile-sequence alignment methods have led to profile-profile alignment methods that search for suitable template structures by scanning the profile of the target sequence against a database of template profiles, as opposed to a database of template sequences. These methods have proven to include the most sensitive and accurate fold assignment and Figure 2 Comparative protein structure modeling. (a) A flowchart illustrating the steps in the construction of a comparative model. 23 (b) Description of comparative modeling by extraction of spatial restraints as implemented in Modeller. 35 By default, spatial restraints in Modeller include: (1) homology-derived restraints from the aligned template structures; (2) statistical restraints derived from all known protein structures; and (3) stereochemical restraints from the CHARMM-22 molecular mechanics force field. These restraints are combined into an objective function that is then optimized to calculate the final 3D model of the target sequence. alignment protocols to date. 50, [55] [56] [57] Profile-profile methods detect $28% more relationships at the superfamily level and improve the alignment accuracy by 15-20% compared to profile-sequence methods. 50, 58 There are a number of variants of profile-profile alignment methods that differ in the scoring functions they use. 50, 55, [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] However, several analyses have shown that the overall performances of these methods are comparable. 50, [55] [56] [57] Some of the programs that can be used to detect suitable templates are FFAS, 65 SP3, 58 SALIGN, 50 HHBlits, 53 HHsearch, 52 and PPSCAN. 54 Sequence-structure threading methods As the sequence identity drops below the threshold of the twilight zone, there is usually insufficient signal in the sequences or their profiles for the sequence-based methods discussed above to detect true relationships. 48 Sequence-structure threading methods are most useful in this regime as they can sometimes recognize common folds, even in the absence of any statistically significant sequence similarity. 21 These methods achieve higher sensitivity by using structural information derived from the templates. The accuracy of a sequence-structure match is assessed by the score of a corresponding coarse model and not by sequence similarity, as in sequence comparison methods. 21 The scoring scheme used to evaluate the accuracy is either based on residue substitution tables dependent on structural features such as solvent exposure, secondary structure type, and hydrogen bonding properties, 58,66-68 or on statistical potentials for residue interactions implied by the alignment. [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] The use of structural data does not have to be restricted to the structure side of the aligned sequence-structure pair. For example, SAM-T08 makes use of the predicted local structure for the target sequence to enhance homolog detection and alignment accuracy. 74 Commonly used threading programs are GenTHREADER, 66,75 3D-PSSM, 76 FUGUE, 68 SP3, 58 SAM-T08 multitrack HMM, 67, 74, 77 and MUSTER. 78 Iterative sequence-structure alignment Yet another strategy is to optimize the alignment by iterating over the process of calculating alignments, building models, and evaluating models. Such a protocol can sample alignments that are not statistically significant and identify the alignment that yields the best model. Although this procedure can be time-consuming, it can significantly improve the accuracy of the resulting comparative models in difficult cases. 79  It is crucial for method developers and users alike to assess the accuracy of their methods. An attempt to address this problem has been made by the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Proteins Structure Prediction (CASP) 192 and in the past by the Critical Assessment of Fully Automated Structure Prediction (CAFASP) experiments, 193 which is now integrated into CASP. However, CASP assesses methods only over a limited number of target protein sequences, and is conducted only every 2 years. 109, 194 To overcome this limitation, the new CAMEO web server continuously evaluates the accuracy and reliability of a number of comparative protein structure prediction servers, in a fully automated manner. 195 Every week, CAMEO provides each tested server with the prerelease sequences of structures that are to be shortly released by the PDB. Each server then has 4 days to build and return a 3D model of these sequences. When PDB releases the structures, CAMEO compares the models against the experimentally determined structures, and presents the results on its web site. This enables developers, non-expert users, and reviewers to determine the performance of the tested prediction servers. CAMEO is similar in concept to two prior such continuous testing servers, LiveBench 194 and EVA. 196, 197
