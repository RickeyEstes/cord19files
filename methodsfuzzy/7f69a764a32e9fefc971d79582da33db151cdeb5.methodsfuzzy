Chemical reagents MOPS, Hepes, Tris hydrochloride, NaCl, DTT, IPTG, β-mercaptoethanol, thrombin protease, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. EDTA, EGTA, tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), PMSF, EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets, Thrombin CleanCleave Kit, poly-l-lysine (PLL), Atto 488 NHS-ester, and Atto 594 NHS-ester were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Human rhinovirus-3C (HRV-3C) protease, neutravidin, Oregon Green 488-DHPE, and Texas Red-DHPE were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. mPEG-succinimidyl valerate (SVA), biotin-PEG-SVA, mPEG-silane, and biotin-PEG-silane (all PEGs were molecular weight 5,000 D) were purchased from Laysan Bio. Dipalmitoyl-decaethylene glycol-biotin (DP-EG10-biotin) was provided by D. Sasaki of Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA (Momin et al., 2015) . All other lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, including l-α-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P 2 ; from porcine brain), DOGS-NTA-Ni, DOPC, and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS; sodium salt). The lipid compositions for all experiments are listed in the figure captions.
