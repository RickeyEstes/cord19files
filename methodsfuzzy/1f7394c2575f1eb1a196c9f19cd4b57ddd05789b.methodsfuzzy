Sequence collection, annotation, and alignment. Complete coding sequences of all influenza virus coding segments were collected from the NCBI influenza virus resource (43) and the GISAID database (20) downloaded as of October 2012 for human, avian, and swine hosts. Complete coding sequences for the envelope (env) gene of dengue virus subtypes 1, 2, and 3, as well as West Nile virus, were collected from the Virus Pathogen Resource and Broad Institute downloaded as of May 2012. All sequences were filtered for year and month information. If no day information was provided, isolation was assumed to have occurred on the 15th of the month. To avoid the effect of depositing duplicated sequences, only unique sequences were considered for each date and location. Sequences were then aligned using ClustalW2 v. 2.0.12, using default parameters, and then manually curated. Influenza virus sequences were annotated by transmission zones, defined by the WHO as geographically contiguous regions with similar peaks in the influenza season (27) . All alignments and the code used are available upon request. Shannon's entropy as a measurement of genetic diversity. Our measurement of pathogen surveillance incorporates the evolutionary rate, which contributes to population diversity. To measure genetic diversity directly, we chose to employ Shannon's entropy, a popular and intuitive measure that avoids cumbersome phylogenetic reconstruction, and applied it to the distribution of alleles at each nucleotide position within an alignment. This calculation recovers the number of bits of information per base. Assuming the independence of each position, the total entropy of a population is the sum of the entropies of each base position of the alignment. To correct for bias stemming from a variable number of isolates (n), we estimate Shannon's entropy (H) for a given base position on the basis of the following algorithm of Miller et al., where m is the number of alleles (44): Phylogeny as a measurement of surveillance. Sequences were analyzed by using BEAST v1.7.4, a Bayesian MCMC approach, to sample time-structured evolutionary trees from their joint posterior probability distribution. Because of computational and time limits, we restricted our phylogenetic analysis to human H5N1, as BEAST analysis of data sets of over a thousand sequences can take weeks to converge to a stationary condition. This data set was analyzed by using an exponential-growth coalescent as a tree prior with an HKY ϩ ⌫ model of nucleotide substitution. Relaxed and strict molecular clocks were employed. For the strict (relaxed) clock, 20 independent runs of 750,000 (1,500,000) steps each were performed, compared for convergence, and combined, with a burn-in of 150,000 (500,000) steps from each. Each run finished after an average of 32.47 (19.14) h using one 3.00-GHz Intel Xeon CPU with 12 GB of random-access memory. A single maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was created from each set of simulations with the average length determined for each branch. We found the corresponding evolutionary rates to be 5.11 ϫ 10 Ϫ3 (range, 4.58 ϫ 10 Ϫ3 to 5.62 ϫ 10 Ϫ3 ) and 5.39 ϫ 10 Ϫ3 (range 4.39 ϫ 10 Ϫ3 to 5.80 ϫ 10 Ϫ3 ), similar to the evolutionary rate we used for influenza virus HA analysis. The 95% HPD of each branch length of the MCC tree was used to set a confidence interval for each p2 coefficient. Persistence homology as a measurement of surveillance. Another possible surveillance measure can be derived by using persistence homology techniques like bar coding (40), a method of identifying topological invariants in cloud data. First, sequenced isolates can be transformed in high-dimensional space by using distance measures, such as pairwise genetic distance. From these cloud data, points can be linked together on the basis of certain criteria to form a simplicial complex, i.e., a network of points, line segments, triangles, and even n-dimensional counterparts. When this criterion is a distance less than some , a filtered simplicial complex or Vietoris-Rips stream is created. An objective in the study of topology is to identify features of filtered simplicial complexes that persist across all values of . A useful characteristic is the Betti number, which in dimension 0 is b 0 , the number of connected components in a particular simplicial complex. Trivially, with a large enough , b 0 is 1, but what is interesting is the minimum value of that yields a b 0 value of 1. Low values would indicate a higher degree of surveillance. The calculation of Vietoris-Rips streams for large point cloud data can be computationally expensive, and an alternative method called witness streams (45) can be used to estimate . Suppose a landmark subset of points (L) is preselected from point cloud data either at random or using a max-min scheme. Let d(L, p) be a vector of distances between a point p and all points in L. In dimension 0, a pair of points is then linked if there exists a witness point z such that the maximum d(L, p) is less than the sum of and the minimum d(L, p). Using the Javaplex software package at http://code.google.com/p /javaplex, we implemented a witness stream to filter different strains of influenza virus. Of N total sequences per strain, n sequences were chosen as landmarks by using the max-min selection algorithm, such that N/n ϭ 3 (45) . Bar coding was performed at filtration Hamming distances at intervals of 20 from 0 to 100.
