Our results demonstrate that a deep sequencing approach is the method of choice for the analysis of diverse viromes and that the characterization of the conserved RdRp domain is the best way to get a valid overview about viral diversity in such complex RNA virus viromes. However, our study also showed the two main pitfalls of virus characterization in virome samples. In general, virome analysis faces the problem, that no marker gene for targeted amplification like the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) is present in viruses. Instead, other methods for the enrichment of viral sequences are used, which all bring along certain disadvantages. The most popular method is the purification of virus particles, which seems natural, as the viruses used to be defined as capsid-coding organisms [47] . However, the identification of the capsidless hypoviruses and their acceptance by the ICTV changed this [46] . Further progress in the field of mycovirus research revealed that the absence of a coat protein is a common feature among mycoviruses making the approach of particle purification rather unsuitable for virome analysis in fungi. An alternative approach recently used for the characterization of mycoviruses, utilized siRNAs from infected fungi [62] . Even though they were able to detect mycoviruses belonging to the Narnaviridae (ssRNA, unencapsidated), as well as to the Partitiviridae (dsRNA, encapsidated), it is not sure if all mycoviruses are delectable by this method, as interference with RNA silencing seems to be an important trait in mycoviruses [63] . The sequencing of total RNA and DNA is a further popular method but viruses of low a titer might not be detected [63] . Especially in virome analysis of environmental samples, the first level assignment of reads belonging to novel viruses is another problem, when no separation between viral and host sequences has been applied [64] . To overcome the limitations described, we used an extraction of dsRNA, which is a replicative intermediate of all RNA viruses, as starting material for library preparation in order to maximize the number of reads derived from viruses. Still, the coverage between contigs differed enormously, most likely due to differences in the virus titer within the sample, as the whole dsRNA extract was used for analysis, compared to individual dsRNA band excision from the gel. Using equimolar ratios of purified dsRNA fragments would probably improve the uniformity in coverage, but may cause the problem of missing certain species, which, due to low virus titers, are not visualized by gel electrophoresis. However, the coverage can be used for an indication of the dominance of certain viral species in the virome, which is especially interesting, as hypovirulence is reported to be correlated to higher virus titers [65, 66] . Following this hypothesis, RsMV 17 could be of special interest, as its coverage was 17 times higher than the average. Still, some of the contigs representing novel species, like RsFV-1 and RsFV-2 displayed a very low coverage indicating that the contigs do not represent fulllength genome components. The second problem is the limited number of characterized mycoviral sequences, which can be used as reference for species assignment of the generated contigs. Apart from conserved regions, sequence similarities are too low to draw conclusions about the phylogeny of the virus [67] . The RdRp domain is the best available indicator to identify also novel viruses, sharing no other homologies with known viruses and represents the key for the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships between those viruses [29] [30] [31] . In general, virus taxonomy is a challenging field since high mutation rates and frequent exchange of whole gene modules lead to a very high sequence divergence, which makes reasonable alignments virtually impossible [67] . Nevertheless, the analysis the RdRp allows clustering above the order level in so-called superfamilies. The identification of the conserved motifs within the RdRp domain is an important point, since only the comparison of homologous sequences will lead to a valid taxonomic assignment [67] . We identified the conserved motifs A to G of the novel viruses, as well as in reference sequences derived from the NCBI database and used an alignment of this region for a first taxonomic classification. This approach enabled us to get a first and valid impression of the viral diversity of the species inhabiting R. solani DC17 and allowed an identification of novel viruses which might be of special interest in the fields of biocontrol, virus biology and taxonomy. For example, the analysis revealed the presence of the novel mitovirus RsMV-20, which is closely related to Thanatephorus cucumeris mitovirus (TcMV). An infection of Rhizoctonia with TcMV resulted in decreased virulence of the host [21, 68] . Studies using this hypovirulent isolate of Rhizoctonia (AG-3), infected with TcMV, demonstrated its potential use as biocontrol agent [6] . This makes RsMV-20 an interesting candidate for further analysis in regard to hypovirulence induction. Also, a further characterization of RsMBV-1 is promising, since, so far, all described megabirnaviruses, apart from Pleosporales megabirnavirus 1, which was detected in the virome of marine fungi, were associated with hypovirulence of their hosts [61, [69] [70] [71] . As well, the identification of RsMV-1, which is closely related to AfV-S2 and RnMV-2 is an interesting finding. AfV-S2 and RnMV-2 are reported to feature a rather unusual lifestyle since they possess a one-segmented ssRNA genome, which hijacks the capsid protein (CP) of an unrelated dsRNA virus [57, 58] . The coat protein of RnMV-2 originates from Rosellinia necatrix mycovirus 1, which belongs to a group of novel viruses distantly related to the Totiviridae [57] . In case of AfV-S2, the capsid protein is derived from a member of the Victoriviruses (Totiviridae) [58] . The close relationship between those viruses and the newly identified virus RsMV-1 raises the hypothesis that also RsMV-1 might hijack a CP of another virus. As no totivirus or close relative is present in the virome of R. solani DC17, RsMV-1 would have to use the CP of another virus, like Rhizoctonia solani partitivirus-1 or Rhizoctonia solani megabirnavirus-1. Either way, a finding like this would be interesting in regard to virus interactions and evolution. Still, for a full-value assignment into viral families and a biological characterization of the novel viruses, more criteria than the phylogeny of the RdRp have to be analyzed, especially when the viruses belong to novel viral groups. The next steps need to be the determination of full-length sequences and the isolation of single virus species to study their biological effects by e.g. purification and transfection of viral particles, the construction of infectious full-length cDNA-clones, or the elimination of certain virus by mycelial fragmentation, hyphal tipping or protoplastation [72] [73] [74] [75] .
