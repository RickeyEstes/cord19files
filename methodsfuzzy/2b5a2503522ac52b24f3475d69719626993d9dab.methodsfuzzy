The stratum corneum is 15-20 µm thick and is indispensable as a barrier. The viable epidermis is located below the stratum corneum, and has a thickness of 130-180 µm. Below the epidermis lies the dermis, which is about 2,000 µm thick and contains nerves, blood vessels, nociceptors, lymph vessels, hair follicles, and sweat glands ( Figure 1 ). 15 The epidermal or epithelial layer is a covering carried in the superficial dermis or superficial lamina in the superficial plexus. In the case of skin as a model, the plexus is the intradermal plexus. There are some lymphatic vessels in that layer. In the deep dermal layer or deep lamina, the deep plexus is carried. In the case of skin, this is the subdermal plexus. In that layer, there are most of the lymphatic vessels, and the collagen content of that layer is much greater than in the superficial layer. 16  Fabrication of microneedles usually follows the steps of molding, preparation of microneedle matrix, casting, removal, and drying. 39 The concrete methods are determined by the desired property of the microneedles. However, harsh fabrication methods (ie, using high temperature or organic solvent) may damage temperature-sensitive drugs, particularly peptides and proteins, so this review mainly focuses on mild fabrication methods. Vacuum and centrifugation are often applied in casting the microneedle matrix into the molds. Whilst a polydimethylsiloxane micromold can be created with precise morphological fidelity to master microneedle structures, sugar solutions did not completely fill the micromold invaginations, due to the high surface tension of the solution. Martin et al 40 revealed a simple and novel low-temperature vacuum-deposition micromolding methodology for biodegradable sugar-glass microneedle fabrication. In the original vacuum-oven method, vacuum pressure could not be applied before the sugar solution was placed on the mold surface. Subsequently, when the droplet of sugar solution was applied, air was entrapped within the micromold invaginations. An optimized method was developed whereby a vacuum was produced within an enclosed chamber before the sugar solution was applied to the mold surface. DeMuth et al 41 developed microneedle-fabrication methods featuring drug-loaded PLGA microparticles or solid PLGA tips. PLGA microparticles were applied to the surface of the mold in an aqueous suspension and compacted into the mold cavities through centrifugation. Excess
