Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 C for 20 min at 20,000 x g. Neutravidin pull-down 60 ml of 50% slurry of High Capacity Neutravidin Agarose Beads (Thermo) was used for each 500 ml of clarified whole cell lysate. Beads were equilibrated in RIPA buffer by washing three times for 10 min at 4 C. In one of the BirA*-X61 experimental runs, 1 ml of 500x RNase A (100 mg, QIAGEN) was added to each sample to remove non-specific interactors. The lysate was then incubated for 5 min at room temperature before loading onto the beads. Untreated samples were loaded directly onto the beads post washing. 1 mg of protein sample was loaded to beads in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, which were then placed on a rotator overnight at 4 C, and collected with centrifugation at 400 x g for 1 min at 4 C. Beads were washed with RIPA buffer three times, followed by three washes with TAP buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl and 10% glycerol).
