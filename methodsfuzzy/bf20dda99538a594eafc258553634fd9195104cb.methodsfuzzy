Due to an unknown reason, the cumulative number of cases remained at 41 from 1 to 15 January 2020 according to the official report, i.e., no new case was reported during these 15 days, which appears inconsistent with the following rapid growth of the epidemic curve since 16 January 2020. We suspect that the 2019-nCoV cases were under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020. In this study, we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R 0 , of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan from 1 to 15 January 2020 based on the limited data in the early outbreak. The time series data of 2019-nCoV cases in mainland China were initially released by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission from 10 to 20 January 2020 [8] , and later by the National Health Commission of China after 21 January 2020 [9] . The case time series data in December 2019 were obtained from a published study [3] . All cases were laboratory confirmed following the case definition by the national health commission of China [10] . We chose the data up to 24 January 2020 instead of to the present study completion date. Given the lag between timings of case confirmation and news release of new cases, the data of the most recent few days were most likely to be tentative, and thus they were excluded from the analysis to be consistent. We suspected that there was a number of cases, denoted by ξ, under-reported from 1 to 15 January 2020. The cumulative total number of cases, denoted by C i , of the i-th day since 1 December 2019 is the summation of the cumulative reported, c i , and cumulative unreported cases, Ξ i . We have C i = c i + Ξ i , where c i is observed from the data, and Ξ i is 0 for i before 1 January and ξ for i after 15 January 2020. Following previous studies [11, 12] , we modelled the epidemic curve, i.e., the C i series, as an exponential growing Poisson process. Since the data from 1 to 15 January 2020 appeared constant due to unclear reason(s), we removed these data from the fitting of exponential growth. The ξ and the intrinsic growth rate (γ) of the exponential growth were to be estimated based on the log-likelihood, denoted by , from the Poisson priors. The 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of ξ was estimated by the profile likelihood estimation framework with cutoff threshold determined by a Chi-square quantile [13] , χ 2 pr = 0.95, df = 1 . With γ estimated, the basic reproduction number could be obtained by R 0 = 1/M(−γ) with 100% susceptibility for 2019-nCoV presumed at this early stage. Here, the function M(·) was the Laplace transform, i.e., the moment generating function, of the probability distribution for the serial interval (SI) of the disease [11, 14] , denoted by h(k) and k is the mean SI. Since the transmission chain of 2019-nCoV remained unclear, we adopted the SI information from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which share the similar pathogen as 2019-nCoV [15] [16] [17] . We modelled h(k) as Gamma distributions with mean of 8.0 days and standard deviation (SD) of 3.6 days by averaging the SI mean and SD of SARS, mean of 7.6 days and SD of 3.4 days [18] , and MERS, mean of 8.4 days and SD of 3.8 days [19] . We were also interested in inferring the patterns of the daily number of cases, denoted by ε i for the i-th day, and thus it is obviously that C i = C i−1 + ε i . A simulation framework was developed for the iterative Poisson process such that E[ denoted the expectation. The simulation was implemented starting from 1 January 2020 with a cumulative number of cases seed of 40, the same as reported on 31 December 2019. We conducted 1000 samples and calculated the median and 95% CI.
