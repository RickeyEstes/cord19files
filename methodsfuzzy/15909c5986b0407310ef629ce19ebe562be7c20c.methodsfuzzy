Committee (13/SS/0079) and carried out the study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (Clinical trials registration: NCT02438579, May 8, 2015). ELVIS was a pilot unblinded RCT of HSNIG to determine recruitment in Edinburgh as the primary outcome. Acceptability and compliance with HSNIG, quality of life, duration of symptoms and viral shedding were secondary outcomes. With a sample size of 27 per group we would be able to express the proportion of those who return the symptom score diary and samples within that group to within ±19% based on a two-sided 95% confidence interval around an expected proportion of 0.5. With the two groups combined [i.e. a sample size of 54] we would be able to express a proportion to within ±13%. To allow for dropouts we planned to recruit up to 80 participants to have at least 30 participants per arm for analysis. The study was advertised through schools, libraries and general practices in Edinburgh and Midlothian areas, local newspaper coverage, emails within NHS Lothian, online, social media and the study website (www.elvisstudy.com). Identification of individuals with a cold. Individuals with URTI were identified as done by Barrett et al. 33, 36 Volunteers had to (1) answer "Yes" to "do you have a cold?" or "do you think you are coming down with a cold?"; (2) have at least one of first four symptoms: nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, sneezing, sore throat, headache, malaise, chilliness and cough and (3) have a Jackson Score of ≥2. Onset of URTI >48 hours, concurrent antibiotic use, pregnancy, known chronic conditions, immunosuppression, allergic rhinitis, inability to perform HSNIG and taking part in another medical trial were exclusion criterion. Volunteers met a trial nurse at a Clinical Research Facility at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) or the Western General Hospital where informed consent was obtained, and participants were then randomised. Participants were centrally allocated into intervention and control arms using a minimisation algorithm containing sex and smoking status (current/not a current smoker) with a built-in random component to ensure allocation concealment. Feedback. Participants had to maintain a daily form (Fig. S1 ) until they recorded "not unwell" (i.e. score of 0) on two consecutive days or for a maximum of 14 days or until the individual needed further treatment for URTI and then filled the end-of-study form (Fig. S2) . The short form of the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-21) was used to collect daily symptom data 33 . For use in the Scottish context, and with the authors consent, the words "sick" and "plugged" were replaced with "unwell" and "blocked", respectively (WURSS-21-Scot) (Fig. S1 ). Participants were asked to answer the global severity question: "How unwell do you feel today?" which was scored from 0 (not unwell) to 7 (severely unwell). If they scored >0, then symptoms and functional ability were graded 0-7. They then answered the global change question "Compared to yesterday, I feel my cold is" which was scored from 0 (very much better) to 6 (very much worse). Total WURSS-21 score was calculated by adding the scores for all except the first and last question. To calculate the mean WURSS-21 score, the scores for each participant were added and divided by 14. A mean value of EQ-VAS was calculated for each participant over the time questionnaires were returned as it was possible that participants may not score 100 even when a person's cold symptoms have completely resolved. Both arms documented OTCM use and if they contacted the general practitioner (GP)/nurse for further management of their URTI. Feedback about trial procedures, acceptability, health service use, costs to the patient and suggestions for improving the study and information on symptomatic household contacts were collected at the end of the study. Participants had the option to fill the daily and end-of-study forms online or on paper and return them to the laboratory. Study Procedures. Intervention arm were taught to prepare the hypertonic saline, perform HSNIG and documented the number of times/day and side-effects. They could either prepare 100 ml of hypertonic saline for a single use or prepare in bulk in a clean flask for use during the day. Instructions on how to make the solution and perform HSNIG are in Supplementary Methods and in www.elvisstudy.com. Control arm managed URTI as they normally did. As the hypothesis was chloride ion mediated antiviral effect, normal saline could not be used as a placebo. As sodium bicarbonate was uncomfortable in the authors personal experience, we opted for not including a placebo arm. The rationale for not including a saline placebo arm is elaborated in the discussion. Participants documented OTCM use and were asked to contact to their GP if unwell. The trial nurse helped participants in the intervention arm identify the highest concentration of HS they were comfortable with (from 3%, 2.5%, 2.0% and 1.5%). Intervention arm were taught how to prepare HS and perform HSNIG with videos (www.elvisstudy.com) and given the opportunity to perform HSNIG under supervision. Cornish sea salt, digital-measuring spoon, bowls and flask were provided with instructions to perform HSNIG as many times as required (expected frequency up to 6 times/day for the first two days, reducing in frequency from day 3 as symptoms improved). Mid-turbinate swab collection. The trial nurse collected a mid-turbinate swab (day 0) and taught participants on how to collect samples first thing in the morning on days 1-4 (before HSNIG was performed that day in the intervention arm converted to log 10 to estimate change in viral shedding. CT was capped at 40 as samples with CT values above this level was unlikely to be positive on repeat testing. CT values were converted to log 10 using this formula (40-CT of sample)/3.3 (a CT of 3.3 represents a log change in viral load by PCR). Since the baseline sample was tested on two separate occasions, reproducibility of testing was assessed by comparing the two results. Inter-assay variation was expected to be <0.5 log 10 . Where consecutive samples had undetectable virus, the first sample that was undetectable was treated as the end-point for viral shedding analysis. For the intervention arm, since NaCl could have an antiviral effect, the day with the lowest shedding when HSNIG was being performed was treated as the end-point. Where HSNIG was stopped earlier than 4 days, since swabs were collected first thing in the morning, the day after HSNIG was stopped was considered the end-point. Hence for the intervention arm, the end-point was day 4 [apart from participant numbers 1, 5, 7, 13, 16, 17, 18 and 19 where it was day 3; 2 (rhinovirus), 14, and 15 where it was day 2; and 11 and 12 where it was day 1]. Two individuals had dual viral infections in their specimen. Both viruses were included for viral shedding analysis. To determine if there was reduction in viral shedding, the log 10 value of the day 0 sample was subtracted from the log 10 value of the end-point. Negative values indicate a reduction in viral shedding and positive values indicate an increase in viral shedding. To determine the reduction in viral shedding per day, these values were divided by the number of days of follow-up. The proportion of individuals with reduction in viral shedding by ≥0.5 log 10 / day was then calculated. statistical analysis. We used SAS v9.4 software for statistical analysis. For categorical data, we present numbers and percentages. For continuous data, we present mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range (IQR)) as appropriate. Binomial test for the comparisons of proportions was used to examine differences in proportions and presented along with 95% CI for differences in proportions or chi-square tests depending on the number of groups. To compare differences between treatment arms, two-sample t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests were used, as appropriate. Participants were considered in the groups to which they were randomised irrespective of treatment received for analysis. Due to the way the data were collected, baseline information was available for all participants. Any subsequent information was the result of participants returning the diary card, potential non-return of diary cards was accounted for by increasing our sample size to allow for drop-outs. In the cases where diary cards were not returned, we do not have any information beyond baseline and therefore we have not used any methods to impute any missing data.
