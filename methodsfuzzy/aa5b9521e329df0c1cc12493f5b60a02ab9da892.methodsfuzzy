Despite these environmental implications and the substantial public health concerns, biomass identity, distribution, and abundance in the atmosphere and in indoor air have been poorly described. Certainly, this is not consistent with analytical perspectives of aerosol chemistry or the understanding of microorganisms in aquatic environments and potable water supplies. There are three reasons contributing to this knowledge gap. First, atmospheric sciences have traditionally been paired with the analytical chemistry efforts needed to investigate the air pollution of the industrial age. A consequence of this tradition is that extensive chemical rather than biological characterization of the atmosphere exists and that few scientists or engineers have complementary aerosol and biotechnology skill sets. The second reason is the difficulty in detecting airborne microorganisms due to their dilute nature (Roy and Milton, 2004) . For microorganisms, the atmosphere is an extreme and oligotrophic environment, and compared with sampling practices for food, aquatic, and terrestrial environments, microorganism collection from ambient air presents a significant technological challenge. Bioaerosol sampling equipment has collection efficiencies less than 100%, and these efficiencies vary significantly with the aerodynamic diameter of airborne particulate matter. Further, conventional collection devices that harvest particulate matter from air introduce significant sampling stresses, which can substantially reduce the viability and/or culturability of a broad range of airborne microorganisms (Buttner et al., 1997; Stewart et al., 1995) . The final reason for the relatively limited understanding of aerosol microbial ecology is a direct result of the poor integration of biotechnology with aerosol science. Conventional culturing methods, such as plate counts, continue to be the most widely used method in aerobiology investigations (AC-GIH, 1999) . While culturing still fills an important role in aerosol studies, particularly with pure culture investigations that isolate intrinsic responses of airborne microorganisms and determine the viability or infectivity potential, the ecological bias introduced by culture-based microbiological assays has been well documented (Woese, 1987) . Less than 1% of bacteria from terrestrial and aquatic environments can be recovered by enrichment culture (Amann et al., 1995; Pace, 1997) . In many of these environments, the majority of the cells are believed to be viable but do not form colonies on agar plates. Based on bioaerosol studies that have measured both total and culturable microorganisms, this low recovery of culturable microorganisms also extends into the atmospheric environment (Table 1) . The strong reliance on culturing has also limited the types of bioaerosols that can be studied. The etiological agents of many infectious airborne diseases have never been detected in the environment, and there is still uncertainty in the transmission modes for many airborne diseases (Samet, 2004) . For example, common infectious airborne agents such as Pneumocystis carinii cannot be cultured (Wakefield, 1996) . Even though more than one million people die of tuberculosis each year, and one third of the world's population has been exposed to the causative agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (WHO, 2004) , we are aware of no studies in the peer reviewed literature to confirm the culture-based detection of viable M. tuberculosis from an ambient air sample. Further, culture-based techniques do not apply for assaying allergenic fractions of plants and insects, and recent application of quantitative PCR allergenic fungi in house dust suggested that culturing may underestimate concentrations by 2-3 orders of magnitude (Meklin et al., 2004) . Finally, the number of environmental bioaerosol studies reporting on the analysis of airborne viruses is markedly less than those targeting other microorganisms. Classical cell culture assays are the most common type of virus enumeration technique. However, many virus particles do not yet have cell culture assays, and the low efficiencies associated with recovering submicron viral particles in liquid impingers (Willeke et al., 1998) result in the necessity to sample for viruses on filters. Filter recovery has limitations, since dessication incurred during collection may strongly con-tribute to significant infectivity losses and the consequent inability to detect viruses by cell culture analysis (Agranovski et al., 2004) . In their extensive review of viral aerosols, Sattar and Ijaz (1997) strongly state that proper studies on the airborne spread of many human viruses have not been possible because many viruses cannot be readily cultured using standard laboratory techniques. In the last 15 years, techniques used to study microorganisms in the environment have dramatically expanded due to the ability to detect and identify microorganisms and viruses by DNA or RNA sequence comparison (Pace, 1997) . This advance has been made possible by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), an enzymatic reaction in which a sequence of DNA (usually a specific gene or portion of a gene) is selected and multiple copies produced. Using carefully designed DNA primers, a genetic sequence representing a specific microorganism, a group of microorganisms, or a microbial function can be targeted, amplified, quantified, and sequenced. The resulting sequences can then be analyzed directly and compared with existing public databases for identification, or processed for population fingerprinting, microarray analysis, or clone library analysis. PCR can only be performed on DNA sequences. RNA amplification is achieved by first converting RNA to DNA through a reverse transcriptase process and then PCR amplifying the resultant DNA. The advantages of PCR-based techniques for aerosols include the remarkable sensitivity and the unambiguous bioaerosol detection and identification that can be made independent of culturing, thus circumventing the sampling and aerosol-type limitations previously described. The PCR method is general, as it can be applied to any biological matter that contains nucleic acids, such as fungi, viruses, bacteria, and many types of allergens. The elimination of culturing pathogens removes the need for specialized labs to perform cell cultures that require extensive biosafety infrastructure not common in aerosol laboratories. Finally, PCR-based methods also have the potential to provide results more rapidly than culturing techniques-on the order of hours as compared to days or weeks.
