Plasmids construction pUCR1 and pRC2|G are full-length cDNA clones of RNA1 and RNA2 of RCNMV Australian strain, respectively (Takeda et al., 2005; Xiong and Lommel, 1991) . Constructs described previously that were used in this study included: pUCR1-d3′SLA, pUCR1-d3′SLB, pUCR1-d3′SLC, pUCR1-d3′SLD (we renamed as pUCR1-d3′SLDE-5′ in this paper), pUCR1-d3′ SLE (we renamed as d3′SLDE-3′ in this paper), pUCR1-d3′SLF, and pUCR1-d3′TE (Iwakawa et al., 2007) . All constructs were verified by sequencing. The primers used in this study are listed in Table 1. DNA fragments were amplified by PCR from pUCR1 using primer A1 + 3380 plus one each of following: dSLB-5′-, dSLB-3′-, dSLC-5′-, dSLC-3′-, dSLD-5′-, dSLD-3′-, dSLC-5′a-, dSLC-5′b-, dSLC-5′c-, dSLC-3′ a-, dSLC-3′b-, SLC sSL5′b-, SLC sSL3′b-, SLC sSLmR-, SLC sSLmLoop-, SLC largeSL5′b-, SLC largeSL3′b-, and SLC sSLmLoop2-, respectively. Another primer M4 was used together with one each following: dSLB-5′+, dSLB-3′+, dSLC-5′+, dSLC-3′+, dSLD-5′+, dSLD-3′+, dSLC-5′a+, dSLC-5′b+, dSLC-5′c+, dSLC-3′a+, dSLC-3′b+, SLC sSL5′b+, SLC sSL3′b+, SLC sSLmR+, SLC sSLmLoop+, SLC largeSL5′ b+, SLC largeSL3′b+, and SLC sSLmloop2+, respectively. Then a PCR fragment was amplified from a mixture of these two fragments using the primers A1 + 3380 and M4, digested with MluI and SphI and used to replace the corresponding region of pUCR1. pUCR1-3′SLCbSL-R DNA fragments were amplified by PCR from pUCR1 using three sets of primers, A1 + 3380 plus SLC largeSL5′b-, SLC largeSL5′b+ plus SLC largeSL3′b-, and SLC largeSL3′b+ plus M4. The amplified DNA fragments were mixed and further amplified by PCR using the primer pair A1 + 3380 and M4. The amplified DNA fragments were digested with MluI and SphI, and used to replace the corresponding region of pUCR1. pUCR1-SM, pUCR1-5′BulgeSL -m1, and pUCR1-5′BulgeSL -m2 DNA fragments were amplified by PCR from pUCR1 using primer R1_EcoRI+ plus one each following: Slippery-, slipSLm1-, and slipSLm2-, respectively. Another primer R1_XhoI-was used together with one each of following: Slippery+, slipSLm1+, and slipSLm2+, respectively. Recombinant PCR products were amplified with the primer pair R1_EcoRI+ and R1_XhoI+, digested with EcoRI and XhoI and used to replace the corresponding region of pUCR1. pUCR1-Restore-1 and pUCR1-Restore-2 DNA fragments were amplified by PCR from pUCR1 using primer R1_EcoRI+ plus one each following: slipSLm1-and slipSLm2-, respectively. Another primer R1_XhoI-was used together with one each of following: slipSLm1+ and slipSLm2+, respectively. Recombinant PCR products were amplified with the primer pair R1_EcoRI+ and R1_XhoI+, digested with EcoRI and XhoI and used to replace the corresponding region of pUCR1-3′SLCsSL-mLoop and pUCR1-3′ SLCsSL-mLoop2, respectively.
