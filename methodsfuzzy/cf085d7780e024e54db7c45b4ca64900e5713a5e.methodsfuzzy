Participation in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)sponsored CIT Consortium required a demonstrated record of robust clinical and islet product manufacturing success (Supplementary Data). The CMC MC developed the common MPBR (23), product specifications (32) , and interim and final certificates of analysis (COAs) (30, 31) and agreed on the deceased donor organ acceptance criteria (Table 1) . Each manufacturing facility was responsible for its own quality control, quality assurance, and compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and Current Good Tissue Practices. The CMC MC provided further quality oversight by qualifying the manufacturing facilities for study participation and conducting batch record reviews. Assays used to determine product viability (fluorescein diacetate/propidium iodide [FDA/PI]) (33, 34, 37) , identity/quantity (dithizone [DTZ]) (35) , and biological potency (glucose stimulated insulin release [GSIR] by ELISA) (41) were qualified at each facility before that facility's participation in the trial. Manufacturers were required to meet the predefined assay acceptance criteria for accuracy, precision, selectivity, sensitivity, and reproducibility of each assay. All operations were conducted using aseptic processing in accredited cGMP facilities (Supplementary Data). Recovery is defined as the quantity of IEQ retrieved during the manufacturing process and expressed as IEQ per gram of trimmed pancreas. Process yield refers to the proportion of IEQ recovered relative to the starting IEQ. Continuous variables are displayed as number of observations, mean 6 SD, or median (interquartile range [IQR] ). Categorical variables are displayed as number and percent. Relationship of donor characteristics to IEQ recovery was analyzed by stepwise regression. Comparisons of variables among enzyme solutions and manufacturing centers were performed using F tests. Statistical significance was defined at P , 0.05. SAS for Windows versions 9.3-9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for all data management and statistical analyses.
