What other functions could orf7a serve within the context of the ER/Golgi network? A significant number of viral accessory proteins have been found to be critical for the evasion of host-mediated immunity, interfering with diverse processes, including apoptosis, complement activation, cytokine signaling, and innate and adaptive immune surveillance (Alcami and Koszinowski, 2000; Ploegh, 1998). While many of these proteins act at the plasma membrane or are secreted from infected cells, others have been found to operate within  


Section:by cdna transfection, a small amount of e is sufficient to trigger the formation of virus-like particles (bos et al., 1996; vennema et al., 1996). it is still unclear what makes the m and e proteins gather in the ergic during infection (lontok et al., 2004). when expressed individually, both move past the virus-assembly site (corse and machamer, 2002; swift and machamer, 1991). two other coronavirus proteins integrate into the budding membrane: the s protein and, in the subset of coronaviruses that express it, the hemagglutinin-esterase (he) protein. both localize to the pre-golgi by forming specific interactions with m (nguyen and hogue, 1998). if sars-cov buds into the ergic as other coronaviruses do, then our data indicate that orf7a traffics through the budding compartment. it is conceivable that orf7a may play a role in viral assembly or budding events unique to sars-cov. in support of this idea, tan et al. have presented coimmunoprecipitation data suggesting an interaction between orf7a and the product of another sars-cov accessory gene, orf3a, a protein which in turn interacts with the structural proteins m, e, and s (tan et al., 2004). alternatively, orf7a may itself be packaged into virions, possibly to serve as a secondary attachment protein in a manner analogous to he. so far, studies aimed at identifying the structural proteins of the sars-cov virion have failed to detect orf7a (krokhin et al., 2003; ying et al., 2004), although it is worth noting that these methods also have failed to detect the virion-associated e protein. we tested whether our anti-orf7a monoclonal antibodies could block the production of virus or its cytopathic effects in sars-cov-infected vero cells. however, no neutralization effect was observed (data not shown).
