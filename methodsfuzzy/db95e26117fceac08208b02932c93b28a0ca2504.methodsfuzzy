At MSKCC, nasopharyngeal swabs are used for detection of RV. Viral culture was performed as described in earlier studies [6] . Viruses detected by the combination of direct fluorescence antibody and viral culture included the following nine viruses: influenza A virus, influenza B virus, PIV 1-3, RSV, adenovirus, HMPV and rhinoviruses. The turn-around time from receipt of the nasopharyngeal swab by the laboratory to final results varied from 1 to 14 days. PCR was performed by the FDA cleared Film Array Respiratory Panel, an automated multiplex system that detects 21 respiratory pathogens-adenovirus; bocavirus; coronavirus types 229E, HKU1, OC43, and NL63; influenza A virus (including subtype determination); influenza B virus; MPV; PIV types 1, 2, 3 and 4; RSV; rhinovirus; Bordetella pertussis; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (BioFire Diagnostics Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA) (6). The turn-around time from receipt of the nasopharyngeal swab by the laboratory to final results varied from 1 to 3 h.
