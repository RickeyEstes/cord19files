Common pipistrelle and serotine bats were found stranded and severely wounded on different occasions, and admitted to an official local bat shelter in the Netherlands. The animals were euthanized by veterinarians due to ethical reasons using officially approved methods. The Gambian fruit bats and three of four Egyptian fruit bats used in this study originated from free-ranging populations in Ghana. The bats were sampled for an unrelated study and this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Zoological Society of London (ref. WLE715) and the council for scientific and industrial research in Accra, Ghana. One of the Egyptian fruit bats was obtained from the captive colony at the Friederich Loeffler Institute, Riems, Germany. It had been euthanized due to reasons not related to this study. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. After euthanasia, the bats were necropsied and tissues were collected. Parts of the lung, intestine, salivary gland, liver, and kidney were obtained from nine common pipistrelle bats, seven serotine bats, three Gambian fruit bats, and four Egyptian fruit bats. Parts of the noses were obtained from five common pipistrelle bats, six serotine bats, three Gambian fruit bats, and three Egyptian fruit bats. These tissues were all fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. The noses were decalcified in 10% EDTA for 9 days before being embedded in paraffin. The formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues were sectioned (4 μm), deparaffinized, and subsequently hydrated. Citric acid buffer 10 mM pH 6 was used to retrieve antigens. Blocking with normal rabbit serum 5% was performed prior to staining with polyclonal goat IgG anti-DPP4 (R&D systems, Abingdon, UK) in 5 µg/ml concentration. Normal goat serum (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA) in equal concentration was used as negative control. DPP4 staining was performed at 4 °C overnight. Secondary antibody rabbit anti-goat IgG labeled with peroxidase were applied subsequently in 1:200 dilution for 1 hour at room temperature (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The red signal was revealed with 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) before counterstaining with hematoxylin. Dromedary camel intestinal tissues were obtained from three different animals sacrificed at day 14 post infection with MERS-CoV in a previous MERS-CoV vaccination experiment 2 . Two of these animals were vaccinated beforehand, while one was not. MERS-CoV was not detected in the intestinal tissues of these animals using PCR, virus titration or immunohistochemistry detecting nucleoprotein of MERS-CoV. Information on DPP4 expression in human respiratory and intestinal tissues was derived from the previous studies 26, [33] [34] [35] .
