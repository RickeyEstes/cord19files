Different results might also be explained by lack of rigor in assessment tools. Gale and colleagues (2008) and Camargo and associates (2007) used maternal recall to determine if the mother's infant had ever been diagnosed with respiratory infections such as pneumonia, bronchiolitis, croup, or bronchitis. Camargo and colleagues (2007) further relied on maternal recall by asking mothers to complete a food frequency questionnaire and then using the information to assess vitamin D intake. Maternal self-report can be inaccurate because mothers might incorrectly remember past events or not understand the questions. Also, mothers might hesitate to report their children's illnesses if they believe reporting illnesses would reflect poorly on their abilities as mothers and be less socially acceptable (Lau, Hurst, Smith, & Schanler, 2007) . Bronchiolitis scores were used exclusively to assess illness severity in the study by Carroll and colleagues (2011) , and individual scores were based on respiratory symptoms at one point in time. Trends in bronchiolitis scores are helpful in determining illness trajectory and effectiveness of respiratory treatments. However, the researchers used a single bronchiolitis score for each child, which does not accurately reflect the extent or severity of illness over time. Additionally, Carroll and colleagues did not specify when the bronchiolitis score was determined, and scores can vary widely, depending on the timing of assessment (e.g., on admission versus prior to discharge) and when the infant had last undergone suctioning or received a respiratory treatment. These data collection methods have weaknesses that could affect the study's results. Another weakness is the lack of data on serum vitamin D levels. Neither randomized controlled trial (Manaseki-Holland et al., 2010; Manaseki-Holland et al., 2012) measured serum vitamin D levels either prior to administering vitamin D supplementation or after administration. Without these data, the participants' initial vitamin D status and the impact of supplementation are unknown.
