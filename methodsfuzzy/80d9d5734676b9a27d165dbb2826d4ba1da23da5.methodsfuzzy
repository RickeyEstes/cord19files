Laboratory tests were performed at the Department of Pathology, Singapore General Hospital. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on conjunctival, throat, stool, and urine specimens with the RealArt HPA-coronavirus RT-PCR kit (Artus Gmbh, Hamburg, Germany) on the Roche Lightcycler (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, IN), a real-time PCR instrument. This assay targeted the polymerase gene of SARS-CoV. All positive results were verified, with two other primer pairs also targeted at the polymerase gene of SARS-CoV. The first were primers designed by the Genome Institute of Singapore (7), the second were Cor 1/2 primers from the Government Virus Unit, Hong Kong (sense 5′ CAC CGT TTC TAC AGG TTA GCT AAC GA 3′, antisense 5′ AAA TGT TTA CGC AGG TAA GCG TAA AA 3′) (8). Detection limit was set at 1 copy/µL of specimen. Serum specimens were tested for total virusspecific antibodies with an indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with SARS-CoV lysate as the antigen (9) . Positive serum samples were retested for immunoglobulin (Ig) G by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells spotted onto microscope slides.
