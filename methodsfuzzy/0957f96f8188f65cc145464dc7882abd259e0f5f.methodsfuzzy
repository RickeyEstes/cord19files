Sources of data As part of a larger study on transmission of influenza viruses in households, we recruited patients from primary-care outpatient clinics in private and public sectors across Hong Kong who met our inclusion criteria, including: (a) being a Hong Kong resident; (b) presenting with at least two symptoms of ARI, including a body temperature of 37.8°C, headache, sore throat, cough, runny nose, sputum, and myalgia; (c) onset of symptoms within the preceding 48 h; and (d) living in a household with at least two other people, none of whom had reported ARI in the preceding 14 days. All consenting subjects completed a short data collection form, and had two sets of pooled nasal and throat swab specimens collected by a trained nurse. One specimen was stored immediately in viral transport medium for subsequent virological testing; the other specimen was tested on site with the QuickVue Influenza A + B rapid diagnostic test (Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA). Subjects with a positive rapid test result and their household contacts were further followed up [6] , but, in the present analysis, we also analysed laboratory results from the other specimen from all subjects, regardless of their rapid test result. Proxy written informed consent was obtained for all participants from their parents or legal guardians, with additional written consent being obtained from those aged 8-16 years. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hong Kong University. Weekly meteorological data, such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation, were obtained from the Hong Kong Observatory. Each pooled nasal and throat swab specimen was stored in viral transport medium (5% bovine serum albumin in Earle's balanced salt solution with antibiotic), kept at 2-8°C immediately after collection, and cryopreserved at −70°C within 36 h. The specimens were tested for eight common respiratory viruses (including types and subtypes), namely IFVA (subtypes H1 and H3), influenza virus B (IFVB), RSV (subtypes A and B), PIV (types 1-4), metapneumovirus (MPV), enterovirus (EnV)/RhV, AdV, bocavirus (BoV), and coronavirus (CoV) (types NL63, HKU1, 229E, and OC43), with the xTAG RVP FAST version 2.0 multiplex assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), and this was followed by product detection and identification with a Luminex suspension microarray [7] . Total nucleic acid was extracted from the clinical specimens with the NucliSens easyMAG extraction system (bioMerieux, Zaltbommel, The Netherlands), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted nucleic acid was tested for respiratory viruses.
