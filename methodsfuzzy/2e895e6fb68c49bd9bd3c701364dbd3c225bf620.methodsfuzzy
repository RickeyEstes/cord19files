A549 and Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells are maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and rich organic medium, respectively. Chicken embryo fibroblasts cells are prepared as previously described and maintained in minimum essential medium. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, minimum essential medium, and rich organic medium are supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml penicillin.
