The overall approach is to use data fusion to combine various data sources to project age-and location-specific contact rates for a spectrum of countries in different stages of development and with different demographic structures. Fig 1 gives an overview of the data sources discussed in the following section, and the major steps of the modelling framework described in the sections that follow that. The countries (n = 152, 95.9% of the world's population) are categorized into (i) POLYMOD, (ii) Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), and (iii) Rest of the World (ROW) countries, which are illustrated on the world map. Data availability, as used in our study, varies across the country categories: with POLYMOD having the most data available and the ROW countries having the least. The quality of the data from the same source is consistent across countries. The modelling framework starts with a Bayesian hierarchical model (A) built for the POLYMOD contact data. This model estimates age-and location-specific contact rates for the POLYMOD countries collectively and independently. The ensuing subsections detail the methodology adopted to construct age-structured populations at home, work, and school (B) is combined with the population age structure and the POLYMOD aggregated estimates to get the global projections (C). Internal validation using leave-one-out validation was conducted to verify that the household age matrices describing household structure could be reverse-engineered for countries (POLYMOD and DHS) for which empirical household age matrices were available. Not featured in this flowchart are the external validation and an example application (i.e. age-specific Susceptible-Infected-Removed modelling) that demonstrates the potential utility of these projections.
