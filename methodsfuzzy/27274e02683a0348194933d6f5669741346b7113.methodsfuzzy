Data We obtain the 2009 pH1N1 data for Argentina, Chile, and Brazil used in this study from the respective Ministries of Health of Argentina, 4 Chile, 5 and Brazil 6 websites. The New Zealand data were accessed from the Institute of Environmental Science and Research of New Zealand website. 7 The Australian data were obtained from Department of Health and Ageing website. 8 The South Africa data were accessed from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) website. 9 Methods Richards 10 proposed the following model to study the growth of biologic populations:  Here, the prime '¢' denotes the derivative or time rate of change and the time unit is in days or epidemiological weeks (or e-weeks that start on Sunday and end on Saturdays), depending on the time unit of the data used. C(t) is the cumulative number of cases (confirmed, hospitalization, or death) at time unit (day or week) t, K is the 'maximum' case number or the final outbreak size over a single wave of outbreak, r is the per capita growth rate of the cumulative number of cases, while a is an exponent of deviation of the epidemiologic curve. The solution of Richards model can be explicitly given in terms of its model parameters and the initial value C(0) as CðtÞ ¼ K½1 þ e ÀrðtÀt m Þ À1=a . The parameter t m is related to the turning point t i (defined as the time when the rate of case accumulation changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa) of the epidemic by the simple formula t m = t i + (ln a) ⁄ r, where ln denotes the natural logarithm function. By fitting cumulative case data of a particular outbreak, these four quantities, namely, the growth rate r, carrying capacity K, inflection point t i , and exponent of deviation a of the model, can be obtained simultaneously using standard software such as MATLAB or SAS. In this model formulation, the basic reproduction number R 0 is given by the formula R 0 ¼ exp ðrTÞ, where T is the disease generation time (or generation interval) defined as the average time interval from one person being infected to the time when an infection by this infected individual occur. The estimation of mean generation time could be difficult because it is often impractical to report observed generation time, and sophisticated statistical procedures have been developed to attain this goal (see e.g., 11, 12 ) . Moreover, it has been shown mathematically 11 that, given the growth rate r, the expression R 0 ¼ exp ðrTÞ provides the upper bound of basic reproduction number regardless of the distribution of the generation interval that is being used. In the case where there is little prior human immunity for the virus under consideration, the estimate for R 0 approximates the number of infections caused by an infectious individual entering an immunologically naïve population. Readers are referred to [13] [14] [15] for more technical details regarding the Richards model. The basic premise of the Richards model is that the incidence curve of a single wave of infections consists of a single peak of high incidence, resulting in an S-shaped cumulative epidemic curve with a single turning point for the outbreak. The turning point t i can be easily pinpointed by locating the inflection point of the cumulative case curve, i.e., the moment at which the trajectory begins to decline. This quantity in time has obvious epidemiologic importance, indicating either the beginning of a new wave of infections (i.e., moment of acceleration after deceleration) or the end of the current wave of infections (i.e., moment of deceleration after acceleration). One of the advantages in using the Richards model for mathematical modeling is to fit the accumulative case number, which helps to smooth out the stochastic variations in epidemic curve owing to variations in data collection. When there are indeed two or more waves of infections, a variation of the S-shaped Richards model has been proposed, 14 which distinguishes between two types of turning points: one in the initial S curve that signifies the first turning point that ends initial exponential growth (or a downturn in case number) and a second type of turning point in the epidemic curve where the growth rate of the number of cumulative cases begin to increase again (or a upturn in case number), signifying the beginning of the next wave of infections. This variation of the Richards model provides a systematic method of determining whether an outbreak is 1-wave or multi-wave in nature, and is designed to isolate the main turning points from those peaks and valleys resulting from the data stochasticity. More details on the multi-wave Richards model can be found in, [14] [15] [16] where 2003 SARS incidence curves for the Great Toronto Area and Singapore are shown to contain two peaks (local maximum or turning point of the first type) and one valley (local minimum or turning point of second type). The readers are also referred to 14 for its application to 2-wave dengue outbreak in Taiwan in 2007. We note that the estimates of R 0 should be valid for the new H1N1 strain, although discrepancy might exist because of prior immunity. 17 Moreover, no mass intervention measures (e.g., community-level isolation ⁄ quarantine ⁄ closure) were implemented at any time during the course of the outbreaks, although some measures were taken in each country with varying degrees of impact. To be conservative in our conclusions, we will henceforth denote the reproduction number obtained here as the effective reproduction number R of the outbreak in question.
