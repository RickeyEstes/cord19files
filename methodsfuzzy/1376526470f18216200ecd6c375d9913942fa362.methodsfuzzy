PdCV-positive specimens. In early January 2014, an outbreak of TGEVand PEDV-like disease was reported in several pig farms in Ohio; mortality rates ranged from 40 to 80%. Intestinal contents and feces were collected from a 7-day-old piglet with severe diarrhea and vomiting. Five grams of feces and intestine contents was homogenized in 50 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The suspension was centrifuged at 5,000 ϫ g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and filtered through 0.45-m and 0.22-mpore-size filters. The filtered intestinal contents were negative for any bacteria or fungal growth when they were cultured on LB plates and medium in both anaerobic and aerophilic conditions. RNA extraction, RT-PCR, and deep sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from feces and intestinal contents using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Primers were designed to target the N gene based on the sequence of the U.S. PEDV Colorado strain (accession number KF272920), the conserved regions of the Miller M6 and M60, Purdue P115, and virulent Purdue TGEVs (accession numbers DQ811785, DQ811786, DQ811788, and DQ811789, respectively), PRCV (accession number DQ811787), and PdCV Hong Kong strain HKU15-44 (accession number JQ065042). Primers were also designed to target the VP1 gene of porcine rotavirus types A and C, porcine norovirus, and porcine sapovirus. RT-PCR was performed using a one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen), and the PCR products were visualized in 1% agarose gels. Based upon the genomic sequence of strain HKU15-44 (15), eight sets of primers were designed to amplify the full-length genome of the PdCV Ohio CVM1 strain. RT-PCR was performed using a one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). The PCR products were purified and sequenced at The Ohio State University Plant Microbe Genetics Facility. The total RNA of filtered intestinal contents was also submitted for Illumina TruSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA) library preparation and nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) on Illumina MiSeq (Illumina) at the University of Minnesota Genomics Center, Minneapolis, MN. Using a template assembly (SeqMan NGen, DNASTAR version 11; Madison, WI), the PdCV sequences were assembled using the full-length genome of the U.S. PdCV MI strain. Piglets. The animal protocol used in this study was approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University (IACUC-OSU). Gnotobiotic (Gn) piglets were derived in a sterile environment via caesarean section from a specific-pathogen-free gravid sow as previously described (33) and housed in germfree isolation units. Piglets were fed a milk-replacement diet (Permalat) and maintained as described elsewhere (33) . Ten-day-old healthy conventional piglets were purchased from Hartley Farm, Circleville, OH. These piglets were seronegative for major porcine diseases, including PdCV, PEDV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TEGV), porcine circovirus (PCV), and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Animal experiment 1: Gn piglets challenged with Ohio CVM intestinal contents. Five 19-day-old Gn piglets were randomly divided into two groups. Two piglets in group 1 served as uninfected controls. The three piglets in group 2 were infected with PdCV. Prior to oral challenge, preinoculation fecal and oronasal swabs and blood for serum were collected for virus detection from the three piglets of group 2. Piglets were pretreated with parenteral ranitidine (25 mg/kg of body weight). The three piglets in group 2 were orally challenged with 5.0 ml of filter-sterilized intestinal contents from the PdCV-positive piglet described above, representing 10 6 genomic RNA copies of PdCV Ohio CVM1. The two piglets in group 1 were challenged with 5 ml of filtersterilized intestinal contents from normal piglets, negative for known porcine viruses. Animal experiment 2: Gn piglets challenged with the PdCV MI strain. Eight 10-day-old Gn piglets were randomly divided into two isolators. There were a total of 5 Gn piglets (C1 to C5) in isolator 1, and each piglet was housed in an enclosure that prevented direct animal-to-animal contact (Fig. 7A ). Three piglets (C1, C3, and C5) in isolator 1 were orally challenged with 5 ml of DMEM containing 10 6 PFU of the PdCV MI strain. The remaining two piglets (C2 and C4) in isolator 1 did not receive any treatment. This experiment was designed to determine whether PdCV can be transmitted from the virus-inoculated piglets to the uninoculated piglets. In isolator 2, three piglets were orally inoculated with 5 ml of DMEM and served as uninfected controls. Animal experiment 3: conventional piglets challenged with the PdCV MI strain. Eight 10-day-old conventional piglets were randomly divided into two groups (4 piglets/group) and were housed in two separate rooms. Piglets in group 1 were orally inoculated with 5 ml of DMEM and served as uninfected controls. Piglets in group 2 were orally challenged with 5 ml of DMEM containing 10 6 PFU of the PdCV MI strain. Pig challenge, sampling, and tissue collections. After virus challenge, the piglets were observed and evaluated daily for body weight and temperature changes and clinical signs of PdCV infection. Daily rectal mucosal/fecal swabs were collected from each piglet for virus detection. A diarrhea/fecal consistency score was assigned to each using a subjective scale wherein 0 is normal, 1 is pasty, 2 is creamy, and 3 is watery. Pigs with fecal consistency scores of 2 or 3 were scored as diarrhea-positive. Prior to termination, a blood sample for serum was collected from heavily sedated piglets; each piglet received Euthol solution intravenously to effect. Intestinal contents from the duodenum, proximal jejunum, ileum, transverse colon, spiral colon, and descending colon were collected from each pig. Whole blood and serum were collected first postmortem, followed by collection of duplicate tissues for RNA analysis and histological examination. The tissues sampled were glandular stomach, duodenum, proximal jejunum, distal jejunum, ileum, cecum, spiral colon, terminal colon, spleen, liver, kidney, and lung. Quantification of viral RNAs by RT-qPCR. Feces and intestinal contents were diluted 1:5 in DMEM and centrifuged at 5,000 ϫ g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected for viral RNA extraction. The total RNA was extracted by using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription (RT) was conducted using a primer (5= TTTT GCTCCATCCCCCCTATAAGC 3=) targeting the 3=-end UTR of PdCV and the Superscript III transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The RT products were then used to perform real-time PCR using primers and probes specifically targeting the N gene of PdCV (forward, 5= CGCTTAA CTCCGCCATCAA 3=; reverse, 5= TCTGGTGTAACGCAGCCAGTA 3=; probe, 5= 6FAM-CCCGTTGAAAACC-MGB 3= [6FAM is 6-carboxyfluorescein] [Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA]) in a StepOne realtime PCR system (Applied Biosystems). A standard plasmid for PdCV was constructed by inserting the sequence of the entire PdCV N gene into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Amplification cycles used were 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C, and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. The threshold for detection of fluorescence above the background was set within the exponential phase of the amplification curves. For each assay, 10-fold dilutions of standard plasmid were generated, and negativecontrol samples and double-distilled water (ddH 2 O) were included in each assay. Histology. Tissue samples of intestine, stomach, lung, kidney, spleen, and liver were fixed in 10% (vol/vol) phosphate-buffered formalin for 24 to 36 h, dehydrated in graded ethanol, embedded in paraffin, cut in 5-m sections, and mounted onto glass slides. The sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Slides were examined by conventional light microscopy. Immunohistochemical staining. Five-micron sections of paraffinembedded tissues were placed onto positively charged slides. After deparaffinization, sections were incubated with target retrieval solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) for antigen retrieval. After blocking, a primary anti-PdCV serum antibody from PdCV-infected convalescent sows was incubated for 30 min at 22°C, followed by incubation with a biotinylated horse anti-pig IgG secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Slides were further incubated with the ABC Elite complex to probe biotin (Vector Laboratories) and then developed using a 3,3=diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen kit (Dako); hematoxylin was used as a counterstain. Tissue sections from PdCV-infected and uninfected samples were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Tissue sections from PdCV-infected and uninfected samples were incubated with hyperimmune serum against PEDV in the immunohistochemical staining (IHC) assay. Reciprocally, IHC assays were also performed using intestinal tissue sections from PEDV-infected samples using anti-PdCV serum antibody. Genome analysis. The nucleotide sequences of the genomes and the amino acid sequences of the open reading frames (ORFs) were compared to those of other CoVs using DNASTAR software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI). Phylogenetic tree construction was performed using the neighbor-joining method with the MEGA 6 program. Protein family analysis was performed using Pfam and InterProScan. Virus strains used for sequence and phylogenetic analysis and accession numbers are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The complete genome sequence of the PdCV Ohio CVM1 has been deposited in GenBank under accession no. KJ769231.
