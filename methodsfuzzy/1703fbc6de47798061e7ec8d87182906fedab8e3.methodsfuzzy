Study design and participants. The cohort for this study consisted of 30 CWs from Riyadh New Camel Market and 44 healthy controls recruited in Riyadh, KSA, and Iowa, USA. CWs were selected randomly, with the goal of including camel herders, handlers, and truck drivers. Camel herders feed, water, medicate, and milk camels. Camel handlers restrain, tighten (bind camels with ropes to prevent ambulation), and transport camels and have short but intense interactions with camels. Drivers help handlers and herders load camels into trucks. CWs control camels by placing their bare hands in the mouths of camels to avoid being bitten. Control samples of PBMCs were obtained from 14 anonymous donors at the University of Iowa and from 8 health care workers in KSA with no history of MERS exposure. Study approval. The Institutional Review Board at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Jeddah (KFSHRC-J), KSA, approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Clinical information. CW demographic and clinical data were obtained by one of the corresponding authors (A. N. Alagaili) at the time of blood collection, using a written questionnaire. Virus and cells. The EMC/2012 strain of MERS-CoV (passage 11, designated MERS-CoV) was provided by Bart Haagmans and Ron Fouchier (Erasmus Medical Center). All work with infectious MERS-CoV was conducted in the University of Iowa biosafety level 3 (BSL3) Laboratory. Serological testing. Blood was collected from CWs in Riyadh New Camel Market (Fig. 1) at ambient temperatures as high as 45°C and was transported to King Abdullah International Medical Research Center in Riyadh. Temperatures were maintained at approximately 25°C during collection and transportation. PBMCs and sera were prepared from whole blood. Serum anti-MERS-CoV antibody titers were quantified by ELISA, immunofluorescence assay, and 50% plaque reduction/neutralization titer (PRNT 50 ) assay (16) . ELISA and IFA were performed as described previously, using commercially available kits (Euroimmun Medizinische Labordiagnotika AG) (16) . The ELISA for MERS-CoV S-specific antibody was read as positive (Ͼ1.1), negative (Ͻ0.8), or borderline (0.8 to 1.1). For 50% plaque reduction/neutralization titer (PRNT 50 ) assays, serum samples were serially diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and mixed with an equal volume of MERS-CoV (EMC/2012) containing 80 PFU. Following incubation at 37°C for 1 h, aliquots were added to cultures of Vero 81 cells in 12-well plates and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 1 h. Virus titers were determined as previously described (16) . Assays for PRNT 50 were repeated at least two times for each serum sample, with identical results. We considered sera to be positive if the PRNT 50 was greater than 1:20. PBMCs were prepared from blood using Lympholyte-H (Cedarlane) as per the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were stored in liquid nitrogen prior to and during shipping to the University of Iowa, where the cells were analyzed. For surface staining, 10 5 to 10 6 cells were blocked with Fc receptorblocking solution, labeled with live/dead staining dye (Thermo Fisher), and then stained with the indicated antibodies at 4°C. For in vitro intracellular cytokine staining, 4 ϫ 10 5 to 10 ϫ 10 5 cells/well were cultured in 96-well dishes at 37°C for 12 h in the presence of 2 M peptide (GL Biochem, Shanghai) and brefeldin A (BFA; BD Biosciences). Cells were then labeled for cell surface markers, fixed/permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences), and labeled with anti-cytokine antibodies. All flow cytometry data were acquired on a BD FACSVerse flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). PBMCs were considered MERS-CoV experienced only if they expressed both IFN-␥ and TNF in response to peptide stimulation. This stringent approach was used for two reasons. First, the fraction of cells expressing cytokines was lower than what we observed in our previous study of MERS survivors (16) . In the case of some single-cytokine-expressing cells, levels were similar in the presence or absence of stimulation with peptide pools (e.g., Fig. 2A and C) . Measuring only IFN-␥/TNF double expressers avoided this problem. Second, cell viability was less than 90%, likely reflecting exposure to high ambient temperatures (ϳ45°C) at the time of blood drawing. For these reasons, we were unable to definitively determine whether 4 CWs were positive or negative for a MERS-CoV-specific T cell response, so we classified them as indeterminate. Statistical analysis. Fisher's exact test was used to compare differences between groups, with P values of Ͻ0.05 considered statistically significant.
