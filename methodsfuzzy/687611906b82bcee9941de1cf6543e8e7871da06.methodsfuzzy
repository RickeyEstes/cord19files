Princeton (PRI) and C3H mice have been maintained in our laboratory by inbreeding for the last 12 yr. Methods of culture of mouse peritoneal macrophages have been described previously (2) . Peritoneal washings were made 72 hr after the injection of sterile thioglycolate medium (Difco Laboratories, Inc., Detroit, Mich.) into the peritoneal cavity of mice. At that time, the number of mononuclear cells was 90-95% of the total differential cell counts in the exudate. Cultures were prepared either in glass tubes 13 X 100 mm or in 30-ml. Falcon plastic flasks (Falcon Plastics, Los Angeles, Calif.). Both were sealed with siliconized rubber stoppers. For seeding macrophages Chang's medium (4) was used. It consists of 90o-/0 inactivated horse serum, (all sera were obtained from two particular horses and harvested from clotted blood in our laboratory), 2% beef embryo extract (Baltimore Biological Laboratories, Baltimore, Md.), and 8% Hanks' balanced salt solution (BSS). 100 units of penicillin and 100 #g of streptomycin were added to each 100 ml of medium. For maintenance, Eagle's medium containing 2% commercial calf serum (Microbiological Associates, Inc., Bethesda, Md.) was used. The pH of both Chang's and Eagle's media were adjusted to 7.6 with the aid of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate.
