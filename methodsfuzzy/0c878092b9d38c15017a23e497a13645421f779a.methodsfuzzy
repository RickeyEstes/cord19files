Chest radiographs of 59 patients with probable SARS were collected from multiple sources in Asia. Each case had one or more films obtained 1 day to 3 weeks after onset of fever. The chest radiographs were from computed radiography (CR), digital radiography (DR) and film digitizers. A radiologist reviewed each film to select those that showed minimal disease. Of the 59 patients, 24 had at least one early radiograph that was considered to be either normal or to have minimal disease.
