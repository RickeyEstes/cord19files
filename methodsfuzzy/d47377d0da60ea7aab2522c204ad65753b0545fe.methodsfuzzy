We provide descriptive statistics for these data, using counts and proportions. Following methods we described previously, 21 univariate analysis was used to screen the relationships between picornavirus groups (RV-A, RV-B, RV-C or EV), season and demographic variables such as age and sex. For each virus, the probability of codetection with another virus was assessed with Fisher's exact test using 2 x 2 contingency tables. We used a threshold p value of <0.05 for a statistically significant association. Logistic regression was used to estimate any effect of age, sex, season and other circulating virus types on detection of RV.
