To the solution of 6-azido-2,3-O,O-dibenzyl-6-deoxy-L-ascorbic acid (6) (200e300 mg) in DMF (3 ml); tertbutanol (3 ml) and H 2 O (3 ml), Cu (0.8 eq), 1 M CuSO 4 solution (0.3 eq) and the corresponding alkyne (1.2 eq) were added. The reaction mixture was heated for 1 h using microwave radiation (300 W). The solvent was evaporated and the product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel and aluminium oxide. The obtained oily compound was further triturated using n-hexane to obtain white powder. To the solution of C-6 monotosylated Lascorbic acid derivative 4 (200e350 mg) in DMF (8 ml), Cu (0.8 eq), 1 M CuSO 4 solution (0.3 eq), NaN 3 (2.5 eq) dissolved in H 2 O (2 ml) and the corresponding alkyne (1.2 eq) were added. The reaction mixture was heated for 1 h using microwave radiation (300 W). The solvent was evaporated and the product was purified with column chromatography on silica gel and aluminium oxide. The obtained oily compound was further triturated using n-hexane to obtain white powder. 13
