Sputum samples were pretreated by using one of three methods. The first method involved proteinase K and DNase I treatment (PK-DNase), as recommended by the NucliSENS easy-MAG protocol (bioMérieux SA, Marcy-l'Etoile, France). One hundred microliters of proteinase K (1 mg proteinase K/1 mL proteinase K buffer; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added to 100 µL of sample and incubated for 15 min at 55°C. The samples were mixed by vortexing every 5 min. Subsequently, a 20-µL of DNase I solution (1 U/µL) was added for every 100 µL of sample, followed by incubation at 37°C for 30 min. In the second method, sputum samples were mixed with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In the third method, the sputum samples were mixed with an equal volume of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NALC) in sodium citrate solution (prepared by dissolving 0.5g NALC in each 100 mL of 1.47% sodium citrate solution). Following the second and third methods, the samples were mixed by vortexing for 1 min.
