Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following: for 30 min on ice. The supernatants were collected via centrifugation at 12000 g for 30 min at 4 C. Next, 50 mL supernatants were added with loading buffer and boiled at 100 C for 10 min. Additionally, 350 mL supernatants were precleared by adding 20 mL protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads at 4 C with rotation for 2 h. Supernatants were collected via centrifugation at 5000 g 4 C for 2 min. The indicated primary Abs and 30 mL beads were added and incubated at 4 C with rotation overnight. Beads were collected via centrifugation at 5000 g for 2 min and washed with lysis buffer three times (2 min each time). Next, beads were boiled with loading buffer at 100 C for 10 min, and the proteins were analyzed via WB. plaque assay For the plaque assay, MK2 cells were cultured in 24-well plates at a density of 70%-80% at 37 C overnight, and virus stocks were successively diluted 10-fold up to 10 5 with DMEM. Next, 400 mL dilutions were added to wells for 2 h at 37 C and 5% CO 2 . Then, the medium was replaced with methylcellulose, and cells were cultured at 37 C and 5% CO 2 for 3-4 days. Cells were stained with crystal violet, and the viral titers were calculated.
