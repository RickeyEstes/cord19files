We compared the characteristic of patients infected by different subtypes using Fisher exact test or χ 2 test for comparing proportions and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for comparing medians of continuous variables. To evaluate the association between risk factors and the risk of hospitalization, Poisson regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratios associated with each risk factor, adjusted for age and sex. The association between risk factors and the risk of death among hospitalized cases was assessed using multivariable logistic regression to estimate the odds ratios associated with each risk factor, adjusted for age and sex. In both analyses a spline function was used for age to allow for the possibly nonlinear effect of age on risk. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate survival curves for death and the hospitalized fatality risk. We used the same approach to estimate the time to invasive mechanical ventilation. The censoring time of each recovered or nonventilated patient was set to 90 days. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the cumulative proportion of subjects requiring invasive ventilation and with a fatal outcome were estimated using bootstrapping with 1000 resamples. We used maximum likelihood to estimate the distribution of the number of days of hospitalization, and compared alternative parametric distributions including γ, Weibull, and log-normal distributions, selecting the best parametric distribution on the basis of the Akaike information criterion.
