Pre-coated Merck Silica Gel 60 F-254 plates were used for thinlayer chromatography (TLC, 0.2 mm), spots were detected under UV light (254 nm (9) 9 . A mixture of diethyl (2-mesyloxyethoxy)methylphosphonate 5 (3.0 g, 10.3 mmol), sodium azide (6.72 g, 103.0 mmol) and anhydrous DMF (60 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 3 days and then evaporated to dryness under vacuum at 80°C (0.05 mmHg). The residue was diluted with water (50 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (3 Â 20 mL). The combined extracts were dried, filtered, and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure to give 9 as an oil (2.28 g, 93%). An analytical sample was obtained by column chromatography (chloroform). (10) 9 . A mixture of triphenylphosphine (4.88 g, 18.6 mmol) and dry toluene (20 mL) was cooled on an ice-water bath and a solution of 9 (2.94 g, 12.4 mmol) in dry toluene (2.5 mL) was added dropwise within 30 min. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Water was then added and stirring was continued for 15 min. The aqueous layer was separated, extracted with diethyl ether (3 Â 20 mL), and evaporated to dryness under vacuum at 80°C (0.05 mmHg) to afford 10 as an oil (2.09 g, 80%). An analytical sample was obtained by column chromatography (chloroform/ methanol, 95:5, v/v). [2-(p-toluenesulfonylamino) ethoxy]methylphosphonate (11). A mixture of 10 (2.09 g, 9. 86 mmol), triethylamine (2.0 g, 19.7 mmol, 2.8 mL) and dichloromethane (10 mL) was cooled in an ice-water bath and a solution of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (2.8 g, 14.8 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL) was then added dropwise within 15 min. The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight, diluted with dichloromethane (100 mL), washed with brine (2 Â 20 mL), and dried. The solvent was distilled off. The residue was purified by column chromatography (chloroform/acetone, 98:2?80:20, v/v) to give 11 as an oil (2.85 g, 79%) . d H (CDCl 3 , 400 MHz) 1.34 (t, 3 J H-H 7.0, 6H), 2.43 (s, 3H), 3.12-3.16 (m, 2H), 3.62-3.65 (triplet-like multiplet, 2H), 3.73 (d, 2 J H-P 8.0, 2H), 4.16 (dq, 3 J H-P 8.4, 3 J H-H 7.0, 4H), 1H, NH), 2H), 2H) . d C (CDCl 3 , 50 MHz) 16.55 (d, 3 J C-P 5.7), 21.52, 42.87, 62.54 (d, 2 J C-P 6.5), 65.33 (d, 1 J C-P 166.2), 71.98 (d, 3 J C-P 9.9), 127. 09, 129.70, 137.08, 143.40. m max (NaCl) 1162s (S@O), 1330s (S@O), 3151 m (N-H). HRMS m/z C 14 H 24 NO 6-NaPS (M+Na) + 388.0954, found 388.0951. A mixture of 5 (1.3 g, 4.5 mmol), p-toluenesulfonamide (7.67 g, 45.0 mmol), anhydrous potassium carbonate (0.62 g, 4.5 mmol), and anhydrous DMF (15 mL) was stirred at 50°C (an oil bath) for 3 days and then evaporated to dryness under vacuum at 80°C (0.05 mmHg). The residue was diluted with ethyl ether (100 mL) and filtered through a Celite pad. The filtrate was washed with water (3 Â 20 mL), dried, filtered, and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography (chloroform/acetone, 98:2?80:20, v/v) to afford 11 as an oil (1.12 g, 68%). A mixture of diethyl hydroxymethylphosphonate 6 (0.57 g, 3.4 mmol), sodium hydride (60% suspension in mineral oil, 0.14 g, 3.4 mmol) and anhydrous DMF (10 mL) was stirred in an ice-water bath for 1 h under argon atmosphere. N-(p-Toluenesulfonyl)aziridine 12 (0.34 g, 1.7 mmol) was added in one portion. After 1 day of stirring at room temperature, the mixture was poured into water (75 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 Â 20 mL). The combined extracts were washed with water (2 Â 10 mL) and dried. The low boiling solvents were distilled off under reduced pressure and residual DMF was removed under vacuum at 80°C (0.05 mmHg). The residue was purified by column chromatography (chloroform) to yield 11 as an oil (0.14 g, 23%).
