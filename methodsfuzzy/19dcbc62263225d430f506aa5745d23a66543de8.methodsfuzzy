Preparation of monocyte-derived DC and treatment with recombinant gp120 treatment (gp120-DC) Monocyte-derived DC (moDC) were generated by culture for 6-7 d in RPMI1640 supplemented with 5% autologous serum, GM-CSF and IL-4 as described [27] . The moDC were then purified by two rounds of immunomagnetic depletion (Dynabeads, Dynal, Oslo, Norway) using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CD3, CD8, CD14, CD16, CD19, and CD56 (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA, USA); the resultant HLA-DR high cell population was .98% pure (data not shown). Recombinant His-tagged gp120 ADA , and FLAG-tagged gp120 BAL and gp120 HXBc2 , were prepared as described [27] ; each contained ,5 EU/ml LPS by Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. 1610 5 moDC were cultured in 6-well tissue culture plates (Corning Life Sciences Corp., USA) at 37uC for 24 h in culture medium as described [27] with 50 nM recombinant R5 (HIV-1 ADA and HIV-1 BAL ), or X4 (HIV-1 HXBc2 ) gp120. Before use, the gp120 was cross-linked by incubating for 24 h at 37uC with respective anti-His (mouse IgG2a isotype) or anti-FLAG (mouse IgG1 isotype) mAbs (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at a molar ratio 2:1 (gp120 vs anti-His or anti-FLAG mAb), resulting final cross-linked gp120 of 25 nM. Therefore, gp120 was used in an immune-complex rather than monomeric form, unless otherwise stated. In experiments to remove the carbohydrate moieties of gp120 by enzymatic digestion, we pre-treated the monomeric recombinant gp120 with endo-b-N-glucosaminidase H (EndoH; New England Biolabs, Cambridge, Mass, USA) by incubating recombinant gp120 supernatant with 25 KU of EndoH/ml for 16-18 hours, as described [39] . The extent of deglycosylation was then examined and confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using polyclonal rabbit anti-gp120 antibodies (Fig. S2A ). We then crosslinked the EndoH-treated monomeric gp120 (which had poly-His or FLAG at the COOH terminus) with anti-His or anti-FLAG Ab to form immune-complex (dimeric) gp120, as described above. The cross-linked EndoH-treated and -untreated gp120 were further examined by Western blot analysis in native non-reducing conditions, confirming the dimerization after addition of anti-His or anti-FLAG Ab (Fig. S2B) . The binding of Endo-treated anduntreated dimeric gp120 to moDC was subsequently compared by flow cytometry, demonstrating that EndoH-treated gp120 had lost the binding to moDC (Fig. S2C) .
