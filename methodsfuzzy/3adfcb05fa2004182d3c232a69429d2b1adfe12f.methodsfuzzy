The green synthesis method based on green chemistry programs is known as the representative environment-friendly synthesis method. To avoid the use or discharge of hazardous chemical substances to a considerable extent during the synthesis of chemical compounds, green chemistry programs were proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States (EPA) in 1990. Then, in 1998, Anastas and Warner published the "Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry", summarizing the concept of green chemistry [21] . Since then, policies concerning the handling of environment-friendly chemical substances have been announced worldwide. Moreover, green sustainable chemistry advocates for resource savings by recycling, which is not necessarily covered by green chemistry. This consideration has also become widespread in the materials science field, and reports on the green synthesis of Ag NPs have increased. The components of these materials such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) are capable of reducing Ag salts (silver ions) into Ag NPs. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent reductase can produce Ag NPs by enzymatic reduction; however, the enzymatic reduction rate is often slow [22] . Some biological materials using green synthesis methods using bacteria [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , fungi [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , and plant [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] are shown in Table 1 . Among the available green methods of synthesis for Ag NPs, utilization of plant extracts is a rather simple and easy process to produce nanoparticles at large scale relative to bacteria and/or fungi mediated synthesis [43] . Several studies have discussed the synthetic conditions, such as pH and reaction temperature, that promote the synthesis of Ag NPs [16] . With regard to pH, polysaccharides and proteins related to the reaction are denatured under strongly acidic conditions; thus, neutral or slightly alkaline conditions are desirable [44, 45] . Regarding the temperature of the reaction system, the amount of reactant consumed remarkably increases at high temperatures, yielding nanoparticles [46] . The diameter of the Ag NPs is known to influence the microbicidal effect [15, 17] . The bactericidal activity is stronger when the particle size is smaller [47] . Therefore, an adequate synthesis method is required to generate small-size particles (<10 nm) with small dispersions. Ishihara et al. reported that when synthesizing Ag NPs by common autoclaving using commercially available glass powders containing silver nitrate as a silver ion supplier and glucose as a reducing agent, the particle size can be controlled easily depending on the glucose concentration. Ag NPs of 5 Â± 1 nm can be efficiently Figure 2 . Environment-friendly method for Ag NP synthesis with the diameters control by glucose concentration. We have reported that environment-friendly processes were used to produce small Ag NPs (<10 nm) within a narrow size distribution. The diameters of generated Ag NPs were easily controlled by glucose concentrations [14] . Some chemical methods for the synthesis of Ag NPs include chemical reduction [12, [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] , electrochemical synthesis [55] [56] [57] , the irradiation-assisted method [58] [59] [60] [61] , and the pyrolysis method [62, 63] , as summarized in Table 2 . Table 2 . Some chemical methods for synthesizing Ag NPs. Chemical reduction <50 Hydrogen peroxide was used as reducing agent [12] . 7.6-13.11 Sodium borohydride was used as reducing agent [49] . 7, 29, 89 Gallic acid was used as reducing agent [50] . Briefly, nanoparticles are synthesized using a physical method that physically pulverizes a metal [22, 69, 70] . Compared to chemical methods, thin films and the uniformity of nanoparticles distribution can be prepared with the absence of solvent contamination; however, a stable high energy over a long time should be supplied in physical methods to produce a high yield of Ag NPs of uniform size, and require large space for equipment. Evaporation/vapor condensation [22, 71, 72] , arc discharge [73] , and energy ball milling [74] are some of the commonly used methods for synthesizing nanoparticles. Tien et al. reported the synthesis of 20-30 nm diameter of Ag NPs via arc discharge with no added surfactants [73] . The fabrication consumes silver rods at a rate of 100 mg/min, yielding metallic silver nanoparticle and ionic silver with concentrations of approximately 11 ppm and 19 ppm, respectively. Nakamura et al. developed a simple and rapid synthesis technique (20-min irradiation), via laser irradiation of an aqueous solution of inorganic ions for nanoparticles synthesis [75] . As a result, antibacterial calcium phosphate sub-microspheres containing Ag NPs expected to be useful in dental healthcare and infection control were produced with one-pot fabrication.
