Viruses PEDV LNsy201401 was isolated from intestinal tissue of piglets; and its M gene was sequenced (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). PEDV was propagated in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells according to reference with modification [21, 22] . The median tissue culture infective dose per milliliter (TCID 50 /ml) of PEDV was 10 5.0 . Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine rotavirus (PRV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine parvovirus (PPV), and pseudorabies virus (PrV) were propagated in susceptible cells. Swine influenza virus (SIV, H1N1) was propagated in the allantoic sac and amniotic cavity of 9-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos for 48 to 72 hours at 37Â°C [23, 24] .
