Twenty patients were transported using stretchers, 6 used prestige ( Table 2 ) accommodations, 2 traveled by ship, and 5 traveled by air ambulance. All 6 patients who were transported using prestige accommodations, all 2 who were transported via ship, 18 (90%) of those transported via stretcher, and 2 (40%) of the air ambulance patients had suffered traumas (P = .043). Cerebral injury was more frequent in patients transported via stretcher (60%), ship (100%), and air ambulance (60%), and fractures were more frequent in patients using prestige accommodations (66.7%). In terms of consciousness, 11 (55%) stretcher patients and 6 (100%) of those who traveled using prestige accommodations were alert, whereas 2 (100%) of those transported via ship exhibited pain responses only and 2 (40%) of those transported via air ambulance were unresponsive (P = .003). Conservative management in intensive care units was provided for 8 (40%) stretcher patients, 4 (80%) air ambulance patients, and 1 (50%) ship patient; 5 (83.8%) patients who used prestige accommodation were treated with ward procedures only. The need for a ventilator was the most common reason for use of an air ambulance (80% of patients) (P = .001). In terms of hospitalization duration, 9 (45%) stretcher patients, 3 (50%) of those using prestige accommodations, 2 (100%) traveling by ship, and 4 (80%) transporting via air ambulance patients had hospital stays of 1 to 2 weeks; these proportions did not differ significantly (P = .429). In terms of transport time after contact with domestic medical staff, the times for stretcher patients, and those using prestige accommodations were similar. However, ship transfer required <4 days for 1 and >8 days for the other patient, and air ambulance required 5 to 7 days for 3 (60%) patients and >8 days for 2 (40%). Our comparison of the transport costs among similar distance locations, measured (Fig. 2) by Korean Air flight time, revealed that ship travel was the least expensive (6832 US Dollars [USD]) and that the difference between the costs of air travel involving stretchers (11,543 USD) and that involving prestige accommodations (11,813 USD) was minimal. The air ambulance was the most expensive mode of transportation (61,124 USD) (P = .001). The mean duration of flight was the fastest (2 hours for both stretcher and prestige) and air ambulance was 6 hours. Ship took the longest transport time with mean duration of 14 hours (P = .0023).
