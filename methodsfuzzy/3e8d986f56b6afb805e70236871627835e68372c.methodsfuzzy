The objective of our methodology is to generate a progressive allocation of the total resource availability over a network of regional outbreaks. The methodology incorporates (i) a cross-regional simulation model, (ii) a set of single-region simulation models, and (iii) an embedded optimization model. We consider a network of regions with each of which classified as either unaffected, ongoing outbreak, or contained outbreak ( Figure 1) . The cross-regional simulation model connects the regions by air and land travel. The single-region simulation models mimic the population and disease dynamics of each ongoing region, impacted by intervention measures. The pandemic can spread from ongoing to unaffected regions by infectious travelers who pass through regional border control. At every new regional outbreak epoch, the optimization model allocates available resources to the new outbreak region (actual distribution) and unaffected regions (virtual distribution). Daily statistics is collected for each ongoing region, including the number of infected, deceased, and quarantined cases, for different age groups. As a regional outbreak is contained, its societal and economic costs are calculated. In Sections 2.1-2.3, we present the details of the simulation and optimization models. A testbed illustration and a comparison of our strategy to the myopic policy is given in Section 3.
