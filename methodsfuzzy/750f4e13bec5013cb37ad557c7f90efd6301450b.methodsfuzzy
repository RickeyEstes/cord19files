Identification of the trypsin cleavage site by amino acid sequence analysis Virus purification was carried out with modification as described by Sturman et a/. (1980, 1985) . Purified 90A and 90B proteins were prepared from trypsintreated virions and the 180K E2 protein was prepared from untreated virus. Following incubation with tr-ypsin, 10 pg/ml, in TMEN, pH 6.5 (50 ml\/l Tris-maleate, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCI), at 37' for 30 min, soybean trypsin inhibitor, 50 pg/ml, was added for 30 min at 4'. Virus was then sedimented at 24,000 rpm in an SW 28 rotor at 4" for 2.5 hr. E2 was extracted with Triton X-l 14, and 90A and 90B were separated as described previously by HPLC on HPHT (hydroxyapatite) columns in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) . Uncleaved (180K) E2 was separated from 90K species by HPLC size exclusion chromatography with a Bio-Sil TSK (Bio-Rad) guard column and Bio-Sil TSK 400, 7.5 X 300 mm, and Spherogel TSK 4000 (Altex), 7.5 x 300 mm, columns connected in series. SDS was removed from purified proteins by ion pair extraction with acetone:triethylamine:acetic acid:water, 85:5:5:5 (Henderson eta/., 1979) . Proteins were washed with trifluoroacetic acid, lyophylized, and dissolved in trifluoracetic acid. The amino terminal sequence was determined by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems gas phase sequencer. Phenylthiohydantoyn (PTH) amino acids were identified by HPLC. cDNA synthesis and cloning Viral genomic RNA and poly(A)-containing intracellular RNAs were isolated from purified MHV-A59 .virions and infected cells, respectively . Procedures for synthesis of cDNA were essentially identical to those described by Dowling (1983) and Gubler and Hoffman (1983) . For the synthesis of the single-stranded cDNA, pentanucjeotides and specific primere were used. Full details will be presented elsewhere (P. J. Bredenbeek et a/., manuscript in preparation). After homopolymer tailing of the double-stranded cDNA (Peacock, 1981) or digestion with restriction en-donucleases, the cDNA was annealed to dG-tailed pUC9 DNA (Pharmacia) or ligated to pEMBL DNA (Dente et a/., 1983) respectively. Transformation was carried out by adding the annealed or ligated DNA to Escherichia co/i strain JM 101 or JM 109 competent cells (Messing, 1983) , prepared by the method described by Hanahan (1983) which were subsequently plated on petri dishes containing 25 pg/ml ampicillin.
