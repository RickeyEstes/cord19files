Ethics statement and animals used. The methods used in the present study were approved by the Iowa State University IACUC (log number 1-13-7490-G). Fayoumi (M 15.2) and Leghorn (GHs 6) chicken lines from Iowa State University Poultry Farm (Ames, IA) were used in this study. The Fayoumis and Leghorns each have an inbreeding coefficient of Ͼ99.9%, as determined by microsatellites (50) , and 99.95%, as determined by resequencing (51) . The Fayoumi line originated from the Fayoum region of Egypt, whereas the Leghorn line is representative of chickens from the U.S. egg-laying industry of the 1950s. The chickens were given ad libitum access to water and feed throughout the study. Supplemental heat at 35°C was provided to the birds starting on the day of hatch, and the temperature was stepped down 2 to 3°C every few days until it reached 24°C when the chicks were 29 days of age and remained at 24°C for the remainder of the study. The light cycle began at 23 h of light and 1 h of dark on the day of hatch, and the number of hours of light was gradually reduced until it reached 13.5 h of light when the chicks were 24 days of age and remained at that amount for the remainder of the study. Virus. A live attenuated Newcastle disease vaccine, the type B1 La Sota lentogenic strain, was propagated once in 10-day-old embryonated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs inoculated via the allantoic sac (52) . The allantoic fluid was harvested after 2 days, tested for virus presence by determination of hemagglutinating activity (HA), and centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 30 min to clear the debris. Virus titration was performed in SPF embryonated eggs as previously described (53) . The final titer of the undiluted virus suspension was 10 8 50% embryo infectious dose (EID 50 ) per ml. The virus suspension was aliquoted and stored at Ϫ80°C until its use. Experimental design. At the time of hatch, straight run chickens of both lines were randomly assigned to one of four rooms in a biosafety level II facility. At 21 days of age, half of the chickens (two rooms, n ϭ 49) were inoculated with 200 l of 10 7 EID 50 of La Sota NDV, with 50 l being inoculated into each of the eyes and nostrils. The nonchallenged group (2 rooms, n ϭ 40) was given 200 l phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), via the same route, as a mock infection. Chickens that received the La Sota virus are referred to throughout this article as "challenged," and those that received the mock infection are referred to as "nonchallenged." To collect lachrymal fluid prechallenge (n ϭ 89) and at times of 2 (n ϭ 89) and 6 (n ϭ 62) dpi, fine, crystalline sodium chloride was placed on the eye of each chick to collect lachrymal fluid with a pipette. To quantify antibody levels, venous blood samples were collected prechallenge and at 10 dpi. At 2, 6, and 10 dpi, 24, 30, and 35 chicks, respectively, were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital solution for tissue harvest. The entire trachea was harvested from all of the challenged and nonchallenged birds sacrificed at each dpi and placed into RNAlater solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for short-term storage. Within a week, the sheet of epithelial cells from each trachea was carefully removed by peeling it from the interior surface of the trachea with forceps. This epithelial cell lining was placed into a Ϫ80°C freezer for long-term storage, and the remaining tissue was discarded. NDV antibody. Blood samples collected prechallenge and at 10 dpi were centrifuged at 15 rpm for 5 min to collect the serum supernatant. Serum NDV antibody levels were measured using an Idexx NDV ELISA for chickens (Idexx Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME). The sample-to-positive (S/P) ratio was calculated by subtracting the negative-control value from the average absorption value for each sample and dividing that value by the positive-control value minus the negative-control value. The positive and negative controls were supplied with the Idexx kit. The S/P ratio was calculated from the average absorbance value for each sample, which was run in duplicate. A standard least-squares, effect leverage analysis in JMP (JMP Group Inc., San Francisco, CA) including the main effects of line, treatment, and line · treatment was used; a Student t test generated the connecting letters report. Both tests are parametric. Viral load. Viral RNA was isolated from the chicken lachrymal fluid collected prechallenge and at 2 and 6 dpi using a MagMAX-96 viral RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and was quantified using an LSI VetMAX Newcastle disease virus real-time PCR kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) on an MJ Research Opticon2 qPCR machine (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The primers were directed against the matrix protein (M) gene, and dilutions of inoculum virus were used as standards. The log copy number per 1 l of isolated viral RNA was calculated for the mean for each sample, which was run in duplicate. Using JMP statistical software (JMP Group Inc., San Francisco, CA), a standard least-squares, effect leverage test including the main effects of line, dpi, and line · dpi was performed to determine significance, and a Student t test was utilized to generate a connecting letters report. The log copy number of the NDV genome does not show the number of infectious particles. RNA isolation and cDNA library construction. RNA was isolated from the tracheal epithelial cells using an RNAqueous kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and samples were then treated with DNase using a DNA-free kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The quality of all samples was validated (RNA quality number Ͼ 8.0) using the Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Ankeny, IA). A 500-ng input for each sample was utilized to construct the cDNA library using the high-throughput protocol in the TruSeq RNA sample preparation guide (v2; Illumina, San Diego, CA). Following cDNA library validation using the Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Ankeny, IA), samples were sequenced on a HiSeq2500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA) for 100-bp, single-end reads (DNA Facility, Iowa State University, Ames, IA). RNA-seq design. This study included 3 main factors: treatment (challenged, nonchallenged), line (Leghorn, Fayoumi), and time (2, 6, 10 dpi), resulting in 12 treatment groups. Each treatment group was represented by 4 biological replicates, except for the Leghorns at 2 dpi, for which there were 3 nonchallenged and 5 challenged chickens included in the analysis. Equal numbers of males and females were used for each treatment group. Samples from birds in the 12 treatment groups were balanced across four lanes of the flow cell and randomly assigned an index. Data analyses. The Discovery Environment of iPlant Collaborative (54) was utilized for data processing. First, the FastQC program (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) was utilized for an initial quality check and assessment of all sequence data. The Illumina TruSeq adapter was recognized as an overrepresented sequence in some samples. For consistency, the adapter sequence and the individual multiplexing index were removed from all samples using the FASTX Clipper program. In addition, FASTX removed any sequence less than 30 bp in length and filtered each read such that 80% of all base pairs within a read had a Phred quality score of 30 or higher. The remaining high-quality reads were used as input for the TopHat2 aligner (55) for alignment to the Galgal4 reference genome (assembly GCA_000002315.2). The Galgal4 (assembly GCA_000002315.2) and GTF files were downloaded from the Ensembl genome browser. In TopHat2 (55), default settings were used, except the minimum isoform fraction was lowered to 0.10 (the default is 0.15) to identify more alternatively spliced transcripts. The HTSeq library (56) was used to count the reads aligned to each transcript (the intersection-nonempty mode was used). Statistical analysis of the count data was performed using the generalized linear model option in the edgeR package (57) . The main effects of line, treatment, and time were included in the model. The contrasts comparing the challenged and nonchallenged birds within each line at each time are referred to as the six major contrasts (Fayoumi, 2 dpi, challenged versus nonchallenged; Leghorn, 2 dpi, challenged versus nonchallenged; Fayoumi, 6 dpi, challenged versus nonchallenged; Leghorn, 6 dpi, challenged versus nonchallenged; Fayoumi, 10 dpi, challenged versus nonchallenged; Leghorn, 10 dpi, challenged versus nonchallenged). The differentially expressed genes (DEG; FDR Ͻ 0.05) identified in either chicken line when comparing challenged to nonchallenged included 1,688, 965, and 180 DEG at 2, 6, and 10 dpi, respectively (Fig.  3 ). For these genes, contrasts were written to determine the significance of the interaction between line and challenge at each time. The P values generated from the interaction contrast were subjected to a Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing correction (58) . NDV sequence discovery. The NDV La Sota sequence (GenBank accession number JF950510.1) was downloaded from NCBI and used to make a GFF file. Using the Burrows-Wheeler alignment (BWA) (59) under default settings, the unmapped reads were aligned to the NDV genome (GenBank accession number JF950510.1). The HTSeq library (56) was used to count the number of reads that aligned to each viral gene. The cpm was calculated by taking the number of reads that aligned to each viral gene, dividing by the total number of unmapped reads, and multiplying by 1 million. There was no statistically significant difference between the number of unmapped reads in the challenged Leghorns and Fayoumis at 2 dpi (P ϭ 0.4). The data were imported into JMP statistical software (JMP Group Inc., San Francisco, CA) and analyzed with a least-squares analysis and Student's t test to generate the connecting letters report. Gene expression analysis. The trachea is a heterogeneous tissue composed of multiple cell populations that likely change under different treatment conditions. To determine cell type enrichment, the transcript identifiers of the DEG (FDR Ͻ 0.05) for each of the six major contrasts were converted into their associated gene names using BioMart software (http://uswest.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/). The six gene lists were then input into the CTen database (http://www.influenza-x.org/~jshoemaker/cten/) (60) . The CTen database is based on human and mouse data and has previously been used for chickens (61) . For pathway analysis, Qiagen's Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Qiagen, Redwood City, CA) was used. The identifiers of the transcripts unrecognized by IPA were converted to a recognized identifier using BioMart software (http://uswest.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/) to ensure that the maximum number of transcripts was included for pathway analysis. The genes used for pathway analysis had an FDR of Ͻ0.05 and an absolute log 2 fold change (LFC) of Ͼ1, as estimated by the edgeR package. Fluidigm Biomark HD system. To validate the RNA-seq results, the Fluidigm Biomark HD system (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA) was used as a method of high-throughput qPCR. The input RNA (25 ng/l) came from the same isolate used for cDNA library construction. The 48 RNA samples were converted into cDNA, preamplified for 12 cycles with all 48 primer pairs (Table 3) , treated with exonuclease, diluted 10-fold, and analyzed on the 48.48 integrated fluidic circuit (IFC) for a total of 2,304 sample · gene tests. The genes were chosen to represent the range of log fold changes; not all genes were DE. Ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) were two housekeeping genes with a high raw cycle threshold (C T ) value correlation (r ϭ 0.9). Since its C T values were closer to the average C T values for all primers and samples, H6PD was used as the housekeeping gene for the analysis. Data were filtered by Fluidigm quality assessment and melting curve consistency. If, after these filtering steps, primer pairs did not have more than 28 samples remaining, all measurements for that gene were excluded. A total of 9.5% of the data, including those for four genes (MZB1, 5_8S_rRNA, UbI, and GAL2), were excluded from the analysis. Table 3 shows the genes and primers analyzed in this study. For all six major contrasts, the LFC in expression for each gene was calculated by the Ϫ2 ϪΔΔCT method. The correlation between the RNA-seq-generated LFC and the Fluidigm Biomark HD systemgenerated LFC was determined with a pairwise correlation across all genes and all six major contrasts for 258 pairwise comparisons in total. Accession number(s). Gene expression data were deposited in ArrayExpress, EMBL/EBI, under accession number E-MTAB-5431.
