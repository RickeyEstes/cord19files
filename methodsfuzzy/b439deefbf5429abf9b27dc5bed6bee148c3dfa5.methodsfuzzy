This descriptive study was developed in Vitória, Southeast Brazil, from a set of biological samples obtained over a two-year period (August 2007-August 2009) as a part of the Respiratory Virus Surveillance Program of the Ministry of Health, Brazil. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from patients of all ages who were attended at either emergency rooms or primary care units. The patients presented with fever (temperature equal to or greater than 38ºC) and runny nose, in addition to one or more of the following symptoms: cough, myalgia, nasal congestion, headache, sore throat and earache, within five days of the symptom onset. The nasopharyngeal aspiration procedure is a part of the routine of the Respiratory Virus Surveillance Program. All samples were tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF) and FTDRP 21 plus multiplex realtime RT-PCR assay. Seven respiratory viruses (RSV, PIV 1-3, Inf A, Inf B and HAdV) were screened in all specimens by IIF using the Respiratory Panel 1 Viral Screening & Identification Kit TM (Chemicon International, Millipore, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-three respiratory pathogens, including 18 human respiratory viruses and five bacterial species, were tested using the multiplex protocol. Total nucleic acid was extracted using the MagNA Pure LC automated extraction system (Roche, Switzerland). Nucleic acid was extracted from 200 µL of each NPA sample and was eluted to a final volume of 100 µL following the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation v.12.0 (Roche) protocol. An internal RNA virus control, Brome Mosaic Virus (Fast-track Diagnostics, Luxembourg), was introduced into the lysis buffer for each specimen to monitor the sample extraction and reverse transcription. Multiplex real-time RT-PCR was performed using the FTDRP 21 plus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Fast-track Diagnostics). The reaction volume for each test was 25 µL, made up of 10 µL of nucleic acid and 15 µL of buffer/enzyme mix from the AgPath-ID™ One- Step RT-PCR kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, USA). Amplification was performed in the ABI 7500 real-time PCR system thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, USA) and the following cycling conditions were used: 15 min at 50ºC, 10 min at 95ºC and 40 cycles of 8 s at 95ºC and 34 s at 60ºC. The fluorescence reading was taken in the 60ºC/34 s step in each cycle and the threshold cycle (C t ) values were determined by manual adjustment. Each sample was amplified in six parallel reactions, which contained primers and probes for four different targets, detecting viruses and pathogenic bacteria, in addition to the internal control of the reaction. The positive and negative virus plasmid controls provided in the kit were included in all runs to monitor the assay performance. Exploratory analysis of the data was performed using the SPSS software package v.17.01 (SPSS Inc, USA). Ethics -The Research Ethical Committee of the Centre for Health Sciences of Federal University of Espírito Santo approved this study, with the registration CEP-093/07.
