Animals. New Zealand rabbits and BALB/c mice were purchased from Shanghai Laboratory Animal center, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Animals were kept in conventional conditions and were handled in compliance of Chinese Academy of Sciences Guidelines for Animal Care and Use. Expression and purification of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein. The full length and different truncated fragments of SARS nucleocapsid (N) gene were inserted into vector pETs [7] . After transformation of Escherichia coli strain, BL21 (DE3), bacterial cells were induced by 10 mM IPTG at 22°C for 16 h in tryptone-phosphate medium. Proteins were extracted with buffer A containing 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM imidazole, and 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme. The high-speed supernatant of the extract from 1 liter of culture was loaded onto 8 ml Ni-NTA agarose column, followed by washing with 100 ml of 20 mM imidazole in buffer A. Proteins were then eluted with 50 mM imidazole in buffer A. Western blotting. Recombinant N proteins and inactivated cell lysates from SARS-CoV-infected Vero-E6 cells, HCoV-OC43-infected HRT18 cells, HCoV-229E-infected MRC5H cells, and CoV-NL63infected LLC-MK2 cells were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 10% polyacrylamide gels and were then transferred onto a membrane of polyvinylene difluoride (PVDF) as described previously [8] . After blocking with 3% BSA for 1 h, the membrane was incubated with anti-SARS N protein mAbs and stained with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) for 1 h. The blots were developed using ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunization and raising polyclonal antibodies. Rabbits were immunized subcutaneously at multiple sites on the back of rabbits with 1 mg of E. coli-expressed N protein in emulsion 1:1 v/v with complete FreundÕs adjuvant. The rabbits were boosted three times at 2-week interval with N protein in emulsion with incomplete FreundÕs adjuvant. The blood was collected after 1 week of last immunization. The titers of the antisera from rabbits were determined by ELISA. ELISA assay. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed as described previously [8] . In brief, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with the SARS N protein in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) (20 lg/ml, 50 ll/well) at 4°C overnight. After being blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% bovine serum and 0.1% Tween 20, the plates were incubated with diluted antisera at various concentrations at 37°C for 2 h. Bound antibodies were detected with HRP-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Bio-Rad). Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was used as the substrate (Sigma, USA), and the absorbance was measured by microplate autoreader (Thermo) at 450 nm. HRP enzyme labeling purified polyclonal antibody. Anti-SARS N protein antisera from rabbits (pAbs) were initially purified by 33% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation and then the purified antibodies were labeled with HRP by 1.25% glutaraldehyde (GA). The reactivity was stopped by 0.2 M lysine for 2 h. The enzyme labeled complex was dialyzed with PBS at 4°C overnight. At last, the HRPcoupled pAbs were precipitated by 33% saturated ammonium sulfate and then dialyzed. Preparation of monoclonal antibodies against SARS N protein. Female BALB/c mice were immunized with 100 lg E. coli-expressed N protein in emulsion 1:1 v/v with complete FreundÕs adjuvant and were boosted three times at 2-week interval in incomplete FreundÕs adjuvant. The mouse with the highest Ab titer tested by ELISA was boosted intraperitoneally with 100 lg of the N protein in 0.5 ml PBS. On the third day after boosting, the mouse was sacrificed and the spleen cells were harvested. The spleen cells were fused with murine myeloma cells, SP2/0, by 50% PEG and distributed in 96-well culture plates. The cultured supernatants from each well were screened by detecting their reactivity to recombinant N proteins by ELISA. The positive hybridoma clones were selected by limiting dilution method [9] . After three cycles of cloning, the stable hybridoma clones were obtained. The antibody isotypes were identified by mouse sub-isotype panel (Bio-Rad). In order to acquire abundant mAbs, the pristine-primed BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 · 10 6 hybridoma cells per mouse. The ascites were collected and mAbs were purified by protein G affinity column. Measurement of antibody affinity constant. The antibody affinity constant was determined by non-competitive ELISA as described previously [10] . The ELISA plates were coated with 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, or 5 lg/ml of recombinant SARS N protein, respectively. After saturation with 10% bovine serum in PBS, wells were incubated with different dilutions of mAb. The following steps were performed as mentioned above and the optical absorbance at 450 nm was measured. Sandwich ELISA for detection of N protein. The mAb S-39-2 was coated on microtiter plates at 4°C overnight. After saturation with 10% bovine serum in PBS, the wells were incubated with human sera or with E. coli-expressed N protein. Later on, the HRP-coupled rabbit pAbs were added to detect the bound N protein as described [8] . Indirect immunofluorescence assay for detecting cross-reactivity of mAbs and pAbs with different human coronaviruses. In order to assess whether the N protein-specific Abs of SARS-CoV have a cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses, three Abs (N protein-specific S-39-2 and N-17-13 mAbs and rabbit pAbs) were selected and their crossreactivities to N proteins of other three human coronaviruses were measured by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) as well as Western blot analysis. HCoV-OC43 (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA) was propagated on HRT18 cells, HCOV-229E (ATCC) on MRC5 cells, and HCoV-NL63 Amsterdam 1 strain (a gift from Dr. Lia van der Hoek, Amsterdam) on LLC-MK2 cells. HCoVs OC43, 229E, and NL63 coronaviruses were propagated on respective cell cultures from the frozen aliquot stock. After 2 days, before extensive cytopathic effect is observed, the cells were removed from the bottle and washed with PBS. The cells were resuspended in a small volume of PBS, deposited on fluoslides until dry, and fixed with acetone in À20°C for 10 min. During staining, 15 ll of first antibody with different dilutions (1/20 and 1/50) was added on the slides and then incubated at 37°C for 30 min. After washing with 10-fold diluted PBS for 5 min, the slides were treated with suitable diluted secondary antibody fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse or rabbit IgG conjugate (BD, Pharmingen) in 15 ll per spot. The slides were sealed with a cover reagent and observed under a fluorescent microscope. The positive or negative scores were evaluated by two persons.
