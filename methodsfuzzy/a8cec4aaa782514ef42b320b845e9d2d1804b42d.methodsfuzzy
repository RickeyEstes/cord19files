The severe sepsis study in Skaraborg Over nine months, from September 2011 until June 2012, we performed a prospective, consecutive, epidemiologic study to investigate the incidence of community onset severe sepsis and septic shock in adults in Skaraborg, a rural area in Sweden with a population of 256,000. A single public hospital, Skaraborg Hospital, serves this population. Study inclusion criteria were: residents of Skaraborg 18 years or older who were treated within 48 h of admission with intravenous antibiotics on clinical suspicion of sepsis. The study was a Breal life^study. No formal criteria for sepsis had to be fulfilled. Blood cultures were drawn from all patients before starting antibiotic treatment. Nasopharynx culture was performed on patients with a suspected focus in the respiratory tract or sepsis with unknown focus. Other cultures were done according to the clinical judgment of the treating physician. All patients were evaluated by protocol for the presence or development of severe sepsis or septic shock according to the Swedish definition and criteria [25] . The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee in Gothenburg (376-11). The present study was part of the epidemiological study of severe sepsis, and was carried out during Bthe flu season^in patients admitted to the hospital from January 19 to March 26. Review of the complete patient records for all patients was performed according to protocol by one infectious diseases specialist (LRL). Clinical relevance was estimated from clinical notes on sudden onset of respiratory symptoms, dry or productive cough, shortness of breath, congestion, fever, imaging showing new infiltrates and when the discharge diagnosis contained a respiratory infection.
