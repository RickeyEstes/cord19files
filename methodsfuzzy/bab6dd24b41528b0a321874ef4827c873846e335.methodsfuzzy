We collected data from the four geographic regions of Sierra Leone (Western Area, Northern province, Southern province and Eastern province). We then purposefully selected five districts to cover all four geographic regions of the country. Figure 1 shows the location of the five districts in Sierra Leone. The five districts include western area urban and western area rural districts (both in the Western area), Bo district (Southern province), Kenema district (Eastern province) and Bombali district (Northern province). We chose these five districts based on the epidemiological profile of the total confirmed Ebola cases and because they are host to the highest number of Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone. We then randomly selected Ebola survivors in each of the five districts based on proportional representation using the national list of registered Ebola survivors obtained from the Sierra Leone Association of Ebola survivors (SLAES). Survivors who were randomly selected were approached to participate in the study via telephone. The required sample of 351 Ebola survivors was determined using the formula for cross-sectional study (N = z 2 pq/d 2 ), with the perceived prevalence (p) assumed to be 50% since no previous research on T&CM use among Ebola survivors has been conducted so far. To increase the statistical power, we aimed to recruit 400 Ebola survivors.
