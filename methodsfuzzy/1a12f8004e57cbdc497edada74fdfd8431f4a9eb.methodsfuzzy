We applied the Fisher's summary-statistic method based on the previous application of Rhodes et al. [24] . Our implementation was derived from MADAM (Meta-Analysis Data Aggregation Methods), a toolbox for the R statistical language [25] . Statistical tests were performed on a per-gene basis for all arrays associated with a given biological condition. Specifically log-ratio measurements for each array were re-normalized by dividing by the standard deviation of the array, and one-sided t-tests were used to identify genes up-and down-regulated relative to mock infection, i.e., for the null hypotheses H 0 : log 2 (infected/mock) ≤ 0 and H 0 : log 2 (infected/ mock) ≥ 0, respectively. p-values for each directionality (up-or down-regulation) and pathogenicity (HPI or LPI) were combined according to Fisher's summary statistic S = -2 ∑ log p [26] . The significance of S was determined by a permutation test whereby p-values were shuffled 1000 times among biological conditions, S was re-derived each time, and the resulting S values constituted the null distribution. An FDR-corrected pvalue of 0.05 was used as a threshold for significance. Genes that were found to be both up-and down-regulated for a given pathogenicity (HPI or LPI) were excluded from further analysis. The signature comprised genes found to be oppositely regulated in HPI and LPI. The module-mapping method of Segal et al. identifies modules of co-expressed genes from microarray data based on co-expression within the compendium and comembership in previously annotated gene sets [27] . We used the module-map method as implemented in the software package Genomica (available at http://genomica.weizmann.ac.il) using the log-ratio compendium and default settings. Modules were tested for associations with HPI and LPI outcomes, and the signature comprised the largest module found to be oppositely regulated in HPI and LPI.
