Microbiology laboratories must implement rapid techniques, including immunoassay, microscopy and molecular testing [13] . New molecular methods have been developed during the last two decades and have recently been introduced in clinical laboratories as a consequence of automation and the development of techniques that are easier to perform. Clinical microbiologists should become familiar with molecular techniques and incorporate these in the normal microbiology routine. The introduction of rapid response in some laboratory areas has demonstrated clinical and economic benefits for healthcare systems, particularly in antimicrobial susceptibility testing and virology [18, 19] . Molecular techniques have had a direct impact on rapid response and infectious disease surveillance. They have been shown to be essential for the identification of emerging pathogens and for understanding their population structure. They are also useful for characterising virulence determinants and the genes participating in antimicrobial resistance. During outbreaks, they are essential tools for tracking the spread of microbial pathogens and for evaluation of intervention strategies [6, 20] . The results of a large number of researchers have shown the advantages of molecular techniques in infectious disease surveillance, including local studies and international networks, not only in the nosocomial setting but also in the community. Molecular techniques also have the advantage of being useful for researching genetic determinants without culturing organisms, thus allowing a more rapid laboratory response.
