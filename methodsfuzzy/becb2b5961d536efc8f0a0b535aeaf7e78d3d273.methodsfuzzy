Logistic regression was used for the development of the diagnostic algorithm. A detailed assessment of the model assumptions of linearity and additivity was performed (S1 Text). All pre-defined candidate predictors listed in S1 Table and significant interaction terms were included in the full model. The model was then simplified using step-wise backwards selection using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and stability selection [14] . Alternative statistical models such as classification and regression trees (CART) and random forests (RF) were also investigated in order to find an optimal diagnostic algorithm [15, 16] . The performance of the model was assessed with respect to discrimination (receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) and area under the ROC curve (AUC)), calibration (calibration plots and calibration intercepts and slopes), and standard accuracy criteria of binary diagnostic tests (sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values). We selected the cut-off point to classify a patient as dengue positive at a predicted risk of dengue of !33.3%, corresponding to assuming that the "cost" of missing a true dengue patient is twice as large as the cost of a false-positive [17] . To avoid over-optimistic estimates of model accuracy and performance due to model derivation and evaluation on the same dataset, all accuracy measures were corrected for optimism by validation. Validation was performed for the whole model development process including variable selection. Two validation schemes were employed to mimic external validation: a. "leave-one-site-out cross-validation", i.e. repeatedly developing the algorithm on all but one site and validation on the left-out site b. Temporal validation with patients recruited before 15 June 2012 as the training set and patients recruited thereafter as the evaluation set [18] . The final logistic model was also presented as a nomogram for direct clinical use. All statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software R v3.1.1 (R foundation for statistical computing, Vienna, Austria) and its companion packages c060 version 0.2-3 (for stability selection), randomForest version 4.6-7 (for random forest) and rpart version 4.1-8 (for CART).
