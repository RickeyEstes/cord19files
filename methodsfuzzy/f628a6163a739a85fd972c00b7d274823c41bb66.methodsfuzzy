We model viral spread using a renewal-equation framework [6] , which allows us to model the current incidence of infected individuals (i.e., the rate at which new infections occur in the population) as a function of previous incidence and how infectiousness of an infected individual varies over the course of their infection. We divide incidence i into two categories -i a and i s -corresponding to incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, respectively. Newly infected individuals that are either asymptomatically or symptomatically infected can transmit the disease to others, but they differ in their intrinsic reproduction numbers, R a and R s , respectively, as well as intrinsic generation-interval distributions [7] , g a (τ ) and g s (τ ). Generation intervals, which are defined as the time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person [8] , depend on the natural history of infection: individuals with subclinical infections may have fast clearance and short generation intervals, or slow viral reproduction and long generation intervals (cf. [9] ). The shape of the generation-interval distribution characterizes the relationship between the epidemic growth rate r and the reproduction number [10] . Neglecting births and loss of immunity on the time scale of the outbreak, the dynamics of susceptibles and incidence are: The basic reproduction number of this system is: where p is the proportion of incident cases that are asymptomatic: i a (t) = pi(t). The corresponding intrinsic generation-interval distribution of an average infected individual is given by: where we define the "intrinsic" proportion of asymptomatic transmission z as the relative contribution of asymptomatic cases to the basic reproduction number: Note that the intrinsic proportion of symptomatic transmission satisfies Yet, this information is not sufficient to disentangle the role of asymptomatic cases, i.e., what fraction of secondary cases can be ascribed to realized transmission from asymptomatic cases vs. symptomatic cases? The intrinsic proportion of asymptomatic transmission z is a useful benchmark, but does not necessarily reflect the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission, unless both .

The realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission, q at time t is given by: During the period of exponential growth, we assume S remains nearly constant, and i(t) is proportional to exp(rt), and simplify by recalling that i a (t) = pi(t), i s (t) = (1 − p)i(t) such that: Here, δ c for each of the two classes is the average "discount" of a new infection -the average relative contribution of a secondary infection to the epidemic, taking exponential growth into account: δ c < 1 and grows smaller as the generation interval grows longer. Thus, the realized proportion of asymptomatic infections will be increased (resp., decreased) if transmission is relatively faster (slower) along the asymptomatic route. The discount δ also depends on the relative variation in the generation-interval distribution, the "dispersion": more variation in generation intervals leads to more opportunities for fast spread and thus to higher values of δ (similar to shorter average generation intervals). To estimate the effects of assumptions about asymptomatic transmission on the importance of asymptomatic transmission and estimates of the basic reproduction number R 0 , we parameterize the generation interval distributions of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases based on their means,Ḡ a andḠ s , and dispersions, κ a and κ s . We assume that generation intervals are gamma distributed, and we set the dispersion to be equal to the squared coefficient of variation (the reciprocal of the gamma shape parameter, see Supplementary Materials). We assume that epidemic growth rate r and the generation-interval distribution of symptomatic case are known, using parameter values that are consistent with earlier COVID-19 models [11] : 1/r = 7 days,Ḡ s = 8 days, and κ s = 0.5. We infer values of q using Eq. (8) and R 0 using the Euler-Lotka equation [12] : In Supplementary Materials, we also use an ordinary differential equation model including .
