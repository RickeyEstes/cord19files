The collection method and device developed and experiential set up for collecting EBC are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 , respectively. As observed in Figure 1 , a simple EBC collection device was developed here. The EBC collection device is composed of four major parts as shown in Figure 1 : collection device cover, collection device base, a layer of ice, and a hydrophobic film (treated by ultralow temperature 270uC). The collection device cover and base were made of Teflon TM polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) material, and a parafilm (Parafilm Co. Menasha, WI) used as the hydrophobic surface. The dimensions of the collection device are measured as 80640640 (mm) (length6width6height). In the collection device cover, there is a hole with a diameter of 6 mm as the exhaled breath inlet. The thickness of the collection device cover and base was about 3 mm, and the whole collection device weighs around 105 g. The layer of ice is used to keep the treated hydrophobic film cool. For EBC collection, sterile water (DNA and RNA free) was first added into the collection base of the device up to a depth of 5 mm as observed in Figure 2 . And then, the device base together with the cover was placed in an ultralow temperature (270uC) refrigerator (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co. Marietta, OH) to form a layer of ice. Following this step, a sterile hydrophobic parafilm measured as 8064060.3 (mm)(length6width6thickness) was placed onto the surface of the ice suited in the collection base. To collect EBC samples, a disposable sterile straw with a diameter of 5 mm (16 cm long) is inserted through the exhaled breath inlet shown in Figure 2 , with its end 2 mm above the hydrophobic parafilm. The human subjects are then advised to mouth-breathe without wearing a nose clip through the exhaled breath inlet shown in Figure 2 toward the hydrophobic film for a selected time (1-4 min). Due to the low temperature and hydrophobic nature of the parafilm surface, exhaled breath quickly condenses into tiny liquid droplets on the hydrophobic surface. Assuming an average breathing rate of 12 L/min for an adult, the particle speed from the exhaled breath would be around 10 m/s given the size of the straw (5 mm in diameter). Therefore, during the exhaled breath collection, the bacteria or virus particles would impact onto the hydrophobic surface at a speed of 10 m/s. In addition to condensing used for other EBC collection procedures, the method developed here also rely on the impaction to collect the bacterial and viral particles. Given such a speed, there might be possible particle bounce problems, however the bacterial or viral particles in the exhaled breath usually come with water droplets, which thus minimizes the potential particle bounce problem. After the collection, about 10 ml of DNA and RNA free DI water was pipetted onto the hydrophobic film as observed in Figure 1 . To collect breath samples on the hydrophobic film, one only needs to use the pipette to touch the DI water droplet, and then drag the DI water droplet to scroll over the entire surface. The DI water droplet would move with the pipette without an extra step. The materials collected on the surface would be subsequently scavenged into the water droplet. After this operation, the collected EBC samples in the form of bigger liquid droplet as shown in Figure 1D were transferred to a sterile tube by a pipette for subsequent analysis. The samples collected without the exhaled breath from human subjects are used as the negative controls. The EBC collection efficiency and biological analysis of collected samples were performed as outlined in the experimental procedure shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).
