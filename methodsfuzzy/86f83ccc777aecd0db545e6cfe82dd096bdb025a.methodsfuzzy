The sample for this study comprised 120 Holstein-Friesian cows, aged 2 to 9 yr, kept at 4 different dairy farms in the Repubfic of Croatia. Average annual milk production on these farms was 6,000 L per cow. These farms were chosen over others because of frequent reproductive problems that had occured over the few last years. We have tested for one group of cows with reproductive disorders and a second group without reproductive disorders from each farm. These groups were made by cluster random sampling, and cows within groups were chosen by systematic random sampling. Blood samples were collected from all dairy cows by puncture of the jugular vein into tubes without an anticoagulant. All blood samples were centrifuged in the laboratory at 1,200 rpm for 10 min to remove the sera, which were then heat-inactivated at 56 Â°C for 30 min prior to testing. Sera were examined for IBR and BVD viruses by serum-neutralization test. Antibodies were determined by the micro-method, using Linbro IS-FB-96 plates. Four serial two-fold dilutions of each serum were incubated in 50-#L volumes with equal volumes of the viral suspension containing 100 TCIDso of cytopathic Iowa strain of IBR virus and cytopathic Oregon-C24V strain of BVD virus. After I h of incubation at 37 *C, a suspension of an embryonic bovine trachea (EBTr) cell strain in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM), with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), was added to make up a volume of 100 #L. Each test included a back titration of the vires, positive and negative serum control and cell culture control. The results were evaluated after 5 d of incubation at 37 *C in 5% CO2 in air. Virus neutralization antibody titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the 50% protection end point, calculated by the Spearman-Kgrber method. Sera with a titre -log10 SNT,o 0,9 or greater to IBR virus and -logto SNTso 1,0 or greater to BVD virus were considered positive. All the dairy cows in this study were examined vaginally and per rectum for reproductive disorders. Excluding clinical findings, data on abortions and fetal mortality were taken from reproductive ananmesis. Differences in antibody prevalence between groups with and without reproductive disorders for IBR and BVD viruses were tested by the Chi-square test.
