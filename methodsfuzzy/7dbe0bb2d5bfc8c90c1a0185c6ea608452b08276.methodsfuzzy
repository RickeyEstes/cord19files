An online questionnaire was distributed to Finnish laying hen farmers during winter 2017-2018. The questionnaire was advertised in the Finnish poultry journal before it was made available. The Finnish Poultry Association distributed the questionnaire via egg packaging centres and social media channels to Finnish egg producers. In Finland, there are 270 laying hen farms with â‰¥300 laying hens. The association estimated that the questionnaire reached about 90% of Finnish egg producers. It was open for a month. The study defined feather pecking as pecking that damaged feather cover, leading to broken feathers and feather loss (slight skin damage caused by feather plucking may occur). Cannibalism was defined as pecking that damaged skin and underlying tissues. The questionnaire comprised 43 questions, most of which were asked on a farm basis, but if the answer was expected to differ among flocks, the answers were collected on a flock basis (Table S1) . First, we gathered general information about the farms, the production system and the birds. The next topic included questions on farmer attitudes towards beak trimming, and farmers' estimation about the seriousness of existing pecking problems, as well as the effect of pecking-related problems on production performance. The seriousness of pecking-related problems was assessed on a scale from 1 (not serious) to 7 (extremely serious). The attitude towards beak trimming was assessed using a scale from 1 ([I would] most definitely not) to 7 ([I would] most probably) use beak-trimmed hens if beak trimming were legal. Many of the questions focused on the farmers' opinions of the importance of a range of risk factors. These were selected based on the literature and practical experience, as being known to influence pecking problems, and included breed, production system, the origin of the birds and rearing period, housing conditions and bird management, perches, nests, litter, feeding, unexpected problems, and health-related issues. In addition, we clarified opinions on optimal age of pullets for transportation, detailed information about suitable lamps and litter, problems with perches and nests, and preferable time spent on observing birds with open-answer questions. The last topic investigated the farmers' estimates, based on practical experience, of the most effective preventive measures (additional enrichment, such as straw bales, hanging objects and pecking stones) and means available to manage on-going pecking problems (i.e., intervention, such as removal of the pecker or victim from the flock). All the estimations used a scale from 1 (not important) to 7 (extremely important). Additionally, at the end of the questionnaire, the respondents were asked to, in their own words, and in order of importance, list the five most important measures, to prevent pecking problems and manage on-going problems (intervention measures). To rate all mentioned factors, the most important factor received five points, and the least important factor one point. For analyses, all points were summed to obtain total points given to each factor. Finally, the respondents were able to present free opinions concerning all topics.
