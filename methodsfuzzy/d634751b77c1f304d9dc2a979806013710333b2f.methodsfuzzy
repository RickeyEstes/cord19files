The synthesis of the ANB-based library or peptides was initiated by the deprotection of the amino groups of the resin with 20% piperidine in DMF and the coupling of 5-amino-2-nitrobenzoic acid using a mixture of N,N,N′ , N′ -tetramethyl-O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)uronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU)/4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). The resin was washed twice in N methylmorpholine. Next, 2 equiv. of ANB was dissolved in DMF and 2 equiv. of TBTU was added, followed by 1 equiv. of DMAP. The obtained solution was added to the resin, and after 30 s, 4 equiv. of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) was added. The whole mixture was stirred for 3 h. The solution was filtered off, and the resin was washed with DMF. The procedure was repeated three times. Next, the first amino acid residue was coupled with a method described in ref. 22 . A ninefold excess was applied to the active resin sites as follows: the amino acid was dissolved in pyridine (10 ml pyridine to 1 g peptidyl-resin). The whole solution was mixed until the temperature of − 15 °C was reached and then 9 equiv. of POCl 3 was added. The mixture was successively stirred for 20 min at − 15 °C, 20 min at room temperature, and 6 h in an oil bath. After deprotection with 20% piperidine in DMF, the peptide chain was elongated as follows: resin was divided into 18 equal parts, and in six positions, the amino acid derivatives such as Fmoc-Asp(tBu), Fmoc-Ser(OtBu), Fmoc-Ser(OMe), Fmoc-Dap(Cbz), Fmoc-Agp(Boc) 2 , Fmoc-Dap(Boc) were introduced-where Dap is (S) 2,3-diaminopropionic acid and Agp ((S)2-amino-3-guanidino-propionic acid)-using a standard Fmoc synthesis protocol. To each of remaining 12 portions, Fmoc-Dap(Mtt) was introduced and 4-methyltrityl (Mtt) was removed using procedure described in ref. 23 (2% TFA in DCM with addition of 1% triisopropylsilane). Such mixture was added to every 12 portions and stirred for 15 min. Completeness of Mtt removal was verified by adding pure TFA and yellow color development was monitored to indicate the presence of free Mtt groups. The whole procedure was repeated until no absorbency increase monitored at 410 nm was recorded. Next, DIPEA/DMF solution was added to each system for 15 min, resulting in 12 portions of Fmoc-Dap-Arg-ANB-polymer. To each of the above resin aliquots, the monoprotected heterobifunctional polyethylene glycol moieties (PEG) were coupled using equimolar amounts of PEG/DIPCI/HOBt in DMF/NMP (1:1, v/v) solution. The following protected PEG derivatives were used: 5-(t-butyloxycarbonyl-amino)-3-oxapentanoic acid (further abbreviated as O1), 8-(t-butyloxycarbonyl-amino)-3, 6-dioxaoctanoic acid (O2), 5-[N-t-butyloxycarbonyl-N′ -(2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydro benzofuran-5-sulfonyl)] amidino-3-oxapentanoic acid (GO1), 8-[N-t-butyloxycarbonyl-N′ -(2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzof uran-5-sulfonyl)]amidino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (GO2), 5-(benzyloxycarbonyl-amino)-3-oxa-pentanoic acid (O1(Cbz)), 8-(benzyloxycarbonyl-amino)-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid dicyclohexylamine (O2(Cbz)), 2-(2-tert-butoxyethoxy) acetic acid (HO1), 2-(2-(2-tert-butoxyethoxy)ethoxy) acetic acid (HO2), 3,6-dioxaoctanedioic acid 1-tert-butyl ester (C01), 3,6,9-Trioxaundecandioic acid 1-tert-butyl ester (CO2), 5-methoxy-3-oxapentanoic acid (MO1), 8-methoxy-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (MO2). Completeness of the coupling was monitored using a Kaiser test. Lack of free amino groups allowed us to move to the next step of library synthesis in which all resin portions were mixed and again divided into 18 parts. The whole procedure was repeated twice. Finally, the tert-butyloxycarbonyl derivative of 2-amino benzoic acid (Boc-ABZ-OH) was attached to the N-terminal amino group using the standard coupling method described above. After completing the synthesis, the sublibraries or individual peptidomimetics were cleaved from the resin, using a TFA/phenol/triisopropylsilane/H2O mixture (88:5:2:5, v/v) 24 . The purity of the synthesized compounds and the correctness of the synthesis were confirmed using an RP-HPLC ChromNAV (Jasco, Japan) equipped with a Kromasil 100 C8 column (Knauer, Germany) equipped with a UV-Vis detector and a fluorescence detector. A linear gradient from 10% to 90% B within 45 min was applied (A: 0.1% TFA; B: 80% acetonitrile in A). The peptides were monitored at 226 nm. The molecular weights of the synthesized peptides and peptide libraries were confirmed by analysis of the mass spectra which were recorded on a Biflex III MALDI TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) using α -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. NMR analysis. All NMR spectra were recorded in H 2 O/D 2 O (9:1 v:v) at 298 K using the Bruker AVANCE III 700 MHz (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The concentration of the sample was 2.12 × 10 −4 M (0.7 ml). For the studied compound, the following spectra were recorded: 1D proton spectrum and 2D TOCSY and ROESY at mixing times of 80 ms and 200 ms as well as 1 H-13 C HSQC. Preparation of the peptide libraries. The peptide libraries were synthesized using a portioning-mixing method. Initially, 17.7 g of the solid support (TentaGel S RAM) was used for the first library, i.e. ABZ-X4-X3-X2-X1-ANB-NH 2 . A twofold molar excess of amino acid or appropriate monoprotected PEG derivative was used for the coupling. The other synthetic methods used were as described above. Enzymatic studies. For the enzymatic studies, we used human NSP4 expressed in a Pichia pastoris expression system as described in ref. 15 . The NSP4 concentration used in the deconvolution of the library was 1.46 × 10 −9 M. The bovine β -trypsin (Sigma Chem. Co., USA) concentration was determined by spectrophotometric titration with 4-nitrophenyl-4′ -guanidinobenzoate (NPGB) at an enzyme concentration oscillating around 10 −6 M. Standardized trypsin solution was used to titrate BPTI (Sigma Chem. Co., USA) which in turn served to determine the solution concentrations of the produced NSP4. The substrate ABZ-Met-Phe-Pro-Arg-ANB-NH 2 recently developed in our lab was used. The deconvolution of peptide libraries was carried out by the iterative solution method 25 . The lyophilizates obtained for each sublibrary were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, and then diluted tenfold in an assay buffer. The fluorescence tests were performed using a FluoroStar OMEGA fluorescent microplate reader (BMG, Germany). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 320 nm and 410 nm for the ABZ/ANB. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the peptide was performed in 20 mM Tris-Cl buffer supplemented by 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.4) at 37 °C and continued over 30 min. All other enzymes (purchased from RD Systems, USA) were tested in concentration 2 × 10 −9 M in 20 mM Tris-Cl buffer supplemented by 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 30 min. Same conditions as above were applied to the assay. Determination of kinetic parameters. Assay conditions for the determination of the Michaelis constants (K M ) and catalytic constants (k cat ) were as noted above. The specificity constants (k cat /K M ) were calculated from k cat and K M values. Measurements were performed with an enzyme concentration of 1.46 × 10 −9 M. Three to five measurements were carried out for each compound (systematic error expressed as a standard deviation never exceeded 20%). The calculated initial hydrolysis rates were used as a measure of the substrate activity of the investigated peptides. All details of kinetic studies and the method of calculating kinetic parameters have been described elsewhere 26 . Determination of proteolytic cleavage patterns. For each sample of diluted substrate (concentrations 1.97 × 10 −6 M), the appropriate amount of enzyme (1.46 × 10 −8 M) was added, and the solution was incubated for 5, 30, and 60 min. The progress of the proteolytic reaction was monitored by RP-HPLC. The individual peaks resulting from the hydrolysis reaction were collected and identified using the mass spectra which were recorded on a Biflex III MALDI TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) using α -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. Molecular docking. The in silico study was performed using AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 molecular docking software 27 . For the optimization of compound 1 model geometry the MM2 force field was employed.
