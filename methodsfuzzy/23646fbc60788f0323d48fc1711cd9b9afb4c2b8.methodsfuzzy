KF27. The diagnostic method of choice for acute traveler's diarrhea is the conventional stool culture or cultures on selective media (depending on clinical suspicion) together with serial blood cultures if there is fever, although the diagnostic yield is low (A-III). KF28. For any traveler with fever and acute diarrhea arriving from an endemic area, malaria should be ruled out with the appropriate methods (B-III). KF29. Before traveling, the patient should be given information about the main self-treatment measures to be taken in case of diarrhea, and told to seek medical care in the presence of high fever, severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, uncontrolled vomiting, or if self-treatment is ineffective (A-III). KF30. For previously healthy adults, rehydration with conventional liquids, especially associated with loperamide, should be enough in cases of mild diarrhea (A-I). KF31. Rehydration and restoration of electrolyte balance with antidiarrheal drugs and non-absorbable antibiotics (rifaximin) is indicated for moderate diarrhea, and for the old or immunocompromised with no previous history of invasive disease (A-III). KF43. Travelers who present with fever of unknown origin after visiting a tropical or sub-tropical area should seek immediate medical attention (A-II). KF44. If there is any possibility of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), this should be investigated using appropriate biosafety measures and techniques that require the least handling possible (rapid tests or PCR) (A-II). KF56. The primary morphology of the lesion (e.g. papules, pustules, nodules, ulcers, blisters), configuration (e.g. linear) and distribution (exposed versus covered areas, specific parts of the body) are helpful for diagnosis (A-II). KF57. In most cases, diagnosis is clinical, and dermoscopy is useful for some entities (scabies, cutaneous larvae migrans, furuncular myiasis and tungiasis) (B-III). KF70. Most respiratory infections during and after travel do not require diagnostic confirmation because they are mild, self-limited upper respiratory tract infections (A-II). KF71. The diagnostic methods for pneumonia are no different from those used on autochthonous patients (B-II). KD83. All returning travelers with eosinophilia should request a stool examination to search for parasites using a concentration method and Strongyloides stercoralis serology (B-II). KD84. Travelers returning from Africa should request tests for diagnosing schistosomiasis (examination of the urine sediment and feces), and Schistosoma spp. serology (B-II). KD85. In cases where a diagnosis cannot be made with direct techniques, serological methods are a useful diagnostic tool, although their possible drawbacks should not be forgotten (B-III). KF92. Any international traveler who returns with fever, severe headaches, sensitivity to light and/or a stiff neck should be evaluated urgently to rule out the presence of meningitis or encephalitis (A-III). KF93. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis can adopt four different patterns: normal, raised neutrophils, raised lymphocytes, raised eosinophils, which is useful for differential diagnosis (A-II). KF94. Direct ophthalmoscopy is recommended for all patients with a diagnosis or suspicion of cerebral malaria, given its high prognostic and diagnostic value for malarial retinopathy (A-II).
