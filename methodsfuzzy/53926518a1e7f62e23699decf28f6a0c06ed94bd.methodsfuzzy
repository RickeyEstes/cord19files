The other option to enrich phosphopeptides is to exploit their hydrophilic and ionic nature and separate them from non-modified peptides with liquid chromatography-based methods. Ion exchange materials such as strong anion exchange (SAX) and strong cation exchange (SCX) interact with ionic molecules where they can be eluted by modifying the salt content and/or pH of the mobile phase. The anionic nature of phosphate allows the use of SAX to separate phosphopeptides from non-modified peptides. Han et al. compared the efficiency of Fe3Ã¾-IMAC to SAX chromatography to identify phosphorylation sites in human liver tissue [63] . A direct comparison of the two methods resulted in 47 phosphopeptides identified by SAX and 24 identified by IMAC at 0.96% FDR. Twelve of the phosphopeptides were identified by both methods, again showing how using multiple methods can increase the number of phosphopeptide identifications. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) uses hydrophilic column material coupled with hydrophobic mobile phases to separate hydrophilic from hydrophobic compounds. Phosphopeptides are typically more hydrophilic than non-phosphorylated peptides, making them an ideal candidate for separation by HILIC. McNulty and Annan used HILIC with a combination of IMAC enrichment to analyze the phosphoproteome of HeLa cell digests [64] . The phosphopeptides from HeLa cell digests were first enriched by HILIC chromatography followed by enrichment by Fe-IMAC. After each fraction was enriched by IMAC they were able to increase the efficiency of phosphopeptide detection to 96%. From 300 mg of HeLa cell protein they were able to identify 1000 unique phosphorylation sites, including 700 novel sites not previously discovered. The disadvantages to using these chromatographybased methods is the extra de-salting and or purification steps after fraction collection and decreased throughput from having to analyze multiple fractions from a single replicate.
