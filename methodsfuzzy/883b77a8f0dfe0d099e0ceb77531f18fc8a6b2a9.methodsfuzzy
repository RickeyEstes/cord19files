All 88 samples were genotyped for MHC I and II-DRB loci. Sixty-two individuals were already included in a previous study [24] . Total genomic DNA was isolated from blood buffy coat using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. We focused our analyses on the second exons of MHC I and II because this region is highly polymorphic and includes functionally important antigen-binding sites (ABS), i.e. amino acid positions postulated to interact directly with foreign antigens [27, 28] . The second exon (229 bp) of MHC I alleles was amplified using the primer Acju_Ex2MhcI_cF (59-GCTCCCACTCCCTGAGGTAT-39; [23] ) and the newly designed primer Acju_Ex2MhcI_kR (59-GGAKTCGCTCTGGTTGTAGT-39) designed from MHC I transcript sequences available from felid species in GenBank, following PCR conditions as described in Castro-Prieto et al. (2011). The second exon (246 bp) of MHC II-DRB alleles was amplified using primers and PCR conditions as described in Castro-Prieto et al. (2011) . Genotyping of MHC I and II-DRB was conducted through single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis followed by sequence analysis of the distinctive single-strand bands as previously described [24] . To ensure that the sequences represented true alleles, the PCR-SSCP analysis was conducted twice per individual sample.
