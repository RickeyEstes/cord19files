The steps required to undergo sequence analysis necessary for microbiome research include sampling, nucleic acid extraction, amplification (for marker gene studies), as well as sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. In order to effectively address a research question pertaining to the BE microbiome, careful considerations in each of these steps are crucial. As described previously 4 and summarized below, variations in any of the steps will result in differences in the observed microbiome data. Currently, there is little standardization in the methods adopted by different BE microbiome studies, making inter-study comparison and metaanalyses difficult. As in any scientific work, when one begins to design a microbiome research experiment, it is important to thoroughly consider the possible methodological options, and select one that is the most appropriate for addressing the intended research question. The best practices for the different steps associated with conducting microbiome research works have also been reviewed recently. 5
