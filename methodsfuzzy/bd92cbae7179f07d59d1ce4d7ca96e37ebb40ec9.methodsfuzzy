Protein cloning, expression, and purification. The preparation of SARS-CoV M pro for structural analysis has been described previously [38] . The method of preparation of SARS-CoV M pro for activity assay is almost identical except that the coding sequence was inserted into BamHI and XhoI sites of the expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia, New York, United States). The cDNA encoding IBV M pro (M41 strain) was a gift from Professor Ming Liao (South China Agricultural University, China); the cDNA encoding M pro of MHV (A59 strain) was a gift from Professor Guangxia Gao (Institute of Biophysics Chinese Academy of Sciences, China); the cDNA encoding M pro of HCoV-HKU1 was kindly provided by Professor Kwok-yung Yuen (University of Hong Kong, China); coding sequences of TGEV, IBV, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 M pro s were inserted into BamHI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid, and the subsequent methods for expression and purification were carried out as for SARS-CoV M pro . After change of a BamHI cleavage site at 429-434 in the sequence coding MHV M pro to GGCTCC, this coding sequence was inserted into BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1 plasmid for expression. FIPV M pro (15 mg/ml) and HCoV-229E M pro (15 mg/ml; two amino acids deleted at C-terminal) were expressed and purified as described previously [39, 47] . Crystallization and data collection. SARS-CoV M pro was crystallized as previously reported [38] . The SARS-CoV M pro inhibitor complexes were prepared as follows. First, the inhibitors were dissolved in 7.5% PEG 6000, 6% DMSO, and 0.1 M Mes (pH 6.0) with a concentration of 10 mM (supersaturation). Then, a 3-ll aliquot of such solution was added to the drop, and the crystals were soaked for approximately 2-6 days. A single crystal was prepared for low-temperature data collection by transfer to a cryoprotectant solution containing 30% PEG 400 and 0.1 M Mes (pH 6.0) and then flash frozen in a stream of N 2 gas at 100 K. The set of SARS-CoV M pro -I2 complex data was collected to 2.7 Å resolution using a Mar345 image plate (Marresearch, Norderstedt, Germany) mounted on a Rigaku RU2000 X-ray generator (Sevenoaks, United Kingdom) operated at 48 kV and 98 mA (k ¼ 1.5418 Å ). Data for SARS-CoV M pro individually complexed with N1 and N3 were collected at 100 K in-house on a Rigaku CuK a rotating-anode X-ray generator (MM007) at 40 kV and 20 mA (k ¼ 1.5418 Å ) with a Rigaku image-plate detector. Data for SARS-CoV M pro -N9 complex were collected at 100 K in-house on a Rigaku CuK a rotating-anode X-ray generator (FR-E) at 45 kV and 45 mA (k ¼ 1.5418 Å ) with a Rigaku image-plate detector. In respect to TGEV M pro co-crystal preparation, TGEV M pro was incubated with a 3-fold molar excess of N1 for 24 h at 4 8C. Crystallization trials were performed by the method published previously [37] . Briefly, the condition for crystal growth is 0.1 M HEPES (pH 8.5), 1.8 M (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 6% MPD, 5 mM DTT, and 5% dioxane. The set of TGEV M pro -N1 complex data was collected according to the method for SARS-CoV M pro -N9 complex All intensity data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with the HKL2000 programs DENZO and SCALEPACK [48] . Data collection statistics are summarized in Table S1 . Since the refinement of the IBV M pro structure is ongoing, the methods of crystallization and structure determination will be published elsewhere. Structure elucidation, model building, and refinement. The methods for structure determination, model building, and refinement were published previously [38] . Briefly, the SARS-CoV M pro -I2 complex structure was determined by molecular replacement from our native structure of SARS-CoV M pro (pH 7.6) (PDB ID: 1UK3). The structures of SARS-CoV M pro in complex with N1, N3, or N9 were determined from the isomorphous SARS-CoV M pro -I2 complex structure. The TGEV M pro -N1 structure was determined by molecular replacement using a single monomer of the native TGEV M pro structure (PDB ID: 1P9U). All cross-rotation and translation searches for molecular replacement were performed with CNS [49] . Adjustments to the models were made in O [50] . Positional refinement, individual B-factor refinement, and water picking were performed with CNS [49] . Validation of the final models was performed with PROCHECK [51] . Detailed refinement statistics are summarized in Table S1 . Enzyme activity assay. The activity of M pro s was measured by continuous kinetic assays, using an identical fluorogenic substrate MCA-AVLQSGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2 (over 95% purity, GL Biochem Shanghai Ltd, Shanghai, China). The fluorescence intensity was monitored with a Fluoroskan Ascent instrument (ThermoLabsystems, Helsinki, Finland) using wavelengths of 320 and 405 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. The experiments were performed with a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 1 mM EDTA, with or without DTT. Kinetic parameters, K m and k cat , were determined by initial rate measurements at 30 8C. M pro inhibition assays. As compounds with potent inhibition identified in preliminary inhibition assay, the strict kinetic parameters were determined. Time-dependent inhibitor progress curves were fit to a first-order exponential (equation 2) [43, 52] to yield an observed first-order inhibition rate constant (k obs ). P is the product fluorescence; v 0 is the initial velocity; t is time; D is a displacement term to account for the fact that the emission is nonzero at the start of data collection. The values of K i and k 3 were calculated from plots of 1/k obs obtained from equation 2 versus 1/[I] according to equation 3. [I] is inhibitor concentration; [S] is substrate concentration; K m is the Michaelis-Menten constant for the substrate; k 3 is the rate constant of inactivation, and K i is the equilibrium constant. In the experiment, the K i and k 3 values for the irreversible inhibitors were obtained from reactions initiated by addition of individual M pro , the concentration of which was similar as that for the enzymatic activity assay, containing 10 or 20 lM substrate, which depends on the enzymatic activity. The inhibitors vary from 5-8 different concentrations (10-fold molar excess of the enzyme in most cases). Data from the continuous assays were analyzed with the nonlinear regression analysis program Origin. When fast inactivation occurs, the measurement of K i and k 3 proved difficult. In this case, k obs /[I] was used as an approximation of the pseudo second-order rate constant to evaluate the inhibitors and was measured at approximately 2-4 different inhibitor concentrations. The error associated with this determination (k obs /[I]) is less than 20% of a given value. MHV-A59 plaque-reduction assay. Murine DBT cells (generously provided by Dr. Lishan Su of University of North Carolina) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics at 37 8C in 5% CO 2 . DBT cells were suspended in growth medium in triplicate wells in 6-well plates and preincubated with appropriate concentrations of the inhibitor. The next day, the medium was aspirated, and MHV-A59 was added to each well at a titer of 100 PFU/well. After incubation for 1 h, the virus inoculum was aspirated, and 2 ml of a media-agar overlay with appropriate concentrations of inhibitor was added to each well. The plates were further incubated for 24 h and stained with neutral red to visualize plaques. Cytotoxicity assay. DBT cells were suspended in growth medium in 96-well plates. The next day, appropriate concentrations of the inhibitor were added to the medium. Two days later, the relative numbers of surviving cells were measured by MTT (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States) assay in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. HCoV-229E, FIPV, and MHV-A59 infection assays. Human embryonic lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5; ATCC [Manassas, Virginia, United States]: CCL 171), Felis catus whole fetus (macrophage) cells (FCWF, ATCC: CRL 2787), and DBT cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, Glutamax I, nonessential amino acids, 10% FBS, and antibiotics at 37 8C in 5% CO 2 . Nearly confluent monolayers of MRC-5 (incubated at 33 8C following infection), FCWF, and DBT cells, which were grown in 6-well plates, were infected with HCoV-229E, FIPV (strain 79-1146), and MHV-A59, respectively, at a multiplicity of infection of 3 TCID 50 per cell. After 60 min of virus adsorption, the virus inoculum was replaced with cell culture medium containing varying concentrations of N3 or in the absence of inhibitor. At 14 h postinfection, the virus titers in the cell culture supernatants were determined using standard procedures. All experiments were performed in triplicate and mean values were determined. M pro individually complexed with I2, N1,  N3 , and, N9, and TEGV M pro in complex with N1 are 1WNQ, 1WOF, 2AMQ, 2AMD, and 2AMP, respectively. The GenBank (http://www. ncbi.nih.gov/Genbank/) accession number for IBV M pro is DQ157446.
