The sample size was estimated on the assumption that after endoscopic sphincterotomy, cholecystectomy would reduce recurrent biliary complications from 20% to 5%. To detect such a difference (␣ ϭ .05; ␤ ϭ .2) by using a 2-sided log-rank test, 89 patients would be required in each group, assuming a 10% loss during follow-up. Analysis was by intention to treat. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine the times to events and death. The log-rank test was performed to compare the recurrent biliary events and deaths between the 2 groups. A Cox regression model was used to adjust for bile duct size between groups. 15 Adverse events and outcomes after cholecystectomy in either treatment group were compared by using the Fisher exact test or Mann-Whitney U test when appropriate. Analysis based on the treatment actually received was also performed as a sensitivity analysis.
