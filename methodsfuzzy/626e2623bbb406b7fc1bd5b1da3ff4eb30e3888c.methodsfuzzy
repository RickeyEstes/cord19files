In vitro frameshifting assay. The in vitro frameshifting efficiency values were taken from a previous study 19 that made use of a commercially available in vitro translation system (rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega)) and wherein the in vitro translated protein products were resolved and quantified by SDS-PAGE. Thermal denaturation experiments. The HPLC-purified RNA oligonucleotides for UV-absorbance-detected thermal denaturation experiments were purchased from Sigma. The ensemble thermal denaturation experiments for the pseudoknots and a control hairpin were conducted using a Shimadzu 2550 spectrometer. The control hairpin (residues 1 to 19) is a truncated form of the pseudoknot SF206 (residues 1 to 34) (see Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The RNA oligonucleotide sample concentrations were 3 μ M. All pseudoknots and the control hairpin were heated at 85 °C then slowly cooled to 15 °C in more than 2 hours before the thermal melting experiments. The temperature ramping rate was 0.5 °C/min. Absorption values at 260 nm were recorded. The buffers contained 20 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.3 with varying NaCl concentrations (0 mM, 200 mM or 1 M NaCl). The measurement for each sample at each buffer condition was repeated three times. The melting temperatures were obtained from dA/dT versus temperature curves and presented as mean ± standard deviation. Native PAGE. RNA oligonucleotides (with residues 1-34 for the pseudoknots or residues 1-19 for the control hairpin, see Fig. 1a ) for native PAGE were annealed in the buffer with 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.3. The pseudoknot solutions were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, then slowly cooled to room temperature for 3 h and equilibrated at 4 °C overnight. The control hairpin solution was heated at 95 °C for 5 min, then snap-cooled on ice and equilibrated at 4 °C overnight. Each sample was mixed with 6× loading dye (QIAGEN) and diluted with buffer to have a final 1× loading dye and a final RNA concentration of 1 μ M. Then 20 μ L of each sample was loaded onto a 15% native polyacrylamide gel with 1× TBE (89 mM Tris/Borate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.3) running buffer. The gel was run at 250 V for 10 h at 4 °C, and was post-stained with ethidium bromide.
