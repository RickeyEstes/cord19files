The final ELISA method used to test experimental samples was as follows. Ascites 1Dl diluted to 10 p,gml-' Ig in 0.05M carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) was added to Immulon II microtiter plates (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) and incubated at 4°C overnight. Plates were washed with 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and blocked for 1 h with PBST plus 0.5% gelatin. Serum samples were diluted in PBST (l/100, l/200, and l/400) and incubated in the plate for 2 h at 37°C. After washing, biotinylated 1 D 1 IgG (0.5 pg ml-* > was added to the plates for 90 min at 37°C. Detection of bound antibody was accomplished by addition of a 1 / 1000 dilution of strepavidin-horseradish peroxidase complex (Amersham Canada Ltd., Oakville, Ont.) for 1 h at 37"C, followed by washing and the addition of the color Alternatively, a strepavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Gibco/BRL) was added at a l/2000 dilution, followed by addition of the substrate p-nitrophenylphosphate di(TRIS) salt (Sigma) in 0.5mM MgCl, (pH 9.8) with 1% diethanolamine. Both color reactions were measured on a Bio-Rad 3550 microplate reader at a wavelength of 405 nm (reference wavelength 490nm). The concentration of haptoglobin in serum samples was determined by comparison of absorbances with a standard curve generated from dilutions of antibody affinity-purified haptoglobin.
