2.1. Determination of protein and cDNA sequences and construction of the recombinant protein 2.1.1. Sequence determination and primer design The design of primers specific for the amplification of the cDNA coding for the putative antiviral protein was based on the protein and cDNA sequences. For identification of the protein sequence, L. obliqua hemolymph was purified and the fraction containing the antiviral property was analyzed by SDS-PAGE; the N-terminal sequence of the antiviral protein was determined by Maldi-Q-Tof mass spectrometry (Wattenberg et al., 2002) . In order to identify the cDNA coding for the protein of interest, the N-terminal sequence was analyzed against cDNA libraries of L. obliqua tegument and spicules (Veiga et al., 2005) , using all possible translation frames of each cDNA. The sequence of the respective cDNA was used for primer design and further cDNA amplification by PCR. Restriction sites were also included in the primer sequence for further ligation in the plasmid pFastBac1â„¢ (Invitrogen), as well as a His-tag sequence. Antiviral response of the baculovirus has been reported in the literature (Gronowski et al., 1999) and the histidine tag can stimulate the immune system response (Masek et al., 2011) . Therefore, we also amplified and cloned sequences of two other proteins (LOH-19-AY829833 and 8-LOH) that have molecular weights similar to the protein with the histidine sequence, to confirm that the protective effects observed in the results would be due to the action of the antiviral protein from L. obliqua (20-LOH-JN807330) and not a response of the immune system to the His-tag sequence (Masek et al., 2011; Veiga et al., 2005) .
