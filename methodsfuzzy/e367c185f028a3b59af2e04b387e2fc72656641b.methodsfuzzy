The research design uses the two case studies of TB vaccine innovators as exemplars. Our purpose is not to test existing theory but to extend ecosystem theory together with a business model approach to strategy in order to address under-studied issues in technology policy and public health. The cases may elucidate translational processes from medical research into healthcare practice. Case study designs have been used effectively for exploratory analysis and analytical generalization (Penrose, 1960; Weick, 1995) . Initially, "it is often desirable to choose a particular organization precisely because it is very special in the sense of allowing one to gain certain insights that other organizations would not be able to provide" (Siggelkow, 2007, p. 20) . The aim is not to provide statistically representative evidence but to offer insight into a little understood phenomenon (Yin, 2003) . Conceptual constructs and generealizations obtained from such cases can subsequently be explored through multiple case studies and larger-scale quantitative analysis (Eisenhardt, 1989; Poole and Van de Ven, 1989 ). The two case study firms were selected from the data set presented in Table 1 which summarizes private sector efforts to develop improved tuberculosis vaccines. Table 1 is derived from the Stop TB partnership database of innovator efforts to develop TB vaccines. To triangulate this data set we consulted industry directories including advocacy reports such as Treatment Action Group together with reports on improving health from developing countries. The search process yielded a dataset of 12 private sector firms, 1 joint venture firm, 1 public enterprise and 1 not-for-profit biotech enterprise. Oxford Emergent Tuberculosis Consortium (OETC) and Hai-Gui (H&G) Biotechnology were selected as exemplars for several reasons. They provide examples of innovator firms from a high-income country UK, and a developing country, China, respectively. H&G Biotech was the only private sector innovator from a developing country in the database and OETC was the only joint-venture example. The companies are approximately the same size with two full-time equivalent staff coordinating a network of collaborators and partners in R&D. The Oxford-Emergent Tuberculosis Consortium Ltd ("OETC") had been developing the world's most clinically advanced new TB vaccine candidate MVA85A/AERAS-485 ("MVA85A"). The unusual business model was of interest as a joint-venture structure set up by a publicly funded University and a biopharmaceutical firm listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The second case study, Shanghai H&G Biotechnology ("H&G") is headquartered in a science and technology park in Wuxi, China. It is seeking to advance one of the newest TB vaccines in development (Ag85A/ Ag85B) to enter into Phase I clinical development based on a novel scientific discovery of DNA vaccination. We used both primary and secondary data sources for this study. Primary sources included interviews, surveys, and a focus group of experts (a Delphi method). A semi-structured interview schedule was devised to understand how the firm's business models operationalize their strategies and how they created relationships with other private and public sector organizations. All interviews and data gathering took place between October 2009 and April 2012. Interviews varied from thirty minutes to two hours. Interviews were conducted with the respective company founders, general management team of OETC and R&D staff of H&G. Archival sources, company reports, review materials from external funders and government policy white papers were analyzed to complement and check personal and telephone interviews. An international meeting was organized to bring together and facilitate networking between the subjects of the wider research program of which this formed part (Li et al., 2012) . Participants included innovator firms and other global health ecosystem participants-funders involved in public and private partnerships, technical experts from the World Health Organization and member state/government representatives. These participants provided further evidence, making possible Delphi-style research that drew on global expertise in the field of TB vaccines (Bryman, 2008) . Key executives from both OETC and H&G made detailed presentations at the conference. Partners were present and able to assess the presentations of the case study principals. This provided a further check on retrospective bias and facilitated triangulation.
