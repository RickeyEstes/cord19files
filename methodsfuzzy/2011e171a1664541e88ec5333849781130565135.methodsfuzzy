This study was performed at Severance Children's Hospital in Seoul, Korea. Outpatient clinic, emergency room, and inpatient ward data were collected. From October 1 to December 31 in 2014, 504 patients under the age of 18 years with episodes of respiratory infection received nasopharyngeal swabs. All clinical data were collected by retrospective review of an electric medical record system. We defined LRTIs as pneumonia or bronchiolitis. When a patient had abnormal lung sounds, such as rales or crackles, with local infiltration or consolidation on chest X-ray, we diagnosed the patient with pneumonia. When lower airway obstruction signs, such as wheezing, decreased lung sounds, or chest retractions, with either a normal or hyperinflation chest X-ray were present, we diagnosed the patient with bronchiolitis. The swab specimens were sent to a virology laboratory in the Department of Laboratory Medicine at Yonsei University Medical Center for respiratory virus detection. DNA or RNA of respiratory viruses was extracted by TANBead Smart LabAssist-32 (BioKett, Taipei, Taiwan). Then the AdvanSure TM Respiratory Virus real-time RT-PCR Kit (LG Life Science, Seoul, Korea) was used to analyze all 504 samples. Using this kit, we were able to detect 14 types of viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) types A and B, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3, rhinovirus A, metapneumovirus, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and bocavirus.
