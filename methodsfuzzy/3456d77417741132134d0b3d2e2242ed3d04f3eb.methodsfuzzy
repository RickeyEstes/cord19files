Commercially reagents were used as received without additional purification. Melting points were determined with an SM-LUX-POL Leitz hot-stage microscope and are uncorrected. IR spectra were recorded on a BRUKER IFS-25 spectrophotometer. NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance 300 spectrometer (300 MHz for 1 H and 75 MHz for 13 C). Deuterated dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO-d 6 ) or chloroform (CDCl 3 ) were used as solvents, with DMSO (d H 2.5) or DMSO-d 6 (d C 39.5), CHCl 3 (d H 7.27) or CDCl 3 (d C 77.0) respectively, being employed as internal standards. Silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh) was used for column chromatography. The homogeneity of all the newly synthesized compounds was routinely checked by TLC on silica gel plates (Polygram Sil G/UV 254 ) and visualized by irradiation with a UV lamp. Elemental analyses were conducted by CNRS, Vernaison, France.
