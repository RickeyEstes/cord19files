The established model (Eq. (22)) can quickly predict the distribution of contaminant over a long period of time if the key indices of the RCs are obtained in advance. That is, the actual time cost depends on the RC calculation process. If a long-term prediction, such as a one-year or several-year prediction, is needed, the time cost for one RC calculation is still higher because of numerous time steps of simulation, especially when the building ventilation system is complex and the total grid number is large. Considering that the RC value for a "pulse" contaminant source is notable at the preliminary stage before decreasing sharply with time, as shown in Fig. 11 , a simplified method for RC calculation and the proposed model was proposed as follows: For each RC simulation for a specific boundary condition, only limited hours (e.g., 1 h, 2 h or 3 h) of contaminant variation and corresponding RC values at the preliminary stage are simulated. RC values close to 0 in the following hours are not simulated. As a limited number of simulations are needed for RC calculation, the total time cost for a long-time period prediction is significantly  lower with respect to a traditional CFD simulation, even if only one case prediction is conducted. The reliability of the simplified method is analyzed in Section 4. The accuracy of the proposed method, i.e., Eqs. (18) and (22), depends on the accuracy of the expression for the transient concentration of contaminant (Eq. (9)) and the mathematical descriptions of contaminant transport in the air ducts and the GAHUs. In Section 3, the experimental validation of the expression for transient concentration is described first; then, a description of the numerical verification of a general recirculating ventilation system follows. The time step adopted in each process was 1 s. Further exploration of the reliability of the proposed method for a longer time step (minutes or hours) is discussed in Section 4. The accuracy of the proposed model for a general recirculating ventilation system (Eq. (18)) was further verified by comparing the simulated results obtained by CFD and the proposed model based on a numerical case. The geometry model of the ventilation system for CFD simulation is illustrated in Fig. 6 Direct CFD simulation of the transient concentration of contaminant was conducted based on the geometrical model in Fig. 6 . The CFD modeling approach was the same as that described in Section 3.1. The room model was built separately, and the RCSA and RCCS indices were simulated and calculated. The transient concentration of contaminant was predicted subsequently by using the proposed model (Eq. (18)). The predicted concentrations at different positions (Fig. 4) are shown in Fig. 7 . The concentration variations at all of the positions for the proposed model agreed well with those for the CFD simulation. Therefore, it is plausible that the proposed model had essentially the same accuracy as the CFD simulation, indicating an acceptable reliability of prediction. The accuracy of the proposed method with a time step of 1 s was verified in Section 3. However, the reliability of the model needs to be determined for larger time steps that are adopted for the prediction of contaminant distribution over a long period of time. We considered a year-round prediction and analyzed the reliability of the prediction based on the time step of 1 h. Generally, the reliability of the prediction depends on three aspects: the simulation accuracy with the adopted time step, whether the influence of contaminant in return air on contaminant in supply air is considered, and whether the time delay of contaminant transport is considered. In this section, the accuracy with different time steps is first analyzed, and the influences of return air concentration and time delay are then investigated. In Section 4.3e4.5, the proposed model exhibited an acceptable reliability (with the time step 1 h) based on numerical cases of both fresh air ventilation systems and recirculating ventilation systems. In Section 4.6, the adaptability of the proposed simplified method was analyzed based on the case in Table 2 , Section 4.4 (time step of 1 h). The predicted results by the simplified method (i.e., 1 h RCsimplified) and the original proposed method (i.e., 1 h RCoriginal) are illustrated and compared in Fig. 15 . For the prediction by the simplified method, only the RC value in the first hour was calculated. All of the predicted concentrations over time were kept consistent between the original method and the simplified method. The simplified method, in which 1 h of RC was simulated, could achieve a result that was approximately equal to that achieved by the original method. Therefore, the simplified method was reliable in predicting the distribution of contaminant in a recirculating ventilation system over a long period of time. In this section, the 1 h RC simulation suitably predicted the distribution of contaminant when the simplified method was used under the given building ventilation situation. For other practical building ventilation systems, the required time steps of RC calculation for the simplified method should be determined individually according to different ventilation and air exchange conditions.
