We next compared the efficiency and accuracy of BBAP to different assembly methods using both full and partial D2_1 data set. Similar to BBAP FD, the full data set assemblies by Velvet, MetaVelvet, SOAPdenovo, and Genovo resulted in fragmented contigs. De novo assembly of full data set with Velvet resulted in 13 contigs with maximum and average lengths of 1102 bp and 303 bp, respectively (Table 2) , and recovered only 19% of the HBV genome (Fig. 1b , Additional file 2: Figure S1 ). MetaVelvet assembly results, which are based on initial Velvet assembly results, did not show any improvement and were completely identical to Velvet assembly results for both full and partial data set. SOAPdenovo generated 8 assembled contigs with maximum and average lengths of 934 bp and 340 bp, respectively, and covered 14% of the HBV genome (Fig. 1c) . Genovo assembly for the D2_1 data set resulted in a total of 60 contigs with maximum and average contig lengths of 1352 bp and 395 bp, respectively, but only 44% of the HBV genome were recovered ( Fig. 1d , Additional file 2: Figure S1 ). We proposed that the high polymorphic nature of virus quasispecies may have hindered the efficiency of sequence assembly, and a randomly extracted yet less polymorphic partial data set may provide a better start for initial assembly as shown in FD vs. PD assemblies. Assembly results of different methods all show that the assembly of the partial data set not only generated longer contigs, but also recovered more than 90% of the full HBV genome, demonstrating that exclusion of low redundant HRURs by random selection of partial data effectively reduced level of polymorphism which, in turn, improved the assembly results as judged by contig length and coverage ( Table 2 , Additional file 2: Figure S1 ). We also noticed that BBAP had better performance in recovering structural variants than the other methods tested. While some of BBAP assembled HBV variants were validated by PCR sequencing (Fig. 2) , both Velvet/ MetaVelvet and SOAPdenovo did not identify any contigs with HBV structural variation. Although Genovo assembled 34 structural containing contigs, their accuracies were questionable as most of them with non-retraceable junction regions (Additional file 2: Figure S8 and Additional file 3: SC).
