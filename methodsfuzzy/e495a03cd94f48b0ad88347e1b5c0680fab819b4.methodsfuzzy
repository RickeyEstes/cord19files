Antibody generation, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Polyclonal antibody production in rabbits was carried out by Eurogentec (Belgium) applying the standard (87-days) immunization protocol. For intracellular PAFB detection, cell extracts were prepared from 24-144 h old P. chrysogenum Q176 mycelia. Frozen and grinded mycelia (0.5 g) were extracted with one ml protein extraction buffer (12.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8; 2.0% glycerol (v/v); 0.4% SDS; 2.5% b-mercaptoethanol(v/v)). The samples were then incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 10 min, 20 °C). The supernatant was collected and subjected to 18% (w/v) tris-glycine SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For the detection of PAFB in the P. chrysogenum culture broth, 25 µL of 10-fold concentrated supernatant was separated by 18% (w/v) tris-glycine SDS-PAGE. Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio Trace, Pall), which were blocked for 2 h in PBS/0.3% Tween (v/v)/3.0% skimmed milk powder (w/v) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-PAFB antiserum (1:1,000 in PBS/0.3% Tween (v/v)/1.0% skimmed milk powder (w/v)). After washing in PBS / 0.3% Tween (3 ×10 min) the membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:10,000 in PBS/0.3% Tween (v/v)/1.0% skimmed milk powder (w/v) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed and proteinimmunocomplexes were visualized using NBT/BCIP (Promega).
