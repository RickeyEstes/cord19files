In Japan, due to the decentralised implementation of vaccination programme, price and subsidy by each municipality is not monitored or surveyed, while uptake rate by the municipality is published yearly by the central government [15] . We conducted a nationwide sample survey on price, subsidy, and uptake rate of vaccination in order to illustrate the trend of national averages, of which results were published elsewhere [16] . In this survey, operational 300 samples were randomly selected using a list of 22,671,944 people aged 65 and over inhabiting all 3252 municipalities during 2002/2003 season as a sampling frame. A questionnaire inquiring price charged to a recipient, subsidy provided by the municipality, the number of target population, and the number of vaccinated from 2001/2002 to 2004/2005 season was sent to each municipal authorities where operational samples inhabited. The use of the combination of individual level sampling frame and municipality level survey is chosen, since large-scale mergers of municipalities underwent in these years as a local government reform. 196 authorities out of 210 replied, which gave response rate of 94.0% at sample level. In this study, we assume the operational samples of this survey as an operational panel, in which each sample faces various prices of flu shot for four times between 2001/2002 and 2004/2005 season, since the level of subsidy is usually set by a yearly negotiation between local authority and local medical association. We use uptake rates as a measure of demand assuming them as the probability of an operational sample to receive a shot. In the literature, non-cash price such as travel cost or time cost has been proven to be significant in the demand for health care [17] , including flu shots [18] . Since shots are usually provided at almost all local hospitals and clinics under cooperation with their municipal authority, we calculate the number of hospitals and clinics divided by the area of municipality to gain density of shot location as a variable of non-cash price surrogating travel cost using System of Social and Demographic Statistics (SSDS) by Statistics Bureau [19] . We added this variable to our operational panel data. Income or budget constraint is also significant in the demand at individual level [20] . However, it is not possible to define any variable of income for our operational sample that can be combined with our operational panel data, because we construct our operational sample not through an actual observation of individuals but through an interpretation of market level observation. Average income of people aged 65 and over by the municipality is not available in SSDS, but average income per capita is available. We add this variable to our operational panel data as a controlling variable considering it as an activity level of local economy, although we do not speculate any systematic effect on the demand. Some factors such as influenza morbidity or mortality in the previous season or current season are found influential on the demand for influenza vaccination [18, 21] . In this study, however, we do not incorporate any variable that represent such factors. We also leave the level of public relations or health education untreated due to lack of data. Instead, we leave these as unobserved and intend to control their effect on the demand using panel estimation [22] [23] [24] . We specified four equations in order to estimate price elasticity as below: where r is uptake rate, p is price of a shot, d is density of shot location, y is income per capita, ε is error term, i represents each sample in a season, and N is number of samples in a season. Uptake rate, price of a shot, and density of shot location are converted into logarithm so that we can interpret coefficientˇ1 andˇ2 as elasticity [25] . Income is also converted into logarithm, since unit of measurement, yen, is the same as price, while we do not interpretˇ3 as income elasticity. According to this equation, season models from where c is consumer price index, t represents observed season, M represents each sample in the panel regardless of the observed season, and T is number of observed seasons. Consumer price index is incorporated for the purpose of controlling the effect of inflation over the season. With this equation, we estimate pool models where v it represents disturbance. This equation is for panel estimation of random effect model. where˛i represents fixed effect regarding ith sample, and u it represents reminder disturbance. This equation is for panel estimation of fixed effect model. With (3) and (4), we estimate two panel models, which are compared with pool model and each other with diagnostic tests such as Hausman test of misspecification. A previous study [14] reports price elasticity in 13 big cities, and there are some that reports the difference in utilisation of preventive services, for example, mass health examination [26] , and cancer screening programme [27] , between urban and rural inhabitants in Japan. Inhabitants of rural area tend to use more preventive service voluntarily compared to urban inhabitants. Taking these studies into account, in addition to estimating national models using all operational samples, urban models using only samples that live in cities, and rural models using only samples that live in towns or villages are also estimated. Because of our sampling design, both models can be interpreted as representative of each area in Japan. Statistical package software STATA 9 is used for computation. Table 1 shows summary statistics of variables. National average of uptake rate, the demand, increased remarkably from 29.9% in 2001/2002 season to 49.6% in 2004/2005 season, which resulted in 41.1% over all seasons. Similar increases are also observed in urban area and rural area, while higher rates are observed in rural area than in urban area. It should be noted that the observed period is the beginning of the programme, during which there is supposed to bring about the broad diffusion of vaccination [28] . Additionally, outbreaks such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 season and avian flu in 2002/2003 season occurred, and a word, "influenza", was heavily publicised during these seasons. The need of preparation for the emergence of pandemic influenza virus was also emphasised by the government in the follow-ing years. Such information may have affect on consumers' behaviour. National average of price in all seasons is ¥1134 (US$9.86: US$1 = ¥115). The lowest price is ¥0 (US$0), and the highest ¥2500 (US$21.74). A shot is slightly more expensive in rural area than in urban area. National average of density of shot location, the non-cash price, is 2.0 per km 2 , and it ranges from 0.0023 per km 2 to 20 per km 2 . Urban average is smaller than rural as anticipated. National average of income, the activity level of local economy, is ¥3,439,000 (US$29,900), and it ranges from ¥2,407,000 (US$20,900) to ¥4,970,000 (US$43,200). Urban average is larger than rural as anticipated. National average of subsidy is ¥2962 (US$25.76), and it ranges from ¥0 (US$0) to ¥4599 (US$39.99), while national average of subsidy level 72.1%, from 0% to 100%. Urban municipal authorities tend to expend more subsidy than rural authorities. Table 2 shows the results of OLS estimation of Eq. Negative non-cash price elasticity is found in most of the models, which is also anticipated. Activity level of local economy is not significant as a determinant of the demand in all models. Table 3 shows the results of OLS estimation of Eq. becomes significant as a determinant of the demand in national model and urban model. Table 4 shows the results of panel estimation of Eqs. (3) and (4), random effect models and fixed effect models. Random effect models are selected over pool models by Breusch and Pagan Lagrangizan Multiplier tests, which reject null hypothesis that the variance of individual effect is zero. The demand depends significantly on price in rural model. Negative price elasticity is estimated as −0.00581 in national model, and −0.0537 in rural model, while positive price elasticity is estimated as 0.0248 in urban model, which is similar to pool models. Non-cash price elasticity becomes positive without significance in all models. With negative coefficient, activity level of local economy is significant as a determinant of the demand in national model and urban model, which is the same as pool models.
