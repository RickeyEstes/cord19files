Five HCV 229E viruses, isolates 229E, KI, LP, PR and TO, were used. The 229E prototype strain was originally obtained from Dr. D. Hamre, and The cpe produced in rolled monolayers of MRCc and MRC16 cells by the HCV 229E group isolates 229E, KI, LP, PR and TO was examined under different cultural conditions. Two types of cpe were observed in HCV-infected cells. One type was a diffuse rounding-up of cells over the whole of the cell sheet (Fig. la) . The other cpe consisted of a diffuse rounding-up of cells together with the formation of syncytia (Fig. lb) . The multinucleate cells first appeared as clear refractile cells which developed a granular appearance. In later stages giant cells with nuclei around the periphery, and large vacuolated cells, sometimes with no nuclei, were observed. Both types of cpe were observed by 4 days after infection, and the cpe gradually progressed to the whole monolayer. An uninfected cell monolayer is shown in Fig. 1 c. Syncytia were only seen in infected rolled monolayers: infected stationary monolayers produced only diffuse rounding-up of cells. The cpe observed in all infected MRCc cells and high passage (greater than 20 passes) MRCI6 cells was always of the non-syncytial type. However, both types of cpe were obtained in infected MRC16 cells of less than 20 passes. The proportion of syncytia in these low passage MRC16s varied with a number of factors including the passage number, the medium used, the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) and the HCV isolate used. Table 1 shows the results of a typical experiment. Different HCV isolates produced different proportions of cpe, with up to 60% of the cpe in the form of syncytia for 229E, but less than 20% for TO. Infection with low m.o.i. (0.01 or less) with HCV isolates produced higher proportions of syncytia in the cpe than higher m.o.i. is also common to HCVs, and this feature may be characteristic of all coronaviruses.
