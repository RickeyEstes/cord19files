The role of the endothelial cells (EC) of the hepatic sinusoid as a sieving barrier between the sinusoid and the space of Disse has been evoked by several authors. 1-11 We demonstrated that the damage to the sinusoidal lining allows viruses that are normally nonhepatotropic to infect hepatocytes. 12'13 Although the experimental evidence is still limited, there are some arguments to support the view that EC may control the entry of chylomicrons into the space of Disse ~3 and thus play a role in the lipoprotein metabolism of the liver. 6-s Moreover, it appears that the filtering capacity Mice. A/J and BALB/c mice (20 to 25 g body weight) were obtained from the Centre de S~lection et d'Elevage d'Animaux de Laboratoire (Orl4ans, France) and IFFA CREDO (L'Arbresle, France), respectively, and kept under conventional conditions. Care of animals followed the appropriate guidelines. Six-to 8-week-old animals were infected intraperitoneally with 2 × 103 pfu (plaque-forming units) of MHV3 for 24 (5 animals) and 48 (5 animals) hours. Immunization. A nonpathogen temperature-sensitive mutant of MHV3, D22245 was injected three times intraperitoneally at 2-week intervals into BALB/c mice (103 pfu/injection). Chemicals. Collagenase CLS from Clostridium histolyticure was purchased from Worthington (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). CB, obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St Louis, MO), was dissolved with dimethylsulfoxide (2.5 mg/mL) and then diluted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium to obtain a final concentration of 10 #g/mL. Liver Perfusion In Situ. Mice were anesthetized with ether and their livers perfused in situ through the portal vein with oxygenated Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with or without 10 #g/mL CB, at a flow rate of 2 mL/min for 1 hour at 37°C. The livers were then fixed by perfusion for electron microscopy. 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.075 mol/L cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 4.5% sucrose, 1 mmol/L MgC12 and 1 mmol/L CaC12. The livers were fixed by perfusion through the portal vein with the same fixative. For transmission electron microscopy, the cells and small liver blocks were postfixed with 1% phosphate-buffered OSO4, dehydrated with ethanol, and embedded in Lx 112 (Ladd, Burlington, VT). For scanning electron microscopy, the cells and the liver samples were dehydrated with ethanol, dried with hexamethyldisilazane, 4s and coated with gold. For freeze-fracture, small blocks of livers were immersed in 30% glycerol in cacodylate buffer for at least 1 hour at 4°C then cut to fit in the specimen holder and frozen in subcooled nitrogen. Freeze-fracture replicas obtained in a Reichert-Jung 190 Cryofract freeze-fracture device (Cambridge Instruments, Villepinte, France) were cleaned with sodium hypochloride, washed in three changes of distilled water, and mounted on hexagonal 700-mesh gold grids. The samples were observed either in a Philips EM 410 or in a Philips SEM 501 B (Eindhoven, The Netherlands) electron microscope, respectively. Morphometry. The measurements of the different parameters were performed on scanning electron microscopy photographs with a Kontron semiautomatic MOP videoplan analyzer (Eching-Munich, Germany). To determine the diameter and the porosity (which is the percentage of the cell surface opened by fenestrae), approximately 1,000 #m 2 was measured at a magnification of )<20,000.
