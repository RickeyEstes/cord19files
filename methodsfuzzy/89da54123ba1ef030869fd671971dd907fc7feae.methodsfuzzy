DNA vaccines may cause indel mutations, the risks of which depend on the mechanism of delivery. Despite nonviral gene delivery systems being safer than viral vectors, risks of insertional mutagenesis are not zero, although the risks are believed to be lower than those of everyday random mutations. Unfortunately, often such nonviral risks are based on the insertion of a functional fluorescence-based marker where the entire functional sequence must be inserted not only within the genome but also into a region that is expressed. Nonviral risks of insertional mutagenesis may be higher than that currently believed. Such risks are also a function of the sequence and whether the DNA is supercoiled. The administration of a DNA vaccine exposes the patient to foreign DNA or its fragments that could be inserted into the host's chromosomal DNA [70] . In the case of incorporation into an exon, an insertional mutation or a frameshift mutation occurs. Such mutations can cause a gene to malfunction or inactivate (i.e., a tumor suppressor gene). The insertion of foreign genes into the host genome could also lead to constituent expression of previously silent bacterial/parasite genes that have been inserted. The insertion may also increase the probability of rearrangements or breaking. The guidelines for industrial production of DNA vaccines published by the FDA recommend that the pDNA is supercoiled to more than 80% to help prevent insertional mutagenesis. It has been reported that the FDA recommends integration studies, regardless of the delivery method, if there are greater than 10,000 copies of foreign DNA per microgram of host DNA [71] . Interestingly, minicircle DNA [51, 53, 54, 72, 73] and ministring DNA [74, 75] have been reported to have less risk of insertional mutagenesis because the major bacterial DNA (i.e., the unmethylated CpG repeats functioning as PAMPs) is removed. Lipids or cationic, amine-containing polymers are often complexed with anionic plasmid macromolecules into nanosized particles, and this facilitates cellular uptake and inhibits the degradation of the plasmid during trafficking both extracellularly and intracellularly. In an uncomplexed state, half-lives of plasmids extracellularly in serum and intracellularly is in the order of a few minutes and hours, respectively. The mass of free polymer carrier in the solution is critical for the delivery efficiency and is typically administered in manyfold excess for transfection to occur. Owing to the need for free polymer to be in excess, despite taking advantage of the enhanced permeability and retention effect for the larger polyplexes, the free polymer is not able to sufficiently transport to the site of interest [105] . For this reason, nonviral gene delivery systems are often injected locally. Furthermore, many researchers have endeavored to improve the buffering capacity, but generally, the carriers are excessively toxic by doing so. Interested readers may refer to the following review for further information with regard to nonviral gene delivery barriers [82, 106, 107] . The following paragraphs discuss cell specificity, hydrophobicity, the proton sponge effect, and nuclear uptake for the readers' convenience.
