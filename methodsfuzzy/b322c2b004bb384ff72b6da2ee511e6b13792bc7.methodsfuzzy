Data-Driven Contact Network. The model considers a weighted multiplex network (38) G = (G H , G S , G W , G C ), where H, S, W, and C represent household, school, workplace, and community layers, respectively. Let us define V as the set of all nodes, which is common to all layers, and Eα as the set of edges in layer α. We can thus characterize each layer Gα = (V, Eα) by the layer-specific adjacency matrix A α , where elements a α ij = wα > 0 if there is a link between nodes i and j in layer α and a α ij = 0 otherwise. Homogeneous Mixing Network. This model assumes a single fully connected network. Following the notation introduced above, we have a ij = w for each i and j, where w = 1/(N − 1) and N is the total number of individuals in the population. The Epidemic Transmission Model. On each of the introduced networks, we simulate the influenza transmission process as an SIR model. The SIR model assumes that individuals can be in one of the following three states: susceptible, infectious, and removed. Two types of transitions between states are possible: (i) from susceptible to infectious and (ii) from infectious to removed. The transition from susceptible to infectious requires a contact between an infectious individual and a susceptible individual. Specifically, given that, at time step t, node j is infectious and its neighbor node i is susceptible, the probability that j infects i (i.e., i changes its status from susceptible to infectious) is given by β = pw, where p is the transmission probability per contact and w is the contact weight. However, the transition from infectious to removed does not involve contact between individuals. Given that, at time step t, node i is in the infectious state, it has a probability γ to recover at time step t + 1. Estimation of R (t ) from Transmission Events Time Series. Following the same approach used in refs. 11 and 17, we assume that the daily number of new cases C(t) at time t can be approximated by a Poisson according to the following equation: where here, P(k, λ) is the probability mass function of a Poisson distribution (i.e., the probability of observing k events if these events occur with a known rate λ). The posterior distribution of R(t) is then explored using MCMC sampling.
