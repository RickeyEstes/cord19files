We conducted a cross-sectional survey to determine healthcare utilization patterns for acute respiratory, diarrhea, neurologic and febrile illnesses: we report here only the results for acute respiratory infections. We used a stratified, two-stage cluster sampling procedure. Communities in the 2002 Guatemalan census were stratified as to whether or not they had a hospital or health center located in their community. As the first stage of sampling, 30 communities were selected within each stratum, using probability proportional to the population of each community, for a total of 60 clusters. Maps detailing household locations were obtained from the Guatemalan Census Bureau for these communities and 20 houses were randomly selected for a total of 1200 houses. Interviews were conducted in person from October 1 through December 13, 2006. All persons who had lived in the house for at least six of the preceding 12 months were considered members of the household and eligible for inclusion, including persons deceased at the time of the survey if they had been resident during the reference period. Infants <6 months of age were included if they had lived in the household since birth. Households were excluded if a head of household or consenting adult was unavailable after visiting the house on three separate occasions over at least two days, or if the household head declined to participate. Excluded households were not replaced. If a house was abandoned or no longer existed, another house was randomly chosen for inclusion.
