Canine glial cell cultures. Dissociated brain cell cultures were established from 1 -to 2-dayold specific-pathogen-free beagle dogs by a modification of the McCarthy and DeVellis 19 method . The animals were killed with ether and the brain aseptically removed . The cerebral hemispheres and midbrain were retained and the meninges were removed . This tissue was mechanically dissociated by gently triturating 15 times through a wide bore pipette . The brain tissue was suspended in 15 ml of Eagle's Basal Medium and shaken on a rotary shaker for 15 min at 150 rpm at 37Â°C followed by addition of trypsin (0 .1% final concentration) . The tissue then continued incubation for 20 min . The cell suspension in Eagle's Basal Medium containing 15% fetal calf serum (FCS) was filtered through cheesecloth and then nylon filters (Nitex 130 and 35) . The cells were seeded at a concentration of 5 x 10 5 live cells per ml in 1 .0 ml Leighton tubes containing 35 x 1 1 cm glass coverslips . After 4 days in vitro culture medium was replaced . After 7 days in vitro the FCS concentration was reduced to 10% and the medium was replaced three times a week . The cultures were incubated at 37' in the presence of 5% Co e . Confluency Detection of viral antigen in astrocytes . CDV antigen was localized within astrocytes by double immunofluorescence . Coverslips were fixed in acetone for 5 min at room temperature, rinsed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Dako Corp .) diluted 1 :50 in PBS . This was followed by a PBS rinse and a second incubation in rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel) diluted 1 :20 . Viral antigen within the astrocytes was then identified with anti-CDV hyperimmune dog serum directly conjugated to fluorescein ." Cells were viewed on a Leitz epifluorescent microscope equipped with rhodamine (530-560 nm) and fluorescein (470-490 nm) filters . The percentage of infected astrocytes was determined weekly from 7 to 63 days p .i . Using a 50xwater immersion objective, (Leitz Corp .) the total number of astrocytes in a field, identified by GFAP staining under rhodamine fluorescence, was counted . Changing the filter from rhodamine to fluorescein then allowed the number of CDV infected astrocytes in the same field to be counted (Fig . 2 ) . Ten random fields, containing an average of 20 astrocytes per field, were examined on each coverslip . The percentage of infected astrocytes in each field was determined and an average of these 10 fields was calculated . At each time point, three coverslips from CDV-SH, CDV A75-17 and CDV-RO infected cultures were evaluated and results averaged . Thus infection at each time point for the three viral strains is based on an examination of approximately 600 astrocytes . The data reported are from one representative experiment ; each experiment was repeated at least three times . In addition to detection of CDV antigen, viral inclusion bodies were visualized by staining with Shorr stain . Cultures were fixed for 1 min in 50% ether/50% ethanol and rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol . They were then stained for 20 seconds in Harris's Hematoxylin, rinsed, and stained in Shorr stain (Harleco Corp .) for 1 min, dehydrated in ethanol and mounted in permount for light microscope viewing .
