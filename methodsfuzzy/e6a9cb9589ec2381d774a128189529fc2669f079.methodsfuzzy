CSF samples which previously tested positive by viral qPCR were selected from two biobanks of the departments of medical microbiology and neurology of the Amsterdam UMC (location AMC). An HIV-1 qPCR was performed using the RealTime HIV-1 Viral Load Assay (Abbott Molecular, Abbott Park, IL, USA), the other viruses were tested by in-house qPCRs using previously published methods [19] . The first sample set consisted of anonymized leftover CSF samples (n = 27), sent in from patients with suspected CNS infection. The second set of CSF samples (n = 18) were selected from a clinical study on the etiology of encephalitis and meningitis in adult patients [2] . The study was approved by the medical ethics committee of the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands (reference number 2014_290). All samples had a quantifiable viral load and were stored at −80 • C until library preparation for VIDISCA-NGS. VIDISCA library preparation was performed as previously described [9, 17] . Briefly, CSF samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was treated with TURBO™ DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to remove naked chromosomal or bacterial DNA. Nucleic acids were extracted using the Boom method [20] , followed by reverse transcription with non-ribosomal random hexamers [21] and second strand synthesis. DNA was digested with MseI (TˆTAA; New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and ligated to adapters containing a sample identifier sequence. During the fragmentation in VIDISCA, the sample cannot be "over-digested" as fragmentation relies entirely on the presence of restriction enzyme recognition sites and not on the duration of fragmentation. Ligation to adaptors leads to loss of the restriction enzyme recognition site (after ligation to an adaptor the sequence is TTAT) whereas ligation to another DNA fragment will restore it, allowing re-digestion. Next, size selection with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) was performed to remove small DNA fragments prior to a 28-cycle PCR using adaptor-annealing primers. Small and large size selection was performed with AMPure XP beads to select DNA-strands with a length ranging between 100 and 400 nucleotides. Libraries were analyzed using the Bioanalyzer (High Sensitivity Kit, Agilent Genomics, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Qubit (dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific) instruments to quantify DNA length and concentration, respectively. Seventy sample libraries were pooled at the equimolar concentration. The current number of 70 samples was chosen because this has worked for other sample types (non-CSF) [16, 17] . In total, 50 pmol DNA of the pool was clonally amplified on beads using the Ion Chef System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sequencing was performed on the Ion PGM™ System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the ION 316 Chip (400 bp read length and 2 million sequences per run). The method for the DNase-free VIDISCA library preparation omitted the TURBO™ DNase step. All VIDISCA-NGS reads with a minimum length of 45 nucleotides were translated into protein sequences and aligned to a local database of the NCBI eukaryotic viral Identical Protein Groups (downloaded March 2018) using UBLAST [22] , the VIDISCA bioinformatics workflow [23] , and an online metagenomic profiler (Taxonomer) [24] for identification of probable viral reads and background sequence classification. Probable viral reads were subsequently confirmed when the original VIDISCA-NGS read could be aligned to a reference sequence of the virus with a nucleotide identity of at least 80% using CodonCode Aligner (version 6.0.2). Each alignment was manually inspected for confirmation. Samples were considered VIDISCA-NGS positive when at least one VIDISCA-NGS read could be identified. The number of reads aligned to a reference sequence in CodonCode Aligner was taken as the number of viral reads per sample. Analysis by VIDISCA-NGS was performed blind to qPCR results to avoid biased analysis. All statistical analyses were performed in R (version 3.5.1), and graphs were plotted using R package ggplot2 (version 3.1.0).
