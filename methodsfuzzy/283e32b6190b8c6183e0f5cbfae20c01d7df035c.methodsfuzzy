Our study was focused on DCCs. These are institutions that provide childcare while parents are at work. Besides basic care, these centers offer children a wide range of activities for their entertainment, including some educational activities. DCCs provide care for infants, toddlers and pre-school children (up to 5---6 years old). We chose to study DCCs from the two main Portuguese cities (Lisbon and Oporto) mainly for reasons of feasibility. These are busy cities with different air pollution sources which influence outdoor air quality. DCCs are located in different places: some are in apartments, others in isolated villas (with or without gardens, terraces or other forms of outdoor spaces), some in modern buildings and others in very old parts of town. In our country, children DCCs vary from fully State-run to joint or solely private ventures. We approached the Instituto da Segurança Social (the DCC national regulatory authority) in order to obtain a list of potential DCCs to be included in the study. For this study, only the private social security institutions (IPSS) included in the list were considered, for practical reasons, as they broadly provided all the age ranges that we aimed to study and their participation was expected to be easier. Those DCCs (IPSS) belonged either to Confederação Nacional de Instituições de Solidariedade or to União das Misericórdias Portuguesas, both of which supported our study. The project was designed to be carried out in two different phases. During Phase I we collected data on building characteristics and some preliminary IAQ indicators, and used a small screening health questionnaire. In Phase II a new health questionnaire was distributed to the same children who attended the selected DCCs, and a more detailed assessment of IAQ, building characteristics and ventilation was carried out. The project flowchart can be found in Figure 1 . Task description will be divided in the two phases.
