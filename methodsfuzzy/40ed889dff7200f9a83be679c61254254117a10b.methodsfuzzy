The techniques used for assessing the purity of the final product must be able to detect small levels of impurity. Table VI summarizes different techniques that can be employed. Electrophoretic methods such as SDS-PAGE, native gels, urea gels, gradient gels, isoelectric focusing gels, and two-dimensional gels are the simplest, least expensive, and the most widely used methods. Gel filtration chromatography and analytical reverse-phase HPLC are two other powerful tools used for checking homogeneity of the [2] subunits has been reported using laser desorption spectrometry. 47 Protein amino acid sequences can be determined by tandem mass spectrometry using a triple-quadruple mass spectrometer. In this process, protonated peptide ions are selected with the first mass spectrometer and are transmitted to a collision cell. Low energy collision with neutral inert gases such as argon results in fragment ions that are then detected in a second mass spectrometer. The fragmentation patterns of peptides obtained are indicative of their amino acid sequences and thereby allow for the determination of peptide sequences as well as determination of any posttranslational modifications occurring within the protein. Phosphorylation, sulfation, and glycosylation at specific amino acids in the purified proteins are now routinely identified by mass spectrometry. Since these techniques allow analysis of large molecules at the low femtomole level, they may prove to be very useful in purity determinations. In summary, the purification protocol used for a particular polymerase will depend on the experiments to be performed with the pure enzyme. While a single affinity chromatography step may be sufficient for some experiments, for others several steps may be required to remove not only the minor contaminating proteins but also the nonspecific activities that can interfere with specific polymerase activities.
