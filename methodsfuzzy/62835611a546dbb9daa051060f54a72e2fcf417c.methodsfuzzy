DNA vaccines encoding M.tuberculosis HSP65 and human IL-12 were encapsulated into HVJ-Envelope or HVJ-liposomes [6] . CTL activity was assessed by 51 C r -release assay [1, 7] . At 5 and 10 weeks after intravenous challenge of M.tuberculosis H37RV, the number of CFU in the lungs, spleen, and liver were counted and therapeutic efficacy of HVJ-Envelope DNA vaccines was evaluated [1]. Therapeutic efficacy was also evaluated by chronic TB infection model of mice using aerosol challenge of TB (15CFU/mouse: Madison aerosol exposure chamber, University of Wisconsin). Cynomolgus monkeys were housed in a BL 3 animal facility of the Leonard Wood Memorial Research Center. The animals were vaccinated nine times with the HVJ-envelope with expression plasmid of both HSP65 and human IL-12 (HSP65 + hIL-12/HVJ: 400ug i.m.), one week after the challenge with the M.tuberculosis Erdman strain (5Ã—10 2 ) by intratracheal instillation. Immune responses and survival were examined as described in our previous studies [2, 5] .
