Inbred male F344 rats of 7 to 12 weeks (165 to 250 g body weight) were used. Microbiological examinations were carried out at the Pathology Laboratory of the Medical Research Council, Carshaiton, according to standard techniques and recommendations of the (former) Accreditation MicrobioIogical Advisory Committee 1121. Germ-free rats were reared in isolators according to standard procedures [ 131 and with regular sterility checks 1141. The latter consisted of weekly screening of faecal samples (direct microscopical examination by Wayson's vital stain and cultures in media and incubation conditions appropriate for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, mycoplasma and fungi), and less frequent screening of whole animals (including serological tests for the detection of viral contamination). Conventional rats were reared in unbarriered animal facilities. Routine microbiological screening of this conventional F344 colony revealed a low positive antibody titre against Sendai virus in the first batch of rats used (preliminary experi- Two main experiments were conducted; experiment 1 involved 12 conventional and 12 germ-free rats and experiment 2 involved 8 conventional and 8 germ-free rats. In both experiments, the conventional rats (born in the same week as the germfree rats) had been placed, 1 week before dosing, in an isolator in the germ-free unit and treated in the same way as germ-free rats (sterilised food and water, vitamin K supplementation, peracetic acid exposure, etc.). OSSMe (synthetised by Dr. P. Farmer, MRC Toxicology Unit, and 99.7% pure as assessed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) was dissolved in saline (75 to 100 mg/ml), sterilised by y-irradiation and kept at 4Â°C for a maximum of 2 weeks until used. Sterilisation did not affect the purity of the compound. Animals were dosed subcutaneously in the nape of the neck; control animals were left untreated. The germ-free rats were weighed with a spring balance within the isolator, but for convenience the conventional rats were weighed and dosed outside their isolator. For the microbiological investigations blood for serological studies was drawn by transthoracic cardiac puncture after CO z euthanasia and swabs from the nasopharynx, lung sections (conventional rats only), and caecal contents (germ-free rats only) were cultured. For the histological studies, rats were anaesthetised with ether, their abdominal vessels were transected, the thoracic organs removed en bloc, the left bronchus clamped and the left lung dissected for estimating lung wet and dry weights (the left lung consistently represents 35% of the total lung weight, and was dried 48 h at 1OS'C). Phosphate-buffered formalin (pH 7.2) was slowly instilled into the trachea with a syringe until the right lung lobes appeared fully distended. After fixation and cutting, the tissue was embedded in paraffin and 5-pm sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin.
