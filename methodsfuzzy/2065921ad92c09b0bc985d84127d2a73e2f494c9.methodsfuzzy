In order to validate the ability of the current model in capturing the transient jet propagation and decay with distance, an experimental set-up was constructed in a controlled climatic chamber conditioned by a DV system (Fig. 3a) . The experimental room is of inner dimensions 2.5 m Â 2.75 m Â 2.8 m with supply and return grills cross-sectional area of respectively 0.582 m (width) Â 0.24 m (height) and 0.44 m (width) Â 0.19 m (height). Two occupants were represented by thermal cylinders of 0.3 m in diameter and 1.2 m in height generating each 100 W. Due to the experimental constraint of highly insulated walls, the load was distributed between the lighting (100 W) and the heated cylinders such that the load per unit floor area is approximately 40 W/m 2 . The DV supply conditions were a flow rate of 100 L/s and a temperature of 22 C. A thermo anemometer (ABK precision 731A) with an accuracy of ±0.6 C for temperature measurements and ± 2% of full scale for velocity measurements was used. In order to remove particles from the supplied air before introducing it to the chamber, high efficiency particulate filters (KS-NG-K1/2 HEPA filters) were adopted. Prior to each set of measurements, the light and the heated cylinders were turned on and the DV system was run for 3e4 h to reach steady-state conditions. Then mono-disperse heavy 5 mm particles of density of 912 kg/m 3 were generated from a condensation aerosol generator (TSI Model 3475) (Fig. 3b) with a flow rate of 4 L/min at a velocity of 10 m/s during 4 s. The TSI generator used can generate monodisperse particles with an aerosol geometric standard deviation smaller than 1.1. A chronometer watch of 0.01 s accuracy was used to control the generation time. The validation consisted of comparing measured and predicted particles concentrations at different distances (0.5, 1, and 1.5 m) from the generation (Fig. 3a) . Particle concentrations were measured using an optical particle sizer (TSI model 3330) (Fig. 3b) giving measurements with a relative error lower than 5%. A sampling time of 1 s was selected to track particle concentration variation with time. Results were recorded automatically by a computer for post-processing. The measured concentrations were normalized by the generation concentration for comparison with the predictions of the simplified model.
