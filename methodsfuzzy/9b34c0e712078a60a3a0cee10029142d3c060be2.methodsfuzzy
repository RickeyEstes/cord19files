ELISA antigens prepared by detergent treatment (octyl-b D-glucopyranoside : Aldrich) of LLCPKI cells, infected with the Purdue strain of TGEV or mock-infected, were coated onto alternate wells of flexible polystyrene ELISA plates (Falcon) with 0 .1 M bicarbonate buffer pH 9 .6 . A full description of the preparation of these antigens is given in a report on experiences with a TGEV-specific, serological test that distinguishes TGEV from PRCV and which utilizes the same antigens (Brown & Paton, 1991) . Fifty microlitres of a 1 in 5 dilution of test serum were added to each of duplicate pairs of wells and left overnight at room temperature . The remainder of the test could be completed within an hour, all incubations being at 37Â°C . A 1/10 000 dilution of mAb 6A .C3 in PBS pH 7 .2 with 0 .05% Tween 20 (PBST) and 10% ox serum was dispensed into all wells without removing the test serum and left for 10 min . After washing, bound 6A .C3 was detected by a goat antimouse peroxidase conjugate (Nordic : 1/2000 for 30 min) and a tetramethyl benzidine/ hydrogen peroxide substrate (10 min) . The substrate reaction was stopped with 2 M sulphuric acid . PBST was used for washing the plates between stages and as the serum diluent . The conjugate diluent was PBST plus 5% negative pig serum .
