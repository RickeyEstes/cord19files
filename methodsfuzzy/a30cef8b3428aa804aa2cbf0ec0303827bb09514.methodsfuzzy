Construction of Ad5-Fluc virus. Using the firefly luciferase (Fluc) gene derived from pLUCF (kindly provided by John T. Schiller, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA), a replication-incompetent Ad5-Fluc was constructed by deleting the E1 and E3 viral genes using the Cre/loxP-based system 38 . Briefly, PCR was used to construct a recombinant shuttle plasmid, pDC316-Fluc. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with an expression plasmid containing structural genes (pBHGlox-E1,3Cre) and the reporter plasmid for Ad5-Fluc construction using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The recombinant adenovirus containing the Fluc gene (Ad5-Fluc) was acquired by Cre-lox recombination in HEK293 cells. Animal experiments. The mice and rats used in this study were housed and handled strictly in accordance with the guidelines set by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC; Frederick, MD, USA). The study protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC; Beijing, China). Four-week-old Rag2 −/− mice and Rag2 −/− rats, wildtype C57BL/6 mice, and SD rats were obtained from the Institute for Laboratory Animal Resources, NIFDC. Eight groups each of mice (ten per group) and rats (four per group) received a single dose of Ad5-Fluc at 5 × 10 10 pfu/kg (suspended in 100 μl of PBS) by IM inoculation or 5 × 10 10 pfu/kg (suspended in 200 μl of PBS) by IV (tail vein) injection. This dose is equivalent to the higher end of a reasonable range in humans 41, 42 . The mice and rats were examined with BLI at 6 h, 1 day, 3 days, 6 days, 9 days, 20 days, and 35 days post-infection. Ten additional Rag2 −/− and normal animals mice were used as negative controls. To test the immunopathology of Ad5-Fluc in mice, their body weights were monitored and recorded. The mice and rats were humanely euthanized with isoflurane to analyse the biodistribution of Ad5-Fluc in their tissues on day 1 post-infection. BLI analysis. Bioluminescent imaging was performed with the IVIS Lumina Series III Imaging System (PerkinElmer, Baltimore, MD, USA), as described previously 43 . In brief, the mice and rats were anesthetized with successive intraperitoneal injections of pelltobarbitalum natricum (240 mg/kg body weight) and the substrate d-luciferin (50 mg/kg body weight; Xenogen-Caliper Corp., Alameda, CA, USA). The mice and rats were imaged 10 min later. To image individual tissues, mice and rats were dissected rapidly, and the bioluminescence was quantified by using the IVIS system to analyse the tissues ex vivo within 3 min of dissection. Luminescence was acquired with an exposure time of 60 s, and regions of interest (ROIs) were analysed with the Living Image software (Caliper Life Sciences, Baltimore, MD, USA). The relative intensities of the emitted light are presented as pseudo-coloured images, with colours ranging from red (most intense) to blue (least intense). The signals emitted from different ROIs in the body were measured and are presented as the total flux in photons/s. All data are presented as mean values ± SEM.
