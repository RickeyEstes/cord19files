Processing ProMED/HealthMap data feed We used a set of curated ProMED and HealthMap records on the human cases of Ebola in West Africa. The dates in the feeds ranged from March 2014 to October 2016. Each dataset recorded the cumulative number of suspected/confirmed cases and suspected/confirmed deaths by country at various dates in this period. We derived the country specific daily and weekly incidence time series from these data after the following data cleaning and pre-processing: • We first extracted the total case counts as a sum of suspected and confirmed cases (ProMED and HealthMap data did not record probable cases for the West African Ebola epidemic). • Each unique record in ProMED is associated with a unique alert id. An alert id can correspond to various reports from different sources (news, social media etc.) which might report different case numbers. In such cases, we assigned the median of the case numbers to the record. • In some instances, cumulative case count was inconsistent in that it failed to be monotonically non-decreasing. We identified consecutive dates (t k and t k+1 ) where the cumulative case count was not increasing. If removing either t k or t k+1 made the cumulative case count increasing,
