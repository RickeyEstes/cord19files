Plasmid constructs. For descriptions of the plasmids used in this study, see Text S1 in the supplemental material. Generation and maintenance of cell lines. For information about the cell lines used in this study, see Text S1 in the supplemental material. In vitro transcription and transfection of cell lines. Synthesis of in vitro transcripts and transfection of replicon RNAs by electroporation have been described in detail elsewhere (48) . pTM vectors allowing the expression of JFH-1-derived polyprotein fragments were transfected with the Mirus TransIT-LT1 Transfection Reagent (Mirus Bio LLC) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient-replication assay. For quantification of the replication efficiency of subgenomic replicons containing a firefly luciferase gene, luciferase activity contained in cell lysates was determined at different time points after electroporation as described elsewhere (49) . Immunoblot analysis. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (49) , with antibodies specified in Text S1 in the supplemental material. High-pressure freezing and freeze substitution. Cells grown on sapphire discs were subjected to high-pressure freezing and subsequent epon embedding as previously described (4) . EM analyses of the embedded cells and quantifications were performed as described in Text S1 in the supplemental material. CLEM. Huh7-Lunet/T7 cells grown on patterned sapphire discs and transfected with pTM_NS3-5B_‚å¨D1-GFP were subjected to CLEM as previously reported (4).
