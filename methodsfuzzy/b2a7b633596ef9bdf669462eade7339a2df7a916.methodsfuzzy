2.1. Virus, plaque assay and cell culture HEV 67N strain was initially isolated from the nasal cavity of apparently healthy swine in Iowa, the U.S.A., during a routine survey for viruses harbored in the respiratory tract by Mengeling et al. (1972) . This virus was originally obtained from Dr. W.L. Mengeling (National Animal Disease Laboratory, Ames, IA, USA), passaged 12 times in primary porcine kidney cell cultures (Hirai et al., 1974) and more than 10 times in suckling mouse brains by intracerebral inoculation. This mouse brain-adapted HEV 67N strain was plaquepurified 3 times in an established swine kidney cell line (Hirano et al., 1990) , and thereafter was propagated 20 times in the same cell line until use. The viral supernatant from infected cell culture, with a titer of 10 6 PFU/0.2 ml as assayed by plaque method, was kept at −80 • C, and used for all the experiments. Cell culture and plaque assay of the virus were carried out as described by Hirano et al. (1990) .
