Currently, some human vaccines do not require the use of animals because in vitro methods have been developed that quantify the presence of the protective antigen. These so-called antigen quantification methods are based on binding of key protective antigens in the vaccine batch to specific antibodies using in vitro immunoassays. At the present time, these methods represent the most promising in vitro approaches for the replacement of animals used in vaccine potency testing. It is important to note, however, that in vitro antigen quantification methods only measure antigen quantity and do not necessarily reflect biological activity. Another limitation of these methods is the requirement for adjuvant removal from the product before testing. Therefore, it is necessary to also demonstrate that the process of adjuvant removal does not affect recovery and/or integrity of the antigen, which could interfere with its detection in the assay [35] . Workshop participants agreed that broader access to all relevant information describing successfully implemented alternative potency testing methods would have an obvious impact on expanding their use and acceptance. For example, open online access to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) monographs would greatly facilitate the dissemination of methods and procedures that have been implemented for use by regulators in various regions. Manufacturers are also encouraged to frequently consult with the relevant regulatory authorities regarding their planned study design and how best to incorporate alternative methods into vaccine potency testing (i.e., product-specific validation). All workshop participants recognized the need for harmonization during the vaccine development phase and noted that any guidelines that would standardize an approach, or a roadmap on how to transition from in vivo to in vitro testing, would be helpful. Collaborative interlaboratory studies involving both national control authorities and supranational organizations, such as the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM; Ph. Eur.) and WHO, could accomplish this. Workshop participants recognized that the significant costs and the lack of available funding associated with additional research, development, and validation efforts of in vitro vaccine potency test methods are the primary barriers to progress. More specifically, they agreed that concerns associated with rabies vaccine antigen quantification methods need to be addressed. This includes increasing the availability of reference standards and antisera for the various rabies strains, as well as maintaining a consistent source of antisera (or, preferably, a set of nonproprietary monoclonal antibodies). Workshop participants identified the following issues that would aid in facilitating the broader acceptance of alternative methods: Establishment of readily available and/or nonproprietary reference standards Sharing of resources, including key reagents and assay procedures Educational outreach in bioethics and training in the conduct of 3Rs assays International harmonization of requirements for acceptable test methods Significant differences exist between human and veterinary vaccine production and formulation, most notably the presence of complex adjuvants or adjuvant combinations in veterinary vaccines. Extrapolating results from in vitro methods developed for a veterinary vaccine to the similar human vaccine is often not possible. For example, human influenza vaccines are often not adjuvanted, while veterinary influenza vaccines (e.g., avian, swine) may contain mineral oil or other more complex adjuvants. Use of adjuvants may also result in significantly lower antigen content in veterinary vaccines compared to that present in nonadjuvanted human vaccines. Veterinary vaccines are often not as well characterized as the corresponding human vaccines and are typically composed of complex mixtures that include antigens derived from the whole cell, cell lysates, or cell culture supernatants. Each of these variables could influence both safety and potency of the vaccine product. Table 3 provides a list of veterinary vaccines for which antigen quantification methods have been accepted for use by some regulatory authorities. Taking into account these significant differences between human and veterinary vaccines, workshop participants discussed ways to extrapolate alternative potency testing results from veterinary to human vaccines. Increased interaction and communication between global regulatory agencies, research institutions, and vaccine manufacturers was recognized as the critical first step in this process. One suggestion was to develop an interagency task force to deal with specific issues relevant to both human and veterinary medicine. For example, the increased complexity of adjuvants in certain veterinary vaccines has resulted in a better understanding of adjuvant/antigen interactions, which may be useful to human vaccine manufacturers as additional adjuvants are considered for approval in their products. Conversely, antigen quantification methods that are currently available for human rabies vaccines for inprocess control (WHO technical guidelines) may be useful to veterinary rabies vaccine manufacturers.
