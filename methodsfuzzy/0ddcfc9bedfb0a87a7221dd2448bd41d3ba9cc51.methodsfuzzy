In prior research we have analysed the properties of a simple differential equation model of viral load dynamics in influenza A infection and a number of measurable infection-related quantities which can be derived from this model (Fig 1) [10] . The model has been developed from a standard model [11] , by assuming that the viral dynamics are much faster than those of infected cells. As we do not have quantitative information on the dynamics of infected cells, this is a sensible assumption that allows us to reduce the number of unknown parameters in the system. The model is general enough to be applicable to other acute viral infections. The analytical properties of this model and the derivation of the infection-related quantities have been discussed elsewhere [10] . In brief, the dynamics of the model are given by the following equations: where T is the number of epithelial target cells susceptible to viral infection, V is the viral load (measured in TCID 50 /ml), β is the infection rate of target cells, r is the virus production rate, and γ is the virus death or clearance rate which encompasses the action of specific and non- specific immune mechanisms. The infection-related quantities that can be derived from this model and their interpretations are listed in Table 1 . The analytical expressions of the quantities are given in S1 Table (details in [10] ). We fitted the model to viral load data of nine patients from the placebo groups of volunteer challenge studies conducted by Roche as part of the original Oseltamivir trials, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods [12] . All volunteers were screened for HI titre to exclude pre-existing immunity against the challenge strain. We estimated the parameter values for each patient. See S1 File for a more detailed description of the data and fitting procedure. We used the parameter estimates to determine the infection-related quantities for each patient. We assessed the variability of the quantities among patients by calculating the coefficients of variation (CV). In addition to viral load measurements, the data also included temperature measurements and total symptom scores (Jackson score [13] ) for each patient at different time points. We calculated pairwise correlations (Pearson's r) between individual viral load and temperature measurements over time, and between individual viral load and symptom score measurements over time. We also calculated pairwise correlations between each of the nine infection-related quantities, and between the infection-related quantities and the area under the curve (AUC) of the total symptom scores and the temperature area under the curves. The latter two quantities measure the total symptom severity and temperature increase over the entire course of infection (the total symptom score AUC is the AUC over all Jackson scores at each measured time point). We determined the statistical significance of the correlations with two different correction methods for multiple comparison (11 comparisons in total), the Bonferroni method and the Benjamini-Hochberg method [14] . Written informed consent was obtained from each participant in a form approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, and the University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, and subjects were compensated for participation. The review board of the named institution has approved the study in which the data we used was collected. Table. Compared to the 95% credible intervals of individual parameter estimates, the variation among patients in the infection-related quantities shown in Table 2 is relatively small. This is not surprising considering that the volunteers in the original challenge study were all young, healthy adults from a narrow age band (18-27 years) . The greatest variation among individuals occurs in peak viral load (CV = 1.26) and viral load area under the curve (AUC) (CV = 1.19) (see S3  Table for all coefficients of variation.) Temperature significantly correlates with viral load (r = 0.328, p = 0.0025). Total symptom scores also correlate with viral load (r = 0.233, p = 0.03385). When we determined the correlations between infection-related quantities using the Bonferroni correction, the following correlations were significant: R 0 and the duration of infection (r = 0.947, p bonferroni = 5.902x10 -3 ), viral load AUC and peak viral load (r = 0.9994, p bonferroni = 7.068x10 -10 ), viral load AUC and late viral decay rate (r = 0.9509, p bonferroni = 4.514x10 -3 ), time to peak viral load and generation time (r = 0.9644, p bonferroni = 1.487x10 -3 ), time to peak viral load and initial viral growth rate (r = -0.9459, p bonferroni = 3.384x10 -3 ), and Table 3 for all correlations.
