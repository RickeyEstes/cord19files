Preparation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells The PBMCs of healthy volunteers were obtained from The University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong, China). PBMCs from patient one (pt1) were obtained from Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Rockefeller University (New York, USA). PBMCs from patients 2 and 3 (pt2 and pt3) were obtained from National Center for AIDS/ STD Control and Prevention, China CDC (Beijing, China). All these experiments were approved by ethical committees of the respective institutes, and conducted according to local guidelines and regulations. All three patients were elite controllers. Pt1 was infected with clade B virus whose serum exhibited high titres of broadly neutralizing activity, and a panel of bnmAbs were isolated from pt1 PBMCs by single memory B-cell sorting using gp120 C-C core protein as a bait (pt1 in [18, 28] ). Pt2 and pt3 were infected with clade B' virus and naive to antiretroviral therapy [30] . The sera of pt2 and pt3 also exhibited cross-clade neutralization activity (data not shown). Heparinized whole blood samples were used to isolate human PBMCs by Ficoll density gradient separation. Isolation of genomic DNA, total RNA and mRNA from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells Five to ten million PBMCs were collected from each 5 ml of heparinized whole blood and were used to isolate gDNA and total RNA using Allprep DNA/RNA Mini kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The gDNA was used as a template for amplification of heavy chain variable regions and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions by semi-nested PCR for construction of gDNA antibody single chain antibody fragment (scFv) libraries in phagemid vector pComb3X. Total RNA from uninfected individual PBMCs were pooled and mRNA was prepared from the pooled total RNA using the 'Oligotex mRNA Mini Kit' (Qiagen). The mRNA was used to reverse transcribe cDNA for construction of cDNA antibody libraries. Construction of genomic DNA antibody scFv libraries A total of 67 primers were designed and used in seminested PCR reactions to amplify heavy chain and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions using gDNA as a template, and in SOE-PCR to assemble scFvs for gDNA Copyright Â© Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Reverse primers were mixed at equal molar concentrations prior to semi-nested PCRs. Each sense primer annealing to leader sequences or framework 1 (FR1) regions of heavy chain variable regions or kappa and lambda light chain variable regions was paired with the corresponding mixed antisense primers and used at the same final concentration (10 mmol/l) in the first or second round of PCRs. Each first round of PCR was carried out in a reaction volume of 100 ml containing 90 ng gDNA as a template by running the following PCR programme: initial denaturing at 958C for 3 min, 10 cycles of 958C for 15 s, 458C for 30 s, 728C for 45 s, 20 cycles of 958C for 15 s, 558C for 30 s, 728C for 45 s and an extension cycle of 728C for 10 min. The second round of PCR was carried out using the corresponding first round PCR product as a template and running the following PCR programme: initial denaturing at 958C for 3 min, 30 cycles of 958C for 15 s, 558C for 30 s, 728C for 30 s and an extension cycle of 728C for 10 min. Semi-nested PCR products were gel-purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified heavy chain variable regions and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions were then covalently linked by a flexible (G4S)3 linker by SOE-PCR to assemble scFvs using the primer pairs Sfi5new/LINKR and LINKF/Sfi3hisR. The SOE-PCR products were gel-extracted, digested with SfiI and ligated to pComb3X. The ligated products were then electroporated into TG1 electrocompetent cells.
