Insertion of the MAVS and HCV NS5A/NS5B-specific cleavage sites (Fig. 1) into the lambda cI repressor has been described elsewhere [20, 24] . In this study, TRIF and CHV NS5A/NS5B-specific cleavage sites (Fig. 1) were inserted into the lambda cI repressor. Briefly, the nucleotide sequence for TRIF and CHV NS5A/NS5B-specific cleavage sites (Fig. 1 ) was chemically synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies). The constructs included two restriction sites, NsiI and HindIII, at the ends, which are present in the lambda cI repressor [39] . After digestion with NsiI and HindIII, the construct was ligated into pcI.HCVNS5A/NS5Bcro [20] , previously digested with NsiI and HindIII, to generate the pcI.TRIFcro and pcI.CHVNS5A/ NS5Bcro plasmids Sequence analysis of this plasmid confirmed the accuracy of the synthetic construct. E. coli JM109 cells containing plasmid pcI.MAVScro, pcI.TRIFcro, pcI.HCVNS5A/ NS5Bcro or pcI.CHVNS5A/NS5Bcro were then transformed with the plasmid expressing the corresponding protease. Transformed cells were grown overnight at 30uC in the presence of 0.2% maltose, 12.5 mg/ml tetracycline, and 20 mg/ml ampicillin; harvested by centrifugation; and resuspended to an optical density at 600 nm of 2.0/ml in 10 mM MgSO4. To induce expression of the protease, 20 ml of cells were incubated in 100 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 12.5 mg/ml tetracycline, 20 mg/ ml ampicillin, 0.2% maltose, 10 mM MgSO4, and 0.1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 1 h. The cell cultures were then infected with 10 5 plaque-forming units (PFU) of phage. After 3 h at 37uC, the titer of the resulting phage was determined by coplating the cultures with 200 ml of E. coli XL-1 Blue cells (adjusted to an optical density at 600 nm of 2.0/ml in 10 mM MgSO4) on LB plates using 3 ml of top agar containing 12.5 mg of tetracycline/ml, 0.2% maltose, and 0.1 mM IPTG. After incubation at 37uC for 6 h, the resulting phage plaques were counted in order to score growth. Western blots were performed as previously described [19] . Briefly, E. coli JM109 cells containing plasmid pcI.MAVScro or pcI.TRIFcro were transformed with the plasmid expressing the corresponding protease. Transformed cells were then grown overnight at 30uC in the presence of 0.2% maltose, 12.5 mg/ml tetracycline, and 20 mg/ml ampicillin; harvested by centrifugation; and resuspended to an optical density at 600 nm of 2.0/ml in 10 mM MgSO4. To induce expression of the protease, 200 ml of cells were incubated in 1 ml of LB medium containing 12.5 mg/ml tetracycline, 20 mg/ml ampicillin, 0.2% maltose, 10 mM MgSO4, and 0.1 mM IPTG for 3 h. The ODs of the cultures after 3 h (in the presence of IPTG) were measured to assure that equivalent amounts of total cell protein were blotted. No significant differences were observed when the ODs of the different cultures were compared, suggesting that the expression of the NS3/4A proteases did not affect the growth of the bacteria. Cultures were lysed in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, resolved in 12% gradient SDS polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline-0.1% Tween 20-10% nonfat dry milk. For immunochemical detection of the lambda repressor, membranes were subsequently incubated with rabbit serum containing polyclonal anti-cI antibodies (anti-cI sera; Invitrogen). Bound antibodies were visualized with peroxidaselinked anti-rabbit antybody HRP-linked IgG (Cell Signaling Technology) and the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific). The nucleotide sequence for CHV NS3/4A protease (Fig. 2 ) was chemically synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies) following the nucleotide sequence reported by Kapoor et al. [3] . The construct included two restriction sites, EcoRI and XhoI, at the ends. After digestion with EcoRI and XhoI, the construct was cloned into pBluescript SK-(Agilent Technologies) to generate a b-galactosidase-CHV NS3/4A protease fusion protein. Sequence analysis of this plasmid confirmed the accuracy of the synthetic construct. Control mutant constructs (red residues in Figs. 1 and 2) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quik-Change kit (Agilent Technologies) and following the manufacturer's instructions. Three HCV NS3/4A proteases used in this study, 1, 50, and 51, were obtained from HCV genomic RNA extracted from the plasma of three different HCV-infected patients. The nucleotide sequences and amplification procedures of these proteases have been published previously [18, 24] . The fourth HCV NS3/4A protease employed in this study was amplified from the HCV subgenomic replicon I389/NS3-3 [26] . Macrocyclic protease inhibitor 25a [28] was kindly provided by Merck, Sharp and Dohme. Donoprevir was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA).
