The specimens of this study were sputa collected at times of any respiratory infection. Thus the sample collection does not provide a direct link to lower respiratory disease, as specimens were also taken during upper respiratory infections. It also has to be mentioned here that we cannot rule out the fact that the specimens may have been contaminated with pharyngeal HRV. The sputum in the specimens, however, at least partly originated from bronchioles. Thus the results may refer to the abundance of HRV RNA in the lower respiratory tract. The number of HRV-positive specimens in real-time RT-PCR, but negative in RT-PCR for genetic typing was high (91/146). Furthermore reliable sequence was only received from 29/55 of the HRV sequencing RT-PCR positive specimens. Because of the small proportion of the genetically typed strains, there may exist a bias in the distribution of the typed strains vs. the real distribution. The high sensitivity of real-time methods partly explains negative typing results of specimens with high C t -values. The method used for genetic typing is not sensitive enough to enable typing of all real-time RT-PCR-positive HRV strains. The number of HRV genomes present may just be too low. These small numbers of genomes may also be remnants of a previous infection, not necessarily related to the current symptoms. Moreover, primer mismatch may explain negative results of the genetic typing method in cases when C t -values have been low. Possibly the amplification of the RT-PCR for genetic typing has been ineffective due to primer mismatch causing low amount of the PCR product. One factor explaining the results may also be cross-reaction of the presumably HRV-specific real-time RT-PCR with HEV strains. In this study we did not aim to evaluate the assays, but to present observations of their use. Even though only HEV-D strains were discovered in this study, other HEV strains are known to be present during respiratory infections. They may have high sequence homology with HRV in the 5'non-coding region where the primer and probe targets in real-time RT-PCR lie. The primers used in our genetic typing method for HRV do not recognize all species of HEV and even the semi-nested partial VP1 typing assay [19] failed to disclose the genetic type of the weaker strains. It is possible that some "HRV-positives" are actually HEV positives. It is also possible that some HRV strains are recognized by the presumably HEV-specific real-time RT-PCR. These are facts that are currently impossible to resolve even with methods of cell culture, as some serotypes of enteroviruses and HRV-C strains do not multiply in conventional laboratory cell lines.
