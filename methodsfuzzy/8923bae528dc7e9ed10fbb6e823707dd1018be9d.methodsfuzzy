The results of the deltaCt method were reported in Tables 2, 3 and 4 . GAPDH was the most stable gene for the three comparison groups. For the entire dataset, the results were similar to NormFinder and geNorm analysis, with GAPDH and PP2A as the top two ranked RGs, with a slight difference in the ranking (Table 4) . TUB was the least stable gene in three comparison groups, as demonstrated by other statistical algorithms. In this study, to determine the consistency of the ranks of candidate RGs produced by geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and the deltaCt method, the Pearson correlation coefficient was employed ( Table 5 ). The Pearson correlations achieved from the calculations were positive and significant for all methods, except BestKeeper. The most significant correlation of the rank of all RGs ranked by two methods was geNorm and deltaCt in A. deliciosa leaves inoculated with a high dose of bacterial inoculum (r = 0.958), followed by NormFinder vs. deltaCt in A. deliciosa leaves inoculated with a low dose of bacterial inoculum (r = 0.895) ( Table 5) . For the overall final ranking obtained by the four algorithms, the two top RGs for the total dataset were GAPDH and PP2A, while the least stable were GLO7A and TUB. Expression analysis of the target genes for reference gene validation. The expression of three genes encoding the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), induced during the systemic infection of kiwifruit leaves with PSA, were chosen to further validate the reliability of the selected RGs for the normalization of RT-qPCR data. In this study, we followed two normalization strategies to determine the expression of these target genes. The first used the best two RGs (GAPDH and PP2A) given by ranking from four methods (geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder and deltaCt), and the second used the least stable RGs (TUB and GLO7A). In A. deliciosa leaves inoculated with a high dose of bacterial inoculum, an up-regulation in APX mRNA expression was observed during the time course of the experiment with 2.4-and 4.5-fold changes after 1 and 13 dpi, respectively. Instead, when we used a low dose of bacterial inoculum, we observed an accumulation of the APX transcript after 4 dpi with a 3.7-fold-change and a gradual decrease from 7 to 13 dpi (Fig. 3A) A down-regulation in CAT mRNA expression during the first 4 dpi was observed, and subsequently, we registered a gradual up-regulation in CAT mRNA expression in A. deliciosa leaves inoculated with a low-and high-dose of bacterial inocula. The maximum level of the transcript was reached after 10 dpi, with a 2.2-and 5.7-fold change in infected leaves with high-and low-dose bacterial inocula, respectively (Fig. 3B) . Similarly, we observed in the accumulation of the SOD transcript, that the maximum average value after 10 dpi was a 3.6-and 1.6-fold change, with low and high bacterial inocula, respectively (Fig. 3C) . Our results confirm that the transcriptional levels of APX, CAT and SOD are subjected to complex regulation in PSA-infected kiwifruit leaves. This information is distorted when we normalize against the least stable genes, upon which the expression levels of APX, CAT and SOD were inaccurate and altered transcriptional profiles were displayed (Fig. 4 ).
