The dataset analyzed in this study was generated as part of a previous analysis in our laboratory (10) and is publicly available at the NCBI Small Read Archive with the accession number SRP013296. These reads are 100-nt single reads generated on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 using standard cDNA library generation protocols and directional RNAseq. Briefly, authentic FHV particles were amplified in Drosophila S2 cells grown in suspension, harvested 2 days after infection and then purified over a series of centrifugation steps consisting of one 30% sucrose cushion and two 10-40% sucrose gradients in the presence of 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.0. An additional 2-h nuclease digestion was performed with 20 U DNase I and 0.5 ug RNase A in between the two sucrose gradient spins to remove any contaminating non-encapsidated RNA or DNA. After the final sucrose gradient, RNA was extracted using standard phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitated and re-suspended in pure water. In all, 400 ng RNA was used for cDNA library generation using standard TruSeq adaptors and barcodes, polymerase chain reaction amplified for 12 cycles and then purified by agarose gel electrophoresis to yield inserts of 200 nt. The cDNA library was loaded onto a HiSeq v3 single read flowcell and sequenced for 100 nt of the insert and 7 nt of the index sequence on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Reads were processed using CASAVA 1.8.2. Before analysis, the raw reads were processed by removing the 3 0 adaptors (sequence = TGGAATTCTCG GGTGCCAAGG) using Cutadapt (22) with default parameters and then removing any reads containing any nucleotide with a PHRED score < 20 using the FASTX toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). Any read <50 nt was discarded, leaving 31 146 304 reads ranging from 50 to 100 nt in length. For the analysis using pseudo-reference libraries to detect RNA recombination, the last five nucleotides of each read were trimmed away and then any read containing <95 nt was discarded. This yielded a dataset containing 28 939 991 reads, all exactly 95 nt in length. These datasets were then aligned end-to-end to the FHV genome (NC_004144 and NC_004146) using Bowtie (version 0.12.9) with parameters -v 2 --best, and then to the Drosophila melanogaster genome (fb5_22) using parameters -v 3 --best. Any unaligned reads were analyzed for evidence of recombination as described in the main text.
