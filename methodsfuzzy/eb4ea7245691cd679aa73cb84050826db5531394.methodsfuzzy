The robot technology system produces H 2 O 2 as electrically charged particles of such a small size (approximately 10 mm in diameter) that they circulate freely in air as a dry aerosol or fumemaking disinfectant accessible to all surfaces (Sterinis, Gloster Sante Europe, France www. sterinis.com). The H 2 O 2 adheres to particles present in the atmosphere and on surfaces, and forms a dry film on these particles. The aerosol container (Sterusil) contains hydrogen peroxide 5%, phosphoric acid !50 ppm, silver cations !50 ppm, gum arabica !1 ppm and bi-osmotic water 95%. The system consists of a programmable robot that can be pre-programmed to the required concentration of H 2 O 2 dry aerosol depending on the exact volume of the enclosed room. Consumption of disinfectant is 6 mL/m 3 for full disinfection. The aerosol-producing robot was placed to get the most effective concentration of dry aerosol, i.e. approximately 2 m in front and to the sides of the robot. The whole disinfection process, including the number of cycles (diffusion time) and the contact time, was pre-set on the robot. One or more pre-set cycles of H 2 O 2 gas used varying diffusion times according to the volume of the room. Each cycle was followed by an increasing contact time of 30, 60 and 120 min after one, two and three cycles, respectively. Each cycle was immediately followed by the pre-set contact time, which was then immediately followed by the next cycle, etc. The test rooms (including garages for ambulances) were closed throughout the decontamination process, and no people were present. All ventilation openings in the rooms were taped over. The concentration of H 2 O 2 was 2-17.4 parts per million (ppm) in the rooms and 36-60 ppm in the garages during the diffusion time. The Norwegian Directory of Labour Inspection has set exposure limits of 1 ppm of H 2 O 2 for 8 h of exposure and less than 3 ppm for 15 min four times a day. The fume does not persist because of rapid decomposition. When the disinfection procedure was complete, the room or equipment could be used immediately. The rooms, equipment and ambulances were not cleaned prior to exposure to the disinfectant agent. No neutralization method was required after decontamination.
