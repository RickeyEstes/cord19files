A commercially available kit, the SensoLyte 490 HIV-1 Protease Assay Kit (AnaSpec, San Jose, CA, USA), was used to compare the findings with the proposed assay. The detection system of this kit was based on FRET spectrofluorometry using an FL-labeled peptide (DABSYL-Abu-Ser-Gln-Tyr-Pro-Ile-Val-Gln-EDANS) as the FRET substrate. The FL of 5-[(2-aminoethyl)amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (EDANS) in the substrate was quenched in advance by 4-N,N-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4 0 -sulfonic acid (DABSYL) in the same substrate, although the FL of EDANS at 490 nm (emission)/340 nm (excitation) was recovered by cleaving into two separated fragments of the FRET substrate by HIV-PR. This enzyme reaction with HIV-PR in the crude extract was performed according to the manufacture's instruction. The cell lysate (50 ll) containing the recombinant HIV-PR was mixed with 50 ll of the assay buffer and 100 ll of the FRET substrate. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37Â°C for 2 h, and then the FL of the product was detected with a spectrofluorometer at 490 nm (emission)/340 nm (excitation). Free EDANS was used as a standard material to determine the product. A commercial HIV-PR assay kit was employed to determine HIV-PR activity in the same lysate so as to evaluate the reliability of the proposed spectrofluorometric method. As shown in Fig. 4B , the amount of the enzymatic product measured by the proposed method was approximately 10 times larger than that measured by the commercial kit, and a good correlation (r 2 = 0.991) of each amount of the enzymatic products was obtained by both methods. Therefore, this proposed method possesses sufficient reliability to be used for the assay of HIV-PR activity.
