Virus. Poliovirus of strains la/S3 (type 1) and MEF-1 (type 2) was grown in suspended HeLa cells, labeled, and purified as described (Boeye, 1965; Vanden Berghe and Boeye, 1973) . Extraction of capsidpolypeptides. A suspension of poliovirus in 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) supplemented with 1% SDS and 1% mercaptoethanol was incubated for 1 hr at 60". After cooling, sucrose was added to a final concentration of 10% and the mixture was electrophoresed immediately. Gels and electrophoresis. All procedures were as described by Vrijsen and Boeye (1978) . The length of the gels was 9 cm and the potential was 25 V. Radioactivity profiles. Gels were cut into l-mm slices, and these were either counted after adding soluene and a toluene-based scintillation mixture or eluted for 24 hr at room temperature in 0.3 to 0.5 ml of 0.1% SDS. Eluate samples of 20 ~1 were counted in Bray's mixture. Normal counting time was 10 min, but this was increased to 200 min as needed. When required, eluate pools were concentrated by ultrafiltration in a Minicon B-15 (Amicon) apparatus. For each series of radioactive profiles, one gel loaded with cold la/S3 protein was Incorporation studies using enietine (modified from Rekosh, 1972) . HeLa cells were collected 3 hr after high-multiplicity infection and brought to a density of 4 X 10" cells/ml at 37" in Eagle's medium devoid of amino acids. r3H]Leucine was added 15 min later, and its incorporation was completely stopped after a short time (to be specified) by adding 200 pg/ml of emetine (Sigma) and a lOOO-fold excess of unlabeled leucine. After 6 hr of incubation, the cells were collected by centrifugation and frozen to -70". The supernatant was again centrifuged for 90 min at 40,000 rpm. The pellet, which contained the extracellular virus, was resuspended in phosphate buffer. To prepare cytoplasmic extracts, the thawed cells were resuspended for 15 min in RSB supplemented with excess leucine, disrupted in a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged to remove the nuclei. The extracellular virus and 120 pg of carrier virus were added to the cytoplasmic extract. The mixture was dialyzed against 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.5% SDS and layered onto a 15 to 30% sucrose gradient. The sucrose solutions contained 0.01 M phosphate (pH 7.2) and 0.5% SDS. The virus was collected as the 160 S peak after centrifugation for 75 min at 29,000 rpm. The "C-virus used for co-electrophoresis in these experiments was separately labeled with ['4C]leucine, purified as above, and added immediately before protein extraction.
