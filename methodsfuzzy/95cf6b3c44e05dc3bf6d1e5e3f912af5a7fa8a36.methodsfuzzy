Generation of modified mRNA and LNP-The mRNA was synthesized in vitro using DNA-dependent T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription where UTP was substituted with N1-methylpseudoUTP. A linearized DNA template was used, which incorporates 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) and includes a poly-A tail (5′-UTR: GGGAAAUAAGAGAGAAAAGAAGAGUAAGAAGAAAUAUAAGAGCCACC; and 3′-UTR: GCUGGAGC CUCGGUGGCCUAGCUUCUUGCCCCUUGGGCCUCCCCCCAGCCCCUCCUCCCCU UCCUGCACCCGUACCCCCGUGGUCUUU GAAUAAAGUCUGAGUGGGCGGC). The final mRNA utilized a cap 1 structure modification to increase mRNA translation efficiency. Encoded signal sequences were from POWV prM (SGVDWTWTFLVMALMT) or JEV prM (MWLVSLAIVTACAGA) and the prM and E genes were derived from POWV Spooner. LNP formulations were prepared by ethanol drop nanoprecipitation on a microfluidic mixer (Precision Nanosystems). Briefly, lipids were dissolved in ethanol at molar ratios of 50:10:38.5:1.5 (ionizable lipid: structural lipid: sterol: PEG-lipid) and mixed with mRNA in 50 mM citrate buffer, pH 4.0, at a ratio of 3:1 (aqueous:ethanol). Formulations were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing sucrose (8%) in dialysis cassettes for at least 18 h. Formulations were concentrated using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters (EMD Millipore) and sterile filtered through 0.22-mm filters. All formulations were tested for particle size, RNA encapsulation, and endotoxin and were between 80 to 100 nm in size, with greater than 90% encapsulation and < 10 EU/ml of endotoxin. Viruses-POWV lineage I strain LB (Mandl et al., 1993) was isolated originally from a human brain sample. POWV lineage II (DTV) strain Spooner was isolated originally from adult deer ticks (Ebel et al., 1999) . LGTV strain E5 was derived from strain TP21 (Campbell and Pletnev, 2000) . POWV LB, POWV Spooner, and LGTV were obtained from World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (R. Tesh and S. Weaver, University of Texas Medical Branch). POWV strains MA5/12-#40 and FA5/12-#40 were isolated from ticks collected in Wisconsin as described (Brackney et al., 2008) . Virus was isolated by inoculating BHK-21 cells with 100 μl of the homogenate of POWV RNA positive ticks and harvesting virus supernatant when CPE was approximately 50%. Virus stocks were propagated on Vero cells and used at passage 3 (POWV LB and POWV Spooner) or passage 4 (LGTV). Viral titer was determined by focus-forming assay (FFA) on Vero cells as described previously (Brien et al., 2013) with the following modifications: FFA infections were fixed after 72 (POWV LB and POWV Spooner) or 48 (LGTV) h and stained with ZV-13, a flavivirus cross-reactive mouse mAb (Zhao et al., 2016) . Plasmids-The plasmid encoding a sub-genomic replicon of the WNV lineage II strain 956 that expresses GFP (WNVrepG/Z) has been reported (Ansarah-Sobrinho et al., 2008; Pierson et al., 2006) . Plasmids that express the C-prM-E structural genes of POWV strain P0375 (GenBank accession number KU886216), TBEV strain Neudoerfl (GenBank accession number U27495), LGTV strain TP21 (GenBank accession number NC_003690), and GGYV strain Macquarie Island (GenBank: DQ235145) were cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). All plasmid propagation and cloning procedures were performed using Stbl2 bacteria grown at 30 C (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Reporter virus particles-Reporter virus particles (RVPs) were produced by the genetic complementation of a DNA-launched, sub-genomic replicon with a C-prM-E expression plasmid, as described previously (Ansarah-Sobrinho et al., 2008; Pierson et al., 2006) . Briefly, pre-plated HEK293T cells were co-transfected with WNVrepG/Z, a WNV replicon expressing a GFP reporter gene, and the C-prM-E expression plasmids described above using FugeneHD (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were incubated at 37 C, and supernatant was harvested at 48 h post-transfection, filtered using a 0.22 μm syringe filter, and stored at 80 C. The infectious titer of RVPs was assayed using Raji-DC-SIGNR cells, as described previously (Ansarah-Sobrinho et al., 2008; Pierson et al., 2006) . Neutralization assays-(a) RVP neutralization assays were performed as described (Mukherjee et al., 2014) . Briefly, RVP stocks were diluted and incubated with serial dilutions of serum for 1 h at 37 C prior to the addition of Raji-DCSIGNR cells. Infections were carried out at 37 C for 48 h, and infectivity was scored as the percentage of GFPexpressing cells determined by flow cytometry. (b) Focus-reduction neutralization test (FRNT) experiments were performed as described for other flaviviruses (Richner et al., 2017a) . Briefly, serial dilutions of serum were incubated with 200 FFU of POWV Spooner for 1 h at 37 C. Serum/virus mixtures were added to Vero cell monolayers and incubated for 1 h at 37 C prior to the addition of 1% (w/v) methycellulose in MEM. FRNT experiments proceeded as described for FFA experiments above. For both RVP neutralization assays and FRNT, antibody-dose response curves were analyzed using non-linear regression analysis (with a variable slope) (GraphPad Software). Data are expressed as the serum dilution required to reduce infection by half (EC 50 ) or, where indicated, by 90% (EC90). To obtain EC 50 values when a resistant fraction was present, the bottom of the curve was constrained to zero. Mouse experiments-Immunizations with the LNP mRNA vaccines were administered via intramuscular injection in a 50 μL volume. For passive transfer studies, serum was diluted in PBS and administered to mice via intraperitoneal injection in a 100 μL total volume; mice received a dose of 3 μL or 10 μL of serum from POWV sig -vaccinated mice or 10 mL of serum from placebo-treated mice. Viral infections with POWV or LGTV were performed via subcutaneous inoculation in the footpad with 10 2 FFU of virus. For LGTV and POWV Spooner challenge, 0.5 mg of anti-Ifnar1 blocking mAb MAR1-5A3 (Sheehan et al., 2006) was administered one day prior to infection via intra-peritoneal injection. Animals were monitored for mortality, weight loss, and clinical score. To evaluate clinical disease following POWV infection, mice were assigned to one of the following categories each day: (A) no disease, (B) ruffled fur, (C) ruffled fur with hunched posture, (D) lethargy or decreased scurrying activity, (E) sick with slow to no movement, or (F) moribund or dead; moribund mice were euthanized. To evaluate clinical disease following LGTV challenge, cages were blinded and mice were assigned to one of the following categories each day: (A) no disease, (B) partial hindlimb paralysis, (C) complete paralysis of one hindlimb, (D) complete paralysis of both hindlimbs, or (E) moribund or dead; moribund mice were euthanized. Measurement of viral burden-On indicated days post-infection, mice were sacrificed and organs were collected following extensive perfusion with PBS. Organs were weighed and homogenized using a MagNA Lyser (Roche). Viral RNA from homogenized organs or serum was isolated using the MagMAX Viral RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher) and measured by TaqMan one-step quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) on an ABI 7500 Fast Instrument. Viral RNA levels are expressed on a log10 scale as viral RNA equivalents per gram or milliliter after comparison with a standard curve produced using serial 10-fold dilutions of viral RNA from known quantities of infectious virus in order to estimate viral burden. POWV Spooner primers, which have been described (Platt et al., 2018) , were 5′-GCAGCACCATAGG TAGAATGT-3′, 5′-CCACCCACTGAACCAAAGT-3′, and probe 5′-/56-FAM/TCTCAGTGG/Zen/ TTGGAGAACACGCAT/3IABkFQ-3′. POWV LB primers were 5′-GGCTGCAAATGAGACCAATTC-3′, 5′-CAGCGACACATCTCCATAGTC-3′, and probe 5ʹ-/56-FAM/TGGCATCCG/Zen/AGAAAGTGATCCTGC/3IABkFQ/−3′. LGTV primers were 5′-GGAACTAGGCCTTGCAGAAT-3′, 5′-TGTT CTCCATTGTCGGGTTAG-3′, and probe 5′-/56-FAM/TGAGGTTAA/Zen/CGTGGCCATGCTCAT/3IABkF-3′.
