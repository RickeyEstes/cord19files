Potentially relevant articles were identified through a search of PubMed from 1965 to the present using the search terms rhinovirus and seasonality. For inclusion in the review, a study had to have observed the occurrence of rhinovirus infection in a defined population for >2 years. A total of 1998 papers were screened, most of them of a virologic nature and not useful in determining seasonal variations in rhinovirus frequency. In addition, a reanalysis was carried out on data on the incidence of illness from the Tecumseh Study of Respiratory Illnessfl ~, 22 The Tecumseh study was conducted over an 11-year period. The collection of data started in late 1965 and ended in 1981, with a hiatus from 1971 through 1976. Although there have been other longitudinal investigations of rhinovirus infection, the Tecumseh study was unique in several respects. First, it observed the occurrence of respiratory illnesses in a defined 10% sample of a single American community. Second, it identified all illnesses prospectively on a weekly basis, mainly by telephone, so that the reporting can be considered essentially complete and representative. Third, it identified causative agents by collecting nasal and throat swabs from patients reporting a respiratory illness within 2 days of onset. It supplemented these results by monitoring antibody titers in blood specimens collected on a biannual schedule. Details of the study methods have been reported elsewhere. 21 The occurrence per 1000 respiratory infections was reported weekly for >4 years. Also reported was the proportion of total isolates represented by particular isolates during specified times over the study period. 21 These proportions were based on the standard isolation techniques available at the time. As a result, they would have underestimated the proportion of respiratory infections caused by rhinoviruses. The extent to which ordinary virus isolation will underestimate total rhinovirus identification, using PCR plus isolation as a standard, has ranged from 1.3 to 3.119,23; that is, isolation frequencies would need to be multiplied by this factor to produce true rates of identification. Based on data col-lected later in the Tecumseh study, it was estimated that 34% of all illnesses in a year are attributable to rhinoviruses, but that without the benefit of PCR, 23% of these illnesses would have been unknown at that time. 22'24 If, conservatively, half of these illnesses were attributed to rhinovirus, the overall percentage of illnesses that were of rhinoviral etiology was 45.5%. This value was then used to adjust the observed seasonal proportions for the >5 years of observation, summarized by month, to a single mean frequency ( Figure 1 ).
