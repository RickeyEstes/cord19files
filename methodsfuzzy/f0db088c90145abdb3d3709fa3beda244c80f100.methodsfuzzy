Virus and cells. The apathogenic molecular clone of IBV, Beau-R, has been described previously (63) . The pathogenic isolate M41-CK (GenBank accession number MK728875.1) has been described previously (64) . The two strains have an average nucleotide identity of 93% (assessed in a 1-kb window with a step size of 200 nt). Most of the variation between them occurs as single nucleotide polymorphisms; however, a single large (185-nt) region is present in the 3= untranslated region (UTR) of Beau-R but is absent from the genome of M41-CK. The Beau-R sequence is identical to the Beau-R sequence (GenBank accession number AJ311317.1), except for two point mutations, one in nsp16 (C19666U; Ser to Leu) and one in N (A27087G, synonymous). Primary chick kidney (CK) cells were produced from 2-to 3 week-old specificpathogen-free (SPF) Rhode Island Red chickens (65) . The chickens were housed in the Home Officelicensed animal facilities of The Pirbright Institute. All animal experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board and performed in accordance with the UK Home Office guidelines and under license for experiments involving regulated procedures on animals protected under the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. CK cells (0.8 ϫ 10 6 cells/ml) were plated in 10-cm dishes and upon reaching 100% confluence (at 2 days postseeding) were washed once with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and infected with 9.6 ϫ 10 6 PFU of Beau-R or M41-CK (MOI ϭ ϳ3). After 1 h of incubation at 37°C in 5% CO 2 , the inoculum was removed and replaced with 10 ml fresh 1ϫ BES [1ϫ minimal essential Eagle's medium (MEM), 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 20 mM N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (BES), 0.21% sodium bicarbonate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 250 U/ml nystatin, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 U/ml streptomycin]. Cells were harvested at 24 h postinfection when clear regions of cytopathic effect (CPE) were visible. Drug treatment, cell harvesting and lysis. Cycloheximide (CHX; Sigma-Aldrich) was added directly to the growth medium (to 100 g/ml), and the cells were incubated for 2 min at 37°C before rinsing with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS containing CHX (100 g/ml). Subsequently, the dishes were incubated on ice and 400 l of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 100 g/ml cycloheximide, 25 U/ml Turbo DNase [Life Technologies]) was dripped onto the cells. The cells were scraped extensively to ensure lysis, collected, and triturated with a 26-gauge needle 10 times. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 ϫ g at 4°C, and the supernatants were recovered and stored at Ϫ80°C. Ribosomal profiling and RNASeq. Cell lysates were subjected to RiboSeq and RNASeq. The methodologies employed were based on the original protocols of Ingolia and colleagues (23, 66) , except that rRNA contamination was removed using a commercial RiboZero Gold magnetic kit (Illumina) and library amplicons were constructed using a small RNA cloning strategy (67) adapted to the Illumina small RNA library preparation kit (v2) to allow multiplexing. The methods used were as described by Chung et al. (68) , except that the 5= and 3= adaptors included seven consecutive randomized bases at the 3= and 5= ends, respectively. This facilitated removal of reads duplicated during PCR amplification of cDNA libraries (69) and reduced ligation bias. The amplicon libraries were deep sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq platform (Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge). Computational analysis of RiboSeq and RNASeq data. Adaptor sequences were trimmed using a FASTX-Toolkit (hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit), and reads shorter than 25 nt following adaptor trimming were discarded. Mapping was performed using the Bowtie (v1) program (70) with parameters -v 2 -best (i.e., maximum 2 mismatches, report best match). Adaptor-trimmed, deduplicated reads were mapped sequentially to host (Gallus gallus) rRNA, IBV Beau-R (GenBank accession number NC_001451.1) or IBV M41-CK (GenBank accession number DQ834384.1) gRNA, Ensembl host noncoding RNA (ncRNA), NCBI RefSeq host mRNA, and the host genome. The order of mapping was tested to check that virus-derived reads were not lost accidentally due to mismapping to host RNA, or vice versa. When performing analyses of viral and host gene expression, only 28-and 29-nt RiboSeq reads (corresponding to RPFs mapping primarily in phase 0) and only Ն40-nt RNASeq reads were used. A 12-nt offset was applied to the 5= mapping positions of RPFs, to approximate the P-site position of the ribosome (see Fig.  S4 in the supplemental material and reference 25). To normalize for different library sizes, reads per million mapped reads (RPM) values were calculated using the sum of total virus RNA plus total host RefSeq mRNA (positive-sense reads only) as the denominator. Host mRNA RiboSeq and RNASeq phasing distributions were derived from reads mapping internally to the coding regions of ORFs; specifically, the 5= end of the read had to map between the first nucleotide of the initiation codon and 30 nt 5= of the last nucleotide of the termination codon, thus, in general, excluding RPFs of initiating or terminating ribosomes. Histograms of the 5= end positions of the host mRNA reads relative to the initiation and termination codons (Fig. S4 to S7) were derived from reads mapping to RefSeq mRNAs with annotated CDSs at least 450 nt in length and annotated 5= and 3= UTRs at least 60 nt in length. When calculating the translation efficiencies of viral genes, only in-phase (i.e., phase 0 with respect to the ORF in question) RiboSeq reads were counted. For host differential expression analyses, nonribosomal, nonviral reads in each library were mapped to the Gallus gallus (v5.0) assembly (December 2015) using the STAR aligner (71) , with gene annotations being from Ensembl release 94 (72) . A maximum of two mismatches were allowed when mapping. Read counts per gene (protein-coding genes only) were obtained using the HTSeq framework (73), with a requirement that reads map entirely within the forward strand coding sequence (htseq-count parameters, -m intersection-strict -s yes -t CDS). For each comparison of experimental groups, only genes with an average of at least 50 mapped reads were included in the differential expression analyses. GO term enrichment analysis was carried out using the topGO package in R (74) , and Fisher's exact test was used to assess the enrichment of individual GO terms in specific gene lists. Protein-protein interaction networks were constructed using the Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database (44) . Data availability. Sequencing data have been deposited in ArrayExpress (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ arrayexpress) under the accession number E-MTAB-7849.
