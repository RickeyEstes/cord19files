Increases in population, habitat encroachment, international travel, and the globalization of world trade have all contributed to the emergence of new pathogens or reemergence of known pathogens of human health significance (Gilbride et al., 2006) . There are many techniques for isolating and detecting pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater, ranging from simple culture-based techniques to next generation sequencing (NGS). Some of these are standard methods and their use may be mandated in different countries for regulatory compliance. It is beyond the scope of this review to discuss these techniques in any detail, but there are many useful review papers describing or evaluating molecular techniques (Gilbride et al., 2006; Monis, Giglio, Keegan, & Andrew Thompson, 2005; Ramirez-Castillo et al., 2015; Yergeau et al., 2016) and research reports are also a good source of information for both conventional and molecular detection protocols for pathogens or surrogates in wastewater (Francy et al., 2011; Keegan et al., 2010; Monis et al., 2015) . All techniques have advantages and limitations and a list of some traditional and modern techniques is shown in Table 3 . Emerging techniques include NGS, which has been used to detect pathogenic bacteria in wastewater (Cai & Zhang, 2013; Ye & Zhang, 2011; Yergeau et al., 2016) . Next generation 454 pyrosequencing has also been used successfully to characterize microbial communities from different wastewater samples (Ye & Zhang, 2013) . Caution needs to be used when interpreting NGS data, particularly when identification is based on the sequencing of relatively small amplicons, which makes misidentification possible, particularly for closely related species. The technique is also very sensitive and a thorough understanding of the level of background contamination from the laboratory environment or between samples is required to determine if a result is the detection of a rare taxon or an artifact.
