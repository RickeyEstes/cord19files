Details of the study sites (6, 7) , specimen collection, and RT-PCR detection of MERS RNA are detailed in Supporting Information. Representative swab specimens with high MERS-CoV viral load [low threshold cycle (CT) values] were selected for full-length virus genome sequencing, and additional specimens were selected for targeted sequencing of the ORF3 and ORF4b regions (Supporting Information). Methods used for virus isolation and for the assembly and modification of a full-length BAC cDNA clone to rescue wild-type and mutant recombinant MERS-CoV lacking ORF4b are described in Supporting Information. Phylogenetic Analysis and Phenotypic Comparison of MERS-CoV Isolates. The phylogenetic analysis shown in Fig. 1 was done using the maximum-likelihood method (PhyML) (24) . Other phylogenetic methods are detailed in Supporting Information. Dromedary virus BF785 and Nig1657 viruses isolated as part of this study were chosen for comparison with the prototype human MERS-CoV strain EMC (clade A) provided by R. A. M. Fouchier (Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) and a dromedary camel virus, dromedary/Al-Hasa-KFU-HKU13/2013 (AH13) (clade B), isolated in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (25) . Viruses were isolated and grown in Vero cells, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C until used. The passage history of these viruses is shown in Dataset S1. Antigenic comparison also included dromedary/Egypt NRCE-HKU-270 (15) . Phenotypic comparison of viruses in Calu-3 cells and ex vivo cultures of human lung and bronchus were carried out as described in Supporting Information. The procedure for transducing mice with an adenovirus vector expressing human DPP4 has been previously described (14) and is detailed in Supporting Information. Biosafety and Ethics. Experiments with live MERS-CoV were carried out in biosafety level 3 biocontainment facilities at the University of Hong Kong and the University of Iowa. Studies on the ex vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung were approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (UW-13-104). All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee at the University of Iowa. Statistical Analysis. The statistical analyses are indicated in figure legends and are detailed in Supporting Information. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.
