paralysis, meningitis and encephalitis. Each condition has been associated with different HPeV types. 2 Respiratory symptoms, have been frequently reported in children with HPeV infections. Two recent studies investigating the involvement of HPeV in respiratory diseases detected HPeV1, HPeV3, and less frequently HPeV 4, 5 and 6 in children below five years old. However, these studies report low frequency of detection and high rate of co-infection with other respiratory viruses, hence preventing the elucidation of the role of these viruses in respiratory infections. 1, 4 Blood culture, considered the gold standard for neonatal infection diagnosis, has poor sensitivity (8-73%) and will not detect all pathogens and very little is known about non-bacterial pathogens as a cause of late onset infection. Davis et al. (2015) described the detection of HPeV 1 in a group of preterm infants in neonatal intensive care. In the total group, 13% of infants had HPeV type 1 infection confirmed by PCR method. 5 In recent years, viral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has been reported as a frequent microbial etiology in severe CAP. This is in part due to new diagnostic techniques that allow detecting old and new viruses, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), one of these new viral diseases, which is caused by an RNA betacoronoravirus. 4 Neonates and young children are more vulnerable to infections than older children or adults. In this context, HPeV is now recognized as an important agent for infectious diseases and currently has 16 identified genotypes. Each genotype is related to various clinical patterns and by molecular methods HPeV 1 and 3 are the most frequent types involved in many severe infectious. 2 This study shows a case of sepsis with pulmonary focus associated to HPeV infection and should serve as a warning to the introduction of this investigation in the routine care of patients with severe respiratory infection, meningitis, gastroenteritis, or neonatal sepsis, promoting epidemiological and longitudinal analyses seeking to understand the dynamics of this virus circulation and its impact on children's health. 


Section:fig. 2 -phylogenetic analysis of hpev constructed by maximum-likehood method. partial 5 utr sequences were compared. reference strains, published in genbank, were included for comparison. strain of this study is shown as circle symbol. branches to the ev-a node have been truncated, as indicated by dotted lines. only bootstrap values >75 are shown (1000 replicates).
