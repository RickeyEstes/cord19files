Peptides synthesis. The natural substrate peptide S12 was designed based on the N-terminal self-cleavage site of SARS 3C-like proteinase, with the sequence of: Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Phe-CONH 2 . Other substrates were designed by truncating the N-and C-terminals, or mutation of S12. All the designed substrate peptides were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis using standard 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl/tert-butyl strategy. Cleavage of the peptide from Rink resin and removal of all sidechain-protecting groups were achieved in trifluoroacetic acid solution. The crude peptide was purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC, Elite P200II, Dalian, China) on a Zorbax C18 semi-preparative column (9.4 by 250 mm, Agilent) with gradients of water/acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide homogeneity and identity were analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy, respectively. Peptide cleavage. The reaction activities of the designed substrate peptides were determined using HPLC-based peptide cleavage assay. The C-terminal His-tagged SARS 3C-like proteinase was expressed and purified as previously described [10] , which was shown to have comparable enzyme activities with the non-His-tagged protein [11] . Cleavage assay solution was incubated at room temperature, which contains 0.2-0.4 mM substrate peptide, 5.41, 7.41 or 27.05 lM enzyme, and 57 lM DTT in 40 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3. Aliquots of reactions were removed every 10 or 60 min within 1-7 h, stopped by the addition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid aqueous solution, and analyzed by HPLC (LabPrep System, Gilson) on a Zorbax C18 analytic column (4.6 by 250 mm, Agilent). Cleavage products were resolved using a 15-min, 10-60% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, as described previously [10] . k cat /K m was determined by plotting substrate peak area using the equation below: where PA is the peak area of the substrate peptide, c E is the total concentration of His-tagged 3C-like proteinase, and C is an experimental constant and averaged for two independent measurements.
