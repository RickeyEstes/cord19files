This is a descriptive longitudinal observational study using retrospective data. A convenience sampling of patients ranging from 0 to 18 years of age, admitted to the PICU with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), defined as fever, cough, and dyspnea, requiring hospitalization, during the 2009 pandemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, according to the Brazilian Protocol of Clinical Management and Epidemiological Surveillance of Influenza 13 was utilized. SARI is the term most frequently used in the literature to describe severe cases, with a slightly different definition by the World Health Organization (WHO), as "an acute respiratory illness with a history of fever or measured fever of ≥38 • C and cough, with onset within the past 10 days, requiring hospitalization". 14 In the present study, the term SARI will be used as synonymous of SARS for simplicity. During this period, samples of respiratory secretions (nasopharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates or tracheal aspirates) of hospitalized patients with SARI were sent to three reference centers for influenza virus in Brazil. In the present study, we included 71 respiratory samples from patients who were admitted to the PICUs of six private hospitals and five public hospitals, from June 1 to November 30, 2009. These samples were tested for H1N1 virus in the respiratory virus laboratory of the reference center Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro (Fiocruz/RJ), using the Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) kit for H1N1 virus provided by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These samples, which had been stored at −70 • C, were retrieved for further testing. Sixty-three samples were found to be viable and were retested for the presence of other infectious agents using one of the following three techniques, depending on availability at the Fiocruz laboratory: RT-PCR for non-influenza respiratory viruses from a CDC-based kit, RespiFinder (RespiFinder 22 kit; Pathofinder B.V., The Netherlands), or the Fast-track (FTDRP 21 plus multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay; Fast-track Diagnostics Ltd, Sliema, Malta). Seven respiratory viruses were screened by using RT-PCR for non-influenza respiratory viruses from a CDC-based kit; 17 respiratory viruses were screened by using the RespiFinder and 20 respiratory viruses and five bacteria were screened by using the Fast-track ( (Table 1 ). Eight samples were tested only with the RT-PCR kit for H1N1 virus during the epidemic, while 63 samples (89%) were retested later at least with two methods, including the Respifinder and/or the Fast track in 61 samples (86%) ( Table 2) . In order to evaluate the presence of H1N1, we considered a positive result from any of the four tests in the 71 samples. For the assessment of viral codetection, we considered the 63 samples which were retested by at least one of the three methods, other than the RT-PCR kit for H1N1 virus. We used the term codetection and not coinfection because it is difficult to attribute a causal relationship between the detected agents and the clinical picture of the patient. 13 Demographic and clinical data were extracted from a specific data collection form for patients admitted to the PICU with SARI during the epidemic. Continuous variables were described as median and interquartile range and categorical variables were described as proportions. To compare H1N1-positive versus H1N1-negative groups and viral mono-dectection and codetection groups we used age-adjusted logistic regressions for categorical variables and non-parametric ANCOVA for continuous variables. In case of categories with zero occurrences, we used the Mantel-Haenszel test to adjust for age.
