Cells and virus. Vero E6 cells were routinely subcultured in 75-cm 3 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 0.2 mM L L -glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 lg/ml streptomycin, and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), and maintained at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . For use in the experiments, the cells were split once they reached 90% confluence and seeded onto 6-well or 24-well tissue culture plate inserts. The culture medium was changed to 2% FBS containing DMEM prior to virus infection. In this study, we used SARS-CoV [9] , which was isolated as Frankfurt 1 [10] and kindly provided by Dr. J. Ziebuhr. The seed virus was passaged at least seven times, including one passage in our laboratory. Infection was usually performed with a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5. The cells were stained with 0.05% crystal violet after fixing with 10% formaldehyde. Anti-SARS-CoV antibodies. Two peptides, RYRIGNYKLNTD (GenBank Accession No. AAP13571; residues 197-208) and RRVRGGDGKMKE (GenBank Accession No. AAP13814; residues 93-194), corresponding to fragments of the amino acid sequences of membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV, respectively, were synthesized (Sigma Genosys, Ishikari, Japan). Rabbits were injected with the mixture of peptides (New Drug Development Research Center, Iwamizawa, Japan), and the polyclonal rabbit antisera were used for Western blotting analysis. Western blotting. After viral infection at an m.o.i. of 5, whole-cell extracts were electrophoresed in 10% and 10-20% gradient polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto PVDF membrane sheets (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). In this study, we applied two sets of samples to polyacrylamide gels, and the membranes were divided into two sheets after blotting. The following antibodies, obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA), were used in this study at a dilution of 1:1000: rabbit anti-phospho p38 MAPK (Thr180/ Tyr182), rabbit anti-p38, rabbit anti-phospho MAPKAPK-2 (Thr334), anti-MAPKAPK-2, rabbit anti-phospho HSP-27 (Ser82), mouse anti-HSP-27, mouse anti-phospho CREB (Ser133), rabbit anti-CREB, anti-phospho eIF4E (Ser209), and anti-rabbit eIF4E. Rabbit anti-actin (H-196) (diluted 1:200) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). After 15-h incubation, the membranes were washed with 0.1% TBS-Tween and specific proteins were detected with a ProtoBlot II AP system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), as described previously [11] . DNA fragmentation. A MEBCYTO Apoptosis ladder detection kit (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan) was used for detection of DNA fragmentation. After viral infection, cells were lysed with lysis buffer. The cellular DNA was precipitated with ethanol, dried, and resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) containing 100 lg/ml RNase A. The DNA solutions were incubated for 60 min at 37°C. The DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and then stained with ethidium bromide.
