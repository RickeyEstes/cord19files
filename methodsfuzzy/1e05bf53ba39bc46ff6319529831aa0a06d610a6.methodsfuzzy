Five days of rNHF therapy is more effective in reducing symptom severity and duration of the common cold than five days of 'sham' rhinothermy. study design and participants This is a randomised, single-blind, parallel-group trial that will compare five days of rNHF therapy (100% humidified air at 35 L/min and 41°C for two hours daily) with 'sham' rhinothermy therapy (100% humidified air at 10 L/min and 31°C for 10 minutes daily) in the treatment of the common cold. We plan to recruit 170 participants within 48 hours of the onset of specific symptoms of the common cold. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to receive one of the two possible treatment arms and will receive this treatment for the first five days of the study. Study visits will occur on day one and day five with a follow-up phone call on day 14. The patient-reported outcome measure will be the MJS. 18 19 data collection All study data will be collected and recorded using the electronic data capture tool REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). 20 The MJS on day one will be collected by the investigator as part of the screening visit. After this, participants will complete a daily symptom diary, including a daily MJS, remotely, and will enter this data directly into either an electronic case report form (eCRF) on REDCap, or on paper. Inclusion criteria ► Aged 18-75 years. ► In the investigator's opinion, the participant is able and willing to comply with all trial requirements. ► Onset of symptoms within the last 48 hours at the time of consent. ► MJS of ≥7. Exclusion criteria ► Immunocompromised condition: -Conditions causing immunosuppression, for example, HIV/AIDS and active cancer. -Currently prescribed systemic steroids or other immunosuppressant medication. ► Nasal conditions, such as deviated septum and chronic rhinitis, which the investigator considers could impair nasal breathing. ► Current use of or requirement for oral antibiotics for respiratory tract infection and pneumonia, or infective exacerbation of underlying respiratory condition. ► Current use of or requirement for parenteral antibiotics. ► Daily intranasal or inhaled steroids will be allowed if part of the participant's regular therapy. If not taken prior to enrolment, they should be withheld for the duration of the study. ► Have an implantable medical device. ► Have a notifiable disease. ► Have existing travel plans that require them to leave the greater Wellington region during the first five days of the study, the period during which the participant will be using the rhinothermy device. ► A current diagnosis of asthma, COPD or other significant respiratory conditions. (Participants who have not had asthma symptoms nor any requirement for asthma medication within the last 12 months, will be eligible for inclusion in the study.) ► A positive GeneXpert point-of-care test for influenza A or B. ► The investigator believes that the participant or their caregiver will be unable to safely use rNHF without medical supervision. ► Have any other condition that, at the investigator's discretion, is believed may present a safety risk, or impact the feasibility of the study or the study results.
