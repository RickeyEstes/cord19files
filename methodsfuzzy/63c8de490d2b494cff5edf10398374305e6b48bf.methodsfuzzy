The results from these tests on the 67 clinical samples are summarized in Table 2 . Based on data from Fig. 2 , the readout for ) 10 9 copies/mL, (--) 10 6 copies/mL, ( ) 10 5 copies/mL, (--) 10 4 copies/mL, ( ) 10 3 copies/mL, and ( ) negative. However, 12, 7 and 18 RT-PCR-positive specimens were negative by the shell vial, cell culture and ELISA methods for influenza A and B viruses, respectively. Twelve and nine of the 52 samples positive by the RT-PCR technique were negative by QCM and NP-QCM methods. As shown in Table 3 , the respective sensitivities of the tests for the detection of influenza A and B viruses by the shell vial, standard cell culture, ELISA, Directigen Flu A test, QCM and NP-QCM tests were 76 and 80, 81 and 100, 68 and 60, 35 (for influenza A only) and 76 and 80 and 81 and 87% for influenza B viruses (Table 3 ). The specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the detection of each virus are shown in Table 3 . The highest number of false-negative results (24) was obtained with the Directigen Flu A test.
