A standard method for estimating numbers of species is to extrapolate the cumulative species discovery curve (Bebber et al. 2007) . We gathered data for this curve by systematically searching the primary literature for first reports of human infection with each of the currently recognized virus species, using species as defined by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV; http://www.ictvonline.org/). We note that the set of viruses we are interested in-those that can infect humans-is a small subset of the total (over 1500 species according to ICTV ) and, as is discussed below, not a closed set because many of these viruses can also infect other hosts . We regard this as analogous to constructing species discovery curves for any subdivision of geographical range or habitat. As we demonstrate below, this approach yields an excellent description of the discovery curve. We used piecewise linear regression to test for changes in the slope of the discovery curve. The results suggested upswings in 1930 (95% CI, 1929 -1933 ) and 1954 (1953 -1956 . We therefore restricted detailed analysis to the period 1954-2006. We modelled discovery since 1954 assuming a total number of species available to be discovered (the species pool) of N virus species, each discovered in any given year with probability p. The model was fitted to the data and assessed using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based Bayesian inference, generating distributions and credible intervals for the parameters. The model defines the expected number of discovered viruses in year t as l t ðN; pÞ Z Npð1K pÞ tK1 ; ð2:1Þ where year tZ1 corresponds to 1954. The binomial distribution B(N, p) can be accurately approximated by a Poisson distribution with parameter Np for the range of values of N and p of interest. We considered fitting a distribution for values of p; however, provided individual p-values are low there is minimal improvement in model fit. Thus, for a set of model parameters, the likelihood of observing data, XZ{x i }, the number of viruses discovered for years 1 to k, is given by Parameter distributions for N and p were calculated using MCMC simulation using a standard Metropolis algorithm with flat prior information. It was necessary to compute a correlation matrix to define a joint proposal since N and p are closely correlated. We monitored convergence using two chains. Once they had converged, we had a burn in period of 10 5 samples. We compared the model with the observed data by calculating the mean, trend in the mean and variance for the number of virus species discovered per year (based on five million simulations using best-fit parameter values). The model was extrapolated to year 2020 by calculating the expected number of viruses discovered using the best-fit model. The 95% posterior prediction intervals were calculated using two million model simulations taking into account parameter uncertainty (as given by data from 1954 to 2006) and natural model simulation stochasticity. As a validation exercise, the model was also fitted to the curve for accumulated virus families from 1954 using the same methods, except that the Poisson approximation no longer holds, so a binomial distribution was used. A family (based on current ICTV classifications) was added to the total when the first post-1954 species was allocated to that family. We tested the assumption that species can be randomly assigned to families (weighted by the size of the families) by noting the number of years in which 0, 1, 2, etc. virus families were discovered. This was done one million times to obtain a distribution for comparison with the observed values.
