Fluorescence immunoassay is a sensitive technique that can be used in the measurement of many substances, mainly proteins, and in the quantification of antigens from viruses or bacteria. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) is a common fluorescent label that produces conjugates with proteins and other biological materials with applications in imaging and sensitive analysis. Different kinds of fluorescent nanoparticle conjugates may be used for bacterial detection. Immunoassay using fluorescent antibody-nanoparticle conjugates may be applied for the detection of Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli or P. aeruginosa. Conjugates of functionalized silica nanoparticles with FITC allow for the rapid detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7 by flow cytometry in beef samples. Rabbit anti-E. coli O157:H7 antibody was used to recognize E. coli O157:H7. Protein A, a stable protein extracted from S. aureus, was used for antibody coupling on silica nanoparticle surfaces. The method is rapid, selective and sensitive for the detection of E. coli [59] . Immunoassay methodology using small molecules as a substitute for antibodies with a strong affinity to the bacteria, such as certain antibiotics, have been proposed. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic with affinity to gram-positive bacteria due to the multivalent hydrogen binding effect. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles modified with vancomycin have been developed for the recognition and killing of Gram-positive bacteria. Mesopores of vancomycin silica nanoparticles were loaded with a fluorescent molecule (FITC). After incubation with FITC and bacteria, the detection was performed by measuring the fluorescence with high specificity and sensitivity. With this method, the detection and killing of Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus was performed [60] . Also, glucose stabilized silver nanoparticles labeled with a pyrimidine fluorescent derivative were attached to the monoclonal antibody (IgG) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The fluorescence response was able to be enhanced when the fluorophore was localized near a metal surface due to the characteristics of the metallic nanoparticle. This nanosystem allows for the detection of bacteria in water, agriculture samples, soil, and different types of food [61, 62] . CdSe/ZnS quantum dots incorporated into SiO2 microspheres constitute a fluorescent labeled system for the detection of S. typhimurium.

CdSe/ZnS quantum dots incorporated into SiO 2 microspheres constitute a fluorescent labeled system for the detection of S. typhimurium. The conjugate between fluorescent nanoparticles and bacteria may be detected by fluorescence microscopy. The detection limit was 3.3 Ã— 10 2 CFU/mL, and this method may be applied to the detection of other bacteria [63] . Bacterial detection and killing in liquid-and solid-phase systems can also be achieved using surface-coatable NIR response fluorescent nanoparticles. Polydopamine (PdA) is a biomaterial with adhesive properties. Carbonized polydopamine (FDA) may be functionalized with polyethylenimine (PEI) to form fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (FDA:PEI). The cationic surface of these nanoparticles may bind to the anionic bacterial wall of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as S. aureus or E. coli through changes in the fluorescent signal. In addition NIR irradiation of carbonized nanoparticles produces heat and kills the bacteria [64] . Food poisoning produced by bacteria is an important cause of disease and death. The bacteria that cause the most illnesses and deaths are Salmonella enterica, E. coli and Clostridium sp. Janus nanoparticles are colloidal systems with two spatial domains that have different physicochemical properties. The use of Janus micromotors as mobile sensors has been proposed for the detection of toxins released by enterobacteria. Magnetocatalytic Janus micromotors encapsulating phenylboronic acid (PABA) modified graphene quantum dots based on platinum nanoparticles that produce blue fluorescence emission allow the fast monitoring of enterobacterial contamination in food [65, 66] . The use of fluorescent nanoconstructs as probes has been proposed for the improvement of virus detection techniques based on immunoassays [107, 108] . Some authors have developed a fluorescent diagnostic device compatible with a smartphone camera that transmits its data to a central data base system, thus proposing an interesting POC testing method for influenza screening that could even result in an international real-time surveillance system [109] . Some authors have also combined metallic nanoparticles with fluorescence enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (FELISA) for hepatitis B diagnosis. Thus, by employing dually labeled gold nanoparticles, an enhancement in HBsAg detection limits of conventional ELISA has been observed [110] . Gold nanoparticles and quantum dots have been used for virus detection by FRET, as electron acceptor or donor respectively in FRET pairs. The fluorophore conjugated to specific antibodies undergoes a conformational change when binding to the virus, which changes the distance between the fluorescent molecules or the fluorescent/quencher molecules and a measurable change in the resonance energy transfer is observed. They have been applied to Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) but could be used for other viruses by including the appropriate antibody [111] . Gold and silver nanowires have also been applied as quenchers to immobilize Molecular Beacon hairpin [94] . This structure, consisting of looped strands of DNA with a fluorophore and a fluorescence quencher at the opposite terminus, takes on its open bright state in the presence of the specific target strand of DNA or RNA. Nanowire combinations such as nanobarcodes could accomplish multiplexed assays by designing the oligonucleotides of different nanowires to be complementary to target DNA sequences of different viruses, as has been demonstrated for the simultaneous detection of hepatitis A virus, hepatitis C virus, West Nile Virus, HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus [112] . Quantum dots (QD) have also been explored just as a fluorophore. They allow the detection and monitoring of viral infection through the detection of bioconjugates obtained due to antibody affinity or other interactions. Using different colored QDs could even provide additional information simultaneously, such as structural changes in cytoskeleton. They have demonstrated better sensitivity than respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection based on antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) [94] . They have also demonstrated their potential for influenza virus detection in clinical samples without any pretreatment [113] and for early stage diagnosis of HIV infections [114] . QDs have also been suggested for hepatitis detection but no better sensitivity than other methods has been proved for this virus [73, 115] . Colorimetric detection has been used in the detection of respiratory viruses. An enhanced plasmonic ELISA was developed for RSV detection by combining alkaline phosphatase-mediated AuNPs-based colorimetric assay with metal ion sensitized dephosphorylation of ATP [116] . Regarding influenza virus, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) has been used as a signal tag for immunoreaction. Color change was observed in the presence of the virus due to silver deposition on the surface of gold nanoparticles induced by the enzyme. Coupled with magnetic enrichment, this method has been demonstrated to be simple, fast and highly sensitive, allowing H9N2 virus detection directly in complex samples [117] . Metallic nanoparticles have been demonstrated to improve HIV-1 p24 antigen assay. Nanoarrays obtained by nanolithography have shown an enhancement in the detection limit as well as faster detection than the conventional colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [75] . A microchip based on microfluidics and nanoparticles has been developed which allows diagnosis on-site of both HIV and syphilis. This device replicates the ELISA steps and allows the detection of antibody markers within scarcely few minutes at low cost, with enough sensitivity and specificity and requiring just a few microliters of blood sample. Thus, this mChip miniaturizes ELISA techniques and, implemented in a handheld instrument easy to operate, provides a fast and affordable assay that can be used in the most remote regions [118] . Dual-luminophore-doped silica nanoparticles with different surface modifications have been studied for multiplexed analysis. In combination with flow cytometry, it has been suggested that these systems have interesting advantageous properties in the detection of pathogens, especially for those that have problems with normal dyes due to their minimal specific antigens. Results revealed that these nanoparticles have high signal amplification, excellent photostability and easy surface bioconjugation for biomarker detection, which highlights this system as an ideal biolabeling reagent in antigens and nucleic acids detection [119] . Other methods based on colorimetric detection have been applied to virus detection. Through association of gold nanoparticles with reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification, a very simple assay for hepatitis E was developed, whose results can be evaluated with the naked eye due to color changes. It has been proposed as an alternative to other expensive and time-consuming methods usually employed [120] . Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles have been also applied as nanozyme probes, harnessing their natural intrinsic peroxidase-like activity that can be visually detected due to the obvious color reaction. By labelling them with specific antibodies and in the presence of peroxide substrates, they have been studied for immunomagnetic Ebola virus detection [121] . Other DNA detection methods based on chemiluminescent labels and magnetic nanoparticles use DNA capture probes coupled to magnetic nanoparticles. By including a long spacer arm in magnetic nanoparticles, freedom for DNA hybridization and chemiluminescence detection is increased. An ultrasensitive method based on this system has been developed for the hepatitis B virus as a proof of concept [85] , but it could be applied to other viruses.
