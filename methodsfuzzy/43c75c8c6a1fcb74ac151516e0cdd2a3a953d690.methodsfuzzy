All procedures were reviewed and approved by the director of the student health center. Approval by an institutional review board (IRB) was not necessary because human subjects were not studied and could not be identified and the sources of the viruses detected could not be tracked. Health care facility. The Student Health Care Center at the University of Florida (Gainesville, FL) is a freestanding building that has its own heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. During the study, indoor air temperatures were maintained at around 71°F (22°C) on the first floor and 73°F (23°C) on the second floor, whereas the relative humidity ranged from 44% to 46% on both floors. Air samplings at a small classroom in another UF building (Black Hall) were conducted for comparison. Black Hall also has its own HVAC system, wherein indoor temperatures were typically around 73°F (23°C) and relative humidity around 47% when this work was performed. Sampling dates. Air samplings at the Student Health Care Center were performed on 11 March, 28 March, and 8 April 2016, as there was an influenza outbreak in Gainesville in March 2016. Air samplings in Black Hall were performed on 19 August, 26 August, and 9 September 2016. Aerosol collection system. Ambient virus aerosol particles from both the Student Health Care Center and Black Hall were collected using the VIVAS and an SKC BioSampler. The collection system is schematically depicted in Fig. 2 . The VIVAS collection mechanism was previously described (20) ; briefly, after passage through a cool temperature conditioner, the initiator activates and grows particles as small as 8 nm into droplets greater than 2 m in diameter (Fig. 2) . The enlarged particles are subsequently directed through a set of 32 nozzles of 0.66-mm diameter for gentle collection onto 1.5 ml of collection medium consisting of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 0.5% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA) fraction V in a 35-mm-diameter petri dish. The BioSampler is presently considered the reference air sampler for the collection of airborne bacteria and fungi, and it has been used in attempts to collect virus aerosols (7, 34) . During its use, intake air is diverted through three 0.63-mm tangential nozzles above the collection medium, resulting in a swirling airflow; this airflow reduces impaction forces on particles that are deposited onto the collection medium. The same collection medium was used with the BioSampler, but by necessity the volume in the BioSampler was 20 ml. To avoid discrepancies in virus concentrations due to sampling location, the inlets of the VIVAS and the BioSampler were bound together. Both the VIVAS and the BioSampler were operated at a flow rate of 8 liters/min, as this sampling rate was more effective for both air samplers for the collection of virus aerosols and maintenance of the virus infectivity compared with the standard flow rate of 12.5 liters/min (35, 36) . To reduce noise, the sampling pump (Welch model 2014-B01) was placed within a covered box. Air sampler placement. The layout of the study areas, their ceiling vents, and the air sampler positions in the Student Health Care Center are shown in Fig. 3 . The first sampling (11 March) was conducted in the first floor lobby, near the center's reception desk (Fig. 3b) . As the air was sampled, it was observed that few people sat near the receptionist's desk but many took a drink at the fountain. During the second and third air samplings (28 March and 8 April) , the air samplers were positioned within a waiting room on the second floor (Fig. 3a) . On 28 May, the waiting room was visibly crowded, and as people waited for medical attention, many were observed to be coughing and sneezing, which are obvious signs of respiratory infections. In contrast, relatively few patients were present on 8 April. Air samplings in the classroom in Black Hall were conducted right after classes, with few if any students remaining in the room. The inlets of the air samplers were set at a height of 1.2 m oriented horizontal to the ground and facing the people, which approximates the average height of a seated adult person. Negative-control runs were also performed with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter installed at the inlet of the samplers. A collection time of 60 min was used to sample about 480 liters of air. Air sampling and negative-control runs were conducted alternatively. Upon completion of air samplings, the pump was shut off, the VIVAS and the BioSampler were disconnected, and collection medium in each apparatus was aseptically transferred into sterile 50-ml conical polypropylene tubes, which were immediately placed in an insulated box with ice packs for transport to the laboratory. Similar sampling procedures were followed for the sampling at Black Hall, wherein the samplers were placed at the front corner of the classroom close to the podium. Virology laboratory. Virology work was performed in a biosafety level 2 enhanced laboratory at the UF. Air sampler collection medium volume reduction and adjustment. To standardize volumes and obviate large-scale cell cultures for virus isolation attempts, air sampler collection medium samples were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units with Ultracel-100 membranes with a molecular mass cutoff of 100 kDa (Millipore, Bedford, MA) at 4,000 ϫ g for 20 min to a volume of approximately 400 l, the volumes were adjusted to 500 l by addition of collection medium, and the concentrate was stored at Ϫ80°C until virus isolation in cell cultures was attempted (7). Cell lines. Emphasis was on the isolation of influenza viruses and genetic analyses thereof, but lesser efforts were nevertheless exerted to isolate other common "culturable" human respiratory viruses to gain insights on the general utility of the VIVAS for virus aerosols. The term "culturable" refers to those viruses that can be isolated and propagated using standard cell lines and methods. To favor isolation of a wide variety of respiratory viruses, concentrated air sample collection media were inoculated onto a variety of readily available ("standard") cell lines obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) for virus isolation attempts, including the following: A549 (CCL-185), HeLa (CCL-2), LLC-MK2 (CCL-7), MDCK (CCL-34), MRC-5 (CCL-171), NCI-H292, and Vero E6 (CRL-1586). Common human respiratory viruses that can be isolated using these cells are shown in Table S1 (T. Bonny and J. Lednicky, unpublished data). All the cell lines were propagated as monolayers at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in advanced Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (aDMEM) or Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) (both from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), as appropriate per cell line. Prior to the preparation of seed stocks, each cell line was treated for 3 weeks with plasmocin and verified free of mycoplasma DNA by PCR (37) . Inoculation and identification of human respiratory viruses. After thawing on ice, equal aliquots (~50 l) of the archived concentrated air sampler collection media were inoculated directly without prefiltration onto newly confluent cells in 6-well plates. The inoculated cells were incubated at 35°C, and plates were monitored daily for signs of virus-induced CPE (i.e., formation of visible changes in the appearance of the nuclei of infected cells, together with the formation of focal enlarged granular cells or nonspecific cell deterioration, followed by detachment of the swollen cells from the growth surface), with refeeds performed every 3 days. Noninfected cells were maintained and refed in parallel for comparison. Cells were maintained and observed for a total of 30 days before being considered negative for virus isolation. Viruses were identified based on cell tropism (Table S1 ), type of CPE they induced, use of the GenMark respiratory virus panel, a solid-phase ELISA for influenza A and B viruses, group-and/or virus species-specific PCR or RT-PCR, and sequencing of virus-specific PCR amplicons or complete virus genomes. GenMark respiratory virus panel. A GenMarkDx multiplex PCR eSensor XT-8 respiratory viral panel (eSensor RVP; GenMark Diagnostics, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) was used to screen spent cell growth media for the genomic DNA or RNA of respiratory viruses, according to the manufacturer's instructions. This technique detects the genomic material of influenza A virus (including subtypes H1 and H3), influenza A virus 2009 H1N1, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4, human metapneumovirus, adenoviruses B/E and C, coronaviruses 229E, -NL63, -HKU1, and -OC43, and human rhinoviruses A and B.
