A standardized, laboratory based and rapid diagnostic test for the identification of these organisms is desirable. To determine the laboratory method that best predicted the causative organism, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of positive and negative test for clinical criteria, an oligonucleotide probe test (AFFIRM VPIII-BD USA) and compared them with the combination of positive vaginal culture and Gram-stained vaginal smear. We evaluated 40 consecutive women aged 21 Á/48 years, attending for vaginal discharge. Vaginal swab specimens were used for culture of Gardnerella vaginalis , Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida sp, preparation of a vaginal smear for Gram-stain interpretation and wet mount evaluation and AFFIRM test. AFFIRM detected G. vaginalis in 10 (25%), Candida sp in three (7.5%) women and no trichomoniasis case found by any methods. The sensitivity and negative predictive values of AFFIRM test and clinical signs were same (100%) in identifying of bacterial vaginosis. However, AFFIRM test was more specific (94 vs 72%) and also has higher positive predictive value (80 vs 53%) than clinical signs. We did not evaluate the results for patients with candidiasis because of less number. According to these results AFFIRM-microbial identification tests are objective and specific for the rapid diagnosis of the bacterial vaginosis. Comparison of efficacy of single dose of tinidazole with standard dose of metronidazole in Giardia lamblia infection (Preliminary report) PS182 Fallah M a , Moshtaghi AA b . a University of Medical Sciences, Parasitology, Hamadan, Islamic Republic of Iran , b University of Medical Sciences, Pediatrics, Hamadan, Islamic Republic of Iran Objectives: Giardia lamblia is the most common intestinal protozoa in developing countries. Treatment of the infection with metronidazole, the drug of choice, requires a long course of therapy and produced some side effects. The object of this study is to determine efficacy and side effects of tinidazole in G. lamblia infection. This is a preliminary report of an ongoing trial. Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial was carried out and 47 subjects with G. lamblia infection were treated with tinidazole or metronidazole. Tinidazole 50 mg/kg single dose and metronidazole 25 mg/kg three times a day for 7 days were given orally to 24 and 23 children, respectively. Parasitological cure was documented when there were consecutive negative stool examinations at 1 Á/2 weeks after therapy. Results: Twenty-one of 23 individuals treated with tinidazole and 20 of 24 children treated with metronidazole had parasitological cure. Cure rates between two groups were not significant statistically. No major side effects were observed except one case in metronidazole group who had mild headache and abdominal pain for 2 days. Conclusions: We concluded, tinidazole at the dose has efficacy equal of metronidazole in the treatment of G. lamblia infection. Because of single dose prescription, short course of therapy and good compliance of patients, this preparation is preferred to metronidazole in giardial infection. Ebeid FA, Seif El-Din SH. Theodor Bilharz Research Institute, Pharmacology, Cairo, Egypt b-Carotein was given in different doses starting from 2.5 to 10 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) for different groups of albino mice 4 days before infection with S. mansoni . Infection of animals was done by body immersion using 80 Egyptian strain of S. mansoni cercariae/mouse. Forty-nine days after infection the animals were sacrificed and hepatic and mesenteric worms were extracted and determined. Ova count in liver and intestinal tissue and the total number of worms/animals were also determined in experimental groups comparing with infected control animals. The results indicated marked decrease in number of worms and ova count in both liver and intestine comparing with control ones. This reduction increased significantly with increasing dose. It was concluded that b-carotein could be used as a prophylactic agent against S. mansoni infection. Rokosz A a , Sawicka-Grzelak A a , Meszaros J b , Luczak M a . a Department of Medical Microbiology, The University Medical School, Warsaw, Poland , b Department of Bacteriology, State Institute of Hygiene, Warsaw, Poland Purpose: To identify ESBL-positive strains and to compare two methods applied for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Methods: Two hundred and sixty strains of Gram-negative rods were cultured from clinical specimens from hospitalized patients. Identification of strains was performed in the automatic ATB system (bioMerieux, France). These strains were identified as ESBL-positive on the basis of the double-disc synergy test (DDST according to Jarlier et al., 1988) results. All strains were also determined using a novel method of ESBL detection (DD, diagnostic disc) according to Appleton (1999) . Two discs were applied in this test: CPD (cefpodoxime) and CD 01 (cefpodoxime/clavulanic acid) (Oxoid, England). Results: Consistent results of two methods (DDST and DD) were obtained in the case of 166 from among 260 of examined strains (60.4%). Consistent results concerned 161 out of 222 strains of enteric rods (72.5%) and only five from among 38 other strains (mostly nonfermenting rods). Conclusions: The novel method of ESBL-producers detection (DD) is more objective and easier for interpretation than the double-disc synergy test (DDST). Diagnostic disc test should be used as the basic one or to confirm the results of DDST in difficult cases. Assessment of E -test for determining penicillin resistance in pneumococci PM172 Sener B, Yeniþehirli G, Ercis S, Hasçelik G. Department of Clinical Microbiology, Hacettepe University Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey There is a greater need for susceptibility testing methods that distinguish between susceptible and resistant pneumococci. An alternative method could be the E -test, which is compared with the reference agar dilution method in this study. Penicillin susceptibility of a total of 149 pneumococci was determined by E -test and agar dilution methods. Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 were used as controls. The results were given in the Effect of anoxic conditions on the minimum inhibitory concentration of metronidazole in Helicobacter pylori PM173 de la Obra Sanz P, Lomas E, Roman JL, Alarcon T, Lopez-Brea M.
