As an important assessment tool, the SCID has been widely used in clinical research since its publication. However, few largescale epidemiological studies have utilized the SCID as a diagnostic tool on a global scale. Different from the WHO MH-CIDI, the SCID was designed to be administered by a clinician or trained mental health professional, which can be very costly. In fact, so far only large-scale epidemiological studies conducted in China (Phillips et al., 2009 ) have used the SCID as an assessment tool. Two major differences between those by Phillips et al. (2009) and the current one are worth pointing out: First, the studies by Phillips et al. (2009) involved a two-stage screening process. In the first stage all subjects were screened with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and classified into three risk strata for mental disorder, and in the second-stage all high-risk respondents and a random selection of moderate or low risk respondents were assigned to complete the diagnostic assessment using the SCID. Second, only less than one third (28%) of the study subjects completed the assessment with the SCID. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first large-scale representative community epidemiological survey in which all respondents were screened using a one-stage investigation method with the SCID performed by mental health professionals. These are the most notable strengths of this study. Another strength of this study was the sampling design: we adopted the cluster stratified random sampling method. The basic sampling unit was the household with all eligible members being included, rather than specific individuals from every household. This method avoided the random selection of others in the absence of the initially selected resident within each household, and decreased possible selection bias.
