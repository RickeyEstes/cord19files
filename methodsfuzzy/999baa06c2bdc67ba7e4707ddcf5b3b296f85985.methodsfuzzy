samples. Samples for our study were collected with the consent of the owner in early November 2017, and consisted of faecal samples collected from the ground and saliva samples collected from empty food bowls. Faecal samples were collected immediately after being deposited by individual puppies, while saliva samples were taken by swabbing food bowls immediately after a litter of puppies had emptied and licked the bowls while deposited saliva was fresh. The studies described here were performed in accordance with all relevant guidelines and regulations and as only environmental samples were included, do not require animal ethics approval. Swabs were placed in Universal Transport Medium (UTM) and stored on ice overnight. The following morning, swabs were aliquoted and frozen at minus 80 °C until analysis. The samples analysed in the present study included faecal samples from 2 puppies (1 from the group of puppies with prior gastrointestinal disease and 1 from a group of puppies from the litters without signs of disease), and saliva samples from the same two groups of puppies with and without prior disease, respectively. To reduce initial NGS testing costs, the 2 faecal samples were combined and the 4 food bowl swabs (saliva samples) combined, so that the study included a single pooled faecal sample DF-1-2-AUS-2017 and a single pooled saliva sample DS-3-4-5-6-AUS-2017. The four saliva samples were also later processed separately for testing with NGS to better investigate the viruses present in the individual dogs. In mid-January 2018, two and half months after the initial sampling of the puppies, the kennel was revisited and individual faecal samples were collected from 7 dogs aged between 3 days and 2 years old to determine if a canine astrovirus, present at the initial sampling, was still circulating there. Virus enrichment, Nucleic acid extraction and cDNA synthesis. For NGS, the samples were processed, and virus particles enriched using a protocol optimised in our laboratory described previously 38 . Briefly, www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the samples were homogenised at 25 Hz for 2 min followed by centrifugation at 17000 g for 3 min and filtered using a 0.8 um Polyethersulfone (PES) Spin-column filter. The sample was then divided into two, one being ultracentrifuged at 178,000 g for 1 h and the other not ultracentrifuged. Both were then treated with benzonase and micrococcal nuclease for 2 h to enrich for nucleic acids protected in virus particles 38 . Nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) were extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). An initial RNA denaturation step of 95 °C for 3 min followed by snap-cooling in an ethanol-ice bath (minus 20 °C) was carried out before cDNA synthesis and DNA amplification using the SeqPlex RNA Amplification Kit (Sigma) as per the protocol described 38 Detection of virus in the samples. The sequence data generated for each sample were analysed further for the detection of viruses using BLASTN 39, 40 query with an e-value cut-off score of 1 × 10 −10 and BLASTX 39, 40 query with an e-value cut-off of 1 × 10 −10 against a local database created from available virus sequences from the NCBI GenBank genetic sequence database (downloaded May 2018) as described previously 38 . Based on the number of high quality reads (initially Q > 20) matched to the reference viruses, and coverage of the reads across the reference genomes, we focused our analysis on 3 viruses of interest present in the samples: canine astrovirus, parvovirus and papillomavirus. The TMAP plugin 41 from the Ion Torrent suite was used for mapping the NGS reads using selected reference genomes of these viruses from NCBI Genbank [see Table S6 for details] which were identified as most similar to the viruses in the dog samples. Near full or partial consensus sequences were generated from the mapped sequences using Integrative Genomics Viewer software (IGV) (Broad Institute, MA, USA) 42 with a mapping quality score of 32 or higher and a coverage depth of at least 2 with further details noted in Results. phylogenetic analysis. The virus consensus sequences were compared with the online NCBI Genbank using BLASTN and the closest related sequences selected for further analyses using MEGA 7 software 43 . For the canine parvovirus 2 (CPV2) comparisons, we also added the available sequences of the CPV2 Protech C3 Vaccine and CPV2 Canigen C3 Vaccine viruses 20 . Sequences were aligned using Clustal-W 44 or in some cases for codon alignments using Muscle 45 . The Maximum likelihood (ML) method with the best fitting model, as determined by MEGA, was selected for generating phylogenetic trees and the robustness of different nodes assessed by bootstrap analysis using 1000 replicates for nucleotide alignments and 500 replicates for amino acid alignments. simplot analysis. Similarity plot (SimPlot) was used to observe possible recombination between our sequence and related sequences. A 200 nucleotides sliding window at 20 nucleotides intervals and the F84 distance model with maximum likelihood method was used. Percentage identities at each analysis point were plotted on a line chart 46 . Canine astrovirus partial open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) PCR and Sanger Sequencing. Real time PCR targeting the ORF1b region of canine astrovirus was conducted in order to see if the individual faecal samples were positive or negative for canine astrovirus. Primers (Micromon -Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia) were designed to amplify RNA dependent RNA Polymerase gene (RdRP) encoded by ORF1b using Primer Blast and OligoCalc software 47, 48 . TRB-CAstV ORF1b-F3 (5′-TCCATGGGCCTAACAAGCAG-3′) and TRB-CAstV ORF1b-R3 (5′-TGGTTTGAGAAGTGAGGCCA-3′) were used as forward and reverse primer respectively. cDNA was synthesized as described above. The PCR master mix was made with PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermofisher Scientific) with 1 mM of each primer and 2 ul of cDNA in a total reaction volume of 10 ul. A QuantStudio ™ Flex 6 real-time thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) was used for amplification at 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 sec, 54 °C annealing temperature for 30 sec, 72 °C for 30 sec and a final 72 °C step for 3 min. A melt curve analysis was performed immediately post PCR with reactions subjected to 95 °C for 15 sec, then 60 °C for 1 min followed by a continuous temperature ramp between 60 °C and 95 °C increasing at 0.05 °C/sec. PCR products of ~269 bp size were purified using the 2% Size Select E-Gel System (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). These products were re-amplified by AmpliTaq Gold ™ 360 Master Mix (Applied Bio systems) using the same primers and PCR program mentioned above. PCR products were sequenced using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle v3.1 on a Hitachi 3500xl genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) 49 .
