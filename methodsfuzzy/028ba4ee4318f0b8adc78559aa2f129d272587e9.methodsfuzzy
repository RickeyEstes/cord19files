Detection frequencies of selected enteric pathogens (i.e., BRV-A, BCoV and C. parvum) in calf diarrhea cases submitted to ISUVDL from 2003 to 2011 were compared based on laboratory methods used. Before 2008, antigencapturing ELISA and fecal smear direct microscopy (acidfast stain) tests were used to detect BRV-A/BCoV and C. parvum in feces, respectively. Since then, a bovine enteric panel (BEP) consisting of 2 multiplex rtPCR tests was implemented for simultaneous detection of BRV-A, BCoV, and C. parvum in feces. All diagnostic data were retrieved from the ISUVDL laboratory information management system. The mean detection frequency of BRV-A, BCoV and C. parvum in diarrhea cases during year 2003-2007 were 24.6%, 11.9% and 8.7%, respectively, when antigen-capturing ELISAs and direct microscopy (acid-fast stain) were the main laboratory methods for detection of these pathogens at ISUVDL. After implementation of a PCR panel for the major calf diarrhea pathogens, the mean detection frequency of BRV-A, BCoV and C. parvum were 37.2%, 29.2% and 38.3%, respectively, during year 2008-2011 (Table 6) .
