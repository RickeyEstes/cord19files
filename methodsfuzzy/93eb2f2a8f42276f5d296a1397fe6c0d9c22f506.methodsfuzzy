Records were searched at three referral centres in Sydney, NSW from January 1995 to December 2002 for cats that had CSF analysis. CSF collection was performed in 111 cats. Of these, 62 cats could be classified as having inflammatory CNS disease. CSF was collected by percutaneous puncture from either the cerebello-medullary cistern or via lumbar puncture from either the L5eL6 or L4eL5 intervertebral space. CSF analysis included total white cell count and red cell count by haemocytometer, cytomorphology by stained sediment (Idexx Laboratories Pty Ltd) or stained cytocentrifuge smears (The University of Sydney Department of Clinical Pathology) and total protein by evaluation of microprotein on a commercial biochemistry autoanalyser (Olympus AU 400, Idexx Laboratories; Cobas Mira, The University of Sydney Department of Clinical Pathology). The reference ranges used by our laboratories for feline CSF were: white cell count %5 cells/ml, red cell count 0 cells/ml and total protein !0.3 g/l (Canfield and Martin 1998, Raskin and Myer 2001 ). An inflammatory CSF analysis was defined as one in which a total nucleated cell count was greater than 5 cells/ml or one in which the total nucleated cell count was normal but the nucleated cell differential count was abnormal (O9% neutrophils, O1% eosinophils) (Canfield and Martin 1998, Raskin and Myer 2001) . CSF nucleated cell counts were classified as: 1, normal: %5 cells/ml; 2, mildly elevated: 6e50 cells/ml; 3, moderately elevated: 51e1000 cells/ml and 4, markedly elevated: O1000 cells/ml. The nucleated cell population was classified as: 1, suppurative: O50% neutrophils; 2, non-suppurative: O80% mononuclear cells; 3, eosinophilic: O50% eosinophils and 4, mixed: no predominance of any one cell type (Canfield and Martin 1998, Raskin and Myer 2001) . CSF total protein was classified as 1, normal: %0.3 g/l; 2, mildly elevated: 0.31e10 g/ l; 3, moderately elevated: 11e20 g/l and markedly elevated: O20 g/l. CSF erythrocyte counts were classified as: 1, normal: 0 cells/ml; 2, mildly elevated: 1e49 cells/ml; 3, moderately elevated 50e1000 cells/ml and 4, markedly elevated: O1000 cells/ml (Table 1 ). The contribution of CSF red cell contamination to the total CSF white cell count was corrected for by subtracting 1 nucleated cell for every 100 red cells (Rand et al 1990) . Cats with CSF nucleated cell count that was less than or equal to that predicted from blood contamination were excluded from the study. Haematology was performed on standard automated counters (Celldyn, Idexx Laboratories; Sysmex K-4500, University of Sydney Clinical Pathology). Differential cell counts were performed via stained (Diff Quick) blood smear examination. Biochemistry was performed using standard automated chemistry analysers described previously. Cryptococcal antigen titres were measured by latex agglutination (negative titre Z 0), Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibody titres were measured by indirect haemagglutination (negative Z !1:80), T gondii IgM titres were measured by indirect fluorescent antibody (negative ! 1:80), feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigen was measured by ELISA, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) specific antibody was measured by ELISA and feline coronavirus (FeCoV) antibody was measured by indirect fluorescent antibody (negative titre Z !1:100). Owners and referring veterinarians were contacted to determine the outcome after discharge from hospital. The evaluation period ranged from 0.4 months to 7 years. The following parameters were evaluated for each cat: 1, signalment; 2, duration of clinical signs; 3, neurological findings and localisation of lesion; 4, systemic signs; 5, cerebrospinal fluid testing; 6, ancillary testing including results of culture, diagnostic imaging, blood evaluation and 7, outcome.
