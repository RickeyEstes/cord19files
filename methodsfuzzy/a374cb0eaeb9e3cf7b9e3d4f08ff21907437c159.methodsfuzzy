The IgG of mAb 5E8 was purified using HiTrap TM protein G HP (Fig 8A) . The IPMA method was optimized for TGEV detection. The TGEV-infected PK-15 cells (10 3 TCID 50 , 36 h postinfection) were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) for 20 min at 4°C. Subsequently, the cells were blocked with 5% skim milk at 37°C for 1 h. The optimum concentration of the primary antibody (purified 5E8 IgG) was 0.5 ng/μL, and the dilution of the secondary antibody was 1:2000. IPMA revealed red-brown staining in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells (Fig 8B) .
