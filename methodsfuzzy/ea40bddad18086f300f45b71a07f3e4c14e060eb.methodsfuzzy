2.1. Plasmids, Antibodies, and Peptides. The plasmids pXXStv-3 and pXXGST-1 were used to express various biosynthetic peptides in E. coli [20] . Rabbit sera against r-hZP3a and r-hZP3b prepared as described previously were used for BCE identification and minimal motif mapping [21] . Peptides FSLRLMEENWNAEKRS (P1) and SFSKPSNSWF-PVEGP (P2) corresponding to hZP3 172-187 and hZP3 301-315 as well as PETQPGPLTLELQIAKDK (P3) corresponding to hZP4 308-325 were produced on an APEX396 synthesizer by Sangon Co. (Shanghai, China), with more than 90% purity on HPLC. The peptides P1 and P2 were used as antigens to test antibody against P1 or P2 by ELISA, and peptide P3 was used as unrelated control peptide in ELISA.
