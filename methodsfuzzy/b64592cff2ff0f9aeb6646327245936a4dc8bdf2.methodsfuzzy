(a) Synthesis of oligmucleotides RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and a synthetic DNA template with a double-stranded promoter region and a single-stranded template region (Milligan et al., 1987) . T7 RNA polymerase was purified as described (Davenloo et al., 1984) . DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized using standard solid-phase phosphoramidite chemistry. Transcription reactions were incubated at 37째C for approximately 2 h in 40 mM-Tris.HCl (pH gl at 37 "(7). 1 mM-spermidine, 5 rnM-dithiothreitol, 001 y0 (v/v) Triton X100, 80 mg polyethylene glycol/ml (relative molecular mass = WOO), 36% mM-MgCl,, 4 mM each nucleoside triphosphate and 5 mM-GMP. The DNA concentration was 63 PM per strand and T7 RNA polymerase was used at 30 units/pi. Typical yields were between 10 to 15 nmol of strand per ml of reaction (2 to 3 A,,, units/ ml). For n.m.r. quantities, reaction volumes were 50 to 75 ml. Reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA to 50 mM. The reaction mixtures were extracted with phenol, then with chloroform and were precipitated with ethanol. Full-length transcripts were isolated from a denaturing (7 M-urea) 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. Reactions yielded 2 major bands corresponding to the correct length and to transcript with an additional nucleotide at the 3' terminus. Gel electrophoresis allowed good resolution of these products. Resolution was worse when reactions were primed using GMP. Incorporation of GMP at position 1 was about 80% efficient as determined by 2-dimensional thin-layer chromatography analysis of total RNase digests of transcripts primed with GMP and labeled with [a-32P]CTP (Nishimura et aZ.. 1967) . RNA transcripts were electroeluted from the gel using an Elutrap electro-elution apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell) and then precipitated with ethanol. Final purification involved extensive dialysis (approx. 24 h) using a microdialysis apparatus (Bethesda Research) first versus 5 m&i-EDTA, 10 mivr-sodium phosphate (pH 6.4). then versus water. The sequence and length were verified by 2-dimensional thin-layer chromatography analysis of products of complete enzymatic hydrolysis of internally labeled or 3' end-labeled transcripts (Kuchino et al., 1980) and by partial digestion of 5' end-labeled transcript with basespecific RNases. A Rio-Rad TSK-125 gel-filtration column was used to ensure that the structure formed was monomeric even at high strand concentration. A buffer identical with the n.m.r. buffer was used and retention time was compared with the retention times of RNA molecules of known structure and size. Enzymatic and chemical structure mapping experiments were performed as described in the following paper . (b) Deuteriation of nucleotides GTP and GMP were deuteriated at the 8 position of guanine by incubating in *H,O at 50째C for 24 h (Benevides et al., 1984) . UTP was deuteriated at the 5 position of uridine using a modification of the method of Hayatsu (Hayatsu et al., 1970; Wataya & Hayatsu, 1972; Brush et al., 1988) . A stock solution of (NH,),SOa (25~) was lyophilized twice from 'H,O; 120mg UTP was dissolved in 1.0 ml of 25 M (N*H,),SO, and adjusted to pH 80 using NaO*H. The UTP was incubated for 28 h at 50째C. The reaction was monitored by the disappearance of the H5 resonance and the collapse of the H6 doublet into a singlet in the n.m.r. spectrum. Incubation at higher temperatures or higher pH resulted in hydrolysis to UDP and UMP. The majority of the product was not the d*UTP, but the adduct of bisulfite to UTP (Wataya & Hayatsu. 1972 Concentrations of n.m.r. samples were 1-O to 1.5 mw-strand. All n.m.r. spectra are referenced relative to trimethylsilylpropionate (TSP). n.m.r. spectra of exchangeable protons were acquired using a I-3-3-1 pulse sequence (Hore, 1983) . The carrier was placed on the water resonance with a delay time of 125 pa and a spectral width of 15,500 Hz. One-dimensional NOE were measured using decoupler irradiation with a 1-3-3-1 pulse sequece. The irradiation time was 600 ma. All l-dimensional NOE measurements were done at 4.O"C. NOE difference spectra were obtained by interleaving on and off-resonance irradiation. Typically, 4000 scans were taken to achieve good signal to noise. Double-precision acquisition allowed the use of high (16 bit) digitizer resolution. Decoupler spillover was determined by irradiating at variable offsets from a peak. Spillover was estimated at 100 Hz at the decoupler power used. Difference spectra were processed using 5 Hz line broadening. NOESY spectra were obtained using the standard pulse sequence and phasing cycling for pure phase spectra (Bodenhausen et al., 1984) . Data sets were 2006 in t, with a sweep-width (s.w.) of 44w28 Hz. A total of 450 to 500 t, values were collected with 128 scans per t,. A relaxation delay of 1.8 to 2.0 s was used. Total acquisition time was approx. 30 h. NOESY spectra were obtained at 400 ma for assignment of the spectrum and 150 ms for distance determination. NOESY spectra at short ( < 150 ma) mixing time had poor signal-to-noise. All NOESY spectra were measured at 23째C. Spectra were processed using a skewed sine bell function with a 30" phase shift and a skew factor of 67. Interproton distances were approximated from NOE cross-peak volumes at short mixing times. The NOE intensities of the fixed CH6CH5 distance (245 A; 1 A = 61 nm) was used as a reference. These intensities varied by only 10 to 20% among the 6 cytosine residues. Volume integrals of resolved cross peaks were measured using an ellipse-based method in FTNMR (D. Hare, Infinity Systems). The mixing time of 150 ma was adequate for estimating intermediate range distances ( > 25 A). Phase-sensitive COSY and double-quantum-filtered COSY (DQF-COSY) spectra were obtained using the standard pulse sequences and phase cycling (Piantini et al., 1982; Bodenhausen et al., 1984) . Data sets were 2000 in t, with a S.W. of 446428 Hz; 128 scans were acquired per t,; typical data sets consisted of 450 to 500 t, values. Data were processed using a sine bell with a 30" phase shift in both t, and t,. Double-quantum (DQ) spectra were obtained using the 90-r/2-180-T/2-90-t,-90-t, pulse sequence with standard phase cycling (Braunschweiler et al., 1983) . The carrier was placed just upfield from the H2'/H3'/H4'/H5'/H5" region of the spectrum. A S.W. of 400 Hz was used, which resulted in some foldover in the H5-H6 region. The delay time (7) was set to 50 ma to maximize excitation of DQ coherences with coupling of approx. 10 Hz in an AX spin system. Data sets were 2000 in t,; 400 t, values with 96 scans per t, were acquired for a total experiment time of 24 h. Data were apodized using a sine bell with a 30" phase shift.
