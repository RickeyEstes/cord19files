Two groups of patients were studied. The first comprised 79 newborn and older infants and children admitted to a paediatric unit with suspected infections (table) and the second included 9 severely burned patients admitted to an intensive care unit (burn injuries 16-80% of body surface area). Blood samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 1500 g and serum was stored at -20&deg;C until analysis. Procalcitonin was measured with a monoclonal immunoradiometric assay (m-IRMA).8 This assay uses two monoclonal antibodies, one directed against residues 96-106 of procalcitonin, as the capture antibody, and one recognising residues 70-76, as the tracer antibody ( fig 1) . This assay has a detection limit of 100 pg/mL. Serum calcitonin was measured with a commercial m-IRMA (CIS Bio-International, Gif sur Yvette, France) which is specific for mature calcitonin and has a sensitivity limit of 10 pg/mL. Circulating immunoreactive forms of calcitonin were analysed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). After partial purification on a Sep-Pak cartridge, serum was injected into a C 18-Nucleosil (Macherey-Nagel, Diiren, Germany) column equilibrated with 0-1% (by volume) trifluoroacetic acid. The column was eluted at room temperature and at a flow rate of 1 mL per min with a 60 min gradient of 20-70% acetonitrile in 0-1% trifluoracetic acid.
