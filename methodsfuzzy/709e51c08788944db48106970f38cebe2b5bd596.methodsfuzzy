The size of the bioaerosol that contains viruses determines the time for which the pathogen is suspended in the air and where it deposits in the respiratory tract (La Rosa et al., 2013; Nazaroff, 2016) . Many studies have been conducted with the aim of detecting levels of viral aerosols in the air, so as to inform whether infection control strategies targeting aerosol transmission (Table 1) is needed. At present, the methods used for detection of viruses in bioaerosols include impaction, impingement, cyclone sampling, electrostatic precipitation and filtration (Ghosh, Lal, & Srivastava, 2015; Haig et al., 2016; Hinds, 2012) . The principle of impaction is to collect microorganism and particles in the air, the impaction sampler draws in air and forces to change its direction which causes particles with high inertia to get impacted over collecting surfaces (Ghosh et al., 2015; Henningson Table 2 Relative importance of aerosol, droplet and indirect contact transmission for common respiratory and enteric viruses transmitted in healthcare settings. Direct contact is not included in this table since most of the research is focused on the possibilities of transmission through these other mechanisms requiring an intermediate medium. Perceived relative importance of the different routes of transmission is indicated for each virus (+++, most important; +, least important). Other modes of transmission include bloodborne, fecal-oral, waterborne and foodborne. Summarized from the review done by La Rosa et al. (2013) & Ahlberg, 1994). The impingement methods are similar to that of impaction, except that the microorganisms are collected into a liquid medium (Ghosh et al., 2015) . Some bioaerosol samplers are available by means of impact or impact methods, which can collect a variety of viruses, such as measles virus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus (Bischoff et al., 2016; Lednicky & Loeb, 2013; Nguyen et al., 2016) , Cyclone samplers capture microorganisms in a liquid (aerosol to hydrosol) using swirling air and centrifugal force (Ghosh et al., 2015) . Grayson, Griffiths, Perez, and Piedimonte (2017) applied stationary 2-stage bioaerosol cyclone samplers to capture RSV-laden particles in a pediatric acute care setting, and their findings indicate that airborne RSV-laden particles can be detected in pediatric outpatient clinics during the epidemic peak. The electrostatic precipitation of airborne particles are mainly precipitated from an airstream by the application of an external force such as electrical force on charged particle (Knutson & Whitby, 1975) . Research by Ladhani et al. (2017) showed successful sampling and detection of airborne influenza virus using an electrostatic precipitation (ESP)-based bioaerosol sampler. In filtration methods, airborne microorganisms are collected by passing air through porous membrane filters made of glass fiber, polyvinylchloride (PVC), polycarbonate or cellulose acetate (incubated by transferring onto the surfaces of growth agar media) or gelatin (Ghosh et al., 2015) . Membrane filtration and sampling technology of virus can permit monitoring of very low viral content in air (Aintablian, Walpita, & Sawyer, 1998; Myatt, Johnston, Rudnick, & Milton, 2003) . Employing these biosamplers, recently there have been increasing studies that demonstrated viruses (including influenza, measles and RSV) can be recovered from the air in healthcare settings (Bischoff et al., 2016; Bischoff, Swett, Leng, & Peters, 2013; Blachere et al., 2009; Leung et al., 2016; Lindsley et al., 2010) .
