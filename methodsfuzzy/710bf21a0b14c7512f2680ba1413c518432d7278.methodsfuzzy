Stored frozen (270uC) fecal samples were thawed and 0.5 ml of a 10% suspension in phosphate buffered saline was prepared for each and microfuged (13,000 rpm; 15 mins) to remove solids. Each supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 nm bacterial filter, digested with nucleases [30] and virions pelleted (28,000 rpm 2 hr, Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA) before extracting the remaining viral nucleic acid fraction using the RNeasy Mini Kit system (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nucleic acids not examined immediately were stored at 270uC. DOP PCR reactions were performed incorporating a single DOP primer and biphasic PCR amplification cycles [29, 32] . Briefly, the DOP 25-mer oligonucleotide primer consists of a 39 four base anchor region which binds to both strands of any nucleic acid at approximately 250 base intervals. Adjacent to this is a six base degenerate region that provides sufficient binding homology to stabilize the primer binding at low annealing temperatures and permit priming and amplification during the first cycling phase which utilizes low annealing temperatures (30uC), slow temperature ramping and long extension times (5 minutes). In the initial replication cycles, the DOP primer 59 tag region of 15 specific bases does not participate in the binding, but as replication proceeds, this sequence becomes incorporated at the termini of the amplified product, increasing the homology of the DOP primer to its target and therefore permitting the second cycling phase which utilizes higher annealing temperatures (50uC) and fast temperature ramping. Gel analysis of the DOP amplification products was uninformative, revealing only a DNA smear. To monitor amplification efficiency, an adenovirus positive fecal sample was included in each batch of samples being amplified. If a 10 4 or greater increase in adenovirus genome copies was detected in this sample, measured by a adenovirus-specific real-time PCR (unpublished), then the DOP-amplified products from the remaining samples in the batch were individually cloned without gel analysis into pCR TopoTA 4.0 vector and transformed into One Shot Topo10 competent cells (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) according to manufacturer's instructions. Using sterile toothpicks, bacterial colonies were picked directly into PCR mix (25 ml) containing 16 GeneAmp PCR buffer (Applied Biosystems Inc [ABI], Foster City, USA), 2 mM MgCl 2 (ABI), 0.2 mM dNTPs (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), 1.25 U AmpliTaq Gold (ABI), and M13 universal forward and reverse primers (50 pmol each, Invitrogen) to amplify the DNA inserts. PCR products were assessed by gel electrophoresis and reactions containing single DOP amplicons of length greater than 250 nucleotides were sequenced with BigDye 3 terminator chemistry (ABI) using an ABI 3730 sequencing analyzer. Agencourt AMPure and Agencourt CleanSEQ (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Beverly, USA) were used to clean the PCR products before and after the sequencing reactions, respectively. A univariant analysis was performed on age-matched case and control pairs using McNemar's test for correlated proportions. A multivariant matched analysis was performed using conditional logistic regression. Calculations were carried out in VassarStats (R. Lowry Vassarstats, http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/VassarStats. html, Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, USA) and Stata version 9 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).
