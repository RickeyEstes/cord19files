Halo assays were performed on MCD plates with a tester MA Ta sst2 strain as described previously (Nishikawa and Nakano, 1993) . Four to ten independent spots were examined to quantify the amount of a-factor secreted. Expression levels of various chimeras were always analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies against Sec12p, Dap2p, or a-factor. In the case of a-factor fusions, the density of each band was evaluated by scanning and used to normalize the secretion of a-factor.
