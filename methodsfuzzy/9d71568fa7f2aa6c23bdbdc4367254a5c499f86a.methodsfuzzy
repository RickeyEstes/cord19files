Lung tissues obtained from a limited autopsy were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and paraffin embedded. Tissue sections were stained by routine hematoxylin and eosin for histopathologic evaluation. Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described [14] by using a colorimetric indirect immunoalkaline phosphatase method with a hyperimmune mouse anti-SARS-CoV ascitic fluid. Negative controls included Vero E6 cells infected with human coronavirus OC43, Vero E6 cells infected with human coronavirus 229E, noninfected Vero cells, and tissues from non-SARS cases. Normal mouse antiserum was used as a negative control antibody. Doublestain IHC was performed by using peroxidase polymer (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA)-labeled antibodies against cytokeratin, surfactant, or CD68 (DAKO), followed by the mouse anti-SARS-CoV antibody labeled with immunoalkaline phosphatase polymer. A colorimetric ISH was performed as previously described [14] . Briefly, negative-sense digoxin-labeled riboprobes were generated from PCR products amplified from the nucleocapsid (N) (625 bases in length) or polymerase (Pol) (325 bases in length) regions of the SARS-CoV genome and tailed with the T7 promoter. Tissue sections were incubated with a pool of N and Pol probes. Specimens for EM were excised from paraffin-embedded blocks of lung in areas corresponding to positive IHC and ISH results. Tissues were deparaffinized in xylene and embedded for EM as previously described [13] . Immunogold labeling assays used the same mouse anti-SARS-CoV antibody as IHC experiments, and the antibody was detected by using goat antimouse conjugated to 12-nm colloidal gold.
