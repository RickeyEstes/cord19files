Upon arrival in the lab, BAL-samples were processed for smear, bacterial culture, viral culture, and for the detection of influenzavirus A and B; parainfluenzavirus types 1, 2, 3; RSV; human metapneumovirus subtypes A and B; coronaviruses 229E and OC43, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae using an in-house multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (mPCR)-protocol, as described previously [13] . The performance of this test was assessed by regular participation in the external quality programme organised by QCMD (West of Scotland Science Park Glasgow G20 0XA Scotland, UK). Gram staining of smear and bacterial BAL-culture were performed according to standard methods [14, 15] . 70 μL of BAL-fluid was centrifugated on a cytospin slide and Gram stained. Samples were considered representative of the lower airways, if >40 % of instilled volume was recovered and if < 1 % of nucleated cells are squamous epithelial cells on smear. Undiluted and 1 μL of a 1/1000 dilution of BAL-fluid were inoculated on blood agar supplemented with X and V factors incubated at 35°C in 5 % CO 2 , MacConkey agar and mannitol salt agar incubated at 35°C in air. Growth was assessed after 24 h, and after 48 h in case of no growth at 24 h. Results were reported in semi-quantitative terms, with a growth of potential pathogens of ≥10 4 cfu/ml considered significant. All H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae isolates were sent to the respective Belgian reference lab for capsular typing as described elsewhere [13] . All NTHi isolates were discriminated from nonhaemolytic Haemophilus haemolyticus (non-haemolytic H. haemolyticus) using molecular techniques [13] . Cytology BAL-fluid was transported to the laboratory in a siliconized container on ice. The fluid was filtered through nylon gauze. After staining with brilliant cresyl blue, total nuclear cell counts were performed in a Bürker counting chamber under light microscopy at a magnification of 250x. A cell suspension of 2.10 6 cells/ μl was made in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 % bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA). Cytocentrifuge preparations were made and stained by May-Grünwald Giemsa. Two hundred cells were examined for differential cell counts. Given that the median percentage of neutrophils in BAL-fluid of healthy children is 0.9-3.5 %, we chose to base our definition for neutrophilic inflammation in BAL-fluid on presence of >10 % neutrophils in the cytological differentiation, as previously done by Saito et al. [10, 12] .
