This study was conducted at the National Center for Child Health and Development, a pediatric tertiary care hospital in Tokyo, Japan. We performed a retrospective chart review of all the patients in whom influenza was diagnosed. We included patients under the age of 18 years who were hospitalized for influenza-related LRI between December 2015 and April 2016. Patients hospitalized for acute encephalopathy, febrile seizure, febrile delirium or croup were excluded. Clinical information including age, gender, underlying disease, past medical history, immunization history, clinical course, and prognosis was collected from patients' medical records. Underlying diseases were classified as allergic (asthma or food allergy), neurological, cardiac, renal, hepatic, or immunological. Patients with primary immunodeficiency and those receiving immunosuppressive agents were included. Each condition was counted separately in patients with multiple conditions.
