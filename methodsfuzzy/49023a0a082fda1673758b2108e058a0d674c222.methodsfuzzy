The research on which this paper is based was undertaken during the summer of 2003 in and around the city of Yogyakarta, on the Indonesian island of Java. The author already had pre-knowledge of the site, because he visited the region in the summer of 2000. The methodology used involves a hybrid qualitative and ethnographic approach that has been characterized as ''fast and dirty'' (Hampton 2003:88; Hitchcock 2000:206) . The method can also be described as ''pre-fieldwork'' (Michaud 1995:682) since it involves a visit lasting only ten weeks, as opposed to ethnographic fieldwork which is usually conducted over a much longer period. Background literature research was undertaken in the libraries of Gadjah Mada University, Sanata Dharma University, and the Stuppa Indonesia Foundation for Tourism Research and Development. Secondary sources such as websites and Indonesian newspapers (Bernas, Kedaulatan Rakyat, Kompas, and The Jakarta Post) and magazines (Tempo, Inside Indonesia, and Latitudes), were also consulted. This study forms part of a larger, multi-sited comparative project, involving similar research with a group of tour guides in Arusha, Tanzania. The groups of guides in both Yogyakarta and Arusha are linked to a loosely organized transnational network of ''Traveler's Bars'' (a pseudonym), with other branches in Senegal, Mali, Nepal, Honduras, Nicaragua, Argentina, Belgium, and Spain. The bars of Yogyakarta and Arusha became operational in 1995 and 2000, respectively. Of the whole network, only the guides working for these two bars have had a chance to meet one another in person (giving the researcher an exceptional opportunity to study more aspects of glocalization). They were invited by the European section of the network for a onemonth visit in the spring of 2002. During this period, they underwent an intense two-week experience as international tourists in Western Europe-a kind of role reversal exercise-and also participated in a two-week interactive course on guiding and intercultural communication. It should be noted that not many guides in Indonesia or Tanzania are offered this kind of opportunity, which makes the group studied very unique. An indepth comparison between the two groups lies outside the scope of this paper. Future research will entail long-term return visits to both sites and an ethnographic study of the Traveler's Bar administrative headquarters in Europe. As the research in Indonesia took place during the height of the tourism season, the researcher had multiple opportunities to engage in participatory observation and interviewing. Throughout his stay, he observed the daily activities of the five guides contracted by the Yogyakarta Traveler's Bar. His daily presence in and around the bar made it easy to integrate and be accepted by the group of guides.
