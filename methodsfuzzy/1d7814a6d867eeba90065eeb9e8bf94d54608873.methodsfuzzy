Currently, about 35% of the plasma fractionated in the world is obtained by centrifugation of whole blood (brecoveredQ plasma), and 65% is obtained by apheresis. Blood/plasma collection, processing, and storage may affect plasma quality, as well as having an impact on the recovery of the most labile proteins such as FVIII. In particular, risks of activation of the coagulation, complement, and fibrinolytic systems, which may lead to generation of plasma proteases, should be avoided. To better preserve the integrity of recovered plasma and limit risks of activation of the coagulation cascade and of cellular components, (a) good mixing of the blood with the anticoagulant solution (a sodium citrate based solution 1 ) should be ensured from the initiation till the end of the collection process; (b) the duration of the collection should not exceed 15 minutes; and (c) temperature variations of the blood should be avoided. A few hours after donation, whole blood is subjected to a centrifugation that separates the cellular elements (most specifically red cells) from plasma. The mean plasma volume obtained from one whole blood donation is about 220 mL but varies depending upon the volume of collected whole blood (most often 400-450 mL) and donor's hematocrit. Apheresis plasma (also called bsource plasmaQ) is collected from donors through a process where blood is removed from the donor, anticoagulated (generally with a 4% sodium citrate solution), 1 and immediately separated by physical means (centrifugation or filtration, or a combination of both) into components. 3 At minimum, the red cells are returned to the donor while plasma is retained and collected in a container (bag or plastic bottle). The duration of a typical plasmapheresis procedure depends on the number of cycles (and, hence, the volume of plasma collected) and lasts generally from 35 to 70 minutes. Apheresis plasma volume may range from 450 to 880 mL, depending upon the country's regulations and collection protocol. Apheresis plasma can also be prepared as a byproduct of plateletpheresis (bconcurrent plasmaQ), a procedure used primarily for the collection of platelets. Both recovered and apheresis plasmas are suitable for the manufacture of the whole range of fractionated plasma products. The mean content in coagulation factors, more particularly FVIII, is lower in recovered than in apheresis plasma because of (a) longer processing time before freezing (whole blood must be further processed to separate cellular components and plasma), (b) higher ratio of anticoagulant and, possibly, (c) the higher level of cellular contamination that may release proteolytic enzymes affecting the stability of coagulation factors. Apheresis plasma contains less IgG when collected from frequent donors. Protein content and quality of fractionated proteins is apparently not affected by the apheresis system used, although residual cell content differ based upon the type and configuration of the cell separation device. 4 Plasma from membrane apheresis procedures, as does recovered plasma prepared from whole blood leukoreduced on positively charged filters, may 4Performed by most fractionators. yMandatory in Europe for HCV. zMay contribute to viral clearance but does not necessarily result in robust and consistent removal. Â§For small viruses, robust removal is achieved by narrow pore size membranes (V20 nm). tExpected contribution based on experimental studies using spiked TSE agents, in the absence of information of the biological nature of the TSE-human plasma associated agent. contain more activated complement component 3 and 5 (C3a, C5a) anaphylatoxins, 5-7 but the impact on the quality or yield of fractionated products is unknown. No documented transmission of HIV, HBV, or HCV by products subjected to dedicated viral inactivation treatments has been recorded since the end of the 1980s. 19 Viral reduction treatments include inactivation steps (where viruses are bkilledQ) and removal steps (where viruses and proteins partition into distinct fractions). Use of one, or preferably two, distinct dedicated viral reduction treatments is the current bgold standardQ for all plasma products. The first treatment is performed primarily to inactivate the most pathogenic viruses (HIV, HBV, and HCV), whereas the second reduction step targets nonenveloped viruses but also contributes to added safety against all agents. Most viral reduction treatments are integrated with the protein fractionation process (bin-processQ treatments), but some currently based on heat inactivation procedures are applied on products filled in their final container (terminal treatment). Fractionators are required by regulatory authorities to conduct down-scale experimental validation studies using relevant model viruses to establish the efficacy and robustness of viral reduction procedures. The robustness of the viral reduction procedures in place is exemplified by the absence of transmission of WNV, an emerging virus. 20 Similarly, the lipid-enveloped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has been shown to be inactivated by core viral inactivation treatments of plasma products. 21,22 It is also likely, but not proven by validation experiments yet, that avian flu and simian foamy viruses, which also have a lipid envelope, would be inactivated by current processes in place if present in plasma. Details on viral validation procedures can be found elsewhere. 23, 24 The major characteristics of current viral reduction treatments are summarized in Table 3 9,23 and discussed briefly here. In-process viral inactivation treatments. The solvent-detergent (SD) treatment, developed in the mid 1980s, 25 remains the most frequent core viral inactivation procedure of plasma products. Protein solutions are incubated for 4 to 6 hours at 248C to 378C in the presence of 0.3% to 1% Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP) and 1% Tween-80 or Triton X-100. Typically, lipid enveloped viruses are inacti-vated in a matter of minutes, and the functional activity of even the most labile plasma proteinswith the possible exception of some serine prolease inhibitors-is well preserved, but nonenveloped viruses (less pathogenic in most individuals) are not inactivated. The SD agents are removed down to a level of a few parts per million usually by chromatographic adsorption or specific precipitation of proteins, or selective adsorption on hydrophobic chromatographic support. Pasteurization, another common viral inactivation procedure, is a heat treatment of protein solutions for 10 hours at 608C, a treatment that denatures viral proteins and inhibits virus replication. 26 Pasteurization can inactivate both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, but stabilizers, needed to limit loss of protein functionality, may decrease the rate and extent of viral inactivation. 27 Stabilizers may be removed by ultrafiltration, protein precipitation, or chromatography. Vapor heat has also been used by one company; extent of virus inactivation is influenced by the temperature, duration, and pressure during treatment. Risk of neoantigen formation, which can enhance protein immunogenicity, should be considered when using heat-based inactivation processes. Low pH incubation, usually at pH 4, at 308C to 378C for more than 20 hours, was introduced in the early 1980s to allow the intravenous infusion of IgG. This form of treatment was subsequently found to inactivate most lipid-enveloped viruses. Caprylic (octanoic) acid precipitation/incubation at pH below 6 is a recently introduced treatment of human IgG that can inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses. 28, 29 Terminal viral inactivation treatments. In modern plasma fractionation, heat treatment of lyophilized products (dry heat) is used, due to limitations, mostly as a secondary viral inactivation step rather than the core inactivation treatment. The treatment is applied to some coagulation factor concentrates. Performed at 808C for 72 hours or at 1008C for 30 minutes, generally in the presence of protein stabilizers, it provides added safety against HAVand other heat-sensitive viruses but may not be sufficient to exclude B19 transmission. 23 Terminal (liquid) pasteurization at 608C for 10 hours is the bgold standardQ treatment of albumin preparations. The fatty acids, caprylate, and tryptophanate, which protect albumin from heat denaturation, are added at doses compatible with therapeutic use and, therefore, are not removed before product infusion. Viral removal treatment. Nanofiltration is a specific viral filtration process applied to protein solutions using 15-to 75-nm multi-layers membranes, or equivalent systems, to remove viruses mostly by a sieving mechanism. 30,31 Introduced in the early to mid 1990s, it has reached wide acceptance as a robust viral removal step for essentially all products, apart from albumin. Nanofiltration is used to complement the core viral inactivation treatment and to provide enhanced safety against nonenveloped viruses or other resistant infectious agents. Virus removal can also incidentally take place during protein precipitation, chromatography, or filtration steps; these steps contribute to the lowering of virus load from the protein production stream; they are difficult to monitor; and therefore do not guarantee, as standalone procedures, sufficient safety margin. Prion removal methods. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) can be transmitted by red blood cell concentrates, but to date, transmission has not been identified from plasma or plasma products. Because of its biological nature, the prion agent is thought to be resistant to current viral inactivation procedures used during plasma fractionation. The methods known to inactivate abnormal misfolded prion proteins associated with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (PrP TSE ) (such as oxidation, treatment with strong base, chaotropic agents, and extreme heat) destroy plasma proteins and, therefore, cannot be used. Still, modern processes of fractionated products would seem to ensure significant removal of PrP TSE , as suggested by experimental spiking studies. 32 As scale-down and experimental transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) spiking models are developed, knowledge on the capacity of manufacturing processes of plasma proteins to remove prions is growing rapidly, although much uncertainty remains because the unknown biological nature of the human plasma associated infectious agent. 33 Several processes for manufacturing FVIII, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor (VWF), FIX, IgG, and albumin products have been shown to be capable of removing prions in a consistent and reproducible manner. [34] [35] [36] Generally, multistep fractionation processes are thought to be a contributing factor to PrP TSE elimination. Two to more than 5 log removals of spiked prions occur during standard protein purification steps such as precipitation with ethanol or polyethylene glycol (PEG), anion-exchange chromatography, and depth filtration. 34, 35, 37 Mechanism of removal that may encompass an adsorption mechanism is still not fully understood and appears to be influenced by pH and the concentration of the precipitating agent. The partitioning process may reflect some prion aggregation because of prion hydrophobicity and insolubility. The removal capacity of nanofiltration membranes with pore sizes less than 75 or 35 nm has been extensively investigated, 34, 38 and prion removal is likely due in part to molecular sieving. Extent of removal is related to the pore size of the filters and, presumably, to the aggregation state of PrP TSE . Removal is superior with membrane of pore sizes of 15 nm, compared to 35 nm. The nature and origin of the spiking agent used for PrP TSE clearance studies is of critical importance because various spikes differ in size and characteristics. Brain homogenate or brain-derived microsomal fractions from infected animals have usually been used as the source of PrP TSE spiking material. The most reliable and quantitative detection method of PrP TSE is based on animal bioassays, which require many animals and a time frame generally longer than 9 months. In vitro immunochemical methods, such as a Western blot assay, are being used, at least as a first marker of the presence of PrP TSE and associated infectivity, by detecting the protease-resistant fragment. 33 Thus, the risk transmission of vCJD by human plasma products appears remote, but caution should prevail since the biochemical nature of the infectious agent in human blood is not known.
