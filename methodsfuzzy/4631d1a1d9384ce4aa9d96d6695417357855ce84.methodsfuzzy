As shown in Fig. 4a , households in the community, universities, hospitals, community health centres and schools (primary or secondary) were the most common settings for MHL studies in China during 1997-2018, although this differed between surveys and interventions. Specifically, surveys were more likely to happen in the community (30.1%) or universities (29.8%), whereas interventions were predominantly conducted in hospitals (40.5%) or community health centres (27.0%). Accordingly, community-based residents and university students (medical or non-medical) were the most common participants in MHL surveys, while patients with mental disorders, carers and health professionals were more common participants in MHL-related interventions. Workplaces, mostly civil services, were mentioned as study settings in a few surveys, but not in any interventions. Taking surveys and interventions together, the most common participants in MHL research in China were university students (n = 101, of which 64 were non-medical and 37 medical), community-based residents (n = 83), health professionals at the community level (i.e. GPs, n = 32) and carers of patients with mental disorders (n = 30), followed by patients with mental disorders (n = 25), primary/secondary school students (n = 24) and health professionals in general hospitals (n = 13) (Fig. 4b) . Figure 5 demonstrates the frequency of different MHL domains assessed by study population. For lay people (community residents, university students and other groups of lay people), knowledge and beliefs were the two most highly examined components. Assessment of knowledge was mostly targeted to mental health broadly, rather than to specific disorders. The emphasis was on knowledge of typical symptoms and recognition of common mental disorders, as well as health service availability, the mental health law or legal rights of patients. Questions about treatment beliefs mainly involved the effectiveness of professional treatments/antipsychotic medication, self-help and help-seeking intentions. Other questions covered causes and risk factors.
