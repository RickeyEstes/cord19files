To identify Australian media coverage of issues surrounding the emergence of Hendra virus, the database Factiva was searched using the following terms as textwords: (Hendra virus) or (flying fox*) or (fruit bat*) for the period 1 January 2007 through 31 December 2011. A News Filter limiting content to the region of Australia was then applied identifying more than 10,000 items. Because we were focussing on representations of Hendra and associated public policy, further Subject Filters were applied to restrict the sample to Political and General News, limiting the corpus to just over 6000 articles. Full-text reports from 9 news media sources from areas affected by Hendra virus outbreaks were then downloaded. The sample includes 2 national media organizations . Pretesting confirmed that this search strategy would produce a larger and more heterogeneous sample of news reports, while still including coverage that focussed more narrowly on specific zoonotic events. From the resulting corpus of 1383 articles we discarded 43 duplicates and 356 reports that were not immediately relevant to Hendra virus or flying fox populations (such as those that refer to the zip-line apparatus known as a 'flying-fox' or businesses or products with 'flying fox' in the title), after which 984 unique articles remained to be analysed. The media sample was then read, catalogued manually, and cross-compared by the lead author in order to identify and track prominent concepts, differences, and themes. Next, both authors manually cross-coded a pilot sample (n Â¼ 40) of the media corpus for specific types of content to confirm and to extend the preliminary thematic analysis. Articles then were coded for: mention of horses, flying foxes/fruit bats or Hendra virus mention of debates about flying fox control report of distal ecological causes (loss of natural habitat) for the emergence of Hendra virus or the possibility of viral mutation mention of ignorance about Hendra virus amongst scientists, healthcare providers or members of the public reference to government inaction as a factor contributing to the Hendra problem reference to people's health and welfare not being high enough on the political agenda. These codes were both emergent and informed by similar media analyses (for example Gollust & Lantz, 2009; Washer, 2004) . Because Hendra events tend to occur seasonally (from winterspring), the calendar year was chosen as the unit of analysis. The results from coding were then tabulated in matrix form, cross referenced and displayed visually as descriptive statistics in charts to aid interpretation. Regular discussions among the authors served to generate additional enquires and to validate insights as they emerged. This approach is consistent with ethnographic content analysis, a qualitative research method for interpreting documents within the context of their use, which enables researchers to generate insights about how documents promote particular ways of understanding, interpreting and responding to an issue or event such as the emergence of a new disease from both numerical and narrative data (Altheide, 1987) . With these concepts and types of content in mind, our analysis of the 984 articles proceeded through several cycles of immersion and crystallization of insights e a research process comprised of repeated readings and comparisons across and between newssources, discussions amongst the authors, periods of testing of alternate explanations, and then re-immersion within the research materials (LeCompte & Schensul, 1999) .
