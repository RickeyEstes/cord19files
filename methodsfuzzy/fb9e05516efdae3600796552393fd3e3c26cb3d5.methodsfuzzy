This study was carried out retrospectively at a single peritoneal dialysis (PD) center of Changhua Christian Hospital in Taiwan. From 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2014, patients who started CAPD as renal replacement therapy for ESRD were screened for this study. The enrollment criteria included incident patients of at least 18 years of age who had survived on CAPD for at least 3 months. Eligible patients were followed up from the date of commencing CAPD and the end of the study was on 31 December 2015 when the clinical outcomes were censored. CVD and infection were the two leading causes of death in our patients. Therefore, the primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality, and the second outcomes of interest were CV and infection-associated mortality. CV mortality was defined if a death was attributed to any of the following cardiovascular events: coronary events, cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysrhythmia, sudden cardiac death, congestive heart failure, ischemic brain injury, cerebrovascular accident and peripheral vascular disease. Infection was the cause of death if a patient directly died from sepsis. The cause of death was determined by reviewing the discharge diagnosis and hospitalization summary in electronic medical records. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of our hospital, and the study was conducted in compliance with the declaration of Helsinki. Baseline characteristics of the whole cohort were obtained from the hospital's electronic database. Demographic and clinical data were recorded at the initiation of PD, and included age, sex, status before PD (pre-dialysis CKD, hemodialysis, and failed renal transplantation), body mass index (BMI), medications, comorbidities, and smoking status. The comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, CVD and Charlson Comorbidity Index, which is one of the most commonly used scoring systems to predict the risk of mortality. Blood tests, consisting of white blood cell (WBC) counts, hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphate (ALP), uric acid, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine were checked at the laboratory of Changhua Christian Hospital. The use of medications was recorded based on prescriptions, and included angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), hypouricemic agent (allopurinol), erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA), loop diuretic (furosemide), calcium channel blocker (CCB), vitamin D, and statins. Information on PD-related parameters included daily ultrafiltration, total Kt/V urea, residual renal function (RRF), daily urine volume, normalized protein nitrogen appearance (nPNA) and dialysate-to-plasma creatinine ratio (D/P creatinine) at 4 h. RRF, in milliliters per minute per 1.73 m 2 , was derived from averaging the values of creatinine and urea clearance and standardized for body surface area.
