Cell culture, plasmids, and reagents. Vero E6, Huh-7, 293T, and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and Calu-3 2B4 cells (Kent Tseng, University of Texas Medical Branch) were grown in MEM supplemented with 20% FBS as previously described (41) . Codon-optimized sMacro (nucleotides 3262 to 3783 of SARS-CoV MA15) and MERS-CoV ORF4a were synthesized and cloned into pUC57 (GenScript). The sMacro and GFP sequences were PCR amplified and ligated into a linearized pcDNA3 plasmid using In-Fusion (Invitrogen) cloning. The ORF4a sequence was PCR amplified and then restriction digested and ligated into the pLKO plasmid. The resulting constructs were confirmed by restriction Generation of recombinant pBAC-MA15 constructs. All recombinant pBAC-MA15 constructs were created using Red recombination (see primers in Table S1 in the supplemental material). The recombinant BAC with the N1040A mutation (AA3382-3383GC) was engineered using a GalK/kanamycin dual marker cassette that was previously described (34, 56) . Additional BACs with point mutations in the nsp3 macrodomain were engineered using the Kan r -I-SceI marker cassette for dual positive and negative selection as previously described (27, 33) . Final BAC DNA constructs were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion, PCR, and direct sequencing for isolation of correct clones. Reconstitution of recombinant pBAC-MA15-derived virus. All work with MA15 virus was conducted in the University of Iowa biosafety level 3 (BSL3) Laboratory Core Facility. Approximately 10 6 Vero E6 cells were transfected with 1 g of pBAC-MA15 DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Fisher Scientific) as a transfection reagent. Two separate bacterial clones were used for the N1040A mutation. Viral plaques were evident by 72 to 96 h after transfection. Then, recombinant virus underwent 2 rounds of plaque purification followed by 2 amplification steps prior to its use. The resulting BAC-derived recombinant viruses used in this study are listed in Table S1 . Virus infection. Vero-E6 or Calu-3 2B4 cells were infected at the indicated MOIs. Infected cells and supernatants were collected, and titers were determined on Vero E6 cells. Mice were lightly anesthetized using isoflurane and were intranasally infected with 3 ϫ 10 4 PFU in 50 l DMEM. To obtain tissue for virus titers, mice were euthanized at different days postchallenge, lungs were removed and homogenized in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), and titers were determined on Vero E6 cells. Virus titers are represented as numbers of PFU/lung. Two separate clones of the N1040A virus were used in independent experiments. Immunoblotting. Total cell extracts were lysed in sample buffer containing SDS, protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), ␤-mercaptoethanol, and a universal nuclease (Fisher Scientific). Proteins were resolved on an SDS polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, hybridized with a primary antibody, reacted with an infrared (IR) dye-conjugated secondary antibody, visualized using a Li-COR Odyssey Imager (Li-COR, Lincoln, NE), and analyzed using Image Studio software. Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting included anti-N polyclonal antibody (IMG548; Imgenex, San Diego, CA); anti-SARS nsp3 polyclonal antibody (kindly provided by Mark Denison, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN); and antiactin monoclonal antibody (clone AC15; Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA). Secondary IR antibodies were purchased from Li-COR. Immunofluorescence. To analyze intracellular protein localization by immunofluorescence, cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, blocked with 1% goat serum-PBS, incubated with anti-SARS nsp3 polyclonal antibody in blocking buffer, and subsequently labeled with secondary antibody. Labeled cells were counterstained with TO-PRO-3 (Fisher Scientific) to visualize the nuclei and then mounted on slides with Vectashield antifade reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Im-ages were captured using a Leica STED SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope, and images were analyzed using LAS X software. Lung cell preparation. Lung cells were prepared as previously described (37) . Flow cytometry. For surface staining, cells derived from the lungs were treated with Fc block (CD16/32, 2.4G2) and then incubated with specific MAbs or isotype controls. The monoclonal antibodies used for these studies, CD45-PECy7/FITC (30-F11), CD11b-Percp-Cy5. 5 Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis. RNA was isolated from tissue culture cells or from perfused lung homogenates using Trizol (Fisher Scientific) and treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI), and cDNA was prepared using Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). RT-qPCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7300 realtime PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and RT 2 2ϫ SYBR green qPCR master mix (Qiagen). Primers used for qPCR are listed in Table S2 . Cycle threshold (C T ) values were normalized to those of the housekeeping gene encoding hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) by the following equation: ⌬C T ϭ C T(gene of interest) Ϫ C T(HPRT) . All results are shown as a ratio to HPRT calculated as Ϫ2 ⌬CT . Lung histology and immunohistochemistry. Lungs were removed, fixed in zinc formalin, and paraffin embedded. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined by light microscopy. For immunohistochemical staining of tissues, 10% formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung sections (6 to 7 m in thickness) were microwaved in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 5 min. Endogenous peroxidase was inactivated with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) at room temperature for 10 min. Sections were then incubated (overnight at 4°C) with rabbit anti-N protein (IMG548; Imgenex, San Diego, CA) (1:1,000). Secondary labeling with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) was performed at room temperature for 1 h, followed by color development with 3,3=-diaminobenzidine for 3 min. Protein expression and purification. SARS-CoV macrodomains were expressed and purified as described previously, with minor adjustments (57) . Briefly, C41 (DE3) cells carrying pET vector encoding SARS-CoV macrodomain or point mutants were grown in TB media to an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) of~0.6, and the cultures were cooled to 16°C and induced with 50 M IPTG (isopropyl-␤-D-thiogalactopyranoside) for 20 h. Harvested pellets were stored at Ϫ80°C until purification. The pellets were lysed with 1ϫ BugBuster reagent-50 mM Tris (pH 7.6)-150 mM NaCl-15 mM imidazole supplemented with lysozyme, Benzonase, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were subjected to nickelnitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin. Proteins were eluted using 50 mM Tris (pH 7.6)-150 mM NaCl-300 mM imidazole, dialyzed to 25 mM Tris (pH 7.6)-150 mM NaCl-1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at Ϫ80°C. ARTD10 de-ADP-ribosylation assay. ARTD10 de-ADP-ribosylation assays were performed as described previously (16, 23) . Briefly, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ARTD10 catalytic domain (cd) was bound to glutathione Sepharose beads in reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.2], 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM DTT, 0.02% NP-40). A 15-l volume of bead slurry per reaction was used with 7.5 l of~0.5 mg/ml GST-ARTD10cd. The beads were washed with reaction buffer, and an automodification reaction was performed at 37°C for 20 min with 5 to 10 kBq 32 P-labeled NAD ϩ per reaction, at a final NAD ϩ concentration of 1 M. The beads were washed with reaction buffer and incubated with 0.5 M SARS-CoV macrodomains at 37°C for 30 min. Reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE, subjected to Coomassie staining, dried, and exposed to autoradiography films. The films were quantified using ImageJ. Statistics. A Student's t test was used to analyze differences in mean values between groups. All results are expressed as means Ϯ standard errors of the means (SEM). Differences in survival were calculated using a Kaplan-Meier log-rank test. P values of Յ0.05 were considered statistically significant (*, P Ͻ 0.05; ** P Ͻ 0.01; *** P Ͻ 0.001; n.s., not significant).
