Between January 2018 and May 2018, fecal samples from dogs (n = 1111) and cats (n = 203) were submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in the city of Medellin. The samples were taken directly from the rectum or from already expelled feces and analyzed within 24 h. Additional data recorded from the submission forms (when available) included age, gender and presence of diarrhea. All samples were analyzed with three diagnostic tests: fecal smears (with lugol staining), flotation with saturated sucrose solution (sG1.3; 2 g of sample) and flotation with zinc sulphate solution (sG 1.2; 2 g of sample) (Deplazes et al., 2016) . The first two techniques are currently the most commonly used as routine procedures in Colombian diagnostic laboratories. The sample was considered positive if at least one test was positive. Morphological keys were used to identify the type of helminth eggs, protozoan cysts, and yeast cells (Jacobs et al., 2016) . Fig. 1 shows images taken from cases for the most common parasites found in this study. For the purpose of examination, a possible relationship between age and the presence or absence of parasitism, dogs were classified as: puppies (< 6 months), and adults (1.1 to > 7 y). Cats were categorized as kittens (0-6 months) and adults (6 m -11 y).
