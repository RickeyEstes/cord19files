Order pair directed graph A directed graph G = (V, E) is a graph which consists of a set of vertices denoted by V = {V 1 , V 2 , . . ., V i }, and a set of connected edges denoted by E = {E 1,1 , E 1,2 , . . ., E i, j } where an edge E i, j exists if the corresponding two vertices V i and V j are connected and the direction of edge is from the vertex V i to the vertex V j . From the graph, various graph theoretic properties like edge connectivity, cycles, graph isomorphism etc. can be investigated to differentiate the graphs. Given an arbitrary amino acids sequence, it is first transformed into the numerical sequence as described previously where amino acids are categorized into eight chemical groups according to the side chain/chemical nature of the amino acids [17] . The transformation is done using the following rules (Eq 1) as per the classification. If a particular amino acid is read as A i , then the corresponding transformed group is G k and the numerical value k is defined by the following Eq (1). : ifA i 2 fD; Eg Here, G 1 , G 2 , . . ., G 8 are the Acidic, Basic, Aliphatic, Aromatic, Cyclic, Sulfur Containing, Hydroxyl Containing and Acidic Amide groups respectively [17] . The eight numerical values are considered as the vertices of the graph G i.e. V i 2 {1, 2, . . .8}. Algorithm 1 is used to generate the directed graph from the primary protein sequence using MATLAB16b software. Here, we obtain the graph which is the order pair digraph because an edge is constructed through the pair (source node, target node) which is obtained from the consecutive order pair list of amino acids in the primary protein sequence. So given an arbitrary amino acid sequence, we can find an order pair directed graph having at most eight vertices/nodes.
