Water samples were collected (2004e2010) on a bi-weekly basis beginning April to May until late November (Wilkes et al., 2011) . Samples were collected at RCA in (serving as a baseline of water quality input into the restricted cattle access experimental region), RCA out /URCA in (representing the water quality output from the RCA experimental region, and also serving as a baseline of water quality input into the unrestricted cattle access region), at a midpoint of the URCA region (URCA mid ), and finally at the output of the URCA region (URCA out ) (Fig. 1 ). Water quality data collected at these sample sites were divided into two groups: Group 1) Temporally Concurrent Data: data collected concurrently (in synchrony, on the same day) from 2005 to 2010 at RCA in ; RCA out /URCA in ; and URCA out for bacteria, virus, and coliphage, plus data collected from 2005 to 2010 concurrently at RCA in ; URCA out for parasites (due to limited concurrent samples for parasites at output of RCA and input to URCA (RCA out /URCA in ) this data was excluded in the temporally concurrent grouping); and Group 2) All Available Data: all data collected at each monitoring site from 2004 to 2010 including URCA mid irrespective of temporal concurrence of sampling (i.e., one site may have more data support than another depending on the microorganism). Water sampling, hydrological monitoring, and microbiological analysis (pathogenic bacteria, fecal indicator bacteria, coliphage, Giardia and Cryptosporidium (oo)cyst densities) approaches have been provided in other companion papers (Wilkes et al., 2009; Sunohara et al., 2012) , with the exception of Aeromonas. Aeromonas (monitoring began in 2009) was processed and enumerated following USEPA Method 1605 (USEPA, 2001) and Havelaar et al. (1987) . Cryptosporidium were enumerated, sequenced, and genotyped using phylogenetic analysis . For group A rotavirus, hepatitis E virus, and norovirus GII, 500 mL of water were processed in accordance with the OPFLP-04 standard method for the recovery and concentration of viruses present in artificially and naturally contaminated water following Health Canada's compendium of analytical methods (Brassard et al., 2005 (Brassard et al., , 2007 ; see Supp. Table 1 for  detection limits for viruses and other microbiological targets) . Negative controls (experimental assay with a non-inoculated water sample as a negative control) were included and processed following the same method applied for virus detection. Viral nucleic acids were extracted using the QIAamp RNA Viral Mini Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Real-time TaqMan RT-PCR and PCR assays for the detection of norovirus GII and hepatitis E virus, rotavirus, and feline calicivirus (as sample process control) were performed in 25 mL with the 1-step Brillant II QRT-PCR core reagent kit for RNA viruses (Agilent Technologies Canada, Mississauga, ON) and the amplification conditions were carried out according to previously described procedures (Kageyama et al., 2003; Zeng et al., 2008; Ward et al., 2009) . Stream discharge at the RCA in was monitored using a 4150 Area-Velocity Flow Logger (Teledyne Isco, Inc.) and a lowprofile area-velocity sensor; an area-velocity calculation was applied to determine stream discharge as described by Sunohara et al. (2012) . Due to there being no fixed structure at the RCA out /URCA in and the other downstream sites, we linearly scaled discharge at these sites by applying a proportional amount of discharge based on its contributing area relative to that of RCA in (as the distance between the RCA out and the downstream sites was relatively small); results were verified independently by discharge measurements made by Flow Probe (Global Water Instrumentation, Gold River, CA). Discharge was then grouped based on specific flow conditions measured at the RCA in using percentile classes. Discharge greater than 0.018 m 3 s À1 was considered "high flow" (defined as the 75th percentile for discharge measurements), discharge between 0.002 and 0.018 m 3 s À1 (defined as discharge between the 25th and 75th percentiles) was considered "low flow," and discharge <0.002 m 3 s À1 (defined as discharge less than the 25th percentile) was considered "no flow."
