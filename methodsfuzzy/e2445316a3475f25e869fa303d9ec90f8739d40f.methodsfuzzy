Computational methods. In this work, several computational methods were employed to target GP2, which can be arranged into five distinct protocols: (i) GP2 binding site and reference ligand designation through hot-spot identification, (ii) receptor and reference preparation, (iii) DOCK receptor setup, (iv) DOCK virtual screening protocols and compound prioritization, and (v) MD simulations. The work employed several software packages, including antechamber, tleap, cpptraj (80) , sander, and pmemd from the AMBER suite of programs (University of California San Francisco) and dms, grid (81) , and sphgen (82) , which are part of the DOCK suite of programs (University of California San Francisco). divided into 42 chunks of at most 50,000 molecules. Compounds were flexibly (FLX) (42) docked to the GP2 five-helix bundle in parallel, using the MPI version of DOCK6.6 (University of California San Francisco). For each docked compound, the best scoring pose was retained, which was then energy minimized using the standard DOCK Cartesian energy (DCE) function to further fine-tune the interactions between the receptor and candidate ligands and permit footprint similarity scoring (42, 84) , where the similarity in VDW and ES interaction profiles between the reference and screened molecules was quantified using Euclidean distance. Key descriptors were computed with the program MOE for the 100,000 top-scoring molecules based on DCE score, including the number of Lipinski violations, number of chiral centers, and logP, to aid in compound prioritization. The MOE MACCS clustering method was concurrently employed, using a best-first approach, to group compounds into structurally related families with the best DCE scored compound per family to serve as a clusterhead. To promote diversity in compound selection, the top-scored clusterheads were rank ordered using five distinct scoring criteria: (i) the sum of the van der Waals and electrostatic DOCK Cartesian energy score (DCE SUM ), (ii) the van der Waals FPS score (FPS VDW ), (iii) the electrostatic FPS score (FPS ES ), (iv) the sum of the FPS VDW and FPS ES scores (FPS SUM ), and (v) the combined DCE SUM and FPS SUM scores (total score, or TS) (45) . Following 3D visual inspection of the top-scoring members from each of the five lists, 83 compounds, referred to with the prefix I (initial screen), were purchased for experimental testing. A second set of 82 ligands, referred to with the prefix S (secondary screen), was purchased based on similarity comparisons to hits identified in the initial screen. Similarity was computed using the following DOCK6 scoring functions: Hungarian similarity (56), footprint similarity (83), pharmacophore similarity (93) , and volume overlap. For both screens, additional ligand properties considered included central location in the pocket, number of chiral centers (less than 2), formal charge between Ϫ1 and ϩ1, favorable overall score with respect to the particular rank-order method, and favorable electrostatic score. MD simulations and analysis. For the most promising candidates, MD simulations were performed to assess geometric and energetic stability. The AMBER14 accessory programs antechamber and tleap were used to protonate, solvate, assemble, and assign force-field parameters for the protein receptor (ff14SB) (94) , solvent (TIP3P) (95) , and ligand (GAFF) (91) . Ligand partial charges were obtained from those preassigned by the ZINC database (92) . The five-helix bundle was capped where the N terminus was capped with ACE and the C terminus was capped with NME. As previously described (69), a nine-step protocol was used to equilibrate each solvated ligandprotein complex. Briefly, all simulations were performed using the CUDA-accelerated version of pmemd (96) (97) (98) in AMBER16. In short, first the solvent and protein-ligand hydrogens were minimized with a restraint weight of 20.0 kcal mol Ϫ1 Å Ϫ2 on all complex heavy atoms for 10,000 cycles. Second, the restraint was lifted and the entire complex was minimized for 5,000 cycles. Third, over 250 ps, the system was heated from 50 to 300K. Fourth, a short MD simulation of 500 ps, with an all-atoms restraint weight of 20.0 kcal mol Ϫ1 Å Ϫ2 , was performed to optimize the water box density to 1. Lastly, each complex underwent five equilibration steps, each 200 ps in length, with lessening restraint weights of all protein and ligand heavy atoms. For the protein, the restraint weights were (i) 10 Visualization of MD trajectories was conducted using VMD (99) and Chimera (88) . The AMBER14 accessory program cpptraj (80) and in-house protocols were utilized to extract VDW and ES energies (with distance-dependent dielectric) and compute molecular footprints, RMSDs (root mean squared deviations), and hydrogen-bonding interactions of each compound throughout its MD trajectories (4,000 frames for each simulation). As previously described (45, 55) , predicted interaction energies from all six replica MD trajectories were used to calculate the mean VDW and ES energies between the small molecule and each residue of the five-helix bundle. Residues with energies of less than Ϫ2.5 kcal/mol for the reference ligand and experimentally verified GP2 entry inhibitors were used to select key GP2 residues involved in an interaction energy. To compute ligand RMSDs, a two-step protocol was executed (73) . First, the protein-ligand complex in each frame of the trajectory was aligned using cpptraj so that the protein's alpha carbons overlapped. Second, atomic-level small-molecule translation and rotation compared to that of the docked pose was quantified. For interpretation, RMSDs were binned based on frequency using cpptraj and plotted using Python (Python Software Foundation). The AMBER accessory program cpptraj was used to extract the direct and water-mediated hydrogen-bonding interactions from each trajectory and provide a frequency, location, and frame. Experimental methods. The experimental methods to characterize the inhibitory activity of the small molecules identified from in silico screening are described below. Three different assays were employed: (i) pseudotyped HIV-1/EBOV-GP was utilized to assess viral entry, (ii) pseudotyped HIV-1/VSV-G was utilized to assess inhibitor specificity, and (iii) EBOV trVLP was utilized as a second confirmatory assay of viral entry.

Feldmann (NIH) (57) . 293T cells (ATCC CRL-11268) and TZM-bl cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Corning) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini Bio-Products) containing 100 g/ml of streptomycin and 100 U/ml of penicillin (DMEM-PS-10% FBS) in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO 2 atmosphere.
