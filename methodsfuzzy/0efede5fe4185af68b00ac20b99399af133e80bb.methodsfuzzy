Viruses and cells LASV (strain Josiah) was obtained from CDC (Atlanta, GA) and ML29 was previously described [25] , [26] , [27] . Vero E6 cells (ATCC, CRL-1586) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, GIBCO-BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO-BRL), 1% penicillinstreptomycin, and L-glutamine (2 mM); incubated at 37uC in 5% CO 2 for 24 hours. Vero cell monolayers were infected with LASV and ML29 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and incubated 1 hour at 37uC in 5% CO 2 , washed with PBS and then covered in DMEM 2% FBS. Supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 hours post infection, titrated in Vero cells and stored at 270uC at 10 7 PFU/ml. Human PBMC were obtained by apheresis from healthy volunteers followed by Ficoll-hypaque isolation [37] and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated human AB serum (Sigma). Monocytes were isolated from purified PBMC by plastic adherence and immature dendritic cells (DC) were generated from them after 5 days culture in supplemented RPMI. Briefly, the method for generating DC was to plate human PBMC at 1.67610 7 cells/2 ml/well in a 6-well plate in RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum. After 2 hrs, non-adherent cells were removed and the adherent monocytes were fed with 2.5 ml RPMI containing 20 ng/ml GM-CSF (Peprotech, Rocky Hill NJ), and 20 ng/ml IL-4 (Peprotech). After 5 days of incubation, cells were harvested, analyzed by flow cytometry, and processed for incubation with virus. On average, 22% of the cells were differentiated, monocytederived DC (DR+, CD11c+). [38] .
