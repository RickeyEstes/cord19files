Virus culture HSV-1 strain NC1, CMV strains Towne and Toledo, VZV strain Schenke and HIV-1 strains BaL, NL4.3 and RFW were propagated according to standard protocols [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The cell types infected, MOI, time of infection and percentage of cells infected are shown in table 1. Cells were infected with each virus strain at a MOI and duration in order to achieve the maximal percentage of infected cells as determined by QPCR for all HIV-1, HSV-1 and CMV infected cells, [21] and by flow cytometry for VZV infected cells [22] .
