Sources of Mortality Data Coronaviruses that infect domestic and laboratory animals produce illnesses which are sometimes fatal. In contrast, there is no documented report yet on record of human coronaviruses being involved in a lethal infcction. This situation may be a reflection of the limited number of investigations carried out as yet. It is known that these agents frequently infect small children and reinfect adults, including persons with chronic respiratory disease (53) . It would be logical to assume that deaths could occasionally occur in these most susceptible segments of the population, but they are probably not very frequent. Only the 229E strain was originally isolated in cell culture. It was eventually adapted to WI-38 cells, in which it has been maintained (23) . However, this cell line is not a reliable system for primary isolation of 229E-like agents. To date, human embryonic intestine (MA177) has proven the most suitable cell system but it is available only in limited quantities (29) . All other known human coronaviruses were originally isolated in organ cultures of human trachea or lung (24, 39, 58, 59) . The presence of virus was usually detected by electron microscopy, or sometimes by fluorescent antibody testing of impression smears (57) . Two strains, which are essentially identical, (OC 38 and 43), have been adapted to mouse brain and to primary monkey kidney and BS-C-1 cell cultures (11, 30, 37) . Another cell system LI 32, a heteroploid human lung line, has been reported to be suitable for primary isolation of 229E, a related virus (LP) and the first described organ culture agent B814 (6, 9) . This latter finding has not been confirmed by other workers ( 11).
