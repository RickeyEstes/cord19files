Cells, virus, and virus assays V676P3 is a plaque isolate derived by transfection of HeLa S3 cells with a P2/Lansing/37 infectious cDNA clone (Racaniello, 1984) . V667 is a uncloned P2/Lansing/37 stock prepared by multiple passages in HeLa S3 cells of a virus obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Racaniello, 1984) . Preparation of viral stocks, plaque assays, and neutralization tests were performed using HeLa S3 cell monolayers as described (La Monica et a/., 1986).
