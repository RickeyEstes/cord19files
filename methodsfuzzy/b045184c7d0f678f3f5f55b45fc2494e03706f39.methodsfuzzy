Standardization of the volume used for cytologic evaluation may be of benefit in minimizing analytic variation and aid in interpretation. Evaluation of multiple preparations or preparations from larger volumes of CSF increases the likelihood of detection of minor abnormalities. Because CSF has low cellularity, a concentration procedure is generally required: cytocentrifugation, sedimentation, or membrane filtration techniques may be used. Cytocentrifugation is commonly available in reference or commercial laboratories. The membrane filtration technique requires special staining that is not commonly available in practice. Several sedimentation techniques have been described and are suitable for use in practice or commercial or reference laboratories to which rapid submission of CSF specimens is possible (Cook and DeNicola, 1988; Parent and Rand, 1994) . Readers are referred to these sources for more detail on construction of a sedimentation apparatus and preparation of sedimentation specimens. A sample device is demonstrated in Fig. 14-2A&B. Sedimentation preparations may be made if a specimen cannot be delivered the same day to the laboratory for cytologic processing. Prepared slides are sent to the laboratory for staining and evaluation. Cytocentrifuge or sedimentation preparations are most commonly air-dried and stained with Romanowsky stains that are commonly available in commercial or reference laboratories and clinical practice laboratories. Membrane-filtration specimens require wet-fixation and stains appropriate for this method, commonly Papanicolaou, trichrome, or H&E. Wet-fixation and these staining methods may also be used on cytocentrifuge or sedimentation preparations and are appropriate for formalin-or alcohol-fixed specimens. Cytocentrifuge or membrane-filtration preparatory and staining techniques may vary with laboratory, technical training, and pathologist preference. Summaries of cytopreparatory and staining techniques for cytospin and membrane filtration specimens and specimens fixed in formalin or alcohol are available from a variety of sources. Interested readers are referred to Keebler and Facik (2008) for a recent comprehensive review. Special stains may be indicated in some cases. Gram stain may be useful for confirmation and identification of categories of bacteria. India ink or new methylene blue preparations have been reported to be helpful in identification of fungal infections, especially cryptococcosis. Periodic acid-Schiff stain may be used to demonstrate positive intracellular material in dogs with globoid cell leukodystrophy. Luxol fast blue can be used to demonstrate myelin in CSF specimens (Mesher et al., 1996) .
