Viral strains 7 to 38) were synthesized by standard solid-phase N-(9fluorenyl) methoxycarbonyl chemistry. The peptides were cleaved from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, Aldrich) and lyophilized. Two different synthetic peptides were made: an unlabeled peptide and one containing a para-iodo phenylalanine at position 23 of the sequence, as shown in Figure 1 . Peptide purity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The lyophilized peptide was dissolved in TFA (final concentration , 5 mg/ml), and immediately injected on a Jupiter 5m C4 300 Ã… column (Phenomenex, Chesire, UK), equilibrated with 80%
