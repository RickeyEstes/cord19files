The cDNA was amplified using 24 pairs of primers (Supplemental Table 1 ). Each fragment amplified by RT-PCR was about 1500 bp in length. After electrophoresis, PCR products were recovered using a PCR purification kit and sequenced on an AB3730 sequencer (Life Technologies, Guangzhou, China). The sequences obtained from PCR products were assembled into a fulllength genome sequence using DNAstar (version 7.0, DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA). [10] . RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected on days 4, 5, 10, and 13 after onset of fever. Reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA was performed as described previously. The cDNA was used as the template for PCR amplification with LA-Taq mix (TaKaRa) and primer pair no. 22. PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Protein sequences were aligned using MEGA (version 6.0) [11] . TransMembrane software was used to predict the transmembrane domain of the ORF5 protein (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ TMHMM/) [12] . RNA secondary structure was predicted using RNAfold software, available at http://rna.tbi.uni vie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi [13] .
