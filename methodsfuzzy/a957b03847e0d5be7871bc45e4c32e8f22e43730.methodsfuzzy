Construction of pET28b-3CL pro . The cDNA corresponding to SARS-CoV (strain TW1) nt 9985-10,902 coding for the 3CL pro protein was amplified by PCR from the reverse transcriptional mixture provided by Dr. P.J. Chen (Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan). The PCR product was cloned into the pET28b vector (Novagen) and the resulting plasmid, designated as pET28b-3CL pro , was verified by sequencing. Expression and purification of the 3CL pro protein. The plasmid transformed Escherichia coli cells were grown at 37°C until A 600 reached 0.6-0.8 and then induced to express the recombinant protein with 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3 h. The cells harvested were disrupted in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole) and cell lysate was applied to a nickel affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden). After wash, the 3CL pro protein was eluted with a 12-100% linear gradient of buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole) in buffer A. The fractions containing 3CL pro were pooled and dialyzed against the storage buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA). The sample was concentrated and stored at À80°C in storage buffer containing 50% glycerol. The proteins were more than 95% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE. Deletion and point mutation. Using pET28b-3CL pro as a template, three mutant clones (H41A, D1-7, and DIII) were generated by oneprimer PCR method as described previously [15] . The single primer 5 0 -CACAGTATACTGTCCAAGAGCTGTCATTTGCACAGCAG-3 0 was used for the substitution of His41 with an alanine, primer 5 0 -CAGCAAATGGGTCGGGATCCCTTCCCGTCAGGCAAAGTTG AA-3 0 was used for the deletion of the N-terminal 1-7 amino acids of 3CL pro , and primer 5 0 -GCAGGTACAGACACAACCATAGCGG CCGCACTCGAGCACCAC-3 0 was used for the deletion of the Cterminal 201-306 amino acids of 3CL pro . All the mutant clones were verified by sequencing. Protease activity assay using the IQF peptide substrates. Two synthetic IQF peptides, 1NC (Abz-Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-GlnflSer-Gly-Phe-Arg-Lys-DNP) and 2NC (Abz-Ser-Gly-Val-Thr-Phe-GlnflGly-Lys-Phe-Lys-Lys-DNP) (Genemed Synthesis, South San Francisco, CA), were used in this study (fl indicates the cleavage site). The reaction mixture (30 ll) contained 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, 1 mM DTT, 25 mM NaCl, 0.025% Triton X-100, 100 lM peptide substrate, and 6 lM 3CL pro . Reactions were performed in a 384-well black microtiter plate incubated at 32°C. After the enzyme was added, the increase of fluorescence was recorded continuously using a Labsystems fluorometer (Fluoroskan Ascent) with a plate reader accessory with excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 420 nm, respectively. The kinetic parameters were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plot using 6 lM enzyme and 25-400 lM peptide substrates. Analysis of peptide cleavage by HPLC. The cleavage assays were carried out in a reaction mixture as described above for 3 h at 32°C and then stopped by the addition of 1% formic acid. The reaction products were resolved on a C 18 analytic column (4.6 mm · 250 mm, Beckman, Fullerton, CA) using a 0-60% linear gradient of 80% acetonitrile in 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid, at 1 ml min À1 flow rate. The elution was monitored at an absorbance wavelength of 220 nm. Inhibition assays. The inhibitory activities of protease inhibitors or antibodies toward 3CL pro were measured in a reaction mixture lacking DTT in the presence of various concentrations (0-400 lM) of the inhibitors or different amounts (0-5 ll) of antiserum or monoclonal antibody ascites. Two cysteine protease inhibitors, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and E-64, and two serine protease inhibitors, Na-p-Tosyl-Llysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) and N-p-Tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) (Sigma), were used in this study. The antibodies used were rabbit anti-SARS-CoV 3CL pro antiserum and three mouse anti-3CL pro monoclonal antibodies (our unpublished data).
