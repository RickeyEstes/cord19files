Collection of rat faecal samples Faecal samples were collected from urban areas of Malaysia, Hong Kong and Denmark. All Danish samples from wild rats (n = 20) were collected from four locations within the Copenhagen area: Egedal Municipality (EM), Copenhagen University Hospital (CUH), Botanical Garden of Copenhagen (BGC) and Amager East (AE). In addition, one sample was collected from laboratory rats at the faculty of health and medical sciences (FHMS), University of Copenhagen. Five samples were collected in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, one in Kuala Langat, Malaysia and two samples were obtained from Hong Kong, China. The samples collected in Asia were shipped at ambient temperature in Falcon tubes and immediately frozen upon arrival. The samples from Denmark were frozen at -20Â°C within 24 h of collection. No animals were harmed during the sample collection.
