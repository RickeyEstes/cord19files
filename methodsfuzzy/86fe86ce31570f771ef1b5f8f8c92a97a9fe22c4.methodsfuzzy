Study setting. This was a retrospective study conducted at two acute large tertiary care teaching hospitals within the same academic and health care system in Rhode Island. Rhode Island Hospital is a 713-bed tertiary care center, and The Miriam Hospital is a 247-bed community hospital. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board for both institutions. RVP and RPP tests. The previously instituted RVP (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) detected influenza A virus (H1, H3, and H5), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A, RSV B, coronavirus (NL63, OC43, HKU1, and 229E), parainfluenza virus (types 1 to 4), metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, and adenovirus (28) . The sensitivity and specificity were 91.2 and 99.7%, respectively (29) , with reported TATs between 12 and 24 h (30). Of note, this test is no longer commercially available in the United States and has been replaced by the reduced step version, namely, the Luminex NxTAG respiratory panel. This assay is still, however, a multistep batch mode assay, corresponding to prolonged TATs depending on the timing of sample collection. The recently implemented RPP (GenMark Diagnostics, Inc., San Diego, CA) includes adenovirus, coronavirus (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43), influenza A virus (H1, 2009 H1N1, and H3), influenza B virus, RSV (A and B), parainfluenza virus (types 1 to 4), human metapneumovirus, and enterovirus/rhinovirus, as well as three atypical pathogens, Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (31) . The RPP has 100% concordance with laboratory developed testing (31), Ͼ95% agreement with an alternative multisyndromic respiratory panel, and a reported TAT of 2 to 4 h (32). At our institutions, multiplex viral testing is recommended for inpatients or those likely to be admitted, whereas rapid influenza A/B PCR testing (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) is recommended for outpatients or those likely to be discharged from the emergency department (ED). A strict testing algorithm is not enforced. Respiratory panels are performed at both institutions in the microbiology lab. The results are immediately released upon assay completion in the electronic medical record. Patient selection. Patients included in our analysis were Ն18 years old, assessed in one of the two EDs, and admitted to one of the two hospitals during November 2016 and February 2017 (RVP group) or November 2018 and February 2019 (RPP group) with ICD-10 coded diagnoses indicating lower respiratory symptoms with a nasopharyngeal-swab specimen submitted for RVP or RPP within 48 h of presentation. Two months from consecutive influenza seasons were chosen due to the high volume of samples, respectively. Patients were excluded if they were on outpatient antibiotics prior to admission, received antibiotics for other indications (e.g., concurrent cellulitis, urinary tract infection, bacteremia with positive blood cultures, ventilator-associated pneumonia, neutropenic fever, or aspiration pneumonia with an abnormal swallow evaluation) or were comfort-care only. Primary and secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes were antibiotic initiation and duration, stratified by normal or abnormal chest imaging. Secondary outcomes included inpatient admissions, length of stay (LOS), death during hospitalization, allergic reactions, the development of Clostridium difficile infection within 30 days, and readmission within 30 days. Data collection. Data extracted from electronic medical records included the choice, duration, and administration time of antibiotics. Length of therapy (LOT) was calculated from the date of the first to the last administered dose. For patients discharged on antibiotics, the date of the last dose was extrapolated from the days of therapy prescribed at discharge. All initial chest imaging (including chest x-rays and chest computed tomography scans) were reviewed and categorized as "normal" or "abnormal" based on the dictated radiology interpretation. Imaging was labeled normal if the interpretation indicated no acute pulmonary process (e.g., clear lung fields, no acute cardiopulmonary process, or chronic emphysematous changes without superimposed airspace disease). Radiology interpretations indicating an acute pulmonary process were considered "abnormal." To verify our laboratory's TATs, the time of specimen collection to the time of result availability in the electronic medical record (EMR) was recorded for each sample. Statistical analysis. Clinical and laboratory data for all patients who met inclusion criteria were used in all statistical analysis and for all hypothesis testing. All statistical tests were run using Proc Glimmix, allowing for fitting of both general and generalized linear models (33, 34) , as well as deriving P values for hypothesis tests or estimated mean comparisons (SAS v9.2; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). For primary and secondary outcomes, a generalized linear model for lognormal, normal, or binary outcomes was used to analyze demographics and confounding variables to test for differences between respiratory test periods (RPP versus RVP). Antibiotic use was assessed using three different metrics: whether or not antibiotics were prescribed, whether antibiotics were given before test resulted, and the number of days prescribed. A generalized linear model for binary outcomes was used to analyze and estimate the proportion of patients who received antibiotics by respiratory testing (RPP and RVP) and chest imaging results (normal/abnormal). An interaction term was included in the model to allow for differences by level of chest imaging result (normal/abnormal). This analysis was repeated to test the proportion of patients who received antibiotics before EMR test result availability. A negative binomial distribution was used to model days of antibiotics by viral test and chest imaging results. An interaction term was also included to allow for differences in the relationship between the viral test used and antibiotic days, with the chest imaging result. A subanalysis was performed to test whether antibiotics were subsequently discontinued; analysis was run on the subgroup of patients who received antibiotics before EMR test result availability. The proportions of patients who tested positive, who were admitted, who had viral testing performed in the ED, who underwent 30-day readmittance, who experienced in-hospital mortality, who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), who were influenza-positive and treated with antivirals, and for whom C. difficile studies were positive were analyzed to test for indirect systemic differences between study periods (RPP versus RVP). We also analyzed the length of stay based on the respiratory test used with an interaction term for antibiotics administered. Classic sandwich estimation was used to adjust for any model misspecification. A family-wise alpha was maintained at 0.05 using the Holm adjustment for multiple comparisons. Adjusted P values are reported unless otherwise stated. All statistical models were run using Proc Glimmix, allowing for modeling of both general and generalized linear models, as well as deriving P values for model fixed effects or estimated mean comparisons (SAS v9.2).
