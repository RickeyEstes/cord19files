Current and archived field specimens previously submitted to FADDL for routine diagnostic evaluation were used in this study and were diagnosed free of FMD, SVD, VES, and VSV. Clinical specimens naturally exposed to disease were collected by state or federal veterinarians from privately owned agricultural animals raised for food production and sent to our laboratory for diagnosis. These samples were provided for diagnostic purposes, and not specifically for this experiment. Additionally, no animals were used or experimentally infected to generate these field specimens for the purpose of this study, as such; no IACUC protocols apply or are available. Serum collections from non-clinical animals were made available from an ongoing surveillance program conducted by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) at FADDL.
