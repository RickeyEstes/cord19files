This study was based on heifer calf records from 104 randomly selected Holstein dairy farms in southwestern Ontario. All farms were used for farm level analyses. On a random subset of 35 of these farms, individual heifer calf data were collected. These records formed the basis of the individual calf analyses. Data were collected from all farms over a two and one-half year period between 1980 and 1983. Methods of farm selection, data collection, descriptions of management variables and calf outcomes, and the effects of management on morbidity, have been discussed elsewhere (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986a,b) . Farm-level mortality rates were calculated for the following seasonal time periods: 1 January--15 May 1980 (Winter 1); 16 May--15 November 1981 (Summer 1); 16 November--15 May 1982 (Winter 2); 16 May--15 November 1982 (Summer 2) and 16 November--15 May 1983 (Winter 3). Winter 1 was slightly truncated to allow time for all farmers to become accustomed to the record-keeping system. Rates were calculated as (number of heifer calves died) รท (number of live-born heifer calves) for each time period. The distribution of these mortality rates was shown previously to follow a non-normal (non-Gaussian) pattern (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986a) . In each time period, the median mortality rate was zero, while the mean was around 6%. It was therefore deemed appropriate, both from a statistical and a practical viewpoint, to divide farms into those experiencing mortality and those not experiencing mortality. Also, all predictor variables considered, except for FARM SIZE, were binary or categorical in nature. Statistical analyses were carried out using stepwise multiple logistic regression to search for management variables which might distinguish the two groups of farms (Kleinbaum et al., 1982) . Some variables, such as those concerned with whether or not hutches were moved between calves, or whether or not indoor calf pens were in an air space separate from the adult cows, only applied to particular subsets of farms. These were analyzed by means of two-way tables, stratified by year, with differences tested by chi-square or Fisher's Exact test. At the individual calf level, stepwise logistic regression was used to analyze data for calves dying between birth and weaning, and also for those dying during the neonatal period (~< 28 days). At the individual calf level, all predictor variables, except for estimated birth weight (from heart-girth measurements) were binary or categorical in nature. Data were available for 1968 heifer calves born between the winter of 1980 and the spring of 1983; of these, 3.76% died between birth and weaning. Whereas the main analyses were carried out on the full data set, the effect of estimated birth weight could only be evaluated on 614 calves. Similarly, information on age at removal from dam and subsequent housing was only available for 682 calves. At both levels of analysis, initial main effects models were run with pvalues for F-to-remove and F-to-enter set to 0.15 and 0.10, respectively. The variables selected in the main effects models were used to create other variables denoting interaction. These F values were then set to 0.10 and 0.05 (removal, entry) and interactions involving the variables having significant main effects were assessed, using the hierarchical inclusion rule, namely, an interaction term was only allowed to enter the model if both main effects were already included. For analyses at the individual calf level, the various categories of calving ease (EASE) were pooled to create a binary variable: assisted calving versus non-assisted calving. Similarly, method of feeding first colostrum (HOW-COLOSTRUM) was re-structured into assisted and/or supplemented versus natural suckle only. This restructuring was carried out primarily to simplify the model and facilitate interpretation of interaction terms. Nevertheless, since both calving ease and method of first colostrum feeding significantly affected the odds of dying, the details of these associations were explored in secondary analyses. Lemeshow and Hosmer's statistic (1982) was used to assess the fit of the chosen logistic model to the data. The effects of various within-farm management variables on age at death were assessed using multiple linear regression. Based on the lowest Mallows' Cp statistic, the 'best' subset was chosen from a print-out of all possible subsets (Draper and Smith, 1981; SAS, 1982) . This model was then evaluated further by examination of residuals, as well as the significance of the regression coefficients. The specific management variables considered for inclusion in the models were discussed in previous papers in this series (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986a, b) .
