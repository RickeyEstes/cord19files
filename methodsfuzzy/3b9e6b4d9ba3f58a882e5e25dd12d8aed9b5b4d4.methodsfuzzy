The University Hospital of Alexandroupolis is a report center of the H1N1 virus for the region of Thrace in Greece. The hospital consists of more than fifty departments, one of which is the Unit of Infectious Diseases. During the influenza epidemic a special department for flu was established in which all patients with flu symptoms and/or signs were referred. Patients with positive flu test were transferred in an 8 bed unit with negative pressure especially designed to quarantine and isolate patients with airborne transmitted viral infections. From 10th August until 31st December 2009, 33 cases of confirmed H1N1 influenza A virus were hospitalized and quarantined in the Unit of Infectious Diseases. All patients with flu-like symptoms (sore throat, cough, rhino rhea, or nasal congestion) and fever >37.5째C were admitted in the Unit of Infectious diseases and gave pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs. The swabs were tested with real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerasechain-reaction (RT-PCR) as in previous reported studies [11] [12] [13] . It should also be mentioned that although RT-PCR is the most sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of influenza virus infection, upper respiratory tract specimens are not as specific (~80%) as lower respiratory tract specimens (~100%) [14] . All results were given in a period of time from 8 to 48 hours, and all patients remained under quarantine and isolation in negative pressure chambers according to WHO guidelines [15] . Our department prefers to use the Pneumonia Severity Index in order to evaluate the severity of the disease. However, this score was not different between the two groups. The Pneumonia Score Index was calculated for patients in both groups and the Class range was between II-IV [16] . We repeated HINI test 7 days after admission and no patient negative in the initial test became positive. In total, 60 patients were admitted in a four month period, of whom 33 were H1N1 positive (group A) and 27 negative (group B). The 33 H1N1 positive patients remained under quarantine and isolation, while the 27 negative patients were moved to the Department of Internal Medicine. Patients were monitored until discharge, with symptoms and signs recorded daily. Return to normal body temperature was defined as a temperature of less than 37째C for 1 day after withdrawal of antipyretic treatment [17] . The criteria for discharge were absence of hypoxemia, normal chest x-ray and temperature <37째C for 1 day without antipyretic treatment. Upon admission procalcitonin (PCT) evaluation was performed in 51 patients (25 group A/26 group B), for nine patients this exam was not available due to lack in reagents in our laboratory. Also urine antigen for Legionella and Streptococcus pneumoniae was tested upon admission in all patients but they were negative. Upon admission sputum stain was given in 12/33 patients in group A and 15/27 in group B. The rest of the patients did not produce enough sputum quantity for staining or did not cooperate in giving sputum. Finally blood cultures were collected in 49/60 patients when the body temperature exceeded 38째C, but no results came positive.
