One hundred fourteen SNPs from the 12 candidate antiviral genes were included in the custom Illumina GoldenGate SNP panel (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) for 768 SNPs. Genotype calls were made using the Genotyping module of BeadStudio 2 software. For quality control we used control genomic DNA samples (CEPH family Trio from Coriell Institute, and two other genomic DNAs). The replicate and inheritance data were used to review and refine clustering. For the SNPs that failed the standard initial laboratory quality assurance, genotyping was successfully carried out using TaqMan (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers and probes were Assay-by Design (Applied Biosystems). After PCR amplification, end reactions were read on the ABI, Prism 7900ht using Sequence Detection Software (Applied Biosystems). Measurement of cytokine secretion resulted in six recorded values per individual for each outcome: three without in vitro viral stimulation (background control, unstimulated in triplicate) and three after in vitro PBMCs stimulation with rubella virus (virus-stimulated in triplicate). A single summary measurement per individual was obtained for each outcome by subtracting the median of the three unstimulated values from the median of the three stimulated values. Assessments of antibody levels resulted in only one recorded value per individual. Data were summarized across individuals using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables, and medians and inter-quartile ranges for continuous variables. Observed genotypes were used to estimate allele frequencies for each SNP, and departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were assessed using a Pearson goodness-of-fit test or, for SNPs with an MAF of Ï½5%, a Fisher exact test [24] . Estimates of pair-wise LD based on the r-squared statistic were obtained using Haploview software, version 3.32 [25] . SNP associations with immune response outcomes were individually evaluated using linear regression models. Simple linear regression was used for rubella antibody levels, which had only one measured value per individual. Repeated measure approaches were implemented for the cytokine secretion variables, simultaneously modeling all six observed measurements (three unstimulated values and three virus-stimulated values). The primary test of significance assessed the degree to which the SNP was associated with stimulation-induced differences in the response, and was obtained from the covariate reflecting the genotype-by-stimulation status interaction. We accounted for within-subject correlations without imposing any constraints on the nature of the correlations. Primary tests of association assumed an ordinal SNP effect, based on the number of copies of the minor allele. To further explore genomic regions containing statistically significant single-SNP effects for one or more outcomes of interest, we performed post hoc haplotype analyses. Posterior probabilities of all haplotypes consistent with the genotypes of each individual were estimated using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, similar to the method outlined by Schaid et al. [26] . This information was used to define haplotype design variables that reflected the number of each of the haplotypes that were expected to be carried by each subject. Analyses were performed on these haplotype design variables using the simple least squares regression approach for antibody levels and the repeated measures approach for the cytokine secretion described earlier. Because of the imprecision involved in estimating the effects of low-frequency haplotypes, we considered only those occurring with an estimated frequency of greater than 1%. Because of phase ambiguity, haplotypespecific medians and inter-quartile ranges could not be calculated. Thus, descriptive summaries were represented using the t-statistics corresponding to the haplotype main effect term for antibody levels or the haplotype-by-stimulation status interaction term for all immune measures. All analyses adjusted for race, gender, age at enrollment, age at first and second rubella vaccination, and cohort status, thus accounting for time since last immunization, waning of immune response and time of immune response measurements. Data transformations were used to correct for data skewness in all linear regression models. An inverse-normal transformation was used for all cytokine secretion outcome variables, and a logarithmic transformation was used for the antibody response measure. All statistical tests were two-sided and, unless otherwise indicated, all analyses were carried out using the SAS software system (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
