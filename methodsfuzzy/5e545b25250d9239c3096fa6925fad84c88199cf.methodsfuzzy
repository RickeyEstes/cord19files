CIV isolation and sequencing. Sample processing and virus isolation were performed as previously described (54) . RNA was directly extracted from nasal swabs for screening. All of the M-gene-positive samples were incubated on a monolayer of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells for virus isolation. The HA and NA subtypes were determined by direct sequencing of the PCR products. Whole genomes were amplified by PCR and sequenced by segment-specific primers. Phylogenetic analysis. Sequence alignments were constructed for the IAVs collected for this study from canines and background sequences from canines, swine, humans, birds, and other species that were downloaded from the Influenza Virus Resource at NCBI's GenBank (55) . To capture the complete multihost ecology of PDMhuH1 (hu stands for humans) in Asia, the data sets included viruses collected from all host species from which PDMhuH1 viruses have been identified in Asia so far, including humans, swine, canines, ferrets, and giant pandas. Alignments were constructed for each of the six internal gene segments (polymerase basic protein 2 [PB2], PB1, polymerase acidic protein [PA], nucleoprotein [NP], MP, and NS) and independently for different hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes using MUSCLE v3.8.3 (56) , with manual correction in Se-Al v2.0 (available at http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/ seal/). Initial phylogenetic trees were inferred using the neighbor-joining method available in PAUP v4.0b10 (available at http://paup.csit.fsu.edu) for each of the alignments to assign each sequence to one of the genetic lineages found in swine (EAswH1, TRswH1, CswH1, and PDMswH1), canines (H3N2can), or birds (H5N1, H5N6, H6N1, and H9N2). All xml files have been deposited in Dryad and are available at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.16r2v07. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred for each of the data sets separately using the time-scaled Bayesian approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) available via the BEAST v1.8.4 package (57) and the computational resources of the NIH HPC Biowulf cluster (http://hpc.nih.gov). A strict molecular clock was used, with a constant population size, and a general-time reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution with gamma-distributed rate variation among sites. For viruses for which only the year of viral collection was available, the lack of tip date precision was accommodated by sampling uniformly across a 1-year window from 1 January to 31 December. The MCMC was run separately at least three times for each of the data sets and for at least 100 million iterations with subsampling every 10,000 iterations, using the BEAGLE library to improve computational performance (58) . All parameters reached convergence, as assessed visually using Tracer v.1.6, with statistical uncertainty reflected in values of the 95% highest posterior density (HPD). At least 10% of the chain was removed as burn-in, and runs for the same lineage and segment were combined using LogCombiner v1.8.4 and down-sampled to generate a final posterior distribution of 1,000 trees that was used in the subsequent spatial analysis. Spatial analysis. To study the spatial patterns of interspecies transmission of H1N1pdm in Asia (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, and MP segments), the following hosts and locations were defined: (i) canines from Guangxi, China; (ii) canines from South Korea; (iii) humans from China (including Taiwan), Japan, and South Korea; (iv) swine from southern China (including Hong Kong SAR, Guangdong Province, and Guangxi); (v) swine from China (excluding southern China); (vi) swine from South Korea; (vii) swine from Japan; and (viii) nonhuman/nonswine/noncanine host species (including ferret and giant panda) from China (including Taiwan). To study the spatial patterns of EAswH1 viruses (HA and NA segments), the following hosts and locations were defined: (i) canines from Guangxi, China; (ii) humans from China; (c) swine from southern China (including Hong Kong SAR, Guangdong Province, and Guangxi); (iv) swine from China (excluding southern China); (v) swine from South Korea; and (vi) swine from Europe. For the NA segment, viruses from swine in Mexico and six representative viruses from human H1N1pdm viruses, including A/California/04/2009(H1N1), were also included for reference. To study the spatial patterns of CswH1 and TRswH3 Emergence of Novel IAVs in Canines Â® viruses (NS segment), the following hosts and locations were defined: (i) canines from Guangxi, China; (ii) swine from southern China (including Hong Kong SAR, Guangdong Province, and Guangxi); (iii) swine from China (excluding southern China); (iv) swine from South Korea; (v) swine from Japan; (vi) swine from South-East Asia (including Thailand and Vietnam); (vii) swine from Europe; and (viii) swine from North America. Six representative viruses from human H1N1pdm viruses, including A/California/04/2009(H1N1), were also included for reference. Using these defined geographic regions, the host and location were specified for each viral sequence, allowing the expected number of state transitions in the ancestral history conditional on the data observed at the tree tips to be estimated using "Markov jump" counts (59) , which provided a quantitative measure of asymmetry in gene flow between regions. For computational efficiency, the phylogeographic analysis was run using an empirical distribution of 1,000 trees (60), allowing the MCMC to be run for 25 million iterations, sampling every 1,000. A Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) was employed to improve statistical efficiency for all data sets. Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were summarized by using TreeAnnotator v1.8.0, and the trees were visualized by using FigTree v1.4.3. Amino acid analysis. We used the sequence-derived phenotype markers provided by the Influenza Research Database (IRD) (61) to compare known phenotype-associated amino acid changes in the CIVs collected for this study and other host species and lineages (available at https://www.fludb.org). We also used IRD's HA subtype numbering tool (62) . Accession number(s). All sequence data were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers MG254059 to MG254185).
