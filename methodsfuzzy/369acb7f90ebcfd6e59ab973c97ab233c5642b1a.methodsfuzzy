A total of 335 randomly selected, client-owned domestic cats, presented in 24 clinics, over a period of 3 years (2016-2018) were tested from all over Hungary ( Figure  2 ). No free-roaming or sheltered cats were included in the survey. Age, sex, patient history, vaccination status and the household status of cats were registered. General physical examination was performed in each case and EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples were drawn as a part of the routine diagnostic or screening process. A Witness FeLV-FIV ELISA test (Zoetis) was performed immediately, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The rest of the blood samples were frozen and sent to the Department of Pathology, at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Budapest, and they were stored at -80Â°C until further examination.
