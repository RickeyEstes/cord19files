Conventional subcutaneous or intramuscular vaccinations are performed with needles reaching the subcutaneous fat tissue or the muscle, respectively. Large volumes of vaccines (up to 1 ml) are administered [30] , which would not be convenient for administration to the dermis, that is, by intradermal injection. Furthermore, immunogenicity of subcutaneous or intramuscular injection depends on the release of inflammatory molecules due to tissue damage and, consequently, infiltration of leukocytes attracted to the site of vaccination, instead of targeting epidermal and dermal professional antigen-presenting cells. The standard technique for intradermal injection, termed the Mantoux method, was invented in 1910 by Charles Mantoux as a tuberculin test. This kind of intradermal injection is performed by inserting a needle at an angle of 45 into the skin for delivery of volumes between 100 and 200 µl [31] . To avoid either entering the hypodermis or leakage of the vaccine due to superficial injection, performance of this technique relies on well-trained healthcare personnel [32, 33] . Moreover, intradermal injection has been described to be more painful compared to intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, and development of localized erythema or edema are possible side effects. Due to the presence of lymph vessels in the dermis, intradermal injection leads to passive drainage of small molecules by the lymphatic system, whereas larger molecules can be taken up and actively transported to draining LNs by activated dDCs [34] . Also, monocytes or neutrophils, attracted by inflammatory mediators, can carry vaccine components to the draining LNs after entering the injection site from the bloodstream. Recently, the practical impediments associated with intradermal injections have been overcome by the development of novel, minimally or noninvasive techniques. These include solid, coated, hollow or dissolvable (micro)needles, mostly grouped into arrays, for circumvention of the stratum corneum [5] . Depending on the needle length, such arrays provide delivery into the epidermal or the dermal compartment by creating transient micropores. In clinical studies, this vaccination technology has been rated to be less painful compared to the Mantoux method. An additional advantage might be the possibility of self-administration by the patient. However, there are also some limitations to microneedle-based immunizations: i) due to variability in mechanical and structural properties of the skin, microneedles have to be much longer than 20 µm, though theoretically only the 15 --20 µm thick stratum corneum has to be bypassed; ii) choice of needle length might be crucial for the immunological outcome, as targeting different skin layers results in activation of different immunocompetent skin-resident cells; iii) use of very thin microneedles includes the risk of rupture in the skin; iv) the amount of active compounds, which can be coated onto microneedles, is limited; v) smaller needle diameters restrict the use of carriers such as liposomes or nanoparticles. Recent developments in the field of microneedle-based vaccination have been reviewed by Kim et al. [35] . Besides targeting immunologically suboptimal sites, conventional needle-based approaches potentially lead to needlestick injuries as well as intentional reuse, which is responsible for transmission of blood-borne diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV [36] . Hence, there is high demand for needle-free delivery technologies with regard to mass vaccinations in developing countries and also to increase compliance especially in young children. Needle-free methods to enhance transcutaneous antigen delivery include liquid jet immunization, epidermal powder immunization, tape stripping, skin abrasion, low frequency ultrasound and thermoablation [5] . The novel scanning laser technology, as discussed in detail in this review, provides a delivery platform for reproducible, but at the same time, highly adaptable, circumvention of the stratum corneum.
