The statistical analyses of the results on wettability, surface hardness, antibacterial, and cytotoxicity tests between the coated samples and uncoated pure-Ti plates was determined by Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at the p < 0.01 level. Results revealed that the surface morphology and texture of the samples exhibited obvious changes when oxidized after HTA and LSTO. Low laser frequency possessed high laser energy density, creating greater distinction between laser-processed areas and untreated areas. When the laser frequency was 100 kHz, the coating exhibited noticeable surface morphological changes (Figure 1a) , particularly, changes in texture depth and protrusions. A higher laser frequency is attributed to more flashes from the light source, which, in turn, shortens the time used to focus laser energy on the surface. Of the laser settings used to perform LSTO on the TiV coatings, the highest laser frequency was 500 kHz; hence, the coating produced using this frequency was exposed to the least amount of energy density and, therefore, exhibited the least notable morphological changes. For the samples treated by HTA, as shown in Figure 1d , the Ti-V-O coating did not exhibit noticeable morphological differences after undergoing annealing at 500 • C. However, after annealing at 600 • C, the coating surface exhibited changes in roughness; in addition to grain enlargement, the coating surface developed an oxide layer. When the annealing temperature was increased to 700 • C, the increasing amount of oxides created an obvious difference in the surface morphology of the coating. (Table 1) showed that when the content of oxygen in the Ti-V-O coating increased to 57.21%, the vanadium content did not exhibit a considerable change, but the titanium content lowered to 10.41%. This indicated that after oxidation at 600 • C, the Ti-V-O coating mainly consisted of vanadium oxide (V 2 O 5 ). After the oxidation temperature was increased to 700 • C, the Ti-V-O coating exhibited grain-shaped oxides (Figure 2d ). This result was similar to that of Guo et al. [10] who reported that, at approximately 656 • C, TiO 2 thin films produced grain-shaped oxides. Furthermore, the results of the present study revealed that the oxygen increased to 64.43%, the titanium content increased from 10.41% to 31.29%, whereas the vanadium content decreased to 4.28%. That indicated that when the Ti-V-O coating sample was heated to 700 • C, it mainly consisted of TiO 2 .
