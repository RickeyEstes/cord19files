In our study, the gag-pol domains of RSV, HIV-1, HIV-2, SIVmac, SIVagm, EIAV, VISNA, 17.6, gypsy, MIAP, and gag-pro and pro-pol domains of BLV, HTLV-1, HTLV-2, MMTV, MPMV, and SRV-1 are determined by their open reading frames and the demonstrated or suspected frameshift sites [3] in the genomes of these retroviruses or transposable elements. These junction regions consist of -600 nt (that is, they include 300 nt both upstream and downstream from the possible frameshift sites). The putative pseudoknot is detected in two steps. Step 1 involves the detection of a distinct unusual RNA folding region. The RNA secondary structure predicted in the specific folding region is highly stable and statistically significant relative to others in a given domain of the sequence. In step 2, the possible tertiary interactions between unpaired nucleotides in the loop and nucleotides downstream of the detected distinct stemloop structure are searched. The stability and statistical significance of a given stem-loop relative to other possible structures in the sequence are assessed by two standardized scores, stability score and significance score [32, 33] . The significance score (Sigscr) and stability score (Stbscr) of a segment are defined as GATA 8(7): 191-205, 1991 Shu-Yun Le et al.
