Site-specific O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates are found across a variety of species. C 9 O-acetylated Neu5Acs, for instance, are found in the human gut ranging from 14-23% ( Figure 3 ) [12, 39] . Meanwhile, C 4 O-acetylated Neu5Ac is ubiquitous in ungulates [11, 22, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] , echinoderms [45] , Australian monotreme echidna [40] , and a subgroup of chordates [42] [43] [44] 46, 47] . Among several vertebrates, C 4 -O-acetylated Neu5Ac was found mostly in the circulatory system of fish [47] . including sialidase (or neuraminidase) or hemagglutinin-esterases, depending on the virus type [30] . Viral pathogenicity, therefore, requires a specific host-receptor partnership. It was believed that Sia glycosylation patterns were the most critical features to virus binding; however, recognition of modified Sia appears to be equally important. More specifically, O-acetylation at varying sites of Sia (i.e. C4 vs C7-9) influences virus recognition and attachment. Viral receptor molecules show remarkable specificity toward host sialic acid isoforms at a molecular level and delving deeper into the effects of O-acetylated Sia/viral enzymes may help identify a potential therapeutic target to prevent virus-related diseases.

Among several vertebrates, C4-O-acetylated Neu5Ac was found mostly in the circulatory system of fish [47] . Enzymatic or mildly acidic hydrolytic release from mucins are conventional methods by which partially O-acetylated Neu5Ac have been extracted prior to characterization [48] [49] [50] . The most convenient isolation techniques involve the application of sialidases; however, issues related to manufacturing costs and activities without jeopardizing the integrity of O-acetyl groups prevent access to materials at a commercial scale. Among detection strategies, histochemical staining has become a widely accepted technique for detecting O-acetylated Neu5Ac with information on site-specificity (Table 2 ). Ravindranaths and coworkers, for instance, showed that radiolabeled, purified crab lectin from Cancer antennarius incubated with erythrocytes in Tris buffered saline bound to C9 O-acetylated Neu5Ac using radiolabelled assays [51] . More recently, advances in using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI) combined with imaging software have enabled mapping of the localization of O-acetylation on gangliosides [52, 53] . Furthermore, modern techniques available for analyses include fluorescence detection by 1,2-diamino-4,5methylenedioxybenzene [54] , Neu5Ac analogs using high-performance liquid chromatography [55] [56] [57] , colorimetric determination [58] [59] [60] , thin-layer chromatography [60] , electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry [61] , GC-MS of silylated analogues [62] , and NMR [53, 63] .
