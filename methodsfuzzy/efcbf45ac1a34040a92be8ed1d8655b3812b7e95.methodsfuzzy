Eighteen Merino sheep farms with previous history of lamb diarrhoea were randomly selected. Eight of them presented during the study mortality rates in lambs and attributed to scouring higher than 15% (high mortality), while the other ten showed lower mortality rates (low mortality). This ratio was verified holding contacts with the farms to quantify the losses. Flocks were managed under semi-extensive system, with the same health and management practices. Nutrition was based upon grazing and supplementation in the seasons with poor forage production (summer and the coldest months of winter) and in the lactating period. Farms were inspected and information was collected about flock size (below average level of 700 head, above average), type of facilities (old, new), type of breeding (natural, synchronised), lambing percentage (below average point of 70%, above average), organization of lambing periods (continuous, discontinuous), cleaning of lambing areas (bad, good) and accumulation of lambs in the pens (>2, <2 lambs/m 2 ). Milk and blood samples were taken from ewes, and blood samples from their lambs in a number proportional to flock size (<400 head = 10 ewes and their lambs, 400-800 head = 15, >800 head = 20). Lambs were 15 days old and did not show clinical signs of diarrhoea or dehydration in that moment. All the ewes were homogeneous in age and body condition. Clinical reports of lambs from the selected farms, referred to the Diagnostic Service of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of Extremadura University during the last months were used to investigate the infectious agents involved.
