Mice and Virus Infection C57BL/6 WT mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD). IL-10 deficient mice on a C57BL/6 background (IL-10 2/2 ), purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, MA), were housed and maintained locally under pathogen free conditions. Mice were infected at 6 to 7 weeks of age by intracranial injection of 250 plaque forming units of the glia tropic mAb derived escape mutant of mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (JHMV), designated V2.2-1 (Fleming et al., 1986) . Infectious virus was determined in clarified supernatants of homogenized brains by plaque assay as described (Fleming et al., 1986) . Plaques were counted after 48 h incubation at 378C. All procedures were conducted under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
