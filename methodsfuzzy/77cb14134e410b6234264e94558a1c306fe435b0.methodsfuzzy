The multi-zone modeling method is widely accepted for predictions of air infiltration rates, ventilation and concentrations of contaminants, including aerosols, inside buildings. The multi-zone modeling method actually outperforms Computational Fluid Dynamics in the studies focused on long-term dynamic simulations for entire buildings including both mechanical ventilation and air infiltration, if the assumption of well mixed air is applicable. A few studies used multi-zone modeling to characterize temporal variation of air infiltration rates, and contaminant concentrations in actual buildings (Jareemit and Srebric, 2015; Srebric et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2018) . However, none of these studies conducted field experiments to simultaneously collect data on ventilation and track ARI incidence for occupants. The present study used two buildings with widely varying ventilation rates, one with mechanically driven high ventilation and another one with very low natural ventilation rates. In the two studied buildings, field experiments were carried out during the respiratory virus season from January 24th to May 18th, 2018, approximately four months. The data collection effort continuously monitored CO 2 concentrations with 154 sensors primarily located in dormitory rooms. At the same time, ARI incidence was tracked for 120 study participants among 755 students living in these two buildings, and a questionnaire on door/window opening was administered to ARI cases and their close contacts. Further, multi-zone models using CONTAM (Dols and Polidoro, 2015) were created and calibrated with the measured CO 2 data for the buildings. These models were further applied to calculate ventilation rates during the experimental time period. In this study, a ventilation rate refers to the rate of outside air entering the dormitory rooms in these buildings through both mechanical ventilation and infiltration. The multi-zone model for the building with low ventilation was further used to simulate the spread of influenza A viruses by bioaerosols, and the simulation results were compared to the cumulative incidence of viral ARIs confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay of nasal and throat swabs using a TaqMan Array Card assay (Thermo-Fisher, San Jose, CA) for a wide range of viral respiratory pathogens (Harvey et al., 2016) . The detailed methodology introduces the two dormitory buildings under investigation, the distributed CO 2 monitoring system, and the multi-zone models.
