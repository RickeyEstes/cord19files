This section illustrates the cruise operational process of this study, and then explains its mathematical formulation and estimation model to identify the efficiency determinants. The present research team checked the major items of the cruise companies financial statements carefully in detail for the consideration of selecting input, intermediate and output variables at the two stages. The first stage, "operating process", refers to the revenue-generating activities of the firms. In particular, payroll, operating, and administrative expenses, and depreciation turned out to be the major input variables in producing the outputs, such as ticket and onboard revenues and operating income. The payroll and related expenses are the payments for shipboard personnel, officers, deck and engine crew, and hotel and administrative employees. The payroll was separated from overall operating expenses to reflect the degree of customer service on board ship, e.g., more payroll implies the employment of more crewmembers, which improves the service quality (Teye & Leclerc, 1998) . Administrative expenses contain marketing, sales, and administration activity expenses, which are generated mainly via the shore side operation. Depreciation is allocated generally over the 30-year economic life span of the asset. The other operating expenses include the cost of passenger bookings, transportation expenses, commissions of travel agents, fees, taxes, and other charges. Ticket revenues comprise the sales of passenger tickets, and the air transportation to or from ships. A ticket price generally includes meals, accommodation, onboard entertainment, and some non-alcoholic beverages. Onboard revenues are the sales of goods and service onboard ships, which are not included in the ticket price. 1 The next stage, non-operating process, describes the performance of cruise lines in generating profits out of the earned income. Note that the operating income serves as an intermediate output, meaning that it mediates the first and second stages. The operating income is calculated by subtracting all expenses from the total revenue. The non-operating expense is also added to the second stage, which includes the net of interest expenses and other expenses. The result of the second stage operation is the net income. This refers to the remaining portion of the total revenue after excluding the total cruise operating expenses, total other operating expenses, total non-operating expenses, and income tax expenses.
