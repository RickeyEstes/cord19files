Mathematical treatments of indoor particle movements include: the Euler-Lagrange method and the Euler-Euler method. Each method has its own pros and cons [15, 16] . The Lagrangian approach considers the fluid phase as a continuum and predicts the trajectory of each discrete phase particle by integrating the force balance on the particle. The particle momentum equation can be expressed as: F drag andF grav can be written as ð18m=r p d 2 p C C ÞðŨ Àũ p Þ and gðr p À rÞ=r p , respectively, where the Cunningham correction to Stokes' drag law is computed from ½1 þ ð2l=d p Þð1:257þ 0:4 e Àð1:1dp=2lÞ Þ. The third term in Eq. (1) represents the additional forces exerted on the particles. In the current study, Brownian force, and Saffman's Lift force are taken into account in that they may be significant for fine particles. Thermophoretic force is included as well to reflect the non-isothermal condition. As the density ratio between particles and air is in the order of O(10 3 ), other forces, such as Basset force, pressure gradient force, virtual mass force, are neglected because their fraction inF addi is infinitesimal [17] . Detailed descriptions of these forces are available in the Fluent manual [8] . The effect of turbulence on particle dispersion is modeled by using a stochastic method, i.e. the discrete random walk (DRW) model to simulate the fluctuating velocity. Stochastic realizations of turbulence have been successfully applied in many works [18, 19] . The DRW model assumes turbulence is isotropic and the random velocity fluctuations follow a Gaussian probability distribution: The fluctuating velocities remain constant over a time interval that is the minimum between two time scales: the characteristic lifetime of the eddy and the time required by the particle to move across the eddy. This time interval is also called interaction time between the particle and eddies. The eddy life time is defined as: The crossing time is calculated by In a new interaction time, the particle is at a new location, and the calculation of the particle velocity and trajectory is continued using the new local instantaneous air velocities. The ordinary differential Eq. (1) is integrated with the fifthorder Runge-Kutta method. The particle motion is advanced with a time step which is one order of magnitude smaller than the crossing time. For the treatment of particle deposition at solid surfaces in Lagrangian method, particles reaching a wall surface are assumed to be trapped, meaning the calculation of trajectories is terminated. However, in DRW model isotropic turbulence assumption is not applicable at near-wall regions. In the boundary layer, velocity fluctuations in the direction normal to the wall are substantially smaller than in the spanwise and streamwise directions. Thus, isotropic decomposition of kinetic energy over-predicts the deposition rate of small particles [20, 21] . In this scenario, Reynolds stress model or LES are much more preferable [22] . If the flow field is simulated in the framework of two-equation models, to settle this problem Wang and James [23] developed the following equations to modify the turbulent kinetic energy for the first cells close to the wall: With the help of Eqs. (6) and (7), the near-wall kinetic energy is artificially reduced, prior to tracking the particles' trajectories. Its improvement on the prediction of deposition rate will be examined in the validation section. In the Eulerian approach, both the fluid phase and the particulate phase are treated as interpenetrating continua. In order to save computational load, a simplified Eulerian method, i.e. the drift-flux method, is used. In this model, a drift velocity consisting of gravitational setting and diffusion is taken into account between particles and bulk air. The governing equation for particle transport in turbulent flow is written as: The gravitational settling velocity of particles (Ṽ S ) is calculated by Stokes equation [11] . In view of that in the present study, the Reynolds number for particles is usually less than 1.0,Ṽ S equals C cḡ r p d 2 p =ð18mÞ. For particles with very small relaxation time, particle eddy diffusivity p approximates the carried fluid turbulent diffusivity n t [24] . Generally speaking, for particles larger than 1.0 mm, Bownian diffusion is much weaker than the turbulent diffusion and gravitational settling effect is significant. Therefore, in the implementation of Eq. (8), we replace rðD p þ p Þ by m eff . Eq. (8) is discretized directly into an algebraic equation by the finite volume method, which is unlike the other numerical treatment where the settling term rV S C is moved into the source term. For the boundary condition at walls, a semi-empirical deposition model by Lai and Nazaroff [25] is adopted, which is able to link the local airflow condition with the deposition process, by expressing the deposition velocity as a function of particle density, size, and friction velocity.
