Because nucleic acid extraction can be one of the factors that determine the efficiency of PCR amplification, 2 commercially available extraction methods were used in this study. One of the methods used a silica-based format (NucliSensR, bioMÃ©rieux) and the other was a magneticbased extraction technology (MagaZorbk). Our sensitivity results indicated that end-point titrations using RNA extracted by the MagaZorbk and NucliSensR were comparable using conventional and real-time PCR. The total time for extraction was 1.5 h with MagaZorbk kit compared with 2.5 h with the NucliSensR kit (based on 10 samples per run) and the amount of hands-on time was higher with the latter kit.
