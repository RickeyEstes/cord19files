Patients Sixty-seven patients (age range 21 -55 years; mean age 32.3 years) consisting of 55 women (age range 21 -55 years; mean age 32.9 years) and 12 men (age range 21 -52 years; mean age 28.5 years) who fitted the WHO case definition for SARS, 12 and who had also reported large joint pain during or after hospitalization were included in our study group. None of the patients had pre-SARS joint pain. The joint pain was discovered in a retrospective review of the notes, and occurred 12 -120 days after the onset of SARS (average 60.73 days). Except for one patient, all patients were hospital staff, and the majority were nurses. They were screened with plain radiographs of the affected joints. If no suitable reason was found for the pain (such as osteoarthritis or fractures), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination was undertaken on the affected joint (hip, knee or ankle) on the same day as plain radiograph. Informed consents were obtained from all the patients, and they could withdraw at any time. The antiviral agent, ribavirin, was administered to all patients, 750 mg daily for about 2 weeks, then taken orally 250 mg daily for 1 week. All patients were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (80 -800 mg daily) for 3 -20 consecutive days, 1 -11 days after the diagnosis of SARS was made, then oral prednisolone was given, they were managed conservatively with stepwise steroid withdrawal. The cumulative dosage of therapeutic doses was 4117.33 mg (range 640 -20,000 mg). None of the patients were alcoholics or intravenous drug users.
