Pre-filters and glass wool filters were eluted immediately in the laboratory upon receipt and the eluates concentrated by polyethylene glycol following standard elution and secondary concentration procedures (Lambertini et al., 2008; Millen et al., 2012) . Eluates or final concentrated sample volumes (FCSV) from a sample-paired pre-filter and glass wool filter were combined for qPCR analysis. FCSV volumes were between 0.9 mL and 57 mL (mean ¼ 7.4 mL) which were archived at À80 C until nucleic acid extraction. Extraction procedures were the same as those described previously (Corsi et al., 2014) except for the addition of an initial freeze-thaw step for extracting Cryptosporidium oocyst DNA (Giovanni and LeChevallier, 2005) . Real-time qPCR was performed for genes specific to eight human viruses, eight bovine viruses, four bacteria and two protozoa and is further described in supporting information (Text S4). All gene targets and references for primers and hydrolysis probes and standard curve performance parameters are listed in supporting information (Table S2) .
