We defined the three levels of influenza threshold based on the terminology used in the WHO manual and the existing Victorian surveillance thresholds that had been adapted from the United Kingdom: seasonal, average and alert [13, 34] . Seasonal threshold defines the start and end of an influenza season. The two intensity thresholds, termed average and alert thresholds, describe relative seasonal intensity. The WHO manual did not prescribe a specific method for determining the seasonal threshold, that is, the start of the season. We used the method of inspection of the complete data for the six datasets to determine the seasonal threshold. For each dataset this was done independently by four of the co-authors (ET, KG, AM, HK) and differences were resolved by discussion. For the four datasets that provided data for the whole year (MMDS, Lab data, VAED and MMDS composite), we calculated the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the metrics used for each dataset for the period defined as out-of-season, that is, the values below the seasonal threshold, that had been determined by inspection. We also explored the seasonal threshold using the 95th percentile of out-of-season data without assuming data were normally distributed. We then compared the seasonal threshold set by inspection with the 95% CI and 95th percentiles of the average out-of-season values. Average and alert thresholds were calculated for each dataset using a variation of the WHO protocol [7] (Figure 1 ). We first determined the median week of peak occurrence using historical data, excluding the pandemic year of 2009 which was atypical from both surveillance and testing perspectives [33] . We then aligned the transmission peaks around the median week of peak occurrence ( Figure 1A ) and calculated the weekly mean and standard deviations for each week centred on the median week of peak occurrence ( Figure 1B and C) . The WHO protocol suggests the use of the Normal distribution to assign thresholds based on the mean and standard deviation of the aligned data for weekly counts. However, we believed data were unlikely to be Normally distributed for all years and tested this by inspection and formally using the Shapiro-Wilks test for Normality for GPSS, MMDS, LAB data and the VAED for each year during season [35] . In addition to the mean and standard deviations, we explored the thresholds using the median and 90th and 95th percentiles. The average threshold was determined by a comparison of the peak weekly mean and median, while the alert threshold was determined by a comparison of the peak weekly upper 90% and 95% CI upper limits with the 90th and 95th percentiles. We also performed log transformation of all datasets and calculated the corresponding geometric mean and 90/95 CI upper limit.
