Aim of the present study was to address the questions whether HBoV can be detected in tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas, whether there is a correlation of HPV and HBoV infection in tonsillar tumors and whether both viruses infect the same cells. Furthermore, we cultivated primary keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes of tonsil tissue and infected them with virulent HBoV particles to ascertain which the target cells for virus replication are. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that the interaction between HBoV and the host genome, in concert with the fact that the viral replication is dependent on the DNA damage repair response (Deng et al., , 2017 , may influence the microsatellite stability in tonsillar tumors.
