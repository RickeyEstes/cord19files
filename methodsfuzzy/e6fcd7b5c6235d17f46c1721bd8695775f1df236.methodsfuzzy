From VIRsiRNAdb, 26 target sequences for 96 and 81 experimentally validated siRNAs for influenza A and B viruses, respectively, were downloaded on 23 September 2016. From the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource, 27 a total of ∼ 200 000 segment sequences derived from ∼ 25 000 influenza strains were obtained on 1 September 2015, and grouped according to host, serological type and isolated year (or month). We calculated occurrences of siRNA target sequences in each influenza virus genome. To prevent possible misassignment from a large number of pH1N1 strains, relatively small numbers of human classical H1N1 strains isolated from 2009 were omitted from the present analysis. From VIRsiRNAdb, target sequences for 4 siRNAs for EBOV were downloaded on 30 September 2016. EBOV genome sequences were downloaded from the NCBI Virus Variation Database 29 on 3 January 2016. Computer codes for the word count are available from KW (k_wada@nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp).
