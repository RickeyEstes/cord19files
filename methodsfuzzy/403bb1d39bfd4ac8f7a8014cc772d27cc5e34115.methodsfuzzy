Hence, health care personnel should have adequate knowledge for the selection and recommendation of different sterilization and disinfection methods (Tables 59.2 and 59.3) . A brief knowledge about the compatibility, toxicity, odor, and irritability due to various agents/methods is essential and useful for achieving adequate decontamination. The various chemicals used for the process of antisepsis or skin disinfection are chloroxylenols, anilides, hexachloraphene, polymeric biguanides, alexidine, diamidines, and triclosan.
