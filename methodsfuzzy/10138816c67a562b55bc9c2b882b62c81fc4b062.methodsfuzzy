A. Generalized SEIR model {S(t), P (t), E(t), I(t), Q(t), R(t), D(t)} denoting at time t the respective number of the susceptible cases, insusceptible cases, exposed cases (infected but not yet be infectious, in a latent period), infectious cases (with infectious capacity and not yet be quarantined), quarantined cases (confirmed and infected), recovered cases and closed cases (or death). The adding of a new quarantined sate is driven by data, which together with the recovery state takes replace of the original R state in the classical SEIR model. Their relations are given in Fig. 1 and characterized by a group of ordinary differential equations (or difference equations if we consider discrete time, see SI). Constant N = S + P + E + I + Q + R + D is the total population in a certain region. The coefficients {α, β, γ −1 , δ −1 , λ(t), κ(t)} represent the protection rate, infection rate, average latent time, average quarantine time, cure rate, and mortality rate, separately. Especially, to take the improvement of public health into account, such as promoting wearing face masks, more effective contact tracing and more strict locking-down 4 All rights reserved.

In this case, the basic reproduction It is noted that here we assume the cure rate λ and the mortality rate κ are both time dependent. As confirmed in Fig. 2a -d, the cure rate λ(t) is gradually increasing with the time, while the mortality rate κ(t) quickly decreases to less than 1% and becomes stabilized after Jan. 30th. This phenomenon is likely raised by the assistance of other emergency medical teams, the application of new drugs, etc. Furthermore, the average contact number of an infectious person is calculated in Fig. 2e-f and could provide some clue on the infection rate. It is clearly seen that the average contact number is basically stable over time, but shows a remarkable difference among various regions, which could be attributed to different quarantine policies and implements inside and outside Hubei (or Wuhan), since a less severe region is more likely to inquiry the close contacts of a confirmed case. A similar regional difference is observed for the severe condition rate too. In Fig. 2g -h, Hubei and Wuhan overall show a much higher severe condition rate than Shanghai. Although it is generally expected that the patients need a period of time to become infectious, to be quarantined, or to be recovered from illness, but we do not find a strong evidence for the necessity of including time delay (see SI for more details). As a result, the time-delayed equations are not considered in the current work for simplicity.
