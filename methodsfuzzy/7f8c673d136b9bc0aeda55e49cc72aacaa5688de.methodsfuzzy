The goal of this work is to identify the evolutionary differences between 2019-nCoV and the closest coronavirus species, human SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronavirus, and to predict their possible functional implications. To do so, we structurally characterize individual proteins as well as intra-viral and human-virus protein complexes, extract the information on their interaction interfaces and ligand binding, and superpose the evolutionary difference and conservation information with the binding information. Specifically, our integrative computational pipeline will include the following five steps.

Second, structural models of 2019-nCoV proteins are obtained using templatebased, or homology, modeling. Third, the protein-protein interaction complex structures of 2019-nCoV proteins interacting with each other and/or with the human proteins are determined using a multi-chain comparative modeling protocol. Fourth, the protein-binding sites will be extracted from the obtained models of protein-protein interaction complexes, and protein-ligand binding sites will be extracted from the evolutionary close coronavirus protein-ligand templates and mapped to the relevant structural models of 2019-nCoV through structural alignment. Fifth, the information on the evolutionary differences and conservations observed between the protein sequences of 2019-nCoV and the related coronaviruses and extracted from the above protein sequence alignments will mapped onto the structural models of the 2019-nCoV proteins to determine if the protein-and ligand-binding site are functionally conserved. Lastly, a joint human-virus and virus-virus interactome is predicted through homology and analyzed. All the obtained models and sequence alignments have been made publically available to the research community.
