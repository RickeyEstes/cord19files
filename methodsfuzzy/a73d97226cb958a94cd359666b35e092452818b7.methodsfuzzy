Reagents D609 was purchased from Calbiochem. Brefeldin A, Nocodazole, and Exo1 were purchased from Sigma. Golgicide A (GCA) was kindly provided by D. Haslam (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). BODIPY FL C5 Ceramide was obtained from Molecular Probes. Construction of Arf1-GFP, Arf1-mCherry, and GFP-GBF1 were previously described [82, 83] . CERT-GFP, CERT (D324A)-GFP, CERT (G67E)-GFP, HcRed-VAP-A, HA-CKIc2, and HPA-12 were kind gifts from K. Hanada (National Institute of Infectious Disease, Tokyo) and have been previously described [45, 59] . C-terminally V5-tagged SMS1 and SMS2 constructs were kind gifts from J. Holthuis (Utrecht University) and have been described previously [46] . C-terminally 3xFLAG-tagged SMS1 and SMS2 constructs were kind gifts from M. Tani (Kyushu University) and have been previously described Cell culture and C. trachomatis propagation HeLa 229 cells and L929 cells were obtained from ATCC and passaged as previously described [85] . LY-A and LY-A/hCERT cells were obtained from RIKEN BRC through the National Bio-Resource Project of MEXT, Japan and have been previously described [43, 66] . CHO cells were maintained at 37uC with 5% CO 2 in Ham's F12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). C. trachomatis serovar L2 (LGV 434) and D (UW3-Cx) were propagated in L929 cells. C. trachomatis EBs were harvested from infected cells and purified using a Renografin step-gradient as described [86] . Unless otherwise indicated, experiments were performed with serovar L2.
