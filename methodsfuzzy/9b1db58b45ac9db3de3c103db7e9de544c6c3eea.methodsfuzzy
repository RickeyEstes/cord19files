Contemporary GPs are very new to China, a large and diverse country with complex histories and traditions. As a new phenomenon, there are many unknowns and a dearth of reliable data about GPs that would allow us to conduct rigorous quantitative analysis. Our study employs a mixed methods approach deemed most appropriate to examine the breadth and depth of understanding of GPs by PITs in Henan. 6 7 The participants of the study are the PITs in Henan Province. Henan is located in central China and represents the middle of China's 31 provincial level jurisdictions in terms of economic development ( Figure 2 ). As the second most populous province in China, Henan is one of the key loci for the GP capacity building. For instance, the TRUMP students in Henan, a single province, account for around 10% of the whole country's TRUMP students.
