Bat guano was collected from three sites in Turkestan Oblast from 11 April to 16 May 2017. These sites were the Kepterkhan tunnel and Qaraungir cave in Tulkibas Rayon District, with additional guano collected in the Ungirli cave in Altyntau, Sozak Rayon ( Figure 1 ). Bat feces were collected from plastic sheets placed underneath bat roosts. Multiple fecal pellets were placed into cryovials with viral transport media using polyester swabs, which were subsequently placed into a liquid-nitrogen dry shipper and then transferred back to the Research Institute for Biological Safety Problems (RIBSP) in Gvardeiskiy, Kazakhstan, where all samples were stored at −80 • C. Bat guano was vortexed for 30 s and RNA was extracted using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Coronavirus nucleic acid was amplified using pan-coronavirus primers that amplified a 440-bp region of the RNA-dependent reverse polymerase (RdRp) (PanCor IN-6: GGTTGGGACTATCCTAAGTGTGA and PanCor IN-7: CCATCATCAGATAGAATCATCATA). A PCR was run using a Superscript III one-step RT-PCR system with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a Rotorgene thermocycler (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The reaction consisted of 2 µL of RNA, 12.5 µL of 2× reaction buffer, 1 µL of reverse transcriptase, 1 µM of forward and reverse primer, and water to a total of 25 µL. The thermocycler protocol followed a previously described protocol with the reverse transcription (RT) step held at 56 • C for 20 min, followed by a denaturation step at 94 • C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of 94 • C for 15 s, 56 • C for 30 s, and 68 • C for 1 min, with a 5-min extension period at 68 • C [17] . PCR products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. A positive control, an RdRp sequence from human coronavirus 229E in a p-GEM T-Easy plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), was run with each set of reactions. Positive samples with the appropriate amplicon size were purified and sequenced at RIBSP using the Genetic Analyzer 3130xl (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA) with a Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit, v. 3.1 (Thermofisher). Electropherograms were inspected in Geneious v11 [18] . A total of 12 RdRp sequences were newly generated from this study. To further understand the evolutionary relationships of these viruses, we analyzed novel bat coronavirus sequences in combination with 2811 RdRp sequences of coronavirus from different host species worldwide, representing the three genera: Alpha-, Beta-, and Gamma-coronaviruses. Global RdRp sequences were downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information sequence database (GenBank) and aligned using Transalign [19] . This large dataset was manually aligned and further down-sampled to 248 sequences to reduce redundant and similar sequences. Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of the partial RdRp gene (460 bp) was reconstructed by RAxML; GTR + GAMMA was selected for the model of nucleotide substitution as it allows rate heterogeneity among sites, as implemented in Geneious v11 [20] . Branch support was assessed using 1000 bootstrap replicates; bootstrap values greater than 50% were indicated at major nodes.
