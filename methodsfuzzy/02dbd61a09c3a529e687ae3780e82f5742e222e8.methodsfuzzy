The premise of the MFR approach is that the PDB is so vast today that its content gives an excellent coverage of local structural features of naturally occurring proteins. This approach was first applied in crystallography for building molecular fragments into crystallographically determined electron density [45] . A later NMR study demonstrated that with about four RDCs per residue, it is possible to determine the backbone structure of ubiquitin using molecular fragments that fit to RDCs [46] . Moreover, fragment searches that combine chemical shift and RDC have been implemented in the CS-Rosetta structure modeling software and demonstrated to be effective in solving water-soluble protein structures [47] . In case of the MFR study of UCP2, a large fragment library containing 7-residue fragments from $1500 protein structures was constructed, and from the library, a set of candidate fragments with good RDC fitting (Q free ) and the correct alignment tensor values was found for every possible 7-residue sequence of UCP2 that has sufficiently dense RDC data. The candidate fragments were assigned to the protein sequence and this step is referred to as fragment assignment (Figure 3b ). The next procedure was building longer structured segments based on the assigned 7-residue stretches using two operations: end extension and gap filling. End extension is extending the N-terminal or C-terminal ends of a structurally assigned segment along the protein sequence by searching for unused candidate fragments that overlap with the segment in backbone dihedral angles, and that provide the best Q free for the final extended segment. Similarly, Gap filling is to fill gap regions (<4 residues) between two structurally assigned segments by searching for fragments that overlap in backbone dihedral angles with the two flanking segment and that provide good Q free for the merged segment.
