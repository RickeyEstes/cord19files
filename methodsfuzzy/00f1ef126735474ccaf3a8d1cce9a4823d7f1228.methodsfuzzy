Apparatus and Reagents. Cyclic voltammetry, controlled-potential coulometry and preparative electrolysis were performed using a Zahner pp201 potentiostat/galvanostat. Macro-scale electrolysis and controlled-potential coulometry were carried out with a three electrode system, using a Behpajooh C 2056 potentiostat equipped with a digital coulometer. The working electrode used in the voltammetry experiments was a glassy carbon disc (1.8 mm 2 area) and platinum wire was used as counter electrode. The working electrode used in controlled-potential coulometry and synthesis was an assembly of three ordinary soft carbon plates (20 mm length, 10 mm width and 40 mm height), and large stainless steel cylinder (25 cm 2 area) constituted the counter electrode. The working electrode potentials were measured versus Ag/AgCl (all electrodes from AZAR electrode). The electrochemical synthesis was performed under controlled-potential condition in a simple cell equipped with a magnetic stirrer. More details are described in our previous paper 36 . p-Methylaminophenol (MAP), p-toluenesulfinic acid, benzensulfinic acid, p-chlorosulfinic acid, methanesulfinic acid, phosphoric acid and ethanol were obtained from commercial sources. These chemicals were used without further purification. The glassy carbon electrode was polished using alumina slurry (from Iran Alumina Co.). Antibacterial Susceptibility Assay: The samples were tested to determine the antibacterial susceptibility by Kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. Escherichia coli (E. coli) ATCC 35218 (gram negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus) ATCC 6538 (gram positive) were used as test organisms. First, the colony of the bacterias of this study were cultured in the sterile Nutrient Broth and after 18-24 hours incubation at 37 °C microbial suspension was prepared from each bacteria balanced with turbusion 0.5 McFarland standard to 1.5 × 10 8 cfu.ml −1 with distillated water and was cultured on Muller Hinton agar (MHA) (Merck, KGaA) culture condition in the form of lawn culture. To solve the present samples, dimethyl sulfoxide 10% in distillated water was used. Then 5 mg from each sample was poured on sterile blank discs, and after setting discs in aseptic conditions on cultured Muller Hinton, bacterias were incubated 24 hours at 37 °C in the presence of studied derivatives. Afterwards, the diameter of the inhabitation zone surrounding of the discs were measured by special ruler. Also, to study the lack of influence of the solution containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide on the bacterias of the study, 20 microlitre of the solution was poured on the discs and set on cultured Muller Hinton agar and incubated.
