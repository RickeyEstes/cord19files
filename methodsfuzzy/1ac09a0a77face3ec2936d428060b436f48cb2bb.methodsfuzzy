Standardization of the volume used for cytologic evaluation may be of benefi t in minimizing analytic variation and aid in interpretation, although evaluation of multiple preparations or preparations from larger volumes of CSF may increase the likelihood of detection of minor abnormalities. Because CSF is normally of low cellularity and increases in cellularity may not result in large numbers of cells, concentration of the cells is required. Cytocentrifugation, sedimentation, or membrane fi ltration techniques may be used for concentration of cells. Cytocentrifugation is most commonly available in reference or commercial laboratories in which the volume of submissions justifi es purchase of specialized equipment. The membrane fi ltration technique requires special staining that is not commonly available in practice, but which may be available at some reference or commercial laboratories. Several sedimentation techniques have been described and are suitable for use in practice or commercial or reference laboratories to which rapid submission of CSF specimens is possible (Cook and DeNicola, 1988; Parent and Rand, 1994) . Readers are referred to these sources for more detail on construction of a sedimentation ap paratus and preparation of sedimentation specimens. A sample device is demonstrated in Fig. 14  Sedimentation preparations should be made if a specimen cannot be delivered immediately to the laboratory for cytologic processing. Prepared slides can then be sent to a commercial or reference laboratory for interpretation or stained and evaluated by clinicians at the practice. Cytocentrifuge or sedimentation preparations are most commonly air-dried and stained with Romanowsky stains that are commonly available in commercial or reference laboratories and clinical practice laboratories. Membrane-fi ltration specimens require wet-fi xation and stains appropriate for this method, commonly Papanicolaou, Trichrome, or H & E. Wet-fi xation and these staining methods may also be used on cytocentrifuge or sedimentation preparations and are appropriate for formalin-or alcohol-fi xed specimens. Cytocentrifuge or membrane-fi ltration preparatory and staining techniques may vary with laboratory, technical training, and pathologist preference. Summaries of cytopreparatory and staining techniques for cytospin and membrane fi ltration specimens and specimens fi xed in formalin or alcohol are available from a variety of sources. Interested readers are referred to Keebler and Facik (2008) as a recent comprehensive review. Special stains may be indicated in some cases. Gram stain may be useful for confi rmation and identifi cation of categories of bacteria. India ink or new methylene blue preparations have been reported to be helpful in identifi cation of fungal infections, especially cryptococcosis. Periodic acid-Schiff stain may be used to demonstrate positive intracellular material in dogs with globoid cell leukodystrophy. Luxol fast blue can be used to demonstrate myelin in CSF specimens (Mesher et al., 1996) .
