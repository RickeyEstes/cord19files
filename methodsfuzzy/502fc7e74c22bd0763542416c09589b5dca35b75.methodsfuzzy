The in silico description of the movement of NS5A is built on three basic components: • Experimental data for the dynamics: FRAP time series data [34] recorded the intracellular dynamics of NS5A movement [10] at perinuclear zones. These data report the dynamics of NS5A under a variety of biological conditions. Namely we consider two different cell types explained in detail below. • Geometric setup: We use previously published confocal microscopic microscopy z-stack data [5] of cells labeled with ER markers which allow for reconstructions of realistic ER surfaces. These fine level data provide the geometric constraints for NS5A movement. • A model and corresponding simulations: Our previous model of NS5A dynamics [35] has not been adapted to biological data so far. In this study, we perform simulations using an extended version of the model and fit the simulation parameters in order to match the experimental data. In the below, we describe these components in greater detail i.e. the FRAP time series experimental data, realistic ER geometry reconstructions, and we provide a short summary on NS5A movement properties that underpin the model we describe as basis for the sPDE simulations of NS5A dynamics (introduced by us recently [35] ).
