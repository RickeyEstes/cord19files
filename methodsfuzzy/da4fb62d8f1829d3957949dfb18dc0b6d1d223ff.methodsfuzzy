Li et al. reviewed the evidence for the effects of ventilation on the transmission of infectious diseases. 66 They concluded that there was good evidence (as demonstrated by the contemporary technology available at the time of the studies) for aerosol transmission influenced by ventilation factors in outbreaks involving measles, 133 chickenpox, 134 the pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae), 135 SARS-CoV, 1e5 tuberculosis, 136,137 influenza 138, 139 and smallpox. 140 Therefore, from this and other studies reviewed here, it should be possible to reduce the risk of aerosol transmission by altering ventilation parameters in healthcare environments. For short-range aerosol transmission exposures, personal protective equipment (PPE; i.e. gowns, gloves and facemasks) is recommended in addition to the usual contact-transmission prevention precautions (i.e. handwashing, avoiding touching mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth) to protect susceptible healthcare workers. Seto et al. performed a study on the effectiveness of masks in reducing infection during the SARS outbreak, and found that surgical masks were effective in reducing infection from SARS to a certain extent. 141 However, with more infectious diseases such as TB, measles or chickenpox, a surgical mask alone may be insufficient aerosol protection, and masks with built-in filters, i.e. filtered face piece masks, may be required. Droplet nuclei produced during respiration, talking, coughing and sneezing from such patients are very small, less than 5 mm in diameter, and behave similarly to smoke particles in air. 142 Where susceptible hosts are widely separated in an indoor space, the potential for airborne transmission depends partially on the ventilation system present. In the community, some studies during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong suggested that the use of facemasks and covering the mouth when sneezing may have contributed to an overall reduction in the incidence of viral respiratory infections at this time. 143, 144 For the control of long-range aerosol transmission, the architecture of the healthcare facilities requires consideration. Hospital rooms are connected by doorways, corridors, stairwells and lift shafts. Small pressure differences, induced by natural forces such as thermal buoyancy due to air temperature differences, the wind or mechanical fans, can generate air flows that move air from one room to another. These air flows are very sensitive to doors or windows being kept open, e.g. although opening a window can enhance natural ventilation, this can change the air pressure in neighbouring rooms and corridors, reducing, or even reversing, airflow directions ( Figure 4 ). This highlights the importance of keeping isolation room windows and doors closed. The use of air filtration aims to reduce airborne concentrations to well below their infectious dose. Besides simply increasing the number of air changes per hour, there are other ways in which manipulation of air flows can be used to reduce the spread of airborne infection in an indoor environment such as a hospital. One main difficulty in designing ventilation systems for removing airborne pathogens is due to the fact that air flow is generally turbulent. In a hospital environment, if a ventilation system can ensure that the inhaled air for each individual mainly consists of fresh outdoor air, the system would be considered effective as the purpose of ventilation is to protect individuals from inhaling hazardous, infectious air. 145 This principle can be broken down into three approaches, as follows. e Mixing of the contaminated air with uncontaminated air in the room, reducing the peak concentrations of droplet nuclei in the contaminated air. Over time, the average concentration of the droplet nuclei in the room will increase, unless the air is filtered. e Diluting contaminated air using 'fresh' (uninfected) air. Current recommendations of ventilation flow rate in various different guidelines for hospital ventilation and isolation room designs are based on the principle of dilution. 146 A ventilation flow rate of at least 12 air changes (of a room)/h is suggested for new isolation rooms (constructed since 2001). Existing isolation rooms (constructed before 2001) may still use six air changes/h. 89, 147 e Controlling the air flow so that it moves from healthcare workers to patient. This requires putting patients and exhaust vents in close proximity. Practically, there are at least two commonly used air distribution systems in general hospital wards. These are the mixing ventilation and displacement ventilation systems ( Figure 6 ).
