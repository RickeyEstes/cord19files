Localization sites. The localization sites considered in this study are cytoplasm (one site), nucleus (one site), mitochondrion (four sites), chloroplast (three sites), peroxisome (one site), endoplasmic reticulum (two sites), Golgi complex (one site), lysosome (two sites), vacuole (one site), plasma membrane (two sites), and extracellular space (one site). They are summarized in Table 1 . For proteins from animal cells, the lysosome is added to the repertoire, whereas the vacuole is added for plant and yeast proteins. The chloroplast, which is divided into three sites, is also included in plant proteins. Cytoplasmic proteins include cytoskeletal ones. Peroxisomal proteins include socalled microbody proteins, but those of trypanosomes are excluded. GPI-anchored plasma membrane proteins are treated separately from other integral membrane proteins because the prediction logic is different. There is some ambiguity in the definition of protein localization sites. For example, some proteins have more than one localization site (see Discussion). Peripheral membrane proteins are distinguished from integral membrane proteins and we define their localization sites to be the spaces toward which the membrane surfaces face. Some proteins become soluble after specific proteolytic processing reactions in the membrane-bound precursor form. In the present work, we regard them as membrane proteins unless the reaction is coupled with the translocation process. Sequence data. The amino acid sequence data of known localization sites were collected from the NBRF-PIR database, release 27.0 (Barker et al., 1990) . The total of 401 sequences can be obtained from Kenta Nakai (e-maih nakai Â® nibb.ac.jp). Except for some proteins in which the N-terminal methionine was removed, all sequences were in the genetically coded (unprocessed) KANEHISA form. To eliminate redundant data, these sequences have been selected from the original database such that there were no pairs with more than 50% identical residues. Exceptions were a few isozymes localizing at different sites or with apparently different localization mechanisms. We divided our dataset into training data for extracting knowledge and testing data for evaluating the prediction ability. When a localization site contained more than 10 proteins, 30% of them were used as testing data; the remainder were used as training data. When proteins at a certain site were divided into groups sorted by different pathways, testing data were selected proportionally. The number of proteins in each category of our dataset is summarized in Table 1 . Terminology [or sorting signals. There is as yet no consensus for the terminology of various sorting signals. We adopted Varshavsky's (1991) proposal for a systematic naming method. This naming convention, as well as part of our own, is shown in Table 2 . Expert system. The architecture of our expert system is the same as that previously reported (Nakai and Kanehisa, 1991) . It is a commonly used production system consisting of if-then rules, organized in a manner similar to the design of Tanaka and Shimoi (1987) . The core of our system is written in the programming language OPS83, version 3.0 (Forgy, 1989) . The knowledge base is divided into three modules, corresponding to the order of reasoning steps. In the first module, rules are organized for classifying organism names into one of the five categories: Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, yeast, animal, or plant. The second and third modules contain rules for sorting signals, the second containing general rules and the third containing more specialized rules. This distinction is somewhat arbitrary, but the reasoning with more specialized rules is performed after the general reasoning step. The calculations involving sequence data are written in C language and are called from rules when necessary. The flow of reasoning occurs in a backward fashion; each localization site of the repertoire is activated one by one as a hypothesis and the rules for examining sequence characteristics for each localization site are invoked to verify the hypothesis. Thus, given the amino acid sequence and the organism name, our expert system reports a list of probable localization sites with certainty factors. Discriminant analysis. Occasionally, we use the method called stepwise discriminant analysis Kanehisa, 1988, 1991) for deriving an optimal combination of various sequence features. Suppose, for example, proteins sorted to a certain localization site have amino acid compositions different from those of proteins sorted to another site. Using 20 amino acid contents as variables, the stepwise discriminant analysis determines the set of coefficients that maximally discriminates the two groups. The derived discriminant function is represented by the formula y = ~ alx i + const, i where x i is the variables to be selected (say, 20 amino acid contents) and as and const are the coefficients. When used for prediction, each unknown sequence is classified into one of the two groups according to the sign of this function. To avoid excessive dependence on training data, the stepwise procedure is usually not repeated until all 20 coefficients are determined. It is possible to regard the order of selection of variables as corresponding roughly to the order of their importance. Other analytical methods: (i) Hydrophobic moment. The hydrophobic moment is calculated according to Eisenberg's (1984) method. The amplitude of the moment with a given angle is calculated as the average value over 11 residues around each position in the sequence. The maximum value and its position may be used as variables for discriminant analysis. (ii) The "apolar' algorithm. The algorithm we used to detect an apolar region is as follows. First, we define, somewhat arbitrarily, an index for the apolar value of each amino acid: Translocation from cytosol into nucleus (nuclear localization signal) Translocation from cytosol into peroxisome Translocation from cytosol into endoplasmic reticulum (signal sequence) Retention in endoplasmic reticulum (for the lumen or membrane) Generation of GPI-anchor after the cleavage (also a degron?) Golgi-mediated generation of Man6P residues; may be identical with the signal for transfer from trans-Golgi to lysosomes Translocation from cytosol into chloroplast stroma Translocation from chloroplast stroma (S) into thylakoid space (T) a Modified and extended version of Varshavsky's (1991) proposal. than -5.0. The output is the segment corresponding to the best sum value. (iii) The "alom'" algorithm. Transmembrane segments in membrane proteins were detected by the alom program (Klein et al., 1985) . It is based on a discriminant function between integral and peripheral membrane proteins, applied to all 17 residue segments in the sequence.
