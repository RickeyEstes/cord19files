The following is by no means an attempt to cover all published pro cedures or variants of techniques. Many publications may not be mentioned, but it is attempted to take up the principal features of a number of available methods. It seems unfortunate that so many descriptions do not contain any indication why this particular pro cedure were preferred rather than another. Some publications, e.g. Bertucci and co-workers (19 77), report the use of a high amount of antibiotics. The methods employing sonica tion or blending this treatment apparently is sufficient to de contaminate, but Lund and Hedstrom (1966) found that 10 per cent of samples were still contaminated after sonication. Direct inoculation. Bertucci and co-workers (19 77) seeded samples with high concentrations of virus, so that they could expect proper recovery even if not quantitative method was available for concentra tion. They sonicated the samples and found 80-120 per cent recovery. Sanders and co-workers (1979) centrifuged their samples, tested the supernatant directly and resuspended the.solids. No real estima tion of the efficiency is given. Fenters and co-workers (i979)prefer cen trifugation at 20,000 g to obtain sludge supernatants that were employed as seeded samples. Lund (1971)  Wellings and co-workers (19 75, 19 76) pretreat with beef extract at pH 9, sonicate, stir for 18 hours and fluorocarbon treat in a blendor. Ward, Ashley and Moseley (1976) and employ sonication with 0.1-0.2 sodium dodecyl sulphate. No loss in recovery was found, when virus was mixed in raw sludge, but a loss of 25-50% occurred with digested sludge. Balluz and co-workers (19 77) centrifuged at 1500 g. The supernatant was tested and the solids resuspended and sonicated. Elution at high pH. Moore and co-workers (19 74) eluted with borate buffer at pH 9.0. Subrahmanyan (1977) found that pH 9.5 was the best because virus became inactivated at higher pH and virus was not recovered at lower pH. Tierny and co-workers (19 77) studied virus contaminated vegetables. They were extracted at pH 8.5 and clarified through glass wool and membrane filtered. Gerba and co-workers (19 79) studied virus recovery from marine sedi ments. As direct inoculation would only work with heavily polluted sample they eluted with glycine at pH 11.5, concentrated at pH 3.5 and eluted the filtered material with glycine at pH 11.5. None of the methods described are yet supported by large amounts of data and few studies are available that compare the efficiency of one method with another under the same conditions. There are many indications that solid-associations vary in different types of ma terials and that components in the samples influence desorption and also the sensitivity of the cell cultures. Determinations of plaque forming units are in some cases less than optimal and although some methods give good quantitative recovery with known amounts of exogenously added viruses, it is most diffi cult to evaluate whether they are quantitative when employed on field samples. It is suspected that they may be much less efficient for some types of samples. A virus isolation cannot be regarded finished before identification is made. There is a danger that re ported virus plaques are false positives. In a report (Jakubowski, 19 79) where alkaline (pH 10.5) elution is used followed by freon treatment and hydro extraction and a final sonification is employed all the 58 plaques demonstrated in the material proved to be nega tive on passage. It seems to be a warning signal that even a very careful procedure may lead into a very difficult situation. Direct inoculation often seems advantageous and probably always should be carried out. The virus level may, however, be so low that a concentration procedure is required. From for instance the work of Tierny and co-workers (1977) the relation between virus level and recovery efficiency is pointed out: A good recovery (80%) was reported when soil and plants were inoculated with 10 PFU per 100 g, but the efficiency of the method, which includes filterinq of samples through 0.45 um filter membranes, but did not include elu tion of any kind, decreased with decreasing virus load. It is re ported that the method worked well at 100 PFU per 100 g. Below that level the efficiency decreased and at 10 PFU per 100 g no virus was detected. None of the methods studied have employed more than a few virus types. Gayal and Gerba (19 79) observed a great deal of variability in the way various viruses adsorb to soil, even strain differences were found. It must be assumed that viruses may vary in a corre sponding way when elution is attempted. In our efforts to obtain good recovery from solids we should, however, stop and think if it matters too much if we get 30 per cent or 99.8 per cent recovery. As long as legislation mentioning exact limits for this or that is forced upon us we can probably accept such a situation. A grave problem is the fact that it is only a few virus types or families we have methods for. Goyal and Gerba (1979) have worked a little with a simian rotavirus and Smith and Gerba (1980) have de-tected rotaviruses in wastewater. That is a beginning. We are at a point where we have to admit that from many points of very the realitively easily grown enteroviruses are may be not the most im portant ones to detect. We now know that we have a need for methods for hepatitis virus, coronavirus, parvovirus in addition to the ones working for reo and adenoviruses. Suitable cultivation methods are not yet ready, but the importance of a number of newer viruses for gastroentestinal troubles in man and animals is recognized.  


Section:methods for virus recovery from solids
Section:, damgaard-larsen and co workers (1977) and others have preferred direct inoculations. samples have often been toxic to cell cultures and required special care, but in many cases at least as high virus yield has been ob tained with direct inoculations than with other methods. blending or sonication. foliquet and doncoeur (19 72) homogenized their samples and inoculated the supernatant after centrifugation at 3,(x)0 rpm/min. they did not find any toxic effects, but do not discuss efficiency of recovery. moore and co-workers (19 78) homo genized, centrifuged and rehomogenized, but they found 90 per cent of the virus in the first run.
Section:hurst and co-workers (1978) demonstrated a very high adsorption to sludge of seeded enterovirus and confirmed that elution with glycine buffer at ph 11.5 is highly efficient for enteroviruses. their method calls for two elution steps with an acid flocculation or aluminum flocculation in between. with seeded preparations 80 per cent recovery could be obtained.
