Data was analyzed using STATA 10.1 (College Station, Texas). Demographics were analyzed using descriptive analysis. Frequency, incidence and jackknife 95% confidence interval were calculated overall and individually for age and gender subgroups. Cox regression models were used to determine independent risk factors for illness overall and for virus-specific infections. An indicator term was included in the Cox regression models to adjust for respiratory season and robust standard errors were used to account for multiple illnesses per child. Differences in the presence and duration of symptoms up to 10 days were evaluated using Generalized Estimating Equations with a robust estimator, accounting for multiple illnesses in individual children as described previously. 12 The prevalence of each respiratory virus at enrollment of asymptomatic children was compared to the prevalence at each child's first RTI using McNemar's test. A two-sided p value of <0.05 was considered significant. In analyzing viral loads, the maximal viral load for each discrete illness episode was utilized.
