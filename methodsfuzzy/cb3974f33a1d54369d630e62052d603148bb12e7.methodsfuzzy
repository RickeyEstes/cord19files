In 2019, we were involved in two events of pangolin rescues, one involved with 21 smuggling pangolins in March and the second with 6 smuggling pangolins in July. From those pangolins failed to be rescued, we collected samples from different tissues and subjected for metagenomic analyses. Through viral metagenomics analyses of lower respiratory tract samples from these pangolins, we detected coronavirus in three individual animals [11] . Two of these animals were from the first batch of Malayan pangolins intercepted by Meizhou, Yangjiang, and Jiangmen customs, and the third one was from the second batch in a freight being transported from Qingyuan to Heyuan. The RNA samples from these three individuals were subjected to deep sequencing. To determine the read abundance of coronaviruses in each sample, we mapped clean reads without ribosomes and host sequences to an in-house virus reference data separated from the GenBank non-redundant nucleotide database. Genomic assembly and sequence analyses. After examining the high similarity among the samples from three animals, to maximize the coverage of the virus genome, clean reads from three animals were pooled together and de novo assembled using MEGAHIT v1. 2.9 [19] . The assembled contigs were used as references for mapping those the rest unmapped reads using Salmon v0.14. 1 [20] , and multiple rounds were implemented to maximize the mapping (Table S2) . A total of 38 contigs were identified to be highly similar to the 2019-nCoV genome (accession MN908947.3) using BLASTn and tBLASTx. GapFiller v1.10 and author/funder. All rights reserved.
