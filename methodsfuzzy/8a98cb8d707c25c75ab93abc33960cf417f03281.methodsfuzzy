Study patients were either admitted directly or referred to the Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit at the North University Hospital in Marseilles, France, from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2003. The unit was originally located at the HouphouÃ«t-Boigny Hospital. When this hospital closed by the end of 2000, the unit moved to the North Hospital, which is located however, near the previous one. The North Hospital is an 800-bed universityaffiliated teaching hospital, and the Tropical Diseases Unit is currently the reference center for tropical diseases in Marseilles, southern France. Only adults and children older than 15 years old are hospitalized in this unit. Younger children are hospitalized in the pediatric unit. 4 Data were collected prospectively in medical records, and included a standard questionnaire completed by medical students and attending physicians. Patients were included in the study if they were hospitalized with fever during the study period, and had a history of travel and/or residence in a tropical country in the 6 months prior to admission or claimed that their symptoms were related to a travel with no limit of time. All investigations were ordered at the discretion of the attending physician. However, in 2002 a systematic procedure for laboratory investigation was used for all patients (C. Foucault, unpublished). The benefit of such a procedure will be discussed elsewhere. Patients were classified as 'travelers', 'expatriates', 'migrants' and 'visitors'. We defined travelers, people born and living in France or in Europe whose illness was acquired when they were outside of the country for the purpose of tourism and/or business. 'Expatriates' were those who were born in metropolitan France or in Europe and whose illness was acquired while they were living in a tropical country for the purpose of work. 'Migrants' were those who were born overseas, were permanently residing in metropolitan France at the time of admission, and whose illness was acquired when they returned to tropical countries. Finally, 'visitors' were those who were born and were living outside France and whose illness was acquired while they were staying in a tropical country including their own country, and diagnosed while they were visiting France. Countries were assigned the following broad regional classification if they were situated within the following areas: North Africa; sub-Saharan Africa including West Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa; Indian Ocean including the Union of the Comoros (formerly named Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros), Mayotte Island (French territory) and Madagascar; Asia including the Middle East, Southeastern Asia, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent; Oceania; Latin America including Central and South America; and the West Indies. For all patients included in the study the variables collected are listed below: age; sex; country of origin; country of current residence; travel history; antimalarial chemoprophylaxis; time interval between the onset of fever and admission to hospital; time interval between date of return of and onset of fever; and principal diagnosis at discharge. For malaria cases, the regimen used to treat the patients was recorded. Diagnoses were established by demonstration of microorganism(s) in a clinically relevant specimen or by seroconversion to an infectious disease agent that was considered to be responsible of the travel-related illness. If a specific organism could not be identified, a clinical diagnosis was assigned. Malaria cases were recorded as uncomplicated or severe according the WHO definition. 5 By reviewing medical records, information was recorded on a standard format and analysed by Epi Info, version 6 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA). Statistical significance was determined by use of the c 2 test and the Fisher exact test.
