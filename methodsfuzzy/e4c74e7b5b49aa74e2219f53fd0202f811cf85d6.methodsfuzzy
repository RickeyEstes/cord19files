Cell lines and reagents. Vero E6 or BGM cells were cultured using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin, and maintained at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . BGM(S1-10) cells, which express GFP(S1-10) and the puromycin resistance gene (Pac), have been described in reference 21. BGM(S1-10) cell culture medium was supplemented with an additional 30 g/ml puromycin as a selection agent. Viruses and infection. CVB3 3A(S11aa2), which encodes a 3A with the S11 region of GFP inserted after amino acid position 2, has been described in (21) . CVB3 wild type (wt; strain Nancy) was generated as described in reference 19. For infection, cells were inoculated for 1 h with CVB3 wt or CVB3 3A(S11) at MOIs of 50 and 5, respectively, after which the inoculum was removed and fresh medium was added. At specified time points after infection, cells were imaged by light microscopy and/or prepared for electron microscopy by chemical fixation. Live-cell imaging. BGM(S1-10) cells were grown to ϳ35% confluence in glass-bottom 4-chamber 35-mm dishes (CELLview) and transduced with murine leukemia virus (MLV) mCherry-GM130 particles (described in reference 21). Transduced cells were infected with CVB3 3A(S11) 18 to 24 h later. Cells were washed with FluoroBrite medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 25 mM HEPES just prior to imaging. LM data were collected using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope Sites of Enterovirus Replication Organelle Biogenesis ® equipped with a HyD detector and a 63ϫ (1.4 numerical aperture [NA]) oil immersion objective, with the confocal pinhole adjusted to 1 airy unit for GFP emission (95.56-m pinhole). For time-series imaging, positions of interest (xyz) were marked and imaged sequentially at 5-min intervals. For the duration of all imaging, cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in a live-cell chamber. For correlative light and electron microscopy, cells were grown in glass-bottom MatTek dishes with an etched alphanumeric coordinate system (MatTek Corporation) to facilitate the relocation of the regions identified during light microscopy. Cells were monitored until the point of interest, at which time a confocal z-stack was acquired, after which samples were immediately fixed for electron microscopy. To minimize the time between the first image acquisition of each z-stack and fixation (ca. 10 min total), one field of view was imaged per sample. Lipid droplet visualization and quantification. Vero E6 cells grown on coverslips were infected with CVB3 wt (MOI 100) and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at different infection times. Mock-infected cells were also fixed as a control. After washing with PBS, the coverslips were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a freshly prepared mixture of Oil Red O (Sigma) (0.5% [wt/vol] in isopropanol) and double-distilled water (6:10) to stain LDs, washed with PBS, and incubated with the nuclear stain Hoechst. The samples were then imaged in a Leica DM6 wide-field microscope with a 40ϫ oil immersion objective using both differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence imaging modes. LDs appeared as darkly stained circular profiles in the DIC images that were absent in unstained samples and could be also detected in fluorescent images using a Texas Red excitation filter (540 to 580 nm) (31) . A total of 25 cells per condition were randomly selected from the DIC images, and the LDs contained in those cells were counted and manually segmented from the fluorescent images using Amira 6.0.1 (Thermo Fisher), which was further used to compute the LD area per cell. Electron microscopy. (i) Preparation of chemically fixed samples. Sample fixation, staining, and embedding procedures were adapted from reference 32. Cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% formaldehyde in 0.15 M cacodylate buffer for 60 min at room temperature. Initial postfixation was carried out using a solution of 2% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferricyanide in 0.15 M cacodylate for 60 min on ice. Samples were then treated with 1% aqueous thiocarbohydrazide for 20 min, followed by 2% aqueous osmium tetroxide for 30 min, and were finally incubated overnight at 4°C in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate. Samples were then stained using Walton's lead aspartate at 60°C for 30 min ahead of stepwise dehydration in ethanol. Samples were infiltrated with resin initially using a 50/50 mixture of propylene oxide and Durcupan ACM resin (Ladd Research) for 60 min. Where MatTek dishes were used, coverslips were excised from the surrounding culture dish using a razor blade and removed to a container resistant to propylene oxide ahead of this step. Samples were then infiltrated with fresh undiluted Durcupan for 90 min before covering regions of interest with inverted resin-filled BEEM capsules (Ted Pella) and polymerization for 48 h at 60°C. For TEM, sections of 70 nm were cut from the sample block for imaging and poststained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. For SEM, sample blocks were prepared as described in reference 33. Briefly, small portions of the cell monolayers were mounted on pins using conductive epoxy resin (CircuitWorks CW2400), trimmed to form a pillar approximately 400 by 400 by 150 m, ensuring that regions of interest were retained in the block-face for correlative samples, and coated with a 2-nm layer of platinum ahead of imaging. (ii) Electron microscopy imaging. TEM images were collected in an FEI Tecnai 12 BioTWIN microscope using an Eagle 4K slow-scan charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera (FEI) or an FEI Twin at 120 kV with OneView 4K high-frame-rate camera (Gatan), both in binning mode 2. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) data were collected using a 3View 2XP system (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA) attached to a Sigma VP SEM (Zeiss, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Back-scattered electron images were acquired using the 3VBSE detector. The SEM was operated at a chamber pressure of 5 Pa, with high-current mode inactive. Variable pressure imaging conditions, which reduce the final resolution, aided in the suppression of charging resulting from the large regions of bare resin surrounding single cells. For CLEM data, the 30-m aperture was used with an accelerating voltage of 2 kV, a dwell time of 3 s (10-nm reported pixel size; horizontal frame width, 81.9 m), and 40-nm slice thickness. Two collection setups were used for samples fixed at 6 hpi, using either the 30-or 20-m aperture and an accelerating voltage of 2 or 3 kV, respectively. The imaging dwell time was 3 s (5-nm reported pixel size; horizontal frame width, 20.5 m) or 10 s (6-nm reported pixel size; horizontal frame width, 24.6 m), with a slice thickness of 50 or 30 nm. (iii) SBF-SEM image processing and segmentation. SBF-SEM image stacks were acquired as dm3 files and converted to 32-bit tagged image files (TIFs) for initial batch processing. Images were Gaussian filtered (1 pixel), followed by two rounds of unsharp mask and gray-level normalization (Adobe Photoshop). Image stacks were then converted to 8-bit TIFs and aligned using the virtual align slices plugin (Fiji). Segmentation of features within SBF-SEM data was carried out in a semiautomatic thresholdbased way for the cell cytoplasm and manually for the viral ROs, nuclei and LDs using either Segmentation Editor (Fiji) or Amira 6.0.1 (Thermo Fisher), which was then also employed to extract volume information on the different RO clusters.
