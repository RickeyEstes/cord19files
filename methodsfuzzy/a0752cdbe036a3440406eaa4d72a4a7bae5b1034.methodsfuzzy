In-vitro protein synthesis. For expression of the SUD, a plasmid encoding the full-length domain with an N-terminal His-tag and a factor Xa recognition sequence was constructed by transfer of the NcoI-XhoI fragment from pETBlue-2-SUD (see below) into the dephosphorylated pIVEX1.3-WG vector (Roche) cleaved with the same restriction enzymes. After expression using the RTS wheat-germ continuous-flow cell-free system (Roche), the His-tagged protein was purified using immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC; HisTrap HP column), followed by elimination of imidazole through a HiTrap desalting column (GE HealthCare) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. Protein purity was estimated by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under denaturing conditions. After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), the protein was immunologically detected by anti-His (Novagen) or anti-Nsp3 (Rockland) antibodies. Expression of full-length SUD in Escherichia coli. For the production of the full-length SUD in E. coli, the coding region corresponding to residues 349-726 of Nsp3 was PCR-amplified using sense (GGATTATCTTGATA ACCTGAAGC) and anti-sense (GTCTTAACCTCCCGCAGGGATAA) primers and SARS-CoV cDNA (TOR2 strain; Accession No. AY274119; kind gift of Dr. J. Ziebuhr) as template. The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRV site of the plasmid pETBlue-2 (Novagen), resulting in a gene encoding a protein with three additional amino acids (M-A-M) at the Nterminus and a C-terminal extension of 56 residues including a C-terminal (His) 6 tag. The fusion gene was expressed in E. coli Tuner DE3 (pLacI) cells (Novagen). Expression of the SUDc5b fragment. Step-wise N-and C-terminal truncations led to a stable minimal version of the SUD protein consisting of residues 389-562 of Nsp3, named SUDc5b. The coding region for this protein was PCR-amplified from the plasmid encoding the full-length protein and ligated into the StuI site of the plasmid pQE30, providing an N-terminal His-tag and a short linker sequence. E. coli M15 (pRep4) was used as expression host for this construct. The coding regions of all expression plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Purification of SUDc5b. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 8.0) and disrupted with a sonicator. After centrifugation at 16,000g (20 min, 4°C), Benzonase was added to the supernatant, followed by ultracentrifugation at 38,000g (1 h, 4°C). SUDc5b was purified by IMAC and desalted as described above for the full-length protein. Further purification was achieved by ion-exchange chromatography using a gradient from 25 mM to 1 M NaCl. In all experiments, protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) or by absorbance at 280 nm. The protein was stored at 4°C. Analytical size-exclusion chromatography. The apparent molecular mass of SUDc5b was determined by an analytical BioSep-SEC-S 3000 column (Phenomenex) connected to an HPLC DuoFlow (Bio-Rad). The column was calibrated in 25 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, using the following standard proteins: cytochrome c (12.5 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25.0 kDa), ovalbumin (42.75 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.4 kDa), and glucose oxidase (160 kDa). The sample volume was 25 ll with a concentration of 2 mg/ml. Dynamic light-scattering. Dynamic light-scattering (DLS) was performed using a Laser-Spectroscatter 201 (RiNA GmbH). After centrifugation for 1 h at 4°C and 13,000g, sample (20 ll) was applied to a 10-mm quartz cuvette (Hellma). Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA). Radioactive RNA probes bbc3-G 14 and bbc3-A 14 (see Results and discussion), respectively, were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [a-32 P]-GTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Hartmann) from the following deoxyoligonucleotide duplexes containing the T7 promoter (underlined, only the sense strand 5 0to-3 0 direction is indicated): TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTGA CACTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGCTCTCCTCTCGGTGCTCCTTCAC TC and TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTGACACTAAAAAAA AAAAAAACTCTCCTCTCGGTGCTCCTTCACTC. EMSA was performed with radioactive RNA probes as described [17] with the following modifications: the reaction mixture containing 32 P-labeled RNA (1-3 · 10 4 cpm) and 1-5 lg of the protein tested in binding buffer (5 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 25 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1.75 mM ATP, 6 mM DTT, 0.05 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 166 lg/ml of E. coli tRNA, and 5% glycerol) was incubated for 20 min at 30°C. For electrophoresis, nondenaturing polyacrylamide 4-12% gradient TBE gels (Invitrogen) were used. RNA-protein complexes were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Fujifilm BAS 1000) and the software PCBAS (Raytest). Zone-interference gel electrophoresis. The zone-interference gel electrophoresis (ZIGE) device was adapted from [18] (see Fig. S1 in Supplementary Material). The agarose was dissolved in 1· TBE buffer. The protein was incubated at RT for 0.5 h with deoxyoligonucleotides of different lengths (6-14 and 24 in case of bbc3), with concentrations of 0-32 lM in a sample volume of 10 ll. The samples were mixed with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; final concentration of 10% (v/v)) and a trace of bromophenolblue (BPB). These protein-oligonucleotide samples were applied to the small slots (see Fig. S1 ). Oligonucleotide with the same concentration as in the small slots was also mixed with DMSO and BPB in 1· TBE buffer and applied to the long slots of the gel (total volume 100 ll). Electrophoresis was performed at 4°C for 1 h with a constant current of 100 mA. Staining was performed as outlined in [18] .
