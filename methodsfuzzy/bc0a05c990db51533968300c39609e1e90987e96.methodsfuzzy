2.1. Data 2.1.1. Movement data 2.1.1.1. Pig movement database. As described by Salines et al. (2017b) , pig movement data were obtained from the National Swine Identification Database (BDporc), managed by swine industry professionals and recognised by the French Ministry for Agriculture. All pig movements between farms and to slaughterhouses, rendering plants and trade operators are systematically recorded in this database. Movements of pigs are reported at the batch level: groups of animals are sent off production sites (loadings, further denoted L) and dispatched either to other production units or to slaughterhouses (unloadings, further denoted U). A single truck can load and unload animals at several production sites: one round corresponds to a series of movements by a truck, from the first loading operation to the last unloading event leaving the truck empty. 2.1.1.2. Design of the movement network ( Fig. 1) . Movement data recorded from January to December 2013 were modelled into a onemode directed network aggregated on a one-year basis: holdings were considered as nodes, and movements between two nodes were considered as directed links. All movements between two given holdings during the time period were aggregated into a single link. In-between movements forming a round were replaced with direct movements between holdings, meaning that intermediate transit movements by a truck through a farm without any animal unloading were excluded. All sites corresponding to unloading operations were assumed to be linked to all prior loading sites for the same round. For example, assuming successive loadings at sites L1 and L2 followed by an unloading operation at site U1, then holding U1 was linked to L1 and L2.
