The L-tyrosine analogue GW409544 was obtained by modifying the structure of farglitazar, a dual agonist for both PPARa and PPARc [37] . The main difference between GW409544 and farglitazar is that the former contains a vinylogous amide as the Ltyrosine N-substituent [37] . That is why we chose GW409544 as a starting template structure for designing the new PPAR dual agonists. The representative complex crystal structures of PPARa (PDB ID 1k7l) and PPARc (PDB ID 1k74) with the same ligand GW409544 [37] were download from the PDB Bank [38] , and were to be used for the molecular modelling studies. All the calculations were carried out on Dell Precision TM T5500 computer with Schrodinger software package [34, 36] and Desmond 2.4 [39] . Many useful insights for drug design could be gained via molecular docking studies (see, e.g., [14, 17, 51, 52] ). To acquire even more useful information for drug design, a new docking algorithm called ''Core Hopping'' [36] was adopted in this study that is featured by having the functions to perform both the fragment-based replacing and molecular docking. Core Hopping [36] is a very powerful and cutting-edge technique for de novel drug design because it can significantly improve the binding affinity of the receptor with its ligands, e.g., GW409544 (Fig. 2) in the current study. The binding conformation thus obtained will be taken as an initial structure for further optimization by searching the fragment database to find the optimal cores that are attached to other parts of the template. During the process of core hopping, the 1st step is to define the possible points at which the cores are attached. It is performed in the ''Define Combinations'' step from the Combinatorial Screening panel in Schrodinger2009 (www.schrodinger.com). The 2nd step is to define the ''receptor grid file'', which was done in the ''Receptor Preparation'' panel. The 3rd step is the cores preparation that was operated with the ''Protocore Preparation'' module to find the cores attaching to the scaffold using the fragment database derived from ZINC [50] . The 4th step is to align and dock the entire molecular structure built up by the core and scaffold. The cores are sorted and filtered by goodness of alignment and then redocked into the receptor after attaching the scaffold, followed by using the docking scores to sort the final molecules. As the products of the core hopping operation, a total of 500 chemical compounds were prepared with the LigPre module [53] , which consists of the procedures of generating possible states by ionization at target pH 7.062.0, desalting, retaining chiralities from 3D structure and geometry minimization with the OPLS2005 force field [41] . When the above steps were accomplished, all investigated compounds were docked into the receptor pocket through the rigid protein docking model with the Stand-Precision (SP) scoring function [54, 55] to estimate the binding affinities.
