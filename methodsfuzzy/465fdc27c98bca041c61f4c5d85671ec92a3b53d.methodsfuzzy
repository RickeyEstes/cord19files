To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing method which can specifically predict ERRPs. Though a few subcellular localization prediction methods considered ER as one of many locations in the cell these predict ER proteins along with proteins of other subcellular locations like, ProLoc- GO (Huang et al., 2008) , KnowPredsite (Lin et al., 2009 ), SLocX (Ryngajllo et al., 2011 ), iLoc-Animal (Lin et al., 2013 ), Cello v.2.5 (Yu et al., 2006 , Euk-mPloc (Chou & Shen, 2007) , Euk-mPloc 2.0 (Chou & Shen, 2010) , HybridGO-Loc (Wan, Mak & Kung, 2014 ), mGOASVM (Wan, Mak & Kung, 2012 , Hum-Ploc (Chou & Shen, 2006) and iLoc-Euk (Chou, Wu & Xiao, 2011) . Unfortunately, ProLoc- GO (Huang et al., 2008) , KnowPredsite (Lin et al., 2009) were not found in a working state and HybridGO-Loc and mGOASVM considered only viral and plant proteins. Hum-Ploc is meant only for human proteins, SLocX (Ryngajllo et al., 2011) predicts only ER proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana and iLoc-Animal (Lin et al., 2013) predicts only proteins of animal system. Since ERPred prediction is not organism/taxa specific hence we compared our method with those methods which are not restricted to a particular organism or plant/animal like Cello v.2.5 (Yu et al., 2006 ), iLoc-Euk (Chou, Wu & Xiao, 2011 ) and Euk-mPLoc 2.0 (Chou & Shen, 2010 (an updated version of Euk-mPloc (Chou & Shen, 2007) ) using independent dataset. The sensitivity of ERPred on independent dataset was 72.31% with 83.69% specificity while for Cello v.2.5 the corresponding values were 16.92% and 99.86% respectively and for iLoc-Euk the sensitivity and specificity was 15.38% and 99.76% respectively (Table 3) . Hence Euk-mPLoc showed better performance than iLoc-Euk and Cello v 2.5 in terms of sensitivity, which was 66.15%. As shown in Table 3 , among all the predictors, ERPred performed better in prediction of ERRPs but its performance in terms of specificity or non-ERRPs was lesser than other predictors. It might be due to the fact that all predictors, which we have used here for evaluation on the basis of independent dataset, were intended to predict multiple locations. The result shows that in majority of cases they were predicting locations other than ER, due to which their overall efficiency was higher. In other words, in most cases, they were predicting ERRPs and non-ERRPs as non-ERRPs, which increased their performance. But, if we carefully analyse the results, it can be observed that their performance is not equally good for the prediction of ERRPs. This also vindicates our attempt to develop a dedicated predictor for ERRPs. We also evaluated the performance of BLAST based annotation using sequences of training and independent dataset as database and query respectively. We found that only 40 ERRP sequences of independent dataset were annotated as ERRP. Remaining 25 sequences did not get any hit.
