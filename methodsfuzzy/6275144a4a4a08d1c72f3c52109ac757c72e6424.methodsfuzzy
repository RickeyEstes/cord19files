The Queensland University of Technology (QUT) Library staff assisted in developing a rigorous and clearly documented methodology for both the search strategy and the selection of studies. The aim was to minimise bias by documenting the search process and the decisions made to allow the review to be reproduced and updated. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews was used as a guide for this systematic review: http://handbook.cochrane.org/. The EQUATOR Network Additional file 1: PRISMA (2009) Checklist [13] was used to ensure good practice as well as accurate reporting. Three systematic review registries (Prospero, Joanna Briggs Institute, and Cochrane) were checked to ensure our proposed systematic review had not already been done. Our systematic review protocol was registered at the Open Science Framework on 1 August 2016 (doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/6PZ5E).
