Ethics. All Bacteria. BCG strain Pasteur was a kind gift from Professor Juraj Ivanyi (King's College, London) and was grown according to previous reports 12 , using standard microbiological techniques. BCG expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP; also from the Ivanyi laboratory) was grown in identical conditions, but under selective media and agar containing 50 μg/mL hygromycin B (Sigma-Aldrich). Mice and Immunisations. Female C57BL/6 mice (6 to 12 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River laboratories, UK. Mice were administered 1 mg of PD-L1-blocking antibody MIH5 13 or the rat IgG2a isotype control MAC219 14 (kind gifts from Professor Anne Cooke, University of Cambridge) via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route (day -1). Twenty-four hours later (day 0), mice received 1 × 10 6 CFU BCG subcutaneously (s.c.). Mice then received booster immunisations of MIH5 or MAC219 (1 mg per dose) on days 3, 7 and 14. To confirm receptor blockade, mice were administered 1 mg MIH5 or MAC219 via the i.p. route, followed by euthanasia at 24 h, and immediate ex vivo staining of the splenocytes. Cells were stained with a reported competing fluorochrome-conjugated α-PD-L1 clone (10F.9G2) 15 , which binds to the same epitope as MIH5, to test for successful receptor blockade (Fig. 1) . As an additional control for specificity, PD-L2 was also stained after MIH5 or MAC219 treatments.
