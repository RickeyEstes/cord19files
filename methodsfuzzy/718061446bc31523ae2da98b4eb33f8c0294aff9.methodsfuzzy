In 1953 Andrewes and co-workers at the Common Cold Unit (Salisbury, UK) described the first isolation of an HRV strain using cells from a particular human embryo, but propagation failed once this source of cells was exhausted (Andrewes et al., 1953; Andrewes, 1966) . Early in vitro isolation methods employed an interference test to determine successful isolation; cultures suspected of infection with an HRV prevented infection by another, readily titratable virus (Andrewes, 1966) . Later, Price (1956; the JH strain) and then Pelon et al. (1957; 2060 strain) developed improved culture systems that permitted viral replication to be more easily identified Price, 1956) . These strains were initially classified as echoviruses (ECHO 28; later HRV-1) (Pelon, 1961) . At the same time, propagation of the HGP and trees were constructed and compared for each consecutive fragment (inset; grey bars represent 100 nt fragments; black bar represents complete UTR). The branching patterns shown were retained with only subtle changes; HRV species were always represented clearly, as shown. HEV species were muddled. Nucleotide sequences were aligned using BioEdit v7.0.5.3 (Hall, 1999) and trees were constructed from a Neighbor-Joining analysis with 500 resamplings using Mega v4.0 (Tamura et al., 2007) . Nodal values were shown only until they fell below 70. HEV, human enterovirus; EV, echovirus; CV, coxsackievirus; HPV, human poliovirus.

(HRV-2) strain resulted from using increased acidity, lowered cultivation temperatures and constant motion (rotation) Parsons and Tyrrell, 1961) . Despite the challenges , virus isolation is a more sensitive indicator of infection than an antibody rise in paired sera (Hendley et al., 1972) . Several cell lines and methods are required to encompass virus concentrations that range from 10 1 to 10 5 TCID 50 /mL (Douglas et al., 1966b; D'Alessio et al., 1984; Cate et al., 1965; Hendley et al., 1973) . Additionally, controlling cell age after plating (<72 h), inoculum volume, medium pH (6.8-7.3) and cell density is important for the reproducible appearance of HRV-induced plaques and for higher virus yields (Sethi, 1978; Gwaltney, 1966; Behbehani and Lee, 1964; Fiala and Kenny, 1966) . The HRVs can grow at temperatures above 35 • C but rolling at 33 • C, preceded by a 2-4 h stationary incubation period (Parsons and Tyrrell, 1961) produces the highest yield and fastest in vitro viral growth (Papadopoulos et al., 1999b; Rosenbaum et al., 1971; Andrewes, 1966; Behbehani and Lee, 1964) .
