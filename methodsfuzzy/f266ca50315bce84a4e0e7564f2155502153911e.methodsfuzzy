This study was performed at the specialist care unit of the Helsinki City Health Department in 2004e2005. Restorative dentistry fallout samples (N ¼ 72) were collected from rooms (N ¼ 6) where high-speed rotating instruments were used, and control samples (N ¼ 24) were collected from rooms (N ¼ 4) used for periodontal and orthodontic treatment where rotating and ultrasonic instruments were not used. Rooms at rest (N ¼ 3) were also sampled for background contamination. The rooms have two-directional forced ventilation with class F7 filters (installed in 2001). The air flow is adjusted to 84 L/s in four of the rooms (high-speed instruments, control, rest) and to 440 L/s in the two larger rooms (high-speed instruments, control). This results in one air exchange every 10 min in the slightly smaller rooms and one air exchange every 5 min in the larger rooms. The ventilation was not altered during the sampling period. The ventilation system is checked and serviced annually. The rooms do not have air-conditioning units as they are not necessary in the Finnish climate. The experimental setting is outlined in Figure 1 . Two adjacent horse blood chocolate agar plates (HUSLAB, Helsinki, Finland) supplemented with Isovitalex â 1 and 2 (BBL Microbiology systems, Cockeysville, MD, USA) were placed in six different sectors, 0.5e2 m from the patient as shown in Figure 1 . The plates were opened when treatment started, one of each pair of plates was closed after 1.5 h, and the other plates were closed after 3 h. Sampling was repeated once. In addition, surface samples were collected with sterile cotton swabs from the facial masks of the dentists and dental nurses, and from different surfaces of the dental chair and cabinets, keyboards and door knobs. Samples were immediately plated on to the chocolate agar plates. Sampling was undertaken before and after disinfecting the working area in preparation for the next patient. The plates were incubated at 37 C for 48 h. Colonies were counted and bacteria were classified by Gram stain using a light microscope with 1000 Â magnification. All patients treated during sampling were otherwise healthy and scheduled for routine dental treatments. The results are given as means of colony-forming units (CFU)/m 2 /h with standard deviations. Differences between the sample collection times, sites of collection, treatment modes and bacterial counts were analysed by the Mann-Whitney test.
