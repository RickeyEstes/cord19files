2.1. Bacterial strains NTEC2 strain B20a was isolated from the faeces of a calf with diarrhoea (Oswald et al., 1991) . This strain is serotype O15:K14, is serum resistant, produces an aerobactin (Oswald et al., 1991) and harbours genes encoding F17c and d fimbriae (Mainil et al., 2000) . NTEC2 strain 1404 was isolated from the blood of a calf with septicaemia (Oswald et al., 1991) . This strain is serotype O78:K80, produces an aerobactin (Oswald et al., 1991) and harbours genes encoding for the F17b fimbriae (Mainil et al., 2000) . Prior to the challenge, the pathotypes of these two strains were checked by colony hybridisation with the appropriate gene probes (Mainil et al., 1997) and their serotypes by agglutination with specific antisera. Strain 25KH09 originally isolated from the faeces of a calf with diarrhoea (Pohl et al., 1982) , is serotype O101:K þ :H À (Pohl et al., 1987) , and is the reference strain for the F17a fimbriae (Lintermans et al., 1988a) . This strain is considered non-pathogenic and was chosen as an adherent non-toxigenic control (Pohl et al., 1987; Pohl and Mainil, 1995) .
