A randomized placebo-controlled, double-blinded study was performed at the College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University (Ithaca, NY). From May 28, 2009 through June 7, 2009, 4 bull calves were purchased at birth from a local dairy farm plus 6 more at 1 week of age and enrolled in the study at the same time. The calves were randomly chosen and submitted to a physical examination by a veterinarian at the farm. They were commingled on the transport trailer and randomly off-loaded at Cornell University, at which time an identification tag was placed in the right ear and the animals were weighed. The calves were assigned to treatment groups and housing in the order they were removed from the trailer. On the first day of treatment a technical mistake was made and one calf received a different coded bucket from the one he had been assigned to receive. Exclusion of this calf was not necessary because the management for both groups was kept the same and no prior treatment had been given. The calf was moved from his initial group and assigned to the other group. The calves were individually housed in permanent 0.91 × 1.83 m stalls with high tile walls and concrete flooring within a closed barn with an active ventilation system. This prevented contact between calves. Calves were fed commercial 22% protein/20% fat non-medicated milk replacer (Nursing Formula NT Calf Milk Replacer, Land O'Lakes Inc.) at 0.68 kg of dry matter (DM) per day, split into 2 feedings, for the duration of the study. Any milk replacer not consumed within 15 min was fed to the animal via an esophageal tube feeder. Freechoice water was available at all times. Stalls were cleaned and bedded daily with pine shavings and steam cleaned with 93°C (200°F) pressurized water. Gross manure contamination on the stall walls was also removed daily. Pull-over boots, water buckets, milk buckets, milk bottles, and thermometers were labeled for each treatment group and not shared between calves receiving the different treatments. Calves enrolled in the study received 22 feedings; following the farm management, where each calf receives two feedings of milk per day. Study personnel associated with calf management and sample collection were blinded to the treatments; all treatment vials were color-coded in the laboratory by a study member who did not participate in data collection, and the codes were not broken until the end of the study. A pre-study period on days 1 and 2 was used to collect baseline data on fecal E. coli CFU, phage cocktail PFU, and calf health. During these two days, blood and manure samples were collected for CFU and PFU quantification as well as for obtaining calf health data. Calves started being monitored for feed intake at all feedings, and received a recorded visual health appraisal twice daily by a veterinarian (blinded to treatment allocation). At each feeding, the following data were recorded: health score, fecal score, weight, and temperature. Calf health was assessed visually by using objective criteria of appetite, fecal consistency, hydration status, respiratory effort, and attitude (Berge et al., 2005) . Calves would have been removed and censored from the study if their clinical status appeared critical at any point during the study period; fortunately, this was not necessary for any calf. A single dose of Flunixin meglumine (Banamine, 50 mg/ml, 2.2 mg/kg, Schering Plough) was used to treat one calf with a depressed attitude. No antibiotic treatment was used during the study period. On study day 3 the treatment began: each of the 6 calves in the bacteriophage treatment group received a total of 10 6 PFU (volume = 5 ml) of each of 4 genetically distinct bacteriophages while the placebo group (4 calves) received the placebo (5 ml PBS) treatment. Treatments (phage or placebo) were administered in the morning and afternoon and were added to the reconstituted milk replacer immediately before feeding. Animals in the treatment group each received a bacteriophage cocktail compounded of four bacteriophages previously isolated from the manure lagoons of two large commercial dairy farms located near Ithaca, NY (Bicalho et al., 2010) . Bacteriophage high-titer stocks were propagated and purified as follows: 0.2% inoculum of an overnight culture of the propagating host strain (E. coli 137 previously isolated from a uterine secretion of a metritic cow) was added to 250 ml of LB broth (Difco™) and incubated at 37°C for 5 h with shaking. Approximately 1 × 10 9 PFU of each isolated bacteriophage was added to the culture and, after incubation at 37°C for 20 min without shaking, the samples were incubated for a further 18-20 h at 37°C with vigorous shaking. Concentrated phage preparations were obtained by precipitation of the LB lysates with NaCl/polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 according to protocols described by Sambrook and Russel (2001) . Solid NaCl (final concentration 1.0 M) was added to each sample and, after stirring, the samples were kept on ice for 1 h. The samples were then centrifuged at 11,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min to remove debris and the supernatants (LB lysates) were transferred to sterile flasks. Solid PEG 8000 (final concentration 10% w/v) was added to the lysates and the samples were kept on ice for at least 1 h to allow the bacteriophage particles to precipitate. The precipitated bacteriophage particles were recovered by centrifugation at 11,000 ×g at 4°C for 10 min and resuspended in SM buffer. These large-scale high-titer stocks were titrated using standard overlay techniques and stored at 4°C. Fresh fecal samples were collected daily per rectum with a latex examination glove and stored in a sterile container. The samples were kept chilled before and during transport to the laboratory. Bacteria enumeration of fecal samples was conducted by vortexing 1 g of fecal sample with 9 ml of PBS in a 50-ml Falcon tube. Each fecal sample was diluted in PBS and aerobically cultured on MacConkey agar (Difco™) plates at 37°C for 18 h. Each aliquot was spiral plated in triplicate. To assess the presence and quantity of bacteriophages in the blood, blood samples from each calf were collected in a vacuum container and refrigerated until processing. After centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 20 min, 1 ml of plasma was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and serial dilutions from 10 − 1 to 10 − 4 were prepared by adding 1 ml of the phage solution to sterile broth (SM buffer). Each phage serial dilution of each calf was quantified in 10-μl microdrops in triplicate. The plates were examined after 48 h and the number of PFU determined.
