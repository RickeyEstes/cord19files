This study was a retrospective review of mini-CEXs completed by ED faculty members from August 2009 to December 2010. All PGY-1 residents enrolled in this study rotated for the one-month EM training received the same 6month Postgraduate Primary Care Medical Training Program. Each PGY-1 resident received 1 week of trauma training and 3 weeks of nontrauma training during the 1-month EM rotation. The clinical competency of each PGY-1 was evaluated with a weekly mini-CEX, one by a trauma surgeon and three by emergency physicians (EPs), during the 1-month rotation. Fifty-seven faculty members (42 EPs and 15 trauma surgeons) evaluated 183 PGY-1 residents during the 17 months of EM training. Most ED faculties received a brief workshop of video-based rater training during our preliminary stage of implementation of this assessment tool (mini-CEX) into the PGY-1 EM training. The workshop provided raters reference readings and assessment instructions on the mini-CEX, scoring video and subsequently discussed and reconciled scoring difference for rater errors training. These works helped most evaluators in this study to be competent to perform this work-place assessment. In the mini-CEX, PGY-1 residents are rated in seven competencies (medical interviewing, physical examination, professionalism, procedural skills, clinical judgment, counseling skills, and organization) using a nine-point rating scale (1 ¼ unsatisfactory and 9 ¼ superior). Each PGY-1 resident was evaluated with a mini-CEX weekly. In the first 12 months, paper-based mini-CEXs were rated by EPs and trauma surgeons. In the followed 5 months, the mini-CEXs rated by EPs were changed to a computer-based format. The satisfaction survey (9point scale) of evaluators and students was also available in the new format. We analyzed the validity of the weekly mini-CEX and the impact of seniority and the specialty training of ED faculty members on observation time, feedback time, and rating scores. We also explored the benefits of implementation of the computer-based mini-CEX format. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. This study was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee on Human Research. The study protocol was reviewed and qualified as exempt from the requirement to obtain informed consent.
