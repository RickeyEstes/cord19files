Animals. Per1 − / − mice 45 were obtained from Dr. CC Lee at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. Ccr2 − / − mice were obtained from Jackson Lab (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The Per1 − / − ; Ccr2 − / − (DKO) mice were generated at the expected Mendelian ratios and developed normally. All of the animals were backcrossed for at least five generations before the first pilot study to ensure a largely homogenous C57BL/6J background. Male WT C57BL/6J mice and gene knockout mice at 8-10 weeks of age were used in this work. The animals were maintained in cycles of 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness with free access to food and water ad libitum. All animal care and use procedures were in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Nanjing University of Science and Technology. Endotoxin-induced fulminant hepatitis model. Fulminant hepatitis in mice was established by intraperitoneal injection of LPS (5 μg/kg body weight; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and D-GalN (500 mg/kg body weight; Sigma-Aldrich). To determine the survival rate, the animals were monitored continuously after LPS/D-GalN injection until their death. For assessment of liver damage, the animals were killed 5 h after treatment with this dose to obtain blood and liver tissue. To induce non-lethal liver inflammation, mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS (3 μg/kg body weight) and D-GalN (200 mg/kg body weight). Blood and liver samples were collected 5 h after treatment. Serum aminotransferase activity and ELISA. Serum AST and ALT activities were measured using an AU2700 automatic biochemical analyzer (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Serum TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Boster Biological Technology Ltd, Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Antibody. For immunohistochemical staining, purified antibodies were obtained from Abcam (Shanghai, China) and eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA) (anti-mouse CD68, Abcam, cat no. ab955; anti-mouse F4/80, eBioscience, cat no. 14-4801). Antibodies for flow cytometry analysis were obtained from eBioscience and BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA) (anti-mouse F4/80, PE-conjugated, eBioscience, cat no. 12-4801; anti-mouse CD11b, FITC-conjugated, BD Biosciences, cat no. 557396; anti-mouse CD115, APC-conjugated, eBioscience, cat no. . Antibodies for western blots and immunoprecipitation assays were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Cell Signaling Technology (Shanghai, China), Abcam and Bioworld Technology (Nanjing, China) (anti-HA, Sigma-Aldrich, cat no. H3663; anti-mouse PPARγ, Cell Signaling Technology, cat no. 2430; anti-mouse PER1, Abcam, cat no. ab3443; anti-mouse β-actin, Bioworld Technology, cat no. AP0060). Histological analysis. Liver tissue was fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin overnight, embedded in paraffin and cut into 4-μm sections. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). CD68 and F4/80 were used as immunohistochemical markers for KCs in the liver as described previously. 46 Cell culture and treatment. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from mice by peritoneal lavage 4 days after injection of 2 ml of 3% thioglycolate as described previously. 47 Peritoneal macrophages and RAW264.7 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% low-endotoxin FBS and stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for the indicated time periods. RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from the samples with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reverse transcription reaction was carried out using a reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time PCR was performed, and the products were detected using the ABI 7300 Detection System with SYBR Green dye (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The expression level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was simultaneously quantified as an internal standard control. Gene expression in monocytes/ macrophages was normalized against B2M and TBP as previously described. 48 The sequences of all primers used for quantitative RT-PCR are shown in Supplementary  Table S1 . Flow cytometry. For flow cytometry experiments, hepatic inflammatory cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were prepared as described previously. 29 Hepatic inflammatory cells were stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies against F4/80 and CD11b. PBMCs were incubated with fluorescently labeled antibodies against CD115 and CD11b. Flow cytometric analysis was performed by using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) at Nanjing Medical University. For cell cycle analysis, cells in the G0/G1, S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were identified using Vybrant Dye Cycle violet stain (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The proportion of apoptotic cells was measured using a FACScan flow cytometer according to the instructions provided in the Annexin V/PI kit (Invitrogen). Cell chemotaxis assay. The cell chemotaxis assay was performed as previously described. 49 Peritoneal macrophages were placed in the upper chambers of the transwell (5 × 10 4 cells per well) and exposed to medium or MCP-1 (50 ng/ml, R&D Systems, Shanghai, China) in the lower chamber. After a 12-h incubation, the number of migrated cells was determined by blinded observers, who counted 10 microscopic fields per well. Western blot analysis. Proteins were extracted following the procedure described previously. 50 The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8-12% polyacrylamide gels and subsequently electrically transferred to a PVDF membrane. After blocking with 5% (w/v) BSA in TBST at room temperature for 1 h, the membranes were then incubated with an appropriate specific primary antibody (anti-HA, 1 : 2000; anti-PPAR-γ, 1 : 1000; anti-PER1, 1 : 200; anti-β-actin, 1 : 1000) at 4°C overnight, followed by incubation with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1 : 10 000). Detection was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Thermo Scientific, Hudson, NH, USA). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The ChIP assay was performed as described previously with slight modifications. 51 RAW264.7 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and stimulated with LPS for 1 h. Cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of a specific antibody (anti-PPAR-γ; anti-PER1) or negative control rabbit IgG (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) at 4°C overnight. Immunoprecipitated DNA was then used as a template for PCR. The sequences of all primers used for ChIP-PCRs are listed in Supplementary Table S2 . Co-immunoprecipitation. For co-immunoprecipitation, B6F10 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen) in 10-cm dishes. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously. 52 Briefly, cells were lysed with a solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 420 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5% NP-40 with protease inhibitor cocktail (Boster Biological Technology Ltd). To prepare the immunoprecipitates, we incubated the cell lysates with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4°C followed by incubation with Protein A-Sepharose 4B (Invitrogen). The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with wash buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40 and 0.5% Triton X-100 and subsequently boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The proteins were analyzed by western blotting as described above. Statistical analysis. The statistical significance of lethality was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Groups of data are presented as mean ± S.D. One-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test or Student's t-test was used to determine the statistical significance of difference in measured parameters. Difference was considered significant at Po0.05.
