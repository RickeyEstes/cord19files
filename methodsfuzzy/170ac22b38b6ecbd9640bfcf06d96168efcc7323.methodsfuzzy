PCT concentrations were measured for patients on admission to our medical intensive care unit (MICU) for severe sepsis from community-acquired pneumonia according to the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine criteria. These patients presented during the peak SARS outbreak period in our country from March to July this year. In vitro PCT levels were measured in serum samples by use of KRYPTOR immunoanalyser (DYAMED Biotech) available in a service laboratory at National University Hospital, Singapore. The upper limit of normal was 0.5 ng/ml.
