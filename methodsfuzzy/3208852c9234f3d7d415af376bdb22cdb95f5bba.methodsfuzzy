Taiwan had 468 hospitals in 2003, 393 (83.9%) private and 75 (16.1%) public. Data were collected from emergency departments in which the number of patients exceeded 500 per month. Questionnaires were sent to chiefs of staff at emergency departments in late June 2003. The questionnaire was designed by emergency department experts after panel discussions. The data collected included the following: accreditation of the hospitals, the average monthly volume of emergency department patients from March to May 2003, the effects of the SARS epidemic on emergency department workers, types of PPE supplied, kinds of ICMs implemented, as well as timing and origin of instruction to use PPE and ICMs during the SARS epidemic. Before data analyses, hospitals were classified into 3 levels, medical center (level A), regional hospital (level B), or local hospital (level C). In general, the number of hospital beds at these hospitals, based on reference data, was >500 in level A, 200-500 in level B, and <200 in level C. The average monthly volume of emergency department patients was an average of the monthly emergency department volumes during the 3-month period. The hospitals were grouped first by level, and then the average was calculated. The average of the averages for each hospital was then determined. Emergency department workers were classified as physicians, nursing staff, or paramedics. The effects on emergency department staff were measured according to a 4-point scale, as follows: 1) had fever and needed to stay at home, 2) quarantined at home with fever or no fever, 3) quarantined at hospital, and 4) probably had SARS. The basic PPE recommended by the DOH included head and shoe covers, goggles, face shield, gloves, apron, disposable gown, surgical mask, and N95 respiratory mask. Hand hygiene was excluded as a protection measure because accurate assessment was difficult. The high-level protective respirators were defined as P100/ N100/ FFP3 (approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health [NIOSH]) and powered air-purifying respirators with full-body isolation suit. ICMs included the guidelines from the DOH (defined as basic ICMs) as well as additional measures, such as having a fever triage ward or referral to a SARS screening team, implemented by emergency departments during the SARS outbreak. The timing of complete PPE implementation or having ICMs completely in place was classified into 2 stages: 1) early stage, from March to late April, 2) late stage, from late April to mid-June. The order to use PPE or ICMs came from 3 sources: 1) emergency department workers themselves, 2) emergency department administrators, and 3) hospital administrators. The difficulty of implementing or instituting ICMs was rated on a scale from 1 (mildly difficult) to 5 (very difficult). The effectiveness of implementing ICMs was rated on a scale from 1 (less effective) to 5 (very effective). All ratings were based on self-assessments of hospital staff. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the differences in the average monthly volumes of patients among different levels and types of emergency departments. The associations between categorical variables were analyzed by chi-square and Fisher exact test. The rating scale of difficulty and effectiveness of ICMs was represented by median and interquartile range (IQR). The correlation between difficulty and effectiveness was analyzed by Spearman rank correlation; p values <0.05 were considered significant.
