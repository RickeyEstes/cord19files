Plasmids cDNA for PI3Kc was obtained from L. Stephen (the Babraham Institute, UK). PCR-mediated mutagenesis was performed to obtain cDNA encoding the K251E mutant, which harbors a mutation within the RBD that abrogates the interaction with Ras. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into the XhoI/NotI sites of pCAGGS-36HA [46] . The expression vectors for GFP-Rab5 and GFP-Rab7 were kindly provided by T. Tsuboi (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan), and those for the HA-tagged wild-type PI3Kc, and CFP-tagged Akt-PH were described previously [19] . cDNAs for Rab5 and Rab7 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the XhoI/NotI sites of pCAGGS-ECFP and pCAGGS-Venus vectors [47] , respectively. Expression plasmids for wild type (WT) and the dominant negative mutant (S17N) of Ras were kindly provided by M. Matsuda (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) [48] . Of note, these vectors are designed for Ras expression to be monitored by the fluorescence of bicistronically expressed GFP or RFP.
