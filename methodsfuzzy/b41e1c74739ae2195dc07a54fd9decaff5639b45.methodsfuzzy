Reagents and Antibodies. FITC (isomer 1) and LPS (serotype 055:B5) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Metrizamide A.G. was obtained from Accurate Chemical and Scientific Co. The following anti-mouse antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry and FACS ® analysis: biotinylated anti-CD11c, biotinylated anti-IgM a , biotinylated anti-B220, biotinylated anti-CD3, biotinylated anti-I-Ad, FITC-conjugated anti-I-Ad, PE-conjugated anti-I-Ad, and anti-CD4 (PharMingen); NLDC-145 and MOMA-1 (Bachem). The following secondary reagents were used when applicable: avidin-conjugated FITC (avidin-FITC), streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (SA-AP), and SAconjugated horseradish peroxidase (SA-HRP; Vector Labs); AP-conjugated goat anti-rat Ig (anti-rat Ig-AP; PharMingen); HRP-conjugated goat anti-rat Ig (anti-rat Ig-HRP; Caltag Laboratories); and SA-conjugated peridinine chlorophyll protein (SA-PerCP; Becton Dickinson). Cells were suspended in RPMI/ 25 mM HEPES/5% FCS unless otherwise noted. Mice. BALB/c-plt / plt mice were produced by backcrossing plt mice 10 generations into a BALB/c genetic background as described previously (29) . BALB/c control mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. All experiments were performed on 6-10-wk-old age-and sex-matched mice maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. RNA Expression Studies. For Northern analysis, mRNA from tissues of wild-type and plt mice was subjected to gel electrophoresis, transferred to Hybond-N ϩ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and probed using randomly primed mouse SLC, ELC, and actin cDNA. For in situ hybridizations, paraffin sections (5 m) from ϩ / ϩ and plt mice were deparaffinized, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and treated with proteinase K. After washing in 0.5 ϫ SSC, the sections were covered with hybridization solution, prehybridized for 1-3 h at 55 Њ C, and hybridized overnight with sense or antisense 35 S-labeled riboprobe transcribed from the mouse SLC or ELC cDNA. After hybridization, sections were washed at high stringency, dehydrated, dipped in photographic emulsion NTB 2 (Eastman Kodak Co.), stored at 4 Њ C for 8 wk, developed, and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemistry. Tissue samples of spleen and LNs were frozen in OCT, and 10-m cryostat sections were prepared. Sections were fixed in acetone for 10 min, air dried, blocked with PBS/5% normal goat serum for 30 min, and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 1 h. Slides were then washed in PBS, incubated with either SA-AP and anti-rat HRP or anti-rat AP and SA-HRP for 30 min, and developed with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) followed by Vector Red (Vector Labs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Flow Cytometry. For DC quantitation, mesenteric, inguinal, axillary, and brachial LNs from four plt and two ϩ / ϩ mice were pooled, and single cell suspensions were prepared. RBCs were depleted by lysis, and cells at 5 ϫ 10 6 /ml were layered onto metrizamide (14.5 g/100 ml medium) and centrifuged for 10 min at 600 g . Cells at the interface were collected, washed, and resuspended in medium, stained with FITC-conjugated anti-I-Ad, and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan ® (Becton Dickinson). Spleen cells were isolated as described previously (30) . In brief, spleens were minced, incubated for 1 h at 37 Њ C in RPMI with 130 U/ml collagenase and 0.1 mg/ml DNase, teased through 70-m nylon mesh, and centrifuged. RBCs were depleted by lysis, then cells were washed once and resuspended. Cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-I-Ad, biotinylated anti-B220, and biotinylated anti-CD3 followed by SA-PerCP and analyzed by flow cytometry. For DC quantitation, cells were gated against B220 and CD3 and analyzed for expression of I-Ad. Contact Sensitization. The shaved abdomens of mice were painted with 0.4 ml of 5 mg/ml FITC dissolved in a 50:50 (vol/ vol) mixture of acetone and dibutylphthalate. After 24 h, cell suspensions of pooled inguinal, axillary, and brachial LNs were prepared from each mouse and analyzed by flow cytometry. In some experiments, aliquots of LN cells were stained with biotinylated anti-CD11c followed by SA-PerCP. To determine I-A expression on FITC ϩ cells, aliquots of LN cells from four mice were pooled, partially purified on metrizamide, stained with biotinylated anti-I-Ad followed by SA-PerCP, and analyzed by flow cytometry. For sensitization with a lower dose of antigen, 25 l of 8 mg/ml FITC was spotted on the shaved right flank of five ϩ / ϩ and five plt mice. After 24 h, the draining and contralateral inguinal LNs were removed and analyzed individually. Single cell suspensions were quantitated, stained with anti-I-Ad and anti-B220, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Skin DC Migration and Staining. Skin explant culture, preparation of dermal and epidermal whole mounts, and staining of DCs were performed as described previously (31) . In brief, ears were rinsed with 70% ethanol and split with forceps into dorsal and ventral halves. Dorsal ear halves were floated directly on 2 ml of complete medium in 24-well plates for 3 d. Epidermal and dermal sheets were prepared by floating ear halves (fresh or cultured) or freshly prepared abdominal skin dermal side down on 0.5 M ammonium thiocyanate for 20 min at 37 Њ C. Epidermis was separated from dermis with fine forceps and stained immediately. Epidermal and dermal sheets were cut into 3 ϫ 3-mm sections, fixed in acetone for 30 min, and rehydrated in PBS. They were incubated in 1:20 biotinylated anti-I-Ad overnight at 4 Њ C, washed in PBS three times, and incubated with SA-FITC at 1:100 for 90 min at room temperature. After three washes, sheets were mounted on microscope slides and evaluated by UV microscopy. Nonadherent migratory cells were recovered from the bottom of tissue culture wells after 72 h by gentle rinsing. Aliquots were counted and cells were cytospun onto microscope slides for staining with 1:100 biotinylated anti-I-Ad using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Labs) and DAB and counterstained with hematoxylin. The proportion of I-A ϩ cells was determined by examining 10 fields/slide over 3 slides. Viral Infection. Mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59), was propagated and plaque assayed on DBT cells as described previously (32, 33) . A single pool of virus was divided into aliquots and stored at Ϫ 80 Њ C until use. Mice were infected by intraperitoneal injection of 0.2-2 ϫ 10 6 PFU of MHV-A59 in a 0.2 ml vol. Mortality was assessed at 14 d after infection. LD 50 were calculated by the PROBIT method. Sequence Analysis. DNA fragments for sequencing were generated by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from ϩ / ϩ and plt mice with the following primer pairs (position of products relative to transcriptional start site is listed in parentheses): GTCAACCTGGTCTATGAATCCCAG and CACGACATC-ACACTGAACCGATC ( Ϫ 1025 to Ϫ 428); GCTCAGCACTTA-TGGAAGGGTG and GCCATGATTGTGGTTGAGTTGAG ( Ϫ 598 to 59); TCTCACCTACAGCTCTGGTCTCATC and GTGAACCACCCAGCTTGAAGTTC (12 to 779); CTGGA-AAGAAAGGAAAGGGCTC and ATGGAGAGCAGGTTCA-GGTCTTGG (571 to 1046); CTTCAACCATTACATCTG-CACGG and TTTACTCCTGCCTGGGGATAGG (873 to 1965). PCR was performed using a Perkin Elmer 9600 thermal cycler in a final volume of 50 l containing 5 U AmpliTaq enzyme with its 1 ϫ buffer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, and 1 M of each primer. Samples were heated to 94 Њ C for 4 min, AmpliTaq was added, and samples were cycled for 35 cycles at 94 Њ C for 30 s, 60 Њ C for 1 min, and 72 Њ C for 1 min. PCR products were cloned into PCRII TA (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced using dye terminator technology.
