We studied 21 statistical methods, 19 of which were implemented in the R package surveillance [29, 30] : • CUSUM variants: original CUSUM [29, 32] , a Rossi approximate CUSUM [32] , a CUSUM algorithm for which the expected values are estimated by a GLM model [29] , a mixed Rossi approximate CUSUM GLM algorithm [29] , • the original Farrington algorithm [15] and the improved Farrington algorithm [9] , • a count data regression chart (GLRNB) [29, 33] and a Poisson regression chart (GLR Poisson) [29, 34] , • the OutbreakP method [35] , • EARS C1, C2 and C3 algorithms [19, 36] For all simulated time series, we used the tuning parameters recommended by their authors for each algorithm when available and proposed by default in the package surveillance. The commands used from the R package surveillance and the control tuning parameters chosen for these 19 algorithms are presented in Table 1 . We also proposed two additional methods not implemented in the package surveillance: • a periodic Poisson regression where μ(t) is defined as in Eq (1). The threshold is the 1 − α quantile of a Poisson distribution with mean equal to the predicted value at week t. • a periodic negative binomial regression, also defined as in Eq (1), where the threshold is the 1 − α quantile of a negative binomial distribution with mean equal to the predicted value at week t and a dispersion parameter estimated by the model.

An alarm was triggered if the observed number of cases was greater than the upper limit of the prediction interval. These two methods are basic periodic regressions. The R code of these two algorithms is presented in the S24 Appendix. We evaluated the performances of the methods with three different α values: α = 0.001, α = 0.01 and α = 0.05. In this section, we present the averaged performances of each evaluated method, i.e. the performances irrespective of the scenario and of the characteristics of the time series. Table 2 presents averaged FPR, specificity, POD, POD1week, sensitivity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and F 1 -measure for all 42 scenarios and all past and current outbreak amplitude and duration and for α = 0.01. Overall, FPR ranged from 0.7% to 59.9% and POD from 43.3% to 88.7%. Methods with the highest specificity, such as the improved Farrington method or the periodic negative binomial regression, presented a POD lower than 45% and a sensitivity lower than 21%. Averaged measures for α = 0.001 and α = 0.05 are presented in S1 Table  and S2 Table. RKI 1-3, GLR Negative Binomial, GLR Poisson, Bayes 1-3 and OutbreakP algorithms' performances do not vary with α values (see Table 1 ). Their performances are only reported in Table 2 . For each method, a radar chart presenting the measures 1-7 for α = 0.01 is proposed in the S23 Appendix. . Two groups stand out from the rest. The first group consists of Bayes 1, 2 and 3. These methods present the best POD (around 0.8) and POD1week with a FPR around 10%. The second group consists of the 4 CUSUM methods: CUSUM, CUSUM Rossi, CUSUM GLM, and CUSUM GLM Rossi. For α = 0.01, these methods present the best sensitivity (around 0.80) but the lowest specificity (0.55) and the highest FPR (0.40). Note that while of the algorithm test statistics are based on the likelihood of single-week observations independent of recent ones, CuSUMs are not, and they may be important for applications where detection of gradual events rather than one-week spikes is especially critical. The OutbreakP method had the lowest specificity without having a better POD or POD1week than the first two groups. Finally, a third group consists of the other methods that had good specificity (over 0.9) but a lower sensitivity, POD and POD1week than the first two groups. All 21 methods presented a high negative predictive value, greater than 94%. The PPV of OutbreakP is very low (6.5%), while the Periodic Negative Binomial GLM method had the highest PPV (68.4%). A first attempt to visualize certain differences is to plot POD and FPR according to the scenario and the k 1 or k 2 values. To illustrate this, Fig 2 shows the performances of the CDC method. The first row represents FPR for an increasing past outbreak constant k 1 = 0, 2, 3, 5 and 10 according to the 42 scenarios. The second row shows POD according to k 2 for the 42 scenarios (each curve corresponds to a simulated scenario) for an increasing past outbreak constant k 1 = 0, 2, 3, 5 and 10. It clearly shows that performance depends on the scenario. The same plots with tables presenting numerical values for each method and different α values are presented in the S2 Appendix to S22 Appendix. To better compare the 21 methods, we presented on a single display in the S1 Appendix, their FPR according to the scenarios and their POD according to the k 2 values for k 1 = 5 and α = 0.01. To better understand which characteristics are associated with each performance and to compare each method with the improved Farrington method, we present the results obtained from the multivariate Poisson regression models in the next section. Adjusted performance ratios and associated factors Table 3 presents the adjusted performance ratios for performance measures 1 to 5 as described in the Methods' section (α = 0.01 for Improved Farrington, Original Farrington, Periodic Poisson GLM and Neg Binomial GLM, CDC and EARS C1-C3. α = 0.05 for Bayes 1-3). Evaluation and comparison of statistical methods for early temporal detection of outbreaks • Adjusted FPR ratios decreased when the amplitude and duration (driven by k 1 in Eq (1)) of past outbreaks increased. It is indeed more difficult to detect an outbreak when past outbreaks have occurred, especially when these outbreaks are large and when the method does not under-weight their influence to estimate the expected number of cases. Adjusted FPR ratio was 2.75 times higher for time series with a secular trend than for the others. As we simulated time series with a non-negative trend (β ! 0 in Eq (1)), it was expected that FPR would decrease with a trend, especially for methods which do not integrate a trend in the estimation of the expected number of cases. In the same way, annual seasonality-and biannual seasonality to an even greater extent-and overdispersion increased FPR. We observed a nonlinear relation between FPR and baseline frequency: FPR ratio increased from the lowest frequencies to 12 cases per week, then decreased for the highest frequencies, with no clear explanation. Only periodic negative binomial GLM presented a FPR lower than improved Farrington FPR (FPR ratio = 0.71). Adjusted FPR ratios of OutbreakP and all CUSUM variants were higher than 40. Another group of methods all presented FPR ratios below 10: CDC, RKI variants, EARS methods, periodic Poisson GLM, original Farrington, Bayes 2 and GLR negative binomial. FPR ratios for other methods (Bayes 1 and 3, and GLR Poisson) were between 10 and 17. • Adjusted specificity ratios were almost all equal to 1 as the amplitude and duration of past outbreaks had little influence on specificity. They were significantly lower for time series with a secular trend (adjusted specificity ratio = 0.84) or with annual or biannual seasonality (respective ratios: 0.99 and 0.98). Specificity decreased when dispersion increased but increased when the baseline frequency (θ in Eq (1)) increased. Only the periodic negative binomial GLM presented a specificity as good as that of the improved Farrington method (specificity ratio = 1.00). • The adjusted POD ratios significantly decreased when past outbreak amplitude and duration (k 1 ) increased, which is logical. They increased when current outbreak amplitude and duration (k 2 ) increased, which is also normal. POD was higher for time series with secular trends which can be explained by the positive trend. POD decreased when there was an annual or a biannual seasonality (respective POD ratio = 0.97 and 0.92). Only the highest dispersion value (θ = 5) had an influence on POD (adjusted POD ratio = 1.09). Bayes 1, 2 and 3, CUSUM variants and the GLR Poisson method presented the highest POD ratios, from 1.75 (GLR Poisson) to 1.95 (CUSUM GLM). Any method was less able to detect an outbreak than the improved Farrington algorithm. • POD1week presented results that were similar to those of POD. Adjusted POD1week ratios were significantly lower than those of POD for EARS C3 (0.25 versus 1.25), for CDC (0.55 versus 1.04) and for GLR negative binomial (1.17 versus 0.87). Other methods presented ratios for POD1week that were similar to or greater than those of POD. • Finally, similar results were observed for sensitivity and for POD. Bayes 2 and 3 methods, OutbreakP, RKI 3, CUSUM variants and the GLR Poisson method presented the highest sensitivity ratios, from 2.04 (RKI 3) to 3.89 (CUSUM GLM). As observed in the POD model, any method was less able to detect an outbreak than the improved Farrington algorithm. Estimation from the multivariate regression models to explain PPV and NPV are presented in S3 Table.
