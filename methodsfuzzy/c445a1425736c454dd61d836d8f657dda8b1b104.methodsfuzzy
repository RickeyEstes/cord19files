Although isolation measures are based on the current understanding of the mechanisms of transmission of organisms, few data are available to demonstrate their efficacy. First, mathematical models of transmission have allowed predictions about the effectiveness of various interventions that would be difficult or impractical to study in large clinical trials. [10] [11] [12] Because healthcare-associated infections are relatively uncommon events, any study designed to demonstrate efficacy requires samples sizes that are often prohibitively large. Thus, studies evaluating the efficacy of isolation measures often lack the power to allow one to conclude confidently that there has been a lack of effect. Second, many clinical studies were conducted during epidemics while the majority of hospitals confronting these pathogens now face endemic resistance; the epidemiology of MDRO and the effectiveness of control measures are different in these two situations. Third, most studies implemented multiple interventions either simultaneously or sequentially, making it impossible patient screening, on-site surveillance, contact isolation, decolonization, a computerized alert system and hospital-wide promotion of hand hygiene, and had a substantial impact on both the reservoir of MRSA patients and the attack rate of MRSA bacteremia. 32 Similarly, an active infection control intervention, which included the obtaining of surveillance cultures, education, communication and the isolation of infected patients reduced the transmission of VRE in health care facilities of the Siouxland region of Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota between 1996 and 1999. 31 Other prominent examples of the effect of CP on the successful control of MDRO clusters (mostly stopped at an early stage) are listed in Table 1 . As mentioned above, it remains difficult to ascertain the unique role of CP in the control of sporadic or epidemic MDRO transmission, because of the multimodal intervention character of these studies. Nevertheless, most experts would agree that they are an essential component of the "search-and-destroy" strategy to prevent further spread of MRSA in a healthcare setting. 35 This latter policy has been successfully applied in countries with low to very low prevalence of MRSA, notably the Netherlands. 36 In a 5-year study, control of MRSA was accomplished by the use of active surveillance cultures for persons at risk (patients or HCWs), by the preemptive isolation of patients at risk, and by the strict isolation of known MRSA carriers and the eradication of MRSA carriage. For unexpected cases of MRSA colonization or infection, patients placed in strict isolation or contact isolation and HCWs were screened. In a survey of 231 Dutch hospitals inquiring about MRSA control, those who had implemented an isolation cohort (i.e., index cases were isolated on hospital admission) had only 4/73 (5%) cases of secondary MRSA transmission. By contrast, the non-isolation cohort (i.e., high-risk patients not put into isolation on admission) had 19/95 (20%) cases of secondary MRSA transmission. 37 Interestingly, the Netherlands achieved MRSA control despite generally rather low hand hygiene compliance. In an observational survey in ICUs and surgical departments of five hospitals of varying size in the Netherlands, hand hygiene compliance of 65 nurses, attending physicians, medical residents and medical students was monitored, with an overall compliance of only 19%. 38 MDR GNB. The prime value of CP to control outbreaks of MDR GNB has also been demonstrated ( Table 1 ). In the past, intensified CP measures controlled the outbreak of extendedspectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae before these bacteria became endemic. 39, 40 Several studies have demonstrated that outbreaks of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae could be due to a same single strain or clone, depending on the microbiological technique used for identification, and these bacteria could spread into an ICU 41 or several units of the same hospital. 42 In one study, 41 reinforced control measures (cohorting and dedicated staff in addition to CP and screening of patients at admission and weekly) allowed to end an outbreak of 32 cases of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae colonization or infection. However, environmental screening had not been performed. Clearly, if the source is not identified and eliminated, infection control measures could be ineffective. For readers seeking additional background information, they can refer to standard sources. [43] [44] [45] [46] isolation of patients, whereas other institutions isolate only patients diagnosed with infections caused by these pathogens. Moreover, existing evidence supports infection prevention and control interventions as cost effective in decreasing transmission of MRSA and VRE in Intensive Care Units (ICUs), 18 but there remains skepticism on whether these measures are cost-effective or even detrimental to the quality of patient care in non-ICU wards. 19 For instance, a recent study evaluated the impact of CP on compliance with individual and composite process of care quality measures, and found that contact isolation was associated with lower adherence to the composite pneumonia processof-care measure, whereas other composite measures were not affected. 20 Another issue addressed by several systematic reviews is the impact of contact precautions on patients' well-being: troubling common themes of harm emerge from these reviews and drawbacks associated with CP have sometimes been reported. [21] [22] [23] For example, Kirkland et al. reported that HCWs who treated patients in contact isolation entered their rooms less frequently, and had significantly less direct contact with them, than those caring in SP. 14 Stelfox et al. reported that compared with controls, patients isolated for infection control precautions experience more preventable adverse events, express greater dissatisfaction with their treatment, and have less documented care. 16 One additional finding is the higher level of depression and anxiety among patients placed under CP or isolation. 15, 24, 25 There can be also difficulty for HCWs in communicating with patients as it was shown during the Canadian outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003. 26 The ethical considerations of such an intervention which balance patient autonomy with protection of the population have been discussed in detail elsewhere. 27 Therefore, in 2006, the American Institute of Architects, in its Guidelines for Design and Construction of Health Care Facilities, made single-patient rooms the standard. 28 Hospitals that have single-patient rooms exclusively are able to isolate patients with transmissible diseases without disrupting patient flow. 29 However, existing facilities, especially in Europe, often have a significant proportion of double-or multi-bed patient rooms. Despite these ongoing controversies, we will discuss in the following sections evidence arguing in favor of CP as the single most important measure to prevent the spread of MDROs. We will first focus on sporadically occurring MDRO and then discuss the effectiveness of CP in settings with hyperendemic MDRO. Each major section has been divided into two subsections relative to MRSA and VRE, for which more studies and data are available, and MDR GNB. The role of CP to control sporadic or epidemic MDRO transmission. MRSA and VRE. During the past 50 years, CP have been successfully advocated and implemented in settings with low prevalence or small-scale outbreaks of MRSA and VRE. 13, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] Frequently, CP were linked with other control measures, including implementation of active surveillance cultures (ASC) or decolonization procedures. For instance, the University of Geneva Hospitals in Switzerland evaluated several intensive infection control measures on a hospital outbreak of MRSA occurring between 1990 and 1993. 32 These measures included disinfected respiratory equipment) of the MDR K. pneumoniae. The outbreak was ultimately contained by implementing strict cohorting of colonized patients to minimize sharing of hospital equipment and of care providers between outbreaks patients and the other patient in the hospital and adequate screening of patients. For carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), in settings with low prevalence and localized outbreaks, the aim of infection control measures should be the complete eradication of CRE, according to an adaptation of the classic "search and destroy strategy," whereby patients considered to be at risk of The latest fatal outbreak of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae at the US National Institute of Health Clinical Center 47 underscores that infection control precautions were the only effective measure that eventually stopped the outbreak. This outbreak led to 18 affected patients and 6 deaths attributable to K. pneumoniae. Whole-genome-sequencing performed after the end of the outbreak revealed that infections control practitioners failed to appreciate that the most important transmitters of MDROs were asymptomatic carriers and not sick cases (infection control measures were, in fact, not intensified for the carriers) and they failed to identify an environmental source (improperly absence of significant change in total antibiotic use-expressed as defined daily doses per 1,000 patient-days-in 53 German ICUs between 2001 and 2008. 53 The exponential increase of thirdgeneration cephalosporin resistance among Enterobacteriaceae in this study led to switching empirical therapy of infections to carbapenems, and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative pathogens and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii emerged as a direct consequence. Glycopeptide resistance has been largely restricted to nosocomial Enterococcus faecium strains, the spread of which is promoted by ineffective infection control mechanisms for fecal organisms and the widespread use of VRE-colonization promoting antimicrobials (especially cephalosporins and antianaerobic antibiotics). Therefore, selecting the most appropriate antibiotic choice with the least impact on the microbial environment and host flora may help reduce the risk of MDRO spread. In settings with hyperendemic MDRO prevalence, CP are also an essential part of MDRO control. In a landmark study performed 25 years ago, CPs including gowns and gloves have been shown to delay colonization by 5 d and reduce the rate of healthcare associated infections by 2.2 times. 54 Table 2) . 55, 56 Of interest, masks may reduce colonization of HCWs with MDRO, although it is not included in the CDC definition of contact precautions. 57 MRSA and VRE. Observational studies have shown beneficial effects of isolation on acquisition of MDRO, especially for MRSA and VRE colonization and infection. [58] [59] [60] [61] Often, enhanced infection-control strategies were associated with increased compliance. [62] [63] [64] However, the value of CP has been questioned by some studies. Aboelela et al. conducted in 2006 a systematic review of literature pertaining to the use of barrier precautions/patient isolation and surveillance cultures to prevent the transmission of MDROs and attributed a quality score to these studies. Only 7 studies with highest quality scores (≥ 90%) were selected, four studies 59,65-67 were in favor of barrier precautions and surveillance culture and three studies 64,68,69 did not report a difference ( Table 3) . 70 This lack of difference may have been explained by a number of factors including low screening compliance, delays in notification of results, poor compliance with general infection control measures such as hand hygiene and understaffing. These CRE carriage are isolated upon hospital admission pending the outcome of admission screening. 48 Reliable detection of the first CRE index case in a hospital is crucial in order to implement interventions in a timely fashion. Isolation precautions should be implemented and strictly applied to already identify carriers, although in several settings simple contact isolation was not sufficient to stop local outbreaks, and cohorting of patients with dedicated staff was warranted. 49 International spread of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae from Greece has occurred to at least 9 European countries since 2007 with further transmission documented in some case. 50 For example, Germany experienced an outbreak of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae in 2008. Despite the introduction of infection control measures, transmission occurred in 8 patients. A common source for the outbreak could not be established and the increasing risk of transmission with increasing contact times suggests that transmission via the hands of HCWs was the most likely mechanism of spread. The outbreak resolved after implementation of strict isolation of the cases for the whole period of hospitalization and two prevalence screenings to search for asymptomatic carriers. 51 Thus, effective tactics to control the spread of CRE include (1) cohorting CRE-colonized and -infected patients, (2) assigning dedicated staff to cohort units, (3) performing active surveillance for CRE by rectal swabs or stool cultures and (4) intensifying hand hygiene and environmental cleaning. In order to be effective in a region with epidemic CRE, infection control guidelines should be uniform for all involved hospitals, and drawn up by a central public health authority invested with the statutory power to oversee and enforce their implementation. The role of CP to control endemic MDRO transmission. Endemic MDRO occurrence is also frequently the result of inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing, leading to excessive antimicrobial consumption and selection pressure. Antimicrobial classes for which resistance has become a major problem include fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and glycopeptides. Extended fluoroquinolone prophylaxis in urology and hematology settings, for example, is among the most important drivers not only of fluoroquinolone-resistant but also of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, since many of these strains also express β-lactamases that confer cephalosporin resistance. 52 Meyer et al. observed that carbapenem use almost doubled despite the Table 2 . the added value of personal protective equipment (ppe) to decrease the likelihood of mdRo contamination of hcWs (adapted from snyder et al. 56 and morgan et al. 55 )
