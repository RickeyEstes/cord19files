Given the available time-series data and our interest in estimating the elasticities of Chinese visitors to Australia, we specify a dynamic demand relationship in Equation (1). The number of Chinese arrivals is chosen as the dependent variable. The independent variables include three main groups of variables: income factor (proxied by GDP per capita), price factor (proxied by the weighted price), and other factors representing changes in the operating environment of tourism as well as migration flows from China to Australia. These choices are broadly consistent with most other tourism demand studies over the past five decades as pointed out in Crouch (1992) , Lim (1997) , Dwyer (2009), Seetaram (2012) , Dwyer, Seetaram, Forsyth, and King (2014) , and Peng et al. (2014) . All variables in Equation (1), except the dummy variables, are implemented in the annual growth form 2 to mitigate effects of possible heteroscedasticity. The advantage of using growth rates is that the marginal effects (i.e., coefficient parameters) can interpreted as elasticities, which is similar to the doublelog form that has been commonly used in previous studies. As the same for the double log form, the elasticities derived from Equation (1) are not changing over time, they are the average elasticities over the whole study period. With the lagged dependent variable incorporated in the model, we argue that Chinese visitors could either return to visit Australia after the first visit, the kind of habit persistence or stable behaviour patterns as applied in Martin and Witt (1987) and , or they could promote and convince their neighbours, friends and relatives to visit Australia after they return home from their trips. We explicitly emphasise the role of this factor as a determinant of tourism demand. If it is in the form of word of mouth, then this "advertising" should be taken seriously, as in a way it is free publicity. Furthermore, it is essential to know how Australia is perceived by Chinese visitors by the inclusion of this variable, which could be either positive or negative, depending on their experience while they are in Australia. From a technical point of view, the lagged dependent variable allows us to examine the effect in the short-run and the long-run explicitly. This study adopted the real GDP per capita as an income measure to explain the movements of Chinese visitors. The bundle approach combines the costs of domestic and international travels in a weighted average sum to estimate the price index variable. In particular, we make a slight variation to Morley's approach to deriving tourism price index for Chinese visitors using the two tourism price indexes published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), one for domestic and one for international travelling. Both contain price movements of airfares and accommodation. The domestic price index is dominated by a large accommodation share. It is what both domestic and foreign visitors face when travelling within Australia e the cost of living for tourists at the destination from the perspective of the Chinese visitors. The international price index is predominantly represented by the longhaul airfares for the Australian outbound. As the international competition will force airfares of all international carriers to move broadly in line with each other, the ABS 0 international price index would be the same with the price index that inbound foreign visitors to Australia would also have to face e the cost of travel to the destination (Martin & Witt, 1987; Witt & Witt, 1995) . To combine both airfares and cost of living, the Australian tourism satellite account data for inbound tourism expenditure ABS (2016) indicate that the long distance transportation cost dominates, accounting for nearly 70 per cent the total. Using this ratio (7:3), a tourism price index for Chinese visitors was derived using 70 per cent of international price index (airfare) and 30 per cent of the domestic price index (cost of living). This approach is similar to that in Kulendran (1995) , in which the ratio of 6:4 for transport to accommodation costs was applied for the Japanese visitors. The reason for a low accommodation share in tourism expenditure for Chinese visitors is probably because the Chinese community in Australia now is much larger than the Japanese community of the 1990s; the free accommodation offered by families and friends could reduce the accommodation expenses for the Chinese visitors. The chosen specification presented as Equation (1) does not include the bilateral exchange rate between China and Australia, as the exchange rate was found to be statistically insignificant during the model testing. The rationale for not using the exchange rate is that the Yuan has been heavily influenced by trade policies to promote exports from China, and is tightly controlled by the Chinese government. Analysis from FXCM Market Insights pointed out that the "Yuan has not been made fully convertible" (FXCM 2016). Furthermore, the practice of two rates, offshore (CNH) through the Bank of China in Hong Kong, and onshore (CNY) in the mainland (Desloires, 2015) , helps to de-associate the link between exchange rate changes and outbound tourism by the Chinese. In term of cross-price effects, we share the view of Crouch, Schultz, and Valerio (1992) that since Australia is rather distant from all other major destinations, price substitution or price complementary are not influential. In addition, the consistency of price indexes in the bundle approach across all possible countries is a real challenge. Thus, the inference of the estimates would not be very accurate if other destinations were to be incorporated as substitutes. Hence, Equation (1) does not include cross-price elasticity. The group Other Factors includes migration flow from China and four dummy variables capturing events that happened during the study period 1991e2014 (24 observations), namely the breakout of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in late 2002, shocks in the domestic travel supply caused by the Australian mining boom; the global financial crisis (GFC) 2008; and a trend in tourism demand for travel by the Chinese. Chinese migration is expected to have positive effects on tourism via visiting friends and relatives (Dwyer, Pham, Jago, Bailey, & Marshall, 2016) . Other mechanisms through which migration can affect tourism include: making the destination country more tourism attractive with diverse culture; business networks that connect the destination and an origin country, stimulating business travel (Seetaram & Dwyer, 2009) . When SARS broke out in Guangdong province of China in November 2002, it effectively reduced the number of travellers significantly across many countries, particularly for visitors from China. The event was modelled as an intercept change for 2003. It is expected that SARS has a negative effect on tourism (Dwyer, Forsyth and Spurr, 2006) . In 2005, the mining boom in Australia began to absorb a substantial amount of hotel rooms and air transport capacity to facilitate the needs of the FIFO mining workers Pham et al., 2015) . The FIFO activity imposed a severe constraint on the supply side of the Australian tourism sector, at least over the period from 2005 to 2007, during which aviation and accommodation services could not be expanded quickly to satisfy the demands from both mining and tourism industries. In this context, the supply constraint is incorporated as a dummy variable for the period 2005e2007. We expect that this variable has a negative sign due to the supply constraint for both transport and accommodation. The Global Financial Crisis (GFC), starting in 2007, reduced household consumption and created a loss in consumer confidence across many countries. While the GFC effects still linger for many countries, its exact time span for China is not clear-cut, since the economy grew at 9 per cent in 2008, well above the economic growth rates of many other developed and developing countries. However, comparing the performance of the Chinese economy before and after the GFC, it is clear that the Chinese economy was building growth momentum, rising upward from 10 per cent in 2003 to 14 per in 2007, but from 2008, it has actually been trending downward from 9 per cent to just slightly above 6 per cent growth in recent years (The World Bank, 2016; IMF 2016) . For this reason, the GFC dummy variable is adopted for the period from 2008 onwards. It is expected that the GFC has a negative effect on tourism via its affects to the budget constraint of travellers (Li, Blake, & Cooper, 2010) . Although the Chinese economy has slowed down, the strong long-run growth path of the economy throughout the period since 1991 has certainly changed consumer behaviour over the course of time. It is well documented in economic theory that, when growth is continuously strong over a long period, income increases become more permanent and consumer behaviour will move toward the purchase of more luxury goods. Tourism is generally perceived as a luxury consumption item (Crouch, 1992) and people might use it to state their social-economic status among friends and relatives. As such, in developing countries like China, demand for travel might be added to the household consumption bundle of the wealthier residents. That this trend is likely to apply to the Chinese population is justification for our assumption to include the trend variable. Because the trend reflects aspects of economic growth (i.e., increase travel budget) and technological progress (i.e., lower travel costs), we expect that the trend variable has a positive sign. In summary, expected signs for the coefficients are as follows. All data in this study are presented in yearly percentage change format and cover the period of 1991e2014. Due to the yearly data format, we do not need to examine the nature of seasonality in the time series. However, this issue will be examined in the future if monthly or quarterly data sets become available.
