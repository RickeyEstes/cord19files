Prefeeding blood samples were drawn at 1 h (0 d), 24 h (1 d), 8 d, 15 d, 22 d, and 29 d. Packed cell volume was measured at 1 and 24 h to estimate changes in plasma volume. Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture into evacuated glass tubes containing potassium EDTA. Blood was immediately centrifuged at 1745 × g (15 m at 4°C) and stored at −20°C. At the end of the trial, one plasma aliquot was sent to APC, Inc. for IgG (Etzel et al., 1997) and total protein analyses (Smith et al., 1985) . Remaining plasma aliquot was analyzed at Virginia Tech for urea N (Chaney and Marbach, 1962; Weatherburn, 1967) . (Foley and Otterby, 1978) are reported for comparison only. Calves were monitored during each feeding, and health problems and treatments were recorded. Fecal scores were evaluated once daily using a 3-point scale (0 = firm, 1 = loose, and 2 = watery). Clinical health was scored based on ability to stand and presence or absence of suckle reflex. The score had a maximum of 2 points, 1 for each category (does not stand = 0, stands = 1 plus suckle reflex absent = 0, suckle reflex present = 1).
