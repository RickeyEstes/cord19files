Protocols for this study were approved by The Pennsylvania State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under IACUC # 41845. Two studies were done as part of this experimental protocol. In trial 1, Holstein bull calves (n = 20) purchased from a single commercial herd were removed from their dam after birth, weighed, and fed 3.6 L of colostrum within an hour of birth. Calves were then transported for 20 min to the research facility where they were fed an additional 1.8 L of colostrum 6 to 8 h after the first feeding. Housing consisted of individual pens 2.1 × 1.6 m inside a mechanically ventilated, heated facility; bedding (wood shavings) was completely covered with landscape fabric to avoid any consumption of bedding, thus the only solid feed available came from treatment diets. Water was offered free choice, and a commercial milk replacer powder containing 20% CP and 20% fat (US Feeds, Eldora, IA) and reconstituted to 13% DM was fed at 12% of birth BW divided in 2 equal feedings per day. Decoquinate (Deccox-M; Alpharma, Bridgewater, NJ) was added to milk replacer to feed at 0.5 mg/kg of BW. At 7 wk of age, milk replacer allowance was cut to 6% of birth BW for 1 wk before weaning. Calves were randomly assigned based on date and birth BW to 1 of 4 treatments differing in geometric mean particle length (X gm ) of straw comprising 5% of starter DM. Straw was provided within the pellet (PS; 0.82 mm X gm ) or mixed with the pellet at X gm of 3.04 mm (SS), 7.10 mm (MS) or 12.7 mm (LS) at time of feeding. Calves (3/treatment) were ruminally fistulated with 28-mm (i.d.) rubber cannulas by wk 2 of life in a similar manner as . Pellets and straw for treatments SS, MS, and LS were proportionally mixed for each calf daily. The 2 pellets were manufactured with all ingredients coming from the same batch and in enough quantity for both trials. The pellets were made under ambient conditions without added steam. The meal was conditioned for approximately 20 s with 75°C forced, ambient air and pelleted at 200 kPa at 75°C. Calf starter was fed once daily at 2000 h after milk replacer feeding; the amount of starter offered was adjusted with age and was based on average intakes of calves fed similar milk replacer diets. To equalize intake, calves were fed a fixed amount of starter that changed with age and was determined by previous experiences with calves on similar milk replacer diets and by the voluntary consumption of most calves; orts were fed through the cannula in cannulated calves, except during the last week of the experiment. The different lengths of straw were obtained by chopping wheat straw and sieving it in the ASABE (2007) particle size separator equipped with 5 screens (nominal 343 size opening 19, 12.7, 6.3, 3.96, and 1.17 mm for 1 to 5 respectively) and a bottom pan, particles in the bottom pan were used for PS, and particles retained on screens 5, 4, and 3 for treatments SS, MS, and LS respectively. Calf health was monitored twice daily, and sick calves were treated per veterinary recommendation. Rumen contents were sampled 1 d/wk starting 1 wk after starter was offered (3 wk of age) at −8, −4, 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after starter feeding. Contents (about 40 mL) were strained through 2 layers of cheese cloth, and pH of the fluid fraction was immediately determined with a hand-held pH meter (pHTestr 10, Eutech Instruments, Vernon Hills, IL). Rumen fluid (5 mL) was then placed into tubes containing 1 mL of 25% metaphosphoric acid and 1 mL of 6% 2-ethyl butyric acid (internal standard) and stored at −20°C until analyzed for VFA and NH 3 . After thawing, rumen fluid was centrifuged 3 times at 4,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C to obtain a clear supernatant, which was analyzed for NH 3 according to Chaney and Marbach (1962) . Supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm polypropylene membrane before being analyzed for VFA molar concentration by GC (Yang and Varga, 1989) . A xylose absorption test was conducted to assess small intestine absorption capacity when grain feeding began and weekly thereafter. d-Xylose (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA) was administered in the morning milk replacer at 0.5 g/kg of BW. Blood samples were taken before and 4 h after xylose administration via jugular venipuncture into evacuated tubes sprayed with anticoagulant (K 2 EDTA; Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Blood was centrifuged at 3,600 × g for 15 min at 4°C and plasma was stored at −20°C until analysis. Xylose concentration in plasma was analyzed as described by Merritt and Duelly (1983) ; absorption was calculated by the difference before and after xylose administration. At 9 wk of age (6 wk of grain feeding) calves were killed via captive bolt stunning and exsanguination. Reticulorumens, omasums, and abomasums were collected, emptied, rinsed with cold water, drained of excess water, dissected, and weighed. Livers and spleens were collected, rinsed with cold water, drained of excess water, and weighed. Reticulorumen contents were strained through 2 layers of cheese cloth; the solid fraction was stored at −20°C until analyzed for particle length. In trial 2, calves (n = 25) from the same source received first and second colostrum feedings before transported to the same facility as trial 1. At arrival, calves were dosed with a capsule containing bovine coronavirus-Escherichia coli antibody (First Defense; Immucell, Portland, ME) and 250 mg of oxytetracycline (Durvet, Blue Springs, MO) administered orally, 5 mL of fortified vitamin B complex (Agrilabs, St. Joseph, MO) administered subcutaneously, and 3 mL of florfenicol (Nuflor; Intervet, Summit, NJ) administered intramuscularly. Oxytetracycline (250 mg) was administered every 12 h until 48 h from the first dose, and a second dose of florfenicol was administered 48 h after the first dose. Starters were fed after morning milk replacer feeding starting at 6 to 8 d of life; starters and straw were the same as in trial 1. Medicated (158 mg/kg of lasalocid; Alpharma Inc., Fort Lee, NJ) milk replacer powder containing 20% CP and 20% fat (Provimi North America, Brookville, OH) was reconstituted and fed in a similar manner and rate as in trial 1, evening milk replacer feeding was withheld to calves that were low on starter intake and to all calves 2 wk before slaughter. Calves were not fistulated and feces were not collected in this trial; slaughter was done as in trial 1, at 6 wk after starter was first offered (7 wk of age). Samples of manufactured pellets were collected from every second bag (22.7 kg) at the time of manufacturing and composited. Pellet samples were analyzed (AOAC International, 2000) for DM (oven method 930.15), ash (oven method 942.05), CP (Kjeldahl method 988.05), fat (diethyl ether extraction method 2003.05), and Ca and P (dry ashing, acid digestion, analysis by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy; method 985.01). Additionally, NDF with ash concentration by the procedure of Van Soest et al. (1991) without sodium sulfite or α-amylase, ADF with ash concentration (Robertson and Van Soest, 1981) , and acid-detergent insoluble lignin (Goering and Van Soest, 1970) were quantified. A portion of fecal samples was dried in a forced-air oven at 55°C for 72 h to determine DM and starch content. Feeds and feces were gelatinized with sodium hydroxide for starch concentration analysis by the Karkalas (1985) enzymatic method. Feces were collected from the landscape fabric over a 22-h period at the same time of rumen sampling and 2 h after the last rumen sampling; samples were stored at −20°C for later analysis. Particle size distribution of feces and the solid fraction of reticulorumen contents were analyzed via the wet-sieving technique of Maulfair and Heinrichs (2010) , using screen sizes 0.15, 0.425, 0.60, 0.85, 1.0, 1.18, and 3.35 mm (VWR, Arlington Heights, IL). Starters were submerged in hot water for 10 min before sieving. The fraction that passed through the 0.15-mm screen was considered soluble. Data were analyzed considering percentage of DM of each particle fraction retained on screens ≥ 0.15 mm (retained) and including the soluble fraction (total). Geometric mean particle length (X gm ) was calculated (ASABE, 2007) with particles retained on the top screen assumed to be 4.7 mm long (square hole diagonal of top screen). This was followed by reticulorumen dissection and measurement of rumen papillae and wall thickness  five 1-cm 2 samples collected from each of 9 areas), with 8 papillae measured per sample (40/area) and rumen wall thickness measured twice per sample (10/area). Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure in SAS (Version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) as a completely randomized design; a completely randomized block design with trial as block was used when variables from both trials were analyzed together (rumen contents particle size, Table 5 ; xylose absorption and rumen development, Table 7 ). Calf within treatment was a random effect used to test the fixed effect of treatment, trial was a fixed effect, and its interaction with treatment was tested in the model. Fixed effect of time and its interactions with other fixed effects were included in the model when multiple observations occurred between weeks and within sampling day. Repeated measures using autoregressive (1) covariance structure were used for intake, xylose, and fecal particle size data. Heterogeneous compound symmetry covariance structure was used for fecal pH and starch. Goodness of fit criteria were used to select covariance structures for these variables. Packed cell volume (%) was used as a covariate for xylose. Spatial (power) covariance structure [SP(POW)] was used for rumen fermentation data because of unequally spaced sampling points. Linear and quadratic contrasts for diets and time after grain feeding between weeks and within sampling day were tested using the CONTRAST statement. Least squares means are presented in tables, and evidence for statistical significance was declared at P < 0.05 with trends at P < 0.10.
