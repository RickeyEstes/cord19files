A retrospective review of the prospective database of electronic treatment records and physician-dictated progress notes was conducted for all bone metastases patients who were prescribed palliative radiotherapy at the RRRP in 1999, 2001, 2004 and from 1 January to 31 July 2005. These years were chosen because they included time periods before and after the publication of the landmark RCTs and meta-analyses. Data from patient charts before 1999 were not available in electronic form so could not be included in the review. The year of 2001 was selected as an intermediary year used to determine changes in radiotherapy prescription after the publication of the two RCTs; as such, data from 2000 and 2002 were not collected. Data from 2003 were not collected given the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Toronto, a period when radiation oncologists were more likely to prescribe single-fraction radiotherapy due to the increased chance of infection with longer stays in hospital. Furthermore, data were collected only until 31 July for 2005, given the time constraints of the data collection process. The primary outcome of interest was the dose-fractionation regimen prescribed (Gy/number of fractions). Eight demographic and clinical variables shown to be associated with the dose-fractionation regimens prescribed were extracted from the medical records, including gender, age at radiation for bone metastases, primary cancer site, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score [38] (if recorded at the time of consultation), distance from residence (derived from residential postal code) to cancer centre, date of initial consultation with the radiation oncologist, bony site irradiated, and the year of certification with the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario of each radiation oncologist. Primary cancer sites were categorised as cancer of the lung, breast, prostate, and others. The KPS is a validated functional assessment tool often used for oncology patients, with an 11-point categorical interval scale ranging from 0 (death) to 100 (no functional impairment) [38] . KPS scores were analysed as a continuous variable. The distance travelled from residence to cancer clinic was summarised: (1) continuously; (2) as an ordinal categorical variable as: near (0 to !40 km), intermediate (O40 to !80 km), distant (O80 to !120 km), and very distant (O120 km); and (3) as a dichotomous variable as: near (0 to !45 km) and distant (O45 km). Irradiated bone metastases sites were grouped into five categories: (1) spine; (2) pelvis; (3) ribs, scapula, sternum and clavicle (chest); (4) limbs, hips, and shoulders; and (5) skull and hemi-body irradiation. The year of certification for the treating radiation oncologist was recorded for each patient case and was categorised by decade: 1970e1979; 1980e1989; 1990e1999; 2000e2005. Excluded from the analysis were patients who had documented spinal or cauda equina compression, nerve root impingement, actual or impending pathological fracture(s) of an extremity, previously irradiated bony lesions, or referrals for postoperative radiotherapy to the bone. Any uncertainty of the presence of spinal cord compression, pathological fracture, or impending cord compression and fracture were cross-checked with available imaging reports. Data were collected for each episode of radiotherapy for bone metastases in 1999, 2001, 2004 and 1 January to 31 July 2005. Ethical approval for research involving humans was obtained from the hospital Research Ethics Board.
