Holstein bull calves (n = 120) were purchased from local area dairies or sale barns and were shipped to the APC Calf Research Unit in Ames, IA. Calves were received in 2 groups of 60 calves on May 19 and May 26, 2002, with their use on the study initiated the next day. Calves were approximately 3 to 8 d of age; however, age of calves on arrival was not determined. On arrival, calves were unloaded from the truck, moved to individual fiberglass hutches, and assigned randomly to receive 1 of 3 experimental treatments (n = 40 per treatment). Treatments were nonmedicated calf milk replacer (CMR; Table 1 ) formulated to contain 20% CP and 20% fat (CON) offered at 454 g/d of CMR divided into 2 daily feedings; a CMR containing 28% CP and 16% fat offered at 454, 681, 908, and 454 g/d during d 0 to 7, 8 to 14, 15 to 31, and 32 to 41, respectively (VAR); or VAR with the addition of Gammulin (APC, Inc., Ankeny, IA) at a rate of 60, 45, and 30 g/d during d 1 to 5, 6 to 10, and 11 to 15 (GAM) mixed into the CMR immediately before each feeding. Calves were fed CMR twice daily at approximately 0700 and 1600 h using nipple bottles. The CMR were mixed in hot water (approximately 50°C) to disperse fat. Cool water was then added to bring temperature to approximately 39°C and appropriate DM prior to feeding. Amount of liquid used was 3.8 L/d (CON) and 3.8, 5.6, 7.2, and 3.8 L/d (VAR and GAM) during the 4 periods. Calves fed CON, VAR, and GAM treatments were weaned on d 28, 42, and 42, respectively. Any CMR refused by calves was weighed and then administered using an esophageal feeder. Commercial textured calf starter (CS; Cargill Herd Builder, Cargill, Inc., Minnetonka, MN) was offered once daily for ad libitum consumption, and feed refusals were measured daily. Water was offered once daily for ad libitum consumption. Refusals of water were measured, and water intake was assumed to equal water offered minus water refused. No hay was fed. Hutches were bedded with clean shavings throughout the study. A small amount (approximately 2 kg) of bedding from a previous study was added to each hutch. The previous study included a coronavirus challenge for all calves; therefore, we anticipated that all calves in this study were exposed to coronavirus during the study. Jugular blood was collected from each calf on arrival into evacuated tubes containing EDTA and a subsample was collected for measurement of hematocrit by microhematocrit centrifuge. Tubes were then centrifuged and plasma was separated and tested for total protein using a refractometer; the remaining plasma was frozen (−20°C) until analyzed for IgG by turbidimetric immunoassay (Etzel et al., 1997) . Calves were blocked by Ig status, based on plasma IgG concentration on arrival (adequate = plasma IgG >10.0 g/L; marginal = 5.0 to 10.0 g/L; and deficient = <5.0 g/L). Samples of CMR and CS were collected weekly and stored (−20°C) prior to analysis for DM, CP, ether extract (Mojonnier assay), ADF (CS only), ash, and Ca, P, K, and Mg (AOAC, 1990) . Calves were weighed once weekly starting on d 0. Fecal consistency was qualitatively scored once daily using a scale of 1 = normal fecal consistency (solid appearance), 2 = slightly liquid consistency, 3 = moderately liquid consistency, and 4 = primarily liquid consistency (severe scours). When fecal material was unavailable for scoring, calves were assigned a missing value. A scour day was defined when calves had a fecal score >2. Rectal temperatures were determined on calves with fecal score >2. Treatment with antibiotics was initiated when an animal had a rectal temperature >39.4°C. Electrolyte therapy was initiated when calves had fecal score >2, or were visibly dehydrated and continued until signs of disease abated. Daily mean high and low ambient temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation were obtained from ISU Campbell Network, Iowa State University (Ames). On d 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56, blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture and plasma collected and stored (−20°C). Plasma was analyzed for concentrations of TNF-α, IGF-I, and growth hormone (GH) as described in Elsasser et al. (1998) and total protein, plasma urea N (PUN), glucose, and NEFA using colorimetric kits (Roche Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Branchburg, NJ) and a clinical analyzer (Cobas Mira, Roche Analytical Instruments, Montclaire, NJ). Data were analyzed by ANOVA using SAS (SAS Institute, 1990). Health and growth data were summarized over the 56-d study and analyzed using a randomized complete block experimental design. Daily intake of CS, CMR, water, and weekly BW and feed efficiency were analyzed as repeated measures ANOVA using the Mixed procedure of SAS. Covariance structures were modeled as described in Littell et al. (1998) . Orthogonal contrasts were used to evaluate differences due to level of CMR feeding (CON vs. VAR and GAM) and effect of supplement (VAR vs. GAM). Mortality and proportion of calves that required veterinary treatments or developed diarrhea were analyzed by χ 2 analysis using the Mixed procedure of SAS. Significance was declared at P < 0.05 unless otherwise noted. Ta values and amount of CP and fat varied between products fed. Gammulin and calf starter had higher CP than label values.
