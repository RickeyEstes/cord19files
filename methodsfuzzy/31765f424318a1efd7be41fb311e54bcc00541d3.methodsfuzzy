Pharmacologic methods include influenza vaccination and administration of antiviral medications (both therapeutically and prophylactically). Seasonal influenza vaccine contains 2 type A viruses and 1 type B virus, with changes in subtype composition based on international surveillance. Both inactivated virus (injected vaccine for patients older than 6 months, including those with chronic illness) and live attenuated virus (nasal spray for healthy patients between ages 5 and 49) are available. 52 Live attenuated virus may have greater potential for producing constitutional symptoms like headache, sore throat, and nausea and is contraindicated in immunocompromised patients and those with asthma, cystic fibrosis, and COPD. 53 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines currently recommend that children between ages 6 months and 9 years who have not been previously vaccinated at any time receive 2 doses of vaccine initially. Vaccination against influenza, particularly in response to an emerging pathogen that is spreading rapidly, can be problematic. First, the strain of virus must be isolated and vaccine produced in sufficient quantities for distribution. However, improved cell culture techniques in vaccine manufacture have decreased the preparation time compared with traditional egg-based technology. 54 Second, the ability to perform safety and efficacy testing in an environment of time constraints may be compromised. One need only recall the complications from the swine flu vaccine in 1976 to raise concerns over adverse effects of vaccination 55 (such as Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a debilitating neurologic condition with ocular effects that have been described elsewhere 56 ). Third, distribution and allocation of vaccines both geographically and demographically will create difficult choices for policymakers. Targeted vaccination of children before all other population groups appears to be more effective in minimizing spread of illness compared with randomly distributing a limited supply of vaccine (unless emergent strains were to disproportionately infect other age groups). 57, 58 Vaccinating children could prevent about one third of secondary household cases of flu. 59, 60 Vaccinating 80% of children and teenagers would yield nearly the equivalent effect of vaccinating 80% of the entire population in terms of numbers of cases prevented. However, vaccinating 80% of children would not be as effective in preventing the onset of an epidemic compared with vaccinating 80% of all people. 58 Other statistical models suggest that 80% vaccination of children could be up to 93% effective in containing a pandemic influenza, and 65% effective in preventing a pandemic influenza. Mortality and economic costs would also be reduced sharply. 61 Several antiviral medications currently are available, and efficacy against influenza viruses has been well documented, although antivirals are not a substitute for vaccination but rather play an adjunctive role in prevention and containment. There are 2 current classes of antiviral influenza medications based on mechanism of action. One inhibits the active site of the neuraminidase (NA) enzyme (an enzyme vital to releasing progeny viruses inside the host) and the other inhibits the matrix protein M2 proton pump of the influenza virus (a step required for viral uncoating inside the host cell). 62 M2 proton pump inhibitors include amantadine and rimantadine; both have been used in the treatment of influenza for more than 4 decades. 63 Neuraminidase inhibitors include oseltamivir and zanamivir. Both classes of anti-influenza medication appear to be effective in decreasing the severity of disease for those already infected (by up to 60%) as well as in preventing onset of influenza when used prophylactically (by up to 85%), although only oseltamivir is approved in the United States for prophylactic use. [62] [63] [64] Oseltamivir is most effective when administered within 48 hours of infection, and efficacy decreases rapidly by 60 hours postinfection. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu®; Roche Laboratories, Nutley, New Jersey) can be administered orally, whereas zanamivir (Relenza®; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) must be inhaled as a dry powder. 21 There is evidence of drug resistance for both classes of antivirals (particularly amantadine), but the chance of the development of widespread resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors is considered to be low. 21, 62 However, there is a distinct possibility that a particularly virulent strain just may not respond to pharmacologic therapy. Statistical models may be able to reveal the efficacy (or lack thereof) of any control measure within 2 weeks. 65 Because of these uncertainties, prophylactic use of antiviral medications remains controversial. Use of antiviral medications is not without risk. The frequency of adverse reactions varies from drug to drug, and manifestations include gastrointestinal discomfort and neuropsychiatric effects. 21 Recently, a warning was released detailing psychiatric disturbances (self-injury and delirium) with oseltamivir use in children. 66 Moreover, both oseltamivir and zanamivir are Pregnancy Category C agents, and their lactation safeties are unknown. 53 Oseltamivir dosage must be adjusted in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 10 to 30 mL/min versus a normal rate of about 140 mL/min). 67 Nonpharmacologic methods to control spread of influenza include heightened surveillance, social distancing, and planning for surge capacity. Because emergence of new and destructive pathogens is so unpredictable, surveillance is the first line of defense in the broad-scale detection and containment of outbreaks. 68 Surveillance is performed at many levels, from the local community to global agencies. In addition to formal methods of surveillance by public health agencies at all levels of government, alternative forms of surveillance can provide early clues to the beginning of disease outbreaks. Sudden increases in "rumors" via Internet bulletin boards or cellular phone text messages were noted in the early stages of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 69 (a deadly respiratory infection that emerged from Asia in 2003 that is caused by a coronavirus and characterized by fever, diarrhea, and pneumonia 70 ). Formal electronic communication between infection control professionals has enhanced surveillance efforts. 71 Social distancing refers to physical separation of infectious and high-risk individuals from other susceptible individuals in the hope of controlling the spread of disease by reducing person-to-person contact. Social distancing on a global scale may entail curtailing air travel to prevent illnesses from "hopscotching" across large areas. For example, the 2003 outbreak of SARS originated in China and spread to Hong Kong and ultimately to 22 countries, in part, as a result of air travel. 72 Five international commercial airliners were linked to the spread of SARS from infected passengers to fellow passengers and airline crew. 73 A 1979 cluster of influenza A aboard a commercial aircraft was documented in which 72% of passengers had contracted the same viral strain. 20 Efforts to limit air travel, however, would require the isolation of many larger airports 74 and consistent adherence to advice that symptomatic passengers postpone travel or seek medical advice if they have flu symptoms. 75 The decrease in airline travel after the September 11, 2001, attacks provided an opportunity to observe a change in the spread of influenza resulting from altered travel patterns. The influenza season that year was delayed and smaller presumably because fewer travelers translated into fewer opportunities to disseminate flu across the country. 76 Mathematical models have been devised to predict the onset of peak incidence of influenza during an epidemic or pandemic as well as the role of air travel in spreading disease. Models suggest that air travel does add to the number of predicted cases of influenza across the nation, and such models can also help characterize an epidemic once it has started. 76 Another model suggests that if an influenza strain is highly transmissible (similar to the spread of SARS), a global outbreak could quickly spread if even a few infected individuals were allowed to travel to just 3 major destination cities. Isolating the top 2% most populous cities from the normal influx of visitors could cut the need to vaccinate by almost one half. 74 Community-level social distancing would be aimed at decreasing person-to-person contact. This could include steps such as canceling large-scale events and encouraging workplace strategies to decrease person-to-person contact, such as working remotely from home, teleconferencing, and increasing physical distance of workstations. 77 It is widely accepted that young children most easily transmit the virus. This is attributable to the observations that: (1) children experience a large number of contacts with other children in school or daycare, (2) children are assumed to be more susceptible because of lower immune status, and (3) children could be more infectious because they shed more virus and shed the virus for a longer time period compared with older individuals. 59 Modeling of social contacts suggests that teenagers may also substantially increase the spread of influenza. 78 Because children (especially preschoolers) are thought to play a major role in spreading influenza in the community, some social distancing strategies are directed specifically at children, including closure of schools and daycare facilities. One study estimates more than 40% of secondary flu cases are attributable to exposure to a sick preschool child. The effectiveness of social distancing targeting children is demonstrated by a study showing that the proportion of sick children decreased sharply once winter school recess commenced. The entire profile of this epidemic changed abruptly as a result of interrupting the cycle of infection by sending children home for the holidays. 79 Such a strategy is not foolproof, however, because some benefits could be negated by increased spread of illness in the home or neighborhood when school is canceled. Even with school closures, preventing contact with nonhousehold children markedly increased the efficacy of social distancing. 78 In the event of a pandemic outbreak of the flu, the multitude of persons expected to become ill will likely overwhelm hospitals and other health care facilities. This challenge of so-called "surge capacity" is a concern for clinic administrators and planners at the community public health level. Efforts are being made to increase surge capacity to meet the unprecedented demand for care anticipated during a pandemic. Measures include identification of temporary clinical care areas on the premises of health care facilities or makeshift patient wards in large structures (e.g., aircraft hangars, recreation centers, churches), predetermined procedures to facilitate and monitor home care, and caching of specific supplies. 80 Surge capacity also can be enhanced by restricting elective surgeries to free up beds and personnel. 81 Benefits of using various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic control measures would be (1) a lower total number of cases of illness (versus no interventions), (2) a dampening of the peak number of cases during each outbreak, and (3) spreading out the number of sick patients over a longer time interval. 79, 82 Flattening and extending the pattern of an epi-demic or pandemic will make the outbreak more manageable and less overwhelming at any given point in time.
