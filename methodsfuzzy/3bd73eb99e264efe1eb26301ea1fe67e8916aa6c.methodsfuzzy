RNA preparation. The wildtype (wt) and mutant (G-to-C substitutions in the putative G-quadruplex motifs) PrP octa-repeat (bp 94-288 from the human PrP ORF) was cloned into pCDNA3 vector and in vitro transcribed by RiboMax Large RNA production kit (Promega). Plasmid was digested by DNase I treatment, RNA was purified by GeneJet RNA purification kit (Thermo Scientific) and integrity was checked on agarose gel. To assure proper folding, prior to any measurement, RNA was mixed with salts and/or pyridostatin (PDS, Sigma Aldrich) in the desired concentration, heated to 95 °C for 5 min and incubated at room temperature for at least 1 h. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. 6 µM RNA in 10 mM Tris pH7.5 with 100 mM LiCl or KCl and 1 mM PDS was folded as described above and measured on a Jasco J-815 CD spectroscope by using a 10 mm quartz cuvette at 25 °C to 95 °C in 10 °C intervals. At each temperature, triplet spectra were accumulated over the spectral range from 200 to 320 nm at 0.1 nm intervals. Subsequently, the temperature was increased by 10 °C within 1 min and left at the new temperature for 2 min prior to commencing further data collection. Dynamic light scattering. 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 µg/µl (3.4-27.5 µM) RNA in 10 mM Tris pH7.5 buffer with 100 mM LiCl or KCl and 1 mM PDS was folded as described above and measured on Spectro Size 300 (Xtal concepts) in a 10 mm quartz cuvette. The scattered autocorrelation function for each sample was determined twenty www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ times by making measurements of 15 s duration. For each autocorrelation function, an estimate of the hydrodynamic radius of the molecules in the sample was calculated. small angle x-ray scattering. 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 µg/µl (3.4-27.5 µM) RNA in 10 mM Tris pH7.5 buffer with 100 mM LiCl or KCl and 1 mM PDS was folded as described above. Synchrotron radiation X-ray scattering data were collected on the EMBL P12 beamline on the storage ring PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) at 20 °C 49 . The data were recorded using a 2 M PILATUS detector (DECTRIS, Switzerland) at a sample-detector distance of 3.0 m and a wavelength of λ = 0.124 nm, covering the range of momentum transfer 0.02 < s < 5.0 nm -1 (s = 4π sinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle). No measurable radiation damage was detected by comparison of twenty successive time frames with 50 millisecond exposures. The data were averaged after normalization to the intensity of the transmitted beam, the scattering of the buffer was subtracted and the difference data were extrapolated to zero solute concentration using PRIMUS 50 . The radius of gyration R g of solute RNA molecule and the forward scattering I(0) were evaluated using the Guinier approximation at small angles (s < 1.3/R g ) 51 assuming the intensity was represented as I(s) = I(0) exp(− (sR g ) 2 /3) and from the entire scattering pattern by the program GNOM 52 . In the latter case, the distance distribution function p(r) and the maximum particle dimension D max were also computed. The molecular masses (M) of the molecules were evaluated by calibration against a reference solution of bovine serum albumin. The excluded volume of the hydrated molecule (V p ) was calculated using the Porod approximation: p e xp 2 0 2 in which the intensity I(s) was modified by subtraction of an appropriate constant from each data point, forcing the s -4 decay of the intensity at higher angles for homogeneous particles demanded by Porod's law 53 . The program DAMMIN 54 was employed to construct low resolution ab initio bead models of PrP mRNA that best fitted the scattering data. DAMMIN employs a simulated annealing (SA) procedure to build a compact bead configuration inside a sphere with the diameter D max that fits the experimental data I exp (s) to minimize the discrepancy: where N is the number of experimental points, c is a scaling factor and I calc (s j ) and σ(s j ) are the calculated intensity and the experimental error at the momentum transfer s j , respectively. Fifteen independent DAMMIN runs were performed for each scattering profile in the "slow" mode, using default parameters and no symmetry assumptions (P1 symmetry). The models resulting from independent runs were superimposed using the program SUPCOMB 55 and aligned models were averaged using DAMAVER 56 to generate a consensus three-dimensional shape. The SAXS models of the mRNA constructs were deposited into SASDB 57 . Selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (sHApe). A 500 ng sample of RNA in 10 mM Tris pH7.5 buffer with 100 mM LiCl or KCl was treated with 10 mM SHAPE reagent N-methylisatoic anhydride (NMIA) or DMSO as control for 45 min at 37 °C. After precipitation, RNA was reverse transcribed with Revert Aid Minus H (Thermo Scientific) and a VIC-labeled RT-primer for 1 h at 44 °C. Subsequently, RNA was hydolysed by addition of 0.4 M NaOH and heating to 95 °C for 5 min and cDNA was separated on a denaturing 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. In vivo expression in HeLa cells. The PrP octa-repeat domain was cloned between mCherry and EYFP and EBNA1 variants were cloned C-terminally to e GFP in a pCDNA3 vector and transfected into HeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2) with polyethylenimine (PEI-40). Five to six hours post transfection the medium was replaced and 0, 2.5 or 10 µM PDS added to the cells 57 . After expression overnight, HeLa cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (DMi8, Leica), subsequently harvested by trypsinization and analyzed by flow cytometry on FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson). In addition, cells were re-suspended in SDS sample buffer, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a PVDF membrane. mCherry, GFP and Neomycin phosphotransferase 2 (NPT2) as transfection control were detected by specific antibodies (St. John's Laboratory, Roche, Milipore). www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/
