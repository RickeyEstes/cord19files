The FB samples (purity ≥ 98%) were purchased from the key chemical laboratory of natural products, Chinese Academy of Sciences. All other reagents were of analytical grade and the experimental water was double distilled water. The fluorescence spectrum was obtained using F-7000 fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Japan). An ultra microspectrophotometer was used to measure the OD260/ OD280 absorbance ratio. The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on Cary100 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia). The circular dichroism spectra were measured on J-815 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Japan). And an iMark microplate reader (BIO-RAD, America) was used to measure the inhibition ratio. 700 μL AChEsolution (pH = 7.4) was added to 1mL quartz cuvette. And 1μL FB solution (1 × 10 -5 M, the cumulative volume is less than 10μL) was dropped with micro-injector successively, and the solution was allowed to stand for 8 min to equilibrate. The emission spectra from 250 nm to 450 nm were recorded upon the excitation wavelength range of 230 nm and 280 nm at 298 K, 303 K and 308 K, respectively. Three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of the AChE and the FB-AChE complexes (1:1, molar ratios) were obtained upon the excitation wavelength range of 200 nm-480 nm and the emission wavelength range of 220 nm-500 nm. Figure 5C , the ligand is shown in green and the secondary structure of protein is shown in yellow, blue and red ribbon. In Figure 5D , hydrogen bonding depicted in yellow dashed lines. Oncotarget 57157 www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget The ultraviolet absorption spectra of the AChE and FB before and after the reaction in the range of 200-800 nm were recorded. And 1μL FB solution (2 × 10 -4 M) was dropped to 3 mL AChE solution (6.7 × 10 -8 M) with micro-injector successively, and the solution was allowed to stand for 4min. In addition, the absorption spectra of FB (5 × 10 -8 M) were recorded. The CD spectra of AChE upon the far ultraviolet wavelength range of 190 nm-230 nm were measured at room temperature before and after the reaction with FB, respectively. The AChE solution (3.3 × 10 -8 M) was added dropwise 2 × 10 -6 M FB solution. Scanning speed was 50 nm/min, and the slit width was 2.0 nm. The measured data were the average of three measurements. In addition, the changes of the content of AChE in different secondary structure were quantitatively analyzed by means of the CONTINLL algorithms derived from CDPro software. The protein structure of the AChE (PDB ID: 1QTI) was taken from the protein data bank (http://www.rcsb.org/ pdb). The structure of FB was created using ChemDraw. The molecular docking was conducted by using the Tripos molecular modeling package in SYBYL-X-2.0. The operation of TopomerCoMFA by combining Topomer technique and CoMFA technology can overcome the alignment problem of CoMFA [83] . In this work, a data set containing 61 inhibitors from [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] were collected, followed by studying the 3D QSAR of 46 kinds of compounds with the method of TopomerCoMFA by with SYBYL-X-2.0. A total of 61 compounds were randomly divided into a training dataset (47 compounds) and a testing dataset (14 compounds) . The 3D QSAR model [90] was built to predict and analyze the biological activity of FB. The biological activity of FB was measured with the Ellman method according to the following steps. Sample group: 140 μL PBS buffer solution (0.1M，pH = 8.0), 20 μL sample solution and 20 μL AChE solution (0.28 U/mL) were introduced into the enzyme label plate in turn. The solution was preserved at 4°C for 20 min after mixing. Then 10 μL dithiobis nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB, 7.5 mM) and 10 μL acetylthiocholine (ATCI, 10 mM) were added. After 20 minutes, the absorbance was measured at λ = 405 nm. Sample-out group: 20 μL enzyme solution was replaced by 20 μL PBS buffer solution (pH = 8.0), ceteris paribus. Blank group: 20 μL sample solution was replaced by 20 μL PBS buffer solution (pH = 8.0), ceteris paribus. Completely inhibit groups: substituting 20 μL of the sample solution with 20 μL huperzine solution (100 μg/mL, anhydrous methanol solution to 1 mg/mL as mother liquor, then were diluted using PBS (pH = 8.0)), ceteris paribus. And the inhibition ratio can be calculated according to the equation below
