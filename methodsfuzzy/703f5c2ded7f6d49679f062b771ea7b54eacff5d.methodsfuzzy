A mixture of carboxylic acid derivative 7 (0.7 g, 1.70 mmol) and thionyl chloride (0.15 ml, 2.06 mmol) in anhydrous 1,2-dichloroethane (10 ml) was refluxed with the exclusion of moisture for 6 h. The volatiles were evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was dissolved in anhydrous 1,2-dichloroethane (10 ml). The resulting solution was added drop wise to a stirred and cooled (0 °C) solution of arylamine (1.72 mmol) and pyridine (2 ml) in anhydrous 1,2-dichloroethane (40 ml), and this was stirred for an additional 3 h at 0 °C and then kept overnight at room temperature. The mixture was then washed with 4% aqueous HCl (2 × 30 ml) and water (2 × 30 ml), the solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure, and the crude product purified by flash chromatography eluting with 1,2-di chloroethane-EtOAc (1 : 2). The product was recrystallized from a mixture of hexane- EtOAc (1 : 1) . Method B. A mixture of 1-[5-(4-bromophenoxy)pentyl]uracil 6 (0.5 g, 1.42 mmol) and K 2 CO 3 (0.3 g, 2.17 mmol) in DMF (10 ml) was stirred at 80 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the corresponding 2-chloro acetamide 8-11 (1.46 mmol) was added and stirring was continued for 24 h. The reaction mixture was filtered, concentrated under reduced pressure, puri fied by flash chromatography eluting with 1,2-dichloroethane-EtOAc (1 : 2) and then recrystallized from a mixture of hexane-EtOAc (1 : 1). 13 16 Disappointingly, none of the com pounds in this series showed any meaningful antiviral activity. However, in further analyzing the screening results it appears that the oxygen atom of the acetanilide fragment of 1 likely makes a critical contribution to the anti-HCMV activity. Thus, the new uracil acetamide derivatives seem to be a promising class of viral rep lication inhibitors and warrant further structure-activity investi gations.
