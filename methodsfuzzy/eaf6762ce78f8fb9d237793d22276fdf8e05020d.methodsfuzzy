Intact virions or isolated viral attachment proteins have been used to identify virus binding sites by affinity isolation. For example a 110 kDa putative glycoprotein receptor was isolated from the surface of murine L cells using spike glycoproteins of Moloney murine leukaemia virus [50] and class 1 MHC antigens were identified as potential receptors for SFV [39] . The approach requires the disruption of either the virus, or the cell plasma membrane, or both. Consequently, only monomeric interactions can occur and this approach may be limited to viruses which have a high affinity for their binding sites. (ii) Antibodies against cell surface viral binding determinants. For viruses with a narrow host range panels of well-defined antibodies have been used to identify virus binding sites. HIV-1 is tropic for cells bearing the CD4 aiatigen, primarily the helper/inducer subset of T-lymphocytes. The CD4 molecule was identified as the virus binding protein using anti-T-cell monoclonal antibodies [18, 56] . Antibodies against the HIV-1 binding domain of CD4, and adjacent epitopes, block infection by HIV-1 and VSV(HIV) pseudotype virus [105] . Following binding of HIV-1 to CD4 positive cells, and detergent lysis, gpl20 and CD4 can be co-immunoprecipitated using antibodies against CD4 epitopes distinct from those involved in virus binding [58, 63] . In other approaches monoclonal antibodies have been made against cell-surface proteins and screened for the ability to block virus binding and infection. This method has been used to identify a 90 kDa cell-surface polypeptide as a putative binding protein for HRV 15 [124] . Alternatively, anti-idiotypic antibodies, produced against anti-viral antibodies, have been used to identify the binding determinant for reovirus type 3. These anti-idiotypic antibodies should contain a mirror image of the attachment site on the viral crl protein. The anti-idiotypes inhibit reo-, lillY, binding to cells and elicit both T and B cell immunity. They precipitate a 67 t l)~ glycopr,~tcin from rodent and primate cells [10] . Both the anti-idiotype and ,.,Ldiolabclled virus bind to a 67 kDa plasma membrane protein on Western blots. ]:urther charaetelisation of the 67 kDa antigen has suggested the [3-adrenergic rec cptor is the viral binding protein [11] . (iii) ('heroic'a/ cross'-linkers. Chemical cross-linkers have been used to idenl ifv viral binding sites [33, 75] .
