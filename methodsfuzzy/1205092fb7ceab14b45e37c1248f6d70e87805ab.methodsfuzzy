2.1. Identification of functional proteins in 3-day regenerated tissue of E. fetida 2.1.1. Functional protein extract from G-90' G-90′ is the protein extract from regenerated tissue of earthworm (Eisenia fetida) after tail-amputation for 3 days, while G-90 is extracted from 0-day regenerated earthworm body. They were prepared as our previous study (Yang et al., 2017) . Proteins in G-90' were initially fractionated by their solubility. Three fractionating proteins, named ES1, ES2 and ES3, were precipitated by saturated ammonium sulfate solution [(NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , pH 7.2] in the concentration of 40%, 40%-60% and 60%-80% and de-salted in deionized water for another 2 days at 4°C.
