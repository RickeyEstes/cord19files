"also accepts a groups argument which can be used to obtain stratified incidence" -Consider changing stratified incidence by "epidemiological curve". Comment 17: "The basic elements of the incidence object can be obtained by the accessors get_counts(), get_dates(), and get_interval()." -Please, number the number of basic elements for clarity purpose. Comment 18: "The function subset() can be used for isolating case data from a specific time window and/or groups, while the [ operator can be used for a finer control to subset dates and groups using integer, logical or character vectors." -If several functions are to be presented, it is easier to use bullet points to structure the reading. Consider the removal 'for isolating case data from a specific' and changing with 'to define'. "[" change to 'indexing operator, to follow the classical denomination . https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.pdf Comment 19: " Figure 1 . Generalized workflow from incidence object construction to modeling and visualization." -The first example in the paper is using a line-list format as data inputs but showed a stratified graphic. To be consistent and easier to follow for the reader, this figure illustrates the flow of such of data type, knowing that line-list is the primary source of epidemiological surveillance. A solution present in the figure is the two types of data inputs (non-aggregated/aggregated count). It would be easier, from a reader point of view, to capture the data flow from the line-lit to the final products proposed by this package. Comment 20: "The function pool() can be used to merge several groups into one," -Consider ending the sentence and explaining what it does. "and the function cumulate() will turn incidence data into cumulative incidence" -Consider changing "cumulative incidence" to "cumulative count of cases". Comment 21: […]: an option for a 'long' format which is readily compatible with (Wickham, 2016) for ggplot2 […]: an option for a 'long' format which is readily compatible with (Wickham, 2016) for ggplot2 further customization of graphics." -Would it be possible to mention how date format is exported? This might good to elaborate a bit more about date and user's customization with ggplot2. This can be addressed later in the manuscript (see proposal for a theme). Comment 22: "In line with , the package is thoroughly" -Add a RECON's development guidelines incidence hyperlink/ref. to the website: https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/resources/guidelines/ Section: Modelling utilities Comment 23: "Here, we highlight three simple functionalities in for estimating parameters via modelling incidence or bootstrap and the two specialized data classes that are used to store the models and parameter estimates." -Consider structuring the following section according to the five elements mentioned (=three functions [ estimate_peak() , fit_optim_split()] and two specialized data classes) using fit() , for instance bullet points/subtitles. For each function, the goal, data input, statistical methods and output object(s) can be grouped in single section. Comment 24: "we implement the simple log-linear regression approach in the function , which can […]" -fit() Please add more information about the structure of the 'incidence_fit objects containing log-linear models' Comment 25: "[…] fit exponential increase or decrease of incidence over time by log-transforming case counts … " -Can be simplified to "fit exponential increase or decrease using a linear regression over time on log-transformed case counts…". Comment 26: "where is the incidence, is the growth rate, -Replace "incidence" with number of new y r t" case/incident case. Comment 27: "serial interval" -Consider adding "serial interval of the infectious agent" Comment 28: "uses multinomial bootstrapping to estimate the peak, assuming" -Some explanation about the method and references would be desirable. Comment 29: "Both object classes can be plotted separately or added to an existing epicurve using the function add_incidence_fit() ( Figure 5 )." -The customization of the epicurve is well described. However, it is not mentioned how to change the layout of the model outcome and confidence interval. Indeed, some users might wish to use an alternative ggplot2 geometric object such as geom_range with a shaded grey semi-transparent band instead of two dotted lines. It would an added-value to provide some capacities or explanation and an example of customization of the layout of the "incidence_fit objects". Section: Use cases Comment 30: "Two worked examples are used to demonstrate the functionality and flexibility of the incidence package. The first example illustrates how to compute and manipulate stratified weekly incidence directly from a line-list". -Consider "The first example illustrates how to create directly from a line-list incidence object in order draw an epicurve of the weekly number of cases with or without stratification on patient characteristics". Comment 31: "while the second example shows how to import pre-computed daily incidence and fit a log-linear "while the second example shows how to import pre-computed daily incidence and fit a log-linear model to estimate growth rate ( ) and doubling time for the growing phase." -Footnote to be r included in the section about the function for more clarity.
