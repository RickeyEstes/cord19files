Bone marrow (BM) was obtained with cats under general ketamine hydrochloride (KetalarR; Parke Davis, Morris Plains, N J) anesthesia (1 mg lb-109 i.v. or 10 mg lb-1 i.m. ). The sacrolumbar area was clipped, surgically prepped and draped. Approximately 0.5 ml of BM was aspirated by a BM needle from the femur directly into a 10 ml syringe containing 3 ml of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDMEM; GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY) with 100 units heparin sulfate m1-1. Heparinized BM was mixed, placed into tubes containing heparinized IMDMEM and placed on ice until processed. Following anesthesia and BM sampling, cats were allowed to recover. BM samples from each cat were cultured separately. For separation, heparinized BM samples were brought to 10 ml final volume with heparinized IMDMEM, vortexed for 20 s then left undisturbed for 5 min to allow bone chips and cartilage to settle out. The bulk of the supernate was removed and 5 ml aliquots layered over 3 ml of Ficoll-sodium diatrizoate (Histopaque 1.077; Sigma Chemicals) in 15 ml centrifuge tubes. Tubes were centrifuged at 400×g for 25 min at 25°C. The cellular band was removed, washed twice with heparinized IMDMEM, followed by a final wash with non-heparinized IMDMEM. Cells were counted and viability assessed by 0.2% trypan blue dye exclusion. Viability averaged greater than 97% and never dropped below 95%. Cell numbers were adjusted to 2.0 X 106 cells ml-IMDMEM containing 15% HI-FBS (HyClone), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 units penicillin m1-1, 100/tg streptomycin m1-1, 10 mM Hepes and sodium bicarbonate to pH of 7.3. No additional additives were necessary to provide feline specific colony stimulating factors. Cell suspension ( 10 ml) was added to 55 cm 2 tissue culture dishes (Falcon, Baxter, Atlanta, GA) and cultured at 37°C in a humid 6% COe chamber. After 7 days, cultures were refed with 10 ml of the above medium and incubation continued for a total of 14 days in vitro culture. Macrophages assessed for IL-1 production or harvested for Northern blot analysis were pulsed with 10/tg LPS ml-1 by one of two methods. Method 1. Medium was gently removed from cell cultures and the few nonadherent cells pelleted by centrifugation. Pelleted cells were resuspended in medium containing 10/tg LPS ml-1. Then 20 ml of medium plus LPS were gently layered over the undisturbed macrophage monolayers. Incubation was continued at 37°C in a humid 6% CO2 chamber for 6, 24, or 48 h, at which point supernates were harvested, frozen in small aliquots at -70 ° C for quantitation of IL-1 biological activity and cells lysed for RNA isolation. Method 2. Loosely adherent macrophages were gently washed from culture dishes, while adherent cells were removed by incubating at room temperature with Hank's balanced salt solution without Ca 2+ and Mg 2÷ (HBSS; GIBCO BRL) plus 2.6 mM EDTA (Sigma Chemicals) followed by gentle pipetting. Cells were resuspended in complete medium at 1 × 106 cells ml-1 plus 10 #g LPS ml-1. Cultures were incubated in a 37°C, humid 6% CO2 incubator for 6, 24, or 48 h, at which point supernates were harvested, frozen in small aliquots for IL-1 testing, and cells lysed for RNA isolation. For total RNA isolation, cell pellets were lysed in 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (Sigma Chemicals ) containing 0.5% sodium lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM sodium citrate (pH 7.0), and 47 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were stored at -70 ° C until RNA separation.
