the contemporary methods that allow one to obtain rP-producing livestock that contain the required transgene in all the cells of their organism and pass it on to their offspring include intra-pronuclear zygotic DnA microinjection (MI) and somatic cell nuclear transfer (nt). today, DnA microinjection into the male pronucleus of a zygote is the most commonly used method [12] (Fig. 1) . As it enters the nucleus, linear DnA is capable of integrating into the genome of cell lines or living organisms [13] . DnA is usually integrated into transcriptionally inactive gene-poor regions and into heterochromatin. From one to several or even hundreds of copies of the injected construct can integrate into one genomic site. this technology was initially tested on mice, and it remains a reliable method for the production of tAs. this method was used to produce the first agricultural tAs. However, MI is now used mainly to produce transgenic mice, rabbits and pigs. this is attributed to the insufficient efficiency of the method due to the low frequency of incorporation of recombinant DnA into the genome and the availability of zygotes at the two pronuclear stages. the result depends on carrying out a large number of surgical procedures, which entails the need to keep a substantial number (200-300 heads) of experimental livestock and perform skilled animal handling. Furthermore, the only way to determine the expression level of the integrated transgene is to examine the original tAs and their offspring. the reproductive cycle in large animals (including the time before they reach physiological maturity and the need to obtain females producing rPs in milk from the original transgenic males) is approximately 0.9/2.3 years for goat females/males, 1.0/2.3 years for pigs, and 2.3/4.5 years for cows. these limitations increase the cost of obtaining the original tAs and the time required to organize the work. In 1997, a sheep clone was produced by nuclear transfer (nt) of a somatic mammary gland cell into an oocyte [14] . this achievement opened the possibility of developing cheaper and easier procedures for producing agricultural tAs (Fig. 1) , since most of the manipulations in this case are moved from a farm to a laboratory, where the transfection of somatic cells is carried out and clones characterized by the integration of the transgene into the genome are selected. the nucleus of the somatic cell is then injected into the enucleated oocyte, which is transplanted into female recipients. Fibroblast cells are typically used for nt. the majority of recently generated large farm animals have been obtained by nt [12] . However, the transfected cells in this case are selected using antibiotic resistance marker reVIeWS genes, which complicates the approval of the produced recombinant proteins by the FDA and eMeA [15] . Fluorescent proteins, such as the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), are often used as an additional selective agent in order to increase efficiency in such selection [16] . Systems based on site-specific recombinases are additionally used to remove selection markers from the genome of the selected cell lines [17] . the adverse effects of the nt technique include a low in utero embryo survival rate and poor health of the newborn animals [12] . this is attributed, among other things, to incomplete reprogramming of the somatic nucleus, resulting in impaired expression of several of the genes required for the proper progression of embryogenesis. Moreover, the process of obtaining suitable oocytes and their activation requires considerable expenditures of time and financial resources. As a result, one of the world leaders in the use of nt for the production of agricultural tAs, the Agroresearch company (new Zealand), has rejected the method. the company is now developing alternative methods for producing agricultural tAs. the site-specific transgenesis technology using embryonic stem (eS) cells could be an alternative to the MI and nt methods [18] . this method involves the insertion of a transgene into the genome of eS cells, followed by the selection of clones with a proper integration of the required number of copies, before transgenic eS cells are introduced into the cavity of a blastocyst, which is transplanted into a recipient female. After these cells are transplanted into the ovaries of adult mice, up to 30% of newborn mice can carry the transgene. All animal handling can be performed using nonsurgical methods, which are widely used in animal husbandry. the production of transgenes requires a relatively small number of blastocysts and, hence, a small experimental herd. However, this method has only been perfected for mice and rats; eS cell lines for farm animals have yet to be obtained. A similar approach involves the transformation of stem cells, the precursors of sperm cells, and their subsequent transplantation into seminiferous tubules of infertile males [19] . the other methods for obtaining tAs are relatively rarely used. thus, tAs can be effectively produced using retroviruses containing the required transgene [12] . In order to achieve this objective, the zygotes lacking protective coating are cultured in a medium supplemented with lentiviral particles, followed by transplantation into female recipients. the integration of one to several copies of the transgene occurs depending on the lentiviral titer; almost 100% of the offspring can be transgenic in this case [12] . the advantages of this method include efficient production of any species of tAs and the opportunity to produce tAs carrying only one transgene copy, which is sometimes necessary for scientific purposes. the main drawbacks of the method include the inability to use the introns present in the gene construct and the limitation of the transgene length (approximately 8000 bp), which is determined by the size of the viral particle. As a result, it is very difficult to achieve a high level of transgene expression using this method. A promising method for obtaining tAs is the use of vectors based on mobile genetic elements, which are integrated into the genome by transposase [12] . the gene encoding transposase and the transgene flanked by terminal repeats of transposon are coinjected into the zygote. the reaction catalyzed by transposase results in the integration of a single copy of the transgene into one or several sites of the animal's genome. this approach has been used to produce large farm animals (e.g. pigs [20] ). the efficiency of the integration of the transgene in this case depends on the type of transposon, transgene length, concentration and site of DnA injection, and can be as high as 50% [20] . However, no data regarding the levels of expression of the target gene in the tAs produced using this method have been obtained thus far. the group of methods based on infecting the organs or tissues of an organism with a replication-defective adenovirus containing the gene of the target protein should be specifically mentioned. this approach results in a short-term nonhereditary production of rPs in the organ or tissue under consideration. today, it remains difficult to compare the efficiency of new and traditional methods for producing tAs.
