The presented CPSO method was experimentally compared with two other PSO-based active olfaction methods: SPSO and WUII [36] . Considering the limitations of the experimental workload, we only chose source location DS to compare and analyze the performances of the three methods. One of the reasons is that compared with the airflow field at other locations, the airflow field at this location was more affected by the periodic variation in the air supply direction ( Fig. 6 ) and the time-dependent characteristics of the airflow field at this location were more significant. Another reason is that when the source is in the downwind zone, the spread of contaminants or hazardous substances is usually faster; therefore, DS is also a more noteworthy location. To ensure that the benchmarks for comparison were consistent, the three experimental methods used the same plume finding strategy, obstacle avoidance algorithm and other settings, such as the number of robots used and the maximum step length of each robot. Table 4 summarizes the experimental results of the three methods. As shown in Table 4 , the CPSO method achieved the highest success rate, reaching 100%, which was significantly higher than those of the SPSO and WUII methods (20% and 40%, respectively). The success rates of the SPSO and WUII methods were less than 50%, indicating that neither method can meet the requirements of practical applications in time-varying airflow fields. From the perspective of source localization efficiency, the average number of steps of the CPSO method was the lowest and was significantly lower than those of the SPSO and WUII methods. The average number of steps of the CPSO method (24.4) was 26.1% and 35.8% lower than that of the SPSO method (33.0) and WUII method (38.0), respectively. These results reveal that the presented method not only has a much higher success rate but also has a higher source localization efficiency than the SPSO and WUII methods in time-varying indoor airflow environments with mechanical ventilation. The experimental results in Table 4 also show that the success rate of the WUII method was significantly higher than that of the SPSO method; however, the average number of steps of the WUII method was higher than that of the SPSO method, indicating that the introduction of the upwind effect in the WUII method helps improve the success rate of source localization but may not improve the efficiency of source localization in time-varying indoor airflow environments with mechanical ventilation.
