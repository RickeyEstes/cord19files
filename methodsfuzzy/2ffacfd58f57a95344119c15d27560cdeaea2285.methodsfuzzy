Extract preparation X. laevis metaphase-arrested egg extract was prepared fresh as described previously (Hannak and Heald, 2006) . In brief, female frogs were primed with 100 U pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG; EMD Millipore) followed by injection of 500 U human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG; Sigma-Aldrich) at least 48 h later. Laid eggs (16-18 h) were collected, dejellied, washed (with buffer containing 5 mM EGTA), packed (200 g for 1 min followed by 800 g for 30 s), and crushed (17,000 g for 15 min). Cytoplasm was collected via needle puncture through the side of the tube, protease inhibitors and energy mix were added, and extract was kept at 12°C until use. Fractionated interphase extract was prepared from X. laevis unfertilized eggs, as described previously, into cytosolic and light membrane fractions (Powers et al., 2001) . In brief, frogs were injected as described for CSF preparation, eggs were collected (100 mM NaCl), dejellied, washed (without EGTA), and packed (400 g for 15 s). Protease inhibitors and cycloheximide (50 µg/µl final) were added on top of the packed eggs that were then lysed (12,000 g for 15 min). Crude interphase extract was collected via needle puncture on the side of the tube and centrifuged (250,000 g for 70 min at 4°C). A clear cytosolic fraction was collected and spun again (250,000 g for 25 min at 4°C) while the light membrane fraction was isolated, diluted, and spun over a sucrose gradient (26,000 g for 20 min at 4°C). Light membranes were collected and along with the cytosolic fraction were aliquoted, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80°C.
