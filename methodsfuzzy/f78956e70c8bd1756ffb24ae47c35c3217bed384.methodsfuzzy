A variety of considerations need to be made during the design of a peptide vaccine, in context of the particular vaccine under development. First and foremost among them is the identification of immuno-dominant domains of epitopes that are capable of inducing protective immune response in terms of humoral immunity and/or cell mediated immunity against desired antigen [25] . Immunodominant epitopes can be chosen in context of B cells, cytotoxic or helper T cells. For example, one of the most suited approaches is preparation of protective monoclonal antibody against the conserved regions, which may be helpful in designing protective as well as therapeutic vaccine against cancers [26] . For such a vaccine, the selection of immunodominant B cell epitopes is important. On the other hand, vaccines against intracellular pathogens such as viruses or against cancers may focus on the identification of epitopes that induce cytotoxic T cell responses [20, 27] . It is to be noted that for efficient induction of either B-cell or cytotoxic T cell responses, the induction of a robust helper T cell responses is crucial [27, 28] . Thus, epitope selection will have to be directed towards not only inducing the required effector response (B cells or cytotoxic T cells), but also for induction of helper T cell responses. Among the epitopes that induce specific subsets of immune responses, the next challenge would be to identify the right epitope(s) or peptide(s) that can activate T cells to the magnitude that can confer protective immunity. Additionally, for development of a broad-spectrum vaccine against multiple serovars of a pathogen, it may be necessary to identify highly conserved immunodominant epitopes. Another issue to be considered is the processing, presentation and association of the candidate peptide vaccine by antigen presenting cells T cells in a highly MHC-heterogenous human population. Multiple biochemical and cellular immuno assays have been designed and utilized for selection of candidate peptides for vaccines. Various strategies employing either in silico approaches or experimental approaches, or combinations of both have been followed. The inherent complexity and cost of using experimental approaches at initial stages of screening has led researchers to seek the support of reliable and cost-effective bioinformatics in silico tools. A variety of bioinformatics tools are used for prediction including, but not limited to, the translocation of peptides into endoplasmic reticulum (MHC-I), cleavage in lysosomal compartments (MHC-II), binding of antigen to MHC I and MHC II, HLA haplotype specificity, and recognition by T cell receptors. Multiple epitope predictive algorithms have been developed as briefly described below: (1) Structural resolution of desired antigen and its monoclonal antibody complex using nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography to identify interactions at atomic level [29] ; (2) Mass Spectrometry for the identification of monoclonal antibody binding antigenic epitope, and then using in silico techniques mapping them on the whole antigen to describe structure and sequence of the epitope [30] . Such computational analysis is usually done by first excluding antigen non-binding regions, and subsequently mapping the amino acid residues of the antigen identified by mass spectrophotometry analysis and the crystal structure; (3) -Mimotopesâ€– are peptides mimicking antigenic conformational structures that are recognized by paratope antibody. This is usually achieved by first generating a specific phage display library [31] . The identified peptides are then aligned to antigen sequence and subsequently superimposed to its 3D structure using in silico tools. An alternative approach is to express antigenic peptide from recombinant cDNA library and then screen for binding to specific monoclonal antibody. Using in silico tools, the selected peptide antigens can be further sequenced and aligned with antigen sequence, and if available, 3D structures can be superimposed. Some algorithms that can be of use are MimoPro, Mimox, Pepitope, MimoDB 2.0 [32] ; (4) Prediction of linear B cell epitopes using computerized algorithms such as propensity scale, machine-learning algorithm or a combination of these two, hybrid algorithm, ABCpred, ANN-, BepriPred, HMM or more advanced algorithms are BEDDPRo, SVM, PSSM etc. [33, 34] ; (5) Usage of databases containing known T cell epitopes or peptides including information of their respective MHC binding and affinity of binding, the antigens involved in various clinical conditions, HLA restriction, host specificity, primary sequence of antigen etc. In case of development of peptide vaccines, selecting the correct target MHC or HLA is very critical, as the vaccine candidate should bind majority of HLAs in the population [35] . IMGT HLA database, which gives information of MHC alleles and its polymorphism and distribution in the community, is useful for this purpose [36] . A variety of structure-based algorithms also are available for in silico prediction of T cell epitopes. They are roughly classified as homology modeling, protein threading, and protein-protein docking. Prediction of conformational epitopes can be done using sequence, structure based, or binding matrices in silico algorithms such as DiscoTope, CEP, EPCES, PEPITO, SEPPA, EPSVR, ElliPro, BLAST-MODELLER, Epitpopia, CBTOPE, BEEPro, IEDB, SYFPEITHI, BIMAS, SMM, ANN, HMMs, SVMs, PROPRED, NetChop-3.0, etc. [36] [37] [38] [39] . The identification, selection, and construction of candidate epitope(s) or peptide vaccine antigen(s) is followed by chemical synthesis of antigenic peptides. The synthesized peptides are subsequently conjugated to carrier molecules or adjuvants, as required. Immunoprofiling of resultant constructs is conducted in vitro, as well as in suitable animal models for determination of safety and efficacy, followed by progression to pre-clinical and clinical trials. Peptide-based vaccines alone, even those comprising optimal B-cell and T-cell epitopes, are poorly immunogenic and require adjuvants and appropriate delivery systems to be effective. Various particulate delivery systems have been studied for efficacious delivery of peptide vaccine candidates. These delivery systems can also serve as adjuvants. Modern day particulate delivery systems are aimed at overcoming the shortcomings of the age old adjuvant, alum. The specific limitations of alum were: lack of cellular immune system stimulation, degradation on freeze drying and the possibility of adverse local reactions [2] . Particulate vaccine carriers are discussed below based on their evolution:
