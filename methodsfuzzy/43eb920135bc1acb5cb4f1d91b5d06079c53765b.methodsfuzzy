Compounds, cells and viruses. ABT-263, ABT-737, gemcitabine, TW-37 and obatoclax were purchased from Selleck (Munich, Germany); ABT-199 were purchased from Active Biochem (Bonn, Germany); and gossypol was purchased from DTP/NCI. SaliPhe was provided by Jef De Brabander. 30 All the compounds were dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to 10 mM stock solutions and stored at À 80 1C until use. Human macrophages were differentiated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from healthy individuals and from buffy coats of the voluntary blood donors from Finnish Red Cross as previously described. 31 Human telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized retinal pigment epithelial (hTERT-RPE), Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), monkey Vero-E6, human adenocarcinomic alveolar basal epithelium (A549), doxycycline-inducible human endothelial SLK cell line latently infected with a recombinant KSHV.219 (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus) virus (iSLK.219) and baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells were cultured as described. 31, 32 All cells were grown at 371C and 5% CO 2 . The infection of macrophages, RPE, MDCK, A549, BHK-21 and Vero-E6 cells with influenza A/WSN/33 (WSN; H1N1) , A/PR/8/34 (PR8; H1N1), A/Sydney/5/1997 (Syd97; H3N2) , B/Shandong/7/97 (InfB), human echovirus 6 (Echo6), sindbis (SINV), semliki forest (SFV), bunyamwera (BUNV), measles (MeV), herpes simplex 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), tick born encephalitis (TBEV), dengue (DENV) and vaccinia (VACV) viruses was done as described previously. 31,32 KSHV production was induced in iSLK.219 cells with 0.2 mg/ml doxycycline and 1.35 mM sodium butyrate. 33 Titres of infectious viruses were determined as described. 26, 31 Compound efficacy testing in vitro. The compound efficacy testing was performed in 96-well plates in human macrophages, RPE, A549, MDCK, Vero-E6 and iSLK.219 cells. Typically, cells were seeded in 100 ml of an appropriate cell growth medium and grown for 24 h. The growth medium was changed to an appropriate virus inoculum 31 and the studied compounds were added into the medium; DMSO was added to the control wells. The cells were infected with viruses at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 0.1-10 or non-infected (mock). Cell viability was measured using a Cell Titre Glo assay (CTG; Promega, Southampton, UK). Luminescence was read with PHERAstar FS plate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). We used drug sensitivity scoring (DSS) to calculate the efficacy of ABT-263. Briefly, the dose-response curves were fitted based on a four-parameter logistic model using the GraphPad Prism 5 software (http://www.graphpad.com/ scientific-software/prism/). Based on the estimated model parameters, quantitative responses were calculated and expressed as DSS values. DSS summarises the area under the dose-response curve over the entire dose range relative to the total area between 10% of the threshold and 100% of the inhibition. Further, to favour on-target responses over off-target responses, the integrated response was divided by the logarithm of the bottom asymptote of the logistic model. To assess the selective response of a compound to a virus-induced cell death, a differential DSS was calculated by subtracting the mock control DSS (no virus) from the viral DSS. Compound efficacy testing in vivo. Specifically pathogen-free 6-to 7-week-old female BALB/c mice (Charles Rivers Laboratories, Lentilly, France) were used. The animals were housed in a temperature-controlled environment with 12-h light/dark cycles, and they received food and water ad libitum. Each group contained 14 mice. Mice were inoculated intranasally with 50 ml PBS with or without two LD50 of mouse-adapted A/PR/8/34 strain 26, 34 . 26 At 48 hpi, mice received the first oral dose of ABT-263, followed by two other doses at 12-h intervals. ABT-263 was dosed at 50 mg/kg in carrier (10% ethanol, 30% polyethylene glycol 400 and 60% Phosal 50 PG); an equal volume of carrier only was fed to the mock treatment group. This dosing of ABT-263 was based on previously reported toxicity study on mice. 22 Body weight was monitored daily and mice that had lost more than 30% of their initial body weight were euthanised by cervical dislocation. The survival data of the mouse experiments were analysed using SigmaStat 11.0 and the Gehan-Breslow Test. Statistical significance tests were performed with Student's t-test; Po0.05 was considered significant. Four mice per treatment group were euthanised on day 6 post-infection, and lungs were collected. Lung homogenates were prepared from the right lobes in 1.5 ml of PBS using a microhomogeniser. The homogenate was cleared using centrifugation at 13 800 g for 15 min at 4 1C, and used for virus titre determination, cytokine profiling and caspase activation assays (described below). The left lobes of the lungs were fixed in neutral buffered 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut with a microtome and 4 mm thick slices were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E-staining). Slides were imaged using Panoramic 250 Flash slide scanner Hungary) , and images were processed to virtual whole slides and uploaded to the web server as previously described. 35 Biochemical assays. Cytokine profiling was performed using mouse lung homogenates or supernatants of compound-treated or non-treated, IAV-infected or non-infected cells. Cytokine levels were measured using mouse or human cytokine array panel A kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Membranes were exposed to X-ray film, and films were scanned. Each image was analysed using the ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). In addition, the levels of TNF-a (tumour necrosis factor), IFN-b and l in the cell supernatants were assayed with ELISA (PBL Interferon Source). Caspases 8, 9 and 3/7 activity were measured with Caspase-Glo-8, -9 and -3/7 assays (Promega). Actin, NS1 and PB2 mRNA levels were assayed with reversetranscription and strand-specific qPCRs as previously described. 36 Production of viral and cellular proteins was monitored using western blotting and autoradioautography. Briefly, RPE cells were washed twice with PBS and covered with 50 ml DMEM without methionine (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% BSA and S 35 methionine (Perkin Elmer, Espoo, Finland), and incubated for 1 h at 37 1C. RPE cells were washed twice with PBS, lysed in 2 Â SDS-loading buffer and sonicated. Lysates were loaded and proteins were separated on a gradient 4-20% SDSpolyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE; Bio-Rad, Helsinki, Finland). S 35 -labelled proteins were monitored using radioautography and visualised using a Typhoon 9400 scanner (GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland). For a genomic viral RNA (vRNA) transfection experiment, A/WSN/33 virus was grown in MDCK cells. Supernatants were collected at 24 hpi, and the virus was pelleted using ultracentrifugation at 285 000 g for 4 h. Viral RNA was purified using the RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA was transfected into RPE cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Six hours after transfection, the Opti-MEM media were replaced with growth media with or without 0.4 mM ABT-263. After 18 h, the cell viability or caspase activity was measured. Bcl-xL-associated factors were immuno-precipitated from infected and noninfected, ABT-263-treated or non-treated RPE cells using rabbit anti-Bcl-xL (1 : 200; cell signalling technology, Danvers, MA, USA) antibody as previously described. 37 Immuno-precipitated proteins were separated with SDS-PAGE and visualised by Coomassie staining. The entire lanes of SDS-PAGE were cut and the proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin. Resulting peptides were analysed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry as previously described. 38 The mass spectrometry data were searched using in-house Mascot and the ProteinPilot interface against the SwissProt database. All of the reported protein identifications were statistically significant (Po0.05). For immunoblotting, proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond-LFP PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked using 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and incubated with a primary guinea pig anti-NS1 (1 : 2000), rabbit anti-Bcl-xL (1 : 1000; cell signalling technology), rabbit anti-Bid (1 : 1000; cell signalling technology), rabbit anti-Bax (1 : 100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), mouse anti-Bad (1 : 200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-UACA (1 : 250; Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-NP (1 : 500) or mouse anti-b-actin (1 : 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) antibody overnight at 4 1C. The membrane was washed three times for 10 min with TBS buffer containing 0.03% Tween 20 (Tween/TBS), and incubated for 4 h at 4 1C with the respective secondary antibodies conjugated to infrared dyes 680LT or 800CW (1 : 20,000, Li-Cor Biosciences, Koge, Denmark). After three washes for 10 min with Tween/TBS buffer and one with TBS, membranes were scanned using an Odyssey scanner (Li-Cor Biosciences). For immunofluorescence experiments ABT-263 (0.4 mM) treated or non-treated RPE cells were infected with A/WSN/33 at moi 30. At 6 hpi, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS). PBS with 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 was used for blocking and permeabilisation of the fixed cells and for dilution of antibodies. For detection of proteins, rabbit anti-Bcl-xL (1 : 200; clone 54H6; Cell Signalling Technology), mouse anti-BAD (1 : 100; clone c-7; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-Tom20 (1 : 300; clone FL-145; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were used. Secondary antibodies were anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 or anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated antibodies (1 : 2000 or 1 : 1000; Life Technologies). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Images were captured using Nikon 90i microscope and processed using the NIS Elements AR software (Nicon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA).
