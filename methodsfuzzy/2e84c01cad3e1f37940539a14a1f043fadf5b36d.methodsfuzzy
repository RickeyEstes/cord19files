Inventory of the major applications, geographic regions and diseases covered by PE activities in the field of animal health A search of peer-reviewed papers, master or technical reports, conference proceedings, manuals, training materials, and past and present projects was performed as follows: Search strategy. The language used for the search was English. The peer-reviewed papers to be included were those published from 1 January 1980 through 15 June 2015 (when the search was conducted). The literature search was carried out using the PubMed, Ovis and Web of Science bibliographic databases following the PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic reviews [4] S1 File. The following set of key words (in English) was used: (participatory AND (epidemiology OR surveillance OR outbreak OR control) AND animal). For the term animal, an exhaustive list of terminology (326 terms) referring to all major livestock and poultry species was used as described by Beltran-Alcrudo et al. [5] . On top of the most generic names, synonyms and scientific names, the list included additional terms based on expert opinion on the way livestock species of certain age, gender or neutered status are named. The identified livestock groups included bovines, camelids, equid, swine, poultry, rabbits and small ruminants. After all records were sorted, each study was assessed for inclusion. The exclusion criteria were i) studies not focused on animal health issues (i.e. just human or plant health); ii) studies focused on animal health issues, but where non-participatory methods were employed; and iii) reviews with no original data. The selection process was conducted by screening the documents' titles and abstracts. If eligibility remained ambiguous, the full text was then reviewed. Some of the papers not available (i.e. full text) through the bibliographic databases were downloaded through Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com/). In order to identify master, graduate theses, technical reports, conference proceedings, manuals and training material, the following websites were searched: • Participatory epidemiology (http://www.participatoryepidemiology.info/). • Participatory epidemiology network for animal and public health (PENAPH) (http:// penaph.net/about/). Moreover, in order to identify past and present projects where PE was used as a methodology, focal points at selected institutions, universities, research groups and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were contacted and requested the data described in Table 1 . These people/institutions belonged to the authors' networks of this manuscript, plus relevant authors identified through the paper selection process. This first set of electronic outreach (emails) led to additional contacts suggested by the contacted people, who were subsequently added to the list. This search was conducted until 10 December 2014. Fig 1 shows the steps applied in the search. Data extraction, management and analysis. From each selected item (i.e. peer-reviewed paper, conference proceeding, etc.) data was extracted in order to identify the major applications, geographic regions and diseases covered by PE activities. Table 1 shows a description of the data extracted from the different items. Major applications were grouped based on the veterinary uses of PE reviewed by Catley et al. [1] with a few modifications. We added the applications 'research' (that was mainly applied for research projects) and 'teaching' (applied in the context of projects devoted to promote capacity building), and excluded 'economics of veterinary service delivery'. The latter was merged with another category that included 'economics'. Additionally, the 'active surveillance' application was replaced by 'surveillance', in order to use a more generic term that also included passive surveillance activities. Finally, we came up with a list of 11 applications: i) descriptive epidemiology; ii) disease investigation and diagnosis; iii) disease modelling; iv) disease survey and prioritization; v) economic or livelihood impact of disease; vi) evaluation of disease control methods; vii) evaluation of veterinary service delivery; viii) research; xix) surveillance; x) teaching; and xi) veterinary public health. Regarding the diseases covered in PE activities, in those cases where the number of diseases was greater than two, general names were used, e.g. 'food-borne diseases', 'vector-borne diseases', or just 'several diseases' (when there was no common factor within which to group them). For studies that included multiple countries or whole regions, generic names were also used, e.g. 'Horn of Africa', 'Sub-Saharan African countries' or 'South East Asia'. Three files were created and are available as supplementary material: Eligible peer-reviewed papers, graduate theses, master, technical reports, and conference proceedings (S2 File); Manuals, reviews and presentations (S3 File); and Projects (S4 File). An additional file with the excluded peerreviewed papers, including the reason for their exclusion, was created (S5 File). The descriptive analysis was conducted by using R software [6] and Quantum GIS [7] . Geographical data on the administrative boundaries for the whole world were obtained from a spatial database named GADM (http://www.gadm.org/). Examples of PE applications. Seventeen participants provided examples of applications related to areas, including disease investigation, control, surveillance, and descriptive epidemiology. However, there were not many comments highlighting the strong and weak points of this methodology. Most examples belonged to applications in Africa and South-East Asia, but interestingly, a couple of cases referred to Europe. Participants highlighted the valuable contribution of integrating community observations in disease investigation and control activities in order to increase the success of these activities. It was also pointed out that PE has more ability to capture emerging and re-emerging diseases compared to traditional techniques, and enables the community to provide and receive immediate feedback on recommended precautionary/ prevention measures. The role of PE in appreciating the limitations of disease spread models and thus being a valuable tool to validate them and understand the disease pattern by the researcher and the community (i.e. veterinarians and farmers in this example) was highlighted. The ability of these tools to look at complex eco-health issues and solutions was also mentioned. Finally, some examples in Europe provided from a surveillance standpoint identified increased trust and acceptability of the system by ensuring that all stakeholders had a voice in the development of such programs. Areas to be improved included the fact that PE is a flexible tool, and therefore there is a risk of creating data by sitting in the office without visiting communities, as well as that budget and time constrains could limit the involvement of all the stakeholders. The lack of statistical analytical tools useful to present the enormous quantity of data generated during PE activities was also pointed out. Discussion about the provided examples in topic 1 of the discussion. Sixteen participants expressed their views in relation to whether we should consider the provided examples as a PE activity. The first and third examples were considered as a PE activity 14 times each and the second example 4 times. Reasons for considering an example as a PE activity were mostly due to the use of participatory techniques and the involvement of different stakeholders, while the use of a traditional questionnaire was the main reason not to consider the example as a PE activity. How PE activities could be institutionalized to allow for their use in policy development. We received 41 comments for this issue. Several of them highlighted the need to increase the number of trained people through the incorporation of this methodology in undergraduate programs, and the organization of different training activities such as courses for the public veterinary services or field veterinarians. It was also advised to promote a greater involvement of the research community, as this would facilitate the dissemination of PE knowledge into institutions, thereby increasing available training opportunities. In addition, a more active involvement of the research community was perceived as a way to provide inputs on the limits and strengths of this methodology and was viewed as a way to promote its use. Another route discussed to promote its use was by disseminating (through relevant case studies) the merits of PE among different sectors, such as veterinary services, policy makers, international organizations or farmers. Laboratory diagnosis or further assessment/ investigation were also identified as ways to address the need to validate results from PE activities. Also enhancing communication between farmers and those responsible for surveillance by using new mobile technologies could facilitate the use of PE within the surveillance programs. The lack of national institutional frameworks and international standards for the implementation and for the implementation and validation of PE activities was considered an important limiting factor in achieving PE's institutionalization. In this sense, it was suggested that the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) should develop international standards, guidelines and manuals for the veterinary authorities. This should facilitate the integration of PE with other existing surveillance techniques and ensure that it is guided by professionals. Finally, different examples within which PE activities had been successfully institutionalized were provided by the participants. They included the case of Rinderpest surveillance in Pakistan and Kenya, and the avian influenza control and prevention program in Nigeria. On the other hand, some weaknesses were also mentioned, for example in Egypt, where participatory disease surveillance (PDS) showed an increase in the sensitivity for the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) cases, but also resulted in a decrease in the specificity. Also, factors such as insufficient numbers of trained practitioners and a lack of both support and funding to continue PE activities limited the incorporation of PE into official programs. How to deal with possible conflicts of interest between community priorities and animal health policy, e.g. diseases important for the community that are not prioritized by the veterinary services. Most of the 49 comments received attributed the existence of conflicts of interests to a lack of a proper understanding of the community needs. The reflection of community priorities was seen by several contributors as something mandatory, since these policies should be stakeholder-based in order to ensure the support and sustainability of the system. In this sense, PE methodology was seen as a tool that could fill this gap, as it should enable a closer contact with farmers and an opportunity to organise their concerns. The application of PE techniques in the development of animal health policies was therefore encouraged to incorporate community interests in such policies and achieve successful programs. Nevertheless, it was also mentioned that some conflicts may be unavoidable, such as 1) cases of disease that may not have a large direct impact in animals (and thus may not be a priority for farmers), but still have public health effects (e.g. H7N9 avian influenza or Hepatitis E); 2) the fact that communities perceive only immediate losses, while animal health policy has both a wider and longer term view (e.g. diseases with trade implications) or 3) regional differences in community priorities across a country, as animal health policies are normally set at the national level. The organization of workshops or other communication activities in order to clearly explain animal health policies and therefore educate stakeholders was seen as an important point to reduce conflicts. Addressing high-priority health problems of the community together with the implementation of animal health policy was mentioned as a possible way to manage these conflicts. This was illustrated by the example of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) control program in Africa, which, to be effective, had to incorporate all poultry diseases that are differential diagnoses for HPAI. Finally, the importance of establishing decentralized animal health policies in order to accommodate regional differences was also mentioned. Additional thoughts focused on the need for more training and capacity building to build a bigger PE workforce. The promotion of the use of PE methods in developed countries was perceived as an important way to draw attention to PE and encourage the use of such approaches in other countries. Some weaknesses were mentioned related with 1) the possible conflict of community animal health workers to report a disease in their village that could have negative consequences for their community; 2) the difficulty to analyze the data generated in PE activities, which could lead to loss of interest in using the method (and therefore, the need to train users in managing and analyzing data); 3) the possible conflict between the interest of the international community and animal health policy within a country; and 4) financial and practicability constraints to implement actions derived from PE exercises. What are the priorities for future PE developments? For this last topic, we received 8 comments indicating the need for more training courses, manuals, and the incorporation of PE in the curricula of veterinary schools. Other priorities were related to methodological issues, such as the need to validate PE methods by comparing them to conventional epidemiological practises, and the development of stronger analytical tools adapted to PE. Other contributors suggested to develop a checklist that could guide the application of PE and to provide information on feasibility, accuracy and costs/benefits. Finally, some political suggestions were provided to enhance the integration of PE in official veterinary services, including lobbying in FAO and OIE, and for these two institutions to promote PE among national veterinary services.
