In this descriptive study all leprosy cases that had been recorded during 45 years in the Qazvin province, were studied about age group, sex, clinical symptoms, disability stage, incidence rate and typing based on the documents of Leprosy surveillance system. Results: During 45 years, 321 patients with leprosy had been treated from them 177 (55%) cases were men and 144 (45%) cases were women. Only 16 (5%) cases were in < 20 years old age group. Most of patients (118 cases: 36.8%) had > 60 years old. Multi Bacillary cases were 264 (82.2%) and Puci Bacillary cases were 57 (17.8%). Lesion of macular and without sensation was the most common sign. The most patients had been recorded during [1971] [1972] [1973] [1974] [1975] [1976] [1977] [1978] [1979] [1980] [1981] [1982] [1983] [1984] [1985] [1986] [1987] [1988] [1989] [1990] . Leprosy disease has been at the elimination phase (prevalence £ 1/10000 population) from 1995 in the Qazvin province. Discussion & Conclusion: Qazvin province is one of leprosy endemic provinces that it has achieved to goal of the elimination of Leprosy. Also less cases of Leprosy in < 20-year sold age group indicates success of program for leprosy by using MDT in the Qazvin province. Objectives: Clinical and epidemiological study of disease caused by Mycobacterium kansasii in Zaragoza, Spain. Methods: A retrospective study was carried out between January 1990 and December 1999 in Miguel Servet Hospital, Clínico Lozano Blesa Hospital, and Royo Villanova Hospital. Diagnosis of the disease was performed according to American Thoracic Society criteria. Results: The patient charts of 94 patients in which an isolate of M. kansasii had been recorded were reviewed. Sputum was by far the most common source of isolates, accounting for 79.7%. We considered 34 patients to be suffering from disease caused by M. kansasii. The number increased for the second half of the study period (13 vs. 21 cases). Pulmonary disease was the most frequent clinical presentation (98.9%). Seventy nine percent of all patients with disease were male. The mean age was 44 years. The most common risk factors associated with disease due to M. kansasii were smoking (82.4%), infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (23.5%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (17.6%), and tuberculosis (17.6%). The mean CD4 cell count of the HIVinfected patients at diagnosis was 45 · 106/l. The most frequent clinical features were the respiratory symptoms (85.3%), followed by fever (64.7%), and constitutional symptoms (38.2%). Chest radiographs revealed cavitating pulmonary disease in 82.3% of HIV-negative cases and in 12.5% of HIV-positive cases (p < 0.01). The incidence of unilateral disease was 88.2% in HIV-negative patients and 25% in HIV-positive patients (p < 0.01). The most common treatment regimen was rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol (85.3%), and the average duration was 13.3 months. Twentyone patients (70%) were initially treated for M. tuberculosis. With treatment, all cases of non-HIV-associated disease had favourable outcomes, but those of HIV-associated pulmonary and disseminated disease were poor (37.5%). Conclusion: The increasing incidence of disease causing M. kansasii is surmised to be due to AIDS, and other factors may be external factors causing either changes in the distribution or virulence of mycobacteria in the environment. Outcomes of therapy in HIV-negative patients were excellent, but in HIV-positive patients were poor. The study was conducted in a large Dutch teaching hospital during the influenza season in 2005 in a period of three weeks. All patients of 18 years and older, admitted with respiratory tract infections were included in the study. Clinical and laboratory parameters, chest radiograph, blood and sputum cultures and nasopharyngeal swab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were obtained for each patient. In addition, the physicians opinion at admission whether this patient had influenza was recorded. Results: A total of 78 patients were hospitalized with respiratory tract infections. In 41 (53%) of them influenza virus was detected by PCR. Among the patients with PCR proven presence of influenza virus, the clinical diagnosis was made in 18 cases (44%). No false positive cases, i.e. clinical diagnosis of influenza but no virus detected, were observed. Neither Creactive protein, nor leucocytes an infiltrate on chest radiograph could discriminate between viral and bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. Discussion: The present findings failed to demonstrate a significant relationship between the clinical diagnosis of influenza and PCR detection of the virus. More specifically, the virus was present at least twice more often than influenza was clinically diagnosed. As a consequence, the decision to take protective measures to control spread of the virus should not rely on the clinical diagnosis. Objectives: Despite vaccination flu epidemic in nursing homes does happen occasionally, but when it occurs during summer time it is a rare event. To describe an influenza outbreak and to assess the prophylactic measures in such a situation. Description of the epidemic: The outbreak started on the 27 June and lasted 7 days up to 3 July 2005 in a nursing home of 81 residents (R) (mean age 88 years) and 51 health care workers (HCW) Fever, cough and wheezing were reported as main symptoms among 32/81 R and 6/48 HCW on duty during the mentioned period. On day 4, one patient was hospitalized. The knowledge of several similar cases and the clinical features (short incubation, fever, wheezing and cough with normal pulmonary Xray) gave grounds to perform a rapid diagnosis test for influenza on a rhinopharyngeal sampling (RPS) despite the season. The results turn out to be positive. At the same day, 10 symptomatic residents have had RPS and of which 3 rapid diagnostic tests were performed at the time and all were positive. In collaboration with the departmental medical authorities and the staff of the nursing home, isolation of patients plus wearing of surgical masks (HCW, visitors and ambulatory residents) were decided and oseltamivir was prescribed. and started on the 01/07/05. For 19 patients and for 5/6 HCW symptomatic for <48 hours received oseltamivir (O) at 75 mg BID for 5 days. A prophylactic treatment, 75 mg OD 7 days, was given to 47 residents as well as to the 42 remaining HCW. The epidemic was stopped 24 hours later. The viral strain was similar to the winter epidemic strain of the 2004-2005 season: H3N2A/New York/55/2004. Case fatality rate was 15.6 (5/32) (2 had received O, the former only one dose, the later 15 days after the end of treatment due to a myocardial infection), 3 others had symptoms for more than 48 hours and did not receive O. The flu vaccine coverage in the resident was 93.5%. Because of the midsummer heat alert, all residents had stayed in a single air-conditioned room from 26 to 28/06. It can explain the high and rapid attack rate. Conclusion: The rapid diagnosis test has been a clue to rapidly intervene in the nursing home and to confirm the flu epidemic. As soon as the outbreak was recognized, a crisis cell has been put in place to apply the measures to control the epidemic as described in the national instructions particularly O prescription. The rapid control response was found to be quite effective. We have tested 24 uropathogenic E. coli strains isolated from a surveillance program in Nîmes University Hospital. These strains included 14 ESBL-producing E. coli (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (1) (2) (3) and 10 sensitive E. coli strains susceptible to all antimicrobial tested. All isolates were tested by PCR for the presence of 15 genes encoding known VFs. The C. elegans infection assay used the N2 worms. To compare the entire survival curves in nematode killing assays, we used a Cox regression (SPSS 6.1.1). Results: The 7 CTX-M-15, the 6 TEM-24, the TEM-3 and the 10 sensitive strains possessed 1 to 4, 5 to 8, 6 and 10 to 15 VFs respectively. The mean survival time for C. elegans N2 infected at the L4 stage were 3.01 days (± 0.13) for sensitive strains, 4.66 (± 0.36) for TEM strains and 6.28 (± 1.24) for CTX-M strains. The mean survival times for worms fed with OP50 (a control strain) are 10.33 days (± 0.98). All the worms infected with sensitive E. coli were killed in 8 days (± 0.5). This time was longer for worms infected with TEM-producing E. coli (10.25 ± 0.5) and CTX-M-15 producing E. coli (12.5 ± 0.5). Cox regression showed that an infection with sensitive E. coli strains reduced larval survival by a factor of 4.29 (P < 0.0001) compared to nematodes infected with CTX-M-producing E. coli strains. This result was highly repeatable since there was no difference between three repetitions. Conclusion: We have developed a novel in vivo assay to assess the virulence properties of numerous E. coli strains. The effects of the uropathogenic E. coli strains on C. elegans demonstrate significant parallels to molecular data. The ability to kill worms was significantly correlated with the presence of VFs; the antibiotic sensitive strains killing faster than the TEM or CTX-M strains. The molecular virulence profiles and the in vivo behaviour suggest that the CTX-M-group genotype, although adapted for survival in an antibiotic-rich environment such as the hospital milieu have a little intrinsic virulence potential.
