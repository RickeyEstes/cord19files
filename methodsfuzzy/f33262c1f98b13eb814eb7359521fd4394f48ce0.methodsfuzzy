subjective, changing for different stakeholders (15) . The criteria can also be interdependent, complicating separate assessment (16) . For instance, the case-fatality rate of a disease has a social effect, which in turn has an economic effect. Given the complexity and the challenges of disease prioritization, ensuring the process is transparent and reproducible is important (5, 7, 17) . Recent disease prioritization methods were summarized in a 2015 review by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) (5) , which extrapolated a series of best practices. Several subsequent studies were also identified (online Technical Appendix 3, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/9/17-1427-Techapp3.pdf). Past disease prioritization studies have been conducted for different purposes, such as communicable diseases surveillance (18, 19) , biosecurity (20) , and resource allocation (21, 22) , and have covered disease in humans, livestock, or wildlife. Many studies were conducted primarily at national (8-10,19,21-36) and regional (11) (12) (13) (14) 16, 20, (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) levels (e.g., Europe and North America) but rarely at a global level (44, 45) . None of the disease prioritization exercises matched the aims of the R&D Blueprint, its public health focus, and its global reach; thus, WHO needed to develop its own methodology. Several different disease prioritization methods exist (5), including Delphi processes (38, 40) , multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) (14, 26, 28, 36, 46) , H-index (42, 43) , questionnaires (11, 13, 22) , and qualitative algorithms (47, 48) . Each method has its own strengths, weaknesses, and context-dependent utility, but 3 methods most closely matched the requirements of the R&D Blueprint (5): 1) a semiquantitative Delphi process to narrow the list of diseases under consideration; 2) MCDA to rank the remaining diseases (online Technical Appendix 4, https://wwwnc. cdc.gov/EID/article/24/9/17-1427-Techapp4.pdf); and 3) questionnaires in the form of online survey tools to standardize information gathering from participating experts. The resulting methodology was developed over a year-long process, involving informal consultations, internal and external expertise, and guidance from the R&D Blueprint Scientific Advisory Group (4). Methods and tools were subsequently reviewed and validated by an external group of experts (49) and used in the review of the list of priority diseases in January 2017 (50) .
