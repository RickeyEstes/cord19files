One veterinary practice was recruited by random selection from each of the twenty-three regions of the United Kingdom (as defined by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons register) in order to source a wide geographical distribution of samples. Participating veterinarians were requested to enrol a cross-section of twenty-five dogs visiting for any reason to reflect the clientele and caseload of their surgery: it was not feasible to select the study dogs randomly whilst maintaining compliance. From each sampled dog, a faecal sample was collected and sent by post, along with a brief questionnaire to elicit information such as age, breed, sex, reason for visit and any recent history of enteric disease. At the laboratory, samples were homogenised in a 10% dilution of minimum essential medium with 10% foetal calf serum, clarified by centrifugation and genetic material extracted using the Qiamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Reverse transcription was carried out using random primers and Superscript III MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 409 bp fragment of the M gene was amplified by PCR, using Thermoprime Plus DNA polymerase with 10Ã‚ ReddyMix PCR buffer (Abgene), and the primer pair CCOV1/CCOV2 (Pratelli et al., 1999a) . These primers have previously been successfully used to detect both types I and II CECoV (Benetka et al., 2006) . Negative controls and at least one positive control were included at every stage, from RNA extraction to PCR. The positive control comprised a faecal sample, either spiked with CECoV C54 (type II, available from the start of the study) or naturally infected with CECoV 07-019 (type I, became available during the course of the study). The PCR products were purified (QIAquick PCR purification kit; Qiagen) and sequenced bi-directionally using primers CCOV1 and CCOV2 according to standard protocols (ABI Prism BigDye terminators version 3.0 cycle sequencing kits; Applied Biosystems). For each amplicon, a consensus sequence was produced using ChromasPro version 1.32 (Technelysium Ptl Ltd.). Ambiguities identified consistently in both strands were included in the consensus sequence. All primer sites were removed prior to analysis, resulting in a final useable sequence of 316 nucleotides, corresponding to nucleotides 379-694 of CCoV type I 259/01 (accession af502583) and nucleotides 6782 to 7094 of CCoV type II INSAVC (accession D13096). Sequences have been submitted to Genbank (EU339175-EU339181). Sequence alignments, nucleotide distance calculations (Jukes-Cantor), and phylogenetic analysis were performed using MEGA version 4.0 (Tamura et al., 2007) . Support for individual nodes was sought by bootstrap analysis using 1000 repetitions. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows, Rel. 14.0.0 2005, Chicago SPSS Inc. Data were analysed using Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests.
