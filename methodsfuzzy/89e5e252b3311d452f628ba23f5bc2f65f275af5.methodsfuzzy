One popular approach to handle the constrained optimal control problems is to convert them into unconstrained optimization problems. This can be accomplished by using a penalty function method, which attempts to attain feasibility and to optimize the objective functional simultaneously by optimizing a weighted combination (refer to [11] for details). A suitable penalty function of the constrained minimization problem (2.5) is where P and Q are constants that can be chosen to balance the relative costs of the infected individuals and vaccination.  In summary, we wish to approximate the solution of constrained optimization problem (2.5) by solving Pontryagin's Maximum Principle is used to derive the optimality system which provides necessary conditions of the optimal solutions of (2.7). The optimality system consists of the state system (2.8) with initial conditions, the adjoint system (2.9) with the transversality conditions, and the optimality conditions (2.10). The details are given in Appendix. (2.8) with Λ(t) = ϵE(t) + (1 − q)I(t) + δA(t) and the initial conditions (2.10)
