Each statistical method has its own advantages and disadvantages and in the current study several methods were considered to get more accurate results. For this purpose PCA-MLR, PMF and GEE were performed. Generally, PCA's key advantages are (i) its low noise sensitivity, (ii) the decreased requirements for capacity and memory, and (iii) increased efficiency given the processes taking place in a smaller dimensions (Karamizadeh et al., 2013) . Other advantages of PCA include: (i) Lack of redundancy of data given the orthogonal components; (ii) Reduced complexity in images' grouping with the use of PCA; (iii) Smaller database representation since only the trainee images are stored in the form of their projections on a reduced basis; (iv) Reduction of noise since the maximum variation basis is chosen and so the small variations in the background are ignored automatically (Phillips et al., 2005; Srinivasulu Asadi et al., 2010) ; (v) Results cannot be weighted to account for uncertainties in the measured data; (vi) PCA models cannot properly handle missing data or values below the detection limit (both of which commonly occur in environmental measurements); and (vii) MLR analysis of the factor scores was used to quantify source contributions to samples based on pollutants (Larsen & Baker, 2003; Ashayeri et al., 2018) . PCA's key disadvantages of PCA are: (i) The covariance matrix is difficult to be evaluated in an accurate manner (Phillips et al., 2005) ; (ii) Even the simplest invariance could not be captured by the PCA unless the training data explicitly provides this information (Li et al., 2008) ; and (iii) PCA is not as powerful as other statistical methods in small datasets (Karamizadeh et al., 2013) . It is worth mentioning that weaknesses and limitations of PMF method according to EPA reports are important and include: 1) PMF models require large datasets on measured concentrations (preferable > 100 samples), 2) Analysis is limited by the accuracy, precision, and range of species measured at the receptor (e.g. ambient monitoring) sites, 3) A determination must be made of how many 'factors' to retain, 4) Emission sources have to be deduced by interpreting these factors, 5) Information is needed on source profiles or existing profiles in order to verify the representativeness of the calculated source profiles and uncertainties in the estimated source contributions, 6) The method relies on many parameters and initial conditions and model input; results are sensitive to the pre-set parameters. A specific advantage of GEE is its ability to robustly estimate variances of the regression coefficient for data exhibiting high correlation between repeated measurements (Abbasi, Keshavarzi, Moore, Mahmoudi, 2018; Ballinger, 2004; Ghisletta & Spini, 2004; Hu et al., 1998) . Other advantages include: 1) The GEE algorithm has been incorporated into many major statistical software packages, including SAS, STATA, R, and S-PLUS, 2) the model is robust to the misspecification of correlation structure, because the parameter estimate remain consistent, 3) when the working correlation structure is correctly specified, the parameter estimates from GEE are efficient (Liang & Zeger, 1986; Khajeh-Kazemi et al., 2011) . GEE's limitations include: 1) in the case misspecification of the working correlation matrix the parameter estimates from GEE can be inefficient (Liang & Zeger, 1986) , 2) the consistency of the estimated parameter depends only on the correct specification of the mean model; but there is no universally accepted test for goodness-of-fit for mean model in GEE that extends beyond binary dependent variable (Barnhart & Williamson, 1998) , 3) GEE parameter estimates are sensitive to outliers or contaminated data and in that cases GEE fails to give consistent estimators and more seriously will lead to incorrect conclusion (Preisser & Qaqish, 1996 Qu & Song, 2004) , 4) In GEE due to lack of an objective function it is complicated to use model selection criterion (Pan, 2001) , 5) if the correlation parameters are not consistently estimated, GEE fails to produce consistent estimators (Crowder, 1986 (Crowder, , 1995 .
