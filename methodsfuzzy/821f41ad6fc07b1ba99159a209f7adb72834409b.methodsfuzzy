Protein visualized with silver-stained methods is com- kDa monly used in analytical gels of comparative proteomics approach, because of their highly sensitive range of detection, typically 1-10 ng of protein per spot. However, silver-staining methods are hardly sensitive to visualization for some proteins, which have not provided compatible identification using mass spectrometry. Colloidal Coomassie is commonly used with preparative gels that is greatly compatible with mass spectrometry and has a detection of 8-50 ng (Simpson 2003) . Although spots in regions A and B rectangle between healthy cows and clinical mastitic cows plasma presented significant difference in silverstained 2-DE maps, in this study, they were not different in Coomassie Blue gels, because protein samples in micropreparative gels had not effectively separated or as a result of the protein visualized with silver-stained and Coomassie Blue G-250 methods inherently had significant difference in sensitivity.
