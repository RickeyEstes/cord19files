Plasmid construction. The sequence encoding the 223-residue nsp11 gene corresponds to nucleotides 10851 to 11520 in the genome of the PRRSV WUH3 strain (GenBank accession no. HM853673) (24) . For crystallization, wild-type and mutant (K173A) nsp11 gene sequences were cloned by PCR amplification into pET-42b (ϩ) with a C-terminal His 6 tag using the NdeI and BamH I restriction sites. Mutant plasmid (K173A) was used as the template for the generation of expression constructs encoding mutant (S74A, F76A, and R153A) nsp11 derivatives for dimerization experiments. Meanwhile, to obtain high expression in prokaryotic cells, wild-type nsp11, flanked by an N-terminal His 6 tag and S tag and a C-terminal His 6 tag, was cloned into pET-30a (ϩ) between the EcoR I and XhoI restriction sites. In addition, to obtain high expression in eukaryotic cells, wild-type nsp11, flanked by an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag, was cloned into pCAGGS vector using the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. Point mutations (S74A, F76A, H129A, K173A, T177A, and Y219A) were engineered using overlap extension PCR, and the fragments were cloned into pET-30a (ϩ) and pCAGGS vector according to the same method. All constructs were validated by DNA sequencing. Protein expression and purification. For analysis of wild-type nsp11 expression, the recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain Trans BL21(DE3) pLysS (Beijing TransGen Biotech Co., Ltd.). Transformed cells were cultured at 37°C in LB medium containing 50 g/ml kanamycin. Induction with 0.8 mM IPTG (isopropyl ␤-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) was performed when the culture density reached an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) of 0.6 to 0.8, and cell growth continued for an additional 1 h at 37°C. For analysis of the expression of the nsp11 mutant proteins, the recombinant plasmids were transformed according to the same method. When the cells reached an OD 600 of 0.6 to 0.8, IPTG was added to give a final concentration of 0.8 mM. Then, the cells were grown for an additional 5 h at 37°C before harvesting. To solve the phase problem, a selenomethionine (Se-Met)-labeled nsp11 mutant (K173A) was expressed in Trans BL21(DE3) pLysS using M9 salt medium (Qingdao Rishui Biological Technology Corporation) supplemented with 50 g/ml kanamycin, 0.4% glucose, 2 mM MgSO 4 , and 0.1 mM CaCl 2 at 37°C until an OD 600 of 0.8 was reached. Then, the amino acid mixture (100 mg lysine, phenylalanine, and threonine per liter; 50 mg isoleucine, leucine, and valine per liter; and 60 mg selenomethionine per liter) was added 15 min before induction. IPTG was added to give a final concentration of 0.8 mM, and the cells were grown for an additional 5 h at 37°C before harvesting. For protein purification, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,500 rpm for 5 min in a high-speed refrigerated centrifuge (CR-21G; Hitachi), resuspended with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 ·12H 2 O, and 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.4) and lysed by passage through an AH-1500 homogenizer (ATS Engineering Inc.) at 15,000 lb/in 2 . After centrifugation at 8,500 rpm for 40 min, the supernatant was filtered with a 0.45-m-pore-size filter and loaded onto a nickel-charged HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). The proteins were eluted with elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 M NaCl, and 500 mM imidazole, pH 7.4). The harvested protein was then concentrated to approximately 2.0 ml and filtered using a Superdex200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl and 1 M NaCl, pH 7.4). For crystallization, the purified protein was concentrated to approximately 8 mg/ml, flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at Ϫ80°C. The concentration of the purified PRRSV nsp11 was determined by the absorbance at 280 nm (A 280 ) using a NanoDrop 2000c UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Crystallization, data collection, and structure determination. Crystallization screens for wild-type nsp11 and the K173A mutant protein at a concentration of 8 mg/ml were performed via the hanging-drop vapordiffusion method at 20°C. Crystals of the Se-Met derivative (K173A) mutant were obtained to solve the phase problem. The crystallization conditions were optimized, and the best crystals for both wild-type and Se-Met-labeled nsp11 were obtained by vapor diffusion in hanging drops consisting of 3 l of reservoir solution (0.2 M sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate [pH 5.3] and 8% [wt/vol polyethylene glycol 3350) and 3 l of concentrated protein solution (8 mg/ml)-20 mM Tris-HCl-1 M NaCl (pH 7.4), followed by incubation at 20°C for 5 days (wild-type nsp11) or 7 days (Se-Met-labeled nsp11). Then, the crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen in a cryoprotectant solution containing 30% ethylene glycol and 70% reservoir solution (0.2 M sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate [pH 5.3] and 9.6% [wt/vol] polyethylene glycol 3350). Data collection was performed at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) with a BL17U1 beam line (wavelength ϭ 0.97910 Å, temperature ϭ 100K). Reflections were integrated, merged, and scaled using HKL-3000 (25) , and the resulting statistics are listed in Table 1 . The structure of nsp11 was solved by the use of the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method and a Se-Met derivative K173A mutant. All three potential selenium atoms in the nsp11 monomer were located, and the initial phases were calculated using the AutoSol program from the PHENIX software suite (26) . Manual model rebuilding was performed using COOT (27) and then refined in the PHENIX software suite. Structural analysis, sequence alignment, and phylogenetic reconstruction. Detailed molecular interactions between the two monomers of nsp11 were determined using LIGPLOT (28) , and the other structure figures were generated using PyMOL (Schrödinger). The buried surface areas between the two monomers and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) were analyzed using PDBePISA (http://pdbe.org/pisa/) and PD-BeFold (http://pdbe.org/fold/), respectively. Additionally, cell content analysis was generated using the CCP4 suite (29) . The amino acid sequences of arterivirus nsp11 and coronavirus nsp15 were aligned using ClustalW2 (30) and visualized with the ESPript 3 server (http://espript .ibcp.fr) (31) . The phylogenetic relationships were analyzed using the maximum likelihood algorithm in the MEGA package (32) . The analyzed viruses (abbreviations; NCBI accession numbers) were as follows: HCoV-HKU1 (human coronavirus HKU1; YP_173236), SARS-CoV (SARS coronavirus wtic-MB; AGT21317), MHV (murine hepatitis virus strain A59; NP_740619), PEDV (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; AIM47753), HCoV-229E (human coronavirus 229E; AGT21366), TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus virulent Purdue; ABG89333), FIPV (feline infectious peritonitis virus; AGZ84515), PRRSV (porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus strain WUH3; ADO33722), EAV (equine arteritis virus; NP_705592), SHFV (simian hemorrhagic fever virus; AHH54245), and LDV (lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus; AAA74104). In vitro dimerization experiments. As the oligomeric state of the mutant [K173A; pET-42b (ϩ)] nsp11 protein is the same as that of the wild type (data not shown), the mutant (K173A) protein was purified for size exclusion experiments because the expression of wild-type nsp11 was low. Oligomerization of wild-type (1 mg) and mutant (S74A, F76A, and R153A) (1 mg) nsp11 proteins was analyzed using a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 200 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min (4°C). Wild-type and mutant (S74A, F76A, and R153A) nsp11 proteins eluted in different fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Equal volumes (200 l) of Bio-Rad size exclusion standards (catalog no. 151-1901; 1 ml/vial), conalbumin (75 kDa; 2.5 mg) (GE Healthcare), and mutant (G1A, L54A, R55A, Y69A, G137A, G138A, V165A, and S166A) nsp11 proteins (1 mg) were analyzed under the same buffer conditions. Additionally, sedimentation velocity analysis was carried out using an XL-A model centrifuge (Proteome Lab) at 45,000 rpm and 18°C in 400-l double-sector cells. The sedimentation boundary was monitored every 3 min using a wavelength of 280 nm for a total of 110 scans. Data were interpreted with the modelbased distribution of Lamm equation solutions [c(s)] using Sedfit software (33) . The obtained results were analyzed using Origin 8.0 software. The predicted weight-averaged molar masses were calculated using DNASTAR (version7.1) software. Enzyme activity assay. The RNA substrate (5=-6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM]-dA-rU-dA-dA-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine [TAMRA]-3=) was chemically synthesized by the GenScript Corporation. The endoribonuclease activity of nsp11 was examined using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) following a previously published protocol (34) . The assay was performed with 2 M enzyme and 1 M fluorescent substrate at 25°C in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) diluted with 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonatetreated water. The activity was assayed with an excitation wavelength of 492 nm and an emission wavelength of 518 nm using a fluorescence time scan on a Fluoroskan Ascent instrument (Thermo Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) and was recorded every 15 min for 60 min. The activity assays for the wild-type and mutant (S74A, S76A, H129A, K173A, T177A, and Y219A) nsp11 proteins were performed under the same conditions. It should be mentioned that purification of the mutant (H144A, R153A, D180A, and D204A) proteins was unsuccessful because these mutations rendered the protein insoluble. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the values (Ϯ standard deviations [SD]) of the results of triplicate experiments are shown. In addition, the wild-type and mutant (S74A, S76A, H129A, K173A, T177A, and Y219A) nsp11 proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Luc reporter gene assays. HEK293T cells were seeded into 48-well plates and incubated until the cells reached approximately 80% confluence. Then, the cells were cotransfected with 0.1 g of the reporter plasmid (beta interferon-luciferase [IFN-␤-Luc] or IRF3-Luc), 0.02 g of plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) encoding Renilla luciferase, 0.4 g of wildtype plasmid, or 0.4 g of mutant (S74A, F76A, H129A, K173A, T177A, and Y219A) plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000. Total transfected DNAs were equalized to 0.52 g by the addition of empty pCAGGS vector. At 24 h after the initial transfection, the cells were infected with Sendai virus (SEV). At 40 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested and the luciferase activity was measured using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) on a GloMax 20/20 luminometer reader (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and statistical significance was determined using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. Values of Ͻ0.05 were considered statistically significant. Western blot analysis. Briefly, to analyze the expression levels of the wild-type and mutant (S74A, F76A, H129A, K173A, T177A, and Y219A) nsp11 proteins, HEK293T cells were transfected with various plasmids using the same method. At 40 h posttransfection, cells were harvested by adding lysis buffer (Beyotime), and the protein concentration was measured and adjusted. The same amounts of each protein sample were then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody (Ab; Sigma). Expression of GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was de- and F c are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively; R free is equivalent to R work , but 5% of the measured reflections have been excluded from the refinement and set aside for cross-validation. tected with anti-GAPDH monoclonal Ab (MAb) (Sigma) to confirm loading of equal protein amounts. Cell viability assay. HEK293T cells cultured in white 96-well plates (Corning, Tewksbury, MA, USA) were transfected with an empty vector or wild-type or mutant (S74A, F76A, H129A, K173A, T177A, and Y219A) nsp11 plasmids (0.2 g) using Lipofectamine 2000. In addition, the different doses of the wild-type plasmid (0 to 0.3 g) were transfected, and total transfected DNAs were equalized to 0.3 g by the addition of empty pCAGGS vector. At 40 h posttransfection, cell viability was evaluated using CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, an equal volume (100 l) of CellTiter-Glo reagent was added and the reaction mixture was shaken for 2 min on an orbital shaker and incubated for a further 10 min at room temperature. The luminescence of each well was measured on a 1450 MicroBeta TriLux instrument (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The percentage of cell viability was calculated as follows: percentage of cell viability ϭ 100 ϫ (luminescence of the experimental group/luminescence of the control group). Experiments were performed in triplicate, and statistical significance was determined using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. Values of Ͻ0.05 were considered statistically significant. Protein structure accession number and statistical analysis. Coordinates and structure factors for PRRSV nsp11 were deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank under accession number 5DA1.
