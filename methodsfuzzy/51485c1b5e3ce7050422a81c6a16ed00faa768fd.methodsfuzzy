The files of children hospitalized due to pneumonia in the 2 nd Department of Paediatrics, Medical School, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, were retroprospectively reviewed. Participants in the study were chosen randomly from those that were hospitalized from January 2008 to May 2009. Information on sociodemographic variables including child's age and gender, and also clinical features of pneumonia, such as the presence and duration of fever, cough, nasal congestion, thoracic or abdominal pain and the duration of hospitalization were also recorded. Moreover, laboratory examinations, including nonspecific markers of inflammation, such as white blood cells (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CRP, and also biochemical exa minations (including electrolytes, liver and kidney function) were performed in order to find possible predictors of pneumonia's severity and outcome. In order to be more specific sodium (Na), potassium (K), urea (Ur), creatinine (Cr), glucose (Glu), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamate pyruvate transa minase (SGPT) were measured. Moreover, laboratory examinations were done at the admission of the child to the hospital, irrespective of the time of admission. Since there was no control group to correlate our findings, the study group was subdivided into two groups based on patients' gender. Hyponatraemia was defined as a sodium level of < 135 mmol/l in serum [12, 13] . The severity of HN was determined by the reports of Ellison and Berl [8] . Serum concentration of 131-135 mmol/l means mild HN, 126-130 mmol/l means moderate HN, and â‰¤ 125 mmol/l means severe HN [2] . Hypernatraemia was defined as a serum sodium concentration > 145 mmol/l [2] .
