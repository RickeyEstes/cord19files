Orsay virus genome sequencing 5 0 RACE was performed by reverse transcription to synthesize viral cDNA. Next, viral cDNA was purified by a Zymo column to remove primers and free nucleotides and then poly(C) tailed by terminal transferase enzyme (Thermo). PCR was then performed by an abridged anchored primer (AAP) and a viral gene specific primer (GSP). The 3 0 RACE was performed by first poly(A) tailing of the viral RNA and then amplification by Qiagen one-step RT-PCR with a GSP primer and an oligo dT primer. PCR amplicons were cloned into a pCR4 TOPO TA vector and then sequenced by Sanger chemistry. The complete Orsay RNA1 and RNA2 segment sequences have been deposited in GenBank (HM030970, HM030971) .
