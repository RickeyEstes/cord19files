Four cohorts of the LSAY database were used. Two of those cohorts did not go through the GFC during the time period covered in the study: birth cohorts 1981 (n ϭ 9,738; ages covered 17-25) and 1984 (n ϭ 9548; ages covered 17-26). Two cohorts did experience the GFC during the study: birth cohorts 1987 at age 22 (n ϭ 9,378; ages covered 17-26) and 1990 at age 19 (n ϭ 9,353; ages covered 17-23). The cohorts are named after the modal birth year. The structure of the data is represented in Figure 1 . The 1981 and 1984 cohorts reflect representative samples of Australian year nine students with wellbeing data collected 2 years later. The 1987 and 1990 cohorts represent longitudinal extensions of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a representative sample of 15-year-olds where wellbeing data was collected a year later. Harmonization was based on modal grade in school rather than age in years. As a result there is a difference of several months in the average age of the cohorts for the waves of interest with the average age gradually increasing from 1981 to 1990 cohorts. This may be due in part to differences in how data was collected, but may also reflect a growing preference for later school intake ages by parents (see Edwards, Taylor, & Fiorini, 2011) . Population weighted demographics for each cohort can be found in Table 1 . All cohorts used a two-stage sampling procedure. The primary sampling unit was schools, selected with probability proportional to size. A random sample of students was then selected from within each school. Weights are provided that aim to account for (a) particular design effect including the disproportionate sampling of schools and (b) participant attrition (Marks & Long, 2000) . Thus the sample weights aim to provide unbiased estimates of the population consistently across the waves of the study.
