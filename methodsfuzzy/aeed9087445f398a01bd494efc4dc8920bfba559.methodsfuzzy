The accuracies of the health hazard prediction models using ANNs, nu-SVR, epsilon-SVR and random forest, are shown in Table 2 . We can find that two ANNs' methods outperform the SVM regression methods and the random forest regression method in forecasting the next day PHI, and the single hidden layer ANNs trained by ELM achieve slightly higher prediction accuracy than the multiple hidden layers ANNs trained by BP. In detail, when only physical sensor features or social sensor features are inputted (P columns and S columns in Table 2 ), ANNs (ELM-ANN and BP-ANN) achieve very similar performance as the other three methods, especially the random forest regression method. However, when both kinds of features are jointly inputted (PþS columns in Table 2 ), ELM-ANN outperforms nu-SVR and epsilon-SVR for all eight cities, and outperforms Random Forest for six cities. The average RMSE is about 10.5% smaller than that of nu-SVR, 12.5% smaller than that of epsilon-SVR and 5.2% smaller than that of Random Forest. Meanwhile, when the network diffusion is considered (PþDS columns in Table 2 ), we can get similar comparison results. On the other hand, we can find that another ANN model trained by BP achieves similar accuracy as that trained by ELM, which confirms that ANNs are suitable to in our application of forecasting smog-related health hazard.
