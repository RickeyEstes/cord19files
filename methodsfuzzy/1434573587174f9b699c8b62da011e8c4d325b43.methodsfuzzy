Ten-to twelve-week-old female Lewis rats (Rt-I', 150.-200 g, Microbiological Associates) were lethally irradiated with 960 rad and from a cesium-137 smallanimal irradiator 1 day prior to transplant. At Day 0, the rats received either (Al no transplant (radiation control): (BJ 6 x LO7 nucleated bone marrow cells from pooled lo-to 12-week-old Lewis rats; (Cl 6 x 10' nucleated bone marrow cells from pooled 24-to 30-week-old female AC1 (Rt-1") rat donors: or CD) 6 x 10' nucleated marrow and 3 x lo7 spleen mononuclear cells from the same pool of AC1 donors. Bone marrow and spleen cells were prepared as decribed previously (32) . All rats were injected with intraperitoneal Bactrim (generously supplied by Hoffman-La Roche) (33) and subcutaneous gentamicin for 10 days as well as drinking acidified water supplemented with nonabsorbable polymyxin and neomycin ( -2 days to + 8 days) followed by acidified water for the duration of the experiment. The animals were examined and weighed three times per week. Three animals from each transplant group were sacrificed at Days 2, 5, 8, 14, 17, 21, and 28. Sections of the following tissues were removed and fixed in IO?% neutral-buffered formalin: thymus, cervical lymph node, mesenteric lymph node, spleen, tibia, skin, tongue, upper and lower esophagus, liver, intestines, lungs, mainstem bronchi, serous and mutinous salivary glands, lacrimal gland, harderian gland, eye, kidney, adrenal gland, pancreas, ovary, uterus, urinary bladder, heart, brain cortex and cerebellum, skeletal muscle, thyroid gland, and synovium from the knee. Five-micron sections were cut from paraffin-embedded tissues and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and in some tissues, with Masson trichrome stains. RESULTS The lethally irradiated rats which did not reaceive a bone marrow transplant showed persistence of scattered neutrophils at 2 and 5 days post-transplant and megakaryocytes at 2 days post-transplant. There was no evidence of repopulation at 8 days. The rats which received syngeneic bone marrow after lethal irradiation had persistence of neutrophils, basophils, and megakaryocytes at 2 days posttransplant. By 5 days there were multiple small colonies of erythroid precursors, myeloid precursors, and immature megakaryocytes. By Day 14, there was 60 to 80% cellularity of the bone marrow with maturation of all three hematopoietic elements. Rats who received either allogeneic bone marrow or marrow and spleen cells did not have any delay in repopulation compared to rats receiving syngeneic bone marrow. At 2 days following irradiation, the thymus was similar in all groups. The cortex was replaced with large histiocytes. The medulla contained scattered small lym- phocytes and prominent epithelial cells with elongated bland appearing nuclei. Hassall's corpuscles, normally not readily identified in the rat, were prominent at this stage (Fig. 1) . The rats which did not receive a transplant showed limited repopulation of the cortex and medulla by Day 8 with small lymphocytes. With syngeneic bone marrow, lymphoblasts were evident by Day 5 in both the cortex and medulla. These were replaced with small lymphocytes in the cortex by Day 8. By Day 14 there were nearly normal numbers of small lymphocytes in the cortex and medulla with sharp demarcation (Fig. 2) . The thymus in rats receiving allogeneic bone marrow transiently contained medium-sized lymphocytes in the cortex at Day 8. From Days 14 through 28, however, the cortex contained only large foamy histiocytes, while the medulla showed increased perivascular fibrosis (Fig. 3) . The epithelial cells and Hassall's corpuscles seen at Day 2 were no longer evident. With allogeneic bone marrow and spleen, the thymus had a more prolonged repopulation of the cortex and medulla with medium sized lymphocytes (Days 8 to 21). Throughout this period, both regions were hypocellular compared to the normal thymus and rats with syngeneic transplants. By Day 28, the thymus glands in these rats also were markedly hypocellular with fibrosis and depletion of medullary epithelial cells. The developing morphology of the spleen after irradiation and marrow transplantation is detailed in Table 1 . Two days after irradiation, the white pulp was quite hypocellular, with a mixture of small lymphocytes and large histiocytic cells. Mitoses were not present. Occasionally, pyknotic cells and karyorrhexis were observed. No follicles were evident. The red pulp contained many histiocytes (some with hemosiderin), stromal cells, and red cells. The endothelial cells of the arterioles were vacuolated, appreciably decreasing the diameter of the lumen. By Day 8 the spleen of rats which received no transplant was nearly acellular. The stroma of the red pulp extended up to the arteriolar adventitia. Scattered histiocytes were present in the red pulp. In contrast, recipients of syngeneic bone marrow had increased numbers of blasts and medium-sized lymphocytes in the white pulp as early as Day 5. Many cells had a single prominent nucleolus and basophilic cytoplasm. By Day 14, these were replaced with predominantly small lymphocytes. Well-defined follicles were present with small lymphocytes, but were still hypocellular and without germinal centers. Germinal centers were evident by Day 21 and appeared quite distinct at Day 28. Extramedullary hematopoiesis was evident in the Day 5 spleens and was prominent with marked erythropoiesis from Days 14 through 21. The recipients of allogeneic bone marrow with major Rt-1 discrepancy also demonstrated an immunoblast response in the periarteriolar region by Day 5. The morphologic characteristics and intensity at this time did not differ from syngeneic rats. Instead of maturing, however, the periarteriolar blasts persisted through Day 21, and eccentric follicles did not develop. By Day 28, the white pulp was quite hypocellular. In the red pulp, extramedullary hematopoiesis persisted through Day 28 with prominent erythropoiesis. With allogeneic bone marrow plus spleen cells, the spleen was qualitatively similar to that seen with bone marrow alone. The intensity of blast response was greater at 5 through 17 days. At 28 days however, the periarteriolar region was markedly hypocellular and eccentric follicles failed to develop.
