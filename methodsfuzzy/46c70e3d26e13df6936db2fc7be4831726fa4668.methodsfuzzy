Eighteen extensive sheep farms with previous history of high lamb losses attributed to scouring were randomly selected for this experiment. At the time of the trial all the flocks presented natural outbreaks of diarrhoea affecting lambs in the first 2 weeks of life, with a prevalence of 20-80%. The farms were located in the same geographical area (La Serena, Southwest Spain) and they were managed under similar health, nutrition and husbandry practices. On each of the 18 farms, lambs were examined to identify "scouring lambs" with active diarrhoea, fever, tachypnea, dullness and a dehydration of 5-10%. The number of lambs selected in each farm was proportional to the prevalence of the scouring syndrome in the flock, with a total of 240 lambs with diarrhoea included in the study. At the time of the first physical examination samples of faeces were taken from the rectum of the lambs using sterile culture swabs (eurotubo ® , IASA, Barcelona, Spain). The scouring lambs received 400 mL of an intravenous Ringer lactate solution (Solución Ringer Lactato ® , Braun, Barcelona, Spain) initially, and then they were rehydrated as many times as necessary. After 24 h, once the etiological diagnosis was known, half of the patients were treated with two daily doses of 20 mg/kg live weight spectinomycin for 3 days (Spectamporcelet ® , Ceva, Barcelona, Spain) and an oral dose of 0.07 mg/kg live weight halofuginone (Halocur ® , Intervet, Spain) once a day for 3 days, while the rest of the animals only received halofuginone. All the animals were under veterinary supervision. Experienced teams of observers monitored lambs at regular intervals to assess the outcome of treatment. During this period the lambs with unfavourable evolution were submitted to a final clinical examination and 2.5 mL blood were withdrawn from the jugular vein of each lamb into sterile clotting, EDTA and 3.2% trisodium citrate tubes (eurotubo ® , IASA, Spain). At the same time, a certain number of healthy lambs in each farm, 25 in total (control group), were selected and sampled for comparison of the levels of endotoxin and fibrinogen in blood. Then, the deceased lambs were submitted to necroscopy and further pathological and microbiological studies.
