Sampling. Nasal swabs and lung tissue samples were gathered from cattle from the Erzurum district and its neighbouring provinces. Table 1 shows the origin and quantity of the collected samples. A total of 155 animals were used in the study (92 males and 63 females). The herd consisted of cross-breeds of brown Swiss, Holstein, and Simmental. The age of the animals ranged between 9 months and 5 years and their mean age was 1.4 years. The males were in the fattening period and kept in open sheds; the lactating females were housed in free stall barns. Samples were acquired from animals with nasal discharge and severe coughing. In total 155 samples were collected including 28 lung tissue samples and 127 nasal swabs. Although sampling was performed throughout the year, the winter and autumn months were generally preferred as the sampling period (Table 1) .
