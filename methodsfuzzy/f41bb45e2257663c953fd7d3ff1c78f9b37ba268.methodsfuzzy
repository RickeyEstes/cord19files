Approximately half (44%) of the surveys employed convenience sampling, in which subjects were selected based on their convenient accessibility to researchers. 57 This sampling technique was also used for the sake of comparing data collection tools, 18, 49, 50, 56, 58 data collection methods, 59 or study designs. 10, 17, 50 Seven surveys used random sampling. 5, 26, 28, 34, 35, 51 Among these studies, only two surveys were considered representative of the entire country, 26, 28 and the remaining surveys were representative of a region 34, 35 or a city or town. 5, 51 Three surveys employed multi-stage sampling, 15, 38, 39 and 10 surveys stratified sampling 12, 14, 25, 37, [40] [41] [42] 47 that are easier to implement with respect to random sampling and can still remain representative. In addition, 10 surveys relied on quota sampling, which aimed to represent certain characteristics of a population ( e.g., age, sex, geography, etc). Of these surveys, nine were conducted at the whole-country level, 6, 13, 32 and one survey focused on one specific region. 36 In addition, one survey used mixed samplings, in which a convenience sample of students was obtained in two schools, and a random sample of the general population was obtained in one province. 33 Five surveys used an online respondent-driven method, which can be considered as a snowball or chain sampling technique. 31, 45, 60 Only one survey did not state information on sampling techniques. 34 Finally, three surveys conducted at the general population level used a convenience sample, 29, 44, 50 therefore not relying on a sampling frame. More details on the distribution of sampling schemes based on time and regions are presented in eFigure 3; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B552.
