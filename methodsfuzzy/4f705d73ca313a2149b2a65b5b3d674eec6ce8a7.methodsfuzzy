The study was designed to be exploratory; therefore, hypothesis tests were considered to be descriptive rather that inferential. Consequently, no multiplicity adjustments to the results of the hypothesis tests were made. Descriptive statistical analysis used SAS version 9.1 software in a UNIX reporting environment. While there were no formal power or sample size calculations, a sample size of 150 subjects per treatment was chosen to support the nature of asthma exacerbations as infrequently occurring events. The analysis population was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all subjects randomized to study drug. Secondary measures of efficacy were summarized by treatment group and included severity of asthma symptoms associated with positive viral sample and exacerbations associated with positive viral sample. Exacerbations associated with positive viral sample were analyzed in the same manner as the primary efficacy measure.
