Ethics statement. Collection of canine saliva samples was a nonregulated procedure, and hence ethical approval was not required. Similarly, no ethical approval was required for collection of canine stool and serum samples, as these were either animal waste products, surplus to diagnostic requirements, or derived from a previously published and ethically approved study (25) . Canine gastrointestinal tissue samples were donated by a large pharmaceutical company; the six dogs had been bred for scientific research but were deemed unsuitable for this purpose and were humanely euthanized. Human saliva samples were collected as part of a previous study (26) , approved by the Nantes University Hospital Review Board (study no. BRD02/2-P), with informed written consent obtained from all saliva donors. Samples. Stool samples were collected from dogs admitted to six participating United Kingdom veterinary clinics in Suffolk, Kent, Lincolnshire, Middlesex, and Cambridgeshire. Dogs were recruited to the study if they passed stools while hospitalized, and with owner consent, stools were collected by veterinary personnel. An additional 10 samples were collected from Wood Green Animal Shelter, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom, from dogs suspected to have infectious gastroenteritis. All stool samples were stored at Ϫ20°C until and during transportation to the laboratory, whereafter they were stored at Ϫ80°C prior to extraction of RNA. Control stool samples from non-veterinary patients were collected from healthy dogs owned by veterinary staff, as well as from dogs at participating boarding kennels. Basic case data were recorded for each dog from which a stool sample was collected, including age, breed, sex, reason for admission, and any recent history of enteric disease. Canine serum samples were obtained from two separate dog populations. Samples from 1999 to 2001 were collected from a rehoming kennel as part of an existing study (25) . Serum samples from 2012 to 2013 were surplus to diagnostic requirements, obtained from veterinary patients at the Royal Veterinary College, London, from which blood was collected for biochemical analysis for diagnostic purposes. Canine saliva samples were collected from 23 dogs at Wood Green Animal Shelter, Huntingdon, United Kingdom (numbered 1 to 23), and a further 3 samples were collected from three of the dogs at a pharmacological research company in the United Kingdom (labeled D, E, and F). The dogs at the animal shelter were mixed breeds, whereas the research dogs were beagles. Sample collection was achieved using a children's swab (Salimetrics, Newmarket, United Kingdom), from which saliva was extracted. Human saliva samples were collected as part of a previous study (26) . Canine tissue samples were donated from six healthy 18-month-old female dogs (labeled A to F) that had been humanely euthanized as surplus to industry research requirements. Sections of the gastrointestinal tract (1 cm 2 ) were dissected as previously described (23) . Briefly, either samples from the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon were fixed and then embedded in paraffin and sectioned, or sections were lysed and homogenized to generate scraping samples. RNA extraction and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Stools were diluted 10% (wt/vol) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.2), and solids were removed by centrifugation at 8,000 ϫ g for 5 min. Viral nucleic acid was extracted from 140l of each clarified stool suspension with the GenElute mammalian total RNA miniprep kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An internal extraction control was added to each sample during nucleic acid extraction to verify removal of PCR inhibitors and enable precise quantification of viral nucleic acid. A fixed amount of equine arteritis virus (EAV) RNA was added with the lysis buffer to each sample to obtain an EAV concentration of approximately 1 ϫ 10 8 copies per ml of fecal suspension. qRT-PCR was used to screen for genogroup I (GI) and genogroup (GII) HuNoV using previously published primer-probe sets (27) . Samples were also screened for canine-specific noroviruses using a primer-probe set designed to identify six different strains of canine norovirus (CNV) ( Table 1 ) as well as canine parvovirus (CPV) and canine enteric coronavirus (CECoV) in a duplex assay as previously reported (28) . Using a 1-step qRT-PCR protocol, 2l of extracted RNA was added to 2ϫ Precision OneStep qRT-PCR MasterMix (PrimerDesign Ltd.), 6 pmol/l primers, and 3 pmol/l probe. The thermal cycle protocol, used with a ViiA7 qPCR machine (AB Applied Biosystems), was as follows: 55°C for 30 min, inactivation of reverse transcriptase at 95°C for 5 min, and then 40 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s and then annealing and elongation at 60°C for 1 min. VLP production. Virus-like particles (VLPs) of seven different HuNoV genotypes (GI.1, GI.2, GI.3, GII.3, GII.4, GII.6, and GII.12) and VLPs of three strains of CNV were produced using a previously described method (28) (29) (30) . Accession numbers for the HuNoV strains used to generate the VLPs for this study are listed in Table 2 . Recombinant baculoviruses containing human or canine norovirus VP1 protein were generated, and then VLPs were produced by infection of Hi5 insect cells. VLPs were released from the infected Hi5 cells by freeze-thawing and then clarified by removing cellular debris (6,000 ϫ g, 30 min) and baculovirus (14,000 ϫ g, 30 min). VLPs were partially purified through a 30% (wt/vol) sucrose cushion in TNC buffer (50 mM Tris HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl 2 ) containing the protease inhibitor leupeptin at 150,000 ϫ g for 2 h. The pelleted VLPs were resuspended in TNC and further purified by isopycnic centrifugation in cesium chloride (150,000 ϫ g, 18 h). The resultant VLP bands were collected by puncture, and the solution containing VLPs was dialyzed against PBS prior to quantification by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Thermo Scientific) and storage at Ϫ80°C. GI.1 and GII.4 VLPs were visualized by electron microscopy to confirm correct particle assembly (Fig. 1) , and as all VLPs in this study were made using an identical protocol and formed a defined band on a cesium chloride gradient, this was deemed sufficient to confirm VLP formation for each genotype. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure. Ninetysix-well polystyrene microtiter plates (Nunc Maxisorb; Fisher Scientific) were coated overnight at 4°C with 25 ng of each GI strain (3 strains, total of 75 ng/well) or each GII strain (4 strains, total of 100 ng/well) in 0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6). Plates were washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS-T) before blocking in 5% skim milk-PBS-T for 1 h at 37°C and then three PBS-T washes. Plates were then incubated for 3 h at 37°C with a 1:50 dilution of each serum sample in duplicate in 5% skim milk-PBS-T. Pooled human sera (Sigma-Aldrich), diluted 1:400, and 100 ng pooled GII human norovirus VLPs were used as a positive control. After three washes with PBS-T, 50 l of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-canine or anti-human IgG antibody (both from Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:5,000 or 10,000, respectively, in 5% milk-PBS-T was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The plates were washed three times with PBS-T and bound antibody detected with 50 l tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was stopped with 1 N H 2 SO 4 , and the optical density at 450 nm (OD 450 ) was read (Spectromax M2 plate reader; Molecular Devices). To eliminate the possibility that nonspecific components of the VLP preparation were identified by the canine sera, an antigenically distinct vesivirus 2117 VLP was included in the assay. The OD 450 s of serum samples incubated on either carbonate-bicarbonate buffer-coated wells or vesivirus 2117-coated wells were highly comparable, with the exception of 8% of dogs which displayed reactivity to vesivirus 2117, which was a limitation of this methodology (data not shown). It was suspected that reactivity to vesivirus 2117 could be due to cross-reactivity with the related canine calicivirus, but no correlation between seropositivity to HuNoV or seropositivity to vesivirus 2117 was shown (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Subsequently, the background signal for each sample was determined by measuring the OD 450 of serum samples incubated with carbonate-bicarbonate buffer alone. The background signal was then subtracted from the OD 450 of VLP-coated wells to generate the corrected OD 450 value. A threshold value was established as the mean of the OD 450 s of all buffer-coated cells plus 3 standard deviations. A serum sample was considered positive when the corrected OD 450 was higher than the threshold. Any serum samples showing a positive response to pooled HuNoV VLPs were subjected to further testing with individual HuNoV VLPs. Plates were coated with 25 ng of individual VLPs in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer and the protocol then repeated as described above. Evaluation of serological cross-reactivity between different norovirus strains was achieved using VLP competition assays and antibody competition assays. For the VLP competition assays, plates were first coated with 25 ng/well of VLP overnight at 4°C. Canine serum was incubated with a range of concentrations of either pooled GI or GII HuNoV VLPs or pooled CNV VLPs (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g/ml) for 1 h at 37°C. Vesivirus 2117 VLP was incubated with the canine sera as a negative control. After the incubation period, 50 l of each serum-VLP combination was added to the previously VLP-coated plates. The remainder of the ELISA protocol was followed as detailed above. The concentration of VLP required to block 50% binding (50% effective concentration [EC 50 ]) was calculated by fitting sigmoidal curves to the serial dilution data. Samples unable to block 50% of binding at the highest dilution tested were assigned an EC 50 of 2.5ϫ the assay upper limit of detection. For the antibody competition assays, polyclonal anti-norovirus VLP antibodies were generated by immunization of a rabbit (GII.4 HuNoV) or rat (CNV) as previously described (31) . Plates were coated with 25 ng/well of GII.4 VLP overnight at 4°C, and then after blocking for 1 h in 5% skim milk-PBS-T, rabbit anti-GII.4 or rat anti-CNV antibody was added to the wells serially diluted in 5% skim milk-PBS-T for 1 h. Following three washes in PBS-T, GII.4-positive canine serum was added and the remainder of the ELISA protocol followed as described above. Assays to assess VLP binding to saliva and gastrointestinal scrapings used the ELISA protocol as described above, with the addition of 100 ng HuNoV VLPs per well in 5% skim milk-PBS-T after the 1-h blocking step with 5% skim milk-PBS-T. VLPs were incubated at 37°C for 1 h with the saliva or gastrointestinal scraping samples and then detected using polyclonal anti-GI.1 (rabbit 130) or anti-GII.4 (rabbit 132) primary antibodies. Goat HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Interchim, France) was used as the secondary antibody as previously described. The saliva phenotyping assay used the ELISA protocol as detailed above, with variations as described in a previous study (23) . SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. VLPs were heated to 95°C for 5 min in the presence of SDS loading buffer and electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For Coomassie blue staining, the gels were incubated with Coomassie blue for 1 h at room temperature prior to destaining. Proteins were transferred from SDS-polyacrylamide gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Western blotting. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% milk in PBS-T and then incubated overnight at 4°C with canine serum samples diluted 1:1,000. The excess antibody was washed three times in PBS-T and incubated for 1 h with anti-canine IgG secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:10,000 in 5% milk-PBS-T. After washing away excess secondary antibody, the bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare). Tissue samples and immunohistochemical analysis. Tissue sections from the gastrointestinal tracts of six dogs were deparaffinized through baths of LMR-SOL (1-bromopropane, 2-methylpropane-2-ol, and acetonitrile), followed by rehydration with successive baths of 100, 90, 70, and 50% ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. H and A antigen detection was then performed as previously reported (23) . To assess the ability of VLPs to bind to tissue sections, after blocking, 1 g/ml VLPs was incubated with the sections overnight at room temperature. Anti-HuNoV primary antibody was then incubated with the tissue sections for 1 h at 37°C. After three washes in PBS, sections were incubated with secondary anti-rabbit biotinylated antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted in 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h. Sections were washed three times in PBS prior to addition of HRP-conjugated avidin D (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) also diluted in 1% BSA in PBS. Substrate was added to the slides (AEC kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), followed by Mayer's hematoxylin solution (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ) for contrast staining.
