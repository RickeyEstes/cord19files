Virus and host. We used the bacteriophage Phi6 (kindly provided by P. Turner of Yale University, New Haven, CT) as a surrogate for influenza virus and other enveloped viruses in these experiments (31) . The host for Phi6 was Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, and we cultivated it on tryptic soy agar (TSA). We prepared stock solutions of virus by suspending propagated Phi6 in TSB at concentrations of approximately 10 8 to 10 10 PFU · ml Ϫ1 . We stored working stocks of Phi6 at 4°C and long-term stocks at Ϫ80°C. Chamber to control RH and AH. To control humidity, we used a chamber as previously described (13) . We placed two polyethylene petri dishes filled with 10 to 20 ml of a saturated salt solution into the bottom of a glass desiccator. Saturated solutions of potassium acetate, magnesium chloride, potassium carbonate, magnesium nitrate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and potassium sulfate provided stable RH at 23%, 33%, 43%, 61%, 75%, 85%, and 98%, respectively. We also placed a battery-powered computer fan into the chamber to promote airflow and a more rapid establishment of an RH equilibrium. We regulated temperature by incubating the chamber in temperature-controlled rooms (14°C and 37°C), an incubator (25°C), or on a benchtop (19°C). To isolate the effect of temperature at a single RH of 75%, we incubated the chamber at additional temperatures of 22°C, 28°C, 31°C, 34°C, and 40°C. We selected 75% RH for this experiment for the following reasons. First, there were distinct differences in infectivity versus temperature at 75% RH (Fig. 1) . Second, 75% was near the middle of the range (60 to 85% RH) in which we saw the largest virus inactivation. Third, we were able to test a full range of temperatures at 75% RH. A sensor (HOBO Temp/RH 2.5% data logger, Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA) placed inside the chamber logged the temperature and RH. We considered an experiment valid if the temperature varied by no more than Ϯ1°C and the RH by no more than Ϯ2% during the incubation period. To determine AH, we calculated the saturation vapor pressure of water as a function of temperature (49) , converted to units of grams per cubic meter, and multiplied by RH. Before placing samples into the chamber, we allowed the chamber to reach equilibrium at the desired RH and temperature. When we briefly opened the chamber to place the samples inside, the temperature did not shift, but there was a small change in RH. However, the equilibrium was reestablished within approximately 5 to 10 min under all experimental conditions. Following every test, we washed the chamber with distilled water and ethanol to remove any salt residue. Experimental procedure. For each of three biological replicates under each experimental condition, we spotted 10 1-l droplets of Phi6 at a concentration of 10 8 to 10 10 PFU · ml Ϫ1 onto one well of a six-well, untreated, polystyrene cell culture dish (Greiner Bio-One CELLSTAR cell culture multiwell plate). We then placed the cell culture dish into the chamber, placed the lid on the chamber with a thin layer of vacuum grease to create a seal, and moved it to the appropriate location for incubation at the desired temperature. The entire process of diluting the working stock, spotting the droplets, and placing the cell culture dish into the RH chamber took place in a biological safety cabinet (BSC) at approximately 20°C. Immediately following a 2-h incubation period, we returned the chamber to the BSC and removed the cell culture dish. We added 500 l of TSB to each well containing droplets, which we resuspended via pipetting and then placed into separate cryovials for each well's solution. We placed the vials in a Ϫ20°C freezer for 20 min before moving them to a Ϫ80°C freezer for long-term storage. Prior to assaying these samples, we thawed them at room temperature before sampling and refreezing. Samples for each experimental condition included negative-control cultures containing 500 l of Phi6 stock solution. We stored these controls in polyethylene tubes and did not spot them as droplets but otherwise incubated them in the RH chamber and stored and assayed them identically to the test cultures. Determining Phi6 infectivity. We performed plaque assays to quantify infectious Phi6 in the form of PFU (PFU · ml Ϫ1 ) for stock, control, and test cultures. For the plaque assays, we first performed serial dilutions of our working stock in TSB medium. We then mixed 50 l of the diluted Phi6 with 250 l of overnight cultured P. syringae, with the coculture inoculated into 6.5 ml of TSB soft agar prewarmed to 50°C. We quickly, but fully, hand-shook the mixture and poured it onto TSA plates, which we rotated by hand to allow the top agar to form a smooth even layer on the TSA. After drying, we sealed the plates in Parafilm and incubated them at 25°C for 24 h. To determine the concentration of infectious Phi6 in a sample, we multiplied the number of observed plaques by the appropriate dilution coefficient. We calculated the relative infectious ratio after aging Phi6 droplets at a given temperature, RH, and AH as relative infectious ratio (%) ϭ N E /N C , where N E and N C are the measured Phi6 concentrations (PFU · ml Ϫ1 ) for the exposed and control samples, respectively. Droplets as a model for aerosols. To examine whether the droplets serve as a valid model for aerosols, we examined virus decay in both under the same environmental conditions. We performed the droplet experiments as described above, with the exception of aging for 1 h to mimic the aerosol experiments. We studied the effect of RH on Phi6 in aerosols using a rotating drum (50) . Briefly, a Collison nebulizer aerosolized Phi6 from a suspension in TSB into the drum at a controlled RH. We collected an unaged aerosol sample onto a gelatin filter and a sample that had been aged for 1 h onto another gelatin filter. To determine the infectivity of Phi6 in aerosols, we dissolved the filters in TSB and performed plaque assay on the samples. We corrected the results for losses in the rotating drum (50) . Statistical analysis. We determined the average Phi6 infectivity and the standard error from triplicate samples for each RH-temperature combination tested. We calculated all statistics in R version 3.4.2 (51) and JMP Pro 13. To calculate random forests, we used the randomForest package version 4.6-12 in R. The calculation was based on 50,000 trees and the default one variable used at each split, given the three explanatory variables available. We fitted virus infectivity as a function of temperature as exponential decay and calculated a coefficient of determination using Excel. We used a one-way ANOVA to test for significant differences (P Ͻ 0.05) in Phi6 infectivity between different temperatures, RH, and AH in JMP Pro 13.
