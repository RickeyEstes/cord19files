Serum samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/ MS), using compound spiked into control serum as a standard. Fecal MMV665917 was measured by homogenizing feces in PBS (0.1 g/mL) in a polypropylene tube and then further dilution prior to addition of an internal standard (enalapril) and acetonitrile protein precipitation. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and dried using a speed vac. Samples were then resuspended and analyzed using LC/MS/MS. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 6.00. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each animal using a plot of the indicated parameter vs. time and a baseline score of one (i.e. a calf with a score of one every day (no diarrhea) would have an AUC of 0). The AUC for oocyst shedding was determined from a plot of the Log 10 transformed fecal oocyst shedding per gram of fecal dry matter vs. time using a baseline of 2 (Log 10 100) and including the first day of drug dosing. p values were determined using the unpaired one-way student's t test. Graphs were labeled for Fig preparation using Adobe Illustrator CS5.
