A six-month longitudinal study was conducted in 30 Thoroughbred racehorses during the Flat season. All the horses originated from the same stud farm and were in training with the same trainer. There were three different age groups of horses; the main group, i.e., 21 (70%) horses were two years of age, five (17%) of the horses were three years old and four (13%) were four years old. The two-year-old horses were in training for their first season. All the horses had been vaccinated against EI and EHV1 prior to entering the training yard. At the request of the owner, whole blood samples were collected by the veterinary surgeon at monthly intervals from April to September. These were for routine serological screening and archiving as the "acute" samples for the testing of paired sera ("acute" and "convalescent") in the event of an outbreak of respiratory disease. Additional blood samples were collected from horses with respiratory disease in mid-May. Similarly to previous longitudinal studies of Thoroughbred racehorses in training [21] [22] [23] , sera were tested for presence of antibodies against ERAV, ERBV, EHV-1 and EHV-4 using the Complement fixation (CF) test. The test was performed as described by Thomson et al. [24] , using guinea pig complement and sensitized sheep erythrocytes. Serial twofold dilutions of sera from 1:5 to 1:640 were tested. Sera were tested for antibodies against EI H7N7 and H3N8 viruses using the Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) test. The sera were pretreated with potassium periodate, inactivated for 30 min at 56 • C (±1 • C) and tested as described previously [25] . Seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold or higher rise in CF or HI antibody titers. Sera were tested for the presence of antibodies against equine arteritis virus (EAV) by indirect ELISA (ID Screen ® Equine Viral Arteritis Indirect -Grabels, France). A Chi-squared test was used to test the association of seroconversion with subsequent failure to race. The data was summarised in 2 × 2 contingency tables and an analysis was conducted in the R statistical software package version 3.5.1. The statistical significance was set at α = 0.05.
