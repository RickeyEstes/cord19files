Cell culture. HeLa and 293T cells were obtained from ATCC. Mouse bone marrow cells and splenocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were stimulated with 1,000 U/ml human IFN-␣ (Roche) overnight. Plasmids and transfections. cDNAs for human and murine genes were obtained from GE Dharmacon (formerly Open Biosystems) and subcloned into the HA-pCGN (Addgene) or pEF1-V5-HisB (Invitrogen) expression vectors. Polyethylenimine linear transfection reagent (Polysciences, Inc.) was used at 3 g/g plasmid DNA. Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and antibodies. Cell lysates and Western blots were prepared as described previously (24) . Immunoprecipitations were carried out with 600 to 1,000 g protein with rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse ISG54 (24), rabbit polyclonal anti-HA (Santa Cruz), mouse monoclonal anti-HA (Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-V5 (Santa Cruz), mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (Sigma), and control normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Commercial secondary antibodies included horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (GE Healthcare) and anti-mouse IRDye800-conjugated antibody (Rockland). Immunohistochemistry. Kidneys from WT or IFIT2 KO mice were isolated at 72 hpi, fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, and processed by Histowiz, Inc. (Brooklyn, NY). Digital images were visualized using ImageScope software (Leica). Isolation of bone marrow cells, splenocytes, and kidney cells. Bone marrow (BM) cells were isolated by flushing tibias and femurs, and spleens were disrupted mechanically between frosted microscope slides before red blood cell lysis. Kidneys were disrupted mechanically, and resuspended fragments were treated as described with DNase and Liberase enzyme (Roche) (80) . Neutrophil, monocyte, and macrophage depletion. To deplete neutrophils, 50 g of anti-Ly6G antibody clone 1A8 (BioXCell) was injected intravenously in tail veins 24 h before infection. The efficiency of depletion was evaluated at the time of sacrifice in peripheral blood. Leukocytes were stained with anti-Gr1 antibody (BioLegend) and analyzed with flow cytometry. Depletion of monocytes and macrophages was carried out by intravenous tail vein injection with 200 l clodronate liposomes 24 h before infection. Clodronate liposomes were obtained from http://clodronateliposomes.org and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cytokine and chemokine assays. Analysis of chemokines and cytokines was carried out using LEGENDplex multianalyte flow assay kits (BioLegend). Chemokines were analyzed with mouse proinflammatory chemokine panel, and cytokines were analyzed with a BioLegend mouse inflammation panel (BioLegend) with a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). Blood cell type analysis of kidneys. Kidney cells were harvested and incubated with the following fluorophore-conjugated antibodies (BioLegend): Pacific Blue-anti-CD45, brilliant violet 650 -anti-Ly6G, APC/Cy7-anti-F4/80, and APC-anti-Ly6C. Cells were blocked with anti-mouse CD16/32 antibody at 1:50 dilution for 30 min at 4°C, resuspended, and added to antibody pellets followed by fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde. Analysis was performed using an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Phagocytosis assays. Phagocytosis of live C. albicans cells was measured with GFP-expressing C. albicans (CaGFP) cells (47) . Freshly isolated BM cells were stained with anti-CD45 antibody (BioLegend), were untreated, or were treated with 1,000 U/ml murine IFN-␤, and 3 ϫ 10 5 BM cells were incubated with 1.5 ϫ 10 6 of GFP-expressing C. albicans cells. After 20 min, phagocytosis was stopped with paraformaldehyde. Samples were analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer by calculating the percentage of CD45-positive cells that were also GFP positive. A modification of the published assay to measure phagocytosis of heat-killed C. albicans was used (81) . BM cells were left untreated or stimulated with murine IFN-␤ (1,000 U/ml). C. albicans cells were heat inactivated at 95°C for 30 min, stained with SYBR-Safe DNA stain (Thermo Fisher), and washed, and 1 ϫ 10 6 yeast cells were added to 1 ϫ 10 6 prepared BM cells. After 30 min, propidium iodide (Invitrogen) was added to quench extracellular green fluorescence. Green fluorescence in the BM cells was measured with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Measurement of reactive oxygen species. Freshly isolated BM cells were incubated in phenol red-free complete RPMI and were left untreated or were stimulated with murine IFN-␤ (1,000 U/ml) followed by staining with 20 M DCFDA (2=,7=-dichlorofluorescin diacetate; Abcam, Inc.). A total of 1 ϫ
