SARS-CoV 3CL Protease (3CL), SARS-CoV Nucleocapsid (Nc), and SARS-CoV Spike C-terminal fragment protein (Spk C) were fused with SUMO and expressed in E. coli. For expression of the proteins, SARS-CoV cDNA was derived from infected cell RNA, provided by the CDC, Atlanta, to S.R.W. (University of Pennsylvania).
