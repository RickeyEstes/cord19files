Health emergency management assessment is a process of formulating objective judgments on assessment targets based on specific criteria. Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods are most commonly used. This review found that the construction of a health emergency management evaluation system is more of a qualitative approach and is appropriately categorized as exploratory research (e.g., literature review, personal interview, Delphi, brainstorming, expert group discussion, expert meeting business law, field inspection). Some studies focus on data collection, detailing the main laws and characteristics by using descriptive methods. The health emergency management evaluation system weight analysis and application falls more in the domain of the Delphi method, while analytic hierarchy process, entropy weight, rank sum ratio, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, and matter-element extension methods are relatively new methods for health emergency assessment. The application of the health emergency management evaluation involves possibly utilizing questionnaire surveys, factor analysis, principal component analysis, comprehensive scoring, comprehensive indexes, and analytic hierarchy process methods. Recently, scholars have started to pay attention to health emergency resource allocation research using data envelopment analysis methods. Health emergency management systems are extremely complex and large, as they are concerned with numerous variables and complicated mechanisms and structures.
