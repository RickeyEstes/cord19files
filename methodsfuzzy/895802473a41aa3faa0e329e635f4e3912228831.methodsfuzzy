The present findings are broadly consistent with earlier studies examining the spread of HSV-I and MHV after inoculation into the olfactory sys-tem40~47~5'. Although both viruses can spread via the cerebrospinal fluid, the pattern of infection following intraventricular inoculation suggests that virus spread via the cerebrospinal fluid following intranasal and intrabulbar inoculations was minimal at the times pi. examined in this study. Many structures were infected on both the ipsilat-era1 and contralateral sides at early times pi., despite unilateral inoculation of virus. Infection of the anterior olfactory nuclei, which project to both the ipsilateral and contralateral MOBS,~~ was commonly bilateral for both viruses early in the infection. Virus can also spread to the contralateral side across commissural connections between the olfactory cortices. Contralateral primary olfactory cortex infection in HSV-l-infected brains was first seen in lamina 2b, from which commissural projections arise.24 MHV-JHM was detected in cells in the anterior commissure, through which these commissural projections cross. This is consistent with similar labeling in mice infected intranasally following unilateral bulbectomy.56 Intranasal inoculation in that study quickly resulted in a bilateral infection also, despite the fact that MHV-JHM entry was restricted to the side with an intact MOB. Some of the labeling in heavily infected structures was likely related to infection of glia, and both MHV-JHM and HSV-I have been shown to infect glia during CNS infections.s~'3.47.52 Consistent with this, the percentage of TH -cells in the LC infected with HSV-1 and in the A8-A10 groups infected with MHV-JHM increased as the infections intensified. Reactive gliosis, during which glia form a barrier around lysed neurons, may actually prevent the nonspecific spread of virions in the extracellular space, thereby contributing to the specificity of transneuronal movement of virus5* epithelium to the MOB and most likely from the olfactory neuroepithelial cells to mitral and periglomerular cells. Most significantly, several primary MOB connections were infected predominantly by one of the two viruses. HSV-1 produced an intense infection of both the ventral tenia tecta and the LC. Neither of these were infected by MHV-JHM, despite the projections from both structures to the MOB and piriform cortex.L6,25*65 Similarly, the pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of the hippocampus were infected almost exclusively by HSV-I, although they project directly to the MOB." These data show that despite the fact that both viruses had access to projections from the same structures, they were only infected by one of the two viruses. Although both viruses infected primary olfactory cortex, the pattern of labeling differed considerably. Laminae 2b and 3 of this cortex provide the heaviest projection of all MOB afferents.63 HSV-1 infection of this structure was consistent with retrograde movement along this pathway, as these laminae, particularly 2b, were infected early in the infection and laminae 1 and 2a were not. In contrast, the early MHV-JHM infection was seen predominantly in lamina 3. These data show that HSV-1 and MHV-JHM preferentially infect different subsets of the neurons projecting from primary olfactory cortex to the MOB. Additional primary MOB connections which were differentially infected include the posterolateral cortical amygdaloid nucleus and the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract by HSV-1, and the nucleus of the diagonal band, medial septal nucleus, ventral pallidum, anterior amygdaloid area and lateral hypothalamus by MI-IV-JHM (Fig. 9) . Secondary and tertiary olfactory connections. The restriction of the spread of HSV-1 and MHV-JHM to specific structures and pathways continued as the secondary and tertiary connections of the MOB were infected. The differential infection of these structures by the two viruses can in part be related to differences between the viruses in the infection of primary MOB connections (Fig. 9 ). In the thalamus, HSV-1 infection of the thalamus involved midline nuclei such as the reuniens nucleus. This thalamic nucleus projects to a number of structures infected more heavily by HSV-1, including the anterior olfactory nuclei, entorhinal cortex and the CA1 region of Ammon's horn.*' The subthalamic nucleus, which projects to both the ventral pallidum and the lateral hypothalamus,22*32 was infected exclusively by MHV-JHM. HSV-1 regularly infected several regions of the hippocampus, a structure infected only rarely by MHV-JHM. In addition to the previously mentioned infection of CAl, CA3 pyramidal cells and granule cells of the dentate gytus were also infected by HSV-1. The pattern of viral spread within the hippocampus was suggestive of retrograde transport. HSV-1 was detected in CA3 only in cases when the CA1 region, to which it projects,'2 was also infected. Similarly, the granule cells of the dentate gyrus were only infected following CA3 infection, consistent with retrograde spread from the CA3 region, to which it projects.4' of the MHV-JHM-infected cells were TH+ in this region. One possible explanation for this finding is that MHV-JHM infects both dopaminergic and nondopaminergic neurons in this structure, since onethird of VTA neurons are non-dopaminergic and many projections arise from both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons7' Another explanation is an increase in the infection of glial cells following virus spread from adjacent infected neurons. Whereas HSV-1 infected the LC, MHV-JHM infected the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus and the medial parabrachial nucleus. The latter two structures are continuous and together extend along the full rostralcaudal extent of the LC. The pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus projects to several structures infected exclusively or more prominently by MHV-JHM, including the VTA, subthalamic nucleus and the lateral hypothaIamus.3',60*69 The medial parabrachial nucleus projects to a number of MHV-JHM-infected structures, including insular cortex, the lateral hypothalamus and the ventroposterior parvocellular thalamus.19~so~59@' In the cortex, both viruses commonly infected laminae 2, 3 and 5 of entorhinal cortex, consistent with a projection from laminae 2 and 3 to the MOB63 and projections from the deep layers of the entorhinal cortex to primary olfactory cortex." Laminae 2, 5 and 6 of agranular insular cortex were also infected by both viruses. Cells in lamina 5 of this cortical area project to the lateral hypothalamic area, while those in all three laminae project to infralimbic cortex.' Commonly, cortical infections were first restricted to specific lamina or laminae, with eventual involvement of additional laminae. In several cortical regions viral labeling was eventually seen in every lamina, suggesting intracortical spread of virus. Combined assay for virus and TH clearly showed that HSV-1 infected noradrenergic neurons in the LC, whereas MHV-JHM did not. This finding suggests that either MHV-JHM lacks the ability to infect noradrenergic fibers arising from the LC or, alternatively, that the virus does not cross the appropriate synapses to gain access to LC terminals. Recent studies indicate that, in the rat, the noradrenergic input from the LC terminates in the internal and external plexiform layers and granule cell layer in the MOB, but not in the glomerular layer.48 The granule cells of the MOB form dendrodendritic contacts with mitral and tufted cells,62 which provide efferent fibers of the MOB. A failure of MHV-JHM to enter the granule cells via the dendrodendritic contacts with the mitral and tufted cells would prevent access to the noradrenergic input from the LC. Inability of MHV-JHM to infect LC neurons appears more likely since MHV-JHM infection of the internal granular layer of the MOB was seen following intranasal inoculation. In addition, direct MOB inoculations of MHV-JHM, which would be expected to expose LC terminals to virus, did not result in infection of this structure. Finally, the LC projects to a number of other structures infected by MHV-JHM (e.g. anterior olfactory nuclei, primary olfactory cortex, the VTA, entorhinal cortex), but was still not infected.
