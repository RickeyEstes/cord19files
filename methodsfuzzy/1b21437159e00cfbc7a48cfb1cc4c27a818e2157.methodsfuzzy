Here we used a stochastic, individual-based model which allowed us to directly measure the number of secondary infections arising from one index case under different assumptions about vector mortality. Our results confirm that formulas based on age-independent mortality rates can overestimate R 0 by nearly 100% compared to our own estimate derived from first principles. We further provide a correction factor that can be used with a standard R 0 formula and adjusts for the discrepancies due to erroneous vector age distributions. In most cases, only successful disease introductions that lead to epidemic outbreaks are observed. These outbreaks can then be used to estimate the reproduction number based on Estimating the reproductive number of vector-borne diseases the initial epidemic growth rate λ (see Methods). Formulas to calculate R 0 from λ are usually based on ODE modelling frameworks assuming constant vector death rates. To investigate the effect of this assumption on estimating a disease's basic reproduction number from epidemic growth rates, R l 0 , we used our IBM framework to generate 100 epidemic outbreaks Estimating the reproductive number of vector-borne diseases (discounting failed introductory events) under identical initial conditions for both constant and age-dependent mortality rates. As illustrated in Fig 4A, estimating the reproduction number from initial outbreak data is fairly reliable as long as the empirical age profiles of the mosquitoes match the one assumed in the model. That is, if mosquito mortality was indeed independent of age, leading to exponentially distributed age profiles, then R l 0 can provide good estimates of the real reproduction number. However, if the risk of dying does increase with age, then R l 0 , as derived form the ODE framework, is once again significantly over-inflated. Likewise, assuming age-dependent death rates when mortality is in fact constant, this could lead to an underestimation of the true reproduction number; note, however, that the latter scenario is arguably less relevant in biological terms. Noticeable in all situations is the considerable variance in R l 0 . This is due to the stochastic nature of our spatial IBM framework, which to a certain extent should also reflect the natural stochasticities underlying real vector-borne disease systems. Changing the model's spatial and demographic set-up will obviously affect the variance reported here; however, the results, related to the mean values, are to be understood as independent of the model's underlying structure. Estimating the reproductive number of vector-borne diseases As shown in Fig 4, using the initial epidemic growth rate is only appropriate when empirical vector mortality is indeed age-independent, whereas it can lead to significant over-estimations otherwise. In order to compensate for this and include age-dependent vector mortality rates into the ODE-derived formula for R l 0 , we replaced this critical term by the vector to host transmission period (VHTP), denoted by n I V , calculated directly from an assumed vector age profile (see Methods), which yields the corrected estimatê where μ V is the constant vector mortality rate in the classical system of ordinary differential equations. Crucially, a vector age profile has to be assumed explicitly to calculate the VHTP. And as before, if the assumed profile inR l 0 matches the simulations' profile, we find that the derived reproduction numbers are good estimates of the actual ones, with the same variance as before (Fig 4) .
