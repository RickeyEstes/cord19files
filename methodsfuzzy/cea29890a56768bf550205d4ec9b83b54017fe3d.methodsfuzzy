The RF for aviation CO 2 is calculated explicitly, whereas other RFs are calculated either directly or indirectly from fuel data from base-year reference data from more complex models. The approach taken to calculate aviation CO 2 RF was to first calculate the CO 2 concentrations attributable to aviation using a carbon-cycle model and then calculate its RF according to a simple function as recommended by the IPCC Third Assessment Report (Ramaswamy et al., 2001) . The non-CO 2 effects are scaled with fuel usage from reference values calculated with a suite of more complex models, but account for technological changes affecting emissions and other non-linear effects (e.g., contrails) as described below. The model as described by Lim et al. (2007) is an extended version of a simplified climate model (SCM) for CO 2 and NO x emissions effects on O 3 (Sausen and Schumann, 2000) that is also used to account for other aviation emissions and effects. The non-CO 2 effects were originally calibrated to the results from IPCC (1999) for 1992 and 2050, so that the model could be used with confidence to project forwards in time (its main purpose is to calculate temperature response, RF being an intermediate step). Having calibrated the evolution of aviation RFs over time with the IPCC (1999) results for 1992 and 2050, the model was recalibrated to a base-year of 2000 using the results of Sausen et al. (2005) , which were derived from more complex models. This scaling approach to calculate future RFs is used here in the absence of a complete and comprehensive set of RF calculations from chemical transport models, contrail coverage models and radiative transfer codes. Such a comprehensive assessment is of course preferable because of the sensitivities, for example, to regional effects and changes in climate parameters from nonaviation sources. The IPCC has accepted a similar approach (see IPCC AR4 WGI, Meehl et al., 2007) for rapid low-cost computations of future total RF and temperature response with the MAGICC model (Wigley, 2004) based on parameterizations that mimic ensemble results of more complex models (Wigley et al., 2002) . Moreover, IPCC (1999) used a similar approach to scale RFs for a range of 2050 aviation scenarios from a central set of results calculated for 2050 with more complex models. Ponater et al. (2006) used a similar approach to calculate scenarios for hypothetical future liquid hydrogen (LH 2 ) powered fleet of aircraft, as have Grewe and Stenke (2008) to project RFs from a supersonic aviation fleet. Similarly, Fuglestvedt et al. (2008) have examined contributions of the different transportation sectors to global RF and temperature response with an SCM. The CO 2 RF was calculated using a complete time-series of aviation fuel data as described above for the period 1940-2005. Emissions of CO 2 from fuel burn were used to calculate CO 2 atmospheric concentrations with the simple carbon-cycle model of Hasselmann et al. (1997) . This model is based upon that of Maier-Reimer and Hasselmann (1987) and uses a 5-coefficient impulse response function. Such convolution integral models have their limitations when compared with more complex carbon-cycle models but they are considered to work well for small linear perturbations (Caldeira et al., 2000) , such as featured in this work. Background CO 2 RFs were taken from historical data and scenario projections from the MAGICC model v4.1 (Wigley, 2004) , as published in the IPCC Third Assessment Report (IPCC, 2001) . The RF contribution of aviation CO 2 is then calculated using the CO 2 concentrations attributable to aviation using the simple function recommended by Ramaswamy et al. (2001) , which originates from Myhre et al. (1998) . The RF reference value for O 3 increases from NO x emissions is based upon a calibration with the ensemble results from more complex chemical transport models (CTMs) and climate chemistry models (CCMs) that provided input to Sausen et al. (2005) for 2000, adjusted by a factor of 1.15 to agree with IEA fuel burn (Prather et al., 1999) . The O 3 RFs are projected forward in time using values of the NO x emission index (EINO x , g NO x kg À1 fuel) from IPCC (1999) . A linear relationship between O 3 RF (or O 3 burden) with increases in aircraft NO x emissions at a global scale has been shown elsewhere to be a good approximation (e.g., IPCC, 1999 (Figure 4 -3); Grewe et al., 1999; Rogers et al., 2002; Kö hler et al., 2008;  and also for shipping NO x perturbations, Eyring et al., 2007) over the range of NO x emissions used in these studies. Similarly, the reference value for the reduction in CH 4 RF from NO x is calibrated to the results of Sausen et al. (2005) for 2000 and scaled to the changes in O 3 RF via EINO x projections. Thus far, potential non-linearities in the atmospheric chemistry of NO x -O 3 production (e.g., Jaeglé et al., 1998) have not been clearly exhibited in global models at large scales. Non-linearities have only clearly been manifested at scales smaller than the globe (e.g. Rogers et al., 2002) . Reference values for water vapour, SO 4 and soot RFs were calibrated to Sausen et al.'s (2005) values. Future values were scaled via the respective emission indices from IPCC (1999). The reference value for the persistent linear contrail RF was calibrated to the results of Sausen et al. (2005) . The RF was projected forward on the basis of fuel usage but also incorporated an additional non-linear factor that accounts for . Historical and present-day inventories, and future projections of civil aviation CO 2 emissions from a variety of sources: AERO2K ; ANCAT/EC2 (Gardner et al., 1998) ; CONSAVE (Berghof et al., 2005) ; FAST (Owen and Lee, 2006) ; IPCC (IPCC, 1999); NASA (Baughcum et al., 1996 (Baughcum et al., , 1998 Sutkus et al., 2001) ; SAGE (Kim et al., 2007) . The open symbols indicate inventory analysis and the closed symbols indicate projections. Also shown are the CO 2 emissions implied by IEA fuel sales statistics (IEA, 2007) . The IEA data represent the total of civil and military usage because all kerosene sales are included. The Sausen and Schumann (2000) data are also based on IEA. The solid (dashed) lines for FAST-A1 (B2) scenarios (evaluated with the t1 technology option) and the IPCC Fa1 scenario also account for all fuel sales in order to be consistent with the IEA values ending in 2005. In the figure legend, the FAST, CONSAVE, and IPCC symbols are shown in an order that matches the scenario labels in the parentheses in each case. The IPCC Fa1 data for 1995-2006, the IEA data and the Sausen and Schumann (2000) data are also shown in Fig projected changes in propulsive efficiency (see Sausen et al., 1998) , and flight route development as described by IPCC (1999) . Scaling with fuel usage likely produces an upper limit value because of the requirement of certain meteorological conditions (ice-supersaturation) and saturation effects (discussed below). The reference value for AIC RF was calibrated against the results of Stordal et al. (2005) for 2000 traffic. Projecting AIC RF forwards in time is problematic as it is unlikely that the AIC RF scales directly with fuel usage. A better physical basis for scaling both persistent linear contrails and AIC would be to use reported aircraft traffic movements (Gierens et al., 1999) and precise climatology for atmospheric conditions. For linear contrails, however, changes in the overall propulsive efficiency of the aircraft fleet needs to be accounted for in future cases (Gierens et al., 1999) , for which a movements-based model (rather than fuel-based) has not currently been established. The potential AIC increase with traffic is likely to be non-linear, since a given grid cell or area of interest may saturate with AIC with additional traffic producing no extra AIC. Currently, there are no adequate physical model estimates of how various aircraft and external factors will influence future AIC. In the absence of such models, AIC is scaled with fuel usage following the approach of IPCC (1999), noting that this may produce an upper estimate of future AIC.
