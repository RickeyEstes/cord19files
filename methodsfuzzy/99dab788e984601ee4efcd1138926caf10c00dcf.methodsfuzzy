The three-interaction-site (TIS) model We employed a variant of the three-interaction-site (TIS) model, a coarse-grained model first introduced by Hyeon and Thirumalai for simulating nucleic acids [34] . The TIS model has been previously used to make several quantitative predictions for RNA molecules, ranging from hairpins to ribozymes with particular focus on folding and response to f [34, 38, [47] [48] [49] . More recently, we have incorporated the consequences of counter ion condensation into the TIS model, allowing us to predict thermodynamic properties of RNA hairpins and PK that are in remarkable agreement with experiments [37] . In the TIS model, each nucleotide is represented by three coarse-grained spherical beads corresponding to phosphate (P), ribose sugar (S), and a base (B). Briefly, the effective potential energy (for details, see Ref. [37] ) of a given RNA conformation is U TIS = U L + U EV + U ST + U HB +U EL , where U L accounts for chain connectivity and angular rotation of the polynucleic acids, U EV accounts for excluded volume interactions of each chemical group, and U ST and U HB are the base-stacking and HB interactions, respectively. Finally, the term U EL corresponds to electrostatic interactions between phosphate groups. The determination of the parameters for use in simulations of the coarse-grained model of RNA was described in detail in a previous publication [37] . Briefly, we determined the stacking interactions by a learning procedure, which amounts to reproducing the measured melting temperature of dimers. We showed that a single choice of model parameters (stacking interactions, the Debye-Hückel potential for electrostatic interactions, and structure-specific choice for hydrogen bonds) is sufficient to obtain detailed agreements with available experimental data for three different RNA molecules. Thus, the parameters are transferable and we use them verbatim in the present simulations. The determination of hydrogen bond interaction is predicated on the structure. Most of these are taken from the A-form RNA structure and hence can be readily used for any RNA molecule. Only the interaction lengths and angles in hydrogen-bonding interaction of noncanonical base pairs are based on the specific PDB structure, which in our case is the BWYV pseudoknot in this study. We list all the BYWV-PKspecific values used in our simulations in Table S1 . The repulsive electrostatic interactions between the phosphate groups is taken into account through the Debye-Hückel theory, where the Debye length is λ D = ε(T )kBT 4πe 2 I . In the simulations, salt concentration can be varied by changing the ionic strength I = Σq 2 n ρ n , where q n is the charge of ion of type n, and ρ n is its number density. Following our earlier study [37] , we use an experimentally fitted function for the temperature-dependent dielectric constant ε(T ) [50] . The renormalized charge on the phosphate group is −q * e (q * < 1). Because of the highly charged nature of the polyanion, counterions condense onto the RNA, thus effectively reducing the effective charge per phosphate. The extent of charge reduction can be calculated using the Oosawa-Manning theory. Charge renormalization, first used in the context of RNA folding by Heilman-Miller et al. [51] and more recently incorporated into CG models for RNA by us [37] and others [52, 53] , is needed to predict accurately the thermodynamics and kinetics of RNA folding [54] . The renormalized value of the charge on the P group is approximately .

The mean distance (b) between charges on RNA is difficult to estimate (except for rod-like polyelectrolytes) because of its shape fluctuations. Therefore, it should be treated as an adjustable parameter. In our previous study, we showed that b = 4.4Å provides an excellent fit of the thermodynamics of RNA hairpins and the MMTV pseudoknot [37] . We use the same value in the present study of BWYV as well. Thus, the force field used in this study is the same as in our previous study attesting to its transferability for simulating small RNA molecules. The native structure of the BWYV PK is taken from the PDB (437D) [32] . The structure contains 28 nucleotides. We added an additional guanosine monophosphate to both the 5 and 3 terminus. Thus, the simulated PK has 30 nucleotides. The mechanical force is applied to the ribose sugars of both the 5 -and 3 -terminus (Fig. 1A) .
