Methodological quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) criterion [26] , which provides a standardized approach to grade the quality of studies included in meta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy. QUADAS-2 categorizes the risk of bias and study generalizability as low, unclear or high. Both reviewers (MC and NS) scored the 7-item tool independently and disagreements were resolved via consensus (between MC, NS and WC); i.e., a face-to-face discussion about each disagreement. The primary objective was to estimate pooled measurements of diagnostic accuracy: pooled sensitivity and specificity using the Mantel-Haenszel method [27] , and pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR) using the DerSimonian-Laird method [28] . We also calculated an overall area under the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q-statistic and the inconsistency (I 2 ) test [29] . An I 2 > 20% was considered as indicative of significant variation [29] . Subgroup sensitivity analyses were also conducted to determine the robustness of findings. We used Meta-DiSc 1.4 [30] and R (www.r-project.org) for statistical analyses. The overall quality of studies included in this metaanalysis was high ( Table 2) . All studies enrolled patients who probably would have received a CXR or chest CT scan in common clinical practice; described their selection criteria with sufficient detail; and, conducted LUS in Area examined is referred to each hemithorax. Two zones anterior (A): superior and inferior; two lateral (L), and one or two posterior (P). a short period before or after chest imaging. Moreover, all studies assessed tests independently and blinded from standard imaging results, and LUS technique were described with sufficient detail. LUS sonographers were not blinded to clinical data. Five studies (50%) used a combination of clinical criteria and imaging as the reference standard (Table 3 ) [21, 22, 31, 34, 36] . Five studies used imaging only as the reference standard: three studies (30%) used chest CT scan for the diagnosis pneumonia in the entire sample [32, 33, 38] and two (20%) studies used chest CT scan when the results of CXR and LUS were found to be discordant [35, 37] . While all studies (100%) obtained a chest CT scan at some point for the diagnosis of pneumonia, only three had it for the entire sample [32, 33, 38] . Three studies (30%) used chest CT scan as the gold standard in cases for which LUS and CXR findings were discordant [22, 31, 35] and four (40%) performed chest CT scan when clinically indicated [21, 34, 36, 37] . Four studies (40%) explained reasons for study withdrawal [22, 34, 36, 37] and only one study (10%) reported non-interpretable results [35] . Nine studies (90%) used a 3.5-5 MHz micro convex transducer [21, 22, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] and one (10%) used a 5-9 MHz convex probe [38] . Four studies (33%) provided information regarding time to perform LUS [21, 33, 36, 37] ( Table 4 ). There was no consensus on how to conduct LUS examination across studies: we found substantial heterogeneity on LUS approach and only five studies (50%) examined at least 12 regions of the chest (Table 4 ). Four studies [21, 32, 36, 37] reported the length of time to conduct LUS. The maximum reported time was 13 minutes.
