Several limitations of this study should be considered. First of all, the results may only apply to the current situation of the hotel industry in Hong Kong due to the unique blend of local east and west cultures. Second, the results may not represent the whole sample population, as convenient sampling and a relatively small sample size were employed. Third, the data collection period fell during the high season of the hotel industry as well as the busiest time of the year, and respondents bias should be accounted for.
