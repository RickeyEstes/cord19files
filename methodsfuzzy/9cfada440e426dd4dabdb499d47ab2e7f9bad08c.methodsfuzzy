Cells, viruses, and antibodies. HuH-7 cells (Bartenschlager lab, Heidelberg University) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Lonza) supplemented with 8% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum (FCS; Bodinco), 2 mM L-glutamine (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria), and nonessential amino acids (PAA Laboratories). 293T cells (Virgin lab, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis) and wild-type C57BL/6 MEFs (Chen lab; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) were cultured in DMEM with 10% (vol/vol) FCS. All cell culture media contained 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. EAV (Bucyrus strain) and recombinant EAV-GFP were grown on BHK-21 cells as described previously (33) . Infections were carried out at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 unless otherwise indicated and incubated at 37°C. Innate immune stimulation was performed by addition of human interferon-␤ (IFN-␤; PBL) at a concentration of 500 U/ml unless otherwise indicated. 25HC (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol before use at the indicated concentrations. Cell viability assays were performed using Cell-Titer 96 AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GFP and cell viability assays were analyzed using a Mithras LB940 (Berthold) in 96-well plates. The primary antibodies used were mouse anti-HA (clone HA.C5; Abcam, Inc.), mouse anti-␤-actin (clone AC-74; Sigma), mouse anti-viperin (clone MaP.VIP; Millipore), and goat anti-PLSCR1 (clone N-17; Santa Cruz). The mouse anti-ISG15 antibody was kindly provided by Ernest Borden (Cleveland Clinic). Antibodies recognizing EAV proteins were described previously: rabbit anti-EAV-nsp2 (49) and mouse anti-EAV-N (50). Plasmid construction. Expression constructs that contain sequences that code for EAV nsp2 and nsp3 were assembled in pDONR201 (Life Technologies, Inc.) with an HA tag at the N terminus of nsp2 and enhanced GFP (eGFP) fused to the C terminus of nsp3. The pDONR construct was then transferred using LR Clonase II (Life Technologies, Inc.) to either pcDNA3.1-DEST or pLenti6.3/TO/V5-DEST (Life Technologies, Inc.). Helper plasmids for lentivirus particle production have been described previously (51) , and pLenti3.3/TR carrying the tetR gene was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (34) . To make CRISPR/Cas9 knockout cell lines, the LentiCrisprv2 vector was used as previously described (52, 53) . Guide RNA sequences are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material (54) . Production of lentivirus particles and creation of stable cell lines. 293T cells were transiently transfected with the helper plasmids and either the pLenti3.3/TR vector, the pLenti6.3 expression constructs, or pLenti-Crisprv2 using polyethyleneimine (PEI; Sigma). Seventy-two hours after transfection, the supernatant was harvested, spun down for 10 min at 2,000 rpm, filtered through a 0.45-m-pore filter, and stored at Ϫ80°C until use. Subconfluent HuH-7 cells were transduced with pLenti3.3/TR lentiviral particles in the presence of 8 g/ml Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich), and after 48 h, cells were passaged, and transduced cells were selected with 100 g/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After several passages, the resulting cell line, named HuH-7/tetR, was transduced again with pLenti6.3 constructs containing the nsp2-3GFP (pLenti6.3/HA-nsp2-3GFP) coding sequence, and cells were selected with 12.5 g/ml blasticidin S (PAA Laboratories). Expression of transgenes was induced by the addition of 1 g/ml tetracycline (Life Technologies, Inc.) to the culture media for 24 h. The resulting cell line, HuH-7/tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP, was transduced with lentivirus particles made with the pLentiCrisprv2 vector with guide RNAs targeting viperin or PLSCR1. All lentivirus-transduced cells were maintained as polyclonal cell pools to avoid clonal differences between control cell lines and knockouts after serial transductions and selections, which could potentially delude the results. Cells were passaged at least 10 times before use in experiments to avoid lingering innate immune responses due to lentiviral transduction. Western blotting. Samples were lysed directly in 2ϫ Laemmli sample buffer ( , 20 mM dithiothreitol, 0.02 mg/ml bromophenol blue) and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Amersham) using a Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad) and blocked with 5% (wt/vol) Elk milk powder (Campina) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20. After incubation with specific antibodies, signal was visualized using ECL Plus Western blotting substrate (Thermo-Fisher). Immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were grown on coverslips and fixed after 24 h of tetracycline and/or IFN-␤ treatment, or 12 h postinfection (hpi) with 3% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. After permeabilization in 0.2% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, coverslips were incubated with antibodies diluted in 5% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA). Nuclei were visualized using 1 g/ml Hoechst 33258, and samples were embedded using ProLong Gold (Life Technologies, Inc.). Samples were visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy with a Leica TCS SP8 microscope, which was equipped with a 63ϫ objective (NA, 1.40; 1 Airy unit) and a Leica HyD hybrid detector. Flow cytometry. Cells were harvested using trypsin after 24 h of tetracycline and/or IFN-␤ treatment and fixed in suspension in 3% (wt/vol) PFA in PBS. Cells were then washed with PBS and stored in PBS with 1% (wt/vol) BSA until analysis. Intracellular GFP levels were measured on a BD FACSCalibur, and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo Enterprise). Reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR. RNA was isolated from cells using the NucleoSpin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) and converted into cDNA using the RevertAid first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo) using oligo(dT) 18 primers. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed using iQ SYBR green SuperMix (Bio-Rad) and a CFX384 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Gene-specific primers were used to amplify interferon-stimulated genes as well as genes coding for ␤-actin and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) as reference genes (Table S1) . Electron microscopy. To compare in detail the DMSs induced in the HuH-7/tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP cell line with those present in EAV-infected HuH-7 cells, high-pressure frozen and freeze-substituted samples of both conditions were prepared and analyzed by electron tomography as described previously (23) . All of the samples used for quantifications in this study were fixed in 1.5% (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde in 0.10 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed with 0.14 M cacodylate buffer, samples were postfixed and stained with 1% (wt/vol) osmium tetroxide in 0.10 M cacodylate buffer for 1 h at 4°C. Following subsequent washing with 0.14 M cacodylate buffer and Milli-Q water, cells were scraped and spun down in heated 3% (wt/vol) agar in PBS. After solidification, cell pellets were excised and cut into small blocks, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, and embedded in an epoxy resin (LX-112; Ladd Research). After polymerization, 100-nm sections were cut from the blocks and placed on mesh-100 electron microscopy grids, poststained with 7% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate, and analyzed using an FEI Tecnai 12 BioTwin equipped with an Eagle cooled slow-scan charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (FEI). Mosaic maps were generated as previously described (35) at 6,800ϫ magnification and binning 2, which corresponded to a pixel size of 3.2 nm. Quantification and statistical analysis. Mosaic maps of several meshes (approximately 170 by 170 m per mesh) of an EM grid were analyzed for each sample. Cell profiles that were positive for arterivirusassociated DMSs, cell profiles positive for double-membrane sheets, as well as cell profiles that contained a nucleus were annotated and counted using Aperio ImageScope software (Leica). Data from 3 to 4 meshes were combined and compared to those from parallel control samples. Data sets from individual experiments (e.g., control and IFN-␤ treated) were randomized prior to manual annotation to avoid detection bias. Statistical analysis of individual experiments was performed either using a chisquare test (1 degree of freedom) comparing the ratios in different conditions of cell profiles positive for DMS (DMS ϩ ) over the total number of cell profiles containing a nucleus or the fraction of cell profiles containing double-membrane sheets out of all DMS ϩ cell profiles. Statistical analysis of replicate experiments was performed with an unpaired Student's t test. Data availability. One mosaic map of each condition used in this study is available at the DANS data repository as an example (http:// dx.doi.org/10.17026/dans-zku-4cgy).
