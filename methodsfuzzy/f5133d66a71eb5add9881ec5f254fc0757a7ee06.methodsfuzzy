Our proposed method estimates the real-time daily new number of cases and the daily cumulative number of dengue cases; specifically, these numbers of dengue cases are updated daily. Let c be the "current" date when the number of dengue cases is to be estimated. In this study, the date c runs from May 1, 2006 to April 30, 2007. For the i th reported suspect case counting from the 1 st day of the epidemic season, that is May 1 in this study, we define the suspect case's onset date as O i and the laboratory confirmation date as D i If D i >c on date c, the case i does not have a confirmation result as of date c; on the other hand, if D i ≤ c, this case i is either confirmed to be a positive dengue case or has a negative result as of date c. Let the final confirmation status for the i th suspect case be, where as a positive dengue case, and as a negative case. In the situation where there are unconfirmed suspect cases as of date c, we assigned a probability of being a dengue case, P(i), to those unconfirmed cases (D ≤ c). Then for each suspect case i, the expected final confirmation status on date c, E i (c), can be written as The values of P i (c), and E i (c)are updated for each case i every day. Without applying the proposed method, one would be only able to observe the case status from the upper part of E i (c)in equation (1) . After E i (c)is calculated for each suspect case, daily new cases are easily estimated by summing the E i (c)over all new suspect cases on date c, and cumulative cases can be obtained by summing E i (c)over all cases from i = 1 to the newest suspect cases on date c. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we estimated the daily new cases and daily cumulative cases for each calendar date c from May 1, 2006 to April 30, 2007. Four epidemic curves are presented. There are: (1) The final status curve, which is the number of dengue cases based on their final confirmation status ("Real data", "gold standard"). (2) The daily confirmed curve, which is the number of dengue cases based on the confirmed cases as of date c. (3) The gamma-model curve, which is the number of dengue cases, estimated using the gamma distribution. (4) The nonparametric-model curve, which is the number of dengue cases, estimated using the nonparametric distribution. To summarize the magnitude of the bias, we defined the absolute relative bias (ARB) at date c as: where are the cumulative cases estimated by the proposed methods or by the confirmed cases observed on date c without using the proposed methods, N c and are the cumulative confirmed cases based on the final status ("real data", "gold standard"). An ARB closer to zero is a more accurate estimate. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.1.3 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Special SAS macros for estimating the cumulative cases and daily new cases, based on our proposed model, were developed. Figure 2 compares the daily new cases estimated by the proposed models, the confirmed curve (confirmed new cases observed on date c without using the proposed models), and the final status curve (confirmed new cases based on final status; the "gold standard"). Since the daily new cases estimated by the proposed methods or the daily new cases observed on date c were different when viewed on different dates, arbitrary view dates of August 1, 2006 (beginning of the epidemic), September 1, 2006 (rising stage, before the peak), October 1, 2006 (rising stage, before but closer the peak) and November 1, 2006 (around the peak), December 1, 2006 (downward stage, after the peak), and January 1, 2007 (end of the epidemic) were chosen to illustrate the results of the estimated daily new cases. Each graph in Figure 2 shows the epidemic curves three weeks before the view dates. When viewed on August 1, most of suspect cases had been lab-confirmed before July 15 thus all four curves were close to each others before that date. From July 19 to August 1, the estimated curves by the proposed methods (red dashed lines with triangle symbols by gamma distribution and blue dashed lines with cross symbols by the nonparametric method) were much closer to the final status curve (shaded area) than that by simply observing the dailyconfirmed new cases (purple dashed line). Similar patterns were observed when the results are viewed on September 1, October 1, November 1, and December 1. The observed daily-confirmed cases usually underestimated the true daily new cases as would be expected, especially within the two weeks before the view date. The curves estimated by gamma distribution or the nonparametric approach were quite similar. However, the daily new cases, as estimated by the proposed method, did not give an accurate estimate towards the end stage of the epidemic, namely when viewed on January 1, 2007.
