In situ hybridization. Brain tissues were harvested from na√Øve mice, and differential RNA expression was visualized by the QuantiGene View RNA in situ hybridization tissue assay (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were permeabilized, gene-specific probes (Ifi27, Irg1, Stat1, Ubc (positive control), and E.Coli Dapb (negative control)) were hybridized, and the signal was amplified by sequential hybridization of amplifier (branched DNA). Target mRNAs were visualized by confocal microscopy after addition of the Fast Red substrate.
