Building a computer-based system involves collecting, analyzing, structuring, validating, and interpreting information decision-makers when dealing with a particular problem (Liebowitz, 1998; Witlox, 2005) . Generally, different tasks are fulfilled by different systems. ANP of measurement concerned with deriving the dominance priorities from paired comparisons of homogeneous elements with respect to a common criterion or attribute (Saaty, 1980 (Saaty, , 1994 . The ANP, which was first developed by Saaty (1980) helps establish decision models for a process containing both qualitative and quantitative components. Qualitatively, ANP decomposes a decision problem from the top overall goal to a set of manageable clusters and sub-clusters, down to the bottom level, which typically contains scenarios or alternatives. The clusters and sub-clusters can be forces, attributes, criteria, activities, or objectives. Quantitatively, ANP uses pair-wise comparisons to assign weights to elements at the cluster and sub-cluster levels, and finally calculates ''global" weights for assessments at the bottom level. Each pair-wise comparison measures the relative importance or strength of elements within a cluster level using a ratio scale. One of the primary functions of the AHP is to calculate a consistency ratio to determine whether the matrices are appropriate for analysis (Saaty, 1980) . However, AHP models assume that uni-directional relationships exist between elements at different decision levels in a hierarchy and uncorrelated elements within each cluster, as well as between clusters. Models that specify interdependent relationships in the AHP are inappropriate. The ANP is then developed to fill this overcome this shortcoming. The ANP is also known as the systems-with-feedback approach (Meade & Sarkis, 1998) . By incorporating interdependencies (i.e., addition of feedback loops in the model), a super-matrix is created. The super-matrix adjusts the relative weights of individual matrices to form a new overall matrix with eigenvectors of the adjusted relative weights (Meade & Sarkis, 1998) . Notably, ANP utilizes a network without needing to specify levels as in a hierarchy. The primary reason for choosing the ANP as the methodology for selecting resort type operations is due to its suitability in offering solutions in a complex multi-criteria decision environment. Fig. 2 presents the structural difference between a hierarchy and network. The elements in a node can influence some or all elements in any other node. A network can have source nodes, intermediate nodes and sink nodes. Relationships in a network are represented by arcs, and the directions of arcs indicate dependence (Saaty, 2001) . Interdependency between two nodes, called outer dependence, is represented by a two-way arrow, and inner dependencies among elements in a node are represented by a looped arc (Sarkis, 2003) . The procedure in the ANP has four principal steps (Meade & Sarkis, 1999; Saaty, 2001) . Step 1: Model construction and problem structuring. The problem must be stated clearly and decomposed into a rational system, such as a network. The structure can be generated based on decision-maker opinions generated through, say, brainstorming or other methods. Fig. 2b presents an example of a network format. Step 2: Pair-wise comparison matrices and priority vectors. In the ANP, like the AHP, decision elements for each component are compared pair-wise with respect to their importance in terms of their control criterion, and the components are also compared pair-wise with respect to their contribution to a goal. Decision-makers are asked to respond to a series of pair-wise comparisons in which two elements or two components are compared base don how they contribute to their particular upper level criterion (Meade & Sarkis, 1999) . Additionally, when interdependencies exist among elements in a component, pair-wise comparisons must also be performed, and an eigenvector can be derived for each element that indicates the affects of other elements on that element. The relative importance values are determined on a scale of 1-9, where a score of 1 represents equal importance between two elements and a score of 9 indicates extreme importance of one element (row component in the matrix) compared to another element (column component in the matrix) (Meade & Sarkis, 1999) . A reciprocal value is assigned to the inverse comparison; that is, a ij = 1/a ji ; where (a ij ) is the importance of the ith (jth) element compared to the jth (ith) element. Like the AHP, pair-wise comparisons in the ANP are in the framework of a matrix, and a local priority vector can be derived as an estimate of relative importance associated with elements (or components) being compared by solving the following formula: where A is the matrix of a pair-wise comparison, w is the eigenvector, and k max is the largest eigenvalue of A. Saaty (1980) developed several algorithms for approximating w. In this study, the following three-step procedure is utilized to synthesize priorities (Meade & Presley, 2002) . (a) Sum the values in each column in the pair-wise comparison matrix. (b) Divide each element in a column by the sum of its respective column. The resulting matrix is then called the normalized pair-wise comparison matrix. (c) Sum the elements in each row of the normalized pair-wise comparison matrix, and divide the sum by the n elements in the row. These final values provide an estimate of relative priorities for compared elements with respect to the upper level criterion. Priority vectors must be derived for all comparison matrices. Step 3: Supermatrix formation. The supermatrix concept is similar to the Markov chain process (Saaty, 2001) . To acquire global priorities in a system with interdependent influences, local priority vectors are entered in the appropriate columns of a matrix, which is known as a supermatrix. Consequently, a super-matrix is actually a partitioned matrix, in which each matrix segment represents a relationship between two nodes (components or clusters) in a system (Meade & Sarkis, 1999) . Let the components of a decision system be C k , k = 1,2,. . ., N, which has n k elements denoted as e k1; e k2; . . . ; e kn k . The local priority vectors obtained in Step 2 are grouped and allocated to the appropriate positions in a super-matrix according to the flow of influence from one component to another, or from a component to itself as in a loop. A standard form of a super-matrix is as in the following equation (Saaty, 2001) .  As an example, a supermatrix representation in a hierarchy with three levels (Fig. 2a) is as follows (Saaty, 2001) : where W 21 is a vector representing the impact of the goal on the criteria, W 32 is a matrix representing the impact of criteria on each alternatives, I is an identity matrix, and zeros correspond to elements that have no impact. For this example, when criteria are interrelated the hierarchy is replaced by a network Fig. 2b . The (2, 2) entry of W n given by W 22 indicates interdependency, and the supermatrix would be (Saaty, 2001 ) Notably, any zero in the supermatrix can be replaced by a matrix when an interrelationship exists between elements in a component or between two components. As an interdependence typically exists among clusters in a network, the sum of columns in a supermatrix usually is typically greater than >1. The supermatrix must first be transformed to make it stochastic, in other words, each column in a matrix sums to unity. In other words, the row components with nonzero entries for the blocks in a given column block are compared according to their impact on the component of that column block (Saaty, 2001 ). An eigenvector can be obtained for a pair-wise comparison matrix of the row components with respect to the column component. This process yields an eigenvector for each column block. The first entry of the respective eigenvector for each column block is multiplied by all elements in the first block of that column, the second entry is multiplied by all elements in the second block of that column -this process continues. In this manner, the block in each column of the supermatrix is weighted the result is known as a weighted supermatrix, which is stochastic. Raising a matrix to powers generates the long-term relative influences each elements has on each other element. To attain a convergence on importance weights, the weighted supermatrix is raised to the power of 2k + 1, where k is an arbitrarily large number. This new matrix is called a limit supermatrix (Saaty, 2001) . A limit supermatrix has the same form as a weighted supermatrix, however, all the columns in the limit supermatrix are the same. By normalizing each block of this supermatrix, the final priorities of all elements in the matrix can be derived. Step 4: Selection of best alternatives. When the supermatrix formed in Step 3 covers the entire network, the priority weights of alternatives are found in the column of alternatives in the normalized supermatrix. Conversely, when a supermatrix only has interrelated components, additional calculations must be performed to acquire the final priorities of alternatives. The alternative with the largest overall priority should be selected. In this study, the ANP is applied, and a supermatrix covering the entire network bracket in Fig. 3 . As the proposed ANP is a multi-attribute, decisionmaking approach based on reasoning, knowledge and experience of experts the ANP is a valuable aid for decision-making involving both tangible and intangible attributes associated with the model under study. The ANP relies on the process of eliciting managerial inputs, thereby allowing for structured communication among decisionmakers. Thus, the ANP can act as a qualitative tool for strategic decision-making problems. Eddie, Cheng, and Ling (2005) applied the ANP to select the best site for a shopping mall. Wu and Lee (2007) developed an effective method based on the ANP to help companies that must assess and select knowledge management strategies. Lin, Chiu, and Tsai (2008) utilized the ANP approach to construct a dispatching model based on the characteristics of all on-site production facilities and examine the relationships among various performance indicators and the correlations between performance indicators and dispatching rules. These studies demonstrate the appropriateness of using the ANP for strategic facility resort type. Although the ANP produces a comprehensive analytic framework for solving societal, governmental, and corporate decision problems few studies have applied the ANP for selecting the location of an international resort park type. This study uses the ANP for selecting the best resort type for an international resort park in Taiwan.
