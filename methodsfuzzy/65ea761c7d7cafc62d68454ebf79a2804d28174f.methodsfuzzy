The WHO definition of SARS cases, although useful for epidemiologic purposes, was found to be insufficiently sensitive for assessing patients in ED triage areas. Consequently, physicians had to develop clinical prediction rules that could more accurately identify patients with SARS during an acute outbreak [104] [105] [106] [107] . One group from Taiwan derived a simple SARS decision rule that relied on combinations of symptoms and laboratory findings. The scores were reported to have greater than 90% sensitivity and were found to be highly reliable when validated in a separate cohort [105, 107] . A more recent study from Hong Kong, which included nearly one third of the SARS cases from 2003, reported similar results with key variables including exposure history, symptoms, and laboratory values [104] . Although determination of which prediction rule will be most effective is not known, these studies provide compelling support for integration of ED-based decision guidelines in future respiratory outbreaks. Potential gains include early identification and isolation of high-risk patients, reduction of disease transmission in the ED, and optimization of use of limited resources. Principal limitations of these decision tools include lack of proven reliability in nonendemic areas and the need for validation with each new outbreak, based on potential strain and geographic variation that may alter clinical presentation.
