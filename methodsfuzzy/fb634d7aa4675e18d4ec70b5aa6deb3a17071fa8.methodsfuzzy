We conducted a cross-sectional study of inpatient nurses in a 1,600-bed adult tertiary hospital in Singapore, from October-November 2012, prior to the hospital's annual seasonal influenza vaccination program, which provides vaccination free-of-charge to HCWs via a mobile clinic. We developed a 41-item (5-point Likert scale), self-administered questionnaire covering content on personal knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward influenza vaccination, and the barriers and facilitators of vaccination in the hospital. We also collected data on sociodemographics, vaccination uptake in the last influenza season, and intention for future influenza vaccination. Ethical approval was obtained from the Domain Specific Research Board, National Healthcare Group (Singapore). Principal component analysis with varimax rotation was performed to derive the latent factor structure. Internal consistency of each factor was measured using Cronbach α coefficient. The χ 2 test was used to compare differences in proportions. Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to assess for independent factors.
