Viruses and Cells. The highly eggadapted Beaudette strain of IBV was used throughout. Preparation of egg-grown stocks of IBV has been previously described (Schochetman et aZ., 1977) and in some cases eggs were incubated for only 16-18 hr. Working stocks of influenza A virus (WSN strain) were prepared by allantoic infection of lo-day-old white leghorn embryonated chicken eggs. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, Indiana strain) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) were grown in BHK-21 cells for 16 hr at 37" using reinforced MEM (RMEM) medium (Bablanian et al., 1965) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) and 10% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB). BHK-21 (clone 13) cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were grown as subconfluent monolayer-s in RMEM with 10% FCS in 60-mm petri dish cultures for use in plaque assays or viral growth experiments as described below. Lines of cr-amanitin-sensitive (CHO-S) and resistant (CHO-R) Chinese hamster ovary cells that were originally isolated in the laboratory of Dr. Lou Siminovitch (Chan et al., 1972) were provided by Dr. Purnell Choppin. These lines were maintained in RMEM containing 10% FCS and supplementary proline (11.5 pg/ml). MDCK cells, used for plaque assay of WSN influenza virus, were originally obtained from Dr. Robert Krug and maintained in RMEM containing 10% FCS. Plaque assays and egg infectivity titrations. We ("Abstr. 4th Int. Congr. Virol.," No. 34, p. 450, 1973) have recently demonstrated that the Beaudette strain of IBV but not other strains grows productively and produces plaques in BHK-21 cells despite an earlier report that these cells are nonpermissive for this avian coronavirus (Yamada et al., 1971) . Otsuki et al., (1979) also have found BHK-21 cells to support IBV-Beaudette replication. For plaque assays, 0.2 ml aliquots of lo-fold virus dilutions made in balanced salt solution (BSS) containing 1% gelatin (GBSS) (Schochetman et al., 1977) were inoculated into subconfluent monolayer cultures of BHK-21 cells. Virus adsorption was carried out for 60 min at room temperature. Each plate received 5-ml aliquots of Eagle's MEM containing 2% FCS, 4% TPB, and 0.6% agarose (Seakem, Rockland, Maine). Certain lots of fetal calf serum were found to contain factors inhibitory for IBV plaque production making it necessary to screen serum from commercial sources for its suitability. Plates were incubated for 4 days at 35" in a humidified atmosphere of 8% CO,/air. Titrations of WSN virus were performed in MDCK monolayer cultures incubated for 3 days at 37" and serum was omitted from the overlay. Plaques were visualized by subsequent addition of MEM overlay containing neutral red at a fmal concentration of 0.003%. Egg infectivity titrations were performed as previously described (Schochetman et al., 1977) . Infection of enucleated cells. The technique for enucleation of cells was fashioned after the method of Carter (1967) and modified according to our specific needs. Subconfluent sheets of BHK-21 cells established on the walls of glass Corex tubes (17 x 100 mm) were washed free of growth medium with BSS. Prewarmed (37") aliquots of RMEM containing 10 pg/ml of cytochalasin B were added to tubes which were immediately centrifuged in a prewarmed (37") rotor at 9500 g at 37" for 30 min. After centrifugation, the drug-containing medium was replaced with regular RMEM containing 10% FCS and the cultures were held at room temperature until the cells regained an approximate normal morphology in about 30 min. Control cultures were treated similarly except that they were either not centrifuged after drug treatment or they were centrifuged without subsequent drug treatment. The degree of enucleation was estimated by staining drugtreated cultures with hematoxylin and eosin and counting the number of nucleated cells among a total of about 300 cells. The number of cells per culture was estimated by counting trypsin-dispersed cells with the aid of a hemocytometer. Treated and untreated BHK-21 cultures were infected with IBV at an input multiplicity of about 60 egg infectious units (EIU) per cell. After adsorption of virus for 30 min at 35", the cells were washed twice with BSS before addition of RMEM containing 2% FCS and 4% TPB. Cultures were incubated at 35" for 24 hr postadsorption. All cultures were frozenthawed, and the resulting lysates were clarified and assayed for virus content by plaquing on BHK-21 cells. As a control, the same procedure described above was followed using VSV for infection. Determination of 13H]uridine incorporation. Subconfluent BHK-21 cell monolayers in 60-mm petri dishes were exposed to IBV-Beaudette at an input multiplicity of 50-60 EIU/cell for 30 min. Infected cultures received 5 ml of RMEM (with 2% FCS and 4% TPB) and a-amanitin (20 pglml) was added to one group of cultures immediately after adsorption (0 time) and to another group after cultures had been first incubated at 37 for 2 hr postadsorption. For each of these groups, after cells had been incubated with cu-amanitin for 3 hr, the medium was replaced with RMEM containing actinomycin D (0.75 pg/ml) and 1 hr later all cultures received 25 ,uCi per plate [3H]uridine. Thereafter, these cell monolayers were pulse-labeled for 2 hr at 37" before being washed three times with cold BSS, removed by scraping, and sedimented by low-speed centrifugation. To the packed cells was added 3 ml of cold 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and the precipitates formed after overnight incubation at 4" were collected on Schleicher-&hue11 B-6 cellulose nitrate filters. The precipitates were washed five times with 5-ml aliquots of cold 5% TCA and once with cold 95% ethanol. After being dried, the filters were incubated for 2 hr at room temperature in liquid scintillation vials containing 0.2 ml H,O and 1 ml Protosol (New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass.) before further l-ml additions of benzoyl peroxide (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Plainview, N. Y.) and Protosol were made. Vials were agitated mechanically for 60 min after which 10 ml of a toluene-based cocktail (4.0 g PPO, 0.2 g dimethyl-POPOP/liter toluene) containing 1% ascorbic acid was added. The vials were counted for radioactivity in a Beckman LS-8000 scintillation counter using external tritium standardization. Chemicals. The a-amanitin was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO.). Actinomycin D was a gift from Dr. J. Oliver Lampen of this Institute. Cytochalasin B was obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc. (Milwaukee, Wis.). The E3H]uridine (specific activity = 27.9 Ci/mmol) was obtained from New England Nuclear (Boston, Mass.).
