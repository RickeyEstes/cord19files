Three of the most common correction methods: No-Shift, Threshold, and Proportional methods are selected for this study to integrate the effect of twisted winds on the outcome of AVA. These correction methods are common practices of AVA but are not documented officially. The important details and calculation technique of each correction method are described below. Any deviation in wind direction of an approaching wind profile is ignored in the No-Shift method. Therefore, the probability of occurrence of wind in a given direction at the site is similar to the corresponding probability in the same direction far upstream of the project site. The Threshold method defines a threshold angle (θ T ), of which the exceedance is only considered for adjusting the probability of occurrence of wind. When a deviation of wind direction, also known as yaw angle (θ), exceeds θ T , the wind is considered to be approaching in a direction other than the direction far upstream of the site. Consequently, the corresponding probability of occurrence of wind (p) is shifting from the original wind sector, ith, to an adjacent wind sector, i ± 1th, according to the direction of yaw angle (i.e., clockwise or anticlockwise). As a result of the shift in wind direction, the probability of occurrence of winds of the ith wind sector becomes zero (p i = 0) and the i ± 1th wind sector has the sum of probabilities of the original and the adjacent wind sectors (p' i ± 1 = p i + p i ± 1 ). There are two main drawbacks in the Threshold method: first, there is not a generally accepted value for θ T . Second, the method to compare θ with θ T is not well defined. The latter can be any of the maximum yaw angle, the average yaw angle, or the yaw angle at the pedestrian level of the approaching wind profile. Therefore, the outcomes of the Threshold method can vary significantly according to the selection of θ and θ T for the calculation. The Proportional method modifies the p value of a given wind sector using the values of θ and p of the given and adjacent wind sectors. Compared to other two correction methods, the Proportional method is well-organized with clearly defined variables and a calculation method. For example, the method uses θ averaged over the profile height and considers clockwise angles as positive. The calculation procedure of the Proportional method is shown in Equation (4) .  where, ′ p i = the adjusted probability of occurrence of ith wind direction; + θ i 1 = the yaw angle for the sector to the right of the ith tested wind direction.
