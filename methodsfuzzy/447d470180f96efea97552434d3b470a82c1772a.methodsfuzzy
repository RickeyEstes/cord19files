The Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia created a rapid response team (RRT) as part of its response to MERS outbreaks in public and private health care facilities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The main objective of the RRT is to ensure that all health care facilities are complying with Ministry of Health IPC guidelines and receive timely and appropriate technical support and supplies as deemed necessary. The RRT visits the health facilities, conducts independent assessments, audits IPC measures, and assesses the performances of the IPC team and HCWs. The RRT assesses the IPC performance within health facilities using a detailed structured checklist composed of 10 elements (approximately 125 specific observations). Each element is given a score of 0-2, depending on whether the health facility was fully, partially, or noncompliant. By the end of each visit, the RRT develops action plans with the hospital management to be immediately implemented. According to the IPC guidelines, the hospital leadership is accountable for supporting the infection prevention activities that are relevant to the services provided and the patient populations cared for at the facility. The hospital ensures presence of â‰¥1 dedicated qualified IPC staff, adherence of HCWs to IPC measures, and presence of a designated triage area in the ER for suspected MERS that is physically separated from other areas in the ER. The IPC guidelines have a special section for collection of biologic specimens and for aerosolgenerating procedures. Suspected MERS patients and other persons in the triage area (eg, persons accompanying suspected MERS patients) are instructed to wear facemasks and are placed in a separated area (by at least 1.5 m) from each other. Demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical data about laboratoryconfirmed MERS cases were obtained from the Health Electronic Surveillance Network of Saudi Arabia and LTHR paper and e-medical records of the patients. We used Microsoft Excel 2013 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) for data entry; Epi Info 7 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA) was used for analysis of data and plotting epidemic curves for the outbreak. The collected data were used to construct 2 detailed chronologic time lines for each patient using 3-and 24-hour intervals to illustrate the dynamics of movements and outcome of patients throughout their stay in the hospital. We divided the outbreak into 3 phases based on the awareness of HCWs and implementation of IPC measures. At the beginning of the outbreak (phase I), there was inadequate awareness of HCWs at the LTHR about emergence of an outbreak of MERS in the hospital. When the hospital administration became aware about the increased number of MERS cases, additional but inadequate IPC measures were put in place (phase II). Toward the end of the outbreak (phase III), strict IPC measures were implemented. Then, the LTHR management decided to close the ER, suspend elective surgeries, and postpone all outpatient appointments and visits. 12 We obtained the number of patients that visited the ER seeking medical care during each phase of the outbreak. We calculated the crude secondary attack rate per 10,000 patients (SAR/ 10,000). SAR/10,000 was defined as the number of MERS cases that occurred within 14 days among patients visiting the ER for medical care after exposure to a primary or secondary case. The RRT visited the LTHR 11 times during the outbreak: 5 times during phase II and 6 times during phase III. The RRT was not invited to visit the LTHR during phase I. The first assessment was conducted on August 6, 2015, and the last assessment was conducted on September 13, 2015. The RRT ascertained the level of awareness of HCWs of the case definition of a suspected case of MERS; presence of written IPC policies or guidelines for suspected or confirmed MERS patients; reporting, postexposure evaluation, and followup; and receipt of support of administration of the LTHR. The RRT also checked whether or not appropriate PPE for HCWs was made readily available in the ER at the LTHR. More HCWs were screened toward the end of the outbreak to alleviate and respond to a wave of panicking that swept the hospital, especially the staff working at the ER. We used the time line, a well-defined algorithm, and the epidemiologic links to identify chains of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary generations of MERS cases that were acquired within the LTHR. Each chain of secondary cases was tracked back to a single primary case. We reviewed the medical records of each case (primary or secondary) admitted to the ER of LTHR to exclude exposure to MERS from a previous visit to the ER or other departments within the hospital where we conducted the study. Throughout the course of the outbreak, the LTHR screened 1,310 HCWs and inpatients for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). More details about the setup and workforce of the LTHR at the time of the outbreak are published elsewhere. 10
