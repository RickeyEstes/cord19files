Human primary epithelial kidney (HPEK) cells were prepared from human renal tissue after nephrectomy from portions of the kidney (carcinoma free) and immunomagnetically isolated as described before and grown in medium 199 with 10% FBS at 37°C [12] . SARS-CoV strain FFM 1 [1] and strain 6109 (courtesy of Prof. Wilina Lim, Government Virus Unit, Hong-Kong) were prepared by infecting Vero cell cultures. Supernatants from infected cultures were collected 2 days post-infection and aliquots were stored at À80°C. Virus titres were determined by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) in confluent cells in 96-well microtitre plates as described [3] . Antiviral assay. Confluent cell cultures were infected with SARScoronavirus strain FFM1 or strain 6109, for 1 h in 96-well microplates. After adsorption period, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in MEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Cytopathogenic effect (CPE) was assessed visually 72 h after infection. In some experiments virus yield reduction assay was performed as described before [8] . Confluent cell layers grown in 12.5 cm 2 cell culture flasks were infected with SARS-CoV strain FFM 1 or 6109. After 1 h incubation period, cells were washed four times with PBS and incubated (37°C) in MEM supplemented with 2% FBS. After 72 h cultures and supernatants were freeze-thawed and viral titres were determined by the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) in confluent Vero cells on 96-well mictrotitre plates [8] . The inhibitory effects were expressed as effective concentrations of compounds required to inhibit infectious virus titres by 50% (EC 50 ), 75% (EC 75 ) or 90% (EC 90 ) of the control value, respectively. Combination studies. Combination indices (CIs) indicating whether both substances acted synergistically, additively, or antagonistically when used in combination were calculated using CalcuSyn for Windows. The calculation is based on the method of Chou and Talalay [13] . A CI lower 1 indicates synergistic action, a CI higher 1 indicates antagonistic action, and a CI of 1 indicates additive action.
