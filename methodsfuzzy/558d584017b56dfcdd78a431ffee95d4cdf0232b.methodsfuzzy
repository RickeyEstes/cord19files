Viruses have a simple structure with a protein coat enclosed with only one type of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) rather than both. Thus, methods for viral diagnosis target one of the components of the virus structure. For a definitive viral disease diagnosis, four basic approaches are used: direct detection by virus isolation or direct identification, viral serology for detection of a specific antibody, viral antigen detection, and molecular-based detection of genetic material. A brief discussion of the principles of diagnostic assays representative of each approach follows. Gross Pathologic and Histopathologic Findings Histologic (Fig. 2 ) and cytologic examination (Fig. 3 ) of tissues and fluids by a board-certified veterinary pathologist contributes valuable information about the pathologic signs, gross and microscopic, that distinguish infections caused by viral or bacterial pathogens and other possible etiologies. Tissue tropism, mononuclear infiltrates, development of inclusion bodies (intranuclear, cytoplasmic, or both), and the formation of syncytia are some of the characteristics that differ among viruses and can sometimes distinguish different viral infections. For example, most DNA viruses replicate in the nucleus, and thus tend to produce intranuclear inclusions, whereas most RNA viruses form cytoplasmic inclusions, although there are exceptions. As part of the pathologist's examination, immunohistochemistry testing (Figs. 4 and 5), fluorescent antibody testing, and possibly in situ hybridization (ISH) studies on tissues may be ordered; these methods are considered elsewhere in this article. A complete histopathology report should include possible differentials for the lesions. The pathologist might note that some findings do not exactly fit the routine lesions he or she has observed in previously. In cases in which there are deviations in lesion type or distribution or when gross lesions and histopathologic findings suggest the involvement of a viral disease but routine virology tests do not detect the expected conventional viral agents, variant or ''emerging'' viruses or even iatrogenic infections may be suspected. In early 1990, blue tongue virus serotype 11 was introduced in canine populations from a commercial modified-live multivalent canine vaccine that was associated with high mortality in dogs [31, 32] . In some situations, second or even third opinions from pathologists at other laboratories who have special expertise should be solicited [33] . With the application of telepathology to veterinary case materials, networks of specialists, including veterinary pathologists, small animal clinicians, infectious disease specialists, and laboratory diagnosticians, are able to exchange patient histories, clinical data, and images (gross and microscopic) through the Internet for consultation, diagnosis, and education. This allows timely access to expert opinions at other locations throughout the world [34, 35] . The use of telepathology can facilitate rapid intervention through the synergy of computer technology and special pathology expertise (eg, system-and speciesspecific pathologic findings) to understand the lesions in difficult cases better. EM is often used in veterinary diagnostic laboratories to detect enteric viruses in fecal samples retrieved during the course of viral diarrheal disease. Additionally, EM is indispensable for identification of emerging and previously unidentified viruses in clinical samples [36] , and this method has helped in the identification of many new viruses, including, most recently, bat Lyssavirus [37] . Viruses can be classified up to the virus family based on size, shape, and distinctive structural features, such as envelopes or protein spikes, particularly for parvovirus, rotavirus (Fig. 6) , coronavirus, astrovirus, herpesvirus, poxvirus, and picornavirus. EM allows detection of multiple viruses simultaneously. Application of antibodies to supplement the EM diagnosis provides higher sensitivity and further confirmation of the viral diagnosis. Sensitivity is the major limitation of EM, and at least 10 5 to 10 7 virus particles per milliliter must be present in the sample being examined. Because the electron microscope is an expensive piece of equipment that requires special technical skills and a high level of expertise, it is not available in many laboratories. Viral components can also be determined by several basic biochemistry experiments. Acridine orange (AO) staining can determine the nature of the nucleic acid of purified viral particles [38] . Differentiation as to whether the nucleic acid is single-or double-stranded in nature is based on the color developed on AO staining; double-stranded DNA or RNA nucleic acids stain yellow green, whereas single-stranded DNA or RNA acids stain flame red. Nuclease susceptibility of the purified virions differentiates DNA from RNA. The presence of envelope on viruses can be determined by susceptibility to the virus to heat, ether, or other lipid solvents [39] . The titrated virus preparation is treated with ether or chloroform. A decrease in virus titer of greater than 1 log is considered to be significant to indicate the presence of envelope on the virus. The presence of envelope indicates that virus is susceptible to common disinfectants. Lack of envelope indicates that the virus is resistant to the use of common disinfectants. An advantage of nucleic acid-based testing is that specimens submitted for analysis do not have to have viable viral particles present to be detected by this means. There is a trend toward application of molecular or gene sequence-based techniques to routine virology testing in diagnostic laboratories, which is justified under several circumstances. First, a molecular technique may be the test of choice if conventional methods of diagnosis are technically weak, such as when a viral agent is noncultivable or there are biocontainment concerns with culturing the virus, the virus has amorphous morphology by EM, antibodies are unavailable or not specific to the virus, and serologic tests result in a confounding diagnosis. Second, molecular techniques may be essential to detect and classify the sequence type or genotype of a virus. Third, a viral agent may be characteristically slow to replicate, such as c-herpes virus; thus, a molecular method might provide a better turn-around time for diagnosis. In this instance, a rapid diagnosis might be achieved by pan-herpesvirus PCR. Finally, a novel viral isolate that cannot be definitively identified by the routine diagnostic methods described previously may merit investigation and characterization by molecular-based techniques, which are indispensable in the classification of new and emerging viruses. These advanced techniques may confirm a diagnosis of viral etiology when other tests have failed; however, they are, unfortunately, relatively expensive. Furthermore, the presence of nucleic acid does not equate to infection, and infections are attributable to subclinical, latency-associated nucleic acids or defective interfering virus particles, such as in paramyxoviruses, produced in nonproductive infections in genetically resistant hosts. Clients, who bear the financial burden, should be counseled as to the benefit and shortfalls of this testing before ordering molecular-based tests. An excellent review of molecular-based techniques for diagnostic testing of infectious diseases has appeared in a previous issue in this series [46] .
