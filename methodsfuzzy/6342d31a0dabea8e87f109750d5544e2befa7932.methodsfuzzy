Patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic HSCT eventually lose immunity to the common childhood diseases and should be serially reimmunized 6 and 24 months after transplantation (Table 312-4; see Fig. 312-1) . 181, 301 The efficacy of vaccination is influenced by the time elapsed since transplantation, the nature of the hematopoietic graft, the presence of GVHD, and the use of serial immunization. 302 There have been no reports of exacerbation of GVHD after immunization of patients who underwent HSCT. A national survey of HSCT immunization practices revealed that vaccines were underutilized and schedules for revaccination varied. 303 To ensure compliance it is recommended that all transplant recipients should be immunized on the same schedule, regardless of cell source. 304 All indicated nonlive vaccines should be administered to patients who have undergone HSCT, regardless of transplant type or presence of GVHD. Such patients should be revaccinated every 10 years with the combined tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis toxoid, absorbed. are highly suggestive of aspergillosis or other mold infection in a neutropenic host. 82 Bronchoscopy with cytologic examination and culture of lavage fluid for fungi, as well as other organisms common to immunocompromised hosts, is important. Galactomannan assay of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid may have augmented diagnostic value. A lack of clinical or radiographic response during empirical antifungal therapy may necessitate tissue sampling. Minimally invasive surgery (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) is associated with less morbidity than is open-lung biopsy. Patients who have undergone HSCT and have suspected invasive mold infections should promptly begin taking a mold-active antifungal agent while diagnostic procedures are being arranged. Advancedgeneration azole agents and echinocandins have less nephrotoxicity than do lipid preparations of amphotericin B. A lack of clinical or radiographic response during proven infection may necessitate a switch to an agent from a different class or to combination therapy. Combination treatment of fungal infections with echinocandins, azoles, and polyene agents is common, whereas results of a large randomized clinical trial failed to show a benefit. Echinocandin agents may be fungistatic rather than fungicidal in the case of mold infections because their interruption of cell wall synthesis is limited to actively growing hyphae. For documented invasive tissue mold infection, therapy is usually continued until some weeks (4 to 6) after lesions are resolved or stable, immunocompetence has improved, and the patient is afebrile. Although amphotericin B had been the gold standard antifungal agent since the 1960s, voriconazole produced superior outcomes in treatment for aspergillosis in 53% of patients, in contrast to 32% of patients treated with amphotericin B (followed by other antifungal therapy). 245 Treatment of central nervous system mold infections should include voriconazole, which (on the basis of a few patients studied) attains cerebrospinal fluid levels approximately 50% of plasma levels and central nervous system tissue levels approximately 200% of plasma levels (see Chapter 39) . After initial control of an Aspergillus infection, subsequent maintenance therapy for the duration of immunosuppression has been advocated to reduce the risk for reactivation. Multiple drug-drug interactions occur with the azoles, and adjustments may be required for immunosuppressive agents. Transient visual disturbances or hallucinations can occur with voriconazole. Difficulty in achieving therapeutic plasma drug levels complicates the administration of itraconazole and posaconazole. Itraconazole solution has improved oral bioavailability over the capsule and can be used, although blood level monitoring may be needed to ensure adequate absorption. Posaconazole has good antimold activity, but its oral absorption requires high fat intake, which may not be feasible in patients with GVHD or other enteric complications.
