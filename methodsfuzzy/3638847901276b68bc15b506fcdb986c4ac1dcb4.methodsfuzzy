Materials. Fluorogenic peptide substrate Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGF RKME-Edans was prepared by Biogenesis (Taiwan). The peptide was purified to a single peak by using HPLC. The plasmid mini-prep kit, DNA gel extraction kit, and Ni-NTA resin were purchased from Qiagen. FXa and the protein expression kit (including the pET32Xa/ LIC vector and competent JM109 and BL21 cells) were obtained from Novagen. DTT was purchased from Pierce. 1-Hydroxypyridine-2thione zinc was purchased from Sigma. All commercial buffers and reagents were of the highest grade. Expression and purification of SARS main protease. The gene encoding SARS main protease was cloned from viral whole genome obtained from National Taiwan University [8] by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the primers (forward primer 5 0 -GGT ATTGAGGGTCGCAGTGGTTTTAGG-3 0 and reverse primer 5 0 -AGAGGAGAGTTAGAGCCTTATTGGAAGGTAACACC-3 0 ) into the pET32Xa/Lic vector using the same strategy as previously reported [18] . The recombinant protease plasmid was then used to transform E. coli JM109 competent cells that were streaked on a Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plate containing 100 lg/mL ampicillin. Ampicillin-resistant colonies were selected from the agar plate and grown in 5 mL LB culture containing 100 lg/mL ampicillin overnight at 37°C. The correct construct was subsequently transformed to E. coli BL21 for protein expression. The 5-mL overnight culture of a single transformant was used to inoculate 500 mL of fresh LB medium containing 100 lg/mL ampicillin. The cells were grown to A 600 ¼ 0:6 and induced with 1 mM isopropyl-b-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4-5 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7000g for 15 min. The enzyme purification was conducted at 4°C. The cell paste obtained from 2-L cell culture was suspended in 80 mL lysis buffer containing 12 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA in the presence of 7.5 mM b-ME, 1 mM DTT plus 7.5 mM b-ME, 2 mM DTT, or 17.5 mM b-ME. French-press instrument (AIM-AMINCO spectronic Instruments) was used to disrupt the cells at 12,000 psi. The lysis solution was centrifuged and the debris was discarded. The cell free extract was loaded onto a 20 mL Ni-NTA column which was equilibrated with 12 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM imidazole containing different combinations of reducing agents (7.5 mM b-ME, 7.5 mM b-ME plus 1 mM DTT, 17.5 mM b-ME, or 2 mM DTT). The column was washed with 5 mM imidazole followed by 30 mM imidazole-containing buffer. Histagged protease was eluted with 12 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 300 mM imidazole containing the aforementioned reducing agents. The protein solution was dialyzed against 2 Â 2 L buffer (12 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and the reducing agents). His-tagged protease was then digested with FXa protease to remove the tag and the mixture was loaded onto Ni-NTA. The untagged protease in flowthrough (12 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM imidazole containing the reducing agents) was highly pure according to SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 1) and was dialyzed to buffer (12 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA with reducing agents) for storage. The purified protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry. The enzyme concentration used in all experiments was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm. Activity assay of the protease using the fluorogenic substrate. The kinetic measurements were performed in 20 mM Bis-Tris (pH 7.0) at 25°C. Enhanced fluorescence due to cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate peptide (Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans) was monitored at 538 nm with excitation at 355 nm using a fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent from ThermoLabsystems, Sweden). The enzyme concentration used in measuring K m and k cat values was 50 nM and the substrate concentrations from 0.5-to 5-fold K m value were used. Substrate concentration was determined by using the extinction coefficients 5438 M À1 cm À1 at 336 nm (Edans) and 15,100 M À1 cm À1 at 472 nm (Dabcyl). The initial rate within 10% substrate consumption was used to calculate the kinetic parameters using Michaelis-Menten equation fitting by the KaleidaGraph computer program. Enzyme concentration ranges of 5-150 or 50-3000 nM with 60 lM fluorogenic substrate were used to determine the apparent dimermonomer dissociation constant K d . The K d values were obtained by fitting the plot of reaction rates versus enzyme concentration to the following equations assuming the dimer is active and the monomer is inactive [19] . In these equations, ½D is the dimer concentration, ½M is the monomer concentration, the total enzyme concentration ½E t ¼ ½M þ 2½D, v is the observed reaction rate, and As is the activity of dimer. Gel filtration determination of protein form. The molecular species of the SARS protease was determined on a pre-packed Sephadex G-200 column (1 cm Â 20 cm, Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech) by comparing the elution volume of the protease with those of protein molecular mass standards including aldolase (170 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa). The same buffer used in Ni-NTA column was used to elute the proteins at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Inhibition assay. The IC 50 value of 1-hydroxypyridine-2-thione zinc was measured in a reaction mixture containing 50 nM SARS protease, 6 lM fluorogenic substrate in a buffer of 12 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT plus 7.5 mM b-ME in the presence of various concentrations of the inhibitor which ranged from 0 to 50 lM. The fluorescence change resulted from the reaction was followed with time using the 96-well fluorescence plate reader. The initial velocities of the inhibited reactions were plotted against the different inhibitor concentrations to obtain the IC 50 by fitting with the following equation: In this equation, AðIÞ is the enzyme activity with inhibitor concentration I; Að0Þ is the enzyme activity without inhibitor; and I is the inhibitor concentration.
