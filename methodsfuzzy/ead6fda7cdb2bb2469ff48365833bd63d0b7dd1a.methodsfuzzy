Given the model structure with quarantine and isolation ( Figure 2 ), we used the next generation matrix [21, 22] to derive a formula for the control reproduction number when control measures are in force, as follows: We used the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to fit the model and adopted an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to carry out the MCMC procedure. The algorithm is run for 100,000 iterations with a burn-in of the first 70,000 iterations, and the Geweke convergence diagnostic method is employed to assess convergence of chains. We employed the likelihood-based method or generation interval-informed method of White and Pagano [23] , using the following formula: where φ t = R c k j=1 p j N t− j , k is the maximum value of the serial interval (chosen as k = 6 here) and Γ(x) is the gamma function. N = {N 0 , N 1 , . . . , N T }, where N j denotes the total number of cases on day j and T is the last day of observations. p j is the probability function for the generation interval on day j. We assume that the generation interval follows a gamma distribution with mean E and variance V. Since the generation interval of the 2019-nCoV is undetermined, we investigated the sensitivity of R c to different E values ranging from 2 to 8 days (given in Table 2 ).
