Other metals than zinc have been used to mediate the synthesis of a-fluoroacrylates from EDBFA. In 2003, the group of Mioskowski and Falck developed a straightforward diastereoselective Cr(II)mediated olefination starting from commercially available trihaloacetates and aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes. 40 A series of ahaloacrylates have been synthesized in very high yields and with full stereocontrol (>99%) for the (Z)-isomer using CrCl 2 as a mediator. The chromium salt can be used alone in excess (4.5 equiv) or in substoichiometric quantity (50 mol %) in combination with Mn/ TMSCl regeneration system. Ketones are also suitable for this transformation giving high level of diastereoselectivity but moderate yields. Using this methodology, EDBFA was reacted with aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes to afford exclusively the corresponding (Z)-a-fluoroacrylates 19 in very high yields (Scheme 21). The authors suggested that a Reformatsky-type adduct 25 is formed by oxidative addition of Cr(II) into the CeX bond (X¼Br, Cl) via two consecutive single electron transfers followed by addition to the carbonyl of the aldehyde. Subsequent metalation results in an E2-elimination from the most favored antiperiplanar conformation (Fig. 1 , minimum interactions between R 1 and the ester group) leading exclusively to the (Z)-a-haloacrylate. In order to support this mechanism, a series of dihalohydrins derived from the Reformatsky-type adduct 25 were isolated by carrying out the reaction with lower quantity of chromium and at low temperature. Those dihalohydrins were then subjected to the Cr(II)-mediated olefination conditions and gave rise to (Z)-a-haloacrylates exclusively with comparable yields, which is consistent with the proposed mechanism. Overall, this Cr(II)-mediated olefination is a powerful one-pot and highly stereoselective approach to (Z)-a-fluoroacrylates 19 from EDBFA. However, the main drawback is the relative toxicity and high cost of the chromium salt. A few years later, the group of Cancell on developed a similar reaction using manganese as a mediator. 41 Manganese is lesstoxic and cheaper than chromium salts but is coated by an outer shell of oxide, which requires a preliminary activation (Mn*). The stereoselective synthesis of (Z)-a-haloacrylates (ratio Z/E >98:2) was possible by reacting 5 equiv of Mn* with aldehydes and trihaloesters in refluxing THF. The reaction was applied to EDBFA with two aliphatic aldehydes (cyclohexanal and sbutanal) to get the corresponding (Z)-a-fluoroacrylates 19 in moderate yields and very high diastereoselectivity (Scheme 22). In this case, it was necessary to carry the reaction at room temperature to avoid the formation of the non-halogenated acrylate as a side-product. elastase. 42 Based on their previous work regarding the Rhcatalyzed synthesis of difluoro-b-lactams from imines using Et 2 Zn, 43 the group of Ando looked at the same reaction using EDBFA in place of ethyl bromodifluoroacetate. 17, 44 Using the same conditions with the N-benzylimine derived from benzaldehyde, (1 mol % RhClPPh 3 ) 3 , Et 2 Zn (3 equiv) in THF at À10 C, the desired a-bromoa-fluoro-b-lactam was obtained as the syn isomer exclusively in 63% yield along with 15% of the corresponding fluorinated aziridine. Further investigations of the reaction conditions showed that the transformation was more efficient in diethylether and without Rh-catalyst (Scheme 23). Hence, the reaction was applied to a variety of aromatic imines bearing both electron-withdrawing and -donating groups to afford the corresponding syn-b-lactams 26 in good yields and complete diastereoselectivity. However, aliphatic imines were not suitable for this reaction. The syn configuration of one fluorinated b-lactam was confirmed by single X-ray analysis. The synthesis of fluorinated b-lactams was realized in a noncoordinative solvent, diethylether. Hence, the mechanism of the reaction might be explained by the predominant formation of the (Z)-zinc enolate 28 due to coordination between the bromine atom and zinc to form a five-membered ring (Scheme 24). This hypothesis was supported by DFT calculations. This (Z)-zinc enolate 28 adds to the imine leading to chair-like transitions states. 1,3-Diaxial repulsion between the bromine atom and the N-substituent as well as between the aryl and the ethoxy groups explains the selectivity towards the fluorinated syn-b-lactam.
