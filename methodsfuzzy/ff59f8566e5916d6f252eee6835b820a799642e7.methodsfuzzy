Methods used to produce human monoclonal Abs (mAbs) include combinatorial display libraries, B cell immortalization, single-cell expression cloning and hybridoma generation (Figure 3 ) (51) (52) (53) . Each of these methods has been used to improve our understanding of the Bmem repertoire. Generation of combinatorial display libraries of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and Ag-binding fragments (Fabs) ( Figure 3A) is a high-throughput screening method that has allowed discovery of several pathogen-neutralizing Abs (54-57). Libraries of Ab V genes are generated from B cells isolated from an individual post-immunization or post-infection. These random pairs of H and L chain genes are then expressed on phage, yeast or mammalian cells. The Ag-specific Ab-expressing cells or particles are selected and cloned into mammalian cells for mAb expression. Since the H and L chain pairing occurs randomly during this process, the resulting Ab does not represent a pairing that may occur naturally in the immune system. This technique can allow generation of higher affinity Abs but does not allow characterization of the properly-paired Ag-specific B cell repertoire. B cell immortalization ( Figure 3B ) involves transformation of Bmem using Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) in the presence of TLR (Toll-like receptor) 9 agonist CpG DNA (58). Total blood lymphocytes or isolated IgG + Bmem are typically cultured with EBV and CpG and/or additional co-stimulants for 1-2 weeks to allow proliferation of B cells and secretion of Abs. Supernatants from the cultures are then harvested to test for Ag-specific Ab after which the individual Ig H and L chain pairs are cloned and sequenced. EBV-transformed B cells allow Bmem analysis but require screening of significant numbers of cells (∼1,000) to identify the very few Bmem (∼10) of interest. Bmem can also be immortalized by forced expression of BCL6 and BCL-XL and when cultured in the presence of CD40L/IL-21 these plasmablastlike transduced cells secrete Ab in the supernatant (59) . While plasmablasts are not amenable to immortalization, recent studies have demonstrated that both Bmem and plasmablasts can be cultured in vitro (Figure 3C) , without immortalization, for Ab production (60-62). Single-cell expression cloning involves application of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the singlecell level for the amplification of Ig H and L chain genes that can be cloned and expressed in mammalian cell lines ( Figure 3D ). Plasmablasts and Bmem have been sorted from individuals post-vaccination or post-infection to generate human mAbs by single-cell expression cloning. This technique involves specific PCR amplification of Ab transcripts from individual cells and is technically challenging and dependent upon high quality primers (63) . Application of single-cell expression cloning for repertoire analyses can be difficult in peripheral B cell subsets that have fewer Ig transcripts per cell than plasmablasts (64) . Plasmablasts that secrete larger quantities of Ig are more amenable to these types of protocols. Although number of circulating plasmablasts are typically low in healthy individuals, 5-8 days after vaccination (or infection) there is a transient but large population of Ag-specific Ig-secreting cells that can be easily isolated (63, 65) . This population can be distinguished from the IgG + Bmem population which peaks at 2-3 weeks post-immunization. Plasmablasts sorted from human PBMC 1 week after vaccination against influenza, Bacillus anthracis and Streptococcus pneumoniae have successfully yielded Ag-specific and high affinity mAbs (52) . Ag-specific plasmablasts and Bmem have been isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using reagents that bind Ag-specific cells (Ag baiting) (66) (67) (68) (69) (70) (71) . IgG + PCs and plasmablasts are difficult to isolate in an Ag-specific manner due to their limited surface expression of Ig (72) . However, a flow cytometry-based Ig capture assay was established to sort IgG + Ag-specific plasmablasts for three vaccine Ags, namely HIV gp140, tetanus toxin and Hepatitis B surface Ag (73) . This method captured the secreted Ab from the plasmablast enabling the fluorescent Ag probe to identify Ag-specific cells. Isolating Ag-specific human Bmem is also challenging since they circulate at very low frequencies in the periphery (74) but they can be expanded in vitro and immortalized using EBVtransformation techniques mentioned earlier. A recent study isolated human CD27 + Bmem and demonstrated that "an in vitro booster vaccination" consisting of streptavidin-coated nanoparticles conjugated with biotinylated Ag and CpG DNA generated Ag-specific mAbs in a period of 6 days (75). Traditional mAb generation methods such as hybridoma technology ( Figure 3E ) involve the production of Ab from a hybridoma clone formed by the fusion of a myeloma cell with B cell from a donor or an immunized animal (53, 76) . Although this method can generate high affinity mAb, it has to be combined with transgenic humanized mouse strains to obtain fully human mAb (77).
