e samples were analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions by using the RespiFinder ® SMART 22 FAST. is assay can detect and differentiate simultaneously 22 respiratory pathogens: 18 viruses (influenza viruses A and B, influenza virus A H1N1, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 and 4, rhinovirus (RV)/enterovirus, coronaviruses (Cor) (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), human metapneumovirus (hMPV)), adenovirus (ADV), bocavirus (BoV), and 4 bacteria (Legionella pneumophila, Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae) [12] . 175 μl of TS samples were eluted in 40 μl of elution buffer. e assays comprised a preamplification step, which combines reverse transcriptase and multiplex target amplification PCR, followed by a probe hybridization step, a probe ligation step, and a probe amplification step. e Internal Amplification Control (IAC) was added at the beginning of the procedure to differentiate between samples with true-negative results and samples with false-negative results due to PCR failure. Targets are detected using capillary electrophoresis [13] .
