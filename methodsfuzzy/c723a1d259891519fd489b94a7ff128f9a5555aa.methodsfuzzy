Because surface chemistry affects partitioning, we considered both unenveloped and lipid-enveloped viruses: MS2 and Phi6, respectively. MS2 (ATCC 15597-B1) is an icosahedral, singlestranded RNA bacteriophage ∼27 nm in diameter and is widely used as a surrogate for enteric viruses in environmental studies. 20−23 Phi6 (kindly provided by P. Turner of Yale University, New Haven, CT) is an icosahedral, double-stranded RNA bacteriophage ∼85 nm in diameter and has been proposed as a surrogate for Ebola virus, 24 although the structures of the two viruses differ (i.e., roughly spherical vs filamentous). Table S1 of the Supporting Information compares the structure of Ebola virus and the two surrogates. We propagated the bacteriophages using host bacteria, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas syringae, and standard culture methods. Concentrations in stock suspensions were 10 8 −10 10 plaque-forming units per milliliter (PFU mL −1 ). We tested four bowl-shaped materials commonly used in wastewater systems: porcelain, PVC, polypropylene, and concrete. The Supporting Information provides further details about the containers used in this study. As a surrogate for diarrhea, we tested both synthetic sludge and real sludge collected from a wastewater treatment plant. We considered both types of sludge to balance a well-defined composition of the fluid against real-world conditions. For synthetic sludge, we followed a published recipe 25 with the following modifications. We adjusted the solid content to match that of our actual sludge. We substituted egg white albumin for bovine serum albumin for economic reasons. We used a strain of Bacillus and E. coli isolated from anaerobically digested sludge as model Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms of enteric relevance, rather than yeast. For real sludge, we collected anaerobically digested sludge from a wastewater treatment plant whose flow is dominated by domestic sources (>99%). We stored the sludge at 4°C and used it within a few weeks of collection to ensure a robust population of microorganisms. Its total solid content was 30 g L −1 , and its volatile solid content was 3.5%. Table S2 shows additional properties of the sludge. We did not sterilize the sludge out of concern that doing so would alter its properties and affect partitioning results. We seeded both types of sludge with MS2 or Phi6 to achieve a final bacteriophage concentration of 10 7 PFU mL −1 . We conducted experiments in triplicate for each combination of bacteriophage, material, and type of sludge (2 × 4 × 2 = 16 combinations), as illustrated in Figure S1 . For each replicate, we filled a container with 10 mL of sludge seeded with bacteriophage and 40 mL of autoclaved, ultrapure water to achieve a dilution similar to what might occur with diarrhea in a toilet. After 5−10 min, we transferred the fluid, including suspended solids, to a sterile, 50 mL tube and centrifuged it at 1700 rcf for 3 min. We collected the supernatant as the "liquid" fraction. We poured excess fluid off the pelleted solids, briefly vortexed them, and denoted these as the "solid" fraction. Following established methods for recovery of viruses from surfaces, 26, 27 we collected the "surface" fraction using three sterile cotton swabs (Puritan 22029488) in series, each premoistened with sterile LB broth. We swabbed systematically and with constant pressure over the entire exposed surface area and subsequently eluted virus from the three swabs into 1 mL of LB broth by compressing and swirling the swab in a sample tube. The swabbed surface area was ∼115 cm 2 (±10%) for all materials. To prepare samples for analysis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we first converted RNA to cDNA. Immediately upon separating the fractions, we extracted RNA from 140 μL subsamples of each fraction using a Qiagen QiAamp Viral RNA kit. For calibration standards, we also extracted viral RNA from serially diluted stock suspensions of each bacteriophage, whose concentration (PFU mL −1 ) was determined by a plaque assay, and carried it through the entire preparation and analysis process. 28, 29 We omitted carrier RNA from the extraction processes to increase RNA extraction efficiency, and we subjected Phi6 RNA to a postextraction heat shock treatment (110°C, 5 min). 30 We immediately synthesized cDNA using a Bio-Rad iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit with 5 μL of template RNA, 4 μL of iScript 5x, 1 μL of reverse transcriptase, and 10 μL of nuclease-free water, using the kit's recommended thermocycler protocol. We stored samples at −20°C until they were analyzed. We used qPCR to quantify virus concentration in each fraction and in the calibration standards in terms of PFU equivalents per milliliter. We analyzed fractions from synthetic sludge in triplicate (experimental replicates) by intercalating dye-based qPCR using Bio-Rad SYBR Green Mastermix with 5 μL of SYBR Green, 400 nM forward and reverse primers, 30,31 2.4 μL of nuclease-free water, and 1 μL of cDNA template. We analyzed fractions from real sludge in triplicate (experimental replicates) by probe-based qPCR using Bio-Rad iQ Supermix with 5 μL of iQ Supermix, 400 nM forward and reverse primers, 300 nM probe, 30 1.72 μL of nuclease-free water, and 1 μL of cDNA template. Table S3 shows the primers and probes, and Table S4 lists the qPCR conditions. For quality control, we employed serial dilutions of genomically sequenced calibration standards, triplicate reactions, negative template controls, and melt curve analysis. The calibration curve covered a minimum of 6 orders of magnitude to equate qPCR amplification of genomic copies to the concentration determined by a plaque assay in standards. R 2 values for calibration curves ranged from 0.96 to 0.99. We prepared serial dilutions of cDNA and analyzed all standards and samples in triplicate (technical replicates) on the qPCR machine (Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time system and C1000 thermal cycler). Negative template controls did not amplify. Additional controls are described in the Supporting Information. Of the 144 individual experimental replicates, we discarded four that failed to amplify. We reviewed preliminary qPCR results using the machine's software to verify the calibration curve and melt curve, including quantification cycle results. Melt curve analysis showed a single, well-defined peak at the expected melt temperature for the genome.
