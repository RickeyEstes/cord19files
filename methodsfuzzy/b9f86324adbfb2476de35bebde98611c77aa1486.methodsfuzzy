All the case reports and series with clinical details involving medical therapy of viral pneumonia including SARS in patients aged 15 years or above were included in this review. Patients with immunosuppressive conditions such as congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies, solid or marrow transplants, undergoing chemotherapy, and pregnancy were excluded. Where appropriate, the cited bibliographies were also retrieved for analysis. Preliminary review of these publications suggested that viral pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV constituted the majority of cases reported in the literature. However, similar to other causes of viral pneumonia, little information on the virus load changes with respect to treatment was systematically reported. Therefore, laboratory data from our cohort of 152 SARS patients who fulfilled the modified WHO definition were retrieved. 5 Virus load was measured on nasopharyngeal, serum, stool and urine specimens taken between day 10 and 15 after symptom onset. Part of these data was previously reported. 8, 10, 15, 16 The virus load results were correlated with the specific antiviral regimens, namely ribavirin with and without lopinavir/ritonavir for SARS. Serial quantitative RT-PCRs and IgG titers of SARS-CoV were performed in 12 randomly selected patients who were treated with ribavirin and corticosteroid on day 5, 10, 15 and 20 after onset of symptoms. To compare the serial virus load and antibody seroconversion with other respiratory virus infections, the English-language literature was searched to identify studies with detailed description of serial virus load and antibody titers during the course of infection.
