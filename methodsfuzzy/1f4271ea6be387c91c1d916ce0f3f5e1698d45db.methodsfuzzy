Ovomucin was first prepared by Eichholz (1898) , while working with glucoside constitution of proteins. His method involved dilution of egg white with distilled water (1:4) and separating the precipitate by centrifugation. The precipitate was then repeatedly washed with distilled water, boiled in rectified spirit, washed in ether and dried to get ovomucin. Different methods of preparation of ovomucin have been detailed in Table 2 . As a conventional method, ovomucin is extracted and purified from egg white by isoelectric precipitation method (Brooks & Hale, 1961; Donovan et al., 1970; Kato et al., 1970; Robinson & Monsey, 1971) . Briefly, egg albumin is diluted with water, followed by adjusting the pH to isoelectric precipitation of ovomucin. The gelatinous precipitate obtained is repeatedly washed with water and 2% KCl, in order to get rid of the major co-precipitating proteins like ovalbumin and lysozyme (Brooks & Hale, 1959; Kato et al., 1970) . This method was promising to adopt in industrial scale, however the precipitated ovomucin contained other egg white proteins even after repeated washings. Beveridge and Nakai (1975) prepared ovomucin as per the method of Robinson and Monsey (1971) except the replacement of 2% KCl with 2% NaCl. Recently Omana and Wu (2009a) developed a novel method for preparation of more pure ovomucin. The procedure includes precipitation of egg white using 100 mM NaCl solution at pH 6.0, followed by treating the precipitate by 500 mM NaCl solution. The precipitate was then separated by centrifugation. This method seems economically feasible to scale up for the preparation of ovomucin of purity of over 90%. Isolation of proteins from egg white by gel filtration is not uncommon. Attempt to purify ovomucin by gel permeation chromatography was first carried out by Young and Gardner (1970) , using Sepharose 4B column with a size exclusion limit of 3 Â 10 6 . Ovomucin was found in the first fraction eluted in the void volume due to its high molecular size. Several other researchers (Awade, Moreau, Molle, Brule, & Maubois, 1994; Hiidenhovi, Aro, & Kankare, 1999; Itoh et al., 1987) also attempted to prepare ovomucin by gel filtration. This method of extraction of ovomucin was found to be analytical rather than preparative. However an attempt has been made in preparative scale as well. Obtained crude ovomucin after isoelectric precipitation was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline, which was further passed on to preparative gel filtration chromatography to obtain 97% pure ovomucin (Hiidenhovi, Huopalahti, & Ryhänen, 2003) . Donovan et al. (1970) prepared ovomucin by modifying the method of Mac-Donnell, Lineweaver, and Feeney (1951) . Briefly, after lysozyme crystallization, the supernatant was adjusted to pH 4.5 and dialyzed. The precipitated ovomucin was separated by centrifugation and washing with water. Sleigh, Melrose, and Smith (1973) prepared ovomucin by ultracentrifugation method. After initial blending of thick white with 2.2 M KH 2 PO 4 , the mixture was centrifuged at 105,000g (5 C) for 75 min. The gelatinous residue was then blended in 0.5 M KH 2 PO 4 with repeated centrifugation (105,000g) for two times, followed by dialysis. Despite the low yield obtained by this method, it was attractive because of rapid isolation. Soluble ovomucin can be prepared by ultracentrifugation (59,000g) of homogenized egg white, followed by washing the gel fraction by 2% KCl until washings was free from protein (Kato, Imoto, & Yagishita, 1975) .
