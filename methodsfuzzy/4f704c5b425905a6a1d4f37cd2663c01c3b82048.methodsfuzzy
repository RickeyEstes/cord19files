Although wireless sensor networks have general design guidelines that standardize communication, power consumption, the number of cluster heads, and data aggregation, guidelines for placement of the sensors is usually based on their application. For IAQ applications some design criteria has been established for multiple sensors that may aid in tracking sources and enabling HVAC controls [23] . These criteria include the coverage of deployed sensors, a notion of sensitivity or detection threshold, and response time of the sensors [23] . For CBW applications the focus is on reducing the overall impact of the attack in terms of average impact damage, worst-case impact damage, and the cost of the sensors [24] . Understanding the basic goals or objectives of the sensors and the building environment can guide the sensor placement strategy. Based on these concepts, current methods for sensor placement design can be classified into the following categories: 1) engineering/heuristic methods, 2) optimization methods and inverse methods. Engineering methods are generally based on experience and rules of thumb for a given set of products and applications. For example a common choice for sensor placement is to uniformly place the sensors in the space. The number of sensors in this scenario may be very large, which for fairly expensive sensors may not be feasible. Other limitations of the engineering methods include a lack of control of the response time, some areas left uncovered, and lack of generalizability to multiple rooms or zones [23] . Due to these limitations of engineering methods, optimization methods have recently become popular. Optimization methods try to place sensors by taking into account the airflow patterns (from either CFD, a zonal model, or a multizone airflow model) in a building [24e32]. An objective/cost/fitness function is created based on the goals of the deployed sensors. This cost function is maximized using an optimization algorithm. Optimization methods typically result in understanding some notion of the sensor locations, coverage volume, and response time for a given set of release scenarios. There has been some investigation as to which air flow model is most appropriate (CFD, zonal, or multizone) for optimization problems [31, 32] . During this investigation multizone air flow models seem to perform just as well as CFD airflow models, and may be easier to setup and solve. In contrast, CFD simulations provide more detail information about the flow field than multizone approaches. Over the last few years many different optimization techniques Fig. 1 . Plan of action for design, identification, and response strategies to mitigate the risk involved for IAQ, CBW, and TID applications. have been developed to optimally place sensors in a building's indoor environment. Genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, and perturbation stochastic approximation methods have been used to place CBW sensors with a CFD enhanced multizone airflow model [25,30e32] . Other examples include optimal sensor location for aircraft cabins starting from a set of initial sensor locations and a set of release scenarios [26] . General recommendations for sensor locations for an aircraft cabin have been given in Ref. [27] . The applicability of inverse methods for advection-diffusion problems have been recently reviewed [28] . The adjoint probability inverse modeling method has been shown to work well in a multizone airflow model where the number of potential sensor locations is relatively small [29] . However, when the number of potential locations for a sensor is fairly large, the method (especially when involving CFD for the forward problem) may become computationally prohibitive. The use of some heuristics is usually needed to alleviate some of the computational complexity. Inverse methods [23] along with artificial neural networks [33] have been used to quickly find the source location in a building through both CFD and multizone methods. Although optimization methods can be a powerful tool, designing a proper cost function that enables quick and smooth minimization is not always easy. Furthermore, these methods usually involve solving the contaminant advection-diffusion PDE. Finally, optimization methods are inherently iterative, and may require solving a large number of simulations to find the optimal locations. This iterative process can be computationally intensive. Optimization methods are also dependent on a set of release scenarios that are designed based on the space geometry and sensor application. The bottleneck for both optimization and inverse methods is the necessity of solving a partial differential equation for contaminant transport for numerous scenarios and multiple iterations. In this context, recent work on reformulating the contaminant transport problem as a dynamical system opens up powerful, computationally cheap, and fast methods for predicting contaminant transport and contaminant evolution in the indoor environment. Such a formulation also allows novel developments in control theory to be applied for identifying sensor locations for multizone and CFD airflow simulations. Furthermore, such a formulation can leverage the impressive body of work on sensor placement, which is a classical problem in dynamical systems and state space systems. For instance, the continuous form of the Perron-Frobenius (PF) operator has been effectively used to determine where density (of, say, contaminants) gathers under the effect of non-linear vector fields [34] . More recently, the discrete finite dimensional form of the PF operator, which takes the form of a Markov Matrix, has been used to identify optimal sensing locations [35, 36] . Utilizing the finite dimensional PF operator has been shown to be a simple way to calculating real-time contaminant transport in buildings [37] . Additionally, such analysis also provides insight into the age of the air and where contaminants spend the most time [38] . The critical advantage of this method is that the finite dimensional PF operator method is relatively computationally inexpensive, as they do not require solving the (direct or adjoint) advection-diffusion PDE or minimization of a complicated cost function. This paper is built upon previous work [35, 37] , of utilizing a dynamical systems approach to indoor air analysis. The main idea is determining sensor locations from velocity vector fields (acquired from analytical methods, CFD, particle imaging velocimetry, etc.). We leverage the finite dimensional PF operator framework and showcase a sensor placement algorithm that is very easy to solve. This algorithm naturally accounts for complex geometries, constraints in sensor placement, as well as sensing constraints. We illustrate the capabilities of this framework by comparing results with established recommendations from published literature. The sensor placement strategy for a given building zone is investigated for both IAQ and CBW applications. This approach is a data driven method that maximizes the sensing volume by taking into account the number of sensors and the response time for a given accuracy of the sensors. The method described in this paper has the potential to provide designers, engineers, and architects with not only the sensor locations and sensor coverage for deployed wireless sensors, but also the framework for classical estimator problems and real time contaminant transport. The outline of rest of the paper is as follows. Some mathematical preliminaries are discussed followed by the sensor placement algorithm. Then sensor placement constraints and sensing constraints are introduced into the sensor placement algorithm. The placement strategy is compared with published recommendations in an aircraft cabin. Finally, multiple sensors are placed for a building zone using a CFD datasets with applications in IAQ and CBW.
