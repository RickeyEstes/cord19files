ROC analysis of both FMIA and ELISA was performed using MedCalc software to calculate an optimized cutoff value that maximizes the DSe and DSp of each assay. Using known seronegative and seropositive serum samples (n = 940), the expected positive samples used were submitted as field serum (Fig. 4) . The similar cutoff values of both assays confirm the utility of these new diagnostic tests to aid in the control and surveillance of PDCoV outbreaks.
