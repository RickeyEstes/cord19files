Under the purview of the Korean Kawasaki Disease Study Group, a nationwide survey was carried out to identify the incidence of KD in South Korea concerning acute KD patients who were hospitalized between January 2009 and December 2011. To determine the incidence of KD, questionnaires were sent to 100 hospitals which have pediatric residency programs. Of the 100 hospitals surveyed, 87 responded. The incidence of KD per month was tallied from January 2009 to December 2011. Over the same time period, respiratory viral data of patients with acute respiratory symptoms was obtained from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Laboratory of Respiratory Viruses at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has operated the Korea Influenza and Respiratory Viruses Surveillance System since 2009. Respiratory viral detection data are reported weekly. Respiratory specimens from patients with acute respiratory symptoms from 91 primary and secondary medical institutions from around the country were analyzed using a multiplex real-time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit. 12) Viral detection data from the reports collected between January 2009 and December 2011 were analyzed by month. The viruses detected were as follows: influenza virus (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, A/H5N1, and B), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus (type 1, 2, and 3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV type A, B), human rhinovirus, human coronavirus (OC43/229E, NL63), human bocavirus, and enterovirus. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital, and informed consent was waived because of the retrospective nature of this study.
