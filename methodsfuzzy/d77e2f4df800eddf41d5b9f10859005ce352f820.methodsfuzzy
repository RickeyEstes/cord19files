Medical and pediatric services In China, most people receive medical technology and specialized neurological care provided by public hospitals. In general, patients who are suspected of having ADEM are taken to the hospital as emergencies, and soon after, a neurologist will be invited to take care of them. Patients younger than 16 years old who are affected by neurological diseases are usually taken to pediatric hospitals. Study population ADEM cases were selected from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2011. The surveyed areas were Nanjing, Nantong, Yancheng and Xuzhou, which are four cities in Jiangsu province in China. Both urban and rural populations were involved in each city. Gender-specific and age-specific population numbers from 2008 to 2011 were from the local Bureau of Statistics. The population denominator ruled out the migratory labor population, which does not officially reside in these cities. The populations involved in this research and the geographical locations of the four cities are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 .
