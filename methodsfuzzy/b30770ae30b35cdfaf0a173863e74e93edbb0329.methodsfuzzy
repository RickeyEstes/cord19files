We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the ICU of Fukuoka University Hospital from April 2013 to September 2014. The occurrence of infections or colonization with ESBL-E, the antimicrobial use density (AUD) values, and the clinical outcome were investigated for the described periods, and those parameters were compared between April-December 2013 (phase 1) and January-September 2014 (phase 2). Moreover, we routinely performed stool cultures for ESBL-E in phase 2. Results: Of the 1,245 patients who were admitted to our ICU during the study period, we identified 670 patients (phase 1) and 575 patients (phase 2) respectively. The rates of patients either infected or colonized with ESBL-E were significantly higher in phase 2 than phase 1 ( Introduction: ESBL and carbapenemase producing gram-negative pathogens pose a major therapeutic challenge to the healthcare providers, both in hospital and in the community. Morbidity, mortality and the cost of health care delivery are all increased by the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, it becomes important to have a good knowledge of local microbial spectrum and sensitivity profile, so appropriate prophylactic antibiotics could be administered. This retrospective review was conducted to assess the prevalence of both ESBL and carbapenemase producers among the uropathogens in a newly opened tertiary care hospital in Chennai, India. Methods: We retrospectively analysed the urine culture reports in our hospital over a one-year period, from Sep 2014 to Oct 2015. Data on the total requests and samples received, number of samples tested positive, organisms isolated and their sensitivity pattern were all collected. Results: During this period, the microbiology lab received a total of 1991 urine samples, 77 % (1533) from outpatients and 23 % (458) from inpatients. 18 % of the total samples received (358/1991) were culture positive (19 % in outpatients and 13 % in in-patients). 21 % of the outpatient and 63 % of the inpatient isolates were ESBL producers. E coli and Klebsiella were the commonest organisms isolated (290/358; 81 %). 92 % of the in-hospital and 73 % of the outpatient ESBL isolate was E. coli. 5 % of the in-hospital isolates were carbapenemase producers. Conclusions: The incidence of ESBL and carbapenemase production among in-hospital uropathogens is very high at 63 % and 5 % respectively. This confirms the global increase in the incidence of ESBLs and carbapenemases. Although carbapenemase production in the community is only 0.6 %, sepsis caused by these isolates is very difficult to treat with high mortality rates. Appropriate antibiotic use, following a deescalation strategy and good antimicrobial stewardship are very important in improving outcomes and preventing the spread of further resistance. Instead of following the general antibiotic guidelines, developing robust local guidelines based on the microbiological data on antibiotic sensitivity of the organisms to guide prophylaxis will be helpful in achieving high rates of clinical cure. Reference Introduction: Here, we determined whether the Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) class 2 integron is in the soil around our hospital, and if the soil is the cause for increasing numbers of A. baumannii infections in our intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A. baumannii has emerged globally as a significant pathogen in hospitals. It is also present in soil and water. In a previous study, we discovered that the A. baumannii class 2 integron occurred most frequently. This cross-sectional prospective study was conducted in two ICUs at Loghman-Hakim Hospital, Tehran, Iran, from November 2012 to March 2013. Patient, soil, and hospital environment samples were collected. All isolates were identified using standard bacteriologic and biochemical methods. The phenotypes and genotypes were characterized. The standard disc diffusion method was utilized to test antimicrobial susceptibility. Integron identification was performed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results: There were no A. baumannii bacteria isolated from the hospital environment or soil, although the bacterium was detected around the lip of one patient. Also, a total of 42 A. baumannii clinical strains were isolated from the lower respiratory tract (n = 20), blood (n = 6), urine (n = 8), and wound catheters and nasal swabs (n = 8). 65 % of the isolated species were classified as class 2 integrons. The strains were 100 % resistant to piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cotrimoxazole, cefepime, ceropenem, and cefotaxime. However, all of the strains were sensitive to polymyxin B Conclusions: Further research is necessary to establish a relationship between A. baumannii and soil, (especially in re¬gards to its bioremediation), as well as to determine its importance in nosocomial infections and outbreaks in the ICU. Introduction: Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Bacteria are a worldwide threat especially for intensive care unit's patients (ICU). In Gram Negative Bacilli, the emergence and spread of Extended-spectrum Beta-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase-producing bacteria (CPB) is one of the common causes of morbidity and mortality associated with ICU-acquired infections (ICU AI). The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiology and risk factors for ESBL and CPB infections as well as the resistance patterns of these bacteria isolated in a Tunisian multidisciplinary intensive care unit. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, case-control study including all patients admitted between January and October 2015. ICU AI were defined as those acquired no less than 48 h after ICU admission. We did not include patients with no bacteriological evidence of infection. Differences in ICU mortality, length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) were tested across patients with and without ICU acquired MDR bacteria infections. We also assessed infected sites, most frequent bacteria for each group (ESBL and CPB), and looked for risk factors. Results: In the study period, 184 patients were admitted to the ICU, 67 (34,41 %) had ICU AI. From these 67 patients, 35 had an ESBL infection in 53 isolates, and 21 patients were infected with CPB isolated from 30 cultures. Global mortality in the study period was 44,59 %, the mortality associated to MDR infection was 51,16 %. In fact, mortality of ESBL infections was not so higher than the global one (48,57 %) whereas CPB infection weighed down mortality to reach 71,43 %. In the same way, length of stay was significantly longer in MDR infected patients (18,37 days ± 11.6 STD) than non-MDR infected ones (8,66 ± 4.60 STD, p < 0,001). MV duration was respectively 15,85 days (±12,51 STD) in MDR group and 6,62 days (±5,10 STD, p < 0,001) in the non-MDR infected group. Length of stay and duration of MV were found to be risk factors for acquiring MDR infection in ICU. Ventilator associated pneumonia was the most frequent acquired infection as well in non MDR infected patients as in both ESBL and CPB. Acinetobacter Baumannii was the leading isolate from CPB infection (60 %) followed by Klebsiella Pneumoniae (27 %). Concerning bacilli producing ESBL, Klebsiella Pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated (54,72 %) followed by Escherichia Coli and Enterobacter Cloacae (15,09 % each). Conclusions: The prevalence of ESBL and CPB is increasing day by day in nearly every center of different countries and is responsible for large number of hospital-acquired and nosocomial infections, with very few, if any, therapeutic options. Necessary steps to prevent the spread and emergence of resistance should be taken. The mortality rate was 13 % (n = 4). We found a statistical significant association between the SAPS II score and mortality: higher scores are linked to death (Mann Whitney U test). We also found association between higher leukocyte count and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) at admission with death (Mann Whitney U test). We did not find association between any other analytical abnormality at admission and at death. We also did not find any bad outcome association with patients' symptoms, physical examination abnormalities, renal or ventilation support (Person's Qui Squared Test). We report a unique case of extreme hypernatremia of 196 mmol/L and severe sepsis in a young 39-year-old adult with Huntington's dementia, which presented a challenge in fluid management. Results: The hypernatraemia was thought to be caused by chronic severe dehydration from poor intake and the sepsis was thought to have started as an inadequately treated urinary tract infection. The patient was initially treated aggressively with hypotonic saline and intravenous antibiotics, but was subsequently managed using a slower correction rate after identifying the chronic nature of the natremia. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of extreme hypernatremia and severe sepsis manifesting concomitantly in such a young patient. Conclusions: We highlight the difficulties of balancing the risks and benefits of rapid versus slow fluid resuscitation in such complex clinical situations. We highlight the difficulty of balancing the risks and benefits of rapid fluid resuscitation, necessitated by severe sepsis and acute kidney injury, against the complexities of fluid resuscitation in correcting such an extreme hypernatremia. We advocate early identification of chronic hypernatremia and effective administration of intravenous fluids in the Emergency Department that is decided on a case-by-case basis. In cases of severe and extreme hypernatraemia in particular, accurate calculation of free water deficit is essential to manage the patient effectively. In line with this, we must ensure that such patients are always weighed on admission. Introductions: HAGMA is a commonly encountered acid-base disorder in clinic practice. Multiple mnemonics were proposed to cover the common underlying causes -"GOLDMARK(1)", "KUSMALE", "KAR-MEL" and, of course, "MUDPILES". The "I" in "MUDPILES" represents some rare causes of HAGMA including "I"ron, "I"soniazid and "I"nborn errors of metabolism. We present a rare case of HAGMA secondary to isoniazid (INH) overdose. Methods: A 41 year old male was intubated for status epilepticus. He had a medical history of pulmonary tuberculosis (pTB) and had been treated with a course of rifampicin, INH and ethambutol since 6 months ago. Results: Arterial blood gas in the Emergency Department showed severe metabolic and respiratory acidosis; pH 6.76, pCO2 80, pO2 62, HCO3 11, BE -24. The initial anion gap was 26. Physical examination was unremarkable except for fever and hypotension. Neurological examination did not reveal any lateralising signs. CT scan of the brain was normal. Mild renal impairment, and lactate acidosis resolved rapidly with initial fluid resuscitation. Serum and urine toxicology for commonly encountered drugs were also negative. Patient regained orientation on day 3 of intubation and was promptly extubated. Further history revealed that he had consumed a bottle of isoniazid tablets after an altercation with his wife the same night. Conclusions: Tuberculosis is endemic is South East Asia. INH is one of the four drugs used in the treatment of this disease. Side effects of isoniazid range from mild hepatotoxicity to the potentially fatal INH hepatitis. HAGMA refractory to conventional therapy is one of the hallmarks of INH toxicity. Though it is one of the rare causes of HAGMA, prompt diagnosis and treatment with high dose pyridoxine (2) reduces mortality and morbidity. Introductions: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is independently associated with increased mortality in the critically ill, especially when renal replacement therapy (RRT) is required. "Early initiation" of RRT and its possible beneficial effect on mortality, has been the focus of many research protocols. However, published papers show no uniformity in the definition of early initiation. The main problem to determine this best moment of initiation is the lack of a distinctive parameter that can predict RRT requirement. The question rises if differences between patients with any stage of AKI and patients with RRT-requiring AKIN stage III can be identified looking at the "classical parameters" (serum creatinine (SCr), urea, potassium, bicarbonate, pH, cumulative fluid balance), plasma Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (pNGAL) and urinary output (UO) at the time of first rise in SCr (first AKI). Methods: This is a retrospective subset-analysis performed on the NGAL-study database [1] in adult critically ill patients with developing AKI. Data were collected and analyzed at the time of first AKI and at the highest level of serum creatinine (peak AKI). Mann-Whitney-U test was used to detect differences between both groups. Results: A total of 59 patients developed any stage of AKI during the first 7 days after ICU admission, 15 patients required RRT eventually. At the time of first AKI, pNGAL and UO were the only parameters that differed significantly (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04 respectively) between the two groups. The "classical parameters" showed a significant difference between groups later on at the time of peak AKI (=time of RRT initiation) (Fig. 37) . Conclusions: Critically ill patients with RRT requiring AKI have a significant lower urinary production and significant higher pNGAL concentration compared to patients with non-RRT requiring AKI at the time of first rise in SCr. The "classical parameters" fail to make this distinction at this very early stage of AKI. Therefore, plasma NGAL and UO might have the potential (perhaps in combination with the Furosemide stress test) to become valuable parameters in future prospective protocols that intend to study the value of early RRT initiation on hard outcome measures in critically ill patients. Introductions: The choice for the right renal replacement therapy (RRT) for severe acute kidney injury in critically ill patients has been investigated many times in the last two decades. Although some questions have been answered, in current practice many different approaches are still used in the ICU. The authors review the treatment of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in critically ill patients, indications for SLED and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in critically ill patients in four Portuguese ICUs. Methods: Prospective observational study conducted in 4 ICUs in 3 Portuguese hospitals for seven months. All patients with AKI who needed a renal replacement therapy were enrolled. Data on demographics and clinical characteristics of patients were collected at baseline. Results: 127 patients were enrolled, with an average age of 61,3 ± 15,26, and mortality rate was 46 %. 42 patients performed SLED (33,07 %), and 85 % performed CRRT (63,97 %). The most common indications for CRRT was fluid overload (47,76 %). Most of the patients start the both procedures in the first two days in ICU. Most of the patients (59 Ð 60 %) were in organ failure, using the RIFLE criteria when they started RRT. Patients in CRRT were more hemodynamically unstable (norepinephrine in CRRT Ð 1,99 ± 5,36 and in SLED -1,49 ± 4,56). Mortality rate Ð 52,94 % in CRRT and 30,95 in SLED. Conclusions: CRRT seems to be the ideal mode of renal replacement therapy for hemodynamically unstable with fluid overloaded. However, in expert hands, the two treatments provide similar outcomes and can be complementary. We wished to evaluate current practice in the region and consider the need for regional guidance on the management of acute kidney injury in our units. Methods: An electronic survey was sent to all the consultants in intensive care within the region. Responses were anonymously collecting using internet-based survey software. Questions were based upon the currently available guidance and evidence. Results: Invitations were sent to 139 consultants who have some intensive care commitment. There were 55 responses giving a response rate of 39.6 %. Unit size varied greatly, from under 10 beds, to over 20. The majority (43.6 %) had between 10 and 20 beds. 46.3 % of respondents had less than 10 patients receiving RRT per month, 40.7 % had between 10 and 25 patients per month and 13 % had more than 25 patients per month. 43 % gave positive comments regarding the support they receive from renal services. Some areas where interactions between renal physicians and critical care could be improved were identified. Only 67 % of respondents were aware of an up to date guideline for the use of RRT in their unit. 1.9 % of respondents preferentially use the subclavian vein for siting renal access lines. 9.3 % preferentially used the femoral veins. 31 % never have visits from a nephrologist. Conclusions: There is a wide variety in practice, with some areas where practices could be improved , notably awareness of guidelines available, choice of renal access line site, and working relationships between renal and critical care. As part of a quality improvement programme, we plan to create a regional best practice recommendations document that is relevant to the systems in which we work and specific to critical care. By doing this, we hope to improve outcomes for those receiving renal replacement therapy in our units. Introductions: Acute kidney injury necessitating continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in critically ill patients is associated with high mortality. Timing of CRRT remains a matter of debate. We investigated the effect of timing of CRRT on 28-day mortality. Methods: A post-hoc analysis is performed on the multicenter data from the earlier published CASH study. In critically ill patients receiving CRRT, between 2005 and 2011, the effect of variables at initiation of CRRT on 28-day mortality were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis were performed to determine renal and patient-specific variables associated with 28-day mortality. Results: Of the 139 patients evaluated for inclusion, 13 patients were excluded because of a history of chronic kidney disease, 5 patients were excluded because no creatinine at CRRT initiation was available, and 5 patients were excluded because an admission creatinine below 50 μmol/L. In the 116 included patients, 28-day mortality was 37 (32 %). In univariate proportional hazards cox regression analysis, ICU admission after cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( HR 4.403, p = 0.043), SOFA score ( HR 1.117, p = 0.024) and creatinine at CRRT initiation (HR 0.997, p = 0.020) were associated with 28-day mortality. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age (HR 1.092, p = 0.050), admission weight ( HR 1.036, p = 0.016) ICU admission because of respiratory failure (HR 9.275, p = 0.29) and creatinine at CRRT initiation (HR 0.990, p = 0.022) were associated with 28-day mortality. After correction for disease severity scores, such as APACHE 2 score and SOFA score, and markers for fluid overload, such as hematocrit and cumulative fluid balance, creatinine at initiation remained associated with lower 28mortality. Even after correction for admission creatinine, only creatinine at initiation remained associated with 28-day mortality. In ROC curve analysis a CRRT initiation creatinin of 318 μmol/L was the best predictor for 28-day mortality. Conclusions: In this multicenter cohort, creatinine at CRRT initiation is an independent predictor of 28-day mortality, even after correction for admission creatinine, disease severity and hemodilution. Therefore these data argue in favour of a time-dependent effect of CRRT on 28day mortality. These data suggest that late CRRT initiation may have better outcome then earlier CRRT initiation. However further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis and reveal underlying mechanisms. We conducted a retrospective study in a medical ICU in a tertiary care hospital that doesn't have a step-down unit. A two intensivists team followed up daily the patients discharged with tracheostomy from the ICU to the general ward until they were discharged from the hospital. Training sessions to the ward,s staff (doctors, nurses and nursing assistants) were made about tracheostomy cares every week. We analized clinical and epidemiologic variables, time to decannulation, complications related to the tracheostomy, decannulation failures, readmissions and mortality. Results: From February 2012 to October 2015, a total of 2568 patients were admitted to our ICU; during this period, 100 patients were discharged to the regular ward with tracheostomy tube in place. Of these, 68 % had neurological damages (due to head injury, ischemic and hemorrhagic events), 14 % chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 8 % severe miopathy, 6 % postanoxic encephalopathy, 2 % Guillain Barre and 2 % amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 10 % of the patients with a high length of stay had complications because of the tracheostomy (tracheal stenosis, granuloma and malacia), and all of them were solved. There were 2 readmissions to the ICU due to cannula obstruction. Decannulation at the ward was possible in 36 % of the patients, none of them had to be recannulated and all survived. Global mortality was 23 %, but excluding the patients under palliative cares, the mortality decreased to 5 % and the causes of death were not directly related to the tracheostomy. Conclusions: In hospitals without a step-down unit and a high healthcare demand the monitoring of the tracheostomized patients by a skilled team let to decannulate the patients at the ward with safety. It would allow discharge sooner this kind of patients from the ICU and therefore decrease the length of stay, the complications associated to the ICU admission and accordingly the costs. On the other hand, once at the ward, the team can detect early the complications, solve them and create a safety atmosphere for the patient, the family and the staff in charge. In the 2nd group, our study revealed the following complications: complication of subcutaneous emphysema -6 cs (17.1 %), but pneumomediastinum -2 cs (5.7 %), lobar emphysema -1 cs (2.8 %), suppurations -2 cs (5.7 %), situations that were resolved. All children received a special critical care under the Protocol of pneumonia prophylaxis associated with artificial ventilation: gentle suctioning of secretions with closed suction systems after cuffinflation. Placing on 30°and oral hygiene for 2-3 times/day being mandatory for each one. Also, a daily hydroelectrolitic rebalancing, calculation of individual energy need and symptomatic therapy was performed. Along with the improvement of general condition, appearance or improvement of the deglutition reflex, the oral nutrition with semi-solid preparations recommenced in 5 children (22.5 %) from the first day of tracheostomy application, in 7 cs the nutrition recommenced on 3-5 day together with partial parenteral nutrition until the full resumption of oral nutrition. It is worth noticing also the significant decrease in length of stay on artificial respiration in the 2ndgroup of children (22 ± 0.9 days) compared to the 1stgroup (37 ± 1.7 days). Despite the complex therapeutic effort, due to severity of basic disease in the 1 group 15 (24.5 %) children died and in the 2nd group 3 children (8.5 %) died. Conclusions: 1.The application of tracheotomy in patients with endotracheal intubation and prolonged artificial ventilation reduces the infant mortality rate. 2. In the 2 group we have noticed the decrease of the duration of treatment, which leads to a reduction in the prime cost of the child treated in the intensive care unit.
