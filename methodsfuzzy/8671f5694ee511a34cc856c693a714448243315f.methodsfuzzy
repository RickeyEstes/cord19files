2.1. Plant material and growth conditions L. japonica plants were grown in different fields of Pingyi cultivation base (Shandong, China) under controlled conditions. L. japonica flowers presented different developmental stages (JBS, TGS, CWS, SFS, and GFS) on same plant during late May. Flowers in the 5 developmental stages were collected respectively. Flowers of same developmental stage from at least ten plants were mixed as one biological replicate. Three and six independent experiments were performed as biological replicates for transcriptomic/proteomic and metabolomic experiments, respectively. Collected plant materials were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for the further analysis.
