Our investigations on the seven sperm whales (labeled from no. 1 to no. 7; no. 5, 6 and 7 stranded alive) were performed to evaluate the current hypotheses on the causes of sperm whale mass strandings considering also the impact of human activities in the area. The huge size of the animals, the distance between each individual (whales no. 1 and no. 7 were separated by 3.8 km), the weather conditions and the necessity to establish a safe and healthy working setting, forbade full autopsy of all the seven whales. Before their postmortem examinations, all the 7 animals were measured and the total length was used to estimate weight according to formulas specific for sperm whales [1] . During their disposal, the carcasses and the remains were individually weighted to obtain a ''corrected'' weight, which considers fluids and tissues lost during postmortem and disposal procedures. As stated above, a detailed postmortem investigation was carried out on three sperm whales. Careful external and gastric inspections were also performed on the bodies of the other four animals. During the three full necropsies, a complete sampling of all organs and tissues was performed by the Necropsy Unit for later microscopic examinations (i.e. histopathology, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural investigations were performed on tissues fixed by immersion in aldehydes), as well as virological, microbiological, and biomolecular investigations for Toxoplasma gondii (genomic DNA was extracted from mesenteric, prescapular, and pancreatic lymph nodes, liver and brainstem of whale no. 6, and from prescapular and mesenteric lymph nodes and liver of animal no. 7). Specific searches were started for biotoxins (frozen samples of livers of animals no. 5, 6 and 7 and brainstem of animal no. 6), gas and fat emboli (veins were screened grossly looking for gas emboli and gas bubbles were collected by vacutainerH tubes from the coronary veins; lung tissues fixed in formalin were used to investigate the presence of lipid droplets) and contaminants (performed on frozen livers and kidneys of whales no. 5, 6 and 7). Additionally, extensive samplings were performed on all the seven animals for age determination (two teeth for each animal), genetic analyses (skin preserved in DMSO and frozen), stable isotope analyses (performed on frozen skin, blubber, liver and muscle), and toxicology (carried out on frozen muscular and adipose tissue samples from the animals of the entire pod). Gastric contents were collected during opening of the stomach complexes: the three components (organic, inorganic, parasites) were separated, weighed and later examined. All the aforementioned biological samples were collected and stored in the Mediterranean Marine Mammals Tissue Bank of the University of Padua, to be subsequently distributed to all other partner Institutions involved in the present study for all further investigations. A more detailed explanation of the laboratory analyses performed on the seven stranded whales is provided below.
