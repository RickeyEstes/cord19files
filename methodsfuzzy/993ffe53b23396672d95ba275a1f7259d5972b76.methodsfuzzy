Methods to derive general models of surface glycoproteins have been described previously (Gallaher et al., 1989) . Domains with high interfacial hydrophobicity were identified with Membrane Protein eXplorer (MPeX; Stephen White laboratory; http://blanco.biomol.uci.edu/mpex). MPeX detection of membrane spanning sequences is based on experimentally determined hydrophobicity scales (White and Wimley, 1999; Wimley and White, 1996) .
