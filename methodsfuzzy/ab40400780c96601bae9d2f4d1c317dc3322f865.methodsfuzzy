Virus growth and purification. The TBE virus prototype strain Neudoerfl was grown in primary chicken embryo cells, harvested 48 h after infection, and purified by two cycles of sucrose density gradient centrifugation [59] . For membrane fusion assays, virions were metabolically labeled with 1-pyrenehexadecanoic acid as described previously [51] . Liposomes. For the preparation of liposomes, phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, http://www.avantilipids.com), phosphatidylethanolamine (Avanti Polar Lipids), and cholesterol (Sigma Chemical Co., http://www.sigmaaldrich.com) were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1:2 from stock solutions in chloroform [60] . The mixture was dried to a thin film in high vacuum for at least 1.5 h. The lipid film was hydrated in liposome buffer (10 mM triethanolamine, 140 mM NaCl [pH 8.0]) and subjected to five cycles of freeze-thawing, followed by 21 cycles of extrusion through two polycarbonate membranes with a pore size of 200 nm using a Liposofast syringe-type extruder (Avestin, http://www. avestin.com). Sedimentation analysis. The oligomeric state of E after the exposure of virions to different pHs was determined by sedimentation analysis in sucrose gradients as described previously [40, 60] . Purified virions (3 to 5 lg) in TAN buffer were incubated for 10 min at 37 8C at pH 10.0, 8.0, or 5.4 and solubilized with 1% Triton-X 100. For some experiments, pH 10.0-pretreated samples were backneutralized to pH 8.0 or acidified to pH 5.4 before solubilization. The samples were then applied to 7% to 20% sucrose gradients (w/w) in the respective buffer containing 0.1% Triton-X 100 and were centrifuged for 20 h in an SW 40 rotor (Beckman Coulter, http://www. beckmancoulter.com) at 38,000 rpm and 15 8C. Fractions were collected by upward displacement, and the amount of E in each fraction was determined by four-layer ELISA after denaturation with 0.4% SDS at 65 8C [61] . Chemical cross-linking analysis. Purified virus preparations at a concentration of 9 lg/ml were cross-linked with dimethyl suberimidate (DMS; Pierce Biotechnology, http://www.piercenet.com) at pH 8.0 and pH 10.0 with or without pH 5.4 pretreatment for 10 min at 37 8C. DMS was added to final concentrations of 1.2 mM and 0.6 mM at pH 8.0 and (because of the higher efficiency of cross-linking) 0.6 mM and 0.2 mM at pH 10.0. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of ethanolamine to the same final molar concentrations as DMS. The crosslinked virions were then concentrated by pelleting in a Ti90 rotor (Beckman) at 50,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 8C. The pellets were resuspended, solubilized in SDS-containing sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE using 5% polyacrylamide gels according to Maizel [62] . Staining was performed with Coomassie blue R-250. Coflotation of virions with liposomes. Virions were mixed with liposomes at a ratio of 1 lg of virus to 100 nmol of lipid. The virusliposome mixture was incubated for 10 min at a virus concentration of 45 lg/ml and 37 8C at alkaline pH (pH 9.0, 9.5, 10.0, and 10.5) and adjusted to 20% (w/w) sucrose in CAPS buffer (50 mM CAPS, 100 mM NaCl) at the corresponding pH in a final volume of 2 ml as described previously [39] . For controls, the virions were incubated in the presence of liposomes at pH 5.4 (positive control) or pH 8.0 (negative control). The 2-ml virus-liposome mixture was then applied to a 50% cushion and overlaid with 1 ml of 5% (w/w) sucrose. Centrifugation was carried out for 1.5 h at 50,000 rpm at 4 8C in a Beckman SW 55 rotor, and fractions were collected by upward displacement. The amount of E protein in each fraction was determined by a quantitative four-layer ELISA as described above. For the inhibition of coflotation by monoclonal antibodies, virions (final protein concentration 37.5 lg/ml) were incubated with purified E protein-specific monoclonal antibodies (final protein concentration 225 lg/ml) at 25 8C for 30 min at pH 8.0 or pH 10.0 before the addition of liposomes. Electron microscopy. Purified virions (80 lg/ml) at pH 10.0, 5.4, or 8.0-in the presence or absence of liposomes-were fixed with formalin (final dilution 1:2,000) for 24 h at 37 8C. A drop of the virus or virus-liposome suspensions was deposited on an air-glow discharged carbon-coated grid. The drop was blotted with filter paper, and the grid was washed with a 2% phosphotungstic acid solution adjusted to pH 6.0 (sample acidic pH) or 8.0 (samples at pH 8.0 and 10.0). The grids were observed in a CM12 electron microscope (Philips, http://www.philips.nl) operated at 80 kV, and the micrographs were recorded on Kodak SO163 image plates developed for 5 min in D19. Fusion assay. Fusion of pyrene-labeled virions with liposomes was measured by monitoring the decrease in pyrene excimer fluorescence caused by the dilution of pyrene-labeled phospholipids in the viral membrane into the unlabeled liposome membrane [51, 60] . Fluorescence was recorded continuously for 60 s at 480 nm using a Perkin Elmer (http://www.perkinelmer.com) LS 50B Fluorescence Spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 343 nm. Pyrene-labeled virions (0.5 to 1 lM) were mixed with 0.3 mM liposomes at pH 8.0 in a continuously stirred fluorimeter cuvette at 37 8C, and different pH values were adjusted by the addition of 150 mM CAPS (alkaline pH) and 300 or 600 mM MES (acidic pH). The initial excimer fluorescence after mixing was defined as 0% fusion. To determine the residual excimer fluorescence at infinite dilution of the probe (defined as 100% fusion for calculating the fusion extents), the detergent nocta(ethylene glycol)-n-dodecyl monoether was added to a final concentration of 10 mM to disperse the viral and liposomal membranes. For the inhibition of fusion by monoclonal antibody pyrenelabeled virions (final protein concentration 37.5 lg/ml) were incubated with purified E protein-specific monoclonal antibodies (final protein concentration 225 lg/ml) at 25 8C for 30 min at pH 10.0 before the addition of liposomes.
