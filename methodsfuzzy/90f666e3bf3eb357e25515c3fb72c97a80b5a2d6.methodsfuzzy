The robustness of the methods was calculated using the results obtained from the analysis of quality control samples. Nine laboratories participated in the trial of the methods for analysis of fresh waters and six laboratories participated in the trial of the methods for analysis of marine samples. Test samples comprised 1 mL aliquots of adenovirus Type 2 (containing 200 pfu of virus), and norovirus GII.4 which were added by the participants to their own water samples. A batch of adenovirus Type 2 and a batch of norovirus GII.4 were prepared, distributed into single-use ampoules and sent to each participant. On each sampling occasion 1 mL of the adenovirus Type 2 and 1 mL of the norovirus-positive control material were added to a separate 10-L quality control sample of the recreational water being tested. Negative samples were prepared from a mixture of de-ionised and tap water, or artificial seawater. Each participant analysed at least 25 sets of quality control samples. The raw data sent by each laboratory were statistically analysed according to the recommendations of Scotter et al. (2001) by the methods of Langton et al. (2002) . The trial sensitivity was defined as the percentage of positive samples giving a correct positive signal, and trial specificity was defined as the percentage of negative samples giving a correct negative signal. Accordance (repeatability of qualitative data) was defined as the percentage chance of finding the same result, positive or negative, from two identical samples analysed in the same laboratory under predefined repeatability conditions, and concordance (reproducibility of qualitative data) was defined as the percentage chance of finding the same result, positive or negative, from two identical samples analysed in different laboratories under predefined repeatability conditions. These calculations take into account different replication in different laboratories by weighting results appropriately. The concordance odds ratio (COR) was the degree of inter-laboratory variation in the results, and expressed as the ratio between accordance and concordance percentages (Langton et al., 2002) . The COR value may be interpreted as the likelihood of getting the same result from two identical samples, whether they are sent to the same laboratory or to two different laboratories. The closer the value is to 1.0, the higher is the likelihood of getting the same result. Confidence intervals for accordance, concordance and COR were calculated by the method of Davison and Hinckley (1997) ; each laboratory was considered representative of all laboratories in the "population" of laboratories, not just those participating in this analysis. The results of the robustness calculations of the virus/water detection methods are shown in Table 3 . With the adenovirus/ freshwater method the trial sensitivity, or percentage of correctly identified positive samples, was 77.2%, and the concordance was lower than the accordance. A value of 1.0 lies just outside the COR 95% confidence intervals (CI), indicating that the method was not quite as reproducible as repeatable. The trial specificity, or percentage of correctly identified negative samples, was 96.1%, and 1.0 fell within the COR 95% CI, indicating that with identification of negative samples the method was as reproducible as it was repeatable. With the adenovirus/seawater method the trial sensitivity was 89.3%, and the concordance was lower than the accordance. Again, 1.0 lies just outside the COR 95% confidence intervals (CI). The trial specificity was 99.2%, and 1.0 fell within the COR 95% CI. With the norovirus/freshwater method the trial sensitivity was 91.4%, and the concordance was lower than the accordance, 1.0 lying just outside the COR 95% confidence intervals (CI). The trial specificity was 96.1%, and 1.0 fell within the COR 95% CI. With the norovirus/seawater method the trial sensitivity was 91.7%, and 1.0 fell within the COR 95% CI. The trial specificity was 92.6%, and 1.0 fell within the COR 95% CI.
