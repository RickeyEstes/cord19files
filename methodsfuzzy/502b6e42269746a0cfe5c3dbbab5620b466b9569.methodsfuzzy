The stored aliquots of the PEDV virus culture were titrated by the TCID 50 method three times, in duplicate, to obtain a total of 6 readings. The assay was set up by the standard method (Schumacher et al., 2016) using logarithmic dilutions of the culture ranging from -1 to -8, in 96 well plates. Six wells were used for each dilution. The process for virus culture was essentially as described above, except 96 well plates were used and 100 Î¼l of each log dilution was plated per well. Cell controls incubated with growth media to rule out any other causes of toxicity and undiluted virus controls were included in each plate. The presence of CPE in each well was scored by visual microscopic examination, by two independent operators and titers calculated by the Spearman and Karber method (Ramakrishnan, 2016) .
