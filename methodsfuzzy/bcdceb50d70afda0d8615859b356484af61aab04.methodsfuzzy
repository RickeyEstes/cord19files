As expected, the typical ladder-like pattern products were only obtained in the assay using PCV2 genomic DNA samples as templates ( Figure 2 ). In addition, the other virus species had no amplified products as well as the NTC (no template control). Figure 2 shows that the primers only amplified PCV2 strains and not other viruses. The sequencing results indicated that the amplified product length of two stains of PCV2 was 223 bp. The sequences showed 100% homology with the ORF2 gene of PCV2. The specificity of the LMAP product was confirmed by digestion of HaeIII. A predictable product of the 137-bp motif was resolved on the agarose gel as expected ( Figure 3 , lane 2). Comparative analysis of the sensitivity of PCV2 detection by the LAMP method and PCR was carried out using a dilution series of PCV2 DNA templates. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was 10 copies, which corresponded to 10 copies of DNA templates per reaction tube. The detection limit for the PCR was 1000 copies, which corresponded to 1000 copies of DNA templates per reaction tube. This suggested that the LAMP assay was 100-fold more sensitive than the conventional PCR (Figure 4 and Figure 5 ). To establish the specificity of the LAMP detection method for PCV2, the DNA (PCV2, PCV1, PPV and PRV) and cDNA (PEDVD, TGEV, RV and PRRSV) were used as sample templates to initiate the reaction under the optimal conditions. Negative controls were included. The amplified products were digested with HaeIII to confirm the reaction specificity, meanwhile, the headmost band of the products was sequenced by Shanghai Bioengineering Co. Ltd.
