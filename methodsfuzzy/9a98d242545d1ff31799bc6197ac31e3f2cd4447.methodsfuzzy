Cells and Xrn1 knockdown HEK293T, HEK293T shXrn1 and KSHV-infected iSLK-219 [36] and iSLK-219 shXrn1 cells were maintained in high-glucose DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). shXrn1 cells were generated using pTRIPZ-shXrn1 (Thermoscientific, clone V2THS_89028/RHS4696-99704634, targeting sequence: TATGGTGAGATATACTATG). To induce expression of the shXrn1, cells were treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Fisher) for 4-5 days prior to harvesting. Lytic induction of KSHV was induced in iSLK-219 cells [36] by treating cells with 1 μg/ml doxycycline and 1 mM sodium butyrate for 4-5 days prior to harvesting. The same induction also led to anti-Xrn1 shRNA expression in the iSLK-219 shXrn1 cells. For the second biological repeat of the PARE experiment, cells were transfected twice with the siRNA against Xrn1 as previously described [5] . Plasmids pd2eGFP-N1 was purchased from Clontech. pCDNA3.1-GFP-SOX was previously described [7] . pCDEF3-SOX was previously described [13] . pd2eGFP-ΔTGAAG was previously described [5] . To test SOX-mediated cleavage of endogenous mRNA sequences, 33-200 nt surrounding putative cleavage sites in the human mRNAs to be tested were cloned from HEK293T cDNA using Vent polymerase (NEB). They were then inserted into the BsrGI site at nt 715 of the GFP coding region in pd2eGFP-N1, as previously done to test GFP sequences [5] , either by restriction enzyme digest or through a modified version of Quikchange mutagenesis [37] . An EcoRV site was also generated at nt 459 of the GFP coding region using Quikchange mutagenesis (Agilent) and the 200 nt surrounding the cleavage site in LIMD1 were inserted at this location. Quikchange mutagenesis (Agilent) was used to insert out the following mutations: 1) mutate the AAA sequence preceding the LIMD1 cleavage site to CCC, GGG and TTT in the pd2eGFP construct containing the 100 nt LIMD1 fragment; 2) mutate the AA sequence preceding the cleavage site to CC in the pd2eGFP constructs containing either the 100 nt PGAM1 or the 33 nt SRSF3 fragments; 3) mutate the cleavage site from A to G in the pd2eGFP constructs containing either the 100 nt LIMD1 fragment, the 100 nt PGAM1 fragment or the 33 nt SRSF3 fragment; 4) mutate the GFP TGAAGT to TGAGTG. All primers used for cloning are listed in S5 Table. PARE library preparation and sequencing HEK293T cells treated with siRNAs against Xrn1 (repeat 1) or expressing shRNAs against Xrn1 (repeat 2) were transfected either with pCDNA3.1-GFP-SOX or pd2eGFP-N1. In both cases >75% transfection efficiency was observed. One day after transfection total RNA was harvested and purified using RNABee (Teltest). RNA was then treated as described in Zhai et al. [24] to generate PARE libraries. Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA was purified, and RNA adapters were ligated to free 5' phosphate-bearing RNA ends. A second poly(A) purification was used to remove unligated adapter. cDNA was synthesized using oligodT directed primers, and the cDNA was then amplified 15 times. As the adapter includes an MmeI restriction endonuclease site, MmeI was used to cut the double stranded amplicons 20 bp downstream of the adapters. 3' dsDNA adapters were then ligated to the 3' end of the amplicons. This created libraries of 20 bp tags corresponding to the 5' end of RNA fragments flanked by adapters, similar to small RNA libraries. Libraries were checked on an Agilent Bioanalyzer and sequenced at the Vincent J. Coates Genomics Sequencing Laboratory at UC Berkeley using a HiSeq2000 Illumina sequencer. Raw data are available on the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database as study GSE70373.
