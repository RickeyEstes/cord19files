The energy minimization of the studied set of compounds (see Scheme 2a,b; and Schemes 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 for monoand di-substituted benzene derivatives) was performed using density functional theory (DFT) [65, 66] and the second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) method [67] . For DFT calculations, 6-311+G(d,p) basis sets were used [68] , whereas MP2 simulations were performed using the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set [69] . Concerning the DFT method, the three parameter hybrid functional proposed by Becke [70] with correlation energy according to the Lee-Yang-Parr formula [71] , denoted as B3LYP, was employed. Subsequently, harmonic frequencies were calculated to confirm that the geometries obtained correspond to the minimum on the potential energy surface (PES). Next, single point calculations were performed to build up an additional set of close conformers, with the intramolecular hydrogen bond using open structures (without H-bond) and rotation of the O-H bond 180°around the C-O single bond. The estimation of the overall energy (E tot ) associated with the intramolecular H-bond formation was computed using the so-called cis-trans method, for details see Reference [72] , as described below: Two homodesmotic reaction schemes presented in Schemes 4 or 5 allow us to estimate the overall energy associated with intramolecular H-bond formation: It is noteworthy that the final expression of the total energy, E tot , could be transformed into the form of Eq. 1. In the case of substituted derivatives of salicylicaldehyde, the two homodesmotic reaction schemes presented in Schemes 4 and 5 can be proposed. These reactions differ in products only, but this leads to a change of meaning in their substituent effect stabilization energy (SESE) value. Following Grabowski's method [43, 45] , the "pure" energy of H-bonding, E HB , can be obtained as: where E(open conformation_O-H rotated 180°) means the energy of the single point calculation for the closed conformer formed from that obtained from the open one after the rotation of O-H around the C-O single bond. The difference between the total and above energies is the energy due to the changes in geometry, sometimes called the energy of delocalization, E deloc : Furthermore, the SESE [63] was computed on the basis of the designed reactions in Schemes 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. All computations were performed within the framework of the Gaussian03 and Gaussian09 suite of programs [73, 74] . The reaction schemes were prepared using the ISIS Draw v2.3 program [75].
