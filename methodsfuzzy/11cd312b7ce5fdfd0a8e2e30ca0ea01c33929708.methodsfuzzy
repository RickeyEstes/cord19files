2.1. Viruses, plasmid, bacterial strains and expression vector PEDV strain CV777 was kindly provided by Pensaert MB. Plasmid DNA (pMD18-TS1) containing the S gene (1-2367 bp) of PEDV strain CV777 had been constructed previously (Sun et al., 2007b) . A genetargeted fd-tet phage display library (S1-phage library) containing DNA fragments ranging from approxi-mately 50 to 400 bp of the gene encoding the S1 region of PEDV S protein was established by our laboratory, and the neutralizing epitope region S1D located in S1 region of PEDV S protein (Sun et al., 2007a) . Escherichia coli strains MC1061 and K91BluKan, and the phage display vector fUSE 1, were generous gifts from Prof. George P. Smith, University of Missouri, Columbia, USA.
