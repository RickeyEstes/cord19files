Internal control construction -Complementary DNA from the MS2 RNA (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was synthesized using the primer CLONMS2-R (Table I) and ImProm II reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The primers forward CLONMS2-F and reverse CLONMS2-R were used to amplify a 3,569 bp region of the genome using GoTaq TM DNA polymerase (Promega). The amplicon was purified from an agarose gel and inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), generating the pGEM-T Easy-MS2 plasmid. pGEM-T Easy-MS2 was subsequently digested with NotI, generating a fragment of 3,604 bp containing the MS2 genome, which was purified and filled in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Herts, United Kingdom). pET-47b(+) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) was digested with XbaI and XhoI enzymes (New England Biolabs) liberating a 255 bp fragment of the polylinker region. After purification, the ends were filled in by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The 3,604 bp region originated from the pGEM-T Easy-MS2 excision was ligated to pET-47b(+), generating pET-47b(+)-MS2. A pUC57-mHCV (m stands for mutated), with an inserted sequence of 144 nt derived from HCV subtype 1a polyprotein, reference sequence AF009606.1, position 130 to 273 cloned into the BamHI site, was purchased from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ, USA). The mHCV sequence has altered bases compared with the reference sequence from position 149 to 169 (Fig. 1) . pET-47b(+)-MS2 and pUC5-mHCV were digested with BamHI (New England Biolabs). The former was linearised and the second released the mutated HCV sequence, which was ligated using T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) into the linearised vector at position 2,057 of the MS2 genome (based on GenBank accession number NC_001417.1), generating pET47b(+)-MS2-mHCV. The MS2 regions in plasmids pET-47b(+)-MS2 and pET-47b(+)-MS2-mHCV were sequenced using internal oligonucleotides (not shown). Plasmids propagation was conducted after transformation into Escherichia coli strains Top10F' (for pGEM-T Easy-MS2 and pET-47b(+)-MS2) and DH5α (pUC57-mHCV and pET-47b(+)-MS2-mHCV). Plasmid minipreps were obtained using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit or a HiSpeed Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen, Düren, Germany) and after restriction enzyme digestion, the fragments were purified from the agarose gel using a High Pure PCR Product Purification kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Confirmatory PCRs to check the presence of inserts and their orientation were also performed (not shown) and selected clones were sequenced at Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, South Korea). Internal control particles production -pET-47b(+)-MS2 and pET-47b(+)-MS2-mHCV were transformed in E. coli BL21 and transcription of the MS2 genome was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-Dgalactoside. After 3 h, the bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g. The bacteriophages particles in the supernatant were precipitated with 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol for 18 h at 4ºC and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 2 h. The pelleted viral particles were then suspended in SM medium (0.1 M NaCl, 8 mM MgSO 4 , 0.05 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.01% gelatin). The titer of MS2-like particles derived from pET-47b(+)-MS2 (to be used as the non-competitive internal control) was determined as plaque forming units (PFU)/ mL) by plating assays on E. coli XL1-Blue F'. MS2-mHCV particles derived from pET-47b(+)-MS2-mHCV (to be used as the competitive internal control) were quantified by realtime PCR, using the MS2-like particles as a reference, and the titer was expressed as MS2 PFU-equivalent (PFU-eq). Samples -Quantified HCV RNA samples were purchased from AcroMetrix (HCV OptiQuant HCV RNA/ Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and HCV RNA Linearity Panel PHW804 (SeraCare Life Sciences, Milford, CT, USA). An HIV clinical sample was kindly provided by LACEN/PR/Brazil. RNA extraction -RNA from HCV clinical samples and bacteriophage particles was extracted using BioPur (Biometrix, Curitiba, Brazil) and IBMP extraction kits (IBMP, Curitiba, Brazil) from 200 mL of plasma sample, bacteriophage solution or a mixture of the two, according to the manufacturer's instructions. An automatised solution also was tested using BioRobot® MDx and a QIAamp Media MDx kit from 600 mL of material (Qiagen). The purified RNA was eluted with 40-100 mL of appropriated buffer. One-step real-time PCR -The MS2-like and MS2-mHCV internal controls (ICs) were amplified using 400 nM of primers (MS2-F/MS2-R or HCV-F/HCV-R) and 200 nM of probe (MS2-P or mHCV-P). The multiplex HCV/MS2-like IC was done with 400 nM of primers MS2-F, MS2-R, HCV-F and HCV-R1, 58 nM HCV-R2 and 450 nM of probes (MS2-P and HCV-P). The multiplex reaction HCV/MS2-mHCV IC was done with 400 nM of primers HCV-F and HCV-R1, 58 nM HCV-R2 and 450 nM of probes (HCV-P and mHCV-P). The multiplex reaction HIV/MS2-like IC was amplified with 400 nM of the MS2 primers, 400 nM HIV-F and HIV-R primers and 450 nM of probes (MS2-P and HIV-P). All the reactions were performed in a 25 mL reaction with 10 mL of RNA, 1× PCR amplification buffer with Taq DNA polymerase and dNTPs (IBMP, Curitiba, Brazil) and 0.1 U of reverse transcriptase (IBMP, Curitiba, Brazil). All the oligonucleotide sequences are shown in Table I and in reference (Duarte et al. 2010 ). Fig. 1 : modified hepatitis C virus (mHCV) sequence aligned to HCV subtype 1a reference sequence: numbers indicating nucleotide positions refer to HCV reference sequence AF00906.01. Arrows indicate the first and last probe positions. Underlined, in the probe region, there are the bases in the mHCV sequence that differ from HCV genotype 1a reference sequence. BamHI sites are in gray. For all amplifications, the thermal cycle conditions began with an initial step at 51ºC (30 min) and 95ºC (10 min); followed by 60 cycles at 95ºC (30 s), 60ºC (1 min), in an ABI 7500 Thermal Cycler (Life Technologies).
