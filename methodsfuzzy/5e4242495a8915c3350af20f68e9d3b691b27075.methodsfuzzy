A commercial porcine serum (CPS) (AbD Serotec, Kidlington, UK) previously determined to contain antibodies against PToV, and a mixture of serum samples from caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived (CD/CD) pigs kept under germ free conditions (spf) were used in all serological assays as positive and negative controls, respectively (Pignatelli et al., 2009 ). All RNA extraction procedures, cDNA synthesis and real-time RT-PCR reactions were performed in independent rooms and in PCR hoods, using exclusive pipettes, filter tips and disposable aliquots of reagents and PCR grade water. Besides, RNA extraction, reverse transcription and real-time RT-PCR negative controls were analyzed in parallel with field samples in each plate to discard crosscontamination of samples.
