Bat sample collection. During June 2008, bats were collected with mist netting in caves and around human dwellings or manually from roost locations near Idanre and Zaria, Nigeria. All bats appeared clinically normal. Captured bats were anesthetized by intramuscular inoculation with ketamine hydrochloride (0.05 to 0.1 mg/g of body weight) and euthanized under sedation by intracardiac exsanguination and cervical dislocation. The species of each captured bat was recorded, as well as the sex, forearm and body lengths (in cm), and weight. All samples were initially stored, transported on ice packs, and stored thereafter at Ϫ20°C, until shipment on dry ice and final storage at Ϫ80°C. No lyssavirus-specific antigens were identified in bat brains by use of direct fluorescent antibody testing. Coronavirus consensus PCRs. Coronavirus screening was performed by nested PCR, amplifying a 400-nt fragment of the RdRp genes of coronaviruses using consensus primer sequences 5=-CGTTGGIACW AAYBTVCCWYTICARBTRGG-3= and 5=-GGTCATKATAGCRTCA VMASWWGCNACNACATG-3= for the first PCR and consensus primer sequences 5=-GGCWCCWCCHGGNGARCAATT-3= and 5=-GGWAWCCCCAYTGYTGWAYRTC-3= for the second PCR. Primers were designed by multiple alignments of the nucleotide sequences of available RdRp genes of known coronaviruses. Reverse transcription was performed using the SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). PCR primers were applied at 0. UHTS. Total RNA obtained from the gastrointestinal tract specimen positive for coronavirus was extracted for UHTS. Purified RNA (0.5 g) was DNase I digested (DNA-free; Ambion, Austin, TX) and reverse transcribed using a Superscript II kit (Invitrogen) with random octamer primers linked to an arbitrary, defined 17-mer primer sequence (MWG, Huntsville, AL). cDNA was RNase H treated prior to random amplification by PCR, applying a 9:1 dilution mixture of a primer corresponding to the defined 17-mer sequence and the octamer-linked 17-mer sequence primer, respectively. Products of Ͼ70 bp were purified (MinElute; Qiagen) and ligated to linkers for sequencing on a GS FLX sequencer (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT). Genome sequencing. PCR primers for amplification across sequence gaps were designed (available upon request) based on the UTHS data, and the draft genome was sequenced by overlapping PCR products. Products were purified (QIAquick PCR purification kit; Qiagen) and directly dideoxy sequenced in both directions with ABI Prism BigDye Terminator 1.1 cycle sequencing kits (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Additional methods applied to obtain the genome sequence included additional consensus PCR and 3= and 5= RACE (Invitrogen). Phylogenetic and sequence analyses. Alignments were constructed using MUSCLE 3.7 (49) and adjusted manually using Se-Al (50) . Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees containing representative taxa from each coronavirus genus (n ϭ 31) (Fig. 3, legend) were constructed using the subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) method of branch swapping in PhyML (51) . Phylogenies were constructed using amino acid alignments for the complete proteins of 3CL, Hel, M, and N and partial protein alignments for the available RdRp protein sequence and for the S protein after regions with low alignment confidence were removed. In all cases, the Whelan and Goldman model of amino acid replacement was used (52) , with a gamma distribution of rate heterogeneity. The value of the shape parameter for gamma (␣) was estimated from the data and approximated by six rate categories. The reliability of each branch in all phylogenies was estimated using a bootstrap resampling procedure, with 100 ML replications. To estimate the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for the taxa contained within subgroup 2b CoVs and including ZBCoV, an additional 659-nt alignment of the RdRp gene was constructed and chosen for homology to the gene region sequenced for the coronaviruses most closely related to ZBCoV (GhanaBt-CoV). All sequences for which timeof-sampling information was available were included (n ϭ 64). TMRCAs were estimated using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with the BEAST package, version 1.5.2 (53) , and both the general time-reversible (GTR) model plus ⌫ distribution and the SRD06 model of nucleotide substitution. A relaxed uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock was used, calibrated by the time-stamped sequences, both with and without informative rates prior on the molecular clock of 2.0 ϫ 10 Ϫ4 Ϯ 0.0009 nt substitutions/site/year (35) . This analysis was run until all parameters converged, with 10% of the MCMC chains discarded as burn-in. Statistical confidence in the TMRCA estimates is given by the 95% highest probability density (HPD) interval around the marginal posterior parameter mean. The classification of ZBCoV and GhanaBt-CoV as a putative new subgroup within group 2 CoVs was determined by first calculating the percent pairwise nucleotide similarity of the same 659-nt region of RdRp genes between and within the existing subgroups of coronaviruses and then extending this comparison to include the clade ZBCoV/GhanaBt-CoV. To verify this approach, a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess if the pairwise nucleotide similarity within the currently accepted subgroups is different from that between subgroups. This test was then used to determine if the percent pairwise similarity within the clade ZBCoV/GhanaBt-CoV is statistically different from that of the most closely related subgroup 2b CoVs. Protein family analysis was performed using Pfam (http://pfam.sanger .ac.uk/). Predictions of signal peptide cleavage sites, glycosylation sites, and transmembrane domains were performed using respective prediction servers available at the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis (http: //www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ and http://www.ch.embnet.org/software /TMPRED_form.html). The percent amino acid sequence identity and similarity were calculated using the Needleman algorithm with an EBLO-SUM62 substitution matrix (gap open/extension penalties of 10/0.1 for nucleotide and amino acid alignments; EMBOSS [54] ), using a Perl script to iterate the process for all versus all comparisons. Prediction of RNA secondary structures was performed with the mfold program (http: //mfold.bioinfo.rpi.edu/). Nucleotide sequence accession number. The GenBank accession number for the ZBCoV sequence is HQ166910.
