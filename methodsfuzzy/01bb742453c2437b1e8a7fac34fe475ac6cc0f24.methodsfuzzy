2.1. Production of HIV envelope proteins gp120, gp140, and gp120 fragments Recombinant gp140 was prepared as described previously (Berman et al., 1989 (Berman et al., , 1990 from the 108060 Q655R clinical isolate (O'Rourke et al., 2009) . From this sequence, the extracellular domain of gp160 (gp140), full length gp120, and nine overlapping fragments of 108060 Q655R were created and expressed as previously described (Nakamura, 2012) . All proteins contained a flag epitope from herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) fused to the amino terminus as described previously (Lasky et al., 1986; Berman et al., 1988) . All proteins were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using an immunosorbent prepared with 34.1, a mAb to the gD flag epitope. Point mutations N130H or T132A were introduced into a V1/V2 fragment of gp120 from the MN strain of HIV-1 by site-directed mutagenesis, using a QuikChange Lightning kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The resulting construct was verified by confirmatory sequencing. Plasmids for protein expression were transfected into FreeStyle TM 293-F cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
