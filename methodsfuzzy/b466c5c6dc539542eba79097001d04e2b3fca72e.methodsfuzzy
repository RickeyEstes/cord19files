Two techniques were devised, one for intra-sequence comparison and another for inter-sequence comparison. For the variations within a sequence arising from the base distribution, we had observed [27] that coding regions of mammalian gene sequences appeared as a dense cluster of points in the 2D graphical representations implying high degree of mixing of the four bases in almost equal proportions, whereas the non-coding regions that were A-T or G-C rich usually appeared as long filaments. We therefore devised a cluster density measurement by enclosing such regions in a square grid and dividing the number of points in the grid by the area of the square. This was complemented by an inverse displacement method and a fractal coefficient method to numerically assess the differences between these two types of regions. Analysis of 386 introns (noncoding regions of a gene) and exons (coding regions) of 35 genes from various species by these measures showed [27] that (a) cluster density of non-coding regions are very small and fall off exponentially rapidly, (b) the cluster density of coding regions grows to about 0.8 per unit area and falls off gradually, (c) exons of evolutionarily later genes have higher cluster densities, (d) cluster densities of intronless genes like the phage M13 genome or the bacteriophage lambda are very low, closely paralleling intron densities and (e) more recent genes show greater fragmentation and smaller lengths of the exons. The cluster density measure also enabled us to propose a way of predicting protein coding regions in new DNA sequences [41] and was used to analyse the human chromosome 3 contig 7 and predict existence of several genes [42] . Gates [6] had proposed a Manhattan distance computation to compare two or more sequences, but this method is suitable for equal length sequences, whereas gene sequences are not generally of equal lengths. To study similarities and dissimilarities of genes from various species we devised a new and different methodology, which was reported for the first time in the First Indo-US Workshop 1998 [10] and published the following year [11] , as mentioned earlier. Since we have in the 2D graphical representation a set of discrete points comprising each gene sequence, we defined a function to describe the sequence as where S 0 is the zeroth-order term representing the coordinates x f , y f of the end points, S 1 is the linear term representing the first-order moments about the two axes, S 2 the second-order term representing the variance about the mean, S 3 the third order term representing the skewness, etc., all of which taken together became a descriptor for the sequence. For the initial presentation we computed the first order moments as weighted center of mass only and defined a graph radius, g R , the distance of the weighted center of mass from the origin, for each sequence and a g R to estimate the difference between two sequences plotted on the same scale; this scheme gave a reasonable fit to the dispersion of the beta globin genes from various species [11] . Because of the cumulative nature of the sequence plots, differences in base distributions will lead to progressively increasing differences in the plots. Closely related sequences with less mutational changes between them will have smaller g R while unrelated sequences can be expected to lead to larger values of the g R . As remarked by the authors, this method could clearly be generalized to apply to the case of protein and other sequences where one may represent the sequences in a multidimensional hyperspace with a view to eventually develop phylogenetic trees. These techniques have been used by several authors (e.g., [43, 48] ). Bielińska-Wąż et al. [28] have computed the moments to various higher orders in a 2D dynamic graph with statistical moments of mass-density distributions as new descriptors. Computing the moments for a set of histone genes, they showed that the larger number of descriptors improved the characterization of the object and different aspects of the DNA could be compared separately while retaining the simplicity of the 2D graphs. Nandy and Nandy [44] showed that the g R s were quite sensitive measures where base composition or base arrangement differences caused the g R to change and that two or more sequences will not have the same g R value except in some pathological cases. The graph theoretic method arose out of deliberations after the first presentation of the 2D graphical representations in Duluth in 1999. The method described in the paper by Randić, Vracko Nandy and Basak [36] was to first represent a DNA sequence graphically in a 3D Cartesian grid and then convert the points to elements of a matrix by computing the ratio of Euclidean distance to graph theoretic distance between all possible pairs of points taken systematically. Matrix methods are well studied and have well recognized properties. The D/D matrix generated by the distance measures was analysed to yield a set of eigenvalues with the leading eigenvalue being taken as invariant of the matrix and therefore of the sequence. Differences between the leading eigenvalues of various gene sequences could then be taken as indicative of their evolutionary distances, although this seminal paper limited itself to computation on the basis of the first exons of 11 beta globin genes only. The interesting point to note is that this paper led to generation of intense interest among researchers and many different ways of representing DNA sequences and computation of evolutionary distances subsequently ensued (see review Nandy et al. [16] ). Authors such as Randić et al. [33] , Randić [35] , He and Wang [45] , Song and Tan [46] and many others proposed different ways to graphically represent DNA sequences and convert the plots to mathematical objects, and derive leading eigenvalues as invariants of the sequences. For example, He and Wang [45] reduced the DNA sequences to a set of three sequences based on their structural, chemical and bonding nature and devised a vector of the three leading eigenvalues of the matrices associated with each of the reduced sequences which they proposed as being characteristic sequences of the original DNA sequence. Distances between two sequences then were computed by determining the distances between the end points of the two vectors. Song and Tan [46] similarly devised a 24-component vector characterizing a sequence, others came up with other ways of computing the intersequence distances based on vectors devised out of the matrix eigenvalues. Such matrix invariants from their own representations were used by Liao et al. [47] , Wang et al. [43] , Liao et al. [48] and others to draw phylogenetic trees for mitochondrial genes, SARS coronavirus genomes, etc. The graph theoretic method, however, does not seem to have been applied so far to determine specific features within a sequence.
