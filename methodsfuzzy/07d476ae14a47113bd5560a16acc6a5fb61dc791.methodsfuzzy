Viruses are either DNA or RNA, enclosed in a protein coat with or without a lipid membrane shell. Viruses require host cells for replication and many have limited survival outside the host. Traditional detection of viral infections involves culturing the viruses with mammalian cells. Viruses often display cell tropism (preferential growth) for specific cell types and produce characteristic cytopathic (cellular disruption) effects ( Figure 28 ). An adaptation of viral culture is the shell-vial culture during which the specimen is centrifuged into the cells growing on a coverslip. After 2-5 days of incubation, the coverslip is stained with a fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody specific for the virus in question. Although viral culture methods have disappeared from many routine laboratories, the viral culture techniques are essential for public health and epidemiological data collection, vaccine development, research, and response to emerging viruses. Several pathogens are difficult to culture or noncultivatable in a clinical laboratory, including Treponema, Rickettsia, Ehrlichia, many parasites, Epstein-Barr virus, norovirus, and human papillomaviruses, among others. Alternative methods, such as serology and molecular techniques, must be used to identify these infections. Some examples of virus-disease associations are listed in Figure 29 . In situ hybridization, PCR, and sequencing The use of molecular techniques in microbial identification has increased dramatically over the past decade and there is still a rapid rate of introduction of new and revised methods and applications. Detection of an organism's nucleic acid does not require a viable organism, which is a big advantage. Molecular methods overall tend to be very sensitive and specific. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a technique using a tagged nucleic acid probe on cultures or fixed tissue to identify the DNA of the suspected organism ( Figure 34 ). PCR is a powerful method and is used in a number of ways. PCR uses a heat-stable DNA polymerase combined with DNA oligomers (primers) of a specific sequence designed to amplify a specific target. Multiple cycles of heating denature the DNA, followed by cooling to allow specific hybridization of primers, and then extension of synthesized product by the polymerase enzyme can result in a millionfold increase in the DNA of interest. The process can be completed in several hours or shorter with new fast instruments ( Figure 35 ). Multiple adaptations of PCR include reverse-transcription PCR, which includes an initial step to convert RNA into DNA, followed by DNA amplification, or real-time PCR that permits quantification of the starting nucleic acid. The DNA product is measured in each cycle, often by a fluorescent DNA probe, and the amount of signal on each cycle is proportional to the starting material ( Figure 36 ). Real-time PCR is used for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, BK and JC polyomaviruses, herpesviruses, and quite a few more targets. The conversion of viral testing from viral culture techniques to molecular methods had a huge impact on test turnaround time. Some viral cultures previously took 14-21 days, but results can now be obtained in a few hours. Most of virology testing has moved from viral culture, shell-vial culture, rapid immunochromatographic assays, and DFA assays to realtime PCR assays. Multiplex PCR includes multiple primer sets in a single reaction with a number of ingenious ways to separate and detect the signal of the specific pathogens. Assays currently may have 16 or more targets in an individual assay. Respiratory virus detection was greatly improved by multiplex methods compared to culture, DFA assays, antigen detection, and single-target PCR assays. DNA sequencing of the gene for the 16S ribosomal subunit, a component of the cellular protein synthesis machine, is used to identify bacteria that may not be identified by phenotypic methods described earlier. Sequencing ribosomal or other genes may also be used for identification of fungi, mycobacteria, and viruses. Additional nucleic acid amplification methods include the isothermal methods. For nucleic acid sequence-based amplification and transcription-mediated amplification, RNA is reverse-transcribed into cDNA, and RNA copies are synthesized with RNA polymerase. Loop-mediated amplification is another isothermal method that has been developed for a number of targets. Branched-chain DNA assays are an alternative to PCR. Short DNA sequences complementary to viral RNA are attached to a surface to capture the target. Next, a second cDNA is added attached to a branched chain of DNA. With subsequent cycles, the signal is amplified. This method is used for sensitive detection of HIV viral loads ( Figure 37 ). Standard of care for diagnosis and treatment of patients with HIV infections includes the determination of actual viral load and phenotypic/genotypic determination of likely susceptibility to anti-HIV agents. Instruments for HIV testing have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a US federal agency responsible for protecting public health, and standardized reporting of viral titer in international units provides a comparable result for a specific specimen regardless of where in the world the specimen was tested, by incorporating a global quality control into the data analysis. An infection control team in a hospital monitors for spread of pathogenic organisms within the hospital from one patient to another. Because hospitalized individuals are battling their underlying illnesses, they are vulnerable to severe complications from a nosocomial infection. Similarly, an outbreak of an organism in the community is tracked by public health labs to determine the source of infections and to stop an outbreak if possible. Some of the systems to investigate clonality (genetic similarity) of organisms include pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), plasmid profiling, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), repetitive-element PCR, and genome sequencing. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based methods utilize the variation in DNA fragments obtained upon a specific restriction enzyme digestion of bacterial genomic DNA. PFGE involves digestion of isolates by restriction enzymes in an agarose plug, choosing an enzyme that will result in 10-20 DNA fragments. Then, the DNA is separated by a specialized electrophoresis device that uses a pulsed electric field ( Figure 38 ). The RFLPs are compared by analyzing multiple isolates on the same gel to determine similarity of the patterns. Plasmid profiling involves gel electrophoresis of plasmids after disruption of genomic DNA. The discriminating power of this method is variable. Repetitive-element PCR amplifies the region between interspersed repetitive DNA elements. The amplicons generated will vary between strains, thus allowing determination of strain similarity in an outbreak. MLST detects variations due to mutations or recombination by direct sequencing of fragments in housekeeping genes or another specific set of genes, such as virulence genes. The different MLST profiles of organisms under investigation are then compared. Whole-genome sequencing is now possible as an epidemiological tool. With the decrease in the cost of sequencing, entire genomes can be compared and singlenucleotide polymorphisms, deletions, insertions, or recombinations can be detected. Only a limited number of labs have access to whole-genome sequence techniques and the bioinformatics experts to analyze the data. Sequencing can also be used to compare viral strains that are implicated in an outbreak.
