It is common for concentration to comprise at least two stages. The first stage will reduce the volume to between 100 and 400 ml, and the second stage will reduce it to 2-10 ml. Supplementary stages may be added to remove cytotoxic or PCR-inhibitory compounds. Block and Schwartzbrod (1989) defined a number of criteria that an ideal concentration method must fulfil to be of practical use. The method should: be technically easy to accomplish in a short time; have a high virus recovery rate; concentrate a range of viruses; provide a small volume of concentrate; not be costly; be capable of processing large volumes of water; and be repeatable (within a laboratory) and be reproducible (between laboratories). No single method fulfils all these requirements. The properties of viruses are most often exploited in their concentration, and the general approaches to concentration derived from them are shown in Table 1 . Numerous methods based on these approaches have been devised for the concentration of viruses from water and the principal ones are summarised in Table 2 . These have been reviewed extensively by Wyn-Jones and Sellwood (1998) in respect of enteroviruses and by Wyn-Jones and Sellwood (2001) for other virus groups. The virology of waterborne disease is discussed in Percival et al. (2004) . The Detection of Waterborne Viruses Many other methods exist, though none satisfies all the requirements given above by Block and Schwartzbrod (1989) . These include hydroextraction with hygroscopic solids (Wellings et al., 1976; Ramia and Sattar, 1979) , iron oxide flocculation (Rao et al., 1968; Bitton et al., 1976) , two-phase separation (Lund and Hedstrom, 1966) and freeze-drying (Bosch et al., 1988; Kittigul et al., 2001) . Affinity columns were used by Schwab et al. (1996) in a broad-based antibodycapture technique for a variety of viruses and Myrmel et al. (2000) described the separation of noroviruses in this way. An important attribute of this method is that it acts as a clean-up stage to remove RT-PCR inhibitors. Cromeans et al. (2004) reported the preparation and use of a soluble Coxsackie virus-adenovirus (sCAR) receptor immobilised to magnetic beads for the concentration of Coxsackie and adenoviruses from water sample concentrates. The receptor, which neutralised Coxsackie virus B3, also reacted with other Coxsackie B types. The group also reported the use of a neutralising monoclonal antibody for immunocapture of the same viruses. Several comparative studies have been done on methods for the detection of enteroviruses in water. Morris and Waite (1980) , for example, concluded that Good, especially where all concentrate tested in one assay monolayers were the least sensitive system, tube cultures were of intermediate sensitivity (for MPN determination, though only four tubes were set up per dilution) and the suspended-cell assay was the most sensitive. BGM cells gave the best recoveries and RD cells were variable. RD cells have been reported susceptible to Coxsackie virus A strains (Block and Schwartzbrod, 1989 ) though they are less sensitive than suckling mice, which is the only other system that supports growth of this group of viruses. Virus infectivity may also be determined by immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase techniques, which are particularly useful where limited replication occurs and a distinct c.p.e. is not produced. It may also be determined by molecular biology techniques such as the detection of virus-specific mRNA.
