For the studies, a total of 30 calves were kept in two sequences (Study I and Study II, study schedules see Table  1 ) under the same housing conditions (same stable, two calves per pen, air-conditioned rooms, feeding with milk replacer and roughage), including six calves for pathological examination and 24 for the analysis of efficacy of treatment with toltrazuril. All animals were healthy Holstein-Mix bull calves, aged between one and four weeks at the start of the study. At the start of the studies, the animals were infected orally with 150,000 sporulated E. zuernii-oocysts each of field isolates from one commercial farm, used unpassaged for Study I (approximately one month after isolation) and passaged once approximately 2 weeks before use in Study II, respectively. This infective dose had been determined as suitable to provoke clinical coccidiosis in a preliminary study observing clinical effects in animals inoculated with dose rates of 50,000 and 150,000 sporulated E. zuerniioocysts per calf. The infective material contained nearly 100% pure E. zuernii-oocysts with occasional contamination by E. ellipsoidalis-oocysts (verified by counting of the oocyst stock solution). The calves' faeces (samples of approximately 50 -100 g, taken by digital stimulation of the anus) were examined three times weekly for the first 14 days post infectionem (dpi) and then daily for consistency and oocyst excretion. The calves were also under continuous clinical surveillance, i.e. animal health observations (animal attitude and behaviour) were performed in all groups on 0-13 dpi, animal health examinations (animal behaviour, body temperature and skin turgidity) were performed daily from 14 dpi (study I) or 15 dpi (study II), respectively, to 28 dpi (or up to the day of sacrifice of the respective animal in study I). Complete clinical examinations of all calves were performed before infection and in study II additionally on day 14 directly prior to randomisation. The live weight of the animals was determined once a week. Faecal consistency was assessed on the basis of a scoring system (1: normal to pasty, 2: semiliquid to liquid, 3: watery, 4: haemorrhagic and/or with tissue). Oocyst excretion was determined quantitatively in the faecal samples using the McMaster method [5] , modified by using 4 g of fresh faeces per 60 ml of saturated NaCl solution and mixing the suspension with a magnetic stirrer for about 2 min at the highest setting before transferring it into the McMaster slide. The quantitative results obtained were documented as absolute opg (oocysts per gram faeces) value and also analysed in terms of an opg score (0: no oocysts detectable, 1: 100 opg, 2: 1,000 opg, 3: 10,000 opg, 4: ! 10,000 opg). Faecal samples were also sent for differential diagnosis to an extern laboratory (BioCheck, Leipzig, Germany) and examined in regard of pathogenic bacteria (salmonella, Escherichia coli, coliform germs, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens), viruses (rota-and corona virus) and yeasts. Two animals each were sacrificed at various time points (Table 1) , i.e. during the prepatent period (Group A, day 16 post infection [16 dpi]), in the patent period (Group B, 21 dpi), and in the late patent period (Group C, 26 dpi). On the scheduled necropsy days, the calves were euthanised by complete exsanguination after anesthesia by captive bolt. At necropsy, the intestine was removed, opened, rinsed, and examined for eventual macroscopic findings. Samples were collected from different localisations and fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde solution. They were as follows: jejunum (mid part and caudal part, approximately 30 cm cranial of the ileocaecal junction), ileum (caudal part at the ileocaecal junction), caecum, colon (proximal and second loop of the spiral colon). Additionally, samples of the ileocaecal and the mesenteric lymph nodes were collected and fixed. Specimens of every localisation mentioned above were trimmed, embedded in paraffin wax, and cut at a thickness of approximately 5 Am. All slides were stained routinely with hemalum and eosin (H&E). Samples from the terminal ileum, caecum and colon were taken for scanning electron microscopic evaluation. The samples were clamped on cork plates, flushed with cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) and fixed in phosphate buffered glutaraldehyde (2%). They were post fixed in osmium tetroxide solution (pH 7.0), dehydrated with increasing ethanol and hexamethyledisilazan (HMDS), mounted on specimen holders and sputtered with gold (Balzers AG, Balzers, Liechtenstein). The evaluation was carried out using a Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM, Quanta 400, FEI Company, Hillsboro, USA). The aim of Study II was to investigate the efficacy of toltrazuril following metaphylactic treatment (Table 1) , i.e. the study animals were treated during the prepatent period (before the start of oocyst excretion). The calves were assigned randomly to two groups on 14 dpi for the determination of efficacy (one calf was excluded from the study because of premature E. zuernii excretion). Twelve calves were treated with toltrazuril at a dose rate of 15 mg toltrazuril/kg live weight, eleven were shamtreated with water as negative controls. Following treatment, the calves were examined clinically and coproscopically daily for 18 days and weighed weekly.  The results of the pathological investigations in Study I (in calf groups A, B and C) were analysed descriptively. The clinical and parasitological results from Study I were used to characterise the infection and determine the sampling times (for Groups B and C). The results from Study II (Groups D and E) were analysed statistically using the SAS program (version 8.02.02M0P012301, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, USA). The mean values for the individual animals over the study period (14 -32 dpi), concerning faecal score, opg score and weight gain were used as a basis for statistical analysis to compare both study groups statistically, using the one-way analysis of variance.
