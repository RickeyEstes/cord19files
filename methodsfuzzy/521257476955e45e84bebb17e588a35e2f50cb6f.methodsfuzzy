The fibers of human adenoviruses serotype 2 (Ad2) of subgroup C and serotype 3 (Ad3) of subgroup B are already well characterised. The fiber 2 is a thin projection, 37 nm long (Ruigrok et al., 1990) , terminating in a knob. The N-terminus of the polypeptide chains of the fibers, located in the tail region, interacts with the penton base, and the C-terminus is in the knob (Devaux et al., 1987; Caillet-Boudin et al., 1988; Weber et al., 1989) . The length of the fiber of human Ad3 is only 16 nm (Ruigrok et al., 1990) . The Ad2 fiber is glycosylated (Ishibashi and Maizel, 1974) but the Ad3 fiber apparently not (Caillet-Boudin et al., 1989) . The fibers are trimers of identical subunits (Van Oostrum and Burnett, 1985; Albiges-Rizo et al., 1991) . The first step in the interaction of the adenovirus with a permissive cell is the attachment of the virus, via the head domain of the fiber, to a primary cell plasma membrane receptor (Bai et al., 1993; Mathias et al., 1994; Louis et al., 1994; Di Guilmi et al., 1995) and via the RGD sequence motif of the penton base to a second receptor. Despite the extensive study of the fiber there are some questions, so it is not known which sequences of the fiber knob participate in the virus attachment. Synthetic peptides can be useful not only for the diagnosis of human adenovirus serotypes and for immunological questions (Modrow and Wolf, 1990) , but also for the study of virus cell interaction. In this paper we evaluated the influence of some selected peptides of Ad3 and Ad2 fiber knob on the first step of interaction between adenoviruses and permissive cells. The requirement for an influence of peptides is the existence of continuous determinants in the binding site(s). The influence was also studied with labeled viruses and labeled cells. Especially, the adhesion of HeLa and FL cells to these peptides, to Ad2 and Ad3 virus and the attachment of Ad2 and Ad3 to the cells was examined. Additionally, the ability of prepared anti-peptide sera to bind and to neutralise the virus serotypes Ad2 and Ad3 was investigated.
