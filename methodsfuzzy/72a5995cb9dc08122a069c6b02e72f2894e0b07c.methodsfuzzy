2.1. Cell Culture and DAC Treatment. Human myelodysplastic syndrome cell line SKM-1 was a gift from Professor Li Chunrui at the Department of Hematology, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, China. SKM-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10% FBS (Gibco Life Technologies) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . When cells reached the logarithmic growth phase, they were seeded at a density of 5 × 10 5 cells/ well in 6-well plates and treated with 0.5 μM DAC (Xian-Janssen Pharmaceutical, Xian, China) for 6 days. Every 48 hours, the medium in the wells was replaced with fresh medium containing 0.5 μM DAC.
