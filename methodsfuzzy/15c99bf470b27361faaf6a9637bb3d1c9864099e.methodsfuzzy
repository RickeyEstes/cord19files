Although the CF method can be applied to test for antibodies to most infectious agents, it is no longer in routine use because it is time-consuming and not very sensitive (Schmidt, 1969) . For viruses that agglutinate red blood cells, the HAI test method (Fig. 7) , which is predicated on the ability of specific antibodies to inhibit virus-mediated hemagglutination, is still commonly employed as a confirmatory test, because it is simple to perform and can distinguish among antibodies to different species or strains of viruses (Table VI) (Chanock, 1979; Siegl, 1976; Smith et al., 1993b) . In the standard HAI test method, each serum sample is titrated in duplicate. One dilution is incubated with virus; the other, without. When hemagglutination is detected in the virus wells but not in the control wells, the sample is considered HAI antibody-negative. If hemagglutination is inhibited in the virus wells, and the control wells show no evidence of hemagglutination, the result is recorded as a titer, which is the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution to inhibit virus-mediated hemagglutination. Significant titers (-> 10 or 20, depending on the virus) can also be caused by nonspecific inhibitors of hemagglutination, which can be removed by heat inactivation, enzymatic digestion, and other treatments (Hier- holzer et al., 1969) . Hemagglutination in the control wells indicates that the serum contains agglutinins that will mask the presence of specific antibodies (Table VII) .
