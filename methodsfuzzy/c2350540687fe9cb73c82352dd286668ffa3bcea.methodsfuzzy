Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following:  Materials BODIPY-FL-labeled and unlabeled water soluble phosphoinositides were from Echelon Biosciences, Inc. The lipids for supported lipid bilayer experiments, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) (850457C), L-a-phosphatidylinositol (PI) (840042C), L-a-phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) (LM-1900), L-a-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) (840045X), and L-a-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P 2 ) (840046X) were from Avanti Polar Lipids. The pH sensitive fluorescent probe ortho-Sulforhodamine B-POPE (oSRB-POPE) was synthesized following the previously published procedure . 15 N-ammonium chloride and deuterium oxide were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Rectangular borosilicate glass coverslips (22 x 40 x 0.16-0.19 mm, No. 1Â½) for supported lipid bilayer binding experiments were from Fisher Scientific (12-544B) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Dow Corning Sylgard Silicone Elastomer-184) was from Ellsworth Adhesives (4019862). Prime grade, single side polished, silicon wafers with 100 mm diameter and 525 mm thickness were from University Wafer (ID. 1575). All other reagents were available from VWR, Fisher Scientific, or Sigma-Aldrich.
