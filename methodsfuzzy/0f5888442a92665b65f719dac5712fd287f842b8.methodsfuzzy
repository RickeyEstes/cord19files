In this section, the geometrical model used to demonstrate gaseous pollutant cross-transmission via single-sided, buoyancydriven ventilation in a multistory building is presented first, followed by a brief introduction of governing equations to solve airflow and pollutant transmission using CFD. Finally, the numerical solution and validation is addressed.
