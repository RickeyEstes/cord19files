I studied how the expected final outbreak size and the coefficient of variation in the final size of outbreaks scale with control effectiveness and the rate of infectious contacts in the simple stochastic epidemic. As examples, I parameterized this model with data on observed ranges for the basic reproductive ratio (R 0 ) of nine directly transmitted diseases. I also present results from a new model, the simple stochastic epidemic with delayed-onset intervention, in which an initially supercritical outbreak (R 0 . 1) is brought under control after a delay. The simplest realistic model for outbreaks with a small number of initially infectious individuals is the simple stochastic epidemic with contact rate b and removal rate c, which do not change appreciably over the time scale of the outbreak [15, 16] . This model is a good approximation if the outbreak meets the following criteria, which are reasonable for modern outbreaks that are rapidly controlled. First, we assume that infectious contacts and removal of infectious individuals are approximately independent in time so that the outbreak is Markovian (compare [17] [18] [19] ). Second, the rate at which infectious individuals are removed from the population exceeds the rate at which infectious contacts occur (b , c). Finally, the population is sufficiently large that the number of individuals ultimately infected is not more than a negligible fraction of the susceptible population (i.e., per capita transmission rates are approximately independent of the density of infected individuals). Then, the outbreak is a homogeneous birth-death process (the simple stochastic epidemic) with mean (M) and variance (V) of the final outbreak size given by [10] : Properties of the final size distribution for other classes of epidemics can be found in [11] [12] [13] [14] 17, 20] . The solution given by equations 1 and 2 is for an outbreak in which either (1) epidemiological parameters are naturally such that always R 0 , 1, or (2) public health policy is applied consistently so that intervention is constant and under policy conditions R 0 , 1. For many emerging diseases this is not the case. Rather, initially R 0 . 1, but through intervention that was established some measurable time after the outbreak started, the reproductive ratio is reduced below the epidemic threshold (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] ). This case is considerably more complicated and, to my knowledge, no simple formulas have been obtained for the mean and variance of the final outbreak size. However, it is reasonably straightforward to solve the equations computationally, and a range of conditions can be studied. Below, I consider a case that is more applicable to forecasting emerging diseases, the simple stochastic epidemic with delayed-onset intervention in which there is a constant rate of infectious contacts (b) and a removal rate (c) that depends on the time since the outbreak began. Specifically, at the start of the outbreak the removal rate is some value less than the rate of infectious contacts and remains constant until some intervention is applied a time t*Àt 0 later, after which the removal rate is some constant value greater than b, i.e., cðtÞ ¼ c 1 Iðt t Ã Þ þ c 2 Iðt.t Ã Þ, where I is an indicator function equal to one if its argument is true and zero otherwise. Then, we can study the size of the outbreak as a function of the control parameter t*, the time at which intervention is initiated.
