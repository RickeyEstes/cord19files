Nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients aged <5 years and nasopharyngeal and throat swabs from patients aged ≥5 years were placed in viral transport media, kept at 4-8°C, and sent to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg within 72 hours of collection. Respiratory specimens were tested by multiplex real-time, reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for 10 respiratory viruses (PIV types 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]; influenza A and B viruses; enterovirus; human metapneumovirus; adenovirus, and rhinovirus) [17] . We did not test for PIV type 4 during the study period. We did not test for adenovirus from August to October 2009 because of unavailability of reagents. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified by quantitative real-time PCR detecting the lytA gene from whole blood specimens [20] . When available, HIV-infection status data were obtained through routine standard of care testing at the treating hospital. When not available, HIV testing was implemented at NICD through anonymized, linked dried blood spot specimen testing by HIV PCR assay for children aged <18 months and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for those aged ≥18 months.
