The clinical trials at the Common Cold Unit were designed for purposes other than examining the effects of respiratory virus infections on performance. This imposed certain limitations on the type of task and length and frequency of testing. Similarly, portable tests had to be used because the volunteers were in isolation and could only be tested in their flats. As already mentioned, there is little information on the effects of naturally occurring illnesses on performance. It was decided, therefore, initially to examine the effects of a variety of different viruses on many different aspects of performance, the aim being to draw up a profile of the effects of the different illnesses. Following this 'broad-band strategy' (see Hockey and Hamilton, 1983) it was envisaged that a hypothesis-driven approach with more focused test selection would be adopted. Unfortunately, the closure of the Unit meant that this second stage was not completed. However, the initial studies greatly increased our knowledge of the effects of colds and influenza on performance and the methods used are described below. Two main methods of performance testing were used. The first involved administration of paper and pencil tests measuring logical reasoning, visual search and semantic processing. Subjects also rated their mood and performed a simple motor task involving the transfer of pegs from a full solitaire set to an empty one. These tests were carried out at four times of day (8.00 a.m., 12 noon, 5.00 p.m. and 10 p.m.) on every day of the trial. It was important to examine performance at several times of day for two reasons. Firstly, it has been shown that performance changes over the day and, secondly, there is diurnal variation in the severity of symptoms of colds and influenza (see Smith et al, 1988a) with nasal secretion and temperature being highest in the early morning. This first method of assessing performance was used only in a small number of trials, largely because it was unpopular with the volunteers and because it interfered with the routine of the Unit. The second method of assessing performance used computerized performance tasks, with volunteers being tested once in the pre-challenge quarantine period (the baseline measurement) and again when symptoms were apparent in some volunteers. In a few trials, performance testing was also carried out in the incubation period, and in one trial performance was assessed after the symptoms had gone. Subjects were always tested at the same time of day on all occasions (although some subjects were tested in the morning and others in the afternoon, which meant that a between-subjects comparison allowed diurnal variation of any effects to be measured). The computerized tasks were selected to assess a range of functions (memory, attention, motor skills) and most of the tests have been widely used to study abnormal states or stressful environments. In most trials the volunteers could be subdivided into those with colds, those with subclinical infections and those who remained uninfected (or were given placebos). In some trials, however, there were no volunteers in certain categories. Analyses of covariance were carried out on the data using the pre-challenge scores as covariates. This statistical technique takes account of baseline differences when assessing the effects of the illness. The following section describes the effects of influenza on performance.
