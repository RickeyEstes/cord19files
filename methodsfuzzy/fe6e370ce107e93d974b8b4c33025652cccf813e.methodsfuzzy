2.1. Tissue collection and cell culture P. alecto bats were trapped in Southern Queensland, Australia, and transported alive by air to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Victoria, where they were euthanised for dissection using methods approved by the AAHL animal ethics committee. Tissues were stored at À80°C in RNAlater (Ambion). PaKiT03 cells are an immortalised kidney cell line derived from P. alecto primary tissue as described in Crameri et al. (2009) . They were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotic/antifungal mixture.
