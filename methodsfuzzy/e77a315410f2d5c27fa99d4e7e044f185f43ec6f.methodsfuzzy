The research setting is the e-commerce platform industry in China. We have configured the leading firms with a historical examination of the industry. As the number of entries have increased in the e-commerce platform business, it is not possible to interview all platform firms. Instead, we have selected Alibaba as our case study for several reasons. First, Alibaba has witnessed the industrial evolution since the early stage of e-commerce. The firm, thus, is a valuable source to provide information about the industry's efforts toward legitimacy building over time. Second, although Alibaba shares approximately 50% of the e-commerce platform business (KPMG, 2014; McKinsey and Company, 2013) , its share rises to 90% of the business if including mobile commerce, another form of e-commerce in a broader sense. This fact sufficiently qualifies Alibaba as a key object to study in China's e-commerce industry. At the same time, it means that Alibaba's legitimacy has been essential in explaining its market success. Third, as Alibaba went to initial public offering in the overseas market, the firm is now being globalized. We also examine whether the increasing overseas sales have affected legitimacy building in the domestic market. In order to obtain interview data about legitimacy building by Alibaba, we have accessed mainly Alibaba's stakeholders, including suppliers, consumer groups, and R&D partners. Overall, we have conducted seven interviews, with each interview lasting 2 h on average per visit. The interviewees have been working within or with Alibaba since its establishment. The interviews were with one Alipay developer, one ex-employee at Alibaba as a merchandiser, one manager in public relations at one of Alibaba's overseas subsidiaries, one manager at the credit card firms, one seller with more than five-year transaction history with Alibaba, and one government officer in charge of online business.
