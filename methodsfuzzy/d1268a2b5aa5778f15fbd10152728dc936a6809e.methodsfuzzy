Simulation. REMD simulations were performed with the CHARMM simulation package (49) using the recently updated CHARMM27 nucleic acid force field (31, 32) and the MMTSB (50) tool set. Each REMD simulation comprised 40 replicas exponentially distributed over a temperature range from 278 K to 330 K, resulting in an average exchange acceptance ratio of 30%. Each replica was first equilibrated for 0.5 ns, restraining nucleotide heavy atoms, and subsequently run without any restraints for 10 ns, with exchange moves attempted every 0.5 ps. Both WT and A29C RNAs were initially built in an ideal A-form helical configuration and served as the starting conformation in every simulation of REMD. The RNA was solvated in an 80-Å cubic box of pre-equilibrated TIP3P water (approximately 50 000 atoms). Twelve pairs of sodium chloride with an additional 11 sodium ions were added to the box, corresponding to the experimental ionic concentration of 40 mM. Analysis. We utilized the last 5 ns of the REMD trajectory at 298 K for the following analysis. Base stacking energies were defined as the electrostatic and van der Waals interaction energies between the adjacent bases. The molecular orientation was expressed by the order parameters S 2 of the C-H bond vectors employing the model-free approach of Lipari and Szabo (51) . After a translational and rotational fit of each RNA snapshot to the ideal A-form helical structure, the order parameters were taken from the plateau phase of the correlation function, given by where P 2 is the second order Legendre polynomial and * is the unit vector along the C-H dipole. Additionally, from the atomic coordinates we constructed the RDC values by first orienting an idealized A-form ssRNA helix into the principal axis system determined from the order tensor analysis of the experimental RDCs. Each frame of the trajectory was superimposed with this ideal helix followed by calculating the average of , 3 cos 2 À1 D E , where is the angle between a given bond vector (e.g. C1 0 H1 0 ) and the z-axis. The RDC values were then scaled by À82/r 3 , in which r is the C-H bond length and a factor of À82 is applied to shift the computed RDCs to the same scale as the NMR values. The average structure of the ssRNA was calculated as the structure with the minimal root-mean-square deviations from all RNA conformations in the 5 ns REMD trajectory.
