To detect SARS-CoV in stool, urine, and respiratory specimens, we performed reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), using primers targeted to the polymerase and nucleocapsid genes of the SARS-CoV genome, as described elsewhere (2, Emery et al., unpub data). Stool samples were prepared as 10% extracts in Tris-HCl buffer before isolation of total nucleic acid for RT-PCR testing. To quantify the virus load in respiratory and stool specimens, quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the TaqMan assay and standard curves generated from synthetic RNA transcripts (S. S. Monroe and R. S. Beard, unpub. data). Previously described culture techniques (2) were used to isolate SARS-CoV from specimens. To determine the S and N gene sequences of SARS-CoV, a set of 10 overlapping RT-PCR products, which cover the entire open reading frames of the S (8 products) and N (2 products) genes, were generated by using the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced by using 16 (S gene) or 7 (N gene) sequencing primers (S. Tong et al, unpub. data). Serum specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-associated antibodies by use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and an indirect fluorescent antibody test, using previously described methods (2) . Serum specimens were considered positive only if results for both tests were positive using predetermined cut-offs (2).
