Three rabbit were firstly shaved the right waist fur, and then placed in the left lying position; the needling site was positioned 1.5 cm laterally away from the right side of the spinous process of spine-iliac connection, and then one needle punctured 2-2.5 cm so as to break through the intertransverse ligament and enter the intergroove of right greater psoas muscle. After confirmed the position accuracy using X-ray, 1 ml of iohexol was then injected, and then computed tomography (CT) was performed to check the distribution of the contrast agent within the intergroove of right greater psoas muscle, and the depth was also recorded. Another three rabbits were then selected and performed the positioning using the same method, with the depth referring to the average depth obtained in the first time experiment, during which period the sense of breaking through should also be reviewed; 2.5 ml and 5.0 ml of Methylthioninium Chloride (MC) were then injected, respectively. The rabbits were then euthanized using propofol and dissected so as to inspect the location and distribution of MC. Once it was confirmed distributing within the intergroove of right greater psoas muscle, and the distribution of lumbosacral plexus block (LPB) can be seen, it can confirm the consistency of the two positioning methods (Fig. 1) . The rabbits of hte two groups were placed in the left lying position, positioned, and then medicated into the intergroove of right greater psoas muscle; the muscle strength of lower extremities were then observed and classified according to the human muscular strength classification. The final concentrations for LPB were as follows: lidocaine 0.5%, VB12 50 lg/ml, TRI 2 mg/ml. The doses and injection times of hte four groups: group A1: 2.5 ml Â 2 times, group A2 2.5 ml Â 4 times, group B1 5 ml Â 2 times, and group B2 5 ml Â 4 times, with the injection interval is 5 days.
