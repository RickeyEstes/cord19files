Detection and quantification of S. pneumoniae. Samples and standard reference control strains were extracted and concentrated by NucliSENS 1 EasyMag 1 (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) from an initial sample volume of 400 μL to an elution volume of 110 μL. Five micro liters of the DNA extract were added to the PCR reaction mix. A duplex real-time PCR targeting the lytA gene of S. pneumoniae and the internal control targeting RNaseP of human cells was performed. Sequence of primers and probes recommended by CDC for both the pathogen and the internal control were used (http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/lab-manual/ chpt10-pcr.html). DNA was amplified with the Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, CA, US). Determination of PCR efficiency and the calibration curve for DNA quantification. A calibration curve correlating DNA pneumococcal load with cycle threshold value was performed by using reference strain S. pneumoniae R6. Given that genome-copy number is less variable than colony forming unit (CFU) for establishing standards [27] , loads were quantified in genome-copy number which is about 2-logs higher than CFU. The calibration curve was generated by extracting the genomic DNA from an original suspension of S. pneumoniae R6 strain (OD 595 = 0.5) and performing 10-fold serial dilutions that ranged from 10 8 to 10 2 copies per mL (cp/mL). Pneumococcal serotyping. Capsular typing of pneumococci was directly performed in lytA positive samples without culture by multiplex PCR combined with automated fluorescence capillary electrophoresis according to a previous method published by our group [28] . Other non-detectable serotypes by this technique were classified as indistinguishable serotypes and were considered non-invasive for studying invasiveness potential. Patients with indistinguishable serotypes were excluded from the analysis of pneumococcal co-colonization as it was not possible to assess the number of non-identified colonizing serotypes in those subjects Detection of respiratory viruses. Detection of influenza A, B, C, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, human parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, 4, human rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus was performed according to previously published studies [29, 30] . Determination of HIV and malaria status. HIV-1 serodiagnosis was performed using a sequential testing algorithm with two rapid HIV-1 antibody tests (Determine 1 and Unigold 1 ). HIV-infection was confirmed when necessary by an HIV-1 DNA Amplicor test (version 1.5, Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Branchburg, NJ, US) while thick and thin blood films were processed and examined according to standard methods for malaria diagnosis [31] .
