This was a cross-sectional survey among people aged â‰¥16 years and living in GCC countries, namely, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Oman. The survey was conducted as part of the Gulf Indicators (GI) smartphone app project. The GI is a smartphone app that was published in apple app store in November 2014, to be used as a research data collection platform for cross-sectional and cohort studies targeting users from the GCC countries. This survey was published on the GI platform from July to November 2015. Registered participants who have the app installed on their smartphone devices (voluntarily) received push-notifications (short messages [SMS]-like function) from the app inviting them to open the app and participate in the study, and also reminders were sent to those who did not complete the survey questions [12] . The app has 'built-in' location verification function to guarantee that only users from targeted countries are allowed to register. Each user has a unique device identifier linked to the research database so the user cannot submit any information more than once, and allow anonymous data collection. This method was tested successfully in previous studies [13] [14] [15] . After the first push-notification, a reminder was sent once every week to those who did not complete the survey questions. As the data were obtained electronically no user could submit their responses with missing vital information. Electronic informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. Data on socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents, perceptions regarding MERS-CoV, and understanding of its risk (24) from exposure to camels or their raw products were collected in a questionnaire. The questionnaire also assessed the respondents' adoption of protective behaviors including avoidance of contact with camels, consumption of raw camel milk and meat and adherence of using non-pharmaceutical behaviors such as facemask use and hand hygiene.
