APN expression and purification. Porcine APN ectodomain (residues 62-963) and human APN ecdomain (residues 66-967) were expressed and purified as previously described 31 . Briefly, APN ectodomains containing N-terminal honeybee-melittin signal peptide and C-terminal His 6 tag were expressed in insect cells, secreted to cell culture medium, and purified sequentially on Ni-NTA column and gel-filtration column.
