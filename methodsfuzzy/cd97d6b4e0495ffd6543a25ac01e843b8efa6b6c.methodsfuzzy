Single-molecule data analysis. For force-ramp data, unfolding traces were characterized and unfolding rupture force and extension changes of 1-step unfolding transitions were measured. An approach described by Dudko et al. was  where ̇( ) is the force loading rate at force F, p(F) is the probability density of unfolding events at force F, ∫ ( ) ∞ is the probability of unfolding events above F, hk is the height of k th bin in the unfolding force distribution histogram that start at F0, ∆F is the bin size of the histogram, i and k are the bin numbers, and N is the total bin number of the histogram. Standard errors were estimated as described previously. 2 Bell's model (Eq. 2) was used to fit the force-dependent kinetics. 3 ln ( ) = ln 0 + ‡ (2) Here, k(F) is the force-dependent reaction rate, k0 (or k(0 pN)) is the reaction rate at zero force, X ‡ is the extension change from the initial state of the reaction to the transition state, β is equal to (kB•T) −1 , in which kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is absolute temperature (295 K). More complex models 1 were also applied to fit the force-dependent kinetics data but did not yield reliable fitting parameters. For constant-force data, the distributions of the extension values were fit with Gaussian model to get the extension change values upon (un)folding. 4 The extensible wormlike chain model (EWLC) (Eq. 3) was used to convert the extension change values to number of nucleotides Here, kB is Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature (295 K), P is persistence length, L0 is contour length, and K is stretch modulus. For ssRNA, L0, P and K are 0.59 nm per nucleotide, 1 nm, and 1500 pN, respectively, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The lengths of the SRV-1 pseudoknot based on the NMR structure of SF206 (PDB 1E95) (4 nm) 11 and the diameter of a hairpin (2 nm) were taken into consideration.
