Viruses and cell cultures. MHV-A59 (MHV) was grown on 17Cl-1 cells, and the titers of the virus on HeLa cells expressing CEACAM1 (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1), the MHV receptor (51), were determined as previously described (52) . The cells were infected with MHV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 or, as a control, with 100 hemagglutination activity units of Sendai virus (SenV) (Cantell strain; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). 17Cl-1 cells were cultured in medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FBS), 5% tryptose phosphate, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. In some experiments, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) were transfected with 20 g/ml poly(I · C) (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). In some experiments, mock-infected or MHV-infected BMM, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC), or 17Cl-1 cells were treated with 800 U of murine IFN-␤ (PBL Biomedical Laboratories, Piscataway, NJ) at 4 h p.i., and either cells (mRNA) or supernatants (protein) were harvested at 8 h or 16 h p.i. Mice. Pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD). Mice deficient in IFN-␣/␤ receptor expression (IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ ) or in MyD88 expression (MyD88 Ϫ/Ϫ ) were kindly provided by John Harty (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) or by Shizuo Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) and Madhu Singh (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA), respectively. Generation of BMM and BMDC. Primary bone marrow cells were isolated from the hind limbs of WT, IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ , or MyD88 Ϫ/Ϫ C57BL/6 mice as previously described (32) . BMM were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% L929 cell-conditioned medium (as a source for macrophage colony-stimulating factor [M-CSF]), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were harvested 7 days after plating and were Ͼ90% pure (CD11b ϩ CD11c -), as determined by flow cytometry. BMDC were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1.0 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillinstreptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.02 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1,000 U/ml recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), and 25 U/ml recombinant interleukin-4 (IL-4) (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). The cells were used after 7 days of culture and were Ͼ80% pure (CD11b ϩ CD11c ϩ ) as determined by flow cytometry. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. RNA was isolated from BMM, BMDC, or 17Cl-1 cells using Trizol (Invitrogen). The levels of mRNA of genes of interest were determined by real-time qPCR as previously described (43) . Primers are listed in Table 1 . Cycle threshold (C T ) values were normalized to the values for the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) by the following equation: C T ϭ C T (gene of interest) Ϫ C T (HPRT) . All results are shown as a ratio to HPRT calculated as Ϫ2 C T . IFN bioassay. The levels of IFN were measured using a bioassay based on the inhibition of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) growth in L929 cells. Supernatants were harvested from infected BMM or BMDC, and infectious virus was inactivated by exposure to UV light. L929 cells infected with 10,000 PFU VSV were treated with dilutions of supernatants or defined amounts of recombinant murine IFN-␤ at 30 min p.i. The titers of VSV were determined on Vero cells. IFN levels were calculated on the basis of standard curves generated with recombinant IFN-␤. ELISA. To measure the protein levels of cytokines of interest, supernatants were harvested from mock-infected or MHV-infected BMM or BMDC and analyzed for CXCL10 (PBL Biomedical Laboratory) or IL-12 p70 or TNF (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) by an ELISA per the manufacturer's instructions. Statistics. A Student's t test was used to analyze differences in mean values between groups. All results are expressed as means Ϯ standard errors of the means (SEM). P values of Ͻ0.05 were considered statistically significant.
