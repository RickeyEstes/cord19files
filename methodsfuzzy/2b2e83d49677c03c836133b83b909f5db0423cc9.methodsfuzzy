Data used in this study were from a separate study performed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BRD susceptibility. The original genetic marker research was a case-control study in which clinically ill cases were pair-matched to clinically healthy controls. The study was approved by the University of California, Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number 16431, approval date March 30, 2011).
