Our literature review was based on the five stages of systemic review proposed by [52] , which entails five phases: • Planning the review-reported in Section 2; • Identifying and evaluating studies-reported in Section 2; • Extracting and synthesizing data-reported in Section 3; • Reporting descriptive findings-reported in Section 3; and • Utilizing the findings to inform research and practicereported in Section 4. Our review of the 51 papers suggests the following. A number of researchers do not necessarily mention the term KM or KMS in the context of working with (design/ implementation/assessment) of EMIS in relation to disaster management. In this regard, we call for a closer alignment between EMIS and KMS, given that at times, the objectives of both EMIS-and KMS-driven systems are similar in the area of supporting disaster/emergency management. In terms of use, the papers focused on emergency response and rescue (Table 5 ). Another popular use is for decision support. Very few papers describe EMIS-KMS use for pre-disaster stages, such as training, preparedness, mitigation, and prevention. We also find that although the majority of the authors have conducted an exploratory and experimental case study method, a limitation exists on action research that aims to solve real problems by introducing change into the social setting (Table 14) . Hence, more work can be done in this area. In the disaster context, access is needed for a wide range of real-time information and knowledge that requires coordination. Therefore, knowledge management systems can play a pivotal role in enhancing disaster efforts that allow more use of data and faster actions.
