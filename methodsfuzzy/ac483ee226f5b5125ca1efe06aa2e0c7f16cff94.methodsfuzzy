Documenting the relationship between general urbanization and HPAI in poultry can be done qualitatively (e.g. Finucane, Nghiem, et al., 2014) or quantitatively (e.g. Saksena et al., 2015) ; since one of our goals is to provide precise policy recommendations at a national level, we have used the latter approach. The data discussed here were made possible by National Science Foundation (grant # 0909410) and facilitated through close collaboration with Vietnam's Ha Noi University of Agriculture. Vietnam has a strong, national-scale data collection and monitoring history that allows for a national-scale analysis of H5N1 outbreaks that includes extensive human-scale data agglomerated into spatial communities. For these two reasons, our empirical study of the socio-ecological factors of H5N1 emergence uses Vietnam as a case study. Moreover, we use multivariate logistic regression of spatial units of analysis as has been effectively used by planners in urban economics (e.g. Dowall, 1996) and urban public health (e.g. Weimann, Dai, & Oni, 2016) . Unlike an ordinary least squares regression, logistic regression can accurately assess the correlates of a binary variable of whether an outbreak occurred or not. A multivariate logistic regression (MLR) will produce a set of odds ratios that describe the likelihood of a binary event occurring. An odds ratio (OR) of 1 indicates that an independent variable (IV) has no detectable impact on the likelihood of an outbreak, while an OR of 0.30 means that for every full unit increase of the IV, there is a 70% reduction in the likelihood of that outbreak occurring. An OR of 1.30 means that there is a 30% increase in likelihood that the outbreak would occur. The regression of secondary data by spatial aggregation requires the matching of multiple data sources in space and time, as well as careful attention to regional differences and aggregation scale issues that could influence data interpretation.
