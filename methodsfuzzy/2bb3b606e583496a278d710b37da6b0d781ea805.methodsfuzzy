Available time series data for the monthly reported cases of 28 class B infectious diseases were gathered for the years 2005-2014. These 28 class B infectious diseases are AIDS, anthrax, avian influenza, brucellosis, cerebrospinal meningitis, dengue fever, diphtheria, dysentery, gonorrhoea, hepatitis disease (including hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), and other types of hepatitis), haemorrhagic fever, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, malaria, measles, neonatal tetanus, pertussis, polio, rabies, scarlet fever, schistosomiasis, syphilis, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever. The data were reported by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The incidences of these diseases are shown in Figure 1 . A descriptive study was first performed, and decomposition methods were used to extract the underlying pattern in the infectious disease time series. The decomposition methods have been reported in previous studies. 6, 8 Decomposition breaks down the underlying patterns of time series into seasonality and longterm trends. The seasonal trend in the infection series can be expressed using seasonal indices. To calculate the seasonal factors, overall incidences are first averaged, and then the averaged incidence is divided by the mean incidence for each month. For example, the average incidence of malaria was 0.1344/100 000 during the 10 years and the mean incidence in May was 0.1059/ 100 000, thus the seasonal index for May is 0.788 (0.1344/0.1059). Seasonality shows the periodic fluctuations that are usually caused by known factors such as rainfall, temperature, timing of the holidays, etc. If the seasonal index is greater than 1, it means that the incidence is higher than the average level. Otherwise, it means that the incidence is lower than the average level. The trend cycle represents the long-term changes in the infection. After the seasonal indices have been calculated, one can deseasonalize the data by dividing by the corresponding index. A linear regression model is a simple way to express the long-term trend, in which a common linear regression model is established between the deseasonalized incidence and time t.
