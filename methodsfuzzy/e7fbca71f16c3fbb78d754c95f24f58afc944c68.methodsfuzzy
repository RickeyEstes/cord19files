The ARIMA model includes autoregressive (AR) model, moving average (MA) model, and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model [2] . The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) [3] unit-root test helps in estimating whether the time series is stationary. Log transformation and differences are the preferred approaches to stabilize the time series [4] . Seasonal and nonseasonal differences were used to stabilize the term trend and periodicity. Parameters of the ARIMA model were estimated by autocorrelation function (ACF) graph and partial autocorrelation (PACF) correlogram. To determine the prevalence of COVID-2019, ARIMA (1,0,4) was selected as the best ARIMA model, while ARIMA (1,0,3) was selected as the best ARIMA model for determining the incidence of COVID-2019.

An Excel file with data has been uploaded. Parameters for data collection Parameters used for ARIMA were model ARIMA (1,2,0) and ARIMA (1,0,4) Description of data collection The daily prevalence data of COVID-2019 from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected from the official website of Johns Hopkins university (https://gisanddata. maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html), and Excel 2019 was used to build a time-series database. Descriptive analysis of the data was performed, and to evaluate the incidence of new confirmed cases of COVID-2019 and to prevent eventual bias, the difference between the cases confirmed on that day and the cases confirmed on the previous day were calculated D(X n -X n-1 ).
