Three African green monkey kidney epithelial cell lines, Vero 76, Vero E6, and MA104 (embryonic), were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) [23] . Vero 76 and MA104 cells were routinely grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and Vero E6 cells were maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% MEM non-essential amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO) and 1 mM of sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich). Calu-3 cells are a human lung epithelial cell line originating from a human pulmonary adenocarcinoma and, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20% FBS (D-20) [24] . SARS-CoV, strain Urbani (200300592), was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC, Atlanta, GA). The strain was propagated and titrated in Vero 76 cells. For antiviral assays, the serum was reduced to 2% and gentamicin added to the medium at a final concentration of 50 lg/ml. Stock solutions of IFN-alfacon 1 (InterMune, Inc., Brisbane, CA) were made at a concentration of 27 lg/ml and stored at À20°C. IFN-alfacon 1 was solubilized in MEM for in vitro experiments. The neutral red (NR) uptake assay for determination of antiviral efficacy and compound cytotoxicity was used for in vitro evaluation [13] . The cells were seeded to the 96-well tissue culture plate (Corning Incorporated Costa, NY) in 0.1 ml at 2 Â 10 5 cells/ml 1 day before, and treated with IFN-alfacon 1 at different concentrations. Then, the cells were infected with SARS-CoV isolate at the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) from 0.0007 to 0.003. Compound and virus were added in equal volumes (0.1 ml). The plates were incubated at 37°C for 3 days until the cells in the virus control wells showed complete viral cytopathic effect (CPE) by light microscopy. Each concentration of compound was assayed for inhibition of viral CPE in triplicate and for cytotoxicity in duplicate. Six wells per plate were set aside as uninfected, untreated cell controls and six wells per plate received virus only and represented controls for virus replication. At 3 days post virus exposure, the cells were scored for percent CPE or for cytotoxicity by microscopic observation. The values obtained were converted to percents of untreated, uninfected controls. The 50% cell cytotoxic doses (CC 50 ) and 50% virus inhibitory doses (IC 50 ), representing the putative concentration at which 50% of the monolayers would show compound cytotoxicity or virus cytopathic effect, respectively, were estimated by regression analysis. A selectivity index (SI) was calculated using the formula: SI = CC 50 /IC 50 . The activity in the CPE assay was then verified spectrophotometrically by NR uptake assay on the same plate. The NR assay was performed using a modified method of Cavanaugh et al. [25] as described by Barnard et al. [13] . Briefly, NR dye was added to each well of the plate, and the plate incubated for approximately 2 h at 37°C in the dark. The NR solution was removed from the wells, rinsed and any remaining dye extracted using ethanol buffered with Sörenson's citrate buffer. The plates were read at 405/540 nanometers (nm) wavelength with a microplate reader (Opsys MR TM , Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). Absorbance values were expressed as percents of untreated controls and IC 50 , CC 50 , and SI values were calculated as described above. Virus yield reduction assay is more sensitive assay to confirm the results of the NR uptake assay. Infectious virus yield from the CPE inhibition assay were determined on the supernatant from the test well as previously described [13] . Sample wells at each compound concentration tested were pooled and titered in Vero 76 cells for infectious virus by CPE assay as previously described by Barnard et al. [26] . A 90% reduction in virus yield (IC 90 ) was then calculated by linear regression analysis. This represented a one-log 10 inhibition in titer when compared to untreated virus controls.
