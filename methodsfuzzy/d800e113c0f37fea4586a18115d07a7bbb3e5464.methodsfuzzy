Cell culture, viruses and plasmids. Vero cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Richmond, VA, USA) and cultured at 37 1C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine. WSL-R line 379, a macrophage cell line of wild swine origin that was kindly provided by Günther Kiel (Friedrich-Loeffler Institut, Greifswald, Germany), was grown in Iscove's medium (Gibco-BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) plus F-12 nutrient mixture (Gibco) plus 10% FBS. Where indicated, cells were treated with 1 mg/ml Staurosporine (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), or with 10 mg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) or 2.5 mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich) as a positive control of ER stress. The Vero-adapted ASFV isolate BA71V was used. For flow cytometry (FACS) analyses we used an infectious recombinant ASFV, B54GFP-2, which expresses and incorporates into the virus particle a chimera of the p54 envelope protein fused to the EGFP. 41 Preparation of viral stocks, titrations and infection experiments were carried out in Vero cells as previously described. 42 The plasmid pCMVshort-EGFP-ATF6a was kindly provided by Dr. Mori (Kyoto University, Japan) 32 and was transfected into Vero cells using Fugene 6 (Roche Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), following the manufacturer's protocols. Western blotting. Cells seeded in 24-well plates were harvested in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min at 95 1C, resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked with skimmed milk in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated with the specific primary and the HRP (Horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibody. Bands obtained after development with ECL reagent (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) were detected using a Chemidoc XRS imaging system (Bio-Rad). Antibodies used for western blotting included the following: rabbit polyclonal antibody to calreticulin (ab2907 abcam, Cambridge, UK) at a dilution of 1 : 3000; rabbit polyclonal antibody to calnexin (StressGen, San Diego, CA, USA) 1 : 3000; rabbit polyclonal to Bap31 (ab37120 abcam) 1 : 3000; rabbit polyclonal antibody to ERp57 (ab10287 abcam) 1 : 1000; goat polyclonal to GADD34 (ab9869 abcam) 1 : 1000; rabbit polyclonal antibody GADD153/CHOP (F-168) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) 1 : 200; rabbit polyclonal antibody to GRP78 (BiP) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 1 : 200; rabbit polyclonal antibody to ATF4 (ab85049) 1 : 500 mouse monoclonal antibody to PDI (ab2792 abcam) 1 : 1000; antib-actin (Sigma, St Louis, MI, USA) 1 : 1500; anti-ASFV p30 monoclonal antibody 1 : 1000; and anti-p72 monoclonal antibody clone 18BG3 (Ingenasa, Madrid, Spain) 1 : 5000. The following secondary antibodies were used: goat anti-rabbit IgG HPR conjugate (Bio-Rad) and sheep anti-mouse IgG HPR conjugate (GE Healthcare), observing the manufacturer's instructions. Band densitometry was performed with TINA image analysis software and data were normalized to control values. Caspase activity assays. Using fluorimetric caspase 3, 8 and 9 assay kits (Sigma-Aldrich), the activity of caspases 3, 8 and 9, respectively, were measured at a range of times post-infection in Vero cells and in WSL-R cells infected with ASFV at a multiplicity of 1 pfu/cell. Caspase 12 activity was determined using a fluorimetric caspase 12 assay kit (Biovision, Mountain View, CA, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. FACS analyses. Vero cells were pretreated with inhibitors at the indicated concentrations in growth medium for 1 h at 37 1C, followed by infection with ASFV B54GFP-2 recombinant virus at a moi of 1 pfu/ml. After 24 hpi cells were washed with PBS, harvested by trypsinization, and then washed with FACS buffer (PBS, 0.01% sodium azide, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. In order to determine the percentage of infected cells per condition, 10 000 cells/time point were scored and analyzed in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Sciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Untreated control infected cultures yielded 25-30% of infected cells from the total cells examined. Infected cell percentages obtained after drug treatments were normalized to values found in control plates. Immunofluorescence. Cells seeded on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate were infected with ASFV. At several time points after virus infection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X 100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were consecutively stained with primary and secondary antibodies and then incubated with Topro-3 (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) 1/1000 in PBS1X for DNA staining. After washing, coverslips were finally mounted on glass plates and cells were observed under a Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope (Leica-Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The primary antibodies used were: rabbit polyclonal antibody to GRP78 (BiP) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 1 : 50, rabbit polyclonal antibody to caspase 12 (BioVision) diluted 1 : 25 and anti-ASFV p30 monoclonal antibody 1 : 100. Antirabbit IgG Alexa 488 and anti-mouse IgG Alexa 594-conjugated antibodies (Invitrogen) diluted to 1 : 200 were used as secondary antibodies respectively. RNA preparation and RT-PCR analysis for XBP1. Total RNA from cultured cells was isolated with TRI-Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription reactions (RT-PCR) were carried out using the SuperScript One Step RT-PCR (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used were: forward primer: 5 0 -CCTTGTAGTTGAGAAC CAGG-3 0 and reverse primer 5 0 -GGGGCTTGGTATATATGTGG-3 0 . Amplification conditions included an initial step of 45 1C for 30 s, followed by a denaturation step of 94 1C for 2 min, 30 cycles of 94 1C for 30 s, 55 1C for 30 s and 70 1C for 30 s. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel and stained with SYBR Green. For quantitative PCR, cDNA was synthesized using the QuantiTect Reverse Trancription kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. After heat inactivation at 95 1C, cDNA levels were quantified by using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Amplification was performed in a Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Life Sciences, Sydney, Australia) using a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Primer sets used for 18S and XBP1 are available from Qiagen (QuantiTect Primer Assay). Fold change was calculated using the DDCT method of relative quantification with 18S rRNA as the endogenous control for normalization. 43 Melting curves were used to verify the specificities of products. Data analysis. One-way analysis of variance was performed using INSTAT 3 for Windows. For multiple comparisons, Dunnet's correction was applied. Data are presented as means ± S.D. Differences were considered statistically significant at a P-value ofo0.05.
