The methods applied in this study have been split in four different stages: evaluation of literature, patents, clinical trials, and registered GM and non-GM vaccines. Each stage was individually examined in detail and the complete data set was compiled. These stages were decided upon in order to provide a complete overview of the genetically modified (GM) vector-based vaccine pipeline and market.
