Native and recombinant antigen production. For the production of nASP, helminth-naive calves were infected with 200,000 O. ostertagi infective larvae (L3) and euthanized 3 weeks later to collect adult worms from the abomasum. Adult worms were cultured, and excretory-secretory proteins collected from the culture supernatant as previously described 17 . The ASP sub-fraction was purified from total adult ES material by thiol-sepharose chromatography, followed by anion exchange chromatography 17 . The protein profile of the obtained material was checked by separation on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing/denaturing conditions and visualized by Coomassie blue staining. Reduction of nASP was achieved by incubating nASP with 7.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 15 minutes at 60 °C. Afterwards, the nASP was incubated in iodo acetamide (IAA) at 37 °C for an additional 30 minutes followed by a dialysis against 150 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Recombinant ASP was produced in Pichia pastoris as previously described 36 and will be referred to as pASP. Immunization experiments in cattle. All Denmark) per immunization. All animals were challenged with a trickle infection of 25,000 L3 larvae (1000 L3/ day; 5 days/week, during 5 weeks), which started at the day of the third immunization. Calves from study 1 were euthanized 3 weeks after the last infection, while the animals from study 2 were euthanized immediately after the last infection. Parasitological parameters (i.e. FEC and worm counts) were analysed as described in previous trials 13, 16 . Additionally, in study 2, abomasal LNs, abomasal epithelium and lamina propria were also isolated at time of necropsy. Immunization experiments in mice. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the E.U. Animal Welfare Directives and VICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and ethical approval to conduct the studies were obtained from the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University (EC 2014/33 and EC 2014/104). Thirty-six 8-week-old C57BL/6N mice (Harlan laboratories) were divided into 6 groups of 6 animals each and immunized three times in a 3-week interval intramuscularly in the thigh muscle. Control groups received 20 μ g of QuilA or Al(OH) 3 (same volume as used in the antigen-vaccinated group) per immunization. Groups that included antigen in the vaccine formulation received either 5 μ g of nASP, pASP or reduced-nASP in combination with 20 μ g of QuilA adjuvant, while the last group received 5 μ g of nASP in combination with an equal volume of Al(OH) 3 per immunization. At time of necropsy (one week after the third immunization), spleens and blood from the retro-orbital vein were collected for cellular and humoral analyses.
