Ethics statement. All animal experimental protocols were performed in accordance with the UK Home Office guidelines and under license for experiments involving regulated procedures on animals protected under the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The experiments were performed in the Home Office licensed animal facilities of The Pirbright Institute, formerly the Institute for Animal Health (IAH), Compton, Newbury, United Kingdom, using specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Rhode Island Red (RIR) chickens and embryonated eggs obtained from the IAH Poultry Production Unit (PPU). Serial in ovo passaging. A pathogenic strain of IBV belonging to the Massachusetts serotype lineage GI-1, M41-CK (23), at 2.6 ϫ 10 4 PFU in 100 l of serum-free N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2aminoethanesulfonic acid (BES) medium, was inoculated into the allantoic cavities of four 10-day-old embryonated SPF RIR chicken eggs (A, B, C, and D). After a 24-h incubation, embryos were candled and culled by refrigeration for a minimum of 4 h. Allantoic fluid was then harvested, centrifuged at 700 ϫ g for 5 min to clarify supernatant, and stored at Ϫ80°C. For subsequent passages, up to a total of 106, the allantoic fluid was diluted with BES medium between 1:100 and 1:10,000 based on visual inspection of the condition of the embryo and inoculated into the allantoic cavity, one egg per lineage, with each lineage remaining independent from each other. Allantoic fluid was routinely screened for presence of IBV by RT-PCR amplification of the 3= UTR, using oligonucleotides BG56 (5=-CAACAGCGCCCAAAGAAG-3=) and 93/100 (5=-GCTCTAACTCTATACTAGCCT-3=). After routine screening at passage 14, lineage B could no longer be detected. At this passage allantoic fluid from lineage A was used to infect two eggs, A and A1, which remained independent for the duration of the experiment. The disappearance of lineage B could have been caused by multiple factors, both biological and procedural, and was not investigated any further, as it is known in the field that the loss of virus during egg passaging is not uncommon. Where lineages A to D are described, this refers to lineages A, A1, C, and D. In vitro characterization using chicken kidney cells. Chicken kidney (CK) cells were prepared from 2-to 3-week-old SPF RIR chickens (26) . Confluent monolayers of CK cells in six-well plates were infected with viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 in triplicate for each time point. Following attachment for 1 h at 37°C with 5% CO 2 , cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 3 ml of BES-containing medium was added to each well, and cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Supernatant was harvested at 1, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h postinfection and assayed in triplicate for progeny virus by plaque assay using CK cells. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's multiple-comparison tests against the M41-CK virulent parent was performed using GraphPad Prism for Windows (version 8). In vitro characterization using tracheal organ cultures. Chicken tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) were prepared from 19-day-old SPF RIR embryos (27) . Groups of 11 TOCs were infected with 5 ϫ 10 4 PFU of IBV or mock infected with medium. Cultures were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in a rotating incubator, topped up with 500 l of medium, and returned to a 37°C rotating incubator. The level of ciliary activity of each TOC was determined on days 4 to 8 postinoculation by light microscopy and scored as follows: Ϸ100% activity ϭ 4, Ϸ75% ϭ 3, Ϸ50% ϭ 2, Ϸ25% ϭ 1, and Ϸ0% ϭ 0. The assessor was blinded to the experimental group. Two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple-comparison tests against the M41-CK virulent parent was performed using GraphPad Prism for Windows (version 8). In vivo analysis of the IBVs. In vivo virus pathogenicity assessments were performed in a series of three separate experiments. Study of lineages A and C was performed in separate investigations, while A1 and D were assessed in a joint study. Groups of 12 8-day-old SPF RIR chicks were inoculated with 1 ϫ 10 5 PFU of virus or mock infected with PBS via the ocular and nasal routes. The chickens were housed in positive-pressure, HEPA-filtered isolation rooms, and each group was housed in a separate room. Assessment of pathogenicity. The IBV-associated clinical signs used to determine pathogenicity were snicking, tracheal rales (a sound emanating from the bronchi, also detected by vibrations when holding a chick), and ciliary activity of the trachea. Chicks were observed daily between days 3 and 7 postinoculation. Snicks were counted by two persons over 2 min. Birds were checked individually for the presence of tracheal rales. Tracheas were removed from three randomly selected chickens from each group on days 4 and 6 postinfection for assessment of ciliary activity. Ten 1-mm sections were cut from three different regions of each trachea (three sections from the proximal, four from the middle, and three sections from the distal region). The level of ciliostasis of each tracheal section was determined by light microscopy; the assessor was blinded to the experimental group. Remaining birds were euthanized by a schedule one method on day 7 postinoculation and tissues harvested postmortem. A two-way ANOVA statistical test performed using GraphPad Prism for Windows (version 8) followed by Tukey pairwise comparison was used to determine significance. Detection of viral RNA. Trachea stored in RNAlater was freeze-thawed and homogenized using the TissueLyser II (Qiagen) for 2 min at 25 Hz. Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) by following the manufacturer's animal tissue protocol with on-column DNase treatment. The RNA isolated from tracheas extracted during the experiment to assess the pathogenicity of lineage A was screened for the presence of IBV using a Precision OneStep (PrimerDesign) quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. No-template controls and positive controls provided in the kit were included in each qRT-PCR assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were considered to contain IBV RNA if the threshold cycle (C T ) value was greater than 17, the lower limit of detection. cDNA was synthesized from RNA isolated from tracheas extracted during the experiments to assess the pathogenicity of lineages A1, C, and D using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen by Life Technologies) with a random oligonucleotide primer as per the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was screened for the presence of IBV sequence by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen by Life Technologies) and primers M20 (5=-GGAATGGGCATAATAAGG-3=) and M23 (5=-CACTGCTACCCCGTAC CCG-3=) in nsp8 and nsp12, respectively. A positive control known to contain IBV RNA and a no-template negative control were used at the reverse transcription and PCR stages. Growth of viral stocks for sequencing. As required for 454 pyrosequencing, stocks of each of the five viruses were grown in order to obtain sufficient purified RNA. To generate these stocks, 10 10-day-old embryonated SPF RIR chicken eggs per virus were infected with 100 l of IBV-infected allantoic fluid (diluted 1:10,000 with BES medium) and incubated as detailed previously. Stocks of both the starting (M41-CK) and final (lineages A to D, passage 106) viral populations were grown for sequencing. Allantoic fluid from each viral group was pooled and centrifuged to clarify supernatant. Deep sequencing and sample preparation. Partial purification of IBV and isolation of viral RNA for deep sequencing were performed as previously described (28) . Briefly, IBV-infected allantoic fluid was purified by ultracentrifugation and the resulting virus pellet was resuspended in TRIzol reagent. RNA was extracted from supernatant as per the manufacturer's instructions and quantified by NanoDrop assay. Samples were then sent to the Centre of Genomic Research (CGR), University of Liverpool, UK, for library preparation and sequencing. cDNA libraries were generated according to the GS FLX Titanium cDNA Rapid Library Preparation Method Manual (29) and sequenced using a GS FLX with Titanium Series and run protocol. Analysis of deep sequencing data and generation of a representative M41-CK consensus sequence. Matching FASTA and QUAL files were consolidated to FASTQ format for each virus, and read quality was assessed using FastQC (30) . Reads were quality trimmed using PRINSEQ v0.20.4 (31) with the following parameters: minimum length ϭ 100, minimum quality mean ϭ 25, maximum NS ϭ 0, and trim quality right ϭ 25. M41-CK quality-filtered reads were aligned to GenBank accession number AY851295.1 using bowtie2 v2.2.9 (32) with reads inputted as unpaired. All other settings were set as default. A consensus sequence was generated from this alignment where indel mutations were permitted and a minimum coverage of 10 reads was required for a nucleotide to be called (GenBank accession number MK728875). For positions where coverage was below this threshold, an ambiguity code, "N," placed instead. This consensus sequence was annotated (Fig. 3A ) according to information available (33, 34) and UniProtKB accession number P0C6Y3 (35) , where regions of highly similar sequences were identified. The annotations of AY851295.1 available from NCBI were not used in this instance. Quality-filtered reads for all five viruses were aligned to the M41-CK consensus sequence with bowtie2 (reads inputted as unpaired reads). As before, a consensus sequence for each of the final virus was generated with a minimum coverage threshold of 10. To ensure alignment to original sequence, indels were not permitted due to low confidence, as pyrosequencing is poor at resolving regions of low complexity. Minor variants were called for each virus using Lofreq* (version 2.1.2) (36) using default parameters. Variants were not called for positions where coverage was Ͻ10 reads. Comparison of shared mutations was performed using the Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Genomics webtool (http:// bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/) using position, reference nucleotide, and variant nucleotide as inputs. Data availability. The sequence was deposited in GenBank under accession number MK728875.
