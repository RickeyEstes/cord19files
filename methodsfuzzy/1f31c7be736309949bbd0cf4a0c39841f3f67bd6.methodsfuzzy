Species distribution modeling. The Maxent method is implemented as a function in the 'Dismo' package in R 63 . This method has recently become popular for predicting spatial distribution of infectious diseases of both public health and veterinary significance and has been described extensively elsewhere 64, 65 . We used the default logistic model, convergence threshold, regularization, and number of iterations. We used a Jackknife test to calculate the contribution of each environmental variable to the final Maxent model, and evaluated the performance of the candidate Maxent models by partitioning the data into training and testing sets and using the threshold independent method (TIm) 66 . We set the TIm k-fold partitioning scheme to create 5 partitions and randomly sample each partition with replacement, where our candidate Maxent model was tested five times (k = 5) against 10,000 randomly generated background points (pseudo-absences). Subsequently, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) through a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plot of the sensitivity vs. 1 -specificity over the whole range of threshold values between 0 and 1. We used training AUC for model building, whereas the testing sets to evaluate model accuracy using the average value of the AUC calculated for each partitioned set. AUC values >0.75 for both training and testing data were considered reliably discriminating models and indicated that the selected environmental layers were adequate predictors 67, 68 . Finally, because the geographic extent of the study area was fairly large, we used a calibrated AUC (cAUC) final Maxent model to evaluate the presence of the spatial sorting bias (SSB) as suggested elsewhere 69 . If the cAUC value was close to 1, then we concluded the absence of SSB (i.e. locations within the Midwest region with the highest number of observed outbreaks have a small impact on the resulted Maxent model), whereas if the value was close to zero, we concluded the opposite. We then plotted the spatial probability distribution of PRRSV outbreaks predicted by the final Maxent model (Fig. 1B) Preliminary phylogenetic analysis. We converted the collection date for each sequence into fractional years (decimal days) to estimate divergence times. Then, we aligned the ORF5 sequences using MUSCLE 70 and confirmed the reading frame by examining the amino-acid translation using AliView (Lorenz et al., 2011) . Finally, we found no homologous recombinant sequences using the Recombination Detection Program 71 . Next, we used PartitionFinder 72 to define the partitioning scheme of our alignment corresponding to the codon positions of the ORF5 protein-coding gene and we selected the most realistic partition schemes for the set of substitution models implemented in BEAST 1.8.4 43 for the subsequent analyses based on the value of Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Then, we estimated the maximum-likelihood (ML) of the phylogeny for all ORF5 sequences, using RAxML 73 , and examined the tree topology under the GTR + Î“ substitution model, with 100 non-parametric bootstrap replicate searches. Finally, we selected three well-supported phylogenetic clades, referred to as clades A, B and C, and ensured that each selected clade's spatial and temporal distribution well represented the geographical extent and period of the study (Fig. 2) . Clade A compromised 191 non-identical sequences collected between May 2009 and April 2016, clade B compromised 214 non-identical sequences collected between August 2006 and February 2016, and clade C compromised 187 non-identical sequences, collected between December 2008 and April 2016. Again, we performed RAxML analyses on each selected clade to compare the topology of the ML tree to the corresponding estimated topology of the posterior phylogeny in the subsequent Bayesian analyses ( Figure S1 ).
