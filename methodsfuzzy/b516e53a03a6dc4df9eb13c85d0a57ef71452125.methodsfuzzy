This protocol, which outlines methods for the proposed systematic review, was designed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines [17] . The protocol is registered in the PROSPERO database (#38051). The items of this protocol are presented in accordance with the PRISMA-P checklist (Additional file 1) [18] . The search strategy comprises three main components: Indigenous communities (population and exposure terms); and association between seasonal or meteorological parameters and ARI (outcome terms; Table 2 ). Terms that will be used to identify Indigenous peoples globally are based on a series of umbrella terms for Indigenous used globally and throughout time, adapted from Bartlett et al. [21] . Individual group names were added to the umbrella terms from two sources. First, the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA; www.iwgia.org) registry provides a continental directory of Indigenous peoples, further sorted as a country-bycountry list of recognized Indigenous groups. These terms may be at the greater population level, rather than individual group level if the category can be expected to represent and include all of the unique peoples groups within it (i.e., the name "Maori" was included in the search terms, but individual Maori group names, such as Ngati Kuri, Ngati Maru, and To Arawa, were not included). Secondly, the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) provides a country-by-country database of minority and Indigenous peoples (www.refworld.org). Since this list provides both Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples, only those groups explicitly listed as Indigenous were collected. The names of all identified groups defined as Indigenous were added to the search. When the two lists were complete, the lists were merged into one, alphabetized, and de-duplicated. The list of terms for Indigenous peoples is comprehensive to the best of the ability of this strategy. Searches of MeSH terms for "season," "meteorology," and "weather" were performed in PubMed ® and used to compile terms for the search strategy. Terms that will be used to identify ARI outcomes in the literature include any pathogen known to primarily cause ARI (i.e., enteric pathogens that rarely cause ARI are not included) based on the Medical Microbiology 4th Edition, Chapter 93, online version [22] . Any terms used for ARI by the Lung Disease Alphabetical Listing generated by the American Lung Association (www.lung.org) were added to the search strategy. A search of MeSH terms for "respiratory" and "lung infection" was performed in PubMed ® and any additional terms were added to the search strategy. It is difficult to develop a search strategy that is robust enough to represent all nuances of the terms Indigenous, seasonal or meteorological parameters, and ARI, and thus, the use of multiple databases is intended to increase sensitivity of the search. This review will search the following databases: PubMed ® (via OvidSP ® ), CAB Abstracts/CAB Direct © , and Science Citation Index ® (via Web of Knowledge™). The search string will be appropriately adapted for each of the selected databases (Tables 2,  3 , and 4). A university librarian was consulted in preparation of the search strategy for PubMed ® . The search will not be limited by language, date, or study design. Search terms will be in English, although the names of Indigenous groups are commonly stated in their own languages (i.e., non-English names in the roman alphabet syntax will be used). An English search string should identify all English articles and any non-English articles with an English title and abstract. If a non-English citation is collected by the search, Google Translate © will be used to translate the title and abstract for initial screening [23] , and if maintained for full article screening, Google Translate © will be used for full text screening. This will allow calculation of the total number of eligible articles to generate appropriate denominators. If after full article screening a non-English article is eligible, the article will be formally translated by a paid service, if funding is available. If it is not possible to translate non-English articles, they will be excluded from data extraction and risk of bias (i.e., after full-text screening). To minimize the risk of exclusion of relevant citations, the citation list of each included study will be searched (i.e., a snowball search). Additionally, Google Scholar © will be used to complete a citation search on eligible studies, to identify studies that have referenced these studies. Studies identified by either the hand-searches or citation searches will be screened for relevance. Published and unpublished literature will be eligible. Published literature can be collected by all of the proposed databases. Unpublished literature can be collected by CAB Abstract/CAB Direct © and Science Citation Index ® . Unpublished primary research that exceeds 500 words in length will be eligible if it meets one of the three following criteria: (i) governmental report (i.e., produced by a regional or national government ministry); (ii) non-governmental report (i.e., produced by nongovernmental organizations); or (iii) graduate or honor undergraduate thesis or dissertation. Reports that are fewer than 500 words will be excluded. If the initial search identifies any relevant government or non-governmental reports, or theses, a search will be conducted in PubMed ® to identify any relevant journal publications by the first author of the citation. This PubMed ® search will include the first author's last name "acute chest syndrome" OR "acute respiratory distress syndrome" OR "ARDS" OR "bacterial pneumonia" OR "Black Lung Disease" OR bronchitis OR bronchiectasis OR bronchiolitis OR "bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia" OR "BOOP" OR "bronchopulmonary dysplasia" OR bronchopneumonia OR byssinosis OR "chest infection*" OR congest* OR coccidioidomycosis OR cocci OR cough* OR "cryptogenic organizing pneumonia" OR "flu" OR "Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome" OR histoplasmosis OR "Human Metapneumovirus" OR "Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis" OR Influenza* OR "lower respiratory tract infection" OR "LRTI" OR "LRTIs" OR "lung inflammation" OR "MERS" OR "Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome" OR "mycoplasma" OR "Non-tuberculosis Mycobacterium" OR pertussis OR pleuropneumonia OR pneumonconiosis OR pneumocystis OR and first initial, institutional affiliation, and one to three keywords from the abstract (i.e., author identified key words if available, or reviewer key words if not available). To keep the review current, if more than 12 months pass from the date the search was conducted to completion of data extraction and analysis, an update search will be conducted. If conducted, the second search will use the same search strategy as the first and will not be restricted by date. The search will be conducted in all of the original databases. Thus, a recall strategy is employed [24] , which should identify all of the initial studies and all studies published since the previous search. A hand-matching method will be used to identify whether all of the original citations are included.
