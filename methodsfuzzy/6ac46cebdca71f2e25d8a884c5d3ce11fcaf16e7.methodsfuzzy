The primary endpoint TSS 2-4 was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for continuous covariates 'TSS 0 ' and 'treatment'. Differences between I-C and placebo treatment groups were assessed based on the adjusted means and the corresponding two-sided 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). The secondary endpoints SSS 2-4 , LSS 2-4 , and AUC-TSS 1-10 (adjusted for TSS 0 and treatment) were analyzed similarly. The three exploratory endpoints TSS 2-4, ex 1pt , TSS 1-4 , and TSS 1-4, rel were analyzed in the same way as the primary endpoint, that is, by adjusting for 'TSS 0 ' and 'treatment'. For all the above endpoints, missing single symptom scores at baseline and at any post-baseline measurement time were replaced by zero, if at least one of the eight symptom scores was available. Thereafter, missing daily TSS, LSS and SSS data were replaced the last observation carried forward procedure. The duration of the cold was examined by recording the time to loss of cold, defined by the first "no" response to the question "Do you still have a cold?" in the patient's daily symptom diary. The log rank test stratifying for TSS 0 was used to compare treatment groups. The endpoint variable was censored at day 10 if a patient did not recover from his or her cold. To test whether patients' assessment of efficacy differed between the I-C group and the placebo group, an ordinal logistic regression model adjusting for TSS 0 was applied to the efficacy score (0-4) provided by patients. Missing entries were assigned the least favorable category. The analysis of the endpoint variable TSS at each study day (Days 1-10) used a restricted maximum likelihood-based repeated measures approach, using all longitudinal TSS data from Days 1-10. The statistical model included the fixed categorical effects of treatment, day and treatment-by-day interaction and the continuous covariate of TSS 0 . An unstructured covariance structure was used to model within-patient errors. Missing single symptom scores at baseline and at any postbaseline measurement time were replaced by 0, if at least one of the 8 symptom scores was available. If a patient had a missing TSS at a specific day and all subsequent days until Day 10 and the cold ended on that day (that is, the question "Do you still have a cold" was answered by "no" at that day at latest), the missing TSS values for that and the subsequent days until Day 10 were replaced by 0. For all other cases no imputation of missing TSS values was performed. The mean change in viral load from baseline was adjusted for the continuous covariates 'baseline viral load' and 'treatment' using an ANCOVA. Differences between I-C and placebo treatment were assessed based on the adjusted means and the corresponding 95 % CIs, which were calculated using a two-sided approach. For quantitative viral load analyses, missing values and values below the limit of quantification (LOQ) were replaced with the LOQ value.
