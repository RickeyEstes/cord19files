The trial was performed during 1999 and 2000 in 12 dairy herds using a randomised doubleblind, placebo-controlled study design. All of the herds were tested free from bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) in accordance with the Swedish voluntary control programme (Lindberg & Alenius 1999) , and no Salmonella spp. had been detected. In total, 48 calves that contracted neonatal diarrhoea spontaneously were included in the trial; however, 4 calves were excluded from the analyses (missing data n=1, concurrent therapy n=3). All calves were housed in single pens. The calves were given a homeopathic preparation or placebo. Antibiotic treatment was considered not relevant to include (Björkman et al. 2003) . The homeopathically prepared remedy Podophyllum (D30) and the placebo were obtained from DCG Farmaceutiska AB, Göteborg, Sweden. Each of the farms received packages with randomised dosages of Podophyllum and the placebo in coded bottles. Diarrhoeic calves were treated by the farmers, to whom the contents of the bottles were unknown. Treatment was initiated at the onset of diarrhoea and given orally for 3 consecutive days. During the course of the illness, calf health (i.e. general condition, body temperature, feed intake and faecal consistency) was monitored, rated on a 0-3 scale and recorded daily by the farmers. Score 0 referred to a clinically healthy calf, whereas score 3 signified severe depression, anorexia, a body temperature >40.5°C and/or watery faeces. For practical reasons, farmers were not able to monitor dehydration, acidosis and electrolyte imbalance in calves. On average calves in the Podophyllum group were 29.0 days old and in the placebo group, 26.3 days. Altogether 46% of the calves in the Podophyllum group and 45% in the placebo group were heifer calves, and the mean age of the dams was 2.5 and 2.4 lactations, respectively. The clinical signs on the first day of treatment were equivalent in the 2 groups (mean scores 2.8 and 3.2, respectively). Faecal samples from each calf were collected daily by the farmers, placed in plastic tubes and transported by mail to the National Veterinary Institute (NVI), Uppsala, Sweden. The samples were searched by ELISA for rotavirus (Svensson et al. 1983 , Svensson et al. 1986 ), Cryptosporidium parvum (Prospect Cryptosporidium microplate assay, Alexon-Trend, Ramsey, MN, USA) and coronavirus (in-house ELISA, NVI). Analyses were performed blind. Duration of diarrhoea was chosen as the primary variable in the analyses. The groups were compared using Poisson regression. The study design was approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments, Uppsala, Sweden (C133/98), and the Swedish Board of Agriculture, Jönköping, Sweden (35-4272/98).
