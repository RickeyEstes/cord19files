RNA recombination research concerns both virus evolution (where the most important subject is the detection of recombination imprints among natural viral RNA sequences) and the mechanism of recombination (by using the experimental systems of enhanced recombination frequency). As regards to the evolutionary studies, various computer programs are used for massive comparisons of viral sequences in order to reveal the recombination footprints. The examples of such software include, but are not limited to, Topali, RECCO, GARD, RDP, GENECONV, Chimaera, MaxChi, BOOTSCAN, SISCAN, PHYLPRO, DIPLOMO, SImPlot, Lard, and 3SEQ. These programs can identify the recombination sites among different viral strains, different viral species, and even between the virus and the host (Chare and Holmes, 2006) . With advent of next-generation massive sequencing, the genetic diversity of viral RNA genomes can be characterized through the mapping of polymorphisms and measurement of mutation frequencies as well as by detection of recombination events to a single-nucleotide resolution (Routh et al., 2012) . Such approach is very sensitive and unbiased, and it can identify hundreds of thousands of recombination events, allowing for a detailed description of RNA crossover profiles. The detection of recombination events in the laboratory is challenging because RNA-RNA crossovers apparently are rare events and thus the main effort is to elaborate on experimental systems of engineered RNA templates of increased recombination activity. The efficient recovery of recombinants in mixed infections could be achieved by using temperature sensitive mutants, a long-term method used for animal RNA viruses (Hirst, 1962; Pringle, 1970) . In whole plants, an important problem is that most recombinants are not competitive with the parental types and therefore disappear. One way to increase recombination rate is by using viral mutants bearing sequence modifications at their UTRs, which decreases the replication abilities of parental molecules, as was used to detect the BMV recombinants (Bujarski and Kaesberg, 1986) . Another approach utilizes viral RNAs bearing silent markers or via mixed infections with two low-competing viral strains (e.g., as the used by us mixed infection with both type and Fescue strains of BMV). Other plant virus recombination systems employ mixtures of two parental RNAs with one component carrying a deleterious mutation, e.g., satellite and genomic RNAs of TCV (Zhang et al., 1991) , or defective interfering and genomic RNAs of TBSV, Cucumber necrosis virus (CNV) (White and Morris, 1995) , and Potato virus X (PVX) (Draghici and Varrelmann, 2010) . All these types of recombination systems can be used in cell-free extracts (utilizing viral RdRp preparations), in single-cell (protoplast) hosts, in whole plant hosts, and even in yeast. Some of the systems make use of transient expression vectors by agro-infiltrating plant leaves (Kwon and Rao, 2012) . With these systems in hand, virologists can address such aspects of the RNA recombination process as the essential role of RNA sequence and structure, especially the role of RNA motifs, the function of viral replicase (RdRp) and other viraland/or host-encoded proteins, or the mutual host-virus effects in short-term virus evolution. The main analytical effort in the recombination experiments is to identify RNA recombination products and to map the location of cross sites. Usually, viral RNAs are extracted and amplified by RT-PCR and the resulting cDNA products are cloned followed by sequencing and/or restriction digestion of a large number of clones. This way the crossovers are detected and mapped within the sequence markers, providing information about both frequency and distribution of recombination events. Proper controls are required to guard against RT-PCR generated recombinants.
