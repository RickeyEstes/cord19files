Seventy-five patients with laboratory and clinical signs of cystic fibrosis (38 female, 37 male; mean age 15.6 f 5.6, range 428 years) were included in this study. The Shwachman scores' for these patients lay between 35 and 95. During the study period (from November 1984 until April 1987), 275 sera were collected-between one and 18 serum samples from each patient, with a median value of 2. Fifty-two per cent of the serum samples were taken as outpatients at the Dr. von Hauner'sches Kinderspital Miinchen, 22% on admission to hospital and 26% during the hospital stay. The majority of the CF-patients (62/75) had a chronic infection (>6 months) with Pseudomonas aeruginosu at the beginning of the study. Five patients harboured P. aeruginosa only intermittently in their airways, whilst six patients were free of the pathogen throughout the study. Two patients with cystic fibrosis developed infection due to P. aeruginosu at the start of the study. Antibodies against influenza A, influenza B, influenza C viruses, parainfluenzae viruses (types 1,2 and 3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, M. pneumoniue and C. burnetii were determined by complement fixations. According to Enders9, titers > 1:64 for adenovirus and mycoplasma, > 1:32 for RSV, influenza A and B viruses and C. burnetii, and > 1: 16 for influenza C and parainfluenza viruses, or at least four-fold rises in paired serum samples, are considered to indicate a recent infection. Microbiological analyses of sputum'O were performed at the same time as the serology. Sputum sIgA-antibodies against the different lipopolysaccharide antigens of P. aeruginosa were evaluated as described elsewhere". For statistical calculations the Wilcoxon-Mann-White test, the x2 test and Fisher's exact test were used.
