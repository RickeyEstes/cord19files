Animal, immunization, and serum collection. BALB/c mice at the age 6-8 week were obtained from the Laboratory of Animal Unit and brought up in Animal House of Zoology Department, the University of Hong Kong. At day 1, 22, and 43 the mice were anesthetized and injected with 150 lg per dose of plasmid in 100 ll phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) through tibialis anterior (TA) muscle on each leg [25] . In the case of co-administration of two kinds of plasmids in the same mouse, each construct was dissolved in 50 ll PBS and injected into TA muscle of each leg. Mouse blood was regularly collected by tail bleeding at day 0, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49 , and 56, and the sera were kept at )20°C until further use. At day 63 the seroconverted groups were terminally anesthetized and their sera were taken for the assays of virus specific neutralization, antibody isotypes, and geometric titer (GMT). Construction of recombinant plasmid. SARS-CoV cDNA was reverse-transcribed from viral RNA extract of SARS-CoV HK-39 as described previously [26] . DNA fragments covering different regions of the S gene were amplified from the viral cDNA with primers at the proper sites. Fig. 1 showed a schematic diagram indicating the sizes and the locations of these fragments on S gene. The recombinant S fragments (S R1 , S R2 , and S R3 ) were constructed by joining of short S fragments through overlapping extensions. The cloning sites, BamHI and EcoRI, start and stop codons were incorporated into PCR fragments by synthesizing on primers when necessary. A Kozak sequence was also added to S Na and S La ahead of their signal sequence. An expression vector, pCI-SP pGH , was reconstructed by adding 28 amino acid residues of pig growth hormone signal peptide sequence (SP pGH ) [27] at upstream of modified polyclone sites of pCI (Promega). All the PCR amplified fragments were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced as described [26] before they were cloned into pCI-SP pGH , except S Na and S La , which possessed the signal sequence of S gene and hence were inserted to pCI. The fragments S Nb , S Lb , S C , S F , S R1 , S R2 , and S R3 were also cloned into another expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) without signal sequence. Plasmid DNA Fig. 1 . Schematic diagram of full-length SARS-CoV S protein and its derived fragments used in the study. The full-length S gene is shown immediately under the hydrophobicity profile (upper). Signal sequence of S gene is marked as a solid black box and the putative highly hydrophobic regions of S1 are shown in solid box in light grey color. Heptad repeats (HR1 and HR1) and membrane spanning domain (MSD) are indicated as described elsewhere [16, 26] . All the fragments including the recombinant fragments were cloned into mammalian expression vector pCI-SP pGH , except for S La and S Na which were cloned in pCI. Fragments, S Nb , S Lb , S C , S F , S R1 , S R2 , and S R3 were inserted into pcDNA3.1 in addition. All the constructed plasmids were used for mice experiments. S R1-3 are different recombinants representing the putative hydrophilic regions. used to immunize animals was prepared by Plasmid giga kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Expression and Western blot of spike protein. To test the expression of S gene and its derived fragments in mammalian cells, all the DNA fragments, as shown in Fig. 1 , were cloned into pcDNA3.1-6ÂHis-IRES-GFP through BamHI and EcoRI sites. The vector was modified by adding the 6ÂHis and IRES-GFP up-and downstream of the multiple cloning sites of pcDNA3.1(+), respectively. IRES-GFP was PCR amplified from the plasmid pBMN-I-GFP, which was a kind gift from Dr. G.P. Nolan (Stanford University School of Medicine). The recombinant plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells cultured in 96well microtiter plate in triplicate with DOSPER liposomal transfection reagent (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) following manufacturer's instruction. The expression was examined by direct observation using fluorescence microscopy. The expression of several selected fragments was further confirmed by Western blot. The transfected COS-7 cells were harvested in 48-72 h post-transfection (p.t.). The expressed protein was purified with Ni 2þ -agarose (Amersham, UK) from clarified cell lysate and transferred onto PDVF membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) by electroblotting after SDS-PAGE. Monoclonal mouse anti-histag antibody (Invitrogen) was utilized to detect expressed protein in Western blot. ELISA tests of antibody titers. To detect SARS-CoV specific antibodies in mice immunized with the S gene DNA, human anti-SARS-CoV antibody (IgG) detecting ELISA kit (Beijing Huada GBI Biotechnology, Beijing, China) was used according to manufacturer's instructions, except that anti-human IgG was replaced with HRPconjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (H + L) antibody (Zymed, South San Francisco, CA) as the secondary antibody. According to the manufacturer, inactivated SARS-CoV viral particles were coated as antigen. Mice group and individual were defined as seroconverted if antibody titer was higher than 50 and 100, respectively. The GMT of the individual serum in the seroconverted groups was tested by end point dilution. SARS-CoV specific mouse IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes were detected with the same ELISA kit but either HRP-conjugated anti-IgG1 or IgG2a isotype monoclonal antibody (PharMingen) was used as the secondary antibody. Virus neutralization assay. Microtiter plate (96-well) containing confluent FRhK4 cells in 0.1 ml maintenance medium (1% FCS in MEM) was prepared. Each of 2-fold diluted mouse serum (0.05 ml) starting from 1 in 10 was premixed with 0.05 ml of 200 TCID 50 SARS-CoV (strain HK-39) and incubated at 37°C for 1.5 h. About 0.1 ml of the virus-serum mixture was then inoculated in wells seeded with FRhK4 cells in duplicate and further incubated at 37°C. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was examined at 72 and 96 h after. Neutralization titer was determined as the highest dilution of serum which gives 50% CPE of cells.
