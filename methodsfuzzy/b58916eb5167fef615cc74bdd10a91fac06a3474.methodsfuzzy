In order to calculate AR and CAR, we first obtained one-month stock price data after the beginning date of the forty event outbreaks. The 30-day period since the initial date of outbreaks was used for an event window. The market model (MM) was chosen to measure the expected returns (ERs) of firms' stocks. First, the firm's stock return was regressed against the return of market index derived from S&P 500 in order to control for the overall market effects (Eqs. (1) and (2)). R j,t , is the return of restaurant firm's stock j on day t; P j,t , is the closing price of stock j on day t; and R m,t , is the return of market on day t. The expected return (ER) was obtained by conducting ordinary least squares (OLSs) regression analysis (Eq. (3)). Finally, abnormal return (AR) was calculated by subtracting the expected return from the stock return (Eq. (4)). The value of AR indicates how the stock return has changed due to the firm-specific event separately from overall market movements. The ESM suggests that a post event period that is too long will not be accurate due to the possibility of external factors occurring t0, the day when event outbreaks and tn, nth day since the outbreak day (t0). * p < .05. ** p < .01. *** p < .001. in the same period. As such, this method allowed us to measure the impact of an event during a relatively short post event period. Accordingly, we examined stock prices within one month after the outbreak of an event. For the data analysis, we performed a series of t-tests using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). In order to examine the seriousness of food safety event impacts, we tested whether AR (or CAR) since the outbreak is significantly different from zero or not. To achieve the goal, the t-test was considered the most appropriate method to determine the significance of difference between AR (or CAR) and zero. Table 3 presents the results of event study analyses on daily abnormal returns of firms in response to food safety events. Abnormal returns (ARs) were calculated as the difference between expected stock returns and actual stock returns. Cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) were calculated as the sum of ARs. Negative AR or CAR indicates the negative impact of an event on firm value. A t-test was performed to investigate whether AR or CAR is significantly different from zero, since abnormal returns may not be zero if significantly influenced by any events.
