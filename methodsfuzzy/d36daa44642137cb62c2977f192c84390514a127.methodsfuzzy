Fifty-eight rabbits with an enteric clinical profile were obtained from several rabbit meat production from the southeastern part of the State of Mexico, Mexico. The animals exhibited an enteric clinical profile that included depression, anorexia, dehydration, abdominal distension, liquid-to-mucoid diarrhea and death within 24 h. Isolates were recovered from the intestinal contents through the necropsy service of the Amphitheater of Veterinary Medicine and Zootechnics of the Centro Universitario Amecameca (CU Amecameca), of the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México (UAEMex). This study was authorized by the Bioethics Committee of the CU Amecameca (CBE/06/2013). Eimeria spp. were identified by microscopy and the parasitological flotation technique 29 . DNA was extracted from the stool samples using the ZR Fecal DNA MiniPrep TM (ZYMO Research, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were assessed quantitatively and qualitatively by measurements of absorbance in a Nano Drop 2000c (Thermo Scientific, USA). A PCR was also performed, using primers for the amplification of the ribosomal cistron, ITS1 region (400---500 bp long) of Eimeria tenella, as reported by Oliveira et al. 19 (accession number AFO26388). The following reagents were added to 1 mg of DNA to make 25 l PCR solution: 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 1.5 U GoTaq Flexi DNA Polymerase (PROMEGA, USA), 5 l 5× Green GoTaq Flexi Buffer, and 0.8 mM of each primer. The amplification conditions included 35 cycles of denaturation at 96 • C for 45 s, annealing at 54 • C for 45 s and extension at 72 • C for 60 s. A sequenced sample was included as positive control and DNA obtained from rabbit blood was used as negative control. The bacteriological analyses involved primary isolation in blood agar; identification was performed by colonial morphology and Gram staining. Gram negative bacteria were cultured in the following selective media: MacConkey, Salmonella-Shigella and brilliant green agar at 37 • C incubation temperature and aerobiosis for 24---48 h 2 . To identify Salmonella, the samples were previously inoculated in peptone water and tetrathionate broth. A colony of each growth produced was selected as a representative isolate and subcultured for further biochemical identification. Biochemical tests of oxidase, catalase, triple sugar iron, ornithine decarboxylase, sulfide indol motility and urease were performed 5, 10, 14 . Gram positive bacteria were analyzed for evidence of catalase, coagulase, hemolysis, and cultured in mannitol salt agar 40 . To determine the E. coli pathotypes, we used a pathogenspecific multiplex PCR to detect enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and Shiga-toxin-producing or enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC o STEC o VTEC), using specific primers, by the amplification of 150---650 bp fragments for diverse virulence traits as reported by López-Saucedo et al. 15 Representative positive PCR products were purified and sequenced using an ABI PRISM 3500 genetic analyzer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Rotavirus detection was accomplished by the amplification of a 380 bp fragment of capsid protein VP6, employing primers as reported by Iturriza-Gomora et al. 12 RNA extraction was performed using GeneJET Viral DNA and the RNA Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA). The two-step RT-PCR technique was implemented; complementary DNA (cDNA) was obtained by means of the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (RT) (Thermo Scientific, USA). PCR conditions were as follows: Initial denaturation at 96 • C for 10 min, follow by 45 cycles of denaturation at 96 • C for 45 s, annealing at 61 • C for 45 s and an extension at 72 • C for 30 s, the final extension at 72 • C for 5 min. As a positive control, we used the Rota teq pentavalent vaccine (MSD SNC, Lyon, France). In order to test the association between the presence of the identified agents and the clinical profiles, we used the Fisher's exact test, with a significance threshold of (p < 0.05).
