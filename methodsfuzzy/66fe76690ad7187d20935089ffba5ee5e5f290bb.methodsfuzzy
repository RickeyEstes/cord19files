In the first experiment, three separate four ml aliquots of CCV-C54 ( 10 6.3 TCIDso/ml) (Tennant et al., 1991b) were mixed with 36 ml of either Wellcome growth media (Gibco ltd), virus transport medium (VTM) (Hanks balanced salt solution, Gibco ltd) or virus free 30% w/v canine faecal suspension in phosphate buffered saline. All solutions also contained 10% foetal calf serum, 0.067 mg/ml benzyl penicillin, 0.11 mg/ml streptomycin sulphate and 0.0022 mg/ml amphotericin B. One ml aliquots made from each of these samples were stored at either 20°C, 4°C, -20°C or -70°C, whilst one ml aliquots of CCV in growth media were also stored at 37°C, for variable periods of time. Three bijou containing virus in growth media were subject to one, three or six freeze thaw cycles (frozen at -70°C and thawed at 37°C). A second experiment was performed to investigate the effect of dilution of faecal samples on the survival of CCV. Thus, CCV-C54 was mixed with a faecal suspension as described above. Ten-fold dilutions, of the CCV-C54 infected faecal suspension, were made in Wellcome growth media. Duplicate dilutions were stored at either 4°C or 20°C for variable periods of time. The viral titres in all aliquots were then determined as previously described (Tennant et al., 1991b) .
