Viruses and cell culture. The DENV serotype 2 isolate Tonga/74 was generously provided by S. Whitehead (Laboratory of Infectious Diseases [LID], NIAID) and passaged in C6/36 cells. The titer of virus was determined on Vero cells as previously described (70, 71 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA) and passaged in Vero cells. Virus infections were performed at the indicated MOI, and virus was allowed to adsorb to the cells for 1 hour. Unbound virus was then removed, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by the addition of RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary human monocytes were obtained using the Gambro Elutra method from the NIH Clinical Research Center Department of Transfusion. Monocyte-derived macrophages were cultured as previously described (72) . were performed using the SensiFast Probe No-ROX One-Step kit (Bioline USA Inc., Taunton, MA), and reactions were run on a Stratagene Mx3005P real-time thermocycler (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Primers and probes were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA), and were  as follows: DENV-2 (forward, 5=-TGC CTA CAG TTC TAC GTC TCC-3=; reverse, 5=-TCG TTT CCT AAC AAT CCC  ACC-3=; probe, 5=-6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-CCT TCC AAT-ZEN-CTC TTT CCT GAA GCC TCT C-Iowa black  fluorescence quencher [IABkFQ]-3=), EMCV (forward, 5=-TTC AGC GTT TTC TAC TCC CTG-3=; reverse,  5=-TCA CTC CCC TCA CTT ACC C-3=; probe, 5=-FAM-AGA AAT CCT-ZEN-TCC CTG CGC TCA CC-IABkFQ-3=) For FP assays, the following FAM-labeled 30-mer RNA probes were used: 5=-rArGrU rUrGrU rUrArG rUrCrU rArCrG rUrGrG rArC/36-FAM-3=, with or without the reverse complement 5=-rGrUrC rCrArC rGrUrA rGrArC rUrArA rCrArA rCrU-3= (where "r" refers to ribose); or DNA probes 5=-AGT TGT TAG TCT ACG TGG AC-FAM-3=, with or without the reverse complement 5=-GTC CAC GTA GAC TAA CAA CT-3=. Oligomers were dissolved in binding buffer (100 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), heated to 85°C for 10 min, and allowed to cool slowly. The oligomers were then added to serial dilutions of protein solution in triplicate, and FP was measured on a Corning black 96-well, half-area assay plate (Corning, NY) using a Hidex Sense Microplate Reader (Turku, Finland). Confocal microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer by fluorescence lifetime imaging. A549 cells were plated on poly-D-lysine-coated 35-mm culture dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and either treated with IFN-␤ (10 ng/ml) for 16 h or infected with DENV-2 (MOI, 3) for 48 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% or 0.5% Triton X-100, followed by blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min. Primary antibodies were diluted in 10% normal goat serum and incubated at room temperature for 2 h, followed by three washes in PBS and staining with fluorescently labeled secondary antibody (1:500) and nuclear DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) stain (Life Technologies). Primary labeled antibodies were diluted in 10% normal goat serum and incubated at room temperature for 2 h, followed by three washes in PBS, and postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Images were collected on a Leica SP8 inverted confocal microscope with a 63ϫ oil immersion objective (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Colocalization analysis was performed using Imaris software (Bitplane Inc., South Windsor, CT). FRET-by-FLIM analysis was performed as previously described (73) . Gene ontology and statistical analyses. GO analysis was performed using proteins identified by MS with spectral counts above 50. Selected protein accessions were analyzed using the PANTHER classification system (http://pantherdb.org) (35) . All statistical analyses were performed on Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.), using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post hoc test and a P value of 0.05.
