The European wildcat (Fells silvestris) colony was housed in a single enclosure exhibit 15 m × 8m × 3 m, at a Scottish Zoological Garden, from 1978 to 1992. The two founder wildcats were purchased from the same source in 1976, placed in this enclosure and had their first litter in 1978. There were no further introductions. Their diet was fresh horse or chicken meat. The details of the size and dates of litter births, and dates of deaths in the colony are given in Fig. 1 . Between 1982 and 1992 necropsies were performed on 17 animals. The major clinical signs (if any) reported in the five wildcats subsequently diagnosed as having infectious peritonitis included nervous signs (three of five) and weight loss (three of five), respiratory signs (two of five) and abdominal distension (two of five). No cats with clinical FIP survived the disease. Selected tissues were fixed in buffered neutral formalin and were routinely processed to paraffin wax for histopathological examination. Sections were routinely stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). Immunocytochemical localization of FIPV antigen in paraffit>embedded tissues was demonstrated by an avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase method (Vectastain, Vector Lab, U.S.A.) alter pre-digestion of the de-waxed sections with 1 per cent trypsin solution ['or Anti-FIPV nucleocapsid goat serum was used as a primary antibody at a dilution of 1 in 50. In addition to this indirect antibody detection system, serum from a domestic cat, confirmed as suffering from infectious peritonitis at necropsy, was biotinylated and then used in a separate avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method. Tissues from three healthy cats and from cats suffering from parasitic pneumonia were used to provide sections containing uninfected macrophages. Normal goat serum was used as a serum control for the indirect staining techniques.
