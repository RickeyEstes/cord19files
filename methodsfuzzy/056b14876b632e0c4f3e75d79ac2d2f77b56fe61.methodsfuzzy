A stochastic outbreak was simulated over the course of five days. The outbreak was simulated within postgraduate students of five consecutive student cohorts (2012-2016 inclusive) of the MSc in Epidemiology at Imperial College London. The infectious agent was represented by a paper form (see Supplementary Material). Students acquired "dide-disease" (an imaginary infection) by receiving a form from a fellow student and transmitted infection by handing out new forms. The outbreak was seeded on day one by discretely handing an infection form to three students at random. These paper 'inocula' contained a list of instructions. Upon receiving the infection form each student sent an e-mail to the dataset curator to notify that they had been infected. The number of new infections to be transmitted was determined by a random draw from a Poisson distribution with a mean of 1.8, corresponding to the basic reproductive number for the outbreak. Students then printed out the required number of infection forms, located on a shared drive. Students were instructed to do all onward transmitting within 48 h. Whether or not symptoms occurred was determined by a random draw from a Binomial distribution with a mean of 0.8. Symptoms were also reported to the dataset curator via email. Each infected student listed on their infection form the names of those whom they had transmitted to and the time of transmission. Students recovered by placing their form in a 'recovery box' in their classroom. Students were instructed to place their form in the recovery box immediately after giving out all their infection forms. Infection was assumed to confer lifelong immunity. The data were collated in a spreadsheet software (MS Excel Â® , Microsoft Corporation), and analysed by the students in a practical session to analyse the outbreak. During the practical, students plot the time series of the outbreak, calculate the basic and reproductive numbers as well as other key epidemiological parameters such as latent, incubation and infectious periods. Calculating these and other properties such as the proportion of infections transmitted asymptomatically permits discussion regarding ease of control of "dide-disease". The infection form, practical handout and dataset templates are provided for others to adapt for their own use (see Supplementary Information) . When calculating the effective reproductive number (R t ), we use day of acquisition, regardless of date of onward transmission. Two different cumulative attack rates are calculated: an attack rate based on whether students were infected at all, and a clinical attack rate based only on whether students displayed symptoms. We exclude the seeds when calculating the cumulative attack rate, as the aim is to describe the process in the population of interest rather than the external process that triggered the outbreak via the seeds. Given that the time of acquisition, onset of symptoms (if any), onward transmission and recovery are documented, the latent, infectious and incubation periods can easily be calculated. When estimating the generation time, we use only successful transmissions, rather than all attempted transmissions, as this is the closest analogue to what is observed in real outbreaks. However, in real outbreaks it is the serial interval, rather than the generation time that is typically observed. For visualisation, analysis and simulation of the outbreak data, an R package and accompanying tutorial was developed and is freely available at https://github.com/mrc-ide/outbreakteachR. Visualisation of the temporal dynamics of the outbreak's transmission network were animated at discrete intervals. Where contact tracing data was missing, the most probable source of an infection was imputed. Data imputation in this way first identified potential source individuals who were infectious at the time of the individual's infection. The individuals most likely to have caused an additional infection were then extracted. This was based on how many onward infections they had already caused and the basic reproductive number for the outbreak given by a Poisson distribution with mean 1.8. From these individuals a random source individual was chosen. For comparison, several outbreaks with identical initial conditions were simulated. Each simulation was seeded with three infections, the population size was set equal to the students' class size and the outbreak was simulated for five days. In common with the paper-based outbreak, the number of secondary infections was drawn from a Poisson distribution with a mean of 1.8. The generation time and recovery period were sampled in two ways: (i) by sampling from a Poisson distribution with a mean equal to the observed mean generation time and recovery period respectively, (ii) by sampling from the observed distribution of generation times and recovery periods. For each of the five years, 2000 outbreaks were simulated using a discrete-time approach with hourly intervals in line with the students' timetable. The simulated time-series was then compared to the observed time-series.
