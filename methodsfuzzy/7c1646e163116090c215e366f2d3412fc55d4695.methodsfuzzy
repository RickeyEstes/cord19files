Viruses and cells. Viruses were propagated in DBT cells as described previously (Stohlman and Weiner, 1978) , except when MURINE CORONAVIRUS ANTIGENS 297 virus in serum-free media was desired for use in radioimmunoassay (RI A) . In this case, infected cells were first cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, N. Y at -70°. The derivation and characterization of the two plaque morphology variants of JHMV (MIIV-4), DL (large plaque) and DS (small plaque), have been described recently (Stohlman et at, 1982) . MHV-1, MHV-2, MHV-3, and MHV-S viruses were plaque-purified from virus stocks obtained from Dr . M. Collins, Microbiological Associates, Bethesda, Maryland and K . Fujiwara, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan . The MHV-K, MHV-D, and MHV-Nuu viruses were obtained as cloned stocks from Dr . K. Fujiwara . The MHV-M virus, an isolate from nude mice with wasting disease, was obtained from Dr . M. Collins . Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and herpes simplex virus, type I (HSV-1), were obtained from Dr . P . Brayton and Dr. D . Willey, respectively, both of the University of Southern California, School of Medicine . For the production of the monoclonal antibodies, M5 cells, a horse serum-adapted line of SP2/0-Ag .14, obtained from Dr . J . Davie, Washington University, St . Louis, Missouri, were grown in DMEM supplem e n t e d w i t h 1 0 % h o r s e s e r u m , 20 mM HEPES, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 pg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM MEM nonessential amino acids (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, N . Y.), and 5 X 10_ 6 M 2-mereaptoethanol . During selection, HAT was added to the medium (final concentrations : 1 X 10_ , Mhypoxanthine, 4X10-' M aminopterin, and 1 .6 x 10-5 M thymidine) (Littlefield, 1964) . Virus neutralization. The ability of the monoclonal antibodies to neutralize virus was assayed as previously described (Stohlman and Weiner, 1981) . Briefly, 25-µl serial dilutions of antibody (heat inactivated at 56° for 30 min) were added to wells of a 96-well microtiter plate ; subsequently, 25 µl of a virus suspension containing 10-TCID6" d o s e s ( 5 0 % t i s s u e c u l t u r e infective doses) was added to each well . The plates were incubated at 37° for 1 hr, and then 2 X 10°DBT cells were added to each well . The neutralizing titer was expressed as the highest dilution of antibody w h i c h p r e v e n t e d C P E i n 5 0 % o f t h e w e l l s . Antibody binding assay. The solid phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) for antiviral antibodies has been described previously (Fleming et al, 1983) . Viral antigens were used in excess; preliminary assays showed that each virus stock contained sufficient antigen to produce maximal binding with a hyperimmune anti-MHV standard serum. After cloning, 25 µl of supernatant from established hybridomas was assayed at 10 -1 dilution. Serial dilutions of antibody showed that this concentration fell within the linear region of the assay . In'eross reactive RIA, the binding of antibodies at 10-1 dilution was tested against homologous virus (JHMV-DL) and compared to the binding to heterologous viruses . Relative binding was expressed by a modification of the convention of Gerhard et at (1981) . The counts per minute (cpm) bound to homologous (JHMV-DL) antigen w e r e n o r m a l i z e d t o 1 0 0 % . Binding of g r e a t e r t h a n 5 0 % o f t h i s v a l u e w a s c o nsidered strongly positive; 2 5 -5 0 % , m o d e rately positive ; l e s s t h a n 2 5 % b u t m o r e t h a n twice background, weakly positive; and less than twice background, negative . Results shown in the block diagrams are the composite of at least three assays, each of which consisted of quadruplicate samples . Antisera. Hyperimmune antisera to JHMV-DL and A59 were made by serial immunizations of C57BL/6J (B6) mice obtained from Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine. Normal mouse serum free of anti-MHV antibody was obtained from B6 mice immediately after being received . Control antibodies used included monoclonal anti-mouse Ia (Harmon et al., 1982) , and rabbit anti-HSV-1, kindly supplied by Dr . D . Willey of the University of Southern California, School of Medicine. FLEMING ET AL. Preparation of monoclonal antibodies. The technique of Kohler and Milstein (1975) as modified by Harmon et at, (1982) , was followed. B6 mice, 6 weeks of age, were inoculated intraperitoneally with approximately 105 plaque-forming units of JHMV-DL grown in serum-free medium . Secondary immunization, usually 6 weeks later by the intravenous route, also consisted of 105 plaque-forming units of virus in serumfree medium . Suspensions of immune spleen cells were fused to M5 cells at a ratio of 2.5: 1 u s i n g 3 4 % p o l y e t h y l e n e g l y c o l MW 1500 (Aldrich Chemical Co ., Milwaukee, Wis.) at 37°. The suspension was then washed, resuspended in HAT medium, and cultured in 24-well plates at 1 X 106 cells per well, supplemented by 1 X 10 6 feeder spleen cells/well prepared from nonimmune B6 mice . Following incubation for 4 days at 37°, half of the medium was removed from each well and replaced with fresh HAT medium containing 1 X 106 feeder cells . On Day 8 this step was repeated with HT media (aminopterin-free) and feeder cells. On Day 11, wells were screened by RIA for antiviral antibody . Cells in positive wells were cloned by visual inspection and limiting dilution in 96-well plates. Clones were expanded, and supernatants were subsequently harvested and reassayed by RIA . Monoclonal antibodies were assayed for immunoglobin class and subclass by Ouchterlony immunodiffusion, using antiserum to murine immunoglobulin isotypes (Litton Bionetics, Kensington, Md .) . Radioirnmunopreeipitation . The specificity of the monoclonal antibodies for viral proteins was determined by radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) . DBT cells were inoculated with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1-5 for 1 hr at 37°. After removal of the inoculum, the cultures were incubated in the presence of serum-free DMEM containing 1 jig/ml actinomycin D . The medium was removed and replaced with prewarmed methionine-free DMEM (MFDMEM) for 15 min . The medium was again removed and replaced with prewarmed MFDMEM containing 20,uCi/ml°5 S-methionine (New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass.) . Following incubation for 30-45 min, the cultures were placed on crushed ice, washed 2 times with ice-cold PBS, and solubilized with a buffer composed of 10 mM Tris-HCL pH 7 .4, 150 mM NaCl, 0 . 5 % N P -4 0 , 1 m g / m l N -p -t o s y l -Llysine-chlormethyl ketone HCL (TLCK), 200µg/ml phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 500 u/ml aprotinin . The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min and stored at -70°. For immunoprecipitation, the lysates were adjusted to 0. 2 % s o d i u m d o d e c y l s u l f a t e ( S D S ) a n d i ncubated with an equal volume of polyvalent antiserum or monoclonal antibody as described by McMillan et al. (1981) . The immune complexes were adsorbed to a suspension of protein-A bearing Staphylococcus aureus as described by Kessler (1981) . The final pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 67 mMTris-HCL, pH 6 .8,2 . 6 6 % SDS, 5 . 0 % 2 -m e r c a p t o e t h a n o l , h e a t e d a t 56° for 2 min, and then centrifuged for 1 .5 min at 10,000 g. The supernatants were ana l y z e d b y e l e c t r o p h o r e s i s o n 6 -1 5 % d i scontinous slab polyacrylamide gels .
