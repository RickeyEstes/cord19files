Blood and sputum cultures were routinely performed for patients who were present at the emergency room or were admitted to the hospital due to suspected pneumonia. Simultaneously, patients who had preceding or concurrent flu-like or cold symptoms underwent nasopharyngeal swab sampling to isolate the respiratory viruses. Clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae were identified by conventional biochemical methods and the VITEK 2 GP card (bioM erieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using the VITEK 2 system according to the revised Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute's interpretive criteria for S. pneumoniae. 27 Nasopharyngeal swab samples were tested for 12 respiratory virus pathogens, including influenza virus type A and type B, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type A and type B, rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses (PIV; types 1, 2, and 3), coronaviruses OC43/229E and NL63, and adenovirus, by using the Seeplex RV assay (Seegene, Inc., Seoul, Korea) based on a multiplex RT-PCR method. Viral DNA and RNA were extracted from each respiratory specimen using the Gene-spin TM kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the nucleic acid amplification was conducted using the Seeplex RV master mix as described previously. 28
