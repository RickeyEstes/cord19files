Microarray design. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases for genome, gene, and nucleotide accessions were queried (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) for all taxonomy virus annotations and for accessions from prokaryotic and eukaryotic human pathogen lists compiled by literature searches and web resources (http:// www.niaid.nih.gov: Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases, Category A, B, and C Priority Pathogens). The resulting accessions were assembled into a nonredundant concatenation with 100-N nucleotide separators between accessions. This metagenome was divided into 58 "chromosomes" each around 5 to 10 million nucleotides (nt) in length and submitted to Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA) as a custom design project. Probe sequences, at a maximum of 60 nt with nonhybridizing spacers, were selected using the Agilent array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) design algorithms and then filtered for low likelihood of cross-hybridization to human genomic sequences. Independently, low-complexity regions in the metagenome were (36) . Criteria for unique regions were 250 to 300 bp and Ͻ50 contiguous bp with Ͼ70% identity to a sequence in any other metagenome accession. Conserved viral regions were similarly identified using criteria of 70 to 300 bp and Ͼ70% identity to at least one other virus but not to human sequences. Agilent-designed probes that mapped to unique or conserved regions of the pathogen genomes, or any prokaryotic or eukaryotic pathogen accession, were added to the microarray design by default if fewer than 10 probes were available for the source accession. Otherwise, the probes were filtered for minimum interprobe spacing of 100 bp and distribution that roughly covers the full length of each accession while limiting the number of probes to 10 to 20 per accession. The number of probes was not restricted for known oncogenic viral agents, creating a saturation tiling set covering these accessions. Entire genome sequences were covered to the extent possible with all available Agilent-designed probes. The microarray was supplemented with an additional number of predesigned aCGH probes for 660 genes and 602 intergenic regions from the human genome and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Probes and accession annotations are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ geo/). Sample preparation. Purified phiX174 virion DNA was purchased from New England Biolabs (N3023S; Ipswich, MA, USA), total DNA from human MRC-5 cells infected with cytomegalovirus (human herpesvirus 5 strain AD169) was ATCC VR-538D, total DNA from human A549 cells infected with adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5 strain Adenoid 75) was ATCC VR-5D, and total RNA from human HEp-2 cells infected with respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV strain Long) was ATCC VR-26D, all purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). Plasmid minipreps were prepared from pBR322 subclones carrying JC or BK polyomavirus genomes (J. C. Alwine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) and from pUC19 carrying the human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) genome (obtained from Peter Howley, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma tumor samples were obtained from the Abramson Cancer Center's Tumor Tissue and Biospecimen Bank (https://somapps.med.upenn.edu/pbr/portal/tumor/). All samples were reviewed by our resident pathologist for case history and confirmed for tumor type and demarcation of the cancer cells. If significant adjacent normal tissue was present, sections were mounted on noncharged glass slides for dissection of tumor tissue using a template slide with a hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E)-stained section with the cancer region clearly demarcated. Specimens containing mostly cancer cells were provided as paraffin rolls. The rolls or mounted sections (minimum of 5; 10 m each) from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors were used for sequential DNA and RNA extraction using the AllPrep DN A/RNA FFPE kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). Nucleic acid quality control assessments included A 260/280 ratios, yield, and size distribution by agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5ϫ Tris-borate EDTA buffering system. As expected, formalin-exposed RNA was partially degraded. However, recovery of most samples was relatively good, allowing for further processing. In most of the samples, the fragment sizes were acceptable and were moved ahead for cDNA conversion. Whole-genome amplifications (WGAs) of genomic DNA and/or cDNA from random-primed, reverse-transcribed total RNA were performed with the Illustra GenomiPhi v2 kit (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), the Ovation WGA system (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA, USA), and GenomePlex or TransPlex kits (WGA2 and WTA2; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) using manufacturer-recommended protocols and input amounts. Amplification products were purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and 2 g was used for Cy3 dye labeling by the SureTag labeling kit (Agilent). Cy5 dye labeling was performed on 2 g of human reference DNA from the Agilent SureTag kit, without prior WGA (experiment 1, Table 1 ) or after WGA (other experiments), as a control to report probe cross-hybridization to human DNA. Labeled DNA was purified with SureTag kit spin columns, and specific activities were calculated for use in hybridization reactions. Microarray production and processing. SurePrint glass slide microarrays (Agilent Technologies Inc.) were manufactured with 60-nt DNA oligomers synthesized in 60,000 features on eight replicate arrays per slide. PathoChip v2a and v2b contained 60,000 probes to unique target regions and conserved plus saturation target regions, respectively. PathoChip v3 contained 37,704 probes to unique targets and 23,627 probes to conserved targets or to saturate known oncogenic and pathogenic viral agents. Labeled samples were hybridized to microarrays as described in the Agilent Oligonucleotide Array-Based CGH for Genomic DNA Analysis protocol (version 7.2, G4410-90010). Master mixes containing aCGH blocking agent, HI-RPM hybridization buffer, and Cot-1 DNA (pilot assays only) were added to a mixture of the entire labeled test sample and the xhh DNA control sample, denatured, and hybridized to arrays under 8-chamber gasket slides at 65°C with 20-rpm rotation for 40 h in an Agilent hybridization oven. Arrays were processed using wash procedure A and scanned on an Agilent SureScan G4900DA microarray scanner. Microarray data analysis. Scanned microarray images were analyzed using Agilent Feature Extraction software to calculate average pixel intensity and subtract local background for each feature. Images were manually examined to note any arrays affected by high background, scratches, or other technical artifacts. The intensity distribution and channel balance were not used for quality control because they are expected to have little or no signal, except for the control human probes. Feature intensities for Cy3 and Cy5 channels were imported into the Partek Genomics Suite (Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA). The average intensity for human intergenic control probes was calculated for cohybridized test and xhh DNA samples, and a scale factor was determined which would make the Cy5 xhh DNA average equal to the Cy3 average. The Cy5 intensities for all PathoChip probes were then multiplied by the scale factor to normalize for differences in dye performance. Cy3/Cy5 ratios and Cy3-Cy5 subtractions were calculated for each probe to provide input for dual-channel or single-channel analysis pipelines, respectively. Accession average (AccAvg) was defined as the average Cy3 or Cy5 intensity across all probes for one accession, and accession signal (AccSig) was defined as AccAvg(Cy3) Ϫ AccAvg(Cy5). Model-based analysis of tiling arrays (MAT) (28) as implemented in Partek was used for sliding window analysis of probe signals (Cy3 minus Cy5) for each tumor sample. MAT parameters were P value cutoff of 0.99, window of 5,000 bp, minimum number of positive probes of 5, and dis-
