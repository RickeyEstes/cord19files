Chemicals. The ferrocene used for this study was obtained from Midwest Research Institute and was >99% pure, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We studied the potential for ferrocene degradation that might be caused by the generation of exposure atmospheres. HPLC analyses and graphite furnace atomic absorption of the exposure atmosphere showed that ferrocene was degraded by less than 1%. 59Fe-labeled ferrocene was prepared by treating a mixture of anhydrous ferrous chloride and 59Fe-labeled ferric chloride with sodium cyclopentadienide. The labeled ferrocene was purified by sublimation and then was dissolved in ether. The concentration of ferrocene in the ethereal solution was determined by measuring the visible absorbance at 440 nm and calculating the concentration, using the molar absorptivity (0.95 m-km-'). The 59Fe activity was determined by scintillation counting. From the concentration and activity of the S9Fe, we were able to determine the specific activity of the synthesized material, which was then corrected for loss of activity due to radiodecay; the half-life of 59Fe is 45 days. Exposure atmosphere generation and exposure system. Wright dust feeders (WDF) (BGI. Inc., Waltham, MA) were used to generate the ferrocene aerosols. The aerosol generated by each WDF was heated to 200Â°C to vaporize the ferrocene particles. A separate WDF generator/vapor system was used for each of the five exposure chambers. Six Hazleton H-2000 whole-body exposure chambers were used to house animals being exposed to each of the five levels of ferrocene (2.5, 5.0. 10, 20, and 40 mg ferrocene vapor/m3) or to filtered air (control). The highest ferrocene exposure level represented the highest concentration of ferrocene vapor that could be generated without producing condensation aerosols of the vapor in the chamber. The method used to determine aerosol concentrations in the chambers was a bubbler sampling train. The hexane solution from each bubbler system was analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard Model HP5890A gas chromatograph to determine the chamber vapor concentration. A real-time aerosol monitor (RAM-S; GCA Corp., Bedford, MA) was used to determine whether significant levels of particles were present in the chambers during exposures. During the exposures, we measured the homogeneity of the ferrocene vapor within each exposure chamber by injecting heated line samples directly into the gas chromatograph. Animals. Thirty male and 30 female F344/N rats and 30 male and 30 female B6C3F, mice (4 weeks old) were received from the Simonsen Laboratories, Inc. (Gilroy, CA). The animals were quarantined in cage units within a Hazleton H-2000 chamber prior to exposure, 2 per cage, for the first 4 days and then 1 per cage for 11 (rats) or I2 (mice) days. Animals were exposed for 5 days/week, starting on a Monday, for 2 weeks, with 2 or 3 additional exposure days before terminal euthanization, for a total of 12 or 13 exposure days for both rats and mice. This exposure schedule was necessitated to accomplish day-before-euthanization exposure and to facilitate timely necropsy of euthanized animals. Most animals (67%) were exposed for 12 days. Prior to the start of exposures, we used a computerbased randomization system (Path/Tax, Xybion Corp.) to randomly assign the rats and mice. Individual animals assigned to the study were identified by tail tatoos for rats and tail tatoos and ear tags for mice. Serum was obtained from two males and two females of each rodent species prior to the first day of exposure and was analyzed for antibody titers to specific rat viruses (Kilham rat virus, Toolan H-l virus, pneumonia virus of mice, Sendai virus, rat coronavirus/sialodacryoadenitis virus) and mouse viruses (K. virus, polyoma virus, mouse hepatitis virus. ectromelia, mouse encephalomyelitis (Theiler's GD VII), mouse adenovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Minute virus of mice, Sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice, Epizootic diarrhea of infant mice, and Reovirus 3). Titers were negative for all of these agents. The animals were fed Zeigler NIH-07 Open Formula Rat or Mouse Ration (Zeigler Brothers, Inc., Gardners, PA). Food was withheld during the 6-hr-exposure period. Water was available at all times, provided by an automatic watering system. Temperature and relative humidity in the inhalation chambers were monitored once every 5 min and averaged 22.8 f I. 1 "C and 55 f 6% (mean + SD), respectively. The light cycle was automatically controlled to provide I2 hr of fluorescent light and 12 hr of darkness each 24 hr (on at 6 AM and off at 6 PM). Experimental design. Rats and mice were weighed prior to starting the study, after 1 week of exposure, and at terminal euthanization. Detailed clinical examinations were also made at these times. Morbidity/mortality checks were made twice daily on all animals. Rats and mice were killed at terminal euthanization by cardiac puncture exsanguination while under halothane anesthesia, and each animal was given a complete gross necropsy examination. The liver, thymus, right kidney, right testicle, brain, heart, and lungs were weighed and then fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. Tissues for microscopic examination (nasal turbinates, lungs. liver, and spleen) were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 pm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. In vitro metabolism offerrocene. Microsomes for in vitro studies of ferrocene metabolism were obtained from the cells of 14-20 week old unexposed male F344/N rats. The rats were killed by CO* asphyxiation. Nasal ethmo-and maxilloturbinates and the liver were removed and homogenized. Microsomes were separated and stored as described previously (Hadley and Dahl. 1982) . Suspensions of microsomeq appropriate cofactors (Hadley and Dahl. 1982) . and the radiolabeled ferrocene were incubated for 20 min at 37'C. Metabolism was stopped by adding 1 M KOH to raise the pH to -I 1; adding the KOH not only stopped the reaction, but also ionized phenolic metabolites to keep this species water soluble. After exhaustive hexane extractions of unmetabolized ferrocene, the aqueous portion of the reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness to remove, by sublimation, any small amounts of ferrocene that had not been extracted into the hexane. The residue was analyzed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation spectroscopy, and the protein content was determined with Lowry protein assay (Lowry et a/., 195 1). Statistics. The data from male and female animals were analyzed separately, using Bartlett's test for data homogeneity and Dunnett's test for the equality of mean values. The criterion for significance was set at p -C 0.05.
