In a previous study, the occurrence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) among grazing dromedaries from Kenya was investigated [20] . Fecal samples had been collected between during January and February 2017 from camels located in a ranch in the northern Laikipia county in Kenya. Fecal matter was collected by rectal palpation using one glove per animal. Although effort s were made to select both genders of camels in the herd, a truly random sampling was not possible due to logistical constraints, for example compliance of the animals. Samples were placed in sterile containers, cooled for transport and stored at −80 °C until analyses. For this study, 162 samples (from 116 females, 45 males and one of unknown gender) were analyzed. Each fecal sample was enriched at a 1:10 ratio in Enterobacteriaceae enrichment (EE) broth (Becton, Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) for 24 h at 37 °C. For nonselective isolation of E. coli , the enrichment was spread on RAPID' E. coli agar (Biorad, Munich, Germany). One E. coli colony randomly selected from each agar plate was collected for further analysis. For selective isolation of ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae , one loopful of each of the enrichment cultures was streaked onto Brilliance ESBL agar plates (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK). Plates were incubated under aerobic conditions for 24 h at 37 °C.
