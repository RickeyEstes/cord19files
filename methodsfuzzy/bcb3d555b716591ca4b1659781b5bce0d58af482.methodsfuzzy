Based upon a review of enrichment methods presented in Table 1 , five combinations of three simple methods of enrichment were selected and performed on 1 mL aliquots of the artificial sample as follows; low-speed centrifugation in a microfuge at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 • C, sterile syringe filtration at 0.45 m, nuclease treatment using 0.1 U L −1 Turbo DNAse (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 0.1 U L −1 RNAse One (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA) and 1X DNAse buffer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and incubation at 37 • C for 90 min, or combinations of these being a 2-step method (centrifugation followed by filtration), or 3-step (centrifugation, filtration then nuclease-treatment). Independent duplicates for each treatment were performed and used in all subsequent experiments.
