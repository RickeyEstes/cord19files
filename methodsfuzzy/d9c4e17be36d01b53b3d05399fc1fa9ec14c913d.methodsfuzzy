Between July 1995 and March 2004, surgical lung biopsy was performed for diagnostic purpose in 269 patients with interstitial lung diseases or unexplained bilateral lung infiltrates at Samsung Medical Center. Among them, 42 patients were found to have a pathologic diagnosis of DAD. Internal review board approval for chart review was obtained, and informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. Medical records and pathologic findings for these 42 patients were reviewed to diagnose AIP. Our diagnostic criteria for AIP were as follows: (1) acute respiratory failure developing within 2 months; (2) the presence of DAD on surgical lung biopsy specimens; (3) the absence of underlying chronic pulmonary disease or previously abnormal chest radiograph findings; (4) the absence of any known inciting event or predisposing condition for ARDS such as respiratory infection, collagen vascular disease, exposure to environmental or occupational toxic agents, drugs, or radiation, and prior interstitial lung disease; and (5) no recent history of shock or use of vasopressors prior to hospital admission. 1, 3, 7, 8 Following a review of the medical records for each case, 29 patients were excluded from the study because they had known causes of DAD. Their etiologies for DAD were infections (n ϭ 13), drugs (n ϭ 7), collagen vascular diseases (n ϭ 4), acute exacerbation of usual interstitial pneumonia (n ϭ 2), and others (n ϭ 3). Then, pathology slides for the remaining 13 patients with DAD were further reviewed by two experienced lung pathologists (J.H. and M.K.). When the lung pathologists did not concur on the diagnosis, the case was excluded from the analysis. An alternative histopathologic diagnosis was suggested by one of the pathologist in three cases (bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia in two patients and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia in one patient). Thus, of the initial 42 patients who showed the presence of DAD on surgical lung biopsy specimens, 10 patients were determined to be definitive AIP cases and were included in the final analysis. Clinical and laboratory parameters such as age, sex, duration of symptoms, respiration rate, body temperature, acute physiologic and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score, 14 arterial blood gas analysis, and the presence of other organ failure 15 were retrospectively obtained. An expert chest radiologist analyzed high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans of the chest for the extent of ground-glass opacity, consolidation, reticulation, and nodules. The distribution of these conditions was classified into a diffuse pattern or a patchy pattern. The extent of each pattern of parenchymal abnormalities was estimated to the nearest 10% of lung volume. Then the differences between the pattern and distribution of abnormalities between survivors and nonsurvivors were compared. Lung specimens were classified as exudative, proliferative, or mixed exudative and proliferative phases of DAD. 16 The presence of marked architectural distortion was also evaluated. The data are shown as the median value (range), unless otherwise indicated. The difference in clinical parameters between survivors and nonsurvivors was compared by the Fisher exact test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test, as appropriate.
