Epidemiology is the study of health-related events in defined human or animal populations. These events include specific diseases and conditions as well as the exposures and host factors that contribute to their occurrence. The science of epidemiology was originally derived from the study of epidemics and has now been broadened to encompass all phenomena related to health in populations. 1 Simply stated, epidemiology involves the careful description of events within populations and the comparison of rates at which these events occur between groups within those populations. Similar concepts and methods of epidemiology apply to both infectious and noninfectious diseases. 2 The strength and adaptability of epidemiologic methods come from their underlying simplicity. For example, John Snow's application of epidemiologic study methods led to the classic intervention of pulling the handle from the Broad Street pump during an outbreak of cholera in London in 1851. His work was based on a careful description of his observations and on a quantitative approach in analyzing the occurrence of cholera among the citizens of London. The influence of his work led to legislation mandating that all water companies in London filter their water. Of note, it was not until 1883 that Robert Koch discovered Vibrio cholerae. 3  The clinical trial is cited as the gold standard of epidemiologic research. However, many epidemiologic studies cannot take place under such rigorously controlled conditions. Taking advantage of opportunities to study diseases in clinical and community settings is one of the strengths of epidemiology. In the setting of a clinical practice, epidemiology may involve studying a series of patients, participating in multicenter trials, or being a reporting source for cases of disease to public health officials. This last aspect of epidemiologic study may be a legal obligation, but it should also be viewed as an opportunity for all practicing clinicians to participate in the practice of community-based epidemiology. Academic-based research centers are often settings for clinical trials, studies requiring newly developed laboratory methods, or studies derived from referrals to clinical specialty groups. Public health departments typically do not have direct access to or contact with patients for clinical trials, but they are responsible for surveillance of reportable diseases and the investigation of outbreaks. There has been a debate about how to distinguish public health surveillance from research and the ethical considerations of that distinction. 36 Each of the described settings provides opportunities for epidemiologic studies that can make major contributions to the understanding, prevention, and control of infectious diseases. Several major constraints are confronted in the design of epidemiologic studies of infectious diseases. Time is frequently a problem in the investigation of outbreaks. The need to quickly design and conduct outbreak investigations has increased with the frequency of widespread foodborne outbreaks and concerns over the potential for intentional contamination of the food supply. This necessarily limits the investigator's ability to fully explore the outbreak setting and can result in the loss of information. In any study involving the retrospective collection of data, information may be lost because of difficulty in recalling exposure or in verifying information about the exposure. For many infectious diseases, it may be difficult to identify sufficient numbers of cases in clinical settings to conduct meaningful epidemiologic studies. In such situations, multisite collaborative projects are often needed. For example, a CDC working group on prevention of invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) disease among household contacts concluded in 1995 that the data available from a single study conducted in Ontario, Canada, were inadequate to recommend chemoprophylaxis to household contacts. 37, 38 Although the Canadian study suggested an increased risk of invasive disease among household contacts, this assessment was based on only four subsequent cases in households. Based on the recommendations of the work group, a multisite study coordinated by the CDC was initiated in multiple states or areas with active surveillance of invasive GAS disease. Additional surveillance studies supported the conclusion that outbreaks of invasive disease among household contacts are rare, so that recommendations for chemoprophylaxis need to be made on an individual basis. 39, 40
