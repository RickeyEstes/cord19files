Of the total 537 probable SARS case-patients, 469 had been tested for the antibody response to SARS-CoV by neutralization test, ELISA, and IFA in parallel, but only 244 patients were tested by ICT. With neutralization tests as a reference method, the overall characteristics of the evaluated methods, including ELISA, IFA, and ICT, are given in Table 2 . For ELISA, the sensitivity was measured at 98.2%. Of the 224 serum specimens, which tested positive with neutralization test, 4 gave negative responses with ELISA. The specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 98.7%, 98.7%, and 98.4%, respectively. For IFA, the sensitivity was evaluated at 99.1%. Two serum samples, which had been positive in neutralization test, were negative with IFA. The specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were of 87.8%, 88.1%, and 99.1%, respectively. The specificity of the ICT was calculated to be 98.2%; however, its sensitivity (33.6%) was low, leading to a negative predictive value of 56.1%. In the total of 245 negative neutralization tests, 3 positive results were detected with ELISA, 30 positive with IFA, and 2 positive with ICT tests. These 35 specimens were taken from 31 patients, in which two positive PCR results were found.
