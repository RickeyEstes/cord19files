Animals, bacterial strains, and growth conditions. The mice used in this study were purchased from Vital River, Beijing, China. All experimental work involving animals was performed according to the guidelines recommended by the animal welfare and ethics of the Heilongjiang Animal Ethics Committee at the Heilongjiang science and technology government agency (Harbin, People's Republic of China) and was approved and supervised by the commissioner for animal welfare at the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute (HVRI) representing the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All the experiments were designed to minimize the numbers of animals used and every effort was made to minimize both pain and distress to the animals. M. smegmatis cultures were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (BD Biosciences) and supplemented with 10% oleic acid/albumin/catalase enrichment (10% OADC, BD Biosciences), 0.05% Tween 80 (Amresco), and 0.2% glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich). E. coli DH5α strain (Novagen) was used for plasmid preparations, and E. coli Rosetta 2 strain (Novagen) was used for protein expression. All E. coli strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. Cloning and expression. The amino acid sequence of Rv0888 was checked for potential signal sequences using the SignalP 4.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). Primers (Supplementary Table S1 ) were designed to amplify the rv0888, rv0888NS, and rv0888S genes from genome of M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv. PrimeSTAR Max DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Bio) was used for PCR amplification. The rv0888 amplicon was cloned into a pET22b vector (Novagen) with a 6 × His-tag at the C-terminal and the recombinant plasmid (pET-22b-Rv0888) was transformed into Rosetta 2 (DE3) E. coli. The Rv0888 protein was expressed as the inclusion-body form. The recombinant Rosetta 2 (DE3) E. coli was grown in LB medium (200 μ g/mL ampicillin and 34 μ g/mL chloromycetin) at 37 °C until OD600 = 0.6-1.0, and were then induced with 1 mM IPTG at 37 °C for 4 hours. The rv0888NS and rv0888S amplicons were cloned into a pMV262 vector (assembled in our laboratory, the corresponding sequence is shown in the supplementary data) and the recombinant plasmids (pMV262-Rv0888NS and pMV262-Rv0888S, respectively) were transformed into M. smegmatis mc 2 155 cells. The rMS was grown in 7H9 medium (containing 0.05% Tween-80, 0.2% Glycerol, 10% OADC, 50 μ g/mL kanamycin) at 37 °C until OD600 = 0.8-1.0. Protein expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Table S2 ) to introduce N131A, E267A, G303A, H353A, D387A, N389A, D438A, D472A, H473A, D472A-H473A substitutions into the nucleotide sequence; PCR amplification was performed using the PrimeSTAR Max DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa Bio). The PCR products were digested with DpnI to damage the methylated parental template DNA and, the mutated plasmids were transformed into DH5α E. coli. All of the substitutions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The protein purified from affinity chromatography was centrifuged in a 30 kDa Centricon concentrator (Millipore) and concentrated to ~2 mL. The concentrated protein was loaded onto a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare) in buffer J (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and all peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The verified protein was concentrated again and loaded onto a Resource S 5 mL column (GE Healthcare), which was pre-equilibrated with buffer J. The target protein was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of NaCl concentration from 0 M to 2 M. Fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
