In this study, we have focused on performance evaluation of IRTs. Specifically, we have studied the recommended test methods for key characteristics: stability and drift, uniformity of the workable target plane, minimum resolvable temperature difference (MRTD), and radiometric temperature laboratory accuracy. [30] Furthermore, we have implemented optimized test methods to compare two commercial IRTs. It is our intent that accomplishing these goals will facilitate development of IRTs capable of effective fever screening. While we are also conducting an extensive human study on fever screening, such work is beyond the scope of this paper. We used two commercial uncooled microbolometer IRTs sensitive to the LWIR band: IRT-1 (A325sc, FLIR Systems Inc., Nashua, NH) and IRT-2 (8640 P-series, Infrared Cameras Inc., Beaumont, TX). Nominal IRT specifications are listed in Table 1 . The IRTs were attached to a stable platform and images were acquired with manufacturer-provided software. A hand-held weather meter, WM (Kestrel 4500NV, Weather Republic LLC, Downingtown, PA) was used to measure the ambient temperature and relative humidity, which are input parameters for the IRTs. The IRTs were stabilized for 15 minutes prior to each test (clause 201.101.8). A separate experiment was performed on each IRT to make sure that 15 minutes was long enough for stabilization. Measurement instability was considerably small during the normal operational condition (after the stabilization period), especially when used together with an ETRS (data are not shown here). Two extended area blackbodies with high temperature accuracy, stability, uniformity and emissivity, and low drift were used for IRT performance testing: BB-1 (SR-33N-4, CI Systems Inc., Simi Valley, CA) and BB-2 (SR-800R-4D, CI Systems Inc.). The blackbodies had the same emitter size of 4×4 inch 2 . BB-1 was used as an ETRS and BB-2 as a CS. Technical specifications of the blackbodies are listed in Table 2 . All data in Table 2 were claimed by the manufacturer without independent calibration except for the total system uncertainty values that were calculated based on the claimed data. Each blackbody can be set to a target temperature within its operating range. BB-1 has an embedded controller and works in absolute mode. It is claimed to be highly accurate, with total system uncertainty of u BB1 = ±0.04˚C or expanded uncertainty of U BB1 = k Á u BB1 = ±0.08˚C (k = 2 is the coverage factor for a confidence interval of approximately 95% [44] ) and combined stability and drift of ±0.02˚C, which satisfies the standard requirements (maximum expanded uncertainty of ±0.3˚C, maximum combined stability and drift of ±0.1˚C, clause 201.101.3.1). BB-2 was claimed to have superior accuracy and stability compared to BB-1. BB-2 was used as a CS for characterizing the STs and can be operated in absolute or differential modes. The expanded uncertainty (U BB2 = ±0.08˚C) and combined stability and drift (±0.02˚C) of BB-2 were the same as those of BB-1, which meets the standard requirement (maximum expanded uncertainty of ±0.2˚C, maximum combined stability and drift of ±0.05˚C, Annex BB in [30] ). Both blackbodies were claimed to be traceable to the NIST ITS-90 thermocouples database. The standard [30] recommends use of a CS with emissivity ! 0.998 (Annex BB). The nominal emissivity of BB-1 and BB-2 was 0.98±0.01. We are not aware of any available commercial blackbody that meets the standard's requirements in the intended minimum temperature imaging range of 30˚C to 40˚C (clause 201.101.2.1). We did not find the justification for the specified emissivity in the standard. The references in the standard do not mention the emissivity of 0.998. While some cavity blackbodies have emissivity around 0.99, they usually operate at temperature higher than 50˚C. Consequently, to ensure an accurate temperature estimate, recorded thermograms were compensated for non-ideal blackbody emissivity, ε g , (e.g., non-zero reflectivity) per the Stefan-Boltzmann formula for a graybody. Thus, IR emission of an object can be expressed as [40] : where E total [WÁm -2 ] is the total radiosity received by the camera, ε g is considered as 0.98 for our blackbodies, (1 − ε g ) denotes the object's reflectivity, and T refl [K] represents the reflected temperature. The reflected temperature could be measured based on the "reflector" method specified in a standard [45] . A thermographic inspection of the laboratory (e.g., walls, air vents, and devices) was conducted using a hand-held IRT (FLIR ONE, FLIR Systems Inc., Nashua, NH). Since no external source of IR radiation was found, the reflected temperature was assumed to be the same as the ambient temperature. The difference between the temperatures calculated based on measured T refl and assumed T refl over the range from 30˚C to 40˚C is less than 0.08%, confirming that the assumption is reasonable. Approximating T refl with the ambient temperature is for ease of testing. However, this approximation should be verified for a given system under a given environment. In case of the presence of an excessive surrounding IR radiation, reflected temperature should be measured per ASTM recommendations [45] . Ambient IR transmissivity could be less than unity in long distance imaging and high relative humidity conditions. But given the current testing at 0.8 m, an assumption of τ atm = 1.0 was implemented. The measuring distance, relative humidity and ambient temperature can affect τ atm and such assumption should be verified for a different system under a different environment. A block diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Fig 1. The blackbodies were positioned in front of the IRTs, 1.5 m above the floor, in an in-focus plane (exception: BB-2 was out of focus during the uniformity tests at short working distance), and perpendicular to the line of sight of the imagers (clauses 201.3.213 and 201.101.7). The working distance between the blackbodies and the IRTs was d = 0.8 m (exception: working distance was set to 0.15 m for IRT-1 and 0.05 m for IRT-2 for short distance uniformity test and 0.35 m for MRTD evaluation inside a temperature chamber, respectively). For normal fever screening, the working distance should ensure thermograms with minimum dimensions of 240×180 pixels for the subject's face (clause 201.12.2.103) and 20×20 pixels for the ETRS (clause 201.101.3.2). Given the sensor dimensions and field of view (FOV) of IRT-1 and IRT-2, as listed in Table 1 , a distance of 0.8 m is needed to achieve a 240×180 pixels thermogram of the face with a spatial resolution (clause 201.101.9) of~1 mm /pixel (i.e., one pixel can image an area of 1×1mm 2 on the face). The working distances for IRTs with different sensor pixel numbers and camera FOV might be different. The size of ETRS active area is recommended to be less than 10% of the face during fever screening (Annex AA); however, we have shown that a larger size (15-20%) is also acceptable if it can be experimentally proven that the ETRS doesn't adversely affect the measurement. A cloth backdrop with low reflectivity was used to minimize reflected IR radiation from the surroundings (clause 201.7.9.3.9). The emissivity of the cloth was measured based on the "noncontact thermometer" method [46]: ε g = 0.91±0.02 (experimental details not provided here).  As shown in Fig 1, the main devices used in this study include IRT-1, IRT-2, BB-1, BB-2, and WM. A computer with controlling software is considered part of an IRT. A screening thermograph (ST) usually includes an IRT and a blackbody as an ETRS (BB-1 in this case) for temperature offset compensation to ensure precise operation between calibrations (clause 201.3.209). If the IRT alone satisfies the standard level of performance (stability and drift, and laboratory accuracy), the ETRS could be avoided. In this study, we checked the performance of two STs: ST-1 that includes IRT-1 and BB-1, and ST-2 that includes IRT-2 and BB-1. The effect of the ETRS on the results was also investigated. 2.3.1. Stability and drift. To estimate the system stability, the test procedure described in clause 201.101.4 was followed. The CS (BB-2 set at 37˚C) was placed in the WTP of the ST-1 (and ST-2) and totally 1,920 consecutive frames were captured for 8 hours with time steps of 15 seconds (any time steps between 5-15 seconds is acceptable according to the standard). For evaluation of ST-1 and ST-2, captured BB-2 frames were corrected for temperature offset error using the ETRS (BB-1). A region of each frame within the BB-2 aperture-in this case a 60×60 pixels square excluding BB-2's four edges to avoid data inaccuracy-was extracted for calculations. Then the mean temperature value within the extracted region, M frame , was calculated for each frame. Afterwards, the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the 1,920 M frame values for 8 hours of measurement (M 8h and SD 8h ) were calculated. The standard requires that three times SD 8h -the confidence interval of the observations that is greater than 99% [44] -should be less than 0.1˚C. However, the standard doesn't define the standard uncertainty and expanded uncertainty of stability (u S and U S , where u means standard uncertainty, U means expanded uncertainty, and the subscript s means stability). We recommend u S be defined as SD 8h . Then 3ÁSD 8h is expanded uncertainty (U S ) with coverage factor k = 3 and confidence level >99%. The value of u S is used to calculate the standard uncertainty of the ST (Eq 8) and should be less than 0.03˚C (0.1/k = 0.03). For drift analysis, the stability evaluation procedures should be repeated every day for the device's calibration interval or two weeks, whichever is longer. The requirement for drift is that the maximum difference between M 8h values (M 8h,max -M 8h,min ) should be less than 0.1˚C. The standard doesn't explain how to translate the results into standard uncertainty of drift (u d ). Unlike the random property of stability, drift data can change monotonically with time, i.e., measured temperature keeps drifting away from the true values. Therefore, we define u d as (M 8h,max -M 8h,min ) based on the worst-case scenario. Since all the IRTs and blackbodies in this study have a one-year manufacturer-recommended calibration interval, the calibration interval for ST-1 and ST-2 can also be considered as one year, assuming the data from the manufacturers are reliable. According to the standard, a one-year measurement should be performed to accomplish a thorough drift analysis for the systems. Since the ETRS has high stability, small drift, and high spatial uniformity (Table 2 ) and the goal of this paper is to optimize test methods instead of evaluating devices, we only evaluated drift over a two-week period to demonstrate the evaluation process. Furthermore, stability and drift values of IRT-1 and IRT-2 (i.e., no offset compensation by the ETRS) were also measured and results were compared to the values of ST-1 and ST-2. Per the standard, both stability (3ÁSD 8h ) and drift (M 8h,max -M 8h,min ) values should be less than 0.1˚C, and the combined stability and drift less than 0.2˚C (clause 201.101.4). The requirements are not clear from the statistics point of view. They had better be based on standard uncertainty, combined standard uncertainty, or expanded uncertainty due to stability and drift. [47] A better expression of the requirements for stability and drift is that u S should be less than 0.03˚C and u d should be less than 0.1˚C. The criterion for combined stability and drift is redundant and can be removed.
