Since the discovery of AECA, several studies have focused on their role as diagnostic tools for diseases characterized by an inflammation of blood vessels. Despite the growing interest in this field, AECA immunoassays still show a high-interlaboratory variability, most probably due to the lack of international standardization. Many methods have been developed to detect AECA, including immunofluorescence, immunoassays (ELISA and RIA) using fixed cells, Western blot (WB), and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (FACS). Nevertheless, only a small number of comparative studies have been done and data concerning sensitivity and specificity of methods to detect AECA are frequently variable and inconclusive (reviewed in Ref. [5] ). The major part of our knowledge on AECA reactivity comes from in vitro experiments with human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs). Nevertheless, the isolation of primary HUVECs is laborious and the AECA reactivity obtained with diVerent donors cannot easily be compared to each other because of their diVerent origin. Moreover, HUVECs present a short life span and can be kept in culture only for short periods. Another point of debate is the fixation procedure of HUVECs, which may influence the AECA reactivity against intracytoplasmic or membrane antigens. Interference from heterophilic antibodies, which recognize fetal calf serum (FCS) proteins, may be avoided by adding FCS to the dilution buVer [6] . Finally, diVerent ECs from macro-and microvasculature have been used for AECA detection with diVerent results. ECs from diverse tissues are also heterogeneous not only in respect to small vs large vessels but also in respect to their surface phenotype and protein expression. For instance, Renaudineau et al. [7] showed the highest prevalence of AECA reactivity in a large series of patients with SSc using microvascular bone marrow ECs in comparison to HUVECs. The need for reproducible results has increased the demand for immortalized EC lines, such as EA.hy926, generated by fusion of HUVECs with the human lung carcinoma cell line A549 [8] , or the immortalized human microvascular EC line (HMEC-1) [9] . ECs derived from human umbilical and iliac veins and arteries transfected with a plasmid containing the Simian Virus 40 large T-antigen, may also be useful for the detection of AECA [10] . Immortalized human glomerular endothelial cell (HGEC) lines were also generated [11] . These cell lines maintain the morphologic and functional characteristics of HGECs even after several weeks in culture, thus providing a standardized substrate for AECA detection. Nevertheless, AECA detection on immortalized ECs may be subject to great variability and scientists interested in autoimmunity against ECs would prefer primary EC lines as substrate because these cells probably present more primary endothelial traits. Although the original cyto-ELISA remains the most widely used method for the detection of AECA, it is advisable to confirm a positive result using other methods, such as flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, or WB, which appear to be diYcult to use on a routine basis [12] . It is important to point out that heating sera should be avoided because this treatment increases AECA binding by a nonspecific mechanism in sera from both patients and healthy individuals [13] . ANA or RF in serum samples have been shown not to interfere with AECA detection by ELISA with nucleus-depleted lysates prepared from EA.hy926 [14] . Finally, because it has been reported that diVerent AECA isotypes may be prevalent in diVerent autoimmune disorders, as discussed elsewhere in this chapter, it should be pointed out that the AECA test should include determination of both IgG and IgM in most disorders with the addition of IgA in patients with Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). In fact, while IgG AECA are predominant in most autoimmune conditions, IgM AECA have been shown to be particularly increased in Kawasaki disease (KD) probably reflecting the acute nature of this disorder. In addition, IgG and IgM AECA may exert diverse pathogenic role due to their diVerential ability to fix and activate the complement cascade as well as to induce ECs damage via antibody-dependent cytotoxicity.
