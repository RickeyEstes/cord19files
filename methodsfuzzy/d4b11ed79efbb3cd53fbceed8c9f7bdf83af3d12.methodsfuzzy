The reliability of CFD methodologies was first verified by the experimental data. measured by Yin et al. [19] within an inpatient ward (see Fig. 3 ) containing a bed, a TV set, a piece of medical equipment, a visitor, and a patient. Ventilation rate of 4 ACH (114 CFM) was obtained by air supplied from the diffuser located near the floor. Air was exhausted from the ward by the main exhaust and bathroom exhaust with the ventilation rate of 36 CFM and 78 CFM respectively. Fig. 3b shows locations of 8 poles where vertical profiles of velocity magnitude and static temperature were measured at the height of 0.12 me2.6 m from the floor. The heat released from patient, caretaker, equipment and TV was 106 Watt, 110 Watt, 36 Watt, 24 Watt. More detailed information on experimental setups can be found in Yin et al. [19] . The medium and fine grid arrangements were utilized. For the former, about 0.38 million tetrahedral cells was used with the maximum grid size of 10 cm near wall surfaces and finer grid near heating surfaces. For the latter, about 1.8 million tetrahedral cells was produced with the maximum grid size of 5 cm near wall surfaces and finer grids near heating surfaces. The thermo-fluid boundary conditions in CFD simulations are shown in Table 3 , which matched the experiment. The other CFD arrangements are the same with those introduced in Section 2. Fig. 4 shows vertical profiles of velocity and temperature at three example points of Pole 2, Pole 4 and Pole 5. The height, velocity, and temperature (q ¼ (T À T s )/(T e À T s )) were normalized with respect to the height of the inpatient ward (H ¼ 2.7 m), supply air velocity (u s ¼ 0.14 m/s), temperature at inlet (T s ) and main exhaust (T e ). The temperature stratification is clearly found in CFD simulations. CFD results were in good agreement with the measured data. The medium grid does similarly good in CFD prediction as the find grid does. It depicts that present CFD arrangements using RNG ke 3 model can predict indoor airflow generally well. Though this paper does not carry out CFD validation for transient CFD simulations with moving objects because high-quality experimental data are rare [23e27]. Lee [43] verified that RNG ke [28] . Thus the steady-state validation case in this inpatient ward could be used for test cases with HCW walking.
