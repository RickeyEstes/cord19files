Experimental design. The experiments were designed to investigate the effects of chloroquine administration on rat hepatic I/R injury. Rats were treated with chloroquine (60 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h before warm ischemia, and they were continuously subjected to a daily chloroquine injection for up to 2 days. Rats were killed 0.5, 6, 24 and 48 h after reperfusion. Liver injury, inflammatory cytokines, hepatic HMGB1 expression and release, MAP kinase activation, autophagy and apoptosis were analyzed. Animals. Male inbred Lewis rats, purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany), weighing within 250-320 g, were used in this study. All animals were housed under standard animal care conditions and had free access to water and rat chow ad libitum. All procedures were carried out according to the German Animal Welfare Legislation. Partial hepatic warm I/R. Partial hepatic warm I/R model was performed as described previously. 8 In brief, after opening the abdomen with a transversal incision, interlobular ligaments were dissected. A micro vascular clamp was used to interrupt the arterial and portal venous blood supply to the left lateral and median liver lobes for 60 or 90 min. Hepatocellular damage assay. To assess liver damage, serum AST and ALT were measured using an Automated Chemical Analyzer (Bayer Advia #1650; Leverkusen, Germany). Histopathology. Liver tissue was fixed in 4.5% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections (4 mm) were cut and stained with hematoxylineosin. Histological evaluation was performed using a semiquantitative scoring system. 47 HMGB1 immunohistochemistry. HMGB1 immunohistochemical analysis was performed as described previously. 29 Briefly, after deparaffinization, rehydration, antigen retrieval and blocking, sections were then incubated with HMGB1 antibody (1 : 500; Abcam, #ab18256, Cambridge, UK) for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was performed by using PowerVision goat-anti-Rabbit-AP (ImmunoLogic, DPVR-110AP, Duiven, the Netherlands) and using Fast-red (Abcam, #ab64254) as substrate. Gel electrophoresis and western blotting. Twenty micrograms total protein were separated on 12% gels by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinyldifluoride membranes (GE Healthcare, #28906837, Buckinghamshire, UK). Antibodies against phosphorylated or total ERK ( Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum HMGB1 was determined with a commercial ELISA assay (Shino-Test, ST51011, Kanagawa, Japan). All procedures were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Total RNA was extracted from liver tissue using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, #74106, Hilden, Germany) and was reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using the First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, #18080051, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Primers and probes ( Statistical analysis. Data were expressed as meansÂ±S.D. Differences between groups were evaluated for significance by one-way ANOVA analysis. All tests were performed using SigmaStat v3.5 (Systat-Software, Erkrath, Germany). A P-value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
