Microarray Design and Fabrication. Throughout this manuscript, "probes" are used to mean oligonucleotides immobilized on the solid support, and "targets" are labeled cDNA sequences of the sample virus. Table 1 lists the selected enteric viruses and the number of probes for each strain of virus that were synthesized directly on the FDA_EVIR microarray by photolithography, whereby the total number of probes on the array is 91542. Selected regions of several enteric viral genomes were tiled at two nucleotide spacing, which means each succeeding oligo probe starts from the third nucleotide of the preceding oligo probe. Thus the approximately 91,000 probes can interrogate a total of more than 180,000 nucleotides. Since most enteric viruses have rather small genomes (approx. 7400 nucleotides), we were able to scan the genomes of a number of viruses. We also laid on the array a number of partial sequences in the database, particularly for norovirus. Each probe is 25 nucleotides long and there is a 23 base-pair overlap between consecutive probes for the same virus genotype; therefore, the complete array covers 183,084 nucleotides of viral genomic sequence. The number of probes for each group of virus range from 1113 for rotavirus (RV) group C segment IV to 18736 for norovirus (NV) genogroup II. The large range is due to the number and extent of independent genome sequences available for NV from GenBank. Norovirus genogroup II is represented by the largest number of probes due to a preponderance of partial sequences for these strains in GenBank. Generally, the short size of oligonucleotide probes on the array ensures that their binding to target sequences are sensitively affected by single base mismatches within a test genome that could be detected by a decrease in hybridization signal. Therefore, the tiling array design would allow detection of nucleotide changes by interrogating multiple neighboring probes. All microarrays used in this study were customer ordered to be fabricated by Affymetrix Inc. (Santa Clara, CA) using a photolithographic array synthesis technology [19] . The tiling microarray was designed to detect common food-borne and fecally transmitted viruses including hepatitis A virus, norovirus, sapovirus, coxsackievirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, as well as hepatitis E virus. All viral genetic sequence data were obtained from the GenBank database of viral genomes. The tiling microarray chips were composed of overlapping 25mer oligonucleotides with a 2-nucleotide spacing whose sequences were derived from the 5' end viral genomes (3,700 nucleotides) of each virus except rotavirus. Sequence representation for this virus was derived from individual genome segments and ranged from approximately 2,300 to 3,300 nucleotides. Multiple sequences of partial genomes were also used as in the case, for example, of the HAV VP1-P2A junction. The genogroup (or genotype, serotype, group or partial genome) identification and the number of oligomer probes representing that particular group of genomes on the array is given in Table 1 . Microarray Hybridization, Scanning, and Data Analysis. Microarray hybridization was performed using the Affymetrix protocol. Briefly, biotinylated cDNA in the presence of Affymetrix hybridization buffer was hybridized to the microarray chip in a total volume of 120 l. Before application to the array, the samples were heated to 98 °C for 1 min, cooled at 45 °C for another 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 5 min. The microarray chip was then incubated at 45 °C for 16 hrs in a hybridization oven. Following hybridization, the wash and stain procedures were carried out by the Fluidics station (Affymetrix, CA). All arrays were imaged by using Affymetrix microarray scanner at a resolution of 10 m per pixel. Signal intensity of the hybridization was extracted by using Affymetrix power tools, and the subsequent data analysis was performed using MS Excel. For each viral genome represented on the array, the average signal intensity for all the probes within that genome was determined. The average intensity is first determined as described by Jackson et al. [20] , and Ayodeji et al. [15] . Each average genome intensity was then normalized by the average intensity of all the probes represented on the array. To minimize effects of nonspecific hybridization, an empirical cutoff value of 3.0 was considered as a threshold value for a positive signal. Microarray hybridization data were then converted to color visualization schemes in which hybridization signal intensity is reflected by the color scale of vertical strips. Validation of Norovirus Microarray Genotyping. To confirm the microarray genotyping result of the norovirus sample #186 (NoV#186), we performed a specific PCR with a published primer set G1SKF (5'-CTGCCCGAATTYGTA AATGA-3') and G1SKR (5'-CCAACCCARCCATTRTAC A-3'); G2SKF (5'-CNTGGGAGGGCGATCGCAA-3') and G2SKR (5'-CCRCCNGCATRHCCRTTRTACAT-3'; Y=C/T; N=A/T/G/C; R=A/G; H=A/T/C). These primer pairs were used for the amplification of genogroup I and group II norovirus. The PCR was carried out as described previously [21] . The amplicon was sequenced and its relationship to known NoV strains was determined by phylogenetics analysis program ClustalX as described by Thompson et al. [22] . A phylogenetic tree from boot-strap analysis was generated by Neighbor-Joining method. Other norovirus samples were genotyped by Dr. William Burkhardt (FDA, Dauphin Island, AL) and by Dr. Jan Vinje (CDC, Atlanta, GA) via RT-PCR. Fig. (1) shows the results of hybridization of the array probes to samples of coxsackievirus, hepatitis A virus, and norovirus samples. Coxsackievirus samples CXKV B2, B3, B4 and A2 demonstrated clear-cut hybridization patterns. In CXKV A5, a minimal degree of cross-hybridization to A16, B3, B5 and A7 as well as B1 were also detected. The reason is the considerable localized sequence identity between different CXKV strains. However, their signal intensities were much lower than that of the probes from the same strain to targets derived from A5 itself (58.2-fold). For HAV, strong hybridization signals are only observed in HAVderived oligoprobes and genotypic-specific probes generate high intensity signals although cross-hybridization among strains is also observed, which reflects the sequence conservation within the HAV genus.
