A total of 529 kidney samples were collected from captured E. helvum that were roosting in trees (Muleya et al., 2014; Ogawa et al., 2015) in Kasanka National Park in Central Province and in Ndola in Copperbelt Province of Zambia (Table 1 ). This research was performed under the research project ''Molecular epidemiology of bacterial zoonoses in Zambia'' approved by the Zambia Wildlife Authority, in the Republic of Zambia. The kidney samples collected from E. helvum were placed directly in Korthof or Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) media (World Health Organization, 2003) and homogenized for DNA extraction and Leptospira isolation by crushing with beads. DNA was extracted from 10% (w/v) kidney homogenates using a DNA Isolation Kit for Mammalian Blood (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. A nested PCR based on the flagellin B gene (flaB) sequence was used to amplify the extracted DNA samples (n = 529) to detect the flaB gene of pathogenic Leptospira spp. (Koizumi et al., 2008) . Some of the flaB-nested PCR-positive samples (n = 27) were examined further. To identify Leptospira species, we also performed a nested PCR based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rrs) and the preprotein translocase gene (secY) using the primer sets shown in Supplementary Tables  1 and 2. The PCR products from the flaB-nested PCR (732 bp including the 41 bp primer sequence), the rrs-nested PCR (642 bp including the 48 bp primer sequence) and the secY-nested PCR (329 bp including the primer sequence) were purified and subjected to direct sequencing using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing a Kit (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies). The sequence data were aligned using the Clustal W software, and a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated with 1,000 bootstrap replications using MEGA 5.2.2 software (Tamura et al., 2011) . The DDBJ accession numbers for the flaB and rrs sequences from the uncultured Leptospira spp. detected in E. helvum comprised LC005103 to LC005172 and LC005173 to LC005199, respectively (Supplementary Table 3 ).
