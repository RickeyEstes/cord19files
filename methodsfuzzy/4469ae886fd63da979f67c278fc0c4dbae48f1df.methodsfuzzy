To select a desirable action, the FTA-based method proposed in this paper is used and the procedure is summarized as follows. The above deductive procedure are repeated until the root causes of scenario S 4 are analyzed clearly. Thereby, the FT for H1N1 infectious disease in University B is constructed, which is shown in Fig. 3 . The meanings of the symbols in Fig. 3 are given in Table 2 .
