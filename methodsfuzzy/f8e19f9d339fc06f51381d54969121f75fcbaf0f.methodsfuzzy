Samples were tested by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays following standard protocols at the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Infl uenza in Melbourne, Australia (16) . Serum samples were pretreated with receptor-destroying enzyme II (Deka Seiken Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), 1:4 (vol/ vol), at 37°C for 16 h before enzyme inactivation by the addition of an equal volume of 1.6% trisodium citrate (Ajax Chemicals, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) and incubation at 56°C for 30 min. A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1) pandemic virus was purifi ed on a sucrose gradient, concentrated, and inactivated with β-propiolactone, to create an infl uenza zonal pool preparation. Twenty-fi ve microliters (4 hemagglutination units) of infl uenza zonal pool A/ California/7/2009 virus were incubated at room temperature with an equal volume of receptor-destroying enzyme II-treated serum samples, with different wells for serum titrated in 2-fold dilutions from 1:10 to 1:1,280 in phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation of serum for 1 h, 25 μL of 1% (vol/vol) turkey erythrocytes was added to each well. HI was read after 30 min, with titers expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum in which hemagglutination was prevented. For computing geometric mean titers (GMTs), we assigned titers <10 a value of 5, and titers ≥1,280 a value of 1,280. These values were then log transformed before we computed means and associated 95% confi dence intervals (CIs). GMTs were then obtained by back transformation (17) . The HI assay was assessed on paired serum samples from 56 case-patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 confi rmed by reverse transcription-PCR. The assay had a sensitivity of 80% when seroconversion was defi ned as a ≥4-fold increase in antibody titers between the fi rst and second blood specimens (15) .
