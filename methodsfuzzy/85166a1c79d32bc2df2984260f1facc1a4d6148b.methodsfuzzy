Sampling. Tracheal tissue samples were collected from 46 IB suspected broiler farms, located in Basra, Thi-Qar and Muthana governorates. All chicks were 20-35 day-old and vaccinated with H120 and 4/91. Five tracheal tissue samples per flock were selected for RNA extraction. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Total RNA was extracted from the tracheas using CinnaPure RNA (Sinaclon Co., Tehran, Iran) based on the kit instructions. The extracted RNA was used in reverse transcription (RT) reaction to generate cDNA through cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo scientific, Waltham, USA). The cDNA was stored at -20 ˚C until use. Real-time PCR for IBV detection. Real-time PCR was carried out to detect IBV. TaqMan ® probe and primers (Bioneer Corporation, Daejeon, Korea) were used in this study according to Callison et al. method. 11 Forward primer 5' GCTTTTGAGCCTAGCGTT3', reverse primer 5' GCCATGTTGTCACTGTCTATTG 3', and TaqMan ® duallabeled probe FAM-CACCACCAGAACCTGTCACCTC-BHQ1, were used to amplify and detect a 143-bp fragment of the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR). The mixture for each tube was consisted of 13 μL TaqMan Master Mix, 0.2 μL of 2 pM IBV probe, 1 μL of 10 pM forward primer, 1 μL of 10 pM reverse primer, 2.8 μL distilled water, to reach a total volume of 18 μL. Then, 2 μL cDNA was added. A negative control containing nuclease-free water instead of cDNA were included in each run. The thermal profile for the PCR was 95 ˚C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 ˚C for 15 sec, 50 ˚C for 30 sec and 72 ˚C for 30 sec. PCR amplification was performed using Rotor Q (Qiagen Co., Hilden, Germany) system. Nested PCR for IBV genotyping. For determination of genotypes, a type specific nested PCR was conducted. 12 Oligonucleotide primers included MCE1+, DCE1+, and BCE1+ which specifically amplified a hyper-variable region of the S1 gene of Mass, D274 and 793/B serotypes, respectively. XCE3-primer was a common primer for all IBV genotypes detection. Primer sequences and their expected band size are shown in Table 1 . The first round amplification was performed in a final volume of 20 µL (2 μL distilled water, 13 μL 2X PCR master mix (Sinaclon Co.), 1 μL forward primer (XCE2+) primers, 1 μL reverse primer (XCE2-) and 3 μL cDNA. Amplification was performed with a thermal profile of (94 ˚C for 5 min, 94 ˚C for 45 sec, 58 ˚C for 45 sec, 72 ˚C for 90 sec, and 72 ˚C for 5 min) for 40 cycles. Two microliter of the first round PCR product was diluted with 198 μL of distilled water, whereas in the second round nested PCR we used (2 μL distilled water, 13 μL 2X PCR master mix (Sinaclon Co.), 1 μL forward Primer (XCE3-), 1 μL reverse primer (DCE1+) and or MCE1+, BCE1 + and 3 μL RT-PCR Product) amplification was 94 ˚C for 2 min, 94 ˚C for 15 sec, 48 ˚C for 30 sec, 68 ˚C for 30 sec, and 68 ˚C for 10 min) for 40 cycles. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel.
