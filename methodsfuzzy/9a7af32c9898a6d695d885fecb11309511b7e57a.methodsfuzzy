Virus and E1 protein. RV strains M33, RA27/3, and HPV77 were grown in Vero cells and isolated from culture supernatants. Virus stocks were titrated by immunocytochemical focus assays as described previously [23] . Stock solutions containing 5 Ã— 107 focus-forming units (FFU)/ml were inactivated by UV light (254 nm, model UVG-54; UV Products, San Gabriel, CA, USA) at 5 cm for 10 minutes before use. Recombinant RV E 1 protein (rE 1BV), which was isolated from the culture supernatant of the insect cell line SF9 transformed by recombinant rubella E 1 baculovirus, was generously provided by Dr. Shirley Gillam (Department of Pathology, University of British Columbia). Peptide synthesis. Overlapping SPs (5-24 aa long) encompassing residues 268-291 of E1 protein of RV strain M33 [11] and substituted analogues within the E1 sequence 273-284 were synthesized in an automated peptide synthesizer using established solid-phase methods and purified to 95% homogeneity in reverse-phase highpressure liquid chromatography by BioChem Immunosystems (Laval, Quebec). Amino acid analyses were performed on each peptide and found to be in good agreement with the theoretical composition.
