Preparation of Euscaphis japonica methanolic extract powder E. japonica was purchased from a plant extract bank at the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology (KRIBB), dried at room temperature, and pulverized in a blender. Pulverized E. japonica was extracted with methanol (106,009; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and sonicated for 3 days. Sonication was performed for 15 min, 10 times per day. The extracts were passed through nonfluorescent cotton filters (0.45 μm pore size, 13 mm filter diameter; Smartpor GHP syringe filter, Woongki Science, Seoul, Republic of Korea) and concentrated in vacuo to yield the methanol extract. After concentration, the extract was lyophilized for 24 h and the resulting E. japonica extract powder was stored at 5°C.
