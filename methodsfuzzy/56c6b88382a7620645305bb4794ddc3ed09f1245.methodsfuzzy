To fulfill the study objectives, a cost-benefit analysis was conducted on both climate change induced sea level rise and zooanthroponosis, which was proxied in this study as the SARS case, with an expected impact of a 0.15% loss in GDP (Adams et al., 1995) . After the two cost-benefit analyses were conducted, this research performed a hypothetical cost-benefit analysis of establishing research institutions for both cases to show the impact of both sea level rise and the disease on GDP so that rational and cost-efficient measures can be taken to prepare for the risks.
