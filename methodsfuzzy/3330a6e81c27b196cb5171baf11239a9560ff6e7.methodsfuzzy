Nasal washes from each side of the nose were taken from consenting participants by trained medical staff, placed in viral transport media and refrigerated. The samples were transported to the laboratory on ice for etiological testing within 24 hours. Laboratory analysis was performed in an ISO15189accreditated laboratory for molecular diagnostics which regularly takes part in external proficiency programs such as QCMD EQA programs. Detailed laboratory methods were previously described [14] . We used the multiplex PCR strategy based on the Resplex assays described below, and performed additional singleplex PCR assays to determine the influenza subtype. Total nucleic acids were extracted from each specimen using the DNA minikit (Qiagen, Inc, Valencia, CA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. A total of 20 μl of extract were tested with Resplex I and II (version 2.0, Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) [18] for respiratory micro-organisms on the LiquiChip 200 Workstation, according to manufacturer's instructions. The Resplex I and II (version 2.0) assays are multiplex PCR assays coupled with bead array detection technology and can simultaneously detect and subtype 18 different pathogens including influenza A (FLU-A) and influenza B (FLU-B). Specimens that were Resplex II positive for FLU-A were further subtyped with real-time PCR for H1 or H3 (Singapore Ministry of Health), or for FLU-A(H1N1)pdm09. Briefly, 5 μl of total genetic extracts were tested using an in-house developed assay based on the one-step SuperscriptIII/Platinum Taq kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions on the LightCycler machine from Roche or the Applied Biosystems real-time PCR machine (7500). The analysis was limited to viral mono-infections amongst cases to discern clinical presentations and symptom complexes associated with each pathogen. We excluded viruses with fewer than 20 cases (0.6% of the total), as the number was too small to have a reasonable sample sizethese were Coronavirus HKU1 (CoV-HKU1), Parainfluenza 1 (hPIV-1), hPIV-2, hPIV-4, Influenza A(H1N1) (the prepandemic strain), respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV A), RSV B, CoV and Bocavirus (BV). This left 14 viruses for the subsequent analyses. The main aim was to compare the differences in clinical expressions, including individual symptoms (or signs), pairs of symptoms, and overall symptom load between patients with different viral infections. We counted the clinical symptoms/signs and calculated the corresponding empirical proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the overall symptom load. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the differences in symptom expressions for each pair. Differences were identified at a significance level of 0.05. To assess the presence of paired symptoms/signs for all viruses, we conducted binomial tests to compare the joint proportions of symptom pairs occurring together to the expected proportions assuming independence of symptoms. The ratio of the observed proportion of symptom pairs relative to the product of the marginal proportion of each symptom is defined as the excess probability ratio which measures effect size. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to compare the risk of having an individual symptom/sign among viral mono-infections by assigning a categorical variable for all viruses as the primary predictor. Potential confounding was addressed by adjusting the model for age, smoking status, asthma and heart disease. Non-significant variables were dropped at a significance level of 0.05 to obtain the final model. Statistical analyses were performed using the R Statistical Software (version 3.0.0) [19] . Ethics approval was given by the Singapore military's Joint Medical Committee for Research, and the National University of Singapore's ethics review committee.
