A monoclonal antibody (clone 4B4) specific against EBOV subtype Zaire NP were developed by our lab previously. Polyclonal rabbit antisera against EBOV subtype Zaire NP and MERS Virus NP were kindly provided by Professor Zhengli Shi, from Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. 2.1. Determination of the antibody titer of monoclonal antibody and polyclonal rabbit antiserum against EBOV subtype Zaire NP by ELISA ELISAs were performed as described by Nakayama et al. using the recombinant NP antigens [9] . Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with a predetermined optimal quantity of recombinant EBOV subtype Zaire NP antigens (50 ng/well). Then purified monoclonal antibody (clone 4B4) and polyclonal rabbit antiserum diluted in series 2 fold from 1:10 to 1:81920 with PBS containing 1% BSA were added into the wells and incubated with the coated NP antigen for 30 min at 37 â€¢ C, respectively. After washing, the bound monoclonal antibody (clone 4B4) and the polyclonal rabbit antiserum were detected by using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:5000, respectively. Finally, the optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek, USA). Each dilution was tested in triplicates. Before the agglutination test for IgG antibodies of MERS NP, the S. aureus nanobioparticles were sensitized with the fusion protein MERS NP-CBD in a similar way as the preparation of EBOV NP sensitized S. aureus nanobioparticles. For the agglutination test, 30 L of MERS NP polyclonal rabbit antiserum was mixed with 10 uL of the nanobioprobes sensitized with the MERS NP-CBD on a microscope slide. The mixture was incubated at room temperature and mixed thoroughly every two minutes. The blank control and negative control were simultaneously made by mixing 30 L of PBS or negative rabbit serum, respectively, with 10 L of the nanobioprobe suspension.
