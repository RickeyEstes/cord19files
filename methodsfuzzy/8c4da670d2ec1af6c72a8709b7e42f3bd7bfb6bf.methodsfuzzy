Tracheal intubation of a Laerdal Airway Management Trainer (Laerdal Medical Corp., Oakleigh, Vic., Australia) was performed using the following methods. All the intubation times were analysed by repeated measures of analysis of variance (ANOVA). When the normality assumption on the residuals was violated, log transformation was applied to the intubation times before performing repeated measures ANOVA. Since this is a prospective observational study examining the impact of various types of PPE on tracheal intubation techniques, power calculations were based partly on previous work focussing on the impact of chemical protective equipment on tracheal intubation. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] However, patients with infectious respiratory illnesses requiring tracheal intubation will have significant degrees of respiratory failure and are often intolerant to prolonged intubation attempts. Based on a pilot study we aimed to detect not less than a 5 s difference between the times for direct laryngoscopy and intubation with an estimated standard deviation of 7 s. The required sample size was 17 participants with an 80% power of the test at the 0.05 level of significance.
