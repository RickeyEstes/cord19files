Cells. HEK293T (ATCC), HeLa (ATCC), and HeLa-mCEACAM (77, 78) cells were maintained in DMEMϪ10% FBS medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium [DMEM] containing 10 mM HEPES, 100 nM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 100 U/ml penicillin G, and 100 g/ml streptomycin, and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS] [Atlanta Biologicals]). BHK-21 cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEMϪ5% FBS medium. LET-1 cells (BEI Resources) (79) were maintained in DMEMϪ10% FBS medium lacking HEPES, sodium pyruvate and nonessential amino acids. Calu3 cells (ATCC) were maintained in MEMϪ20% FBS medium (minimum essential medium [MEM] supplemented with 20% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin G, and 100 g/ml streptomycin). DBT cells (80, 81) were maintained in MEMϪ5% FBS medium (MEM supplemented with 5% FBS, 10% tryptose-phosphate broth, 26.8 mM sodium bicarbonate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin G, and 100 g/ml streptomycin). All cell lines were cultured in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37°C. Viruses. Recombinant MHV strains JHM.SD (82) and A59 (83) , both containing a firefly luciferase (Fluc) reporter between the viral E (envelope) and M (matrix) genes, were grown in DBT cells. Media were collected at 24 to 48 h postinfection. JHM HEϪ arose during laboratory passaging of JHM.SD. Virus-like particles. CoV virus-like particles (VLPs) were constructed by cotransfection with equimolar amounts of plasmids encoding CoV S, E (envelope), M (matrix), and N (nucleocapsid). Coding sequences for A59-CoV S, E, M, and N genes are presented in GenBank accession no. AY910861.1; for JHM-CoV, GenBank accession no. AC_000192.1; and for MERS-CoV (EMC 2012 strain [84] , GenBank accession no. JX869059.2, where only the S gene is codon optimized [24] ). The A59/JHM-CoV and the MERS-CoV genes were inserted into pCAGGS and pcDNA3.1 expression vector plasmids, respectively. Recombinant pCAGGS-DSP 1-7 -N and pCAGGS-DSP [8] [9] [10] [11] -N were constructed by fusing the DSP 1-7 or DSP [8] [9] [10] [11] coding sequences (pDSP 1-7 and pDSP [8] [9] [10] [11] [85, 86] provided by Zene Matsuda [University of Tokyo]), followed by a 2ϫ SGGS linker, to the 5= ends of the coding sequences for the N genes. Expression plasmids (1 g) were complexed with polyethylenimine (PEI) (Polysciences) (6 g) in 0.2 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) for 15 min at room temperature and then added dropwise to 5 ϫ 10 5 HEK293T cells in 1 ml of DMEMϪ10% FBS. For spikeless VLPs, S expression plasmids were replaced with empty vector plasmid DNAs. Six hours later, the cells were replenished with fresh DMEMϪ10% FBS. Media were collected at 48 h posttransfection. Pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus particles (pps) were constructed from a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) platform as described in reference 87. Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with viral glycoprotein expression plasmids, including pHEF-VSV G-Indiana (BEI Resources), pcDNA3.1-HA5-QH, and pcDNA3.1-PR8 NA1 (obtained from Lijun Rong, University of Illinois-Chicago). Twenty-four hours later, the cells were inoculated for 2 h with VSVdeltaG/Junin GP-luciferase (87, 88) . The cells were rinsed twice with FBS-free DMEM medium and replenished with DMEMϪ10% FBS. Media were collected after a 48-h incubation period. Particle concentration. Media containing viruses, pseudovirus particles, and VLPs were clarified by differential centrifugation (300 ϫ g, 4°C, 10 min; 3,000 ϫ g, 4°C, 10 min). Particles were concentrated from clarified media by overnight centrifugation (SW28, 6500 rpm, 4°C, 18 h) through a cushion comprised of 20% (wt/wt) sucrose in FBS-free DMEM. The resulting pellets were resuspended in FBS-free DMEM, and the resulting 100ϫ concentrated particle stocks were stored at -80°C. Hemagglutination assay. Serial twofold dilutions of 100ϫ concentrated virus and pseudovirus particle stocks were prepared using FBS-free DMEM as diluent. Diluted samples were placed into V-bottom 96-well plates and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. Washed adult human erythrocytes (0.5%) (in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) were then added, and scoring was performed after 2-to 12-h incubation at 4°C. For live-cell assays, adherent, confluent cells in 24-or 96-well plates were pretreated with vehicle or neuraminidase (1 U/ml) (catalog no. N2876; Sigma) in FBS-free DMEM for 2 h at 37°C. The cells were rinsed three times with PBS and then used in virus transduction assays. VLP binding assay. VLPs used for binding assays were prepared by cotransfection with plasmids encoding CoV S, E (envelope), M (matrix), and DSP 1-7 -N ϩ DSP 8-11 -N. The resulting VLPs contained complemented DSP Rluc-positive interiors. To quantify VLP-associated Rluc, VLPs were serially diluted into passive lysis buffer (PLB) (catalog no. E194A; Promega) and introduced into opaque microplate wells (50 l per well). Renilla luciferase substrate (1.1 M NaCl, 2.2 mM Na 2 EDTA, 0.22 M KH 2 PO 4 , 1.3 mM NaN 3 , 0.44 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 M coelenterazine [pH 5]) was added (100 l per well), and luminescence was read using a Veritas microplate luminometer (Turner BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA). VLPs were incubated for 2 h at 4°C to adherent, confluent cells, either with or without prior neuraminidase treatments. Incubations were in FBS-free DMEM and at known Rluc VLP/cell ratios. After incubation, unbound VLPs were removed, and cells were rinsed variably with PBS. To measure cell-bound VLPs, adherent cells were dissolved into PLB, and Rluc activity was quantified. VLP entry assay. VLPs used for entry assays were prepared by cotransfection with plasmids encoding CoV S, E (envelope), M (matrix), and DSP 8-11 -N. The resulting VLPs contained DSP fragments in their interiors. To quantify VLP-associated DSP levels, VLPs were mixed with excess DSP 1-7 , in passive lysis buffer, for 30 min at 37°C, to allow for DSP complementation. The excess DSP 1-7 was obtained from HEK293 cells overexpressing these fragments. After postlysis complementation, samples were introduced into opaque microplate wells and luminescence readings were used to infer DSP [8] [9] [10] [11] levels. VLPs in FBS-free DMEM were inoculated onto target cells that were transfected 2 days earlier with pDSP [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Indicated experiments included cotransfection of target cells with pDSP 1-7 and pCAGGS-TMPRSS2 FLAG (44) . For VLP inoculations, input multiplicities were normalized to VLP DSP 8-11 levels. After 6 h at 37°C, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and dissolved in passive lysis buffer, and Rluc activities were quantified. Virus and pseudovirus particle entry assays. Virus particles were incubated with cells, either with or without prior neuraminidase treatments, for 2 h at 4°C. Cells were then rinsed three times with PBS and replenished with FBS-containing DMEM/MEM. After 16 h at 37°C, cells were dissolved in lysis buffer (25 mM Cell-cell fusion assay. Effector and target cells were prepared by introducing expression plasmids, using the PEI transfection method. Effector cells were cotransfected with pDSP 1-7 and the indicated S-expressing plasmids. S-expressing plasmids included pcDNA3.1-229E S C9 (GenBank accession no. AB691763.1, obtained from Fang Li, University of Minnesota). Control effector cells received pDSP 1-7 and empty vector plasmids. Target cells were cotransfected with pDSP [8] [9] [10] [11] and the indicated S receptorexpressing plasmids. These plasmids included pCMV6-Entry-hDPP4 FLAG (GenBank accession no. NM_001935; purchased from OriGene) and pcDNA3.1-hAPN (GenBank accession no. M22324; obtained from Fang Li). Indicated experiments included additional cotransfection of target cells with pCAGGS-TMPRSS2 FLAG (44) . At 6 h posttransfection, effector and target cells were rinsed with PBS, lifted with 0.05% trypsin, and mixed at 1:1 ratios. The cocultures were incubated for 2 to 18 h at 37°C. Fused cells were visualized microscopically as green fluorescent protein-positive (GFP ϩ ) cells, and extents of cell-cell fusion were quantified as Rluc activities present in PLB cell lysates. Samples were chilled and maintained at 4°C during Rluc quantifications to eliminate DSP postlysis complementation. In time course experiments, EnduRen substrate (Promega E6482) was used in place of coelenterazine. Fc constructs. pCEP4-mCEACAM-Fc was constructed previously (31) . Splice overlap extension PCR was used to insert an MreI restriction site and GSGGGG linker codons between the mCEACAM (codons 1 to 142) and the human IgG1 splice donor site. Using this modified construct, the mCEACAM coding region was removed and replaced with MERS-S1A (codons 1 to 357), MERS S1A (N222D), and MERS S1B (codons 1 to 24 from human CD5 [hCD5] signal, followed by MERS S codons 358 to 588). HEK293T cells were transfected using the PEI method and then incubated in FBS-free DMEM containing 2% (wt/vol) Cell Boost 5 (HyClone). Supernatants were collected on days 4 and 7 and clarified by sequential centrifugation (300 ϫ g, 4°C, 10 min; 4,500 ϫ g, 4°C, 10 min). The Fc-tagged proteins were then purified using HiTrap protein A high-performance columns (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The resulting purified proteins were quantified spectrophotometrically and stored at -20°C until use. Western blotting. Proteins in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solubilizer (0.0625 M Tris·HCl [pH 6.8], 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 2% [wt/vol] SDS, with 2% 2-mercaptoethanol] were heated at 95°C for 5 min, electrophoresed through 8% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide-SDS gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-MHV-HR2 10G (obtained from Fumihiro Taguchi, Nippon Veterinary and Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan), mouse anti-C9 (EMD Millipore), mouse monoclonal anti-MHV HE, clone 5A11, or goat anti-human IgG (sc-2453; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). After incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-tagged secondary antibodies and chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher), the blots were imaged and processed with a FluorChem E (Protein Simple). Microscopy and image acquisition. Live-cell images were captured in a z series on an electronmultiplied charge-coupled-device digital camera (EMCCD Cascade 2; Photometrics) and deconvolved using SoftWoRx. Identical conditions were applied to all acquisitions. Deconvolved images were analyzed by an identical algorithm in Imaris 8.3.1 (Bitplane). Statistical analysis. Unless stated otherwise, all experiments were repeated independently at least three times. Each data point graphed represents the mean of an independent repeat (N), generated from three or four technical repetitions (n ϭ 3 or 4). Statistical comparisons were made by unpaired Student's t test. Error bars indicate the standard errors of the data. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
