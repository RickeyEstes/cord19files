The results obtained with the three variants of the blocking ELISA method were compared by means of box titrations in microtitre plate wells precoated with monoclonal or polyclonal PEDV antibodies. Mixtures containing faeces of an experimentally infected piglet collected 48 hpi and SwSneg. or SwSpos. at working dilutions of 1:2 to 1:128 or 1:10 to 1:640, respectively, were examined. The average absorbance, the NA and %B values of the reactions obtained with SwS dilutions 1:10 and 1:160 are shown in Table 1 . In variant 1 with binding mAbPEDV and detection HRPO-mAbPEDV antibo-dies, the faecal sample was positive only at the dilutions 1:2 and 1:8. In variant 3 with binding SwAPEDV and detection HRPO-mAbPEDV antibodies, a slightly higher sensitivity was detected. Optimal results were obtained using variant 2, with binding SwAPEDV and detection HRPO-SwAMoIg antibodies. The sample was tested positive (NA > 0.1; %B > 50) even at an antigen dilution of 1:128. Table 1 shows that at high PEDV concentrations and low SwS concentrations, the absorbance values were consistently high, although the %B qualified the result as negative. By contrast, low absorbance values were obtained at a low PEDV concentration, while the %B was positive. The CB-ELISA method using dilutions of faeces and SwSneg./pos. 1:2 and 1:40, respectively, was selected for routine examination of field samples. Under the selected conditions (NA > 0.1; %B > 50), sample evaluation was highly specific as established by examination of selected positive and negative samples in eight wells (n = 8). The calculated coefficients of variation CV% ranged from 3.2 to 5.7%. Only with negative samples giving very low absorbance values, CV% occasionally exceeded 10%.
