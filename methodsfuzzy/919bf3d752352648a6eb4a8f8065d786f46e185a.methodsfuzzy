Various G-quadruplex-based detection techniques use enzymes to enhance the signal for the detection event. Of these, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification is probably the most utilized [44] [45] [46] . Enzymatic amplification techniques that have been used to detect various analytes, including small molecules [47] [48] [49] [50] , metal ions [47, 50, 51] and proteins [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] have been described.
