Primary Glial Cell Cultures. Primary glial cell cultures were established from neonatal rat cerebra as previously described (31) . Meninges were removed before culture. Culture medium was Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM), high glucose formula supplemented with glucose to a final concentration of 6 g/liter, 2 mM glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acid mixture, 0.1% gentamycin, and 10% FCS (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) . Oligodendrocytes were separated from the astrocytes by mechanical dislodging after 14 d in primary culture, and then the astrocytes were obtained by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA) . The astrocytes were monitored for purity by immunofluorescence. The cells were stained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intracellular antigen unique to astrorytes, using a mAb to GFAP (1 :4) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by a 30-min incubation with goat anti-mouse Ig-FITC (1:20). Astrocyte cultures were routinely >97% positive for GFAP, and <2% of the cells were microglia based on their positive staining for nonspecific esterase and MAC-1, a mAb that reacts with the C3b receptor. In subsequent experiments, astrocytes were purified by four repetitions of trypsinization and replating to remove contaminating microglia ; after such manipulation, the astrocyte cultures were >99% positive for GFAP, and negative for nonspecific esterase and MAC-1 staining. Microglia were purified by a differential adhesion technique as described by Sasaki et al. (32) . Confluent mixed glial cultures were shaken at 270 rpm for 3 h, at which time floating cells were removed. The cells were plated in a 25-cmz tissue culture flask, and allowed to adhere for 1 h. Microglia adhere to plastic during this time period, while contaminating astrocytes and oligodendrocytes remain in the media. The adherent cells were positive for MAC-1 and nonspecific esterase (90%). Rat Strains. The rat strains used for this study include Lewis (RT11), BN (RT1°), and the F, hybrid (Lewis x BN). All rats were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Prattville, AL). Peritoneal Macrophage Cultures. Rat peritoneal macrophages were isolated from adult Lewis and BN rats. Macrophages were removed by peritoneal lavage with ice-cold PBS, separated from contaminating red blood cells by a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient, and then plated onto 60-mm tissue culture dishes . Nonadherent cells were removed after 4 h, and the cells were cultured for an additional 48 h before stimulation for TNF-a production . Reagents. Rat rIFN-y (sp act, 4 x 106 U/mg) and human rIL 1/3 (sp act, 5 x 10 8 U/mg) were obtained from AmGen Biologicals (Thousand Oaks, CA). Human rTNF-a (sp act, 5.6 x 10' U/mg) was the generous gift of Genentech, Inc. Cytokine Production by Astrocytes. Primary rat astrocytes were resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FCS, and plated at 106 cells/well into six-well (35-mm) plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). The plates were incubated overnight to allow recovery of the cells from trypsinization and to assure adherence of the astrocytes . When the astrocytes reached confluency (1-2 d after plating), the original media was aspirated off, and 2 ml of DMEM containing 2% FCS was added to the wells. Astrocytes were treated with LPS (0-10 ug/ml), rat rIFN-y (0-1,000 U/ml), human rIIL10 (0-1,000 U/ml), or a combination of the above for various time periods (0-2 d) . To induce cytokine production in astrocytes, a number of strategies were used that included the simultaneous addition of different agents or pretreatment with one agent before the addition of another. Supernatants were collected, centrifuged to remove contaminating cells, and stored at -70°C until use. Peritoneal macrophages and microglia were plated at 0.5 x 106 cells/well into 12-well plates, cultured for 48 h, then stimulated for TNF-a production as described above. Measurement of TNF-a Activity. TNF-a activity in culture supernatants was determined in a biologic assay using WEHI 164 clone 13 mouse fibrosarcoma cells as previously described (11) . TNF-cr activity was expressed as TNF-a per culture supernatant (pg/ml). The absolute concentration of TNF-a (pg/ml) was determined by extrapolation from the standard curve, which was generated by using known amounts of human rTNF-a . The lower levels of TNF-a sensitivity in our assay system ranged from 4 to 20 pg TNF-a/ml . All samples were tested in triplicate and are presented as the mean ± SD . Measurement ofIL6 Protein Activity. IL-6 activity in culture supernatants was determined in a biologic assay using the IL-6dependent B cell hybridoma 7TD1 as previously described (14, 33, 34) . 11,6 activity was expressed as U/ml of 11,6 based on extrapolation from the standard curve, which was generatedby using known amounts of murine rlIT6. All samples were assayed in triplicate . Statistical Analysis. Levels of significance for comparisons between samples were determined using the student t test distribution . RNA Isolation. Total cellular RNA was isolated from confluent 803 Chung et al. monolayers of astrocytes that had been incubated with culture media, LPS, IFN-y plus LPS, and IFN-y plus IIT1# for various time intervals. RNA isolation followed the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (35), as previously described (11) . Briefly, cells were scraped and washed two times in PBS, and pelleted . RNA was extracted with guanidinium isothiocyanate and phenol, and precipitated with ethanol. Polymerase Chain Reaction. PCR was performed as previously described (11, (36) (37) (38) . Briefly, 2 kg of total RNA isolated from astrocyte cultures was reverse transcribed by 200 U of Moloney mouse leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Bethesda Research Laboratories, Bethesda, MD) for 10 min at room temperature, then 1 h at 42°C, using oligo(dT) as a primer, in a final volume of 20 Al . The resultingcDNA was amplified with 2 U of AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase (Perkin Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT) in a final volume of 100 Al, containing 10 mM Tris-HCI, 50 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCI, 0.01% gelatin, 1 mM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 100 pmol each of primers I and II . Primer I (ATGAG-CACAGAAAGCATGATC) is complementary to position 144-164 of the 5' end of mouse TNF-ca cDNA (39) , and primer II (TACAGGCTTGTCACTCGAATT) is complementary to position 399-419 of the 3' end of the mouse TNF-a mRNA . Amplification was carried out in a twin block system (Ericomp Inc., San Diego, CA) for 30 cycles (one cycle = 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 3 min, and 72°C for 3 min) . Aliquots (1-16 141) of each resulting reaction mixture were applied to a 1% agarose gel, subjected to electrophoresis, and visualized by Southern blot hybridization with a 1,300bp mouse TNT-a cDNA insert (40) . The autoradiographs were quantitated by scanning densitometry with a video densitometer (620 ; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). cDNA Probes. Plasmid containing the 1,300-bp mouse TNF-ac cDNA was the generous gift of Dr. Bruce Beutler (University of Texas at Dallas). The 1,300-bp insert was excised with Pstl and EcoRI, purified and labeled with a-['1P]deoxyCTP using an nick translation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL).
