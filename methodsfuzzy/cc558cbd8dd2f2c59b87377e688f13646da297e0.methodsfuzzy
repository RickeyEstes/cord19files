In vitro assay for viral detection: viral culture Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that require living cells in order to replicate; since viruses require cellular machinery for replication, living systems must be used. The viral culture is an amplification method that increases the amount of the pathogen, facilitating detection and characterization. This method is unique among detection methods in that it provides an isolate of viable virus that can be further characterized and stored for future studies. Another important feature is that culture methods allow the detection of many different viruses, including some not suspected at the time the culture is established; even viruses not previously known can be discovered. A cell lysate or other specimens (e.g. biological products, specimens from donors) should be introduced into the cell culture capable of detecting wide ranges of viruses. The instructions for obtaining and transporting such specimens have been previously reported (Storch, 2001) . Usually, a minimum of three cell lines that include a human diploid cell line (MRC-5), a monkey kidney cell line (Vero) and a cell type of the same species and tissue type used for production (Schiff, 2005) is recommended. Additional cells may be required depending on the cell source, passage history and raw materials used. After inoculation, cultures are incubated at 35 to 37 -C for either 14 or 28 days and inspected periodically (e.g. daily) and observed for the cytopathic effect of several viruses, including the recently reported method of analysis of HIV virus cytopathicity by using Hi-CD4 Jurkat T cells cultures (Speirs et al., 2005) . In certain circumstances, the observation period can be greater than 28 days for the identification of many viruses (e.g. human cytomegalovirus). Virus detection by testing the inoculated cell culture for hemadsorption and/or hemagglutination (Ayala et al., 2004) should be necessary for viruses with only minimal visible cytopathic effect. However, viral culture also has significant disadvantages as a diagnostic method, including the need for specialized facilities and expertise, expense and relatively prolonged time to detection. Diagnostic virology is being revolutionized by the application of nucleic acid detection techniques (Tang et al., 1997) . Nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests detect only the specific virus to which the diagnostic reagent is directed. These methods detect specific nucleic acid sequences and can be applied to the detection of virtually any virus. Depending on the target sequence, the assays can be specific for a single virus species or for a group of related viruses. Nucleic acid amplification assays are particularly attractive for viruses that are difficult or impossible to culture, viruses that grow slowly in culture and viruses for which antigen detection cannot be applied because of antigenic diversity or because the level of viral antigen is too low to permit successful detection. PCR is the prototype of target amplification assays invented by Kary Mullis in 1983 (Mullis and Faloona, 1987; Mullis, 1990) . PCR is based on the ability of DNA polymerase to copy a strand of DNA by elongation of complementary strands initiated from a pair of closely spaced chemically synthesized oligonucleotide primers and includes repeated cycles of amplifying selected nucleic acid sequences (Mullis and Faloona, 1987; Mullis, 1990) . After PCR amplification, the PCR product (or amplicon) is detected by gel electrophoresis or one of several probe-hybridization techniques, such as Southern blot. Numerous modifications of the standard PCR procedure have been developed since its inception (Erlich et al., 1991; Wagar, 1996) . Some of these modifications effectively expand the diagnostic capabilities of PCR and have increased its utility in the microbiology laboratory. RT-PCR was developed to amplify RNA targets. In this process, RNA targets are first converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) by reverse transcriptase (RT), and then amplified by PCR. RT-PCR has played an important role in diagnosing RNA containing virus infections (Young et al., 1993) . Several new PCR assays have been developed in which the synthesis of the PCR product is detected in real-time (Realtime quantitative PCR) (Gibson et al., 1996; Heid et al., 1996) . Real-time quantitative PCR is a homogeneous method that includes both amplification and analysis with no need for slab gels, radioactivity or sample manipulation. Reaction products are detected with a fluorescence detection system consisting of a light-emitting diode that delivers excitation light to each reaction tube and an optical unit with three detection channels to record emitted light. The fluorescence of DNA dyes or probes is monitored each cycle during PCR. The simplest system for detection of real-time PCR products uses the DNAbinding dye SYBR Green, which fluoresces when its binds to double-stranded DNA. These methods have several important advantages over conventional PCR. Since the accumulation of PCR product is monitored in the reaction tube, no separate detection method, such as gel electrophoresis, is required, thus shortening the effective assay markedly. Furthermore, the possibility of contamination by amplicons is decreased because the systems are closed, with no handling of the reaction contents after completion of PCR. The use of multiple fluorescent dyes with different emission wavelengths makes it possible to perform multiplex reactions with simultaneous amplification of more than one product. Moreover, other molecular methods have been described and introduced for the viral diagnosis, like nucleic acid probes (Denniston et al., 1986) , Branched DNA signal amplification (Urdea et al., 1991) , nested PCR (Erlich et al., 1991) and multiplex PCR (Dineva et al., 2005) , etc. Real-time multiplex PCR can analyze multiple viruses simultaneously within a single reaction. The main advantages of multiplexing over single-target analysis are the ability to provide internal controls, lower reagent costs and preservation of precious samples. Multiplexing can be particularly important when there is a need to analyze several viruses from the samples. There are several assays that use a real-time multiplex RT-PCR technology for diagnosis of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and HIV-1 virus (Candotti et al., 2004) . There are other authors who have described several assays using this procedures for retroviruses (Vet et al., 1999) and herpesviruses (O'Neill et al., 2003) . The advantages of molecular methods, especially the PCR technique, are their extremely high sensitivity (they may detect down to one viral genome per sample volume), they are easy to set up and have a fast turnaround time. However, the main inconvenience is that for each virus or group of virus one PCR is necessary, so if the amount of viruses to carry out is large, these techniques are the same unviable for the laboratory. The development of microarrays has been fueled by the application of robotic technology to routine molecular biology, rather than by any fundamental breakthrough. Southern and Northern blotting techniques for the detection of specific DNA and mRNA species provided the technological basis for microarray hybridization. The construction of arrays involves the spotting of specific DNA sequences on a glass slide or small silicon chip by photolithographic combinatorial chemistry methods similar to those used to make electronic chips. Membrane-based arrays may be in the format of line probe blots. The results of hybridization between the bound probe and labeled sequences in the sample applied and tested are revealed by scanning or imaging the array surface. Confocal microscopy is used to scan the chip, detecting fluorescent signals that reveal hybridization at precise locations on the chip. Use of probes representing all possible nucleotide sequence variations within a target sequence allows rapid determination of nucleotide sequence (Pease et al., 1994) . High density arrays, which may have thousands of individual probes per cm 2 , are referred to as microarrays. These microarrays on silicon surfaces are therefore known as ''DNA chips''. As many DNA sequences can be present on a slide, it is possible for microarray analysis to test for multiple pathogens (including viruses) simultaneously. The first application in diagnostic virology has been for rapid sequencing to detect HIV mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs (Kozal et al., 1996) . Other roles in virology are in diagnosis, to recognize the causative agent of an illness; for molecular typing (e.g. patient management, epidemiological reasons, purposes related to vaccine use) and in research, to investigate the interactions between the virus and the host cells (Clewley, 2004) . The RNA expression of human CMV in cell culture in the presence or absence of cycloheximide or ganciclovir was analyzed with an array of oligonucleotides representing human CMV ORFs (Chambers et al., 1999) . Other groups have developed microarrays that detect simultaneously and discriminate several viruses like orthopoxvirus species (Laassri et al., 2003) , respiratory viruses (Coiras et al., 2005) , herpesviruses, enteroviruses and flaviviruses (Korimbocus et al., 2005 ) and hepatitis C virus (Xu et al., 2005) . Also, Wilson et al. (2002) developed a multi-pathogen identification microarray system for the identification of 18 pathogenic prokaryotes, eukaryotes and viruses. The simplicity of the microarray protocols, together with their use of a large number of species-specific oligoprobes and their ability to analyze multiple samples in a short time, offers clear advantages. However, such techniques will need to be carefully validated for sensitivity and specificity before being applied in the safety testing of human tissue products and stem cell lines for therapy. Table 1 shows a comparison of diagnostic methods for viruses. An interesting potential for infected cell cultures may be the discovery of biological markers of prion infection, mainly by comparing control versus infected cultures. This type of experiment was first performed at a genetic level. With the development of sophisticated proteomic approaches, several groups are looking for differentially expressed proteins that could be used as diagnostic markers or at least could give some clue as to the physiopathological event leading to prion propagation. Having developed cell lines highly susceptible to prion infection (Bosque and Prusiner, 2000; Nishida et al., 2000) , another potential of cell culture consists of the detection of infectivity in various biological samples. The main sources of transmission of prion proteins to culture cells are the bovine fetal serum, the feeder cells from murine animals and the biological products from donors with TSE to establish stem cell lines. In stem cell banks, there is an urgent need for tests for the agents of TSEs such as the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (U.S. Food and Drugs Administration, 1999) . At the moment, there are several types of tests that can be used for this question.
