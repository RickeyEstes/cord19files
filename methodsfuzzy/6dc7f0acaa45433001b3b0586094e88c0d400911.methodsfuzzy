Method of validation was carried out as per International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines for linearity range, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, recovery as accuracy and robustness (ICH 2005) . The determination of LOD and LOQ was calculated using formula LOD ¼ 3.3(SD/S) and LOQ ¼ 10(SD/S), respectively, based on the standard deviation of the response (SD) and the slope (S) of the calibration curve. The precision (Intra-day and Inter-day) of the proposed HPTLC methods were evaluated for all biomarkers by performing replicate analysis (n ¼ 6) at three different concentration levels (low, medium and high) viz. 400, 600 and 800 ng/ band. The precision was recorded as Mean ± SD, %RSD and SEM of each calibration level. Recovery as accuracy studies involved the addition of a known amount of analyte to a sample, and determining the percentage of added analyte. For the biomarkers rutin, quercetin, naringenin and gallic acid, a known amount of 50, 100 and 150% of 200 ng, each was added and the recovery percentage of the spiked standards was estimated. The robustness of the proposed HPTLC methods were performed to analyze its capacity to remain unaffected by a small, but deliberate variations in mobile phase composition, mobile phase volume used for saturation and duration of saturation which indicates the reliability of the method during normal use. The robustness study was performed in replicate analysis (n ¼ 6) for all the markers at 300 ng/ band concentration. The results were evaluated in terms of SD, %RSD and SEM of peak area. In RP-HPTLC method, the mobile phases were prepared from acetonitrile: water (4:6, v/v) in different proportions (3.8:6.2, v/v and 4.2:5.8, v/v) and analyzed. In case of NP-HPTLC method, the different mobile phases (5.8:4.2:0.8 and 6.2:3.8:0.8, v/v/v) were prepared from toluene: ethyl acetate: gallic acid (6:4:0.8, v/v/v) and used for the analysis of markers to check its robustness. In addition to the minor variations in the mobile phases, the volume used for saturation was also varied from 20 to 18 and 22 mL. The duration of saturation also varied to 10 and 30 min from 20 min in the analysis. The mobile phase used in RP-and NP-HPTLC analyses was selected by testing several compositions of different solvents. Of these, combination of acetonitrile and water (4:6, v/v) under chamber saturation condition was found to be the best mobile phase for the development and quantitative analysis of rutin and quercetin on RP-HPTLC plates. This method exhibited the clear separation of the two biomarkers along with the different constituents of GSEE ( Figure 1 ). On the other hand, for the analysis of naringenin and gallic acid on NP-HPTLC plates, the best mobile phase was the combination of toluene, ethyl acetate and gallic acid (6:4:0.8, v/v/v) which allowed their clear separation along with the different constituents of GSEE ( Figure 2 ). The optimized saturation time and volume of mobile phase for saturation were 20 min and 20 mL, respectively. The densitometric analysis of the biomarkers by the two HPTLC methods showed clearly separated compact, sharp, symmetrical and high resolution bands of rutin, quercetin, naringenin and gallic acid. While the bands of rutin and quercetin were obtained at R f 0.52 ± 0.006 and 0.23 ± 0.005, respectively (Figure 3) , those of naringenin and gallic acid were recorded at R f 0.56 ± 0.009 and 0.28 ± 0.006, respectively ( Figure 4) . The developed methods were thus, found quite selective with a good baseline resolution. Linearity of marker compounds rutin, quercetin, naringenin and gallic acid were validated by the linear regression equation and correlation coefficient. The seven-point calibration curve for rutin and quercetin was found linear in the range of 200-1400 ng whereas for naringenin and gallic acid it was in the range of 100-1200 ng. The observed regression equation (Y) and coefficient correlation (r 2 ) values for the biomarkers (Table 1 ) revealed a good linearity response for the developed methods. The LOD and LOQ for rutin, quercetin, naringenin, and gallic acid were also recorded ( Table 1) which indicated that the proposed method exhibits a good sensitivity for the simultaneous quantification of the above compounds. The %recovery, %RSD, and SEM were recorded in for rutin and quercetin (Table 2) , and naringenin and gallic acid (Table 3) for recoveries as accuracy study for the proposed methods. The intra-and inter-day precision (n ¼ 6) for the proposed RP-and NP-HPTLC methods were recorded as %RSD and SEM for rutin and quercetin (Table 4) , and for naringenin and gallic acid ( Table 5 ). The observed low values of %RSD and SEM indicated the good precision of both methods. Further, the low values of SD, %RSD and SEM obtained after introducing small deliberate changes in the two methods demonstrated the robustness of NP-HPTLC for rutin and quercetin (Table 6) , and RP-HPTLC for naringenin and gallic acid (Table 7) .
