Virus isolation. The NJ cell line is a mouse neuroblastoma cell line chronically infected with JHM virus . Single cell clones were obtained in the presence of 1% heat-inactivated (56" for 30 min) anti-JHM virus hype~mmune ascitic fluid (plaque reduction neutra~~tion titer = 115000). Virus was isolated from these non-virusproducing cell clones by fusion with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to either DBT (Hirano et al., 1974) or 17 clone l(17CLl) (Sturman and Takamoto, 1972) cell lines by the method of Pontecorvo (1975) . Briefly, cocultivated cultures were washed twice with Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM~ ~thout serum, 1.0 ml of a sterile 50% solution of PEG (mw 6000, Koch Light) in DMEM, pH 7.8, was added to each plate with agitation for 1 min at room temperature. Excess PEG was removed, and 2.0 ml of DMEM was added. At 1-min intervals, 0.2-,0.2-, 0.2",0.5-, l.O-,and2&mlvolumes of DMEM were added and mixed thoroughly. The DMEM was removed 1 min after the final additon and replaced with 5.0 ml of DMEM conning 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). After 18 hr incubation, the medium was removed and replaced with 5.0 ml of DMEM containing2% FCS. The plates were further incubated for 96 hr and checked for CPE. Supernatants containing virus were removed from cultures showing viral CPE at 96 hr postfusion. Preparation of viw subclones. The original fluid from the fused cultures was used as starting material for the preparation of subclones, Clones were plaque purified three times in DBT cells. Isolated plaques were recovered and p~pagated in DBT cells. Following the third plaque purification, pools were prepared by infecting DBT cells at an m.o.i. of 0.001. These pools were used for all studies described. Thewzul inactivation. Thermal inactivation studies were performed at 42". Parent stocks of the virus isolated from the original fusion plates and plaque-purified clones were tested. Virus was adjusted to approximately lo5 PFUlml in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2 (PBS) containing 10% heatinactivated, y-globulin-free FCS. At various times from 15 to 180 min, samples were removed, flash frozen in dry ice-acetone, and stored at -70". Residual infectivity was determined by plaque assay on DBT cells at 37" as previously described . Co~p~e~e~tat~on. Complemen~tion experiments were carried out by infecting DBT cells at a multiplicity of infection of 10 PFU per cell. Following adsorption for 60 min at 32", the cells were washed twice with medium and incubated for 14 hr at 32". Supernatants were assayed for infectious virus at 37". For experiments in which JHM virus was tested, the DL clone of JHM virus (Lai and Stohlman, 1978) was used at an m.o.i. of 1.0. The eomplementation index was calculated as the ratio: yield from the mixed infection at the restrictive temperature (32") divided by the sum of the yields from the single infections at 32". The yields were assayed at 37"; results were identical to assays at 39" except that the plaques were better defined. Vims-specify RNA synthesis. DBT cells were used to determine virus-specified RNA synthesis. Preliminary experiments showed that infection at an m.o.i. of 1.0 resulted in approximately 80% of the cells scoring as infectious centers . Monolayers of DBT cells in 16-mmdiameter wells were infected at an m.o.i. of STOHLMAN, SAKAGUCHI, AND WEINER approximately 10 for 1 hr at room temperature. After removal of the inoculum, 1 ml of warm DMEM containing 2% FCS was added, and duplicate cultures were incubated at either 32 or 39" for 1 hr. The medium was removed, the cultures were washed one time with medium, and finally 1 ml of DMEM containing 2% FCS, 2 pg/ml actinomyein D (a gift of Merck, Sharpe, and Dohme), and 5 &i of [5-3H]uridine/ml was added. Following incubation for an additional 14 hr, the medium was removed, then cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and the monolayers were solubilized with 2% (w/v) sodium lauryl sulfate in Ca2+-and Mg2+-free PBS. An equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid was added and the precipitate collected by filtration on Whatman GF/C glass-fiber filters after at least 8 hr at 4". The filters were dried and counted as previously described (Lai and Stohlman, 1978) . Clones were assigned an RNAphenotype if they synthesized less than 20% of the virus specific RNA at 32" compared to the amount synthesized at 39". Temperature shi,ft experiments. DBT cell monolayers were infected at an m.o.i. of approximately 5. Following incubation for 60 min at room temperature, unabsorbed virus was removed by two rinses with serum-free DMEM, and the plates were fed with 2.0 ml of prewarmed DMEM containing 2% FCS. Cultures were immediately placed at either 32 or 39" and shifted to the alternate temperature at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 hr after the start of the experiment. At each temperature shift time point, samples of supernatants were taken for virus assay. The plates were then further incubated at the new temperature for a total of 12 hr from the start of the experiment. The plates were again sampled at the termination of the experiment. Virus samples were titered on monolayers of DBT cells at 3'7" as previously described .
