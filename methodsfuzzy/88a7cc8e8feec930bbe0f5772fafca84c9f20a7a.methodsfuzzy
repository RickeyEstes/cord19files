Sixty-six 14 to 16-day-old piglets from litters of conventionally weaned York swine received an intragastric inoculum of a standard dose of TGE virus,' and 20 uninfected littermates, matched for food intake and age, served as controls. Groups of animals were killed at intervals of 6-144 hr after infection and intestine taken from 3 sites-proximal jejunum (5-15 cm from ligament of Treitz), mid small intestine (10 cm around midpoint), and ileum (5-65 cm from ileocecal sphincter). In'the first study at 6, 12, 24, 30, 40, 72 , and 144 hr, we examined epithelial viral immunofluorescence (IF) and mucosal structure at all three sites and measured sucrase and thymidine kinase activities in isolated villus cells from the ileal segment. Viral TGE antigen was detected by direct IF, using a fluorescein-conjugated porcine anti-TGE globulin (used for IF diagnosis of field cases, and kindly donated by Dr. A. Gagnon, University of Guelph). Specificity was tested by twostage inhibition using TGE-inoculated and noninfected Ileal villus enterocytes were isolated selectively with a vibration technique that excludes crypt cells,'o and the presence of intact crypts was confirmed by microscope examination of tissue after the isolation procedure. For enzyme analyses, cells were homogenized and stored at -20Â°C for assays of thymidine kinase and sucrase activity.' In the second study, enterocyte migration in proximal jejunum and ileum was measured by autoradiography. Piglets were injected with [3H]thymidine (0.3 /LCi/g) , and subgroups were killed 6, 12, or 24 hr later so that migration of labeled cells could be measured in relation to mucosal structure. Migration was studied during three stages of the disease (0-24, 36-60, and 120-144 hr) and compared with control data, using six-eight piglets for each study period. Samples of intestine from each site were oriented on wax, fixed in Bouin's reagent for 12 hr, transferred to 95% alcohol, and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections ( Coded sections were examined with a calibrated eyepiece by one person, who selected from each section (excluding areas over Peyer's patches) 10-30 longitudinally well-oriented crypt-villus columns with the lumen in continuity. Crypt-villus column height and the distance of foremost labeled cells (FLC) from crypt base were measured; in addition, to allow for changes in column height, the mean position of FLC was expressed as a percentage of column height. Migration rates were expressed as change in position of FLC per hour, and the mean enterocyte transit time (time taken for label to reach the villus tips) was calculated for each stage of the disease. Results were analyzed with Student's t-test. Analyses of enzyme data were based on the assumption of a logarithmic distribution for the data, and the results were expressed as antilogarithms.
