As mentioned earlier, our dataset was obtained from the website of the Control and Command Center of Saudi Ministry of Health [1]. We used the data on MERS-CoV infections reported between 2013 and 2015. The data was published in three separate categories: new cases, recoveries, and deaths. For all the categories, the following patient information was provided: gender, age, nationality, city, and whether the patient is a healthcare personnel or not. In addition, there was more specific information for each category. The additional information is as follows: • New cases: symptomatic, current status, and whether the patient had any contact with suspected or confirmed MERS-CoV infection case. • Recoveries and deaths: does the patient have pre-existing diseases. We collected 633 new case records, 231 recovery records, and 218 death records, for a total of 1082 records. A sample of the original dataset is shown in Fig. 1 . The dataset was published in different formats. Some of the records were found as text files. Other records were provided in image format. Thus, our first step was to prepare the data in a unified format appropriate for data mining. Information in image format was manually extracted. Records with missing and inconsistent values (ex. gender is adult) were excluded. The age attribute was converted to discrete values. Finally, all records were prepared in .csv format. In order to build our prediction models, we split the dataset into two groups. The first group consisted of recovery and death records. A new attribute was created to indicate the record type, such that the dataset can be used to predict the recovery from MERS-CoV. The second group contained the new case records to be used to predict the stability of the infection based on the current status attribute.
