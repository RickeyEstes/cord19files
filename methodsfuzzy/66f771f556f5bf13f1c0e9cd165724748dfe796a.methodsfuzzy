Astrovirus serotype 1, isolate A88/2 (Newcastle), was grown in CaCO 2 cells using a stool extract as inoculum [4] and RNA was harvested during this first passage, cDNA was synthesized in a primer extension reaction using the oligonucleotide 5'-GATGGCATACACATCA-3' (termed primer 1) which hybridized 878-893 bases from the 3' end of the genome determined from our previous sequence [8] . cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription and converted to a doublestrand with DNA polymerase 1. Any ragged ends were repaired with T4 DNA polymerase before the cDNA was ligated to BstXI linkers and ligated to the plasmid vector pcDNA II (Invitrogen) cut with the same enzyme. The longest clone obtained was termed p22A8. This and other clones were then sequenced using a Sequenase reaction kit (United States Biochemicals). The 5' The amplification product was cloned into the vector pTZ18R at the SmaI site and sequenced, before transfer to the baculovirus shuttle vector pVL1392. The construct was combined with SauI linearized baculovirus (Lac-z) DNA for co-transfection into Sf21 cells using the methods described by King and Possee [12] . Virus yield was harvested, plaqued on Sf21 monolayers and stained with X-gal. White plaques were picked and tested for the presence of astrovirus sequences by hybridization. Expressed proteins were analysed by immuno-precipitation. Sf21 cells were labelled with 0.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline (pH 6.6) containing 20 /xCi/ml of 35S-Trans label (ICN-Flow) for 1 h. Ceils were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCI, 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1.0% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors, and the nuclei were removed by sedimentation. Virus-specific proteins were immunoprecipitated [13] with rabbit serum raised to purified virus (kindly supplied by Mr. T. Lee, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford) and analysed by electrophoresis. Fig. 2 . Sequence of the astrovirus serotype 1 capsid gene. The sequence determined from clone 22A8 described here is shown assembled to that of clone 21T43 reported previously (EMBL Ac. No. Zl1682), Putative translation products are shown below. The incomplete non-structural proteins extend from the 5' end to terminate at position 305. Structural gene products are shown commencing at the first ATG in the subgenomic message, position 300, Primer extension products defining the 5' end of the mRNA are illustrated (*). The major termination product is that at position 286.
