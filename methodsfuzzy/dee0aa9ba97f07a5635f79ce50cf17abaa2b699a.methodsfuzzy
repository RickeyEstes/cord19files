All patients with presumptive PTB (cough for >2 weeks, fever for >2 weeks, weight loss, TB contact history or abnormal chest radiograph) were requested to submit 3 sputum specimens (spot, night, morning) for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) with Ziehl-Neelsen smear microscopy before the initiation of treatment. For purposes of internal quality control, all positive smears should be reconfirmed by another microscopist in the same laboratory at the time of smear examination. For purposes of external quality assessment, a randomly selected 10% of isolates from each laboratory were required to be re-tested blindly by a superior laboratory.
