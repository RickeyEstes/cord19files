Three coordinates files were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000) . One file is the ACE2-bound RBD (PDB code: 2AJF) (Li et al., 2005a) , while the others are the RBD complexed with 80R (PDB code: 2GHW) (Hwang et al., 2006) or m396 (PDB code: 2DD8) (Prabakaran et al., 2006) . Both the first and second files harbor a pair of sister complexes. And in the third file, either the heavy chain or the light chain of m396 makes its own contacts with the RBD. Thus, a total of six complex structures (AE/BF for ACE2-RBD, AB/CD for 80R-RBD and HS/LS for m396-RBD) are subject to computational simulations, respectively. Firstly, the program FoldX , based on an empirical effective energy function, was employed for calculation of the binding free energy values of wild type complexes. Then, a computational alanine scanning on the protein-protein interfaces was performed for evaluation of energetical contribution from single binding sites to the complex formation. Those positions yielding a calculated increase in association energy of more than 1 kcal/mol on alanine substitution were defined as energetic hot (important) spots according to previous criteria (Guerois et al., 2002; Guerois and Serrano, 2000; Kiel and Serrano, 2006; Kiel et al., 2004 Kiel et al., , 2005 . The next step was to redesign the interactions between RBD and its binding partners through the software DeepView (Arnold et al., 2006; Guex and Peitsch, 1997) . Each of the binding sites on the RBD, receptor or antibody was saturated with virtual substitutions, i.e., replaced with all the 20 natural amino acid residues except the original one. Finally, the reconstructed models were feed to the program FoldX to compute their binding energies. Here, only the variants rewarded a value of at least 1 kcal/mol lower than that of the wild type were taken into consideration.
