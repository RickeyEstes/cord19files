Further development of carp culture will be accompanied by several changes that have well-established incidences of pathological conditions: increase in culture densities, frequent degradation of environmental quality, mixing of populations of different origin and manipulations etc. All these factors are increasing the probability of the advent and seriousness of diseases. Research on fish pathology has allowed the progressive setting-up of a rather large variety of possible interventions: specific diagnostic methods, sanitary prophylaxis and disinfection, vaccination, chemotherapy, immunomodulation and genetics of disease resistance will continue to supply new possibilities to breeders (Fig. 1) . However, several constraints often make such interventions difficult and expensive; thus prophylaxis based on strict sanitary isolation, which is relatively easy in terrestrial species, is often more difficult in the aquatic environment where the water, other fish species or even invertebrates or other vertebrates constitute potential contaminating agents which are difficult to eliminate (Chevassus and Dorson, 1990; Anderson, 1992) . Antibiotic therapy, mostly applied orally, has more and more to cope with resistance in selected bacteria due to repeated treatments. In theory, vaccination is the most valuable approach, but, so far, effective vaccines are available only for a limited range of pathogens and not for those infecting common carp. In the case of viral diseases, attenuated vaccines are not authorised and killed vaccines are expensive to produce. Both kinds of vaccines also prevent any serological differentiation between vaccinated and contaminated fishes. Research on a recombinant subunit vaccine against spring viraemia of carp aimed at the production of a low-cost, completely safe and effective vaccine could provide a possible solution (Rossius and Thiry, 1993) . The small-scale market is a special challenge for any products to be introduced into aquaculture (De Kinkelin and Michel, 1984) . These limitations raise a question about the future of chemotherapy. Although chemotherapeutic agents are available against a wider range of pathogens than vaccines, they also have limitations in terms of the pathogen groups against which they are effective. Chemotherapy is also a palliative rather than a final solution to problems of disease and its use in the aquatic environment is not free from practical problems. For example, attention is being drawn increasingly to the potential hazards that intensive use of drugs could represent for the environment and for human health. Use of immunomodulators in fish culture offers a wide range of attractive methods for inducing and building up protection against diseases. Immunostimulants may be used alone, inducing elevated activities in the non-specific defence mechanisms (Anderson, 1992; Jeney and Anderson, 1993) . During recent years several substances have been tested in carp to enhance non-specific defence mechanisms and to build up protection against a wide range of pathogens. Levamisole treatment of carp fingerling stimulated growth and reduced natural mortality due to losses (Siwicki and Korwin-Kossakowski, 1988 ). Vitamin C is a popular immunostimulant added to diets of certain animals. Glucans, long-chain polysaccharides extracted from yeasts, are good stimulators of non-specific defence mechanisms in fish. Schizophyllan, scleroglucan, and lentinan were evaluated in carp for their ability to enhance protection against E. tarda and A. hydrophila (Yano et al., 1989 (Yano et al., , 1991 . In fish injected with these polysaccharides increased phagocytic activity and protection against the pathogen were observed. Research on immunostimulants for use in food fish, including carp is in progress. Due to the above-mentioned situation, fish geneticists and pathologists are interested in the search for intrinsic resistance factors protecting the individual during part or the whole of its biological cycle in the course of aquaculture development (Chevassus and Dorson, 1990) . Promising data are available on selective breeding of carp with high tolerance to particular diseases Kirpichnikov, 1986; SijvCnyi et al., 1989; Houghton et al., 1991) ) or to stressful environmental conditions ) as well as on selecting for traits which have proven to be genetically correlated to disease resistance: cortisol -in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout (Refstie, 1986; Fevolden et al., 1991 Fevolden et al., , 1993 .
