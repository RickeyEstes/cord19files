Viruses, cells, and plaque assay. A mouse model of the recombinant mouse-adapted rMA15-SARS-CoV virus used in this study has been previously described (37, 60) . As previously described, virus stocks were propagated on Vero E6 cells (60) . Plaque assays to quantify virus in viral stocks and to enumerate the number of viruses in the lower left lobe of lungs from mice were performed in Vero E6 cells, with a limit of detection of 100 PFU (12) . Experiments with rMA15-SARS-CoV were performed in a certified biosafety level 3 laboratory, using a class II biological safety cabinet. Laboratory workers were equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), Tyvek suits, hoods, aprons, booties, and personal protective equipment. Ethics statement. The ethical treatment of mice in this study was in accordance with the guidelines of The University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IA-CUC), and approved documentation registered under protocol no. 11-213 was used in the experiments described. The guidelines for care of the mice are from the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th ed., published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). All animal housing and care was conducted according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)-approved protocols of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (NIH/PHS Animal Welfare Assurance no. a3410-01). Animals. Animals were maintained in HEPA-filtered Sealsafe cages (Techniplast) during experiments performed with rMA15-SARS-CoV. The following strains of age-matched female mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory: C57B/6NJ (stock no. 005304), TLR3 Ϫ/Ϫ (stock no. 009675), C57BL/6J (stock no. 000664), and TRIF Ϫ/Ϫ (stock no. 005307). At 10 weeks of age, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine and inoculated intranasally with either 50 l of phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) (for mock-inoculated controls) or 10 5 PFU of rMA15-SARS-CoV-PBS. Animals were weighed daily, and lung tissues from days 2, 4, and 7 postinfection (C57BL/6NJ and TLR3 Ϫ/Ϫ mice) or days 2, 4, and 6 postinfection (C57BL/6J and TRIF Ϫ/Ϫ mice) were collected for downstream analyses by plaque assay, histology, and RNA analysis. Flow cytometry. On days 4 and 6 postinfection, whole lungs were harvested from groups of 3 to 4 mock-treated wild-type and TRIF Ϫ/Ϫ mice and 4 to 5 SARS-CoV-infected wild-type and TRIF Ϫ/Ϫ mice. Whole lungs were prepared for flow cytometry analysis by collagenase digestion and tissue disruption into cell suspensions as previously described (11) . Antibody staining panels were used to stain cell preparations (see Text S1 in the supplemental material). Analysis was performed with Summit software (Beckman-Coulter) for sorting into defined subpopulations (see Text S1). Hemorrhage scores, histological analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Scores for gross hemorrhage were recorded by observation of the lung during necropsy using a scale ranging from a value of zero, indicating no hemorrhage, to a value of 4, indicating severe hemorrhage in all lobes of the lung, as previously described (38) . For histological analysis, the entire right lobe of lungs from infected or mock-treated wild-type and knockout mice was fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and prepared in 5-m-thick sections for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain-ing by the UNC Histopathology core facility. For immunohistochemistry (IHC), formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded histology samples from C57BL/6J and TRIF Ϫ/Ϫ mice were sectioned (thickness, 5 m) and stained for viral antigen using a commercially available polyclonal SARS-CoV anti-nucleocapsid antibody (Imgenex) following the manufacturer's protocols (61) . Slides for IHC and H&E histology were scored in a blinded manner (n ϭ 4 to 5 mice per group) for metrics of inflammation, and images were captured using an Olympus BX41 microscope with an Olympus DP71 camera. Whole-body plethysmography. Lung function was measured by unrestrained whole-body plethysmography using IACUC-approved protocols as has been previously described (42) . Briefly, animals were introduced into randomized individual plethysmography chambers following calibration according to protocols of the manufacturer (Buxco). After a 30-min acclimation period, data on lung function parameters were collected during a 5-min measurement period. Data were analyzed by Finepoint software (Buxco) for established metrics of airway hyperresponsiveness and virus infection-associated airway obstruction, including enhanced pause (P ENH ), tidal midexpiratory flow (EF 50 ), and ratio of T PEF to T e (R PEF ). P ENH is an empirical measure calculated by T e ϪT r T r * PEF PIF , where PEF is the peak expiratory flow, PIF is the peak inspiratory flow, T e represents the time of expiration, and T r represents the relaxation time to 36% of the peak expiration pressure (62) . P ENH has been controversially linked to airway hyperresponsiveness, obstruction, and bronchoconstriction but has been used in several viral models of airway infection, where increases in the P ENH value correlate with increased lung pathology following respiratory viral infection (40, 42, (62) (63) (64) . EF 50 indicates the flow rate at 50% of the tidal volume. R PEF is calculated by T PEF T e , where T PEF is the time to peak expiratory flow and T e is the time of expiration, and the ratio may be interpreted as an indication of the shape of the exhalation curve. Real-time qPCR analysis. The upper left lobe of rMA15-SARS-CoVinfected mice was stored in RNAlater solution (Life Technologies) for 48 h at 4°C and then stored at Ϫ80°C. Lung sections were thawed and then homogenized in TRIzol (Life Technologies) for 60 s at 6,000 rpm using a Magna Lyzer instrument (Roche). Following chloroform-isopropanol extraction of RNA from TRIzol homogenates, cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using a SuperScript III First-Strand synthesis kit (Life Technologies). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using TaqMan gene expression assays (Life Technologies) for cytokines or chemokines normalized to 18-s expression. For each cytokine or chemokine, expression from groups of 4 rMA15-SARS-CoV-infected mice was normalized to mock (PBS)-inoculated mice (either wild-type or knockout mice). Normalized fold change was calculated using the threshold cycle (⌬⌬ CT ) method as has been previously described (11) . ELISA. Levels of IFN-␤ were quantified using a VeriKine mouse IFN-␤ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (RD Systems) according to manufacturer protocols. The lower left lobe of lungs from TRIF Ϫ/Ϫ or C57BL/6J mice from the mock-inoculated or SARS-CoVinfected group (n ϭ 4 each group) was homogenized in 1 ml of PBS using a Magna Lyzer instrument (Roche). One hundred microliters of cleared homogenate was used for the ELISA assay sample. A seven-point standard curve was prepared using the manufacturer's protocol, and interferon titers in the samples were determined by plotting the standards using a 4-parameter fit. Optical densities were read at an absorbance of 450 nm. Differentially expressed gene identification. Differentially expressed gene targets were selected from data collected in a previously described study performed with transcriptomics data banked at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (accession no. gse33266) (38) . Briefly, that study was performed using microarray analysis of RNA from lungs of 20-week-old female C57BL/6J mice infected with doses of 10 2 , 10 3 , 10 4 , or 10 5 PFU of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV to identify genes that were differentially expressed compared to those of mock (PBS)-inoculated mice. A linear fit model was used to determine differential expression (DE) for each transcript, requiring an absolute log 2 (fold change) value of Ͼ1.5 as well as an adjusted false-discovery-rate (FDR) P value of Ͻ0.05. In a separate study, TLR3 Ϫ/Ϫ lung homogenates in TRIzol were analyzed by microarray, and the full data set has been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and is available at GEO accession number GSE68820.
