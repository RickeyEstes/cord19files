Other inference methods involve iterations in all of the model's parameters (p t i ) and (d i j )the latter is generally known as ''blind deconvolution'' in the optics literature [19] . The advantage of those methods over Method 1 is that they allow to update the symptom profile distributions from the initial, data-derived estimate (d d i j ) by increasing the likelihood of all observations (Q t j ,O i j ). However given the lack of identifiability of the parameters using observations (Q t i ) alone as specified by equation (1), iterations in the symptom profile distribution parameters might move them further away from their true value and worsen the incidence curve estimates if the counts (N i ) are too small. Several inference methods involving EM iterations in all the parameters are possible, such as starting from an estimate in Method 1 and using both equations (4) and (5) for subsequent iterations. We have found that the classical EM scheme is fairly robust for sufficiently large data sets: Iterate all the parameters simultaneously using both equations (4) and (5) in each step until convergence. An initial condition used in this paper corresponded to expected weekly incidence 1 for each infection in the survey sample (Q t: p t i (0)~1).
