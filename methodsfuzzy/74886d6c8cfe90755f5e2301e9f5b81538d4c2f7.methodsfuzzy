Samples. The LRP optimization was directly conducted with serum samples collected in 2001 from two patients infected with HCV genotype 1a, referred to as JLR3037 and RJ, respectively. A large volume of serum stored at À70°C was available from these two patients, which allowed repeated and detailed optimization of our LRP protocol. After the optimization, additional serum samples were used for the estimation of sensitivity, robustness, and potential recombination (see below). HCV RNA levels were quantitated by bDNA assay (Bayer VERSANT HCV 3.0) immediately prior to the start of this study. RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from serum by using either QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the instructions provided. With QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, RNA was extracted from 280 ll of serum and finally eluted into 60 ll of Tris buffer containing 20 U/ml of RNasein Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI). In the extraction with TRIzol LS reagent, 250 ll of serum was applied and the RNA pellet was finally dissolved in 20 ll of nuclease-free water containing 20 U/ml of RNasein Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega). Additionally either glycogen (Invitrogen) or transfer RNA (tRNA) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used for facilitating RNA precipitation. For both methods, vigorous vortexing was avoided to prevent shearing of long RNA templates [7] . Reverse transcription. Since RT is a critical step for successful LRP, we optimized this step as follows. First, we tested multiple RT enzymes alone or in combination, including AMV (Promega), M-MLV (Promega), Expand Reverse Transcriptase (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase (Roche Applied Science), SuperScript II (Invitrogen), SuperScript III (Invitrogen), and rTth DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) that shows reverse transcriptase activity in the presence of MnCl 2 at elevated temperatures. In some experiments, we mixed a RT enzyme with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), a similar strategy as used in long PCR, to improve full-length cDNA synthesis [8] . Second, previous studies showed certain chemicals might improve full-length cDNA synthesis in both quantity and quality. In this study, we tried different additives at various concentrations, including DMSO (5-10%) (Sigma), GC-Melt (0.5 M) (BD Biosciences), DTT (5-10 mM), trehalose (0.6 M) (Sigma) [9] , and betaine (2 M) (Sigma) [9] . Third, we designed a series of HCVspecific RT primers located at the 3 0 end of NS5B (Table 1 ). These primers were tested for efficient priming at different concentrations. Fourth, besides direct application of RT reaction in subsequent PCR, we also tried to purify RT reaction with or without RNase H digestion [11] prior to PCR, by using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit or QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen) or Dynabeads KilobaseBIND-ER Kit (Dynal) in which RT primers were biotinylated at their 5 0 ends. Finally, we also investigated the role of 7-deaza-2 0 -deoxyguanosine (Sigma) in the RT reaction that may improve the elongation in GC-rich domains [10] . PCR. All PCR experiments were done with DNA Thermal Cycler 480 (Perkin-Elmer-Cetus, Norwalk, CT). The nested PCR strategy and a touchdown protocol were generally applied. At the beginning, we tested several thermostable DNA polymerases for long PCR, such as Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Applied Science) and Elongase Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen). We eventually focused on rTth DNA polymerase, XL (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and most of the optimization experiments were done with this enzyme. The strategy to optimize long PCR was basically similar to what we described for RT step. Multiple additives were first tested, including DMSO, betaine [12, 13] , and tetramethylammonium (TMA) oxalate [14] . Next, a series of primers were tested for their efficiency with long PCR (Table 1) . Meantime, since one of the mixed polymerases has 3 0 -5 0 exonuclease ''proofreading'' activity that may degrade primers, we tested phosphorothioate primers to see if the PCR amplification is improved [15] [16] [17] . To allow hot-start PCR that may diminish non-specific priming, we adopted two measures, the use of loop incorporated primers [18] and an oligonucleotide, Trnc-21, which specially inhibits DNA polymerase isolated from Thermus thermophilus (Tth pol) at low temperature [19, 20] . Finally, with the DNA Thermal Cycler 480, we empirically fixed denaturing temperature at 94°C for 30 s, elongation temperature at 72°C or 68°C for 9 min, and annealing step for 30 s. However, the annealing temperature was adjusted depending on the T m values of the primers (Table 1) . Molecular cloning of HCV envelope domain. HCV displays a typical quasispecies nature shared by most RNA viruses. To understand if our LRP protocol conserves viral diversity, we compared the HCV quasispecies profiles derived from regular RT-PCR and LRP products in two patient samples, LIV19 and LIV23. The viral heterogeneity has been detailed in these two patients in our previous study based on a 1.38 kb amplicon spanning the most hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of HCV genome [21] . In brief, serum RNA was reverse transcribed with 200 U M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega), followed by nested PCR with Taq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). The PCR product was gel purified by using QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and ligated into the pTOPO-TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). Escherichia coli TOP-10 cells (Invitrogen) were used for transformation and recovery of recombinant clones. Approximately 15 clones for each sample were sequenced with ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit using an ABI 373A automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Molecular cloning of long RT-PCR product. For cloning the LRP product, we first tried several commercial cloning kits, including TOPO XL PCR Cloning Kit (Invitrogen), Copylight Cloning Kit, and Clone Smart Blunt Cloning Kit (Lucigen Corporation, Middleton, WI), without success. Next, we estimated cloning efficiency of Gateway Technology with Clonase II (Invitrogen). Finally, we returned to a conventional cloning strategy in which the LRP product was digested with two restriction enzymes PacI and FseI, followed by ligation into a special plasmid named pClone. The ligation product was electroporated into Stbl4 cells or DH10B cells (Invitrogen). The pClone vector was constructed by replacing PacI-BamHI fragment of pAdTrack-CMV [22] with a $120 bp fragment that was assembled to include rare restriction enzymes not found in the HCV genome based on an analysis of 13 fulllength HCV genotype 1a isolates. Positive recombinant clones were identified by either the digestion or partial sequencing of both ends of the insert. Estimation of PCR-mediated recombination. PCR may induce a homologous recombination [23] [24] [25] . The rate of recombination is dependent on the protocol used. After the optimization of our long RT-PCR, we estimated the potential recombination related to this protocol. In doing so, sera from samples LIV19 and LIV23 were mixed in equal amounts, followed by the same procedures of RNA extraction, RT, long PCR, and cloning. Approximately 20 positive recombinant clones were sequenced at 8 domains located within 5 0 UTR, Core, E1, E2, NS2, NS3, NS5a, and NS5b regions, respectively. Recombination would be indicated for a given clone if conflicting clusterings were noted in phylogenetic trees constructed with 1 of the 8 domains that we sequenced. Genetic analysis. All sequences were aligned with Clustal W (version 1.74) [26] . Sequence editing and multiple sequence comparisons were performed with matched programs in the Wisconsin GCG package (Oxford Molecular Group, Inc., version 10.0). The mean genetic distance (d), the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS), and the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (dN) were calculated with the Kimura 2-parameter method (all sites) [27] in the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software package (MEGA, version 3.0) [28] . All phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method [29] with a bootstrap test implanted in MEGA. The genetic complexity at both nucleotide and amino acid levels was evaluated, respectively, for samples LIV19 and LIV23 by calculating normalized entropy (S n ): S n = S/lnN, where N is the total number of clones; S = À P i(pi ln pi), where pi is the frequency of each clone in the viral quasispecies population. Statistical tests. Student's t-test was used to analyze differences between mean values for genetic parameters when data were normally distributed. Non-parametric tests were used to evaluate samples for which normal distributions were not present.
