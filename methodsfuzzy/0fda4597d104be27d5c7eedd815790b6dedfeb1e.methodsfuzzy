Pairs of experimental tests were done under identical conditions except that for one test the two UV fixtures were turned on for 15 min whereas for the other test they were turned off prior to introduction of airborne bacteria into the test chamber. For both tests, the ceiling fan was operating at the same speed and direction and the air exchange rate was maintained at 6 h À1 . In order to evaluate experimental error, all test pairs were replicated three or four times. The test bioaerosol generated by the Collison nebulizer located in the biological safety cabinet was discharged directly into a 1.0-in. (25 mm) diameter stainless steel (SS) tube that extended from the biological safety cabinet through the chamber wall to the center of the chamber. The aerosol was discharged at a height of 5 ft (1.5 m) above the floor through a hollow, 3-in. (76 mm) diameter, SS sphere having 25 equally spaced 1/8 in. (3.2 mm) diameter holes. If the air in the chamber was well mixed, then after 40 min of supplying aerosol and outdoor air at 6 h À1 , the bacteria concentration would be expected to be greater than 98% of its steady-state value. Thus, we assumed that after 40 min steady-state conditions had essentially been established and sampling was begun. The sampling point was directly in front of the midpoint of the exhaust air grille. Samples were withdrawn at the rate of 28.3 L/min through a 1.0-in. (25 mm) diameter SS tube leading back to the biological safety cabinet in the control room. Depending on expected concentrations, the samples were collected for various sampling times using a single-stage Andersen biological impactor (Thermo Electron, Smyrna, Ga.) onto tryptic soy agar contained in petri dishes. Samples were taken in triplicate. Petri dishes were incubated at 37 C, and colonies were counted the next morning for B. atrophaeus spores and after four days for M. parafortuitum. Colony counts were adjusted to account for the likelihood that more than one organism had passed through the same hole [20] . The test bioaerosol generated by a Collison nebulizer along with room air that had been dried and HEPA filtered flowed through the mixing zone and then through the exposure zone. Downstream of the chamber, 12.5 L/min of irradiated aerosol flowed through each of two liquid impingers (SKC Biosamplers, SKC, Inc., Eighty Four, PA) connected in parallel. Each impinger contained 20 mL of PBS solution. Air leaving the impingers passed through a single HEPA filter prior to entering a pump, which maintained an airflow rate of 25 L/ min through the system. Pairs of two-minute samples were collected in the impingers. For one sample, bacteria were exposed to UVGI, whereas the other sample was prevented from receiving UV exposure by covering the quartz window. Between samples, the aerosol bypassed the impingers and flowed at 25 L/min directly to the HEPA filter before being exhausted. The impingers were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water between samples. After sampling for M. parafortuitum, 50 mL of the contents of one of the impingers was mixed with 50 mL of PBS solution. This mixture was plated in triplicate on tryptic soy agar, whereas for B. atrophaeus spores, 100 mL of the undiluted contents of one impinger was plated in triplicate onto tryptic soy agar. After incubation at 37 C, the colonies were counted and the concentrations in CFU/m 3 were calculated. The inactivation of both M. parafortuitum and B. atrophaeus spores due to UVGI was assumed to follow the equation for exponential decay [22, 23] : where C UV and C noUV are concentrations of bacteria when they are exposed and not exposed to UVGI, respectively, all else being the same. When the logarithms of experimental values of C UV /C noUV are plotted against dose, a straight line should be obtained. The slope of this straight line is equal to z, the UV susceptibility of the bacteria.
