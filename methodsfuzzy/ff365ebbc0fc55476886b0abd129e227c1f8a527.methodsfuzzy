Literature search and data extraction. We conducted an electronic search to identify relevant articles that reported original research findings including blood ion concentrations in patients with total hip arthroplasty (tHA) or hip resurfacing (HR). meDlINe (between January 1946 and 15th February 2015) and emBASe (between January 1974 and February 2015) were searched for relevant publications with the assistance of a clinical librarian. the electronic search was individually tailored to each database to maximise sensitivity (see Appendix 1). We supplemented the electronic search by obtaining referenced articles and articles citing articles were each of the articles ultimately included in the meta-analysis through Scopus. two readers (a fellowship-trained joint reconstruction surgeon and orthopaedic surgery resident) independently reviewed all articles using explicit criteria, and recorded assessments using a standard computerised form. A third reader (a fellowship-trained joint reconstruction surgeon) resolved any disagreements. Readers screened titles and abstracts to exclude animal and basic science studies, review articles, guidelines, and editorials. the readers identified articles evaluating a hip prosthesis (either HR or tHA) and reporting cobalt and/or chromium blood ion concentrations from the full text. We included articles in the meta-analysis if it was possible to reconstruct a 2 Ã— 2 table for the use of blood ion measurements as a test for ARmDs. only studies that evaluated metal ion levels for screening or for diagnosis of symptomatic patients were eligible. Studies that only recruited patients who underwent revision surgery were excluded (three studies, 81 hips). In these papers, the decision making for revision was not clearly described. Consequently we felt that there was a high risk of bias from the spectrum effect as ion levels were likely used in the decision-making process. 27 eligible measures of diagnostic performance included: sensitivity; specificity; predictive values; likelihood ratios; diagnostic odds ratios; and receiver operating characteristic (RoC) curves. If an odds ratio for an ion cut-point used as a covariate in logistic regression was reported, we deemed the study eligible. Reviewers collected the following covariates: country of study; inclusion criteria; benchmark test; index test; number of patients; ARmD prevalence; number of revisions; and prevalence of symptomatic patients. Reviewers also assessed the quality of studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. 28 Statistical analysis. We selected the diagnostic performance meta-analytic technique according to the algorithm proposed by Chappell, Raab and Wardlaw. 29 Ultimately, we computed a summary receiver operating characteristic (SRoC) curve using a random-effects hierarchical SRoC (HSRoC) model controlling for the different cut-points reported (see Appendix 2) . 30, 31 We quantified heterogeneity by comparing the widths of 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and 95% prediction intervals (pIs). 32 implementation. We performed Bayesian computation for both the diagnostic performance and normative ion level meta-analyses using R (R Foundation, vienna, Austria) and the Bayesian modeling language, Stan. 33 We ran four chains for 5000 iterations, discarded the Flow of studies through selection process. first 2500 and used a thinning interval of five iterations. We assessed appropriate sampling of chains graphically by ensuring mixing on trace plots, and convergence by ensuring the Gelman-Rubin statistic was < 1.2. 34, 35 We used non-informative prior distributions.
