A population frame of 499 PSMCs which were members in 2005 of the World Federation of Culture Collections (WFCC) or the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation Microbial Resources Network (MIRCEN) was used to conduct a world-wide survey on a sample of PSMCs. Further details of the method are presented in the electronic supplement. A total of 155 collections responded to the main questionnaire from which a final sample size of 103 observations with complete data were used in the analysis (the electronic supplement provides further details on the materials and methods used). We simultaneously assess (1) the role played by public funding in the strategy of PSMCs regarding their supply of TS (conservation focus of publicly available micro-organisms used both in public sector and private sector research) as well as (2) A second sub model (Eq. (2)) to test if such hybrid organisational model also is correlated with a stronger industry orientation of the PSMCs.
