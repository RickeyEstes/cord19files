Mice. Male and female wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 (CD45.2), myd88 Ϫ/Ϫ , clec9a Ϫ/Ϫ , and tlr2 Ϫ/Ϫ mice (originally purchased from Jackson Laboratories) were bred and maintained at the Montana State University (MSU; Bozeman, MT) Animal Resources Center under pathogen-free conditions and were a kind gift from Mark Jutila (myd88 Ϫ/Ϫ and tlr2 Ϫ/Ϫ mice). All mice used in this study were between 7 and Early Antiviral Immune Response Requires TLR2 ® 8 weeks of age unless specifically indicated. Mice were weighed and monitored for signs of morbidity and mortality. All care and procedures were in accordance with the recommendations of the NIH, the USDA, and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (61) . Animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the MSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). MSU is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC; accreditation no. 713). P22 and TMV capsid constructs. The construction of the P22 capsid expression vector has been previously described (62) . For the construction of TMV mutants (D77N and E50Q), the TMV coat protein was purchased as an Escherichia coli codon-optimized gene from GenScript Inc. and cloned in a pRSFDuet vector for expression. Mutations (D77N and E50Q) were introduced through site-directed mutagenesis with the following primers (Eurofins MWG Operon and Integrated DNA Technologies) to create a capsid that does not allow RNA inclusion: TMV-CP D77N FP, CCGGATAGCGACTTCAAAGTTTATCGCTACAATGCC GTTCTGAACCCGCTGG; TMV-CP E50Q, AAAACGCACGGTGACCTGCGGAGACGGTTTCCAGACTTGGCTGAATT GGCGC. P22 and TMV capsid purification. All constructs were transformed into ClearColi (Lucigen), a nonimmunostimulatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-generating E. coli cell line, via electroporation. Transformed E. coli strains were grown on LB medium at 37°C in the presence of ampicillin or kanamycin. Expression of the genes was induced once the culture reached mid-log phase (optical density at 600 nm [OD 600 ] of 0.6) by addition of isopropyl-␤-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Cultures were grown for 4 h after addition of IPTG, and then the cells were harvested by centrifugation and cell pellets were stored at Ϫ20°C overnight. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, 125 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4) with lysozyme and RNase added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The cell suspension was lysed by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ϫ g for 45 min at 4°C. P22 or TMV particles were purified from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation through a 35% (wt/vol) sucrose cushion. The resulting viral pellets were resuspended in PBS (10 mM sodium phosphate, 175 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4) and then purified over an S-500 Sephadex size exclusion column using a Bio-Rad Biologic DuoFlow fast protein liquid chromatograph (FPLC). The flow rate for size exclusion chromatography (SEC) purification was 1 ml/min. P22 samples were diluted to~1.5 mg/ml and heated at 67°C for 25 min to expand the capsids, which removed scaffold protein and nucleic acid contaminants from the sample, and were recovered by ultracentrifugation. Samples were assessed by SDS-PAGE, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and SEC-multiangle laser light scattering (MALS) for particle assembly and purity and by nanodrop and acrylamide gel electrophoresis for nucleic acid absence. All columns and containers were endotoxin free. P22 CP subunit purification. Unassembled P22 coat protein (CP) subunits were generated by combining 2-mg/ml samples of expanded P22 1:1 with 6 M guanidine HCl in PBS and incubating them at room temperature for 1 h. Samples were dialyzed against PBS overnight at 4°C and used within 24 h of recovery. Complete disassembly was confirmed by SEC-MALS. mFn and PfFn. pET30A plasmids harboring either the murine ferritin (mFn) or P. furiosus ferritin (PfFn) were transformed into ClearColi via electroporation (63) . Expression of the genes was induced in 1-liter LB cultures by addition of isopropyl-␤-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.3 mM once the cells reached mid-log phase (OD 600 of 0.6). Cultures were grown for 16 h after addition of IPTG, and then the cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,000 rpm at 4°C) and cell pellets were stored at Ϫ80°C overnight. Cell pellets were resuspended in Dulbecco's PBS (10 mM sodium phosphate, 138 mM sodium chloride, 2.7 mM potassium chloride, pH 7.4) with lysozyme, DNase, and RNase added and were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The cell suspension was lysed by sonication. Cellular components were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ϫ g for 45 min at 4°C. Postlysis supernatant was then heated to 60°C for mFn and 80°C for PyFn in a hot water bath for 10 min to precipitate E. coli proteins. Aggregated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ϫ g for 20 min at 4°C. The remaining supernatant was dialyzed into PBS (50 mM sodium phosphate, 1 M sodium chloride, pH 7.4) overnight to facilitate additional removal of nucleic acids. The supernatant was then concentrated by spin filtration and loaded onto a Superose 6 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) size exclusion column using a Bio-Rad Biologic DuoFlow FPLC. Fractions were checked by SDS-PAGE, and those containing ferritin were pooled and dialyzed into PBS (20 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4) overnight. To further remove impurities, ferritin fractions were loaded onto a Fast Q Sepharose ion exchange column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), and ferritin was eluted with a sodium chloride gradient (PBS [20 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4] to PBS [20 mM sodium phosphate, 1 M sodium chloride, pH 7.4]). Fractions were again checked by SDS-PAGE, and those containing pure ferritin were pooled. Combined fractions were then dialyzed into Dulbecco's PBS overnight and stored at 4°C. All columns and containers were endotoxin free. SDS-PAGE. Protein samples were mixed with 4ϫ loading buffer containing 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), boiled for 10 min, and separated on a 15% acrylamide gel (35 mA) for 1 h. Gels were stained with Coomassie blue stain. Images were recorded on a UVP MultDoc-IT digital imaging system. A 10-to 180-kDa PageRuler prestained ladder was used for reference. Transmission electron microscopy. Samples (5 l, 0.1-mg/ml total protein) were applied to carbon-coated grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences), incubated for 30 s, and washed with distilled water. Grids were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 20 s. Images were taken on a JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV to determine particle assembly and purity (17) . Inoculations and challenge. Nonsurgical intratracheal (i.t.) inoculations were performed as described previously (9) . For capsid inoculations, mice were dosed with 100 l i.t. of sterile PBS (mock), 100 g of capsid (P22, TMV, murine/Pyrococcus ferritin), or P22 dimer on three consecutive days (0, 1, and 2). For virus inoculations, mice were inoculated with 100 l of PBS or 0.1 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ;
