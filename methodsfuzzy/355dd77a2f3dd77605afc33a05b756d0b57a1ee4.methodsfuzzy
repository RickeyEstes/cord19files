The molecular docking analysis was carried out using FlexX molecular docking module [52, 53] (FlexX 1.13.5) available in the SYBYL 7.1 software package from Tripose [54].This docking approach adopts an incremental construction algorithm for identifying appropriate pose of the substrate in the active site of the enzyme. It generates about 30 possible poses of the substrate in the active site. Most of the 30 poses obtained in this analysis adopted similar binding mode in the enzyme cavity and hence the top scoring pose was considered in this analysis. To perform the above analysis, the crystal structure 1J3I (Wild-type Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (PfDHFR-TS) complexed with WR99210, NADPH, and dUMP) was downloaded from the protein data bank [55] (PDB) and subjected to protein preparation and receptor description [56] . The structures of the substrates were prepared by first building the molecules in 3D and optimizing the structures using tripos force field. The ionic, tautomeric states of substrates were considered while performing molecular docking analysis. The pose shown in Fig. 7 includes the neutral state of the substrate in the active site of the enzyme.
