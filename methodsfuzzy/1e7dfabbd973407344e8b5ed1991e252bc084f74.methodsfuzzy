Globally, there are laboratories established to address bioterrorism. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there should be a laboratory response network which should include clinical microbiology laboratories that are responsible for identifying, detecting, and reporting bioterrorism. In addition, they must suggest the measures that can be adopted to remedy the effects. Moreover, the laboratory response network can be grouped category wise, dealing with the issue, like a category A laboratory can be a primary laboratory that can help detect such agents which can likely cause bioterrorism effects and so they should be equipped to conduct primary analysis. The B category laboratories can help to isolate and identify the exact agent responsible for bioterrorism and work for its remedial measures and design such strategies. Similarly, the category C laboratories should work to identify those agents that can cause potential damage as a bioterrorism agent in future; they all must act as public health laboratories. Mostly, microbiologists are capable enough to work out the effects and remedies for bioterrorism and the population suffering or at risk to suffer from its impacts. However, toxicologists also have a significant role to offer in this regard, as they are the ones who can identify the toxins from food, air, water, and even soil sources that can have an impact on the entire population and pose a risk to the overall public health (Lim et al., 2005) . Usually, blood samples are taken from humans and animals for the identification of the cause, while water, crop, soil, and air sampling is also performed to identify the source. Ideal sampling techniques have been recommended by CDC which should be adopted globally as a standard procedure. Some common globally used laboratory techniques to detect bioterrorism agents include centrifugation, filtration for the separation of microorganism on cellular level, dielectrophoresis, immune-magnetic separation; and mostly polymerase chain reaction is also utilized by laboratory experts to identify biowarfare agents that can have impacts on genes and at molecular level (Bravata et al., 2004 ).  Before the laboratory work begins, there is a surveillance system that includes collection of data either through observation or surveys and later reporting it to the laboratories. The data should be collected from local clinics and hospital reports because bioterrorism is a public health issue, so a nation-wide surveillance system should be devised to monitor and manage the issue. This kind of surveillance system is also termed as conventional or traditional surveillance; however, modern surveillance system has also been adopted by many countries in the world to counter bioterrorism which include nation-wide automated surveillance for disease-related syndromes, analysis of routinely collected clinical, administrative, pharmacy, and laboratory data. Another important thing that should be considered for surveillance is the cost, social barriers, and environmental ethics. So, it does not matter which surveillance type is adopted as it depends upon the country's environmental, economic, and social conditions. Furthermore, there has to be a system of proper management and chain of command which should be supervised and regulated under the government as it is a concern for entire population. A regulatory body should be established to further remove the bias that can be questioned later (Hutwanger et al., 2003) . However, problems can still exist because it is not easy to identify the culprit who release or transmit agents because the recipes to spread such kind of terror are easily available and accessible through the Internet. Also, the environment ethics is the subject being ignored the most specifically by the scientists who are engaged in performing experiments on viruses and bacteria, genetic modifications, etc. and is becoming a reason for the wide spread of bioterrorism in the world (Fig. 7 .1).
