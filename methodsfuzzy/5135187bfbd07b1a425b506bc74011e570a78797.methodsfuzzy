Medical anthropologists engage in ethnographic research, the hallmarks of which include the study of behavior, thought, and speech in context; participant observation; in-depth interviews with multiple stakeholders occupying different positions of power in social formations; life histories and case studies; and historical and archival analysis. They employ many qualitative assessment tools including surveys, sorting exercises, and focus groups, as well as standardized instruments, which generate biological, biometric, psychometric, and epidemiological data as relevant to research questions at hand. They build on contributions from scholars outside anthropology, and are often involved in research partnerships with related disciplines such as public health, medical sociology, economics, geography, ecology, and the health sciences. They are also invested in involving populations in participatory research through the use of such visual and spatial technologies as participatory mapping and photo-voice. Medical anthropologists also deem it essential to 'study up' and conduct systems level analysis of health care systems, health and development bureaucracies and philanthropies, non governmental organizations (NGOs), private-public partnerships, and environmental legislation that affects health outcomes. For example, medical anthropologists study the policies, politics, and bureaucracies responsible for the regulation of water and sanitation, forestry, food safety, etc., as they relate to health outcomes. They also study the activities and linkages between local and global NGOs devoted to environment and health oversight as well as the ways in which NGO hiring practices impact on government health infrastructure. Global policies related to the control of environmental pollutants ranging from pesticides to tobacco smoke, and the accessibility and regulation of pharmaceutical products, also fall under the purview of medical anthropology. In keeping with an important shift in analytical focus from 'international health' to 'global health,' medical anthropologists have become increasingly interested in health diplomacy and what it takes to introduce and enforce global policies across national boundaries for global good. Much of the driving force behind global health is the recognition that emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or influenza (both swine and avian) move quickly and require well-coordinated global disease control policies that demand the surveillance of local environments and the interface between animal and human ecosystems. Medical anthropologists are involved with both documenting examples of local-global disease linkages and representations of such linkages by the popular press and political parties, as well as the response of citizens and activists.
