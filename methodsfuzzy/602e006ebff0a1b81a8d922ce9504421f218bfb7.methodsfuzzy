Each study was then given an overall quality score represented by the quintile range of the percentage of applicable Fink criteria answered in the affirmative. If the study satisfied 80-100% of applicable Fink criteria, it received a quality score of 5, satisfying between 60 and 79% resulting in a score of 4, those between 40 and 59% received a score of 3, those between 20 and 39% received a score of 2, and those between 0 and 19% received a score of 1. A score of 1-2 was considered fair; scores between 3 and 4 were deemed moderate; and a score of 5
