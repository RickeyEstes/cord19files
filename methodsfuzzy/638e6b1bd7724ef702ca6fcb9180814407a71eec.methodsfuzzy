Each specimen was read out in -10-15 min. Both grids prepared from each specimen were examined. One routinely began with grid No. 1, which had a thinner film of stool than grid No. 2. Coronaviruses and coronavirus-like particles (CVLPs) were most easily seen with this preparation. The thicker stool film of grid No. 2 tended to obscure the delicate filaments that make up the fringe of the CVLPs. Each grid was viewed initially through the attached × 10 ocular system at a scope magnification of x 10,000. The CVLPs were identified as fringed membranous profiles that are flexible and tend to collapse onto the grid surface, exclude the negative stain, and contain a somewhat electron-dense "nucleoid" in the interior of the particle (see Results section for details of morphology). The viruses that have distinctive geometric shapes were recognized initially at a magnification of x 10,000 by the presence of a ring of electron-dense stain that surrounds the individual particles making them stand out against a background of debris. Suspicious particles were then examined at × 60,000 and the size was estimated from a calibrated millimeter scale that is drawn on the fluorescent screen of the microscope. The small (-20 nm) featureless particles were only scored as present if aggregates of the same-sized particles were present or if defective particles could be identified. Defective particles have no nucleic acid and become penetrated by stain revealing the geometric shape of the capsid. Photographs were taken at × 60,000 for exact measurements of viral size and for comparison purposes. The proportionate occurrence of each of the four morphologically distinct groups (rotavirus, adenovirus, small round virus, and CVLPs) was compared with the expected occurrence if month was an independent factor using the X 2 test. The correlation of viral occurrence with each of the climatologic conditions using monthly data was analyzed using the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient.
