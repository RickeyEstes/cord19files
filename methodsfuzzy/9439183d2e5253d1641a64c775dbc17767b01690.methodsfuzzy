Ethics Statement. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. The institutional review board of Tianjin Haihe Hospital provided written approval and judged that all methods in the study met relevant ethical guidelines and regulations (ethical # 2013HHKT-01). Subjects. Thirty-one SARS survivors of the 2002-2003 outbreak, as well as 31 age-matched, consenting healthy volunteers who were medical staff at the Tianjin Haihe Hospital, were recruited in 2014. General participant information, including age, disease duration, and medication, was collected using a standard form. Student's t-test (two-tailed) was used to evaluate the differences between the two groups. Furthermore, each participant completed a symptom questionnaire regarding his or her medical history since SARS infection. After fasting overnight, serum and urine samples were collected in the morning from all patients for routine clinical measurements and metabolomics analysis. For further lipid metabolism investigation, serum samples were also collected from 46 non-SARS patients with severe pneumonia, half of these patients were treated with methylprednisolone. Clinical measurements. Evaluation of the general physical ability of the patients included quality of life scoring (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36, SF-36), Harris Hip score, the six-min walk test, assessment of pulmonary ventilation function, and the bronchial dilation test. Routine clinical chemical analyses were conducted using fasting blood samples at the Tianjin Haihe Hospital. LC-MS-based serum metabolic profiling. Serum samples were prepared as described before 29 . Briefly, protein precipitation was performed on the serum samples. Aliquots of 200 μL were drawn for each sample, and four volumes of acetonitrile (with internal standard mixture of carnitine C2:0-d3, carnitine C10:0-d3, carnitine C16:0-d3, LPC 19:0, free fatty acid (FFA) 16:0-d3, FFA 18:0-d3, chenodeoxycholic acid-d4, cholic acid-d4, leu-d3, Val-d8, tryptophan-d5, phenylalanine-d5 and leucine-enkephalin) were added. After thorough vortex and centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), two aliquots of 300 μL supernatant were pipetted for drying in CentriVap Centrifugal Vacuum Concentrators (Labconco, MO). The dried residues were stored at −80 °C until analysis. LC-MS-based metabolic profiling was performed on an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatograph (Waters, USA) coupled to a tripleTOF ™ 5600 plus mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) equipped with an electrospray source. The dried serum samples were dissolved in acetonitrile (ACN)/water (1:4 v/v) and, following centrifugation at 4 °C, 5 μL supernatant was loaded. For the positive mode, a BEH C8 (100 mm × 2.1 mm × 1.7 μm; Waters, Milford, MA) column was used. The gradient was initiated with 10% B mobile phase (0.1% formic acid in ACN), which was maintained for 1 min, followed by linearly increasing to 40% B within 4 min, and then to 100% B at 17 min, which was maintained for 5 min. The mobile phase was rapidly changed to 90% A (0.1% formic acid) within 0.1 min, and the total run time for each injection was 25 min, including a post-equilibration of 2.9 min. Table 3 .

SCIeNTIfIC REPORTS | 7: 9110 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-09536-z GC-MS-based serum metabolic profiling. The derivatization procedure and data acquisition were performed as described previously, with some modifications 29 . Briefly, the temperature for both oximation and silylation reactions was changed to 37 °C and the oximation reaction time was reduced to 1.5 h. Serum metabolic profiling was performed in a pseudotargeted mode using a GCMS-QP 2010 Plus quadrupole mass analyzer coupled to an AOC-20i autosampler (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Chromatographic separation was performed on a DB-5 MS capillary column (30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm; J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA). First, the quality control (QC) sample was analyzed in full scan mode with a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) scan range of 33-600 Dalton to obtain the target ion for selected ion monitoring (SIM) scanning. The parameters for the full scan were as follows: the flow rate of the carrier gas (helium) was constant at 1.2 mL/min; the oven temperature began at 70 °C, which was maintained for 3 min, followed by a linear increase to 310 °C at 5 °C/min, and finally holding for 6 min at 310 °C; the temperature of the inlet and interface was 280 °C, and that of the ion source was 240 °C; the detector voltage was set at 1.05 kV; the solvent delay was 5.1 min; and the event time was initiated at 0.5 s. With the integrated SIM scan table, batch analysis for all samples was conducted in pseudotargeted mode with all MS parameter settings the same as those used in full scan mode, but with the event time adjusted to 0. For the LC-MS analysis, raw data were first imported to Peak-view software for automated peak detection, alignment, and integration. After checking the derived peak table, known metabolites that had been missed or had a relative standard deviation of greater than 30% during the automated peak picking were extracted and integrated manually. Further unknown ions detected in blank samples were deleted if their intensity proportion in the blank sample was more than 1% compared with the average intensity levels in the experimental samples. The 80% rule was applied to remove peaks with missing values surpassing 20% in both groups. For mass spectrometry response normalization in both GC-MS and LC-MS analyses, the raw peak areas for each ion or metabolite were normalized to that of adjacent QCs, with the local linear regression of QC intensities selected. For the lipidomics analysis, peak picking was performed using Lipid-View software (AB Sciex). Owing to their complexity, the lipid compounds were detected by extracting the ion chromatograms to avoid the "black box" associated with automatically pretreated data. Adjustment of the integration parameters was performed in certain cases. The peak areas of each detected lipid compound were normalized to those of the spiked lipid internal standards according to the different lipid classes.
