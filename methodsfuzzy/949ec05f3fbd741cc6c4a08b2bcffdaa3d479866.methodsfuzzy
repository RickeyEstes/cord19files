Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were purchased from Alstem (Richmond, CA, USA). Human glioblastoma cells (U87), human liver cancer cells (HEPG2), and mouse adipose tissue fibroblast cells (L929) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). All cells were maintained in high-glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin. At ~80%-90% confluence, cells were treated with 0.25% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid for dissociation and passed at a ratio of 1:4. Human iPS cells (iPS11 and iPS15) were purchased from Alstem. These lines have been preadapted to feeder-free conditions and maintained in serum-free mTeSR1 medium (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin. All cells were incubated at 37Â°C in 5% CO 2 .
