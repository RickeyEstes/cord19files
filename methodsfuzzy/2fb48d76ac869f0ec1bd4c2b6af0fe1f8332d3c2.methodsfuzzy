Construction of pET28a-3CLsm and pET28a-3CLsc. The gene of SARS 3C-like protease was a gift from Dr. Li and was amplified by PCR using primers 3CLsm and 3CLr (see Table 1 for the sequences of primers). The PCR product was digested with NcoI and XhoI, and inserted into NcoI/XhoI cut plasmid pET-28a. The plasmid, pET28a-3CLsm, encodes a 34.7 kDa (3CLsm) protein flanked at a C-terminal His 6 -tag and with the first amino acid Ser replaced by Met. The PCR product of a mutant using primers 3CLsc and 3CLr was digested with NheI and XhoI, and inserted into NheI/XhoI cut plasmid pET-28a. The resulting plasmid, pET28a-3CLsc, encodes a protein (3CLsc) containing a 31-mer peptide (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMAS SITSAVLQ; N 31 -tag) flanked at N-terminal and a C-terminal His 6 -tag. An auto-cleavage site was located between N 31 -tag and the N-terminal of the protein. This 31-mer sequence was also introduced to four mutants using the identical method as pET28a-3CLsc. Expression and purification. pET28a-3CLsm and pET28a-3CLsc were transformed, respectively, into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. The transformed cells were grown in 1 liter LB medium containing kanamycin (50 lg/ml) at 22°C until A 600 reached to 0.6-0.8 and then induced with 10 lM isopropyl-1-thio-b-D D-galactopyranoside for 6 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000g for 10 min) and suspended into 40 ml buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, and 2 mM of 2-mercaptoethanol). Lysis of the cells was achieved by ultrasonic and the suspension was centrifuged at 25,000g for 20 min. Supernatant was applied to a buffer A equilibrated cobaltnitrilotriacetic acid column (4 ml beads). The column was washed with 100 ml buffer A and then with buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole) until A 280 was less than 0.02. The target protein was eluted with 20 ml buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, and 2 mM of 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 200 mM imidazole. The recovered protein was concentrated and loaded on a gel filtration column (Sephacryl S-200HR), which was equilibrated with 250 ml buffer C. The eluted enzyme was concentrated and stored at À20°C in buffer C containing 50% glycerol. All mutants were performed in a similar way. Peptide synthesis and trans-cleavage assay. A 16-mer peptide, P439 (TSITSAVLQ fl SGFRKMA; the arrow indicates cleavage site), was synthesized by solid-phase method. The sequence was taken from the processing site of 3CL pro . The synthetic peptide was purified through a C-18 reverse-phase HPLC column and eluted with acetonitrile/water (linear gradient 0-80% containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Identity and homogeneity were confirmed by mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight, MALDI-TOF). An 11-mer peptide, P440 (TSAVLP fl SGFRK), was performed in a similar way. The cleavage assay was carried out in 40 ll buffer D (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.35, containing 400 lM P439, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA) and the reaction was initiated by adding 2 lg enzyme. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 20°C for 0-16 h and then 40 ll of 2% trifluoroacetic acid was added to stop the reaction. The products were characterized by reverse-phase HPLC using a 5-65% linear gradient of acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peaks were estimated by integrating the area and identified by mass spectroscopy. Site-directed mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by a recombination PCR method. The nucleotide sequences of primers are given in Table 1 . Mutants were also constructed into pET-28a plasmid and expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells. The homogeneities of the purified mutant proteins were characterized by SDS-PAGE. Auto-cleavage assay in vitro. Two milligrams of purified SARS-CoV 3CL protease of C 145 S mutant was incubated in 1 ml buffer D at 20°C for 0-36 h. Aliquot of 50 ll was taken out every 9 h, mixed with 50 ll of 2· SDS-loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gel.
