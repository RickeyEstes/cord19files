Honeybee colonies and sample collection. Honeybee colonies used for this study were maintained in the research apiaries of the USDA-ARS Bee Research Laboratory in Beltsville, MD. For viral particle purification and tissue dissection, fifty adult worker bees were collected by removing a central frame filled with brood and covered with adult bees from a hive and gently scraping worker bees into a 50-ml conical tube. In addition, bee pollen that was processed by bees and stored in combs around the brood was collected using a spatula and transferred into 15-ml conical tubes. Individual Varroa mites that had crawled from brood cells onto the tops of brood frames were collected with forceps and transferred into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. For assessing the effects of viruses on honeybees, the seasonal prevalence of virus infections was determined in ten colonies for a period of 1 year starting in March and finishing in February of the following year. Bee colonies were classified as strong or weak based on the size of adult populations, amount of sealed brood, and presence of food stores, as previously described (60) . Bee colonies that had more than ten frames covered with adult workers and more than six frames filled with brood and food stores were defined as strong colonies, while bee colonies that had a small number of foraging bees flying in and out, fewer than ten frames of adult bees, fewer than six combs with brood, and small patches of food stores were defined as weak colonies. For each colony, samples of 20 adult workers were collected every month and stored at Ϫ80°C until subsequent RNA isolation for virus analysis. Virus purification and electron microscopy. Thirty worker bees were frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to a fine powder, and homogenized in 10-ml extraction buffer (0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer [pH 7.5], 0.2% diethyldithiocarbamate, 1/5 volume of diethyl ether). The mixture was emulsified with 5 ml carbon tetrachloride and centrifuged at 5,000 ϫ g at 4°C for 30 min to remove tissue debris. Supernatant containing viruses was centrifuged once more at 5,000 ϫ g at 4°C for 30 min and then filtered through a 45-m filter to remove small tissue debris. The filtrate was then centrifuged at 10,187 ϫ g for 6 h at 4°C to pellet the viral particles. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 0.2 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer. A 15-l portion of viral solution was examined for the presence of virus particles in an electron microscope. The rest of the viral solution was saved for subsequent viral RNA isolation and cDNA library construction. Virus particles were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate on a Formvar-coated Ni grid and viewed in a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope at magnifications between ϫ33,000 and ϫ100,000. cDNA library construction and virus-specific primer design. Total RNA was extracted by homogenizing the viral solution with TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen), a solution of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate used for isolating total RNA from liquid samples according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resultant RNA pellets were resuspended in DNase-and RNase-free water (Invitrogen) in the presence of ribonuclease inhibitor (Invitrogen). The quantity and purity of RNA were measured with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). The cDNA library was constructed using a CloneMiner cDNA library construction kit (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's protocol. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from extracted RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase with a biotin-conjugated attB2 oligo(dT) primer. After cDNA synthesis, the products were size fractionated by column chromatography to remove excess primers, adapters, and small cDNAs and cloned into an attP-containing donor vector, pDONR 222. The BP (recombination between attB and attP sites) reaction products were transformed into ElectroMAX DH10B T1 phage-resistant cells, and the transformed cells were plated onto LB agar medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 g/ml). The positive clones were purified using the Wizard Plus miniprep DNA purification system (Promega). A total of 50 cDNA clones were randomly selected and sequence analyzed to confirm the presence of the insert. Primers specific for TRSV RNA segments 1 and 2 were designed based on the nucleotide sequences obtained from cDNA clones of this study. The sequences of primers for amplifying a 462-bp region of helicase (Hel) of RNA segment 1 were TRSV-F1 (5=-CATGAATGTTGTTATCCAAT-3=) and TRSV-R1 (5=-TCCTCAGTAAATTTCATTTG-3=). The sequences of primers for amplifying a 731-bp region of capsid protein (CP) region of RNA segment 2 were TRSV-F2 (5=-GTGTGCTGTGACGGTTGTTCC-3') and TRSV-R2 (5=-TGCCAGACCACCCAAGATTCC-3=). Figure 1 illustrates the positions of primers. Bee tissue dissection. Twenty adult worker bees were individually fixed on the wax top of a dissecting dish with steel insect pins. Under a dissecting microscope, about 10 l of hemolymph was collected from each bee with a micropipette tip by making a small hole on the roof of the bee's thorax with a needle to make it bleed. Following hemolymph collection, the legs, wings, antennae, and compound eyes were cut off with a pair of fine scissors. The body was opened by cutting along the dorsal midline from the tip of the abdomen to the head with scissors. Tissues of the brain, fat body, salivary gland, gut, muscle, nerve, trachea, and hypopharyngeal gland were individually removed using a pair of fine forceps under a dissecting microscope. In total, thirteen tissues were collected from each bee, and a total of thirty bees were dissected. The scissors and forceps were wiped between tissues once with a cotton pad soaked with 10% bleach and once with a cotton pad soaked with 70% alcohol followed by a final rinse in sterile water. To prevent possible contamination with hemolymph, all tissues were rinsed once in 1ϫ phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and twice in nuclease-free water. The washing solution was changed every time for each tissue to prevent cross-contamination. All freshly dissected tissues were subjected to subsequent RNA extraction immediately. Total RNA extraction and conventional RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from disserted tissues, adult bees, bee pollen, and Varroa mites using Invitrogen Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Conventional RT-PCR was performed on RNA samples extracted from adult bees, Varroa mites, different tissues, and bee bread collected from the same colony for the presence and distribution of TRSV. The Promega one-step Access RT-PCR system was used for virus detection as previously described (58) . PCR products were purified and sequenced to confirm the specificity of the primers. To determine the seasonal prevalence of TRSV in honeybee colonies, bee samples collected every month were subject to RT-PCR analysis individually for TRSV as well as other seven common honeybee viruses, including acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), BQCV, chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV), DWV, Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), Kashmir bee virus (KBV), and SBV. The primer pair TRSV-F2/TRSV-R2 was used for RT-PCR amplification of TRSV. The primer sets used for RT-PCR amplification of common honeybee viruses have been reported previously (49, 58) . Putative TRSV amplification products were purified and sequenced to confirm the specificity of the RT-PCR assay. The infection rate of each virus (20 workers) and strength of individual colonies were recorded every month throughout the year. Strand-specific RT-qPCR. In order to determine the ability of TRSV to replicate in different tissues of honeybees, RNA samples were further analyzed for the presence and abundance of negative-stranded RNA, a replicative intermediate, using strand-specific reverse transcription coupled with quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). For each tissue sample, the firststrand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with Tag-TRSV-F1 (5=-AGCCTGCGCA CGTGGcatgaatgttgttatccaat-3=), where the capitalized sequence corresponding to Tag was published by Yue and Genersch (61) . The synthesized cDNAs were then purified using a MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen) followed by a MinElute Reaction Clean kit (Qiagen) to remove short fragments of oligonucleotides and residue of enzymatic reagents to prevent amplification of non-strand-specific products (28) . cDNA derived from negative-stranded RNA was amplified using the Brilliant SYBR green qPCR master mix (Stratagene) with a 0.4 M concentration each of the Tag (3=-AGCCTGCGCACCGTGG-5=) and TRSV-R1 primers in a 25-l volume according to the manufacturer's protocol. To normalize the qPCR result, amplification of a housekeeping gene, the ␤-actin gene, was performed for each sample with a previously reported primer set (62) . The amplification for both TRSV and ␤-actin was carried out following the manufacturer's recommended protocol for thermal profile parameters for three-step PCR. After amplification, a melting curve analysis was performed to determine the specificity of the PCR products. Each sample was run in triplicate, and the qPCR assay was repeated twice. The amplification efficiencies of the SYBR green real-time RT-qPCR assay for both TRSV and ␤-actin were proved to be approximately equal (data not shown). The output of RT-qPCR assays for TRSV in different tissues was interpreted by using the comparative cycle threshold method (⌬⌬C T method). The average C T value (⌬C T ) of TRSV in each tissue was normalized using the C T value corresponding to the endogenous control, ␤-actin, with the following formula: ⌬C T ϭ average C T (TRSV) Ϫ average C T (␤actin). The tissue that had the lowest level of TRSV was chosen as a calibrator. The ⌬C T value of each tissue was subtracted from the ⌬C T value of the calibrator to yield ⌬⌬C T . The concentration of TRSV in each tissue was calculated using the formula 2 Ϫ⌬⌬CT and expressed as n-fold difference relative to the calibrator. In situ hybridization. Purified amplicons corresponding to the region flanked by the TRSV-F2 and TRSV-R2 primer set were incorporated into a pCR2.1 TA cloning vector upstream of a T7 promoter (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant plasmid DNAs with the TRSV insert were linearized by restriction enzyme BamHI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) at 37°C for 2 h. The linearized DNAs were extracted once with an equal volume of phenolchloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), precipitated by ethanol, and dissolved in nuclease water. The DIG-labeled RNA probe complementary to TRSV genomic RNA was synthesized using a DIG-RNA labeling kit (T7) (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) following the manufacturer's protocol. Live Varroa mites were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mM PBS (pH 7.0) overnight at 4°C, rinsed in nuclease-free water three times, and then stored in 70% ethanol (200 proof) at 4°C until used. Tissue dehydration was carried out by successive incubations in ethanol (70%, 95%, and 100%) and xylol (twice for 5 min each) and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections were cut 2 to 5 micrometers thick and mounted on poly-Llysinated slides and stored at 4°C overnight. The sections were then rehydrated through a descending concentration of ethanol (100%, 95%, and 70%), dewaxed in xylol, treated with proteinase K (10 g/ml) for 30 min, and acetylated with 0.33% (vol/vol) acetic anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.0) for 10 min prior to hybridization. The sections were prehybridized in prehybridization solution (50% formamide, 5ϫ SSC [1ϫ SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate], 40 g/ml salmon sperm) at 58°C for 2 h and incubated in hybridization buffer with DIG-labeled TRSV probe solution to a concentration of 100 to 200 ng/ml probe in prehybridization solution at 58°C overnight. After hybridization, the sections were washed twice in low-stringency wash solution (2ϫ SSC, 0.1% SDS) at room temperature for 5 min and washed twice in high-stringency wash solution (0.1ϫ SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 52°C for 15 min. The hybridization signals were detected with alkaline phosphatase (AP)-labeled sheep anti-DIG antibody conjugate (Roche Applied Science). The conjugate solution was added to the dry sections and incubated at 4°C for 2 h in a humid chamber. The slides were rinsed three times with washing buffers. The color development was performed by adding the buffer solution containing nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) to the tissue sections and incubating for 3 to 6 h at room temperature with protection from light. The color reaction was stopped by a 5-min wash in Tris-EDTA (0.1 mM, pH 8.0). The nonspecific staining was removed in 95% ethanol overnight. The sections were rehydrated through successive incubation in ethanol (70%, 95%, and 100%) and xylol (twice for 15 min each) and mounted in Eukitt resin. Negative control reactions included regular dUTP instead of DIG-labeled TRSV probe. In situ hybridization slides were observed under a light microscope (Eclipse TE 300; Nikon) and photographed with a Nikon digital camera (DXM 1200). Dark blue coloring indicates where the DIG-labeled probe bound directly to the viral RNA. The section hybridized with the negative control showed pink staining only from the application of nuclear fast red. Phylogenetic analysis. The sequences of the 731-bp TRSV fragment amplified from the region encoding the capsid protein by the primer pair TRSV-F2 and TRSV-R2 from honeybees, bee pollen, and Varroa mites were compared with existing GenBank sequences isolated from plants. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted in MEGA4 (63) . The sequences were aligned using ClustalW, and the sequences that could not be aligned unambiguously at both 3= and 5= ends were truncated. A tree was built using the neighbor-joining method (64) with distances computed using the maximum composite likelihood method (65) . The reliability of the phylogenies was assessed by bootstrap replication (500 replicates) (66) . Node labels correspond to bootstrap support, and values of Ͼ50% were regarded as evidence for the phylogenetic grouping. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The cDNA sequence data have been submitted to the GenBank sequence database and assigned the accession numbers JQ710729 and JQ710730 for the helicase and capsid protein coding regions, respectively.
