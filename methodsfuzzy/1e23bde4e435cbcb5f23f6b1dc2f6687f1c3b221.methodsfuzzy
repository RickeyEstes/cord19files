Two-hybrid system library screen. The yeast reporter strain AH109 [GAL4 2H-3] (Clontech) was used for the two-hybrid selection. Plasmid pAS2-7aD96-122 (Table 1 ) was used as bait and a pACT-cDNA library (human lymphocyte MATCHMAKER, Clontech) was used as the source of prey genes. Yeast cells were grown on YPD or on synthetic minimal medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, the appropriate auxotrophic supplements, 2% agar [for plates]) supplemented with 2% dextrose. Yeast was transformed with appropriate plasmids by the lithium acetate method and transformants were selected on synthetic minimal medium. The bait plasmid and the pB42AD cDNA library were introduced into the yeast strain AH109 [GAL4 2H -3] . Two-hybrid screen and interaction assays were performed essentially as described in the protocol (Clontech) in the presence of 2% galactose and 80 mg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-Dgalactopyranoside per liter. Prey plasmids were selected from yeast colonies giving a positive signal according to the manufacturer's protocol. False positives were eliminated by re-transforming the host AH109 [GAL4 2H-3] strain with pACT-cDNA library plus bait plasmid. Additionally, the pACT-cDNA was transfected in yeast strain PJ69-2A to check for autoactivation. The positive clones that contained cDNAs encoding 7ainteracting proteins were sequenced and analyzed using BLAST. Mammalian cell lines and DNA constructs. African Green monkey kidney epithelial (Vero E6) cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, USA) were maintained as described previously [9] . A cDNA clone expressing full-length 7a-HA were prepared as described previously [13] . A 7a-myc construct was prepared as in [13] , but instead the amplicon was cloned into pXJ40-3 0 myc; all 7a proteins were epitope-tagged at the C-terminus. Full length, as well as truncations of hSGT cDNA, tagged with an N-terminus flag epitope for expression in mammalian cells is summarized in Table 1 . All cDNA sequences were confirmed by sequencing. Antibodies used. Glutathione S-transferase-hSGT (GST-hSGT) fusion protein was constructed to raise SGT-specific antibodies in mice and rabbits. The full-length hSGT was digested from pXJ40-flag-hSGT with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into the compatible sites of pGEX-4T-1. Fusion proteins were expressed in BL-21 Escherichia coli by induction with isopropyl-1-thio-L-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at 37°C for 3 h. Subsequently, GST-hSGT was purified using Glutathione Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) and eluted with excess glutathione. Purified GST-hSGT was then used to raise polyclonal antibodies in mice and rabbits, as described in [18] . Polyclonal (Santa Cruz) and monoclonal anti-HA (Roche) and anti-flag (Sigma) antibodies were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. All procedures on animals were done in accordance with the regulations of the Animal Research Ethics Committee, Singapore. Transient expression and Western blotting. Vero E6 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Unless stated otherwise, 1 lg of plasmid cDNA was used for transfection into Vero E6 cells in transient expression studies; full-length flag-hSGT was used at 0.25 lg. Western blotting was done as described in [13] . Immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were extracted from transfected Vero E6 cells as described above. Typically, 150 lg of whole cell lysates was incubated with either rabbit anti-flag or rabbit anti-SGT antibody conjugated to Protein A-agarose beads (Roche) for 16 h at 4°C with endover-end mixing. Following incubation, the beads were collected and complexes were washed three times with IP buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and Western blotted as discussed above. Sequencing of the African Green monkey kidney epithelial SGT. Total cellular RNA was extracted from Vero E6 cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was prepared from 1.0 lg total RNA using the SuperScript II RNase Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Subsequently, a 1:10 dilution of the first-strand cDNA was used in a PCR according to standard protocols. The primary nucleotide sequence of African Green monkey kidney epithelial SGT (mSGT) was determined by automated sequencing and compared to the hSGT sequence (NCBI Accession No. NP_003012) using CLUSTAL X [19] . The conceptual amino acid sequence of mSGT was compared to hSGT and comparisons were visualized using GENEDOC software [20] . Immunoflourescence. Transiently transfected Vero E6 cells were grown on coverslips. At about 16 h posttransfection, the medium was removed and the coverslips fixed in methanol at À20°C. After 5 min, the coverslips were lifted out and completely air-dried. Fixed cells were incubated with the primary antibody combination of mouse anti-HA and rabbit anti-flag at room temperature for 1 h. Mouse anti-HA and rabbit anti-flag antibody were used at a dilution of 1:200. Following washing, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody combination of FITC-conjugated goat antimouse and Rh-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies at room temperature for 1 h (Santa Cruz Biochemicals, USA). Following extensive washing, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides and viewed.
