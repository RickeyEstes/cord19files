Cells and virus preparation. Human primary embryonic lung fibroblasts (MRC-5; purchased from ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-alanyl-glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 &micro;g/ml streptomycin. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Lonza (cc-2519) and cultured in endothelial growth medium (EGM-2; Clonetics) containing 2% FBS, human recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, heparin, gentamicin, and amphotericin B (1 g/ml each) (high-serum medium). HCMV isolate TR was derived originally from a patient with AIDS-related HCMV retinitis (39) . HCMV Toledo-P and Toledo-F viral DNA was extracted from E. coli using a Qiagen Midi-kit, digested with PacI, and electroporated into MRC-5 cells. Infectious virus was produced, and the titers of the virus were determined by plaque assay on MRC-5 cells as previously described (40) . Plasmids. Plasmids pCC1BAC-ura3 and pCC1BAC-his3 have been previously described (41) . PCR for viral DNA. Supernatant from fibroblasts infected with Toledo isolate passage 7 (P7) was used to extract viral DNA using the QIAamp MinElute virus spin kit (Qiagen). HCMV TR DNA was extracted with the same kit as a positive control. Two microliters of viral DNA was amplified with Taq 5ϫ Master Mix (New England BioLabs [NEB]) using the following primers (indicated in the parentheses) for the regions and diagnostic PCR indicated: UL127 (5=-ATGTGCCAGCTTGATGTCGC-3=) and UL130 (5=-CGCCAAGATTTT TGGAGCGCAC-3=) (PCR-1); UL127 (5=-ATGTGCCAGCTTGATGTCGC-3=) and UL133 (5=-GGTTGTGAACTCAC CGTCGG-3=) (PCR-2); UL133 (5=-GGTTGTGAACTCACCGTCGG-3=) and UL148 (5=-CGAGGCAGAACATCTCAA CC-3=) (PCR-3); UL128 (5=-GAGGGCCTTACAGCCTATGG-3=) and UL148 (5=-CGAGGCAGAACATCTCAACC-3=) (PCR-4). The thermocycler parameters were 95°C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles, with 1 cycle consisting of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min. HCMV Toledo genome sequencing and analysis. Viral DNA was isolated from the supernatant of fibroblasts infected with P7 Toledo as described above, and 210 l of isolated DNA was incubated with 30 l of shrimp DNase to remove host DNA (2 U/l) (Affymetrix) for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the shrimp DNase was inactivated by incubating at 70°C for 20 min. A 10-l sample was removed for quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. Viral DNA was then purified from the larger remaining sample with the QIAamp MinElute virus spin kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 50 l of buffer. qPCR was used to determine the removal of host DNA. Viral DNA was then used for sequencing using Illumina HiSeq paired-end sequencing. The sequence reads were sorted by barcode, trimmed, and mapped to HCMV Toledo (GenBank accession number GU937742.2) using CLC Bio's (Qiagen) clc_ref_assemble_long program, and variations were then extracted and reported using CLC Bio's find_variations program. Reported variations were manually inspected using CLC Bio's assembly_viewer program, and variations lacking sufficient evidence (lack of spanning reads or insufficient high-quality coverage) were discarded. In some cases, large structural variations were analyzed and reported manually, for example, a large inversion with indels at the termini that occurred at low frequency had to be determined by bespoke bioinformatic methods to partition sequencing reads based on the presence or absence of junction sequences, and then reassembling the partitions of reads separately and mapping contigs back to the reference sequence. The P7 Toledo-F, P7 Toledo-P, Assembled Toledo-F, Reconstituted Toledo-F, Assembled Toledo-P, and Reconstituted Toledo-P were aligned in Geneious (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) using the PhyML package to the reference strain (HCMV Toledo, GenBank accession number GU937742.2) available from NCBI and to each other for identification of insertions, deletions, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Yeast transformation by spheroplast formation. The S. cerevisiae strain VL6-48N (14) (MAT␣ his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ1 ura3-Δ1 lys2 ade2-101 met14 cir°) was used for all yeast transformations and grown in YPD (yeast extract, peptone, dextrose) medium supplemented with adenine. S. cerevisiae spheroplasts were prepared using previously described methods with the following modifications (16) . Overnight cultures were grown to an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) of 1. . DNA for transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning or assembly was added to 200 l of spheroplasts, followed by the addition of 900 l of 20% PEG solution (20% PEG 8000, 10 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM Tris-HCl). The suspension was incubated at room temperature for 20 min, the PEG solution was removed, and the cells were then incubated at 30°C for 30 min in SOS medium (1 M sorbitol, 6.5 mM CaCl 2 , 0.25% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone). Transformed yeast spheroplasts were plated with selective top agar with sorbitol. TAR cloning, screening, and processing of HCMV DNA fragments. Vectors were first PCR amplified using pCC1BAC-his3 as the template with Phusion (NEB) or Q5 (NEB) DNA polymerase. This plasmid contains bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and yeast centromeric plasmid (YCp) sequences for replication in E. coli and yeast. The primers add an I-SceI or PacI restriction site, flanked by 40 bp of HCMV homology, to each end of the vector backbone. PCR products were digested with DpnI (NEB) prior to transformation. Viral DNA, which was isolated from Toledo P7 as described above, was sheared by pipetting. Six hundred nanograms of viral genomic DNA was cotransformed with 20 ng of the appropriate vector into yeast spheroplasts. Transformants were patched on synthetic dropout medium without histidine and supplemented with adenine (SD-HIS) plates and after sufficient growth were selected and transferred into 20 l of 25 mM NaOH and incubated at 95°C for 30 min to lyse yeast cells. PCR on DNA from lysed yeast using the appropriate detection primers (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) was used to confirm the correct junction of the vector and HCMV fragment on each side. Positive TAR clone candidates from yeast patches or 3 ml of liquid cultures were resuspended in 500 l of water containing 5 l of zymolyase 20T (MP Bio) (10 mg/ml) and 0.5 l of ␤-mercaptoethanol (14.2 M) and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Fifty microliters of 2% SDS was added, and the solution was incubated for 15 min at 70°C, followed by the addition of 50 l of 5 M potassium acetate and incubation on ice for 5 min. After clarification, the DNA in the supernatant was precipitated with isopropanol and resuspended in 50 l of Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer. Isolated DNA was then electroporated into E. coli EPI300 (Epicentre) or DH10B (Thermo Fisher) competent cells. DNA was purified from positive transformants for restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. Assembly of complete HCMV genomes using TAR in yeast. Cultures of all 16 TAR clones in E. coli were grown up, and DNA was isolated with PureLink HiPure Plasmid Midiprep kit (Thermo Fisher). Prior to assembly, the clones were digested with I-SceI and heat killed to release the HCMV fragments. Assembly of HCMV genomes was performed by TAR assembly in yeast in two steps. First, half genomes (TAR01 to TAR08 and TAR09 to TAR16) were assembled as follows. Vector DNA was amplified by PCR using pCCIBAC-ura3 as the template and either Con01R (R stands for reverse)and Con08F (F stands for Engineering of HCMV Using Synthetic Biology Tools September/October 2017 Volume 2 Issue 5 e00331-17 msphere.asm.org 13 forward) or CMV_1R and CMV_8F (Table S1 ) as primers for TAR01 to TAR08 or Con09R and Con16F or CMV_9R and CMV_16F (Table S1 ) for TAR09 to TAR16. For assembly of each half genome, 10 ng of vector DNA and 100 ng each of all other DNA fragments was added to spheroplasts. Transformants were patched on plates containing synthetic dropout medium without uracil and supplemented with adenine, and DNA was screened by PCR for the appropriate junctions with the respective detection primers (Table S1 ) using NaOH lysis. Positive half genomes were transformed into E. coli EPI300 competent cells and screened by PCR to confirm the appropriate junctions. For assembly of the full genome, the half genomes were processed with I-SceI or PacI endonuclease as described above to release the fragments. Vector DNA was amplified by PCR using pCCIBAC-his3 as the template and Con01R and Con16F or CMV_1R and CMV_16F as primers (Table S1 ). Ten nanograms of vector DNA and 100 ng each of the half genomes was added for assembly to spheroplasts. Transformants were patched onto SD-HIS plates, and DNA was screened by PCR for all of the appropriate junctions with the respective detection primers (Table S1 ) using NaOH lysis methods previously mentioned. As before, positive clones were transformed into E. coli EPI300 competent cells as described above and screened by PCR to confirm the appropriate junctions. Synthesis and purification of Cas9 and chimeric synthetic guide RNAs. A single colony of E. coli Alpha-Select Gold Efficiency (Bioline) harboring the pJExpress404-FLAG-Cas9-His construct was cultured overnight in 50 ml LB supplemented with 100 g/ml carbenicillin (Teknova). The starter culture was diluted into 1 liter of antibiotic-supplemented LB broth and shaken at 220 rpm at 37°C to an OD 600 of 0.6. The culture was then cooled to 20°C, and isopropyl-␤-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM to induce protein expression. Cas9 protein was induced overnight in a refrigerated incubator at 20°C under shaking (220 rpm). Cell pellets were washed once with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and then resuspended in 60-ml volumes of xTractor buffer supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Clontech), 2 mg lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich), and 625 U Benzonase (Millipore). Cell suspensions were then gently rotated for 2 h at 4°C prior to mechanical lysis in a Microfluidizer M-110L (Microfluidics). Cell debris was pelleted at 8,000 ϫ g for 1 h, and recombinant protein was purified from the supernatant using a HisTalon column (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified protein was stored at Ϫ80°C in Cas9 buffer (150 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 10% glycerol) at a concentration of 4.5 mg/ml. The Cas9targeting chimeric synthetic guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed, in vitro synthesized, and purified as described previously (42) . Modification of Toledo-F TAR01 and TAR07. Previously assembled HCMV Toledo-F fragments TAR01 and TAR07 contained within the E. coli-yeast shuttle pCC1BAC_HIS3 were purified using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). Plasmid-borne genomic fragments were then independently digested with Cas9 in conjunction with two sgRNAs (fragment 1, 5=-CAAUGGACUGGCGAUUUAGUUUUAGAGCUAGAAAUAGCAAG UUAAAAUAAGGCUAGUCCGUUAUCAACUUGAAAAAGUGGCACCGAGUCGGUGCUUUUUUU-3= and 5=-GAUGC GAUCGCAGUUACGGUUUUAGAGCUAGAAAUAGCAAGUUAAAAUAAGGCUAGUCCGUUAUCAACUUGAAAAAG UGGCACCGAGUCGGUGCUUUUUUU-3= and fragment 7 5=-UGUGGAAUUCCGGACAUAGUUUUAGAGCUAGA AAUAGCAAGUUAAAAUAAGGCUAGUCCGUUAUCAACUUGAAAAAGUGGCACCGAGUCGGUGCUUUUUUU-3= and 5=-UUACGUAUACCGGAUGCUGUUUUAGAGCUAGAAAUAGCAAGUUAAAAUAAGGCUAGUCCGUUAUCA ACUUGAAAAAGUGGCACCGAGUCGGUGCUUUUUUU-3= [Cas9 targeting sequences are underlined]), liberating DNA fragments of roughly 350 bp and 70 bp, respectively. One-hour digestions were performed at 37°C in 50-l volume and contained 500 ng of plasmid DNA, 1 g each gRNA, 10 mM spermidine (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM MgCl 2 (Ambion), 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 3.6 g of Cas9 protein. Following digestion, Cas9 was heat inactivated at 80°C for 10 min, and digested DNA was extracted with UltraPure phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, vol/vol; pH 8), precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in sterile water. DNA fragments used to generate Toledo-P insert fragments 1 and 7 were obtained from de novo-synthesized gblocks (IDT). The Toledo-P fragment 1 insert encoded a 279-bp insertion not found in the Toledo-F sequence. Conversely, the Toledo-P fragment 7 insert removed a 52-bp insert found only in Toledo-F. Both DNA inserts contained 20-to 100-bp overlap sequences homologous to regions upstream and downstream of the Cas9 digestion sites to facilitate in vitro assembly. Synthesized insert fragments were mixed with corresponding digested products at a 3:1 molar ratio (insert-vector) and covalently joined via standard Gibson Assembly reaction (SGI-DNA). Following assembly, constructs were transformed into E. coli TransforMax EPI300 electrocompetent cells (Epicentre) and plated on selective media. Transformants were verified to contain new inserts using PCR and Sanger sequencing prior to final confirmation of the full Toledo-P genome sequence by nextgeneration sequencing (NGS). Modification of Toledo-F TAR013. NGS sequencing data indicated that the Toledo-P genome contained a large 14.3-kb genomic inversion flanked by two small insertions (14 and 23 bp). This large inversion was entirely contained within the previously generated Toledo-F genomic fragment 13. Utilizing primers 5=-GCAAAGTGAACGACAAGGCGCAGTACCTGCTG-3= and 5=-CCTAGTAACACTCGTCCGAC ACTTCCACCATCTCCAGC-3= (IDT), the ends of genomic fragment 13 backbone were PCR amplified together with the E. coli-yeast shuttle pCC1BAC_HIS3 vector. In a second PCR, the 14.3-kb inverted sequence was amplified with Ultramer oligonucleotides 5=-CTCTCCAGGTACTGATCCAGGCCCACGATCCG GGTTATCTTGTCGTATTCCAGGTTGATCCATCGATAGGGAACGCTGCCAGCGGCGCCCAGCAGGTACTGCGCCTT GTCGTTCACTTTGCCGCAGCGTATTCGCCCGTCAGCTTCGAGGTATAACCTACAACACGGAGGGGAAGGGGGGT ACAAAACGTGAAATTAGAC-3= and 5=-GAGACGACGCCGCTGGTAGAGGATGCCGAACCGCCGGCCGAGCTGG AGATGGTGGAAGTGTCGGACGAGTGTTACTAGGAGATCGCCGCGGCCGATGGGCGCCGGCGGACGTGACTCGG CAGCCGCTGTAGGGATAAATAGTGCGATGGCGTTTGTGG-3=, generating an inverted sequence with the indicated terminal inserts flanked by 121-bp overlap sequences homologous to regions at the ends of the first amplicon. Both PCRs were performed with the KOD Xtreme Hot Start DNA polymerase (Millipore) using the Toledo-F genomic fragment 13 as the template and according to the manufacturer's specifications. The amplicons were digested with DpnI (NEB) and purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Following purification, amplicons were mixed at an equal molar ratio and covalently joined via standard Gibson Assembly reaction (SGI-DNA). Following assembly, constructs were transformed into E. coli TransforMax EPI300 electrocompetent cells (Epicentre) and plated on selective media. Transformants were verified to contain new inserts using PCR and Sanger sequencing prior to final confirmation of the full Toledo-P genome sequence by NGS. Engraftment and infection of humanized mice. All animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations of the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (number IS00003498) at the Oregon Health & Science University. NOD-scid IL2R␥ c null (NSG) mice were maintained at a pathogen-free facility at Oregon Health & Science University in accordance with procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Both sexes of animals were used. Humanized mice were generated as previously described (30) . The animals (12 to 14 weeks after engraftment) were treated with 25 ng/mouse lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and after 6 h, they were infected via intraperitoneal injection of human dermal fibroblasts previously infected with HCMV TR, Toledo-P, or Toledo-F at approximately 5 ϫ 10 5 PFU per mouse. A control group of engrafted mice were mock infected using uninfected fibroblasts. At 4 weeks postinfection, the infected mice were split into two groups, and one group was treated with 100 l of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (300 mg/ml; Amgen) using a subcutaneous micro-osmotic pump (1007D; Alzet) and 125 g AMD3100 [1,1=-[1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)]bis-1,4,8,11-tetra-azacyclotetradecane octahydrochloride or plerixafor] administered intraperitoneally to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). The remaining mice serve as a direct comparison for the effects of virus reactivation and dissemination that follow HPC mobilization. One week after HPC mobilization, the mice were sacrificed, their organs were harvested, and samples for PCR were frozen in RNAlater solution and stored at Ϫ80°C for subsequent analysis. Quantitative PCR for viral genomes. Total DNA was extracted from approximately 1-mm 2 sections of mouse spleen or liver using the DNAzol kit (Life Technologies). HCMV genomes were analyzed using quantitative PCR (TaqMan) performed on 1 &micro;g of total DNA and using TaqMan FastAdvance PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers and a probe recognizing HCMV UL141 were used to quantify HCMV genomes (probe, CGAGGGAGAGCAAGTT; forward primer, 5=-GATGTGGGCCGAGAATTATGA; reverse primer, 5=-ATGGGCCAGGAGTGTGTCA). The probe contains a 5= FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) reporter molecule and a 3= quencher molecule (Applied Biosystems). The reaction was initiated using TaqMan Fast Advanced master mix (Applied Biosystems) activated at 95°C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles (1 cycle consists of 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C) using a StepOnePlus TaqMan thermocycler. Results were analyzed using ABI StepOne software. Data were analyzed using the statistical program GraphPad Prism 5. Statistical significance was determined using two-way analysis of variance, followed by Bonferroni's posttest correction. A P value of Ͻ0.05 or lower was considered significant. Accession number(s). The genome sequences of P7 Toledo-F, P7 Toledo-P as well as assembled Toledo-F and Toledo-P have been submitted to GenBank under accession numbers MF783090 to MF783093.
