The PERCH study sought to determine the cause of severe pneumonia in children aged 1-59 months living in developing areas [21] . The detailed methods of this multisite case-control study, including a description of case and control enrollment, have been published elsewhere [22, 23] . Briefly, in each of 9 sites in 7 countries (Dhaka and Matlab, Bangladesh; Basse, The Gambia; Kilifi, Kenya; Bamako, Mali; Soweto, South Africa; Sa Kaeo and Nakhon Phanom, Thailand; and Lusaka, Zambia), from August 2011 to January 2014, children presenting to study facilities with WHOdefined severe or very severe pneumonia were evaluated for enrollment using standardized criteria. Controls were randomly selected children from the community without severe or very severe pneumonia and were frequency matched for age (4 age strata) within 2 weeks of the matched case enrollment. Blood, NP/OP swab specimens, and urine were collected from both cases and controls; blood cultures and IS specimens were also collected from cases. IS specimen collection was attempted within 24 hours of hospital admission for each PERCH case unless contraindicated. The methods for sputum induction are described elsewhere [24, 25] . In brief, participants were given a Î²2-agonist followed by nebulized hypertonic saline solution. A sterile closed-loop mucus extractor attached to a suction device was inserted through the nose into the nasopharynx. Suction was applied once the extractor was in the nasopharynx and was discontinued before the extractor was removed. Secretions were flushed into a collection container using 5 mL of sterile normal saline. All laboratory methods were highly standardized across all study laboratories [25, 26] . Quantitative real-time PCR for respiratory pathogens was performed on IS and NP/OP specimens, as described elsewhere [27] .
