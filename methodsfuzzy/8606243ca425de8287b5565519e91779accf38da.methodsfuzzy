After informed consent, participants were provided with written instructions and materials for the self-collection of NS and throat swabs. Participants collected nasal specimens using a polyurethane foam nasal swab (Puritan Medical Products Co., LLC; no. 25-1805-1PF-SC2 Arrow) after instillation of 0.5 mL of normal saline into one nostril and rotating the swab five seconds in the anterior naris as previously described [8] . Throat swabs were collected by swabbing the back of the throat and each tonsil area 2-3 times using a nylon flocked swab (Copan Diagnostics, no.502CS01) and placed in universal transport media. The swabs were transferred to the laboratory by study personnel per manufacturer recommendations, and we have previously shown both specimen types to be stable for 7 days at room temperature [8] . Participants also filled out a comprehensive symptom survey as previously described [3] .
