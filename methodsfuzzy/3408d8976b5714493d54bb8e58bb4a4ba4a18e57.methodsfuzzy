The RT±PCR was performed in single tube using a single enzyme, recombinant Thermus thermophilus (rTth) DNA polymerase according to Weinstock et al., 2000. TaqMan/RT±PCR assays were carried out in a 96-well¯at-bottomed microtiter plate (Perkin-Elmer). The reaction mixture for each one-tube-TaqMan reaction mix consisted of 5 ml of TaqMan universal 10Â buffer, 8 ml of 25 mM MgCl 2 , 1 ml of 10 mM forward primer, 1 ml of 10 mM reverse primer, 5 ml of 1 mM¯uorogenic FAM labeled BVDV type I probe, 5 ml of 1 mM¯uorogenic VIC labeled BVDV type II probe, 1.5 ml of each dNTP (A,C,G,U), 13 ml of DEPC water, 0.25 ml of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (5 U/ ml), 0.25 ml MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (100 U/ml), 1.0 ml of RNAse inhibitor (20 U/ ml), and 2.5 ml of BVD viral RNA sample to a total volume of 50 ml. Thermocycling conditions were as follows: 30 mm at 488C for reverse transcription; 10 min at 958C to activate DNA polymerase and to deactivate RT; 45 cycles of 15 s at 958C to denature and 1 min at 608C for annealing and extension. The two-tube TaqMan reaction involved RT and PCR steps in separate tubes with incorporation of¯uorogenic probes in the PCR process. The RT mix consisted of 0.5 ml RNAse Inhibitor (40 U/ml), 2.0 ml of 10Â TaqMan Universal master mix buffer, 3.6 ml MgCl 2 (25 mM), 1.0 ml of reverse primer (10 mM), 1.0 ml each dNTPS A,C,G,U (10 mM), 5.0 ml DEPC water 0.44 ml of moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (50 U/ml). The BVD viral RNA sample was heated at 658C for 5 min and 2.5 ml (10±100 ng/ml) was added to mix. Thermocycler conditions for RT were 1 h at 428C for RT and 2 min at 728C for denaturing unused RNA sample. The PCR mix was made up to a volume of 50 ml, containing 5.0 ml of 10Â TaqMan Universal master mix buffer, 80 ml MgCl 2 (25 mM), 1.0 ml of forward primer (10 mM), 1.0 ml of reverse primer (10 mM), 5 ml of 1 mM¯uorogenic FAM labeled BVDV type I probe, 5 ml of 1 mM¯uorogenic VIC labeled BVDV type II probe, 1.0 ml of each dNTP, 0.25 ml of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (5 U/ml), 12.75 ml of DEPC water and 8 ml of cDNA. After 2 min incubation at 508C, 10 min incubation at 958C, the cDNA was ampli®ed by 40 two-step cycles: 15 s at 958C and 1 min at 608C.
