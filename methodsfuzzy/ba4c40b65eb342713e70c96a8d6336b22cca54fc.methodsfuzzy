Mice. 4-6-wk-old B10.A mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). All studies were done with freshly isolated cells from 6-8 wk old B10.A mice. Antibodies and Probes. Fluoresceinated anti-human IgG secondary antibodies were used to detect the binding of the CHE-FcD probe to the cells. FITC, phycoerythrin or tricolor conjugated rat monoclonal antibodies against murine CD4 and CD8 were purchased from Caltag Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). Binding of biotinylated rat monoclonal antibodies (from Phar-Mingen, San Diego, CA) against murine CD25, CD69, CD5, Mel 14, CD45RB, CD43, and Pgp-1 was detected using appropriately conjugated streptavidin in all flow cytometric assays. The anti-CD43 monoclonal antibody S7 recognized the 115-kD isoform of CD43. The 23G2 clone of the anti CD45RB monoclonal antibody was used in all FACS ® staining and Western blots. Binding of anti-CD45RB and CD43 antibodies to proteins in Western blots was detected using Neutravidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate purchased from Pierce (Rockford, Illinois). The anti-mouse CD3 hamster hybridoma 2C11was prepared in ascites form and used to stain cells expressing the TCR. The rat anti-mouse heat stable antigen (HSA) was used as a culture supernatant from the J11D hybridoma. JONES antibody (a mouse IgM recognizing 9-O -acetylated G D3 ) (9) was purchased from Sigma Chem. Co. (St. Louis, MO) while 27A, a mouse IgG (22) with the same specificity as JONES, was obtained from cell culture supernatants of hybridomas provided by M. Farquhar (UCSD). The soluble chimeric protein CHE-Fc, consisting of the extracellular domain of influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase fused to the Fc portion of human IgG 1 was generated and characterized as described (3) . The modified form CHE-FcD was generated by treating CHE-Fc with 1 mM DFP to inactivate the esterase activity as described (3) . CHE-Fc specifically releases 9-O -acetyl esters from Sias (i.e., it functions as an esterase), whereas CHE-FcD specifically recognizes and binds to 9-O -acetylated Sias (3). Fluoresceinated peanut agglutinin lectin (PNA) was obtained from EY Laboratories Inc. (San Mateo, CA). Flow Cytometric Analysis of 9-O-Acetylation on Cells. The expression of cell surface 9-O -acetylated sialic acids was examined by flow cytometric analysis on a FACScan ® machine. Freshly obtained live cells from B10.A mouse thymus, lymph nodes and spleen were prepared after hypotonic lysis of RBCs and 1 ϫ 10 6 cells were washed and suspended in ice cold PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide (staining buffer). The CHE-FcD probe was allowed to bind to the cells after being immunocomplexed with FITC or phycoerythrin conjugated goat antihuman secondary antibody. CHE-FcD (3 g) was incubated with a 1 in 100 dilution of the secondary antibody at 4 Њ C overnight. This pre-complexing step increases the overall avidity of the probe towards 9-O -acetylated sialic acids. The CHE-FcD ϩ anti-human IgG Fc immunocomplex was allowed to bind to the cells for 2 h on ice. For all double and triple-color stainings, the CHE-FcD probe was allowed to bind to the cells before staining with the remaining antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. The CHE-Fc was used under identical conditions as a negative control for CHE-FcD binding. In studies where cells had to be de-O -acetylated before staining, CHE-Fc was used at a final concentration of 10 g/ml in a volume of 50 l of staining buffer containing 3-5 ϫ 10 6 cells and incubated at 37 Њ C for 1 h. For trypsinization, cells were incubated in 0.1% trypsin with 0.5 mM EDTA in Hank's balanced salt solution for 1 h in a 37 Њ C water bath, then washed twice with cold PBS before staining. The loss of anti-CD4 binding was used to confirm trypsin activity. For treatment with OSGPase (Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd., Ontario, Canada) 5 ϫ 10 6 live cells in 100 l of staining buffer were incubated with 5 l of the reconstituted enzyme at 37 Њ C for 1 h. Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS before staining. Decrease in CHE-FcD binding to murine erythroleukemia cells following OSGPase treatment was used as a positive control for this enzyme (data not shown). Following staining, cells were washed with excess staining buffer and fixed in PBS containing 1% formaldehyde (fixing buffer). Stained fixed cells were kept in dark at 4 Њ C and analyzed by flow cytometry the same day. Purification of CD4 T Cells. Fresh mouse lymphocytes from either spleen or lymph nodes were prepared after hypotonic lysis of RBCs and separation of dead cells by Ficoll Hypaque density centrifugation. Cells were stained with rat anti-mouse CD4 conjugated with magnetic beads from Miltenyi Biotec, Inc. (Auburn, CA). This antibody was used at a final dilution of 1:10 to stain 10 million live cells in a volume of 100 l on ice for 30 min. CD4 cells were then separated using a magnetic cell sorter (MACS). The purity of the sorted population, confirmed by flow cytometry, was ‫ف‬ 90%. In some cases, CD4 cells were separated on a Becton Dickinson FACSorter ® after staining with tricolor conjugated rat anti-mouse CD4. Activation of T Cells. Either total cells or FACSorted ® CD4 T cells from mouse lymph nodes were activated in EHAA medium (from GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS, 1% l -glutamine, 5 ϫ 10 Ϫ 5 M 2-ME, 1% penicillin and streptomycin and 10 mM Hepes (referred hereafter as EHAA growth medium) at 37 Њ C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 in the presence of 2 ng per ml of PMA and 300 nM ionomycin. Typically 5 ϫ 10 6 cells were cultured in 2 ml of medium per well in a 6-well plate. Aliquots of cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry for levels of expression of 9-O -acetylation on subsequent days. In other experiments, either total lymph node cells or 0.5 ϫ 10 6 CD4 T cells mixed with 2.5 ϫ 10 6 mitomycin-treated syngenic mouse spleen cells in 200 l of EHAA growth medium were placed in 96-well plates coated with 50 ng 2C11 mAb to cross-link the TCR complex and activate the cells. Studies to Check for CHE-FcD Induced Activation. CHE-FcD probe in amounts ranging from 0.5 to 3 g was allowed to bind overnight at 4 Њ C on to Staph protein A-coated 96-well plates. 0.5 ϫ 10 6 lymphocytes from peripheral lymph nodes were then incubated with 200 l of EHAA growth medium per coated well. Triplicate wells were set up for each amount of CHE-FcD. An identical setup with CHE-Fc was done as a negative control. 2 d later, the cells were pulsed with 1 Ci/well of [ 3 H]thymidine and the following day the cells were harvested onto glass fiber filtermats. The amount of incorporated radioactivity was determined on a betaplate reader (Wallac 1205; Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Cross-linking with 2C11 as described above was done as a positive control. In another set of experiments, CHE-FcD was allowed to bind to CD4 T cells in solution without cross-linking its ligands. Assays were once again done in triplicate for each amount of CHE-FcD in 96-well flat bottomed plates with 0.1 ϫ 10 6 purified CD4 cells and 0.5 ϫ 10 6 mitomycin-treated syngenic mouse splenic cells added in 200 l of EHAA growth medium per well. The final concentration of CHE-FcD in the wells varied from 10-100 g/ml. Similar amounts of CHE-Fc were used as a negative control. To see whether CHE-FcD binding to cells either potentiated or diminished the response to other activating stimuli, cells were stimulated pharmacologically using PMA or by cross-linking the TCR with an anti-CD3 antibody 2C11. The stimulation was carried out using increasing doses of the stimulating agent over a range that gave concomitant increases in activation. CHE-Fc or CHE-FcD (50 g/ml final) was used in combination with the varying amounts of PMA or anti-CD3, and compared to cells being activated in the absence of CHE-Fc or CHE-FcD. Cells were incubated for 4 d before being pulsed with 1 Ci/well of [ 3 H]thymidine. The incorporated radioactivity was quantitated as described earlier. Extraction of Glycoproteins and Glycolipids. Membrane proteins were prepared from spleen and lymph node cells remaining after hypotonic lysis of red blood cells. The cells were washed with 1 ϫ PBS three times followed by hypotonic lysis in the presence of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, and a cocktail of protease inhibitors. They were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation and spun at 500 g at 4ЊC to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The cloudy supernatant was then spun at 100,000 g at 4ЊC to obtain a total membrane pellet. The membranes were then extracted with 1% Triton X-100 in 1ϫ Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0 (TBS), separated from the membrane debris by recentrifugation at 100,000 g, and the protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Typically 600-700 g of membrane proteins could be obtained from 3.5 ϫ 10 8 cells and were adjusted to ‫2-1ف‬ g/l for use in Western blots and immunoprecipitation assays. To purify gangliosides, the washed cell pellets were sequentially extracted by 10-20 vol CHCl 3 /MeOH (2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 vol/vol), using brief homogenization. The extracts were pooled, dried down, and brought up in CHCl 3 /MeOH/water in the ratio of 4:8:5.6. After phase separation, the gangliosides were enriched in the hydophilic upper phase. This was dried down, resuspended in methanol, and kept at Ϫ20ЊC until use. ELISA Plate Assay for 9-O-Acetylation on Gangliosides. Total ganglioside extracts prepared as above were studied by lipid ELISA as described previously (23) . In brief, lipids were applied to the plates in 45% methanol, allowed to dry, and then blocked with 5% BSA in PBS overnight. The effects of base (de-O-acetylation) on reactivity were assessed by treatment with 0.1 M NaOH at 4ЊC for 30 min (these conditions do not cause any loss of bound gangliosides). After treatment, the plates were extensively washed with PBS, blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h, and then incubated with CHE-FcD (20 g/ml) for 2 h. After washing three times with 1% BSA, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was added (at 1:1,000 dilution) for 1 h. After washing further, the reaction was developed as described above. Background levels determined with the secondary antibody alone were subtracted. Western Blot Assays. Membrane proteins were extracted as described above from total lymphocytes harvested from mouse spleen and lymph nodes. SDS-PAGE was done under reducing conditions in 7.5% gels. The electrophoresed material was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in 1ϫ TBS for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with the primary probe overnight at 4ЊC on a rocking platform. CHE-FcD was used at a concentration of 5 g/ml and the biotinylated monoclonals S7 (anti-CD43 115-kD isoform) and 23G2 (anti-CD45RB) were used at a concentration of 1 g/ml in 1X TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After this the membranes were washed thrice with 0.05% Tween 20 in 1ϫ TBS for 30 min and incubated with the secondary reagents for 1 h at room temperature. Bound biotinylated antibodies were detected with 1:5,000 dilution of Neutravidin-alkaline phosphatase (Pierce Chem. Co., Rockford, IL) and CHE-FcD binding was assayed with 1:2,500 dilution of goat anti-human Fc conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). The membranes were washed thrice with 0.05% Tween 20 in 1ϫ TBS for 30 min and then with 1ϫ TBS and put in alkaline phosphatase buffer (pH 9.5) before adding the substrates NBT/BCIP at a 1: 100 dilution. The reaction was allowed to progress for 5-15 min before washing with water and drying. Selective Precipitation of 9-O-Acetylated Glycoproteins from Membrane Extracts. 100-150 g of the membrane protein extract was first precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads by end over end rolling at 4ЊC for 2 h. Meanwhile, 75 g of CHE-FcD was allowed to complex with 50 l of protein A-sepharose by end over end rolling at 4ЊC for the same length of time. The whole mixture was then incubated overnight with the precleared sample in a volume of 500 l with end over end rolling at 4ЊC. The beads were then spun, washed in TBS, pH 7.4 and 6.8, successively and boiled in SDS sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol. The eluted proteins were loaded on SDS-PAGE gel and probed with anti-CD45RB and anti-CD43 monoclonals as described here. The CHE-Fc molecule served as a negative control for the proteins specifically bound by CHE-FcD. The immunoprecipitates were also reprobed with CHE-FcD to confirm their reactivity to check the percentage of total 9-O-acetylated proteins that was precipitated.
