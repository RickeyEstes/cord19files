Choosing optimal tests depends on the specific virus being sought, clinical setting, specimen type, availability of kits, reagents and equipment, experience of laboratory personnel, and cost. The use of NAATs is rapidly replacing older viral diagnostic methods because of the rapid turnaround time, superior sensitivity, and ability to quantify virus density of NAATs. Several relatively simple in-house and commercially available NAATs are available for a wide variety of viruses. However, some laboratories continue to use antigen detection methods and virus culture when expertise in molecular techniques is not available or cost is prohibitive. Serologic methods can be used to diagnose a current or recent acute infection, to determine specific susceptibility or immunity, and for epidemiologic and surveillance purposes. Interpretation of serologic results is virus specific. For example, the presence of HIV antibodies indicates current infection, whereas the presence of IgG antirubella indicates immunity as a result of immunization or recovery from natural infection. Serologic diagnosis of acute infection is more useful when the incubation period is prolonged (e.g., 3-6 weeks) and antibody is present in serum concomitantly with signs of illness (e.g., EBV and CMV mononucleosis). Fig. 287 .1 shows a typical antibody response for an acute, moderate-incubation (several days to 2 weeks) viral illness such as measles. At the onset of rash or other manifestations, antibody is undetectable or is present at low titer. Within 10 to 14 days, appreciable titers of antibody are present. For short-incubation virus infections (e.g., respiratory viruses), a rise in antibody usually does not occur until the late recovery phase or during convalescence and therefore has no value for diagnosis during acute infection. Older serologic methods such as hemagglutination inhibition and complement fixation (CF), which relied on a greater than fourfold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent sera tested in parallel, have largely been replaced by solid phase immunoassays such as EIAs, passive latex agglutination, and immunofluoresence assay (IFA). The presence of antibody in high titer in a single serum specimen during convalescence usually does not permit a definitive diagnosis. Seroconversion can be used to diagnose an acute or recent infection. EIAs and ELISAs are highly standardized, can be quantitative, can detect IgG or IgM antibodies, or both, and, for some viruses such as HIV and HCV, can simultaneously detect both antigen and antibodies in a single assay. 43, 44 EIAs can be noncompetitive ("sandwich assay") or viruses or assays. Some exceptions include the use of saliva for the detection of HIV antibodies and CSF in patients with viral central nervous system (CNS) disease. 53, 54 Optimal Tests for Specific Viruses Table 287 .1 contains a list of the medically important viruses, major attributable diseases, optimal diagnostic specimens, available tests, and average time to a positive test result. For many tests, the time to obtain a result is a function of the test itself (e.g., culture), the logistics of laboratory testing schedules, or the need to refer a sample to a reference laboratory. The preferred test provides the fastest result with acceptable sensitivity (>90%) and specificity (>95%). The preferred diagnostic test or tests can vary, depending on the patient population being tested (e.g., immunocompromised hosts) and the clinical indication.
