The overall study design for the abattoir survey has been described previously [14] . Briefly, 626 qualifying pigs were sampled at 14 abattoirs in England and Northern Ireland, between January and May 2013. These pigs originated from 439 farms, with between 1 and 10 pigs from each. The majority of pigs were from farms in England (81.7%), followed by Northern Ireland (13.4%), Scotland (4.5%), and Wales (0.3%), which is representative of the UK pig population [16] . Of the samples collected from each selected carcass along the processing line, those relevant for the investigation of HEV and PRRSV were a blood sample (whole blood with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)), tonsil, and the whole cecum. Antibody to PRRSV had been detected in 362 of 621 plasma samples, with 11 additional samples being inconclusive [14] . Only 610 of these plasma samples were also analyzed for the presence of antibodies to HEV, with 354 of these being sero-positive for PRRSV. Tonsil samples from all seropositive or inconclusive pigs were then tested by a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect PRRSV nucleic acid. The tonsils of four other pigs for which plasma samples-and hence enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results-were missing were also tested by PCR, while for five seropositive animals the tonsil samples were not available, so a total of 372 tonsil samples were analyzed; only 358 of these animals also had matching HEV PCR data. RNA was extracted from the tonsil samples using the MagNA Pure LC DNA Isolation kit II (Tissue) following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics, Burgess Hill, UK), setting the sample volume to 110 µL and the elution volume to 200 µL. A real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the nucleocapsid (ORF7) gene of PRRSV and differentiating genotypes 1 and 2 was used [17] with a Stratagene Mx3000P QPCR System (Agilent Genomics, Wokingham, UK). Sequencing of the PRRSV open reading frame 5 (ORF5) gene was subsequently performed on nucleic acids from tonsil samples testing positive in the diagnostic PRRSV PCR to characterize the viruses present [6] . The PCR amplicons were purified using the Beckman AMPure solid phase reversible immobilisation (SPRI) technique (Beckman Coulter Ltd., High Wycombe, UK). Cycle sequencing was performed using forward and reverse primers and ABI BigDye chemistry (Applied Biosystems Ltd., Warrington, UK) at the end of which the dye terminators were removed using Beckman CleanSEQ SPRI (Beckman Coulter Ltd., High Wycombe, UK). Samples were sequenced on an ABI capillary electrophoresis DNA analyser (Applied Biosystems Ltd., Warrington, UK) and the raw data analysed by ABI SeqScape software (Applied Biosystems Ltd., Warrington, UK). The resulting sequences were aligned with 48 reference sequences from GenBank, and with 431 other UK PRRSV ORF5 sequences from samples submitted to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) for PRRS diagnostic testing between 1991 and 2014, using the ClustalW algorithm [18] in MEGA6 [19] . The phylogenetic tree was generated in MEGA6 using the neighbour-joining method [20] , with the evolutionary distances being computed using the maximum composite likelihood method [21] . The sequences obtained were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers MF043094 to MF043116. Existing data for PRRSV seropositivity [14] and HEV seropositivity and active infection [15] were collated with data obtained in this study for PRRSV active infection. Associations between the two viruses, or antibodies to them, in the same carcasses were investigated using χ 2 tests, with Stata v.12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Collated data for PRRSV seropositivity and HEV seropositivity and active infection (RNA in plasma and/ or cecal contents) were available for 610 pigs. Collated data for PRRSV active infection (RNA in tonsil) and seropositivity and active infection for HEV were available for 358 pigs.
