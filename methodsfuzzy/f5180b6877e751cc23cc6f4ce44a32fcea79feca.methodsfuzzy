Cell culture and plasmids CHO-K1 cells were maintained in Kaighn's modified F-12K nutrient mixture with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. M12 cells were kindly provided by Daniel Ory (Millard et al., 2000) . BHK cells were maintained in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) with 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin. Vero and 293T cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin. All cultures were grown in 5% CO 2 . pCAGGS-EboGP-V5 (strain Zaire 1976 Mayinga), pCB6-VSV G, pCB6-EboZ GP, pCAGGS SARS S and pSPAX have been previously described (Simmons et al., 2002 (Simmons et al., , 2004 . pCAGGS-EboGPrrkr-V5 was generated by site directed mutagenesis of pCAGGS-EboGP-V5. pLenti CMV GFP Hygro, hCathepsinL, and hCathepsinB were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). The cDNA for TIM-1 was obtained from Open Biosystems and was cloned into pLKO by PCR. VSV-XN2 rLuc, VSV-L, VSV-N, and VSV-P expression plasmids, all under the control of the T7 promoter, were kindly provided by Robert Doms. VSV-XN2 EboGP mCherry was made by overlapping extension PCR. The flanking primer at the 5 0 end contained an MluI restriction site and was used to amplify ebolavirus Zaire GP. The flanking primer at the 3 0 end contained an NheI restriction site and was used to amplify mCherry. The internal primers were designed such that an additional junction sequence, flanked by KpnI and XhoI, was inserted between GP and mCherry. The rLuc gene was removed from VSV-XN2 rLuc by cleavage with MluI and NheI and replaced with the GP-KpnIjunction-XhoI-mCherry sequence. pLenti CMV NPC1 Hygro was constructed by removing the GFP gene from pLenti CMV GFP Hygro and inserting into its place the NPC1 cDNA (Origene). pSport6 Axl (clone ID 5205825) was from Open Biosystems. pcDNA3.1 furin and pcDNA3.1-ACE2 were previously described (Simmons et al., 2005; Wool-Lewis and Bates, 1999) .
