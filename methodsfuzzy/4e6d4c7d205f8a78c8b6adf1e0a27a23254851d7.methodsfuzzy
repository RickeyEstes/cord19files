Cells and virus. Hela and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), penicillin (100 U/ mL), streptomycin (100 g/mL), nonessential amino acids (0.1 mM), and L-glutamine (2 mM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). SeV (Cantell strain) was propagated at 37 °C in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Plasmid constructs. Plasmids of pGL3-IFNβ -luc, pRL-SV40, pEGFP-IRF-3, and pCAGGS were previously described 15 . Plasmids expressing Flag-tagged MDA5C and MDA5H were constructed as previously reported 28 . Plasmids expressing GFP-tagged MAVS, Flag-tagged MDA5, RIG-I, TBK1, and IKKε were previously described 60, 61 . The plasmid expressing HA-tagged IRF7 was a gift from Dong-Yan Jin (Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong). Western blot analysis. The 293T cells were seeded in 12-well dishes and transfected with the indicated plasmids. At 24 h post-transfection (p.t.), the cells were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The lysates were kept on ice for 10 min, centrifuged, and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane (Pall, Port Washington, NY), blocked with 5% skim milk in PBST for 1 h, and probed with the indicated primary antibodies at an appropriate dilution overnight at 4 °C. The following day, the membrane was incubated with the corresponding IRDye 800-labeled IgG secondary antibodies (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE) and scanned using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE). Indirect immunofluorescence assay and confocal microscopy. Hela cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in a 24-well plate and transfected with the indicated expression plasmids using the HD transfection reagent (Promega, Madison). At 24 h p.t., the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, blocked in 5% BSA in PBS, and then probed with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-HA and rabbit anti-flag (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with either goat anti-mouse Ig conjugated with Alexa fluor 405 or goat anti-rabbit Ig conjugated with Alexa fluor 594 at a dilution of 1:500 for 1 h (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) . The cells were then washed and stained with 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to detect nuclei. Fluorescence images were obtained and analyzed using an LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). Immunoprecipitation. Transfected cells were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Lysates of cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal antibodies against HA, Flag, and GFP (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in the presence of protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunocomplexes captured on the protein A/G agarose beads were subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblotting analysis.
