The epidemiological model The model developed in this study is a stochastic compartmental "SLDCRS" model, in which animals of a closed population of constant size (i.e., no birth, removal, or death) may progress through different disease states [susceptible (S), latent infected (L), diseased (D), asymptomatic carrier (C), recovered (R), susceptible (S)] over the time course of infection (Anderson and May 1991) . For animal i in disease state X, a value T X (i) is defined, describing the expected time that animal i spends in category X given progression to X at a previous time step. Infection occurs through environmental contamination, which is quantified by the density of infectious pathogen shed by infected animals in categories D and C into the environment. Each individual has its predefined shedding rates k D (i) and k C (i) associated with the diseased and the carrier state, respectively, which are defined as the number of bacteria shed into the environment per unit area per day. It is assumed that the total amount of infectious pathogens shed by individual animals is cumulative and uniformly dispersed, so that all animals have equal exposure to the pathogens in the contaminated environment. Infectious bacteria are assumed to have a mean survival time in the environment of T B days. The epidemic process is simulated as a Poisson process, i.e., as a series of random events in continuous time that occur independently of one another. The possible event types are the progression of an animal from one disease state to the next (i.e., S / L, L / D, D / C, C / R, and R / S), as well as pathogen shedding by an animal of category D or C, and the decay of environmental pathogens. Both the time between successive events (i.e., the interevent time) and the probability of a specific event to occur are determined by the set of individual transition rates r X ðiÞ 5 1=T X ðiÞ from a state X (X ¼ S, L, D, C, or R) to the next state in the SLDCRS sequence, by the pathogen shedding rates k D (i) and k C (i) and by bacterial decay rates r B ¼ 1/T B as follows: in the population as a whole we define the average rate of infection of susceptible individuals as r 1 5 P i2S r S ðiÞE, where E is the environmental bacterial load, r S ðiÞ 5 1=T S ðiÞ; and the sum is taken over all susceptible individuals. The transition events corresponding to other states (i.e., X ¼ L, D, C, or R) occur at average rates r k 5 P i2X r X ðiÞ, for k ¼ 2, 3, 4, 5, where r X ðiÞ 5 1=T X ðiÞ was defined above. Similarly, shedding occurs at average rates r 6 5 P i2D k D ðiÞ and r 7 5 P i2C k C ðiÞ, respectively, depending on whether bacteria are shed from diseased individuals (D) or asymptomatic carriers (C), and bacterial decay occurs at an average rate r 8 ¼ r B E. Note that event rates change during the time course of the disease outbreak as individuals move between compartments and environmental contamination changes. The simulations of the stochastic model were carried out using Gillespie's direct algorithm (Gillespie 1977) . In short, the interevent times are sampled from an exponential distribution with parameter R 5 P 8 k51 r k (Renshaw 1991) . The specific event type that then occurs is obtained by drawing a random variate from a discrete distribution with probability p(k) ¼ r k /R corresponding to event type k, k ¼ 1-8, as defined above. Once the event type has been chosen, a similar sampling process is applied to determine the affected individual on the basis of its relative rate compared to that of other individuals belonging to the same category. Parameterization of the model for footrot in sheep (benchmark model for homogeneous populations) The model was parameterized for footrot in sheep, with Dichelobacter nodosus bacteria as the primary infectious agent (Egerton 2000) . Various studies have demonstrated that the progress of infection follows that described by a compartmental SLDRCS model (Sinclair 1957; Abott 2000) . In the benchmark model there was no variation between individuals in any of the host-specific epidemiological parameters (T S , T L , T D , T C , T R , k D , and k C ) defined above. Parameter values for the benchmark model were adopted, where possible, from a recent deterministic epidemiological model of footrot (Nieuwhof et al. 2009 ), as listed in Table 1 . There are no estimates of the duration of the asymptotic carrier state in the literature. However, evidence exists that only a small proportion of animals per flock become asymptomatic carriers (Depiazzi et al. 1998) . Since the benchmark model allows only all or no animals to become carriers, a short duration of 1 day was assumed for this state (T C ¼ 1 day). This conservative approach was chosen to prevent overestimation of the influence of asymptomatic carriers on epidemiological characteristics. Footrot prevalence and severity are strongly dependent on environmental conditions affecting bacterial survival (Abbot and Egerton 2003; Conington et al., 2010) . Different environmental conditions were modeled using different values for the bacterial survival time T B (Table 1) .
