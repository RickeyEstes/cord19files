To account for multicollinearity associated with the correlation of diarrhoea caused by different pathogens, a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was performed to obtain an overall view of the associations between the findings for pathogens in faecal samples and the presence of diarrhoea. The idea of the multiple correspondence analysis is to carry out cross-tabulations of multiple categorical variables simultaneously and explore relationships within a set of categorical variables, resulting in two-dimensional scatterplot summary. In the summary, clusters of points are associated with each other, and clusters furthest from the inter-section of the axes have the strongest internal association [27] . Test values were computed for evaluating variables' correlation with model dimensions (axes). The test values were considered to be the standardised coordinates and were interpreted as the number of standard deviations from the centre of gravity of the analysis. Absolute test values higher than the threshold value of 1.96 were considered to be statistically significant. For the MCA, the Cryptosporidium findings from immunofluorescence staining were used. The MCA was conducted with XLSTAT (Version 2010.4.01, Addinsoft) software. The associations between the eimeriosis related signs, the acute phase protein concentrations and clinical signs were examined using a linear mixed model. Based on clinical examination, calves were categorised having the signs of: diarrhoea (pastylike or watery faeces), respiratory infection (temperature >39.5 â€¢ C, respiratory rate >40/min, and increased respiratory sounds), umbilical infection (enlarged, warm or tender umbilicus), joint lesion (swelling, abrasions or heat in the joint or on the skin close to the joint) or healthy (none of the previous conditions applicable). Calves having simultaneously signs of diarrhoea and any other signs were placed into the category of the other sign, considered the primary sign, so each calf had only one condition or was categorised as healthy. The final variable "Signs of diseases" was generated by combining all the individual signs. For forming eimeriosis severity categories three criteria related with Eimeria infection were assessed: presence of diarrhoea, total oocyst count >500 opg in faecal sample and presence of pathogenic Eimeria species (E. bovis or E. zuernii). If no criteria was met no evidence of eimeriosis was recorded (category 1), if one of the criteria was met the evidence of eimeriosis was considered weak (category 2), if two criteria were met the evidence was considered moderate (category 3), and if all three criteria were met the evidence were considered strong (category 4). Associations between severity of eimeriosis and APP concentrations were examined by linear mixed model; separate models were built Hp, SAA, Fb, or WBC as an outcome. Age, gender and "Signs of disease" were added into the models to control their possible effect on acute phase proteins or WBC. "Gender" was removed, if no effect was detected. Each intestinal pathogen (rotavirus, Giardia spp., or Cryptosporidium spp.) was also inserted to the model, but none showed significant results. Herd was included as a random effect in all models. For the model using SAA as an outcome, the variable "positive finding from respiratory tract samples" (yes/no) was added, as the examination of the data showed a possible connection of positive respiratory tract sample and SAA concentration. Inverse transformation for Hp, Fb and WBC and logarithmic transformation for SAA were used in the linear mixed model to normalise the data. The difference of intestinal pathogen frequency over age groups (age in weeks) was tested by Fisher's exact test. The Fisher's exact test, linear modelling and the diagnostics were done using Stata/IC 11.2 for Windows (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). p values <0.05 were considered indicating statistically significant difference.
