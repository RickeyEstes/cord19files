The extraction procedure based on solid-phase clean-up over an MCX cartridge, as described in Section 2.2, was subjected to validation experiments to evaluate the performance characteristics of the method. The results are summarized in Table 3 . As can be seen, the ML-7 signal measured in MRM mode on the MS instrument was linear over a wide range from 1 to 100 ng ml −1 , with r ≥ 0.99 and g ≤ 20%, as required for good linearity in this range. The same was true in the higher range with ML-7 levels ranging from 10 to 2500 ng ml −1 . The accuracy of the analysis method, evaluated on 3 different levels (1, 10 and 100 ng ml −1 , each n = 6) was very good, compared to the allowed tolerances (see Table 3 ). The "within-day" precision (RSD) of the analysis method, evaluated on the same 3 levels, was even excellent, taking into account the RSD max values given by the Horwitz equation (see Table 3 ). The same behaviour was also observed for samples spiked at 10 ng ml −1 (n = 3), but using blanks of different origin and with a different behaviour during extraction (blanks 2 and 3, see Section 2.5), indicating the robustness of the method (see Table 3 ). Also "between-day" results for accuracy and precision, evaluated at 1, 10, and 100 ng ml −1 levels in the lower range, and also at 25, 250 and 2500 ng ml −1 levels in the higher range, for 3 different analysis days, were very satisfactory (see Table 3 ). LOQ was established at 1 ng ml −1 , as the lowest level at which the criteria for accuracy and precision could be fulfilled. LOD was calculated to be 0.38 ng ml −1 , by determining the average S/N of the six 1 ng ml −1 samples used for accuracy and precision evaluation, and using the S/N = 3 criterion. The specificity of the analysis method was guaranteed since no interfering peaks were observed at the retention times of ML-7 and ML-9, for blanks 1 (see Fig. 2 ), 2 and 3. Carry-over was of no concern since no peaks for both ML-7 and ML-9 were measured when a solvent methanol/water (1/1, v/v) mixture was injected immediately after a 2500 ng ml −1 spiked plasma sample. The stability of ML-7 and ML-9 in extracts stored at 15 • C during 24 h was verified, and no decrease in signal of both components was observed during this time period. Recovery of the analysis method was acceptable for both components: 72.1% and 70.4% for ML-7 and ML-9 respectively. More important however is that the method is free of any significant matrix effect, as well for ML-7 as for ML-9, as shown by comparing the area of blank samples spiked after extraction and the area of a standard solution containing the same amount (see Fig. 2 for chromatograms typically obtained for such samples), and this for all 3 blanks tested, despite their different composition and behaviour during extraction (see Section 2.5). The biggest decrease in signal -of about 8% -is observed for ML-7 in combination with blank 1. The method was shown to be of practical use for the determination of ML-7 in plasma samples of cats treated with an ML-7 formulation, either by intravenous or subcutaneous injection or oral administration, to determine concentration versus time profiles necessary for pharmacokinetic evaluation. Such a typical profile obtained for one cat after intravenous administration of ML-7 is shown in Fig. 3 . As can be seen, the compound shows a typical profile for a two-compartmental pharmacokinetic model, indicating a good distribution of ML-7 in the body. The applicability of the method was further evaluated towards to the determination of ML-7 in plasma of other animal species and in human plasma. Therefore, extraction recovery and matrix Table 3 Results of validation experiments for the analysis method with sample extraction and clean-up on MCX cartridge, performed on blank 1, unless specified otherwise on blank 2 and blank 3. effect were evaluated on canine, rabbit, chicken, porcine, bovine, and human plasma. The results are summarized in Table 4 . As can be seen, the method gives extraction recoveries ranging from 67.6 to 81.3% and from 70.3% to 82.2% for ML-7 and ML-9 respectively, for canine, rabbit, chicken, porcine and human plasma, the lowest values corresponding to canine plasma, while the highest recoveries were obtained for human plasma. These recoveries are comparable to the ones found for feline plasma (see Table 3 ). Only for bovine plasma, extraction recovery was significantly lower, close to 40%. This is due to the fact that the pellet after the ultracentrifugation step of the plasma sample after the addition of 100 l 1 N HCl solution was very substantial and with a gelatinous aspect, resulting in a more important loss of analyte during this step, compared to the plasma of other species. However, this lower extraction recovery Table 4 Evaluation of extraction recovery and matrix effect of the analysis method on plasma of other species (canine, rabbit, chicken, porcine and bovine plasma) and human plasma, each determination at n = 3, with ML-7 and ML-9 levels both at 100 ng ml −1 .
