Cell culture. Human lung carcinoma cells (A549) and human embryonic kidney cells (293T) (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmid construction. H1N1pp production. H1N1-1918pp and H1N1-2009pp were produced by transfecting 293T cells with four plasmids: the HA expression plasmid; NA expression plasmid; Gag-pol encoding plasmid; and reporter plasmid. At 72 h post-transfection, H1N1pp was harvested from the supernatant of the transfected cells by filtration through a 45-lm Durapore PVDF membrane filter (Millipore, Ireland) and used for further assays. Infection assay. The pp infection assay was performed as reported previously [12, 13] . The naive H1N1 virus HA0 needs to be matured by TPCK-trypsin cleavage to form its functional subunits HA1 and HA2 [14] ; hence, to explore the best conditions for pp infection, pps were pre-treated with TPCK-trypsin at a final concentration of 0, 2, 40, 80,160, and 400 lg/ml at 37°C for 1 h before infection. A549 cells (5-10 Â 10 3 ) were seeded in a 96-well plate one day prior to infection. The pps were diluted 1:1 in a total volume of 100 ll DMEM. For the infection process, culture medium in the 96-well plate was replaced with the diluted pps, incubated for 4 h, and then replaced with DMEM supplemented with 3% FBS. At 72 h post-infection, the infected cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and GFP reporter positive cells were counted by FACS (BD, FACSAria Franklin lakes NJ). Hemagglutination assay. To determine the hemagglutination activity of the pps, a hemagglutination assay was performed. The pp samples were diluted serially in PBS (by 2-fold from 1 to 1/16) in 96-well plates with 50 ll per well. Then, 50-ll aliquots of 1% chicken red blood cells were added to each well and left to stand for 30 min, and the hemagglutination reaction was observed. Data analysis. Significant differences were evaluated using a two-tailed Fisher's exact test (release 12.1; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.
