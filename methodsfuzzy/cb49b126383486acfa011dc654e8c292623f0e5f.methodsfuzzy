The development and implementation of molecular methods is the single biggest recent advance in the diagnostics of respiratory infections. 4 While nucleic acid detection tests (NATs), such as PCR, have been used to detect respiratory pathogens for over two decades, the widespread adoption of these tests by diagnostic laboratories has occurred only recently, largely due to the increased availability of commercial assays. Table  22 .16 discusses some of the more commonly used molecular assays, and Table 22 .17 gives explanation of commonly used terms in molecular diagnostics. NATs have several advantages over other diagnostic tools, including rapid turnaround time, the ability to detect low levels of all known pathogens, the lack of dependence on the viability of the target microorganism, little influence of antimicrobial therapy on diagnostic sensitivity, and the ability to be automated. 4 NATs may also provide additional information, such as antimicrobial susceptibility data and strain typing. For the diagnosis of respiratory infections, the most widely used NATs are those that detect respiratory viruses and noncolonizing bacteria (e.g., M. pneumoniae, Legionella species, B. pertussis). For these microorganisms, detection in a respiratory sample from a child with a compatible clinical syndrome is regarded as sufficient evidence to assign causation. In contrast, NATs for other bacteria that may also be found in normal respiratory flora, including some of the most important pneumonia pathogens (e.g., S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. aureus), have struggled for a role outside research laboratories. As with culture-based methods, the problem with detection of these targets by NAT is the inability to distinguish colonization and carriage from disease. NATs have particularly revolutionized the diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections, 86, 87 and are now the testing method of choice. Respiratory viruses are now commonly detected by large multiplex panels that typically include influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, human rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, parechovirus, adenoviruses, human bocavirus, and several coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1). There are now many commercial multiplex assays available in a variety of formats, and the landscape is continually changing. In the right clinical context, the detection
