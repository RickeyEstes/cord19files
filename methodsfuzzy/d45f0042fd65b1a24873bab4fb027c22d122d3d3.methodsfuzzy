Virus isolation and purification. Virus isolation from 432 pools of 4,839 female mosquito heads was done with Aedes albopictus (C6/36) cells as described previously (15) . For virus growth kinetics, C6/36 cells were infected with an MOI of 0.1, 0.01, or 0.001 and incubated for 1 h at 28°C. The inoculum was removed, and cells were washed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). L-15 medium was added, and cells were incubated for 48 h. Every 3 h, an aliquot of the cell culture supernatant was removed, RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III RT System (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), and CAVV viral genome copy numbers were quantified by real-time RT-PCR (14) . To obtain pure virus stocks, CAVV was titrated on insect cells and cell culture supernatant was harvested at 22 hpi to allow only single-round infections. Numbers of genome copies were measured by real-time RT-PCR, and the infectious supernatant of the highest dilution still showing virus replication was used for retitration of CAVV on insect cells. This procedure was repeated five times. For purification, CAVV was harvested by freeze-thawing of infected cells. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 20 min, followed by ultracentrifugation through a 36% sucrose cushion at 35,000 rpm (SW40 rotor; Beckman) for 2 h at 4°C. The virus pellet was suspended in 150 l PBS overnight at 4°C. Further purification was achieved on a continuous gradient of 1 to 2 M sucrose in 0.01 M Tris-HCl-4 mM Na-EDTA at 35,000 rpm (SW40 rotor; Beckman) for 22 h at 4°C. Virus-containing fractions were tested by real-time RT-PCR, and fractions with the highest sequence titers were concentrated through a 36% sucrose cushion at 35,000 rpm (SW40 rotor; Beckman) for 2 h at 4°C. The virus pellet was suspended in 150 l PBS buffer overnight at 4°C. Electron microscopy. For electron microscopy, viral particles were purified through a cushion of 36% sucrose and the pellet was suspended in PBS (15, 16) . Viral particles were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy after negative staining with 1% uranyl acetate (62, 63) . For ultrathin sections, infected cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, enclosed in low-melting-point agar, embedded in resin, and evaluated by transmission electron microscopy after ultrathin sectioning. Genome sequencing. RNA extracted from purified virus preparations was used for unbiased high-throughput sequencing and for conventional sequencing approaches. Genome fragments were generated by adaptorbased random RT-PCR. Following protocols described previously (15, 64) , in this specific study, random hexamers linked to a defined primer sequence tail or oligonucleotides that bind to the conserved TRS elements of CoV linked to an oligonucleotide anchor were applied (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Genome characterization and phylogenetic analyses. The nucleotide sequence of the CAVV genome was analyzed for ORFs and translated. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared with other sequences by BLASTn, BLASTx, tBLASTx, and psiBLAST with the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.Nih.gov/Genbank), and protein motifs were identified by web-based comparison to the Pfam database (http: //www.pfam.janelia.org). Identification of cleavage sites for signal peptides was accomplished by using signalP-NN (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk /services/SignalP). Prediction of the hydropathy profile was performed by TMHMM v2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/), and N-linked glycosylation sites were identified using the NetNGlyc 1.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc). RNA folding was modeled by using the Mfold server (http://mfold.bioinfo.rpi.edu/cgi-bin/rna -form1.cgi) (65) . For phylogenetic analysis, CAVV amino acid sequences were aligned with representative sequences of other nidoviruses in MEGA v5.0 (66) . Alignments were optimized according to published crystal structure predictions. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences was conducted by the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm with the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix for distance correction with 1,000 bootstrap replicates in MEGA v5.0. Maximum-likelihood analyses were done with Fasttree selected genomic regions. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the NJ algorithm, a BLOSUM62 substitution matrix, and no distance correction. Indels were fully deleted. Significance was tested by bootstrap analysis using 1,000 resampling steps as implemented in MEGA 5.0 (66) . Bootstrap values are shown above nodes. Analyses were also performed using the maximumlikelihood algorithm in FastML with the same settings. Results of this analysis are not shown because of congruent topologies. Bootstrap support values (1,000 replicates) from maximum-likelihood analysis are shown in grey below nodes. (67) , and tree files were displayed in MEGA versus 5.0. Evolutionary divergence over sequence pairs was estimated in MEGA versus 5.0. Identification of subgenomic mRNAs. For Northern blotting, the Northern Blot Starter Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was used. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probes were generated by PCR using the primers shown in Fig. 4B and listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Total RNA of isolate CAVV/C79/CI/2004 was extracted with the Qiagen RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) from C6/36 cells at 24 hpi. RNA was separated on a 2% formaldehyde-1.5% agarose gel, blotted onto a nylon membrane (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and hybridized with the CAVV-specific, DIG-labeled probes. RNAs were analyzed by chemiluminescence using 1:10,000 anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase Fab fragments and 1:100 CDP-Star reagent (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).
