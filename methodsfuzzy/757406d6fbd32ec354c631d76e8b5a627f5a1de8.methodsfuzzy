NA amplification can be either analyzed after the reaction is completed (endpoint detection) or while the reaction is progressing (real-time detection). Endpoint detection requires less complex instrumentation and provides simpler outputs for interpretation. Real-time methods integrate amplification with detection and are superior for quantitative analyte detection having a larger dynamic range. Alternative methods are developed for NA amplification detection, such as optical, mechanical, chemical, electrochemical, and nanomaterialsbased detection. Fluorescence detection is the most popular optical detection strategy in biosensing caused by the advantages of sensitivity and selectivity, was developed in an integrated low cost unit . Fluorescence detection performed by fluorescent probes or beacons, and intercalating fluorescence dye, could be utilized for both real-time and endpoint detection. An integrated real-time fluorescence hand-held system was first developed to perform a detection of RNA of H5N1 avian influenza virus using real-time RT-PCR (Neuzil et al., 2010) , later on upgraded into a palm-size device employed for detect the RNA of Ebola virus (Ahrberg et al., 2016b) . Both systems utilized light-emitting diodes with a principal wavelength of �490 nm to excite the fluorophore and photodiodes to detect the emission. The output signal from the photodiodes was processed by a lock-in amplifier to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. This handheld device (Fig. 5A ) was further applied to provide an internet of things platform for infection disease diagnosis verified by DENV (Zhu et al., 2020) . A similar platform was also developed as a modular system (Neuzil et al., 2014) capable to perform both time and space domain PCR for NA, localized surface plasmon resonance for protein detection (Neuzil and Reboud, 2008) , electrochemical sensing using an array of two electrode systems and also using nanowires as biosensors. The endpoint fluorescence detection is mostly utilized in a continuous-flow as well as in digital PCR (or LAMP) systems. The results are only captured and analyzed once the sample amplification process is complete. A digital microfluidic NA sequence-based amplification (NASBA) chip (Fig. 5B ) with a self-digitization sample loaded in vacuum was used to quantify HIV RNA (Wang et al., 2018a) . The detection of the amplification result was performed by capturing and analyzing the fluorescence images with calcein added in the NASBA mixture to generate a fluorescent signal. Visual detection, also named colorimetric detection, based on color changes under ambient light during amplification causing by chemical additives, such as hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB), calcein, and spatial nanoparticles, is the most promising detection means for POC applications. HNB is one of several metal ion indicators serving as a visual dye for the LAMP technique and changing from its original violet to sky blue after the LAMP reaction caused by a decrease in the magnesium ion concentration. A mixed dye of HNB and calcein was utilized to show the color change during LAMP for H1N1 virus (Fig. 5C) . The amplification result with the mixed dye could be detected by integrated real-time color sensors with higher precision. A system utilizes the sediment of DNA amplicons by spermine and flocculation of a mix of charcoal and diatomaceous earth particles in suspension for visual detection (Mason and Botella, 2019) . The initial charcoal particles suspension is a black, non-transparent colloid solution without any precipitation. In positive samples in which DNA amplification has occurred, the particles flocculate and settle, leaving a transparent liquid phase distinguishable with the naked eye. The separation-based detection of an NA amplification product is always an endpoint type. A typical example is an electrophoresis, which was for years the most popular PCR detection technique. Its capillary (CE) version conducted in a commercially available microfluidic chip is suitable for NA separation and detection due to sufficient resolution and operation convenience. A microchip-based CE (Fig. 5D ) was integrated with NASBA for HPV detection (Liu et al., 2015) . The sample was loaded and separated into individual NAs based on their lengths by applied a sequence of specific voltages delivered to the solution by four Pt electrodes. This CE integration with the amplification chip has a high throughput and a short analysis time, but it requires external high voltage sources with an amplitude of 1500 V or more. The detection performed on an LFS is based on NA hybridization and antigen-antibody reactions, providing rapid and sensitive detection for multiplex detection of DNA and antigens/antibodies. The nanoparticles with ssDNA detector probe are typically prepared and assembled on the LFS membrane. The target DNAs bind to the immobilized probe producing a color change observable with the naked eye. A fully integrated paper-based LAMP device with an LFS layer (Fig. 5E ) was utilized to detect DENV (Choi et al., 2016) . They immobilized gold nanoparticles and detect probe conjugates on a nitrocellulose membrane for the LFS layer to capture target amplicons. After amplification, the nanoparticles-probe conjugates would then hybridize with the LAMP products in the test zone forming a visible red signal expending 15 min at room temperature.

(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.) Electrochemical detection for NA amplification product is based on hydrogen ions released during nucleic acid replication detected in realtime by an ion sensor, which also resulted in a pH value change of the solution . The pH value change is not obviously caused by the solution condition and small volume. A designed detection probe was utilized in a 200 μL reaction tube to detect HCV using RT-LAMP by monitoring hydrogen ions concentration change (Fig. 5F ). The probe comprises an ion sensitive field effect transistor, a micro-capillary based Ag/AgCl/KCl reference electrode and a temperature sensor (Jogezai and Shabbir, 2018) . The electrical conductivity of the solution is also one parameter for the NA amplification test of the electrochemical method. The sample electrical conductivity is influenced by accumulate non-precipitated magnesium pyrophosphate and protons due to the consumption of primers and dNTPs during amplification process. A cellulose paper with printed graphene-modified silver electrodes (Fig. 5G) was used for the electrical conductivity measurement integrated with LAMP for HIV detection (Safavieh et al., 2017) . The reduction in the sample electrical conductivity is correlated to the concentration of the target nucleic acid resulting in both qualitative and quantitative detection.
