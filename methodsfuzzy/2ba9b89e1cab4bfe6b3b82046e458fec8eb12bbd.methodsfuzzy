The following primary monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) were used to detect junctional and signaling proteins by immunofluorescence labeling and immunoblotting: anti-occludin, anti-ZO-1, and anti-E-cadherin mAb (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA); anti-Î²-catenin mAb (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA), Anti-claudin 1 and 4 pAbs (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-cortactin mAb (p80/85 clone 4F11, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), anti-cortactin pAb (H222), anti-phospho-CREB (Ser133; 87G3) rabbit mAb, and anti-CREB (48H2) rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA), anti-GAPDH mAb (6C5, Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Fluorescently labeled phalloidin 488 (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) was used to visualize actin filaments. Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-488 or Alexa-568 dyes were obtained from Thermo-Fisher Scientific. Mouse and rabbit secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies were purchased from GE Healthcare (Pittsburgh, PA).
