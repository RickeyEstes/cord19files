CeuS and virus. The A59 strain of MHV was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Virus was propagated and plaqued on the L-2 strain (Rothfels Measurement of [3HJuridine incorporation into irlfected cells. Confluent cultures of L-Z cells in 35-mm petri dishes were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5 and incubated at 37" in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) and containing actinomycin D (1 pg/ml). At intervals, medium was replaced with 0.5 ml of MEM containing actinomycin D and [5-3H]uridine (15 &i/ml). After 30 min incubation at 37" the cell monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the cells lysed with 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). After the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid to cell lysates, RNA was trapped by filtration through Whatman 3MM filter disks and the radioactivity determined by scintillation spectrometry. Isolation of 32P-labeled iqfected cell RNA for fomzamide gel electrophoresis. For large-scale preparation of infected cell RNA, seventy-five lOO-mm petri dishes of confluent L-2 cells were inoculated at a m.o.i. of approximately 2 and subsequently incubated at 37" in MEM supplemented with 5% FCS and containing actinomycin D (1 pg/ml). At 3.5 hr postinoculation (PI) the medium in five petri dishes was replaced with phosphate-free medium containing actinomycin D and [32P]phosphate (800 &i/ml). At 8.5 hr PI, at which time the infected cell monolayers were completely fused, medium was removed from all '75 dishes and the cells washed once with PBS. Cells were scraped with a rubber policeman in a total of 36 ml RSB (10 mM Tris, 10 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgC12, pH 7.4) and extracted with chloroform/ phenol/isoamyl alcohol according to the procedure of Rose and Knipe (1975) . RNA was recovered from the aqueous phase by the addition of 2 vol of ethanol and centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 g. Prior to formamide gel electrophoresis RNA was poly(A) selected by passage through oligo(dT)-cellulose (see below). Isolation of RNA for hybridization and trader procedures. Cellular RNA was prepared according to the procedure of Strohman et al. (1977) as modified by Dr. G. Mackie (Department of Biochemistry, University of Western Ontario). Briefly, cell monolayers were washed with PBS, scraped into a solution of 7.6 Mguanidine-HCl, 0.1 M potassium acetate, pH 7.5, and homogenized with a glass dounce in a bath of salt-ice. After addition of 0.6 vol of 95% ethanol and cooling for several hours at -2O", the mixture was spun at 3000 g for 10 min. The pellet was taken up in buffer containing 7.6 M guanidine-HCl, 0.02 M EDTA, and gently vortexed at room temperature. After addition of 2 M potassium acetate, pH 5, to a final concentration of 0.1 M, ethanol (0.5 vol) was added and the mixture centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min. The pellet was dissolved in 20 mM EDTA, pH 7, and extracted at room temperature with 3 vol of chloroform/butanol (4:1, v/ v). The aqueous phase was combined with two additional aqueous washings of the organic phase and made 3 M in sodium acetate, pH 6. After cooling at -2O", the mixture was centrifuged at 8700 g for 60 min to yield an RNA pellet which was subsequently precipitated twice from ethanol. Oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. Ethanol-precipitated RNA was dissolved in application buffer (10 mM Tris, 0.5 M KCl, pH 7.5) and applied to a column of oligo(dT)-cellulose (0.5 g, Collaborative Research, Inc.). Stepwise elution with decreasing concentration of KC1 was performed according to Aviv and Leder (1972) . Fractions containing "unbound" (eluted with 0.5 M KC1 buffer) and "bound" (eluted with KCl-free buffer) RNA were diluted with 2 vol of ethanol. Precipitated RNA was recovered by centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 g. Formamide-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RNA samples dissolved in formamide-glycerol sample buffer (Duesberg and Vogt, 1973) were carefully applied to formamide-filled wells of a slab gel containing 3.5% acrylamide in formamide (Duesberg and Vogt, 1973) . Electrophoresis was performed for 20 hr at 100 V. Gels were enclosed in Saran Wrap, frozen to facilitate subsequent manipulation, and autoradiographed for several hours at -70". Recovery of %P-labeled RNA from fmamide gels. Using an autoradiogram as template, 32P-containing RNA bands were excised from the gel, macerated through an l&gauge syringe needle, and eluted with extraction buffer (10 mM Tris, 0.4 ikf sodium acetate, 0.02% SDS, pH 7.4; Rose and Knipe, 1975) . Eluted RNA was freed from minute gel debris by centrifugation at 10,000 Q for 10 min, precipitated by addition of 2 vol of ethanol, and recovered by centrifugation for 3 hr at 100,000 g. Recovered RNA was re-poly(A) selected by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography as described above. Preparation of complementa?-y DNA. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized, using the procedure of Shank et a2. (1978) , in the presence of actinomycin D, calf thymus DNA primers, purified AMV polymerase (supplied by Dr. J. Beard and the Office of Program Resources and Logistics, National Cancer Institute) and [32P]dCTP (Amersham, 400 Ci/mmol). The cDNA product was isolated according to the procedure of Cohen et a2. (1979) . Before use the cDNA was annealed (0.6 M NaCl, 68') with 500 pg of uninfected L cell RNA to a C,t of 230. The annealing mixture was then made 0.12 M in phosphate buffer and the single-stranded sequences were eluted from a hydroxyapatite column at 60" with 0.12 M phosphate buffer; the doublestranded sequences were then eluted from the column at 60" with 0.4 M phosphate buffer (Morris et al., 1977) . The fractions containing the single-stranded [32P]cDNA (approximately 80% of the total radioactivity applied) were collected, pooled, and used for the subsequent experiments. Complementary DNA made with this technique has been shown to be representative of most, if not all, of a viral RNA by its ability to detect all the restriction endonuclease fragments of viral DNA with an efficiency equal to that of iodinated viral RNA (Ringold et aZ.,'1978) . Hybridixaticm kinetic experiments. Hybridization was performed using the procedure of Varmus et al., (1973) . Hybridization mixtures contained 1150 cpm [32P]cDNA per 15-~1 aliquot, excess unlabeled RNA, and 0.6 M NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 40 miW Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Reactions were incubated at 68" under mineral oil in plas-tic tubes. Aliquots were removed and the percentage of single-stranded cDNA was determined using Sl nuclease (Calbiochem), which specifically digests singlestranded DNA, using the conditions of Leong et al. (1972) . Analysis using gel electrophoresis and RNA trader procedures. RNA was denatured with glyoxal, subjected to electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels, transferred to diazobenzyloxymethyl (DBM) paper, and hybridized with [32P]cDNA using a modification of the technique of McMaster and Carmichael (1977) and Alwine et al. (1977) as described in Coulter-Mackie et al. (1980) . The [%P]cDNA used in these experiments was preannealed (0.6 M NaCl, 68') with 500 pg of uninfected L cell RNA to a CJ of 150. The A59 virus-specific RNA species were visualized by autoradiography (Swanstrom and Shank, 1978) . DNA extraction and hybridization. Uninfected L cells were resuspended in 0.02 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.01 M EDTA (pH 7). After incubating this suspension with Pronase (1 mg/ml, self-digested for 2 hr at 37") and 1% SDS overnight, the aqueous phase was extracted three times with phenol-chloroform (1:l). The DNA was then dialyzed extensively against 0.05 M Tris-HCL (pH 7.2), 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7). The solution was adjusted to 0.3 M NaOH, heated to 100" for 20 min, and quick-cooled in ice. After neutralization, the DNA was precipitated with ethanol at -2O", centrifuged at 16,300 g, and resuspended in 3 mM EDTA (pH 7). The DNA was then annealed with r2P]cDNA as described by Morris et al. (1977) except cell DNA was 6.1 mg/ml in the annealing mix instead of 3.5 mg/ml. Single-stranded DNA was assayed with Sl nuclease as previously described (Leong et al., 1972) . Cell-free protein synthesis. RNA was preparatively isolated from formamidepolyacrylamide gels as described above. Preparation of micrococcal nuclease-pretreated rabbit reticulocyte lysates and conditions for cell-free protein synthesis were essentially as described by Pelham and Jackson (1976) . Following incubation, samples were prepared for electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels (Laemmli, 1970) by treatment of the incubation mixtures (25 ~1) with RNase A (final concentration, 4 pg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature followed by the addition of 25 ~1 dissociation buffer (7 mM Tris-phosphate, pH 6.8, 3.46 M mercaptoethanol, 30% glycerol, 6% SDS, and 0.006% bromphenol blue). Gels were dried and fluorographed according to the procedure of Bonner and Laskey (1974) .
