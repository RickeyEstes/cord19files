Briefly, an SD model describes the information, structural boundaries, strategies, and action delay inside the system structure through a feedback process. A quantitative simulation is performed to study the dynamic behavior of the interaction of interrelated components inside the system structure. The SD model analyzes a complex system with multiple variables that change over time and determines how the system is affected by the implementation of specific policies [62] . In addition, Kummerow [63] revealed that the SD model not only relatively easily incorporates qualitative mental and written information as well as quantitative data but also can be used when the database is insufficient to support statistical forecasting analysis. Thus, the SD model is an appropriate approach to display the inherent behavior and influences inside the system structure despite multidirectional dynamic interactions and the fact that life is infinitely more complicated and difficult than we can effectively simulate [21, 27, 37, 38, 53, 39] . Although an SD model is an appropriate approach to simulate a complex and multidirectional dynamic system by constructing mathematic functions, it is a subjective and time-consuming operation. The causal relationships of the SD model are based on the subjective judgment of the operator, reference suggestions, data availability, and information acquisition. Thus, the simulation result will change if the operator adopts different stock and flow variables. In addition, error analysis based on historical statistical data should be evaluated to ensure that the forecasted results are accurate and efficient and that the causal relationships used are reasonable. An SD model contains two parts. The first part is a causal-loop diagram that describes an idea, both conceptually and as a set of simplified cause-effect relationships between the different systems developed during model construction. The second part is a stock-flow diagram that represents the quantitative relationships among variables. A more detailed description follows.
