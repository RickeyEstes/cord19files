Candidate assay targets of highly conserved genomic regions for the eleven agents of interest were identified and chosen on the basis of published validation data, reporting used successfully as PCR targets. To avoid the false-negative results, two targets of each agent were used in the STI-MS method. Human ฮฒ-globin (HBB) gene was selected for internal control. Therefore, we developed a 23-plex method to identify eight etiological agents related to the STIs and other three controversial organisms in this study. The NCBI GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/genbank/) was used to download all available full and partial nucleic acid sequences for each target. Primer pairs of multiplex PCR and extension probes were designed using Assay Design 4.1 software (Agena Bioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), and their specificity was confirmed by primer and nucleotide blast tools (NCBI, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/). Every PCR primer included a 5สน universal 10-mer tag (5สน-ACGTTGGATG-3สน) to increase the molecular weight. PCR primers and extension probes were obtained from Tsingke Biotechnology (Beijing, China). The final targeting regions and the primers/probes of the STI-MS assay were listed in Table S1 in the supplementary material.  In this study, we developed and tested a 23-plex method that targets eleven different etiological agents simultaneously and can identify the most common pathogens related to STIs, using HBB as an internal control. After nucleic acid extraction of samples, the first step of STI-MS assay was multiplex PCR using specific primers and probes that amplify highly conserved regions of the microbial genome. The second step of STI-MS assay involved the detection of specific products by using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer system, in which the mass of each product was measured. The microorganism(s) in the specimen were determined by observing the base composition of the observed. To avoid false-negative results, two targets of each agent were used in the STI-MS assay. The results of the nucleotide BLASTN analysis showed that all tested primers and probes worked well. Our results revealed that the developed STI-MS method had satisfactory analytical specificity and multiplex detection capacity for target organisms.
