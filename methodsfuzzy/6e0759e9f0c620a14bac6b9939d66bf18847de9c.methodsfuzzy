All cell lines have been authenticated by IDEXX BioResearch, Columbia, MO. HPV16 pseudovirion preparation, labeling, and quality controls. HPV16-PsVs encapsidating the luciferase reporter gene plasmid pGL3-control (Promega) were produced in 293TT cells by cotransfection with plasmid pXULL, which encodes codon-optimized HPV16 L1 and L2, by following published procedures (67, 70) . Where indicated, the virions were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 succinimidyl ester (AF488; Life Technologies) before purification by CsCl density gradient centrifugation as described previously (30) . To assess the purity of the virus stock, the purified preparations of HPV16-PsVs were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent silver staining using a Pierce silver stain kit (Thermo Scientific). The protein content of the HPV16-PsV stock was quantified with a Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Furin-precleaved pseudovirions were produced after CsCl gradient centrifugation by incubation of approximately 1 g of HPV16-PsVs with 1 U of recombinant human furin (Sigma) at 37°C for 16 to 20 h in the presence of 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mM CaCl 2 . Neutralization assays were performed by incubation of the HPV16-PsVs with the neutralizing antibody H16.V5 (positive control) or H18.J4 (negative control) at a final concentration of 1:1,000 for 1 h at 4°C (70) . Neutralized HPV16-PsVs were then added to the cells, and infectivity was measured as luciferase activity as described below. Negative-stain electron microscopy. Both uncleaved and FPC HPV16-PsVs at a final concentration of 0.1 g/l were prepared for electron microscopy by washing in HSB buffer (25 mM HEPES [pH 5.7], 0.5 M NaCl, 0.02% Brij 58, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 100 M EDTA, 0.5% ethanol) and purification through an Amicon Ultra-4 filter device (100,000-kDa molecular mass cutoff). A 3-l drop of sample solution was then adsorbed to a glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid (Agar Scientific) for 30 s, washed with 2 drops of deionized water, and stained with 2 drops of 2% aqueous uranyl acetate (SPI Supplies). The air-dried grid was then viewed with a Philips Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope equipped with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV. Imaging was done with a Gatan US 4000 4kX4k charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera using the Digital Micrograph software suite. Pseudovirus binding and internalization assay. For monitoring HPV16-PsV attachment and uptake, pgsD677, HeLa, HaCaT, and NIKS cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 ϫ 10 5 per well and grown overnight unless otherwise specified for HeLa and NIKS cells (see "Transfection assays" below). AF488-labeled HPV16-PsVs (with or without prior furin treatment as indicated) were added to the cells at a density of approximately 4 pg/cell for 1 h at 4°C to synchronize virus attachment and to study viral binding. For virus binding assays, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and either prepared for confocal microscopy (see below) or lifted with 4 mg/ml of lidocaine hydrochloride (Sigma) in PBS supplemented with 10 mM EDTA. For internalization assays, cells were shifted to 37°C for 30 min unless otherwise indicated. Where indicated, virions were incubated with recombinant human vimentin protein (rhVim; Peprotech) or bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) for 1 h at 4°C before addition to the cells at a final protein concentration of 20 g/ml. Cells were rinsed with PBS and lifted with 0.025% trypsin-0.01% EDTA in PBS to remove surface-bound virions, thereby allowing detection of internalized AF488-labeled viral particles by flow cytometry. Cells were washed in fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) wash solution (0.5% BSA in PBS) and fixed with 1% (vol/vol) formaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS. The detection of AF488-positive cells was performed using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) together with the software CellQuest Pro. Quadrant statistics of three independent experiments performed in triplicate were used to calculate the means Ϯ standard errors of the means (SEM), with the Student t test used for determination of statistical significance compared to controls. Pseudovirus infection assay. For infections which were monitored by expression of the pseudoviral luciferase reporter gene, pgsD677, HeLa, HaCaT, and NIKS cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 5 ϫ 10 4 per well and grown overnight unless otherwise specified for HeLa and NIKS cells (see "Transfection assays" below). Furin-precleaved or uncleaved HPV16-PsVs were then added at a density of approximately 2 pg/cell at 37°C for 48 h, after which cells were washed with PBS and harvested and luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay system kit (Promega) with the Fluoroscan Ascent FL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For assays of vimentin overexpression in HeLa and NIKS cells (see "Transfection assays" below), both adherent and floating cells from the supernatant were harvested and analyzed for luciferase activity. Raw luciferase data (relative light units [RLU]) were normalized against the total protein concentration of the lysates, determined with the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Data are presented as percentage of infection relative to control infections, which were set as 100% or 1, respectively. IP and Western blot analysis. To isolate surface proteins that interact with FPC HPV16-PsVs, pgsD677 cells were grown to 80% confluence in T175 flasks, detached using lidocaine hydrochloride-EDTA in order to maintain surface protein expression, and incubated in 2 ml of complete Ham's F-12 K medium with 1 g of furin-precleaved HPV16-PsVs per 40 g of total protein for 1 to 2 h at 4°C to allow particle binding but not internalization. Cells were then lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using the HPV16-L1-specific antibody CamVir1 (Abcam) together with the Pierce coimmunoprecipitation kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions ( Fig. 2A) . Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, visualized by silver staining using the Pierce silver stain kit (Thermo Scientific), and compared to appropriate control IPs as indicated. Individual protein bands specific to FPC HPV16-PsV interaction were determined visually, excised from the gel, and further processed for analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry at the Centre for Proteomic & Genomic Research (CPGR; Cape Town, South Africa). Proteins were identified from the mass spectrometry data using the Matrix Science database and searching the NCBI database. Pulldown experiments were also performed in a cell-free context using 1 g of HPV16-PsVs (with or without furin pretreatment) per 10 g of immobilized recombinant human vimentin protein (Peprotech) together with the Pierce coimmunoprecipitation kit (Thermo Scientific). For Western blots of either total proteins or immunoprecipitated proteins from cell lysates, 10 g of total protein or 10 g of input (IN) and unbound (flowthrough [FT]) sample as well as the eluate (Elu) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent transfer to nitrocellulose membranes according to conventional protocols. When purified proteins were used in immunoprecipitation experiments, 0.1 g of each IN and FT sample as well as the eluate was loaded onto the gels. Proteins were detected using the antibodies CamVir1 (Abcam) against the HPV16-L1 protein as well as the antivimentin antibodies H84 and V9 (Santa Cruz) as indicated. Flow cytometry. Analysis of total as well as cell surface vimentin expression was performed by flow cytometry as previously described (71) . Briefly, pgsD677, HeLa, HaCaT, and NIKS cells were cultured in 6-well plates at a density of 2 ϫ 10 5 per well and grown overnight unless otherwise specified for HeLa and NIKS cells (see "Transfection assays" below). Cells were incubated with approximately 4 pg/cell of HPV16-PsVs (with or without prior furin treatment) where indicated and lifted with 4 mg/ml of lidocaine hydrochloride (Sigma) in PBS supplemented with 10 mM EDTA and fixed with 1% (vol/vol) formaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS followed by blocking with 5% BSA (Sigma) in PBS containing 0.5% saponin (Sigma) to permeabilize cells (total vimentin expression) or not (surface vimentin expression). Rabbit antivimentin H84 antibody (Santa Cruz) together with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) was used to detect total vimentin or surface vimentin expression relative to controls. Analysis was done on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) together with the software CellQuest Pro. Quadrant statistics of three independent experiments performed in triplicate were used to calculate the means Ϯ standard deviations (SD), with the Student t test used for determination of statistical significance compared to controls. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. pgsD677, HeLa, HaCaT, and NIKS cells were seeded on 10-mm sterile glass coverslips at a density of 1 ϫ 10 5 per well in 12-well plates and grown overnight at 37°C. For cell surface labeling and colocalization experiments, 5.5 pg of AF488-labeled FPC HPV16-PsVs per cell was added and allowed to bind to cells for 1 h at 4°C, then rinsed with cold culture medium, and incubated with a goat antivimentin polyclonal antibody (Sigma; V4630; dilution of 1:100 in culture medium) for 1 h at 4°C. Cells were then rinsed with cold PBS and fixed with 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS, and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS (blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature before being stained with a Cy3conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.; 1:1,000 in blocking solution) for 90 min at room temperature. Cells were then counterstained with Hoechst (Sigma; 1:2,000 in PBS), washed in PBS, and mounted on glass slides with Mowiol. Slides were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 880 Airyscan confocal microscope. Colocalization analysis was performed using Zen 2012 imaging software for each optical section in z-stacks of individual cells. Colocalized pixels derived from analysis of the three-dimensional (3D) data sets were then superimposed on maximum-intensity projections of cells for display. Quantification of colocalization was performed on approximately 50 cells (derived from 2 independent experiments) for each experimental condition tested, using the built-in colocalization function in the ZEN 2012 software. Colocalization coefficients for the fluorescence channels representing Cy3-labeled vimentin and AF488-labeled FPC HPV16-PsVs, respectively, as well as overlap coefficients were determined according to the method of Manders et al. (72) . Transfection assays. To alter protein expression, vimentin was either knocked down or overexpressed in HeLa and NIKS cells by means of transient transfection. For knockdown experiments, 1 ϫ 10 5 cells per well of a 6-well plate were reverse transfected with 100 nM (unless otherwise indicated) predesigned small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides against human vimentin (Silencer Select; Life Technologies) or 100 nM scrambled nontargeting control siRNA (Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To overexpress vimentin, HeLa and NIKS cells at a density of 1 ϫ 10 5 per well of a 6-well plate were reverse transfected with 1 g (unless otherwise indicated) of human vimentin cDNA cloned into pCMV3 (Sino Biological Inc.) using TransFectin lipid reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Seventy-two hours posttransfection (for knockdown experiments) or 14 h posttransfection (for overexpression experiments), cells were analyzed for total vimentin expression by Western blotting or assessed for vimentin surface expression by flow cytometry, respectively. Moreover, transfected cells were infected with AF488-HPV16-PsVs (with or without prior furin treatment) to determine binding and infectious internalization by flow cytometry and luciferase infection assay.
