This retrospective cross-sectional study evaluated immunocompromised patients with radiographic evidence [3] . Neutropenia severity was categorized based on absolute neutrophil count from mild (1000-1499 per microliter), moderate (500-999 per microliter) and severe (< 500 per microliter). Exclusion criteria comprised BAL performed in an ICU setting on mechanically ventilated patients, due to differences in procedure such as bronchoscope intubation via an endotracheal tube. Prognosis is also different and poor when the patient has progressed to respiratory failure [1] . Patients who underwent transbronchial lung biopsies or other forms of bronchoscopic sampling were also excluded to avoid introduction of confounding factors. Data was extracted from a bronchoscopy database that prospectively collects, via endoscopists' reports, all bronchoscopy details performed at the hospital endoscopy centre. This ensured integrity and completeness of data collection over the study period. Data was rendered non-identifiable with removal of patient's name, identification card number and date of procedure. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were interpreted by a radiologist and consultant pulmonologist and the predominant abnormalities characterized according to the following categories: consolidation, ground glass opacities, tree-in-bud appearance, reticular infiltrates, nodular infiltrates and cavitation. Institutional review board approval was obtained (SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board, reference number: 2011/350/C) and ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is NCT01374542. Waiver of consent was provided by SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board.
