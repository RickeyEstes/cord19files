Immunohistochemical staining of paraformaldehyde-fixed sections was performed with monoclonal antibodies listed in Table 1 . Sections were incubated for 1-2 h at room temperature with the primary antibodies applied in optimal or serial dilutions, and the binding sites were visualized using the avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase method (Vectastain ABC-Kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.) with 3,Ydiaminobenzidine (DAB)-H20 2 as a substrate medium. Double-irmnunofluorescence studies were carried out on fresh-frozen tissue sections using monoclonal antibodies directed against monomorphic determinants of MHC class I antigens (OX-18) and the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a well-defined astrocytic marker (Bignami et al., 1972) , as well as the microglia-binding lectin from Griffonia simplicifolia (GSA I-B4). Sections were first incubated with OX-18 antibody, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG-rhodamine conjugate (Sigma, 1 : 60), and then with rabbit anti-GFAP followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein conjugate (Sigma, 1 : 60), or GSA I-B4-fluorescein conjugate (Sigma, 10 /~g/ml in PBS+ 0.1~ Triton X-100 containing 0.1 mM CaCI 2, MgCI 2, and MnC12). Immunohistochemical controls consisted of (a) replacing the primary antibody with PBS and carrying out the staining sequence, (b) substituting the primary antibody with another antibody of the same IgG subclass, and (c) using a secondary biotinylated antibody directed against immunoglobulins from a species other than the one in which the primary antibodies were raised.
