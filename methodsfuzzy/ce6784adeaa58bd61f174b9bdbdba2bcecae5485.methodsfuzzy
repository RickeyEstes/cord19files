The details of sample preparation, cryo-EM imaging, and data processing were described previously [4] . In order to confirm that the majority of cypovirus particles were in transcriptional state, we designed two reaction mixtures with different concentrations of GTP, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h, respectively. The first transcription reaction mixture consisted of 70 mM Tris-Ac (pH 8), 10 mM MgAc 2 , 100 mM NaAc, 4 mM ATP, 2 mM CTP, 2 mM GTP, 2 mM UTP, 20 μCi [α-32 P]UTP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mM), 1 mM SAM, 1 U/μL RNase inhibitor, and purified cypovirus suspension. At 31°C, a 6-h incubation time of this mixture resulted in darker RNA bands (Fig. S9, lane 6 ) than 3-h (Fig. S9, lane 3 ) and 1-h (Fig.  S9, lane 2) incubation times, indicating that the reaction continued after 3 h. In the second reaction mixture, the concentration of GTP was decreased to 0.04 mM (the other conditions were identical with those of the first mixture). Different incubation times of this mixture resulted in similar RNA bands (Fig. S9, lanes 1, 5, and 7) . We attributed it to the fact that the concentration of GTP was so low that it was exhausted by transcription within 1 h. No band was observed in lane 4 as the mixture did not contain GTP (Fig. S9 ). From these results, we concluded that cypovirus transcription had occurred, and after 3 h, the majority of the cypovirus particles were still actively transcribing RNA. The transcribing cypovirus particles in the first mixture incubated at 31°C for 3 h were used for cryo-EM analysis. We collected 3720 micrographs by CCD (Gatan UltraScan4000 model 895) with an FEI 300-kV Titan Krios electron microscope. Approximately 31,000 particle images were selected from 56,000 particle images and included in the final threedimensional reconstruction. The orientations and centers of all particle images were determined using an unpublished new software that uses common-line algorithm, as well as message passing interface and open multi-processing parallel technologies. The three-dimensional reconstruction was computed using ISAF algorithm [23] , which has been enhanced by fast Fourier-spherical Bessel transformation and parallel computation. The resolution of the reconstruction was estimated by Fourier shell correlation criterion [24] . The atomic model of VP3 was built based on density map using Coot [25] and then was refined using Rosetta [26] . Density maps of protein subunits were segmented from the capsid density map and visualized using UCSF Chimera [27] .
