Virus rSARS-CoV and rSARS-CoV-DE were rescued from infectious cDNA clones as previously described [26, 101] . rSARS-CoV-DE was passaged 16 times in Vero E6 cells and characterized in vitro and in vivo (rSARS-CoV-DE-P16) [56] . Remarkably, only a single mutation, at position 23312, which resulted in a serine to phenylalanine mutation in the gene S, was detected in the rSARS-CoV-DE passaged 16 times [56] . All work with infectious
