From 2003 through 2009, six community-wide health care utilization surveys were conducted at two sites in each of the three countries: Guatemala, Kenya and Thailand (Fig. 1) . Findings from several of these surveys have been published [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . In Guatemala one survey was conducted in the Department of Santa Rosa (pop. 308,522; 14% <5 years old), located in the southeastern part of the country, while the second survey was conducted in Quetzaltenango (pop. 705,301; 14% <5 years old), located in western Guatemala. The two Thailand sites were based in the agrarian, rural provinces of Sa Kaeo (pop. 509,337; 7% <5 years old), in eastern Thailand, and Nakhon Phanom (pop. 715,549; 8% <5 years old), located in the Northeast. The Kenyan sites included Kibera, an urban slum in Nairobi (Gatwikira and Soweto villages, pop. 29,015; 15% <5 years old), and Rarieda (formerly known as Bondo), a rural district in western Kenya (pop. 24,000; 15% <5 years old). Persons of all ages were included in the community surveys except those in Kenya, which were restricted to members of households with at least one child aged <5 years. The case definition of pneumonia used in the surveys was adapted from the World Health Organization (WHO) verbal autopsy report for severe pneumonia in children, using questions that were moderately sensitive and specific for pneumonia [9] . In Guatemala and Thailand, pneumonia was defined as self-reported cough and difficulty breathing for P2 days or diagnosis of pneumonia by a health care provider during the past 12 months. In Kenya, pneumonia was de-fined as cough and difficulty breathing for >2 days (Rarieda) or >5 days (Kibera) or diagnosis of pneumonia by a health care provider in the past 12 months, excluding the past two weeks. The rationale stated for excluding respiratory illness during the two weeks prior to interview was the hypothesis that respiratory illness episodes in the past two weeks were more likely to be reported and magnified in severity because they were still fresh in the minds of the respondents [10] . The method for selecting households in which to conduct the surveys was based on the cluster survey approach used to estimate community immunization coverage and adapted for each survey site [11] . In Kenya, a one-stage cluster sampling approach was used. Villages were selected using probability proportional to size sampling, and all households with a child aged <5 years and located within each village were selected. A two-stage cluster sampling was used in the surveys conducted in Thailand and Santa Rosa. In the first stage, villages were selected using probability proportional to size sampling. In the second stage, 20-40 households were randomly selected within each of the selected villages. A stratified simple random sample was used in urban Quetzaltenango; households were selected using geospatial sampling (households nearest to randomly generated coordinates in each sampled area) methodology. In all surveys a similar interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect household demographic information and information for all individuals living in the household. The head of household or primary caretaker served as a proxy for all household members. Households were excluded if the head of household or primary caregiver refused to participate or if the head of household or primary caregiver was unavailable for interview. In addition to asking if the household members had self-reported or physician-diagnosed pneumonia in the previous 12 months, participants with a history of pneumonia were asked if they sought medical care for themselves or their children for an episode of pneumonia. Other places where health care was sought or reasons for not seeking health care were also ascertained. Each survey protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by a local academic or Ministry of Health Institutional Review Board.
