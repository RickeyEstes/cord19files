Upon arrival in France, the medical staff from the French hospital in Hanoi has been sampled by a doctor belonging to the GROG network. Any person back from Asia and presenting an ILI were hospitalized and sampled. We implemented a molecular diagnosis with specific primers for the detection of influenza A and B viruses, RSV, parainfluenza viruses, metapneumoviruses, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. We set up the nested PCR detection of the SARS-associated coronavirus Urbani strain (SARS-CoV) [2] . We used a synthetic RNA kindly provided by Pr Sylvie van der Werf as positive control.
