Viruses . MHV-JHM was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, Maryland) . The isolation and characterization of JHMV variants AT11f cord and AT11f brain, as well as the MHV-4 variant V5A13 (88), have been previously published ." -19 V5A13 (88) was obtained as a gift from Dr M . Buchmeier of the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, California . All viral strains were propagated on L-2 mouse fibroblast monolayers by inoculating at a m .o .i . of approximately 0 .1 . Inoculum prepared from extracellularly released virus was collected from the culture supernatant when 90-100% of cells were incorporated into syncytia and was concentrated as previously described ." Membraneassociated inoculum was prepared from combined culture supernatant and cell-associated virus as previously described ." Virus titers were determined as plaque-forming units (pfu) per milliliter on L-2 cell monolayers . Animals. Inbred SJL/J and CD .1 mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, and bred in-house as reported previously ." Animals in our colony have remained MHV free as determined by periodic serological testing . Primary murine glial cultures . Primary, dissociated, murine glial cultures were prepared as previously described, 46 with minor modifications . Briefly, mixed cultures consisting predominantly of astrocytes and cells of the oligodendrocytic lineage were derived from dissociated cerebral hemispheres of day old mice . Tissue culture plastic or 12 mm diameter, glass coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine were seeded at densities ranging from 0 .18-0 .36 cerebral hemispheres per cm 2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM-high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Bocknek), 1 .2 g/I NaHC0 3 , 25 mm Hepes, pH 7 .3 (Sigma) and 10 g/ml gentamycin . A half medium change was made at day 4 in vitro and every third day thereafter until inoculated with virus . Infection of animals and primary glial cultures . Mice were lightly anesthetized with methoxyflurane and then inoculated i .c . with a membrane-associated virus suspension in either a 30 or 40 pl volume using a 31 gauge needle . Uninfected L-2 cell lysate was used as a control . Mixed glial cultures were inoculated with either a concentrated extracellular or crude, membraneassociated virus preparation at a m .o .i . of approximately 1 pfu per cell . The inoculum was absorbed for 60 min at 37°C, after which, the inoculum was removed, cultures washed twice with warm phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7 .2, and after addition of fresh medium, incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . Immunosuppression with cyclosporinA . Cyclosporin A was obtained as Sandimmune (Sandoz Canada, Inc .) as a 50 mg/mI solution and diluted to a 2 mg/ml working concentration with PBS . Mice were weighed and injected i .p . to deliver 25 mg/kg body weight per day . Animals were begun on CsA either the day of, or the day before, i .c . inoculation with virus . CsA treatment was continued on a daily basis for 5-10 days post-inoculation, depending on the age of the animal at the time of inoculation . Animals inoculated at 11 weeks of age were treated with CsA for 10 consecutive days post-inoculation . Control animals were injected i .p . with PBS . Virus titration of brain tissue . Aseptically removed brains were weighed, placed into ice-cold tissue culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and 10% w/v tissue homogenates prepared . The resulting suspensions were clarified by centrifugation and the supernatant used to make serial 10-fold dilutions that were inoculated onto L-2 cell monolayers . After virus adsorption for 60 min at 20°C with continuous rocking, the cultures were overlayed with medium containing carboxymethylcelIulose and incubated for 18-24 h before counting plaques . Immunostaining infected primary glial cultures . At 3 days post-inoculation, infected coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min at 20°C . Where indicated, cells were permeabilized by exposure for 30 s to acetone, then thoroughly rinsed in PBS . Coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 20-30 min as follows : mAb against JHMV nucleocapsid protein (N) as tissue culture supernatant (a generous gift from M . J . Buchmeier, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, California) 1 :8 ; rabbit anti-bovine glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Dakopatts, Denmark) 1 :50 ; and rabbit anti-galactosyl cerebroside (GC) 44 1 :10 . Secondary conjugated antibodies diluted in PBS were applied at 1 :30 for goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Sigma) and 1 :50 for goat anti-rabbit IgG-Texas Red (TR) (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc .) . Histology and immunohistochemistry. Animals were sacrificed in extremis and the CNS immediately removed and fixed by submersion into 10% neutral buffered formalin in preparation for paraffin embedding . 10 icm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for routine histopathological examination . Viral N antigen was detected in 10 pm paraffin sections using a biotin-anti-biotin amplification system conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (AS/AP Plus immunostaining kit, BIO/CAN SCIENTIFIC) . Following deparaffinization, sections were treated in a 0 .5% pepsin solution for 20 min at 37°C . Monoclonal antibody against JHMV N protein as tissue culture supernatant was then incubated overnight at room temperature at a 1 :18 dilution prior to the amplification and chromogenic reactions . Sections were then briefly counterstained with hematoxylin . In situ dot-blot analysis of MHV RNA . At 7 D .I .V . primary SJL/J glial cultures situated in 35 mm culture dishes were inoculated with wt JHMV, AT11f cord virus or AT11f brain virus at a m .o .i . of 1 . At 24 and 48 h post-inoculation, the culture supernatants were removed and the cultures thoroughly washed with ice-cold PBS . Cells were then gently scraped from the dishes and resuspended in PBS by gentle passage through fire-polished Pasteur pipettes to a final concentration of 1 x 10 6 cells/ml . Whole cells were spotted onto nitrocellulose using a Schleicher and Schuell 'minifold' filtration apparatus and processed for in situ hybridization using previously described methods ." The blot was probed at 42°C with nick-translated pg344 48 isotopically labelled with 32 P . Blots were exposed to film for 24-48 h at -70°C .
