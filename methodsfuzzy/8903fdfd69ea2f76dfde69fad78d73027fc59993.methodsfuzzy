Specimens were analyzed by using RT-PCR techniques. Briefly, total RNA was extracted by using the QIAamp virus RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as instructed by the manufacturer. RNA was used to synthesize cDNA with the SuperScript II RNase Hreverse transcriptase system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Five sets of primers were used in nested PCR to amplify the fragments covering the 5-locus genetic signatures (17564, 21721, 22222, 23823, and 27827) ( Table 1) . Then, with the purified PCR products as templates and the second round primers as sequencing primers, the fragments were sequenced in ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City, CA, USA). Each PCR fragment was directly sequenced from both inward and outward directions, in duplicate. All the original base data were processed for base calling, assembly, and editing by the SegMan II sequences analysis software of DNA Star package (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). The comparisons with other sequences available from public database (GenBank) were made by using the default parameter of ClustalW (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). Single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were indicated, and the deduced amino acid changes were described.
