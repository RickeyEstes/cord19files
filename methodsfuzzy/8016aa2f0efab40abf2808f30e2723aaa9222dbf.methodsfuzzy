To enhance the performances of scoring functions, there is another new technique called the clustering-based scoring method, which includes the entropic effects by dividing generated ligand-binding modes into different clusters [77] . The entropic contribution in each cluster is calculated by the configurational space covered by the ligand poses or the number of ligand poses in the cluster. One disadvantage of clustering-based scoring methods is that its performance relies on the ligand sampling protocol, which is highly dependent on the docking program. To derive the COMBINE model, fundamentally three steps are to be followed: namely, modeling the molecules and their complexes, measuring the interaction energies between ligands and the receptor, and finally, performing chemometric analysis to derive the regression equation [4] . The methodology for the COMBINE analysis is outlined schematically in Figure 10 .10. a. Molecular modeling: To develop the COMBINE models, the ligands should be divided into fragments, and then the same number of fragments must be allocated to all the compounds, adding dummy fragments to the ligands lacking the correct number. The 3D models of the ligandÀreceptor complexes and the unbound receptor and ligands can be derived with a standard molecular mechanics program. Different regression equations can be produced by using the following factors: • Different starting conformations of the receptor • The inclusion of positional restraints on parts of the receptor • Different convergence criteria during energy minimization • Different ways of treating the soluteÀsolvent interface • The dielectric environment b. Measurement of the interaction energies: The objective of this step is the computation of the nonbonded (VDW and electrostatic) interaction energies between each residue of the receptor and every fragment of the ligand, using a molecular mechanics FF. Along with the interaction energies, the energies between all pairs of residues/ fragments for the complexes and for the free ligands and receptor on the basis of the distance-based dielectric constant should be computed as well. Finally, a matrix will be formed, with columns representing the energy components and rows representing each compound in the set. A final column containing experimental activities or inhibitory activities or binding affinities is then added to the matrix as the dependent variable for model development. c. Chemometric analysis: After the completion of steps 1 and 2, significant descriptors should be retained and others must be eliminated from the study matrix. Due to the large number of variables and their intercorrelation nature, partial least squares (PLS) is the technique of choice for deriving the QSAR model that can quantify the most important energy interactions in terms of activity prediction [87, 88] . The first step of CoRIA is the calculation of the binding energies in the form of nonbonded interaction energies (like VDW and Coulombic), which describe thermodynamic events involved in ligand binding to the active site of the receptor. Thereafter, employing a genetic version of the PLS technique (namely, G/PLS), these calculated energies should be correlated with the biological activities of molecules, along with the other physiochemical variables like molar refractivity, surface area, molecular volume, Jurs descriptors, and strain energy [5, 95, 96] . Further, validation has to be performed for the developed CoRIA models based on various validation metrics to ensure the acceptability of the developed models. The methodology of the CoRIA is schematically presented in Figure 10 .11.
