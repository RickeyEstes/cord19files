For determining the PEDV neutralizing activity of the serum antibodies we detected sample obtained from mice which were orally immunized with recombinant L. plantarum by antibody neutralization assay (microdetermination) as described before (Tian et al., 2014) with minor modifications. Under aseptic conditions serum and fecal samples were collected at 14, 35 and 42 days respectively after immunization, quantitative virus and serial diluted serum were added to Vero cells to evaluate serum neutralizing antibody titers, the neutralizing antibody titer PD50 (Median protective dose refers to the dose of serum or vaccine that protects half (50%) of the experimental animals) was determined by Karber's method at 72 h.
