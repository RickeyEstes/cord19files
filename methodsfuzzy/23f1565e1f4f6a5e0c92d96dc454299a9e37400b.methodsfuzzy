The stock solution of IAV was first serially diluted with VGM medium. MDCK cells (1 × 10 4 ) were seeded in 96-well plates for 24 h and then infected with IAV. After 48 h, the TCID 50 was calculated following the method of Reed and Muench. Antiviral activities were also evaluated by the SRB method [43, 44] . Briefly, MDCK cells were seeded in 96-well plate. 0.09 mL of virus suspension (50 × TCID 50 ) and 0.01 mL medium containing the test drug were added. At 48 h, after washing, 100 µL −20 • C 70% acetone was added. After removing acetone, the plates were dried, and added 100 µL 0.4% (w/v) SRB, after washing, the plates were dried and added 100 µL 10 mM Tris-based solution. OD was read at 562 nm. Three wells were used each for the negative (virus-infected non-drug-treated) and mock controls (non-infected non-drug-treated). 0.5% DMSO was used in each group. Percent protection of OMT, which is positively related to the cell viability, was calculated as the following: • OMT-treated groups (OMT60 and OMT120, each group n = 16): Mice were infected intranasally with 10× MLD 50 of IAV (PR8) viruses in a 50 µL volumes, and treated with OMT (60 mg/kg/day, 120 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage, respectively. DMSO (0.5% (v/v)), oseltamivir or OMT were given twice a day (at 12-h intervals) for 6 days, starting 24 h after randomly grouping and before virus exposure. The body weights, symptoms, and survivals of ten mice in each group (n = 10) were monitored daily for 14 days after virus inoculation. At day 6 p.i., another six mice in each group (n = 6) were euthanized by cervical dislocation, the lung index was assessed by determining the percent of lung wet weight (g) to body weight (g) (lung index = lung wet weight (g)/body weight (g) × 100%).Then the collected lungs were separated into two sets, the right lungs were fixed in 10% formalin, and the left lungs were frozen at −80 • C. The left lungs were homogenized in 1 mL of cold MEM medium, and the total protein levels were measured using the BioRad protein assay kit, viral titer and target proteins were determined by TCID 50 , ELISA, or qRT-PCR assays. The unit was corrected for the amount of protein. To examine pathological changes, the right side of the lung was embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 µm for haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The severity of histological changes was scored according to a semiquantitative scoring system [47] , which was further showed in 'Supplement material of Methods'.
