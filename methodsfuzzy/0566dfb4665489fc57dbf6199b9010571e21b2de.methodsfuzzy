Collection of fecal samples. Fresh, uncontaminated, ground deposit, fecal samples were collected from adult trail horses (n = 300), ranging in age from 3 to 30 years, at various trail heads near large watersheds in Colorado. Samples were collected between July and November, 1996 and the demographics associated with sample collection represented 23 different trail heads in the state of Colorado. The collection of fecal samples from recreational horses was done at random, assuming that the sampled population adequately represented a much larger, total population of recreational trail horses in the state of Colorado. Of the 300 horses sampled, 37% were female horses and 63% were male horses. None of the horses were younger than 3 years, 30% of the horses were between the ages of 3 and 8; 42% of the horses were between the ages of 9 and 14; 20% of the horses were between the ages of 15 and 20 and 8% of the horses were over the age of 21. In addition, 46% were Quarter Horses, 43% were mixed or rare breeds, and 11% were Arabians. The frequency of trail use in over 80% of the horses sampled was greater than 4 days per week during the peak season. Ten grams of feces from each horse was mixed with 10% formalin at a dilution rate of 1 part feces to 4 parts formalin and transported in individually labeled, screw top, plastic containers to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Colorado State University, Fort Collins for analysis. The individual labels included the assigned identification number, age, sex, and breed of the respective horse the sample was taken from. These samples were kept at room temperature until analyzed. Another 10 gof feces sample was stored as reserves in individually labeled plastic bags and transported to the walk-in freezer for future studies at the Department of Animal Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins. In addition to sample collection, a separate questionnaire was completed for each of the 300 horses. Through the use of these questionnaires, information gathered included: age, sex, and breed of the horse, stabling, frequency of trail use, and occurrence of diarrhea.
