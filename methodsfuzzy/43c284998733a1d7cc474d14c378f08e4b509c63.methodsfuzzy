Virus and cells. The CHIKV isolate used in this experiment was a clinical isolate from an outbreak in Johor in 2008 coded as MY/065/08/FN295485. It belongs to the ECSA genotype and has the A226V mutation in E1 protein 29, 30 . BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney) and Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were used in this study. Vero cells have been widely used in the in vitro antiviral research for example in the antiviral testing for the chikungunya virus, human enterovirus 71 and Coxsackievirus A16 31, 32 . Both cell lines were cultured using Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, Gibco, NY, USA) containing 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin, and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . The CHIKV MY/065/08/FN295485 strain was propagated in BHK-21 cells and harvested after full cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed. Virus stock titer was determined by the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) methods 33 ; then the obtained stock was aliquoted and stored at -70 °C. During the time of virus propagation and antiviral assay the FBS concentration of the cell culture medium was reduced to 2%. Vero cell line was used for further experiments such as MTS assay and antiviral assays. The CHIKV replicon cells 20 were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Gibco, NY, USA) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2% tryptose-broth phosphate and penicillin-streptomycin, and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Flavonoids. Silymarin, quercetin and kaempferol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and stored in − 20 °C for future use. Stock solution was diluted with EMEM and was filtered through a syringe filter with 0.2 μ m pore size (Millipore, MA, USA) at the time of use; DMSO concentration in working solutions prepared on EMEM was kept at 0.1%.
