A descriptive retrospective observational study was carried out about the mandatory claims and the confirmed ODs of infectious diseases of HWs, covering the last 22 years using insurance data. The Institution for Statutory Accident Insurance and Prevention in Healthcare and Welfare (BGW-Berufsgenossenschaft für Gesundheitswesen und Wohlfahrtspflege) is the compensation board for all private healthcare and welfare providers in Germany. A total of 630,000 companies with about eight million insured persons are covered by the BGW. In addition to HWs, the insured persons can be hairdressers, social workers, and volunteers. In Germany, about one-third of all hospitals are public and therefore covered by other state-held insurances. However, in recent years some public hospitals were privatised and changed to having the BGW as their insurer. The BGW's standardised database of compensation claims relating to infectious disease was used for this analysis. Data on infections caused by animals or tropical diseases was not included. The database makes it possible to distinguish between the most frequent infectious diseases. The date of registration of a claim and the decision whether the claim is confirmed as an OD are documented in this standardised data set. As the decision on the claim may not be reached in the year when the claim is filed, or because several decisions can be taken due to the appeal of a decision, the number of claims decided differs from the number of claims filed in a particular year. Therefore, a valid confirmation rate cannot be calculated per year. An average confirmation rate was calculated by summarising all registered claims and all confirmed cases for the total period. This does not provide an exact confirmation rate but an estimate that should be rather close to the true value. It is compulsory for physicians to report suspected cases of ODs after first diagnosis. In the standardised data set, a further distinction is made between ODs that are mandatorily reportable and those that are not. It is not mandatory to report contacts with infectious patients or materials. Therefore, they were excluded from this analysis. Time trends from 1996 to 2017 were analysed for mandatory claims only. A distinction can be made between tuberculosis (TB), latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, influenza, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). All other infections were combined in the category 'Other Infections'. Latent tuberculosis infection is considered present if the interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) is positive, and active TB is excluded by X-ray. Infections with parasites are not considered, as in the case of these infections the data set does not allow for a clear distinction between contact with patients with parasitic infection and actual infection. The rate of claims per 100,000 full-time workers as well as the rate of confirmed ODs per 100,000 full-time workers was calculated. Two part-time workers working 50% of the normal working time of 39 h per week were regarded as one full-time worker. Volunteers, such as first aids or social assistance workers, are not paid for their work. As they do not work regular hours, they are not included in the calculation of full-time workers. Therefore, the number of full-time workers is far lower than the number of insured persons.
