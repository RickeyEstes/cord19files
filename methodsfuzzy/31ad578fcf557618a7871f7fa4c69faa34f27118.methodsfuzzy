Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following:  VSV preparation and plaque assay For VSV preparation, a confluent cell layer of BHK-21 cells was infected with VSV at MOI of 0.01 in MEM medium with 2% FCS for 1 h. Then, the medium was aspirated and cells were overlaid with fresh MEM medium containing 5% FCS. After 48 h the supernatant was harvested and centrifuged at 300 g for 6 min to remove cell debris. The virus stock was frozen at À80 C and the titer was determined via plaque assay. Measurement of infectious viral particles in supernatants was done by directly diluting supernatants in media. For measurement of infectious viral particles in organs, tissues were prepared at the indicated time points after infection, transferred to Lysing Matrix tubes (MP biomedicals), and kept with either 500 mL MEM medium (5% FCS) (small tissues), or 1000 mL (big tissues). Samples were frozen at À80 C until plaque assay was performed. Then, the samples were thawed and homogenized for 30 s (4 m/sec) in a sample homogenizer (MP biomedicals). For OB, 500 mL of medium was added to organ homogenate before samples were used in plaque assay. Serial 10-fold dilutions of homogenates were transferred onto Vero cell monolayer in 6-well plates and incubated for 1 h at 37 C. Monolayers were overlaid with 2 mL of MEM containing 1% methylcellulose and incubated for 24 h at 37 C. Then the overlay was removed, and the monolayer was fixed and stained using 0.5% crystal violet.
