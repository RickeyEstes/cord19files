The methods used for immunodiagnosis employ either labelled or unlabelled reagents ( Table 3) . Application of the commonest methods is represented in Table 4 . An example of a novel approach to the use of unlabelled reagents is calorimetry [22] . The results of the various methods are likely to differ owing to differences in their sensitivity as well as the specificity, appearance, duration, and class of the measured antibody. Methods which use unlabelled materials depend on the expression (or inhibition of the expression) of some measurable function: e.g., neutralization, complement fixation, hemagglutination, or precipitation. The methods are commonly used owing to a large body of experience in their interpretation, the availability of commercial reagents, and the relative simplicity of the required instrumentation. Various technqiues are frequently retained not only for convenience, but a difference in the conveyed information: e.g., with rubella, maximal titers typically occur at one to two weeks for hemagglutination-inhibition, two to four weeks for complement fixation, but three to seven months for passive hemagglutination [17] . Neutralization can probably be regarded as the standard test. It is useable whenever a virus can be cultivated and its results probably relate more closely to the protective capability of the antibody than the results of any other test. However, it is laborious, expensive, rather insensitive, and its results are typically unavailable for several days or weeks. The neutralizing antibody can combine directly with the receptor, which is responsible for viral attachment to cells, or it can act indirectly. In the latter case, the antibody reacts with a nearby site where it sterically hinders the attachment of the virus. Steric hindrance is increased by a subsequent attachment of a second antibody, directed against the specific antibody, or of the early components of complement (factors C1-C3). Direct damage to the virus occurs with the addition of the later factors (C5-C9). These features can be used to obtain a manyfold increase in the sensitivity of the neutralization test: e.g., by the addition of a heterologous antiimmunoglobulin [24] and complement [23] . Neutralizing antibody is frequently more Togavirus specific for the strain or type of the infecting virus than antibody assessed by other methods. Neutralization can therefore be used not only to assay the antibody but frequently also to characterize the virus. Modifications of the test have been employed to obtain quicker results or to derive more information about the reactants (for example, the number of neutralized sites on a virus). Such modifications include the plaque reduction assay [25] , the use of an immunofluorescent antibody to identify infected cells, and kinetic neutralization assay [26] . The complement fixation assay depends on the addition of a standardized amount of complement (fresh guinea pig serum) to the viral antigen-antibody mixture [27] . The added complement is consumed and therefore is no longer available to lyse an indicator system which consists of sheep red cells bearing a complement-fixing (lytic) antibody (rabbit anti-sheep red cell hemolysin). Fixation of complement occurs chiefly with antibody of the IgM and IgG class (but not subclass 4), which induce the classical pathway of complement activation. Other antibody may activate the alternate pathway. In practice, IgM antibody is sometimes (M. August and A. Baumgarten, unpublished) detected by the test, but not always, owing to its low sensitivity and the small amount of IgM found in circulation (compared to the typically high IgG antibody level). The assay is widely used but is usually incapable of differentiating between antibody to different strains or types of a virus. Paradoxically, insensitivity is one of the virtues of the assay, because the tested antibody becomes detectable rather late in infection and typically remains so for only a few months. Therefore, antibody associated with current or recent infection is detected rather than antibody which persists after an old infection. The method is subject to considerable interand intra-laboratory variability. The level of antibody also varies considerably between individuals. Assignment of arbitrary titers for "normal" sera is therefore unreliable, though reproducibility of the assay can be maintained over long periods by the use of aliquots of reagents stored below -70Â°C. An acceptable procedure consists of a simultaneous titration of initial and convalescent sera, the former collected as soon as possible and the latter after an interval of two to four weeks. The basic assay has been modified in various ways which retain the common feature of utilizing the attachment of complement but assess its effect by different methods and generally with improved sensitivity. The modifications include: -Single radial hemolysis [28, 29] and single radial complement fixation [30] , in both of which the complement exercises its lytic function. The former method uses erythrocytes coated with virus both as the target and the indicator, while the latter method uses virus in the gel as target but a subsequent layer of hemolysin-sensitized red cells in agarose as the indicator. -Immunoadherence hemagglutination [31] , in which bound complement is detected by the adherence of human blood group 0 erythrocytes in the presence of EDTA to inhibit lysis. -Assays for the bound factor C3 of complement which is detected by its reaction with labelled anti-factor C3 antibody (by immunofluorescence [32] or EIA). Hemagglutination and hemagglutination-inhibition can be used to detect either antigen (virus) or antibody. Similar assays, which depend on the aggregation of suitable particles, can be undertaken directly with the virus and the reaction with antibody be observed by electron microscopy [33] . The assays can use other particles and the reaction be detected by various means; e.g., protein A bearing staphylococcus aureus (which binds the antibody initially) can be observed to undergo coagglutination [34] in the presence of antigen. In the simplest version, the hemagglutination assay detects the virus by its ability to agglutinate erythrocytes of an appropriate species of animal. Inhibition of the agglutination detects the antibody to the viral receptor for the erythrocyte. In reverse hemagglutination an antibody is used to coat red cells, which are then agglutinated by the virus, a process which can again be inhibited by antibody in a tested fluid. Alternatively, a viral antigen is used to coat the erythrocytes which are then agglutinated by the antibody (passive or indirect hemagglutination). In this case, viral antigen is assessed by its ability to inhibit the agglutination. The hemagglutination reaction for antibody while simple in principle and potentially very sensitive, especially for IgM antibody where its sensitivity can be several thousandfold greater than for IgG antibody, requires a careful (and often elusive) preparation of reagents. The conditions for the preparation of coated red cells include attention to the pH, type, and concentration of buffer, duration of incubation, the temperature, suitable concentration (usually high) of viral antigen (which requires at least partial purification), and an appropriate preparation of the erythrocye surface. The last may range from simple washing, through the use of tannic acid (at an appropriate concentration) to the addition of stabilizing agents (e.g., formaldehyde) and protein coupling agents [35, 36] (gluteraldehyde, chromic chloride, dinitrodifluorobenzene, carbodiimide, etc). The hemagglutination reaction, like the neutralization test, can be used in the kinetic version [37] for improved resolution of antigen. Precipitation reactions in agarose gels [38] are convenient in that they visibly display each antigen-antibody system which reaches an adequate concentration, but they are usually less sensitive than other methods of assay. Double immunodiffusion (DI) [38, 39] has been used chiefly for the detection of HBs antigen and antibody but also of antibody to CMV, rubella, influenza, adenovirus, vaccinia, rhinovirus, and measles. It is slow, insensitive, and consumes large quantities of material, but is useful in comparing complex mixtures of antigen or antibody. Counter immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) uses an agarose gel, 0.6-1.0 g/dl, electroendosmotic factor 0.12-0.2, in buffer pH 8. 2-8.9 . In the gel is cut a 3-5 mm diameter anodal well for antibody and a cathodal well for antigen, 4-6 mm apart. The reactants are driven toward one another by the application of an electric current, 5-10 V per cm, so that unproductive diffusion is restricted. CIE can be several times more sensitive than DI, but is still inefficient for many viruses because of their large size. The disproportion between the migratory speed of the antibody and virus can be reduced by applying the former 10 to 20 minutes before the latter. Obviously, only electronegatively charged antigens can be detected with conventional antisera. The principal advantages of the method are its simplicity and speed (results can be obtained in 30 to 60 minutes). It has been used for the detection of various materials [40, 41] , including HBs Ag and antibody, rotavirus, enterovirus, as well as antibody to CMV, arbovirus, and myxovirus. Immunoelectrophoresis can be used for the resolution of complex antigenic mixtures, e.g., measles virus [42] , but has had only limited application for viral immunodiagnosis. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis is a modified method which uses electrophoresis of the antigen in a plain gel in one dimension, followed by electrophoresis into a gel containing antibody in a second dimension, at right angles to the first. Each antigen produces a rocket-like (A shaped) trail of precipitation in which the height of the peak reflects the relative concentration of antigen and antibody. This method has been used in the study of HSV antigen [43] . An anologous method ("rocket" electrophoresis) uses a single antibody and electrophoresis of the antigen.in only one direction, but permits quantification of the antigen by reference to a standard. This method has been used for influenza A [44] . Single radial immunodiffusion (SRID) has been widely applied to the quantification of various protein antigens and can achieve sensitivity as high as 0.165 ,ug/ ml, but in mixtures with high protein concentration (e.g., serum), a lower sensitivity (1-10 Ag/ml) is likely. High sensitivity can be obtained with fixation in 1-4 g/dl tannic acid, incorporation of 1-2 g/ dl polyethylene glycol, MW 4000-6000, in the gel, overlay with a second antibody (immunofixation), or by the use of labelled reagents. However, the method is slow and has limited applicability to whole virus.
