The first step for the selection of the best set of descriptors to model the different activities was the removal of constant descriptors (i.e., a descriptor that presents the same value for all compounds of a data set, this usually being zero). After that, multilinear regressions (MLR) were built with Weka 3.6.5 [57] [58] [59] to select descriptors by the M5 method, using the training set which give origin to a set 232 descriptors. The next step in the selection of the best set of descriptors to model each activity consists in the application of the Correlation-based Feature Subset Selection algorithm [60] (the algorithm evaluates the usefulness of individual descriptors for predicting the given activity and also the level of intercorrelation among descriptors) implemented in Weka 3.6.5. The selection was performed using the AttributeSelectedClassifier routine of Weka with the CfsSubsetEval option as descriptor evaluator and the BestFirst, LinearForwardSelection or GreedyStepwise option as search methods within a ten-fold cross-validation procedure and k nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm as ML technique.
