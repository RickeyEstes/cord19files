In a pilot experiment, formalin-fixed, paraf~n-embedded cells were used to compare the 3 extraction protocols. Optical density readings that we used to monitor the purification process showed a gradual increase in 260/280 ratios after the phenol/chloroform extraction and column purification steps in each protocol, as expected, but they never reached levels indicating high purity of RNA (1.6 maximum, pure RNA 2.1). There were no signi~cant differences between the extraction procedures, and dewaxing did not give significantly better results, although the ratios tended to be slightly higher than those of extracts from non-dewaxed tissue sections. In Fig. 2a 1 and 2) and after (lanes 3 and 4) pbenol~chloroform treatment, and after the spin columns (lanes 5 and 6) . The Sactin RT-PCR was done with 10 ~1(2b, upper panel) or I pl (lower panel) of template per reaction. torovirus 3'-end primers (40 cycles). Amplifiable RNA was obtained with all 3 extraction methods. In protocols A and B phenol/chloroform was necessary for successful amplification, because only after such treatment were visible bands obtained (A3-6, B3-6). Spin column purification did not give better RT-PCR results (reactions 5 and 6) than phenol/chloroform extraction alone (reactions 3 and 4), and lead to the loss of one template (C5). Finally, RT-PCR results were comparable for extracts from dewaxed and non-dewaxed sections. Identical results were obtained when using torovirus primers 3 and 4 (not shown). With actin primers 1 and 2, which give rise to an amplicon of 82 bp, results were similar to the torovirus RT-PCR when 10 ~1 extract was used (Fig. 2b, top  panel) . No amplification was obtained with aliquots from extracts that were taken prior to phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol extraction in protocols A and B (lanes Al, A2, Bl and B2). When a IO-fold dilution of these templates was used in the RT-PCR, clear bands were seen (Fig. 2b, lower panel) , Phenol/chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation were done with protocols A and B. but not with the glassbead (SC) method. Band intensity was scored visually in comparison with the DNA marker as weaker (+), similar (+ +) or stronger (t + +). Abbreviations: PFA, paraformaldehyde; CBA, citrate-buffered-acetone; pol, polymerase. The maximum size of amplicon obtained with the three primer-pairs is given. *indicates PCR bands could only be detected by hybridization with an internal oligonucleotide indicating that the lack of amplification had been caused by inhibition of RT-PCR rather than shortage of template. The results of this experiment are listed in Tables 2a and 2b . For this comparison we extracted sections from paraffin-embedded cell pellets that had been fixed for different times in different fixatives. Extraction protocols A and B and the glass bead extraction method were used, and RT-PCR amplification was done using primer pairs toro l/2 (3-end), 3/4 (pol; . Table 2a ), actin l/3 (82 bp), l/4 (249 bp) and l/.5 (507 bp; Table 2b ). For the torovirus RT-PCRs, less template and a lower number of cycles (30) were used than in the comparison of extraction methods described above (40 cycles) in order to detect differences in efficiency of extraction and RT-PCR. When using the 3'-end torovirus primers (l/2) under these conditions, most consistent results were obtained with extraction protocol B (Table 2a) , which yielded amplifiable RNA from cell pellets for all tixations except 5 months formalin prior to embedding. It is noteworthy that we were able to amplify an 82 bp jj-actin RNA fragment from the latter tissue (primers actin 1 and 2; Table 2b ). For materials fixed in Carnoy's fluid, only protocol B gave positive RT-PCR results with both torovirus primer pairs (Table 2a) . With the polymerase primers, toro 3 and 4, the results were similar but the intensity of the DNA bands was less for 4 of the 14 extracts that gave positive results. To compare the sensitivities of the 2 torovirus specific primer pairs, we tested RNA extracts from serially diluted cell-culture grown BEV, showing that the 3'-end primers detected 10 and the polymerase primers lo2 TCIDSO (not shown). No bands were obtained when coronavirus RNA was used as a template. When comparing fixation methods, the best results were obtained with acetone and B-5 as a fixative, which gave high yields of torovirus PCR product with all extraction protocols. However, the maximum size of amplifiable actin mRNA was higher for the acetone-fixed material (Table 2b) . Even though the size of the torovirus amplicons was 231 for the 3'-end primers and 235 for the polymerase primers, the similar size (249 bp) product of the actin RT-PCR (primers actin 1 and 3) was only seen in 4 of the 13 extracts that were positive with both torovirus primers. To test if our method was applicable to rotavirus, which has a doublestranded RNA genome, we extracted RNA for RT-PCR from paraftinembedded rotavirus-infected and uninfected cell pellets (Fig. 3, lanes l-3) . We used NBF as a fixative in this experiment because we had archival pathology specimens to be tested for rotavirus, that were formalin-fixed. RNA from fresh uninfected and infected cells was used in the negative and positive control reactions (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5) .
