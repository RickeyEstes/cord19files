The detailed numerical geometry of the thermal manikin is obtained from a physical thermal manikin by using a three-dimensional laser scanning technique. The geometry of the CTM is a real and accurate representation of a nude seated female occupant. The surface area is 1.5696 m 2 . Two human bodies represented by such a CTM facing each other are placed in a displacement ventilated room (Fig. 1) . One is the polluting source and the other is exposed. The distance between the nose tips is about 1.2 m. The ventilation air is supplied from the sidewall at the floor level, with an inlet facial velocity of 0.2 m/s, and the supply air temperature is 22 1C, and the turbulent intensity I is assumed to be 20%. The ventilation rate is 0.024 m 3 /s and it provides the room with 5.54 air changes per hour, which approximates a practical displacement ventilation design. No other heat sources are present in this modeled room, except the convection heat loss from the two human bodies. The exhaust grill is located at the ceiling level. In this case, there is no strong buoyancydriven convection flow, so the airflow pattern in this modeled room will be close to a uni-directional flow, which is desirable for achieving better ventilation effectiveness. In reality, if there are other more intensive convection heat sources, such as other office appliances, and warm window/wall surfaces, the hot plume generated by these sources may generate recirculation. The ventilated room is divided into two parts: a cuboid enclosing the human bodies and the remaining room space for grids generation. The cuboid is broken with unstructured grids (tetrahedral cell topology) due to the complex geometry of the human body while the remaining room space is discretized with structured grids (Fig. 2) . In order to express the complex human body geometry especially the extremities of the head, the cells with the length scale of centimeters, even millimeters, should be applied. Since gradients of the air velocity field and the temperature field surrounding the body are high four boundary layers are created around the human body with the first layer height of 0.2 mm. The total number of cells is 2,525,729. The RNG k-e model including a differential formula for effective viscosity to account for low-Reynolds-number effects, combined with enhanced wall treatment which integrates a two-layer model with enhanced wall function, is used in this simulation [9] because the airflow around the human body sitting in the displacement ventilated room is not a fully developed turbulent flow. The value of y+ of the grids close to the human body is less than 1. The location of the first grids to the wall is of great importance in the accurate simulation of convective heat transfer if wall functions are used. Normally the value of y+ should be in the range of 30-100 if the standard wall function works. However, the small length scale of the grids close to the body mentioned before limits the value of y+. Therefore here the enhanced wall treatment is applied which requires at least 10 cells within the viscosity-affected near-wall region. Detailed boundary conditions are listed in Table 1 .
