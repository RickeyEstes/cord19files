The TARGET cohort study is a multi-centre, prospective cohort study to derive and validate a clinical rule using symptoms, signs, demographic and microbiological factors to predict complications of acute cough in children presenting to primary care with RTI. The study is aiming to recruit 8,300 children from primary care sites attached to four study centres (Bristol, London, Oxford and Southampton, UK) between July 2011 and end of June 2013. The Bristol study centre also collects single sweep dual viral and bacterial throat swabs from recruited children and asks parents/carers to complete a symptom and medication diary for up to 28 days after recruitment. The study was approved by the South West Central Bristol Research Ethics Committee, UK (reference number: 10/H0102/54) and research governance approvals obtained across all areas prior to the start of recruitment in those areas.
