Five sea cucumber adults, averaged 420 g and five juvenile averaged 55 g, with typical APED symptoms, were taken stochastically, in March 2005, during the outbreak of sea cucumber APED. Tentacle (buccal podia), peristome, papillate podia, respiratory tress, hemal channel wall, and intestinal wall were selected for study. The sea cucumbers were anesthetized by first being placed on moist cold filter papers in petri dishes for 10 min, and then into cold mineral water (fresh water, 4°C) for 5 min. This ensured that the sea cucumbers were extended with muscles relaxed, allowing easy dissection. This was carried out on the dorsal side. The selected tissues were detached and arranged in two groups. One group of tissue samples was prepared for ultra-thin sections and immersed in primary fixative (3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer) (Sorour and Larink, 2001) . After fixation for 3-4 h at 4°C, the specimens were washed in the same buffer for 2.5 h at 4°C. Postfixation in 1% osmium tetroxide in the phosphate buffer was carried out for 2 h at 4°C, followed by dehydration in a graded series of ethanol. The specimens were embedded in Araldite mixture, and polymerized at 60°C. Specimen blocks were sectioned with a Reichert Ultra-tome, 50 nm in thickness, and viewed with a JEOL JEM 1200EX electron microscope operating at 60 kV, after counterstaining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate (Becker et al., 2003) . The other group of samples was prepared for histopathology analyses that were performed on frozen sections immediately following microtomy. They were sectioned at 5 lm and stained with Mayer's haematoxyin and eosin (H&E), followed by observation and photography.
