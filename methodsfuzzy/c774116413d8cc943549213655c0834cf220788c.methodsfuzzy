Asthmatic patients admitted to the pediatric allergy outpatient clinic for an asthma exacerbation or a routine control visit between November 2011 and February 2012 were included in this study. Classification of asthma severity and control was assessed according to the criteria of the Global Initiative for Asthma. 15 Controlled asthma was defined as the absence of nocturnal and daytime symptoms, limitation of activities, need for rescue treatment with normal lung function tests for the last month. Asthma attack was defined as the presence of progressive cough, wheezing, dyspnea or chest tightness accompanied by low forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) values in a previously diagnosed asthmatic patient. The asthma attack score, pulmonary index score, need for systemic steroid, hospitalization and number of bronchodilators in the first 6 h of attack were also assessed for the patients in the acute asthma group. 16, 17 Regular medications were recorded in all patients. The asthma attack and controlled asthma groups were matched by mild to moderate severity in the previous three months and they were monosensitised to house dust mites. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) presence of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in the acute asthma group; and (2) no symptoms of URTI in the preceding six weeks in the controlled asthma group. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) presence of chronic lung disease or severe asthma; (2) sensitization to allergen other than mite; and (3) use of drugs or a chronic disease that can affect the levels of serum vit D. The children were asked about the presence of symptoms of URTI. The criteria for a clinically manifested URTI were defined as two or more of the following symptoms: fever, cough, headache, sneezing/runny nose/nasal congestion, pharyngeal hyperemia and sore throat. 2 Lung functions were conducted just before blood sampling, in accordance with ATS/ERS guidelines 18 maximum midexpiratory flow (MMEF) and bronchodilator reversibility were recorded for data analysis. Allergen sensitization was evaluated by skin testing. It was performed according to the ISAAC protocol. 19 The following antigens were applied to the volar surface of the forearm in addition to histamine and saline controls: Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, cockroach, cat and dog dander, Alternaria alternata, mixed grass and tree pollen. A test was considered positive if the maximal diameter of the wheal was 3 mm after subtracting the maximal diameter of the negative control. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the height in squared meters and was recorded. The levels of serum IP-10 (RayBiotech Inc., Norcross, USA), human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (camp) (USCN Life Science Inc., Houston, Texas, USA) and TLR2 (Cusabio Biotech Co. Ltd., Wuhan, China) were measured by ELISA using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were analyzed by highperformance liquid chromatography system tandem mass spectrometry (Chromsystems, Grafelfing, Germany). Moreover, the total IgE levels and eosinophil count measurements were performed as markers of allergy. Cytokines such as IL-13, TGF-␤ (RayBiotech Inc., Norcross, USA), IL-6, IL-12, IL-10, IL-4 and IFN-␥ (DIAsource ImmunoAssays S.A., Nivelles, Belgium) were measured in serum in all patients by ELISA assay. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll centrifugation. Lymphocytes were gated on the basis of their forward and side scatter properties using FACSCalibur flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, New Jersey, USA). Peripheral blood CD4 + , CD8 + , CD25 + and Foxp3 positive cell numbers were studied and T reg cells were determined as the absolute count of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + cells. In the asthma attack group, blood samples were taken at the time point when the patients were admitted to hospital with an asthma exacerbation. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from children with acute asthma. By using multiplex-PCR (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea), the nasopharyngeal swab samples were tested for 15 different viruses (rhinovirus A/B/C, respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses, coronaviruses 229E/NL63 and OC43/HKU1, metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, influenza A and B viruses, adenovirus and parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, 4). The study was approved by the clinical research ethics committees of Mersin University. All patients provided written informed consent prior to taking part in the study.
