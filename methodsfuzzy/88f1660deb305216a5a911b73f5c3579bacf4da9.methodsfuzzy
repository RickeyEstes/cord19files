Fluorescent dyes can be used to stain a purified virus preparation and allow enumeration of virus in a solution. OliGreen, for instance, a dye that specifically binds to nucleotides, has been successfully used for the enumeration of adenovirus 5, RSV, and influenza A. This method can be performed within 1 hour. 19 To that end, density-gradient-purified virus preparations are incubated with the dye and subjected to analysis in a modified flow cytometer. Although it has not yet been tested in clinical samples, this method provides information about the genome size of the virus. Its measurements have been consistent with data obtained with transmission electron microscopy enumeration of the same viral stocks. As indicated by the name, serologic methods attempt to detect viruses in the host by assessing the presence of specific antibodies in blood samples. In most cases, during the course of an illness, blood samples should be collected at least twice: in the acute phase and during convalescence. Comparison of the antibody pattern in these two states allows safe demonstration of diagnostically significant active virus. Acute-phase blood should be collected as soon as possible after the onset of disease (no later than 1 week), whereas the convalescent sample should be collected at least 2 weeks after onset. These requirements make serologic testing more relevant for epidemiologic studies than for clinical use, because the long delay before a definite diagnosis is made limits its use in urgent decision making in clinical practice. However, in many cases in which rapid methods of antigen detection are inefficient (e.g., RSV detection in adults), serologic testing is considered a reference method; moreover, it remains the method of choice for archival material; for example, it is as sensitive as PCR in detecting influenza infections. 25 Among the five classes of human immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, and IgD), the four IgG subclasses (IgG1-4) have a longer half-life (22 days) than the others and are associated with long-term protection. In addition, IgG antibodies exert their protective role against infection by triggering complement fixation and improve the specificity of the immune response by binding to the surface of cytotoxic effector cells. Most viruses induce mainly IgG1 and IgG3 responses. IgM antibodies represent approximately one tenth of serum immunoglobulins and are the first to be produced after exposure to a foreign antigen. Secretory IgA constitutes the first line of defense against mucosal viral infections. On first encounter with the foreign antigen, the IgM class of antibodies is primarily produced, whereas IgG may be produced subsequently and may dominate the later phase of the response. On repeat encounter, memory B cells produce high levels of high-affinity IgG antibodies. When the antigen is localized in the mucosa, the immune response, driven by B cells of the interstitial lymphoid follicles (e.g., tonsils, Peyer's patches) also produces high quantities of IgA. There are many potential antigens in each virus that may be presented at different time points in the course of infection. The primary antibody response to a virus is typically characterized by early onset of IgM production (peaking at 2 weeks) that declines later, followed by IgG production (reaching a plateau 2 weeks later) that may persist for years. Reinfection may result in overproduction of IgG, together with low or undetectable production of IgM. Another major issue in antibody measurement is the type of antibodies targeted by the test. Thus, antibodies detected by EIAs may be different from those that confer neutralization activity. Neutralizing antibodies persist after viral infection; their measurement aims to determine vaccine efficacy and is used in epidemiologic studies rather than for the diagnosis of primary infection. Neutralizing antibodies are raised against particular epitopes, usually found on the surface of the virus, and on binding to the virus, render it noninfectious by blocking its attachment to receptors or preventing uncoating of the virus. In tests assessing neutralizing antibody, the serum sample is usually incubated with a viral preparation of known titer, and its ability to inhibit TCID 50 during CPE development in cell culture is assessed. Alternatively, the reduction in the ability of the viral preparation to form plaques can be measured. There are three main ways to detect respiratory virus in the host serologically. Immunoassays, conducted in a manner similar to that described earlier for the detection of viral antigens, directly measure antibody-virus interaction through the use of labeled reagents. Complement fixation and passive agglutination assays are based on the ability of virus-antibody interactions to interfere with the functions discussed earlier, but do not allow differentiation between antibody classes. Finally, assays, such as hemagglutination inhibition, allow the measurement of particular antibodies that specifically interact with viral surface proteins. Advances in molecular biology continuously offer additional PCR-and hybridization-based methods. In a recent study, as few as 100 RNA copies of parainfluenza virus (or one TCID50) could be detected by probe hybridization and electrochemiluminescence or by using molecular beacons. 46 The first step in this approach, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, was used. This technique employs avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, together with ribonuclease H and T7 RNA polymerase, under isothermal conditions, and is able to directly amplify RNA. The use of nucleic acid sequences to amplify RNA with primers directed against the 5′ noncoding region of RV serotypes allows discrimination between RV subgroups. 47 Complementary DNA-amplified restriction fragment length polymorphism allows the identification of previously unknown viral sequences. In this method, double-stranded cDNA is synthesized from viral RNA and digested with frequently cutting restriction endonucleases. Double-stranded adaptors are then ligated to the ends of the emerging restriction fragments and provide primer sites during PCR amplification. A second selective fragment amplification step is conducted by adding one or more bases to the PCR primers. If the complementary bases are present in the viral sequence, then successful amplification will occur. A modification of this method was successfully employed in the recent discovery of the new coronavirus NL63. 10 Recently, Wang and colleagues used the powerful microarray technology to detect approximately 140 distinct viral genomes simultaneously, including most respiratory viruses. 48 To that end, 1600 oligonucleotides with a relatively greater length than those commonly used in array technology (70 vs. 20-25 bases) were selected after a genome-wide BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, a method for rapid searching of nucleotide and protein databases) analysis and ranked according to shared homology to regions of the viral genomes. Using an ink-jet oligonucleotide synthesizer, these oligonucleotides are synthesized in situ and placed onto directed locations of a glass wafer. 49 The glass surfaces can then be hybridized, under strict conditions, with cDNA, PCR amplicons, RNA, or another form of genetic material derived from viral stocks, virally infected cells in cultures, or clinical samples. Human and cellular transcripts are also included to normalize against nonspecific hybridization. This material is labeled with cyanin 5 or cyanin 3, which provides red or green coloring, respectively, to allow color visualization of microarray data that are obtained after the arrays are scanned with confocal laser scanners and analyzed with suitable instrumentation and software. This method allows the detection of paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, adenoviruses, and picornaviruses from clinical samples. It can also detect and discriminate among all 102 RV serotypes, based on the hybridization pattern obtained from each serotype. After human volunteers were experimentally infected with RV, the array could detect as few as 100 infectious RV particles in NPA samples. 48 Analysis of a small number of samples from naturally acquired colds showed different RV serotypes and parainfluenza 1 virus, which has also been confirmed by conventional reverse transcriptase PCR. Although it is extremely promising, this technique needs further evaluation, including cost-effectiveness, before being applied in clinical practice.
