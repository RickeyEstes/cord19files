protein expression and purification. Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 9817 TARG1 macrodomain (Uniprot code, C3WDV1) was cloned into the pSol-AFV vector (Lucigen, USA), using the synthetic FMAG_01619 gene obtained from Genscript (USA), and transformed into Escherichia coli 10G 57 . The clone containing the FmTARG1 was grown in 1 L of Terrific Broth (TB) medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg mL −1 ). When the culture reached an optical density of 4.5 at 600 nm, it was induced with 0.2% L-rhamnose for 16 h at 25 °C. The culture was centrifuged, and the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Bis-Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl). Cells were disrupted using a Bead Beater homogenizer (Biospec). After ultracentrifugation (40000 g, 40 min), the supernatant was loaded at 4 °C onto a HiPrep IMAC 16/10 FF column (GE Lifesciences, Spain) coupled to a FPLC chromatography system (ÄKTA Prime Plus, GE Lifesciences). The protein containing FmTARG1 fractions were pooled and desalted, before removing AFV-tag with a 6His-tag TEV protease. After a new chromatographic step onto the HisTrap FF column, the pure protein was loaded into a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/600 column (GE Lifesciences), obtaining an electrophoretically pure enzyme. In addition, the molecular mass of highly pure FmTARG1 was determined using an Agilent 1290 Infinity II Series HPLC coupled to an Agilent 6550 Q-TOF Mass Spectrometer 58 . FmTARG1was stored at −20 °C with 10% glycerol. Human TARG1 (Uniprot code Q9Y530) was also cloned using its corresponding synthetic gene, but inserted into pET28a vector (Merck, Spain), transformed into E. coli Rosetta2(DE3) and induced using 0.2 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) for 16 h at 20 °C with constant shaking. In this case, the purification protocol was the same as above except for using a single Ni 2+ -chelating affinity chromatographic step. The protein concentration was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad, Spain) and BSA as standard. Deacetylation assay. Macrodomain www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 4.6 × 250 mm, Phenomenex) and mobile phase running at 1 mL min −1 , following a linear gradient for 12 min from 0% MilliQ water with 0.015% TFA (solvent A) to 8% acetonitrile with 0.02% TFA (solvent B) 14 . The reactions were carried out in triplicate and their corresponding SD values were calculated. Commercial OAADPr (TRC, Canada) was used as a standard. De-MARylation assay. Human PARP1 E988Q mutant, an accepted model of mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP1 substrate 32 , was prepared by mutating the hPARP1vector (kindly provided by J. M. Pascal, Université de Montréal, Montréal, QC), as previously described 14 . NAD + -dependant automodification of hPARP1 E988Q mutant (2.1 μM) was carried out using PARP reaction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM DTT), 200 μM β-NAD + (Trevigen) and 17 μg activated DNA (Trevigen, UK) for 1 hour at 30 °C. The reaction was finished by adding Rupacarib (5 μM), a well-known PARP1 inhibitor. To the latter solution, FmTARG1 (8 μM) was added and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 °C, before placing it on ice. The released ADP-ribose was purified by ultrafiltration over Amicon Ultracel-3 column 59 , before analysis on an HPLC-MS equipment consisting of an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC coupled to an Agilent Ion Trap XCT Plus Mass Spectrometer using an electrospray (ESI) interface. Each sample (40 μL) was subjected to reversed-phase liquid chromatography on a C18 column (Discovery, 100 × 2.1 mm, Supelco) and eluted at 0.2 mL min −1 with a mobile phase A (0.05% TFA in MilliQ ® water) and B (0.05% TFA in acetonitrile) 90:10 (v/v) for 10 minutes followed by a linear gradient from 10 to 100% solvent B in 20 minutes. The column was re-equilibrated with mobile phase A for 10 minutes before a new run. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive mode with a capillary spray voltage of 3.5 kV. Data were obtained in the MS and MS/MS mode using MRM and processed using the DataAnalysis program for LC/MSD Trap Version 3.2 provided by the manufacturer. ADPr was detected as the [M + H] + ion at 560 m/z and confirmed with the transition 560 > 348 m/z. All the experiments were carried out in triplicate. De-pARylation assay. TARG1-type macrodomain PAR hydrolysis was determined by western blot 33 . The substrate used was automodified hPARP obtained as described above using NAD + and activated DNA as substrates and Rucaparib to stop the reaction. Then, this PARylated substrate was incubated for 1 hour at 30 °C in the presence of FmTARG1 (20 μM) or hTARG1 (10 μM), before running the samples on 7-10% SDS-PAGE gels and transfering to a nitrocellulose membrane. The presence of PAR was detected by coupling with rabbit polyclonal anti-PAR antibodies (1:1000, Trevigen) and goat-anti-rabbit-HRP conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad), and finally revealed with Opti-4CN substrate (Bio-Rad) for 5 minutes. Analysis of the reaction products of hTARG1 and FmTARG1 on poly (ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP1 was carried out by mass spectrometry as described above for the de-MARylation assay. thermal stability assay. Protein melting curves of FmTARG1 and hTARG1 were obtained in 7500 RT-PCR equipment (Applied Biosystems) using the 10X fluorescent dye SYPRO Orange (Molecular Probes), as previous described 60 . Both enzymes (10 µg) were preincubated in triplicate in the presence of 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and titrated with four different ligands (AMP, ADP, ADPr or OAADPr). The samples were slowly heated from 20 to 80 °C and the fluorescence was recorded every 1 °C at 530 nm.
