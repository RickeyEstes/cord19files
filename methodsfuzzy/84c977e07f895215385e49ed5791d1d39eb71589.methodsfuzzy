A recent report suggests that it is not necessary to carry out serological screening for multiple HBV markers, and that NAT based screening is preferred [58] . However, there is a risk that the practice of relying upon a single method of screening may lead to a higher incidence of false-negative results. In one case of transfusion-associated parvovirus B19 transmission, donated blood was screened for the presence of B19 antigen and deemed to be safe since no antigen was detected. Since the recipient subsequently developed B19 infection, the donation was re-analysed and found to contain B19 DNA [63] . Reports such as this support the argument for multiple parameter testing. The localisation of pathogens within blood may also influence ease of detection. For example, WNV is present at 10-fold higher levels in whole blood than in plasma in viraemic seropositive donors. The situation is reversed in viraemic seronegative donors, who display higher WNV levels (4-fold) in plasma than in whole blood [64] . Also, cellassociated viruses such as CMV and HTLV-1 are less frequently transmitted with the use of leukoreduced products [65, 66] , indicating that these viruses are less likely to be found in blood/plasma-derived products. The minimum infective dose (MID: the lowest number of pathogenic particles required to successfully infect a host) of a particular pathogen is more likely to be reached in whole blood or blood-derived components, making the use of plasma-derived or recombinant clotting factors the safest option.
