2.1. Nanoparticle Synthesis. The DNA coding for the nanoparticle constructs was prepared using standard molecular biology procedures. Shortly, plasmids containing the peptide monomers (Table 1) were constructed by cloning complementary oligonucleotides (CCCGGGGGGGCAGCGGC AGCCTGCTGACCGAAGTGGAAACCCCGACCCGCAAC-GGCTGGGAATAATGAATTC) encoding the avian M2e epitope with flanking residues (ARGGSGSLLTEVETPTRNGW-E * * E) into the XmaI/EcoRI restriction sites of the basic SAPN expression construct to yield Mono-M2e.
