The use of microbicides is an active area of research for the prevention of transmission of HIV. David Katz (Duke University, NC, USA) described how mathematical models may aid drug product design. For example, if it is assumed that the microbicide gel is 400 microns thick, the epithelium is 200 microns and the stroma (connective tissue) is 3000 microns and if the partition coefficient between gel and epithelium in known, then it is possible to model drug transfer and suggest how various other parameters, for example the size of the subject, may modify drug delivery. It is important that different disciplines work together, for example biophysicists with behavioral scientists. Biophysics can help an understanding of complex physical phenomena but human behavior can be both complex and highly variable.
