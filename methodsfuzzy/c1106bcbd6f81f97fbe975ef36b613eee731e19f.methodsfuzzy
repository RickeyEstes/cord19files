Reagents. Calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ), sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), disodium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous (Na 2 HPO 4 ), potassium phosphate monobasic (KH 2 PO 4 ) and 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethane-sulphonic acid (HEPES) were all Ultra grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Rabbit anti-S antibody was kindly provided by Prof. Ding Xiang Liu (Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Singapore Primers. Primers designed to encode S protein mutants are listed in Table 1 . Construction of clones containing S protein mutants. Based on plasmid pcDNA3.1-OPT9-S which contains codon-optimized S gene, a series of plasmids containing mutated S gene ( Fig. 1 and Table 2 ) were produced using QuickChange Ò II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR reaction contains 5 ll of 10Â reaction buffer, 3 ll (10 ng) of dsDNA template, 3 ll (125 ng) of primers (forward and reverse each, Table 1 ), 1 ll of dNTP mix and 3 ll of QuickSolution, 1 ll of PfuUltra HF DNA polymerase (2.5 U/ll), and 32 ll ddH 2 O. The amplification program was performed at 95°C, 1 min; 18 cycles of 95°C, 50 S; 60°C, 50 S; 68°C, 12 min; followed by a final elongation step at 68°C for 7 min. The PCR amplification products were digested by DpnI (1 ll of 10 U/ll DpnI in 50 ll amplification products) at 37°C for 1 h. The DpnI-treated DNA was transformed into XL10-Gold Ò Ultracompetent cells, and then the cells were grown on LB-ampicillin agar plates at 37°C for >16 h to produce clones. Transient expression of different mutants of S protein in 293T cells. 293T cells were grown to 80% confluence in 75 cm 2 flasks (Nunc), and after trypsinization with Trypsin-EDTA, cells were plated into 6-well plates (5 Â 10 5 cells/well) and cultured at 37°C, 5% CO 2 , overnight. The 293 T cells were transfected with plasmids pcDNA3.1-OPT9-S and S mutants using DOTAP transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 48 h of transfection, cells were collected, cell lysates were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and the expression of S protein and its mutants was investigated by Western blot using rabbit anti-S antibody as primary probe, and HRP-conjugated swine anti-rabbit antibody (DakoCytomation) as secondary probe. Preparation of pseudotyped SARS-CoV containing different S protein mutants. The pseudoviruses were generated by co-transfection of pNL4-3Luc + Env À Vpr À and pcDNA3.1-OPT9-S or S mutants into 293T cells using calcium phosphate transfection method. The culture supernatant containing virus was collected on day 2 and 3 after transfection and clarified by filtering it through a 0.45 lm-pore-size filter and concentrated. The virus titer was determined by the reverse transcriptase (RT) activity assay using EnzChek Ò reverse transcriptase assay kit (Molecular Probes), and the viruses were standardized according the RT assay. Single-cycle infectivity assay. Vero E6 cells (30,000 cells/well) were seeded in 48well plates and cultured at 37°C 5% CO 2 overnight. On the following day, Vero E6 cells were incubated with standardized amounts of pseudoviruses (0.5 U of RT/well) for 1 h and washed. After 48 h of infection, the cells were lysed in 100 ll lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined using luciferase assay kit (Promega). The resultant scintillation was counted for 15 s using a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Tuner Designs).
