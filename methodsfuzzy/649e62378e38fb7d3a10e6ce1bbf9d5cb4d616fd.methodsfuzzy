Nine nonsmoking patients with AR to birch pollen (mean age, 32 years; 3 male and 6 female patients) were included in the study. They were given diagnoses based on clinical history and RAST results for allergen-specific IgE. In addition, 20 healthy nonsmoking control subjects were included (mean age, 29 years; 5 male and 15 female subjects). RAST results for allergen-specific IgE were negative for all healthy control subjects included in the study. The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and all patients provided written informed consent.
