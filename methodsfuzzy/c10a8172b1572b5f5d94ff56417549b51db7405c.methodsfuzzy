HepG2, PH5CH8, Huh7, HeLa, HEK293 cells, and Gorilla gorilla fibroblasts were cultured in complete DMEM (cDMEM; Sigma-Aldrich) media containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (PSG; Mediatech). The cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Primary human hepatocytes (PHH) were purchased from Life Technologies and cultured according to the vendor's instructions. THP-1 cells were grown in complete RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, PSG, 10 mM HEP ES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1X nonessential amino acids (Mediatech), and 50 µM 2-mecaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich). MUTZ-3 cells were grown in MEMα containing nucleosides (Gibco), 20% FBS, and 10% conditioned medium from 5637 renal carcinoma cells. To differentiate myeloid cell lines into dendritic cells, THP-1 and MUTZ-3 cells were seeded at 0.2 × 10 6 cells/ml and cultured for 7 d in the presence of cyto-kines (for THP-1, 100 ng/ml GM-CSF and 100 ng/ml IL-4 in complete RPMI 1640; for MUTZ-3, 100 ng/ml GM-CSF, 10 ng/ml IL-4, and 2.5 ng/ml TNF in MEMα containing nucleosides, 20% FBS), with half the medium replaced every 3 d. Generation of IFn Lr1 −/− hepatocytes IFN LR1 targeting guide RNA (gRNA, 5′-GCT CTC CCA CCC GTA GAC GG-3′) was cloned downstream of the U6 promoter in the pRRLU6-empty-gRNA-MND-cas9-t2A-Puro vector using In-Fusion enzyme mix (Takara Bio, Inc.). Hepatocytes were transfected with either cas9-expressing or IFN LR1 gRNA-cas9-expressing plasmids. For transfection of Huh7 cells, 3 × 10 6 cells were seeded onto a 10-cm dish and 10 µg of plasmid was transfected using the CaPO 4 transfection kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, cells were preselected by addition of 2 µg/ml puromycin to the media for 2 d. To confirm successful gene targeting in preselected cells, genomic DNA was extracted from wt/cas9 control and IFN LR1 −/− cells (NucleoSpin Tissue; Takara Bio, Inc.) and subjected to T7 endonuclease I assay. Preselected cells were then single-cell sub-cloned and analyzed for IFN LR1 −/− knockout efficiency by checking for downstream activation of STAT1 and MX1 induction upon stimulation with IFNλ3. stimulations IFNβ was purchased from PBL and used at 100 IU/ml. IFNλ3 was purchased from R&D Systems and used at 100 ng/ml. Neutralizing IL-10R2 antibody (MAB874; R&D Systems) Figure 6 . IFnλ4 expression is suppressed during viral infections. IFNλ4p179 has similar antiviral properties as IFNλ3, signaling exclusively through the extracellular IFNλR1 and IL-10R2 heterodimer to activate STAT1 and induce ISGs. During viral infections, several mechanisms are in place that suppress the expression of the functional IFNL4 isoform compared with robust IFNL3 expression. was preincubated with cells at 2-6 µg/ml for 1 h before cytokine stimulation. Poly(I:C) (InvivoGen) was used at 1 µg/ml. The RIG-I ligand HCV 5′ppp RNA (HCV PAMP) was transcribed in vitro and used at 1 µg/ml. Both were transfected into cell lines using XtremeGene HP (Roche) or Mirus TransIT-X2 reagent (Mirus). Primary human hepatocytes were stimulated by adding 1 µg/ml poly(I:C) directly to the culture media. cloning and sequencing of IFnL4 isoforms We amplified IFNL4 from HepG2 cells stimulated with poly(I:C) for 12 h and the mRNA was amplified with IFNL4-cDNA fwd and IFNL4-cDNA rev primers (Table S2 ). The amplified products were cloned into a pCR2.1 TA-cloning vector (Invitrogen) and the inserts were sequenced. IFNL4P107, IFNL4P131, and IFNL4P179 were cloned into a C-terminal HA vector [pCMV-HA(c) pHOM-Mem1]. The three isoforms were amplified using the primers IFNL4-FL-HA-fwd and IFNL4-FL-HA-rev (Table S2 ) and cloned into the vector using EcoRI and SpeI restriction sites. To identify 3′ UTR lengths and sequences of endogenous IFNL4, 3′ RACE was performed based on the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). IFNL4-RACE-nest1 and IFNL4-RACE-nest2 forward primers (Table  S2) were used for 3′ RACE to amplify the 3′ UTR of IFNL4. The 3′ RACE products were cloned into a pCR2.1 TA-cloning vector and sequenced as above. rnA isolation, reverse transcription, and quantification of gene expression Total RNA was isolated using the NucleoSpin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg total RNA using the QuantiTect RT kit (QIA GEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. qPCR was performed using the ViiA7 qPCR system with TaqMan reagents (Life Technologies) using custom-made isoform-specific IFNL4 TaqMan probes (Table S2; IDT), IFNL3, IFNB, ACTB, HPRT, and ISGs MX1, OAS1, and ISG15 (Life Technologies). Gene expression levels were normalized to either ACTB or HPRT. Immunoblot analysis 30 µg of cell lysates, 10 µl supernatant, or 1 ml TCA precipitated supernatant from cell culture were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The membranes were then probed in 5% BSA in TBST (Tris-Buffered Saline and Tween-20) or 5% nonfat milk in TBST for IFNλ4 (4G1; Millipore), phospho-STAT1 (Y701; 58D6; Cell Signaling Technology), STAT1 (42H3, Cell Signaling Technology), HA (6E2; Cell Signaling Technology) or β-actin (13E5; Cell Signaling Technology).
