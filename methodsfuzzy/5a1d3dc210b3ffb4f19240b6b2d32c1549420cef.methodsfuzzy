The purpose of analysing research methods is to understand the methodological applications for academic studies in the examined research field. For the 115 papers selected in this study, 82 of them used quantitative methods to gather primary data. Additionally, 33 papers adopted qualitative methods (Table 5) . Among papers with qualitative methods, in-depth interview was used in 8 papers which made it more popular than other methods in this category. For quantitative papers, questionnaire surveys were dominant (43 papers) and archival data (26 papers) represented the second most frequent quantitative method arrangement in all the papers. In terms of data analysis methods, 51 papers (44.35%) used descriptive discussion, 8 papers (6.96%) adopted content analysis, and 56 papers (48.70%) used statistical analyses. Table 6 indicates specific statistical techniques used in quantitative papers. Commonly adopted statistical methods/techniques in all the 115 papers included correlation test, regressions, ANOVA, T-test and factor analysis. A small number of papers used sophisticated statistical methods/techniques such as structural equation modelling (SEM). Some simple methods, such as frequencies, cross-tabs, chi-squares, and means were grouped under one category of basic techniques compared with other statistical techniques. In relation to the research methods, paper types were also examined which are shown in Table 7 . Empirical papers accounted for 71.3% of all the papers, conceptual papers made up of 21.73% and there were also eight case studies which comprised 6.95%. Although the number of empirical papers far outweighs that of the other two types, it is not suggested that empirical papers are better than conceptual papers and case studies. All three types of papers can address academic problems from different aspects if they are effectively designed and used.
