The case-control study was based on a slaughterhouse-based screening, conducted in June to August 1994, of slaughterswine producing herds. Samples from 525 batches of slaughterpigs were obtained from 8 slaughterhouses (Blans. Esbjerg, Heming, &by, Horsens. Odense, Ringsted and Renne), representing most parts of Denmark. The slaughterhouses volunteered to chose herds that represented different geographical regions, and from selected herds we blood sampled 6 pigs from a batch (due to practical constraints, no systematical randomization could be attempted). Serum samples were tested using an ELISA method. originally described by Albina et al. (1992) . The test has been modified by using a Danish isolate of PRRS-virus for the production of antigen in porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophage cultures. Sixty-eight herds from 86 seropositive batches (2 1 seropositive pig), for which herd identification could be satisfactorily obtained were defined as cases. 128 herds with no seropositive pigs were defined as controls. The case:control ratio was set at 1:2 for each slaughterhouse whenever possible, but otherwise no matching was performed. The same veterinarian performed all interviews via telephone. Neither the veterinarian nor the herd owner was aware of the herd status (as case or control) at the time of the interview. The questionnaire (data obtained listed in Tables I and 2) was administered from June to August 1994. A modified herd size measure, the number of 'heat producing units' (HPU), was used in the statistical analysis. An HPU (1 HPU = 1000 W at 20Â°C) is an estimate of the heat loss at various temperatures, and hence the ventilation requirement (Strom, 1978) . The formula used was HPU = 0.17 X (fatteners > 25 kg) + 0.45 X (sows) + 0.30 X (boars). HPU was transformed by the natural logarithm to obtain an approximately normally distributed variable. Herds were categorized according to specific pathogen free (SPF) diseases. In the Danish system, herds are free from Actirzobncilluspleuropneumoniue (several serotypes), Mycoplusma hyopneumoniae, toxin producing Pasteurella multocida, Serpulina hyodywnteriae, lice and mange. An MS-herd is a herd with SPF status but infected with M. hvopneumoniae. All herds were free from Aujeszky's disease (Pseudorabies) (Christensen et al., 1990) . 98 herds were detected as customers in the cooperative artificial insemination company. For these, the numbers of AI doses received from 1 October 1993 to 30 April 1994 were calculated. The herd-level risk analyses assessed the odds of PRRS seropositivity as functions of several risk factors, using the procedure PROC LOGISTIC (SAS Institute Inc., 19891, by fitting multiple logistic regression models. Four models were evaluated (Table la-d) . Each model was tested in a forward as well as a backward stepwise selection process, with P for entry into or removal from the model set at 0.15, employing a likelihood-ratio test at each step. In the resulting model, the significance of slaughterhouse was tested similarly. Significance of the remaining effects were evaluated by Wald's test, odds ratio (OR) values calculated as e p, with 95% confidence intervals of the OR as e' p k '.96SEP ). (In herds with regular production of fattening pigs, the two variables 'feeder-to-finish .I. Mousing et al. / Veterinan, Microbiology 55 (19Y7) 323-328 Table  A herds. Frequency of reported herd health problems among cases and controls. Logistic regression a based odds ratio values for reporting health problem when PRRS seropositive, corrected for possible herd-size (In (HPU) herd' (relative to farrow-to-finish) and 'purchase of 25 kg pigs' (yes/no) were strongly correlated, so only the latter variable was included in the modelling procedure.) The analyses of reported herd health problems assessed the odds of each problem as functions of ln(HPU). SPF/MS or conventional status, and PRRS seropositive or -negative status. However, the analyses were restricted to problems reported in 2 10 herds. For each group of herds, two (Table 2a) and six (Table 2b ) models were evaluated. A stepwise selection process as previously described was used.
