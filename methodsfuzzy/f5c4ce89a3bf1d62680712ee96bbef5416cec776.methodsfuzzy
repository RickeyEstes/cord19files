Facemasks and respirators were considered an effective approach of preventing respiratory infections. Most participants described facemasks/respirators as the "only" and the "best protection" method available to protect HCWs from respiratory infections. Participants had mixed views on the level of protection afforded by the various types of products available, however. N95 respirators were considered the most effective, although most nurses emphasized that they had never used N95 respirators in their workplace, whereas some doctors remarked that N95 respirators were only available during emergencies. Both medical and cloth masks were described as being "comfortable" and "easy to breathe through." Medical masks were associated with being "safe," "effective," "airy," and "clean," whereas cloth masks were "soft" and "cheap." Some of the negative aspects associated with medical masks included that they are "expensive" and can be "saturated with sweat," whereas cloth masks are "difficult to tie" and "dirty." There is a perception that medical masks are of better quality than cloth masks, despite the fact that medical masks are not subject to regulatory standards in Vietnam. "I think medical masks protect more than cloth masks because they are made according to medical standards" (physician). Wearing multiple facemasks was reportedly a common practice among HCWs. Participants reported that wearing 2 or 3 medical masks together (on top of one another) is not unusual. However, this practice is dependent on the type and availability of facemasks on the ward. Perceived thickness of the layer of facemask protection appeared to be an important factor. "Medical masks are costly, so they are often used limitedly. If the hospital can supply you with 5 fabric (cloth) masks a day, would you like them more than the disposable ones?" (nurse). "I prefer medical mask because it makes me easy to breathe. If I need to use cloth mask for a long time in the emergency case, I feel very uncomfortable" (nurse). "I feel that N95 respirator is too stuffy. Sometimes, I am afraid of infection from the patients so I have to wear two facemasks together but then I feel stuffy" (physician). Issues around the type and availability of facemasks "Availability" of facemasks in the hospitals was the strongest theme to emerge from the focus group sessions. Participants emphasized that it is not unusual for some types of facemasks to be unavailable during nonemergency periods. A shortage of facemasks was reported in many hospitals by both physicians and nurses. The type of product used is extremely dependent on what is provided by the hospital. Medical masks are not always available, and in some instances only cloth masks are supplied to HCWs. At some sites, participants spoke of receiving only 3 cloth masks per year, with staff members responsible for "decontaminating" them after each use. "The hospital now stops providing medical mask. Sometimes, we ask, but they don't provide" (physician). "The facemask is not enough for the staff, especially in the morning that is crowded of patients" (nurse). "When the medical masks are finished, I use cloth masks" (nurse). It was reported that N95 respirators are not routinely supplied in most hospitals or are provided to HCWs only in emergency department (ED) and intensive care units (ICUs) or in limited quantities during outbreaks and epidemics. "N95 masks are in limited supply, so we seldom use them. We can't afford to change several N95 respirators a day. Because of inadequate supply, we aren't really interested in using them, except those who are very much conscious of their health and safety, so they are wearing N95s most of the time" (physician). "Self-purchase" was an important subtheme related to facemask availability. In some settings, owing to the limited supplies of facemasks provided by hospitals, staff members reported buying their own supplies from local stores. Medical masks were the most common type reportedly purchased by HCWs, whereas extra cloth masks were purchased by some. In some instances, HCWs reported being unable to afford to buy extra facemasks themselves owing to low salaries and they need to rely on what was provided by the hospitals. Some participants mentioned pharmaceutical companies as another source of facemasks and respirators. "We want to wear facemasks regularly, but the quantity is not enough so we have to buy with our own money" (physician). "Cloth masks are provided by hospital, while we buy medical masks with our own money" (nurse).
