Considering the analytes of interest are relatively polar, aqueous methanol was predicted and found to be a suitable extraction solvent. Extraction conditions including extraction method (reflux or ultrasonication), number of extractions (1, 2 or 3), methanol concentration (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% v/v) and extraction time (20, 40 and 60 min) were investigated to give the maximum number of peaks in the HPLC fingerprint. Finally, the extraction method presented in Section 2.2 was selected.
