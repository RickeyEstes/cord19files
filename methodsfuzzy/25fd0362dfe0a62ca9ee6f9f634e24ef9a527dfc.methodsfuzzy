Analysis of the a-fucosidase expression S.solfataricus cells were grown, and cell extracts obtained, as described previously (24, 28) . The expression in the E.coli strain BL21(RB791) of the wild-type gene fucA1 and of the mutant genes fucA1 A [previously named FrameFuc in (24) ], fucA1 B , fucA1 sm and fucA1 tm as fusions of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the purification of the recombinant proteins were performed as reported previously (23) . The nomenclature used in this paper for the different a-fucosidase genes is listed in Table 1 . For the western blot studies, equal amounts of E.coli cultures expressing the wild-type and mutant fucA1 genes, normalized for the OD 600 , were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 0.03 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, 3% SDS (w/v), 6.7% glycerol (w/v), 6.7% 2-mercaptoethanol (w/v) and 0.002% blue bromophenol (w/v). The samples were incubated at 100 C for 5 min (unless otherwise indicated) and were directly loaded on to the gel. Western blot analyses were performed by blotting SDS-PAGEs of the concentrations indicated on Hybond-P polyvinylidenfluorid filters (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden); polyclonal anti-Ssa-fuc antibodies from rabbit (PRIMM, Milan, Italy) and anti-GST antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were diluted 1:5000 and 1:40 000, respectively. The filters were washed and incubated with the ImmunoPure anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from Pierce Biotechnology (Rockford, IL, USA). Filters were developed with the ECL-plus Western Blotting Detection system (Amersham Biosciences) by following the manufacturer's indications. The molecular weight markers used in the western blot analyses were the ECL streptavidin-HRP conjugate (Amersham Biosciences). The protein concentration of the samples was measured with the method of Bradford (29) and the amounts of sample loaded on to the SDS-PAGEs are those indicated. The quantification of the bands identified by western blot was performed by using the program Quantity One 4.4.0 in a ChemiDoc EQ System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with the volume analysis tool. The frameshifting efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the intensity of the bands of the frameshifted product/frameshifted product + termination product. The mutants in the slippery sequence of the wild-type gene fucA1 were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis from the vector pGEX-11867/3060, described previously (24, 27) . The synthetic oligonucleotides used (PRIMM) were the following: FucA1sm-rev, 5 0 -TTTAGGTGATATTGGTGTT-CTGGTCTATCT-3 0 ; FucA1sm-fwd, 5 0 -GAACACCAATAT-CACCTAAAGAATTCGGCCCA-3 0 ; FucA1tm-rev, 5 0 -AGG-TGATATTGGTGTTCTGGTCTATCTGGC-3 0 ; FucA1tm-fwd, 5 0 -CCAGAACACCAATATCACCTCAAGAACTCGGCCCA-GT-3 0 , where the mismatched nucleotides in the mutagenic primers are underlined. Direct sequencing identified the plasmids containing the desired mutations and the mutant genes, named fucA1 sm and fucA1 tm , were completely re-sequenced.
