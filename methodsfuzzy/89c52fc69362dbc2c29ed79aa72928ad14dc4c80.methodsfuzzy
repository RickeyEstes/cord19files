Cells, viruses, and animals. HEK 293A and HEK 293 T cells represent two different subclones of the parental 293 cell line originated from human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. HuH-7 cell is a hepatocyte carcinoma cell line originally derived from a liver tumor. All these cell lines were purchased from ATCC and maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and incubated at 37°C under 5% CO 2 . The MERS-CoV S protein gene sequence (Gen-Bank number JX869059) was optimized for expression in adenoviral vectors and chemically synthesized (Genscript, China). The mouse-adapted strain of MERS-CoV was generated as previously described and used at the University of Iowa [39] . Six-week old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd (licensed by Charles River) and housed in specific pathogen free (SPF) mouse facilities. SPF human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP-KI) mice were generated as previously described [39] at the University of Iowa. The hDPP4-KI mice were lightly anesthetized using isoflurane and intranasally infected with a lethal dose Construction of recombinant adenoviral vectors. The MERS-CoV codon-optimized S gene (MERS-S) was cloned into pShuttle-MERS-S and digested with I-CeuI and PI-SceI to release the MERS-S fragment with CMV promoter. The extended fragment containing the MERS-S fragment was separated in agarose gel and inserted into the I-CeuI/PI-SceI sites of pAdC68 to generate pAdC68-MERS-S. Rescue, amplification, and purification of recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus. The type of AdC68 used in our study is a replication deficient chimpanzee adenovirus due to the deletion of the E1 domain in the viral genome. The defective form could only be rescued by the E1 protein expressed and supplied by the HEK 293A cell line. Specifically, HEK 293A cells were seeded on a 6-well plate 1 day before transfection. Cells were cultured overnight to 80-85% confluency at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1× penicillin-streptomycin solution. pAdC68-MERS-S was linearized with PacI and then transfected into HEK 293A cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The rescued replication deficient recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus AdC68-S virus was further amplified in HEK 293A cells which were stably integrated with the E1 expression gene. Viruses were purified by a round of CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation followed by desalting with Bio-Gel P-6 DG Media (Bio-Rad, USA). Similarly, the empty AdC68 was generated without any target gene inserted into the vector and purified as described above. Detection of MERS-CoV S expression. HEK 293 T cells infected by AdC68-S or AdC68 virus were used to detect MERS-CoV S expression by Western Blot and by surface staining using flow cytometry. Specifically, HEK 293 T cells were seeded on a 6-well plate one day before transfection, grown to the log phase and infected with either AdC68-S or AdC68 virus at varying doses of 10 8 , 10 9 , and 10 10 vps/well. Twentyfour hours post-infection, cells were harvested and lysed in 100ul RIPA buffer containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors. Western blots to detect the expression of the MERS-CoV spike protein were run with an anti-MERS-CoV S1 polyclonal antibody (Sino Biological, China). β-Actin immunoblotting was included as a control. Proteins extracted from HEK 293T cells infected with AdC68 viruses were used as a negative control. For cell surface analysis, our previously isolated three monoclonal antibodies (MERS-4, MERS-27, and MERS-GD27) specific for MERS-CoV S were used to stain AdC68-S or AdC68 virus infected cells at 100nM. One hour later, cells were washed and stained with the secondary antibody Anti-human IgG-PE (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) at 1:200. One hour later, cells were washed again and analysed by BD Calibur Facs cytometer (BD, USA). Antibody 17b, specific for human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1), was used as a negative control. Immunization and sample collection. A total of two batches of animals were immunized. In Batch I, mice were randomly distributed into twelve groups (n = 5 per group) and vaccinated with varying doses of recombinant vaccine candidates, control viruses, and control PBS via either intramuscular (i.m.) or intranasal (i.n.) route as described in Figure 2 (A). Mouse sera were harvested every 2 weeks until the 40th week. In Batch II, mice were randomly distributed into four groups (n = 5 per group) and vaccinated with 10 9 vps by i.m. or i.n. route as described in Figure 2 (A). Mouse sera were harvested every 2 weeks until the 14th week. Three mice from each group were sacrificed 14 weeks after immunization and their spleens were harvested for cytokines release analysis. The sera were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 min before analysed for MERS-CoV S1 specific antibodies. Antibody subclass and T cell responses in immunized animals. MERS-CoV S1 specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgA antibody responses were detected by ELISA. Briefly, serially diluted mouse sera were added to 96well microtiter plates pre-coated with MERS-S1 protein produced in HEK 293 T cells (100 ng/well). Plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 h and washed 3 times with PBST before incubated with either horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:5000, Promega), IgG1(1:40,000, Abcam), IgG2a(1:40,000, Abcam), or IgA (1:40,000, Abcam) at 37°C for 1 h. Samples were washed 3 times in PBST (Phosphate Buffer Saline-Tween 20). TMB (3 ′ ,3 ′ ,5 ′ ,5 ′ -Tetramethyl Benzidine) was then added to the plates and the reaction was stopped by adding 1M H 2 SO 4 . Absorbance was read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader. The ED50 value was calculated based on binding curves drawn in GraphPad (GraphPad Software Inc). To evaluate antigen-specific T-cell responses, 1 × 10 6 splenocytes per well were stimulated by 1 μM MERS-CoV peptide S291 for 24 h. Secreted TNFα and IL-2 in the culture supernatant were analysed by TNFα/IL-2 ELISA kits (Dakewe, China). Epitope mapping through competitive binding between antibodies. Antibodies 1A8, 1C11, 1D5, and 2C1 were first labelled with biotin. Then, antibodies MERS-4, MERS-27, 17b, MERS-GD27, 1A8, 1C11, 1D5, and 2C1 were serially diluted three-fold before biotin-labelled antibody (50 μl) was added at fixed concentrations. The mixture of antibodies was applied to S1 protein-coated plates, and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After thorough wash with PBST, 250 ng/ml of streptavidin-HRP (Sigma, USA) were added and incubated at ambient temperature for 30 min before developed with substrate TMB as described above. Pseudovirus and live virus neutralization assay. Neutralizing titres of the immunized mouse sera were determined using a previously reported MERS-CoV pseudovirus and live virus assay [16] . For pseudovirus assay, sera samples were serially diluted 3-fold in 96-well cell culture plates before MERS-CoV pseudovirus was added and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The number of 1.5 × 10 4 Huh7 cells were then added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 72 h. The neutralization results were measured in luciferase activity in relative light units (Vigorous, China). For live virus assay, sera samples were collected as described above and serially diluted in 48-well cell culture plates. MERS-CoV/MERS-CoV-MA was added to each well and incubated at 37°f or 1 h before added to 12-well plates pre-coated with Vero E81 cells and incubated at 37°C for 3 days. The neutralization titres were determined by crystal violet staining. Lung virus titres. To determine lung virus titres, hDPP4-KI mice infected with MERS-CoV-MA were euthanized at 4-days post-challenge. Lungs were removed after transcardial perfusion with PBS and homogenized in PBS. Viral titres were determined on Vero E81 cells and represented as plaque-forming units (PFU)/lung. Cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet at 3 d.p.i. Sequence analysis and statistics. Sequence alignments were performed with BioEdit (BioEdit Software Inc). Phylogenetic analysis was generated using program MEGA (MEGA Software Inc). Half-maximal inhibitory dilutions (ID50) and half-maximal effective dilutions (ED50) were calculated for each serum using GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software Inc). IC50 for monoclonal antibodies were estimated by GraphPad. Data were expressed by means or means ± standard deviations and significance in their differences were analysed using Student's t-test. Statistical significance for survival studies was calculated using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results are graphs with mean ± SEM.
