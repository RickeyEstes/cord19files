A set of 14 different genomic sequences of SARS_CoV were collected using the NCBI [11] databases. The genomic regions codifying for the spike glycoprotein were identified from these sequences by using ORFfinder search [11] . The corresponding aminoacid sequences were aligned and, with the use of ClustalW v. 1.7 [12] , 99-100% pairwise sequence identities were obtained. Then, a consensus sequence obtained from this alignment was used to find a subset of homologous S glycoprotein sequences of other coronaviruses using Psi-Blast v. 2.1 [11] . Some of these sequences were chosen for secondary structure prediction and fold recognition studies, using PsiPred v.2.1 [13] and GenTHREADER [14] [17] classification of names and numbers was made. Model building of S1 and S2 subunits of SARS S glycoprotein was carried out with the ClustalW [12] alignment between the target sequence and that of the template structure. Models were subsequently optimised according to secondary structure predictions. Substitution of aminoacid residues and modelling of insertions and deletions in the target structure were performed using SwissPDBViewer software [18] . The 3D models were optimised by a 900 step minimisation run with AMBER [19] and finally validated with the PROCHECK v. 3.5.4 procedure [20] . Surface accessibility of the potential glycosylation site, mutation distribution, and localisation of CD13 binding regions were analysed by using MOLMOL software [21] . With the same software possible disulphide bridge formations were investigated by considering a threshold distance of 10 A A between Ca atoms of cysteine couples, after the prediction of the bonding/non-bonding state of all the cysteine present in S1 and S2 sequences [22] . The hydropathy profile of the protein was calculated according to Kyte and Doolittle plots [23] and hydrophilic/hydrophobic potentials were calculated with GRID [24] , using a grid resolution of 1 A A and the standard "OH2" and "DRY" probes.
