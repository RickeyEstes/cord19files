Biosafety and ethics statement. All animal procedures were approved by the CDC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at an AAALAC-accredited facility (38) . Procedures conducted with LASV-, CCHFV-, or CCHFV-infected animals were performed in biosafety level 4 facilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA). Experiments involving cDNA encoding viral sequences were performed in accordance with approved Institutional Biosafety Committee protocols. Cells. Huh7, A549, A549 RIG-I KO, BSR-T7/5, and HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% to 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 100 U/ml antibiotics. BSR-T7/5 cells were a gift from K. K. Conzelmann (Ludwig-Maximilian-Universität, Munich, Germany). A549-dual RIG-I knockout cells were obtained from InvivoGen. Viruses. Recombinant IbAr10200 CCHFV was generated as previously described (GenBank accession no. KJ648914, KJ648915, and KJ648913) (8, 39) . Briefly, Huh7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the full-length L, M, and S genome segments under the control of a T7 promoter and with helper plasmids expressing CCHFV NP, codon-optimized L protein, and T7 polymerase. Viruses with mutated OTUs were generated by adding point mutations to the pT7-L plasmids using site-directed mutagenesis before virus rescue. ZsGreen1-expressing reporter CCHFV, which was described previously (26) , contains the ZsGreen1 coding sequence fused to NP, separated by a P2A sequence. NanoLucexpressing CCHFV was generated using the same cloning strategy. The recombinant LASV reporter (LASV-ZsG) was described previously (40) . All recombinant viruses were verified with deep-sequencing technology using a MiniSeq system (Illumina). Virus infectivity was measured by titration in BSR-T7/5 cells either by the use of ZsG as a readout or by the use of immunofluorescence with anti-CCHFV polyclonal antibodies (hyperimmune mouse ascetic fluid [generated in-house]), and the median 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) was determined. Animal experiments. Female B6.129S2-Ifnar1 tm1Agt /Mmjax mice (MMRRC 032045-JAX) were housed in a climate-controlled laboratory with a 12-h day/12-h night cycle. All animals were given sterile water and food ad libitum and were group housed (4/cage) on autoclaved corn cob bedding (Bed-o'Cobs; Anderson Lab Bedding) (1/4 in. thick) in an isolator-caging system (Thoren Caging, Inc., Hazleton, PA, USA) with a HEPA-filtered inlet and exhaust air supply. The cage environment was enriched with shredded paper and cotton nestlets. To assess the various CCHFV mutant viruses, animals (6.5 weeks of age, 8 mice per group) were inoculated subcutaneously in the interscapular region with 10 2 TCID 50 of CCHFV diluted in DMEM. Mice were humanely euthanized at the indicated time points or when clinical illness scores based on piloerection, decreased activity, neurological signs (e.g., ataxia, paresis/paralysis), dehydration, dyspnea, and/or weight loss (Ͼ20% from baseline at Ϫ1 dpi) indicated that the animal was in distress or in the terminal stages of disease. Differences in weight change from baseline according to day postinfection and survival were statistically analyzed by multiple t tests, with significance determined using the Holm-Sidak method (␣ ϭ 0.05) and the log rank (Mantel-Cox) test, respectively (GraphPad Prism 8). Quantitative RT-PCR. Nucleic acids were extracted from blood and homogenized tissues using MagMax technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a 96-well ABI MagMAX extraction platform. RNA was quantified using one-step real-time PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the IbAr10200 nucleoprotein gene sequence (primer and probe sequences available on request), and data were normalized to 18S RNA levels. Viral S segment copy numbers were determined using standards prepared from S segment RNA transcribed in vitro. TR-FRET. UbV-CC4 and the unmodified UbV-AA control have been described previously (28) . The genes were synthesized and inserted into a pcDNA3 vector. Both variants contain an N-terminal 6ϫHis tag and a FLAG tag. The OTU domain (amino acids 1 to 168) was synthesized and cloned into pcDNA3.1 containing a C-terminal HA tag (all from GenScript). Protein-protein interactions were examined using time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET). HEK293T cells were seeded in 10-cm 2 dishes (5 ϫ 10 6 ) and transfected with pcDNA-V5-OTU (wt or C40A) and with pcDNA-FLAG-UbV-CC4, pcDNA-HA-Ub, or pcDNA-eGFP. Two days posttransfection, cells were harvested in Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 ) and clarified by centrifugation (1 min at 13,000 rpm). Lysates were incubated at room temperature with TR-FRET donor/ acceptor pairs. To examine the interaction of V5-OTU with HA-Ub, lysates were incubated with anti-V5-Eu (donor) and anti-HA-d2 (acceptor). To examine the interaction of V5-OTU with FLAG-CC4, lysates were incubated with anti-V5-Eu (donor; Perkin Elmer) and anti-FLAG M2-d2 (acceptor; Cisbio). Fluorescence transfer was determined using a Synergy 4 plate reader (Bio-Tek) and calculated as the ratio of donor excitation to acceptor excitation. Coimmunoprecipitation. HEK293T cells were seeded in 10-cm 2 dishes (5 ϫ 10 6 ) and transfected with the indicated plasmids. If necessary, the total amount of plasmid DNA was supplemented with pcDNA-eGFP. All transfections were performed using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) following the manufacturer's instructions. After 2 to 3 days, cells were harvested and lysed in Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 ). Clarified supernatants were incubated with anti-HA, anti-FLAG, or anti-V5 magnetic beads (1.5 h at 4°C) and washed with high-salt Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 500 mM NaCl). Proteins were eluted from the beads by adding 2ϫ Laemmli sample buffer and heating the sample at 50°C for 10 min. Proteins were subsequently separated on 4% to 12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a transblot system (Bio-Rad). OTU Blockage with Ubiquitin Inhibits CCHFV Infection ® Western blotting and antibodies. Cell lysates were harvested in 2ϫ Laemmli sample buffer and heated for 10 min at 95°C. Proteins were subsequently separated on 4% to 12% Bis-Tris or Tris-acetate SDS-PAGE gels and were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a transblot system (Bio-Rad). The following antibodies were used in this study: CCHFV anti-NP (04-0011; IBT BioServices) and anti-V5 (R960CUS), anti-HA (71-5500), and anti-FLAG (32-6700) (all Thermo Fisher). Tubulin (T5169; Sigma) was used as a loading control marker. Primary antibodies were detected with SuperSignal West Dura Fast Western blot kits (Thermo Fisher). Protein bands were visualized using a ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-Rad). OTU activity in transfected cells. OTU activity was determined by cotransfecting Huh7 cells with pcDNA-HA-Ub (DUB assay) or with the following plasmids encoding proteins required for ISGylation: pcDNA-Ube1L, pcDNA-UbCH8, pcDNA-NTAP-HERC5 (J. Huibregtse, University of Texas at Austin), and pcDNA-V5-hISG15 (GenScript). To assess the effect of the UbV on OTU activity, pcDNA-eGFP, pcDNA-FLAG-AA, or pcDNA-FLAG-CC4 was cotransfected with a plasmid expressing CCHFV-OTU. All plasmid transfections were performed using Trans-IT LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus). Ub and ISG15 conjugation levels were determined 48 h posttransfection by Western blotting. RIG-I luciferase reporter assay. The RIG-I-mediated IFN-␤ response was assessed by cotransfecting Huh7 cells with a plasmid encoding RIG-I CARD (S. Best, Rocky Mountain Laboratories) and a reporter plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under the control of the IFN-␤ promoter (p125-luc; T. Fujita, Kyoto University). A plasmid constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase was used for transfection normalization. Plasmids encoding the CCHFV OTU and the ubiquitin variants were cotransfected to assess their effect on the RIG-I-mediated IFN-␤ response. Firefly activity and Renilla luciferase activity were quantified using a Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega) in combination with a Synergy 4 plate reader (Bio-Tek). Inhibition of in vitro OTU activity. Nairovirus OTUs were expressed and purified as previously described (30) . UbV-CC4 in vector pET-15b was transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells and grown to an optical density (OD) of 0.6 to 0.8. Expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG (isopropyl-␤-D-thiogalactopyranoside) at 18°C overnight. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 ϫ g for 10 min and stored at Ϫ80°C. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A (75 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium acetate, 25 mM HEPES [pH 6.8]) supplemented with 5 mg of lysozyme at 4°C for 30 min. The cells were lysed by sonication at 50% power with a 50% duty cycle for 6 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 48,000 ϫ g, and the supernatants were pooled and filtered through a 0.8-m-pore-size filter. The clarified lysate was poured over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column (Gold Biotechnology, Olivette, MO) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of buffer A supplemented with 10 mM imidazole, followed by protein elution with buffer A supplemented with 300 mM imidazole. The eluate was subsequently filtered through a 0.2-m-pore-size filter and further purified by size exclusion using a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer B (100 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES [pH 7.2], 2 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]). Samples of fractions containing the absorbance peaks were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing pure UbV-CC4 were pooled and concentrated and then subsequently flash-frozen in 5% glycerol and stored at Ϫ80°C. Reactions to determine the inhibitory effects of UbV-CC4 on different OTUs were performed at 25°C using a CLARIOstar plate reader (BMG Labtech). The reactions were run with a total volume of 30 l in a mixture containing 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mM DTT, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA) with 4 nM OTU and 1 M ubiquitin 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Ub-AMC; Boston Biochem, MA). Each OTU was tested in triplicate against UbV-CC4 concentrations ranging from 3.9 nM to 5 M. OTUs were incubated with UbV-CC4 for 2 min, and the reactions were initiated by adding Ub-AMC and were monitored by the increase in fluorescence. Reaction rates were determined using the linear portion of the curves, percent inhibition was calculated, and IC 50 and related errors were determined using the SigmaPlot 12 enzyme kinetics module utilizing Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Systat Software, Inc.). UbV-expressing stable cell lines. Cells stably expressing UbV-AA or UbV-CC4 were generated using lentiviruses. First, Gateway technology was used to transfer the UbV genes into pSCRPSY lentiviral vectors containing red fluorescent protein (RFP) and a puromycin resistance gene (C. Rice, The Rockefeller University, NY). Lentivirus was generated by transfecting Lenti-X 293 cells (Clontech) with packaging vectors expressing vesicular stomatitis virus protein G (VSV-G), pPAX2-HIV-gag (Addgene), and pSCRPSY-FLAG-UbV using XtremeGene9 (Roche). After 3 days, supernatants were collected, centrifuged 5 min at 1,000 ϫ g, and filtered through a 0.45-m-pore-size filter. HEPES and Polybrene were added to reach final concentrations of 20 mM and 4 g/ml, respectively. Lentiviruses were stored at Ϫ80°C until further use. Stable A549 and A549-RIG-I KO cell lines were generated by puromycin selection after transduction. Minigenome assay. The CCHFV minigenome assay used here was described previously (41) . Briefly, the CCHFV minigenome encodes the NanoLuc gene flanked by CCHFV noncoding regions under the control of a T7 polymerase. To analyze RdRp activity, Huh7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the minigenome, CCHFV NP, codon-optimized CCHFV L, T7 polymerase, and a firefly luciferase transfection control (pRL3; Promega) using Transit-LT1 (Mirus). After 48 h, luciferase activity was assessed using a Nano-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega) to detect NanoLuc signal or a luciferase assay system (Promega) to detect firefly luciferase signal. All luminescence readings were carried out using a Synergy 4 plate reader (Bio-Tek). CCHFV minigenome RNA levels were analyzed by extracting RNA from transfected Huh7 cells using MagMAX RNA isolation reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific). CCHFV minigenome RNA was quantified using a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay targeting NanoLuc (Integrated DNA Technologies; primer and probe sequences available on request) and normalized to a housekeeping gene (IPO8; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Virus-like particle (VLP) assay. Generation of CCHF VLPs has been described previously (41) . Briefly, Huh7 cells were transfected with the same plasmid combination as was used in the minigenome assay, with the addition of a plasmid expressing codon-optimized GPC. VLP-containing supernatant was harvested 3 days posttransfection and transferred to A549 cells stably expressing UbV-CC4 or UbV-AA. NanoLuc activity was determined the next day as a measure of VLP activity.
