We used crowdsourced reports from DXY.cn, a Chinese online community network for physicians, health care professionals, pharmacies and healthcare facilities established in 2000 8 . An online platform provides real-time coverage of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China, obtained by collating and curating reports from news media, government TV, national and provincial health agencies. The information reported includes time-stamped cumulative case counts of 2019-nCoV, outbreak maps, and real-time streaming of health authority announcements in Chinese (directly or through state media) 9 . Every report is linked to an on-line source, which can be followed through for more detailed information on individual cases. We closely monitored updates on DXY.cn between Jan 20, 2020 and Jan 30, 2020 to extract key information on individual patients in near real-time, as well as daily reported case counts. For individual-level patient information, we used descriptions from the original source in Chinese to retrieve age, gender, province of identification, travel history, reporting date, date of symptom onset and hospitalization, and discharge status, when available. Individual level data were formatted into a line-list database for further quantitative analysis. Individual-level patient data were entered from DXY.cn by a native Chinese speaker (KS), who also generated an English summary for each case. Entries were doubled checked by a second person (JC). Since DXY.cn primarily provides information on cases reported in China, we also compiled additional information on internationally exported cases from global news media. Further, we reconstructed the daily progression of reported cases in each province of China from Jan 18, 2020 to Jan 30, 2020. We used the daily outbreak situation reports communicated by provincial health authorities, covered by state TV and media, and posted on DXY.cn. All cases in our databases are laboratory confirmed 2019-nCoV patients. The database was made available as a Google sheet disseminated via Twitter on Jan 21, 2020 and posted on a university website on Jan 24, 2020 10 . Statistical Analysis. We assessed the age distribution of 2019-nCoV cases by discharge status, adjusted for the demographics of the Chinese population. We used 2016 population estimates from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 11 to calculate the relative risk (RR) of 2019-nCoV infection by age group, following Lemaitre et al 12 . The RR for age group # is defined as: Where ( % is the number of cases in group # and , % is the population of age group #. To estimate trends in the strength of case detection and interventions, we analyzed delays between symptom onset and visit to a healthcare provider, at a hospital or clinic, and from hospitalization to reporting, by time period and location. We considered the period before and after Jan 18, 2020, when media attention and awareness of the outbreak became more pronounced 13 . Further, intense travel restrictions in and out of the Wuhan region were put in place starting Jan 22, 2020 13 .
