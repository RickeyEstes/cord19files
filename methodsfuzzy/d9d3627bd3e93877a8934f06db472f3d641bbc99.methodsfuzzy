Inbred female A/J mice, 8-to lo-weeks-old, were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME. The animals received one intraperitoneal dose of 36 mg/kg body weight of dieldrin (99.9% purity, Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA) dissolved in 0.1 ml corn oil, which was 0.6~~~~ i.p. [9] . MHV3 virus was injected i.p. 4 days later into dieldrin-exposed animals, untreated controls, and animals receiving 0.1 ml corn oil. Peritoneal exudate macrophages were obtained and cultured as described elsewhere [13] . Briefly, mice were killed 7 days after MI-IV3 infection, and peritoneal exudates were obtained by washing the peritoneal cavity of mice with a total volume of 8 ml of heparinized Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM). Nonadherent cells were removed after 2 hr of incubation at 37" in Petri dishes by three washings with MEM. Adherent cells were shown to meet the morphological, functional, and biochemical criteria of macrophages, as identified earlier [13] . Adherence of macrophages to plastic surface, cell viability (determined by the trypan blue exclusion test), and phagocytosis of 5*Cr-labelled sheep erythrocytes by macrophage cultures have been described before [9, 13] . Generation of superoxide anion by macrophages during phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan was determined by the reduction of ferricytochrome c (80 fl) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in Krebs-Ringer phosphate (pH 7.35) containing 2 mg/ml dextrose (Sigma), according to the technique of Johnston [ 141. Specific reduction of 2571 cytochrome c by superoxide anion was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific reduction in the presence of 30pg/ml superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The SOD-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm was converted to nanomoles of cytochrome c reduced using the extinction coefficient EssO 21.0 x lo3 M-' cm-* [15] . In vitro infection of cells with MHV3 produces virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) and virusinduced foci formation in macrophage monolayers and are described elsewhere [4, 9] . Briefly, virusinduced damage of macrophages was determined microscopically 24-48 hr postinfection as the percentage of the monolayer cell lysis (CPE) [9] or as the number of multinuclear fusioned giant cells per culture (foci formation) [4] 48 hr after collection and culture of peritoneal macrophages from in vivo virusinfected animals. Determination of the attachment and uptake of MHV3 into cells was performed with 3H-radiolabelled virus, as described previously [13] . Cell monolayers were infected with [3H]MHV3 for 60 min at O", washed several times in ice-cold MEM, and dissolved with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (Sigma); the remaining radioactivity was counted and calculated as the surface-bound virus [16] . Uptake of [3H]MHV3 was determined by infection of macrophage monolayers with the virus at 37" for 20min, followed by several washings with ice-cold MEM and incubation at 0" for 90 min with 5 mg/ ml of proteinase K (Sigma), to distinguish surfacebound from internalized virus [ 161. Negative controls were performed by pretreatment of [ H]MHV3 for 3 hr at 4" with anti-MHV3 serum, prior to incubation with cells [13] . Incorporation of [5,6-3H]uridine (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL; sp. act. 43 Ci/mmole) by virus-activated macrophages, 7 days after in vivo infection with lo3 LDSO MHV3, was determined in 24-hr microcultures of cell monolayers by autoradiography. This was performed by exposure to Kodak NTB-3 nuclear track emulsion, development with Kodak D-19 developer, coloration with Giemsa, and subsequent microscopic counting of cell-associated radioactivity grains, as described by Brahic and Haase [17] . MHV3 titer in macrophage cultures was determined by transferring of several dilutions of 48-hr culture supernatant fractions onto L cell cultures and observing the CPE; the MHV3 titer was then calculated in plaque-forming units (PFU) [18] . L cells were grown as monolayers in MEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics, as described elsewhere [9] . For in vitro studies of dieldrin effects on proliferating cell cultures, L cell monolayers were incubated with ethanol solutions of dieldrin (O-10 ,ug/ml dieldrin in ethanol, the proportion of ethanol never exceeding 2%), and pulse-labelled with [3H]thymidine (Amersham; sp. act. 18.2Ci/mmole). Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into cellular DNA was determined by liquid scintillation, as described before [19] . The humoral immune response to MHV3 infection was determined in mouse sera and supernatant fractions of 24-hr spleen cell cultures, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [20] as described before [9] . Briefly, spleen cells were incubated at 37" in RPMI-1640 medium (Grand Island Biological Co., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Appropriate dilutions of culture supernatant fractions and sera were incubated with MHV3 antigen prepared as homogenate of MHV3-infected L cells [19] and incubated in flatbottom Linbro microplates (Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA), followed by saturation with 1.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer and 200 mM NaCl, final pH 8.0. Appropriate controls were performed with non-infected L-cell homogenates. As a second antibody, peroxidaseconjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1: 3000. The substrate for peroxidase development was 2,3-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazoline) sulfonate and hydrogen peroxide (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaitherburg, MD), and the colored product was determined spectrophotometrically at 0.D.M50snm. MHV3 antigen in peritoneal exudates originating from virus-infected and dieldrin-exposed and control animals was quantified by the dot-blot immunoperoxidase dilution test [21] as described previously [9] . Briefly, appropriate dilutions of cellular homogenates were applied as spots onto nitrocellulose papers, saturated with 1.5% bovine serum albumin in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer and 200 mM NaCl, final pH 8.0, and incubated with anti-MHV3 mouse serum [13] , followed by reaction with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) and coloration with hydrogen peroxide and 4-chloro-l-naphthol (Sigma). A positive reaction was detected as a colored dot against the white nitrocellulose background. The results are expressed as minimal cell number giving positive immunoperoxidase reaction.
