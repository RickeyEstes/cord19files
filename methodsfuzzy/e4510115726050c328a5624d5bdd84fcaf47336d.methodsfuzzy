Soil is considered as a major habitat of spore-forming bacteria. B. cereus and C. botulinum have been detected worldwide in soil samples (Dodds, 1993) with levels in soil that can reach 10 5 À10 6 spores/g of soil (Lund, 1986; Te Giffel, Beumer, Slaghuis, & Rombouts, 1995) . The spores ingested with fecal and other soil materials colonize the gut of animals and may develop a symbiotic relation with their hosts (König, 2006) . Besides, soil contamination can transfer to plant material (silage) and to feed. According to Magnusson, Christiansson, and Svensson (2007) , the major cause of contamination into foods is related to dispersion of spores by fecal material of warm-blooded animals. Indeed, the microorganism, C. perfringens is a common colonizer of the gastrointestinal tract of mammals (including man) (Brynestad & Granum, 2002) and C. botulinum has been identified in cow and pig feces collected in abattoirs (Dahlenborg, Borch, & Rådström, 2003) . On the other hand, food-processing facilities can be also the source of spores in foods, in fact milking machinery and apparatus have been indicated as sources of milk contamination (Scheldeman, Pil, Herman, Vos, & Heyndrickx, 2005) . Specifically, Svensson, Ekelund, Ogura, and Christiansson (2004) have noticed the presence of a persistent B. cereus spore, due to their resistance to cleaning operations because many of them have strong adhering properties and ability to form biofilms (Auger et al., 2009) . Overall, it is worthy to say that processed foods are increasingly a mixture of multiple ingredients and additives, each bringing its own sporeforming bacteria into the final food products. Works in the literature clearly demonstrate that the origins of B. cereus spores are very diverse, depending on factors such as the microbial ecology, animal feeding, the farming management, the climate, and the hygienic practices during food processing. A wide variety of methods have been developed for producing safe foods, classified in (1) physical, (2) chemicals, and (3) others, within which emerging technologies can be mentioned. Physical methods of inactivation of microorganisms are those, based on the use of temperatures and modified pressures with the aim of altering cell structures or essential biomolecules for their metabolism as high-pressures (HPP) and ionizing radiations (ultraviolet and infrared). Regarding the first methodology, Zhang and Mittal (2008) reported successful conditions with HPP for the inactivation of spores of various species. However, these authors affirm that due to the complicate intrinsic and extrinsic factors, HPP conditions should be verified case by case for required sterility. It has been studied that the effect of infrared radiation on the inactivation of spores, due to this radiation is quickly converted to heat, producing an intense local heating on spores (Mamouni, Tang, Wu, Vlahovic, & Yang, 2011) . Explanation is based on local heating over the spores produce mechanical abrasion causing the germination by the activation of the lysis enzymes (Dong, Tang, Wu, Vlahovic, & Yang, 2013) . These enzymes are present in the spore in an active form, but they do not act until they are activated by the mechanical damage. Within the chemical processes, the most used are acidification and smoking. Such processes can generate added value to the product by improving sensorial characteristics of the final product. However, these treatments are not effective in spore elimination. Spores are extremely resistant to a variety of chemicals, including acids, bases, oxidant and alkylating agents, aldehydes and organic solvents. However, treatments with strong acids can eliminate spores, probably due to the rupture of the inner membrane (Setlow, 2006) . On the contrary, treatment with a strong alkali is less effective because they can be reactivated with an adequate recovery by lysozymes (Setlow, 2006) . Within emerging technologies, we can highlight plasma and advanced process of oxidation based on radical generation. Plasma has been reported to inactivate both vegetative cells and bacterial endospores. Three basic mechanisms have been attributed to the inactivation of spores: (1) DNA degradation by UV radiation, (2) volatilization of compounds of the spore surface by UV photons, and (3) erosion of the spore surface by the adsorption of reactive molecules as free radicals (Philip et al., 2002) . Finally, advanced oxidation processes are based on the generation of hydroxyl radicals using different precursors (UV, hydrogen peroxide, ozone, electrons, photo catalysis with titanium dioxide, Fenton reagent, etc.). All of these treatments have been reported as highly efficient in the elimination of microorganisms (Bondala, Castillo, González, & Sanchez-Salas, 2011) , because they produce damage on external spore (mainly in inner membrane). Then when the treated spores germinate, these ruptures in the membrane have a fatal consequence in its viability (Shapiro, Setlow, & Setlow, 2004) . In particular, the Fenton reaction has been tested for elimination of spores in water with successful results (Bondala et al., 2008) . However, studies to establish whether these processes can be widely used in other foods, without a possible change in sensory characteristics must be developed.
