This section describes the details of the general Lotka-Volterra model and the proposed moving-window LV model. A usual method to study the traveler's mode choice and demand is "discrete choice model", and a plenty of questionnaire survey is required to calibrate such models (Lo, 2012) . In addition to "discrete choice model", Bass (1969) and Fisher and Pry (1971) proposed models to analyse competition, however, these models do not consider the competition factor. This study offers an aggregate model based on conventional L-V model. It is the special feature of L-V model that it considers competition factor.
