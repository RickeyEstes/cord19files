Patients in this study were enrolled as part of a clinical trial comparing valganciclovir prophylaxis with ganci-clovir (intravenous and oral) as cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis in D ϩ /R Ϫ and R ϩ lung transplant recipients. The design of the previous study with regard to inclusion and exclusion criteria has been described in detail elsewhere. 14 Patients were enrolled at two Canadian transplant centers and were transplanted between 1999 and 2002. The institutional review board at each center approved the study and informed consent was obtained from the patients. The original study evaluated CMV prophylaxis and, as part of this study, patients had received oral ganciclovir, intravenous ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir up to 3 months post-transplant. Two sets of primers and probes were designed from the highly conserved hexon gene of adenovirus Type 2 and 4 using PRIMEREXPRESS software (ABI) designed for the detection of all serotypes. 15 DNA was extracted from 200 l of plasma using a Qiagen DNA mini-kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen) and eluted from the column with 50 l of elution buffer. To quantify adenovirus in plasma, an external standard curve was established with a 10-fold series of dilution from one copy to 1.0Eϩ06 copies using a 375-bp DNA fragment produced from Type 2 adenovirus. Real-time TaqMan PCR was conducted in a closed-tube sequence detection system (Model 7000, ABI-Prism, Applied Biosystems). Briefly, the PCR was performed in a 25-l volume containing 12.5 l of Universal DNA Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 10 l DNA, 400 nmol/liter each primer and 200 nmol/liter of each probe. After initial incubation at 50°C for 2 minutes to activate Uracil-Nglycosylase and then at 95°C for 10 minutes for denaturing, PCR amplification was performed with two-step thermal cycles of 94°C for 20 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute by 45 cycles after re-heating at 95°C for 5 minutes. Amplification data were collected and analyzed by computer (Sequence Detection System, version 1.0, Applied Biosystems). The dynamic range of detection of the PCR was 25 to 2.5Eϩ07 copies/ml plasma in normal healthy controls. Adenovirus DNA is not detectable from plasma samples when using this assay.
