A successful RT-LAMP reaction with CSFV-specific primers at 65 C in 60 min produced many bands of different sizes upon agarose electrophoresis, since RT-LAMP products consisted of several inverted-repeat structures. The amplification by RT-LAMP showed a ladder-like pattern, whereas RT-PCR products were a specific DNA band. Sequencing result indicated that the amplified partial 5 0 UTR sequence of RT-PCR was a 500 bp amplicon. The detection limit of CSFV RT-LAMP was 5 copies per reaction and that of CSFV RT-PCR was 125 copies per reaction (Fig. 1) . Thus, the comparative sensitivity of RT-LAMP and RT-PCR indicated that the detection limit of RT-LAMP for CSFV was 25 times less than that of conventional RT-PCR. Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that no DNA band of PCV2, PPV, PRV, JEV, and PRRSV was observed by CSFV RT-LAMP, only CSFV-GS and CSFV-LT RNAs demonstrated specifically positive reaction (Fig. 2) .
