The 94 samples were tested with Altona assay and with the reference RT-PCR. The Altona internal control was negative in one sample, indicating inhibition of the RT-PCR; this sample tested positive with the reference assay (HEV RNA: 10.5 log copies/g). This sample was excluded from the analysis. The Altona RT-PCR detected HEV RNA in 77/93 (82.8%) samples and the reference RT-PCR detected HEV RNA in 83/93 (89.2%, p = 0.19) ( Table 1 ). The 6 samples that tested negative with Altona assay tested positive with the reference assay (HEV RNA: 3.2 to 10.5 log copies/g). Thus, the assays were concordant for 87/93 (93.5%) faecal samples: 77 samples tested positive and 10 were negative with both assays. (Table 1 ). The Altona RT-PCR and reference RT-PCR HEV RNA concentrations were correlated (ρ = 0.90, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1A) . The Altona assay values were higher than the reference assay values. Bland-Altman analysis (Fig. 1B) produced a mean deviation between the assay results of -0.5 log 10 c/g and a difference of > 0.5 log copies/g for 37 samples. Table 2 ). The 2 samples that were positive with the Altona assay (HEV RNA: 5 and 6 log copies/g) were negative with the reference assay. The Altona assay negative sample was positive with the reference assay (HEV RNA: 3.6 copies/g). The HEV RNA concentrations obtained with Altona RT-PCR and the reference RT-PCR were correlated (ρ = 0.98, p < 0.001) ( Fig. 2A) but the Altona assay values were higher than those from the reference assay. Bland-Altman analysis (Fig. 2B) gave a mean deviation between the reference RT-PCR and Altona results of -0.7 log 10 c/g and a bias of > 0.5 log copies/g for 23 samples.
