The sample for this study consisted of patients with end-stage osteoarthritis who underwent THA or TKA. All of the surgery was conducted at a specialized orthopedic tertiary care facility in Toronto. Subject recruitment was based on the following criteria: diagnosis of osteoarthritis scheduled for primary total joint arthroplasty; sufficient language skills to communicate in written and spoken English; and absence of neurological, cardiac, and psychiatric disorders or other medical conditions that would significantly compromise physical function. Exclusion criteria included individuals scheduled for revision arthroplasty or bilateral arthroplasties, either simultaneous or staged. Ethics approval for the study was received from the institution's research ethics review board. Data were collected on 188 patients who provided informed consent between October 2001 and March 2003. Of these patients, 36 had only baseline assessments and were lost to follow-up for the following reasons: canceled surgery, loss of follow-up due to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Toronto from April to June 2003, additional operative procedures, postoperative medical reasons, or patient choice. The demographic and preoperative baseline characteristics of the remaining 152 (81%) patients are summarized in Table 1 . All subjects who completed at least one postoperative assessment were retained for the analysis.
