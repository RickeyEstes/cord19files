The MAP bioassay (De Souza and Smith 1989; Rowe et al. 1959 ) and commercially available multiple-agent PCR panel tests are used to test incoming biologic materials. If isolation space is available at the home institution, MAP testing can usually be done in house. If isolation space is limited or unavailable, materials to be tested are frequently sent to commercial testing laboratories for either MAP or PCR testing. a. MOUSE ANTIBODY PRODUCTION (MAP) Although the original protocol for MAP testing was relatively complex, the basic principle is that immunocompetent pathogen-free mice are injected with the test material and held in isolation for at least 3 weeks, a period that allows time for seroconversion to infectious agent(s) that may present in the sample. After the holding period, mice are bled and serum is tested for antibodies for a panel of agents of interest. An alternative option for testing is to isolate experimental mice being given an untested preparation for the first time and to place immunocompetent contact sentinel mice within the cage(s). After an appropriate incubation period, the sentinels are tested to determine if a viable and replicating agent of concern was present in the test material, because it should have also infected the contact sentinel mice. Because the sentinels are not directly injected with the original material but would be given secondary exposure to agents shed by the experimental mice, at least 1 additional week of pretesting exposure (i.e., an exposure time of 4 weeks or greater) should be provided. One potential pitfall of MAP testing is that the use of aggressive tumor cell lines or hybridomas may cause morbidity or mortality so quickly that seroconversion of injected animals and/or effective transmission of potential infectious agents to sentinel mice will not develop. In these cases it will be necessary to utilize a standard MAP testing regimen that includes freeze-thaw cycles to kill the cells and release viral particles. Regardless of method, all MAP testing should be done in quarantine isolation. b. POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION PCR testing is rapidly replacing classical MAP testing because it offers some significant benefits, including high sensitivity (Bootz et al. 2003; Yagami et al. 1995) , shorter turn-around time, and no need for additional animals. Aggressive tumors can be tested without the risk of early mortality. A fluorogenic nuclease RT-PCR has been suggested as useful for detecting agents such as LCMV, murine coronaviruses and parvoviruses, PVM, and Sendai virus in biologic materials Redig and Besselsen 2001; Wagner et al. 2003) . Disadvantages include the potential for false-positive results from nonviable DNA fragments when biologic materials or animals receiving biologic materials are tested. In addition, PCR testing has not yet been validated to be accepted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a replacement for traditional MAP testing for good laboratory practice (GLP) studies. (LDHV) LDHV requires special consideration for identification in biologic materials or animals because it is not readily amenable to serologic detection due to the presence of persistently circulating viral-antibody complexes (Brinton 1986 ). Instead of submitting serum obtained from test animals that have been injected with the test material for antibody testing (as in a MAP test), the presence of LDHV is evaluated by testing the recipient's serum for elevated values of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme. Serial dilutions and further passage can be used to confirm the diagnosis. One must be careful interpreting elevated LDH enzyme in the case of animals injected with viable tumor cells, which may invade and damage tissues, releasing endogenous LDH. To avoid these complications, the use of a fluorogenic nuclease RT-PCR has been reported (Wagner et al. 2003) . PCR detection of LDHV is available as part of a commercially available PCR panel.
