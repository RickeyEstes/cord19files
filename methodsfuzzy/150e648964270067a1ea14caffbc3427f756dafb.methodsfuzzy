Ethics statement. As this research involved human blood, the aims of our study were explained to all the dengue patients involved (all were adults) and all provided written informed consent. The collection methods of clinical samples and epidemiological data were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board of Southern Medical University and were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. Samples were selected randomly based on the laboratory diagnosis and clinical signs. Sample collection and epidemiological data. Dengue virus RNA samples (n = 29) were obtained from the Guangdong Provincial Maternal and Child Care Service. All samples were extracted from patients suspected of dengue and were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using specific primers. The steps included an initial denaturation (94Â°C, 2 minutes); 35 cycles of denaturation added to make a comprehensive evaluation of the epidemiological situation and molecular evolution in the large 2014 dengue outbreak in Guangdong. At the same time, E gene sequences of DENV1 since 2005, comprising 187 sequences from Guangdong and 1,886 from other countries, were downloaded from GenBank. After excluding several sequences with uncertain epidemiological data, representative epidemic strains in every lineage were screened using phylogenetic methods. Since then, a molecular evolution database for the DENV1 E gene in Guangdong and other countries has been established. Based on representative strains of the E gene in lineages of the 2014 outbreak, as well as the molecular evolution database, we analyzed molecular characterization and possibility of local circulation for DENV1 since 2005 in Guangdong. Three-dimensional (3D) structure prediction of DENV1 protein E and molecular docking with 78-kDa glucoseregulated protein (GRP78). Amino acid (AA) sequences of DENV1 protein E were translated by using DNASTAR. Protein 3D structures were simulated by Discovery Studio 2.5 (DS2.5) (http://accelrys.com/products/collaborativescience/biovia-discovery-studio/) 31 through the homology modeling method based on the MODELER program. The optimal protein 3D model was selected by combining the Probability density function and discrete optimized protein energy, and the reliability of the model was evaluated using the Ramachandran plot and Profile-3D. The optimal protein structure model was used to perform protein docking calculations with the GRP78 protein (PDB number: 3LDP) using the ZDOCK algorithm in DS2.5, and RDOCK was used to further optimize the docking configuration to minimize energy. Finally, we analyzed AA sites in the binding interface of the optimal docking model.
