Sampling: In total, 201 rectal swab samples were collected in diarrhoetic dogs from animal hospitals in three districts-Harbin, Daqing and Mudanjiang-of Heilongjiang province in northeast China from May 2014 to April 2015 using 3.5-ml commercial virus sampling tubes (YOCON Biological Technology Co.. Ltd., Beijing, China). Of the 201 samples, 141 were collected from 2 animal hospitals in Harbin, 20 were collected from one animal hospital in Daqing, and 40 were collected from 1 animal hospital in Mudanjiang. All rectal swab samples were stored at −80°C. RNA and DNA extraction: After 1 ml of fecal samples was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatant of each sample was transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf (EP) tube. Viral RNA was extracted from each sample using the TIANamp Virus RNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA was extracted from the supernatant using a commercial TIANamp Stool DNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted RNA and genomic DNAs were stored at −80°C. Detection and sequence analysis of CaKVs: Molecular detection of CaKVs was conducted using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) targeting a 504-bp fragment of the 3D gene of CaKV described by Di Martino et al. [7] . The first cDNA was synthesized using random primers (6 nt) by Moloney murine leukemia virus (RNase H-) reverse transcriptase (Novoprotein Scientific Inc., Shanghai, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplifications were conducted in a 50-µl reaction volume containing 0.1 µM of the forward primer, 0.1 µM of the reverse primer, 4 µl of cDNA, 25 µl of EmeraldAmp PCR Master Mix (2× Premix) (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China) and an appropriate volume of double-distilled water. The mixtures were amplified by 35 cycles of 94°C for 45 sec, 54°C for 1 min and 72°C for 50 sec, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 10 min in an Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.). After the amplification products were purified using the AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction kit (Corning, Suzhou, China), the purified products were directly subjected to sequencing using the Sanger sequencing method. Each sample was sequenced three times. Thirty-six sequences were submitted to GenBank at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov) under the accession numbers KT210390-KT210425. Phylogenetic analysis of the 3D gene: For the phylogenetic analysis, partial sequences of the 3D gene of kobuviruses from canine and other species were retrieved from GenBank. To construct the phylogenetic trees, a multiple alignment of all target sequences was performed using ClustalX program version 1.83 [18] . Furthermore, phylogenetic trees of all target sequences were generated from the ClustalX-generated alignments by MEGA6.06 software using the neighbor-join- ing method [17] . Neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were built with the p-distance model, 1,000 bootstrap replicates and, otherwise, the default parameters in MEGA 6. Screening for canine enteric pathogens: All fecal samples that tested positive for CaKV were also screened for canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), canine coronavirus (CCoV), canine astrovirus (CaAstV), canine norovirus (CNoV), canine bocavirus (CBoV) and Group A-Rotavirus (RV-A) by either PCR or RT-PCR, followed by sequencing, according to previously described protocols [3, 5, 6, 9, 12, 14] .
