mAbs to human LSECtin were established by immunization of Balb/C mice with recombinant LSECtin extracellular domain protein. Three independent clones, CCA023 (IgG2a), CFD051 (IgG1) and CCB059 (IgG2b), were established [34] . The anti-human LSECtin mAb CCB059 (IgG2b) was selected for staining by flow cytometry. The mouse IgG1 isotype control was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). mAbs against human HLA-DR, CD83 and CD86 were from eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA); mAbs against human CD40 and CD80 were from Biolegend (San Diego, CA, USA); anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (4G10) was from Millipore; anti-DAP12 and the other phospho-specific Abs were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The Syk inhibitors piceatannol and R406 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA) and Selleckchem (Houston, TX, USA) respectively. Raf-1 inhibitor GW5074 was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA); The MyD88 inhibitory peptide Pepinh-MYD was from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA, USA). The GlcNAc Î²1-2Man disaccharide was purchased from Dextra Laboratories (Reading, UK).
