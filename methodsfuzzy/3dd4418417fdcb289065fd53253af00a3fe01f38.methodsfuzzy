Animals: The investigation involved 324 male and 305 female LEW !Han rats of the 87th and 88th inbred generation. The animals, provided by polygamous mating of 11 males with 150 females, were derived from the institute's specified pathogen-free breeding colony at an age of21 days. As proved by routine examinations of the breeding colony, the rats were known to harbour neither murine viral infections nor endo-or ectoparasites, protozoa, specific pathogenic bacteria, mycoplasma or fungi. Housing conditions: The animals were separated according to sex and maintained in groups of five in polycarbonate cages (bottom area 1,750 cm 2 ) , on softwood bedding. They were kept in a barrier-type animal quarter at 22 ± 1 °C room temperature, with 55 ± 5 % relative humidity, 15 mm H 2 0 hyperbaric pressure in relation to external pressure, 12: 12light-dark-sequence (6.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m.), light intensity of about 300 lux, and an air exchange of 20 times per hour. All rats were fed an autoclaved (120 °C for 5 min) commercial, cereal-based diet supplemented with vitamins and minerals (Han:MR3, Eggersmann, Rinteln). The diet consisted of 17.7 % crude protein, 4.2 % crude fat and 6.8 % crude fibre with a metabolizable energy content of 10.3 MJ/kg, administered ad libitum. Tap water was offered ad libitum. Control and end of study: To allow each animal to reach its natural end of life, all rats were checked daily for behaviour and the presence of clinically visible alterations. A necropsy was performed on all animals found dead and on those which were moribund and killed by chloroform inhalation. All gross lesions were recorded for each animal. Histology: Excluding three rats because of severe autolysis or cannibalism, a complete histological examination was performed on all animals which died during the first three years of the study: 213 males (66 % of the colony) and 296 females (97 %). The evaluation comprised routinely gross lesions, tissue masses, brain, pituitary gland, eyes, salivary glands, thyroid glands, parathyroid glands, thymus, trachea, lung, heart, aorta, oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, colon, liver, spleen, pancreas, mesenterial lymph node, adrenals, kidneys, urinary bladder, testes, epididymes, prostate, seminal vesicles, ovaries, uterus, cervix, vagina, skin and mammary gland. Tissues were fixed in 10 % formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 11m and stained routinely with haematoxylin and eosin. In selected cases special stains, like azan according to HEIDENHAIN and PTAH according to MALLORY and VAN GIESON were additionally used to characterize specific lesions. In some cases, tumour tissue was embedded in iii = males hydroxyethylmethacrylate and 1 flm-semithin sections were stained with toluidine blue to facilitate differentiation of haemopoietic cells. If necessary for classification, paraffin slides of tumours were examined immunohistochemically by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method for demonstration of intermediate filaments or hormones (S 100, actin, des min, vimentin, calcitonin). Classification: The neoplasms were classified according to standard text books like JONES et al. (1983 JONES et al. ( , 1985a JONES et al. ( , 1985b JONES et al. ( , 1986 JONES et al. ( ,1987 JONES et al. ( ,1988 JONES et al. ( ,1989 JONES et al. ( ,1990 and BOORMAN et al. (1990) . Statistics: The life expectancy, incidence and spectrum oftumours are presented as means ± S.D. or in per cent, separated according to sex and age. Data were analyzed by the chi-square test or Student's t-test.
