This study was approved by the ethics committee of Guangzhou medical university. Experimental animals obtained from the Kangda laboratory animals Science & Technology Company of Gaoyao city and the care and treatment of the animals were in compliance with the university standard. position and anesthetize with Propofol by continuous infusion (0.16-0.5 mg/ kg/ h). Paralysis was achieved with pancuronium(bolus = 0.16 mg /kg, followed by 0.08 mg /kg/ h). After orotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ID cuff tube, lungs were ventilated with the ventilator EVITA 4 (Dräger Medical AG, Lübeck, Germany). Volume-controlled model with a tidal volume (VT) of 10 ml/kg, PEEP 5 cm H 2 O, I:E ratio 1:1, FiO 2 1.0 and the respiratory rate(RR)was adjusted to maintain PaCO 2 between 35 and 45 mmHg. Intravenous fluid (lactated Ringer ' s; 6 ml /kg/ h) were administrated to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure more than 70 mmHg. The right jugular vein and femoral artery were catheterized and connected to PiCCO system for measure of core temperature, mean arterial blood pressure(MPA) and obtain artery blood sample for gas analysis. A multipair esophageal electrode-balloon combined catheter was put into the esophagus, and airway occlusion technique was used to check the proper position [14] . Airway pressure (Paw), esophageal pressure (Peso) and intragastric pressure (Pgas) from a side tap was connected to the end tracheal. A MLT300L respiratory flow head was used to measure airflow, and integrated airflow to obtain tidal volume. Signal of Paw, Peso, Pgas, airflow, diaphragmatic esophageal surface electromyography (EMGdi) and abdominal muscles surface electromyography (EMGab) were recorded by powerlab 16/30 SP and chart 7.2 software on a Mac book Computer. Body temperature was constant throughout the whole experiment at 37°C with a heating pad.
