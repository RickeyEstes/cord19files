Protein expression and purification. A human-codon-optimized gene fragment encoding residues 1 to 1319 of PEDV CV777 S was generously provided by Kizzmekia Corbett and Barney Graham of the Vaccine Research Center. This gene was subcloned into a p␣H eukaryotic expression plasmid with a C-terminal T4 fibritin motif, an HRV3C protease cleavage site, an 8ϫ His tag, and a Twin-Strep-tag. Further MegaPrimer subcloning was performed to remove the 194 amino acids corresponding to DA, thereby generating a gene encoding residues 1 to 1125 of PEDV PC177 S. These plasmids were transiently transfected into FreeStyle 293-F cells (GibCo) using polyethylenimine. Transfected FreeStyle 293-F cells were treated with 5 M kifunensine to ensure uniform high-mannose glycosylation. PEDV S CV777 and PEDV S PC177 were purified over Strep-Tactin resin (IBA Lifesciences) before being run over a Superose6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare Biosciences) in 2 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN 3 . PEDV CV777 S SDS-PAGE analysis and trypsin digestion. SEC-purified PEDV CV777 S was mixed with tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin from bovine pancreas (Sigma-Aldrich) at a ratio of 10:1 (wt/wt). This mixture was incubated at 37°C, and samples from various time points were collected, reduced by the addition of lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) loading dye containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE after being heated for 5 min at 98°C. Cryo-EM data collection. CF-2/2 grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) were plasma cleaned for 30 s in a Gatan Solarus 950 plasma cleaner with a 4:1 O 2 /H 2 ratio. PEDV S CV777 at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml was mixed with 2 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN 3, and 0.01% Amphipol A8-35 and was deposited onto the grids before being blotted for 6 s and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV instrument (Thermo Scientific). The frozen grid was imaged using an FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a K2 direct electron detector (Gatan) at a nominal magnification of ϫ22,500, corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 1.075 Å/pixel. A total of 3,186 movies were collected using Leginon (45) . A full description of the cryo-EM data collection parameters can be found in Table 1 . Cryo-EM data processing. Motion correction and CTF estimation were performed for PEDV S CV777 movies in Warp (35). Unbiased, nontemplated particle picking was also performed in Warp using BoxNet. BoxNet-selected particles were imported into cryoSPARC v2.4.6 (Structura Biotechnology) (36) for 2D classification, ab initio reconstruction, 3D classification, and nonuniform 3D refinement. The resulting 3.1-Å map was then subjected to local-resolution-guided sharpening in LocalDeblur (37) . A detailed description of the cryo-EM data processing workflow can also be found in Fig. S1 . Model-building was performed by fitting a small, homologous portion of the NL63 S2 fusion machinery (PDB identifier [ID] 5SZS) into the PEDV S CV777 map. The rest of the model was built manually in Coot (46) and refined in both PHENIX (47) and ISOLDE (48) ( Table 2) . Cryo-EM screening in the presence of 3=-sialyllactose. PEDV CV777 S at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml was incubated with 2 mM 3=-sialyllactose (Sigma-Aldrich) in 2 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN 3 , 0.01% Amphipol A8-35 for 3 h at 4°C. A 3-l volume of the spike and 3=-sialyllactose mixture was deposited on a plasma-cleaned CF-2/2 grid before being blotted for 6 s and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV instrument. The frozen grid was imaged using an FEI Talos transmission electron microscope (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a Ceta 16M detector. Micrographs were collected manually using TIA v4.14 (Thermo Scientific) at a nominal magnification of ϫ92,000, corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 1.63 Å/pixel. A full description of the EM data collection parameters can be found in Table 1 . CTF estimation, particle picking, 2D classification, ab initio 3D reconstruction, and 3D refinement were performed in cisTEM (49) . Negative-stain EM data collection and processing. PEDV S PC177 was deposited onto a plasmacleaned CF400-Cu grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences) at a concentration of 0.035 mg/ml before being stained with methylamine tungstate (Nanoprobes). The stained grid was imaged using an FEI Talos transmission electron microscope equipped with a Ceta 16M detector. Micrographs were collected manually using TIA v4.14 at a nominal magnification of ϫ92,000, corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 1.63 Å/pixel. A full description of the negative-stain EM data collection parameters can be found in Table 1 . CTF estimation, particle picking, 2D classification, ab initio 3D reconstruction, and 3D refinement and sharpening were all performed in cisTEM. Data availability.
