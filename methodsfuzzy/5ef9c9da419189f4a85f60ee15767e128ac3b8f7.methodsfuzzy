Cell culture RP.D. is a pig kidney cell line which has been described elsewhere (Laude et al., 1981) . The swine testis (ST) cell line (McClurkin and Norman, 1966) was kindly supplied by Dr. E.H. Bohl (Wooster, Ohio, U.S.A. ) . Both cell lines were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 #g/ml streptomycin sulphate, and were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The virus, serum and milk whey used for the antibody titration were diluted in serum-free MEM containing twice the normal antibiotic concentration.
