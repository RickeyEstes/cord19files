The Andersen Impactor and OPC described previously were used during sampling. We estimate over 95% of cough aerosol particles in the size range of the Andersen Impactor remained airborne during the aging period. [9] An 8-cm circular inlet was positioned 30-cm inside the Rig along the rotation axis. This provided 100% aspiration efficiency of particles in the Andersen and OPC size ranges. [6] Samples were transported via straight conductive tubing, with residence times of 0.8 sec for Andersen samples and 0.09 sec for OPC samples. Sample losses across the Andersen Impactor size range due to gravitational settling and inertial impaction were from 0 to 6% and 0 to 1%, respectively. Temperature and water vapour concentration were measured simultaneously inside and outside of the Duration Rig by the same probes described above. Before each test, the Duration Rig was flushed with HEPA-filtered air using a 3M Air-Mate respirator (St. Paul, MN). Once the OPC confirmed a particle concentration <0.01 p/cc, a 5-minute blank sample was taken by the Andersen Impactor. The Air-Mate provided filtered air to replace that extracted by the pump. The OPC confirmed the Rig was free of contamination, and the Rig was then isolated by entry and exit valves.
