Virus and tissue culture Confluent monolayers of BHK cells were grown in Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 6% fetal calf serum . The cells were infected with Sindbis virus strain Sa-AR-86 at a multiplicity of infection of 50 plaqueforming units per cell . After infection the cells were maintained in either Earle's medium or Dulbecco's medium containing 10 mMfructose instead of glucose as indicated in the text . When labeling with [35 S]methionine was performed, Dulbecco's medium lacking methionine was used . After labeling the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and either suspended in chloroform-methanol (2 :1 v/v) for extraction of lipids or lysed with a buffer comprising 62 .5 mM Tris-HCI, pH 6 .8, 3% SDS, 5% mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol for SDS-PAGE . Virus in the medium was quantitated by plaque assay and by the incorporation of [35 S]methionine into virus particles 'Abbreviations used : MdN, N-methyl- isolated by sucrose density centrifugation (Schwarz et a!, 1976 ) .
