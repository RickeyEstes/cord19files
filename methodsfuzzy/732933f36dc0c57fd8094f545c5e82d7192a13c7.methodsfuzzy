Base culture medium (BCM) consisted of base inorganic salts3.00 g/LNaNO3, 0.50 g/L K2HPO4, 0.50 g/L MgSO4•7H2O, 0.50 g/L KCl, and 0.01 g/L FeSO4•7H2O. The seed culture medium contained of BCM and glucose (5 g/L). The Enzyme produced culture medium that was optimized for enzyme production contained of BCM and GL (4 g/L). Fermentation culture media consisted of BCM and different dosages of TFG, TTG, and TSG. Culture medium and containers were sterilized at 118 °C for 15 min. The P. purpurogenum Li-3 was grown in a seed culture medium (100 ml) at 170 rpm and 30 °C for 72 h. The fungal mycelia were inoculated into different types culture medium and were cultured at 170 rpm and 30 °C for 120 h. Measurement of whole-cell enzyme activity. The whole-cell enzyme activity was measured as previously reported 32, 33 . At the end of fermentation, 100 ml of individual fermentation broth was centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. The fungal strain were washed with sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) three times and then mixed with 100 ml of 4 g/L GL solution at 170 rpm and 37 °C for 12 h. The concentration of GAMG was analysed by HPLC. One activity unit (U) of the whole-cell enzyme was defined to be the amount of enzyme (whole-cell biomass) that releases1 μmol of GAMG per hour under certain conditions. The specific activity (U/mg) was defined as the enzyme activity units that were exhibited by 1 mg of dry fungal strain under certain conditions. The specific activities of whole-cell enzymes in the presence of the TFG, TTG and TSG. Since TEG was a complex mixture, it was separated into three fractions (TSG, TFG and TTG). We added 0.5, 1, and 2 times of each fraction (1 time of a fraction is equal to its content in 4 g/L TEG), into the BCM + GL + P. purpurogenum Li-3. The biomass and specific activity of β-glucuronidase were measured every 12 h after the first 24 h of cultivation. Preparation of enzyme solution of β-glucuronidase. We prepared the enzyme solution by liquid nitrogen freezing and grinding with mortar and pestle 34, 35 . The fungal mycelia of P. purpurogenum Li-3, which were collected by centrifugation at the end of the fermentation, were washed with 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) three times. The samples were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder for 20 min in a prefrozen mortar and pestle with a small amount of quartz sand. The powder was transferred to 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected as the enzyme solution of β-glucuronidase. The β-glucuronidase was obtained by ammonium sulfate fractionation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Measurement of β-glucuronidase enzyme activity. In total, 400 μl of the β-glucuronidase enzyme was added to 200 μl of sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) that contained 2.4 mg/ml GL. After shaking in a water bath at 40 °C for 4 h, the enzyme was heat-inactivated. Then, 100 μl of the mixture was diluted to 1 ml with methanol, and the concentration of GAMG in the solution was measured by HPLC. One activity unit (U) of the β-glucuronidase enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme capable of releasing 1 μmol of GAMG per minute under the above conditions. HPLC analysis. The concentrations of GL and GAMG were measured with HPLC using an ODS column (Shim-pack, VP-ODS, 4.6 mm × 250 mm, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and a UV detector. The wavelength was set at 254 nm. A flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and an injection volume of 10 μl were used. The mobile phase was a mixture of 0.6% (v/v) acetic acid (pH 2.85) and methanol at a ratio of 19:81 (v/v). The retention times of GL and GAMG were approximately 7.5 and 15.9 min, respectively.
