Site-specific mutagenesis Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by a procedure by Kunkel (1985) as described (Brierley et al., 1989) . Mutants were identiÂ®ed by dideoxy sequencing of single-stranded templates (Sanger et al., 1977) . Sequencing through G C-rich regions was facilitated by including formamide (to 20 % (v/v)) in the sequencing gel and replacing dGTP with deaza-GTP in the sequencing mixes.
