Human cells. De-identified blood samples were obtained from healthy donors, as defined by Hoxworth Blood Center guidelines (https://hoxworth.org/donors/eligibility.html), with the approval of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMCs) cells were isolated on a ficollhystopaque (GE, Marlborough, MA) gradient, and NK cells were enriched by negative selection using the NK-cell isolation kit immune magnetic beads per manufacturer's protocol (Miltentyi Biotec, San Diego, CA). Enriched cells were >90% CD56 + CD3 neg NK cells as determined by flow cytometry. In vitro culture of NK cells. Enriched NK cells were cultured in SCGM media (Cellgenix®, Freiburg, Germany) supplemented with IL-2 (400 U/ml, Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), 10% human serum (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 U/ml streptomycin, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, 2mM L-Glutamine and 10 mM HEPES. In experiments, NK cells were either used directly after blood isolation or after 7 to 30 days of ex vivo culture. Each scenario produced similar results. Antibodies. The following antibodies were used in the described studies: Brilliant violet (BV) 421-CD56 (5.1H11), BV711-CD16 (3G8), AlexaFluor (AF) 647-NKp46 (9E2), PE-NKp44 (P44-8) were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego ,CA); Brilliant Ultra violet (BUV) 395-CD3 (SK7), V500-CD3 (SP34-2), BUV797-CD69 (FN50), and BUV-CD62L (SK11) were purchased from Becton and Dickinson (San Diego, CA); eFluor710-NKG2D (1D11) from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA); and mouse antihuman ST2 (AF523 or unconjugated) and antihuman IL-18R (70625) from R&D (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies were used at doses titrated in our lab. Cytokine stimulation. Enriched NK cells (unless mentioned otherwise, 5×10 4 per well in triplicate per condition) were cultured overnight in the presence of 60 U/ml of IL-2. Various concentrations of IL-12, IL-18 or IL-33 or (Peprotech®, Rocky Hill, NJ) were added to cultures for 6 to 16 hours. Cell-free supernatant was collected and analyzed by ELISA for levels of human IFN-, TNF and GM-CSF (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA). For inhibition of mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) activity, 125 nM (measured IC50) of the selective p38 MAPK inhibitor Pamapimod (R-1503, Selleckchem, Houston, TX) was added 150 minutes prior to cytokine stimulation. The inhibition of MK2 (p38/mitogen-activated protein kinaseactivated protein kinase 2) was performed with 5 M MK2 IV (CAYMAN chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). The inhibition of ADAM-17 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease-17) was performed by adding 8 M TAPI-1 (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA). TAPI-1 and MK2 IV were added 60 minutes before cytokine stimulation. At the tested concentrations, none of the tested inhibitor affected cell viability (data not shown). mRNA stability assay. Primary human NK cells were cultured at 1×10 5 cell per well. Cells were treated with media (0.1% DMSO), IL-12 (2.5 ng/ml) with or without IL-33 (10 ng/ml). Actinomycin D (5 μg/mL, Sigma) was added to cell cultures 4 hours after cytokine treatment, and RNA was isolated before addition of actinomycin D and 2 hours after addition of actinomycin D. RNA was extracted from NK cells with RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. The detection of IFNG, TNF, IL5 and IL13 mRNA expression was performed by using TaqMan® probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Statistical analysis. We performed statistical analyses using GraphPad Prism 8.01. We used two-way ANOVA to identify the contribution to multiple variables to an experimental measurement. We used one-way ANOVA to perform multiple comparisons between experimental conditions. The specific statistical analysis test used is indicated in each figure legend.
