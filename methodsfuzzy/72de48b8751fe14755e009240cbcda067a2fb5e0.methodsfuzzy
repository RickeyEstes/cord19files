Recent technological advances have enhanced the identification and characterisation of the vast microbial diversity colonising the human body (commensals and pathogens). Metagenomic analyses are being used to describe polymicrobial ecosystems, flowcells are being used to study microbial interactions in biofilms, and other molecular methods are being used to identify unique microbial species and phylotypes in complex ecosystems 24, 25 . However, many of these techniques have not yet reached laboratories in a scale to assist clinicians in practice. Traditional therapies are generally targeted at individual causative agents without consideration for effect on a polymicrobial cause or on individual members of microbial communities. In some cases, there are beneficial consequences. In Africa, HIV infection is concentrated in patients with tuberculosis. 26 Antiretroviral drugs reduce the incidence of tuberculosis to that observed immediately after HIV seroconversion. 26 spectrum antibiotics may kill polymicrobial anaerobic flora and reduce colonisation resistance of the intestinal tract, particularly for acquisition of multiresistant bacteria such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci. 27 Probiotics also use microbial interference as a mechanism for novel prophylactic or therapeutic management of polymicrobial diseases. Treatment of patients with Saccharomyces boulardii, lactobacilli, or enterococci prevents or reduces the duration of gastroenteritis caused by bacteria and rotaviruses, 28 and treatment with other lactobacilli, such as L fermentum, L rhamnosus, or L crispatus, has the potential to reduce vaginal infections. 29 The medical community is recognising the significance of polymicrobial diseases and the major types of microbial community interactions associated with human health and disease. Many traditional therapies are just starting to take into account the polymicrobial cause of diseases and the repercussions of treatment and prevention. The use of vaccines to control Strep pneumoniae infection in healthy children may have adverse effects. Regev-Yochay and colleagues 21 suggest that the mechanism of bacterial interference by Strep pneumoniae carriage on Staph aureus carriage could be disrupted by vaccinating children with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines that reduce nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine-type Strep pneumoniae. Bogaert and colleagues 20 suggest that children vaccinated with a 7-valent pneumococcal-conjugate vaccine became colonised with non-vaccine Strep pneumoniae serotypes and had higher rates of Staph-aureus-related acute otitis media after vaccination. Both conclude that more work is needed to ascertain the potential effects of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination on both Staph aureus carriage and the development of Staph-aureus-related disease.
