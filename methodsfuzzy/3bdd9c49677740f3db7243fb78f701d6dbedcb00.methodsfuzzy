We set up the model parameters (relevant to transmission dynamics) and initial conditions to closely mimic the actual Ebola outbreak in Guinea with a total population of 12 millions, that is, N ¼ 12 Â 10 6 . Since we have used the decaying transmission rate to reflect the impact of other intervention measures on transmission dynamics, we will focus on the impact of convalescent treatment on CFR reduction when all infected cases are identified and receive palliative care. Hence the death rate μ of unidentified cases is assumed to be zero. As reported in WHO (2014b), the mean time from symptom onset to case identification is around 5 days, so we let κ ¼ 0:2. We use the estimation results for Guinea in Althaus (2014) : the basic reproduction number R 0 is estimated to be 1.51, and the rate r ¼0.0023 at which control measures reduce transmission. The value of β 0 and the transmission rate function β are determined by R 0 , r, κ, and μ in the above settings. The robustness of the results is discussed via sensitivity analysis in Fig. 8 . There is no evidence shown that successful blood transfusion can shorten the recovery period of a patient. Hence, we assume that the average time for hospitalization is 20 days, which coincides with that of Mupapa et al. (1999) . If the hospitalization period of a patient with palliative care alone is 1=γ P , then for patients switch from palliative care to convalescent therapy, we can use the equation 1=η þ 1=γ T ¼ 1=γ P to estimate the value γ T . In our simulations, we will also set μ P ¼ 3γ P =7; μ T ¼ γ T =7 to reflect the death ratios under two different treatments, one is 70% for palliative care (Kucharski and Edmunds, 2014) and the other is 12.5% for blood transfusion treatment (Mupapa et al., 1999) . We assume α ¼ ω, which means that all donated blood are handled properly and the wasted blood is solely due to the expiration. The ranges of αð ¼ ωÞ and ξ are obtained by estimating possible ranges of the corresponding daily percentages of donors who make donations, and donors who lost contact, as shown in Table 1 . As an illustration, we show how to estimate the value α. We consider a group of donors, denoted by D(t) at time t, who never lose contacts, and the only loss rate is due to donation. Hence, D 0 ðtÞ ¼ ÀαDðtÞ for t Z 0 and DðtÞ ¼ Dð0ÞexpðÀαtÞ. It follows that the percentage of donors who donate in a certain day from time t to t þ 1 is p d ¼ 1 À Dðt þ 1Þ=DðtÞ ¼ 1 À expðÀαÞ and α ¼ Àlnð1 À p d Þ.
