Receptor Preparation. The 40 protein receptors of the DUD 28 were downloaded from the DUD website (http://dud. docking.org/). All ligands and water molecules were removed. Hydrogen atoms were added to the protein structures (neutral pH) and hydrogen bonds were optimized using Schrodinger Maestro's Protein Preparation Wizard. 61 These processed models were then converted to the AutoDock PDBQT format with MGLTools 1.5.4 33 for use in the Vina and NNScore screens. Ligand Preparation. Models of ligands known to bind to the 40 DUD receptors were likewise downloaded from the DUD website. Additionally, the compounds of the NCI diversity set III were obtained from the website of the NCI/ NIH Developmental Therapeutics program (http://dtp.nci.nih. gov/). All these small molecules were processed with Schrodinger's LigPrep module to generate models with appropriate tautomeric, isomeric, and ionization states for pH values ranging from 5.0 to 9.0. These models were ultimately converted to the PDBQT format using MGLTools 1.5.4 33 for use in the Vina and NNScore screens, and to the SDF format for use in the Glide screens. A few molecular models could not be generated; 1560 NCI models were ultimately used in the virtual screens. Docking Parameters. For Vina docking, the default parameters were used. All ligands were docked into regions (boxes) centered on the respective receptor binding pockets. The centers and dimensions of the boxes were taken from the DUD. Edge lengths ranged from 35.9 to 50.0 Å, and box volumes ranged from 56,365.8 to 88,845.5 Å 3 . Each Vina docking generated multiple poses. For the Vina analysis, the best-scoring pose as judged by the Vina docking score was used. For the NNScore analysis, all Vina poses were reevaluated with NNScore 1.0 18 and NNScore 2.0, 19 and the best-scoring Vina pose as judged by NNScore was considered for subsequent analysis. In the case of NNScore 1.0, the original programmers provided 24 neural networks that were particularly adept at identifying potent ligands when given descriptors of crystallographic ligand−receptor complexes. The final NN1 scores for each docking were derived by averaging the output of these 24 networks. For Glide docking, parameters similar to the defaults were likewise used. The docking grid was defined by two cubes centered on the DUD-specified active sites. The inner cube, with 14 Å edges, imposed restrictions on the location of the ligand center, and the outer cube, with 45 Å edges, imposed restrictions on the location of all ligand atoms. For each system, both the positive controls and the compounds of the NCI diversity set III were first docked with Glide HTVS. To test more advanced Glide docking protocols, the top 50% of these compounds were subsequently docked with Glide SP, and the top 25% of the remaining compounds were docked with Glide XP. 34 Glide-HTVS-and Glide-XP-docked models were also rescored with NNScore 1.0 and 2.0. The default parameters were again used for both. In all screens, where there were multiple models of a distinct compound due to alternate tautomeric, stereoisomeric, or protonation states, the best-scoring model was selected, and all others were discarded. Calculating Molecular Properties. Molecular properties were calculated using Schrodinger's Maestro suite. Compounds were processed with LigPrep to optimize geometry and ensure electrical neutrality. QikProp was then used to calculate molecular properties. Assessing the Performance of the Virtual Screens. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC 35 ) curves can be generated when performing virtual screens of compound libraries that include known binders. Following docking and scoring, the compounds are ordered by their docking scores. A moving cutoff is then employed that sweeps from the best predicted binder to the worst. At each cutoff, the list of compounds is partitioned. The compounds above the cutoff are tentatively considered to be binders, and the compounds below are considered to be nonbinders. If all compounds not known to be binders are considered decoys, true and false positive rates can then be calculated for each partition. The ROC curve is generated by plotting all (false positive rate, true positive rate) points. ROC or partial ROC curves were calculated for all screens. The trapezoidal rule was used to determine the areas under these curves.
