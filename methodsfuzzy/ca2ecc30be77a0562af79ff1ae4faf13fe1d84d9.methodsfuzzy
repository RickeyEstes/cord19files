A total of 2069 cats sent for necropsy to the Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of Giessen, West Germany, were investigated immunohistologically from 1980 to 1988 for persistent FeLV infection. The results from 1095 cats were studied statistically (Chi square, Fisher's and Kruskal-Wallis test) for significant association between diseases and conditions of the animals and FeLV infection. The control population for these statistical tests consisted of cats killed by trauma, a cause of death presumptively not FeLV-associated. The immunohistological examination of tissues fixed in methanol and embedded in paraffin was done as published previously (Reinacher and Theilen, 1987) . Briefly, endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubation for 30 rain in methanol containing 0.5% H202. An indirect immunoperoxidase method was performed with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against the FeLV proteins p27 and gp70. Peroxidase activity bound to the tissues was visualized with diaminobenzidine.
