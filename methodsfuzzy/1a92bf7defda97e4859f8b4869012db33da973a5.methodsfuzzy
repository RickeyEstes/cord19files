Before initiation of cross-circulation, a swine behavior training program (Table E7 ) was implemented to acclimate recipient swine to the custom enclosure ( Figure E2 ). Target training (ie, conditioning swine to touch nose to target when the trainer activated an audible clicker) was initiated at least 14 days before the start of cross-circulation and was used to encourage recipient swine to enter the custom enclosure by day 4 of training ( Figure E5, A) . Initially, swine were maintained in the custom enclosure for up to 1 hour. Through days 5 to 14 of training, recipient swine were maintained in the custom enclosure for at least 2 hours per day to increase comfort and familiarity with the experimental environment. The width of the custom enclosure was incrementally reduced to limit rotational movements ( Figure E5 , B). Behavior training was essential to minimize stress and maximize comfort of recipient swine, and thus decrease risk of decannulation during cross-circulation procedures. Throughout the preprocedure behavior training program, recipient swine experienced enrichment with manipulata ( Figure E5 , C), social interactions with procedure personnel ( Figure E5, D) , and standard and high-quality edible treats.
