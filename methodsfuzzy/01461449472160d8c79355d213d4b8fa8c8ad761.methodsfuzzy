Bioconductor package LIMMA (linear models for microarray data) 13, 14 (Bioconductor, Buffalo, NY) was used for differential gene expression analysis for normalized log 2 -transformed counts of RNASeq data. To avoid overinterpretation, we only included genes with at least 1 read per million mapped reads in at least 30 samples. LIMMA was used in conjunction with voom, which weighs the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts needed for accurate generalized linear modeling. A candidate list of differentially expressed genes were identified based on an absolute fold change >2.0 and Benjamini−Hochberg adjusted p-value of LIMMA's moderated t-test (p < 0.05). For functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis, the candidate probes were analyzed in the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), 15 and processes and pathways were selected based on Benjamini−Hochberg adjusted p-values < 0.05. 16 Principal component analysis (PCA) 17 was used to visualize the separation of the 2 groups. Further unsupervised hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed probes was done by applying the Ward's minimum variance criterion linkage method 18 with Euclidean distance and presented in a heatmap. For the construction of a classification model, we first split the 219 subjects randomly into a training set and a testing set with a ratio of 70:30. We summarized subject characteristics as means with standard deviation, medians with interquartile ranges, or proportions. Characteristics were compared between training and testing sets using Student's t-test, Mann−Whitney, Fisher's exact, or chi-square testing as appropriate. A logistic regression model was fit using recursive feature elimination with 5-fold cross-validation to reduce the number of predictors and thus achieve a parsimonious model. 19 In the model fitting process, a receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (AUC) was the metric used for selecting the optimal model. Threshold selection was based on model performance metrics in the training set. We then validated the threshold in the testing set. In addition, Cox proportional hazard models and Kaplan−Meier curves were fit for CLAD-free survival and compared between groups diagnosed with A-grade ACR on biopsy vs all other clinical conditions, and between predicted ACR vs no predicted ACR using the genomic classifier model. Most statistical analyses were conducted using the Bioconductor suite of packages, 20 and Package "caret" 21 in the R statistical software environment version 3.3.1. 22 Kaplan−Meier analyses for CLAD-free survival were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.05 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, www. graphpad.com). The data discussed in this publication are available in the Mendeley Data open research data repository.
