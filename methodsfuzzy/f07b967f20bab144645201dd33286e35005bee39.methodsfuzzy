Study design, population and setting From 1 November 2005 to 30 April 2006, we conducted a prospective, observational study in the ED of National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. The hospital is a tertiary care facility serving a metropolitan area of 2.65 million. The annual ED census is about 100,000. HCWs included doctors (emergency physicians and rotating residents), nursing staff and trainees, i.e. medical students, nursing students and emergency medical technicians (EMTs), for educational purposes. During the study period, the initial 15-min segments of CPR for persons in the resuscitation room with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) were recorded by digital cameras from two separate angles. Any resuscitation of adults with OHCA was eligible for recording. OHCA patients younger than 18 years or with cardiac arrest due to traumatic events were excluded. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Taiwan University Hospital. The location of the two digital cameras and the spatial arrangement of equipment and personnel in the resuscitation room are shown in Figure 1 . The areas in the resuscitation room were defined as either 'contaminated' or 'clean' zones. The grey-dotted area in the diagram, containing patient stretcher, defibrillator and ventilator connection, was defined as contaminated because apparatus in this area would be in direct contact with the patient during resuscitation. Equipment in this area was disinfected after each use according to the concept of standard precautions, because the patient might be a carrier of unrecognised contagious disease. The other area in the resuscitation room was defined as clean; disinfection was not carried out after each resuscitation effort. The area definition was predetermined by the infection control team in the ED and was included in infection control education for all HCWs in the ED.
