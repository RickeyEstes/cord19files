Given that one established effector of IFITM1 is IFNγ [35] , we evaluated IFNγ responsive protein synthesis in IFNγ stimulated parental SiHa, IFITM1 single null, and IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cells. The parental SiHa, IFITM1 single null, and IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cells were treated with heavy isotopic amino acid labeling media (the SILAC method) for 6 or 24 h, in the absence or presence of IFNγ (Fig. 4) . Cell lysates were then processed by FASP [30, 31] and then analyzed for IFITM1/3-dependent protein synthesis using mass spectrometry. The SILAC methodology has been subjected to an analysis of random error associated with the multiple steps in this approach including; cell plating in biological replicates, switch to heavy isotopic media, cell recovery from plastic plates, cell lysis, centrifugation, filter assisted trypsinization, and tryptic peptide recovery and processing. This error can be reduced by employing multiple replicates (n = 3) as highlighted previously [42] . To highlight the importance of biological replicates and the inherent error in this multiple step process, we plot the data not as an average of three replicates, but as individual points from all three replicates (as in Supplementary Fig. 2 and Fig. 5) . The dominant IFNγ responsive protein to be identified at 6-h post labelling is IRF1 protein (Supplementary Fig. 2B vs 2A) with an attenuation of isotopically labeled IRF1 peptides recovered in the biological triplicates from IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cells ( Supplementary  Fig. 2H ). This suggests that IRF1 is partially dependent upon IFITM1/3 signalling and this was confirmed using IRF1 transcriptional reporter assays (data not shown). This data provides some degree of confidence that the methodology is able to identify a known IFNγ responsive target (IRF1). There are other proteins whose synthesis was detected at 6 hours post-isotopic labelling including STAT1, EIF1, and B2M ( Supplementary Fig. 2I-K) . EIF1 is not known to be linked to interferon signalling, but it is known to regulate the accuracy of AUG codon selection by the scanning pre-initiation complexes [43] . EIF1 might prove to be involved in regulating interferon dependent anti-viral mRNA selection. Nevertheless, all three proteins are also IFTM1/3-independent ( Supplementary Fig. 2I-K) . STAT1 and B2M are also both known IFNγ responsive proteins further validating the methodology used to measure quantitative changes in protein synthesis. That all three proteins (STAT1, EIF1, and B2M) exhibit equivalent protein synthesis rates in the parental and double-null cell model indicates that the double null has retained many key regulatory features of the parental cell. This suggests that many IFN regulatory features of the double null cell have been retained despite the selection process creating the cell model. By 24-h post IFNγ treatment of SiHa cells, HLA family members, B2M, and STAT1 proteins were detected (Fig. 5B vs 5A) , again indicating that the methodology can detected known IFNγ inducible proteins. By 24-h post IFNγ treatment, isotopically labeled IRF1 Fig. 1 . Immunohistochemical analysis of IFITM1/3 protein expression in cervical cancers using the Mab-MHK. Formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded cervical carcinoma tissue was processed as stated in the Experimental Procedures using the Mab-MHK that binds to shared epitopes in the N-terminal domains of IFITM1 and IFITM3 ( Supplementary Fig. 1A, B) . peptides are attenuated (Fig. 5H) , which is consistent with the early and transient induction of IRF1 by IFNγ. The synthesis of MHC Class I molecules was IFITM1/3-dependent (Fig. 5B vs 5F ; quantified in biological triplicates in Fig. 5L ). All three, major HLA alleles exhibited attenuated synthesis in the double null cell, as defined using the tryptic peptide coverage (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Isotopically labeled ISG15 tryptic peptides are also not observed in the early interferon response ( Supplementary Fig. 2) , and the isotopically labeled ISG15 peptide recovery after 24 h is attenuated in the IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cells (quantified in biological triplicates in Fig. 5G ) suggesting that ISG15 protein synthesis is largely IFITM1/3 dependent. By contrast, STAT1 protein synthesis at 24 h appears largely IFITM1/3-independent (quantified in biological triplicates in Fig. 5I ). Providing another internal control, another well-known inducible IFNγ protein, B2M, exhibits equivalent synthesis in the IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cell (quantified in biological triplicates in Fig. 5K ). This indicates that one key regulatory feature of the double null cell, STAT1 production, has remained intact.
