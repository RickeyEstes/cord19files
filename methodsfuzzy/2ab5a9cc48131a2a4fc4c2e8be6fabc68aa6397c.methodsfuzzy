The study was conducted in the PICU of Children's Hospital Béchir Hamza of Tunis. The PICU is in a university-affiliated children's hospital and provides intensive care services to a national pediatric population of 850 000 children less than 15 years old. The hospital has 360 beds, and the PICU has 16 beds (500 admissions /year). Data collection: Since 2009, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of Bordetella pertussis was performed on nasopharyngeal and/or tracheal secretions for all patients admitted with suspected pertussis or bronchioltis. Suspected pertussis symptoms were consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) definition case. 4 Nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) obtained by aspiration on sterile tubes were the specimens of choice for Bordetella detection by culture and/or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Tracheal samplings were also accepted. Time from specimen collection to receipt in the laboratory was 20 min to 2 days, with no transport additives. The RT-PCR targets include the IS481, commonly found in B. pertussis, B. bronchiseptica, and B. holmesii; the IS1001, specific of B. parapertussis, in combination with the pertussis toxin promoter region gene (ptx) of B. pertussis; and the recA gene-specific of B. holmesii. NPS and/or tracheal sampling for viral detection through RT-PCR were also performed in all infants. We reviewed the medical charts of 17 children [median age 56 days (range 24-630); sex-ratio: 0.88] admitted to our PICU between 01 January to 31 October 2013 for confirmed CP by RT-PCR. Only mechanically ventilated patients were included. Clinical data included: patient demographics, neonatal history, immunization status, presentation. Routine laboratory data and chest radiographs were also performed at admission in order to reveal infiltrate or consolidation imagings. Severity of Pediatric Risk of Mortality Score (PRISM) was evaluated at the time of PICU admission. During the hospitalization, the presence of complications and coinfections with viral or bacterial pathogens were checked, and all therapeutic interventions, including duration of respiratory or circulatory support with or without sedation, muscle paralysis, inhalation of nitric oxide were recorded. Extracorporeal Membrane Oxigenation (ECMO) treatment was not available in Children's Hospital Béchir Hamza PICU. Based on the outcome, we divided subjects on two groups "survival" and "deaths" and we studied risk factors for poor outcome. Statistics: Data analysis was performed using SPSS (version 17.0). Mann-Whitney test, Fisher exact test were applied as appropriate. A 2-sided P < 0.05 was considered significant.
