(a) Site-specific mutagenrsia Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out. hy a procedure based on that described by Kunkel (1985; Brierley el nl., 1989) . 411 the plasmids used in t,his study contain the intergenir region of the filamentous bacteriophage fl (Dotto et al., 1981) enabling single-stranded plasmid DNA to be generated following infection of plasmid-carrying bacteria with bacteriophage R408 (R~sel et al., 1986) . I7racil-containing. single-stranded DXA4 substrates for mutagenesis were prepared by R408-superinfection of plasmid-carrying Escherichia coli RZ1032 (*ells (dutung-; Kunkel. 1985) . Oligonucleotides for mutagenesis were synthesized using an Applied Riosystems 3814 DSA synthesizer and the mutagenesis react,ions performed as before (Brierley et al., 1989) . Mutants were identified by dideoxy sequencing (Sanger et al., 1977) (Hames. 1981 region. To confirm that ribosomes frameshift at the UUUAAAC sequence, two mutant derivatives of pFS8 were prepared. In pFS8.5, the la frame (zero frame) glycine codon immediately downstream from the UUUAAAC sequence was converted by muta-genesis to a stop codon (UGA). In pFS8.19, the same mutation was introduced but in addition the leucine codon just upstream from the UUUAAAC stretch (in the -1 or lb frame) was changed to a termination codon (UAA). In pFS8.19, the upstream and downstream ORFs of the reporter gene overlap solely by the seven nucleotides that constitute the putative slip-site UUUAAAC. For ribosomal frameshifting to be observed in this mutant, ribosomes would have to slip within the heptanucleotide sequence. As can be seen in Figure  2 (b), both pFS8.5 and pFS8.19 show frameshifting at wild-type levels, demonstrating that frameshifting does indeed occur at' this position. (b) A frameshift cassette to monitor all reading f Tame8 We wished to design a construct in which frameshifting into any reading frame could be monitored simultaneously, since this was not possible with pFS8. As the wild-type IBV pseudoknot contains a number of stop codons, we firstly designed an artificial "minimal" pseudoknot based on our knowledge of t,his RNA structure (Brierley et al., 19911 , in which loop 2 was reduced from 32 to only 8 nucleotides in length, and all the termination codons were changed to sense codons (see Fig. 3 ). The changes were carefully chosen so as to form a pseudoknot whose structure and predicted stability bore close resemblance to the wild-type pseudoknot. As can be seen in Figure 3 , the minimal pseudoknot differs from the wild-type in a number of ways; loop 2 is 24 nucleotides shorter, the G-A mismatched pair in stem 1 of the wild-type pseudoknot is replaced by a G.U base-pair, the G nucleotide of loop 1 of the wild-type structure is replaced by a C nucleotide and, finally, the minimal pseudoknot has ,no stop codons. There is no difference in the lengths of the two stems in each structure. Previous work (Brierley et al., 1991) has shown that mutations that change the nucleotide sequence of the pseudoknot without greatly influencing the overall structure do not inhibit the frameshift process. Thus, reducing the length of loop 2 to eight nucleotides and changing the sequence of loop 1 ought not to influence frameshifting. However, by replacing the mismatched G-A pair in stem 1 by G.U, one may expect, a moderate increase in the stability of stem 1 and hence a small increase in the frameshift efficiency (Brierlev et aZ., 1991; see later). Having designed the minimal pseudoknot, we then searched available reporter genes for regions in which significant lengths of ORF were present in all three frames. A suitable candidate found was the influenza PB2 gene that contained such a region just downstream from a unique BgZII site beginning at position 456 (Young et al., 1983) . Our strategy wa,s to clone the minimal pseudoknot into the BgZII site such that, the upstream portion of the PB2 gene was in-frame with the IBV la coding region. As the downstream PB2 information was open (to a greater or lesser extent) in all three reading frames, we with a mismatched pair (G7-A24) in stem 1. The singlestranded connecting loops contain 2 (loop 1) and 32 (loop 2) nucleotides, respectively. The termination codon of the la ORF (UGA) is boxed, as is the slippery sequence (UCUAAAC). The nucleotides in loop 2 that, were retained in the minimal pseudoknot are in a larger, bold font. In the minimal pseudoknot, which contains no termination codons, the stems are of the same length and base-pair composition as the wild-type pseudoknot, except that the G7-A24, mismatched pair is replaced by a IJ7.G24 pair. Three other differences are present; the loop 1 G nucleotide is changed to a C; loop 2 contains only 8 of the 32 nucleotides present in the wild%type structure, and the glycine codon immediately downstream from the slippery sequence is replaced by a termination codon (in the la reading frame). could monitor frameshifting into any frame simultaneously by examining the size of the frameshift products on SDS/polyacrylamide gels. The strategy for the construction of this plasmid is shown in Figure 4 and detailed in Materials and Methods. An oligonucleotide (90mer) was synthesized that contained sequences complementary to the minimal pseudoknot, the slip-sequence and a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter. A shorter oligonucleotide was then annealed that contained the reverse complement of the T7 promoter sequence and the single-stranded regions filled by primer extension using the large fragment of DNA polymerase I. The blunt-ended molecules were selfligated and then digested with BglII. The resulting BgZII pseudoknot "cassette" was cloned into the BglII site of plasmid pING12 at the aforementioned site in the PB2 gene. The construct was then modified in two ways. Firstly, an inconvenient termination codon (UAA) within one of the PB2 frames was changed to serine (UCA), such that the particular frame in question (zero frame) was extended by some 60 amino acid codons in order to ease assignment of translation products to reading frame. Secondly, a PvuII restriction site was introduced at the 3' end of the inserted cassette. This was carried out to remove a termination codon that was inad-vertently missed during design of the long oligonucleotide, and to provide a suitable restriction site 46X I. Brie&y et al. Figure 4 . The construction of plasmid pFScass5 has been described in detail in the text. Briefly. an oligonucleotide containing sequences complementary to a T7 promoter and the IBV minimal pseudoknot (oligol) was annealed to an oligonucleotide containing the T7 promoter sequence (oligo2) and the single-stranded regions filled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Following self-ligation, a BglII frameshift-signal-containing DNA fragment was isolated and ligated into a reporter gene, the influenza PI32 gene, to create pFScass5. The diagram of pFScass5 shows the minimal frameshift signal (in white) flanked by the influenza PB2 reporter gene (shaded). Linearization of the plasmid with BamHl and in. vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase yields an mRNA (2.4 kb) that. when translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, is predicted to produce a 19 kDa product corresponding to ribosomes that terminate at the new la termination codon (UGA) located immediately downstream from the CUUAAAC sequence (stippled), and a 22 kDa ( -1) frameshift product. Any ribosomes that enter the -2/ + 1 reading frame would produce an 85 kDa product, and any zero frame ribosomes, a 28 kDa product. Plasmids pFScass6 and 7 differ from pFScass5 only by the deletion (pFScass6) or insertion (pFScass7) of a single C nucleotide just downstream from the inserted frameshift cassette. for the generation of short, pseudoknot-containing T7 transcripts for structural studies (not addressed here). The resulting construct, pFScass5 is shown in Figure 4 . any ribosomes that enter the -2 (or + 1) phase would give an 85 kDa product, and a 28 kDa product would be seen for any ribosomes that, do not frameshift yet in some way suppress the termination codon and continue translation in the zero reading frame. (c) The IBV frameshift is strictly into the -I phase Shown in Figure  5 are the translation products from pFScass5 and two related constructs, pFScass6 and 7, which differ from pFScass5 only by The 2 stacked stems of the pseudoknot are drawn horizontally and are shaded. A number of mutants created in pFScass5 are depicted. In 5.39, the T7 promoter was deleted but the la frame was maintained. A number of spacing mutants (pSM) are shown in which 1 or 2 nucleotides were deleted or inserted from the spacer sequence. These mutants were prepared in the background of either pFScass6 or 7 such that frameshifted ribosomes produce a 22 kDa product in each case (see the text). A mutation at the base of stem 1, and known to destabilize the wild-type RNA pseudoknot (Brierley et al., 1991) was also prepared (5.15, CCCC to GGGG). The gel shows the reticulocyte lysate translation products synthesized in response to mRNAs derived from BarnHI-digested pFScass5 or mutant templates. Polypeptides were labelled with [35S]methionine. separated on an SDS/17.5O& polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. the deletion (pFScass6) or addition (pFScass7) of a C nucleotide downstream from the cassette. Insertion or deletion of the single nucleotide ought to reassign the translation products to a different class of frameshift. Thus in pFScass6, the -1 frame is 28 kDa; the -2( + l), 22 kDa and the zero frame 85 kDa. In pFScass7, the -1 frame is 85 kDa, the -2( + 1) frame 28 kDa and the zero frame, 22 kDa. As can be seen from the translations the constructs produced the expected -1 frameshift products; 22 kDa in pFScass5,28 kDa in pFScass6 and 85 kDa in pFScass7. Thus, all the predicted open reading frames were present and correct. Estimates of the frameshift efficiency of the constructs indicate that some 40% of ribosomes enter the -1 phase at the frameshift site. This is some 10% higher than that seen in the wild-type pseudoknot construct (pFS8) and probably reflects, at least in part, the increased stability of the stem 1 helix in the pFScass constructs. (Using the base-stacking rules of Turner et al. (1988) it can be estimated that introducing the G*U base-pair in stem 1 increases the helix stability by 38 kcal mol-' (1 cal = 4.184 J), from -12.4 kcal mol-' (stem 1 of pFS8) to -16.2 kcal mol-' (stem 1 of pFScass5).) In the pFScass5 translation, the absence of significant quantities of 85 kDa product suggests strongly that frameshifting is strictly into the -1 reading frame. Although a +2 shift would place ribosomes in the same phase, it is very unlikely that this occurs, since the ribosome-bound tRNAs could form only one P-site mRNA-tRNA base-pair and no A-site pairs following a + 2 slip. In addition, we have shown previously that the primary sequence of the triplet downstream from the slip sequence is unimportant in the frameshift process (Brierley et al., 1989) . Furthermore, a + 2 slip is not compatible with the results of amino acid sequencing of retroviral trans-frame proteins (see Introduction). In order to check that the frameshift observed in pFScass5 was dependent upon the downstream pseudoknot, we made a destabilizing change at the base of stem 1 in pFScass5.15 (see Fig. 5 transcriptions. However, when the T7 promoter was deleted in construct pFScass 5.39 (Fig. 5) , the minor products were still present. It is therefore more likely that these proteins arise as a result of low-level aberrant translation events in the in V&O system. Although it is likely that some minor products may co-migrate with the authentic stopped and frameshift products on the gels, the comparative abundance of the minor bands is low, and hence can introduce only a small error into the calculated frameshift efficiencies.
