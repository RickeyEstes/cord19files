The calves were weighed using a scale on the day of birth as well as on days 21, 42 and 63. Each calf was examined daily by inspection for any clinical symptoms in the morning throughout the study period. Blood samples were collected from each calf by puncture of the Vena jugularis on day 4; serum was isolated by centrifugation and stored at −20°C until examination. A total of 17 fecal samples were rectally collected from each calf (in the morning of days 4-14, 16, 18, 21, 28, 42 and 63), labeled and kept at + 4°C until examination. The consistency of fecal samples was estimated by scoring (solid = score 0, semi-liquid = 1, and watery = 2; Joachim et al., 2003) . Two of the four calves that died during the study were necropsied by an external laboratory. For all 1713 fecal samples examined the results (positive vs. negative) of the coproantigen immunochromatography substantially agreed with those of the carbol-fuchsin fecal smear staining (kappa value: 0.85; 95% confidence interval: 0.80-0.89). The relative sensitivity and relative specificity of the staining method was 88.9% (86.5-91.0%) and 95.3% (93.7-96.5%), respectively, employing the immunochromatography as relative gold standard. The scoring results of both methods were highly correlated (r s = 0.867; p < 0.001).
