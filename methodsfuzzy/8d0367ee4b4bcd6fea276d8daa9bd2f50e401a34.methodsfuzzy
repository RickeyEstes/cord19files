Detection of standard respiratory viruses -The nasopharyngeal and tracheal secretion samples received in the laboratory in June, July and August 2016 were tested for the respiratory virus diagnostic panel performed in Lacen-DF (Public health laboratory located in the Federal District, Brazil) by the standard RT-qPCR (for Influenza A, Influenza B, Human respiratory syncytial virus, Human metapneumovirus, Human adenovirus C, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2 and Parainfluenza 3). Those that had negative results were separated and stored in freezer -70ºC for subsequent DNA/RNA extraction for HTS. RNA/DNA extraction -Fifty one samples from June, 55 from July and 39 from August of 2016 were mixed, respectively (one for each month), and treated as three pooled samples. Individual sample had a volume of approximately 0.5 mL (total of 20-25 mL of each pooled sample). The volume was adjusted to 50 mL with 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH7.2) with Triton-X 100 at the final concentration of 1%. The solution in tubes were agitated for 1 h in a cold chamber, then, centrifuged at 4,800 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged with 20% sucrose cushion at 140,000 × g for 1 h using Ti45 rotor (Optima L-90K Ultracentrifuge, Beckman Coulter, Brea, USA). The pellet was resuspended in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer and DNA/RNA was extracted from the resuspended pellet following the instructions of the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland), without addition of carrier RNA in the lysis buffer. Three DNA/RNA samples were subjected to HTS. Next, part of all three samples were treated with DNase I (Promega, Madison, USA) in order to decrease the human or bacterial DNA in the sample for viral RNA enrichment. However, due to low amount of RNA after DNase I treatment, all three samples were mixed as one pooled sample for RNA HTS. High-throughput sequencing -Approximately two μg of DNA/RNA and RNA samples in RNAStable tube (Biomatrica, San Diego, USA) were sent for HTS to Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, South Korea). The library of DNA/RNA or RNA samples was constructed using TruSeq Standard total RNA kit and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 with 3 G scale for each in 100 base pared-end. Bioinformatics analysis -Low quality and adapter sequences of the raw data were trimmed using the Trimommatic tool v.036. (15) Metagenomic reads of each sample were then uploaded to Kaiju for profiling the reads in taxonomic assessment (http://kaiju.binf.ku.dk). (16) DNA reads were filtered with BWA v0.7.17 (17) and SAMtools v1.9 (18) against reference hg38 (Homo sapiens) obtained from GenBank to remove human DNA sequences from HTS dataset in silico. Trimmed reads were assembled into contiguous sequences ('contigs') with Velvet v.1.2.1 (19) and SPAdes v.3.9 (20) programs. The tBlastx search (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ Blast.cgi) against the viral genome package (RefSeq Virus, NCBI, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/) which is implemented in the Geneious R8.1 program (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand) was used to identify the contig sequences which were viral origins. The analyses showed that nasopharyngeal secretion pooled samples of June, July and August of 2016 had similar metagenomic profiles in relation to the components of microorganisms classified found: predominance of viruses [Supplementary data (Figure) ], followed by bacteria and other microorganisms, such as Archaeas. However, the higher recovery of viral sequences in DNA/RNA samples was considered as misinterpretation by Kaiju program since the later fine analyses using BLASTn found that many of the human DNA sequences present in the samples were recognised as DNA viruses due to the similarity of some genomic regions. After in silico filtration of the reads by human DNA sequences, 77.26% of reads were classified as microbial sequences for June (274,269 out of 354,975), 81.22% for July (242,730 out of 298,846) and 82.50% for August (312,605 out of 378,895). This result showed that the contamination of human DNA was problematic for virus sequence search in these samples. As the human chromosomal and microbial DNA masked the presence of RNA viruses in the total DNA/RNA samples, the amount of DNA was reduced by DNase I treatment and the samples were subjected to the HTS again as one RNA sample.
