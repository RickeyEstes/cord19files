This approach uses viral RNA, amplified either directly (one-step RT-PCR) or following cDNA synthesis (two-step RT-PCR). An RT-PCR assay was designed and introduced in 1991 for detecting the IBV-S2 gene [70] . Subsequently, general and serotype-specific RT-PCR assays were designed to target different regions and/or fragments ( Figure 10 ) in the IBV viral genome [71] [72] [73] . The UTR and N-gene-based RT-PCR are used for universal detection, because of the conserved nature of the target region in many IBV serotypes [68, 71] . A pan-coronavirus primer, targeting a conserved region of different coronavirus isolates, could also be used in one-step RT-PCR amplification of IBV strains [55] . However, amplification and sequencing of the S1 gene provide a reliable means for genotypic classification of new IBV strains [74] . A serotype-specific PCR assay has been designed to enable differentiation of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Arkansas, and Delaware field isolates [73] .
