The specificity of the four-plex assay was tested in two replicates on a list of materials, as shown in Table 1 . The RT-qPCR conditions were as described above. For materials where the copy number was known, a dilution of 200 cp/ml was used; for other materials a 1:10 and 1:100 dilution was used. Based on the literature, the Cq cut-off was set at 38. The sensitivity of the assay was determined for each method of the multiplex on a specific material (Table 1) by preparing a dilution series (1000, 100, 50, 10, 5, 1, 0.1 cp) in nuclease-free water and measuring each dilution two-fold in two independent runs under repeatability conditions (ISO24276, 2006) . Using samples from a proficiency test (QCMD 2016 Zika Virus EQA Pilot Study) and routine samples, all tested in duplicate, the parameters applicability and practicability were evaluated. For CHIKV, all four RT-qPCR methods that complied with the set criteria showed good sequence coverage and no oligonucleotide adaptations were necessary. The subsequent analysis showed a good performance for all four methods, as no primer/probe complementarities or self-annealing properties were detected and Tm values complied with standard PCR rules. In the titration experiment, two CHIKV methods performed well and were combined to form a duplex. For ZIKV, a similar procedure was followed. Four of the five retrieved methods were adapted after the alignment analysis to cover for genetic variation. All five, together with an in-house designed method, showed a good performance in the subsequent analysis. Based on the titration experiment, three methods were discarded (late Cq values for all primer/probe concentrations). The three remaining methods (all adapted from the literature) were combined into three duplex assays, of which one showed the best results. The two duplex assays, complying with the set criterion, were combined into a four-plex assay, which was subjected to the validation process evaluating the necessary acceptance parameters ( Figure 1) ; the optimal primer/probe concentrations that resulted from the titration experiment were used (Table 2) . Due to the limitation to four fluorophores, no internal control was added to the reaction. However, an external positive (and negative) control should always be included. The constructed RNA standard gave a specific positive reaction with the multiplex assay for all four methods and could thus be used effectively as a positive control. The cloned soybean 356043 GM plant sequence (EURL, 2010) allows testing for contamination; i.e., when a presumed negative control reacts positively with the ZIKV/CHIKV multiplex, running a PCR with the GM-specific primers/probes and its specific cycling programme will allow to determine whether the positivity comes from a contamination with the plasmid. To ensure a new PCR method is fit for purpose, a number of method acceptance parameters should be tested, such as the specificity and sensitivity, at the very least (cf MIQE guidelines (Bustin et al., 2009) ). As no specific guidelines are available for RT-qPCR methods for virus detection, the in-house validation was based on a combination of the methods reported by Saunders et al. (Saunders et al., 2013) and Broeders et al. (Broeders et al., 2014) and the basic specificity principles of ISO 22118 (ISO22118, 2011) and ISO 16140 (AFNOR, 2003) . For CHIKV, 521 full-length genomes were retrieved and the predictive SCREENED analysis showed that 99.8% and 97.1% were covered by CHIKV-a and CHIKV-b, respectively. CHIKV-a was expected to detect all genomes except KX168429.1 (Asia) due to a Table 3 Results of the sensitivity test for the four-plex RT-qPCR method for the detection of ZIKV and CHIKV.
