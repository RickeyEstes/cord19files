Cells and virus. Vero E6 cells were subcultured routinely in 75-cm 3 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 0.2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 lg/ml streptomycin, and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), and maintained at 37Â°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . The medium was changed to 2% FBS DMEM before virus infection. SARS-CoV, which was isolated as Frankfurt 1 and kindly provided by Dr. J. Ziebuhr, was used in the present study. Infection was usually performed at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5. DIs-N expressing N RNA of SARS-CoV and DIs-GFP expressing GFP RNA were described in our previous study [11] . Confluent Vero E6 cells were infected with DIs-N and -GFP at 5 m.o.i. Fixing and staining of cells. The cells in 24-well plates were fixed with 10% formaldehyde for at least 24 h, and stained with 0.1% naphthol blueblack for 30 min. This convenient method was described by Everitt and Wohlfart for determination of the actual or relative number of cells in anchorage culture [12] . After washing out with water, the plates were scanned with a GT-9400UF scanner (Epson, Tokyo, Japan). The dye-protein complexes were released hydrolytically with 0.1 M NaOH and measured spectrophotometrically at 660 nm. When cells and the supernatant contained infectious SARS-CoV, the cell number was counted using this method. The number of cells that did not contain SARS-CoV was counted using the WST-1 cell proliferation assay system (Takara, Shiga, Japan). Inhibitors. The JNK inhibitor, SP600125, and PI3K/Akt inhibitor, LY294002, were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA) and Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA, USA), respectively. These inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 10 mM. The same volume of DMSO alone was used as a control. Western blotting. The whole-cell extracts were electrophoresed on 5-20% gradient polyacrylamide gels, and transferred electrophoretically onto PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). In the present study, we applied two sets of samples to polyacrylamide gels, and the membranes were divided into two halves after blotting, or membranes were examined once using a LumiGLO Elite chemiluminescent system (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, ML, USA), and then stripped using Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) for the second detection. The following antibodies, obtained from Cell Signaling Technology Inc., were used in the present study at a dilution of 1:1000: rabbit anti-phospho Akt (Ser473) antibody, rabbit anti-Akt antibody, rabbit anti-phospho ERK (Thr202/ Tyr204) antibody, rabbit anti-ERK antibody, rabbit anti-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) antibody, rabbit anti-p38 MAPK antibody, rabbit antiphospho SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) antibody, rabbit anti-SAPK/JNK antibody, rabbit anti-phospho Bcl-2 (Ser 70) antibody, and anti-Bcl-xL antibody. Mouse anti-Bcl-2 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and used at a dilution of 1:500. Mouse antib-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma and used at a dilution of 1:5000. Rabbit anti-SARS Nucleocapsid protein antibody was described previously [3] .
