The analysis includes all imported infections seen on the infectious diseases ward as recorded in the ward data book, at Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge, UK over a 5-year period 1998 -2002. The records were checked against hospital case coding and the Hospital Episode Statistics data validation information from the Department of Health. All three gave a very similar data set. Cambridge is a University town in the Eastern Region with a population of around 120,000. The population catchment area of Addenbrooke's hospital is approximately 500,000, shared partly by two smaller district hospitals. There is a nearby international airport but with no transatlantic or longhaul flights. The ward is a 12-bedded dedicated infectious diseases unit in a large (1000 Ã¾ bed) teaching hospital, which acts as a local district general hospital but is also the regional infectious diseases referral centre. Only cases directly seen, investigated and treated by the infectious diseases team were included. Outpatient cases seen in clinics only were excluded. Those infections which were self-limiting presenting to other physicians were not covered. Also excluded was an analysis of sexually transmitted infections acquired abroad seen only by the sexually transmitted disease service. All cases of malaria were diagnosed initially by blood films, though non-falciparum cases additionally had an HRP-2 antigen test to further rule out falciparum infection in the advent of a dual infection being overlooked.
