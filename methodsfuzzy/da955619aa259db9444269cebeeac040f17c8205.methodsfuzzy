Reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as received. Dry solvents were obtained according to the standard procedures. Optical rotation: polAAr 3005 spectrometer; CHCl 3 soln 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded with a Bru- The purity of the target compounds was determined by gas chromatography methods. All of the target compounds reported in this paper have a purity of no less than 95%. Numeration of atoms in the compounds is given for assigning the signals in the NMR spectra and does not coincide with that for the names according to the nomenclature of compounds (see Supplementary data). Specific rotation is expressed as (deg ml) (g dm) -1 ; concentration is expressed as (g) (100 ml) -1 . (+)-Camphor (26 mmol) and N 1 ,N 1 -diethylethane-1,2-diamine (30 mmol) were mixed in toluene with catalytic BF 3 ÁEt 2 O (1-5 mol %), followed by azeotropic removal water with Dean-Stark for 15 h. Then the reaction mixture was washed with saturated NaCl solution. The organic layer was separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 (3 Â 10 ml). The combined organic phases were dried over Na 2 SO 4 . The solvent was evaporated. The residue was separated by vacuum distillation. T = 100-102°C at 1 torr. As a result we have obtained 2 in 94% yield (4.7 g, 24.4 mmol). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 10 h. This gave compound 3a (0.30 g, 0.4 mmol, 40%). Mp = 137-140°C. It was found that there is a 50% deuterium-substitution in the second exo-position in the compounds spectra of NMR. The signals of deuterium-substitution compound different from unsubstituted are marked by asterisk ⁄ . NMR 1 H(500 MHz, CD 3
