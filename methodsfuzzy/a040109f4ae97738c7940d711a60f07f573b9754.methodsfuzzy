Viruses A/chicken/Yokohama/aq-55/2001 (Y55) (H9N2) isolated from chicken meat imported from China upon quarantine was kindly provided by Dr. M. Eto, Animal Quarantine Service (Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan) [36] . A/duck/ Hokkaido/Vac-1/2004 (Vac1) (H5N1) was generated by the standard genetic reassortment procedure from nonpathogenic viruses, A/duck/Mongolia/54/2001 (H5N2) and A/duck/Mongolia/47/2001 (H7N1) [37] [38] [39] . Viruses were propagated in ten-day-old embryonated chicken eggs for 48 hours at 35Â°C. The complete nucleotide sequences of Y55 (H9N2) and Vac1 (H5N1) have been registered in GenBank/ EMBL/DDBJ (Accession numbers: AB256671-AB256678 [36] and AB259709-AB259716 [37] , respectively).
