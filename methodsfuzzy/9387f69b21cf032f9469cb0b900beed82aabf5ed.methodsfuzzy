To compare the clinical sensitivity of the NucliSens † Basic Kit assay to RT-PCR for the detection of NV RNA in stool specimens, 15 stool specimens from infected and uninfected volunteers in an NV challenge study collected at pre-challenge and various times postchallenge were tested by RT-PCR and NASBA (Table  3) . NV infection in these volunteers was also confirmed by ELISA for IgG seroconversion as described previously (Moe et al., 1998) . All five specimens that were positive by RT-PCR were confirmed by a positive ECL signal, yielding a test sensitivity of 100% when using RT-PCR as the 'gold standard'. The log 10 of these positive ECL values ranged from 4.82 to 5.56 with a geometric mean of 5.14. Five specimens that were negative by RT-PCR were also confirmed as negative by the NucliSens † Basic Kit assay. However, there were two volunteer samples (VT 23-1, VT 5-1) that were negative by RT-PCR but gave inconsistently positive results using the NucliSens † Basic Kit. These specimens tested negative in one assay but positive in another and can be considered true false positives because they were obtained from subjects prior to NV challenge. There also were three RT-PCR negative samples that gave consistently positive results by NASBA-ECL. The log 10 ECL signals for these samples ranged from 3.48 to 4.3, with a geometric mean of 3.97 that was more than one log 10 lower than the geometric mean of the RT-PCR positive/NucliSens † Basic Kit positive samples (5.14). Sequence analysis of the NASBA amplicons obtained from these three samples confirmed the pre- sence of the target NV RNA. Two of these three specimens (VT 23-8 and VT44-7) were collected from NV-infected volunteers at later post-challenge times (22 Á/23 days post-challenge) than the other RT-PCR positive specimens from these volunteers (2 Á/16 days post-challenge). We have detected NV-positive specimens at Day 22 post-challenge by RT-PCR in only two other infected volunteers (data not shown) indicating that viral shedding is possible during this time period. However, those specimens were not tested by the NucliSens † Basic Kit. The NASBA results for VT 23-8 and VT 44-7 suggest that the NucliSens † Basic Kit may be more sensitive than the RT-PCR assay. However, this statement is made cautiously because a third RT-PCR negative specimen (VT 3-5 from Day 4 postchallenge) that was positive by the NucliSens † Basic Kit assay was from a volunteer who had no indication of viral shedding by RT-PCR and who did not seroconvert. Overall specificity (using the RT-PCR gold standard) was 50% and concordance between the RT-PCR and NASBA results was 67%. 3.4. Comparative specificity of the NucliSens † Basic Kit NASBA method to RT-PCR for outbreak stool specimens To examine the ability of the Basic Kit assay to detect other NLVs using the oligonucleotide primer/probe set based on the NV genome, six RT-PCR positive stool specimens (CDC 350 (GI), DF-1 (GI), FS-1 (GI), LV-1 (GII), MC-1 (GII), and Toronto (GII)) from NLV outbreaks were tested using the NucliSens † Basic Kit assay described above. Only one of the three Genogroup I outbreak strains (CDC 350 with 78% nucleotide homology to NV) was positive by the NASBA/ECL assay, although the degree of positivity was low and not consistent from run to run. The other two strains with 69% homology to NV were negative (DF-1, FS-1). Of the Genogroup II outbreak strains (LV-1, MC-1 and Toronto, with 60Á/63% homology to NV), the Toronto strain tested positive using the NucliSens † Basic Kit assay and NV-based primers and detection probes developed in this study. However, as seen for GI strain CDC 350, the degree of positivity was low and not consistent from run to run. The other two GII strains were consistently negative (data not shown).
