The study analysed coverage of the SARS story in five UK daily newspapers between its appearance in the press in March 2003 and the end of the epidemic in July 2003. Tabloid newspapers were represented by The Daily Mail, The Sun, and The Mirror, broadsheets by The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian, giving a cross section of political allegiances, editorial approach and readership profile. The study covered all the 1153 stories which referred to SARS in any way, extracted from the Lexis-Nexis database. Even brief mentions of SARS in business, sports and comic journalism were extracted and analysed. The study specifically sought to avoid focusing on 'major' articles and feature or editorial comments, where much of the heaviest use of metaphorical language tends to be located, to prevent cherrypicking lurid examples. The first stories appeared in The Mirror, The Guardian and The Daily Mail on 17 March, five days after the WHO issued its first alert. The last stories analysed appeared on 8 July, three days after Taiwan left the WHO's list of infected countries. Table 1 shows the pattern of coverage. This comprehensive approach was chosen to provide a better coverage of the readers' total exposure to the information and frames which structured representations of SARS in the media. The large corpus of material that resulted, inevitably presented a research challenge. Different quantitative approaches drawn from corpus linguistics and earlier metaphor studies (eg: Hughey, Norton, & Sullivan-Norton, 1989 ; see also Deignan, 1999 and Charteris-Black, 2004) were experimented with, but found to be inadequate for dealing with metaphor chains (see below) and the overlapping imagery common in the coverage. Instead, the qualitative method standard in linguistic metaphor studies was used, with adaptations to deal with the size of the corpus. This was based on two complete readings of the total corpus by separate researchers. On the first reading, qualitative research software was used to mark-up metaphors and repetitive tropes and outline a map of linguistic patterns and frequency. The second read through took the form of a structured reading of articles, with pieces from all newspapers read in sequence in seven-day blocs to establish chronological patterns and linguistic developments through the development of the corpus. A great benefit of this inclusive approach was that it allowed us to look at extended stretches of media discourse and not only at isolated sentences, a method that still prevails in cognitive linguistics (see Stockwell, 1999) . As a result, we have highlighted the main clusters or chains of metaphors. For example, in the killer metaphors discussed below, a metaphor system is developed that exploits various well-known features of 'killers' (they stalk, they strike, they are mysterious, they are criminals) and are through them linked to other metaphors, such as SARS IS A CRIMINAL (it has to be detected, traced, hunted down, etc.) and SARS IS A MYSTERIOUS ENTITY. In this way a whole web of metaphors is cast over a certain domain of discourse and gives it coherence and illocutionary force (see Koller, 2003) .
