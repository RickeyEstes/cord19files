Twenty acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS patients were mechanically ventilated and connected to an integrated monitoring system (PICCO system; Agilent) by a fiberoptic arterial catheter (pv 2014L16) and a central venous catheter. All patients were randomised to receive mechanical ventilation with an incremental tidal volume (TV) (6, 8, 10 and 12 ml/kg at ZEEP) (group A) or TV = 6 ml/kg and incremental PEEP (5, 10 and 15 cmH 2 O) (group B). At every change of respiratory parameters the main haemodynamic and volumetric data were evaluated. Cardiac output (CO) was evaluated continuously online. All data are expressed as the mean ± SD. The ANOVA test was used to compare changes at different TV and at incremental levels of PEEP. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/8/S1 Table 1 Group A P value CO (l/min/m 2 ) TV 6 vs TV 10-12 ml/kg < 0.01 MAP (mmHg) TV 6 vs TV 10-12 ml/kg < 0.001  Complete hemodynamic profiles with the VoLEF and PiCCO catheter (Pulsion, Germany) were obtained in five mechanically ventilated medical ICU patients: age 62.6 ± 11.2 years, SAPS-II 41 ± 15.4, APACHE II 18.8 ± 5.4, and SOFA 4.8 ± 2.1. In total 125 paired measurements of CVP, PAOP, RVEDVi, RVEF, GEDVi, GEF and CI were performed. Figure 1 shows the correlation of ∆RVEDVi corrected for RVEF (∆RVEDVi-C) with ∆CI (R 2 = 0.69, P < 0.0001). Figure 2 shows a similar correlation between ∆GEDVi corrected for GEF (∆GEDVi-C) with ∆CI (R 2 = 0.62, P < 0.0001). Adjustment of volumes was achieved by exponential correction for the EF deviation from normal (Fig. 3) . The RVEDVi-C and GEDVi-C volumetric targets corrected for EF are presented in Table 1 . We did not found any correlation between (∆) filling pressures or (∆) static volumes and (∆) CI. Two groups of eight healthy subjects were randomly tilted into a 15°-feet-down (FD) or a 15°-head-down (HD) position. Ten volunteers were crossover subjected to an infusion of 15 ml/kg NaCl 0.9% (over 60 min) or control during an observation period of 10 hours. Blood was sampled at timed intervals. NTproANP and NTproBNP were determined by radiochemiluminescence and electrochemoluminiscence immunoassays, respectively. Results NTproANP levels (in % of baseline levels) were higher (P < 0.05) during HD (124 ± 13%) than during FD (82 ± 6%), while NTproBNP levels were not affected by tilting. Following sodium loading (Fig. 1) , plasma NTproANP levels increased immediately and returned back to baseline after 8 hours. In contrast, NTproBNP levels increased 3 hours after infusion and had doubled at the end of the observation period. Conclusions Besides relevant physiological implications -a sequential increase of NTproANP and NTproBNP after sodium loading has not been shown previously in humans -our data show that NTproBNP levels are influenced by sodium infusion. This may be relevant for the interpretation of NTproBNP levels in critically ill patients. We studied 16 critically ill patients (five female, 11 male) who underwent monitoring of ICG-PDR for clinical indication (LiMon, Pulsion Medical Systems, Germany). For each comparative measurement, in a random fashion, either 0.5 mg/kg or 0.25 mg/kg ICG were injected and followed by the corresponding dosage 60 min later. We analyzed 31 pairs of ICG-PDR measurements by applying the recommended dosage (0.5 mg/kg, ICG-PDR 0.5) and a reduced dosage (0.25 mg/kg, ICG-PDR 0.25). Respirator settings and dosages of vasoactive drugs remained unchanged during the study. No drugs that may influence hepatic blood flow were administered during the study period. There were no changes in fluid status and the central venous pressure was unchanged at the two time points. Results and discussions ICG-PDR0.25 was between 2.7 and 25.0%/min and ICG-PDR0.5 between 4.5 and 24.5%/min, respectively. Linear regression analysis revealed ICG-PDR 0.25 = 1.13 and ICG-PDR 0.5 = 0.66%/min (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001) with a mean bias of 1.0%/min (standard deviation 2.5%/min). The 15-min residual rates were also highly correlated (r = 0.92, P < 0.0001) with a mean bias of 0.3%. Conclusion A reduced dosage of ICG (0.25 mg/kg) is sufficiently accurate for transcutaneous measurement of ICG-PDR in critically ill patients. Introduction Indocyaninegreen (ICG) clearance can be measured with the LiMON ® device (Pulsion, Germany) and is expressed by the plasma disappearance rate (PDR) for ICG (normal value 18-25%) and the residual ICG after 15 min (R15, normal value 0-10%). In this study we investigated the correlation between PDR/R15 and IAP, SOFA score, and classic liver function tests in mixed ICU patients. Methods A total of 130 paired measurements were performed in 28 patients. The IAP was obtained using a balloon-tipped stomach catheter connected to an IAP monitor (Spiegelberg, Germany). The male/female ratio was 3/2, age was 58.2 ± 12.1 years, APACHE II score was 25.8 ± 15.7, SAPS II score was 44.4 ± 13.9, MODS was 6.4 ± 3, and SOFA score was 6.9 ± 3.6. The number of measurements in each patient was 4.6 ± 3.6. Calculation of correlation was performed with the Prism GraphPad™ software (version 2.00, 31 October 1995), and values are presented as mean ± SD. We selected all consecutive patients who met the criteria for septic shock in our ICU and we collected blood samples for analysis on days 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 or until death. We analyzed creatin phosphate kinase total (CPK) and MB (CK-MB), and also analyzed troponin. We analyzed hemodynamic parameters by pulmonary catheter, cardiac ultrasonography and Holter recording for 24 hours on the time points days 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Statistical analysis All results are presented as the mean and standard deviation. For analysis we divided patients into survivors and nonsurvivors up to hospital release. We performed an ANOVA for repeated measurements in continuous variables, and correlation coefficients were determined according to multiple-level regession analysis. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Ten critical care patients with cardiogenic shock were studied. All patients were mechanically ventilated and connected to an integrated monitoring system (PICCO system/Agilent) by a fiberoptic arterial catheter (pv 2014L16) and by a Swan-Ganz catheter. At basal time (T0) and at 1 hour (T1), 6 hours (T2), 12 hours (T3), 24 hours (T4) during LS infusion and at 12 hours post LS suspension (T5), the main haemodynamic and volumetric data were studied. All data are expressed as mean ± SD. The ANOVA test for RM was used to compare changes during times study. Table 1 presents the main hemodynamic changes of cardiac output (CO), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), intrathoracic blood volume (ITBVI) and extravascular lung water (EVLWI). Background Levosimendan is a new calcium sensitizer with inodilatory properties. The aim of this case series report was to evaluate the effects of perioperative and postoperative use of levosimendan in cardio-surgical patients with high perioperative risk, compromised left ventricular (LV) function or with difficulties in weaning from the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). We investigated the epidemiology of DVT in critically ill ICU patients expected to be hospitalized for at least 2 weeks. We used a triplex examination of lower extremities on admission, on days 7 and 14, and on clinical suspicion of DVT. Because of its invasive nature and technical complexity, pulmonary angiography (PA), the golden diagnostic standard, was not a routine procedure. University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS, using 30 TBI patients, 22 male and eight female, ranging in age from 18 to 79 years. TEG panels were drawn using either venous or arterial blood at 24 and 96 hours post TBI admission. Thirty replicated measurements were made with a two-channel TEG machine. A total of 13 subjects were considered to be hypercoagulable, eight were emerging hypercoagulable and nine were normal. The fibrinogen level as well as the factor 8 level were measured at the same time. We prospectively investigated the incidence of HPF4-Abs in ICU patients, which were treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as prophylaxis or treatment of venous thromboembolism or intermittent flushing solution of UFH (5 IU/ml) for maintenance of central venous or arterial catheter patency (FUFH). The HPF4-Abs were performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Asserachrom HPIA; Stago) on days 1 (admission), 7 and 15 of the treatment. The result was defined as negative if absorbance at 492 nm (A492) was < 0.671 and as positive if A492 ≥ 0.671. HIT-II was defined by clinical evaluation. In the period from January 2002 to December 2003, 16 ICU patients received recombinant factor VIIa (10 men and six women, with the average age of 62.62 years). Of these 16 patients, 10 were admitted in ICU post operation and the reason for rFVIIa administration was severe bleeding, despite surgical intervention and massive blood component transfusions. rFVIIa was administered in six patients who had haematological malignancies, in five of them to reduce coagulation disorders and in one patient with coagulopathy, before undergoing an invasive therapeutic procedure in order to prevent bleeding. These patients were infused with 15-90 µg/kg body weight rFVIIa. To evaluate the treatment, the prothrombin time, the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and the fibrinogen level were measured, as well as number of blood components transfused before and after rFVIIa administration. The success of rFVIIa treatment was confirmed by clinical stabilization and outcome. Results See Table 1 for the mean values before and after rFVIIa infusion. There were no adverse effects observed. Bleeding was controlled in 14 patients (87.5%). From these 14 patients five died (35.71%) and the reason was multiple organ dysfunction. Two patients, despite the high doses of rFVIIa, died because of continuing bleeding (12.5%). In a prehospital setting, values of the MEES and capnometry (initial and final) were collected from each patient. We added the final values of partial pressure of end-tidal CO 2 (petCO 2 ) to the MEES scoring system and ranked them from 0 to 2 so that the final maximum sum of this scoring system would be 30 without any change in the minimum score being 10. This study was undertaken over 3 years (January 2000-March 2003) and included 58 consecutive patients hospitalized for major trauma (defined as Injury Severity Score > 15) requiring intubation at the roadside and in whom the prehospital petCO 2 had been recorded. Patients younger than 16 years old were excluded from the study. There were 48 males and 10 females. Methods Sixteen patients with SCH-B in middle and end stages underwent MARS therapy as the MARS treatment group. A retrospective review of 16 patients chosen from previous therapy data, also of SCH-B and clinically matched to the MARS group, were regarded as the standard medical therapy (SMT) group, who had been treated with general methods except MARS. The prognosis of the two groups were studied and the treatment effects on levels of serum total bilirubin, nonconjugated bilirubin and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were observed in the MARS group during a single 6-8 hour MARS treatment. We prospectively collected data for all patients admitted to an ICU from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, a tertiary hospital with > 120 ICU beds serving medical, surgical, trauma, neurologic, and transplant patients. We tested two hypotheses: (1) increasing RIFLE class corresponds to decreasing ICU occurrence and increasing hospital mortality; and (2) patients classified by C or U criteria have similar occurrence and mortality. We classified patients according to their worst class on C or U criteria. For baseline C, we selected the lower of the admission C and the predicted C (based on age, sex, and race, using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula). Results A total of 5754 admissions and 5313 patients were evaluated. Occurrence and mortality are presented in Table 1 . Conclusions RIFLE criteria appear clinically sensible with increasing mortality. Unfortunately, C and U criteria alone yield different results, and occurrence decreases only when C criteria are used alone. Methods This is a post-hoc analysis of a randomized, prospective trial of patients presenting to an urban Emergency Department (ED) with severe sepsis and septic shock. Patients were enrolled in the study if they had two or more systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria plus hypotension or lactic acidosis (> 4 mmol/l). Patients were randomized to either conventional care or EGDT that included resuscitation to goals of central venous pressure (CVP) between 8 and 10, mean arterial pressure (MAP) between 65 and 90, and central venous oximetry (ScvO 2 ) greater than 70%. We perform the SC for patients with PDU, without stenosis, and without prominent ulcer ridge. We start medication of H2-RA (or PPI) just after operation, and oral feeding 4-5 days after operation independent of postoperative GF. Eleven patients with PDU who were treated with the SC underwent postoperative GF at the 4th-16th postoperative day and the healing process was examined. We do not perform radiographic examination of leakage from anastomosis. All 11 patients were informed that we could be convinced of the healing process with some unknown risk. In a 1-year prospective clinical study we examined 22 patients with severe pancreatitis acuta. Eleven of them (group I) were treated early with somatostatin (0.1 mg every 8 hours for 7 days). The second group was treated with standard therapy. The pulmonary failure was assessed on the basis of radiographic findings, computerised tomography scans, bacteriological diagnosis of endotracheal aspirates and acid-base abnormalities. Serum concentrations of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α were determined during the time course of the study, as were white blood cell counts, amylases, transaminases, urea and creatinin. After approval of the local ethics commitee, 39 intensive care patients have been studied. The age of the patients diverged from 37 to 98 years (median age 64 years). Hemodynamic variables, including continuous cardiac output, air-tonometric variables via a nasogastric tube (Tonocap Datex, Helsinki, Finland), arterial lactate, urine production, heart rate, central venous pressure (CVP) and mean arterial pressure, were measured every hour. Furthermore, renal values, such as urodilatine, ANF and urine excretion have been assessed after 6, 7 and 8 hours. The increase of the CO 2 gap values within the first 6 hours was determined by curve estimation and correlated (bivariate correlation) with indicators of renal function using Spearman's rho and Pearson correlation. The CVP increase within the first 6 hours was assessed similar to the CO 2 gap increase. Results and discussion Between air tonometry values and renal function, a significant contiguity (P < 0.05) was found. A bivariate correlation level of -0.356 (P = 0.039) between the CO 2 gap increase and urine urodilatine assessed after 7 hours resulted. Spearman's rho was -0.358 (P = 0.044) between the CO 2 gap increase and urodilatine extraction, and was 0.407 (P = 0.014) between the CO 2 gap increase and urine excretion after 7 hours. The strongest correlation was found between the CO 2 gap increase and the urodilatine-creatinine ratio (-0.503, P = 0.012). There was no correlation between CO 2 gap increase and serum creatinine. There also was no appreciable inter-relation between CVP increase and CO 2 gap increase (Pearson = 0.000, P = 0.999; Spearman's rho = 0.047, P = 0.778). Furthermore the time of ventilation correlates positively with the CO 2 gap increase (0.326, P = 0.043). Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/8/S1 Methods A small segment of jejunal mucosa was exposed by midline laparotomy and antimesenteric incision in 16 anesthetized, paralyzed, and normoventilated pigs. PO 2 muc (Clark-type surface oxygen electrodes), HbO 2 (tissue reflectance spectrophotometry), and PU (laser-Doppler velocimetry) were measured. Systemic haemodynamics, mesenteric-venous acid-base and blood gas variables, and systemic acid-base and blood gas variables were recorded. Measurements were performed after a stabilizing period and baseline measurements at 20-min intervals during increasing dosages of AVP (AVP group; n = 8; 0.007, 0.014, 0.029, 0.057, 0.114, and 0.229 U/kg/hour) or saline placebo (CTRL group; n = 8). Results AVP infusion lead to a significant decrease in cardiac index (121 ± 31 ml/kg/min vs 77 ± 27 ml/kg/min) and systemic oxygen delivery (13.7 ± 3.0 ml/kg/min vs 9.1 ± 3.4 ml/kg/min) concomitant with an increase in systemic oxygen extraction ratio (31 ± 4% vs 48 ± 10%). AVP decreased significantly microvascular blood flow (133 ± 47 PU vs 82 ± 35 PU), mesenteric venous oxygen tension (25.6 ± 7.1 mmHg vs 6.9 ± 2.4 mmHg) and microvascular hemoglobin oxygen saturation (51.3 ± 9.0% vs 26.4 ± 12.2%) without a statistical increase in mesenteric venous lactate concentration (2.3 ± 0.8 mmol/l vs 3.4 ± 0.7 mmol/l). Conclusion Intravenously administered AVP decreases in a dosedependent manner intestinal oxygen supply and mucosal tissue oxygen tension via reduction in microvascular blood flow in healthy pigs. Introduction Hyperdynamic circulation of septic shock is characterized in the hyperdynamic phase by increased cardiac output and decreased peripheral vascular resistance, and consequently low pressure. The use of norepinephrine as a pure vasoconstrictor aims to increase vascular resistance and blood pressure. There is a subgroup of patients with septic shock that does not respond to usual or high doses of norepinephrine. Usually in these patients different therapeutic approaches are used. In this study, we try to evaluate the role of very high doses of norepinephrine (≥ 2 µg/kg/min) in the treatment of septic shock. In our department the therapeutic approach to septic shock includes the use of aggressive haemodynamic monitoring (pulmonary artery catheterization) and the use of norepinephrine and/or dobutamine combination along with fluid resuscitation. In this retrospective study we present 12 patients with septic shock that required very high doses of norepinephrine (≥ 2 µg/kg/min). All patients were catheterized with a Swan-Ganz catheter and received adequate fluid resuscitation (pulmonary wedge pressure ≥ 15 mmHg). Norepinephrine was used and titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure > 70 mmHg. In nine of 12 patients dobutamine was added to achieve cariac index > 3.5 l/min/m 2 . Results Two patients never recovered from septic shock and died. Another six patients expired at a later time from multiple organ failure despite the fact that they improved from the shock and they were weaned off norepinephrine during their course. Finally, four patients survived to be discharged from the intensive care unit after a mean 25 days of intensive care unit stay. The APACHE II score did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors (Table 1) . We prospectively examined 50 concecutive patients who were admitted to the ICU with a variety of diagnoses. The patients were examined 7 days after admission to the ICU. Follow-up examinations were performed every 7-10 days. A total of 98 examinations were obtained in 50 patients. In each examination, the gallbladder was examined by US, CD and CE study with galactose-based microbubbles (SHU 508 A Levovist). Sonographic parameters were obtained (distention, wall thickening, containts, pericholecyctic fluid pericholecyctic edema) and vascularity (normal, abnormal flow signals) was estimated. The findings correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters and histology if cholecystectomy was performed. We prospectively studied 23 patients that suffered SIRS after their admission in a 23-bed general ICU. Patients were divided in two study groups according to the time of the onset of SIRS. Group A: eight patients (APACHE II score 19 ± 6, age 56 ± 18 years) who had SIRS within 7 days after admission; and group B:14 patients (APACHE II score 17 ± 8, age 51 ± 19 years) who had SIRS after the first week of stay in ICU. Clinical and laboratory measurements recorded for three consecutive days included temperature (T), white blood count (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and PCT. Infection was confirmed by positive blood, bronchoalveolar lavage, urine or other body fluid cultures. We selected all consecutive patients who met the criteria for septic shock in our ICU and we collected blood samples for analysis on days 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 or until death.We analyzed total cholesterol, cholesterol fractions (high density lipoprotein [HDL], low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein), triglycerides, glycemia and C-reactive protein (as a marker of inflamation). Thirteen severe patients, who had an APACHE II score above 20 at transportation to our emegency room, were elected and randomly assigned to either a treated group or a control group. The number of patients in the treated group was five and eight patients were in the untreated group. Maximum dose of UTI (30,000 U/ml) were administrated to patients in the treated group at the emergency room. After admission in the ICU, the neutrophil elastase level, IL-6 level, thrombomodulin (TM) level, protein C level and UTI level in plasma were examined daily until the 7th day after hospitalization. Values are expressed as mean ± SD. An unpaired Student's t test was used and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study included 50 adult patients in the ICU, who received mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours, did not receive antibiotherapy and in whom VAP was clinically suspected. Patients who have contraindications for bronchoscopy were excluded. The VAP was defined by clinical criteria as follows: presence of a new or progressive lung infiltration on chest X-ray, plus at least two of the following clinical criteria; fever 380°C or 360°C, white blood cell count > 10,000 mm 3 or < 5000 mm 3 , purulent ETA. Microbiologic sampling procedures were performed in patients using both distal tracheal suction and BAL. CPIS was calculated with a threshold value of 6, enabling identification of VAP patients. We performed a prospective study between 1 June 2003 and 1 December 2003, including all patients hospitalized for more than 48 hours. Infections presented during this period were recorded as well as the sensitivity of microorganisms to special antimicrobial agents. Patients who undergo insertion of a double-lumen CVC in the ICU were randomized to receive either a central venous catheter impregnated with chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine or the standard one. The catheters tips were cultured by the roll-plate method after removal. Involved patients were admitted for more than 48 hours in the ICU. We enrolled 28 patients subdivided into two groups: (group A) 18 patients with severe sepsis with bacterial bronchopneumonia and (group B) 10 patients with sepsis and confirmed candidemia with bronchopneumonia. We registered IL-10 levels in standardized blind nonbronchoscopical bronchoalveolar lavage (b-NB-BAL) and in serum at admission and than 1, 3 and 7 days after treatment. We measured cytokines by an ELISA assay. Results At present we have registered 28 patients aged from 51 to 91 years. Data (mean ± SD) are presented in Table 1 . We randomized 20 critically ill patients with ICU-acquired pneumonia to receive imipenem either 2 g/24 hours by continuous infusion (CON, n = 10) or bolus dosing (1 g every 8 hours) (BOL, n = 10). In both groups, a loading dose of 1 g imipenem was administered, which was followed by continuous infusion or further bolus treatment 4 hours after loading. Plasma imipenem concentrations were measured at baseline, 4, 10, 16, 22, 46 and 70 hours. Arterial blood samples were taken immediately prior to begin of the continuous regimen and before each respective bolus administration. Patients' age (62 ± 16 vs 59 ± 16 years), SAPS II score (43 ± 12 vs 44 ± 14) and renal function (creatinine clearance, 128 ± 35 vs 122 ± 33 ml/min) were comparable between both groups. Results and discussion After 4 and 10 hours, plasma imipenem concentrations were similar in both groups. However, mean imipenem plasma trough concentrations at the following time points (16, 22, 46, and 70 hours) were significantly higher in CON than BOL. For comparison, at 16, 22, 46 and 70 hours, all patients in CON had concentrations > 2 µg/ml (50% minimum inhibitory concentration for Pseudomonas aeruginosa), while this was only achieved in three of 10 patients in BOL. These data suggest that continuous infusion is advantageous and its benefit should therefore be investigated in clinical outcome studies. Conclusion Continuous imipenem infusion administered as 2 g over 24 hours guarantees more sufficient plasma concentrations when compared with a standard regimen (1 g every 8 hours) that is associated with insufficient trough concentrations. Introduction Delirium occurs in as many as 80% of mechanically ventilated (MV) medical intensive care unit (ICU) patients and is associated with poor outcomes. MV patients spend 43% of all ICU days in delirium, while all patients who become delirious spend about 25% of their ICU days in delirium. The 2002 SCCM sedation and analgesia guidelines call for routine delirium screening and treatment with haloperidol. We sought to understand whether these guidelines represented a change from current practice by examining haloperidol use in the ICUs of a large tertiary care academic medical center. The study was carried out on 11 patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA]I and ASAII) undergoing planned operations. All the patients were premedicated orally with midazolam. The catheter was introduced to the pulmonary artery before the anaesthetic induction according to the pressure curve. Patients received balanced anaesthesia that was the combination of epidural anaesthesia in the thoracic segment (thoracic epidural anaesthesia: fentanyl + 0.9% saline) and TIVA (propofol according to Roberts' schema). The heart rate, blood pressure, SpO 2 , temperature in the pulmonary artery, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac output, cardiac index (CI) and Qs/QT were marked at nine intervals: (I) before the induction of anaesthesia (10-30 min); (II) immediately after the induction of anaesthesia (after checking the tube position) -horizontal position; (III) after determining the respiratory mixture (during two-lung ventilation) -lateral position; (IV) 5 min after starting OLV -lateral position; (V) 30 min after starting OLV -lateral position; (VI) 5 min after starting two-lung ventilation or immediately after the pulmonary artery ligation of the operated lung; (VII) 30 min after starting two-lung ventilation or immediately after pulmonary artery ligation of the operated lung; (VIII) 5-10 min before extubation; and (IX) 15 min after extubation. In our study we analyzed 90 ASA I-II, nonpremedicated, children divided into three groups of 30 patients (A, B, C). We used for all of them the laryngeal mask [1] , inhalatory induction for all three groups and three different kinds of maintenance: inhalatory maintenance, intravenous maintenance and maintenance with balanced anesthesia. The 30 'A' children (age 5.9 ± 4.8 years) underwent inhalatory anesthesia with sevoflurane (1.2 MAC) in spontaneous breathing for induction and maintenance.The 30 'B' children (age 5.9 ± 3 years) underwent inhalatory anesthesia with sevoflurane (1.2 MAC) for induction and endovenous anesthesia with propofol for maintenance [2] . In the 30 'C' children (age 5.1 ± 4.6 years) we used inhalatory anesthesia with sevoflurane (1.2 MAC) for induction and balanced anesthesia for maintenance [2] . Thirty-four patients in whom blood glucose (BG) levels were controlled by means of the artificial pancreas (aim of BG control: 150 mg/dl) were investigated. The first measurement of GC was performed in acute conditions for all the patients, and the second measurement was done 1 week after the first measurement for 20 patients. GC was performed with a clamped BG level of 80 mg/dl and an insulin infusion rate (IIR) of 1.12 and 3.36 mU/kg/min. M1/M3 and I1/I3 indicate the M value (mg/kg/min) and blood insulin level (µU/ml) when the IIR is 1.12/3.36, respectively (normal value of M1: 5-10). M1/I1 and M3/I3 were calculated as the indicator of insulin sensitivity (IS). Patients were classified in four groups (A, B, C, D) according to M1 and the I/E ratio (mU/kcal): A, M1 < 5 and 30 < I/E ratio; B, M1 < 5 and I/E ratio < 30; C, 5 < M1 and I/E ratio < 30; D, 5 < M1 and 30 < I/E ratio. The following parameters were studied: (1) administered energy (glucose) (E), (2) administered insulin (I), (3) SOFA score, (4) M value, (5) daily mean BG level (BGm), (6) blood C-peptide reactivity (CPR), (7) IS, (5) insulin clearance (IC) (ml/kg/min). We measured random cortisol levels in 20 patients with severe trauma and haemorrhagic shock who were admitted to the ICU after initial resuscitation and emergency surgery. Injury severity scores (ISS), fluid and blood product requirements, inotrope requirements after fluid resuscitation, and mortality at 28 days were also measured. Relative cortisol deficiency was defined as a random cortisol level < 400 nmol/l. We measured erythrocyte (E) and plasma (P) glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) on the pretreatment period and the post-treatment period in 20 patients with acute exacerbation of COPD. Twenty healthy smokers and 20 nonsmokers having no history of lung disease served as control subjects. Results Data are presented in Tables 1 and 2 . It is a prospective case-control study in a medical adult intensive care unit with 13 beds. Routine venous blood samples were obtained from septic patients (n = 16, age 26-80 years) with APACHE II score > 10 without antioxidant treatment and from 16 age-matched, sex-matched hospitalised control patients without clinical and laboratory signs of sepsis. Paired convalescent samples taken 1 week after recovery were available in five patients. We measured the activity of superoxide dismutase with copper and zinc (EC 1.15.1.1, CuZn-SOD) in erytrocytes, based on superoxide generation by xanthine oxidase and tetrazolium reduction. The activity of paraoxonase (EC 3.1.8.1, PON1) in serum with paraoxon and phenylacetate, and the serum concentrations of total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and C-reactive protein were also measured. We considered P < 0.05 to be statistically significant. All patients admitted to a 10-bed university medical ICU between July 1995 and March 2003 with hyponatremia (< 120 mmol/l) were included. A cerebral computerised tomography (CT) scan was performed within 2 days, and a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was systematically planned at 1 month. ML diagnosis was ascertained when hyperintense lesions were present on the T2 sequence in any area considered normal on the initial imaging. Clinical and biological data were assessed every 6 hours until correction of natremia. Therapeutic options were left to the discretion of the intensivists. Objectives To test the hypotheses: (1) that chloride accounts for an increasing proportion of the base deficit with treatment in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and (2) that the perceived discrepancy between changes in the anion gap and bicarbonate/ base deficit during treatment is primarily due to the chloride effect. The patient will be intubated. A 5.5 mm ID nasoenteric feeding tube, a drawn scale on the surface, with an inner wire stylet is inserted and advanced through the esophagus into the gastric lumen. Then, a specially made 3.0-4.0 mm ID intratracheal tube with a cuff is connected to a Bodai connector, used for the fiberscope, whose proximal end is sealed except for a small hole to insufflate oxygen. After placing this composed tube into the esophagus transorally, a 3.0 mm OD fiberscope will be inserted into this composed tube and the distal end will be lead into stomach. The cuff is inflated in order to fix a position to prevent a leakage of air insufflated into the gastric lumen. After inflation of the gastric cavity by air, the distal orifice of the enteral feeding tube is advanced distally into the duodenum under direct view by the fiberscope. The distance from antrum can be determined by the scale on the tube. The method was tried for four patients and all trials succeeded without complications, and continuous postpyloric enteral feeding was safely begun immediately. Aim and methods The present study was designed to investigate the role of enteral nutrition on the postoperative sepsis-induced NO production, as an index of oxidative stress. Five groups of 10 male Wistar rats were subjected to midline laparotomy and feeding gastrostomy. Ten rats were allowed to recover from operation stress for 10 days and served as controls. The remaining 40 rats were allocated to receive through gastrostomy either enteral feeding (Fresubin-HP Energy, Fresenius-Kabi, 2 ml/hour, 75 kcal/day) or water for 24 hours, after which they were subdivided into two other groups by intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg Escherichia coli lipopolysacchardie (LPS) (Difco 0111:B4; Sigma Chemicals) or placebo. Two hours later all rats were sacrificed, having first been subjected to blood and liver tissue sampling. The NO production was quantified by measuring the total nitrite plus nitrate concentration in serum samples and in liver tissue homogenates, by means of a spectrophotometric method that uses a modification of the Griess reaction. NO synthase mRNA expression was examined in the homogenate of liver tissue in RNAzol by RT-PCR. We implemented MIH by use of icewater-soaked towels over the torso and legs in combination with sedation/muscle paralysis to avoid shivering after prehospital cardiac arrest in patients, age 15-80 years, with persistent coma and lack of cardiogenic shock. The target temperature (33 ± 1°C) was maintained for 12-24 hours. We evaluated the feasibility of our protocol. Fig. 1 . We evaluated 10 patients who received MIH after non-VF-(asystole, pulsless electric activity) out-ofhospital cardiac arrest (NVF-OHCA) and compared them with a historic control (n = 9) of NVF-OHCA who as not treated with MIH. The ICU and hospital length of stays as well as the incidence of bad outcome were compared. Bad outcome was defined as cerebral performance category (CPC) ≥ 3 or death [3] . Results Data are presented in Table 1 . Fifty-nine patients with severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale < 8) were included in our study. From these 59 patients, 49 were males and 10 females. Their mean age was 36.8 years, with a range from 12 to 71 years. In all patients, we performed and compared concomitant intracranial pressure (ICP) measurement with an intracranial catheter and a TCD examination. In each TCD examination we measured the maximum, mean and the end diastolic velocity (Vmax, Vmean and Vmin, respectively), and we calculated the pulsatility index (PI). The mean cerebral artery through the temporal acoustic window was used for the TCD examinations. A total of 120 TCD examinations and ICP measurements were recorded. We performed correlations between Vmax, Vmean, Vmin and PI with ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). The difference between measured and calculated osmotic pressure (osmolar gap) was recorded in 72 patients admitted to two medical-surgical intensive care units (ICU). The measurement took place immediately after their admission in the ICU independent of the cause of admission. The SAPS II and APACHE II scores were recorded as well as the ICU outcome. Patients were separated retrospectively into two groups on an outcome basis: A = Alive, B = Dead. Mixed, surgical and internal medicine intensive care unit (ICU) nurses and non-ICU nurses (n = 178) who have been working in a metropolitan university (UH) and in state hospitals (SH) for at least 1 year enrolled to the study (UH mixed ICU n = 21, UH surgical ICU n = 19, UH internal medicine ICU n = 17, SH mixed ICU n = 18, SH surgical ICU n = 23, SH internal medicine ICU n = 21, UH anaesthesia nurses n = 22, UH operating room nurses n = 37). Anaesthesia and operating room nurses, and non-ICU nurses, were considered as control groups as they do not take part in the follow-up of the patients. Beck depression (0-63), and the Maslach burnout inventory adapted for a Turkish population were used to assess depression and burnout respectively [1, 2] . The latter has three subscales: emotional exhaustion (0-36), depersonalisation (0-20) and personal accomplishment (0-32). One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post hoc test and the chi-square test were used and P < 0.05 was considered significant. Pearson correlation analysis was done to investigate the ingroup correlation of Beck depression and subscales of the Maslach burnout inventory. Values are expressed as the mean and SD.
