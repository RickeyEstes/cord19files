Stools samples. 60 faecal samples were obtained from 35 HIV-infected adults, whose age ranged from 18 to 47 years. 34 patients were infected with HIV-1, one with HIV-2, as proven by HIV-antibody detection assays (i.e. enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence test and immunoblot). The patients were at different clinical stages of disease: 5 (8%) stool specimens were taken from patients at stage Ib according to the classification scheme of Brodt et a!. (2),9 (15%) at stage 2a, 18 (30%) at stage 2b and 28 (47%) at stage 3. The patients belonged to various risk groups: 19 male hemophiliacs, 8 male homosexuals, 4 male and 2 female intravenous drug users, and one man whose exposition is unknown. The man infected with HIV-2 had spent many years in North-West-Africa. 14 of these patients (40%) were repeatedly examined over a period of 15 months at the longest. During this period of observation, the clinical situation of 4 patients deteriorated (one patient changed from stage 2a to 3, three patients from stage 2b to 3). As a control group, 860 children with acute gastroenteritis, examined once within 18 months, were used. Electron microscopy. Stool specimens were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (approximately 10% v/v) and the suspension centrifuged at 1,400 x g for 10 min to clear it of bacteria and debris. 28 of the faecal supernatants were further processed by the agardiffusion-filtration technique (5), preparing 2 formvar coated copper grids from each for electron microscopy. In 29 of the faecal specimens one aliquot of the supernatant was processed by the method mentioned above and a second by ultracentrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 20 min in the airfuge (Beckman Inc.) directly onto the copper grids. In three of the faecal samples two preparations were processed by ultracentrifugation only. Grids were treated with 2% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7) and examined with a Siemens Elmiskop 101, magnification 80,000 x. The virus was identified by its characteristic morphology: the particles were pleomorphic with diameters ranging from 80 to 230 nm, and displayed the typical radiating surface projections measuring 20 to 30 nm (Fig. 1) . The virus was seen regularly in separate particles, virus aggregations were exceptional.
