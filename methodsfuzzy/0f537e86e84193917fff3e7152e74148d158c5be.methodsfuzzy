The LC-MS/MS system included a Thermo Surveyor autosampler, a Thermo Surveyor MS pump and a Thermo LCQ Advantage Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). Data was acquired and analyzed with Xcalibur 1.4 (Thermo Scientific). Samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS in full scan positive ion mode. Briefly, 2 μL of sample was injected and the separation was achieved with a gradient mobile phase along with a microbore column Thermo Biobasic C8 (100 × 1 mm) (Thermo Scientific), with a particle size of 5 μm. The initial mobile phase condition consisted of acetonitrile and water (both fortified with 0.4 % (v/v) of formic acid) at a ratio of 5:95. From 0 to 1 min, the ratio was maintained at 5:95. From 1 to 21 min, a linear gradient was applied up to a ratio of 90:10 and maintained for 5 min. The mobile phase composition ratio was then reverted to the initial conditions and the column was allowed to re-equilibrate for 14 min for a total run time of 40 min. The flow rate was fixed at 75 μL/min. Mass spectrometer was coupled with the LC system using a pneumatically assisted electrospray ion source (ESI). Sheath nitrogen gas was set to 10 units and ESI electrode was set to 4000 V in positive mode. Capillary temperature was set at 300°C and capillary voltage to 34 V. Instrument was operating in full scan MS mode (m/z 200-1000) and MS/MS data was collected on the most abundant peaks in a data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode using a peak intensity threshold of 1 × 10 5 counts per second (cps). The ≤ 3 kDa ultrafiltrate of DMEM was used as a negative control and spectra were compared with the ≤ 3 kDa ultrafiltrate of the A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant or the TLC extracted molecules. This study was supported by discovery grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) to MJ (003428) and to CAG (312113) and by a team grant from the "Fonds de recherche du Québec -Nature et technologies" (FRQNT) to CAG and MJ. JAFB received a scholarship from the "Centre de recherche en infectiologie porcine et avicole" (CRIPA), a FRQNT strategic cluster.
