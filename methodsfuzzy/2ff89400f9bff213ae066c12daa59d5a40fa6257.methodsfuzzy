Study population, clinical assessment and data collection. Between January 1991 and January 2012, 230 consecutive patients with DM or PM and who fulfilled at least four of the five Bohan and Peter (2) criteria were followed at a tertiary hospital. Twenty-four subjects (10.4%) in this group had histories of HZ. Of the remaining patients without HZ, a control group of 48 patients (two controls for every HZ patient) was formed and matched by gender, disease type (DM or PM), age at the onset of myositis and disease duration. The study was approved by the local Research Ethics Committee. Demographics, drug therapy and clinical and laboratory data were retrospectively obtained through a systematic review of all patient medical records. Drug therapy and laboratory data were based on the time of the DM/PM diagnosis and the season in which the HZ event occurred, while the clinical manifestations considered were those presenting during the follow-up of these patients. Constitutional symptoms, skin changes (e.g., heliotrope, Gottron's papules, ulcers, photosensitive, calcinosis, and vasculitis), joint involvement (arthralgia and/or arthritis), and gastrointestinal (dysphagia) and respiratory (dyspnea on moderate exertion) manifestations were analyzed. Creatine kinase (normal range 24-173 IU/L) and aldolase (1.0-7.5 IU/L) were determined using an automated kinetic assay. Leukocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were also assessed. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels were evaluated using the Westergren and nephelometry methods, respectively. Autoantibodies against cellular components were determined with indirect immunofluorescence using Hep-2 cells as the substrate. Autoantibody anti-Jo-1 was determined using the Western blotting method. All of the patients were first started on corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day, administered orally), which were tapered gradually according to clinical and laboratory stability. In cases of high disease severity (dysphagia with risk of aspiration pneumonia, cutaneous vasculitis, or being refractory to oral corticosteroids), intravenous corticosteroids were administered (methyl prednisolone 1 g/day for three consecutive days). The following drugs were used alone or in combination for corticosteroid sparing: azathioprine (2-3 mg/kg/day), methotrexate (20-25 mg/week), cyclosporine (2-3 mg/kg/day), mycophenolate mofetil (2-3 g/day), leflunomide (20 mg/day), cyclophosphamide (0.5-1.0 g/m 2 of body surface), intravenous human immunoglobulin (1 g/ kg/day for two consecutive days) and chloroquine diphosphate (3-4 mg/kg/day).
