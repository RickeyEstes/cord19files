We sought to verify some clustering results with our own method. To do this, we apply our method to three sets of genomes: coronaviruses, human rhinoviruses, and bacteria. To cluster various genomes, we experimented with various combinations of types of moment, normalization factor, and clustering methods. Accurate results came from a combination of the use of regular moments and the use of central moments of all four nucleotides. The normalizing factor used was 1=ðN jÀ1 N jÀ1 m Þ with m being the nucleotide of that particular moment. The first three regular moments of each nucleotide were calculated with Eq. (4). Afterwards, the second and third central moments were calculated with Eq. (6). This gives each nucleotide five moments, resulting in a 20-dimensional point in Euclidean space. An Euclidean pairwise distance matrix is then calculated to use with clustering algorithms (Dawyndt et al., 2005) in the statistical program R. To evaluate complete linkage clustering algorithm and the average linkage clustering algorithm, the cophenetic correlation coefficients are calculated. The values are shown in Table 1 . As you can see, average linkage clustering has higher cophenetic coefficients than complete linkage clustering, but the difference is very small, so we construct the phylogenetic trees with both two algorithms.
