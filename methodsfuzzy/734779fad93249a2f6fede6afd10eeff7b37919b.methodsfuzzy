Data. Viral testing data came from the US National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) (17) . We extracted the weekly number of total tests for any To estimate the incidence of each betacoronavirus, we used an incidence proxy calculated by multiplying the weekly percentage of positive tests for each coronavirus by the weekly population-weighted proportion of physician visits due to influenza-like illness (ILI) (13) .

To translate the weekly incidence proxies to measures of daily incidence, we followed a previously described spline-based procedure (22) . For smoothing, the final weekly R is the geometric mean of the daily values in the preceding, current, and following weeks (moving 3-week average). We discarded the first three and last three weekly R estimates. To avoid unstable R estimates resulting from periods of low coronavirus activity, we The generation interval for the four commonly circulating coronaviruses has not been well-studied. In this analysis, we used the estimated serial interval distribution for SARS (Weibull with mean 8.4 days and standard deviation 3.8 days (32)) and varied this assumption in sensitivity analyses based on observations that the serial interval for currently circulating human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 may be considerably lower (33) . We assumed that the maximum generation interval was the first day at which over 99% of the density had been captured. To understand the relative contribution of depletion of susceptibles compared to seasonal forcing in the observed data, we adapted a linear regression model as follows (22): where Rsij is the weekly effective reproduction number for strain s in week i of season j, R0 is the basic reproduction number, S0 is the fraction of susceptibles at the start of the first season for the reference strain, and ϵsij is a normally distributed error term. A dummy variable for each strain-season combination (ɑsj) captures differences in the reproduction number and the starting fraction of susceptibles between strains and over time, but is unable to distinguish between the two. The next two terms estimate the impact of depletion of susceptibles due to infection by the same strain (dsij) and the other betacoronavirus strain (drij). Depletion of susceptibles for each strain was estimated up to a proportionality constant by the cumulative sum of the incidence proxy over season j through week i. The coefficient on the first term (γs) represents the scaling factor between the cumulative incidence proxy and true depletion of susceptibles, while δs captures the level of cross-immunity in addition to scaling; both coefficients were allowed to vary by strain. Because specific seasonal drivers (e.g. absolute humidity) of seasonal variation in coronavirus transmission have not been identified, we did not include them in our model but .

Bn represents the ten basis functions for a cubic spline with seven internal knots and no intercept, and βn the coefficients corresponding to each of these functions. Dynamic transmission model. We implemented a two-strain ordinary differential equation (ODE) susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) compartmental model to describe the transmission dynamics of HCoV-OC43 ('strain 1') and HCoV-HKU1 ('strain 2') in the United States. Exposed individuals became infectious at rate ν and infectious individuals recovered at rate γ. Immunity waned at rates σ1 and σ2 for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, respectively. The basic reproduction number, R0, was assumed to be seasonal with a period of 52 weeks, specified by the equation where a is the amplitude of the seasonal forcing term, b is the minimum value, and Φ is the phase shift in weeks. The transmission rate β(t) is related to the basic reproduction number by the formula (11) Cross immunity of HCoV-OC43 against HCoV-HKU1 was captured by χ1,2 such that the transmission rate of HCoV-HKU1 to an individual who is exposed to, infected with, or recovered from HCoV-OC43 was reduced by a factor of 1-χ1,2, and vice-versa. Individuals died at rate μ such that the average lifespan was 1/μ = 80 years. Fully-susceptible individuals were born at the same rate μ to keep the population size constant. A schematic of the model structure is depicted in Fig S3. The entire population was assumed to be susceptible at the start of the simulation period Table 1 . .

The model was implemented in R version 3.6.1 (35) and solved using the lsoda() function (36). We further validated the model by visually comparing its estimates of the effective reproduction number for each strain against the regression-based estimates described above. The model-based effective reproduction number was calculated as the product of the basic reproduction number and the proportion of susceptible individuals in the population at time t, accounting for crossimmunity (37). Next, we incorporated a third strain into the dynamic transmission model to represent SARS-CoV-2. Using the maximum likelihood parameter values, we simulated transmission of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 for 20 years and then simulated the establishment of sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission using another half-week pulse in the force of infection. We assumed that the incubation period and infectious period for SARS-CoV-2 were the same as the best-fit values for the other betacoronaviruses (5.0 and 4.9 days, respectively; see Table S7 ), in broad agreement with other estimates (23) (24) (25) . We allowed the cross immunities, duration of immunity, degree of seasonal variation in R0, and establishment time of SARS-CoV-2 to vary. In particular, we allowed the cross immunity from SARS-CoV-2 to the other betacoronaviruses to range from 0 to 1, the cross immunity from the other betacoronaviruses to SARS-CoV-2 to range from 0 to 0.5 (following the observation that SARS infection can induce long-lasting neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-OC43 but not vice-versa (15)),the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 to range from 40 weeks to permanent, the seasonal variation in R0 to vary between none and equivalent to the other human betacoronaviruses, and the establishment time to vary throughout 2020. To adjust the amount of seasonal variation in R0, we held the maximum wintertime value of the sinusoid fixed and adjusted the minimum summertime (baseline) value. This way, smaller degrees of seasonal forcing translated into smaller summertime declines in R0; for the no-seasonality scenario, R0 was therefore held fixed at its maximal wintertime value. This choice was informed by observations on the seasonal variation in R0 for influenza, for which the wintertime R0 was similar between geographic locations with distinct climates, while the summertime R0 varied substantially between locations (11) . For a representative set of parameter values within these ranges, we measured the annual incidence of infection due to SARS-CoV-2 and the annual SARS-CoV-2 outbreak peak size for the five years following the simulated time of establishment. We summarized the post-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 dynamics into the categories of annual outbreaks, biennial outbreaks, sporadic outbreaks, or virtual elimination. .
