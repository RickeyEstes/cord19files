Malaria has been a notifiable disease in Japan since April 1999 under the Infectious Disease Control Law, and reports of smear-and/or polymerase chain reaction-confirmed malaria cases are recorded at the Infectious Disease Surveillance Center, National Institute of Infectious Disease, Tokyo. 5 Nationality, place of birth, or details of residence are not documented on the reporting form; however, the main country of residence in the preceding several years is recorded. For the purposes of this study, Japanese travelers were defined as those who had been resident in Japan during the previous several years. Malaria cases, diagnosed between April 1999 and December 2005, were only included if a single country could be identified as the source of infection, and these served as the numerators. The denominators were the numbers of Japanese travelers visiting individual countries, and these data were obtained from the Japan National Tourist Organization (JNTO, Tokyo, Japan). 6 The JNTO compiles data on tourism from the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), and the national tourism offices of individual countries. Japanese nationals or those who had been resident in Japan prior to travel were defined as Japanese travelers by the recipient countries. Most recipient countries defined the number of Japanese visitors as that of arrivals at national borders, except for Mali and Chad, which used the number of arrivals at hotels. Countries were only included if denominator data were available for at least four years of the study period (April 1999eDecember 2005 . For countries where data were not available for the entire study period, the denominator was estimated, based on the numbers traveling in other years. A malaria incidence rate was calculated as the number of malaria cases per 100,000 travelers to the country.
