Sample acquisition. Fifty-four male M. lucifugus were collected from a WNS-free cave in Manitoba, Canada in November 2010. Details of the experimental design as well as protocols for collecting and transporting bats, infection with P. destructans, maintenance of bats in hibernation and sample collection have been described previously 37, 43 . Briefly, bats in groups of 18 were either sham-inoculated or inoculated with North American or European isolates of P. destructans. Bats were housed at 7 °C and >97% relative humidity with ad libitum water. All bats were equipped with data loggers to monitor skin temperatures. Bats were euthanized during the experiment when humanely required or at the termination of the experiment 120 days after inoculation. Immediately following euthanasia samples from segments of wing as well as various tissues were preserved in RNAlater (Qiagen, 76016) or in formalin. Samples in RNAlater were kept at −20 °C until they were processed. North American and European isolates of P. destructans caused similar disease outcomes 37 , so we did not differentiate between the strains in subsequent analysis. The procedures for care, handling and euthanasia of bats were approved by the University Committee on Animal Care and Supply of the University of Saskatchewan (Protocol #20100120). Bats were collected under the province of Manitoba Wildlife Scientific Permit WB11145. In 2017, a further 129 M. lucifugus were collected from a WNS-free cave in Manitoba, Canada in January under the Manitoba Sustainable Development Wildlife Scientific Permit No. SAR16009. Bats were euthanized during the experiment when humanely required or at the termination of the experiment 70 days after infection and a similar experiment was performed at the University of Winnipeg as described above (Protocol #AE08399). Histological classification. During necropsy, we collected representative samples for histopathology from all major organ systems. In addition, representative samples were taken from all areas of the wing and rolled on dental wax before placing in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Tissues were processed routinely for histology. Five µm sections were cut and stained with periodic acid-Schiff stain to highlight fungal hyphae. Liver and other tissues were processed routinely and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Wings were scored on a scale of 0 to 5 with 5 being very severe with >50% of wing covered in fungal hyphae. We used a bacterial score from 0 to 5, with 5 indicating wide-spread and abundant bacteria being present in many areas within the dermis and underlying connective tissues. Average scores from 5 sections of wing were used for analysis. Interstitial lung neutrophil assessment was similarly evaluated on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 being very severe. Average scores from the 5 sections were used for analysis.
