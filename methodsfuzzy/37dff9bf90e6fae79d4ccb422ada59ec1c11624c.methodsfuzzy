Pearson's Chi-square (c 2 ) test was used to determine the differences between groups. Gamma correlation analysis was used to investigate correlations between window opening mode and environmental dampness because the variables are dichotomous (Yes vs. No). Logistic regression analysis was applied to investigate crude associations between indoor environmental dampness, frequency of window opening and children's cold symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to adjust the potential confounders, which included age (4 vs. 5 vs. 6-years-old), gender (male vs. female), family history of atopy, residence location (urban area vs. suburb), ownership of residents (Tenancy vs. Owned) and current environmental tobacco exposure (Yes vs. No). Associations would be indicated by crude odds ratio (OR) and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The significance in statistical analyses would be indicated by p value < 0.05. The multiplicative interaction between household ventilation and dampness-related indicators on cold symptoms of children was addressed by multiple logistic regress model and Cox model, meanwhile the spreadsheet proposed by Knol MJ [43, 44] and Andersson [45] was adopted to analyze the additive interaction and 95% confidence interval between them. The relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI ¼ RR 11 -RR 10 -RR 01 þ 1), the attributable proportion due to interaction (AP ¼ RERI/RR 11 ), the synergy index (S¼ (RR 11 -1)/[(RR 01 -1)þ(RR 10 -1)]) were three indexes to estimate the interaction effect of household ventilation and dampnessrelated indicators. There are strong indications that the estimated effect on the additive scale of two investigated factors if the RERI is above 0, S above 1 and P-value < 0.05. To evaluate the effects of missing data of dampness related exposure options on questionnaires, the sensitivity analyses were conducted. All of the missing data were set as 1 and 0 respectively to inspect the difference of results. The abnormal error of tested relative humidity was eliminated firstly. The range between 25th-1.5IQR and 75th þ 1.5IQR (IQReinter quartile range) was used as non-outlier range [46] , and then the mean values accompanied with quartiles were calculated. SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Ltd., USA) was used for statistical analyses.
