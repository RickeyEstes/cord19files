The study examines continuities and changes in Hong Kong's political economy from the colony's birth in 1842 to the present, together with their consequences for the overall governance modes relevant to tourism development planning and for the specific governance modes for tourism development planning. The analysis of these evolving governance relationships draws on the previously identified typology of governance modes based on Pierre (1999) and DiGaetano and Klemanski (1999) , and also on the four analytical dimensions of modes of governance: (1) the key actors, (2) their policy agendas/objectives, (3) the rules of interaction, and (4) the roles and strategies of government (Bramwell, 2011; Jessop, 2008; Pierre & Peters, 2005; Wan, 2012 Wan, , 2013 . Consideration is also given more specifically to the evolving governance modes for tourism planning, as well as to how they were affected by Hong Kong's political economy and overall governance. Data were collected from multiple sources, allowing for data triangulation. The data were drawn from archival materials, newspapers, government documents on planning laws, procedures and policies, as well as government planning studies, reports and statistics. Academic articles on Hong Kong's urban and tourism practices were also studied.
