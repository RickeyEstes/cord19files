Cell culture. DBT-9 (delayed brain tumor, murine astrocytoma clone 9) cells were maintained 409 as described previously (91) The virus titer of each stock was determined by plaque assay using DBT-9 cells as described 425 previously (14, 91). For plaque assays of viruses containing the spike protein from MHV-ExoN(-426 ) P250, which does not form syncytia, plaques were visualized with neutral red (Sigma #N6264, 427 diluted 1:10 in PBS containing calcium and magnesium). Neutral red was added 24 hours after 428 plating and incubated for an additional 3-8 hours before formaldehyde fixation. Plaque 429 purification was performed by infecting DBT cells with serial dilutions of virus and overlaying 430 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Single plaques were isolated, resuspended in PBS containing calcium and 431 magnesium, and inoculated onto fresh DBTs. This process was completed 3 times before 432 experimental stocks were generated, as above. and RNA copy number was calculated by reference to an RNA standard derived from the MHV 475 A fragment.

Stock solutions of 5-FU and RBV were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). 482 2'-C-methyladenosine (CMeA) was received from Gilead Sciences, Inc (Foster City, CA). 483 Sensitivity assays were performed as described previously (16) viruses were detected with the same probe used in specific infectivity analyses (14). Reference 516 viruses were detected by a probe targeting the same region but with 10 silent mutations (5'-517 TCCGAACTACTGCAACCCCAAGTG-3') and labeled with 5' Quasar 670 and 3' black hole 518 quencher 2 (BHQ-2) (Biosearch Technologies, Petaluma, CA). RNA copy number was 519 calculated by reference to an RNA standard generated by in vitro transcription of the 520 corresponding MHV A fragment, and relative RNA abundance was calculated as the ratio of 521 competitor genomes to reference genomes. 522 All rights reserved.
