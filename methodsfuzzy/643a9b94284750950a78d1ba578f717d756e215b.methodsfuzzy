The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is an international agreement that operates as a licensing system for imports and exports of listed species that must be authorized by Parties (UNEP-WCMC, 2013) . The CITES Trade Database currently holds more than 13 million records, involving 34,000 scientifically recognised taxa as listed in the CITES appendices (UNEP-WCMC, 2013), which are managed by the by UNEP and WCMC (UNEP-WCMC, 2013) . CITES trade data have proved useful in previous studies to help characterize the levels of international legal trade and also to help assess trade issues (such as animal welfare (D'Cruze and Macdonald, 2016) ) and conservation (Bush et al., 2014; D'Cruze and Macdonald, 2017) , therefore, we used the data available from the CITES Trade Database website (https://trade.cites.org) to make queries for the period 2012e2016 inclusive. We specifically requested data only using the "live" trade term and the CITES purpose code "P" which refers to "personal" use and CITES purpose code "T" which refers to "commercial use" as outlined in Notification 2002/022 (UNEP-WCMC, 2013). All source codes outlined in Notification 2002/022 that are available to CITES Parties were used in the analysis including specimens sourced from captivity (codes C, D and F), confiscated specimens (code I), pre-convention specimens (code O), ranched specimens (code R), specimens of unknown source (code U), and specimens sourced from the wild (code W) (UNEP-WCMC, 2013). All Appendix classifications used by CITES were also included in the analysis: Appendix I (trade permitted only under exceptional circumstances), Appendix II (non-detriment finding and export permit are required for trade), Appendix III (one Party has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling trade), or non-CITES (CITES, 2017). We focussed our analyses on the following four taxonomic classes of vertebrate provided in the database: Mammalia (mammals), Amphibia (amphibians), Aves (birds) and Reptilia (reptiles). As specified in Resolution Conf. 12.3 (Rev. CoP16), the one-letter code reported as source of a transaction in CITES trade database indicates the original source of the species being traded. We used the following source codes to identify the individuals that were captive bred: C: Animals bred in captivity in accordance with Resolution Conf. 10.16 (Rev.), as well as parts and derivatives thereof, exported under the provisions of Article VII, paragraph 5, of the Convention. D Appendix-I animals bred in captivity for commercial purposes in operations included in the Secretariat's Register, in accordance with Resolution Conf. 12.10 (Rev. CoP15), and Appendix-I plants artificially propagated for commercial purposes, as well as parts and derivatives thereof, exported under the provisions of Article VII, paragraph 4, of the Convention. F Animals born in captivity (F1 or subsequent generations) that do not fulfill the definition of 'bred in captivity' in Resolution Conf. 10.16 (Rev.), as well as parts and derivatives thereof. Similarly, we used the following source codes to identify the individuals that were sourced from the wild. R Ranched specimens: specimens of animals reared in a controlled environment, taken as eggs or juveniles from the wild, where they would otherwise have had a very low probability of surviving to adulthood. W Specimens taken from the wild. In order to take a stock of the potential global health risks posed by the international legal trade in live wild vertebrates, we made queries in Web of Science database to find relevant articles published since 1945. To do that, we first made queries using the keywords "epidemics", "pandemics" and "outbreaks" and then within the resulting pool of articles, we identified those that specifically used the terms "exotic pet", "pet trade" or "wildlife trade". Thereafter, we also made two separate queries in Web of Science database using the keywords "exotic pets" ea common phrase used in the literature to refer to a particular type of live trade, and "wildlife trade" and then within the respective resulting pool of articles, we identified those that specifically used the terms "pandemic", "epidemic", "outbreak", "zoonotic", "zoonosis" and "zoonoses". The information on the diseases originating from wild species is limited. As information provided by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS)-Wild interface has proven useful in other studies focused on zoonotic diseases of wild animals (e.g. see Devitt, 2017) , we consulted the OIE WAHIS-Wild for further information on infectious diseases that are associated with wild animal species. The OIE is the intergovernmental organisation responsible for improving animal (i.e. domesticated livestock) health worldwide (OIE, 2018a). However, the WAHIS-Wild interface provides an inventory of non-OIE listed diseases that have been selected by the OIE's Working Group on wildlife for monitoring purposes given their importance to wild animals and for early warning purposes, in order to protect human and livestock health (OIE, 2017). We specifically requested data from the OIE WAHIS-Wild interface webpage (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/ wahidwild.php/Family/Family). We selected all families using the "Select all families" option for the period 2008e2017 inclusive, which gives the data for all countries. We then organised the output table in Microsoft Excel (Version 14.7.7). Given that the WAHIS-Wild interface does not provide taxonomic information above family level, we assigned class status to each species (i.e. Mammals (Mammalia); Amphibians (Amphibia); Birds (Aves) and Reptiles (Reptilia)) using the International Union for the Conservation of Nature as a source of reference (IUCN, 2018). We used RawGraphs (Mauri et al., 2017) for visualizing the CITES data. At the time of this study, WAHIS-Wild interface included a total of 50 infectious diseases and 4 noninfection diseases under the heading "Non OIE-listed diseases affecting wild animals" (OIE, 2018b). OIE explains the non OIElisted diseases as "Although these diseases have not met the OIE's criteria to be listed, the OIE's experts of the Working Group on wildlife diseases have selected them to be monitored, both because of their importance for wild animals and also for early warning purposes, in order to protect human and livestock health." (OIE, 2017).
