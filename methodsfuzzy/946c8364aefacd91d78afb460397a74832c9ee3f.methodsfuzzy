Amino acids sequence analysis of syncytin. Alignment of HIV-1 gp160 (NCB Accession No. Q70626) and syncytin (NCB Accession No. NP_055405) was performed using ClustalX 1.8. Heptad repeats in syncytin were predicted through the Coiled-coil program in http:// www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html [16] . Gene construction. The two heptad repeat regions (NHR and CHR) in syncytin were described as Figs. 1B and C. For the native single chain NHR + CHR construction (named 2-helix protein), we amplified the region from amino acids 349 to 445 in syncytin from one individual genomic DNA (PCR primers: 5 0 GCA GGA TCC AAA CTA TCT CAA GAA CTA AAT G 3 0 and 5 0 GAT CTC GAG TCA CAT CCA TTG GCT GAG GAG 3 0 ) and cloned it into the BamHI/ XhoI restriction sites of the GST fusion expression vector pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in which there is a rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage site for the fusion protein (same as the commercial PreScission protease cleavage site). The positive plasmids were verified by direct DNA sequencing. The native single chain NHR + CHR gene sequence was identical to previously published sequences [1, 2] . Protein expression and purification. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with the recombinant pGEX-6P-1 plasmid contained 2-helix protein gene was grown at 37°C in 2· YT to an optical density of 0.8-1.0 (OD 590 ). Then it was induced with 1 mM IPTG at 22°C for 6 h. Bacterial cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS (10 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 1% and the bacterial cells were lysed by sonication at 0°C. Lysate was subsequently clarified by centrifugation at 18,000g for 30 min at 4°C. The clarified supernatants were passed over glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (equalized by PBS). The GST fusion protein (named GST-2-helix protein)-bound column was washed by PBS over 10 column volumes and eluted with glutathione elution buffer (10 mM reduced glutathione, 50 mM Tris AE Cl, pH 8.0) for 1 column volume. The GST fusion protein was then cleaved by GST-fusion rhinovirus 3C protease (provided by Drs. K. Hudson and J. Heath) at 5°C for 16 h in the cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris AE Cl, pH 7.0; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM DTT; and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The free GST, non-cleaved GST-2-helix protein, and the GSTfusion rhinovirus 3C protease were removed by passing over the glutathione-Sepharose 4B column again. The 2-helix protein was further purified through Hiload 26/60 Superdex G75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) running on Ä KTAexplorer 100 chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified 2-helix protein was concentrated to a proper concentration which was determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). Then the protein was stored at À70°C for further analysis. Size exclusion-FPLC (SE-FPLC) analysis. The mixture of the purified 2-helix protein, BSA (Roche), and lysozyme (Sigma) was loaded into the Hiload 26/60 Superdex G75 column running on Ä KTAexplorer 100 chromatography system to assess oligomer formation. PBS was selected as mobile phase. The fractions of the peaks were collected, concentrated, and run on Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. Chemical cross-linking. The purified 2-helix protein was dialyzed against cross-linking buffer (50 mM Hepes, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.3) and concentrated to about 0.8 mg/mL by ultrafiltration (10 kDa cutoff). Proteins were cross-linked with ethylene glycol bis-(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS) (Sigma). The reactions were incubated for 1 h on ice at concentrations of 0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mM EGS, and stopped by 50 mM Tris AE Cl (pH 8.0). Cross-linked products were analyzed on Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. Circular dichroism spectroscopy. The secondary structure of the 2-helix protein was determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The purified protein was dissolved in PBS at the final concentration of 0.22 mg/mL, and the CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectrophotometer (Jasco, Easton, MD). Wavelength spectra were recorded at 25°C using a 0.1-cm path-length cuvette. Thermodynamic stability was measured at 222 nm by recording the CD signal in the temperature range of 25-90°C. The results were analyzed by the K2D program to evaluate a-helix content in the 2-helix protein [17] . This program can be found in http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/cdweb/ html/home.html [18] . Proteinase treatment. The purified GST-2-helix and 2-helix proteins were subjected to trypsin digestion in the proportions: 1/10 ([wt/wt], trypsin/protein) for 1 h at 37°C. All the products of digestion were examined on Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE immediately. Potential trypsin cleavage sites were predicted by PeptideCutter (http://us.expasy.org/ tools/). Molecular modelling and docking. The sequence alignment showed that NHR and CHR of syncytin shared about 44% and 62% sequence similarities, respectively, with the corresponding N-peptide (N36) and C-peptide (C34) of HIV-1 gp160 (Fig. 1A) . The X-ray crystal structure of the gp160 core structure (N36-C34 complex) (PDB 1AIK) was used to build a model. Homology model of each peptide was built by the automated software Modeller 6.2 [19] . The model with the lowest objective function of ten models was selected. The ZDOCK 2.3 program was employed to model the interaction between NHR and CHR of syncytin. The ZDOCK program can be found in http://zlab.bu.edu/ rong/dock/index.shtml [20] . The resultant model was evaluated further for its stereochemical properties by PROCHECK software [21] and represented by VMD v1.8.2 [22] .
