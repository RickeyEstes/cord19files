Consecutive ultrathin (~60-to 70-nm) sections were collected on Formvar-coated copper slot grids (TAAB Laboratories), stained, and imaged using a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Three series of 15 consecutive sections were obtained, and the one with the best contrast was processed for 3D reconstruction as described previously (22) . Images of reovirus inclusions were obtained using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Gatan) at a nominal magnification of ϫ40,000 and a resolution of 72 pixels per inch (ppi). Digital images with an 8.82-nm final pixel size were aligned with a free editor for serial section microscopy, Reconstruct (54) (http://synapseweb.clm.utexas.edu/software-0). Segmentation and 3D visualization were conducted using Amira. Movies from the 3D reconstructions were assembled using the Camera Rotate and Movie Maker applications of the Amira software. Immunogold labeling of Tokuyasu cryosections. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.4 M HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature (RT) for 2 h. Free aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mM NH 4 Cl. Cells were removed from the plastic with a rubber policeman and collected by centrifugation in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. The pellet was embedded in 12% gelatin (TAAB Laboratories) in PBS, and after solidification, cubes of 1 mm 3 were cut and infiltrated with 2.3 M sucrose in PBS Tenorio et al. ® at 4°C overnight. Cubes were mounted on metal pins and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Thin cryosections were prepared at Ϫ120°C using an FC6 cryoultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems), collected from the diamond knife with a 1:1 mixture of 2% methylcellulose in H 2 O and 2.1 M sucrose in PBS, and placed after thawing on 200-mesh grids with a carbon-coated Formvar film.

Semithick (~300-nm) Tokuyasu cryosections of reovirus-infected cells were collected on copper grids with parallel bars. Four single-axis tilt series were obtained automatically between Ϫ63°and ϩ60°with an angular interval of 1.5°. Images were recorded on an Eagle 4k-by-4k slow-scan charge-coupled device (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) using FEI software and a Tecnai G2 microscope (FEI) operating at 200 kV.

Tomograms were subjected to noise filtering and automated segmentation to visualize membranes (57) . METTEM. To visualize metallothionein-tagged NS protein molecules, mCherry-T1LM3 230MT-HeLa CCL2 cells were incubated in vivo with 0.5 mM HAuCl 4 (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM at 37°C for 15 min. This treatment allows gold nanoclusters to form on metallothionein-tagged proteins (58) .

At least three different resin blocks were sectioned for each experimental condition. Live-cell imaging. HeLa cells transfected with mCherry-ER-3 plasmid expressing mCherry fused with calreticulin, ER signal peptide, and KDEL (Addgene) were cultivated on glass-bottom culture p35 plates (Ibidi). At 24 h posttransfection, cells were adsorbed with reovirus strain T1L. From 4 to 10 h postadsorption, fluorescence and differential interference contrast (DIC) images were collected every 15 min using a Leica DMI6000B fluorescence microscope and LAS X software. To identify infected cells, immediately after video recording, samples were processed for immunofluorescence staining using a NS-specific antibody (2F5) and a secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 488. U-2 OS mCherry-KDEL cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding residues 1 to 230 of the NS protein N terminally fused to GFP. At 24 h posttransfection, cells were adsorbed with reovirus strain T1L. From 9 to 18 h postinfection, fluorescence images were collected every 30 min using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope and Zen software. CLEM. HeLa cells engineered to stably express mCherry-NS were cultured on photoetched grid p35 plates (Ibidi). Cells were adsorbed with reovirus T1L M1-P208S at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell, incubated for 14 h, and imaged using bright-field and fluorescence microscopy. Cells with interesting features were selected using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope and fixed with a mixture of 4% PFA and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS. After fixation and dehydration with ethanol, cells were embedded in EML-812. Resin-embedded cell monolayers were separated from grid plates by immersion in liquid nitrogen and warm water. Preselected cells were localized in the first ultrathin sections that were collected on Formvar-coated 50-GP copper slot grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Three independent CLEM experiments were conducted. A total of 17 areas were selected by confocal microscopy, and three were processed for embedding in epoxy resin and ultramicrotomy. Nine cells were processed by oriented serial sectioning and studied by TEM. Quantitative confocal microscopy. Quantifications were conducted using mock-infected cells (n ϭ 166), reovirus-infected cells (n ϭ 97), cells transfected with NS and NS (n ϭ 134), cells transfected with NS alone (n ϭ 147), and cells transfected with NS alone (n ϭ 135). ER remodeling was classified in four categories: (i) branched thin tubules, (ii) unbranched thin tubules, (iii) fragmented, and (iv) collapsed. The numbers of cells with normal ER and cells with zones of Ն15 m 2 with low density of labeled ER elements (termed "ER-free zones") were also quantified. Images were obtained using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope at a magnification of ϫ63 or ϫ100 using LAS X software.
