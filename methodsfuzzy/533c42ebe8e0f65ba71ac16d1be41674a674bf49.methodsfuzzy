Pre-coated Merck silica gel 60 F-254 plates were used for both thin-layer chromatography (TLC, 0.2 mm), and the preparative thin-layer chromatography (2 mm); the spots were detected under UV light (254 nm). Column chromatography was performed using silica gel (200-400 mesh, Merck). High Resolution Mass Spectra (Electrospray Ionisation, ESI) were performed on a Mariner Ò spectrometer in positive ionization mode. The IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer System 2000 spectrometer in KBr disc; resolution was 2 cm À1 ; absorption maxima (m max ) are given in cm À1 and quoted as 's' strong, 'm' medium, 'br' broad. In the case of highly overlapped IR bands deconvolution with Grams Research software was preformed. The methodology used for measuring the antiviral activity has been described previously. 22 A mixture of the crude 1, dry pyridine and dry dichloromethane, in the ratio of 10 mmol/30 mmol/18 mL, respectively, was cooled in an ice-water bath and the corresponding benzenesulfonyl chloride 2 (11 mmol) was added in one portion. The mixture was kept overnight at room temperature and then washed with water, diluted hydrochloric acid (5%), brine, and dried. The solvent was distilled off. The residue was purified by column chromatography or crystallization to afford 3; the solvents are given in parentheses below. Chloromethyl pivalate (15 mol) was added to a stirred mixture of N-(2-pivaloyloxyethyl)benznenesulfonamide 3 (5 mol) and anhydrous potassium carbonate (25 mmol) in dry DMF (10 mL) at room temperature. The mixture was stirred for 5 days at room temperature and then was poured into ice-cold water (50 mL). The organic phase was extracted with dichloromethane (3Â 50 mL). The extracts were combined and washed with water, and dried. The solvent was distilled off. The residue was purified by column chromatography or crystallization to give 4; the solvents are given in parentheses below. A mixture of 5a-c (0.3 mmol), sodium dithionite (260 mg, 1.5 mmol) and water (15 mL) was heated at 90°C for 1 h. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and extracted with ethyl acetate (5Â 10 mL). The extracts were combined, washed with brine (5 mL) and dried. The solvent was distilled off. The residue was purified by column chromatography (chloroform/methanol, 95:5, v/v) to yield 9a-c. was purified by column or preparative thin-layer chromatography to afford the corresponding products (see ; the eluting solvents are given in parentheses below. 5.9. General procedure for the ammonolysis of 5d or 6d A mixture of 5d or 6d, concentrated ammonium hydroxide, and methanol in the ratio of 0.5 mmol/10 mL/10 mL, respectively, was heated in a sealed tube at 70°C for 1 day. The volatiles were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography (chloroform/methanol, 95:5, v/v) to give 14a or 14b, respectively.
