Biological agents can be dispersed by air in the form of fine particles (aerosols), or used to contaminate food or water sources. When considering how biological agents are spread following intentional release, they may be separated into two groups: contagious agents and non-contagious agents. Contagious agents, especially those that are highly contagious such as smallpox virus and Yersinia pestis (plague), spread from person to person so rapidly that widespread dispersal may not be necessary. A small amount of agent dispersed and infecting only a few individuals will have the potential to start an epidemic affecting millions. Such a method is inherently unpredictable in its outcome, as the extent and spread of the outbreak will depend upon the movement of infected individuals. Outbreaks can therefore cross regional and national borders, resulting in significant difficulty in contact tracing. Non-contagious agents, such as the anthrax bacillus, require effective and widespread dispersal in order to affect a greater number of individuals, as the pathogen is not transmitted from person to person. Significant technological expertise is required to produce and disperse agents in this way as they will need to be aerosolised into particles of 1-5 mm (i.e. small enough to remain suspended in the air as an aerosol and to be inhaled deep into the lung). Techniques may include the use of explosive canisters containing agent or spraying devices attached to vehicles or aircraft. The outcomes of dispersal of noncontagious agents are more predictable in that only those in the vicinity of the release will be affected.
