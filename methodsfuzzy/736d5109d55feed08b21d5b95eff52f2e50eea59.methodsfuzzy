HEK293T, HeLa, A549, SupT1 and Vero cells, obtained from the Cellulonet repository of the SFR-Biosciences Gerland, were maintained in complete DMEM media supplemented with 10% FCS (SIGMA; RPMI 1640 media for SupT1). Huh-7.5.1c2 cells were similarly propagated and were obtained from the laboratory of Francis V. Chisari (the Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA [65] . Hone cells that contain a latent EBV-GFP genome were maintained in RPMI 1640 [50] . Vero/hSLAM cells expressing the human CD150 receptor (SLAM) were used for most Measles Virus infections/productions [66] and were obtained from Yusuke Yanagi (Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan). HeLaP4 cells stably expressing the HIV-1 CD4 receptor and CXCR4 co-receptor in addition to an integrated ß-galactosidase under the control of the HIV-1 Long Terminal Repeats promoter have been described before [67] . Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were obtained after Ficoll gradient purification. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. Prior to usage, PBLs were activated for twenty-four hours with 1 μg/ml of phytohemagglutinin (PHA, Sigma) and 150 U/mL of Interleukin 2 (IL2, obtained through the AIDS Reagents and Reference Program of the NIH). Monocytes were first enriched from white blood leukocytes through successive Ficoll and Percoll gradients and then purified by negative depletion (monocyte isolation kit II, catalogue n˚130-091-153, Miltenyi) to obtain a cell population of purity equal/superior to 95%. Monocytes were either differentiated in immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) after incubation for 4 days with GM-CSF and IL4 (each at 100 ng/mL each, catalogues nP CYT-221 and PCYT-211, Eurobio) or in macrophages upon incubation with 100 ng/mL of M-CSF (Eurobio catalogues n˚01-A0220-0050). When indicated, MDDCs were incubated for 24 hours with 1.000 U/mL of human IFNα (catalogue n˚11100-1, Tebu Bio).
