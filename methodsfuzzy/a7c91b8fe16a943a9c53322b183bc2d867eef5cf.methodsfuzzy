Five thousand three hundred and seventy-three animal sera (n = 33,181,430 and 625 sera coming from n = 92, 45, and 13 herds for cattle, sheep and goat respectively, Table S1) were collected in official veterinary laboratories and at the Veterinary School of Toulouse from five French regions. Most of these sera were initially collected for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis monitoring. The sampling plan was representative of the population taking into account the major cattle-rearing areas including Bretagne, Pays de la Loire, Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, Hauts-de-France and Occitanie. In addition, sera from Occitanie were retrieved from the Veterinary School of Toulouse large animal clinics (n = 509). No data was available on history of respiratory diseases in the farms of each region. All the tested animals were older than 1-year-of age and the detection of maternally derived antibodies can therefore be ruled out. The type of sera, localization and years of collection are described in Table S1 . Three controls sera were used: an in-house polyclonal rabbit anti-IDV serum generated by inoculating rabbits with D/Bovine/Nebraska/9-2/2012 subcutaneously (as described in [11] ); IDV negative and positive French cattle sera generated during an experimental infection [16] . All sera were treated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE, Seika) following the manufacturer's instructions and hemadsorbed on packed horse red blood cells. Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) assays were performed as previously described [16] , with four hemagglutination units of D/bovine/France/5920/2014 and 1% horse red blood cells. Samples with antibody titers ≥1:20 were considered positive. Statistical analyses were carried out using Graph Pad Prism 5.0. A p value ≤0.05 was considered significant. A χ2 test was used to compare IDV seroprevalences between species and between French provinces.
