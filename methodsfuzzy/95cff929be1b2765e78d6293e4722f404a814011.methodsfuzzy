The statistical workhorse of risk factor analysis is the generalized linear model (GLM) [17, 18] . The methodology is well established and its application routine, but it has its limitations for the analysis and prediction of infectious disease data. As discussed in ยง2, the risks of individuals becoming infected are dynamic and not independent of one another; this introduces spatial and temporal autocorrelations that may be difficult to account for [19] . This problem is exacerbated when the intention is to predict future risks, perhaps under different scenarios such as a range of possible intervention strategies. Extrapolations of statistical models have limited value in this context. Hence, as discussed below, dynamic models have often been preferred. Making epidemiological predictions requires knowledge of both the risk of infection but also, crucially, the risk of transmitting infection if infected. The scientific literature contains many thousands of studies of the former but far less attention has been paid to the latter (see [20] for an example). Sometimes susceptibility and transmission may be closely related, e.g. for vector-borne diseases, but for others they may be quite distinct, e.g. for faecal -oral transmitted infections. There are some obvious reasons for this lack of attention. First, it is often much harder to establish that an individual has transmitted infection than that it has acquired infection, whether this information is to be inferred from contact tracing studies (as carried [16] . (1) new pathogen species and novel variants (2) pathogens acquiring resistance (3) the 'Big Three': HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria (4) acute respiratory infections (5) sexually transmitted infections (6) zoonoses (7) transboundary animal diseases (8) epidemic plant diseases out during the 2001 UK FMD epidemic [21] ) or from the analysis of pathogen typing or sequence data (as carried out during the 2007 UK FMD outbreak [22] ). Second, the sample size available is not the total population but the infected population (each of whom may or may not have transmitted infection onwards), typically a much smaller number with a corresponding loss of statistical power to identify risk factors. The outputs of a risk factor analysis are routinely expressed in terms of odds ratios associated with each of the risk factors in the model, identifying the main drivers of risk in the study population. Often, however, it is also useful to calculate the risk (e.g. the probability of being infected) for each individual in the population, based on their individual risk factors (e.g. [19] ). A risk profile or risk map is thus generated which can be used for direct surveillance, prevention or control efforts. An example of this occurred in Scotland in September 2007, when there was a FMD outbreak in Surrey in England [23] . A risk map was generated based on livestock movement records and local risk factors, and this was used to direct surveillance efforts, allowing Scotland to provide evidence of freedom from disease much more quickly than would otherwise have been possible, and so accelerating the lifting of movement restrictions imposed in response to the risk of FMD (figure 2). (c) Risk modelling Here, risk modelling is defined as the formal, quantitative estimation of the probability of specified adverse effects from defined hazards [15] . A variety of approaches can be used in risk modelling, sometimes in combination for complex problems. Indeed, in practice, applications to specific problems often require a bespoke quantitative analysis. For example, estimation of the risk of rabies entering the UK through imported pets (expressed as the mode and distribution of the number of years between rabies entries) [1] or the risk of FMD entering the UK through illegally imported meat products (partitioned by geographical origin of the imports) [2] . In principle, similar kinds of approaches could be applied to other kinds of question too; for example, estimating the probability of the emergence of a novel pathogen (see ยง5), or the probability that introduction of a pathogen will lead to an epidemic. A significant challenge to risk modellers (whatever methodology is used) is accurate communication of the results, particularly to decision makers who may be unfamiliar with the technical details of the analyses [24, 25] . It is now widely accepted that formal measures of uncertainty (typically 95% confidence/ credible intervals or a full depiction of the range of outputs obtained) must be linked to the 'headline' result. Issues of verification and validation (discussed in more detail below) also need to be addressed.
