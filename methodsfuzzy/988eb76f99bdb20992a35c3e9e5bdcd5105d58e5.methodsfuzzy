Six commercial extraction methods for total nucleic acid or RNA were evaluated: the automated MagNA Pure Compact (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA), KingFisher Flex-96 (ThermoFisher, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), and NucliSENS ® easyMAG ® (BioMerieux, Durham, NC, USA) methods; the semi-automated NucliSENS ® miniMAG ® (BioMerieux, Durham, NC, USA); and the manual QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and RNaid ® kit (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with a modified protocol) ( Table 1 ). Each extraction method was chosen because it had been used previously in studies for the extraction of nucleic acid from stool. The MagNA Pure LC instrument has been used to purify nucleic acid from many types of clinical specimens including stool samples for rotavirus (Dalesio et al., 2004; Petrich et al., 2006; Schmid et al., 2004; Wolk et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2011) but is no longer in production so the MagNA Pure Compact instrument, which uses the same paramagnetic bead technology, was evaluated instead. The MagNA Pure Compact was used with the MagNA Pure Compact RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Applied Science Indianapolis, IN, USA). The easyMAG and miniMAG extraction platforms utilize the same silica extraction technology and use the same reagents. Both methods are universal and can be applied to a broad range of different specimens such as blood, sputum, serum, throat swabs and stool (Dundas et al., 2008a; Freeman et al., 2008; Loens et al., 2008; Perelle et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2005b) . Both methods have been used for extraction of rotavirus RNA from stool . The easyMAG and miniMAG are mainly used in laboratories that require moderate-and low-throughput, respectively . The KingFisher Flex (96 deep well magnet head) designed for high throughput laboratories, is an automated extractor also used for rotavirus RNA extraction (Freeman et al., 2008; Grant et al., 2011; Hull et al., 2011) . In this study it was used with the MagMax TM -96 Total RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit, which is based on silica membrane technology, has been used extensively for the extraction of rotavirus RNA from stool (Doan et al., 2011; Matthijnssens et al., 2006; Rahman et al., 2007a Rahman et al., , 2007b Zeller et al., 2010) . The RNaid kit extraction protocol, which uses glass powder to capture and purify rotavirus RNA, has been modified and used by the CDC Rotavirus Surveillance Laboratory routinely since the 1990's along with other methods to extract rotavirus RNA from stool (Gentsch et al., 1992; Jothikumar et al., 2009) . In brief, 200 L of clarified 10% stool suspension was mixed directly with 400 L 6 M guanidine thiocyanate (Ultrapure Grade; Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) and 10 L of RNAID glass powder. The mixture was then vortexed and mixed on a Nutator rocker (Clay Adams Division, Becton-Dickinson, Parsippany, NJ, USA) for 15 min at room temperature. Each sample was then centrifuged for 60 s at 650 × g and the supernatant was removed by aspiration with a Pasteur pipette. The samples were washed once with 700 L of guanidine thiocyanate wash solution (4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 850 × g for 60 s. The supernatant was aspirated and the samples were then washed two times with 400 L of the RNAID kit wash buffer and centrifuged at 850 × g for 60 s. The supernatant was aspirated, and the samples were washed once more with the same buffer and were then finally centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 120 s. After aspiration of the supernatant, the samples were dried at room temperature for 1 h, resuspended in 35 L of nuclease free water, and incubated for 10 min at 65 • C. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 120 s, and the supernatant was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes (Lube Tube; Marsh Co., Rochester NY, USA). The pellet was re-extracted with the same volume of water (35 L), and the combined supernatants were stored at −80 • C until they were used. Immediately before use for PCR, the supernatants were incubated at 56 • C for 5 min and were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 60 s to pellet the residual RNAID from the sample. With the exception of the RNaid kit as described, extractions were performed according to kit and instrument protocols. Single aliquots of each stool suspension and a negative control stool were extracted in triplicate by each method. When qRT-PCR results were compared for all six extraction methods, samples extracted by using the MagNA Pure Compact system yielded the lowest average C t values for 6 of 8 stools, including the 5 highest concentration samples as determined at EIA; the RNaid performed best with the other two samples which The best performing method for each sample labeled with . Methods with mean Ct values that were found to be significantly higher than the best performing method are labeled with *(P < 0.05), **(P < 0.01), or ***(P < 0.001). were among the 3 lowest concentration samples as determined by EIA (Fig. 1) . Statistical analysis of method-to-method variability detected significant differences among the mean C t values for all nucleic acid extracts obtained using the 6 methods (P < 0.001). When pairwise analyses of extraction method data were performed, the mean C t values for KingFisher Flex extracts were significantly higher than those of the best performing method (MagNA Pure Compact or RNaid kit) for 7 of 8 samples as was the case for the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit with 6 samples (Fig. 1) . In the case of 4 samples (5630, 5631, 5627, 5629) where the MagNA Pure Compact extracts yielded the lowest mean C t values, the values for the RNaid kit were significantly higher (Fig. 1) . In the two cases where the RNaid kit extracts yielded the lowest mean C t values (samples 5634 and 5628), the mean C t values for the MagNA Pure Compact extracts were not significantly different. With 2 samples (5634, 5635), the mean C t values for miniMAG extracts were significantly higher than the best performing method. The mean C t values for the easyMAG were never the lowest but never differed significantly from the best performing method. Inhibitors were detected in extracts prepared with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit; the 1:10 dilutions of each QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit extract exhibited lower C t values than the undiluted extract (Table 2) , with average C t values decreasing 1.3-2.5 cycles. The 1:10 dilutions of the extracts prepared using the other extraction methods showed increases in C t values by 2-4 cycles, consistent with a dilution effect of target RNA.
