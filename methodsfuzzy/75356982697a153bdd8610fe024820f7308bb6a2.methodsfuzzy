Ethics statement. This study was approved by the Institution Review Board of Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Medical Center, Taiwan (Document no. 102-5046B). Written informed consent from participants was obtained. This research adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Study period and participants. The study was conducted at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from January 1, 2017 to December 30, 2017. Volunteers were recruited from those suffering from ESRD, and from healthy controls. Age is controlled in the study. ESRD affected volunteers refer to individuals with chronic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis therapy thrice a week. A 10 ml sample of blood was obtained from each participant (ESRD and healthy individuals). To avoid the influence of dialyzer on the expression of immune mediators, blood samples from ESRD volunteers were collected before starting the dialysis session. The blood samples of all participants were tested for dengue virus-specific immunoglobulin IgM and IgG antibodies using a dengue blot detection kit (Gene Labs Diagnostics, Singapore), to determine any previous dengue infection 22 . Blood samples were anonymized after completion of demographic data collection. Preparation of mononuclear cells. The whole blood from all participants (ESRD and healthy individuals) was separated into plasma and blood cells (i.e., leukocytes and erythrocytes) by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm (150 × g) for 20 minutes. Erythrocytes were removed from blood cells by 4.5% dextran sedimentation. After removal of erythrocytes, leukocytes were further separated into mononuclear cells and neutrophils using a density gradient centrifugation (350 g/30 min in Ficoll-Paque PLUS, Amersham Biosciences Corp.) in accordance with the procedures described elsewhere 23 . After this, mononuclear cells from ESRD and healthy individuals were suspended in RPMI medium (Gibco) and seeded into a 24-well culture plate at a density of 1.0 × 10 6 cells per well for 1 day at 37 °C.
