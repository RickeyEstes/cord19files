Melting points were determined on an SMP3 apparatus (Barloworld Scientific, UK) in open capillaries and were uncorrected. IR spectra were recorded on Spectrum One FT-IR (Perkin-Elmer, UK) and UV-Vis spectra on Lambda 20 double-beam spectrophotometers (Perkin-Elmer, UK). NMR 1 H and 13 C spectra were recorded at 25 • C on an NMR Avance 600 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) at 300.13 or 600.13 and 75.47 or 150.9 MHz for 1 H and 13 C nuclei, respectively. Chemical shifts (δ) were reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane in the 1 H and the dimethyl sulfoxide residual peak as a reference in the 13 C NMR spectra (39.51 ppm). Coupling constants (J) were reported in hertz (Hz). Mass spectra were collected on an HPLC-MS/MS instrument (HPLC, Agilent Technologies 1200 Series; MS, Agilent Technologies 6410 Triple Quad) using electrospray ionization in positive mode. Elemental analyses were performed on a CHNS LECO analyzer (LECO Corporation, USA). All compounds were routinely checked by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with Merck silica gel 60F-254 glass plates using appropriate solvent systems. Spots were visualized by short-wave UV light and iodine vapour. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel 0.063-0.200 mm. All chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade and purchased from commercial sources. PQ diphosphate, 4-methoxy-4-oxobutanoic acid (mono-methyl succinate), (E)-4-ethoxy-4-oxobut-2-enoic acid (mono-ethyl fumarate), 3-fluoroaniline, 4-fluoroaniline, 3-chloroaniline, 4-chloroaniline, 3-trifluoromethylaniline, 4-trifluoromethylaniline, DIEA, and HATU were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PQ was prepared from PQ diphosphate prior to use. All reactions with PQ were run light protected.
