Recombinant MHV strain A59, HCoV-229E, MHV H277A , HCoV-229E H250A , and MHV D130A were generated using the vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system as previously described [9, [56] [57] [58] . Viruses were propagated on 17Cl1 mouse fibroblasts (MHV) and on Huh-7 hepacarcinoma cells (HCoV-229E) and their identity was confirmed by sequencing. To monitor viral spread in vivo, mice at the age of 8-10 weeks were injected intraperitoneally with 500 plaque-forming units (pfu) of MHV-A59 and MHV H277A , diluted in MEM2% (2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin (60 μg/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml)). Mice were euthanized two days post infection (d.p.i.) and liver and spleen were harvested, weighed and homogenized. Viral load (pfu/g organ) was determined by plaque assay.
