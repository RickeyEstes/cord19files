Virus. The origin and growth of MHV-3 have been previously described (2) . MHV-3, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Kockville, MD) (ATCC-VR262), was plaque purified on monolayers of DBT cells. Stock virus was grown to a titer of 2.8 x 107 PFU/ml in 17 CL1 cells. The virus was harvested by one cycle of freeze-thawing and clarified by centrifugation at 4,500 g for 1 h at 4~ Virus was then assayed on monolayers of L2 cells in a standard plaque assay as previously described (2) . To induce MHV-3 infection, each mouse received 103 PFU of MHV-3 by intraperitoneal injection. Mice. BALB/cJ mice 8-10 wk of age, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, (St. Constant, Quebec). Animals were housed in the D class facility at the University of Toronto fed a diet of standard chow and water ad libitum. Mice were killed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 after infection. Blood was obtained by axillary bleeding. Splenic mononuclear cells were harvested and assayed for PCA both by immunofluorescence staining and in a onestage clotting assay. Livers were harvested for viral titers, histopathology, and PCA by immunofluorescence staining as described below. All mice used were screened by an ELISA for exposure to MHV, and were found to be negative (11) . Anti-PCA mAt~ The preparation of mAb 3D4.3 has been previously described (8) . After injection of 106 hybridoma cells into Pristane-primed CAF1 mice, ascites was harvested. Animals were treated with ascitic fluid containing 25, 50, or 100 #g of mAb daily for 7 d preinfection and 7 d postinfection (p.i.) by intraperitoneal injection. As a standard control, 100 ~1 of ascites from animals that were infected with SP2 myeloma cells was injected into six separate mice. All ascitic fluid whether from SP2-or 3D4.3injected mice had no reactivity with MHV-3 either in the ELISA or plaque reduction assays (8) . To ensure that the protective effect of ascites containing mAb to PCA was specific, mAb to PCA (3D4.3) was isolated from hybridoma supematants by affinity chromatography using goat anti-mouse IgG immobilized on Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia, Montreal, Quebec). Immunoblot analysis of the column eluate confirmed that IgG was the only Ig present. Subclass analysis by ELISA, as previously described (8) , confirmed that IgG2ak was the only subclass present. 100 #g of the purified mAb was injected into 10 mice for 7 d preinfection and for 7 d p.i. as described above. Histology. Histology was assessed by a blinded observer as previously described (8) . Briefly, li~r were cut into 1.0 x 0.2-cm blocks and fixed by immersion into 10% formalin in 0.1 molar phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After fixation, the tissue was dehydrated in graded alcohols and xylene, then embedded in paraffin. 4-#m sections were cut, stained with Harris' hematoxylin for 4 min, and counterstained with eosin Y for 30 s. The sections were then washed with distilled water, dehydrated in graded alcohols and xylene, and mounted with Parmount. For each group five animals were used. To quantitate the effect of the mAb on liver histology, a digitalized image analysis system (HP-88; Hewlett Packard Co., Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario) with customized software was used. This constitutes a modification of a technique described previously (12) . The areas of necrosis were encircled as well as the entire section yielding a percentage figure representing the proportion of diseased liver present in that particular section. For each animal, three random sections were assayed in this fashion, and the mean +_ SD was calcuhted. Hbrin deposition was assessed by the Morris-Lendrum Hcro-Mallory stain as previously described (13) . Viral Titers. Livers that had been snap frozen at -70~ were homogenized in DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS and 4 mM glutamine as a 10% homogenate at 4~ as previously described (14) . Viral titers of liver homogenates were then determined on monolayers of L2 cells in a standard plaque assay (2, 13) .
