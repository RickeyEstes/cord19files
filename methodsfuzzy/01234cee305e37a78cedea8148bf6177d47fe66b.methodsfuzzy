Animals and tissue sampling. All investigations were performed on archived postmortem tissue, which has been used in a formerly published animal trial 22 pancreas, tonsil, palatum molle, intestine, abomasum, mesenteric lymph node and eyelid) were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and routinely paraffin-embedded for histology. Serial sections were mounted on coated glass slides (Superfrost Plus ® , Menzel Co.) and stained with HE or processed for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, respectively. Prior to embedding tracheal and nasal tissue were decalcified in 10% disodium-ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA, Serva Electrophoresis GmbH) for 48 h. As an additional control, nasal turbinate of a non-infected dromedary (collected during routine necropsy at the Department of Pathology, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Germany) was used. Euthanasia of the animal was performed due to non-respiratory disease. Camel peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from naïve animals from a previous experiment 22 . Human PBMC were obtained from 3 healthy blood donors (Sanquin Bloodbank, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). The use of PBMCs for scientific research was approved by the Sanquin Bloodbank after informed consent was obtained from the blood donors. The human tonsillar tissue which was used for the establishment of the DPP4-and CEACAM5-specific immunohistochemistry was kindly provided by one of the co-authors (IS) and sampled during tonsillectomy. The human bronchiolar lymph nodes paraffin-embedded tissue samples were obtained from the Erasmus MC Tissue Bank. These tissue samples were taken either from healthy donors or from patients with nonmalignant lung tumors. These tissue samples were residual human biomaterials that were collected, stored, and issued by the Erasmus MC Tissue Bank under ISO 15189:2007 standard operating procedures. Use of these materials for research purposes is regulated according to human tissue and medical research: code of conduct for responsible use (2011). Light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and TUNEL assay. HE stained cross sections of all organs (MVA-S-vaccinated and mock-vaccinated animals, 4 and 14 dpi) were evaluated by light microscopy for the distribution and characterization of lesions induced by MERS-CoV infection. In addition, all organs were screened for the presence of viral antigen by immunohistochemistry using a previously published monoclonal (mc) mouse antibody (Sino Biological Inc.) 22 . According to the results obtained by light microscopy and MERS-CoV-specific immunohistochemistry, nasal and tracheal tissues were further analyzed with respect to the immune response. Immunohistochemistry was performed for the detection of CD3 + T cells (polyclonal rabbit anti-CD3, DakoCytomation GmbH), CD20 + B cells (polyclonal rabbit anti-CD20, Thermo Fisher scientific), and CD204 + macrophages (monoclonal mouse anti-human macrophage scavenger receptor, human CD204, BioLogo) as summarized in Table 1 . The used markers have been previously established for lymphoid dromedary tissue 28 . Additionally, epithelial cells were labeled by application of different antibodies (Table 1 ) directed against pan-cytokeratin (CK; monoclonal mouse anti-Human Cytokeratin, DakoCytomation GmbH), CK5/6 (monoclonal mouse anti-Cytokeratin 5/6, DakoCytomation GmbH), CK 14 (polyclonal rabbit anti-Keratin 14, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and CK18 (monoclonal mouse anti-Cytokeratin 18, Abcam). CEACAM5 was investigated using a polyclonal rabbit anti-human CEACAM5 antibody (Abcam) and DPP4 was visualized using a polyclonal goat anti-DPP4/CD26-specific antibody (R&D Systems). Briefly, after dewaxing in Roticlear ® (Roth C. GmbH & Co. KG) and rehydration in isopropanol and ethanol (96%, Roth C. GmbH & Co. KG), endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation of sections in 85% ethanol with 0.5% H 2 O 2 (VWRTM International GmbH) for 30 min at room temperature (RT). Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating the sections in citrate buffer (2.1 g citric acid monohydrate in 1 l distilled water, adjusted with NaOH to pH = 6.0) for 20 min in a microwave (800 W). Subsequently, sections were transferred to Shandon Coverplates TM (Thermo Electron GmbH) and nonspecific binding was blocked by inactivated 20% rabbit (DPP4) or goat serum (all other antibodies) diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) including 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; PBS/BSA) for 30 minutes. Afterwards sections were incubated with the respective primary antibody for 90 min at RT. For appropriate negative controls, primary antibodies were replaced by ascites fluid from Balb/c mice (1:1000; CD204, pan-CK, CK5/6, CK18, mc MERS-CoV nucleocapsid), goat (1:3000; DPP4) and rabbit serum (1:3000; CD3, CD20, CK14, CEACAM5), respectively. Subsequently, the appropriate secondary biotinylated antibody was added in a dilution of 1:200 with PBS (Table 1) . Incubation for 60 min at RT was followed by treatment with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vectastain ABC Kit Standard, VectorLaboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Visualization of the reaction was achieved by the chromogen 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB, 0.05%, Sigma Aldrich Chemie GmbH) and addition of 0.03% H 2 O 2 . Slides were finally slightly counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Roth C. GmbH & Co KG). Subsequently, double immunofluorescence was implemented to determine the cell tropism of MERS-CoV in dromedaries. For this purpose, the two different MERS-CoV nucleocapsid-specific antibodies were used in combination with antibodies for detection of CD3, CD20, Iba-1 (polyclonal rabbit anti-Iba-1, Wako Chemicals), CD204, CK14, CK18, CK5/6, pan-CK and DPP4, respectively. In addition, single immunofluorescence using anti-acetylated α-tubulin antibody (monoclonal mouse anti-α-tubulin, Sigma-Aldrich) was performed for visualization of the ciliary axoneme 47 . After dewaxing and retrieval of antigens as described above, nonspecific binding was blocked by inactivated 20% horse (DPP4) or goat serum (all other antibodies), respectively, diluted in PBS/0.1% Triton X/1% BSA (PBS/Triton X/BSA) for 30 minutes. Both primary antibodies were applied simultaneously in the respective concentrations (Table 1 ) diluted with PBS/Triton X/BSA. For appropriate negative controls, primary antibodies were replaced by ascites fluid from Balb/c mice (1:1000; pan-CK, CK5/6, CK18, CD204, mc MERS-CoV nucleocapsid, α-tubulin), rabbit (1:3000; CK14, CD3, CD20, Iba-1, pc MERS-CoV nucleocapsid), and goat serum (1:3000; DPP4), respectively. After incubation over night at 4 °C both secondary antibodies were applied simultaneously (1:200 in PBS/Triton X/BSA, Table 1 ) and were incubated for 60 min at RT in the dark to visualize the respective antigens. Nuclear counterstaining was performed with 0.01% bisbenzimide (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH) for 10 minutes and sections were mounted with Dako fluorescence mounting medium (DakoCytomation GmbH). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed to detect cells that undergo extensive DNA degradation during the late stages of apoptosis on the camel nasal epithelium according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Merck KGaA). Tissues pre-treated with DNAse were used as positive control while tissues stained with labelling solution only were used as respective negative control consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations. Flow cytometry. In order to detect which subset of human immune cells expresses DPP4, freshly isolated human PBMCs were incubated with a cocktail of fluorescence labelled monoclonal antibodies, i.e. anti-CD3 (clone SP34-2, BD Biosciences); CD56 (clone MEM188, Serotec); CD20 (clone B9E9, Beckman-Coulter); HLA-DR (clone L243, Biolegend); CD14 (clone M5E2, BD Biosciences); DPP4 (clone 222113, R&D Systems); and live/dead cell viability marker (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Appropriate Ig isotype control antibodies were used as negative controls for each staining. S1 protein of MERS-CoV that recognizes DPP4, used in a previous study 25 , was applied to compare DPP4 expression in camel and human PBMC. Cells were analyzed on a Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and using FlowJo ® software (FlowJo), then subsequently presented as mean percentage of positive cells. Scanning electron microscopy. For scanning electron microscopy, formalin fixed samples of nasal mucosa, trachea, and bronchus of dromedaries infected with MERS-CoV 22 were post-fixed in 5% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH) for 24 hours. Afterwards the samples were dehydrated in a series of graded ethanol, dried and coated in a sputter-coater (SCD 040; Oerlikon Balzers) with gold as described previously 48, 49 .
