All known data was used as a prior for next iteration. It relied on an approximation to the SIR model, whereby incidence at time t + 1, N(t + 1) was approximately Poisson distributed with mean N (t)e (c(R À 1)) (c À1 represents the average duration of the infectious period) (Boelle et al., 2009) . The formulation of probabilistic standard SIR disease transmission models is similar to the time-series SIR approach (Bjørnstad et al., 2002) , where all infectious and susceptible individuals are assumed to mix homogeneously and it simplifies to reconstruct the transmission chains. The standard epidemic susceptible infected model is expressed as: S is the average number of susceptibles at time t, I is the average number of infections, N is the size of the population, which decreases due to disease-induced deaths, b is the contact rate (Bettencourt and Ribeiro, 2008) . After an average residence time c À1 , infectious individuals recover or die. The Bayesian procedure is engaged to convert time series of case numbers to a probability distribution. The proposed algorithm, described in a Bayesian framework, started with a non-informative prior on the distribution of the reproduction number R ( fig. 1) . The distribution was updated as new data was observed, using (Obadia et al., 2012 ). An exponential growth for the epidemic
