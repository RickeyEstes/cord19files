This article brings together a number of secondary sources, as well as research conducted by the author with the leading spa association in Ontario, Canada in an effort to present an overview of the characteristics of the supply of and demand for spa, and the forces that continuing to shape both aspects. The secondary sources include the annual supply-side surveys conducted by ISPA, as well as their annual consumer trends surveys, although Canada is not always treated as a separate assessment. In addition, the Canadian Tourism Commission (CTC) undertook three studies in the mid-2000s into the supply of spas in Canada (in collaboration with ISPA), the profile of the Canadian spa consumer and the competition for this product. The CTC, in partnership with the provincial ministries of tourism, also spearheaded a Travel Attitudes and Motivation Study in both 1999 and 2006 with exten-Volume 17 2010 sive phone interviews and mail-back surveys (for a detailed comparison of methodologies, see Joppe & Choi, 2010 ) that provided a rich source of information about non destination-specific attitudes, motivations and behaviours of the Canadian population. The author has also had the opportunity for extensive mining of these datasets, the results of which have been published in a series of conference proceedings (Joppe & Choi, 2008; . Finally, the author conducted extensive studies into the training and education needs (Joppe & Choi, 2007a , 2007b and curricula addressing a variety of spa-related career options in private and public institutions in Ontario (Joppe, 2007) as well as the wage structure of the province's spa industry (Joppe, 2009 ).
