Biowarfare agent threat is the foremost national and world security concern, attributable to their potential economic, psychological, and social impact. Effective protection against BWAs is quite difficult because of their intricate detection and expensive protection measures. To counter this threat, several countries have established their own biodefence programs to strengthen the strategies for detection, protection, and decontamination of biowarfare agents (Pal et al., 2016) . Early detection and identification of BWAs is essential to initiate corrective emergency responses for management of such incidents. Efforts are being made across the globe for development of efficient technologies and systems for detection and identification of BWAs. Many advanced molecular and microbiological sensing techniques such as antibody-based immunoassays, cellular fatty acid profiling, flow cytometry, nucleic acid based detection, mass spectrometry, microbiological culturing, and genomic analysis have been used for primary identification of biological agents. These techniques are highly reliable, sensitive, and selective, and have been successfully applied for detection of potential biowarfare agents. However, despite the handiness of available techniques and tools, no foolproof system is available for the complete detection of hazardous biowarfare agents. Regardless of being highly efficient, these detection methods possess various drawbacks such as complicated and laborious isolation and purification procedures, low detection limits, contrasting etiology and pathology, and different physiochemical and structural attributes of bioagents, which ultimately affect the detection efficacy (Suter, 2003; Sapsford et al., 2008; Das and Kataria, 2010; Madad, 2014) . Immunoassays based on antigen-antibody interactions have been widely exploited for identification of potential biowarfare agents. Antibodies bind to specific antigens present on the surface of the cell and form a colored or detectable complex, which ultimately marks the presence/detection of a bioagent in the sample. Enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) has been mainly used for quantitative detection of antigen following the basic principle of immunoassays. ELISA has been widely used for diagnosis of several diseases and simultaneous screening of large number of samples. Thus, the technique is highly efficient, economical, and reliable. To date, ELISAs have been successfully employed for the detection of biowarfare agents such as B. anthracis, B. pseudomallei, B. mallei, Brucella abortus, Ebola virus, F. tularensis, Marburg virus, toxins, and Y. pestis. Besides these, fluorescent microscopy has also been used for biowarfare agent detection, where a fluorescent labeled antibody attached to antigenic receptors present on the surface of the microbial cells aids in its detection. Immuno-histochemical based methods have also enabled detection of some viruses such as Alphaviruses and Chikanguniya viruses (Wang et al., 2008) . Other immunoassay, namely, hand-held immuno-chromatographic assays (HHIAs), are also used for detection of biowarfare agents such as B. anthracis, B. abortus, B. pseudomallei, botulinum, F. tularensis, smallpox virus, Ricin toxin, variola virus, and Y. pestis. HHIAs are cost-effective, simple, rapid, and are performed on nitrocellulose or nylon membranes and are based on lateral flow immunoassays. Even having several advantages, these assays are less sensitive and specific as compared to other immunological methods (Gomes-Solecki et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2009; Ghosh and Goel, 2012; Sharma et al., 2013; Pal et al., 2016) . For decades, humans have solely relied on vaccines for protection against infectious viruses. However, to date it has not become completely feasible to develop vaccines against all the viral infections; moreover vaccines are not believed to be completely effective against all the infections (Henderson et al., 2003; Quinn et al., 2008) . So, challenges associated with development, efficacy, and safety of vaccines have eventually led to emergence of better alternatives for prevention of viral diseases. These alternatives are more efficient than vaccines as they directly target the particular virus and interrupt its life cycle at molecular level by use of antibodies, specific proteins, and oligonucleotides. Such strategies, referred to as "biochemical prevention and treatment," have been considered more successful than vaccines/ chemical drugs for protection of humans against some pathogenic viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV, and human rhinovirus (HRV). Biochemical prevention and treatment strategies generate immediate response and protection against a particular infection, whereas in the case of vaccines, it takes a longer time and booster doses for the generation of an immune response. These strategies work by following two mechanisms; one by blocking viral entry via use of host cell receptor blockers or by protein-based specific antiviral molecules, and secondly by targeting the viral mRNA and inhibiting viral replication by use of antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, and RNA interference (Le Calvez et al., 2004) . Chimeric proteinaceous toxins have proved to be effective therapeutics for providing protection against HIV-1 infection. Two chimeric toxins, namely CD4-PE40 and 3B3 (Fv)-PE38, were designed to target the HIV envelope (Env), which selectively kill the infected cells. These chimeric toxins were further tested against mice models to investigate their potential therapeutic efficacy against HIV and markedly suppressed acute HIV-1 infection (Goldstein et al., 2000) . However, peptide-based drugs generally face issues of low potency and unfavorable pharmacokinetics. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been widely used as biochemical therapeutics. Development of chimeric, humanized, and antiviral antibodies has been very beneficial for treatment of many viral infections. An FDA approved monoclonal antibody known as Synagis was developed and proved successful in prevention and treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This antibody inhibits viral replication by binding specifically to the RSV surface glycoprotein and has been considered as the primary medical means of providing protection against RSV (Cohen, 2000) . Host cell receptor blockers have also proven to be efficient in inhibiting viral infections by blocking virus entry into the cell. Receptor-blocking has been commonly carried out via application of monoclonal antibodies that bind to specific epitopes present on the receptor molecules. A MAb was generated against ICAM-1 (adhesion molecule responsible for viral entry and attachment), which was capable of providing protection against infections caused by human rhinoviruses (HRV) (Marlin et al., 1990) . However, the efficacy of MAbs is limited to an extent because of their low functional affinity for adhesion molecules in comparison to multivalent viral particles (Casasnovas and Springer, 1995) . To overcome this challenge, avidity or functional affinity of antiviral antibodies was improved by the generation of recombinant antibodies. A tetravalent recombinant antibody, CFY196, with improved avidity was developed against ICAM-1 and was capable of preventing HRV infections (Charles et al., 2003) . Antisense-oligonucleotides (AS-ONs) are short synthetic oligonucleotides that inhibit viral protein production by blocking viral mRNA translation have also been explored for providing protection against viral infections. Vitravene, the first AS-ON based drug, is a potent antiviral agent for cytomegalovirus retinitis (a herpes-like eye disease). Vitravene binds complementarily to the viral messenger RNA and inhibits its translation and hence prevents the infection caused by human cytomegalovirus (Orr, 2001) . Antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) have also been used for providing protection against viral infections mainly caused by filoviruses (Iversen et al., 2012; Nan and Zhang, 2018) . Ribozymes are catalytically active oligonucleotides, which selectively bind and cleave target RNAs. Ribozymes have been considered as better alternatives to AS-ONs. Successful animal and cell based trials have been carried out, which confirms the use of ribozymes as potent antiviral agents. Ribozymes have been efficient viral inhibitors for infections such as influenza, hepatitis B and C, HIV, etc. (Yu et al., 1993; Tang et al., 1994; Welch et al., 1996 Welch et al., , 1997 . HEPTAZYME, a modified ribozyme, cleaves target entry site of the hepatitis C virus and hence inhibits the infection. However, further research on use of ribozymes as biotherapeutics has been hampered by low potency and inefficient in vivo intracellular delivery. In contrast to this, RNA interference has significantly enhanced potency in comparison to other technologies. Therefore, only low levels of RNAi based antiviral drugs are sufficient to generate an effective immune response. Synthetic siRNAs have potential applications as potent antiviral agents. RNAi technology has been successfully applied for inhibition of replication of several pathogenic viruses such as filoviruses, influenza virus, HIV-1, poliovirus, and RSV (Jacque et al., 2002; Novina et al., 2003; Ge et al., 2003; Ursic-Bedoya et al., 2013) . Effective decontamination systems are required to combat the threat of bioterror attacks and to minimize adverse effects caused by hazardous biological agents. The traditional methods for decontamination of biowarfare agents involve the use of bleaches and decontamination solutions, which are generally referred as "wet" solutions. Spread of infectious agents is not limited to a particular environment or space, as they easily transmit form one place to another by means of their spores; hence, it is necessary to decontaminate concerned surfaces and buildings also. Localized small-scale remediation has usually been done by treating contaminated surfaces with liquid formulations of decontaminant solutions such as hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide gas dissolved in water, phenolics, sodium hypochlorite, and quaternary ammonium compounds, or decontamination foams. Large-scale remediation can be done by fumigating with chlorine dioxide gas in specific locations. Other tested decontamination agents include ethylene oxide, glutaraldehyde, hydrogen peroxide vapor, peracetic acid, ortho-phthalaldehyde, ozone, and paraformaldehyde. These chemical decontaminants are known to have potential effectiveness against B. anthracis spores, but chlorine dioxide gas is considered as one of the best decontamination alternative for the fumigation of heavily contaminated/ infected areas. However, it is time-consuming, as it takes long contact time for such chemical solutions to disinfect viruses and spores before removing with fresh water. Washing with soap and water is also a general personal decontamination procedure. Washing with hot soapy water removes most of the biological contaminates from emergency responders who have been exposed to biological agents. Alcohol solutions are also considered effective for decontamination of hard nonporous surfaces. Generally, 70% alcohol solutions are used for the decontamination of most of the biological contaminates. But being highly flammable, use of alcohol solutions is restricted to a particular level. Autoclaving, dry heat, thermal washer disinfection, ultrasonication, and sterilization are other commonly used decontamination procedures. These methods are effective against most of the biological agents but disposal of decontamination reagents and contaminated waste water is still challenging. Hence, the use of such perilous chemicals is limited to an extent because of requirement of special biosafety approvals for their storage, transport, and disposal. Also, some risks have been associated with use of wet chemicals as they often lead to the corrosion of materials such as leather, plastics, paints, metals, rubber, and skin. So, the use of these hazardous chemicals on sensitive equipment and materials is not recommended. Moreover, these chemicals are nonspecific in nature and, when released into the environment, lead to toxification and degradation of our natural resources. Thus, the existing decontamination systems are not thoroughly effective (Hawley and Eitzen, 2001; Raber et al., 2001; Kumar et al., 2010) . There is a strong need of ideal and eco-friendly decontamination technologies that focus on selective and effective disinfection of biowarfare agents. Decontaminants are required that are generally present in dry forms, can be easily transported with no mass storage requirement, and are fast working. Hence, alternative decontamination methods have been developed that include the use of ionizing and nonionizing radiations, thermal energy, and reactive gases produced by plasmas. Ionizing gamma radiations were also used for the decontamination of biological agents but somehow led to the destruction of sensitive equipment. Nonionizing ultraviolet (UV) radiation has also been tested for the destruction of some biological agents, but the success of this technique was limited because of resistance of dried spores to UV radiation. Thermal energy methods have also been tried, but their efficiency is limited by the temperature constraint; also, it leads to the damage of surfaces or equipment and the method is relatively time consuming. A portable arc-seeded microwave plasma torch was developed and applied for the decontamination of biological warfare agents. Emission spectroscopy of the plasma torch revealed the production of ample amounts of reactive atomic oxygen that effectively oxidized the biological agents. Moreover, plasma or gas in a highly energized state is highly reactive, which is capable of destruction of all kinds of organic contaminants by means of a nonthermal method. For decontamination purposes, B. cereus was selected simulant of B. anthracis spores. The results revealed that all spores were killed in <8s at 3 cm distance, 12 s at 4 cm distance, and 16 s at 5 cm distance away from the nozzle of the torch. Thus, plasma torch can be also used as an alternative decontamination technique (Lai et al., 2005) . A research and development project was also initiated for providing novel decontamination systems against biowarfare agents with key focus on effective, economical, fast, nontoxic, and specific decontamination. The project also aimed for the development of adsorptive elimination technologies or deactivation technologies using photocatalysis technique (Seto, 2009) . Vacuum cleaning with HEPA filtration is also considered to be an effective decontamination method that reduces the particulate load to allow effective remediation. HEPA vacuuming is reported to be more efficient than fumigation procedures. In the present scenario, the existing decontamination systems are not so effective and specific, thus their efficiency is limited to an extent. Thus, the authors propose a strong need of development of more effective, specific, and eco-friendly decontamination technologies with key focus on selective and effective disinfection of biowarfare agents (Raber et al., 2001; Fitch et al., 2003; Weis et al., 2002) .
