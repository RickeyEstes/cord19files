Site-sprcific mutations within the IBV frameshift region were prepared using a procedure based on the method described by Kunkel (1985) (Brierley et al., 1989) . Plasmid pFS8 (or mutant derivatives, see below) contains the intergenic region of the filamentous bacteriophage fl (Dotto et aI.; 1981) enabling single-stranded pFS8 DNA to be generated following infection of plasmid-carrying bacteria with bacteriophage R408 (Russel et al., 1986) . I'racil-containing. single-stranded DXA substrates for mutagenesis were prepared by R408-superinfection of plasmid-carrying Escherichia coli RZ1032 cells (dutuny-: Kunkel, 1985) . Mutagenic oligonucleotides were svnthesized using an Applied Riosystems 381A DNA synthesizer and the mutagenesis reactions performed as before (Brierley et al.. 1989) . Mutants were identified by dideoxy sequencing (Sanger et al., 1977) of single-stranded DNA templates rescued from E. coli ,JMlOl (Yanisch-Perron et al.. 1985) . (b) ('onstruction of plasmids Plasmid pFS8 (see the text) was constructed from plasmid pFS7 (Brierley et aE., 1989) by introducing an oligonucleotide (sequence 5' AATTAATACGACTCACTA-TAGGGAGA 3') containing the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter just downstream from the bacteriophage SP6 RNA polymerase promoter of pFS7, bv sitedirected mutagenesis. Plasmid pFS8.47, a derivative of pFS8 was constructed as follows. Firstly, a unique XhoI restriction endonuclease cut-site was introduced into loop 2 of the IBV pseudoknot (see the text) at position 12,406 in the IBV genome (Boursnell et al., 1987) by insertion mutagenesis to create plasmid pFS8.1. Plasmid pVBZ+ (Brierley et al.. 1987) Plasmids for transcription were prepared hy t,he alkaline lysis mini-preparation method (Hirnboim & Daly, 1979) and linearized by digestion with SmaI. Digests were extracted once with a mixture of phenol and chloroform (1 : 1, by vol.) and the aqueous phase passed through a Sephadex G-50 spin column (Maniatis et al., 1982) equilibrated with water. Linearized template was concentrated by precipitation with ethanol and transcribed as described (Brierley et al., 1987) . except that T7 RPU'A polymerase (Gihco-Bethesda Research Laboratories) replaced SP6 RNA polymerase and the concentration of each ribonucleotide in the reaction was doubled (to I mM each of ATP, CTP. I:TP and 0%)5 mM-GTP). Purified mRNAs were translated in rabbit reticulocyt,e lysates as described (Brierley et al., 1987) and translation products analysed on SDS/ 10 y0 (w/v) polyacrylamide gels according to standard procedures (Hames, 1981) . The relative abundance of non-frameshifted or frameshifted products on the gels was estimated by scanning densitometry and adjusted to take into account the differential methionine content of the products. Linearization of the plasmid with SmaI and in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase yields an mRNA (2.8 kb)
