Case study was used as the methodology for this paper. In particular, for situations dealt with by Korea and Korea's disaster management policies, an in-depth examination of disaster management and its related context in Korea was undertaken. We used qualitative data and analysis such as of Korean policy documents, literature review, and observations of government agencies. In terms of data collection and analysis, we collected and coded literature and government documents via Internet search engines. Regarding Korean policies, we mostly typed a specific term "Korean disaster management" via Korean KISS, DBpia, and the website of MPSS, and others, when thinking that not many data are available compared with international data. To know about the principles of international disaster management, we typed several terms such as "the principles of disaster management," "disaster management and stakeholders," "comprehensive emergency management," and others via ScienceDirect, OUP, Google Scholar, and the like. Among many search terms and coding process, we took note of the lopsided aspect of Korean policies by utilizing Korean government's white papers as well as the observation of government agencies. Also, data on comprehensive emergency management in the international community contributed to informing the conclusion in the paper. When using a single-case study, generalization(s) cannot be made easily. However, this type of study has many advantages including the ability to obtain depth in data and analysis. Similarly, a single-case study cannot be generalized because the case may not be reflective of common occurrences in the area of study. However, a single-case study can provide a good opportunity for determining innovative solutions for the specific case or setting studied (Baxter and Jack, 2008) . We compared two approaches, namely the exclusive approach and the inclusive approach when it comes to disaster management in Korea. Following Fig. 1 , the former approach (left side) is limited in who participates in disaster management, while the latter (right side) includes collaborative efforts among a variety of stakeholders. Two big circles indicate the boundaries of the participation in disaster management. The comparison was made in the context of effectiveness, strategies used, and policies. Based on the comparison (a two-sided arrow) of the two approaches, we discussed implications on how to facilitate inclusive management in the international community by following a curved arrow. In the exclusive approach, not all stakeholders are allowed to participate in disaster management, whereas in the inclusive approach, most, if not all stakeholders are represented and they participate. In other words, in exclusive management, disaster management is available only to certain professionals. On the other hand, in inclusive management, disaster management is open to everyone, not limited to certain professional. Our results will show that the latter is more effective and so Korea needs to change and adopt the latter approach. In comparing the two approaches, we attempted to identify all stakeholders in the Korean field of disaster management including government employees, first responders, volunteers, residents, and others. The needs of different stakeholders may be in conflict with one another. In short, the inclusion of all stakeholders in disaster management has significantly increased the complexity of disaster management (Hernantes et al. 2013) . Among many disaster management professionals, we have identified four major stakeholders (as shown in Fig. 1 ): the central government, local governments, incident commander, and other stakeholders. The category of other stakeholders includes many such as mass media, researchers, business enterprises, and the public, in general. These four major stakeholders are the most important players in the Korean field of disaster management, if examining the extent of their influence via not only government documents, but also the observation of government agencies on Internet websites. They also interact during the occurrence of a disaster. The first three variables are drawn from the government groups, while the fourth one is done from the other stakeholders. The first three stakeholders may be considered major stakeholders and the fourth one, the 'minority', if you look at their current roles, which are minimal or nonexistent, in Korea's current practices.
