(c) Gap &ructure and direct RNA sequencing The 5' end cap structure of BBV RNA1 was determined as described (Dasgupta et al., 1976) . RKAl was decapped enzymatically (Efstratiadis et at., 1977), dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase and was treated with kinase by [y-32P]ATP and phage T4 polynucleotide kinase (Dasgupta et al., 1980) . Such labeled RNA1 was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sequenced by mobility shift analysis (Dasgupta & Kaesberg, 1977) and by enzymatic RNA sequencing (Donis-Keller, 1980) . (d) Complementary DNA synthesis, cloning and sequencing DNA complementary to BBV RNA1 was synthesized with reverse transcriptase, with p(dT),, or with partially digested calf thymus DNA as primers. Single-stranded cDNAs were converted to the double-stranded form which, after oligo(dC)-tailing with terminal transferase, were annealed to pBR322 that had been linearized with Pstl and tailed with oligo(dG). These were used to transform Escherichia coEi Mm-294 (Daghert & Ehrlich, 1979; Ahlquist et al., 1981a) . Clones containing recombinant plasmids were selected on the basis of their resistance to tetracycline and sensitivity to ampicillin (Villa-Komaroff et al., 1978) and then were screened for the presence of BBV RNA1 sequences by the in situ colony hybridization technique of Grunstein & Hogness (1975) . Randomly primed cDNAs of RNA1 and subsequently inserts, nick-translated by the method of Maniatis et al. (1975) , were used as hybridization probes. Recombinant plasmids carrying BBVl cDNA inserts were isolated by the alkaline lysis procedure (Ish-Horowitz & Burke, 1981; Brinboim & Doly, 1979) . Plasmid DNAs were cleaved by PstI. Their cDNA inserts were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were sequenced by the chemical method of Maxam & Gilbert (1980) . Experiments involving recombinant plasmids were carried out under PI/EKI containment. as prescribed by the National Institutes of Health guidelines. (e) Computer analyses Sequences were assembled with the computer program of Staden (1980) and were further analyzed with software from the IJW Genetics computer group (Devereaux et al., 1984) . Secondary structure was analyzed by the methods of Zuker & Stiegler (1981) . terminus of RNA1 and to use oligo(dT) as a primer to synthesize full-length DNA copies to be used for direct sequencing and for cloning and subsequent sequencing. Polyadenylation of the 3' terminus proved to be difficult (see below), however, we found that oligo(dT) served as efficient internal primer on RNA1 and we used this to our advantage for obtaining most of the RNA1 sequence. Such cDNAs, obtained by internal priming, were cloned and several of the recombinant plasmids carrying RNA1 inserts were isolated. The largest insert, designated PIB23 ( Fig. 2(b) ), was sequenced and was found to overlap the 5' end region of RNA1
