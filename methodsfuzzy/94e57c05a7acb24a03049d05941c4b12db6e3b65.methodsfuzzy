Goals l To eliminate, contain or reduce health problems and related consequences. l To prevent the occurrence or recurrence of problems. Describe the distribution and size of disease problems in human populations. l Identify etiological (i.e., the cause of disease) processes and factors involved in the pathogenesis of disease. l Provide data essential to the planning, implementation, and assessment of services for the prevention, control, and treatment of disease and to establish priorities among these services. in health promotion or health administration and its application in clinical medicine. Life-long learning provides essential knowledge for scientific reasoning, and the ability to evaluate the literature critically, skills essential for physicians and other health workers to analyze and incorporate new information. Epidemiology and demography are necessary, but not sufficient alone, for the determination of health policy. Other factors include the funds, human resources, and facilities availability, and their utilization, community attitudes, and political will. Epidemiology, health care financing, and resource allocation relate to supply and demand, and ultimately to policy. These are all issues of great importance to the management of health systems and addressing the changing needs of an aging population with growing obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases, while infectious diseases continue to play an important role in population health. They are also of importance in addressing issues of inequalities in health even in countries with universal access through national health insurance. In the USA, without universal health insurance, a serious gap in social policy has many downstream effects perpetuating social and ethnic disparities in health. The multidisciplinarity of epidemiology is also essential to the formulation of policy and operation of health systems. It is essential for the smooth functioning of a health system, as a method of analysis, and as a monitoring tool. Assessment and monitoring of the health status of a population are, by their very nature, multifactorial. Preliminary and, perhaps, impressionistic reading of the situation makes use of data available from routine sources and serves to generate hypotheses for testing. Evaluation is a more formal and systematic approach in determining the quality of the health of a population as objectively as possible. All evaluations need to look at the input, process, and output of a system. The epidemiological method is applied to measurements (indicators) of inputs (resources) of a health system, the process (manner) of their utilization, and outcomes of care (indicators of morbidity, mortality, or functional status of a population). Analysis of these complex factors provides the intelligence or feedback for managing the broad scope of public health. The New Public Health integrates assessment, evaluation, and epidemiological analysis with the organization, supply of health care, and other factors relating to the health of the community as a whole. These disciplines provide vital material to link population health needs and the use of resources. Epidemiology is addressing new challenges of social equity in health; this has become an important part of modern epidemiology with the growing understanding that social conditions and cultural background are key factors not only in disease incidence and prevalence, but in access to health care, both preventive and curative. While the epidemiological identification of health inequality/inequity has been important in identifying the extent and severity of the issues, it is in the utilization of these data in policy making and action where the real challenge lies. Gender, sexual preference and behavior, ethnicity, place of residence, income, family status, religion and religiosity, social connectivity, occupation, and education are all part of the health-sickness spectrum.  The scope and depth of research methods and the many other quantitative and qualitative sciences related to conducting investigations of health and disease in population groups are now important elements of training in public health. This area of public health is basic not only for research but also in reading the literature of a dynamic field such as public health, and in the design of policies and intervention programs, resource allocation, and the management of health systems. Research and surveys are integral parts of public health practice, and especially of academic public health. Familiarity with their basic principles is an important part of the preparation of public health professionals and a responsibility of academic centers training the public health workforce. A thorough review of the peer-reviewed literature is a prerequisite for development of a study, requiring skills in the use of Internet search engines such as PubMed and Medline, as well as important sources such as the CDC Atlanta, the WHO, and other respected professional bodies. Organized literature reviews are called Cochrane Reviews, after the leading British epidemiologist Archie Cochrane, using meta-analysis. This is a formal method of review and analysis of multiple studies of a causal relationship of a therapeutic or preventive measure that yields a quantitative aggregate summary of all results. Meta-analysis includes selection of studies of similar design, mostly of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), pooling of the data to make a larger sample. This increases the chance that any change and comparison of study and control groups would be statistically significant, but also based on critical analysis and selection of those studies meeting acceptable criteria of methodology. A 2007 study reported in The Lancet on meta-analysis of previous studies showed a significant benefit of folic acid supplementation in reducing the incidence and severity of stroke, whereas individual studies were equivocal or showed change that was not statistically significant. The formulation of a study question and its hypothesis includes defining its purposes and objectives. This leads to basic study design, definition and selection of the study population, sample selection, and selection of variables to be measured. A study is dependent on funding and the presentation of the proposal is crucial for success. The study design requires development and testing of survey instruments, organization of the study team, and collection of BOX 3.12 Measures of the Burden of Disease l Potential years of life lost (PYLL) -PYLL is a measure of the relative impact of various diseases and lethal forces on society. It highlights the loss to society as a result of youthful or early deaths. The figure for PYLL due to a particular cause is the sum, over all people dying of that cause, of the years that these people would have lived had they reached a specified age. DALYs are calculated by a formula that includes five main components: the duration of time lost due to a death at each age, disability weights, age weights, time preference (expressed as a discounting function), and the integration of health measures among a population. DALYs for a disease or health condition are calculated as the sum of the years of life lost (YLL) due to premature mortality in the population and the years of healthy life lost from some degree of disability (YLD) for incident cases of the health condition. For detailed procedures on how to calculate DALYs, see WHO (2001 WHO ( , 2010 . data. Assessment of reliability and validity of the data is a key part of preparing it for analysis. Training in research methods is thus integral to studies of epidemiology and descriptive and inferential statistics. Qualitative methods, including quantitative measures used in the social and behavioral sciences, are also important in public health, with health behavior as a basis for "lifestyle" or personal choices. These methods are also applied to societal conditions, cultural, socioeconomic and geographic factors, and support systems, which are all related to fundamental risk factors for some diseases and their severity, access to health care, and health outcomes. They are also related to organizational systems, management of health systems, economics, and professional interactions. In these areas, the applicable social sciences include sociology, psychology, anthropology, political science, organization theory, and information technology. "Social marketing" is based on the study of human behavior and how to change it. Public health campaigns against risk factors such as smoking or high-risk sexual behavior depend on such knowledge of awareness, attitudes, behavior, and practices. Qualitative studies are more exploratory and developmental in pursuit of non-numerical aspects of the study question, and relate to attitudes, concerns, fears, and social aspects of study questions crucial to success in public health. Examples include studies of teen pregnancies, parental concerns regarding new vaccines, sexual practices such as condom use, interfamilial relationships and their impact on risk behavior and antisocial behavior, and smoking-related issues. Epidemiological and qualitative studies can be complementary to each other, providing important scientific evidence related to real public health issues of national and international importance. Interpretation of statistical events requires a familiarity with methods of gathering and processing basic information. Statistics is "the science and art of collecting, summarizing, and analyzing data that are subject to random variation" (Last, 2001) . Biostatistics is the application of statistics to biological problems. The direct method of standardization is used when agegender-specific mortality rates are known for the populations being compared to a standard population. These rates are then applied to the standard population to calculate the expected numbers of deaths for each group in the population, as if its composition (with respect to the variable being standardized for) were the same as in the standard population. They are then summed and divided by the total standard population to give a summary adjusted rate. Standardized death rates can be calculated for particular diseases. For example, if one is comparing lung cancer death rates in a number of countries to see whether there are differences that might be attributed to external factors such as air pollution patterns, the data for each city can be compared using standardized (cause-specific) mortality rates. The direct standardization of rates is an important method of comparing mortality patterns between cities, districts, regions, and countries. Table 3 .6 shows mortality rates from a range of countries with very different age distributions comparing mortality from NCDs in 2004. With age standardization, countries can be compared with key causes of mortality which illustrate the high rates of mortality from NCDs in developing and mid-level income countries. Age adjustment of rates is important for time trends and comparisons between countries and regions within countries. When age-gender-specific mortality rates for the study population are not available or if the numbers in some age groups are too small, the indirect method of standardization is used. This method uses known age-gender-specific rates from a standard population to calculate the expected number of the same health event for the population being studied, given that population's distribution (Box 3.16). The expected number of deaths or cases thus calculated is then compared to the actually observed number of deaths or  Public health research capacity is important to investigate how diseases are generated by causative agents, and in the context of contributory factors, how the social, physical, or policy environment influences people's perceptions and behavior. Research methods in epidemiology rely on quantitative studies based on centuries of population data analysis. Quantitative studies are important for new epidemiological and clinical research. They are the basis for analysis of routinely collected health information such as births, mortality and morbidity rates, and associated factors. They also investigate the utilization of health services, such as shortand long-term hospitalization by cause, and many others such as registries of birth defects, cancer, diabetes, asthma, neurological disorders and other diseases, and socioeconomic data. Quantitative research uses questionnaires and surveys, including telephone and electronic mail surveys, to provide objective evidence of population health, and its associated factors such as nutrition, smoking, diet, physical activity, self-defined health status, activities of daily living, and many other measures of health and social well-being. Some surveys study age, gender, and ethnic groups for biological factors by, for example, BMI, micronutrient levels (e.g., vitamin D), blood lipid levels, and dietary intake. These are basic to monitoring population disease as cornerstones of public health. Quantitative research yield data analyzed as rates, proportions, associations, and multifactorial correlations. Quantitative surveys emphasize structure, consistency, precisely worded questions, and analysis methods to quantify experiences and produce measurable outcomes. Quantitative studies generate or use existing databases for analysis which can aid understanding and add precision in evidence of disease risk factors that have become part of modern epidemiology and public health, such as smoking and cholesterol, the reduction of which has led to declines in cardiovascular and cancer mortality (see Chapter 5). Qualitative research methodologies developed by social sciences are valuable in the direct observation of behavior and attitudes, and have been especially important in exploring issues related to human sexuality, strategies for managing complex public health issues such as the AIDS pandemic, malaria control, and many other public health challenges. Qualitative research is increasingly related to health issues. The social sciences (psychology, sociology, and anthropology) are important in studying human behavior and the societies in which they live, but with increasing difficulty in trying to explain human behavior in quantifiable, measurable terms alone. Although qualitative research also starts with research questions, these may change with the experience of addressing people in an open fashion in their own communities. This helps to generate knowledge of social influences and processes by understanding what they mean to people. Qualitative research methods are valuable for exploration, with open-ended collection of information by questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups to develop hypotheses for further study using quantitative methods. These types of study supplement quantitative research, or provide new hypotheses and issues for quantitative research to provide important information on the policy alternatives for decision making, and to modify intervention programs. Clinical observation and analysis is a form of qualitative methodology with exploratory epidemiology that has contributed greatly to development of the field. The observations of Peter Panum of measles in the Faroe Islands in the 1840s made an enormous contribution to infectious disease epidemiology. Observations of a large number of cases of infant cataracts by Australian ophthalmologist Norman Gregg in 1941 led to the discovery of rubella syndrome. The observation in 1979 by pathologist Robin Warren in Adelaide, Australia, of small, curved, organism-like objects in crypts of gastric biopsy specimens led to the discovery of Helicobacter pylori as the cause of chronic peptic ulcer disease in the early 1980s, and the Nobel Prize in 2005 (see Chapter 1). In the early years of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, qualitative research provided clues for educational and behavioral interventions that were the only tools available until the advent of ART in the 1990s. Quantitative and qualitative methods, in principle, both start with a research question as a study hypothesis but differ in their methods of data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Researchers working with behavioral aspects of health serve to generate hypotheses or modifications for quantitative studies or trial interventions. Qualitative researchers should be familiar with methods of quantitative research, and vice versa. In the era of webs of causation, with multiple factors in play, quantitative research provides greater precision and statistical strength to determine causal relationships. Qualitative research provides valuable exploration to elucidate questions which can add to our understanding of the epidemiology of a multifactorial causation, especially regarding compliance with best practices. Both methods are vital to progress in public health (Table 3 .12). The emphasis in qualitative research is on exploration. It relies on the synergy between design and discovery, and thus is valuable for program evaluation. This research helps investigators to elucidate and understand how the social, physical, or policy environment influences people's perceptions and behavior. It does this by focusing on both verbal and non-verbal language using an unstructured interview format so that participants can answer for as long and as openly as they choose. Important clues to public health issues can be revealed by talking to people. For example, studies on the use of lowcost insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) to prevent malaria in sub-Saharan Africa showed cultural and beliefs to be important in their uptake, including information on their benefit, seasonality of use, and many other factors that could only be determined by interviews and community participation focus groups (Binka and Adongo, 1997) . Another study report on this issue (Alaii et al., 2003) states: "… findings from our anthropologic studies early in the trial indicated that the study population would accept and use ITNs. After introduction, an array of social and cultural issues associated with the ITN studies became apparent. While the majority of these problems could be addressed during the trial they illustrate the shifting roles of communication, time, and the social system in the diffusion process. Individuals seek information at various stages of the diffusion process to decrease uncertainty about its expected consequences. The decision leads to either rejection or adoption of the innovation and success or failure of the intervention." In another example, research focusing on high birth rates among indigenous adolescent women in rural Mexico would require quantitative surveys to provide relevant data such as the percentage of women pregnant in the age groups 15-17 and 17-19, the probability that a woman will use a contraceptive method, frequency of abortions, or the risk of her dying from pregnancy. Qualitative research would be able to elucidate factors such as misinformation regarding contraception, parental or partner opinions about adolescent pregnancy, and beliefs and problems regarding accessing prenatal and postnatal care. Qualitative research methods can operate independently or complement quantitative instruments by either proceeding or preceding them, depending on the study goals. Qualitative research is guided by the research problem and community responses in less formal questionnaires or discussion with community residents and key people, which can fuel further research questions. A conceptual framework is often applied to keep the research directed and dictates the combination of questions asked such as ones based on experiences, behaviors, opinions, values, concerns, or knowledge. Qualitative research should be dynamic, using questions and approaches that evolve as new insights are gained. Approaches to data collection can take the form of words, images, and observations; observation, in-depth interviews, and focus groups are the fundamental approaches to qualitative research. Other methods, such as documentary research and videotaping, can also play an important role in gaining participants' perspectives. Entering the community by acknowledging and consulting with "gatekeepers" or leaders of the potential research site population helps in accessing members of the community. It also facilitates follow-up, such as identifying local people to work with, presenting oneself and the research to key stakeholders, and recruiting participants. Researchers often visit common meeting places, chat with potential participants, and then select a sample purposively based on readiness of individuals to participate, as well as their demographic characteristics to represent a defined subgroup. Sampling can be varied and, depending on strategy, In-depth information on fewer participants Conclusions in keeping with the findings, limitations of the study, more research questions indicated, and policy implications may select homogeneous, heterogeneous, extreme, or typical participants. Pilot testing often follows to assess how well the objectives of the study are fulfilled, and provides the opportunity to circumvent any constraints and obstacles before study initiation. One-to-one, or in-depth interviewing allows participants to play an active role in determining the direction of the interview. Questions follow the flow of conversation and the interview has a conversational quality. The interviews can take the form of unstructured informal conversations, or can be semi-structured or structured. They generate empirical data as participants talk freely about their experiences and beliefs. This is an effective approach when inquiring about sensitive information and when assessing an individual's opinions and perceptions rather than understanding community norms and customs. In-depth interviews can highlight the differences between individuals, elicit detailed information, and also provide a forum for follow-up questions. In the 1960s, the NHANES began to study the US population health and nutrition behaviors and the links between dietary habits and NCDs. By the 1980s, epidemiological evidence showed that personal health behavior was a major risk for premature morbidity and mortality from many diseases including lung cancer, CVD, and HIV, and health promotion became an established part of public health. In 1984, the CDC established behavioral surveys with standard questionnaires administered through telephone surveys to monitor established risk factors in 15 states of the USA. These surveys supplement other important epidemiological monitoring systems, such as vital statistics, disease registries, and health systems monitoring, with counterparts in other countries.
