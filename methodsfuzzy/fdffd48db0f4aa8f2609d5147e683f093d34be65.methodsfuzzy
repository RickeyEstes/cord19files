Male rats of Charles River strain CD (Wilmington, Mass.) were shipped at 2 mo old and were kept 4-6 wk in our animal house before being used in experiments. Animals were fed a standard rat chow (Purina Co. No. 5001) ad libitum, and weighed between 300 and 350 g at time of GASTROENTEROLOGY Vol. 79, No. 3 study. Fed rats were killed by decapitation at 9:OO AM, and a 5 X 5-mm segment of jejunum was sectioned within a cryostat at -18% as previously described.' Horizontal sections were cut 10 pm thick (No. 5 setting on IEC microtome, Needham Hts., Mass.). At various depths into the villus-crypt unit, a section was attached to the microscope slide for immediate inspection of histology under a phase-contrast microscope. The tissue blocks were sectioned through the submucosa to the proximal muscular layer. Commencing with counting of sections, every six consecutive sections were combined and homogenized in 0.5 cm3 distilled water by vortex shaking and sonification x 30 set (Sonifier Cell Disrupter, model V185, Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc., Plainview, N.J.). Assays of lactase and sucrase activities were performed on each homogenate according to the method of Dahlqvist.23 The lactase assay mixture contained p-chloromercuriobenzoate (PCMB) (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.) in order to inhibit any residual lysosomal acid /3-galactosidase activity." All enzyme determinations were made under conditions of linear activity with time and concentration of the enzyme. Protein was determined according to the method of Lowry et a1.25 All chemicals used were of reagent grade. Three possible problems associated with the lactase assay were investigated (data not shown): (a) To test for the presence of an inhibitor of the glucose oxidase reaction, homogenates obtained from different heights of the villuscrypt unit were boiled and the same protein concentration as used in the enzyme assays were added to the glucose standards.ZB The resulting curves showed no significant inhibition. (b) The possibility of an inhibitor of enzyme activity in lower sections of the villus crypt was studied by combining homogenates of equal protein concentration from apical villus and lower villus-mixed crypt sections. The resulting activity for both lactase and sucrase approximated the arithmetic mean activity calculated to result from such a mixing. (c) The dependence of lactase activity on pH was determined in homogenates from apical, mid-, and lower villus-mixed villus-crypt areas of the villuscrypt unit. The pH optimum for lactase activity at all heights was between 5.0 and 6.0. In the presence of PCMB, all activity at pH 3.5 was abolished. Since the pH optimum of acid /3-galactosidase is 3.5, this verifies that in homogenates of cryostat sections, PCMB totally inhibits the acid /%galactosidase activity as has also been shown in whole intestinal homogenates, and partially purified fractions of this lysosomal enzyme.Z4*2'~28
