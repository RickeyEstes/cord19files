2.1. Database search and sequence analysis 2.1.1. Cysteine-rich proteinases Sequences of cysteine-containing proteases were retrieved from the public 3D structural databases (Berman et al., 2000) using combinations of sequence, and conserved motif searches to choose identifiable categories. All of the selected proteins employed in this study were characterized by X-ray crystallography with 3.5 Å or better resolution. Membrane proteins are known to be complicated targets for structure determination and were excluded. Therefore, according to their environmental differences, a total of 21 cysteine-rich proteins were randomly collected. This further resulted in a sample of 15 distinct types of non-membrane proteins. The PDB codes and the corresponding protein names for each are listed in Table 1 . Moreover, based on the literature data available for each, the 15 non-membrane proteins were classified according to common functions into nine different categories. These included cysteine proteases, phosphatases, metabolic enzymes, kinases, interleukins, transcription factors, motility, virus capsid proteins, and ribosomes. All sequence data were downloaded, and PERL scripts (www.perl.org) were used to count the cysteines and the counts (length) were reported. Several methodical approaches have been proposed for such a study. They include analysis of amino acid characteristics of spatial neighbors to the target residue (free cysteine, Cys_SH) which is measured within a 3.7 Å radius sphere with the sulfur atom of the cysteine residue as the center point, analysis of the hydrophobicity distribution around the target residue (free cysteine, Cys_SH), and structure-based threading. When choosing the sphere radius of 3.7 Å , we took into account that spheres should, cover as much of the space between the atoms as possible but, then again, we would not want the spheres to overlap too strongly. The secondary structure classes from the HSSP (Dodge et al., 1998) files were grouped in the following ways: helices were defined by the class G, I and H, strands by B and E, turns by T and bends by S (Kabsch and Sander, 1983) . Geometric alignments and backbone superposition processes of two protein structures were made using the log procedure of program O (Jones et al., 1991) .
