virus. CIV was grown in late instar Galleria me&m&la larvae. Larvae were infected by intrahemocoelic inoculation of a sterile suspension of CIV. Twelve days later, larvae were sacrificed and the virus was extracted and purified as described by Kelly and Tinsley (1972) . CERUTTI AND DEVAUCHELLE SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. One-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis was carried out using the Laemmli (1970) discontinuous buffer system. Samples were treated with lysis buffer containing either 2% SDS, 5% fi-mercaptoethanol (SDS+ ME lysis buffer) or 2% SDS alone (SDSlysis buffer). Samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed on a 8-16% linear polyacrylamide gradient gel. The gels were run at 150 V for approximately 4 hr, and stained with Coomassie blue R-250. For two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, samples were treated with SDS-lysis buffer. They were boiled for 5 min and analyzed in the first dimension on 8-16% linear polyacrylamide gradient gel rods (14 cm). After electrophoresis the gel rods were incubated for 1 hr in 0.05 M Tris-hydrochloride, pH 6.8, 15% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% /3-mercaptoethanol, and layered on a 8-16% linear gradient slab gel ( and were incubated at 37". Four hours later, the reaction was stopped in batches 1 and 2 by the addition of P-mercaptoethanol (final concentration 5%). Batch 3 was boiled for 5 min prior to the addition of p-mercaptoethanol. The three-labeled viral extracts were treated with SDS-B-ME lysis buffer and analyzed by one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One sample from batch 3 was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Slab gels were stained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography using Fuji X-ray films. Surface lubeling of CIVparticles. Surface viral polypeptides were labeled with lz51 using an iodosulfanilic acid-labeling kit (New England Nuclear). Prior to coupling with proteins, ['251]iodosulfanilic acid was converted to the diazonium salt by addition of 5 ~1 of 0.05 M NaNOa and 5 ~1 of 0.1 M HCl. Five minutes later, the reaction mixture was neutralized by the addition of 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The purified viral suspension was distributed into two identical batches. Batch 1 consisted of 2 ml of viral suspension treated for 3 hr with SDS (final concentration 2%). Batch 2 consisted of 2 ml of native CIV. Twenty-five microliters of the neutralized diazonium salt were added to batches 1 and 2 and the reaction mixtures were gently stirred in an ice bath. Fifteen minutes later, unreacted diazonium salt was discarded from the native viral suspension (batch 2) by sedimenting the virus through a 20-40% (w/v) sucrose gradient. The sample was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a Beckman SW27 rotor for 30 min. Purified labeled viral suspension was then pelleted at 14,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor for 1 hr. The pelleted virus was resuspended in SDS-lysis buffer. The labeled viral suspension of batch 1 was directly mixed with SDS-lysis buffer. Both viral preparations were analyzed by twodimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Slab gels were stained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. DMSO treatment of viral particles. A purified viral suspension was pelleted at 15,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor for 30 min and resuspended in 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCI, 0.7 mM NazHP04, 5 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.05, DMSO 10%. After standing overnight at 4', the viral suspension was layered on 10% sucrose and centrifuged at 36,000 rpm in a Beckman T40 rotor for 90 min. The supernatant was extensively dialyzed at 4' against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl. Detection of DNA-binding proteins. DNA-binding activity of CIV structural polypeptides was detected by the method reported by Bowen et al. (1980) . Viral polypeptides were electrophoreses in oneor two-dimensional polyacrylamide gradient gel slabs, and the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose sheets (Schleicher and Schiill BA85, 0.45 pm). The blots were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature in 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-hydrochloride, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.02% Ficoll 400, and 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone 360. The blots were then incubated at 37" with s2P-labeled viral DNA at a concentration of 5 pg/ml (lo4 cpm/ml). After 6 hr incubation, blots were rinsed four times with 2~ SSC for 30 min at room temperature, dried, and autoradiographed. CIV viral DNA was isolated from 32Plabeled virus by treatment with pronase (500 pg/ml) in the presence of 1% SDS, followed by extraction with phenol-chloroform. Purified viral DNA was used without heat denaturation.
