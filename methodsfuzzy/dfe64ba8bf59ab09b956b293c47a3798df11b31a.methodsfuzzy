All fecal specimens in this study were collected from hospitalized pediatric patients with gastroenteritis (age <18 years old) from two acute regional hospitals in Hong Kong from December 2004 to February 2005. Gastroenteritis was defined as the development of acute diarrhea with three or more loose stools per day. All fecal samples were tested for common bacterial diarrheal pathogens, rotavirus and HBoV as described previously. 16 The clinical features, laboratory results and outcome of patients positive for picornaviruses were analyzed retrospectively.
