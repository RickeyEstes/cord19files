Virus and cells DBT cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). L2 cells were maintained at 37°C and 3% CO 2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. Baby hamster kidney-21 cells expressing the MHV receptor (BHK-R cells) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, 3% tryptose phosphate broth, and G418 (800 μg ml − 1 ) to select for cells expressing the MHV receptor. MHV-A59 1000 was used as a WT control virus for comparison with chimeric viruses. Assembly of a full-length MHV-A59 infectious construct The reverse genetic system for MHV-A59 has been described. 40 cDNAs representing the entire MHV-A59 genome with either the WT sequence or the MHV SL1 mutant sequences were constructed by ligation of the A fragments to fragments B-G, transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase, and electroporated into cells as described previously. 19, 20 Cultures were observed for up to 72 h for the development of cytopathic effect and harvested by freezing at − 70°C. Cultures that did not develop cytopathic effect were blind passed three times through DBT cells in a further attempt to recover infectious virus. At least three independent experiments, including at least one experiment in which electroporated cells were incubated at 34°C and 40°C, were performed before a mutant genome was considered nonviable.
