The traditional methods for detecting and identifying pathogens require culturing of bacteria or viruses and detecting them using phenotypic, biochemical, or serological tests. These methods have proven very successful for many types of microorganisms and are standardized for most of the known human and domesticated animal pathogens. However, one important limitation is that only a small fraction of the estimated number of microbial species have been described, and so are applicable to relatively a few species. Many microorganisms are very difficult to culture or may not grow at all and therefore they cannot be identified using traditional techniques. As many as 99% of all microbial species are estimated to fall into this category. This is particularly problematic when unknown diseases wreak havoc in human and animal populations. 5
