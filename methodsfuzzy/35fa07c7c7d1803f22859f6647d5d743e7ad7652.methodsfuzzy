Antiparasitic drugs historically have been discovered by experimental screening against intact parasites, but due to the enormity of the task and availability of better computational facilities there has been a shift towards computational screening. Computational screening (also known as virtual screening) has inherent advantage over traditional and even experimental high throughput screening (HTS) due to its massive parallel processing ability; millions of compounds per week can be tested. Virtual screening (VS) has been widely used to discover new leads by computationally identifying compounds with higher probability of strong binding affinity to the target protein. Successful studies have led to the identification of molecules either resembling the native ligands of a particular target or novel compounds [20, 21] . VS methods can be classified into structure-based and ligand-based approaches based on the amount of structural and bioactivity data available. If the 3D structure of the receptor is known, a structure-based VS methods that can be used is high-throughput docking [22] but where the information on the receptor is scant, ligand-based methods [23] like similarity searching and machine learning techniques are commonly used. Docking involves a complex optimization task of finding the most favourable 3D binding conformation of the ligand to the receptor molecule. Being computationally intensive, docking is not suitable for very large virtual screening experiments. On the other hand, ligand-based methods are popular because they are computationally inexpensive and easy to use. Furthermore, the assumption that structurally similar molecules exhibit similar biological activity than dissimilar or less similar molecules is generally valid. Thus, ligand-based methods are increasingly playing an important role at the beginning of the drug discovery projects especially where little 3D information is available for the receptor. Particularly interesting are machine learning based approaches such as neural networks, genetic algorithms and support vector machines (SVM). SVM is a powerful classification technique that has found numerous applications in chemistry such as drug design, quantitative structure property prediction and chemical data mining. Many studies in the past have shown SVM to be one of the best methods for correctly classifying molecules [24] [25] [26] . Zernov et al. [24] used SVM and neural networks to predict the drug-likeness and agrochemical-likeness for large compound collections. They showed that for both kinds of data, SVM outperformed all neural networks under the same training conditions. Warmuth et al. [25] investigated a large collection of compounds to find those that bind to the target of interest in as few iterations of biochemical testing as possible. The authors compared various search strategies including maximum margin hyperplane, generated by SVM. They concluded that the strategies based on SVM clearly outperform the simpler ones. Similarly, Burbidge et al. [26] carried out a comparative study that involved prediction of the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by pyrimidines, using SVM, ANN and decision trees. They found that SVM outperformed the other methods, except in a manually capacity-controlled ANN, which required significantly longer training time. Nonetheless, ligand-based VS still remains an unproven approach in the discovery of antiparasitic medicines [27] . In this investigation, we have developed an in silico classification model using SVM to predict potential anthelmintic leads targeted towards parasitic nematodes. Our model has an estimated accuracy of~82.0% for the test dataset. We have applied this model to a large public database to predict novel anthelmintic compounds and identified a set of 45 compounds, of which six are promising as potential therapeutic agents.
