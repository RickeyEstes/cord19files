On 2 May 2018, a literature search on PubMed was performed, using the terms 'middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus' and 'MERS-CoV'. Using the term 'MERS' did not result in any additional articles that fit the scope of this review. Only articles published in English were included. Two reviewers individually selected all original research articles containing laboratory evidence of MERS-CoV infections in dromedary camels in the field. Articles that were mentioned in Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) updates [10] or in the references of included publications, but did not appear in the PubMed search were added. Subsequently, abstracts, follow-up studies of MERS-CoV-positive camels and genome studies without prevalence data were excluded from the analysis. Data on variables such as year of sampling, country, region, age, sex and animal origin were extracted and analysed. For each variable, the number of positive camels, total number of camels tested and the median percentage positivity was calculated. Data from experimental infection studies were not included in this analysis, but they were included in the review to provide additional information and context to the field studies. Additional information on the distribution and trade of dromedary camels was collected from references in the publications on MERS-CoV in camels and extracted from official FAO and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) databases [11, 12] . The additional literature on camel trade was collected in a less systematic way from PubMed.
