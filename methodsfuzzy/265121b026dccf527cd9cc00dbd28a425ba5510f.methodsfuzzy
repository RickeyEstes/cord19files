A prospective transversal study was carried out with previously-healthy infants aged 0-6 month(s), with a clinical diagnosis of acute viral bronchiolitis and first episode of wheezing, who were admitted to the emergency ward or to intensive care paediatric units, in a tertiary public hospital-Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA)-in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in Southern Brazil. The Ethics and Research Committee of this institution approved the study, which was carried out during April 2004-April 2005. Infants were selected when they arrived at the hospital and were diagnosed by the on-duty emergency paediatrician as having acute viral bronchiolitis based on the symptoms, such as respiratory distress, tachypnea, wheezing, or crackles in pulmonary auscultation, and coughing with a history of upper airway infection with signs and symptoms no longer than seven days. Prematurely-born (<37 weeks) or low-birthweight (<2,500 g) infants, those with congenital malformations, inborn errors of metabolism, heart, neurological or liver disease, other chronic or intercurrent respiratory diseases, immunodepression, HIV-positive mother, and diseases that could influence the nutritional status (pathologic gastroesophageal reflux, acute gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, or others) were excluded. Although malnutrition could be considered a chronic disease, it was not listed as a criterion for exclusion since, as we will present later on, this was one of the study factors. Nasal aspirate from the nasopharynx was collected to detect virus by the indirect immunofluorescence test as part of the paediatric emergency routine care of HCPA. The viruses tested were respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, influenza, and adenovirus. The paediatricians were not blind to any data, and the researchers did not influence the management of patients. If the infant met the inclusion criteria and the parents signed the consent term, a form was filled in with clinical evaluation and with data from the patient records. Data on type of breastfeeding, duration of exclusive breastfeeding, exposure to a smoking mother or passive smoking, i.e. smoking people living in the same home, and socioeconomic situation of the infant's family were collected through a structured interview at admission with parents. Immediately after the infants were weighed and measured by a clinical dietitian and three trained nutrition students, a research nutritionist checked the assessments. Weight of the infant was measured without clothes on, using a Urano ® electronic scale that stands a maximum weight of 15 kg and 5 g precision. The measurement of length was done from the top of the head to the heels with the child lying on a wood slab with a fixed piece on one side and a moveable one on the other (top of head on the fixed part). Data were processed using the Epi Info™ software (version 6.0) (Atlanta, Georgia) that uses the standards from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as a reference and calculates mean deviations, percentiles, and z-scores for the ratio lengthfor-age, weight-for-length, and weight-for-age (12) . For classifying the nutritional status of infants, we compared measurements of length-for-age and weight-for-length with the NCHS standard reference. Undernourishment was defined based on the z-score for length-for-age and weight-for-length below -2.00 (<3 rd percentile). For obesity, we used the weight-for-length ratio above +2.00 (>97 th percentile) according to the criteria recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) (13, 14) . For classification of nutritional risk, we considered the z-score levels to be ≤-1.28 (<10 th percentile) for weight-for-length, and for overweight a z-score of ≥+1.28 (>90 th percentile) for weight-for-length, as recommended by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (15) . The use of the 10 th percentile was also adopted for weight-for-age in the classification of the nutritional risk (16) . The infants who presented a z-score on the limit between -1.27 and +1.27 for weight-for-length were considered well-nourished. In the classification of nutritional status, where more than one of the anthropometrical ratios was used (length-for-age, weight-for-age, weight-for-length) and a discrepancy existed between the levels used, the lowest one was considered. In the classification of types of breastfeeding, the categories defined by WHO were adopted (17): Exclusive breastfeeding was considered when the infant received only maternal milk, either directly from the breast or extracted and no other liquid or solid, with the exception of drops or syrups of vitamins, minerals, and/or medicine. Predominant breastfeeding referred to when the infant received together with maternal milk water or water-based drinks, such as fruit juices and tea. The classification of breastfeeding was given when the infant received maternal milk, directly from the breast or extracted, independently of receiving other foods or liquids, including non-human milk. Artificial feeding was considered when the infant was no longer breastfed but received cow's milk-in natural or powdered-and formula feeding for the first semester along with other liquids and solids. All the infants were monitored until discharge to obtain data with regard to the length of oxygenuse and hospital stay. Clinical data were confirmed by a cross-check with the electronic records after discharge from the hospital. Infants who stayed in the hospital for more than 14 days were excluded. At the HCPA, the usual criteria for withdrawal of oxygen is the absence of respiratory distress and haemoglobin saturation of >94% in room air. This decision, and that of discharging the patients, was taken by the paediatrician-in-charge. The clinical evolution of infants with acute viral bronchiolitis was also evaluated according to the more complex hospital unit needed. For such classification, paediatric emergency care was considered as of least complexity where the infants were usually admitted for observation and the intensive care unit as the most complex one. The paediatric ward, in this context, was considered intermediate complexity between the other two.
