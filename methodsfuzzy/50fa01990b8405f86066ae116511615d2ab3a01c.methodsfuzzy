Epidemic threshold mean-field prediction Phase transition generation function Self-organization percolation theory Pattern formation stochastic processes Bifurcation and stability analysis Monte Carlo simulation Vaccination/immunization threshold Markov-chain approximation networks are positively assortative with vaccination behavior. That is to say, large-degree unvaccinated (vaccinated) agents are more likely to contact with other large-degree unvaccinated (vaccinated) ones, which certainly results in a larger outbreak than common networks since these (positively assortative) unvaccinated agents breed larger susceptible clusters. This finding highlights the importance of heterogeneity during vaccine uptake for the prevention of infectious disease once again. In fact, the currently growing available human generated data and computing power have driven the fast emergence of various social, technological and biological networks [145] [146] [147] [148] . Upon these empirically networks, mass diseasebehavior models can be considered to analyze the efficiency of existing or novel proposed prevention measures and provide constructive viewpoint for policy makers of public health [149] [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] .
