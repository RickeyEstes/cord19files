Cell lines. AK-D cells, which are immortalized cells derived from feline lung tissue, were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (ATCC® CCL-150 TM ) and maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco, #12100-046) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Atlanta Biologicals, #S11150), supplemented with 2.2 g/L of sodium bicarbonate (Sigma, #S5761), 1% non-essential amino acids (HyClone, #SH30238.01), 1% HEPES (HyClone, #SH30237.01), 1% sodium pyruvate (Corning, #25-000-CI), 1% Lglutamine (HyClone, #SH30034.01), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Corning, #30-002-CI). AK-D 2.2 cells were also maintained in this medium. Felis catus whole fetus cells were provided by Dr. Edward J. Dubovi, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, Ithaca, NY, and designated Fcwf-4 CU. Fcwf-4 CU cells were maintained in Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium (EMEM) (Sigma, #M0268) containing 10% FBS, supplemented with 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% HEPES, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Fcwf-4 2.2 Poly and Fcwf-4 IRN cells were also maintained in this medium. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T/ 17 cells (ATCC® CRL-11268 TM ) were maintained in DMEM (Corning, #10-017-CV) containing 10% FBS, supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% HEPES, 1% L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For passaging, confluent cell monolayers were rinsed with PBS, lifted by addition of 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin (Gibco, #15090-046) in versene solution (0.48 mM EDTA in PBS) then transferred (split 1:5 or 1:10) to a new T-75 flask in complete media every 2-3 days. Viruses. Serotype I feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) Black (TN-406) was kindly provided by Dr. Fred Scott, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, Ithaca, NY. FIPV Black was propagated in Fcwf-4 CU cells and recovered from supernatants for stock virus preparation. Briefly, sub-confluent T-75 flasks of Fcwf-4 CU cells were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of one for 1 h in 2 mL serum-free media at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Infectious media was replaced with 10 mL EMEM containing 2% FBS, and the monolayer was incubated at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . After 24 h, supernatants were collected and clarified by centrifuging at 1000 xg for 10 min at 4°C. Virus-containing cell-free supernatants were then aliquoted (100-300 μL) and stored at −80°C. Titers of stock virus were determined by plaque assay on AK-D or Fcwf-4 CU cells. Generation of IFNαR2-disrupted AK-D and Fcwf-4 CU cell populations. A modified Crispr/Cas9 protocol, based on the GeCKO system (Shalem et al., 2014) was used to knock-out the function of the type I IFN alpha receptor 2 (IFNαR2) in AK-D and Fcwf-4 CU cells. Briefly, single-guide (sg) RNA sequences were identified using Benchling (Benchling, INC.) to target the second exon (felis_catus_6.2; range = cgrC2: 11959183-11979720) of the feline ifnar2 gene (Accession NM_001278859.1). Complementary DNA versions of the sgRNAs (Fwd 5′-CAC CGT GTG TAT CGG CCT CAT GGT-3'; Rev 5′-AAA CAC CAT GAG GCC GAT ACA CAC-3′) were annealed and inserted into a pLentiCRISPRv2-puro (Addgene #52961) cassette between flaking BsmBI sites. To generate transducing particles (TPs), IFNαR2-specific or empty vector (EV), plasmid DNAs pLentiCRISPRv2-puro, pPax2 and pHEF-VSV-G plasmids were co-transfected into HEK-293T/17 cells using polyethylenimine in antibiotic-free DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h, followed by replacement with complete DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 48 h, supernatant containing TPs was centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min at 4°C and filtered through a 0.45 μM filter (Millipore Sigma). TPs were applied to sub-confluent monolayers of parental AK-D or Fcwf-4 CU cells for 48 h followed by selection in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 25 μg/mL puromycin (InvivoGen) for 96 h. Puromycin-selected cells were grown and passaged as polyclonal populations designated AK-D 2.2 and Fcwf-4 2.2 Poly, respectively. Clonal expansion and IFNαR2 sequencing of Fcwf-4 IRN cells. A clone of the Fcwf-4 2.2 Poly cells, confirmed for reduction in responsiveness to type I IFN, was isolated and designated Fcwf-4 IRN (Interferon alpha Receptor Null). Briefly, > 10,000 Fcwf-4 2.2 Poly cells were sorted using a FACS Aria Cell Sorter (BD) into a 96-well plate at 1 cell/well. Clones were expanded into 24-then 6-well plates in EMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 μg/mL puromycin. Clones permissive to FIPV Black infection were evaluated for IFN responsiveness. The Fcwf-4 IRN cell line was isolated in this manner and confirmed to be both permissive to FIPV Black infection and have low IFN-responsiveness. The sequence of the IFNαR mRNA expressed in the Fcwf-4 IRN cell line was determined by sequencing 15 PCR clones of the region. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from Fcwf-4 CU or IRN cell monolayers and cDNA was generated with random hexamer primers via the RevertAID First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher). The full IFNαR mRNA sequence was PCR amplified from cDNA then inserted into TA cloning pCR-XL-TOPO® plasmids using the TOPO® XL PCR Cloning Kit (Life Technologies). Plasmids for each cell type were then purified by MiniPrep (Promega) and 15 from each cell type were sequenced. Consensus sequences were compared using Clone Manager 9 (Sci-Ed Software). IFNα stimulation and detection of ISG54 gene transcripts by quantitative real-time PCR. Indicated feline cells were stimulated with purified feline IFNα (PBL Assay Science #15100-1) then assayed for the level of IFN stimulated gene 54 (ISG54) produced. Briefly, cells were plated in a 24-well plate (Corning) at 1.5 -3.0 × 10 5 cells/well in 0.5 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Cells were treated with media (mock) or purified feline IFNα at 10, 100, or 1000 U/mL for 6 h. Cell were lysed in 350 μL RLT buffer and total RNA was purified using a RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Using 1 μg purified total RNA, cDNA was generated via the RT 2 First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Qiagen). qPCR was performed to determine abundance of feline β-actin (Fwd 5′-CAA CCG TGA GAA GAT GAC TCA GA-3'; Rev 5′-CCC AGA GTC CAT GAC AAT ACC A-3′) (Kessler et al., 2009) and feline ISG54 (Fwd 5′-CCT GAG CTG CAG CCT TTC AGA ACA G-3'; Rev 5′-CAC GTG AAA TGG CAT TTA AGT TGC CGC AG -3′) RNAs. ISG54 Ct values were normalized to β-actin and presented as average 2 −ΔCT [ΔC T = C T (gene of interest) −C T (β-actin) ] expression values or fold expression over mock. Determining IFNαR2 expression and amplicon melt temperature. Expression and amplicon melt temperature of feline ifnar gene exons 1-4 were determined by qPCR. Briefly, confluent monolayers of Fcwf-4 CU and Fcwf-4 IRN cells were grown overnight in EMEM containing 10% FBS, lysed in RLT (Qiagen) and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). Equivalent amounts of RNA were used to generate cDNA using RevertAID cDNA synthesis kit (ThermoFisher). Feline β-actin (see above) and IFNαR2 exon 1-4 (Fwd 5′-AAG ATG CTT TGG AGC CAG AAT A-3'; Rev 5′-CCA GGA AGA AAT CGC TGA TAC A-3′) transcript levels were determined by qPCR using Sybr Green Master Mix (Qiagen). qPCRs were performed in a CFX96 thermocycler (Bio-Rad) using the following settings: 95°C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 58°C for 1 min and SYBR read; 95°C for 10 s; melt curve from 65°C to 95°C at 0.5°C/0.5 s. For qPCR, samples were evaluated in triplicate and data represent three independent experiments. The levels of mRNA were normalized to β-actin mRNA and presented as average 2 −ΔCT [ΔC T = C T (gene of interest) −C T (β-actin) ] expression values. Melt temperatures were determined by plotting the change in fluorescence with temperature [-d(RFU)/dT] versus temperature ( o C) then calculating the point at which the largest change in fluorescence occurs (Krenke et al., 2005) . Plaque assay. The plaque assay technique was performed using AK-D, AK-D 2.2. Fcwf-4 CU, and IRN as indicator cells. Briefly, 6.5 × 10 5 cells per well were plated in 6-well plates or 3.0 × 10 5 cells per well were plated in 12-well plates. Cells were washed with PBS, then infected with 300 μL (6-well plate) or 150 μL (12-well plate) of 10fold serial dilutions of viral samples in FBS-free media for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were overlaid with a 0.5% Oxoid agar (Oxoid LTD, #LP0028)-DMEM containing 1% FBS. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h (or the indicated time) and fixed using 3.7% formaldehyde-PBS solution for 30 min. Viral plaques were visualized by staining with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min. To quantify the plaque size, 10 isolated plaques from FIPV-infected CU cells and 10 isolated plaques from FIPV-infected IRN cells were measured using Adobe Photoshop software. The cleared area of the plaque was calculated in square millimeters. Virus growth kinetics. We analyzed the growth kinetics of type I FIPV Black in five cell types: AK-D, AK-D 2.2, Fcwf-4 CU, Fcwf-4 2.2 Poly and Fcwf-4 IRN cells. For all cell types, 3.0 × 10 5 cells were plated in 12-well plates for 24 h. Cells were infected with FIPV Black in serumfree media at a MOI of 0.1 at 37°C. After a 1 h, infectious media was replaced with media containing 2% FBS. Cell supernatants were collected from cultures at the times indicated and centrifuged at 2200 x g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cells and cell debris, then aliquoted and frozen at −80°C until use. Virus titers at each timepoint were determined by plaque assay, in triplicate, using either AK-D or Fcwf-4 CU indicator cells. Virus growth kinetics in cells pre-treated with feline IFNα. Serotype I FIPV Black virus growth kinetics were evaluated in feline cells pre-treated with IFNα. Briefly, Fcwf-4 CU and Fcwf-4 IRN cells were plated in 24-well plates at 3.0 × 10 5 cells/well for 24 h, then treated with 0 or 1000 U feline IFNα (PBL Assay Science #15100-1) for 8 h. Cells were infected (as above) with FIPV Black in serum-free media at a MOI of 0.01 at 37°C for 1 h and cultured in EMEM containing 2% FBS. Cell supernatants collected from cultures at indicated times were centrifuged at 2200 x g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cells and debris. Virus titers were determined at each timepoint by plaque assay, in triplicate, using Fcwf-4 CU indicator cells. Cloning and expression of feline TMPRSS2 in Fcwf-4 IRN cells. A dsDNA gBlocks® (IDT) fragment containing the coding sequence of feline TMPRSS2 variant 1 (GenBank accession # XM_023238709.1) was designed with several modifications for cloning into the pLVX-Puro vector. A Kozak consensus sequence was added to the 5′ end, while the 3′ end contains a 3 nt spacer sequence followed by an in-frame V5 tag coding region. The plasmid carrying this sequence was termed pLVX-fTMPRSS2(V5)-puroR + . Transducing particles (TPs) carrying the pLVX-fTMPRSS2(V5)-puroR + plasmids were generated by transfecting 3.3 μg each of pLVX-fTMPRSS2(V5)-puroR + , psPax2, and pHEF-VSV-G plasmid DNAs into 10 cm dishes containing 5.0 × 10 6 HEK-293T/ 17 cells using polyethylenimine (PEI) (5 μg PEI/1 μg DNA) in antibioticfree DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h followed by replacement with DMEM containing 10% FBS with antibiotics. After 48 h, supernatants containing TPs were collected and stored at 4°C and cells were replenished with 10 mL DMEM containing 5% FBS with antibiotics. After an additional 24-h incubation (72 h total) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 , supernatants were collected and combined with the previously collected lot. Total supernatants were centrifuged 1000 xg at 4°C for 10 min to remove cell debris, then centrifuged for 16 h at 5000 x g and 4°C. To concentrate, supernatants were poured off and pellets were suspended in one tenth the original volume using EMEM. For expression of feline TMPRSS2(V5), transducing particles were diluted 1:5 in serum-free EMEM and a minimal volume was incubated with Fcwf-4 IRN cells for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO 2 followed by addition of EMEM containing 6.25% FBS. After 48 h, cells were lysed in either lysis buffer A (4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 3% dithiothreitol, 40% glycerol, and 0.065 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8) for evaluation of TMPRSS2(V5) by Western blot or lysed in RLT buffer (Qiagen) for evaluation of TMPRSS2 mRNA levels by qPCR. For Western blot, lysates were sonicated, and 5.0 × 10 4 cellequivalents were separated through 7-15% acrylamide Mini-PROTEAN® TGX™ precast SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) then transferred to PVDF membranes using a semi-dry Trans-Blot® Turbo™ transfer system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked at 4°C overnight in 5% milk in TBST followed by 90 min room temperature incubation in primary antibodies specific for TMPRSS2(V5) tag (murine anti-V5 monoclonal IgG; Fisher Scientific #R96025) or β-actin (murine anti-actin monoclonal IgG; Genscript #A00702-40) diluted 1:2500 and 1:5000, respectively, in 5% milk-TBST. Membranes were washed in TBST then incubation for 1 h at room temperature in horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (SouthernBiotech) secondary antibody diluted 1:5000 in 5% milk-TBST. Western Lightning® Plus-ECL (PerkinElmer, Inc.) chemiluminescent substrate was applied to washed membranes and bands were visualized on a FluorChem™ E (Protein Simple) imaging system relative to PageRuler™ Prestained protein ladder (Thermo Fisher). For detection of feline TMPRSS2 mRNA transcript levels, qPCRs were performed. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from RLT lysates using a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and 500 ng RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using RT 2 HT First-Strand Kit (Qiagen, #330401). qPCR was performed with specific primers for feline TMPRSS2 (Fwd 5′-TGT CTA CAA CAA CCT GGT CAC-3'; Rev 5′-CCA CCA GAT GTG ACT CTT CAT AG-3′) or feline β-actin transcript (see above) using RT 2 SYBR Green qPCR Mastermix (Qiagen, #330502). A Bio-Rad CFX96 thermocycler was set as follows: one step at 95°C (10 min); 40 cycles of 95°C (15 s), 58°C (1 min), and plate read; one step at 95°C (10 s); and a melt curve from 65°C to 95°C at increments of 0.5°C/0.5 s. Samples were evaluated in triplicate and data are representative of three independent experiments. Levels of mRNA were normalized to β-actin mRNA and presented as average 2 −ΔCT [ΔC T = C T
