Ethics statement. Experiments were performed in accordance with federal and kantonal guidelines under permission numbers SG07/62, SG07/ 63, 07/64, and 07/71 following review and approval by the Kantonal Veterinary Office (St. Gallen, Switzerland). Mice, cells, and viruses. C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany). A2DR1 mice were kindly supplied by F. A. Lemonnier (Pasteur Institute, Paris, France) (42) . All mice were maintained in individually ventilated cages and were used at between 6 and 9 weeks of age. L929 and CV-1 cells were purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. MC57 and BSC40 cells were obtained from R. M. Zinkernagel (University of Zürich, Switzerland). D980R cells were a kind gift from J. F. Smith (Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom). 17clone1 cells were a kind gift from S. G. Sawicki (Medical University of Ohio, Toledo, OH). Huh7 cells were a kind gift from V. Lohmann (University of Heidelberg, Germany). The LCMV WE strain was obtained from R. M. Zinkernagel (Universität Zürich, Switzerland). Recombinant vaccinia virus expressing LCMV glycoprotein 2 (VV-G2) was originally obtained from B. H. Bishop (University of Oxford, United Kingdom), and recombinant vaccinia virus expressing vesicular stomatitis virus Indiana glycoprotein (VV-INDG) was originally obtained from B. Moss (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Titration and determination of antiviral protection assays have been performed as described previously (7). Further details can be found in Text S1 in the supplemental material. Cloning and generation of recombinant MHV-based vectors and human coronaviruses. Genomic RNA of recombinant MHV-based vectors and recombinant HCoVs were produced from cloned cDNA using purified vaccinia virus DNA as the template for in vitro transcription as described previously (54) . A detailed description of all cloning steps, sequence information, and production of recombinant coronavirus particles can be found in Text S1 in the supplemental material. Isolation of dendritic cells and macrophages, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence. Generation of bone marrow-derived DCs and flow cytometric analysis were performed as described previously (50) . Further information on these procedures can be found in Text S1 in the supplemental material. For immunofluorescence analysis of viral replication, 2 ϫ 10 5 L929 cells or peritoneal macrophages were seeded in slide chambers and trans- duced with MHV-GP or MHV-GM/GP (MOI ϭ 1). At the time points indicated in Fig. 1 , the slides were acetone fixed, blocked with the Fc-blocking antibody 2.4G2, and stained with anti-EGFP Alexa 488 (BioLegend). Images were acquired using a Leica DMRA microscope and processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems). Tetramer analysis and intracellular cytokine staining. Peptidespecific CD8 ϩ T cells and ex vivo production of IFN-␥ or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-␣) were determined by tetramer staining, and intracellular cytokine staining was performed as described previously (24, 28) . Detailed information on these procedures can be found in Text S1 in the supplemental material. Melanoma model. B16F10-GP melanoma cells expressing the LCMV gp33 epitope (41) and parental B16F10 cells were kindly provided by H. Pircher (University of Freiburg, Germany). Further information on tumor protection assays can be found in Text S1 in the supplemental material. Generation of human DCs and ICS. DCs were generated from monocytes isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells as described previously (55) . Mature DCs were infected with Mel-A/EGFP-recombinant HCoV-229E or GP-EGFP-recombinant HCoV-229E and incubated with Mel-A-specific T cell clones as responder cells. Further details on in vitro human CD8 ϩ T cell activation by transduced human DCs can be found in Text S1 in the supplemental material. Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Data were analyzed with the nonpaired Student t test under the assumption that the values followed a Gaussian distribution. A P value of Ͻ0.05 was considered significant.
