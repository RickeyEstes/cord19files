Oligoribonucleotide Preparation and NMR Spectroscopy. To further explore the dispersion of resonances for GU pairs, whose chemical shifts are underrepresented in the literature compared to AU and GC pairs, NOESY and TOCSY spectra were measured for the following sequences to determine GH1, UH3, UH5, and AH2 chemical shifts: r(AGGCUU) 2 , r(AGUCGAUU) 2 , r(CUGGCUAG) 2 , r(CAG-UCGAUUG) 2 , r(CCGAAUUUGG) 2 , r(CGGAAUUUCG) 2 , r(CGGAUAUUCG) 2 , r(CGUGAUUACG) 2 , r(CUGGAUU-CAG) 2 , r(GAGAGCUUUC) 2 , r(GAGGAUCUUC) 2 , and r(GUGAAUUUAC) 2 . Imino proton 1D spectra for these sequences have been published. 50 All oligoribonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., except for r(GUGAAUUUAC) 2 , which was synthesized by M. Serra (Allegheny College, Meadville, PA) using standard phosphoramidite chemistry. Oligoribonucleotides were dissolved in 300 μL of 80 mM NaCl, 18.8 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 1.16 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 0.02 mM EDTA at pH 6.0. To provide a lock signal, 15 μL of D 2 O was then added. NMR spectra were acquired with a Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer. A 35 ms mixing time was used for 2D TOCSY spectra, and 100 and 400 ms mixing times were used for 2D 1 H− 1 H NOESY spectra. For 2D spectra, water signals were suppressed with a WATERGATE-style pulse with flipback. 51, 52 2D spectra were processed with NMRPipe 53 and resonances assigned with SPARKY. 54 Proton chemical shifts were referenced to a temperaturedependent water shift (eq 1), where T is temperature in kelvin measured at pH 5.5. 55 2,2-Dimethylsilapentate-5-sulfonic acid was used as an external reference standard for water. A predicted pair, i to j, was considered correct if the accepted structure contained a pair from i to j, i ± 1 to j, or i to j ± 1. This accounts for the fact that comparative analysis cannot always resolve the exact pairing and that pairs can be dynamic. 19 RNA Preparation and NMR Spectroscopy. A plasmid construct containing the sequence for human accelerated region 1 (HAR1) used by Beniaminov et al. 9 was provided by A. Krol of the Institut de Biologie Molećulaire et Cellulaire. The plasmid was amplified in and purified from Escherichia coli competent cells using standard plasmid preparation protocols. The purified plasmid was linearized overnight by SmaI restriction endonuclease (New England BioLabs) at 25°C. RNA was transcribed from the linearized plasmid with T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kits (New England BioLabs), with 1 μg of plasmid per 20 μL reaction mixture. After transcription mixtures had been incubated for 12 h at 37°C, 5 μL of 100 mM EDTA was added to stop reactions. A sample with 15 N-and 13 C-labeled rGTP and rUTP (Sigma-Aldrich) was synthesized with a similar protocol. HAR1 samples were purified with FPLC. 56 FPLC fractions were concentrated and exchanged into NMR buffer with Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units (EMD Millipore). NMR buffer consisted of 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaH 2 PO 4 / NaHPO 4 , and 0.05 mM Na 2 EDTA (pH 6.25). Each sample was placed in a susceptibility-matched Shigemi NMR A pUC19 plasmid containing an insert for a 75 nt sequence for the Bombyx mori R2 retrotransposon pseudoknot was constructed and amplified with standard plasmid purification protocols (see the Supporting Information for the plasmid construct). This construct differs from the 74 nt construct previously studied with NMR 39 by addition of the wild-type 3′ terminal C. The plasmid was linearized with NheI restriction endonuclease at 37°C prior to in vitro transcription. Unlabeled and 13 C-and 15 N-labeled rGTP and rUTP samples were transcribed, purified with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and extracted from gels with electroelution. Purified RNAs were exchanged into NMR buffer (see ref 39) , concentrated with centrifugal filter units, and added to a Shigemi NMR tube. D 2 O was added to provide a lock signal. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 600 MHz NMR spectrometer. NOESY spectra were acquired for the unlabeled HAR1 sample with mixing times of 125 and 250 ms at 25°C and 60 ms at 15°C. A 15 N− 1 H HSQC spectrum was acquired for the labeled HAR1 sample at 25°C. Relevant acquisition parameters are listed in Table S1 . NOESY spectra were acquired for the unlabeled 75 nt B. mori R2 retrotransposon pseudoknot with a mixing time of 200 ms at 25°C. A 15 N− 1 H HSQC spectrum was acquired for the labeled B. mori R2 retrotransposon pseudoknot sample at 25°C.
