SP-4, SP-8, and SP-10 blocked the ACE2 and S protein interaction in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3) . The IC 50 values of SP-4, SP-8, and SP-10 were 4.3 ± 2.18, 6.99 ± 0.71, and 1.88 ± 0.52 nmol, respectively. SP-11 and SP-12 were excluded because they bound not only S protein but also BSA (data not shown). To further identify the biologically active peptides, the peptide-scanning method that involved synthesizing overlapping peptides of 12 residues covering additional amino acids on both the amino and carboxy ends of SP-10 was used. The inhibitory potential of small overlapping peptides on the SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2 interaction was analyzed by competitive biotinylated ELISA. SP-10-2 (residues 660-671), SP-10-3 (residues 664-675), SP-10-4 (residues 672-683) had inhibitory activities, with the IC 50 values of 6.21 ± 2.13, 5.47 ± 0.41, and 2.07 ± 1.01 nmol, respectively (Table 2) . However, SP-10-1 (residues 648-659) and SP-10-5 (residues 676-687) did not block the ACE2 and S protein interaction. These findings suggested that the region spanning residues 660-683 of SARS-CoV S protein may interact with ACE2. Fig. 2 . Inhibitory effects of peptides on the SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2 interaction by competitive biotinylated ELISA. Biotin-labeled S protein (1 nmol) was mixed with 10 nmol of synthetic peptides or BSA and incubated at 37 • C with shaking. After a 2-h incubation, the mixtures were added to wells, which were coated with 1 ng of ACE2 and incubated at 37 • C for 1 h. Following three washes, peroxidase-conjugated avidin and chromatic substrate were sequentially added. The absorbance was read at 405 nm in an ELISA plate reader. The results are expressed as inhibition described in Section 2. Values are mean ± standard error of six independent assays. ** p < 0.01, compared with BSA.
