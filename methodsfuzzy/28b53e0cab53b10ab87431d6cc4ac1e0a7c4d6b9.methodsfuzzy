A descriptive analysis was performed. We used a generalized additive model (GAM) to analyze the associations between meteorological factors (temperature, DTR, relative humidity and absolute humidity) and the daily mortality of COVID-19. The core analysis was a GAM with a quasi-Poisson link function based on the previous studies [19, 20] . We first built the basic models for mortality .

We incorporated smoothed spline functions of time, which accommodate nonlinear and nonmonotonic patterns between mortality and time, thus offering a flexible modeling tool. Then, we introduced the weather variables and analyzed their effects on mortality. Akaike's information criterion was used as a measure of how well the model fitted the data. Consistent with several recent time-series studies [21, 22] , the penalized smoothing spline function was applied to control the effects of confounding factors, such as time trends, day-of-week and air pollution. The core GAM equation is: Where t is the day of the observation; E(Y t ) is the expected number of daily mortality for COVID-19 on day t; α is the intercept; β is the regression coefficient; X t is the daily level of weather variables on day t; s() denotes the smoother based on the penalized smoothing spline. Based on quasi Akaike information criterion (QAIC), the 2 degrees of freedom (df) was used for time trends and 3 df for air pollutants, temperature and relative humidity; DOW is a categorical variable indicating the date of the week. After establishing the core model, we also considered the lag effects of weather conditions on death of COVID-19, and examined the potentially lagged effects, i.e., single day lag (from lag 0 to lag 5) and multiple-day average lag (from lag 01 to lag 05) [23] . The exposure and response correlation curves between weather variables and COVID-19 mortality were plotted using a spline function in the GAM. We also performed a sensitivity analysis by changing the df of the penalized smoothing spline function from 2 to 9 for calendar time and from 3 to 8 for temperature and humidity. All of the statistical analyses were two-sided, and at a 5% level of significance. All analyses were conducted using R software (version 3.5.3) with the GAM fitted by the "mgcv" package (version 1.8-27). The effect estimates were expressed as the percentage changes and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in daily mortality of COVID-19 associated with per 1 unit increase in weather variables.
