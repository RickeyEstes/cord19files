There are two methods included in this group: nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA). These are isothermal RNA amplification methods modeled after retroviral replication [20, 21] . In both methods, the RNA target is reverse transcribed into cDNA and then RNA copies are synthesized with a RNA polymerase. Transcriptionbased amplification systems have several characteristics such as no requirement for a thermal cycler, rapid kinetics and a single-stranded RNA product that does not require denaturation prior to detection. Gen-Probe has developed TMA-based assays for detection of HCV and HIV-1, while NASBA-based kits (bioMÃ©rieux) have developed commercially available kits for the detection and quantitation of HIV-1 RNA and CMV RNA and detection of enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus RNA. Since nucleic acid amplification methods have several disadvantages, such as the requirement for precision thermal cycling, isothermal techniques are being introduced as a diagnostic tool due to their simple operation, rapid reaction and easy detection. These new techniques do not require thermal cycler and can be performed by using a heating block and/or water bath. The main isothermal methods include loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) [33] .
