Plasmids, antibodies, and reagents SB203580, PD98059, LY294002, SP600125, GF109203, H89, EGTA, MG132, DTT, fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester (AM), and pluronic-F127 were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co (St. Louis, MO, USA). All protein kinase inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO and used at a final concentration of 50 μM for PD98059, 10 μM for SB203580, 50 μM for GF109203, 30 μM for SP600125, 25 μM for LY294002, 10 μM for H89, and 10 μM for MG132. Antibody against COX-2 was from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Antibodies specific for ERK, phospho-ERK, JNK, and phospho-JNK were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Luciferase reporter vector (pGL3) containing a COX-2 promoter region (− 891/+ 9), its truncation mutants, and site specific mutants were constructed previously (Zhu et al., 2002) . A NS3 construct was created by RT-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of the open reading frame from HCV 2b. To create NS3-encoding vectors, the NS3 gene was amplified using the following primers: 5′-AAAGGATC-CATGGCGCCCATCACG-3′ (sense) 5′-CCCGAATTCC-TAAGTGACGACCTCTAGGTC-3′ (antisense), in which BamHI and EcoRI sites were introduced, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was cloned into BamHI and EcoRI sites of pCMV-tag2B to generate plasmid pCMV-NS3, in which NS3 protein was tagged by FLAG. The resulting construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutants of ERK1 and ERK2 were gifts from Dr. Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) and a mutant of JNK was a gift from Dr. Karin (University of California at San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA). PKC siRNA vectors were constructed by ligating the corresponding pairs of oligonucleotide to pSilencer 2.0 (Ambion, Inc., Augustin, TX, USA) based on the sequences described previously (Storz et al., 2004) .
