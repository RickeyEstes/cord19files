antigen is associated mostly with cell debris (arrow heads), ×200. B L. intracellularis antigen is associated with cell debris (arrow heads) and in close proximity to enteroid cells (black arrows), ×200. C L. intracellularis antigen is observed in close association with mouse enteroid cells (black arrows), ×200. D A few L. intracellularis antigens are observed in this image, some close to mouse enteroid cells (black arrow), and some associated with cell debris (arrow head), ×200. Enteroid lumen is indicated by an asterisk (*). culture media; SN: sterile-filtered L. intracellularis-culture supernatant; L. intracellularis: suspension with about 10 6 L. intracellularis organisms/mL. Each enteroid received approximately 100 nL of each respective treatment. Treatments were placed directly into the lumen of the enteroids by microinjection using a microinjector (Nanoject II, Drumond Scientific, Broomall, PA, USA) operated by a trained technician. Experiments were performed in four independent replicates.
