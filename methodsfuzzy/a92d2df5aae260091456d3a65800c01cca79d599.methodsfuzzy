Human subjects. This prospective observational study was performed in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston from January to April 2018. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Emory University, and we confirm that all research was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was obtained from the parents of all subjects prior to collection and use of their samples. All patients greater than 48 hours of age, with a corrected gestational age of at least 40 weeks, who were 18 years old or younger admitted to the PICU, and who met criteria for being at risk or having PARDS as defined by the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC) 2 were screened for eligibility. To be enrolled in the study, children had to have lung injury within 7 days of a known clinical insult, new infiltrate(s) consistent with acute pulmonary parenchymal disease on chest imaging and be receiving oxygen delivered either non-invasively or invasively to maintain an oxygen saturation in the 88-97% range. Respiratory viral infections were confirmed by respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction testing as ordered at the discretion of the primary medical team caring for the patient. Although a viral infection may have been suspected, not all patients had clinical identification of the virus by laboratory testing. Children were excluded if they had any perinatal related lung disease, respiratory failure fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload, chronic respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation via a tracheostomy or RAM cannula, confirmed immunodeficiency disorder, immunosuppression from chemotherapy for an oncologic process, chronic immunosuppression in a bone marrow transplant or solid organ transplant recipient, no parent or legal guardian present to provide written informed consent, or the attending physician did not wish the patient to participate in the study. Clinical data collection. Clinical data were abstracted from the medical record onto a standardized form. Variables included demographics; fraction inspired oxygen, mean airway pressure, arterial oxygen saturation or arterial oxygen pressure used to calculate an oxygen saturation index (OSI) or oxygenation index (OI), respectively; laboratory and microbiology results; length of mechanical ventilation and need for reintubation; length of PICU stay, use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); and vital status. Severity of illness was determined by the Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM)-III and Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) scores were calculated within 24 hours of PICU admission [17] [18] [19] [20] . Need for mechanical ventilation to 28-days was monitored to calculate ventilator-free days 21 . Lung injury severity was categorized according to PALICC criteria 2 as follows: At Risk = OI < 4 (OSI < 5); Mild = 4 ≤ OI < 8 (5 ≤ OSI < 7.5); Moderate = 8 ≤ OI < 16 (7.5 ≤ OSI < 12.3); Severe = OI ≥ 16 (OSI ≥ 12.3). Blood and tracheal aspirate sample collections. A 4 mL blood specimen was collected in a K-EDTA vacutainer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) within 24 hours of endotracheal intubation for children weighing greater than 6 kg who had either an arterial or central venous catheter. Serial blood samples were collected every other day for up to one week, and then weekly thereafter, for the duration of mechanical ventilation and/or the presence of either an arterial or central venous catheter. Assays for neutrophil activation were performed within an hour of blood collection and cells were kept at 4 °C until the assay was performed. Tracheal aspirates were obtained from patients on conventional mechanical ventilation by instilling 1-5 mL of sterile saline through the inline Ballard suction catheter and into a sterile Luken's trap as part of routine suctioning. Serial tracheal aspirate samples were collected every other day for up to one week, and then weekly thereafter, for the duration of mechanical ventilation. There was no weight limit below which a tracheal aspirate could be obtained on a patient. Children who were mechanically ventilated with high frequency oscillation ventilation were suctioned only if clinically indicated and approved by the attending physician. Tracheal aspirate samples were immediately placed on ice for transport to the laboratory for processing. Blood and tracheal aspirate sample processing. Blood was spun at 400 × g to separate cells from platelet-rich plasma. Plasma was spun at 3,000 × g to generate platelet-free plasma, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Pelleted blood cells were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 2.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) up to the original whole blood volume for flow cytometry analysis or for neutrophil purification, as described 22 . Neutrophils were purified by negative selection from PBS-EDTA-washed whole blood using the EasySep Direct Human Neutrophil Isolation kit (STEMCELL Technologies Inc., Cambridge, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tracheal aspirate was gently dissociated using repeated passage through an 18 G needle after the addition of 6 ml of PBS-EDTA. Dissociated tracheal aspirate was then centrifuged at 800 × g to generate a cell pellet and a fluid fraction. The fluid fraction was spun at 3,000 × g to generate cell-free airway supernatant (ASN), aliquoted, www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and stored at −80 °C. Airway cells were resuspended in PBS-EDTA, counted using a Countess cytometer, and used for flow cytometry assays. Transepithelial migration model for neutrophil conditioning. We used an in vitro model recently developed by our group that recapitulates airway neutrophil phenotype in chosen pathological lung environments. This model was previously applied to cystic fibrosis (CF), asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), using ASN from patients with these conditions added apically to attract and condition naive blood neutrophils through a small airway epithelial lining into the lumen 16 . Briefly, 2 × 10 6 purified blood neutrophils were loaded onto the 200 µm-thick basal compartment of an Alvetex scaffold (ReproCELL, Glasgow, UK) coated with collagen and a monolayer of H441 cells, a human Club cell line, grown for two weeks at an air-liquid interface 16 . Neutrophils were allowed to migrate for 14 hours at 37 °C at 5% CO 2 through the collagen and epithelial layers into the apical compartment comprised of ASN diluted to 33% in RPMI 1640 medium with L-glutamine, or the same medium with the chemoattractant leukotriene B4 (LTB4, 100 nM). Cell staining and flow cytometry. Blood and airway neutrophils collected from patients in vivo and neutrophils transmigrated in the in vitro model were preincubated with human TruStain FcX receptor blocking solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) and Live/Dead Aqua (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 10 min on ice in the dark followed by labeling antibodies listed in Table E1 , for 30 min. All panels were applied to blood samples. Due to limited numbers of cells in some tracheal aspirate samples, flow cytometry panels (detailed in Table E1 ) were prioritized as follows: Panel 1, Airway Purity, Fluorescence Minus 5 Control, Panel 2, and Panel 3. Samples were treated with BD Phosflow ™ Lyse/Fix Buffer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), washed twice with PBS-EDTA, and stored at 4 °C in the dark until acquisition on a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). Transmigrated neutrophils were similarly stained with flow panels described in Table E1 and acquired on an LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences). Compensation, using AbC Total Antibody and ArC Amine-Reactive Compensation Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific), gating and analysis were performed with FlowJo v.10 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Single cells were separated from doublet cells by gating on forward scatter area versus forward scatter height. Neutrophils were selected based on their forward scatter area versus side scatter area profiles. Live cells were then selected by exclusion of dead events positive for the dye Live/Dead Aqua, and platelets or platelet/leukocyte aggregates were excluded by staining for CD41a + events. CD66b + neutrophils were then confirmed by gating on CD66b versus side scatter area for both tracheal aspirate (Fig. E1A ) and whole blood neutrophils (Fig. E1B ). Mean fluorescence intensities of surface markers are reported for CD66b + neutrophils. To determine the background mean fluorescence intensity signal in the five reporter channels (PB450, AF488, PECy7, PE, and APC) we report mean fluorescence signal intensity in CD66b + neutrophils from the blood and airway samples that were only stained for CD41a, Live/ Dead aqua, CD66b, and CD16 (fluorescence minus (FM) five) controls (Fig. E2 ).
