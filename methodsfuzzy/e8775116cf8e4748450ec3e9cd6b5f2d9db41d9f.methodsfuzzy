To examine the impact of the SARS outbreak on hotel stock performance in Taiwan, we applied the event-study methodology (ESM), which has been widely used to measure the effect of an economic event on the value (or stock returns) of a firm. 1 We first estimated what Taiwanese hotel stock returns would have been if the SARS event had not occurred. The ESM allows us to separate the component of hotel stock price movement due to firmspecific events from that due to market-wide movements. The component attributed to firm-specific events like the SARS event is called ''abnormal'' return (AR), which is À11.14 À20.00
