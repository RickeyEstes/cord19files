Plant materials and preparation of TSL-1. The leaves used in this study were obtained from TS grown in Tuku (Yunlin County, Taiwan). The leaves were collected and washed briskly with water; TSL-1 fraction was extracted as mentioned in our previous study. 16 Cell viability assays. H441 (lung adenocarcinoma cell lines), H520 (lung squamous cell lines), and H661 (lung large-cancer cells) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md). H441 (1 3 10 4 cells/well), H520 (1 3 10 4 cells/well), and H661 cells (4 3 10 3 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/ mL penicillin, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10 mmol/L HEPES, and 1.0 mmol/L sodium pyruvate in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37 C overnight. The cells were then incubated in 10% FBS media with different concentration of TSL-1 for 24 h and 48 h. Cell growth was estimated by a colorimetric assay based on the conservation of tetrazolium dye (MTT) to a blue formazan product by live mitochondria. 17 Western blot analysis. After treatment, the cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested in a lysis buffer 16 for 20 min on ice. Cellular lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 3 g for 10 min, and the protein concentrations of the lysates were determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill). The procedure for Western blot was slightly modified from our previous study. 17 The blots were incubated with various primary AT A GLANCE COMMENTARY Yang C-J, et al.
