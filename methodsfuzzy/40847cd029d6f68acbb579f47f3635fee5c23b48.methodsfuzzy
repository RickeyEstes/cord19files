However, more advances in the development of devices for point of care testing has to be achieved, integrating DMF devices in complete instruments will be one of the challenges for the next few years in the field [154] (Table 2) . DMF also became a powerful tool for bioengineering at a single-cell level by combining with classic techniques like plasmid transfection to recently-developed technologies such as CRISPR [135] . These applications are the proof of the many possibilities that DMF gives not only for research in academic laboratories, but also opens opportunities to develop new techniques in diagnosis and also for the personalized medication. There are already various DMF-based powerful tools, but it will be expected that MDF technologies will be continually developed to solve the hurdles faced by biochemists and molecular biologists.
