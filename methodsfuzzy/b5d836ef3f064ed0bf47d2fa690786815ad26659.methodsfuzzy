We attempt to cover different types of mathematical models applied to the study of vector-borne disease, particularly the Zika virus. First, we provide basic knowledge on methodological approaches in order to facilitate non-mathematical background readers. We therefore initiated our survey to investigate previously published modeling frameworks. Subsequently, we further explore specifically the use of models in the study of the Zika virus. In our publication survey, we used the Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) and PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) databases to search for the relevant peer-reviewed journal articles. In the first step, we used the search terms ''dynamics, '' ''mathematical model,'' ''modeling,'' and ''vector-borne'' together with the names of vector-borne diseases including chikungunya, dengue, malaria, West Nile, and Zika. Then, we expanded our search to include the related models identified by the prior screening. The secondary search terminologies included ''compartmental,'' ''spatial,'' ''metapopulation,'' ''network,'' ''individual-based,'' and ''agent-based.'' In the second step, we examined only the models applied to Zika virus simulations. We strictly searched for publications focusing on the applications of mathematical modeling in Zika virus research. The search terms were then designated as the names of the modeling techniques described earlier AND ''Zika.'' We consistently excluded unrelated studies throughout the review process. For the publications that met our criteria, we intensively reviewed their modeling methods, categorized into the modeling types and compared to other related studies we found. The papers with irrelevant methodology were then removed. As we tried to capture all available studies, the publication year was unrestricted. However, the mathematical modeling approach in the Zika virus study has recently emerged. Hence, most of the research was recently published. We have collected research articles that were published before August 2017 based on our search criteria.
