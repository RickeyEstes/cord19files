Prior to initiation of this study, care, handling, and sampling of the animals were approved by the University of Arkansas Animal Care and Use Committee. A total of 350 crossbred beef calves (89 heifers, 129 steers, and 132 bulls; average BW of 240 ± 1 kg) were obtained from regional livestock auction markets in Arkansas and Oklahoma and shipped to the University of Arkansas Beef Cattle Facility at Savoy. Calves arrived in 4 shipment sets (block) with arrival dates of February 8 (n = 87, 63 bulls and 24 steers), March 1 (n = 88, 60 bulls and 28 steers), May 10 (n = 89, heifers), and September 26, 2013 (n = 86, 9 bulls and 77 steers). Upon arrival, calves were tagged in the left ear with a unique identification number, weighed, ear notched, and housed overnight in a holding pen with access to hay and water. Ear notches were sent for persistent infection with BVD virus testing (Cattle Stats LLC, Oklahoma City, OK), and no calves tested positive for the virus. The following morning, calves were administered respiratory (Pyramid 5, Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Ridgefield, CT) and clostridial (Covexin 8, Intervet Inc., Omaha, NE) vaccinations and were dewormed (Ivomec Plus, Merial Limited, Duluth, GA), and bulls were castrated by banding (California Bander, Inosol Co. LLC, El Centro, CA). All animals were branded with a hot iron on the right hip and weighed. Within each block, cattle were stratified by BW and, if necessary, arrival sex (bulls or steers) and assigned randomly to 1 of 8 pens (10 to 12 calves per pen). Pens were assigned randomly to treatment. Calves were housed on 0.42-ha grass paddocks. Calves were fed corn and dried distillers grain -based supplements (Tables 1 and 2) that served as carriers of mineral treatments. Treatments consisted of supplemental Zn (360 mg/d), Mn (200 mg/d), and Cu (125 mg/d) from sulfate (n = 2 pens per block), organic amino acid complex (Availa-4, Zinpro Corp., Eden Prairie, MN; n = 3 pens per block), and hydroxy (IntelliBond Z, M, and C, Micronutrients Inc., Indianapolis, IN; n = 3 pens per block) trace-mineral sources. This resulted in 8 pens of cattle supplemented with sulfate sources of trace minerals and 12 pens of cattle supplemented with trace minerals as organic amino acid complex or hydroxy sources. Calves were offered a supplement formulated for feeding at 0.9 kg/d (as-fed basis) on d 0. When the majority of the calves in each pen were consuming the supplements, the pen was switched to supplements with the appropriate mineral treatment formulated for feeding at the 1.4 kg/d (as-fed basis) rate, and then to supplements formulated for feeding at the 1.8 kg/d (as-fed basis) rate, with calves receiving this supplement for the remainder of the 42-(block 4) to 45-d (block 1, 2, and 3) trial. During block 1, intakes of the 0.9 and 1.4 kg/d supplements for all treatments were deemed inadequate, and thus the supplement composition was changed before block 2. Changes in the supplement were formulated so that the new supplement was approximately equal in nutrients to the original diet but the percentage of dried distillers grain plus solubles was reduced. Calves had ad libitum access to bermudagrass hay (89.92% DM, 12.85% CP, 70% NDF, 38% ADF, 134 mg of Mn/kg, 52 mg of Zn/kg, 9 mg of Cu/kg, and 0.25% S; DM basis). Grab samples of supplement were taken daily and composited by diet within block. Grab samples of hay were taken from each bale offered and were composited within block. Samples were frozen at −20°C until analysis. Any supplement refusals were collected and weighed, and a subsample was frozen at −20°C until DM analysis. Calves received booster vaccinations on d 14 (block 4) or d 16 (block 1, 2, and 3). Cattle were observed daily by trained personnel for signs of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) beginning the day after processing. Signs of BRD included depression, nasal or ocular discharge, cough, poor appetite, and respiratory distress. Cattle were given a clinical illness score of 1 to 5 (1 = normal to 5 = moribund). Calves with a score >1 were brought to the working facility and a rectal temperature was taken. If the rectal temperature was ≥40°C, the calf was treated according to a preplanned antibiotic protocol with therapy 1 (Micotil, Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN) administered at 3 mL/45.45 kg of BW. Treated calves were returned to their home pen for convalescence and were re-evaluated in 72 h. If rectal temperature was ≥40°C during re-evaluation, the calf received therapy 2 (Nuflor, Intervet Inc.) at a rate of 6 mL/45.45 kg of BW. Calves receiving therapy 2 were returned to their home pen for Records were kept of all antibiotics administered, and medication cost reported is the drug cost with no additional fees assessed. Calves that received all 3 drug therapies and gained less than 0.23 kg/d were deemed chronic (n = 6). Body weights were recorded initially (d −1 and 0) and before supple-ment feeding on d 14, 28, 41, and 42 (block 4) or d 16, 30, 44, and 45 (block 1, 2, and 3). Average daily gain was calculated for interim and final periods based on averages of initial and final BW that were taken on 2 consecutive days. Blood was collected from all calves on d −1 and the final day (d 42 or 45) via jugular venipuncture for plasma trace-mineral analysis, into vacuum tubes (7 mL) specifically made for trace-mineral analysis (Kendall Monoject 307014, Tyco Healthcare Group, Mansfield, MA), inverted to mix, and placed on ice. Calves in the final 2 blocks were bled on d −1, 16, 30, and 45 (block 3) or d −1, 14, 28, and 42 (block 4) for antibody titer response to vaccination. Blood (10 mL) was collected via jugular venipuncture in tubes containing a clot activator (BD Vacutainer 367985, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and allowed to sit at room temperature for at least 30 min to allow clot formation. All blood was spun at 2,060 × g for 20 min at 20°C, and plasma and serum was stored at −20°C. Plasma was deproteinated by mixing 1 mL of plasma with 7 mL of 1 N trace metal grade nitric acid for 24 h, and then centrifuged at 2,060 × g for 20 min at 20°C. The supernatant was taken to the University of Arkansas-Division of Agriculture Altheimer Laboratory for trace-mineral analysis by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (Model 3560, Applied Research Laboratory, Sunland, CA). Serum was analyzed for BVD type 1 antibody titers at the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (Ames, IA). Samples of supplements (Table  3 ) and hay were dried at 50°C in a forced-air oven until a constant weight to determine dry matter. Dried samples were ground in a Wiley Mill (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ) through a 1-mm screen. Samples were analyzed for CP via total combustion (Rapid Combustion Method, Elementar Americas Inc., Mt. Laurel, NJ) Pen was used as the experimental unit and incorporated in a randomized complete block design. The model included treatment as a fixed effect and block as a random effect. Growth performance, morbidity data (if calves were treated 1, 2, or 3 times with antibiotics), and antibiotic costs were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Plasma minerals, antibody titer response, and BW were analyzed using the MIXED procedure with repeated measure statement. The covariance structure of the repeated measure was variance components and the subject was pen within block. Data are reported as least squares means with standard errors. The LIFETEST procedure was used to compare the day when calves received their first, second, third, or last antibiotic treatment with calf as the experimental unit.
