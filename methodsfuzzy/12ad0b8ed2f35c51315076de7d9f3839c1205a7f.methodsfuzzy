To identify the functions of disaster management in tourism and explore congruence between these expectations and performance of destination disaster management, a mixed-method design was adopted. Exploratory qualitative research was undertaken as the constructs that defined disaster management were not yet established in the literature. Three stages of data collection were used to address the first research question. First, key journal articles and books sourced from disaster management, crisis communication, and tourism literatures were analysed for checklists and lists of disaster preparedness, response, and recovery attributes. Second, an Internet search revealed five crisis management or disaster response plans from DMOs or tourism organisations. These plans represented guides for tourism operators or DMOs in the case of risk and disaster and were sourced from state, federal and international organisations. Third, six semi-structured interviews were conducted with various individuals working for organisations within the tourism industry in Queensland. Participants included tourism operators, DMO executives, and members of local government who were involved in disaster management programs for their constituency. Participants consisted of two tourism operators, two employees of DMOs, and two individuals from local government. The semistructured interviews consisted of four open-ended questions. These real-world insights consequently added a new dimension to the emerging list of attributes. Interviews were then transcribed and coded, in an attempt to derive disaster management attributes from the text. Manual coding was undertaken, whereby the raw data were first transformed into preliminary codes, then final codes (Salda√±a, 2012) . The three lists of attributes were triangulated by comparing and contrasting, and integrating the separate lists into a definitive battery of attributes (Berg & Lune, 2004) . Similar attributes were combined, and attributes that were only mentioned in one of the lists were eliminated. From these tables, a final list of 14 attributes was developed, as shown in Table 2 . An online survey was then used to address the second research question. Participants were asked to rate the level of importance of for each of the 14 destination disaster management attributes using a seven point Likert type scale anchored at 1 (not important) and 7 (very important). A separate '0' (Don't Know/No Opinion) nonresponse option was also provided alongside each scale item. Participants were then asked to rate their destination's performance for the same 14 attributes, using a seven point scale anchored at 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree). Again, a separate '0' (don't know/no opinion) non response item was used to minimise potential bias of uninformed responses. Participants were also asked if they had ever experienced a disaster and about the characteristics of the organisation that the respondent represented. These questions were asked to gain a better understanding of the differences in responses based on participant's disaster experience and an organisation's size, type, industry, age, and geographic location. The target population for the online survey included any individual employed by an organisation operating within or affected by the tourism industry in Australia and New Zealand. Sectors considered as part of the tourism industry for the purpose of this research were: the accommodation industry, visitor attraction, cafes, restaurants, and takeaway food services, clubs, pubs taverns and bars, transport, casinos and gambling services, motor vehicle, travel agencies and tour operator services, sports and recreational services, automotive fuel retailing, retail trade and any trade association representing these sectors (Tourism Research Australia, 2012) . Participants were recruited from two sources. First, databases of destination marketing organisations and tourism trade organisations that agreed to assist with the dissemination of the survey. Organisations that agreed to disseminate the survey include destination management and regional development organisations in New Zealand, Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia, Tasmania, and industry associations such in accommodation and aviation in Australia and New Zealand. This avenue yielded 25 responses. An external panel was sourced from Research Now, a multi-national market research organisation that complies with research standards through membership to the Research Association of New Zealand, The Australian Market and Social Research Society and the Travel and Tourism Research Association. This resulted in a further 264 participants.
