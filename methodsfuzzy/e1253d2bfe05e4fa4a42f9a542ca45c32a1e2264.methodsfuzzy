RT-PCR for porcine MRV3. Viral RNA was isolated from fecal and ringdried swine blood meal samples using the QIAmp RNA kit (Qiagen, United States), and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using MRV3-S1 gene-specific primers (primer sequences available upon request). The amplified PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% (wt/vol) agarose gel, and the PCR products were purified and directly sequenced. Virus isolation. Virus isolation was performed on RT-PCR-positive fecal and blood meal samples. The chloroform extracts of a 20% fecal suspension and 10% ring-dried blood meal samples were filtered through 0.2-m-pore membrane filters (Millipore, United States) and inoculated into 9-to 11-day-old, specific-pathogen-free (SPF), developing chicken embryos (via the chorioallantoic membrane [CAM] route) and BHK-21 cells. Embryos and cells were incubated at 37°C for 5 days and monitored daily for mortality and cytopathic effects (CPE), respectively. At 5 days postinfection (dpi), allantoic fluid and CAM were harvested from eggs, and the cell culture supernatant was collected from BHK-21 cultures, chloroform extracted, and further passaged in SPF chicken embryos or BHK-21 cells, respectively. Viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR using MRV3 S1 segment-specific primers. Amplified MRV3-S1 PCR products were sequenced to confirm the viral genome. The virus isolates obtained from BHK-21 cells were further confirmed using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), employing a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against type 3 orthoreovirus 1 protein (clone 2Q2048; Abcam, United States,). Virus purification. BHK-21 cell monolayers grown in T-175 flasks were infected with the MRV3 isolates at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1% fetal calf serum (FCS). The cells were harvested at 3 dpi and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. The cellular debris was clarified by centrifugation at 3,700 ϫ g at 4°C. Crude virus was pelleted from the clarified supernatant by ultracentrifugation at 66,000 ϫ g for 2 h using an SW-28 rotor (Beckman Coulter, United States). The virus pellet was resuspended in 1 ml TN buffer (20 mM Tris, 400 mM NaCl, 0.01% N-lauryl sarcosine [pH 7.4]). The virus suspension was then layered onto a 15 to 45% (wt/ vol) discontinuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 92,300 ϫ g for 2 h at 4°C using an SW-41 Ti swing-out rotor (Beckman Coulter, United States). The virus band at the interface was collected and used for characterization and genomic studies. Virus characterization. Hemagglutination (HA) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays were performed as previously described (43), with modifications. Briefly, the viruses were serially diluted in 50 l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS [pH 7.4]) in 96-well V-bottom microtiter plates (Corning-Costar, United States) followed by 50 l of 1% pig erythrocytes (Lampire Biological Laboratories, United States). The plates were incubated for 2 h at 37°C to record the HA titer. The HI assay was performed using mouse monoclonal antibody directed against type 3 orthoreovirus 1 protein (clone 2Q2048; Abcam, United States) and 4 HA units of the virus. The HI assay plates were incubated initially at 37°C for 1 h and then at 4°C overnight before scoring. For electron microscopy, ultrathin sections of virus-infected BHK-21 cells (3 dpi), intestines of experimentally infected pigs, or purified virions were placed on Formvar-carbon-coated electron microscope grids and negatively stained with 2% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate or 1% sodium phosphotungstic acid for 30 s. The specimens were then examined in a JEOL 1400 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, United States) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kVA. To determine the temperature sensitivity, the virus strains were sub-jected to five different temperature treatments at 34, 37, 56, 80, and 90°C for 1 h. Serial dilution of the virus was then made in DMEM, which was then titrated for infectivity in BHK-21 cells. For trypsin sensitivity, virus was incubated with 1 g/ml tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) trypsin in DMEM for 1 h at 37°C and titrated for infectivity in BHK-21cells. To demonstrate the double-stranded nature of the viral genome, total RNA extracted from purified virions was subjected to S1 nuclease digestion and 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and silver nitrate staining. For protein profiling, the purified virus was denatured in protein sample buffer and analyzed by standard 7.5% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. Deep sequencing. The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) isolated from two purified viruses-FS03 isolated from fecal samples and BM100 isolated from swine ring-dried blood meal-were subjected to NextGen genome sequencing. The NEBNext Ultr directional RNA library prep kit for Illumina (catalog no. e74205; NEB) was used to prepare the RNA library with some modifications. Using a standard protocol, 100 ng of viral RNA was fragmented to 250 nucleotides at 94°C for 10 min. After adapter ligation, 350-to 375-bp libraries (250-to 275-bp insert) were selected using Pippin Prep (Sage Science, United States). The template molecules with the adapters were enriched by 12 cycles of PCR to create the final library. The generated library was validated using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and quantitated using the Quant-iT dsDNA H.S. kit (Invitrogen) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Two individually barcoded libraries (FS03 virus with A006-GCCAAT, and BM100 virus with A012-CTTGTA) were pooled and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq. Briefly, the individual libraries were pooled in equimolar amounts, denatured, and loaded onto MiSeq. The pooled library was spiked with 5% phiX and sequenced to 2 ϫ 250 paired-end reads (PE) on the MiSeq using the MiSeq reagent kit V2 at 500 cycles (MS-102-2003) to generate 24 million PE. Genome assembly. Reference-based mapping and de novo assembly methods were applied to the raw data for assembly into viral genomes. Reference-based mapping was performed against the mammalian orthoreovirus genome by using the CLC Genomics Workbench software (version 7.0.4; CLC Bio, Denmark). The de novo assembly was performed with the following overlap settings: mismatch cost of 2, insert cost of 3, minimum contig length of 1,000 bp, a similarity of 0.8, and a trimming quality score of 0.05. This assembly yielded 3,444 contigs that were annotated according to Gene Ontology terms with the Blast2Go program (44), which was executed as a plugin of CLC by mapping against the UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot database with a cutoff E value of 1eϪ05. Furthermore, to determine putative gene descriptions, homology searches were carried out through querying the NCBI database using the tBLASTx algorithm. The de novo-assembled sequences were used to confirm the validity of the reference-based sequence assembly. Both de novo assembly and the reference-based mapping produced identical sequences. Phylogenetic analysis. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of L1 and S class segments (S1, S2, S3, and S4) were compared with those of other closely related orthoreoviruses using the BioEdit sequence alignment editor software (version 7.0.0; BioEdit, Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA). The phylogenetic evolutionary histories for the virus strains were inferred using the maximum likelihood method based on either JTT w/freq model (45) for the S2, S3, S4, and L1 segments in Mega 6.06 (46) or the Jukes-Cantor evolution model (47) with "WAG" (i.e., Whelan and Goldman model) protein substitution for S1 segment in CLC workbench 7.0.4 after testing for their appropriateness to be the best fit. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1,000 replicates was taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 75% bootstrap replicates were collapsed. Pathogenicity study in neonatal pigs. All animal studies were performed as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Virginia Tech (IACUC no. 14-105-CVM, 5 June 2014). Thirty-five 2-day-old piglets, purchased from the Virginia Tech Swine Center, were housed as 7 animals/group in HEPA-filtered level 2 biosecurity facility. The experimental design is provided in Table S4 in the supplemental material. Prior to the start of the experiment, pigs were tested for most common enteric RNA viruses, such as rotavirus, PEDV, swine deltacoronavirus, Kobuvirus, and TGEV, by RT-PCR of the fecal samples using specific primers (primer sequences available upon request). The amplified PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% (wt/vol) agarose gel. After acclimatizing for a day, the animals were anesthetized, and 2 ml of 5 ϫ 10 5 TCID 50 /ml of each virus strain or chloroform extract of 10% blood meal suspension (2.5 g ring-dried blood meal) was homogenized in 12.5 ml DMEM to get a 20% solution that was extracted with an equal volume of chloroform. The upper aqueous phase obtained was diluted with an equal volume of DMEM to get a final concentration of 10%, and the piglet was orally inoculated using a 5-ml syringe. Mock-infected animals received 2 ml DMEM orally. The animals were monitored two times a day: rectal temperature, body weight, and clinical scores based on physical appearance, activity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and systemic signs were recorded on a scale of 0 to 3. Fecal swabs were collected daily and suspended in 1 ml of DMEM containing 10ϫ antibiotic solution (Hy-Clone, United States), mixed vigorously, incubated for 1 h, and stored at Ϫ80°C until tested. At 4 dpi, or when they reached the clinical endpoint, all animals were euthanized. Gross and microscopic lesions were scored by a board-certified veterinary pathologist blind to the experimental groups (48) . The S1 gene-specific RT-PCR was performed to confirm the production of orthoreovirus in the intestine using the intestinal contents of the experimentally infected piglets. Statistical analysis. Summary statistics were calculated to assess the overall quality of the data. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for assessment of the mean clinical score and microscopic lesion scores. The significance level was set for a P value of Ͻ0.01 and a 95% confidence interval. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software (version 6.0; Graph Pad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The complete genome sequences of both viruses FS03 and BM100 have been deposited in GenBank under accession no. KM820744 to KM820763.
