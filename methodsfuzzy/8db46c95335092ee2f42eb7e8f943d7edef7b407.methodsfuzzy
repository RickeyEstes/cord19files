Peptides. SARS CoV spike protein peptides used for the mapping of neutralizing epitopes and T-cell epitopes were synthesized as 15-mers with 10 amino acid overlap of the entire cover spike protein sequence (Supplementary data). Production of peptide-specific antisera. Mice were immunized subcutaneously with 30 lg of each peptide (D1, D2, and TM) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The same amount of synthetic peptides emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) was used to boost immunization on day 14 and 28 after the initial immunization. The guinea pigs and rabbits were immunized with 50 and 200 lg of each peptide formulated in the same adjuvant, respectively, and the same immunization protocol was used as described above. Moreover, an adjuvant Montanide ISA-51 and 5 lg of CpG nucleotide (TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT GTC GTT TTG TCG TT) of the equivalent volume with 30 lg peptides mixture were subcutaneously injected in mice using the same immunization protocol. Antisera were collected for immunological and biological assay every two weeks after the second boost. The antibody titers were determined by ELISA. T-cells proliferation assay. To determine whether peptide immunogens could induce specific T-cell lymphoproliferative responses, one-hundred microliters of 2 · 10 6 cells/ml splenocytes in complete RPMI-10 culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum) was added to each well in 96-well plates. The peptide was added to each well at a final concentration of 5 lg/ml. Cells in all of the wells were cultured in a total volume of 200 ll of medium. After 3 days in culture, cells were pulsed with [ 3 H]thymidine (1 lCi/well) for 16-18 h. Cells were then harvested, and the incorporated radioactivity was determined by Top Count scintillation counter (Packard, USA). IFN-c secreting T-cells subsets staining. CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells were purified by immunomagnetic separation using the MiniMACS system. Briefly, the spleen cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer (2% BSA/PBS), incubated with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 microbeads, and separated by an LS column according to the manufacturer's instructions. The CD4 + and CD8 + cells were mixed with same number of mitomycin Ctreated naïve splenocytes as antigen presenting cells in the presence or absence of peptides (10 lg/ml). Two days later, cells were harvested and INF-c secreting cells were identified using a Mouse IFN-c Secretion Assay Detection Kit (Miltenyi Biotec., Germany). Neutralization of SARS pseudovirus infection. SARS pseudovirus was prepared as previously described [13] . Supernatants containing pseudovirus bearing SARS CoV S protein were harvested 48-h post-transfection and used for single cycle infection of HepG2 cells. The infected cells were lysed and the expression of luciferase activity was determined by adding the substrate and then detecting the luminescence with a TopCount. The neutralization inhibition (%) was calculated by the equation: neutralization inhibition (%) = (units of luminescence with antiserum and peptide À units of luminescence with antiserum)/(units of luminescence without antiserum À units of luminescence with antiserum) · 100. Statistical analysis. The statistical significance of differential findings between experimental groups of animals was determined by Student's t test. Differences were considered statistically significant if the value of p was 60.05.
