The general characteristics of the first index case in the TB outbreak groups were described using univariate analysis according to the types of facilities. Mean values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were also evaluated to determine the rates of diagnosis, need for treatment, treatment initiation, and treatment completion of LTBI in each TB outbreak group. In addition, t-tests and variance analysis were performed to identify differences between clusters depending on the characteristics of the first index case. To identify factors affecting the diagnosis and treatment of latent TB, multilevel logistic regression analysis was performed. Multilevel analysis is known as an analytic method that considers upper level contextual effects, such as the 'area belonged to at the local level' or 'time for example, year cluster'. 29 In the multilevel logistic regression model used for this study, dependent variables included diagnosis and need for treatment of latent TB, as well as the initiation and completion of latent TB treatment in TB outbreak groups. Independent variables corresponding to level 1 (individual level) were biological characteristics (gender and age), TB characteristics (sputum test results, chest radiography results, and presence or absence of symptoms and its duration) of the index case, as well as the facility type. Independent variables for level 2 (year level) were year clusters (2013-2014 and 2015-2016). In addition, the median odds ratio (MOR) was calculated to examine variations by year. MOR is calculated as follows: Here, ö refers to the cumulative distribution function in the normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1, where ö −1 (0.75) is the 75th percentile. 30,31 MOR refers to an indicator that quantifies the variation between levels, by comparison between two individuals between different levels (year cluster in the present study); this is the median value of the odds ratios (ORs) in one group with a higher tendency and another with a lower tendency. MOR is a
