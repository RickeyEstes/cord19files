An unmatched caseecontrol study design with a ratio of one control per case was used to test associations between potential risk factors for mortality (Table 1) and cat mortality (natural death or euthanasia of the cat). *Centres 17 and 20 were unable to provide data on control cats and were thus excluded from the caseecontrol analysis. Data relating to the number of cats that died naturally or were euthanased were collected from CP's 23 largest adoption centres. CP adoption centres are run by managers employed by CP and have the capacity to accommodate an average of 120 cats at each centre. Approximately 30% of cats adopted each year from CP are housed at adoption centres, whereas the remaining 70% of cats are adopted from more than 250 CP branches which usually accommodate fewer cats than adoption centres and are run by volunteers. Data for this study related to all cats admitted during the first 6 months of 2005 to adoption centres, rather than branches as the management of the adoption centres is centrally controlled and data were more easily accessible. Two centres were unable to provide data on their control cats and were thus excluded from the casee control analysis. Data collected by 21 CP adoption centres were thus included in the casee control study. Data relating to the cause of mortality were supplied by staff at the adoption centres; however, not all causes were verified by postmortem examination or by a veterinarian. Cats that died naturally or were euthanased represented 4.7% (379/8017) of all cats that were admitted to 23 CP adoption centres between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2005 (Table 1) .
