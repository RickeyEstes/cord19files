A total of 446 sera from 24-to 26-week-old finishing pigs in 88 swine farms (an average of 5 serum samples per farm) was selected using a random-numbers table. The list of farms was obtained from the Korean Swine Association, and herds were included from all five of the country states. The sample size was based on financial and logistic restrictions. All farms in this study were farrow-to-finish operations and do not use an all-in-all-out system. No herds were vaccinated against any strain of PRCV. The average size of the 88 herds selected, 220 sows per herd, is considerably larger than the Korean average (currently approximately 135 sows per herd). A herd was considered positive when at least one of the sampled animals was positive. 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.An ELISA kit (Svanova Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) with a sensitivity of 0.978% and specificity of 0.964% relative to the serum-neutralization test was used to determine the prevalence of PRCV infection (Dr. S. Carman, personal communication, University of Guelph). Blood was collected by jugular puncture and allowed to clot, centrifuged and the serum kept at Ã€208C until used. One hundred microliters of the 1:2 dilution of test sera added to duplicate wells coated with TGEV antigen, and incubated for 2 h at 378C. The wells were then washed three times with a phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween (300 ml/well). The plates were reincubated for 30 min at room temperature and after being washed three times, were incubated for 30 min with 100 ml of anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate solution. After being washed three times, the plates were incubated for 30 min with 100 ml of substrate solution at room temperature. The reaction was then stopped by addition of 50 ml of a stop solution into each well. The optical density of each well was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm using a ELISA microplate reader.
