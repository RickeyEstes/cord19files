Cells, virus, and plasmids BHK-21F, Vero, BSR T7/5, CV-1, and HeLa CD4 LTR βgal cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). BHK-21F cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% tryptose phosphate broth, and HeLa CD4 LTR βgal cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 200 μg/ml geneticin, 100 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4). The recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3) that expresses T7 RNA polymerase was grown in CV-1 cells as described previously. 76 pCAGGS and pGEM2X plasmids encoding PIV5 F, PIV5 HN, and PIV5 S443P F have been described previously. 53 pCAGGS plasmids encoding PIV5 G105A and G107A F have also been previously described. 58, 59 PIV5 F proteins containing TM domain amino acid residue substitutions were made by four-primer PCR with Tgo DNA polymerase and then by cloning into pCAGGS PIV5 F and pGEM2X PIV5 F. Plasmids encoding the double substitutions were made by subcloning pCAGGS L486A and I488A F into pCAGGS plasmids encoding S443P, G105A, or G107A F. Mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 3100-Avant automated DNA sequencer.
