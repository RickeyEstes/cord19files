Ethical approval. All procedures and protocols for sample collection and processing were approved by the Administrative Committee on Animal Welfare of the Institute of Zhejiang and Fujian CDC Veterinary and the Ethics Committee of the CDC of Easten Theater. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations (Approval number: 2015009). Table 1 . Each sample (approximately 1 g of intestine tissue) was immediately transferred into viral transport medium and stored in liquid nitrogen prior to transportation to the laboratory 35 . Samples were stored at −80 °C until analyzed. RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis. All samples were pooled and then underwent reverse transcription PCR analysis as previously described 36 . Briefly, each intestine sample (~0.1 g) was homogenized Bootstrap values were calculated from 1000 trees. The triangles in the phylogenetic trees denote sequences derived in the study.

The homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants from each sample were passed through a 0.22 μm Pellicon II filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Viral RNA was extracted using the Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was eluted in 30 μl RNase-free H 2 O and stored at −80 °C. Reverse transcription was performed using the 1st cDNA synthesis kit (TaKaRa), according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed using cDNA with the following primers; forward primer 5′-AAGACCAACATCGCGGACATC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TAGTTCTTGTTGWGRTGRTT-3′. The PCR reaction generated a 1000 nt fragment of the partial rep and cap gene. Primers were designed based on the nucleotide sequence of Rs-BtAAV1 (MF682927). The PCR amplification was performed in a 50 μl reaction mix containing 2 μl extracted cDNA, 10 μl PCR Buffer, 20 pmol of each primer, 4 μl dNTP (2.5 mM) and 1 μl Taq DNA polymerase (PrimeSTAR GXL, Takara). PCR conditions included 30 cycles of amplification, consisting of denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 65 °C for 15 s, extension at 68 °C for 1 min. Standard precautions were taken to avoid PCR contamination, and a negative control was included for each PCR assay. Amplified PCR products www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ were sequenced in both directions using an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Invitrogen, Beijing, China). Bat AAV identified from bat species Rhinolophus pusillus in the Fujiang province (designated BtAAV-CXC1) was selected for additional full-length genome sequencing (Supplementary Table S1 ). Sequencing of bat AAVs partial rep and cap genome regions. After PCR screening, all positive samples were PCR amplified that targeted 841 bp and 1100 bp fragments of rep and cap ORFs. Primer sequences are shown in Table 3 . PCR amplification was performed in a 50 μl reaction mix containing 2 μl extracted cDNA, 10 μl PCR Buffer, 20 pmol of each primer, 4 μl dNTP(2.5 mM) and 1 μl Taq DNA polymerase (PrimeSTAR GXL, Takara). PCR conditions were; 30 cycles of amplification consisting of denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 65 °C for 15 s, extension at 68 °C for 1 or 2 min. Standard precautions were taken to avoid PCR contamination, and a negative control was included in each PCR assay. Amplified PCR products were sequenced in both directions using the ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Invitrogen, Beijing, China). Sequence and phylogenetic analysis. Viral nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences were analyzed using the DNASTAR software package (Lasergene). Putative ORFs with a minimum size of 150 aa and a coding capacity were predicted using the NCBI ORF Finder (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html). Amplified sequences obtained by PCR amplification were aligned using BLAST in GenBank. Representative sequences of other known AAVs were downloaded from GenBank. MEGA7.0 software was used to construct the maximum-likelihood evolutionary tree of the nearly complete genome sequence of BtAAV-CXC1 or partial rep and cap sequences of bat AAVs. Bootstrap values were estimated using 1000 replicates on the ML substitution model 41 . Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. All sequences obtained in this study were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MK391482 for BtAAV-CXC1 complete genome, MK357907, MK394009-MK394021 and MK394023-MK394056 for the 48 partial rep sequences of AAVs, MK394057-MK394080 for the 24 partial cap sequences of AAVs 42 .
