The study was conducted in the main RFTB colony known to date on Reunion island, a natural cave (30 m 3 ) in the West coast of the island (21,111°S, 55,259°E). The colony is monospecific and mostly composed of adult females during the early stages of the breeding season (October to December), and of newborns and juveniles, after the parturition period, from mid-December to mid-January onward (Dietrich et al., 2015) . Between 40 000 and 50 000 flying adult bats have been estimated before parturition; however, after the breeding season, the cave remains totally empty from bats (between May and September) (Dietrich et al., 2015) . A non-invasive sampling strategy was setup to avoid direct manipulation of bats and to limit colony disturbance. During each sampling session, we collected guano samples in the narrowest part of the cave entrance, in ten different points separated by 50 cm along a 4.5 m transect ( Supplementary   Figures 1 and 2 ). Sterile open-ended 2 mL syringes were used to collect a core sample, in order to obtain c. 130 mg of guano. Each guano sample was immediately mixed in 1.5 mL of Virus Transport Media (VTM; e.g. Lebarbenchon et al., 2017) . Samples were maintained in a cooler with ice packs in the field and stored in a -80°C freezer within two hours. In total, 190 samples were collected during 19 different sampling sessions between June 21 st 2016, and June 29 th 2017. During each sampling session, the colony was visually monitored in order to estimate the relative population size (i.e. no bat, less than half of the cave covered with bats, more than half of the cave covered), and to assess the population age structure and timing of parturition based on the presence of adults, newborns, and juveniles. Samples were mixed and centrifuged at 1 500 g for 15 min.

PCR products of the expected size were submitted for direct Sanger sequencing (Genoscreen, Lille, France). Chi-square tests were conducted to investigate the effects of the sampling date and of the sampling location in the transect, on the probability of successful detection of AstV RdRp gene. Statistical analyses were conducted with R 3.4.4 (R Core Team, 2018). A phylogenetic analysis was performed on the RdRp gene sequences obtained in this study (GenBank accession numbers MK966904 to MK966918) and 79 reference RdRp sequences of AstVs detected in a large diversity of bat species, in particular from Africa (Madagascar, Mozambique, Gabon), as well as in other type of hosts (e.g. avian, human, livestock). Sequences were aligned with CLC Sequence Viewer 8.0 (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark). A maximum-likelihood analysis was done with the software PhyML 3.1 (Guindon et al., 2010) , with an evolutionary model selected by Model Generator 0.85 (GTR + I + Г; I = 0.14, α = 0.83; (Keane, Creevey, Pentony, Naughton, & Mclnerney, 2006) , and 1 000 bootstraps.
