Our research protocol was approved by the Research Review Board of our institution. All patients with clinically proven pneumonia complicating influenza A (H1N1) who were admitted to the Clinical Center of Public Health in Shanghai, China between July 2009 and March 2011 were enrolled as the subjects of the study. All of the patients underwent at least three serial HRCT chest scans. Specifically, a total of 39 patients (aged 19e78 years with a mean of 42.2 years), including 27 males and 12 females, participated in the research. Their diagnoses of pneumonia complicating influenza A (H1N1) were defined by the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China. Oropharyngeal and/or nasopharyngeal specimens of all patients were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), all of which showing positive to H1N1 virus strain. To avoid unnecessary exposure to radiation, HRCT should be reserved for patients whose diagnosis is uncertain or for patients with clinical deterioration that requires further evaluation of lung abnormalities. For patients with highly suspected concurrent infections, additional microbiological examinations for other viral, bacterial and fungal infections are recommended. All patients experienced fever with a body temperature of above 38 C, tachypnea, and cough. Other common symptoms included generalized weakness (n ¼ 18, 46.2%) and headache (n ¼ 9, 23.1%). Preexisting medical conditions were reported in 19 (48.7%) patients, including pregnancy (n ¼ 2, 5.1%), primary hypertension (n ¼ 12, 30.8%), chronic hepatitis B (n ¼ 2, 5.1%), ankylosing spondylitis (n ¼ 1, 2.6%), lymphoma (n ¼ 1, 2.6%), and type II diabetes (n ¼ 1, 2.6%). All the patients received neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir), while 21 (53.8%) also received corticosteroids. Mechanical ventilation was performed for 12 (30.8%) patients. And no occurrence of death was reported in our study. At admission, within 1e7 days after the onset of symptoms, the findings of laboratory tests included evaluated WBC count in 5 cases (7.9%), decreased WBC count in 18 cases (46.2%), decreased PO 2 level in 25 cases (64.1%), decreased CD4þ T cell count in 36 patients (92.3%), and increased C-reaction protein level in all 39 patients (100%). CT scans were performed with a 16-slice Siemens CT scanner (Somatom Sensation 16, Erlangen, Germany) using the volumetric technique and no contrast enhancement. Spiral scans were obtained with the same scanner under the following parameters setting: 110 mAs, 120 kVp, 0.75-mm collimations, 1 mm slice, and a high-spatial-frequency reconstruction algorithm. All images were reviewed at a picture archiving and communication system workstation. The images were obtained with both mediastinal (width 350e450 HU and level 20e40 HU) and parenchymal (width 1200e1600 HU and level À500 to À700 HU) window settings. Two experienced radiologists working in the field of chest radiology for 12 and 22 years reviewed the HRCT scans independently and any disagreement was reached consensus after discussion to a final interpretation. The predominant patterns of lung abnormalities on the HRCT scans were classified as GGO, consolidation, and mixture of GGO and consolidation. The HRCT scans were assessed for the presence and distribution of GGOs and consolidations. GGO was defined as hazy area of increased attenuation that did not obscure the underlying vessels. Consolidation was defined as homogeneous opacification of the parenchyma that obscured the underlying vessels. Parenchymal band was defined as non-tapering linear opacity that was several millimeters thick and several centimeters long. Reticular opacity was defined as linear opacities arranged into a network. The presence of a parenchymal band, reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis, or irregular interfaces (bronchovascular, pleural, or mediastinal) was considered to be evidence of fibrosis [13] . On the scans, the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy (defined as a lymph node with 1 cm short-axis diameter), pneumothorax, and pleural effusion was also noted. The distribution of abnormalities was categorized as focal, multifocal, and diffuse. A focal distribution was defined as a singular focus of abnormality. A multifocal distribution was defined with more than one focus and was further classified into unilateral and bilateral. A diffuse distribution was defined as bilateral abnormalities with an equivalent volume of one or both lungs involved. All HRCT scans were categorized according to the time points of scanning, including the day of symptoms onset as well as the days on which the scan was obtained such as day(d) 1e3, d 4e7, d 8e14, d 15e21, d 22e28 and after d 28 since the symptoms onset. The initial and follow-up scans were analyzed to determine longitudinal changes of the detected main lung abnormalities. The patterns, extent and distribution of the abnormalities were compared with findings in the same region on previous and subsequent HRCT scans. Patients undergoing initial and all follow-up scans within a minimum of 21days were enrolled for further analysis to determine longitudinal changes of the detected main lung abnormalities. The extent of involvement of each abnormality was assessed independently for each of three zones: upper (above the carina), middle (below carina and above the inferior pulmonary vein) and lower (below the inferior pulmonary vein). Each lung zone (totally 6 lung zones) was assigned a value based on the following criteria: 0 for no involvement, 1 for involvement of less than 25%, 2 for involvement of 25e50%; 3 for involvement of 50e75%, and 4 for involvement of above 75%. Sum of the values indicates the overall lung involvement and the maximal CT score was then 24.
