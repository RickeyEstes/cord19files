Cloning and expression of full-length and truncated GAV His 6 -tagged N proteins The GAV ORF2 gene and sequences with variable 59-and/or 39-terminal truncations (Fig. 1A) were amplified by PCR using various primers containing Bam HI sites (Supplementary Table  S2 ) to allow in-frame insertion with the N-terminal His 6 -tag of pQE10 (QIAGEN). A plasmid containing the entire ORF2 gene [2] was used as template for all PCRs. Amplified DNA products were digested with Bam HI and ligated into pQE10. Plasmid DNA was transformed into competent DH5a or M13[pREP4] E. coli host strains and clones were grown on Luria broth (LB) agar plates containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin or 100 mg/ml ampicillin plus 25 mg/ml kanamycin. To screen clones for ORF2 inserts in the correct orientation, rapid colony PCRs were performed using the pQE-specific primer 59-CCCGAAAAGTGCCACCTG-39 (QIA-GEN) in combination with various ORF2 gene-specific anti-sense primers (Supplementary Table S2 ). Plasmid DNA prepared to each clone selected for analysis was sequenced using the pQEspecific primer and clone specific reverse primers to confirm the fidelity of the DNA insert. Two plasmid clones containing the inserts were each inoculated into 2 ml LB medium containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin (plus 25 mg/ml kanamycin for M13[pREP4] cells) and grown overnight at 37uC in a shaking incubator. A portion (500 ml) of each culture was inoculated into 10 ml pre-warmed LB medium containing antibiotics and the culture was shaken vigorously at 37uC until the optical density (OD) at 600 nm had reached 0.5. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 to 1.0 mM final concentration of isopropyl-b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubation at 37uC was continued overnight. Cells were collected by centrifugation (8,0006g, 10 min, 4uC), disrupted by sonication in lysis buffer (300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH 8.0) for non-denatured protein purification and the ORF2 His 6 -fusion proteins were purified using Ni +2 -NTA agarose beads as described in the QIAexpressionist TM instruction manual (QIAGEN). The proteins were stored at 280uC until used in EMSAs. For some ORF2 His 6 -fusion proteins, E. coli cells were lysed in 8 M urea and protein was purified under denaturing conditions as described in the QIAexpressionist TM manual. Purified denatured proteins (500 ml each) were refolded by dialysis overnight at 4uC in 200 ml refolding buffer (3 M urea, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM reduced glutathione, 1 mM oxidized glutathione, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.1). The dialysis buffer was then replaced with 200 ml PBS and dialysis was continued for 24 h at 4uC.
