House finch capture, housing, and experimental infection. We trapped male house finches at bird feeder sites in Alabama, USA, between August and September of 2014 (as described in reference 47). All birds used in the study were yearlings, having hatched in the spring of the calendar year in which they were collected. We collected birds from three sites in Auburn, AL, approximately 1.5 miles apart and from two sites in Birmingham, AL, separated by 8 miles. Upon capture, a blood sample (ϳ70 l) and choanal swab were collected from each bird. Choanal swabbing consisted of inserting a swab into the bird's oral cavity and then swabbing the tracheal opening and choanal cleft for approximately 15 s. Blood plasma was used for a serum plate agglutination assay to test for anti-M. gallisepticum antibodies, indicating prior M. gallisepticum exposure (48) . Swabs were used for PCR amplification of M. gallisepticum DNA to test for current infection (49) . Birds positive by either test were immediately released and not retained for the experiment. The remaining birds then underwent a 30-day quarantine period, during which they were treated for infection by Trichomonas gallinae and Coccidia spp. Following quarantine, birds were randomly divided into treatment groups. Males in one treatment group (n ϭ 15) were inoculated with an epizootic outbreak house finch M. gallisepticum strain cultured from a wild-caught house finch in Georgia, USA, in 1995 (HF1995 [passage 13]; cross-listed as GA_1995 in reference 26). Males in the second treatment group (n ϭ 15) were inoculated with a poultry M. gallisepticum strain (Rlow [passage 17]), which was provided by Naola Ferguson-Noel (University of Georgia). We inoculated birds by dropping 10 l of the respective M. gallisepticum culture into each eye, each containing approximately 1 ϫ 10 4 to 1 ϫ 10 6 color-changing units/ml of M. gallisepticum. To prevent M. gallisepticum transmission between treatments, we housed finches in separate rooms under identical conditions. Following inoculation, we monitored finches for the development of infection for 8 weeks (56 days), after which time all birds were humanely euthanized by CO 2 narcosis in accordance with the rules established by the 2013 American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines on Euthanasia. We also took a choanal (tracheal) swab sample on these days to test for the establishment of an M. gallisepticum infection and pathogen load using quantitative PCR (qPCR). All described work was approved by Auburn University's IACUC under PRN 2014-2517 and Biological Use Authorization 500. Quantification of clinical disease severity. To document clinical disease signs (conjunctivitis), we photographed the right and left eyes of each bird, with the bird's eye parallel to the camera. We then quantified the area of the conjunctival swelling in the photographs using the programs TpsUtil version 1.46 and TpsDig version 2.16 (50, 51) . Bill depth was measured with calipers to 0.1 mm. This measurement was then used as a scale in the images so that the area of conjunctival swelling in square millimeters could be assessed. The scaled picture files were then duplicated, with one file used for the placement of 10 landmarks around the inner ring of the conjunctiva. The duplicate file was used to place 12 landmarks around the outer area of the conjunctiva. Area measurements (in square millimeters) for the outer and inner rings of the conjunctiva were generated using TpsUtil. The area of the conjunctiva was then calculated as the area of the outer ring minus the area of the inner ring. To determine swelling severity, we subtracted the conjunctival area at day 0 (preinoculation) for a given individual from the area measured at a given sampling time point for that same individual. We estimated the background variation in our measurements by repeating this process with photographs of control birds. We used twice the average background variation as the threshold to determine whether birds displayed clinical conjunctiva swelling. The threshold value was subtracted from all measurements, with any values below the threshold being treated as having no, or zero, change in swelling. M. gallisepticum presence and load. We tested the respiratory epithelia of all house finches for M. gallisepticum at 0, 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 56 dpi. Choanal swabs were tested for the presence of M. gallisepticum via PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis (49) . Briefly, swabs were placed in 100 l of sterile nuclease-free water. Swabs were then placed at 100°C for 10 min, placed at Ϫ20°C for 10 min, and finally centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. We tested the supernatant of each sample in duplicate for the presence of M. gallisepticum using the forward primer 5= GCTTCCTTGCGGTTAGCAAC 3= and reverse primer 5= GAGCTAATCTGTAAAGTTGGTC 3=. PCR parameters were as follows: 94°C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s, and a final 5-min extension at 72°C (49) . In each assay, M. gallisepticum DNA extracted from pure culture served as a positive control. For all M. gallisepticum-positive samples, we then quantified bacterial loads using the remaining choanal swab extract and a TaqMan qPCR amplification of the M. gallisepticum single-copy gene mgc2. To control for variation in the amount of starting material, we also amplified a house finch single-copy gene, rag1. The detection limit of this assay was previously reported to be less than 10 genomic copies (52) . For HF1995-and Rlow-inoculated individuals, we confirmed the timing or lack of M. gallisepticum colonization by also performing qPCR on samples that were negative for M. gallisepticum at 2 and 7 dpi. To confirm M. gallisepticum clearance, we additionally ran qPCR on the sample collected after the last M. gallisepticum-positive sample for each bird. Before use, we cleaned up extracted swab samples using a Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kit. All reaction mixtures were run on the ABI Prism 7500 system (Applied Biosystems). We made a standard curve of pooled genomic DNA to estimate the relative amounts of M. gallisepticum bacteria between individuals. We then divided the number of mgc2 genes by one-half the number of rag1 genes to approximate the ratio of M. gallisepticum cells (haploid) to host cells (diploid). M. gallisepticum-specific antibody (IgY) detection. Comparisons of M. gallisepticum-specific antibody concentrations in plasma at 7, 14, 21, and 28 dpi were made using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a standard curve of pooled house finch plasma from experimental house finches. Briefly, the goat anti-passerine immunoglobulin Y (IgY) secondary antibody (53) was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) using a Lightning Link HRP kit (Innova Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples and standards were diluted in 1ϫ sample-conjugate diluent (Affinitech, Ltd.), and then 100 l of each was plated in duplicate onto M. gallisepticum-coated plates (Affinitech, Ltd.). After a 1-h incubation at room temperature (RT), plates were washed three times with 1ϫ wash buffer (50 mM Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, with 0.05% Tween 20; Bethyl Laboratories). The HRP-conjugated antibody was diluted 1:10,000 in sample-conjugate diluent (50 mM Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20; Bethyl Laboratories), and 100 l of the diluted antibody was then added to each well. Plates were incubated for 1 h at RT and then washed three times in 1ϫ wash buffer. One hundred microliters of the enzyme substrate 3,3=,5,5=-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) one-component HRP microwell substrate (Bethyl Laboratories) was added to each well, and plates were incubated at RT for 15 min. The reaction was then stopped with 100 l of ELISA stop buffer (0.18 M H 2 SO 4 ; Bethyl Laboratories), and plates were read at 450 nm using a BioTek PowerWave XS plate reader. Samples were considered positive for M. gallisepticum-specific antibodies if the absorbance at 450 nm was at least three times the background. For the pooled standard curve, this cutoff was between dilutions of 1:6,400 and 1:12,800. All samples were run at the same dilution, allowing for comparison of concentrations between treatments based on the pooled standard curve but not determination of absolute concentrations. Because of this, antibody concentrations are reported as ELISA units (EU) per milliliter, with the starting concentration in the undiluted pooled sample being arbitrarily assigned. Statistical analyses. All statistical analyses were conducted in R (http://www.R-project.org/). We tested for differences in the abilities of HF1995 and Rlow to establish an infection using a chi-square test. Differences in the probabilities that birds were infected at 2 dpi were determined using logistic regression, with infection status (infected/not infected) as the response variable and treatment (HF1995 or Rlow) as the explanatory term. Differences in the peak bacterial loads and in the times of clearance of the infection were modeled only in infected individuals by performing Mann-Whitney U tests, with either peak bacterial load or date of clearance as the response variable and with treatment as the explanatory term. We tested for differences in the abilities of HF1995-and Rlow-inoculated birds to clear infection using a chi-square test. Differences in the probabilities of developing clinical symptoms were modeled using logistic regression, with clinical symptoms (0/1) as the response variable and treatment as the explanatory term. We then investigated differences in the severity of conjunctivitis as a function of treatment in symptomatic individuals using only a Mann-Whitney U test, with peak conjunctivitis as the response variable and treatment as the explanatory term. To test for differences in circulating levels of anti-M. gallisepticum antibodies over time (i.e., between 7 and 28 dpi) in infected individuals, we used lme4 and performed a generalized linear mixed-model analysis, with antibody concentration as the response term and with time, treatment, and their interaction as explanatory terms; individual identity was specified as the random effect (54) . All figures were made using ggplot2 (55) .
