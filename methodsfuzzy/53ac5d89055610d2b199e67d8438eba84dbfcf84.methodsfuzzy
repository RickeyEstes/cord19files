A total of forty-four S. aureus isolates (predominantly ampicillin-resistant and β-lactamase positive) were employed. The bacteria were isolated, identified, and had their resistance profiles performed as described in a previous study 1 . Briefly, these isolates were S is the total number of types (strains) described, and n j is the number of isolates belonging to the j th type (strain). This equation was derived as follows. The probability that two isolates sampled consecutively will belong to that type (strain) is: . These probabilities can be summed for all the described types (strains) to determine the probability that any two consecutively sampled isolates will be the same type (strain). This summation can be subtracted G  42  2  2  3  2  1  2  2  2  2  1  4  4  4  3   ET1  H  43  2  2  3  2  1  2  2  2  2  1  4  4  4  3   ET1  E  44  2  2  3  2  1  2  2  2  2  1  4  4  4  3   ET2  A  23  2  2  3  2  1  2  2  2  2  1  3  4  3  3   ET3  A  15  2  2  3  2  1  2  2  2  2  1  3  3  3  2   ET4  G  30  2  2  2  2  1  2  3  2  2  1  3  3  3  3   ET5  L  32  2  2  2  2  1  2  3  2  2  1  3  0  3 Cluster II: 3 highly related isolates 6.8% (isolates 13 ET13 -area C , 14 ET6 -area A , and 16 ET7 -area C ), or 3 highly related ETs 9.1% , including S. aureus ATCC 29213, Cluster III: 2 highly related isolates 4.5% (isolates 12 ET14 -area L and 27 ET18 -area I ), or 2 highly related ETs 6.1% obtained from 2 16.7% areas during ±5 months (from Dec. 5, 2000 to May 29, 2001 ).
