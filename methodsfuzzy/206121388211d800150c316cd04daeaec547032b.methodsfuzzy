Cells and RNA extractions. We infected 4 × 10 5 HuH7 cells 17 (a human hepatoma cell line) and 4 × 10 5 R06E-J cells 18 (an embryonic cell line from R. aegyptiacus) with EBOV (Ebola virus strain Zaire, Mayinga, GenBank: NC_002549) or MARV (Lake Victoria Marburg virus, Leiden, GenBank: JN408064.1 19 ) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of three (Fig. 1A) . We used HuH7 cells because EBOV infections in humans induce the majority of their histopathological features in the liver, and these cells are highly susceptible to filovirus infections 20 . We used immortalized cells because primary cells from bats (macrophages and dendritic cells) are not available in the large quantities we required for our RNA-Seq analyses (9 samples from each cell type). Our analyses consisted of computational and extensive manual investigations as shown in Fig. 2 . At 3, 7 and 23 h p.i., cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These time points correspond to the different stages of the viral replication cycle (Fig. 3) . Replication and transcription take place after 3 h, proteins are produced at 7 h, which may regulate further transcription, and a complete replication cycle occurs after 23 h. DNaseI digestion was performed. At each time point, RNA was also isolated from non-infected (Mock) control cells. Quality controls were performed to ensure proper infection rates and viral propagation. Real-time PCR was used to detect filovirus RNA (polymerase genes) 21 and to demonstrate the amplification of viral RNA over the time course of the infections (Fig. 1B) . Ct-values are inversely proportional to the amount RNA detected, and these values for the MARV-infected HuH7 cells at 3 and 7 h p.i. were lower than the values for the MARV-infected R06E-J cells. The Ct-values for the EBOV-infected cells showed no clear difference. An immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) of the cells was performed using mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against nucleoproteins of EBOV (B6C5, 1:20) and MARV (59-9-10, 1:100). An anti-mouse secondary antibody coupled with Alexa 594 (1:500) was used to detect these viral nucleoproteins, and DAPI (4′ ,6′ -diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining was used to visualize cell nuclei (1 mg/ml, 1:2000) . IFAs of the MARV and EBOV nucleoproteins revealed that a MOI of 3 was sufficient to initially infect a high percentage of cells (90% of human and bat cells infected with EBOV, 70% of bat cells and 99% of human cells infected with MARV, Fig. 1C /D). The quantity and quality of the RNA was assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Nine samples at different time points were generated from human cells (HuH7-Mock-3h, HuH7-Mock-7h, HuH7-Mock-23h, HuH7-EBOV-3h, HuH7-EBOV-7h, HuH7-EBOV-23h, HuH7-MARV-3h, HuH7-MARV-7h, HuH7-MARV-23h) and bat (R06E-J-Mock-3h, R06E-J-Mock-7h, R06E-J-Mock-23h, R06E-J-EBOV-3h, R06E-J-EBOV-7h, R06E-J-EBOV-23h, R06E-J-MARV-3h, R06E-J-MARV-7h, R06E-J-MARV-23h). Sample preparation and sequencing. The total RNA of the 18 samples was shipped to LGC Genomics for the construction of cDNA libraries. Ribo-Zero was used for rRNA depletion, and the Illumina TruSeq kit was used for library construction. Illumina sequencing was performed in a 2 × 100 nt paired-end mode on a HiSeq 2000 system. R06E-J cells were stimulated with interferons, PolyIC or thapsigargin to mimic the induction of the interferon system or a stress response by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the cells. Prior to stimulation, R06E-J cells were examined for interferon competence via a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) bioassay. The cells secreted cytokines after PolyIC transfection, and those cytokines partially protected R06E-J cells from VSV infection (data not shown). RNA was isolated from these cells, pooled with the 9 previously mentioned R. aegyptiacus cell samples and shipped to GATC Biotech for normalization and sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq system (2 × 300 nt mode). This library of longer paired-end reads was used to improve the de novo transcriptome assembly of R. aegyptiacus. All reads were preprocessed based on their Phred quality score. At the 3′ end, bases with a quality score < 20, a 5′ -bias and poly-A tails were removed with PRINSEQ-lite 22 (v0.20.3). Quality was assessed and controlled before and after processing with FastQC 23 (v0.10.1). Genome and annotation data. The human genome GRCh37/hg19 was downloaded from the UCSC 24 ftp server (ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/). The annotation data were obtained from the NCBI (GRCh37 patch release 5) and Ensembl (GRCh37 release 75). The genomic sequence of Pteropus vampyrus (Pva, GCA_000151845.1), the closest related species to R. aegyptiacus (both Megachiroptera) and with well established annotation files, was downloaded from the UCSC site (ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/ pteVam1/) and used for the homology search. The genome sequence of R. aegyptiacus was published in early 2016 by the Boston University School of Medicine. We used all scaffolds and the corresponding annotation data downloaded from the NCBI database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Rousettus_aegyptiacus/) for mapping and differential gene expression analysis. The genomic sequence and annotation data for the Zaire Ebola virus (KM034562.1) were extracted from the UCSC Ebola Genome Portal (ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/ goldenPath/eboVir3/), which is based on the 2014 West African outbreak 25 . Genome and annotation data for the Lake Victoria Marburg virus Leiden (JN408064.1) were obtained from the NCBI-GenBank database. De novo transcriptome assemblies. The nine HiSeq libraries for H. sapiens and R. aegyptiacus underwent quality control assessments and were used for transcriptome assembly (see electronic supplement, Table  ES1A ). Long reads of the pooled MiSeq libraries were included in the assembly process for R. aegyptiacus. For R. aegyptiacus-derived MiSeq paired-end reads (38, 028, 488) were preprocessed and assembled using Mira 32 (v4.0.0). The resulting contigs from each assembly tool were merged together and clustered based on sequence similarities using CD-HIT-EST 33 (-c 0. 95, v4.6) to improve the quality of the final assembly. The final R. aegyptiacus assembly contained 977,787 contigs (human: 986,920 contigs), which is similar to the results of Lee et al. 34 . Of these, 277,595 contigs had a length greater than 1,000 bp. The bat assembly had a maximum contig length of 36,073 bp with an N50 of 3,923. We used QUAST 35 (v2.3) to calculate several statistics for the independent and merged transcriptome assemblies (Table ES1B) .
