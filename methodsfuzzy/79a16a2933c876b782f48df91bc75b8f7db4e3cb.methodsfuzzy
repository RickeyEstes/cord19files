All procedures and facilities described in the following experiment were approved by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Multiparous (8.9 ± 4 yr of age), nonpregnant, crossbred (Simmental × Angus), lactating beef cows with springborn calves at side were used in a 3-yr experiment conducted on smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis) pastures at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Agricultural Research and Development Center located near Mead, Nebraska (41°13′N, 96°29′W; elevation 369 m). In a completely randomized design, cow-calf pairs (n = 16 per year; 4 per pasture) were stratified by total pair BW and assigned randomly within strata to 1 of 2 treatments with 2 replications (pasture) per treatment each year. Across all 3 yr there were a total of 48 cow-calf pairs grazing 12 pasture replicates; data were collected on 16 pairs grazing 4 pastures each year. Treatments consisted of pastures stocked at (1) the recommended stocking rate of 9.46 animal-unit month (AUM)/ha without supplementation (CON) or (2) double the recommended stocking rate (18.9 AUM/ha) with supplementation (SUPP). Pastures were 2.8 and 1.4 ha, respectively. Pastures were fertilized with 90 kg of N/ ha in the spring before the onset of the experiment. Pairs were stocked continuously on smooth bromegrass pastures from early May until mid September annually (130 d).
