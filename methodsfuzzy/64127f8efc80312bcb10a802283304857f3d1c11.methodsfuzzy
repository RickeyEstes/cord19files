As can be seen in Figures 1-7 and 1-8 , manual leukocyte and platelet counts are less precise (CV 15% and 13%, respectively) than automated leukocyte and platelet counts (CV 2% and 4%, respectively). These values do not indicate whether manual or automated methods are more accurate. In fact, the mean manual platelet count is probably more accurate (more near the true platelet count) than the mean automated platelet count because platelets in small platelet clumps can be visualized and counted separately in a hemacytometer chamber but would be counted as one platelet or not counted at all in an automated cell counter. For manual differential leukocyte counts, the CV varies with the percentage of a given leukocyte type present in the blood film and the total number of leukocytes included in the differential leukocyte count. For example, 100 cell differential counts were performed by a single technologist on each of 80 stained coverslip blood films from a dog with a mild basophilia. CVs were calculated from results of 20 randomly
