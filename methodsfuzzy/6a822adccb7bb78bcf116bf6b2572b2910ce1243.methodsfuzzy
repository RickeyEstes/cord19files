An optimized nanoprecipitation method was used to prepare the nanoparticles after the selection tests of different preparation conditions. Tp5 1.0 mg was carefully weighed and dissolved in 10 mL 2.5% Pluronic F68 solution, and then the pH of the solution was adjusted to 2.5 with 0.1 mol/ L HCl. Fifty microliters of PBCA was dropped into the water phase by slow injection while stirring. After stirring for 30 min, the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 7.8 with 0.1 mol/L NaOH, and then kept stirring for another 1 h. The colloid was freeze-dried (Savant Instruments Inc, NY, SNL216V) and stored at Ã€208C before use.
