Cell culture and virus. Vero E6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and glutaminepenicillin-streptomycin solution in 5% CO 2 in humidified air at 37°C. The FFM-1 strain of SARS-CoV was isolated from a SARS patient admitted to the Clinical Centre of Frankfurt University. This strain was used in all experiments to assess the antiviral activity of the drugs. Compounds for screening. A set of compounds for screening consisted of 24 drugs as follows: nelfinavir, saquinavir, KNI-272, TYA5, TYB5, ritonavir, lopinavir, indinavir, 4F-benzoyl-TN14003, 4F-benzoyl-TE14011, TN14003, T140, TC14012, FC131, T22, SDF-1, vMIP-II, TAK-779, SC34, N36, T-20, glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhetic acid, and Cardran sulfate. Cytopathic effect assay. SARS-CoV was inoculated into a monolayer of Vero E6 cells in 24-well plates at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. The plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 for 3 days and CPE in each well was observed. Immunofluorescence assay. The Vero E6 cells in 24-well plates were infected with SARS-CoV at the MOI of 0.01. The infected cells were fixed with methanol 24 h after infection and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with diluted serum sample from a SARS patient. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with anti-human-IgG antibody conjugated with FITC for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS, mounted in buffered glycerol, cover-slipped, and viewed with a fluorescence microscope. RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR assay. SARS-CoV RNA in the culture supernatant was purified with ISOGEN (Nippongene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For quantification of SARS-CoV ORF-1 RNA, we performed real-time RT-PCR with the primers and the probe as follows: ORF1-F, AGCTACGAGCACCAGACACC; ORF1-R, ACTTTGGGCATTCCCCTTT; ORF1-probe, TCGAAA TTAAGAGTGCCAAGAAATTTGACACTTT. The fluorescence intensity generated from the probe was detected by the ABI-7700 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems). MTT assay. Vero E6 cells in 96-well plates were infected with SARS-CoV at the MOI of 0.01. After 36 h of culture, cells were incubated for 4 h in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT). Formazan crystals were dissolved with 100 lL of 0.04 N HCl-isopropyl alcohol (acid isopropanol) and absorbance at 570 nm was measured with a reference wavelength of 655 nm. Time-of-addition experiments. Drugs, including nelfinavir, were added to cultures of Vero E6 cells at the time of infection or 3 h after infection. Samples were processed for a quantitative RT-PCR assay and an immunofluorescence assay 24 h after infection. The cytopathic effect of infected cells was analyzed 36 h after infection. Entry inhibition assay. Vero E6 cells were pretreated with each drug for 3 h, and SARS-CoV was inoculated at the MOI of 0.1. Cells and viruses were incubated for 3 h and washed with PBS three times. Subsequently, infected cells were lysed with ISOGEN (Nippongene) and RNA was purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. Extracted RNA samples were subjected to real-time RT-PCR analysis for quantification of SARS-CoV RNA as described above. As a loading control for normalization, 18S ribosomal RNA was quantified with the primers and the probe as follows: 18S-F, GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT; 18S-R, CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG; and 18S-probe, TGCGTT GATTAAGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTA.
