2.1. Definitions. The definitions of an epitope inferred from the 3D structure of Ag-Ab complex are mainly based on either ASA or the contact area between residues of antigen and antibody. In the first state, an epitope is defined as the surface residue of antigen with ASA decreased more than a given threshold upon binding with the antibody, and 1Å 2 is frequently used. There are some tools to calculate ASA, and the usually used tool is NACCESS [15] or Surface Racer program [16] . In the second state, an epitope is defined as the residue of antigen which has a contact area above a given threshold upon interaction with the antibody, while the value 4Å is frequently used. Among these two ways of definition the second one is generally accepted and applied. Ponomarenko tested in his paper that choosing which way to define epitope may not influence the results [17] . In this paper we define epitopes by the first way. In addition, we consider an amino acid residue as a surface residue if the RSA (relative accessible surface area) of its side chain is greater than 5% with 1.4Å probe radius. The results on the testing dataset of this method are shown in Table 2 . Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, MCC, ACC, and scores were listed. To give a comparison with MimoPro, we also tested MimoPro and listed the performance measures together with the new method. As seen from Table 2 , the number of predicted epitope of this method was less than MimoPro for most cases, and it leads to the improvement of the specificity of the new method. The average specificity score on testing dataset has reached 81% which is higher than MimoPro. The average sensitivity score of this method decreased slightly, and the reason is that there is no validated feature or feature combination that can distinguish epitope residues from nonepitope residues completely so far. That is, the removed residues which we took as "nonepitope" residues in the step of antigen preprocessing may contain more or less true epitope residues. Taking vascular endothelial growth factor (PDB id: 1BJ1) as an example, the native epitope includes two consecutive segments (I80 M81 R82 I83 K84, and H86 Q87 G88 Q89 H90 I91 G92 E93 M94) and five isolated amino acids (F17 Y21 Y45 K48 Q79). In the step of antigen preprocessing, 15 residues were removed (20V 27H 28P 40P 42E 47F 56R 58G 67E 68C 71T 78M 82R 98Q 100N), including R82, which is the true epitope residue. While predicted only by MimoPro, 32 candidate epitope residues (V33 D34 F36 Q37 E38 Y39 P40 D41 E42 I43 E44 Y45 I46 F47 K48 P49 S50 C51 M78 M81 R82 I83 K84 P85 Q87 G88 Q89 H90 G92 E93 M94 S95) were predicted which covers the residue R82. The new method predicted one less true epitope residue than MimoPro. Hence, the sensitivity of the new method is slightly lower than MimoPro. However, sensitivity and specificity are not complete for evaluating the performance of one method. The PPV have more predictive validity. As seen from Table 2 , the average PPV values of this method were higher than that of MimoPro, which not only illustrated that the overall performance of this method is superior to MimoPro but also indicated that the improvement of this study is effective. Further, we draw Figure 2 to give directly relations between sensitivity and 1− specificity of this method. From Figure 2 , we can see that for most test cases this method can precisely localize epitope regions. The predicted results of the method are totally better than random prediction. For 3BT1 and 2HYM, the two points on the -axis, the method displayed no predictive ability. The main reason is that the second step of the method predicts no epitope residues according to mapping the mimotopes to the surface of the antigen. We use RF from Weka for classifying antigen surface residues in this work. To answer whether different machine learning method would influence the prediction performance of the method, we also employed SVM for classifying the surface amino acids of antigen, and latest version of LibSVM [30] was exploited in this work. For both methods, we tried lots Protein-protein interaction Table 3 . For RF, we tested lots of combinations of parameters. Table 3 listed three results with top three PPV scores. For SVM, we deal with this imbalance through three ways: partition of the training data into blocks as introduced by Fu et al. [32] , setting a weight value for positive instances, and both. In addition, binary-class cross validation with AUC was used. Table 3 gave the best results for each solution. As seen from Table 3 , no matter if we use RF or SVM for Protein-protein interaction antigen preprocessing, the performance of the new method performed better than MimoPro whose results have been listed in Table 2 . Moreover, we can see that the predicted ability of RF on the testing dataset was better than SVM, and this is the reason why we chose RF in the module of antigen preprocessing. Then compared with the different parameters combination of RF, we chose = 5, = 0, and = 1 which gave the highest values of PPV for RF in the antigen preprocessing. In recent years, there are several mimotope-based methods that have been proposed to predict conformational B-cell epitopes. In this work, we compared the new method with three other available mimotope-based conformational B-cell epitope prediction methods: PepSurf, EpiSearch, and Pep-3D-Search. These methods were tested in April of 2014, and the default parameters were adopted for each method. Figures 3, 4 , 5, and 6 give the sensitivity, PPV, ACC, and of each method on the testing dataset. 1ZTX, 1JRH, and 1WLP have no prediction results by EpiSearch due to the restriction of the method that the number of mimotope sequences cannot be larger than 30. Further, we calculate the average values of these performance measures using the testing dataset for each method, respectively. Table 4 gives the overall performance for each method. As shown in Table 4 , the sensitivity of our method achieves 0.44 which is the same as the Pep-3D-Search and the highest among the 4 methods. The specificity is slightly lower than the EpiSearch which has the best specificity measure of Figure 6 : The of each method on the testing dataset. 0.83 on this testing dataset. However, the new method was rated the best with a PPV of 0.33 which is improved a lot than the other methods. In general, our new method demonstrates overall higher prediction accuracy than MimoPro and other three mimotope-based conformational B-cell epitope prediction methods on the testing dataset.
