2.1. Plant material, ethanolic extraction, aqueous-EA fractionation, and flavonoids of H. cordata The aerial parts (fresh leaves) of H. cordata were collected from a farm in Johor, Malaysia and authenticated in the Department of Pharmacology, National University of Singapore. The voucher specimen of H. cordata was deposited in the Singapore Botanic Gardens and assigned the identification number SING2011-203. Prior to extraction, the herb (dry weight of 500 g) was washed with de-ionized water, homogenized to a fine powder, and soaked overnight in 80% (v/v) ethanol. The next day, the ethanolic extract was removed and stored. More solvent was added to the blended herb, which was left to soak till exhaustion. The extract was filtered, concentrated with a rotary evaporator (Buchi Rotavapor R-144) and freeze-dried to yield 19.28 g of crude extract in powder form. The crude extract was then dissolved in EA and de-ionized water. The water and EA phases were separated with a separating funnel. The EA phase was concentrated with a rotary evaporator, and the concentrated EA fraction was subsequently stored at âˆ’80 C overnight and freeze-dried. The flavonoids tested were quercetin dihydrate (98% HPLC), quercitrin, and rutin hydrate (95%), all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
