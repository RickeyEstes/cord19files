Cells and cultures. Axenic HM1: IMSS trophozoites were maintained in TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with 15% of adult bovine serum (Biofluids International Inc., MD, USA) and 3% of Diamond's vitamin mix (JRH Biosciences, Kansas, USA) in anaerobic conditions and incubated at 37°C . Trophozoites virulence was maintained trough successive passages into hamster´s liver and recovering trophozoites from the induced ALA. sf9 insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda) (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) were cultivated as monolayer or suspension in Grace's medium (Invitrogen, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1% penicillin/ streptomycine (100U/ml) and 0,1% pluronic F-68 (Invitrogen, USA) and maintained in anaerobic conditions at 27°C. Cultures in suspension were additionally maintained with constant shaking at 100 rpm. HepG2 cells from ATCC were cultivated in DMEM medium +L-glutamine (Invitrogen, USA) supplemented with FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycine and maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. AcNPV-LC3 baculovirus production. The LC3 coding region (amino acid 773 to 1127) of the Gal-lectin heavy subunit (8) was amplified from E. histolytica HM1: IMSS DNA using the following primers: sense primer FLC3HCMV (5 ' TAGAAAGCTTATGTGTTCTAGTTTAACATGTCCA -3') and antisense primer RSLC3XCMV (5 ' TTTTTCTAGATTAACATGTTTTCTTTGTGTAAATA G-3'). The PCR product was cloned into Hind III/XbaI sites of plasmid pBlueCMV (42) to generate the construct pBlueCMV-LC3. The LC3 product and the construct were checked for integrity of the ORF by sequencing in an automatic sequencer ABI-Prism 2.0. The recombinant baculovirus AcNPV-LC3 was generated by recombination of the CMV-LC3 cassette with AcNPV DNA following the manufacturer´s instructions of the Bac-N-Blue Transfection Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Recombinant AcNPV-LC3 was identified by reconstitution of the lacZ gene and β-galactosidase expression determined by addition of 5-bromine-4-chlorine-3-indolil--D-galactoside (X-gal) (150 g/ml) to infected sf9 cell supernatants. Viral DNA was isolated from positive supernatant following the manufacturer´s instructions of the Bac-N-Blue Transfection Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Presence of the LC3 fragment was confirmed by PCR amplification and its sequence confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant AcNPV-LC3 baculovirus was amplified by infecting sf9 insect cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 and purifying them from cul-ture´s supernatants 6 days after infection by centrifugation at 6,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. Afterwards, baculovirus was concentrated by ultracentrifugation in a SW28 rotor (Beckman) at 141, 000 g and 4°C during 90 min, resuspended in PBS, loaded onto a 10-50% (wt/vol) sucrose gradient and centrifuged at same conditions. Finally, the virus-containing interphase layer was collected, diluted in PBS, centrifuged as before and the pelleted virus titered by using a plaque assay following the manufacturer´s instructions (Invitrogen). Wild type virus (AcNPV-WT) was amplified and titered following the same protocol as for AcNPV-LC3.
