In all, 110 patients with clinician-diagnosed COPD exacerbation were screened according to the strategies illustrated in Figure 1 from January to June 2014 in our hospital. Among them, 81 eligible patients were enrolled. The AECOPD is defined as an acute event characterized by a worsening of respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, sputum purulence, or sputum volume) that is beyond normal day-to-day variations, and leads to a change in medication. 7 Patients with an established history of COPD were recruited, with a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio ,70% at diagnosis. Standardized pulmonary function test was performed with a dry spirometer device (Erich Jaeger GmbH, Hoechberg, Germany) at 15 minutes after inhaling salbutamol 400 Âµg (Ventolin, GlaxoS-mithKline, London, UK), and the FVC, FEV 1 , and FEV 1 /FVC ratio were recorded. In addition, the patients should be able to understand and complete the CAT independently. Exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with a primary diagnosis of asthma, bronchiectasis or other active chronic respiratory disease requiring treatments, interventions or diagnostics, or any other severe or uncontrolled co-morbidities; patients with mental disorders or any other condition associated with an immuno-inflammatory response; and patients who had received antibiotic or corticosteroids during the past 4 weeks. This study was approved by the ethical committee of Anhui Medical University, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
