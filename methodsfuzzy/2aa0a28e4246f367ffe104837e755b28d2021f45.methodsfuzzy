This analysis and report was approved by the Institutional Medical Ethical Committee. Clinical and laboratorial data at admission and during ICU stay are described, including the management of respiratory support and nonventilatory strategies. Data for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) and for the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) were reported as the worst value within 24 h after ICU admission. A daily evaluation of organ function according to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was performed Radiological findings were evaluated through X-ray in all patients and computerized tomography when appropriate. The in vivo diagnosis of H1N1 infection was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) test using nasopharyngeal swab specimens, in accordance with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [10] . autopsies Five patients who died had their autopsies performed in the Department of Pathology of the Universidade de Sao Paulo. The pathological findings on part of this population have been previously described by our group [11] . Tissue fragments were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded and hematoxylin-eosin stained. For lung sections, Grocott, Brown-Hopps and Ziehl-Neelsen stainings were performed for the identification of fungi, bacteria and acid-fast bacilli, respectively. Lung fragments were sent for microbiological investigation using rRT-PCR to the Instituto Adolfo Lutz in Sao Paulo. Seasonal influenza A and swine influenza A detection was performed using the CDC protocol [10] . The RT-PCR test used for bacteria identified DNA from Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. results baseline characteristics Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the eight patients. Patient ages ranged from 55 to 65 years (median, 58 years). Four patients (50%) were male. All patients (100%) had preexisting medical conditions other than the neoplasm. Most of the patients presented no functional impairment before the infection-seven patients (87.5%) had Karnofsky scale >70. Five patients (62.5%) had solid neoplasms and three patients (37.5%) had hematological malignancies. Two patients had been submitted to chemotherapy in the last 4 weeks (Table 1) . However, most patients were considered as having active disease regarding cancer status (seven patients, 87.5%). Four patients (50%) had metastatic disease. The patient with myelofibrosis had been submitted to stem-cell transplantation 1 year ago. All patients presented cough and fever, most patients had myalgia and dyspnea (87.5%). Hemoptysis, rhinorrhea and wheezing were present in 25% and diarrhea was related by 12.5% of patients.
