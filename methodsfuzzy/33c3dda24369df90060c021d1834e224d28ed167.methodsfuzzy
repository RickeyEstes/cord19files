A virus isolate obtained from an infected patient was inoculated in human lung fibroblast (HLF) cells. The protein mixtures were extracted from unknown virus-infected cells and mock-infected control cells. In the initial experiment, two sample sets were first separated by conventional two-dimensional gel electrophoresis techniques (2-DE). Only one unique protein spot was visualized through comparison of the 2-DE of infected to uninfected cell lysate (Fig. 1) . The protein corresponding to the spot was identified as vaccinia virus-encoded protein E3 after in-gel trypsin digestion followed by LC/MSMS analysis of extracted peptides, consistent with the results obtained by a DNase-SISPA sequencing method and an epidemiologic investigation that the patient was infected by a smallpox vaccine-strain vaccinia virus (Anonymous, 2007) . The samples were then analyzed by a 2D-DIGE method, a proteomic technique developed recently. The infected cell lysate was labeled with Cy5, whereas the lysate from uninfected control cells was labeled with Cy3. The mixture of labeled sample pair was resolved in a single 2D gel. The fully resolved spots are shown in Fig. 2 , which was generated by overlapping two fluorescent images corresponding to the protein profiles of the infected and control samples. The yellow spots in the image represent the overlapping a Probability based mowse score that indicates the quality of the MS/MS peptide fragment ion matches. Fig. 2 . Two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) of protein mixtures extracted from infected and control cells. The infected sample is labeled with Cy5 (displayed as red color) and the uninfected sample with Cy3 (displayed as green color). of red (infected) and green (control), indicating an equivalent or similar abundance of proteins in both uninfected and infected cells. In contrast, the red-colored spots suggest the protein was specific to the infected cell lysate and spots with intermediate shades of yellow and red probably corresponds to differential levels of host protein expression in response to infection. With the aim for detecting the infectious pathogen(s), this study focused mainly on the proteins identified solely in infected cells with the expectation that they might be virus-encoded proteins. Eight red spots were selected for in-gel trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry analysis, as described in the methods section. The tryptic digests of each spot were analyzed by the LC coupled tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using a Q-TOF MS instrument. Fig. 3 shows a typical tandem mass spectrum of the peptides digested from the protein of spot 1. As shown in Fig. 3 , the high-quality mass spectrum containing a complete series of ytype fragment ions allows the unambiguous identification of the peptide, NIGIEGATAAQLTR, derived from trypsin digestion of Protein E3 of the vaccinia virus. Using the MASCOT algorithm against the NCBInr database, five of the eight proteins from the selected gel spots were identified as viral proteins of smallpox vaccinia virus (Table 1) . Any matched peptides with low probability scores were double-checked by manual inspection to avoid false positive results. In order to characterize further the isolate, sequence analysis or alignment on all identified viral proteins was conducted. In the search of the NCBInr database, one set of peptides could match to one or more proteins, including isomers that share the sequences of identified peptides. The mass spectra data sets of the spots 4, 5, and 8 resulted in three viral proteins (glutaredoxin-1, -2 and 14 kDa fusion protein) that could be from either vaccinia virus or other poxvirus species because the sequences of these virus-encoded proteins are either highly conserved or the virusor strain-specific regions were not included in the identified peptides (data not shown). In contrast, the data of spots 1 and 2 were found to be vaccinia virus-encoded protein E3 and B2. Fig. 4 shows the alignment of protein E3s among all poxvirus and strains where identical sequences were grouped into one row. As indicated by underlined amino acids, the peptides detected in the Fig. 3 . A typical MS/MS spectrum of a peptide detected from the digested protein in spot 1 as shown in the Fig. 2 . y-type ions represent the C-terminal fragments of the peptide whereas b-and a-type ions designate N-terminal fragments (Roepstorff and Fohlman, 1984) . regions of E3 had almost all of the amino acid variations suggestive of the Copenhagen strain (VAVC COP E3L). However, a minor difference in the E3 sequences between the Copenhagen strain and the other two strains in the group of VACV ACAM2000 was noted during manual inspection. Their protein sequences are almost identical except a swap of the alanine and valine at the position 83 and 89. The peptide at m/z 938.08 was identified as VAVC COP E3L peptide 66-96 (WFMTTEADKPDADAMADVIIDDVSR), by MASCOT database searching, that included the amino acid residues at these two positions. However, the sequence of this peptide was further determined to be derived from VAVC ACAM2000 encoded protein E3 by mass spectrometric analysis of two synthetic peptides (Fig. 5) . The tandem mass spectrum of the peptide digested from the gel spot matches the spectrum of the synthetic peptide derived from the protein of VACV ACAM2000 rather than the one of Copenhagen strain. Therefore, the strain-specific identification of the infectious pathogen can be narrowed down confidently to two vaccinia virus strains, VACV ACAM2000 (AY313847) and VACV MVA (U94848), included in the VACV ACAM2000 group (Fig. 4) . In order to develop an alternative proteomics method for detecting infective virus, a different approach named GeLC-MS/MS was explored in the present study. Proteins extracted from infected cells were first separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE gel and the gel lane containing proteins in the range of approximate 10-50 kDa was excised into 25 equally spaced gel slices (Fig. 7) . Nanocapillary LC-MS/MS analysis of the peptides generated from in-gel digestion of all gel bands resulted in the identification of a total of 274 proteins. The majority of the identifications are host cellular proteins (data not shown) but eight vaccinia virus viral proteins were detected, indicating that GeLC-MS/MS method is also capable of providing identity information of on a certain virus infection (Table 2) .
