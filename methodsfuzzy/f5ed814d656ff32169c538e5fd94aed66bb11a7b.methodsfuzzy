Production and purification of HAstV-8 The astrovirus strain Yuc8 was isolated from a natural infection and adapted to grow in Caco-2 cells. 4 To propagate the virus, we washed the cells twice with minimal essential medium without fetal bovine serum and inoculated them with Yuc8, previously treated with 200 μg/ml of trypsin for 1 h, followed by a 1-h treatment with soybean trypsin inhibitor at the same concentration. Infected cells were incubated at 37°C and harvested 1 day post-infection. The cells were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles and extracted once with an equal volume of Genetron 113 (trichlorotrifluoroethane). From this point, every step was carried out at 4°C, and solutions were maintained in an ice-water bath. The aqueous phase obtained after centrifugation at 5000g for 30 min was pelleted via ultracentrifugation for 4 h at 85,000g (Beckman SW28 rotor). The pellet was resuspended in TNE buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 M NaCl, and 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid] and layered onto a cesium chloride solution (1.36 g/ml). A density gradient was formed during ultracentrifugation for 16-18 h at 110,000g (Beckman SW50.1 rotor), and the opalescent band corresponding to viral particles was collected and diluted in TNE buffer. The final pellet was isolated by ultracentrifugation of this suspension for 2.5 h at 150,000g (Beckman SW50.1 rotor), which was resuspended in TNE buffer and stored at 4°C. Infectivity assays and protein analysis of trypsin-treated virus were performed to ensure the identity of the purified particles. 11 Production and purification of HAstV-1 Monolayers of a continuous line of colon carcinoma cells (Caco-2) were infected with HAstV serotype 1 (Oxford strain) that was initially adapted to grow in a continuous line of monkey kidney epithelial cells (LLCMK2). Virus propagation required the addition of trypsin (10 μg/ml, type IX; Sigma) to the culture medium (RPMI 1640). At 48 h post-infection, cells were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles, and the lysates were partially purified by fluorocarbon extraction and differential centrifugation. The viral pellets were solubilized in TNMC buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 mM CaCl 2 ]. The suspensions were then layered on a cesium chloride density gradient (1.37 g/ml). Following isopycnic centrifugation, the fraction containing peak enzyme immunoassay activity corresponded to a density of 1.37 g/ml. This fraction was diluted 10-fold with TNMC buffer, and viral particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation for 2.5 h at 4°C (150,000g).
