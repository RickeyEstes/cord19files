Department of Microbiology, Medical School, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece PCR is becoming the new standard for virological diagnosis of the infections of the central nervous system (CNS). Use of this test has been shown to have the impact on patient management as measured by shortened patient stays and reduction of empirical therapy administration. This study aimed at reporting our experience over the last years in the detection and management of herpesviruses and enteroviruses (EVs) induced CNS infections by using PCR assays. A total of 127 consecutive CSF specimens from patients hospitalized between April 2001 and August 2004 to the University Hospital of Ioannina with clinically suspected viral CNS infection were tested for the presence of the herpesvirus and EV genome using Herpes Consensus and Enterovirus Consensus assays (Argene Biosoft, France). The Herpes Consensus assay allowed the simultaneously amplification of the six major herpesviruses in a single PCR: herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV1, HSV2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). The Enterovirus Consensus assay allowed the reverse transcription and amplification of all 64 prototypes of EVs. Amplified products were detected by microplate hybridization. The specificity and sensitivity of the assays were evaluated with samples from three external control proficiency panels. Overall, 42 (33%) of the CSF samples tested were positive in the PCR. HSV1 was detected in one adult (0.8%) with encephalitis, VZV was detected in one adult (0.8%) with meningitis, and EVs were detected in 40 children (31.5%) with meningitis and/or encephalitis. None of the specimens tested was positive for HSV2, CMV, EBV and HHV-6 genomes. From the 42 positive CSF specimens, none presented herpesvirus and EVs coinfection in the CNS The precise diagnosis of viral CNS infections was available within 24-48 h, which allowed for a better clinical management of the patients in terms of the duration of hospitalization and the specific therapeutic intervention. In conclusion the Consensus PCR methodology enabled the rapid detection of the herpesviruses and EVs in CSF and provided a reliable, noninvasive tool in the diagnosis of viral CNS infections.

Bacteriologie, CHU, Besancon, France Background: Combination therapy is recommended in serious Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in order to rapidly clear bacterial inoculums and to prevent the emergence of resistance. However, assessment of drug interactions by standard methods (checkerboard, killing curves) is time consuming and operator-dependent. Here, we report a simple E-test method for the study of drug combinations on bacteremic P. aeruginosa. Methods: Synergism between (i) piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) or ceftazidime (CAZ) and (ii) amikacin (AN) or ciprofloxacin (CIP) was tested on 110 genotypically distinct bacteremic P. aeruginosa isolates from six French university hospitals (GESPA participants). E-test strips were set side by side (TZP/AN, TZP/CIP, CAZ/AN, CAZ/CIP), MIC against MIC, onto Mueller Hinton agar plates inoculated with standardized incoculums. After 1 h at room temperature, the AN and the CIP strips were removed and the plates were incubated 24 h at 37 • C. Synergism was defined as a decrease of ©¬−lactam MIC ≥ 2 dilutions in the presence of 1 MIC of AN or CIP. Drug combinations found strongly synergistic with the E-Test method were reevaluated with the checkerboard technique. Results: Drug interactions were synergistic, indifferent/additive, or antagonistic in 40 (36.3%), 70 (63.7%), and 0 strains, respectively. Overall, the ©¬−-lactam/AN combinations were more often synergistic (30%) than the ©¬−-lactam/CIP combinations (11.8%). The synergistic rates were 29.2% for TZP/AN, 16.9% for CAZ/AN, 10.4% for TZP/CIP and 7.5% for CAZ/CIP. Synergism occurred essentially in strains resistant to both of the paired antibiotics compared with fully susceptible strains: 100% versus 7% for CAZ/AN, 58.5% versus 15.3% for TZP/AN, 26.6% versus 3% for CAZ/CIP, and 20% versus 4.5% for TZP/CIP. The results of the E-test method for detecting synergism appeared to agree fairly well with those from the checkerboard technique (17/20 strains). Conclusion: The side-by-side E-test method offers many advantages for routine determination of drug interactions on P. aeruginsoa. It is easy to perform and provides reliable, reproducible results within 48 h. Our study confirms that interactions are synergistic mostly on strains resistant to the combined drugs.

University General Hospital ATTIKON¨, 4th Department of Internal Medicine, University of Athens, Athens, Greece Objectives: To evaluate the sensitivity of disk diffusion test with cefoxitin (30 mcg) in the detection of methicillin resistant CNS compared with minimal inhibitory concentration test (MIC) since during the last decade CNS emerged as significant clinical pathogens in serious infections. Methods: Susceptibility tests were performed after determining MIC test according to NCCLS guidelines and cefoxitin disc of 30 gr (Kirby Bauer, BD sensi-disc; Becton Dickinson) in 35 • C. An inhibition zone diameter ≤24 mm indicated methicillin resistance whereas>24 mm indicated methicillin sensitivity according to NCCLS guidelines. All strains with MIC 0.5-1 g/ml were investigated for the presence of mecA gene with PCR using mec A1(5 -AAATCGATGGTAAAGGTTGGC-3 ) and mec A2 (5 -AGTTCTGCAGTACCGGATTTGC-3 ) primers. Results: From a total of 380 CNS isolates, 128 (33%) were methicillin sensitive (MIC ≤ 0.25 g/ml) and 205 (53%) methicillin resistant (MIC ≥ 2 g/ml) while 47 (14%) presented with a range of 0.25 g/ml < MIC <2 g/ml. In 137 isolates with MIC ≥ 2 or MIC ≤ 0.25, cefoxitin disc (30 g) inhibition zone diameter and MIC were correlated as follows: Nocardiosis is an infection associated with severe morbid conditions especially in immunocompromised patients. The diagnosis, presently based on direct examination and conventional cultures, is difficult, time consuming and often delayed or prevented due to the relatively slow growth of these bacteria, and the empiric therapeutic decision before sampling. The objective of this study was to develop a PCR-based assay for the rapid detection of Nocardia directly from human clinical samples. The technique consisted in a 16S-specific amplification combined with a chemiluminescent hybridization. The probe was obtained by PCR from DNA of the type strain Nocardia asteroidesATCC 19247 T . DNA extraction and amplification from specimens (bronchoalveolar liquid, skin biopsy and cerebral abscess) seeded with serial dilutions of Nocardia asteroides ATCC 19247 T allowed the evaluation of the analytical sensitivity of the assay which reached 10 3 CFU/reaction after agarose gel electrophoresis and 1 CFU/reaction after transfer and hybridization. The applicability of the PCR assay to diagnose human nocardiosis was evaluated by investigating eighteen clinical human samples. For patients with nocardiosis confirmed by conventional cultures, clinical specimens were positive with a sharp chemiluminescent signal after hybridization. No amplification was observed for 20 clinical samples from patients with confirmed tuberculosis used as a negative control. These results highlighted the high specificity and sensibility of the PCR protocol presented in this study. It appeared useful in the rapid diagnosis of nocardiosis directly from clinical samples without culture, resulting in timely and appropriate clinical management that can amount to significant savings for patients. and this technique became current in routine. We tested hybridization protected ARNr or HPA (Gen-Probe) compared to standards techniques (direct immunofluorescence) (Direct IFD) for C. trachomatis, examination and culture for N. gonorrhoae). The doubtful or conflicting tests were confirmed by a technique of competition (PCA). We studied 208 patients (144 endo-cervical samples and 64 urethral samples). Our results were analysed statistically. In woman, 21 cases of C. trachomatis were diagnosed (14.58%) and two cases of N. gonorrhoae (1.38%). In man, 10 cases of C. trachomatis were diagnosed (15.62%) and five cases of N. gonorrhoae (7.81%). In conclusion, the technique of HPA enabled us to improve the diagnosis of these two types of bacteria, which could be underestimated by the standards methods. Objective: Rapid appropriate antibacterial treatment is important to improve the prognosis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococccus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. RT-PCR can identify S. aureus (Sa) and detect methicillin resistance. We used it directly in positive blood culture (BC) bottles with Gram positive cocci (GPC) upon direct smear examination (DSE) to provide clinicians with fast and accurate results and evaluate the impact of these results on treatment changes and appropriateness. Phase III multicentre open study, randomized in 2 arms, in tx naive HIV infected pts. A self-report Patient Medication Adherence Questionnaire (PMAQ) was administered in the five English-speaking countries every 12 weeks or upon early withdrawal. Pill counts for either FPV or NFV were collected at each visit, except weeks 1 and 2. A sub-analysis of pts who failed virologically & had completed the PMAQ assessed the incidence of virological failure according to the level of adherence. Results: Six hundred and sixty pts included, 322 receiving FPV/r and 327 NFV BID. At baseline: median plasma HIV RNA level = 4.78 log 10 cp/mL [2.65-7.29] & 4.83 log 10 cp/mL [3.11-6.74], median CD4 count = 166 c/mm 3 [1-813] and 177 c/mm 3 [1-1055]. At W48: VL < 400 cp/mL in 68% and 65% pts in intention to treat analysis (ITT M = F) respectively, median CD4 count rise = +203 c/mm 3 [−36, +672] and +207 c/mm 3 [−67, +1005]. Rate of success was comparable between the two arms; however, the rate of virological failure is 4% with FPV/r QD versus 15% with NFV BID. The incidence of mutations in pts experiencing tx failure was statistically different between FPV/r & NFV: zero versus 50% 1 ary or 2 ary protease mutations, 13% versus 56% reverse transcriptase mutations (p < 0.001). The PMAQ, completed by 268 pts, indicated few barriers to adherence. While no significance testing was completed, more pts reported perfect adherence scores with FPV/r versus NFV, both at week 24 (90% versus 83%) & W48 (89% versus 85%). Among the virological failure population, 18% reported perfect adherence in the FPV/r arm (majority of failures occurred <90% adherence) versus 57% with NFV (& mutations occurred at all levels of adherence). Discussion and conclusion: dosing convenience, low pill count and absence of food restriction can be related to better adherence with FPV/r. The fewer virological failures with FPV/r versus NFV and the apparent absence of correlation between these failures and the level of adherence suggest greater potency and a higher resistance barrier of this boosted regimen.
