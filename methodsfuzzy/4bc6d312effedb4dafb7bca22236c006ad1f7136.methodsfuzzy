In the simplest formulation of the renewal equation [11] , the epidemic grows exponentially to infinity. Wu et al [3] reported that some interventions had been taken to control the continuing infection such as isolating affected patients in hospitals, placing members of these cases' families and other contacts under medical observations, and recommending pupils to take basic hygiene measures. These and other interventions should have been involved during the outbreak and they might start at different times. Here we model the interventions by simplifying the complex processes and assume that they collectively acted to make a change in contact rate and thus transmissibility at some time point t c . Let c t be the number of cases whose symptom onset at day t, its expected value is approximated by Here w s represent the probability mass function of the serial interval of length s days, which can be obtained by with G(.) representing the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution. After the turning point t c , the reproductive number reduces from R 0 to R c . Here R 0 represents the reproductive number in the absence of any control or susceptible depletion and the value of R c shows the impact of countermeasures. Neglecting depletion of susceptibles is justified by the fact that the number of infected individuals is very small compared to the total number of pupils (28 vs 698). (It is worth noticing that in statistical estimation methods all infections are assumed to be symptomatic) This allows using of R 0 instead of the instantaneous reproductive number (the average number of people someone infected at time t can infect over their entire infectious lifespan) as originally used in [11] . More complicated modifications have been proposed for the renewal equation to reflect the outbreaks that will finish with many individuals still being susceptible (e.g., [12] ). We assume that the variation in daily case counts is captured by Poisson distribution (c.f. [13] ). Given the serial interval, the three parameters to be estimated are the reproductive numbers R 0 and R c and the turning point t c . Within the Bayesian framework, Monte-Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) samplings are used to obtain their posterior distributions. General growth rate method. We consider a general-growth model [14] to characterise the ascending phase of the outbreak by assuming the incidence ΔC(t) at day t is given by where C(t) describes the cumulative number of cases at day t, r is a positive parameter denoting the growth rate, and pϵ[0.1] is a 'deceleration of growth' parameter (dimensionless). When p = 1, it describes exponential growth in the Malthus equation: C(t) = C 0 exp(rt). Here C 0 is the initial number of cases. The basic reproductive number, R 0 exp for exponential growth [15] , can be approximated by the average number of secondary cases generated by initial cases during the first generation interval T g (assumed to be fixed) as, For sub-exponential growth models (i.e., 0 p<1), Chowell et al [14] illustrated an equivalent approach to derive the relevant formulae of R 0 . As in Renewal equation method, the three parameters r, p and C 0 will be estimated by Bayesian inference, and the reproductive number can be further obtained. Using renewal Eq (4), the MCMC simulations suggest that under the serial interval distribution of mean = 23.9 days and SD = 20.9 days, the countermeasure is collectively started from day 77 with 95% confidence interval [72,81] from 10 Mar 2011 (i.e., 26 May 2011 (22, 30 May 2011)), which is just before the peak of the daily incidence (see Fig 2 of [3] ). The reproductive number before this turning point is R 0 = 2.82 [1.70, 4 .50]; after this point, it reduces to R c = 0.17 [0.05, 0.50], indicating transmission is well under control (Fig 2) .
