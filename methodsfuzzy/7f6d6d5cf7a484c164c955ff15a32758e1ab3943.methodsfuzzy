Using purposive sampling, 39 PGY students receiving training from August 2013 to July 2014 in the General Surgery of the Tri-Service General Hospital were selected as the participants of this study. The clinical teacher uploaded the core curriculum slides, unit teaching videos, and related learning information to the hospital intranet to assist students in preparing before class; this was followed by class discussions to foster a thinking mode of active learning. Twoway assessments were conducted during the course and multidimensional assessments and satisfaction surveys were administered after the course; the results were compared with the PYG students of the previous year to evaluate the learning outcomes of the students learning under the flipped classroom model. The control group included 43 students of the previous year, that is, the year before the intervention of the flipped classroom. This study analyzed the outcomes of PGY students' cognition of and persistent behavior in learning through the intervention of the flipped classroom. The theory of reasoned action was considered to design the study's theoretical foundation (Fig 1) . The theory of reasoned action, developed by Fishbein and Ajzen in 1967, enables the prediction of individual behaviors, attitudes, and intentions. It has its theoretical base in social psychology, which considers an overall view of the dependent relationship between attitude, intention, and behavior. Through continuous development and verification, Fishbein and Ajzen proposed the notion of subjective norms and constructed a complete framework of the four in 1980 [10, 11] . Thus, the theory of reasoned action maintains that behavioral intention, the decisive factor directly affecting an individual's actions, will be influenced by "attitude" and "subjective norms." As for the behavioral influence produced by other factors, they can all indirectly influence behavior through behavioral intention. Therefore, when an individual's attitude toward behavior is more positive, his behavioral intention will be higher and when his attitude toward behavior is more negative, his behavioral intention will be lower. According to the theory of reasoned action (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975), behavioral change begins with a change in an individual's belief; in other words, if an individual believes that he/ she should perform a certain behavior, this behavior will occur. Belief represents an individual's volitional control over his/her behavior, thus indicating that the production of behavior is itself a behavior performed by an individual after making a decision on whether or not to perform [a behavior] or depending on other decisions based on his/her belief formed through logical thinking. This theory assumes that an individual will not be influenced by external environments; thus, a supportive thought can represent an individual's behavior. Ajzen and Fishbein (1980) defined an individual's attitude toward performing a certain behavior as the possibility and good evaluation of the probable outcomes of the particular behavior. Thus, attitude can be explained in terms of two dimensions: behavior belief and outcome evaluation. An individual's awareness of the social pressure involved in whether or not to perform a particular behavior is a function of normative belief and motivation to comply: Normative belief refers to an individual's belief of the perceived behavioral expectations of important referent objects. Motivation to comply refers to an individual's motivation to comply with these important referent objects. The questionnaire for this study was designed following Fishbein and Ajzen's (1980) method, as they were the first to use an open-ended questionnaire to sift out significant beliefs. We compiled the questionnaire based on the significant beliefs acquired through the openended questionnaire, and after consulting related literature within and without Taiwan and discussing the findings with professor Chang. and Chen. Who takes in charge of PGY training program for more than 10 years. The questionnaire included basic information on behavioral intention, attitude, subjective norms, behavior belief, outcome evaluation, motivation to comply, normative belief, self-efficacy, and external variables. We revised the first draft of the questionnaire based on the experts' comments. To know the participants' understanding of the questions in the questionnaire, their reactions to answering it, the circumstances of the actual visits, and matters demanding attention and to assess the time required for answering the questionnaire, we selected eight to ten students from each year through stratified random sampling. Forty participants took the test, with 35 valid questionnaires being collected. The pretest process simulated the formal test in which the students were encouraged to raise questions and point out questions whose meanings were obscure or difficult to answer; these were recorded to enable us to understand the difficulties students faced when answering the questionnaire. The pretest results indicated that 25 mins were required to complete the questionnaire. After collecting the questionnaires, Cronbach's α was immediately applied to test the reliability of each scale; these results are shown in Table 1 . As shown in Table 2 , the questionnaire was subsequently finalized after making appropriate revisions based on pilot test result analysis, the test takers' opinions on answering the questionnaire, and the item analysis results. After collecting the test data from the formal questionnaire, we coded, collated, and stored the data in a computer in the form of data files. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS for Windows. Cronbach's α and Kuder-Richardson reliability were used to test all sub-scales and their reliability, which ranged between 0.6579 and 0.8689, thus indicating good internal consistency among all the scales and sub-scales in this questionnaire. The study methods were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board II of the Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center. U.S. regulations identify several research categories that are considered exempt from IRB oversight. The study matched the guide of research in conventional educational settings, such as those involving the study of instructional strategies or effectiveness of various techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods. In the case of studies involving the use of educational tests, there are specific provisions in the exemption to ensure that subjects cannot be identified or exposed to risks or liabilities. The protocol was approved by the Hospital Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was deemed unnecessary (TSGHIRB No: 2-105-05-113).
