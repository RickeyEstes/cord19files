We will conduct a single-centre, double-blinded, two-group, parallel, superiority, randomised controlled trial of 100 adults undergoing general anaesthesia for elective CABG, with or without valve replacement (CABG±valve) surgery. Block randomisation with a 1:1 allocation has been planned. Family members and patients will be followed up to the third day and to 1 month after patient's surgery, respectively (figure 1). The study has been designed with reference to the CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement, 28 and reported according to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) statement. 29 Setting and population The study will be conducted at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, a 1400-bed university teaching hospital. Currently, there are 12-15 adults who undergo elective CABG±valve surgery per month. All elective CABG±valve surgery patients are routinely admitted to our 22-bed ICU for early postoperative care and monitoring with 1:1 nursing at all times, and are expected to be discharged from ICU to a high dependency cardiac ward within 24 hours after surgery. Only adult patients undergoing primary elective CABG±valve surgery whose primary language is Cantonese will be recruited from the operating theatre list published on the day before cardiac surgery. A face-to-face meeting will be scheduled with potential participants to confirm their study eligibility. Before obtaining written informed consent, the purpose of the study, procedures, risks and benefits of participation, and the time commitment involved will be explained to them. Patients and family members may withdraw from the study without prejudice at any time during the study. The patient education intervention includes a video in Cantonese, the predominant language used in Hong Kong. Patients will be excluded if they have a history of dementia, psychosis or neurological disease that would prevent them from completing the outcome questionnaires and are unable to provide written informed consent. We will also exclude patients undergoing emergency cardiac surgery (no opportunity to apply the intervention), patients who have had a previous cardiac surgery ( prior exposure) and those who have received previous care in an ICU ( prior exposure). Family members of the patient will be also invited to join the patient education intervention before the elective cardiac surgery. 'Family' will be defined as persons with close family, social or emotional relationship to the patient; 1 thus, next of kin and adult children of the patient will be included in the study. One family member per patient will be recruited. Family members will be excluded if they are unable to understand Cantonese, have previous experience with ICU care, previously underwent any cardiac surgery or did not visit the patient in ICU. The reasons for exclusion and number of patients or families lost to follow-up will be documented.
