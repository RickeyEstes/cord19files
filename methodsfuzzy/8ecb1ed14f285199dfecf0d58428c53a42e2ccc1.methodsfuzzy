Cell culture. Baby hamster kidney fibroblast BHK, human hepatoma derived cell line Huh7, human cervix epithelioid carcinoma derived cell line HeLa, and human embryonic kidney HEK293 were cultured and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS; Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Gibco-BRL) at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . The cell lines were routinely split two to three times a week after treatment with 0.1% trypsin (Biowhittaker Acambrex, Walkersville, MD, USA). Transfection and luciferase assay. Twenty-four hours before transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded in 6-well culture plates at 1 · 10 5 cells per well. The cells were transiently either cotransfected with 0.5 lg of the targeting reporter plasmid or gene expression vector of interest and 1.5 lg of the corresponding siRNA or shRNA expression plasmids, or transfected with 2 lg of the triggering siRNA or shRNA expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The EGFP-expressed cells were examined at 48 h later by inverted fluorescent microscopy or were quantified by flow cytometer or Western blot analyses. The luciferaseexpressed cells were harvested at 48 h posttransfection and aliquots of the cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were measured by Dualluciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as described by the manufacturer. The expression levels of endogenous target genes were determined at 48 h posttransfection by Western blot analysis. The total protein in the cell lysates was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Construction of targeting reporter expression vectors. Plasmid vectors were constructed by using standard molecular cloning techniques. The targeting reporter-EGFP plasmids, pEGFP-5UTR, and pEGFP-3UTR ( Fig. 2A) , containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes, were constructed by inserting the EGFP gene from pEGFP-N1 or pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and the GST gene from pET21a (Novagen, EMD Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany) into the pCMVg vector (BD Biosciences Clontech) to generate pCMV-EGFP-5UTR or pCMV-EGFP-3UTR and pCMV-GST, respectively, and then the GST gene expression cassette from pCMV-GST was cloned into the pCMV-EGFP-5UTR or pCMV-EGFP-3UTR vector. The targeting reporter-firefly luciferase plasmids, pLuc+-5UTR and pLuc+-3UTR ( Fig. 2A) , containing firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase (Fluc+) and Renilla (Renilla reiformis) luciferase (Rluc+) genes, were constructed by inserting the Fluc+ gene from pGL3-Basic (Promega) and the Rluc+ gene from pRL-TK (Promega) into the pCMV-EGFP-5UTR or pCMV-EGFP-3UTR and pCMVb (BD Biosciences Clontech) to generate pCMV-Fluc+-5UTR or pCMV-Fluc+-3UTR and pCMV-Rluc+, respectively, and then the Rluc+ gene expression cassette from pCMV-Rluc+ was cloned into the pCMV-Fluc+-5UTR or pCMV-Fluc+-3UTR vector. The targeting reporter-EGFP and firefly luciferase fusion plasmids, pPre-1, 2, and 3 ( Fig. 2A) , containing EGFP-Fluc+ chimeric and Rluc+ genes, were constructed by inserting the Fluc+ gene from pGL3-Basic into the pEGFP-C1 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech) to generate pEGFP-Fluc+, and then the EGFP-Fluc+ expression cassette from pEGFP-Fluc+ was cloned into the pCMVb vector to produce pCMV-EGFP-Fluc+. To generate the pPre-1, 2, and 3 plasmids, the Rluc+ gene expression cassette from pCMV-Rluc+ was further cloned into the pCMV-EGFP-Fluc+ vector. The pPre-1, 2, and 3 vectors contained three different reading frame sequences between EGFP and Fluc+ fused sites, pPre1: 5 0 -tacaagTCCGGACTCAGATCCGAAGCTTGG AGATCTGAATTCatggaa-3 0 , pPre2: 5 0 -tacaagTCCGGACTCAGATC CAAGCTTGGAGATCTGGAATTCatggaa-3 0 , and pPre3: 5 0 -tacaag TCCGGACTCAGATCCCGAAGCTTGGGCGAATTCatggaa-3 0 . Construction of triggering siRNA expression vector pDual. Oligonucleotides were purchased from commercial suppliers. The RNA polymerase III (Pol III) promoters, human H1 and mouse U6, were PCRamplified using synthetic oligonucleotides and cloned into the pBluescript II KS (+/À) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) to generate pHsH1 (Fig. 2B ) and pMmU6. Oligonucleotides used for the amplification of H1 and U6 promoters from human and mouse were: HsH1-S (T7): 5 0 -TAATAC GACTCACTATAGGG-3 0 and HsH1-AS: 5 0 -GAAGATCTGTCTCAT ACAGAATTATAAAG-3 0 ; MmU6-S: 5 0 -CCGCTCGAGATCCGAC GCCGCCATCTCTAGG-3 0 and MmU6-AS: 5 0 -CCCAAGCTTTT CTCCAAGGGATATTTATAG-3 0 . To construct the pDual vector ( Fig. 2B ), the mouse U6 (MmU6) expression cassette from pMmU6 was cloned into the pHsH1 vector. Construction of targeting reporter and triggering siRNA expression vectors containing a short synthetic DNA fragment of interest. A general strategy for constructing targeting reporter and triggering siRNA (or shRNA) expression vectors involved ligating an annealed oligonucleotide duplex into HindIII/BglII restriction site of both expression vectors, simultaneously. Oligonucleotides formed a short synthetic DNA fragment targeting the EGFP, firefly luciferase, HBsAg, p53, mouse MMP-7, EBV-LMP1, and AKT1 genes were purchased from commercial suppliers. The sequences of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides used in this study for constructing siRNA validation system are outlined in Table S1 . Construction of HBV-HBsAg, p53, MMP-7, and EBV-LMP1 expression vectors The p(3A)SAg vector containing HBV-HBsAg gene was kindly provided by Dr. C.-C. Lu (Department of Pathology, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan). The reconstructed HBsAg expression vectors, p(3A)SAg-luc+ and p(3A)SAg-EGFP, contained the firefly luciferase gene from pGL3-Promoter (Promega) and the EGFP gene from pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences Clontech) inserted into the p(3A)SAg vector [37] . Construction of the pCMV-p53/EGFP has been described previously [38] . The cDNA encoding mouse MMP-7 or EBV-LMP1 protein was amplified using total RNAs isolated from mouse liver tissue or B95-8 cells with the primers of MMP-7F: 5 0 -CGGGATCCACCA TGCAGCTCACCCTGTTCTG-3 0 and MMP-7R 5 0 -CCGCTCGAGCGTCACAGCGTGTTCCTCTTTCCATA TAAC-3 0 or EBV-LMP1F: 5 0 -CGGAATTCATGGAACACGACCTTG AGAGGG-3 0 and EBV-LMP1R: 5 0 -GGGGTACCAGTCATAGTAGCT TAGCTGAAC-3 0 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The amplified PCR fragments were cloned into pcDNA3.1/myc-His vector (Invitrogen) and then confirmed by sequencing. The pCMV-Mat/ EGFP and pCMV-LMP1/EGFP vectors contained the EGFP gene from pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences Clontech) inserted into the pcDNA3.1-Mat and pcDNA3.1-LMP1 vectors. Western blot analysis of EGFP, GST, HBsAg, p53, MMP-7, EBV-LMP1, and AKT1. At 48 h after transfection, cells were directly lysed on 6well culture plates in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, and 1% NP-40) containing protease inhibitors (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Total protein extracts were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and incubated with anti-GFP (B-2), anti-GST (B-14), anti-c-Myc (9E10) or anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), sheep polyclonal anti-HBsAg antibodies (Serotec, Oxford, UK), anti-EBV-LMP1 CS 1-4 monoclonal antibody (DakoCytomation, Inc., Carpinteria, CA, USA) or rabbit polyclonal anti-AKT1 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA), anti-sheep IgG secondary antibody (abcam, Cambridgeshire, UK) or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The bands were detected by using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK).
