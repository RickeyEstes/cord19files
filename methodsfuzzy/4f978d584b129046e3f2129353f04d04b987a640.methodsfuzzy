In this study, a semi-quantitative screening method was developed. A framework of the approach is given in Fig. 2 . Five different timetemperature conditions such as M-AD 37°C (4 days), T-AD 55°C (4 days), Irish pasteurisation 60°C (4 days), EU pasteurisation 70°C (60 min), and higher pasteurisation 90°C (60 min) were monitored (Table 1 ) for the baseline model (BM) to assess the likely fate of the pathogens after the AD process. As recommended by Nag et al. (2019) a semi-quantitative model was used in this study to rank the most hazardous pathogens depending on their ability to survive the AD process, the possible routes (aerosol, ingestion and direct contact) of transmission and the potential severity of illness. Indicator organisms are often used as surrogates for pathogens . Table 2 shows the widely accepted indicator organisms for such studies. Assessing the ability of the process to inactivate indicator organisms should provide a high degree of confidence regarding inactivation of comparable pathogens.
