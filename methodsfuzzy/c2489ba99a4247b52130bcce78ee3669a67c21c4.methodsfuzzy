The procedures of the proposed method are as follows (see Fig. 2 ): 1) Location and velocity initialization. The initial location and velocity of each robot are randomly assigned according to real conditions and features of each robot. 2) Plume finding. The robots update their locations and velocities to find a plume via the random search strategy until the concentration detected by a robot is greater than c min ( 3) Plume tracking. The robots use the improved PSO algorithm (Eq. (3)) to track the plume. 4) Plume retrieval. Once the plume is lost during plume traversal, the robots move randomly to find the plume again. 5) Algorithm locating termination. When * P t ( ) g has not changed for ΔT or when the localization time reaches T max , the locating algorithm is terminated. In this study, the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) approach with the Renormalization Group (RNG) k-ε model was employed to simulate airflow and particle distributions of the rooms. For indoor environment simulations, the RNG k-ε model has been widely used with considerable success [43] [44] [45] . The governing equations can be generally written as: where ϕ denotes flow variables such as velocity, enthalpy and turbulence parameters; where S ϕ is the source term and where Γ ϕ eff , is the effective diffusion coefficient. Further information on coefficients for the different variables can be found in Zhang et al. [46] . The Eulerian drift flux model was used to predict indoor particle distributions. This model integrates particle gravity settling effects into the concentration equation and can be expressed as: and where C is the concentration of particles; where σ C is the turbulent Schmidt number, which is equal to 1.0 [47] ; where S C is the generation rate of the particle source; where μ eff is the sum of laminar and turbulent dynamic viscosity; where ∇⋅ → ρ u C ( ) is the drift flux term representing the difference in velocity observed between particles and air resulting from the particle drag force and gravity; and where → V S is the settling velocity of particles [48] , which is expressed as: where C D is the drag coefficient; where d p is the diameter of the particle; and where ρ p is the density of the particle. In addition, the drift flux model assumes that particle movements cannot affect turbulence. To make these assumptions, the computational element should contain enough particles for reasonable statistical calculations, particles should fall significantly below the Kolmogorov micro scale of the airflow field, and particle phase volumes should be lower. These assumptions were found to be applicable to indoor particle simulations by Holmberg and Li [47] . For discretization schemes, PRESTO! and second-order upwind discretization were applied to discretize pressure levels and all other variables, and the SIMPLE scheme was used for pressure and velocity coupling. Residual values of energy and other variables were set to less than 10 −6 and 10 −4 , respectively. A Boussinesq approximation was used to calculate buoyancy effects of the manikins. In our previous study [38] , grids of 247,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 were used to conduct a grid-independence test of the RANS model, and 500,000 grids proved sufficient for this simulation based on grid convergence index calculations [49] . The time step size was set at 0.05 s, and the data sampling period was set to 300 s, covering the experimental sampling period. The inner surface temperature of the chamber was also controlled to mimic thermal boundaries such as walls and windows. The boundary conditions of walls and manikins were set as heat fluxes, and further information on the boundary settings used can be found in Liu and Novoselac [38] . Fig. 5 shows a schematic of the experimental chamber [38] , which was identical to the mixing ventilation model used in our case study ( Fig. 3 (a) ). Mono-dispersed 2.5 μm particles generated by latex with a density of 1050 kg/m 3 were released from a transient source in the ventilation duct. The injection period was set to 100 s. The injection period was set to 100 s. Optical particle counters were used to measure particle concentrations, and omni-directional low-velocity anemometers were used to measure air velocities. Table 2 presents the specifications of the instruments. Particle transmission experiments were repeated three times to calculate the standard deviation. Further information can be found in a previous publication [38] . Fig. 6 quantitatively compares velocities measured with height between the CFD simulations and measurements, and the positions of L1-L6 are shown in Fig. 5 . Differences in the air movement observed were not significant due to mixing effects. A meaningful discrepancy was found between simulation and measurement results at L5-L6 at lower levels (below 0.6 m). Fig. 7 presents the predicted dimensionless particle concentration profiles of P1-P3 shown in Fig. 5 . For P2 and P3, the simulation results agree well with the experimental data, and concentration values decreased after the first 100 s of release. However, for P1, a significant discrepancy was found because P1 was positioned in the recirculation region, and concentration fluctuations were significant. The above validation shows that the URANS model can generate reasonable flow distributions and that the Eulerian drift flux model can predict particle dispersion with acceptable accuracy. Therefore, these models can be used to test and evaluate the presented source localization method. For mixing ventilation ( Fig. 8 (a) ), air was supplied from the inlet and was sent through the room along the ceiling. Swirling airflow was generated between the wall and the cylindrical manikins, and a thermal plume was found around the manikins. Velocity magnitudes almost fell below 0.3 m/s. For displacement ventilation ( Fig. 8 (b) ), velocity magnitudes were much lower than those of mixing ventilation because an in-plane diffuser was not used. In Fig. 8 (b) a thermal plume is also observable around the manikins. Fig. 9 shows particle distributions of the four release scenarios (MP, MD, DP, and DP (Table 1) ) measured 50 s after the particles were released. For scenario MP, an isolated local extremum area of particles appeared far from the particle source and a small local extremum area appeared around the source. For scenarios MD and DP, only a large local extremum area of particles appeared around the particle source. For scenario DD, the local extremum area of particles around the source decreased in size compared to those observed for scenarios MD and DP. In addition, no isolated local extremum area formed, which may have facilitated mobile robot source locating. To test the improved PSO-based method under different indoor airflow environments, we simulated four release scenarios: MP, MD, DP, and DD (Table 1) . For each release scenario, the maximum speed of each robot and the concentration threshold c min for plume identification were set as 0.3 m/s and 50 μg/m 3 according to the model geometry and the release rate of the potential particle source, respectively. Note that the maximum speed and concentration threshold can be set depending on the specific robot, sensor and environment used. Additionally, we assumed that source localization efforts were successful when the distance between the source location determined by the robots and the actual location differed by within 0.5 m. As a particle source itself is of a certain size, it is unrealistic to determine the central position of such a source without error. This localization error is acceptable from an engineering perspective [50] . During plume finding, a simple random search strategy was used whereby each coordinate value of the robot's velocity used in the rectangular coordinate was set as a random number uniformly distributed within the range of [-0.3, 0.3]. Under all four scenarios, the robots could successfully locate the particle source. Fig. 10 shows the source locating process of the improved PSO-based method for scenario MP. Note that the location of each robot represents the positioning of the equipped sensor. Six robots (R1-R6) were randomly initialized in the room after particles were released for 20 s (Fig. 10 (a) and (f)). After 3 s of movement according to the random search strategy, robot R6 found the plume first ( Fig. 10 (b) and (g)). Then, the robots used the improved PSO algorithm to track the plume and moved toward the local extremum area with higher particle concentrations (Fig. 10 (c) and (h)), and the robots then left this area and approached the source (Fig. 10 (d) and (i) ). Finally, the robots successfully found the source 67 s after the particles were released (Fig. 10 (e) and (j) ). The source locating process shown in Fig. 10 is drawn from an animation provided in the supplementary files. Fig. 11 illustrates the movement of robots R1-R6 under scenario MP. First, all of the robots moved randomly according to the random search strategy until the plume was found by R6 ( Fig. 11 (b) ). The robots then adjusted their velocities by using the improved PSO algorithm to track the plume and approached the area of higher particle concentrations and the source (Fig. 11 (a) ). Finally, the robots stopped near the periodic source after leaving the local extremum area. Live trajectories of robots R1-R6 shown in Fig. 11 are presented as animations in the supplementary files. To analyze the performance of the improved PSO-based method under different indoor environments, we conducted 25 independent experiments under each release scenario and used two indices to evaluate its performance: (1) the success rate (SR) and (2) the localization time (LT). The SR is the ratio of the number of runs through which the method successfully found the source to the total number of runs, reflecting the capacities or robustness of the method in successfully locating the source. The LT is the amount of time required to find the source using the proposed method, reflecting the method's efficiency. Statistical results of the independent experiments are presented in Fig. 12 . As is shown in Fig. 12 (a) , the SRs of each release scenario are very high and only differ marginally. The SR of scenarios DP and DD for the displacement ventilation room reached 100% and is slightly higher than that found for scenarios MP and MD (96%) for the mixing ventilation room. The higher SR found for displacement ventilation may be attributed to the fact that airflows of displacement ventilation are more uniform than those of mixing ventilation (Fig. 8) . As is shown in Fig. 12 (b), the localization time of each scenario (approximately 55 s) shows no obvious differences. The maximum average localization period of scenario MD is the longest (56.8 s) and only 14% longer than that of scenario DD with the shortest average localization period (49.7 s). In addition, the average localization period and standard deviation of scenario DP are slightly greater than those of scenario MP. These results may be attributed to the fact that the local extremum area around the source used for scenario DP was larger than that used for scenario MP (Fig. 9) . In summary, the results presented in Fig. 12 show that the improved method is robust and efficient at locating time-varying sources under different indoor environments and that the method's robustness and efficiency are slightly affected by source types, source locations and airflow fields involved. The performance of the improved PSO-based source localization method (IPSO) was further compared to the performance of two other PSO-based active olfaction methods: the standard PSO-based (SPSO) method and the WUII method [28] . To employ the same benchmarks of comparison, the same plume finding strategies, obstacle avoidance algorithms and other settings (e.g., the number and maximum speed of robots used) were applied across the three methods. Fig. 13 shows statistical results for the three methods. The SR generated from the IPSO method is significantly greater than values generated from the SPSO and WUII methods for each release scenario ( Fig. 13 (a) ). The maximum SR generated from both the SPSO and WUII methods for scenario DD was measured as 44% while the minimum SR values generated from these methods for scenario MP are 24% and 20%, respectively. These results indicate that the SPSO and WUII methods are not suited to practical conditions under which the release rate of a particle source changes with time. For these cases, the SPSO and WUII methods entrapped the robots within the local extremum area so that they could not successfully locate the source. In contrast, the minimum SR of the proposed IPSO method was measured as greater than 96%. Therefore, the IPSO method is more promising than the other two tested methods for applying to practical situations because the IPSO method can enhance robot search capacities by using the upwind term and guiding robots to leave the local extremum area until they find the source (Fig. 10) . As shown in Fig. 13 (b) , the localization periods of the IPSO method is slightly longer than that of the SPSO and WUII methods for each scenario. This can mainly be attributed to the fact that the IPSO method requires more time to search through a larger area to avoid becoming entrapped in local extremum areas and to find the source successfully. When a method cannot successfully locate a source, the localization period is meaningless. From this perspective, the proposed IPSO method still presents obvious advantages over the SPSO and WUII methods due to its much higher SR (Fig. 13 (b) ). Particle sources are widely found in indoor environments with timevarying release rates (e.g., pathogen droplets emitted by infected people or the leakage or malicious release of particles from a container). This work presents a novel multi-robot active olfactory method for rapidly locating time-varying particle sources and assesses the proposed method under a variety of indoor release scenarios. This study extends the application of the active olfactory method from gaseous to particle sources and improves source localization performance outcomes. The improved multi-robot active olfactory method was developed based on three major assumptions. First, only one particle source was considered under each release scenario. This assumption specifies the scope of this study. A future study may apply the proposed method to indoor conditions involving multiple particle sources (involving simultaneous or sequential release). We also assumed that the airflow field was steadily maintained, which applies to most indoor environments supplied with mechanical ventilation systems. In addition, effects of robot movements on the steady airflow field were neglected because robots and sensors can be separated by a scalable rod or string [51] and because the sizes of the sensors could be much smaller than that of the indoor environment. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude indoor environments with dynamic airflows such as those of natural ventilation, hybrid ventilation (a combination of mechanical and natural ventilation), and flow disturbance resulting from the movement of people, vehicles, and equipment. The source localization issues of dynamic airflow fields will be investigated in our future studies. This study focused on testing the source localization method from the perspective of environmental factors, such as the ventilation mode, source release rate profile, and source location. Therefore, we validated the source localization method by the combination of experiments and CFD simulations. Experiments were used to validate the accuracy of the CFD modeling of indoor airflows and particle dispersion, and the CFD model was used to simulate a variety of particle release scenarios owing to its advantages in terms of time and cost requirements compared to those of experiments. As the airflow field and particle concentration distribution were obtained through CFD simulations, sensor measurement errors were neglected; these errors are inevitable in practice. In the future we will test the source localization method by employing real robots and we will investigate effects of sensor thresholds, of measurement errors, and of the number and speed of robots used on the method's effectiveness. In practical settings, the proposed method can locate a particle source by directly using sensor measurements rather than CFD simulations. The applicability and reliability of the proposed method were verified and illustrated via CFD simulations because the CFD method has many advantages, such as higher repeatability, less time required and lower cost consumption, compared with the experimental method. Nevertheless, experimental studies using real robots and corresponding results will be reported in the future.
