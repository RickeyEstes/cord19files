COPD patients aged greater than 50 years old who visited the ED of the Linkou Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital due to COPD exacerbations between April 2009 and August 2010 were prospectively enrolled for this study. COPD was diagnosed based on the Global Initiatives for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines, and an exacerbation was defined as "a worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variation". 15 All the patients were current smokers or ex-smokers with a smoking history of greater than 20 pack-years. Postbronchodilator spirometry prior to the ED visit that demonstrated a ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1 ) to forced vital capacity (FVC) of ,70% was documented. Patients with a history of bronchial asthma or with abnormal chest radiographs indicating other respiratory diseases were excluded. Patients who were hospitalized for cardiovascular disease, acute pulmonary edema, acute pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or active pneumonia were also excluded. Active pneumonia was diagnosed by chest radiograph obtained in ED.
