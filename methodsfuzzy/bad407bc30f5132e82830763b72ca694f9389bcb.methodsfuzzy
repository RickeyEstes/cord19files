Headache is common, and there are internationally accepted criteria to measure the quality and the intensity of headache. However, the time of onset and duration of headaches are difficult to predict. It is possible to recruit people with headaches, as well as identify those at risk of frequent headache. An alternative, but rarely used, method is to recruit people who seek out over-the-counter analgesics for headaches. Although those who purchase may not necessarily be those who require treatment and may not be in pain at the time, this may be worth further investigation, especially in light of recent technological developments that allow for remote measurement. In terms of developing experimental analogues of headache, techniques of pain induction have been developed, but with variable success. Therefore, for headache, optimal methods for most studies are likely to be a mixed strategy of recruiting people either when they are in pain, by site, or by EMA, or focussing on those who frequently report pain. Despite the high incidence of acute muscle pain, this is not an area that seems to have been well used. Although muscle pains are common, there is a large variety of presentation. It may be possible to recruit from populations that are at risk of muscle pain and/or injury, for example, endurance sport competitors. New assessment and measurement technologies may open avenues for investigating muscle pain in more detail. Despite the difficulties associated with recruiting into muscle pain studies, there are many experimental analogue techniques that have been used. Numerous techniques are in common use, which include a range of highly controllable and reliable approaches. For some visceral pains there are relatively good standard descriptions and typologies that allow for control over heterogeneity of samples via selection. It seems that there are good experimental methods for inducing pain sensations similar to those experienced by people with naturally occurring painful abdominal conditions. Although stimulation of the GI tract may be common, this technique is highly invasive and does not allow participants to perform many additional tasks during induction. Water-loading tasks are emerging as potentially useful methods. The methods used to investigate menstrual-related pain are variable. Greater standardization is required, with a particular focus on the selection of samples homogenous in terms of health status and phase of cycle [17, 24] . However, where menstrual pain is the main focus of investigation, its prevalence, regularity, and the ability to measure associated hormonal features make self-selection or recruitment of those at risk of pain a good solution. Dental pain is a frequently used human pain model, with third molar extraction procedural pain the most common method. In addition to third molar extraction, we also found a number of other procedural techniques for recruiting dental pain patients. Although these were successful in resulting in a reliable pain sensation, they required either a large cost or amount of time to recruit participants using these techniques. We could find no examples of population or at-risk studies. Techniques for pain induction have been developed, in particular as they relate to motor function of the jaw. These, however, are difficult to achieve and not very effective. Colds and associated symptoms of sore throat are common, although seasonal. Population-based approaches have been used to good effect, although we found no studies of ''at-risk'' samples. Recruiting from those seeking treatment has also been used, although in this case, these are largely self-management products at point of sale rather than physician office recruitment. For greater control, protocols do exist for inducing cold, but these methods require greater laboratory infrastructure and participant commitment over a longer period of time and are therefore likely to be unappealing for general use in pain studies.
