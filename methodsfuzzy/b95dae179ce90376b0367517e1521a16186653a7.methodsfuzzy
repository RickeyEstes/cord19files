Melting points were obtained on an MFB-595010M Gallenkamp apparatus in open capillary tubes and are uncorrected. IR spectra were obtained using an FTIR PerkineElmer 1600 Infrared Spectrophotometer. Only noteworthy IR absorptions are listed (cm À1 ). 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Gemini-200 (200 and 50.3 MHz respectively) or Varian Gemini-300 (300 and 75.5 MHz) Instrument using CDCl 3 as solvent and tetramethylsilane as internal standard or (CD 3 ) 2 CO. Other 1 H NMR spectra and heterocorrelation 1 He 13 C (HMQC and HMBC) experiments were recorded on a Varian VXR-500 (500 MHz). Assignments were established by DEPT, HMBC and HMQC. Mass spectra were recorded on a ThermoFinnigan Trace DSQ equipped with an APCI or ESI source. High-resolution ESI-MS were measured on an LC/MSD-TOF mass spectrometer. Internal reference masses m/z ¼ 121.050873 (purine), 922.009798 (HP-0921), data acquisition and processing were performed with Xcalibur 1.3 software. Column chromatography was performed with silica gel (E. Merck, 70e230 mesh). Reactions were monitored by TLC using 0.25 mm silica gel 60 F 254 plates (E. Merck), detection was achieved by the absorbance of UV light (254 nm and 366 nm) or spraying with different reagents (sulfuric acid-10% w/w ceric sulfate followed by heating 5 min at 80e110 C depending of the used reagent) and the R f values was obtained from the analytical TLC. Microanalysis was determined on a Carlo Erbae1106 analyser. All reagents were of commercially quality or were purified before use. Organic solvents were of analytical grade or were purified by standard procedures. Commercial solvents were purchased from SigmaeAldrich.
