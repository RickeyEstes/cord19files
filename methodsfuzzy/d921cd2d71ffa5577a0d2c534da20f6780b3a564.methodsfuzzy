In silico analyses of Rv0297. The GlobPlot 2.3 (http://globplot.embl.de/cgiDict.py) tool was used to predict disordered regions and globularity in the PE_PGRS proteins used in this study. The presence of putative ER localization signals in Rv0297 protein was searched from LocSigDB (64) using the FIMO tool (65) from MEME Suite version 4.11.2 (http://meme-suite.org/tools/fimo) with a P value of Ͻ0.001. The sequence file of the amino acid sequence of Rv0297 was uploaded under "Input the sequences," and ER signal sequences were typed under "Input the motifs" in the data submission form. Protein structure modeling, validation, and protein-protein docking. The Rv0297 protein sequence was obtained from the UniProtKB database (identifier [ID] Q6MX50) (66) , and the 3D structure was modeled using I-TASSER (67) . The human TLR4 protein structure (27 to 627 amino acids [aa]) was obtained from the RCSB protein data bank (PDB ID 3FXI). Rv0297 interactions with TLR4 and TLR2 were compared through the HADDOCK 2.2 web server (68) . Structure validation was done through PSVS (69) , and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed with GROMACS v5.0.7 (70) (71) (72) (73) (74) . Generation of constructs. Genomic DNA of H 37 Ra was provided by Astrid Lewin, RKI, Berlin, Germany. The PE18 gene (Rv1788), Rv0297, Rv1818c full-length gene, and their PE and PGRS domains were cloned as C-terminal fusions into pDsRed1C1 vector. The primer sequences and PCR conditions are listed in Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material, respectively. A complete list and description of the constructs prepared are shown in Fig. S1 . For generating rRv0297PGRS protein, the Rv0297PGRS gene was cloned in the pET28a expression vector and expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. Recombinant protein was purified from inclusion bodies by solubilization in 8 M urea in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.5) and on-column renaturation using a urea gradient followed by Ni 2ϩ -nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) chromatography. The protein was treated with polymyxin B at 4°C for 2 h. Immunization and antibody generation. A rabbit was immunized with 500 g/ml of rRv0297PGRS, 3 booster doses of immunization were given at an interval of 15 days, and sera were collected 15 days after the last immunization. Cell culture and transfection. The murine macrophage cell lines RAW 264.7 and RAW-ΔTLR4 and HEK293T (human embryonic kidney cells) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) and penicillin-streptomycin (Pen-Strep) (100 g/ml). Cells (5,000/well) were seeded in a 96-well plate. The constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells for localization studies and in the RAW 264.7 cell line for ER stress-related experiments using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) for 30 h and 48 h. Immunofluorescence staining. HEK293T, RAW 264.7, and RAW-ΔTLR4 cells were seeded on coverslips to adhere for 16 to 18 h and transfected with constructs shown in Fig. S1 or stimulated with different concentrations of rRv0297PGRS. After the required period of incubation, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized, and blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 -1% BSA-PBS for 10 min. The cells were incubated with the respective primary and Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (75) . Images were visualized using an Olympus FluoView FV1200 laser scanning confocal microscope. In Cell death assay. RAW 264.7 and RAW-ΔTLR4 cells were treated with rRv0297PGRS (2.5 to 40 g/ml) for 48 h. Ten percent resazurin sodium salt (100 mg/ml) was added. Absorbance was monitored at 570 nm with reference at 600 nm after 24 h of reaction. For annexin V/PI staining, treated cells (24 h) were stained with the Alexa Fluor 488 annexin V and PI flow cytometry kit (Invitrogen). Analysis of 10,000 stained cells was performed with a FACSAria 3 cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA). Calcium influx assay. Transfected cells were stained with Fluo-4 NW dye solution (Molecular Probes) at 37°C for 30 min and further incubated at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. Calcium release was detected by measuring the fluorescence intensity using a 494-nm excitation and a 516-nm emission wavelength. Detection of ROS. Transfected or treated cells were stained with 5 mM CellROX green reagent for 30 min at 37°C. Plates were read using a 485-nm excitation and a 520-nm emission wavelength. Results were represented as the mean fluorescent intensity of cells after subtraction of the blank (CellROX green reagent-unstained cells). NO quantitation in macrophages. Cells were either transfected with various combination of PE and PGRS gene constructs or treated with 20 to 80 g/ml of rRv0297PGRS protein for 30 h. Cell-free supernatant (150 l) was mixed with 50 l of Griess reagent for 30 min. The nitrite concentration was measured using sodium nitrite as a standard. Plates were read at 540 nm. Western blot analysis. Western blotting was performed with anti-CHOP, anti-ATF4, anti-GRP94, and anti-GRP78/BiP antibodies (Abcam, USA) and anti-␤-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA). Membranes were developed with a chemiluminescent reagent (Millipore). Caspase assay. The activity level of initiator caspase-8 was determined using the Caspase-Glo assay (Promega). Statistical analysis. All data were expressed in the form of means Ϯ standard deviations (SDs) derived from 3 different groups of independent experiments using GraphPad Prism5 software. A one-way analysis of variation (ANOVA) was performed followed by Dunnett's post hoc test in order to calculate the statistical significance at a P value of Ͻ0.05.
