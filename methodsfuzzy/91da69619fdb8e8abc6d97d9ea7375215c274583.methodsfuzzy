Two typical cases of enclosed space environment were selected for Sc t modification. As show in Fig. 1 (a) , the first case is in the seven-row aircraft cabin mockup [21] . The cabin had 42 heated manikins with sensible heat production of 75 W for each. Air was supplied through two rows of diffusers on cabin shoulders and was exhausted at outlets located on side wall near the cabin floor, and the air change rate was 48 ACH. The second case is in the office with an under floor air distribution (UFAD) system [22] as shown in Fig. 1 (b) . The room had four heated human simulators. Air was supplied from two floor inlets and exhausted from a ceiling outlet, and the air change rate was 5.5 ACH (air change per hour). Since modification of Sc t is associated with vortex structure, a numerical model was used to identify vortex structure firstly. . For the study on contaminant transport, airflow fields should be predicted correctly. Experimental data from literature was used to validate the numerical model. Fig. 2 shows comparison of experimental data from particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurement [29] with simulated airflow patterns in CS4 of the aircraft cabin ( Fig. 1 (a) ) by three turbulence models. As shown in Fig. 2 , decay of the simulated velocity is slower than the experiment due to underestimated turbulence kinetic energy [30] . The predicted airflow fields from all turbulence models were similar and all captured the trend of PIV measured airflow. Jets from right and left diffusers merged in the middle, and the jet from the left side was a little stronger due to the asymmetry diffuser conditions in the cabin. In addition, velocity magnitudes were lower in top and side regions. However, remarkable differences exist if we look at the two sets of vectors at certain positions, especially in the middle where the jets from right and left merged. The inlet velocity direction was measured by UAs, whose probes could not be placed very close to the diffusers [31] . This maybe resulted in some errors of measured velocity direction. The experimental data may unavoidably have some instrumental errors and thereby lead to some deviations in the center of the cabin where the velocity was very small (< 0.1 m/s). Fig. 3 shows comparison of predicted airflow velocities with experimental data [22] at poles V1 to V3 for the office room ( Fig. 1 (b) ) by different turbulence models. Poles V1 to V3 were in the vicinity of the selected cross section. From Fig. 3 , the simulated data by RNG k-ε model agrees best with the measured data. While the RSM model performs worst, which may be caused by its convergence problem in threedimensional buoyant flow [23] . The simulation agreed better with measured data at lower and top part of pole V1 and V2, but worse in the middle part of pole V1 and V2. For pole V3, predicted and experimental velocities were all lower in the middle part, but discrepancies were significant at its top and lower parts. RRMSE (relative root mean square error) was used to conduct quantitative comparison between different turbulence models: where C and C exp i sim i , , are experimental and simulated concentration at sampling point i. C exp is average experimental concentration. Table 1 shows the RRMSE values for three turbulence models. For the aircraft cabin, the RNG k-ε model performs slightly better. Considering overall low velocities and complex turbulent flow in the cabin, the difference between these turbulence models is not observable. For the office room, performance of the RNG k-ε model is much better than other models. Overall, the RNG k-ε model performed the best in both spaces, and its predicted airflow fields were also acceptable. Taking the computing efforts into consideration, it was employed to modify the turbulent Schmidt number in this study.
