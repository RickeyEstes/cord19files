Blood specimens for detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), CMV, and AdV were extracted and analyzed by qPCR as described [16] . For the other qPCRs, total viral nucleic acids were extracted with QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (QIAGEN, US) according to the manufacturer's protocol with 200 mL of specimens eluted into 50 mL of extract. The analysis of BK virus (BKV) is described elsewhere [Multiplex real-time PCR assay for simultaneous detection of cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, adenovirus, and BK polyomavirus, Ã– hrmalm et al. In manuscript]. The qPCR for parvovirus B19 (B19) was performed on an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and carried out in a total 50-mL reaction mixture including 25 mL of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 5 mL of template (Table 1) . The NPAs were analyzed on the same ABI System described above. However, for RNA viruses, a MultiScribe and RNase Inhibitor Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used. Newly developed primers and probes are described in Table 1 , whereas for human rhinovirus (HRV) [17] , human enterovirus (HEV) [18] , influenza A virus (IFA) [19], influenza B virus (IFB) [20] , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [21] , and parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV1) [22] , the design is described elsewhere. Quantification of viruses in blood was achieved by comparing with plasmids of known concentrations. Virus detection in nasopharynx was however judged qualitatively as NPA was used as starting material. For CMV, EBV, and AdV the dynamic range was 500 to 2610 8 copies/mL. Values of detectable viral copies below this range were given as '',500''. For BKV and B19, the lower part of the dynamic range was 5 copies/reaction. Values of detectable viral copies below 250 copies/mL blood were considered as '',250.
