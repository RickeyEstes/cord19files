From June 1, 2003, to July 25, 2003 , 52 patients with SARS who met specified discharge criteria 12 were discharged from our hospital. The diagnosis leading to their original hospitalization was established based on the CDC definition of SARS. 7 From a review of medical records for discharged patients with SARS, we identified patients who exhibited dyspnea with strenuous activity. All patients who remained symptomatic to this extent underwent HRCT and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) as part of their clinical evaluation. Patients who were not symptomatic could not be scanned for clinical purposes because the National Insurance Policy would not pay for the scans. Along with HRCT scans, patients underwent PFTs during follow-up to evaluate various degrees of persistent respiratory symptoms and form the basis of this study, while the other 33 patients did not have subjective respiratory complaints.
