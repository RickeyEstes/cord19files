Experimental dipole moments and acidities of azoles, including 1,2,3-triazole, show linear correlations with their p-electron excess calculated by the semiempirical AM1 method <2003CHE71>. Experimental dipole moments of azoles agree well with those calculated by the DFT program ALLCHEM <2003PCA4172>. Calculated dipole moments m (in units of Debye,D) of a few selected azoles are listed below: Ab initio optimized geometries at B3LYP/6-311þG levels suggest that aromatic stabilization of 2H-1,2,3-triazole is the highest of all azoles <2003T1657>. Some values (in units of kcal mol À1 ) are given below for comparison: Bond dissociation energies for several heterocyclic systems calculated by two ab initio methods, CBS-Q, G3 and G3B3, show similar values <2003JPO883>. The G3B3 data for three selected azoles are as follows: Potassium cation affinities of several azoles and other compounds in the gas phase were calculated by hybrid density functional theory [B3-LYP with 6-311 þ G(3df , 2p) basis set] <2003CEJ3383>. There is a striking difference in binding energies of 1H-and 2H-1,2,3-triazoles. Some of the collected data are as follows: Monte Carlo calculations of interactions of 1H-benzotriazole with water reveal significant electronic polarization of the heterocycle. The dipole moment is increased by 2.89 D for the ground state and 2.75 D for the excited state to the total values of 6.89 and 6.40 D, respectively. Direct measurements of dipole moments in water are not possible, but these numerical results are supported by experimental solvatochromic blue shift of the p ! p * transition <2003IJQ572>. Theoretical calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G * and B3LYP/6-311þþG ** levels concluded that 2-(hydroxymethyl)benzotriazole 2 is slightly more stable than 1-(hydroxymethyl)benzotriazole 1. The energy difference of 0.22 kcal mol À1 suggests that both isomers should be almost equally abundant; however, in solid state and in solutions, only isomer 1 is observed. One of the possible explanations of this phenomenon is formation of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the OH group and N-3 in condensed phase of derivative 1. Less basic nitrogen atoms in derivative 2 do not provide such stabilization <2004JHC285>. Atomic charges of anions 3 and 4 have been evaluated at the HF/6-31G * level using several partitioning schemes. The data obtained from the natural population analysis (NPA) method are listed below. The electron-withdrawing power of the CN groups is clearly demonstrated by the total charge of the ring change from À1.34 to À0.84 <2003SSI129>.  The last two decades have witnessed rapid development of organic synthetic methods based on benzotriazole derivatives. Thus, introduction of benzotriazole moiety to organic molecules provides several practical advantages. Among other benefits, a benzotriazolyl substituent activates the reaction center, stabilizes intermediates, increases regio-and stereoselectivity, and simplifies separation and purification of the products. After the desired molecular assembly is constructed, the bond with benzotriazole is cleaved off to provide the final product. A vast variety of
