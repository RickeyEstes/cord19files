The idea was to select articles including the word "space" either in the title, or the abstract or the text. 359 articles fit that request in the period spreading from the time the journal was created by Boulos [4] to the present day (September 2015). Subsequently, the title and abstract were integrated into a utility software enabling one to carry out a lexical analysis of the corpus, essentially from the most frequent words (TagCrowd) [1] [2] [3] . We only integrated the articles' titles and abstracts into the utility, because we considered that they were good indicators of the main words used in the text, bearing in mind that they synthesize the article's object. Representation is by means of a tag cloud. Words with the same root as space-like PÃ©rez et al. Int J Health Geogr (2016) 15:3 spatial-are merged in our request. We requested that the hundred most used words appear, as well as their frequency. We broke up the analysis period (13 years) into three temporally homogeneous sub-periods (2002-2005, 2006-2010 and 2011-2015) .
