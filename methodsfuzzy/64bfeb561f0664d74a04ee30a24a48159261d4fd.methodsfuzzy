In this section, we identify some of the more popular methods (although by no means all) used to calculate R 0 . We also describe the limitations that each method presents and demonstrate one of the core problems with R 0 . Specifically, we address a key problem with R 0 : how do biologists make sense of it from mathematical models? (See, for example, the puzzled discussion in van den Bosch et al. [6] .) Although the "R" in R 0 is derived from "reproductive", based on the original formulation of the concept as the average number of secondary infections, many thresholds have been denoted by "R 0 ", even when they are not related to the average number of secondary infections. Thus, in keeping with the notation, we will use the notation R 0,X to denote an R 0 -like surrogate associated with a particular method, symbolised by X. The survival function has the advantage that it always produces the average number of secondary individuals infected by a single infected individual, in the same class. Thus, in Figure 1 , where one human infects two mosquitoes, who each infect three humans, the survival function produces R 0 = 6. This is the number of humans infected by a single infected human via mosquitoes; or, equivalently, the number of mosquitoes infected by a single mosquito via humans. The survival function is a generalised method of calculating the basic reproductive ratio that is not restricted to ODEs. However, determining the individual probabilities can be cumbersome, especially if multiple states are involved. For a vector-borne infection such as malaria, with two infection states (human and mosquito), calculating the first probability involves determining the probability that a human infected at time 0 exists at time t, the probability that a human infected for total time t infects a mosquito and the probability that an infected mosquito lives to be age a − t, where 0 ≤ t ≤ a [2] . For diseases with more states, such as Guinea Worm disease, where there is a waterborne parasite, which can attach itself to copepods, which in turn are ingested by humans and which subsequently grow into an internal nematode, the calculations of the survival probabilities become unwieldy. Thus, although this method always produces the correct R 0 , in practice, it is difficult to use. This is especially true for models with sufficient complexity, which are often those encountered most frequently. In de Camino-Beck et al. [14] , a graph-theoretic method for calculating R 0 is given. Starting from the definition of R 0 = ρ(FV −1 ), they derived a series of rules for reducing the digraph associated with Fλ −1 − V to a digraph with zero weight, from which λ = R 0 . The rules are as follows. Several mechanisms have been shown to lead to backward bifurcation in epidemic models, but backward bifurcations in compartmental models have only recently attracted serious research attention. Gómez-Acevedo and Li [16] investigated a mathematical model for human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) infection of CD4 + T cells that incorporates both horizontal transmission through cell-to-cell contact and vertical transmission through mitotic division of infected T cells. They assumed that a fraction σ of the infected cells survive the immune system attack after the error-prone viral replication. Under the biologically sound assumptions that the fraction σ should be very low and the rate of the mitotic division should be high, their model has a bifurcation that predicts persistent infection for an extended range of the basic reproduction R 0 > R 0 (σ 0 ), where R 0 (σ 0 ) < 1. This model undergoes a backward bifurcation as σ increases: multiple stable equilibria exist for an open set of parameter values, when the basic reproduction number is below one. Safan et al. [17] studied an epidemiological model under the assumption that the susceptibility after a primary infection is r times the susceptibility before a primary infection. They present a method for determining the control effort required to eliminate an infection from a host population when subcritical persistence may occur. This effort can be interpreted as a reproduction number but is not necessarily the basic reproduction number. For r > 1 + μ/α, this model exhibits backward bifurcations, where μ is the death rate and α is the recovery rate. For such models, the authors presented a method for determining the minimum effort required to eradicate the infection from the endemic steady state if one concentrates on control measures affecting the transmission rate constant. Garba et al. [18] presented a deterministic model for the transmission dynamics of a single strain of dengue by realistically adopting a standard incidence formulation and allowing dengue transmission by exposed humans and vectors. The model was extended to include an imperfect vaccine for dengue. A backward bifurcation was observed in both models. This makes R 0 < 1 no longer sufficient for effectively controlling dengue in a community. However, this phenomenon can be removed by replacing the standard incidence function in the model with a mass-action formulation. Reluga et al. [19] proposed a series of epidemic models for waning immunity that can be applied in many different settings. With biologically realistic hypotheses, they found that immunity alone never creates a backward bifurcation. However, this does not rule out the possibility of multiple stable equilibria, which can be shown by a counterexample of the forward bifurcation at R 0 = 1. See Figure 5 (b). where C IS (t) denotes the contact per susceptible neighbour and ψ(t) denotes the infectiousness at time t after infection. Kao [21] showed that novel pathogens may evolve towards a lower R 0 , even if this results in pathogen extinction. This is because the presence of exploitable heterogeneities, such as high variance in the number of potentially infectious contacts, increases R 0 ; thus, pathogens that can exploit heterogeneities in the contact structure have an advantage over those that do not. The exploitation of heterogeneities results in a more rapid depletion of the potentially susceptible neighbourhood for an infected host. While the low R 0 strategy is never evolutionarily stable, invading strains with higher R 0 will also converge to the low R 0 strategy if not sufficiently different from the resident strain. This is in contrast to the conventional belief that the emergence of novel pathogens is driven by maximisation of R 0 . In a randomly mixed epidemiological network, R 0 can be approximated by where l in and l out are, respectively, the number of inward and outward "truly infectious" links per node; the angled brackets represent the expected value of the relevant quantity [22] . Meyers [23] showed that in a contact network framework, where T is the mean probability of transmission between individuals and k and k 2 are the mean degree and mean square degree of the network. Here, R 0 depends explicitly on the structure of the network (i.e., on k and k 2 ). A single pathogen may, therefore, have very different transmission dynamics depending on the population through which it spreads. If two networks have the same mean degree, k, then the one with the larger variance in degree, k 2 − k 2 , will be more vulnerable to the spread of disease. In compartment models, infected hosts are assumed to have potentially disease-causing contacts with random individuals from the population according to a Poisson process that yields an average contact rate of β per unit time. The mass-action assumption of compartmental models is tantamount to assuming that the underlying contact patterns form a random graph with a Poisson degree distribution. Estimates of R 0 that assume a mass-action model may, therefore, be invalid for populations with non-Poisson contact patterns and, in particular, will underestimate the actual growth rate of the disease in highly heterogeneous networks. [24] noted that if R 0 > 1 in an agent-based model then, due to the stochastic nature of interactions, it is possible that no epidemic occurs or that it ends early if, by chance, the few initially contagious individuals recover before generating new cases. If R 0 is derived from the next-generation operator so that then the threshold for endemicity is such that the system is reactive when E 0 > 1 and nonreactive when E 0 < 1. E 0 describes the transitory behaviour of disease following a temporary perturbation in prevalence. If the threshold for epidemicity is surpassed, then disease prevalence can increase further even when the disease is not endemic. This suggests that epidemics can occur even in areas where long-term transmission cannot be maintained. Reluga et al. [47] defined the discounted reproductive number R d . The discounted reproductive number is a measure of reproductive success that is an individual's expected lifetime offspring production discounted by the background population growth rate. It is calculated as where δ is the discount rate, I is the identity matrix, and F and V are from the next-generation matrix decomposition. R d combines properties of both the basic reproductive number and the ultimate proliferation rate although it also inherits the nonuniqueness problems from the nextgeneration method. Nishiura [4] developed a likelihood-based method for estimating R 0 without assuming exponential growth of cases and offers a corrected value of the actual reproduction number. The author noted that R 0 is extremely sensitive to dispersal of the progression of a disease or variations in the underlying epidemiological assumptions.
