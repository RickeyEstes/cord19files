Cell culture is a central way of viral detection, which facilitates downstream analysis with other laboratory methods including electronmicroscopy (EM), serology and PCR. Detection of antibodies induced by a certain agent in a host is also a conventional approach [47] . The conventional detection methods are seriously hampered by the fact that many potential EAs do not replicate in cell culture, or a suitable animal model has not been identified. However, the discovery of unknown non-cultivable viruses is ongoing and several methods were used for the identification of unknown noncultivable agents such as EM [48, 49] , EM combined with serology [50, 51] or immune serum to screen peptide expression libraries generated from samples infected with unknown viruses [52] . Nucleic acid based detection methods are so sensitive that they detect small numbers of viruses that may occur in the absence of disease. The limitation of these methods is the need of a priori knowledge of the viral nucleic acid sequence to be detected [53] . Moreover, the interpretation of PCR positive results is also complex and often required further testing, considering the fact molecular techniques like PCR detects nucleic acids and not infectivity. RNase/DNase digestion prior to PCR both improves the sensitivity of detection by removal of background DNA and as the nucleic acid in the virion is protected from DNase/RNase, the obtained PCR positivity profoundly indicates the presence of intact (perhaps infective) virions [54] . This may help to address the question if only non-infective genomic fragment or a native virion were detected by PCR. Besides traditional PCR many variants of the real-time PCR assays had been developed. These methods highly vary in which chemistries are used e.g. TaqMan, molecular beacons (MB), scorpion primers, dual probe systems, dye-labelled oligonucleotide ligation or Primer-Probe Energy Transfer System (PriProET) [55] . Compared to traditional PCR the real-time assays are faster, nearly equally sensitive and allow quantification. Their throughput is higher, the risk of contamination is lower as there is no need to open the test tube for post-PCR handling of the product. Real-time PCR allows automation and multiplexing, because probes can be labelled with a number of different fluorophores leading to lower diagnostic costs as final consequence [55] . In veterinary field real-time PCR are taking over traditional PCRs. PriProET was suggested having the most robust diagnostic potential among others real-time PCR variants, because PriProET needs shorter conserved region to hybridise and less fragile to single point mutation [56, 57] . So-called proximity ligation offers a novel mean to detect antibody by nucleic acid amplification. In this method antibodies recognising viral or bacterial surface proteins are bound to DNA strands. These DNA strands can be ligated and subsequently amplified by a real-time PCR when antibodies are bound to surface antigens of the infectious agent [58] . Considering all different types of PCR the common feature is that the interpretation of PCR results can be difficult from a risk assessment point of view. For instance, lower risk may be posed by a contamination, which is non-specific to the species targeted by the contaminated vaccine [59] . However, the possibility of crossspecies contamination may undermine the simplicity of this approach as in case of bovine spongiform encephalitis which was shown to be able to cross the species barrier between bovines and humans [59, 60] . The use of most recent technical developments including sequence-independent molecular techniques combined with highthroughput sequencing or microarray analysis may improve and accelerate the viral discovery. PCV1 in Rotarix and SRV in Rotateq were revealed both by Massive Parallel Sequencing (MPS) combined with the sequence-independent nucleic acid techniques and microarray tests on RNase/DNase digested samples [37] . Both random PCR combined with MPS and microarray tests have the advantage to detect a much wider range of potential extraneous agents than the currently mandated methods like cell cultures or agent-specific PCR [37] . The strength of metagenomics is that this method does not target any specific virus/pathogen, but has a general capacity to detect a wide range of infectious agents, including unknown emerging novel viruses. The advantage of microarrays is the potential of highly multiplexed detection of EAs. Numerous microbes can be simultaneously detected by microarray using !70 nucleotides long probes provided melting temperatures are high enough to ensure hybridisation despite the restricted complementary between probe and target. Nevertheless, both metagenomics and microarray test have their own limitations. PCR is more sensitive than either metagenomics or microarrays when screening for specific viruses. Without the pre-amplification of the clinical sample most microarrays are not sensitive enough [61] . The use of random PCR step prior to microarray hybridisation can improve the sensitivity of microarrays enabling in the same time the detection of EAs without any a priori knowledge of the infectious agent. Considering the fact PCR-based random amplification of whole genome was demonstrated to generate incomplete coverage of genome, Erlandsson et al. [62] used isothermal multiple displacement amplification of whole genomes by the Phi29 polymerase. Phi29 polymerase allows very good coverage of the genomes because of its high processivity and extremely low error rate [62] . Phi29 polymerase can also be used for improvement of sensitivity of an agent-specific real-time PCR [63] . In the so-called AMP-PCR, an unbiased random Phi29 preamplification is carried out before a specific real-time PCR reaction. Thus, AMP-PCR increases the specific PCR signal allowing the detection of positive samples normally under the detection limit of the specific real-time PCR. As AMP-PCR reaction takes place in one vessel, the risk of contamination is eliminated and nested PCR can be replaced by AMP-PCR in situations where increased sensitivity is needed e.g. in routine PCR diagnostic analysis [63] . Altogether the use of metagenomics and microarrays may offer new perspectives in the vaccine quality control allowing detection further À probably at present unknownÀ agents in vaccines without any a priori (genetic) knowledge of these agents, or any a priori suspicion of contamination.
