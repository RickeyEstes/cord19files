Cell lines and reagents. HeLa R19 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin and grown at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . The PI4KA inhibitor A1 (50) was kindly provided by T. Balla (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and used at a concentration of 10 nM. Virus infections. Cells were inoculated for 1 h with EMCV wt (strain Mengovirus) or EMCV 3A-A32V (described in reference 26) at an MOI of 50, after which the inoculum was removed and fresh medium (with drug A1 where indicated) was added. At specified time points after infection, cells were prepared for qPCR, viral titer determination, immunofluorescence, or electron microscopy. Quantitative PCR. A NucleoSpin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) was used to isolate RNA from lysed cells. Random hexamer primers were used with a TaqMan reverse transcription reagent kit (Roche) to synthesize cDNA. Quantitative PCR was carried out using the LightCycler 480 SYBR green I master kit (Roche) for 45 cycles (5 s at 95°C, 10 s at 60°C, and 20 s at 72°C) on a LightCycler 480 (Roche). Resulting threshold cycle (C T ) values were expressed as fold increase with the value at t ϭ 2 h set as 1. Viral titer determination. Total virus titers (of intra-and extracellular particles) were determined by freeze-thaw lysis of infected cells and endpoint titration. Immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then labeled with a mouse monoclonal antibody against dsRNA (J2 antibody; English and Scientific Consulting) and secondary Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, alongside a nuclear stain (Hoechst 33342). Imaging was performed using a wide-field DM5500 (Leica) fluorescence microscope. Electron microscopy. (i) Metabolic labeling and autoradiography. Infected cells were preincubated with 10 g/ml dactinomycin for 1 h to inhibit cellular transcription and then labeled for 45 min with tritiated uridine ([5-3 H]uridine; 1 mCi/ml) (PerkinElmer) also containing dactinomycin. Cells were then washed several times to remove unincorporated label and fixed for 1 h in 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. Mock-infected control samples were similarly prepared. Postfixation consisted of a 1-h incubation with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer followed by a 1-h incubation with 1% uranyl acetate solution. Samples were then washed and dehydrated in ethanol and infiltrated and embedded in epoxy resin LX-112 before polymerization at 60°C. Sections of 50 nm were collected on Formvar-coated EM grids, poststained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate, and then carbon coated and prepared for autoradiography. For this, a thin layer of silver halide photographic emulsion (Ilford L4) was applied in the dark to the cell sections. Samples were incubated in the dark and developed after several weeks for autoradiography as described in reference 20. During incubation, the radiolabeled uridine incorporated during viral RNA synthesis decays, and the beta radiation emitted reduces the silver halide to atomic silver. These events manifest as small, electron-dense grains dispersed around the original radioactive source that can be visualized during EM imaging. (ii) High-pressure freezing and freeze substitution. Cells were high-pressure frozen using an EM PACT2 (Leica). Samples were maintained at Ϫ90°C in an AFS2 (Leica) freeze substitution device for 44 h in a solution of 20% H 2 O, 2% osmium tetroxide, and 1% anhydrous glutaraldehyde. A high water content was used as this was found to improve the contrast of RO membranes. The temperature was then raised to 0°C over a period of 22 h through a series of controlled warming phases (identical to those described in reference 21). Samples were washed with acetone, infiltrated with epoxy resin LX-112 (Ladd Research), and polymerized at 60°C. Sections of 70 nm were collected on EM grids and poststained with uranyl Encephalomyocarditis Virus Replication Organelles ® acetate and lead citrate. For tomography, thicker sections of 200 nm were collected. Before poststaining, both sides of the EM grid were incubated with 10-nm colloidal gold beads to serve as fiducial markers during tomogram reconstruction. (iii) Electron microscopy imaging. Thin-section (50-or 70-nm) 2D images were collected (binning mode 2) on a Tecnai12 BioTwin or Twin electron microscope at 120 kV using an Eagle 4k slow-scan charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific [formerly FEI]) or OneView 4k high-framerate camera (Gatan), respectively. For the semiautomated collection of larger areas, meshes of overlapping images were acquired across the entire region of interest and later reconstituted into a single composite image (as described in reference 51). (iv) Electron tomography. Dual-axis tilt series of 200-nm sections each covering 130 to 140°around the region of interest were collected using an F20 electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific [formerly FEI]) at 200 kV with zero-loss energy filtering using a 2k camera (Gatan) and 1.27-nm pixel size. Automated tilt series acquisition was performed using Xplore3D software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tilt series alignment and tomogram reconstruction by weighted back-projection were carried out in IMOD (52) (version 4.7.15). In the process, the gold fiducial markers were digitally erased to be eliminated from the final 3D reconstruction. To determine the sizes of ROs spanning multiple sections, tilt series of the same region across 2 to 5 consecutive sections were collected and combined in IMOD to build tomogram volumes with a z-thickness of~400 to 1,000 nm. The sizes of ROs were estimated by measuring the SMTs, SMVs, and DMVs within reconstructed volumes in IMOD. The maximum widths of SMTs, SMVs, and DMVs were considered the RO diameters. For all calculations, SMTs were approximated to a cylinder, and the inner DMV membrane surface area was considered an approximation of the outer. To generate models of features of interest, image segmentations were made from tomograms using Amira 6.0.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Before segmentation, tomograms were postprocessed to enhance edges by nonlinear anisotropic diffusion filtering (53) as implemented in IMOD using 5 iterations and K ϭ 1,000 and then binned by 2 in x and y. Membranes were selected in manually masked areas by thresholding and then refined by removing islands and smoothing. Surfaces that were poorly represented (e.g., top and bottom surfaces of vesicles and tubules) due to the missing-wedge effect were manually repaired.
