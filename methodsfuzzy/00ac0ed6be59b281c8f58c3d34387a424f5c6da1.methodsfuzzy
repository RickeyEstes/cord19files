For statistical analysis mean lesion scores and the mean of all enteropathogen scores were calculated for upper (511 to 513), middle (514 to 516) and lower (517 to 519) small intestine and large intestine (caecum, colon and rectum); salmonella-infected calves were excluded from the analysis. Correlations were calculated between the two scores at each region.
