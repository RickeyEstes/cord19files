Total ED visits and visits to each area of the ED, time in department, numbers of admissions, and patients in whom viral testing was used were captured in a computerized database. Stata (version 10; StataCorp, College Station, TX) was used for data analysis. Statistical significance was set at PÕ….05 where appropriate. Mann-Whitney test was used for data that were not normally distributed. To determine confidence intervals (CIs), data were log-transformed, and the 95% CIs of mean differences in time in department between the study intervals were calculated. A 95% CI of a natural logarithm that crosses 0 indicates that the null hypothesis of no difference in time in department cannot be excluded.
