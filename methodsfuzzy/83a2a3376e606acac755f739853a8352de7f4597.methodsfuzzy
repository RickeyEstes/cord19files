The cells were cryopreserved in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen until use. The EBOV GP-reactive memory B cells were labeled with the recombinant EBOV GP protein that was produced in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells as described below and purified by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) as described previously (Bornholdt et al., 2016) . This step resulted in $5,000 sorted EBOV GP-reactive memory B cells. Human B cell hybridomas were generated as described previously (Yu et al., 2008) with some modifications. Briefly, FACS-isolated GP-reactive B cells were bulk-expanded on irradiated NIH 3T3 cells that had been engineered to express human IL-21, CD40L (CD154), and BAFF in medium A (STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with CpG, a Chk2 inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich), and cyclosporine A (Sigma-Aldrich). After 8 days cells were bulk-fused with MFP-2 myeloma cells using an established electrofusion technique (Yu et al., 2008) , which resulted in generation of $1,100 individual hybridoma lines. After the fusion reaction, hybridoma lines were cultured in ClonaCell-HY Medium E (STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with HAT (hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine) Media Supplement (Sigma-Aldrich) in 384-well plates for 18 days before screening of supernatants for antibody production. Screening strategy to identify partner mAbs for therapeutic cocktail Our previous work used Jurkat cell surface displayed EBOV GP to assess competition-binding groups of the GP reactive mAbs that isolated from human survivor of EVD outbreak in the DRC . This study revealed that binding of two broadly-reactive glycan cap specific mAbs increases binding of broadly-neutralizing and highly protective base-specific mAbs EBOV-515 and EBOV-520 . Here, for the development of cooperative mAb cocktail, we performed a comprehensive screening from $1,800 individual GP-reactive B cell line supernatants ($1,100 from this study and $750 from previous study with the DRC outbreak survivor) to identify a suitable partner mAb for these potent base-specific mAb. The criteria for down-selection of the partner mAb candidates included (a) high neutralizing activity against live pathogenic virus (neutralizing at least EBOV); (b) broad reactivity to EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GP; (c) synergistic activity that was defined as the ability of mAb to enhance binding of EBOV-515 and EBOV-520 (at least 2-fold enhancement) when compared to binding of the base-specific mAb alone; and (d) efficacy of monotherapy in mice to protect against live EBOV challenge. Supernatants from each well of the 384-well culture plates with expanded hybridoma lines first were assessed for neutralizing activity against live EBOV using one 1:5 supernatant dilution in 96-well plate format as detailed below in the Neutralization assays section. Next, hybridoma lines that fully neutralized EBOV at the supernatant dilution tested were assessed by ELISA for reactivity against recombinant EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GP. The broadly-reactive clones identified were tested for neutralizing activity against live BDBV and SUDV. Hybridoma cell lines producing cross-reactive and neutralizing mAbs (mAbs that reacted to all three GPs and neutralized at least EBOV and BDBV) were cloned biologically by single-cell fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Hybridomas were expanded in Medium E (STEMCELL Technologies) until 50% confluent in 75-cm 2 flasks (Corning). Purified mAbs were tested using a competition-binding assay with intact Jurkat-EBOV GP (A) or thermolysin cleaved Jurkat-EBOV GP CL to identify major antigenic sites. Identified mAbs that (a) competed with the reference glycan cap specific mAbs c13C16 (Davidson et al., 2015) or BDBV289 (Flyak et al., 2916) on intact GP, and (b) recognized intact but not cleaved GP, were assessed for cooperative binding to Jurkat cell surface displayed EBOV GP in the presence of the GP base-specific mAbs EBOV-515 or EBOV-520 (described below). This screening approach resulted in identification of broadly-reactive glycan cap region-specific mAbs EBOV-437, EBOV-442, and EBOV-548. Antibodies EBOV-442 and EBOV-548 potently neutralized EBOV and BDBV and offered partial protection (80 to 40% survival) in vivo in mice lethally challenged with live EBOV. mAb EBOV-548 showed the highest cooperativity with EBOV-515 and EBOV-520; based on this feature it was selected for further testing in the cocktail with EBOV-520.
