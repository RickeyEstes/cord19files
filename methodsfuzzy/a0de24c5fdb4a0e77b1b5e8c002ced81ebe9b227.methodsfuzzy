The initial tests performed on IBV isolates are directed at eliminating other viruses from diagnostic consideration. Chorioallantoic membranes from infected eggs are collected, homogenized, and tested for avian adenovirus group 1 by immunodiffusion or PCR (OIE, 2013). Group 1 avian adenovirus infections of commercial chickens are common, and the virus often produces stunted embryos indistinguishable from IBVinfected embryos. Furthermore, IBV exerts hemagglutination (HA) activity only after phospholipase C treatment of concentrated virusinfected allanto-aminiotic fluids (Bingham et al., 1975) . Genetic-based tests (RT-PCR or RT-PCRÃ€RFLP) are used commonly to identify an isolate as IBV. Also, in situ hybridization can be used to detect viral nucleic acid (Collisson et al., 1990) . IBV can also be detected using immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase on the tracheal or kidney section from the field isolates or on the chorioallantoic membrane from the inoculated embryos (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2009) . Other techniques may be used, for example, cells present in the allantoic fluid of infected eggs may be tested for IBV antigen using fluorescent antibody tests (Clarke et al., 1972) . Furthermore, serotyping of IBV isolates and strains has been done using HA inhibition (King and Hopkins, 1984) . However, nonspecific reactions or lower sensitivity especially in field samples may occur (Benyeda et al., 2010) , for that we needed a reliable technique as and VN tests in chick embryos (Dawson and Gough, 1971 ) and also as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This technique is quick, inexpensive, and sensitive, which is suitable for screening a large number of samples, IBV diagnosis, and serotype identification as well (Karaca and Syed, 1993) . It has been proved useful in grouping and differentiating strains of IBV (Ignjatovic et al., 1991) .
