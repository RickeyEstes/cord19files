The tracing method of airborne bacteria transmission was summarized in Fig. 1 . Selected gene fragment should be specific so that it could not be found in the air environment of the place where the research was conducted. Besides, the selected gene fragment should be compatible so that it could be introduced into the selected nonpathogenic bacteria without affecting its reproduction. The tracer bacteria were synthetized successfully when both of the two above conditions were accomplished, or new gene fragment needed to be selected and tested again. The finished tracer bacteria could be aerosolized into the air environment at a source point using a nebulizer, and airborne bacteria sampling was conducted at the target points. Taking the activity of the airborne bacteria into consideration, the bacteria sampled at the target points should be incubated on solid selective medium, followed by PCR assay and Gel electrophoresis which were used for the detection of the tracer bacteria. Finally, the concentrations of the tracer bacteria and the ratios of the tracer bacteria to the total selected bacteria at the source and different target points could be used for analyzing the transporting process of the microorganism in the air. Serval considerations needed to be taken for the application of this bacterial tracing method. Firstly, specificity tests to confirm the absence of the selected gene fragment in the air environment should be performed. Liquid collision sampling technology of airborne bacteria could be used for the airborne bacteria sampling, followed by PCR assay and Gel electrophoresis analysis to determine whether the selected gene fragment existed or not. Secondly, a successful synthesis of the tracer bacteria should satisfy three simultaneous conditions: natural reproduction capacity, positive reaction of PCR assay and Gel electrophoresis, correct genetic sequencing. Thirdly, the airborne bacteria sampled after the aerosolization needed to be incubated on the solid medium since only the active bacteria which could be cultured on the solid medium was considered. Field experimental site: The field experiment of airborne bacteria transmission was carried out between two side-by-side layer hen houses with the approval of a farm located in Sichuan Province of China from December 2017 to January 2018 ( Fig. 2a and b) . Each experimental house (12.0 m W × 96.0 m L) had a capacity of 65,000 Roman hens (28 week of hen age at the start of the field experiment) and was equipped with manure belts to remove manure out of the house every three days. Both layer hen housing facilities and the environment control system were supplied by Big Dutchman (Vechta, Germany). The distance between the two experimental houses was 11 m and the height of the sidewall inlet (0.8 m × 0.5 m) was 6.1 m. The twenty-eight inlets and three exhaust fans evenly distributed in each side-wall were used for the air exchange in winter. Inside and outside temperature & relative humidity were monitored using HOBO data loggers (Onset Computer Corp., Bourne, MA, USA) with a 5-min interval. Wind speed and direction were recorded by the weather station (BX-5, Jingge Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) installed in the farm. The specificity test before each release indicated that pFPV-mCherry fluorescent protein plasmid was not found in the surrounding environment of the two houses. An air-atomize spraying nozzle was used to aerosolize the liquid nutrient broth with tracer E. coli at a flow rate of 100 mL/min and an air pressure of 30 Psi. As shown in Fig. 2 , the nozzle was installed at the height of the fan axis and 70 cm away from the fan inside the layer hen house. All-glass airborne bacteria impingers (AGI-30, Ace Glass, Inc., Vineland, N.J., USA) were used to collect the airborne E. coli between two houses (points 1-5). The impingers were sterilized in an autoclave at 121°C and 100 kPa for 15 min before each sampling. Each airborne E. coli sampling lasted 15 min. The airborne E. coli were collected in 15 mL of sterilized 0.9% physiological saline solution in the impinger at a stable flow rate of 12.5 L/min. Duplicate 0.1 mL aliquots of the concentrated sample were transferred on five petri dishes with selective medium of E. coli. Then the Petri dishes were incubated at 37°C for 24-48 h. Total E. coli concentration was calculated according to the colony count on the petri dishes. 90 colonies of all the E. coli colonies (or total E. coli colonies if the total E. coli colonies were less than 90) were randomly isolated and cultured in liquid media at 37°C for 6 h for DNA extraction and PCR assay. The proportion of tracer E. coli account for the total E. coli could be used to calculate the tracer E. coli concentration.
