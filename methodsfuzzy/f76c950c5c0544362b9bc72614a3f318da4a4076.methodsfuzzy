The representative complex crystal structures of PPARα (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID 1k7l) and PPARγ (PDB ID 1k74) were downloaded from the PDB, 43, 44 and were to be used for the molecular modeling studies. Our calculations are operated with the Schrödinger software package (version 9.0.111; Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, USA), which runs on a Dell Precision™ T5500 computer (Dell, Round Rock, TX, USA). The molecular dynamic simulation was performed using the Gromacs 4.0 package (www.gromacs.com) for the Linux system.
