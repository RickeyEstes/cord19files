Cell culture and virological techniques SF268 glioblastoma cells (National Cancer Institute Center for Cancer Research ID: 59) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM glutamine, 2 mM non-essential amino acids, 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin at 37uC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 [33, 34] . EV71 (BrCr strain; ATCC VR784) was propagated in Vero cells as described previously [16] . Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) were cultured in modified Eagle's medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 at 37uC. Quantitative PCR analysis of the copy number of EV71 genomic DNA was performed as described previously [16] .
