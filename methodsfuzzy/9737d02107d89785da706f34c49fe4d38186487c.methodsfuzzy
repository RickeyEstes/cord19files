Ex vivo explants culture of human respiratory tract was obtained from patients undergoing surgery at Queen Mary Hospital, according to previously established criteria (Hui et al., 2017) . We selected areas of morphologically normal lung, and histology was performed on a control sample. The samples were subjected to virus culture and bacterial culture. If there was intrinsic disease or infection in the resected lung specimens, they were not used for research. The project was approved by the local institutional review board (UW 14-549).
