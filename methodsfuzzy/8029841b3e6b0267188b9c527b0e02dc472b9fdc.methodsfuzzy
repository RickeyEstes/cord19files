Preparation of PCR mixture and thermal cycling. PCR mixture consisted of 6μ L Roche LightCycler TaqMan Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics, Germany), 1 μ L 20X EvaGreen Dye in water (TATAA, Sweden) as well as forward and reverse primers 15 (Table 1 )(MWG Eurofines, Germany) at a final concentration of 1.8 μ M. To this solution synthetic complementary DNA (cDNA) templates (ATG Biosynthesis, Germany) for haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) for the avian influenza virus (H7N9) were added at different concentrations (see Table 1 ). Lastly the solution was adjusted to a volume of 20 μ L using water obtained from a Milli-Q ProgradT3 column (Millipore, Germany). A droplet with a volume of 150 nL of the PCR solution was placed on a hydrophobically coated microscope glass cover slip and covered with 1.5 μ L of mineral oil 9405 (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) thus forming a VRC. This glass was then placed on a micromachined silicon chip integrated with both a heater and a sensor, similar to a design shown earlier 13 . Here the silicon chip has a size of only 15 × 15 mm to better fit a handheld PCR device we are developing (see Fig. 1 ). The small thermal mass of the VRC together with the silicon heater resulted in heating rates > 20 °C/s and similar cooling rates achieved only by passive cooling. The PCR protocol consisted of a hot start for 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles each consisting of two steps, denaturation for 5 s at 95 °C and annealing/extension for 30 s at 60 °C. Fluorescence amplitude was continuously monitored using an Axiotron II microscope (Zeiss, Germany). We have used a blue LED model M470L3-C4 LED with principal wavelength of 470 nm (Thorlabs, Germany) for excitation. The LED was powered with square wave pulses at a frequency of 2710 Hz and a duty cycle of 5%. Light from the LED as well as emitted light from the specimen was filtered with a filter set model 49002 -ET -EGFP (FITC/Cy2) (Chroma Optical Corp, USA). Emitted light was captured by a PMT photosensor module H10722-20 (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Germany). The PMT signal was processed by a lock-in amplifier 7230 DSP (Ametek, USA) and its output recorded by a digital oscilloscope model DPO 3014 (Tektronix, Germany) with data rate of 2500 measurements per second. The temperature of the PCR chip was also recorded by the oscilloscope at the same data rate. For comparison, samples were also analyzed using the Roche LightCycler Carousel-Based system (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) followed by a standard melting curve after thermal cycling. Data analysis. Captured fluorescence data were analyzed using a custom written Matlab-script. First the data were filtered by a fast Fourier transform filter (FFTF). Subsequently, the fluorescence signal was divided into the individual cycles based on the captured temperature profile. The fluorescence amplitude during transition from extension/annealing step to denaturation step was then extracted for each cycle and fluorescence as function of temperature was plotted with cycle number as a parameter. MCA was formed by numerical differentiation of the fluorescence with respect to temperature and its negative value was plotted as a function of temperature. The melting curve captured at the first cycle was subtracted from all melting curves to suppress a background fluorescence effect we have observed. This background fluorescence could be caused by autofluorescence from the adjacent printed circuit board as well as fluorescence of the temperature dependence of the fluorophore as well as unspecific binding of the dye onto single stranded DNA 16 . PCR amplification curves were created by plotting amplitudes at the MCA of each amplicon as a function of the cycle number.
