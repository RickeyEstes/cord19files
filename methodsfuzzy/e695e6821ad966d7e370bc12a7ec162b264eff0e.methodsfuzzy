Between January 2004 and December 2012, 273 primary TNBC patients treated with taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. Blood samples were collected from each patient. Patients were followed up until July 30, 2017, to collect data on recurrence and death. The disease-free survival (DFS) time was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis until the date of first locoregional recurrence, first distant metastasis, or death from any cause (whichever came first). Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of death from any reason or last follow-up. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue samples were obtained from the patients. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed with anti-ER and anti-PR antibodies was used to evaluate the ER and PR status. A positive ER and PR status was defined by nuclear staining of more than 1% according to the guidelines issued by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAPs) in 2010. 16 To determine the HER2 status, IHC or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed. 17 Tumors negative for ER, PR, and HER2 were defined as TNBCs.
