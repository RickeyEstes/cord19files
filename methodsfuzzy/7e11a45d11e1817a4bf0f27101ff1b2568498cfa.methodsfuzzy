In vitro assays usually exploit the virus's ability to infect and replicate in specific cell lines in cell culture systems. The cell culture system provides a rapid and less cumbersome method to grow viruses at higher titres, vaccine strain cultures, reverse genetics and testing of anti-viral compounds. An example of cell lines characterised and routinely used for common viruses is provided in Table 2 .
