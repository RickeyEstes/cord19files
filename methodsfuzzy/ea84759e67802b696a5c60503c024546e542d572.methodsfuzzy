Culturing and labeling virus. Strains of influenza A virus amenable to site specific labeling on HA, NA, and NP were designed and characterized as described previously (Vahey and Fletcher, 10 2018). Briefly, viruses expressing HA with five consecutive glycine residues following the signal sequence (for labeling via Sortase A (Theile et al., 2013) ), NA with a c-terminal ybbR tag (for labeling via SFP synthase (Yin et al., 2006) ), and NP with a c-terminal tetracysteine motif (for labeling via direct binding of biarsenical dye FlAsH (Griffin, 1998)) were rescued using reverse genetics (Hoffmann et al., 2000) . Viruses used for experiments were collected from confluent 15 monolayers of MDCK-II cells infected at MOI ~ 1 and grown for 16 hours at 37 o C in virus growth media (MEM, 0.25% BSA, and penicillin/streptomycin). Media containing virus was collected, centrifuged at 2000×g for five minutes to remove cell debris, and treated with 10mU/ml soluble sialidase (from C. Perfringens, Sigma N2876) to ensure that viruses were well dispersed. Viruses were labeled in solution for 90 minutes at room temperature using NTC buffer (100nM NaCl, 20 20mM Tris pH 7.6, 5mM CaCl2) supplemented with 5mM MgCl2, Sortase A (180µM enzyme, 50µM CLPETGG peptide) and SFP synthase (5µM enzyme, 5µM CoA probe). Following labeling, Capto Core 700 beads (GE Healthcare; ~1:1 resin volume to sample volume) were used to remove residual dyes and enzymes from the solution of labeled virus. For labeling NP with the biarsenical dye FlAsH, viruses were immobilized on coverslips, washed in NTC buffer, and incubated with 25 2µM FlAsH for 30 minutes at room temperature.
