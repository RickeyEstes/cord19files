Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney; ATCC 1586) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Huh 7 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cells were obtained from Dr. Hideki Ebihara (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Hamilton, MT). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were prepared from human whole blood (Biological Specialty Corporation; Colmar, PA; Cat # 3100-03-04) and human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells at the Integrated Research Facility (IRF) immunology core laboratories as described previously [62, 63] . hMDM were characterized by flow cytometric analysis for expression of major macrophage markers, including human leukocyte antigen-D related, CD11b, CD14, CD163, and CD86, to confirm that the hMDM population was mature and highly purified [63] . HEK 293T/17 (Human embryonic kidney; ATCC CRL-11268 via University of Virginia Tissue Culture Facility) and BSC-1 (Grivet monkey kidney; gift from Dr. Xiaowei Zhuang, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) cells were maintained in growth medium: high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, all from Gibco Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA), and either 10% supplemented calf serum (SCS; Hyclone, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) for HEK 293T/17 cells or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Seradigm, VWR International, Radnor, PA) or 10% cosmic calf serum (CCS, Hyclone) for BSC-1 cells.
