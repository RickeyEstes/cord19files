SARS-CoV RNA and cDNA preparation. The SARS-CoV strain used in this study originated from a deceased WHO physician in Vietnam (US CDC isolate known as strain Urbani; Rota et al., 2003) and was obtained from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Twenty throat swabs of acute respiratory disease (ARD) patients from Fort Jackson, South Carolina were obtained from collections of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, Maryland as negative controls for the SARS-CoV assay (McNeill et al., 2000) . The viral RNA was extracted and transcribed into SARS-CoV cDNA through reverse transcription (RT) reaction using a commercial RNA extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.) and a RT kit (PE Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, California). RNA was mixed with RT reaction mixture containing anti-sense SARS-CoV RT primer (5 -CATTATTCACTGTACCCTCGATCG-3 , 20 pmol/reaction) according to the manufacture's instruction. The RT mixture was incubated as followings, 25 • C, 10 min; 48 • C, 30 min; 95 • C, 5 min. The resultant cDNA was stored at −20 • C until tested. Fluorogenic probe/primers and PCR conditions. The fluorogenic probe (FAM-TTTCATCGAGGCCACGCGGAG-TAMRA) and its flanking primer pair (sense primer, 5 -GGACTTGAAAGAGCCACCACA-3 & and anti-sense primer, 5 -CATTATTCACTGTACCCTCGATCG-3 ) were designed based on the conserved SARS-CoV 3 -NCR of Canadian Tor2 isolate (Marra et al., 2003 ; GenBank accession #278554) and were purchased from PE Applied Biosystems Inc. (Foster City, California). PCR master mixture contained the following ingredients: 1X ABI PCR buffer II, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0.4 mM dNTPs', 200 nM HCV-U4 upper primer, 200 nM HCV-L4 lower primer, 20 nM HCV-P4 fluorogenic Taqman probe labeled with 3 -FAM reporter dye and 5 -TAMRA quencher dye, 1.25 unit Taq DNA polymerase (AmpliTaq Gold, ABI, Foster City, California). Two microliter of viral cDNA derived from the RT reaction was mixed with 48 l PCR master mixture. The PCR-cDNA mixture was subjected to the following amplification conditions: 95 • C, 10 min heat activation of AmpliTaq Gold enzyme; 40 cycles of 95 • C, 15 s; 58 • C, 40 s. Two commercially available fluorogenic thermocyclers were used to perform the real-time RT-PCR assay developed in this report, the Rotor-Gene Real-Time PCR thermocycler (Westburg BV Inc., Leusden, The Netherlands), and the MJ Opticon I DNA Engine (MJ Inc., Massachusetts). Construction and isolation of the recombinant plasmid containing the SARS-CoV 3 -NCR. The sense and anti-sense primers of SARS-CoV were used to generate SARS-CoV cDNA through 35 cycles of PCR amplification. The SARS-CoV 3 -NCR PCR amplicon was then cloned into the SmaI site of pUC19 vector using TA-cloning protocol (Mezei and Storts, 1994) . The ligated vector-cDNA mixture was transformed into E. coli JM109 host. One of the recombinant plasmid clones, pHCV1 was identified as X-gal negative after incubating overnight at 37 • C on selective LB agar plate containing ampicillin and adequate X-gal, IPTG substrates. The pHCV1 plasmid was extracted and purified by modified alkaline lysis and CsCl-gradient centrifugation from 50 ml of overnight LB broth culture containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin.
