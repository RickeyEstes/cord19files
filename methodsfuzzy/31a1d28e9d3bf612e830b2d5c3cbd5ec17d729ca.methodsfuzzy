The NOS activity in haemocytes of shrimps was determined with NBT reduction method, according to Weiske and Wiesner [15] . The procedure was introduced brieXy as below: 500 l LPS solution [0.1 M Bis-Tris buVer containing 200 g/ml LPS (Sigma L2630)] [14] was mixed with 500 l haemocytes suspension with cell density of 10 6 and incubated at 4°C for 4 hours. The mixture was then centrifuged at 600g for 2 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was discarded. The residue haemocytes were Wxed with 4% formaldehyde (dissolved in 0.1 M Tris buVer with Wnal pH of 7.5-8.0) for 20 min, and the cells were washed at least twice with 0.1 M Tris buVer [pH 7.8, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Serva 37240)]. The cells were then resuspended in the freshly prepared 0.01% NBT (Sigma N6876) solution [in 0.1 M Tris buVer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.01% NADPH (Sigma N1630)] and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Subsequently the mixture was centrifuged at 600g for 5 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was replaced with 0.7 ml of 70% methanol. After intensive mixing and a further centrifugation step at 600g for 10 min at room temperature, the methanol was replaced with 0.6 ml DMSO solution [54% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma D8779) and 46% (v/v) 2 N KOH] to dissolve the formazan. After a Wnal incubation for 30 min at room temperature with intensive mixing at 10 min intervals, the contents were centrifuged at 10,000g for 5 min at room temperature, and the absorbance of the resulting supernatants was determined at 670 nm (BECKMAN DU 650 spectrophotometer). The NADPH in the 0.01% NBT solution was replaced with NADH (Sigma N8129) was used as control.
