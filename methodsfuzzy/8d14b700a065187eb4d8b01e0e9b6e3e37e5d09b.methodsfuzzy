The executable of vsfold5 (vsfold5++) is available upon request under the following formats: Linux (Fedora Core 2, 4), Mac (OSX 3 and 4), Microsoft Visual C++(2005) and cygwin (gcc 3.4). Requests, comments, bug reports and suggestions for meeting particular needs and interests or improving the usability of the software are certainly welcome and should be addressed to the corresponding author. The theoretical foundations of the cross linking entropy model for secondary structure are found in Ref. [13] and related references therein. The details of the algorithm, the time complexity (computation costs), memory demands, and thermodynamics for pseudoknots are explained in detail in Text S2. Vsfold5 has the capacity to build the same level of structural complexity as existing algorithms if an appropriate folding pathway can be discerned. Here we express several highlights of the approach. . Some basic concepts of pseudoknot structure and folding that are considered in the vsfold5 algorithm. (a) Basic concept of folding for a core pseudoknot. The stable secondary structure is formed first, followed by addition of stem into the loop. The red region corresponds to the point where the linkage stem forms. (b) Basic concept of folding for an extended pseudoknot. An extended pseudoknot involves the fusing of two independent domains via a small segment of secondary structure. As in (a), this stable secondary structure is formed first, followed by joining the two independent domains into a single domain. (c) Basic concept of an embedded pseudoknot. Here, the secondary structure naturally permits a multibranch loop to form, and the extended pseudoknot that links two branches of the secondary structure is shown here in thermodynamic equilibrium with the standard secondary structure. (d) Basic concept of pleating. The secondary structure (shown above in d), appears to require a very long free strand region (green) to insure that the red segment of secondary structure is formed. However, when this is viewed more three dimensionally, the internal loop permits this structure to fold back on itself and requires a much shorter segment length. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000905.g004
