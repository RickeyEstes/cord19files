Bacterial strains. Community-acquired MRSA SF8300 (USA300) and its isogenic ClfA deletion mutant (Δclfa) were previously described (23) . NRS strains were obtained from the Network on Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (NARSA). ARC strains were obtained from the Astra Zeneca Research Collection, and strains identified with a number beginning with 304 were obtained from Eurofins. All strains and their corresponding multilocus sequence types (MLST) and ClfA genotypes are summarized in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Whole-genome sequencing and analysis. DNA was purified from bacterial cultures via bead beating followed by extraction using a PureLink genomic DNA minikit (ThermoFisher). Sequencing libraries were prepared by Covaris mechanical shearing followed by a NEBNext Ultra DNA library preparation kit for Illumina (New England BioLabs Inc.). Sequencing was performed via MiSeq 2 ϫ 250 runs (Illumina) with a targeted depth of 150-fold. Reads were de novo assembled (CLCBio Genomic Workbench 9.0.1), and clfA open reading frames were extracted and translated to protein sequences. ClfA protein alleles in the present study were matched to the allele numbering by Murphy et al. (16) by comparing all sequences (this study and GenBank accession numbers HQ424254 to HQ424312) to a common reference, USA300_FPR3757. MLSTs were determined using SRST2 (54) and the S. aureus MLST profiles (http://pubmlst.org). ClfA MAb generation. Memory B cells were isolated from cryopreserved lymphocytes isolated from tonsils using phycoerythrin (PE)-Cy7-labeled CD19 microbeads (BD Biosciences), followed by staining with anti-PE beads (Miltenyi Biotec) and depletion of cells carrying IgM, IgD, and IgA by cell sorting on a FACSAria (BD Biosciences). Cells were immortalized under clonal conditions with Epstein-Barr virus as described previously (55) . After 2 weeks, the culture supernatants were screened for the presence of ClfA001-specific MAbs using a 384-well-based ELISA. Positive cultures were expanded in complete RPMI medium and selected for their ability to bind to ClfA genotypes 001, 002, and 004 with high affinity. The VH and VL sequences were retrieved by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Cloning and expression of the ClfA variants. ClfA sequences corresponding to the N2N3 domain (amino acids 221 to 559) of ClfA genotypes 001, 002, and 004 were obtained from GenBank (accession numbers HG424254, HQ424255, and HQ424257) (16) . DNA encoding each sequence was codon optimized and subcloned into pET28a(ϩ) with an AviTag biotinylation signal (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE) cloned into the 5= end of the clfA coding sequence and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Biotinylation was induced after cotransformation of BL21(D3) cells with an isopropyl-␤-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)inducible plasmid containing the birA gene, encoding biotin ligase, and AviTag-ClfA containing pET28a(ϩ). Recombinant proteins were purified from E. coli lysates using a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A (25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, with 500 mM NaCl). The column was washed with buffer A followed by 1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate in buffer A for endotoxin removal. Impurities were removed with a 25 mM imidazole (Teknova) wash, and then ClfA was eluted with a linear gradient to 500 mM imidazole. The ClfAcontaining fractions were pooled and dialyzed into Q buffer A (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5). The lysates were then loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap Q Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a linear gradient to 500 mM NaCl. Fractions containing pure ClfA were dialyzed into 1ϫ phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, and aliquots were frozen at Ϫ80°C. Bispecific antibodies. Bispecific antibodies were generated as previously described (11, 14) . Briefly, anti-ClfA MAb 11H10 or SAR114 was used as the IgG scaffold, and MEDI4893* was grafted in scFv format. MEDI4893* scFv was synthesized in the VL-VH format with a 20-amino-acid (GGGGSx4) linker between the light and heavy variable domains (GeneArt, Life Technologies, IL). BiS 2 Abs were constructed by fusing MEDI893* scFv sequences to the N terminus of the heavy chain of 11H10 or SAR114 anti-ClfA IgG1. BiS 3 constructs were generated by appending the linker-scFv of MEDI4893* to the C terminus of the heavy chain of 11H10 or SAR114. BiS 2 and BiS 3 molecules were expressed by transient transfection in 293 cells, purified by protein A affinity chromatography, and polished by size exclusion chromatography. The integrity of each molecule was assessed by mass spectrophotometry and by intact mass and peptide mapping to verify proper formation of engineered and endogenous disulfide bounds. Hemolytic assay. Rabbit red blood cell (RBC) hemolytic assay was performed as described previously (56) . Briefly, serial dilutions of the BiSAbs and MEDI4893* (500 to 1.7 nM) were mixed with alpha-toxin (0.1 g/ml ϭ 3 nM) and incubated with 50 l of washed rabbit RBC (Peel Freeze) for 1 h at 37°C. In some assays, anti-alpha-toxin scFv of BiSAb was saturated with a 10 M excess of ClfA (5 M). Plates then were centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 3 min, and 50 l of supernatant was transferred to new plates. Nonspecific human IgG1 R347 was used as a negative control (c-IgG) (56) . The optical density at 450 nm (OD 450 ) was measured with a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). Inhibition of hemolysis was calculated as 100 Ϫ [100 ϫ (OD alpha-toxinϩMAb /OD alpha-toxin )]. Fibrinogen binding assay. Nunc MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated overnight at 4°C with 2 g/ml human fibrinogen (Sigma), washed 3ϫ with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (wash buffer), and blocked for 1 h at room temperature (RT) with 200 l/well casein (Thermo Fisher). Following 3 washes, the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a mix of 50 l AviTag ClfA 221-559 (2 g/ml) and serial dilutions of anti-ClfA MAb or BiSAb in a 100-l final volume of PBS. In some assays, anti-ClfA IgG1 of BisAb was saturated with a 10 M excess of alpha-toxin (6.6 mM). After washes, bound ClfA was detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (1:20,000; GE Healthcare) and then 100 l 3,3=,5,5=-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (KPL). The reaction was stopped after 10 min with 100 l 0.2 M H 2 SO 4 . The OD 450 s on plates were read on a spectrophotometer. The percent inhibition of ClfA binding to fibrinogen was calculated with the following formula: 100 Ϫ [100 ϫ (OD ClfAϩMAb /OD ClfA,no MAb )]. Agglutination inhibition in human plasma. S. aureus clinical isolates were cultured overnight in Tryptic soy broth, washed in PBS, and suspended to one-tenth of the original volume in ice-cold PBS. Anti-ClfA MAbs or BiSAbs were serially diluted (2-fold) in 30 l PBS starting at 200 g/ml and mixed with 30 l of citrated human plasma in a 96-well U-bottom plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Bacteria were added (30 l) and incubated for 5 min at 37°C. Each well was evaluated visually, and the lowest MAb concentration where bacteria agglutinated was recorded. R347, a human anti-gp120 MAb, was utilized as an isotype control human IgG1 (c-IgG). Opsonophagocytic killing assay. HL-60 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), and OPK assay was conducted as previously described (9) . Measurement of kinetic rate and binding constants by Biacore. Kinetic rate constants (K on and K off ) for binding of the anti-ClfA MAbs to ClfA genotypes ClfA001, ClfA002, and ClfA004 were measured using an IgG capture assay CM4 sensor chip with a final surface density of 500 resonance units (RUs) on a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). A reference flow cell surface was also prepared on a CM4 sensor chip using the identical immobilization protocol without MAbs. Anti-ClfA MAbs were prepared at 25 nM (100 nM for Bis 2 -SAR114) in immobilization buffer (10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4), along with 3-fold serial dilutions of ClfA (0.009 nM to 20 nM for SAR114 and Bis 2 -SAR114; 0.91 to 2,000 nM ClfA001 and 2.28 to 5,000 nM ClfA002 and ClfA004 for 11H10 and Bis 2 -11H10) in instrument buffer (HBS-EP buffer; 0.01 M HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.005% P-20). Each concentration of ClfA was first injected over the immobilized MAbs and reference surfaces at a flow rate of 75 l/min for 60 s. The resulting binding response curves yielded the association phase data. Following the injection of ClfA, the flow was then switched back to instrument buffer for 15 min (3 h for 2 highest concentrations of ClfA001) to permit collection of dissociation phase data, followed by a 1-min pulse of 10 mM glycine, pH 1.7, to regenerate the IgG-immobilized surface on the chip. Binding responses from duplicate injections of each concentration of ClfA were recorded for all MAbs. In addition, several buffer injections were interspersed throughout the injection series. Select buffer injections were used along with the reference cell responses to correct the raw data sets for injection artifacts and/or nonspecific binding interactions. Fully corrected binding data were then fit to a 1:1 binding model (Biacore T200 evaluation software, version 2.0; Biacore, Inc.) that included a term to correct for mass transport-limited binding, should it be detected. These analyses determined the kinetic rate constants K on and K off , from which the apparent dissociation constant (K D ) was calculated as K off /K on . Competition binding. Anti-ClfA MAbs 11H10 and SAR114 were tested in a competition assay for binding to ClfA001 on an Octet RED96 system (FortéBio). Briefly, MAbs diluted at 5 g/ml in PBS were captured on an aminopropylsilane (APS) biosensor for 7 min. Coated biosensors were moved into blocking buffer-containing wells (PBS, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin [Sigma]) for 6 min to block free sensor binding sites, subsequently incubated for 7 min with 2.5 g/ml ClfA001 diluted in blocking buffer, and finally moved into wells containing the competing MAbs diluted at 5 g/ml in blocking buffer. Data were analyzed using the Octet data acquisition and analysis software. The absence of association of the competing MAb resulted in competition and, thus, recognition of the same antigenic site, while noncompetition is obtained when association of the second MAb was detected. Mouse models. All experiments were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines following experimental protocol review and approval by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at MedImmune. Lethal bacteremia. Groups of 10 6-to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice (Harlan) were passively immunized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of c-IgG, BiS molecules, or the anti-ClfA MAb-MEDI4893* combination and then challenged 24 h later by intravenous (i.v.) injection with the 90% lethal dose (LD 90 ) of each S. aureus isolate. Survival was monitored for 2 weeks. Statistical analysis of a specific antistaphylococcal antigen versus c-IgG was performed with a log rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Data were considered statistically different at a P value of Ͻ0.05, indicated with an asterisk. Pneumonia. Female C57/B6 mice (Jackson) were injected i.p. with MEDI4893* or BiS molecule, and pneumonia was induced by intranasal infection with SF8300 (1e8 CFU) as described previously (8) . Animal survival was monitored for 6 days. Statistical analysis versus c-IgG was performed with a log rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Data were considered statistically different at a P value of Ͻ0.05, indicated with an asterisk.
