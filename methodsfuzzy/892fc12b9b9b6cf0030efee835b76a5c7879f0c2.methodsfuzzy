Materials Luminometer and the Bright Glo TM luciferase assay system. The pseudotype particles generated in the absence of viral envelope (Delta) show increased luciferase activity compared to cell only in part due to transformation method used to discern RLU per ml. The presence of some carry-over luciferase within viral particles is also likely to generate an increase in RLU values recorded (Table 1 ). Fig. 3 shows percentage neutralisation of the MERS-CoV pseudotype with commercially produced anti-MERS spike antibody. Figure clearly indicates that as the dilution factor increases, so the percentage neutralisation decreases, 100% neutralisation indicates that RLU values at this concentration are equivalent to a delta envelope control. The protocol outlined here provides a rapid and consistent method for the generation of high-titre viral pseudotype particles expressing the MERS-CoV spike protein suitable for further downstream applications [2, 4, 5, 7] . Efficient knock-down of pseudotype virus entry using a polyclonal antibody directed against the spike glycoprotein (Fig. 3 ) demonstrates potential utility for vaccine immunogenicity and Mab/antiviral screening [3] . The use of readily available reagents should facilitate increased reproducibility [1, 6, [9] [10] [11] [12] .
