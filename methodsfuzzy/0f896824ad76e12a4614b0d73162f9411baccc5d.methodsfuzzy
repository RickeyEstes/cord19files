Plasmid clones pUBRC1 (Mizumoto et al., 2006) and pUBRC2 (Takeda et al., 2005) were previously described as plasmids from which wildtype RCNMV Australian strain RNA1 and RNA2, respectively, were transcribed from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in the introduced cells. pUBRC1-p27 was created by insertion of the SacI/SmaI fragment containing RCNMV RNA1 mutant cDNA from pBICRC1-p27 (Takeda et al., 2005) into pUC118 at the corresponding sites. pUBRC1-p27dCP and pUBRC1-p88u-dCP were derived from pUBRC1-p27 and pUBRC1-p88u, respectively, in which the XhoI/SacII region was replaced with that from pBICRC1-Î”CP (Takeda et al., 2005) . Other mutants, pUBRC1-p88u, pUBRC1-871A, pUBRC1-871G, pUBRC1-871C, and pUBRC1-p88uGVD were created by PCR-based in vitro mutagenesis from pUBRC1. In short, recombinant PCR products were digested by appropriate restriction enzymes that had unique recognition sites neighboring the mutation sites in pUBRC1, and the fragments containing the mutation substituted the corresponding fragments in pUBRC1. The absence of unexpected base change was confirmed by sequencing the resulting plasmids. These RNA1 mutants transcribed from pUBRC1 plasmids with harboring mutations are summarized in Fig. 1 . The plasmids for protein expression, pUBp27 and pUBp88 were previously described (Takeda et al., 2005) . All infectious DNA plasmids were prepared by using QIAGEN Plasmid Midi Kit (QIAGEN). The plasmids pUCR1-871A, pUCR1-871A-dCP, pUCR1-p88u and pUCR1-p88u-dCP were created by replacement of the Aor51HI-BsiWI region in pUCR1 (Takeda et al., 2005) with the corresponding regions from pUBRC1-871A, pUBRC1-871-dCP, pUBRC1-p88u and pUBRC1-p88u-dCP, respectively. RNA transcripts were synthesized from these plasmids by T7 RNA polymerase after linearization by XmaI.
