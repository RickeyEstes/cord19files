Cells and virus. Primary PAMs were prepared as previously described (38) . PAM cell line 3D4/21 (CRL-2843) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT, USA) at 37˚C, with 5% CO 2 . The HP-PRRSV JXwn06 (GenBank accession no. EF641008) and low pathogenic PRRSV HB-1/3.9 (GenBank accession no. EU360130) were used in this study (39) . miRNA target predictions. To analyze the interaction between cellular miRNAs and porcine IFN-β 3'UTR, we selected a serial of miRNAs, especially porcine let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 obtained from miRBase (http://www.mirbase. org), and predicted miRNA-targeted binding sequences in porcine IFN-β 3'UTR, whose sequences were from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank), by miRanda (40), RNA hybrid (41) and PITA (42) . miRNA mimics and miRNA inhibitors. Based on the sequences of porcine cellular miRNAs, including let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145, miRNA mimics and miRNA inhibitors and negative control were designed (Table I) , and were synthesized with 2'-O-methyl modification by Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Plasmid construction. T h ree plasm ids including pmirGLO-IFN-β 3'UTR, pmirGLO-miRNA recognition elements (MRE)-wild type (wt) and pmirGLO-MRE-mutant type (mut) were constructed based on the pmirGLO dual-luciferase miRNA target expression vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. To construct pmirGLO-IFN-β 3'UTR, the PCR amplification primers were designed by Primer Premier v5.0 according to the sequence of porcine IFN-β 3'UTR (GenBank accession no. M86762). PmeI and XbaI restriction enzyme sites (underlined letters) were introduced in the upstream forward primer (5'-ATAGTTTAAACACATCTCCCCCCTGTGGCT-3') and downstream reverse primer (5'-TGCTCTAGAGGATCCT TAACCCACTGATCCAG-3'), respectively. Taken PAMs genomic DNA as template, PCR was performed to generate porcine IFN-β 3'UTR by high-fidelity PrimeSTAR ® HS DNA Polymerase (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China) according to manufacturer's instructions. After digested with PmeI and XbaI, both porcine IFN-β 3'UTR gene fragments and pmirGLO dual firefly/Renilla luciferase miRNA target expression vector were ligated together by T4 DNA ligase (Promega Corp.) following the manufacturer's protocol. To generate pmirGLO-MRE-wt and pmirGLO-MRE-mut, according to the predicted MRE in porcine IFN-β 3'UTR for let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145, the DNA fragments of wild-type MRE and mutant-type MRE (base mutations in the seed region) with NotI restriction endonuclease sites were prepared by annealing the primer pairs listed in Table II under the following conductions: 94˚C 4 min, 70˚C 10 sec, 65˚C 10 sec, 60˚C 10 sec, 58˚C 10 sec, 55˚C 10 sec, 55˚C water bath to cool for 90 min, and then the resulting product DNA fragments were cloned into the pmirGLO dual firefly/Renilla luciferase miRNA target expression vector previously digested with PmeI and XbaI, by T4 DNA ligase according to manufacturer's instructions. All plasmids were verified by digesting with NotI and sequencing. Transient transfection and PRRSV infections. The 3D4/21 cells were seeded in 24-well cell culture plates and incubated overnight until the cell density reached 70-80%, then transfected by FuGENE ® HD Transfection Reagent (Promega Corp.) according to manufacturer's instructions using the modified method in our recent study (43) . Briefly, 500 µl serum and antibiotic-free opti-MEM were added in sterile 1.5 ml centrifuge tube, then FuGENE ® HD transfection reagent was added in accordance with the proportion required, and mixed gently and placed at room temperature for 15 min; 0.5 µg plasmid DNA and miRNA mimics at a final concentration of 10 or 40 or 60 nM, were added and mixed gently and placed at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was given to  F and R, primer pairs were annealed and inserted into pmirGLO dual-luciferase miRNA target expression vector digested with PmeI and XbaI; b NotI restriction endonuclease site is underlined; MRE, miRNA recognition elements; IFN-β, interferon-β; 3'UTR, 3' untranslated region. the culture plates, and then mixed gently, treated at 37˚C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 for 24 h. Primary PAMs with a density of about 0.5-1x10 5 cells per ml were seeded in 24-well culture plates, cultured at 37˚C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 overnight. After changing to fresh medium, the cells were transfected transiently with miRNA mimics and inhibitors by HiPerFect ® transfection reagent (Qiagen China Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) according to manufacturer's instructions as previously described (44) . Briefly, miRNA mimics at a final concentration of 10 or 40 nM, or miRNA inhibitors at 20 or 40 or 100 nM were added in 100 µl serum and antibiotic-free opti-MEM in sterile 1.5 ml centrifuge tube, and then the HiPerFect ® transfection reagent in corresponding volume ratio following the instructions was added, and treated at room temperature for 5-10 min after being mixed. The mixture was given to the culture plates after shaking gently, cultured at 37˚C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . For viral infections, prepared primary PAMs were seeded in 6-well culture plates, and divided into three groups including JXwn06-infected group, HB-1/3.9-infected group and mock-infected group as control. In PRRSV-infected groups, PAMs were inoculated with JXwn06 or HB-1/3.9 at MOI of 0.01 or 1, and then cultured at 37˚C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . Cell samples and supernatant samples were collected at 0 h post-infection (hpi), 12, 24, and 36 hpi to detect the RNA expressions by real-time PCR and IFN-β protein expression by ELISA, respectively. Dual luciferase reporter assay. After 3D4/21 cells were co-transfected transiently with miRNA mimics and plasmid DNA (pmirGLO-IFN-β 3'UTR orpmirGLO-MRE-wt or pmirGLO-MRE-mut) for 24 h, dual luciferase activity reporter assay was performed using dual-luciferase ® reporter assay system (Promega Corp.) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cell culture medium in culture plates was removed, and washed twice with PBS. To lyse cells fully, passive lysis buffer was added according to its protocol, and treated at room temperature for 20 min. The lysate was transferred into a 96-well plate, and then the plate was placed at luciferase detector GloMAX TM 96 microplate luminometer (Promega Corp.) to detect firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity. The data are shown as the ratio of firefly luciferase activity value to Renilla luciferase activity value for quantitative analysis of luciferase activity. Each experiment was repeated three times.
