Whether a governmental agency provides or assures the provision of services varies from country to country. Canada's health insurance program is operated by the provinces, with federal cost sharing. In Scandinavian countries, the counties, which have many of the characteristics of provinces, operate most local health services. In centrally managed economies, such as former Soviet countries, health services have been operated with a high degree of central control. The international movement towards decentralization of management of services is under critical review, and a mix of centrally managed and decentralized services is likely to be the trend in coming decades. Only government can perform many public health functions because certain services require legislative, taxing, and regulatory powers, or because they are directed at the total population. Central coordination is required for key public health functions such as epidemiology and disease control, monitoring population health, nutrition, sanitation, and food and drug control. In keeping with specific health targets formulated by national or international public or professional bodies, local, state, or national health authorities directly provide certain basic public health services, such as those of specialized laboratories. In the USA, public health agencies provide services not otherwise available to high-risk or otherwise underserved population groups. Many of these developed under special funding by higher levels of government to promote specific programs such as immunization, lead abatement, prenatal care, and HIV testing. They are generally services that are often not adequately covered by health insurance systems or by private practitioners and health care systems. Immunization may be provided as a governmental service, which is the case in Israel, or by private or managed care providers, but the state retains overall responsibility for policy and implementation of an adequate immunization schedule and level, as in the UK and the USA. Even in countries with well-developed primary care systems, there may be a need for additional special services, such as screening Detection and control of infectious disease outbreaks require a concerted effort by frontline and specialty clinicians, local and regional and/or state public health professionals, and national level scientists and regulators. The 2012 outbreak of fungal meningitis in the USA due to contamination of preservative-free methyl prednisolone acetate illustrates several of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Meningitis is an infection of the central nervous system, specifically of the fluid and materials that surround the brain and spinal cord. This system is normally sterile, but injections of medications near or into the spinal column can cause contamination. Agents that can cause meningitis are typically viruses or bacteria, but meningitis due to fungi can occur. In early September 2012, patients began to present to emergency departments and other sites with symptoms consistent with meningitis but without common causal agents. An infectious disease expert at a Tennessee academic medical center identified one of the initial patients and, given the unusual etiological agent, reported the case via email to the State Health Department of Tennessee (TDOH). There, the Director of the Healthcare Associated Infections, among others, began to look for other patients. As noted by the New York Times report on the investigation, while physicians and other clinicians on the frontlines are most likely to detect initial cases, "only health departments and other governmental agencies have the ability and authority to track down additional cases to document disease outbreaks and warn those at risk. It is work that private groups seldom can do". Within 48 hours of the first report, the TDOH notified the US federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the key point was the unusual fungal agent involved. After consultation with the CDC, the TDOH inspected the facility where the index case received treatment, and identified potential causes, such as local contamination due to environmental contamination, mishandling of equipment, or contamination at the compounding source. Similar to case identification and tracking those potentially exposed, inspection of health care facilities requires authority usually reserved only for state and national regulatory agencies. While narrowing the possible causes, the TDOH reached out directly to the out-of-state compounding source, as well as the state health department in that state (Massachusetts, MDOH). The company voluntarily recalled potentially tainted lots of the medications. The US agency that oversees most drug manufacture in the USA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was also informed. Here, the lines of authority and responsibility overlap, and the outbreak reveals potential weaknesses in state and federal regulation. Compounding companies are not routinely regulated by the FDA, as such businesses are technically pharmacies. In the USA, pharmacies are routinely overseen by professional boards, often including volunteer professionals. Clinicians in many other states began to report fungal meningitis cases to their state health departments, and the CDC coordinated formal national surveillance. Finally, within 8 days of the initial email report to the TDOH, the MDOH conducted a detailed inspection of the production facility involved. The company voluntarily recalled all of its products and shut down. A month later, a preliminary report by MDOH noted contamination of floors, floors mats, and a leaking boiler, all near sterile mixing areas. An FDA report found that many of the drug vials contained foreign matter and that the "clean" compounding rooms had either mold or bacterial overgrowth, or both. By 15 November 2012, over 400 cases of fungal infection due to the contaminated drug had been found, with 32 deaths, and over 14,000 potential exposed patients. In reaction to the situation, hearings at the national level were scheduled to discuss the need for regulatory changes. The director of the Massachusetts Board of Pharmacy has been fired, while new cases are still occurring, and recurrence in some of the initial cases is being documented. for cancer of the cervix, hypertension, or congenital disease. Health education, a function of all levels of government and non-government health services, involves those activities centered on raising consciousness and knowledge in the health professions, the public, or vulnerable target groups, cutting across virtually all public health activities. Collaboration may take place with parallel departments of government including education, social welfare, agriculture, urban planning, and voluntary agency groups. Healthy Cities can be an important vehicle for promoting public health-related interests when civic authorities place health on the agenda for urban development in particular. With regard to departments of education, issues of the school health curriculum for education program content, quality of nutrition, and obesity reduction programs are of vital importance. Financial incentives in the form of grants or other categorical funding may be directed to programs to promote specific public health services, research, or education. Financial incentives are used widely in seeking solutions to particular problems, such as incentive payments to physicians for achieving performance indicators or national health targets such as full immunization, or Papanicolaou (Pap) smears and mammography for target population groups in the UK. National goals may be set in a consultative process, taking into account their importance to the health of the nation. They must also address economic and human resource capacity to organize and deliver relevant programs to meet goals stated with the potential impact evaluated. Incentive or categorical funding is often a useful method to introduce a new set of activities, to strengthen a weak area of public health, or to promote a shift in emphasis in the health system.
