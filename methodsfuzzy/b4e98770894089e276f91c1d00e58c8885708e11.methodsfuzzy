A prospective, single center, blinded, clinical feasibility trial was performed at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (a Harvard Medical School teaching tertiary care hospital) from December 2012 to August 2013. The feasibility trial planned an estimated minimum sample size enrollment of 20 negative patients, 10 confirmed viral patients, and 10 confirmed bacterial patients. The study enrolled 60 patients (34 males and 26 females) with an acute febrile respiratory infection. All subjects older than 17 years of age who presented with fever with acute respiratory symptoms consistent with infection, or reported having a body temperature of ]100.58F in the last 48 h, were considered eligible for the study (Supplementary file). At enrollment, the 36 case subjects were separated into two groups: 12 with presumed pharyngitis and 24 with presumed LRTI (Supplementary file). If a patient did not have a fever and was asymptomatic (as described in the inclusion criteria), the patient was considered for inclusion as a control subject (Supplementary file). Twenty-four patients were enrolled into the control group. The study was approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Committee for Clinical Investigations with a written consent. Study personnel collected up to seven samples from all patients including one venous blood sample, four oropharyngeal samples, a urine sample, and a fingerstick blood sample that was applied to a rapid, POC immunoassay, according to the manufacturer's instructions for use. In addition to the preceding tests, subjects suspected of having an LRTI had sputum and blood cultures as well as a chest X-ray. Participation of subjects required one visit with one follow-up visit. The followup visit, 4Á6 weeks after the initial visit, was necessary to collect a venous blood sample for follow-up serology testing. The immunoassay was interpreted by identifying the presence of the control lines or result lines according to Fig. 1 . Two of the oropharyngeal samples were sent for a viral respiratory PCR panel (Luminex xTAG, Austin, TX) and other viral PCR testing, whereas the other two oropharyngeal samples were sent for routine bacterial cell culture. A 5 mL peripheral venous blood sample, collected in a purple top tube (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA]), was sent for quantitative MxA enzymeÁlinked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) testing using the MxA Protein ELISA Test Kit (Kyowa Medex Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and WBC measurement. A second sample, collected in a red top tube, was used for CRP testing with the High Sensitivity CRP Enzyme Immunoassay Test Kit (Biocheck, Inc., Foster City, CA). Diagnosis of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae was determined by PCR and performed by means of paired serology at the time of enrollment and at 4Á6 weeks thereafter. Commercially available ELISA tests (Ani Labsystems Ltd. Oy., Vantaa, Finland) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions for the detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies to M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae. Atypical bacterial infection was confirmed if M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were identified by PCR, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae IgM antibodies were detected, or a twofold increase in IgG antibodies between acute and convalescent phase samples was found. A definitive typical bacterial infection was considered when a bacterium was cultured from blood, sputum, or if the urine antigen assay for Legionella or Streptococcus was found to be positive. All subjects suspected of an LRTI had peripheral venous blood collected and sent for plating on routine bacterial blood cultures. Upon reaching the clinical laboratory, the specimens were divided into samples for plating on blood and chocolate agar. All specimens were processed within 24 h of collection, and a single colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL of a single bacterial species indicated an infection and not colonization. Expectorated sputum was collected from subjects with a productive cough and a presumptive LRTI. Only samples that had more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes and less than 25 squamous cells per microscope high-power field were plated for culture (32) . The quality of sputum samples was evaluated by assessing the number of inflammatory and epithelial cells. A definitive bacterial infection was considered when any Group A beta hemolytic strep growth occurred or any other bacterial growth greater than 1)10 5 CFU/mL occurred in oropharyngeal samples or sputum samples. Urine samples were collected and assayed for Streptococcal pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila antigen. Immunochromatographic membrane tests (Alere BinaxNOW S. pneumoniae and BinaxNOW Legionella, Waltham, MA) were performed on urine samples for detection of S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila antigens. Identification of L. pneumophila by PCR also confirmed the diagnosis of Legionella. Definitive viral infection was confirmed if the oropharyngeal PCR respiratory panel (Luminex xTAG; Austin, TX) or other viral PCR was positive for viral nucleic acid. Subjects who did not have a definitive microbiological confirmation of disease were characterized according to an algorithm incorporating additional radiological and laboratory findings (Fig. 2) . The presence of radiologic evidence of diffuse infiltrates by chest X-ray suggested a viral infection while the presence of radiologic evidence of a focal lobar process or infiltrate by chest X-ray suggested a bacterial infection. In addition, significantly elevated WBC count over 12,000 mm 3 was interpreted to suggest bacterial infection.
