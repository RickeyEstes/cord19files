All data were analyzed using Prism6 software (GraphPad). The half-maximal effective concentrations (EC 50 ) were calculated using the dose-response stimulation model. The IC 50 value for each mAb was calculated using the dose-response inhibition model. For experiments involving AG6 mice, four animals were included in each assessment group to ensure equal representation and consistency of the data obtained. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's unpaired t test. Data were presented as mean Â± SEM. * p < 0.05; * * p < 0.01; and * * * p < 0.001.
