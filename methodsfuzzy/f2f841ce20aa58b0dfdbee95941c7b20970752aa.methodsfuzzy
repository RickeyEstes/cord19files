We have used a well-characterized animal model of COPD to determine the role of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in lung inflammation and associated co-morbidities by genetic ablation of this factor. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was used to isolate cells from the lung and flow cytometry was used to determine cellular populations and activation. Histopathology was performed on lung tissue and airspace size was measured by the mean linear intercept method. Luminex technology was used to determine levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in BAL fluid. Comorbidity assessment was performed by micro-CT analysis of bones, muscle measurements and histopathology of heart. Results: Using CLL patient samples and a mouse model of CLL, we have detected reduced levels of interferon alpha (IFNa) in the serum of patients with CLL or serum samples from a mouse model of CLL. We discovered that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which underpin the activity of effector immune cells critical for anti-viral immunity and anti-tumor responses, are reduced in number and functionally impaired in progressive CLL. This defect correlated with low levels of IFNa, a cytokine critical for immunity. Lower pDC numbers with impaired IFNa production was due to the decreased expression of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (Flt3) and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), respectively. Reduced Flt3 expression was reversed using inhibitors of TGF-b and TNF, an effect correlating with a reduction in tumor load. Conclusion: Defects in pDC numbers and function offer new insight into mechanisms underpinning the profound immunodeficiency affecting CLL patients and provide a potentially novel avenue for restoring immunocompetency in CLL.

Introduction: The ability to generate interferon lambda 4 (IFN-k4), the most recently discovered member of the type-III interferon family, has been associated with impaired clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. IFN-k4 signaling through an IFN-k receptor complex (IFNLR1 and IL10R2) leads to activation of interferonstimulated genes and antiviral effects as a part of the JAK-STAT pathway. However, the possible role of IFN-k4 in carcinogenesis remains unclear. Here, we investigated IFNLR1-dependent and independent functions of IFN-k4 in a hepatoma HepG2 cell line. We used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to eliminate IFNLR1 in our previously established stable hepatoma cell line (IFN-k4-HepG2 cells) where IFN-k4 expression was induced by doxycycline treatment. Successful IFNLR1 knockout cell line (IFN-k4-IFNLR1KO-HepG2) was confirmed by DNA sequencing, Western blotting and the interferon stimulated response element luciferase reporter (ISRE-Luc) assays. The effects of IFN-k4 in IFN-k4-IFNLR1KO-HepG2 and its parental IFN-k4-HepG2 cells were assessed by cell viability, apoptosis, transwell migration and wound healing assays. RNAsequencing was used to investigate the global transcriptome changes in these cell lines and conditions. Results: We successfully generated a stable IFN-k4-IFNLR1KO-HepG2 cell line. Compared to the parental IFN-k4-HepG2 cells, these cells were impaired in the ability to induce ISRE-Luc reporter after treatment with recombinant IFN-k4 or induction of IFN-k4 expression by doxycycline. In addition, the antiproliferative effects of IFN-k4 were eliminated by IFNLR1 depletion, which means these phenotypes are IFNLR1-dependent. However, promotion of cell migration by IFN-k4 was observed in both IFN-k4-HepG2 and IFN-k4-IFNLR1KO-HepG2 cells, suggesting a possibility of an alternative, IFNLR1-independent pathway of IFN-k4 function. Conclusion: In summary, we found that IFN-k4 exhibits antiproliferative effects through IFNLR1-dependent mechanisms, whereas it might promote cell migration through IFNLR1-independent pathways. Further RNA-sequencing is ongoing to investigate the possible IFNLR1-dependent and independent mechanisms of IFN-k4 signaling. These results will contribute to better understanding of IFN-k4 functions that are important for carcinogenesis. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Dept Medico-Surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, Sapienza University of Rome, Latina, Italy; 2 Istituto Superiore di Sanità; 3  The signalling properties of IL-6 were examined in purified CD4 T-cell cultures and through ex vivo analysis of defined CD4 T-cell subsets. Temporal changes in the IL-6 activation of STAT1 and STAT3 were monitored by intracellular flow cytometry and accompanied by a transcriptomic analysis and epigenetic profiling of STAT1 and STAT3 involvement using Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Results: Our data shows that IL-6 control of gene expression in CD4 T-cells is highly dynamic and influenced by the activation status of the CD4 population. Importantly, activation of CD4 T-cells by anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulatory antibodies altered the signaling properties of IL-6 through regulation of protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, which blockade IL-6 control of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1. While IL-6 control of STAT3 was comparable in naïve, central memory, effector and effector memory CD4 T-cells, the activation of STAT1 was a prominent feature of IL-6 signaling in naïve CD4 T-cells. We examined the differential STAT1 and STAT3 binding profiles of naïve and effector memory CD4 + T-cells to identify potential genetic markers of IL-6 driven disease. In naïve CD4 T cells ChIP-seq analysis identified 224 peaks induced by IL-6 for STAT1 and 162 peaks for STAT3 where 29.4% and 43.2% respectively are in the promotor region. Bioinformatic analysis of these datasets using the MEME-ChIP web service mapped the enrichment of defined consensus motifs. Three DNA consensus motifs were associated with STAT1 involvement -corresponding to Interferon-regulatory factors response element, the GAS motif and a third not centrally enriched motif. Conversely, STAT3 ChIP-seq peaks mapped predominantly to the GAS motif, a C2H2 zinc finger factor binding site and a consensus sequence associated with the binding of ETS transcription factors. Thus, indicating potential associations and interactions with other transcriptional complexes. Relative enrichment for STAT1 and STAT3 control genes was reduced in the effector memory samples. Introduction: X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)-associated factor-1 (XAF1) is a cytokine-regulated, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor (TRAF) domain-containing protein that has a poorly defined cellular function [1] . It was originally implicated as a tumor suppressor due to the putative inhibitory effects toward XIAP [2] . Here we report a possible role of XAF1 in the TNFa/TNF receptor (TNFR)-mediated signal transduction. Methods: Activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFjB) by TNFa in XAF1-knockdown ACHN cells was assessed by luciferase assays using an NFjB response element-regulated luciferase reporter construct, or by real-time RT PCR analysis of IL-8 gene expression. The effect of XAF1 on RIP1 or TRAF2-induced NFjB activation and the interaction between XAF1 and TRAF2 or RIP1 were investigated by using luciferase assays and co-immunoprecipitation assays, respectively, in HEK293 cells ectopically expressing the proteins of interest. XAF1's impact on TRAF2 ubiquitination was assessed by immunoblot analysis. The effect of XAF1 on TRAF2/TRADD/RIP1 complex formation was also studied by immunoblot analysis of individual proteins following immunoprecipitation of endogenous TRAF2 in XAF1 knockdown ACHN cells, with or without TNFa stimulation. In vitro studies were conducted to examine the role of ULK1 in IFNk-mediated signaling pathways using LC-MS/MS, coimmunoprecipitation and western blot analyses. IFNk-induced gene transcription was evaluated by qRT-PCR analyses and by measuring luciferase activities of ULK1/2 wild type (WT) and double knockout (DKO) cells stably expressing IFNk activation site (GAS) elements-Luciferase cDNA. IFNk-antiviral responses were determined in antiviral assays using encephalomyocarditis virus as the challenge virus. Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess differences between two groups. One-way ANOVA was used to compare more than two groups followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. Differences were considered statistically significant when p values were less than 0.05. The communities of oral bacteria collected by mouth rinse from healthy controls (HC, n = 15), patients with dry mouth due to medication as sicca controls (SC, n = 10) and SS patients (n = 25) were analyzed by pyrosequencing. Based on the results of microbiota analysis, Streptococcus salivarius, Rothia mucilaginosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, and P. histicola were chosen for further study. Human salivary gland (HSG) cells were infected with the selected bacteria in the presence or absence of IFNg for 7 h. After killing the bacteria with gentamicin, HSG cells were further cultured for 65 h. Expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I), MHC class II (MHC II), CD80, and CD86 was then examined by flow cytometry. Results: Pyrosequencing analysis revealed drastic changes in the bacterial communities associated with the dryness of mouth. Although the bacterial communities of SC and SS were quite similar to each other, the diversities of SS microbiota were significantly higher than those of SC, and differences in the relative abundance of 16 species/phylotypes were observed between the SC and SS groups. In particular, an increase in P. melaninogenica was specifically associated with SS risk by logistic regression analysis (Odd Ratio 5.4, p = 0.003). F. nulceatum, a highly immune stimulatory species used as a positive control, and P. melaninogenica up-regulated MHC I and CD86 in the absence of IFNg and further upregulated the IFNg-induced upregulation of MHC I and CD80. P. melaninogenica also up-regulated the IFNg-induced expression of MHC II. In contrast, S. salivarius, the most abundant species used as a negative control, down-regulated CD80 expression in the absence of IFNg as well as the IFNg-induced upregulation of MHC I. R. mucilaginousa, a species that increased in both SC and SS compared to HC, also showed suppressive effect on the IFNg-induced upregulation of MHC I and CD86. Conclusion: Specific bacteria associated with SS in oral microbiota may play roles in deregulation of SGECs and the pathogenesis of SS. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Type I and II IFNs are concurrently produced during infections. Type II IFN (IFNk) acts on macrophages to induce both pro-inflammatory and anti-microbial responses and is critical for resistance to bacterial infections. Conversely, type I IFNs promote antiviral immunity and exert anti-inflammatory effects associated with increased host susceptibility during Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) and other bacterial infections. Type I IFNs are also known to suppress ifngr1 transcription in myeloid cells to down regulate the receptor for IFNk (IFNGR). We hypothesized this suppression of IFNGR contributes to type I IFN-mediated susceptibility during bacterial infections. Methods: To test our hypothesis, we developed a transgenic mouse model (fGR1) in which a functional flag-tagged IFNGR is expressed in macrophages at low levels using a promoter that is not silenced by type I IFNs. Results: Macrophages from fGR1 mice express both endogenous and flag-IFNGR, but overall surface IFNGR expression is similar to that of WT congenic C57Bl/6 cells. When treated with type I IFNs WT macrophages lose cell surface IFNGR while fGR1 macrophages largely retain flag-IFNGR. fGR1 and WT macrophages respond similarly when treated individually with type I IFN or IFNk but in the presence of type I IFNs responsiveness of fGR1 macrophages to IFNk is greater. Consistent with this, fGR1 mice have heightened resistance to systemic Lm infection. Enhanced resistance of fGR1 mice is dependent on IFNk and correlates with increased expression of pro-inflammatory activation markers and reduced frequency of Lm-infected macrophages. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that IFNGR down regulation in myeloid cells impairs macrophage activation and increases host susceptibility during infection by an intracellular bacterial pathogen. [1] . The IFN-b induction pathway activates specific transcription factor binding to interferon regulatory factor (IRF) DNA elements called IRF-E and stimulate the transcription of several genes [2] . Type I IFNs, including IFN-b, bind IFN-I receptor and trigger the IFN-I signaling cascade which triggers transcription factors that bind to DNA elements named IFN stimulated response elements or ISRE [3] , triggering transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The similarity between IRF-E and ISRE sequences [4, 5] supports the fact that many genes can be activated by both signaling pathways [6, 7] . Several works describe transgenic mice expressing reporter genes under the control of IFN-b [8, 9] , IFN-a6 [10] or Mx2 promoters [6] or create IFN-I specific responsive promoter Mx1 to control the expression of Cre recombinase [11] . Methods: A recombinant adeno associated vector (AAV) containing multiple copies of an optimized regulatory sequence containing IRF-E and ISRE (IRF-ISRE) controlling the expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gen was generated. Intranasal or intravenous administration of the AAV vector into C57BL/6 mice or Syrian hamsters showed a specific response. Two weeks after administration, animals were infected with different doses of viruses such as Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or influenza A/PR8/34 virus and reporter activity was monitored in vivo after intravenous administration of luciferin substrate. Results: In vivo luciferase activity detection was dependent of the presence of the AAV vector after the administration of different IFN-I agonist. The reporter vector can be accommodated to study both the strength and the kinetics of type I IFN signature. Conclusion: With no need of animal transgenesis, we have developed an AAV reporter vector that can be delivered into different organs of different animal models in order to detect and quantify the IFN-I signature in vivo. Introduction: Genotoxic stresses, such as that induced by DNA damage agents or DNA recombination, have the potential to generate DNA by-products detected by the innate immune system. Methods: Relying on the study of non-cytotoxic, mild DNA damage in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, bone marrow derived macrophages, human fibroblasts and lung cancer cells (A549), we investigated the involvement of the cytosolic cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS)-STING in the detection of DNA damage products. Cells deficient in STING, cGAS or gap junctions were utilized to address the direct contribution of the pathway to the protection against Semliki Forest virus infection. An ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence assay format, S-PLEX TM , based on MSD's MULTI-ARRAY Ò technology, was developed for IFN-k and its performance was characterized. Monoclonal antibodies were evaluated and selected based on sensitivity, specificity, affinity, and performance characteristics against a WHO anchored IFN-k calibrator. We have analyzed liver gene expression data utilizing RNA seq and pathological features to further understand disease development and progression. Results: As a consequence, we have found that the mice develop primary autoimmune cholangitis with a strong female bias. Serological/pathological features and the gene expression signature in this mouse model are comparable with data seen in human PBC. RNA-sequencing of liver gene expression revealed that differentially expressed genes in female ARE-Del-/-mice are consistent with stronger Type I and II interferon signaling and T helper cell-mediated immune responses in female mice that serves as the basis of the sex bias observed in this disease. Female ARE-Del-/-mice have significantly increased CD4 T cells but decreased CD8 T cells compared to control littermates, resulting in an elevated CD4/CD8 T cell ratio. Consequently, transfer of CD4+ T cells from ARE-Del-/mice to B6/Rag1 -/mice induced moderate portal and parenchymal inflammation, whereas CD8+ T cell transfer did not induce any pathological phenotypes. Moreover, profiles of autoantigen reactivities using peptide arrays indicated that female ARE-Del-/-mice had a high induction of IgM reactive autoantigens associated with autoimmune diseases as compared to male mice, while the levels of IgG reactive autoantigens were not significantly different in females vs. males. To further assess the role of Type 1 interferon in the disease process ARE-DEL/IFNa/b receptor double knockout mice were generated. Despite the inability to measure any circulating Type 1 IFN, these mice had much lower female-prevalent pathological phenotypes such as portal and lobular duct inflammation, granuloma formation, bile duct damage, and induction of total bile acids. We have addressed this question using the doublestranded DNA pathogen Herpes Simplex virus (HSV) in an in vivo model of cutaneous infection. By applying this model to mice deficient in different pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) pathway molecules (e.g., TRIF, MyD88, Sting, MAVS, etc.), we have begun to disentangle the role different PRR signalling pathways play in driving HSV-specific CD8 + T cell priming. Results: Efficient HSV-1-specific CD8 + T cell priming relied heavily on the provision of type I interferon (IFN). Unexpectedly, we found that prominent DNA sensing pathways leading to type I IFN production, such as those depending on MyD88, STING, and/or Caspase-1/11 played redundant roles in HSV-specific CD8 + T cell priming. However, pathways detecting RNA intermediates, such as the TLR3-TRIF axis as well as molecules signalling via MAVS, were essential for this process. Moreover, we have elucidated the subtypes of type I IFN induced, the transcription factors that were required and the effects those factors have on IFN-stimulated genes, such as IL-15. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that DC utilize several different mechanisms to translate the complex sensing of pathogens into effective adaptive immune responses and that the detection of RNA intermediates in HSV infection is key for the efficient priming of CD8 + T cells. Introduction: Two polarized states of macrophage functional activity, known as M1 and M2, have been identified in different temporal stages of inflammatory response. We have previously reported that cellular stress responses can dramatically enhance TLR4-induced inflammatory cytokine production in cultured bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) by increasing the magnitude and duration of gene transcription. Methods: Real time PCR was used to measure cytokine expression levels. Flow cytometry was performed to identify the cell populations. Results: Using GM-CSF or M-CSF cultured BMDMs to induce M1 or M2 like macrophages, resepectively, we now report that sensitivity for stress-induced enhancement of TLR4-mediated cytokine expression varies with the state of macrophage polarization. While M2-like M-CSF cultured BMDMs exhibit lower cytokine production that can be markedly increased by coincident cell stress, GM-CSF treated M1like cell populations exhibit strong cytokine production with very limited stress sensitivity. Resident tissue macrophages in the liver exhibit M2-like low cytokine expression while monocytes infiltrating the liver following acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver injury show an M1 phenotype that transitions from M1 to M2 phenotype over 48-72 h. Exposure to cell stress (by ip injection of Tunicamycin) dramatically elevates LPS-induced cytokine production in resident liver macrophages and restores M1 phenotype to infiltrating cells that have transitioned to M2 status at late times following injury. Introduction: West Nile virus (WNV) infection in humans leads to a range of disease outcomes, varying from no clinical signs of disease through severe meningitis, encephalitis, and death. The inbred mouse models used for most WNV disease studies fail to capture the breadth of human disease outcomes, limiting the conclusions which can be made in terms of the genetic and transcriptomic underpinnings of viral susceptibility and disease progression. The Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse model has been developed as a recombinant inbred population which encompasses >90% of the diversity within the mouse genome. The CC mouse model effectively presents the full spectrum of disease associated with human WNV infection. Here, we apply the CC model toward understanding the transcriptional response to WNV over a range of disease outcomes to reveal the immune and inflammatory responses to WNV infection. Methods: Total RNA from the brain and spleen of three CC lines each which are asymptomatic or symptomatic following WNV infection were analyzed by genome-wide microarray at multiple samples post-infection. The signatures of differential gene expression linked with genotype differences to reveal genes whose expression correlated with particular infection outcome phenotypes such as weight loss, viral neuroinvasion, and clinical score. Results: We identified sets of genes which track with susceptibility to WNV infection, including a number of genes within known innate signaling pathways, along with potentially novel immune molecules. To determine whether the genes which track with susceptibility to WNV infection in the CC mouse model are relevant to human disease development, we compared the differential gene signatures found in the CC mice to RNA-sequencing samples of a brain autopsy sample from a human patient who had died of WNV infection. We identified viral sequence reads with in the infected human brain, albeit differentially among brain regions. The human WNV brain exhibited an innate immune signature consistent with CNS immune activation, linking this response to aspects to the CC CNS infection/response profile. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the utility of the CC model for understanding complex WNV disease outcomes and the host response, including tissue-specific response, to infection. Introduction: Viral infection triggers a fast and effective cellular response mediated primarily by the production of INFb that induce an anti-viral state through complex signal cascades. Therefore, the regulation of its induction and subsequent IFNb signaling needs to be tightly controlled. There is growing evidence implicating the members of Tripartitemotif (TRIM) protein family of E3 ligases as critical players in this regulation. However, the exact role, mechanism of action, and the physiological relevance of their activity in vivo still remain poorly investigated. Previous work in our lab revealed that an unprecedented large number of TRIMs play critical roles as enhancers in the regulation of innate immune signaling pathways. To study the role of TRIM65 in innate immune signaling we have used luciferase assays, overexpression in A549 and 293T cells, transient knock down using siRNAs in 293T cells, Western blots, RT-qPCR, PR8-GLuc antiviral assays. Results: Our recent studies focused on TRIM65 have revealed that its overexpression strongly increased the 2CARD-RIG-I-dependent activation of the INFb and ISRE promoters. Consequently, IFNb, ISG54, Mx1, IL-6 as well as OAS1 mRNA levels are decreased in TRIM65 knock down cells upon infection compared to infected/ treated control cells. These data suggest a stimulatory role for TRIM65 in innate immune signaling. Besides, TRIM65 showed antiviral activity comparable to TRIM25 in a PR8-GLuc antiviral assay. Conclusion: Since the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of many TRIMs has been linked to their antiviral functions, our future studies are aimed to identify TRIM65 interacting factors as potential substrates and delineate the molecular mechanism by which TRIM65-mediated ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifications could regulate the response to viral infection. A better understanding of positive regulatory networks of the IFN response will provide new knowledge that will help to design more effective therapeutics. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Induction of cell-intrinsic antiviral defense via type 1 interferon (IFN-I) requires recognition of viral signatures of infection. Cellular recognition of extracellular or cytosolic nucleic acid is considered the primary means of virus detection. However, avoiding recognition of self nucleic acids is also important to prevent autoimmunity. The threshold of this response can be modulated by disruptions to homeostasis, such as membrane perturbation, suggestive of a viral infection. All enveloped viruses must fuse with the cell membrane during entry, and there is evidence to suggest that membrane fusion is sensed by the cell and impacts antiviral gene induction. Methods: To examine the response to enveloped virus entry in the absence of replication we used ultraviolet (UV) light inactivated virus or the fusion associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein p14 resuspended in lipid vesicles. We examined the role of calcium and nucleic acid signalling pathways upstream of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) induction using a combination of fluorescence microscopy, chemical inhibitors, and genetic knockouts. Results: We found that both calcium signalling and nucleic recognition pathways were required for a full antiviral response to enveloped virus. Inhibition of calcium signalling reduced the antiviral response to UV-inactivated virus infection and prevented complete activation of the STING-IRF3 signalling complex. Lipid vesicles containing p14 FAST protein, but not a fusion-defective mutant, were sufficient to induce an antiviral response on their own despite lacking any nucleic acid. p14-lipid vesicles appear to induce IFN-I through a pathway involving calcium, MAVS, and IRF3. To enable accurate measurements of GM-CSF, MSD developed an ultrasensitive S-PLEX TM immunoassay and evaluated its performance with clinical samples. Anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibodies were screened and selected based on their sensitivity, specificity, and affinity for GM-CSF secreted by a differentiated THP-1 cell line. Development and characterization of the S-PLEX immunoassay was performed using a recombinant GM-CSF expressed in E. coli and anchored to the GM-CSF WHO International Standard (NIBSC code: 88/646). Normal sera and plasma specimens and several cell models were screened to assess performance of the ultrasensitive assay. Results: The S-PLEX GM-CSF assay provides a limit of detection (LOD) of <1.0 fg/mL with a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude. The lower and upper limits of quantitation are 2.5 fg/mL and 8000 fg/mL, respectively. The intra-plate coefficients of variation (CVs) for Quality Control (QC) samples spanning the assay range were 4-16% and the inter-plate CVs were 7-14% (16 replicates on 4 plates). Assay accuracy was assessed in a spike recovery experiment; the average spike recovery of GM-CSF was 96% (n = 9 specimens). The dilution linearity average recovery was 92% (n = 9 specimens). Analyte specificity was demonstrated by depleting eight specimens (sera and plasma) with commercial anti-GM-CSF antibodies not included in the S-PLEX assay. Depletion results showed that the assay measures the true analyte, rather than some other non-specific interaction. GM-CSF was detectable in 100% of apparently healthy specimens (n = 42) with a median value of 51 fg/mL in serum (n = 28) and 27 fg/ mL in EDTA plasma (n = 14). GM-CSF did not appear to be elevated in a small set of autoimmune specimens or sepsis specimens tested. Further validation of assay specificity was performed by measuring changes in GM-CSF secretion in several cell models, pre-and postdifferentiation. An undifferentiated monocytic cell line, THP-1, was shown to secrete GM-CSF only after differentiation into a mature macrophage. Also, as expected, GM-CSF secretion in a HaCaT cell line decreased substantially after differentiation into mature keratinocytes. Conclusion: MSD developed an ultrasensitive GM-CSF immunoassay with a <1.0 fg/mL limit of detection, improving on current ELISAs by approximately 1000 fold. This will improve current measurements and understanding of GM-CSF in the immune/inflammation cascade. Div. Immunol. Dept. Biomol. Sci., Saga Univ. Faculty Med., Saga, Japan; 2 Div. Immunol., Dept. Mol. Microbiol. Immunol., Nagasaki Univ. Grad. School Biomed. Sci., Nagasaki, Japan; 3 Immunology, Kagoshima Univ. Grad School Med. Dent. Sci., Kagoshima, Japan Introduction: IL-27 is a heterodimeric cytokine of IL-12 family consisted of p28 and EBI3, and is reportedly produced by innate immune cells of myeloid origin, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, in response to TLR stimulation. It is well known that, during maralia infection, various types of immune suppression occur. Methods: Mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) and T cells (PbA-specifically activated) were examined for their regulatory functions, cytokine production, and surface markers. Purified collagenous or cysteine-rich domains of SRA-I were produced for in vitro binding assays. To monitor trafficking of extracellular RNA and DNA following uptake, we employed both confocal microscopy and differential centrifugation. Finally, to identify proteins that interact with the cytosolic tail of SRA-I, we employed the bio-ID technique. Here, a biotin ligase is fused to the cytosolic tail of SRA-I, leading to biotinylation of proteins that come into close contact. Biotinylated proteins are precipitated using streptavidin and identified by mass spectrometry. Results: We found that the purified collagenous domain, but not the cysteine-rich domain, binds DNA and RNA will equal efficiency in a length and sequence independent fashion. Similarly, SRA-containing fibroblasts bind and internalize extracellular DNA and RNA with similar efficiency and kinetics. However, extracellular DNA fails to elicit type I interferon production, despite the presence of competent cytosolic DNA sensing pathways, as determined by DNA transfection. These results suggest that either internalized DNA and RNA are differentially trafficked upon binding and uptake or that cross-talk between endosomal and cytosolic sensing pathways differ between DNA and RNA. Current experiments are underway to investigate these possibilities. Conclusion: Understanding how cells recognize and respond to circulating foreign and self nucleic acids is critical to develop clinical tools to fight infectious and autoimmune diseases. Here we find that despite SRAs binding DNA or RNA indiscriminantly, the subsequent cellular outcome is very different. Little is understood how extracellular nucleic acid is trafficked within the cell upon its uptake. Thus, these studies will shed important light on the differential trafficking or signaling of extracellular DNA and RNA in fibroblasts, important sentinel cells of the innate immune system, given their expression of all SRA family members and robust induction of type I interferon in response to both pathogen and danger associated molecular patterns. Introduction: Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) detect pathogen molecules to mount immune responses required for microbial resistance. However, their inappropriate activation can also contribute to inflammation-driven diseases such as atherosclerosis and inflammatory arthritis. Here we uncover the mechanism by which a range of TLRs trigger non-canonical NF-kB to initiate inflammatory responses against pathogen molecules. We also explore how this same mechanism might also promote auto-inflammatory disease that results from the mutation of the IAP family member, XIAP. We have utilized high throughput methods, including microarray and phospho-proteomics, to define IL-23 regulated networks in in vitro differentiated mouse Th17 cells both at the RNA and protein levels. We have also employed quantitative PCR and Western blotting to test the expression of selected targets in wild type and IL-23 receptor-deficient Th17 cells in vitro. Using flow cytometry-assisted cell sorting we have finally characterised the expression of these genes in the steady state and inflamed gut using a T cell transfer model of murine colitis. Results: Integrated omics approach employed in this study has shown a global impact of IL-23 signalling on gene expression and protein phosphorylation in in vitro differentiated mouse Th17 cells. The analysis of this data revealed novel genes and proteins regulated by IL-23 signalling and previously uncharacterised in this context. We have further confirmed IL-23-driven expression of the selected top hits at RNA and protein levels using low throughput methods. Furthermore, we isolated distinct cell populations from the steady state murine colons and confirmed the expression of the selected IL-23 targets in CD4 T cells. Some of the validated hits (e.g. TIMP1, FOSL2, LTB4R1, IL-17F) have been previously linked to pathogenic Th17 cells and shown to be involved in inflammatory bowel disease. To mimic the human condition we induced colitis in mice via an adoptive transfer of a mixture of wild type and IL-23receptor-GFP reporter CD4 T cells and have shown the enriched expression of the short-listed IL-23 gene targets in IL-23R + CD4 T cells isolated from murine spleens, mesenteric lymph nodes and inflamed colons. We performed Proliferation assay, Chemotaxis assay and Western blotting. Results: S100A8 induces morphological change such as production of vacuoles, indicating that it induced the differentiation of EoL-1 cells. S100A8 induced the migration of EoL-1 cells and the migration was inhibited by rottlerin, an inhibitor of protein kinase C delta (PKCä), PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK and SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK. S100A8 induced phosphorylation PKCä, ERK and p38 MAPK in a time-dependent manner. Conclusion: S100A8 induces the differentiation of EoL-1 cells. The chemotaxis mechanism due to S100A8 is involved in PKCä, ERK and p38 MAPK pathway. This finding contributes to an understanding of S100A8 in eosinophil biology and to the development of novel therapies for the treatment allergy. Introduction: Allergic asthma is characterized by bronchoconstriction, allergen-specific IgE and bronchial inflammation. S100A8 is an important protein in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. In this study, we examined that the pathogenic mechanism of asthma is associated with interaction of cytokine release in bronchial epithelial cells with constitutive apoptosis of neutrophils. We developed an experimental model of asthma to investigate this synergy. Neonatal BALB/c mice were inoculated with low dose pneumonia virus of mouse (PVM; 1 pfu) then exposed to low dose (1 lg) cockroach antigen or vehicle control at 3 days post infection (dpi). Some mice were re-infected 6 weeks later and exposed to weekly doses of allergen. Results: Virus and allergen co-exposure was critical in both early and later life for disease onset and progression, including airway hyperreactivity, airway remodelling and type 2 inflammation. Allergen exposure during primary vLRI increased IL-33 release and impaired antiviral cytokine production, leading to increased epithelial viral burden, Th2-type inflammation and airway smooth muscle growth. Neutralisation of IL-33 in early life prevented type 2 inflammation, airway remodelling and reversed the dampened interferon response mediated by cockroach antigen. Substitution of allergen with exogenous IL-33 attenuated antiviral cytokines, elevated viral load and promoted airway remodelling. Mechanistically, we found that IL-33 degraded IRAK1 to dampen type I IFN production by plasmacytoid DC. Conclusion: In summary, we identify a novel role for IL-33 in regulating antiviral immunity and as a target to attenuate the synergistic interplay between two important environmental insults in the onset and progression of asthma. Disclosure of Interest: None declared.  We activated or inhibited proteases in cells and analysed resulting fragments of the IL-11R as well as IL-11R cell surface expression. Furthermore, we used chimeric receptors of the IL-11R and IL-6R as well as receptor mutants to determine which structural traits are responsible for proteolysis. The biological activity of the soluble IL-11R (sIL-11R) was evaluated with the help of cytokinedependent Ba/F3-gp130 cells. Additionally, we investigated whether sIL-11R is present in human blood. Results: We found that the IL-11R is subject to proteolysis and could detect sIL-11R in serum of healthy humans in concentrations around 400 pg/ml. Interestingly, the metalloprotease ADAM10, but not its close relative ADAM17, is able to release the soluble IL-11R ectodomain. We found that a small part of the stalk region is responsible for protease specificity. Furthermore, we show that a single amino acid mutation within the stalk is sufficient to generate an ADAM10-resistant IL-11R variant. Additionally, after ectodomain shedding, the IL-11R membrane stub is further processed by the intramembrane protease gamma-secretase. The released sIL-11R is able to bind IL-11 and the resulting IL-11/sIL-11R complex can activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway via gp130 in cells that do not express the membrane-bound IL-11R. This trans-signalling pathway can be inhibited by the anti-inflammatory designer protein sgp130Fc. Conclusion: Proteases regulate IL-11 signalling via the cell surface expression of the IL-11R and the generation of biologically active sIL-11R. The newly identified IL-11 trans-signalling pathway widens the number of cells that can be activated by IL-11. Sgp130Fc, which has previously been shown to inhibit IL-6 trans-signalling, also inhibits IL-11 trans-signalling, which opens the possibility that the beneficial effects of sgp130Fc in vivo could at least in part be due to blockade of IL-11 trans-signalling.

We have constructed Brd4 conditional knockout mice and investigated the role of BRD4 in cytokine-stimulated macrophages and inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Results: RNA-seq data indicate that BRD4 regulates a highly selective set of cytokines, chemokines and inflammatory genes in macrophages and T cells, in addition to self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cell. ChIP-seq data showing global distribution of BRD4 in enhancers and super-enhancers, highlighting its role in shaping the chromatin landscape in macrophages. Conclusion: Our data support the view that BRD4 affects epigenetic states of chromatin, and is a potentially promising target of chronic diseases. Introduction: Immunotherapy has considerable potential to improve disease outcome and survival of patients with cancer, as highlighted by recent approvals of checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of melanoma, lung and renal cancer. Immune cells, such as T cells, can target and kill tumour cells. However, tumours have a number of mechanisms for evading or suppressing immune responses, such as secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, recruitment of suppressive cell types and expression of immune checkpoint ligands, and these are obstacles to the development of successful cancer immunotherapies. The aim of this study was to characterise immunosuppressive mechanisms elicited by tumour cells and to utilize this information to develop a cancer vaccine combination that blocks suppressive and enhances effector anti-tumour immune responses. We delineated CCL3-expressing cells in bone marrow of normal healthy mice and CML mice, by a flow cytometric analysis. We generated bone marrow chimeras by injecting hematopoietic progenitor cells (ten million) intravenously or into the right bone marrow cavity (200,000 cells). HSPCs were obtained from bone marrow of WT or MCPT8-diphteria toxin receptor (DTR) mice and were transuduced BCR-ABL gene by using a rectrovirus vector system. The resultant LICs (total 30,000 cells) were injected into the tibial bone. In some experiments, DT or mutant DT was administered to LIC-injected mice. Results: Basophils in normal healthy mice can constitutively expressed CCL3 as revealed by a flow cytometric analysis. Moreover, CCL3 negatively acted on HSPCs expressing either CCR1 or CCR5, its receptors, and regulated the normal hematopoietic process, especially hematopoietic reconstitution after bone marrow transplantation. Moreover, CCL3-expressing basophil-like leukemia cells were found to accumulate in CML bone marrow. MCPT8-DTR mousederived LICs induced CML development when injected into the tibia bone marrow. However, the same LICs failed to cause CML when basophils were depleted by the treatment of DT. Moreover, CML development was prevented by maraviroc, a selectively inhibitor for CCR5, a specific receptor for CCL3, when maraviroc administration started immediately after LIC injection into bone marrow. Conclusion: Intra-bone marrow basophil expansion observed in CML, can favor leukemia-tropic hematopoiesis in CML by providing CCL3, a potent inhibitor of normal hematopoiesis and therefore, that basophil-derived CCL3 may be a novel target molecule for the treatment of CML. Introduction: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling is a key component of inflammatory responses. The complex recruits two molecules of the signal transducing subunit glycoprotein130 (gp130), which is ubiquitously expressed whereas IL-6R expression is restricted to hepatocytes and some leukocyte populations. Besides the membrane-bound form a soluble form of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) is found, which binds IL-6 with the same affinity. This trans-signaling mechanism greatly expands the target cell spectrum of IL-6. It has been shown that this mechanism mediates most of the proinflammatory actions of IL-6 and is also involved in the recruitment of mononuclear cells during acute inflammation. We aimed to find the protease contributing to circulating sIL-6R in the blood and analyzed whether the sIL-6R is generated at the site of inflammation by proteolytic cleavage from infiltrating leukocytes. We analyzed the proteolytic processing of the IL-6R on leukocytes in a mouse model of acute inflammation. In the air pouch model of acute inflammation we measured cellular migration of inflammatory cells and released cytokines in a defined microenvironment. To investigate the responsible protease for IL-6R cleavage in vivo we analyzed different protease knock-out mouse strains for sIL-6R levels in the serum and inside the air pouch. Results: We could demonstrate that the sIL-6R is cleaved by ADAM17 from bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro as well as during systemic inflammation in vivo. In line with this, hypomorphic ADAM17 (ADAM17 ex/ex ) mice show significantly (ttest p < 0.0001) less sIL-6R in the pouch lavage during acute inflammation compared to wildtype mice, although steady state sIL-6R levels in the blood are unchanged. However, these mice still exhibit normal cell migration into the air pouch cavity in contrast to IL-6R deficient mice. The sIL-6R, which orchestrates the cellular influx, rather reaches the site of inflammation from the circulation, since we found substantial amounts of serum proteins within the pouch lavage. We assessed the efficacy and determined the mechanism of action of combining Smac mimetics with immune checkpoint inhibitors in orthotopic, syngeneic mouse models of glioblastoma. Results: Smac mimetics synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors to produce durable cures in mouse models of aggressive cranial glioblastoma in which single agent therapy is ineffective. In longterm survivors, tumor growth was not observed upon tumor rechallenge, suggesting that tumor-specific immune memory responses were generated. The combination of Smac mimetics and inhibitory checkpoint blockade increased activated CD8 + T-cells and decreased suppressive immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, the complementation of activities between these classes of therapeutics is dependent on cytotoxic CD8 + T-cell activity. Conclusion: IAP antagonists incorporate both innate and adaptive immunity to kill tumor cells suggesting that this approach to combination immunotherapy will be highly effective in the treatment of cancer.

Introduction: Both inflammation and genetic mutations have been tied to tumor initiation but the interaction of both for promoting tumorigenesis was less investigated and the underlying mechanism was largely unknown. How inflammatory signals affect mutant p53 in a mouse model that mimics the mutations seen in a Li-Fraumeni mouse model (mutations at amino acid 172 of p53 corresponding to the human p53 hot spot mutation at amino acid 175) has not been investigated. Additionally, while IL27 possesses both the pro and anti-inflammatory properties in vivo in a context-dependent manner, how endogenous levels of IL-27 affect spontaneous tumor development or survival in these mice remains largely unknown. In this presentation, the interaction of IL27 deficiency and p53 mutation for causing sarcoma in the bone will be discussed. Methods: Genetic models (p53 mutaion plus IL27 receptor deficiency) will be used to investigate the ineraction between p53 defect and IL27 signaling deficiency for causing tumor initiation in bones; Ras mutated mice fed with IL27 signaling will be used to study skin tumorigenesis. The current and conventional molecular and pathological analysis will be used to investigate tumor initiation. Results: In the current study, we found that lack of IL-27 signaling significantly shortened the survival of mice with tumors expressing both copies of the mutant p53 gene (Li-Fraumeni mouse model). Interestingly, in mice that were heterozygous for mutant p53, lack of IL-27 signaling not only significantly shortened survival but also doubled the incidence of osteosarcomas. These results suggest that IL-27 signaling modulates the oncogenic properties of mutant p53 in vivo and that lack of IL-27 signaling is closely associated with early mutant p53 stability in vivo. Interestingly, IL27 signaling may play an opposite role in skin tumorigenesis and tumorigenic stem cell proliferation as shown in a Ras mutation model. This descripency may be due to induction of inflmmatory cells via an opposite molecular mechanism in different tissues. The following antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology: JAK1, JAK2, STAT3, pSTAT3, STAT5, and pSTAT5. Ruxolitinib was purchased from LC Laboratories. shRNA targeting JAK1, JAK2 and STAT3 were cloned into a doxycyclineinducible PRSMX-puro-GFP vector. Retroviruses containing the shRNA were produced by co-transfection of 293T cells with helper plasmids expressing gag-pol genes, an ecotropic pseudotyping env gene and a retroviral vector using Fugene6 (Promega). RNA-seq was performed on RNA samples extracted from T-cell leukemia/lymphoma lines. Mutations were confirmed by Sanger Sequencing. For NanoString analyses RNA from T-cell tumors were extracted with RNeasy FFPE mini kit (Qiagen). 200 ng of total RNA were used for analysis of human immunoglobulin gene expression following the protocol of NanoString technology. Fold increases were calculated comparing to gene expression of normal purified T cells. Results: Activating mutations of STAT3 and STAT5 were defined in some but not all cases of constitutive activation of the signaling pathway. The defined JAK kinase inhibitor, ruxolitinib had a major inhibitory impact on leukemic T-cell line proliferation and expression of nuclear phospho-STAT3 and 5. Cell lines that manifested pSTAT3/ pSTAT5 were addicted to these STATs whether or not STAT elements were mutated. With the exception of leukemias with chromosomal translocations, activating STAT mutations were not sufficient to initiate leukemic cell proliferation but rather only augmented signals from the above cytokine-cytokine receptor pathway. Therefore, we searched for JAK mutations. JAK mutations were identified that synergized with constitutive phosphorylation or mutations of STATs. Using shRNA loss-of-function analysis with pSTAT malignant T-cell lines, both JAKs and STATs were required for proliferation and survival of T-cell lines whether or not JAK or STAT elements were mutated. Examining JAK mutations a cytokine receptor was required as a JAK activation scaffold and as a STAT docking site. Therefore, constitutive activation required the full pathway including cytokine-cytokine receptor and JAK/STAT elements. In addition to JAK/STAT mutations, there were abnormalities that indirectly augmented cc cytokine expression or JAK/STAT signaling. We have utilised mice lacking one of the type I IFN receptors, Ifnar1 or Ifnar2, as well as the HKx31 (H3N2) IAV mouse model of infection. We have generated a mammalian expression construct for human IFN-k4 with an N-terminal FLAG tag which resulted in the production of functional IFN-k4 protein when expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. We used this mammalian cell-produced IFN-k4 protein to assess its receptor binding and biological activities. Introduction: Interferon lambdas (IFNLs) are potent antiviral cytokines that are widely implicated in many chronic inflammatory diseases [1] . While IFNLs are best known for their role in clearance of hepatitis C virus infection, there is substantial data supporting their role in acute viral infections such as influenza and viral gastroenteritis, as well as chronic autoimmune and liver disease [2, 3] . Numerous tissues have reported IFNL expression, but there remains controversy over which blood cell subsets are responsive to IFNL and thus contribute to inflammatory activity in chronic diseases. We investigated the induction of type I IFNs (IFN-I) upon TLR7 stimulation on isolated pDCs using qRT-PCR and intracellular cytokine staining. IFNa/b receptor (IFNAR) 1 and 2 surface expression was determined using flow cytometry. Results: Our data revealed a sex-specific differential expression of IFN-I, with pDCs from females showing a significantly higher mRNA expression of all 13 IFNa-subtypes (P = 0.002). In addition, pDCs from females had higher levels of IFNb mRNA (P = 0.01) after stimulation, indicating that the sex differences seen in IFN-I production by pDCs were mediated by a signaling event upstream of the first loop of IFN-I mRNA transcription. Furthermore, the surface expression levels of the common IFNAR subunit 2 were significantly higher on pDCs from females in comparison to males. Conclusion: These data indicate that higher IFNa production is already established at the mRNA level and propose a contribution of higher IFNAR2 expression on pDCs to the immunological differences seen between females and males. Introduction: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses continue to cause human infection with a reported mortality rate greater than 50%. However, the mechanism of enhanced disease severity following H5N1 virus infection is not fully understood. We used mass spectrometry to analyze STAT2 immunoprecipitated from 293T cells expressing the flag-tagged wild-type protein. After discovering STAT2 T387 phosphorylation, we mutated T387 to alanine to prevent its phosphorylation and then expressed either FLAG-tagged wild-type or T387A STAT2 in STAT2-deficient U6A cells and immortalized human mammary epithelial (HME) cells, followed by analysis of the IFN-b-induced expression of some typical ISGs by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Illumina Gene Expression Array. Besides ISG induction, we also tested the ability of IFN-b to inhibit virus replication and cell growth in these cells. To investigate the mechanism of T387 phosphorylation, we raised an antibody against T387 phosphorylated STAT2 and performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to test the DNA binding ability, and immunoprecipitation for ISGF3 integrity. The interaction of key partners in the RLR pathway was examined by Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) and Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) Microscopy [3, 4] . This technique allowed us to isolate, visualize and analyze proteinprotein interactions in living cells. Results: Dimers of RIG-I, TRIM25 and MAVS localize into different compartments in the cytoplasm of the cell. RIG-I/TRIM25 complexes accumulate in specific cytoplasmic dots whereas RIG-I/MAVS complexes are located similar to MAVS on the mitochondria. In addition, MAVS competes with TRIM25 for RIG-I binding, and this suggest that upon TRIM25 mediated activation of RIG-I, RIG-I moves away from TRIM25 to interact with MAVS at the mitochondria. For the first time, the distribution of the proteins was also analyzed in virus infected cells. We will show how different viral proteins modify specific complexes in the pathway. Here, we argued that other potential viral targets of MxB would have a nuclear targeting process similar to HIV-1. Thus, we selected the large DNA virus herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) as promising candidate to be subjected to MxB susceptibility tests. First, we selected T98G cells as a cell culture model due to their high endogenous MxB expression and permissiveness to HSV-1 infection. Then, we tested MxB in absence of other interferon-induced genes by generating A549 cells stably overexpressing MxB (A549-MxB). In order to study HSV-1 replication as a function of MxB levels in the cells, we employed siRNAs targeting endogenous and/or exogenous MxB. Results: We observed that the inhibition of HSV-1 replication in T98G cells after IFN treatment was reduced in presence of siRNAs targeting MxB, underlining the importance of MxB in the IFNmediated suppression of HSV-1. Furthermore, our results indicate that HSV-1 replication is strongly inhibited in A549-MxB cells as compared to control cells. In line with this, HSV-1 replication in A549-MxB cells recovered to a large extent after siRNA-mediated knock-down of MxB transgene expression. On the other hand, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), an RNA virus that is not dependent on nuclear entry to accomplish replication, was unaffected by the presence of MxB or MxB-directed siRNAs. Conclusion: In summary, we established that MxB is a specific and effective HSV-1 restriction factor. Future experiments will help to elucidate the mechanisms that are responsible for the antiherpesviral functions of MxB. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), predominantly expressed in host immunocompetent cells, play a critical role in the early innate immune response to invading pathogens by sensing microorganisms. Although TLR2 is essential for the recognition of gram-positive bacteria, its function in infectious diseases is still debated. Rhodococcus aurantiacus is an intracellular gram-positive bacterium that induces granulomatous inflammation, resembling sarcoidosis, in wild-type (WT) mice. In the present study, we investigated the extent to which TLR2 contributes to the host innate response to this bacterium infection and to late granuloma formation using TLR2deficient mice. Methods: After intravenous inoculation of 1 Â 10 8 CFUs of viable R. aurantiacus in PBS, the survival of WT and TLR2-deficient mice (7-8 week old females) was monitored and bacteria in their organs were enumerated; PBS alone was injected as a control. Local and systemic cytokine production and morphological changes in liver were assessed by ELISAs and H&E staining, respectively. Following stimulation with heat-killed R. aurantiacus (MOI of 2), the protein concentrations and gene expression levels of cytokines in mouse peritoneal macrophages were measured by ELISAs and real-time PCR, respectively. Results: TLR2-deficient mice were hypersusceptible to R. aurantiacus infection and displayed high mortality rates compared to their WT counterparts. These mice also showed decreased production of proand anti-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-a, IFN-k, IL-6, and IL-10 in the liver during the early phase of infection, and a high bacterial load in the organs. Moreover, histological studies revealed a reduction in the number and size of hepatic granulomas at day 14 post-infection in TLR2-deficient mice. Upon stimulation with heatkilled bacteria, macrophages from TLR2-deficient mice showed lower expression of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-10 at both the gene and protein level compared to that of WT mouse macrophages. Conclusion: TLR2 deficiency attenuates not only the inflammatory cytokine response but also the anti-inflammatory cytokine response to R. aurantiacus infection. Decreased production of pro-inflamma-tory cytokines contributes to a reduction in bacterial elimination from organs in the early phase of infection and inhibition of hepatic granuloma formation during the late phase. However, the decreased level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 exacerbates mouse survival, as we previously showed that IL-10 is a key element in protecting mice from mortality. These findings thus indicate the essential role of TLR2 in regulating the activation and function of immunocompetent cells, especially macrophages, during the initial phase of systemic R. aurantiacus infection.

Introduction: Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) is a Janus kinase with a pivotal role in immunity to infections, tumour surveillance and cytokine signalling, most prominently type I interferons (IFN) and interleukin 12 (IL-12). Previously it was shown that TYK2-deficient (Tyk2 -/-) mice are highly susceptible to Listeria monocytogenes infection due to impaired IFNk production by T cells. The role of other cell types and the molecular mechanisms responsible for the decreased survival in the absence of TYK2, however, are ill-defined. Methods: To investigate kinase-independent and cell type-specific functions of TYK2 we challenged kinase-inactive mutant TYK2 (Tyk2 K923E ) and conditional TYK2 knockout mice (Tyk2 fl/fl ) intraperitoneally with L. monocytogenes. Survival rates and bacterial burden in spleen and liver were determined. Furthermore, IFNk serum levels were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, splenocytes of mice lacking TYK2 in the NK cell compartment (Tyk2 ÄNcr1 ) and of Tyk2 fl/fl were tested for intracellular expression of IFNk by flow cytometry. Results: In contrast to Tyk2 -/mice, infected Tyk2 K923E mice produce IFNk, although significantly delayed compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Nevertheless, upon high dose of infection Tyk2 K923E mice exhibit a similar survival as Tyk2 -/mice. Surprisingly, upon challenge with a low dose of L. monocytogenes Tyk2 K923E mice display higher bacterial burden than WT mice and succumb to infection. Thus, our data reveal that despite late IFNk production, expression of kinase-inactive TYK2 is not sufficient to protect mice against low-dose systemic L. monocytogenes infection and worsens disease compared to complete loss of TYK2. Regarding cell typespecific functions of TYK2, our data unveil a critical role of TYK2 in NK cells in the anti-Listeria immunity. In contrast, mice with a macrophage/neutrophil-specific deletion of TYK2 were more resistant to infection. Deletion of TYK2 in dendritic cells did not grossly impact on survival. Conclusion: We thus hypothesize that due to its employment in different cytokine pathways and cell types, TYK2 exhibits both protective and detrimental functions in the immune response against bacterial infections. Introduction: Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) are a diverse set of genes upregulated in response to interferon and are major components of cellular immunity to intracellular pathogens such as viruses. Despite the importance of these ISGs in cellular immunity, the functions of most ISGs are unknown. In recent screening efforts, we found multiple ISGs to be inhibitory to the infection of a panel of viruses. Interestingly, a small number of ISGs were found to enhance infection of multiple viruses. One of the more robustly enhancing ISGs was mucolipin-2 (MCOLN2), which promoted infection by a diverse set of viruses. The aim of this study is to determine the mechanism of action of MCOLN2 in viral infection to in turn better understand the purpose of seemingly enhancing viral infection from the host standpoint. Methods: Lentiviral ectopic expression and CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing were used to modulate MCOLN2 expression. Viral infectivity was quantitated using a flow cytometry based system. Viral replication was quantified by plaque assays or using subgenomic replicons. Experiments analyzing viral entry used RT-qPCR based, cell fractionation based, and confocal microscopy based approaches. Results: We found that ectopic expression of MCOLN2 enhanced infection of multiple, unrelated, enveloped viruses. These included influenza A virus, yellow fever virus, and equine arterivirus. A role for MCOLN2 in viral infection was confirmed with CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout experiments. Mechanistic studies showed that MCOLN2 specifically enhances viral entry after receptor mediated endocytosis of the virus but prior to viral replication. We have developed a suboptimal antibiotic mouse model of infection to determine the full impact of cytokine storm during infection. Results: Over the last few years our laboratory has focused on the use of anti-inflammatory compounds (either alone or in combination with antimicrobials) to potentially increase survival and/or extend time to death. We have demonstrated proof of principle that the use of a host-targeted therapy (i.e. anti-HMGB1 antibodies), in combination with levofloxacin during a F. tularensis Schu S4 infection can increase survival and widen the window of opportunity for traditional antibiotic treatments. Further, using immuno-histochemistry, the potential role of macrophages and regulatory T cells in the pathogenesis of the disease was also identified. Recently we have explored the role of regulatory T cells, which appear to be absent during the early stages of infection with F. tularensis, and the consequences of this in the context of immune dysregulation. Using DEREG mice, which specifically deplete FOXP3 regulatory T cells through the administration of diphtheria toxin, we have shown that bacterial burden in the liver and spleen is significantly reduced compared to wild type controls during an infection with F. tularensis live vaccine strain. Conclusion: Our ongoing research on the host immune response looks to establish the key immune cells/molecules during infection in order to improve the likelihood of identifying a novel (hosttargeting) post-exposure therapeutic that can treat tularemia and/or increase the efficacy of existing antimicrobials. Introduction: Cytosolic sensing of nucleic acids alerts cells of invading pathogens and leads to initiation of programs aimed at limiting infection. These programs are mediated by cytosolic receptors and cofactors for DNA (c-GAS/STING) and RNA (RIG-I/ IPS-1) sensing and include initiation of pro-inflammatory responses -tight regulation is paramount so as to limit collateral damage. Cell cycle and fertilization represent two scenarios when an inappropriate response to non-pathogen-derived nucleic acids would have dramatic consequences. We report on an unbiased approach to identify negative regulators of nucleic acid sensing and the discovery of a putative rheostat during fertilization. Results: We demonstrate that this regulator interacts physically with components of nucleic acid sensing pathway, targets TBK1 (a kinase critical for signaling downstream of both DNA and RNA sensing) for ubiquitination and degradation, and delineate domains that mediate the inhibitory functions. Furthermore, we identify a naturally occurring human nonsense mutation associated with male sterility that results in loss of protein function and hyper responses to nucleic acids. Conclusion: This discovery points to a fundamental requirement to control nucleic acid sensing machinery and suggest that its regulation may be critical in germline.

A very low percentage of cells that contained AF633 signal also contained DSRed signal, indicating decreased spore viability after uptake by pDCs. Dectin-1 expression on the surface of human pDCs was comparable to that of human monocytes, which are known to express Dectin-1. Dectin-1 was upregulated after stimulation with all viral stimuli. Curdlan induced the upregulation of costimulatory markers CD40, CD83, CD80, and CD86, as well as the production of IL-6 (but not IFN-a) and the upregulation of Dectin-1 itself. Finally, pDCs from HIV patients expressed modestly higher baseline levels of Dectin-1 on their cell surface, which remains consistent after curdlan and viral stimulation. We used in vitro model of ''chemokine" co-culture of polarized RAW 264.7 (Mph) and differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes. As a SIRT1 activator, we used novel small-molecule compound DCHC (3-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)-7-hydroxy-4H-chromen-4-one). Mph M1/ M2 polarization was characterized by real time PCR. Also, we modeled paracrine effect of M0, M1, M2 and M1-DCHC Mphs on differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes by using macrophage conditioned media (CM). Then, after short-term loading by insulin, 3T3L1 cells were analyzed on Akt phosphorylation by Western-blotting. Results: We have found that M1-Mphs express predominantly inflammatory markers (TNF-a, CXCL9) while M2-type cells produce mostly anti-inflammatory factors (ALOX-15, IGF-1). M1 Mphs treated with DCHC (M1-DCHC Mphs) were characterised by intermediate expression of inflammatory markers and anti-inflammatory markers which was closer to M2 phenotype. We have found that M1-cell CM exert a decrease of pAkt-Thr308 while increasing pAkt-Ser473 in 3T3L1 adipocytes. These effects were not observed if M2 and M1-DCHC cells' media was used for adipocyte treatment. On the contrary, M2 Mph and M1-DCHC Mph CM induced the increase of pAkt-Thr308 and decrease in pAkt-Ser473. We have identified critical roles of CIKS/Act1-mediated signaling in imiquimod-induced psoriatic inflammation, a mouse model that shares features with the human disease. Results: IL-17 cytokine/CIKS-mediated signaling into keratinocytes was essential for neutrophilic micro-abscess formation and contributed to hyper-proliferation and markedly attenuated differentiation of keratinocytes, in part via direct effects of this cytokine on keratinocytes. Interestingly, IL-17 signaling into keratinocytes also exerted a negative feedback, delimiting the accumulation of IL-17producing cdT cells in skin; this led to reduced IL-17 production over time, as dermal cdT are the primary source of this cytokine in this model. We now demonstrate that the negative feedback is mediated in part via IL-19, a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines. IL-19 is strongly induced by IL-17-stimulated keratinocytes and appears to function at least in part via an autocrine/paracrine mechanism to suppress recruitment of IL-17-producing cdT cells, thereby dampening IL-17 production. This stands in contrast to IL-17 cytokines/CIKS-mediated signaling into non-keratinocytes, particularly dermal fibroblasts during the early phase of the inflammation, which promoted cellular infiltration and enhanced accumulation of IL-17-producing cdT cells in skin, comprising an initial positive feedforward mechanism. Conclusion: Our data show that CIKS-mediated signaling is dynamic and central to the development of both dermal and epidermal hallmarks of psoriasis, inducing distinct pathologies via target cellspecific effects, but also initiating mechanisms that ultimately mitigate further damage. The latter mechanisms may offer additional avenues for therapeutic intervention. is G-enteric pathogen that causes self-limiting gastroenteritis in the human and the pig. The aim of this work was to modify LPS of Salmonella Typhimurium to modify TLR4 signaling and local production of inflammatory cytokines. Methods: One-week-old hysterectomy-derived germ-free piglets (GF) were infected with S. Typhimurium (ST) or its isogenic rfaG mutant for 24 h. Salmonella CFU counting, TLR4, MyD88 and TRIF transcriptions in the ileum were evaluated by RT-qPCR, IL-8, TNFalpha and HMGB1 proteins by ELISA. Results: ST and its rfaG mutant comparably colonized the ileum of the gnotobiotic piglets. While TLR4 transcription was increased in ST group, the transcriptions in rfaG group were similar with GF piglets. MyD88 was decreased but TRIF increased in ST group while rfaG group was comparable with GF piglets. IL-8, TNF-alpha and HMGB1 were induced in ST piglets only. Conclusion: TLR4 is the receptor for LPS. While ST induced high levels of IL-8, TNF-alfa and HMGB1 in ileum that may be harmful, the rough LPS mutant did not induce them at all. Future incorporation of other molecules related to LPS and TLR4 as MD-2, CD-14 and LBP would contribute to clarify relations of LPS type and TLR4-signaling. Introduction: Human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex and heterogeneous. Interaction of various genetic and environmental factors leads to a loss of immunological tolerance against the gut residing microbial flora and subsequent chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. No single IBD animal model accurately mimics the complexity and heterogeneity of human disease. However, mechanistic animal models are useful for hypothesis testing and to interrogate biological pathways for drug discovery. Methods: We aimed to characterize, with greater temporal and biological resolution, a model of innate acute colitis induced by stimulation of the proinflammatory receptor CD40 with an agonistic antibody in lymphopenic RAG2-/-mice in order to gain better insights into the pathobiology. Results: Our comprehensive analyses of the time course of inflammation show the dynamic nature of the colonic versus systemic immune response, changes in cytokine network and histopathological changes in the gut, spleen and liver. Unexpectedly, we found that the inflammatory response causes time-related dysbiosis in the gut flora. Colitis induction in this model is dependent upon the presence of innate lymphocytes. Treatment with antibodies against the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12, IL-23 or TNF-alpha attenuated the inflammatory cascade differently, indicating unique functional roles for pathways activated by these cytokines. Conclusion: Our data reveal novel disease mechanisms for this model leading to a better understanding of the pathobiology in this colitis model. Introduction: Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) constitute the primary barrier that separate us from the outside environment. Their apical side faces the lumen of the gut while their basolateral side faces the lamina propia. While being fully functional to combat pathogen intruders, IECs have developed specific mechanisms to regulate their intrinsic immune response to tolerate the presence of the commensal flora in the lumen of the gut. This tailored response is key to maintain gut homeostasis but little is known on the molecular mechanisms that lead to this perfectly balanced immune tolerance. Methods: Here, we use human IECs grown on transwells to recapitulate the epithelium architecture in order to address how immune homeostasis is achieved in the gut. Results: We addressed whether the polarized nature of IECs influences their innate immune response upon viral infection. We found that when infection of IECs initiates from the basolateral side a stronger innate immune response is triggered. This response is characterized by a prolonged production of type III interferon (IFN) compared to infection emanating from the apical side. Using CRISPR/ Cas9 gene editing and molecular trans-complementation approaches, we demonstrated that this asymmetric response is mediated by the RIG-I like receptor pathway and is fully dependent on the polarized nature of IECs. Additionally, we found, unlike in mouse, human IECs are fully responsive to both type I and III IFNs. Importantly, we define, for the first time, functional differences between these two IFNs in epithelial cells. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that human IECs have developed unique mechanisms to regulate their immune response as function of infection side and by specifically functionalizing type III IFN. This polarized response would represent a strategy to maintain gut immune homeostasis by avoiding excessive response against viruses located in the luminal side while maintaining full responsiveness against viruses that have passed the epithelium barrier.

Introduction: IFN-k4, a recently discovered type-III interferon (IFN), is genetically regulated, and has clinical significance because of its association with impaired clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 1 . Type-III IFNs play a critical role in the innate immune response to viral infections 2 . Although IFN-k4 induces a similar antiviral profile as other type-III IFNs, its specific contribution to the innate immune response is unclear. Delineating the functional properties of IFN-k4 that distinguish it from other type-III IFNs may give insights into its unique role during HCV, and other viral infections. Methods: We compared antiviral responses induced by recombinant IFN-k4 versus IFN-k3; the proteins were expressed in stable inducible cell lines or used exogenously in the HepG2 human hepatoma cell line. We measured several IFN-induced responses, including activation of a luciferase reporter under control of an IFNstimulated response element (ISRE), phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and the ability to induce antiviral activity against an infectious challenge with Sendai virus (SeV). Results: IFN-k4 showed significantly higher antiviral activity than IFN-k3 within the first 4 h of treatment, antiviral activity of both IFNs was comparable by 8 h, but antiviral activity of IFN-k4 declined sharply after 24 h unlike IFN-k3 which maintained its activity. This data was supported by a stronger but more transient induction of STAT phosphorylation by IFN-k4 compared to IFN-k3. We also show that despite its poor secretion, IFN-k4 was significantly more potent than IFN-k3 in HepG2 cells engineered to express GFP-tagged IFN-k3 or IFN-k4 and IFN-k4 was more effective at inhibiting Sendai virus infection at early time points compared to IFN-k3. Introduction: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in premature infants, although the specific molecular mechanisms responsible for NEC development remain unclear. NEC is characterized by intestinal epithelial barrier disruption, enterocyte apoptosis and impaired mucosal healing. Recent evidence suggests a critical role for IL-22 in the regulation of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and promotion of epithelial healing. We hypothesized that IL-22 signaling is important in protecting against NEC, and subsequently, IL-22 deficient mice would be susceptible to NEC. Methods: Experimental NEC was induced in neonatal (postnatal day 7) wild-type (WT), IL-22 knockout, and intestinal deficient IL-22Ra1 (villin-cre X IL22ra1 fl/fl ) mice using gavage formula feeds (5 times/ day, 4 d) and intermittent hypoxia (5%O 2 , 95%N 2 , 10 min, twice daily). Recombinant IL-22 was administered intraperitoneally (1 mg/ gram body weight) daily in WT mice. NEC severity was assessed using histology and small intestinal mRNA expression of proinflammatory markers, iNOS and IL-6. Immunohistochemistry was performed for enterocyte proliferation and apoptosis. Results: In WT mice, experimental NEC resulted in disruption of the intestinal mucosal architecture, decreased enterocyte proliferation and increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and iNOS within the intestine. Importantly, IL-22 knockout and intestinal deficient IL-22Ra1 mice were very susceptible to experimental NEC development and demonstrated accelerated NEC-related mortality, derangement of the villi architecture on histology, and upregulation of pro-inflammatory markers IL-6 and iNOS. Immunohistochemistry revealed decreased enterocyte proliferation and increased enterocyte apoptosis in IL-22 knockout and intestinal deficient IL-22Ra1mice compared to controls. Strikingly, we further demonstrate that recombinant IL-22 attenuates experimental NEC severity in WT mice. Introduction: Propolis is a resinous product made by honeybees from various plant parts and has attracted the attention of researchers because of its biological properties, highlighting its immunomodulatory effects. Monocytes are circulating mononuclear phagocytes that can adopt different roles dependent on the activating stimuli in their microenvironment. LPS is one of the most potent activators of monocytes driving CD4 + T cells polarization. This work aimed to investigate propolis immunomodulatory action on cytokine production by LPS-activated human monocytes, assessing cell viability and TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-10 production. Methods: Human monocytes were obtained from healthy donors and stimulated with LPS (1 ìg/mL), propolis (P -5 and 25 ìg/mL) and their combination (LPS + P) for 18 h. A possible cytotoxic effect was assessed by MTT assay, and LPS-induced cytokines production were determined by ELISA. Significant differences were determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Dunnett's test (P < 0.05). Results: Data showed that cell viability was not affected after monocytes incubation with propolis alone or in combination with LPS. Propolis inhibited TNF-a and IL-6 production by LPS-activated human monocytes, whereas the combination (LPS + P) increased IL-10 release. Conclusion: Propolis displayed an anti-inflammatory activity by decreasing LPS action in TNF-a and IL-6 production by human monocytes; moreover, propolis induced IL-10 production even in the presence of LPS. These findings may provide a novel therapeutic approach modulating monocytes activity by propolis. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Even highly biocompatible materials, such as titanium-based devices, cause some degree of host response, thought to play a significant role in subsequent regenerative responses. However, the mechanisms involved in triggering host response, as well the role of host response in the ensuing regeneration, remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of MyD88 signaling molecule, part of CD14/TLR/MyD88 signaling complex, in the genesis and modulation of inflammatory immune response to a titanium (Ti) implantation and its impact in the following healing/ regeneration. The experimental groups were comprised of eight-weekold, male wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice and mice with targeted disruption of the MyD88 (MyD88KO) (CEEPA-FOB/USP, process #012/2014). Ti-discs were implanted in the subcutaneous tissue of C57BL/6(WT) and MyD88KO mice, comparatively evaluated using microscopic and molecular (RealTimePCRarray/ELISA/LAL Assay) parameter assessments at 1, 3, 7 and 21 days time points. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Ti-disc implantation in WT mice results in the local release of HMGB1 (measured by ELISA), the major endogenous ligand (and the better characterized DAMP) of CD14/TLR/MyD88 complex; while no exogenous ligands, such as LPS (measured by LAL Assay) and LTA (measured by ELISA) were detected in the implantation site. HMGB1 release was followed by a moderate and transitory leukocyte influx, and the inflammatory process resolution in parallel with fibrous connective tissue formation and discs encapsulation. MyD88KO mice presented a significant decrease in inflammatory response and delayed connective tissue capsule formation and maturation as evidenced by histomorphometric and birefringence analysis. RealTi-mePCRarray showed that the impaired healing response in the absence of MyD88 was associated with decreased levels of growth factors, cytokines and healing markers, such as FGF2, TGFb1, VEGFa, Col1a2, MMP2, MMP9, IL1beta, IL6, TNFalpha, CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL12; being this data confirmed by ELISA. Of note, several MSC markers (CD106, COT4, NANOG, CD146, NES and CD105) were reduced in MyD88 KO mice, suggesting MyD88-mediated host response also contributes to MSCs migration and/or activation after Ti-discs implantation. Conclusion: In summary, MyD88 (possibly activated by HMGB1) is a critical mediator of host inflammatory and healing responses to classic titanium-based biomaterials in subcutaneous tissue compartment, as evidenced by the significant decrease in inflammatory response and delayed connective tissue formation, as well as the decreased levels of molecular markers in MyD88KO mice compared to WT mice. These evidences contribute to the overall understanding of the role of host immune response in the healing process after biomaterial grafting. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: BATF3 has been shown to be a critical transcription factor for the development of a distinct subset of dendritic cells (DCs) characterized by the expression of CD24 and CD103 in the periphery and CD8a in lymphoid tissues. Using mice deficient for BATF3, these DCs have been shown in multiple models to be the required antigen presenting cells (APCs) for priming of CD8+ T cells, and are a critical source of the IL-12 needed to generate a protective T cell response during infection with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Protection from infection by T. gondii is dependent on a T cell response that can be generated by immunization the non-replicating CPS strain of T. gondii. Despite this low dose of parasite antigen, CPS immunization results in a T cell response with the same magnitude as that during active infection. It is not well understood what cells and cytokine signals are required for CPS to generate this T cell response. Surprisingly, it is shown here that BATF3-/-mice generate neither a CD8+ nor CD4+ T cell response to CPS immunization despite a previously undescribed role for BATF3 dependent DCs (BATF3 DCs) in priming CD4+ T cells. The aim of these studies is to determine what role BATF3 DCs play in priming CD4+ T cells during CPS immunization. Methods: Mice were immunized with the CPS, CPS-OVA, or CPS-Cre-mCherry parasites by intraperitoneal injection of 10^5 parasites. Peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) were obtained by peritoneal lavage using 8 mL of ice cold PBS. The omentum, LN, and spleen were then processed through 40 mm filters to generate single cell suspensions. Single cells suspensions were then stained for flow cytometry analysis on a LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences). Statistical analysis was performed using PRISM software (Graphpad Software). Results: Intraperitoneal immunization with a low dose of CPS is capable of generating a CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response that is primed within two days in the omentum as shown by CD69 expression on T cells in the peritoneum, omentum, draining lymph nodes, and spleen from 0 to 3 days post-immunization (dpi). To track the interactions of CPS with host immune cells in these tissues, Ai6 reporter mice were immunized with CPS-Cre-mCherry parasites and analyzed on 1 and 2 dpi. It is shown that resident peritoneal macrophages are the cells that primarily interact with the parasite, while BATF3 DCs do not directly interact with CPS. The role of IFN-g dependent migration of infected or injected cells from the peritoneum to the omentum in T cell priming was analyzed by blocking IFN-g on -1, 0, and 1 dpi of Ai6 mice with CPS-Cre-mCherry. Indeed, IFN-g was required for parasite antigen transport to the omentum as no cells that interacted with the parasite were observed in the omentum and T cells did not increase expression of CD69 at 2 dpi compared to mice injected with control IgG antibody. Conclusion: We hypothesize that CPS immunization induces IL-12 that promotes NK cells to produce this early IFN-g in the peritoneum. Future work aims to determine whether this DC subset is required for the processing and presentation of parasite antigen to CD4+ T cells during CPS immunization, or if these DCs serve as a required source of the IL-12 that induces NK cell IFN-g production and subsequent delivery of CPS antigen to APCs in the omentum. Introduction: The immune system generates innate and adaptive responses to ensure clearance of pathogens. Both are essential for host protection, but to develop sustained immunity, antigen-specific memory responses are needed. Dendritic cells (DCs) are key players as they bridge innate and adaptive immune responses. They activate and polarise T cells into effector cells which are crucial for adaptive immunity. The induction of immune responses is crucial to fight infections, but it can be also detrimental to the host and tight regulation is needed. Ubiquitination is an important mechanism of regulating immune responses. There are multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases, which have been studied in context of immunity, but the role of Pellino proteins is just emerging. Significant progress has been made on delineating the role of Pellino1 and Pellino3 but the physiological roles of Pellino2 are poorly understood. The current study aimed to use Pellino2-deficient mice to explore Pellino2 function in immune responses. We utilized CD4 cre IL-10 flox mice to examine the impact that IL-10 production by T cells has on MCMV persistence, and studied IL-10 (10-Bit) reporter mice in protein phenotyping and RNA sequencing to characterize mucosal IL-10 + CD4 + T cells. Results: Mice lacking T cell derived-IL-10 exhibit heightened virusspecific T cell responses and improved control of virus replication. These data suggest that targeting mechanisms that regulate the generation of mucosal IL-10 + CD4 + T cells will improve antiviral control. Development of salivary gland IL-10 + T cells was independent of the previously identified IL-10-inducing cytokines IL-27, IL-12 and TGF-beta. Transcriptomic analyses and protein phenotyping of IL-10 + CD4 + T cells revealed that these cells exhibit a distinct transcription factor and surface receptor expression profile as compared to IL-10 -CD4 + T cells that implicates multiple pathways, currently being examined in the laboratory, in the development of this important regulatory T cell population. The biological activity of MIF in murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) was inhibited using a small molecule inhibitor, COR123625. Concurrently, BMDM derived from Mif -/mice were employed to evaluate the effects of MIF depletion on regulation of IL-1 family cytokines. mRNA expression was analyzed by qRT PCR. Protein expression and secretion of both pro-IL-1b and secreted IL-1b was assessed by western blot. Levels of secreted IL-1a, IL-1b and IL-18 were determined by ELISA. Results: We show that depletion of MIF in macrophages significantly reduced IL-1 cytokine family release in response to NLRP3-activating stimuli, but has no effect on the secretion of TNF-a, IL-6 and MCP-1 (CCL2). Moreover, diminished IL-1 responses were independent of NF-kB function and production of pro-IL-1b. Instead, MIF depletion specifically inhibits NLRP3-mediated responses; IL-1 cytokine secretion was unaffected following activation of the AIM2 or NLRC4 inflammasomes. Conclusion: Our findings reveal a novel role for MIF in the modulation of IL-1-dependent inflammatory responses, linking MIF directly to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This study for the first time implicates a specific role for MIF in the release of IL-1 family cytokines and highlights the potential of targeting MIF in IL-1dependent pathologies. Introduction: Pathogenesis of allergic diseases including asthma is strongly associated with robust responses of Th2 cells, which produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine that is expressed upon epithelial infection or dysfunction and is implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic disorders. Although the functions of TSLP in stimulating dendritic cells and promoting Th2 differentiation are well appreciated, direct mechanisms of action of TSLP on the Th2 effector state remain to be elucidated. Previously, TSLP was shown to increase responsiveness of human CD4 T cells to IL-2 and enhance survival of murine CD4 cells by inducing JAK1/JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway [1, 2] . Now we sought to determine the role of TSLP in Th2 cell differentiation and gain insight into its molecular mechanism of action during TCR activation. Methods: Adoptive transfer of wild-type (WT) and TSLP receptordeficient CD4 cells into Tcra KO mice followed by house dust mite (HDM) administration was used to define CD4 T cell specific effects of TSLP in an asthma model. Naïve CD4 cells were activated by TCR in the presence or absence of TSLP or IL-4 to assess cytokine production of differentiated cells in primary and then secondary responses after adoptive transfer into WT mice. Flow cytometry, RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq analyses were performed to explore cellular and molecular profiles of TSLP-and IL-4-primed Th2 cells. Results: We found that TSLP signaling in CD4 T cells during allergen exposure of the lung enhanced allergic airway inflammation. In vitro analysis revealed that TSLP-primed CD4 cells produced increased amounts of pro-allergic cytokines, notably IL-5 and IL-13, in primary as well as secondary responses, and this was accompanied by distinctive epigenetic changes in the Th2 cytokine locus. Importantly, TSLP induced Th2 cytokine expression independently of IL-4 after TCR activation, but both cytokines are required for a sustained Th2 differentiation with enhanced production of pro-allergic cytokines. Introduction: Interleukin-15 (IL-15) signaling is essential for the development and maintenance of natural killer (NK) cells, with STAT5A and STAT5B proteins being key transcription factors that mediate the actions of this cytokine. We previously reported that splenic NK cells are decreased in Stat5a/Stat5b double knockin (DKI) tetramer-deficient mice, but how STAT5 tetramers act to maintain normal numbers of NK cells remains unknown. Methods: Using flow cytometric analysis, we analyzed NK cells from bone marrow, thymus, liver, and spleen in wild type (WT) and Stat5 DKI mice. We also compared proliferative responses by CFSE labeling, determined NK cell viability using 7AAD and Annexin V staining, and measured active caspases using FLICA staining. Moreover, we used RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq analyses to identify STAT5 tetramer regulated mRNAs and STAT5 tetramer target genes in mouse NK cells. Results: We found markedly decreased CD11b + CD27 low mature NK cells, especially in the bone marrow of Stat5 DKI mice, indicating an essential role for STAT5 tetramers in NK maturation. Despite this developmental defect, Stat5 DKI NK cells from bone marrow and spleen exhibited similar proliferation to that observed with WT NK cells. Interestingly, tissue resident NK cells in Stat5 DKI liver developed normally. We also found decreased expression of Prdm1 in bone marrow NK cells and of Prdm1 and Tbx21 in CD11b -CD27 + splenic NK cells in Stat5 DKI mice, which potentially explains the partial block in the late-stage maturation of NK cells. Moreover, Stat5 DKI NK cells were more susceptible than WT NK cells to cytokine withdrawal-induced cell death, with direct regulation of Bcl2 expression by STAT5 tetramers in response to IL-15 stimulation and increased active caspases in Stat5 DKI NK cells. Conclusion: These findings reveal critical roles of STAT5 dimers in the early development of NK cells and indispensable roles of STAT5 tetramers in the late-stage maturation and survival of conventional NK cells in vivo.

We further looked for specific miRNA role in ILC2 cell regulation by using mice with conditionally deleted miR 17~92 cluster. We isolated ILC2s from the lungs and cultured them with IL-33/TSLP/IL-7 and examined the cytokine production and growth of these cells. For the in vivo study of ILC2 function, mice were challenged with the natural allergen papain. Results: ILC2 cells were severely reduced in Dgcr8 knockout mice. miR 17~92 cluster knockout ILC2 cells proliferation and IL-5 and IL-13 expression was significantly reduced compare to wild type ILC2 cells in response to IL-33/TSLP/IL-7 in vitro. Knockout ILC2 cells transfected with mature miR 19a mimic showed increased IL-13 production compared to control mimic transfected cells. Knockout ILC2 cells exhibited increased expression of the miR 17~92 cluster direct targets Tnfaip3, Socs1, Rora and Bmpr2. Knockout ILC2 cells showed increased IL-13 expression by inhibition of Tnfaip3 and Socs1 via siRNA approach. ILC2 cells expansion and functions were impaired in knockout mice in the Papain allergic model. Conclusion: miRNAs regulate diverse aspects of ILC2 cell biology including homeostasis and function. miR 17~92 cluster is required to support Th2 cytokine production in ILC2 cells and repress the expression of its direct targets, the Th2 signaling inhibitors SOCS1 and Tnfaip3. miR 17~92 amplified similar signals to support the production of Th2 cytokines in both Th2 and ILC2 cells, which suggest that miR 17~92 might be a useful drug target of allergic airway inflammation. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. are intracellular negative regulators often induced to limit cytokine signaling in a classic negative feedback loop. They are characterized by a central SH2 domain and a C-terminal SOCS box sequence motif which recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. We have used a multidisciplinary approach to show that CIS (encoded by Cish) is the critical negative regulator of IL-15 signaling in NK cells. Results: Cish was rapidly induced in response to IL-15 and deletion of Cish rendered NK cells hypersensitive to IL-15, as evidenced by enhanced proliferation, survival, IFN-k production and cytotoxicity towards tumors. This was associated with increased JAK-STAT signaling in NK cells in which Cish was deleted. Correspondingly, CIS interacted with the tyrosine kinase JAK1, specifically inhibiting its enzymatic activity and targeting JAK1 for proteasomal degradation. Cish -/mice were resistant to experimental melanoma, prostate and breast cancer metastasis in vivo, and this was intrinsic to NK cell activity. Remarkably, Cish -/mice treated with antibodies against PD-1 and CTLA-4 (currently one of the most effective treatments against advanced melanoma) developed even fewer metastases than control Cish -/mice, highlighting the potential therapeutic benefit that could be achieved if anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapy was combined with loss of CIS function. Conclusion: This study has uncovered a potent intracellular checkpoint in NK cell-mediated tumor immunity and holds promise for novel cancer immunotherapies directed at blocking CIS function. CRP and suPAR were both predictors of 30-day mortality with HRs of 3.40 (95% CI 3.07-3.77) for log10(CRP) and 3.08 (2.86-3.32) for log2 (suPAR) when adjusting for age and sex. When the model was adjusted for both CRP and suPAR, the HRs were 2.41 (2.16-2.68) for log10(CRP) and 2.38 (2.18-2.59) for log2(suPAR). There was no interaction between suPAR and CRP (P 0.39). The AUC for ROC curve analysis for predicting 30-day mortality was 0.79 (95% CI 0.78-0.80) for sex and age. Adding CRP improved the AUC to 0.84 (95% CI 0.83-0.85, P < 0.0001). Adding suPAR was better than adding CRP, AUC 0.86 (95% CI 0.85-0.87, P 0.005). Combining sex, age, CRP, and suPAR improved the AUC to 0.88 (95% CI 0.87-0.89, P < 0.0001). Conclusion: Like CRP, suPAR is positively correlated with components of innate immunity, including CRP, total leukocyte count, monocytes, and neutrophils. CRP and suPAR are strong predictors of mortality in acute medical patients after adjusting for other risk factors, and suPAR adds significant prognostic information to the established inflammation marker CRP. Both biomarkers may therefore aid in the risk stratification in the acute care setting, as patients with increased CRP and suPAR are at higher risk of dying. Introduction: Th17 cells drive autoimmune inflammation through production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-17, GM-CSF and IFNk. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) has physiological roles in central nervous system (CNS) development including myelination, but is best known for its role in promoting amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease. BACE1 is also thought to contribute to neurodegenerative processes triggered by CNS injury, and is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli. On the other hand, BACE1 deficiency causes impaired myelination of the CNS and has been reported to reduce repair following peripheral nerve injury. We therefore sought to investigate the role of BACE1 in Th17-induced neuroinflammation in the mouse model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Methods: Active EAE was induced by immunizing with MOG(35-55) in CFA. Passive transfer of EAE was achieved by culturing cells from immunized donors with MOG(35-55) and IL-23, or by activating 2D2 cells under Th17 polarizing conditions, followed by transfer into naive recipients. Clinical scores were monitored, and T cells analyzed by flow cytometry and ELISA. Naive T cells were also differentiated under Th0, Th17, Th1 conditions and analyzed by flow cytometry, ELISA, qPCR and RNA-Seq. Results: BACE1 -/mice were more susceptible to EAE, as expected from myelin defects, but the severity of EAE was not increased. Unexpectedly, BACE1 deficiency resulted in defective IL-17 but not IFNk production by MOG-reactive T cells. When BACE1 deficiency was restricted only to T cells, this resulted in protection from disease in both active EAE and in passive transfer of myelin-reactive Th17 cells. BACE1 promotion of IL-17 was T cell intrinsic, as demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo co-cultures, and acted downstream of RORct. Expression of other Th17 factors IL-17F, GMCSF and RORct were not affected by BACE1, as confirmed by RNA-Seq of BACE1 -/and WT Th17 cells.
