Cell Culture: A rat hepatocyte line (clone-9; Cl-9) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Kaighn of The Pasadena Foundation for Medical Research (Pasadena, CA). Cells were cultured at 37°C in an air/5% CO2 atmosphere with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and antibiotics. A rat pituitary cell line (GH 3. l ) was obtained from Dr. Carter Bancroft (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, NY) and cultured as above in spinner minimal essential medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum/l 5% horse serum and antibiotics. Labelling and Preparation of Cell Extracts: Hepatocyte monolayers were grown in 35-mm dishes to a density of approximately 5 x 106 cells per dish. Before labeling, the cultures were rinsed with RPMI free ofmethionine and incubated in this medium for l h to allow for the depletion of the intracellular methionine pool. Cells were pulse-labeled for l h in methioninefree medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed horse serum and [3SS]methionine ( 100 #Ci/ml). In experiments employing tunicamycin (2 #g/ml), confluent cultures were first incubated with the drug for 1 h in complete medium and then for 1 h with methionine-free medium before adding methionine (100 #Ci/ml) and contin-uing incubation in the presence of tunicamycin. For mannose labeling, hepatocytes (2 x 107 cells) were incubated for the indicated times in RPM1-10% horse serum supplemented with 2[aH]D-mannose at a concentration of l mCi/ml (24.3 Ci/mmol). After labeling, monolayers were washed twice with Moscona's PBS (36) and cells were scraped offthe dish into an SDS solution (20 mM Tris-HCl, 7.4, 2% SDS) and sonicated 10-30 s in a Heat Systems-Ultrasonics Instrument with a microtip (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc. Plainview, NY). The suspension was boiled for 2 min and centrifuged (2 min at 15,000 g) in an Eppendorf 5412 to remove unsolubilized material. The supernatant was diluted fourfold with 50 mM Tris-HCl 7.4, 190 mM NaCI, 6 mM EDTA, 2.5% Triton X-100, 0.02% NAN3, and 100 U/ml Trasylol (Solution A). Immuneprecipitation: Cell extracts were incubated with lgG fractions (300 ~g/ml) at room temperature for l h and at 4"C for 14 h before addition of protein-A-sepharose CL-4B beads. After incubation for 3 h at room temperature, the beads were sedimented, washed three times with Solution A containing 0.2% SDS, and boiled for 2 min in a solution of 10% SDS, l M dithiothreitol, 2 mM EDTA. RNA Extraction: Clone 9 hepatocytes or GH 3.1 pituitary cells were homogenized in a solution containing 5 M guanidine thiocyanate plus 100 mM mercaptoethanol at pH 5.0 (58). RNA was separated by centrifugation through 0.2 vol of 5.7 M CsCl2 as described by Liu et al. (32) . Similarly, total RNA was prepared from control rats starved for 18 h or from rats sacrificed 15-24 h after partial bepatectomy (l 6). Free and membrane-bound polysomes were prepared from cl-9 hepatocytes by a modification of the procedure of Ramsey and Steele (43) . Polysome pellets were rinsed with sterile water and the RNA was extracted with 5 M guanidine thiocyanate as described above. Poly A ÷ mRNA was purified by chromatography on oligo-dT cellulose (2) . Preparations of messenger RNA from the pituitary cell line GH 3. l were fractionated on a methyl mercury gel (40) to enrich for ribophorin encoding molecules. Cell-free Protein Synthesis: Wheat germ extracts (35) containing 12.5 ~Ci of [3SS]methionine and 0.03 A26o U of mRNA in 0.025 ml were incubated at 25"C for 90 min. Dog pancreas microsomal membranes, prepared as described by Shields and Blobel (52) , were added to a final concentration of 2 A26o U/ml. Samples from translation mixtures (0.2 ml) were boiled in 2% SDS, centrifuged (2 min at 15,000 g), and diluted fourfold with solution A. Immuneprecipitation was carried out as described above.
