Once you have identified the causes and sources of the costs, you must quantify them, which can be challenging. Rarely do items and services have clear price tags. Often, you must do a fair amount of sleuthing to determine what an item or service actually costs. There are many methods of gathering or estimating costs, each with its relative advantages and disadvantages: Charges. In some cases, the charges for a service or visit found on hospital, clinic, and insurance bills can serve as reasonable proxies for costs. Of course, these charges usually exceed the actual costs; therefore, an economic modeler will convert them to costs by using established cost-to-charge ratios or conversion factors. Moreover, bills may not break down the charges to the level of detail needed. For example, an emergency department visit charge may aggregate many components (e.g., placing an intravenous line, transporting the patient to different locations) of the visit but not identify what fraction of the charge is associated with each component. Finally, charges often do not always accurately reflect the resources consumed or services provided, as some items and services are not billable and some items on a bill may not have been consumed. Because the nature, scale, and impact of bioterrorist attacks and outbreaks are so different from many other medical and health problems, established health economic analytic methods, benchmarks (such as $50,000 QALY) and resources (such as the HUI) may not be applicable or enough to tackle important biosurveillance questions. For instance, is it appropriate to label a biosurveillance measure as not cost-effective if its cost-utility exceeds $50,000 QALY? Is it reasonable to rely on quality-of-life data derived from people who were not in the midst of an epidemic or attack? Can researchers use other more advanced economic methods from other industries? These are just some of the questions researchers and decision makers will struggle with in the near future.
