The term prevalence is sometimes erroneously used in the literature to describe the proportion of faecal samples containing parasites. We avoided the use of this term because the collected faecal samples are not necessarily an unbiased and representative sample of the entire wolf population. Nevertheless, we believe they provide a practical yet useful assessment of the extent of infection within a host population, especially if consistently used to compare different host populations.
