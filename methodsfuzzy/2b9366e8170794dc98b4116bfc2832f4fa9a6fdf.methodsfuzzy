A prospective, non-interventional observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Chennai, Tamilnadu The procedure was performed according to manufacturer instructions. The FilmArray RP contains its own internal controls within each pouch-an RNA process control and a second-stage PCR control. The xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (xTagRVP) is a fluorescence-labeled bead array based on a multiplex RT-PCR reaction in which the target-specific primers are chimeric, including a terminal universal tag sequence. The targets are similar to the viral targets of BioFire (no bacterial targets included) and RSV is typeable into RSV A and B. Nucleic acids were extracted using the EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v2 on the EZ1 advanced XL Biorobot workstation (Qiagen). Elution was performed in a 90 mL volume. The reverse transcription and PCR reactions were performed immediately after extraction according to manufacturer instructions. Bacteriophage lambda was used as a run control for the xTAG assays, as well as external positive and no-template controls. The study was approved by the hospital ethics clearance committee and the data was analyzed using Microsoft excel software and statistical analysis was done using SPSS software.
