Comparative phylogenomics studies involve analysis of the relative hybridisation capacity of sample bacterial DNA to reporter DNA elements that are bound to a microarray surface. DNA microarrays consist of minute samples of DNA (known as reporter elements) that are arrayed in a grid formation on a suitable medium. Each predicted coding sequence within a target genome or genomes is represented on the array by at least one specific reporter element. All DNA reporter elements are designed to minimise cross-hybridisation (hybridisation of DNA from one gene to reporter elements that represent other genes owing to sequence similarity) between spots. Sample genomic DNA from a test strain is labelled with a fluorescent marker (usually Cy3 or Cy5) and is competitively hybridised with genomic DNA from a control strain that has been labelled with a different fluorescent marker ( Figure 1 ). The control strain is usually DNA from the strain used to design the array, as this should hybridize to all reporter elements on the microarray. After washing to remove any unbound DNA, microarrays are scanned by a high-resolution fluorescence scanner, and the image obtained is analysed by specific software packages that are not discussed in this review. Control spots on the array and DNA 'spikes' in the labelling reaction can be used to aid normalisation of array data. A comparison of the levels of test and control DNA bound to each reporter element on the array can be performed and statistical methods are utilized to determine if the coding sequence in question is present, absent or highly divergent in the test strain. Which type of DNA microarray should be used? Polymerase chain reaction product-based DNA microarrays DNA microarrays often consist of gene fragments (reporter elements) amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that represent individual genes. Currently, up to 50 000 gene fragments can be spotted onto a single microscope slide using robotic technology. Advantages of this technology are: flexibility in the design of the array; the relative ease of production; and its relatively low cost. Multiple identical microarrays can be robotically printed in batches of over a hundred in a single run. Most of the cost in printing such arrays is caused by the synthesis of oligonucleotide primer pairs required for the amplification of target gene fragments. The use of clone libraries as the template for the amplification of PCR products can dramatically reduce this cost [8] .
