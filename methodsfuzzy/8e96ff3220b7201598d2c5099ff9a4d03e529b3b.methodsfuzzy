2.1. Materials. T. sinensis tree used for RNA-Seq belongs to red young leaf, one of four main genotypes in China. The one used in this preparation had grown for 10 years in the Botanical Garden at Shandong Agricultural University. Fresh young shoots and leaves were collected on April 15th (abbreviated as XC-L-4) and old leaves and shoots on June 15th (abbreviated as XC-L-6) for use in this study. These specimens were obtained from the same tree. After harvesting, these samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 ∘ C until further processing.
