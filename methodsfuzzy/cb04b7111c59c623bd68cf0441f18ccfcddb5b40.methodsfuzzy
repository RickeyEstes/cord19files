Small molecules used in this study. A list of the small molecules used in this study and their known targets according to the manufacturer is provided in Table S4 in the supplemental material. Cell culture. The human embryonic kidney HEK293T cell line (HEK-293T/17; ATCC CRL-11268) was grown at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . HEK293T cells were propagated in complete growth medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. All cell culture supplies were from Wellgene (Gyeongsan, South Korea) and Invitrogen (CA, USA). The neural progenitor cell line (NPC) used in this study carries a neuron differentiation Map2-Nluc marker and was provided by Jihwan Song (CHA Stem Cell Institute, CHA University). NPCs were cultured at a 1:1 ratio of N2 and B27 media with 20 ng/ml of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). N2 medium consisted of DMEM/F12 plus GlutaMAX, 1ϫ N2, 1ϫ nonessential amino acids, 5 g/ml insulin (Sigma), 100 M ␤-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), penicillin, and streptomycin. B27 medium consisted of Neurobasal medium, 1ϫ B27 with or without vitamin A, 1ϫ GlutaMAX, penicillin, and streptomycin (59) . NPCs were maintained on a poly-L-ornithine/laminin-coated dish or plate. All materials for media were supplied by Gibco unless mentioned otherwise. Recombinant virus construction and reverse genetics. A Tha-GFP recombinant virus was built based on the wild isolate Thailand RABV (isolate 8743 THA, EVAg collection, Ref-SKU: 014 V-02106). The complete sequence of Tha was cloned in Tha-pSDI-HH-flash-SC vector (Tha-rec) as previously described (15) . Using the same approach, the E2-Crimson gene was inserted into the virus to obtain a Tha-Crimson virus. Fragment F3-2 of the genome delimited by SanD1 and Sma1 (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material) was subcloned in Topo-TA vector (Invitrogen). A PacI restriction site was created by mutagenesis in the M-G intergenic region by replacing 2 bases (Fig. S1A) . The sequence encoding E2-Crimson was amplified from the pEGF-C1 vector (Invitrogen), with simultaneous addition of a short intergenic region that included the initiation and termination sequences of the M gene as indicated in Fig. S1A . The F3-2 fragment was then replaced in Tha-pSDI-HH-flash-SC vector. Tha-GFP and Tha-Crimson virus were rescued as previously described (15) . Full-length viral cDNA (2.5 g) and plasmids N-pTIT (2.5 g), P-pTIT (1.25 g), and L-pTIT (1.25 g) were transfected in 10 6 BSR T7/5 cells (60) in 6-well plates. Cells were then passaged every 3 days until 100% of the cells were infected. The supernatant was harvested and titrated on BSR cells to determine the MOI. The insertion of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene was shown to have no effect of viral replication compared to the results seen with the original Tha virus (Fig. S1B) . Liquid-dispensing and automation system. Several liquid-dispensing devices were used throughout this study. The siRNA duplexes were plated and transferred using a grade 384 stainless steel head with disposable low-volume polypropylene tips on a PP-384-M personal pipettor (Apricot Designs, Monrovia, CA). The addition of cell suspensions and solutions containing RABV was performed using a WellMate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), and cell fixation and staining were performed using an ELx405 automated washer (Biotek, VT, USA). Assay plates (Greiner Bio-One, NC, USA) were incubated in the tissue culture incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific) under conditions of controlled humidity at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . The assay was performed in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility with adherence to safety and handling guidelines regarding infectious pathogens. Kinome-focused siRNA screening for host factors involved in lyssavirus infection. The arrayed kinase-and-phosphatase-focused siRNA library (Ambion Silencer Select v4.0; Thermo Fisher Scientific) contains 3,024 siRNA duplexes covering 1,008 genes. The siRNA library was diluted from 20 M stock solutions to a concentration of 0.25 M, and 5-l volumes were transferred into assay plates for a final testing concentration of 25 nM. The screening was performed in a simple biological and technical replicate, considering that for each gene, 3 independent siRNA duplexes were tested at two different time points. Internal references were included in each assay plate with Silencer Select Negative Control no. 1 siRNA (4390843) as a negative control (siNEG), PLK1 siRNA (s449) as a phenotypic control, and GFP siRNA as a functional control. For the reverse transfection procedure, 5 l of a transfection mix containing 0.5 l Dharmafect1 (GE Life Sciences, CO, USA)-Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) was added to each well and the reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min to promote complex formation. Next, HEK293T cells were dispensed into the assay plates at 2,000 cells per well in 40 l of growth media and incubated with siRNA complexes for 72 h. One plate was used to determine the cell number present before infection. RABV solution was prepared in media for infection at an MOI of 5, and 10 l was dispensed into the assay plates. To measure different time points of infection, the first set of assay plates were processed after 18 h for events occurring in the early stage (first round of infection) and the second set of assay plates were processed after 36 h for events occurring in the late stage (second round of infection and late infection). Cells were fixed in 2.5% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min followed by staining of nuclei in a solution of 1 M Hoechst stain for 30 min. Images were acquired on an Operetta system (Perkin Elmer, MA, USA) for analysis of GFP fluorescence intensity and Hoechst-stained nuclei. A total of 4 images per well were acquired using a 10ϫ magnifying objective and analyzed using Columbus software (Perkin Elmer). RNAi screening data analysis and selection. Raw data were analyzed based on the biased discriminant analysis (BDA) method (61) . Briefly, the BDA method was employed as follows. To identify host factor modulators of RABV, the active siRNA duplexes were scored using a threshold based on standard deviations of the means of GFP fluorescence intensity values from the siNEG control. Host factors that are important for RABV infection ("viral helpers") were scored based on the Ϫ3 threshold and the mean, and suppressor genes ("viral inhibitors") were scored based on the ϩ2 threshold and the mean. Thresholds were determined empirically. Cytotoxic siRNA duplexes were scored based on the siNEG, and those showing a reduction in the count of nuclei greater than 70% (below the number of cells initially seeded) were deemed toxic. Host factors obtained with two or more cytotoxic siRNAs were labeled essential and not considered in the analysis. MAPK-focused and PI3K-focused compound screening and analysis. NPCs were dissociated by the use of 3 ml Accutase (StemPro) and resuspended in NPC medium (1:1 N2 and B27 media, with 20 ng/ml bFGF, without vitamin A), and 3,000 cells were plated per well in 384-well plates. The next day, bFGF was withdrawn to initiate neuronal differentiation, and the medium was refreshed (using 1:1 N2 and B27 media, with vitamin A) every 2 to 3 days for 2 weeks. Differentiation of the NPCs into neurons was confirmed by Nluc quantification (data not shown), and they were further processed after they reached a high density combined with a low level of cell clustering. HEK293T cells were plated in 384-well plates with 4,000 cells/well and incubated for 24 h before compound treatment was performed. Compounds were prepared in 2-fold dilutions in the 384-well format at 10 points, starting at 10 mM. On the day of experiment, cells were pretreated with compounds 6 h before infection. The compounds were tested in technical duplicate at 10 different concentrations and at two separate time points. One plate was used to determine the cell number before infection with Tha-E2 Crimson virus was performed at an MOI of 3 for neurons and with Tha-eGFP virus at an MOI of 5 for the 293T cells. During the following days, cells were fixed at 18 h and 36 h postinfection with 2.5% PFA and analyzed as described above. Bioinformatic analysis. For each gene with a positive hit, the GFP intensity measured with each active single siRNA was normalized to the mean of the data from the siNEG population to provide a "GFP score" (%). Networks were built using STRING v10.5 as follows: for hits to be considered high-confidence hits (i.e., with at least two positive single siRNA results), a "high-confidence score" (0.7) was required over 4 sources (text mining, experiments, databases, and coexpression), and for hits to be considered lowconfidence hits (i.e., with only one positive single siRNA result), a "very-high-confidence score" (0.9) was required over 3 sources (text mining, experiments, and databases). The networks were then merged in Cytoscape v3.4, and only the genes not labeled "essential," the genes labeled "high confidence," and the genes labeled "low confidence" involved in a direct interaction with a gene labeled "high confidence" were displayed. Signaling pathways were obtained using KEGG Mapper on the KEGG database (62) (63) (64) . Statistical analysis. Group comparisons of data were performed by one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using GraphPad Prism 7 software.
