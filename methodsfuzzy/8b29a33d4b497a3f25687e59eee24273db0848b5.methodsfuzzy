The most important physical approaches are evaporation-condensation and laser ablation [37, 38] . The absence of solvent contagion in the equipped thin films and the homogeny of NPs distribution are the compensation of physical synthesis methods in contrast with chemical processes. Tube furnace syntheses of silver NPs at atmospheric pressure has some disadvantages such as energy consumption, slow synthesis and call for high concentration [39] . Laser ablation of metallic bulk materials can be synthesized AgNPs in solution. Depends upon various factors, including the wavelength of the laser interrupting the metallic target, the period of the laser pulses, the ablation time extent and the efficient liquid medium, with or without the existence of surfactants, and the laser power are some of the factors which determine the ablation effectiveness and the characteristics of synthesized nano-silver particles [39, 40] . From available methods, Laser ablation is a unique and significant method which results pure and clean metallic nanoparticles without using chemical reagents in solution [37, 38] .
