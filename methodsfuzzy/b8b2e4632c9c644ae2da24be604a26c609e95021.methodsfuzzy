There are good reasons for establishing an etiologic diagnosis of CAP: (1) to permit optimal antibiotic selection of agents against a specific pathogen and limit the consequences of antibiotic misuse; (2) to identify pathogens of potential epidemiologic significance such as Legionella and TB; (3) to reduce overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, which hopefully will reduce selection pressure antimicrobial resistance; and (4) to potentially reduce adverse events. Thus, diagnostic testing to determine pneumonia etiology can have an essential role for patient care by ensuring appropriate and effective therapy for an individual. It can also play a vital role in disease surveillance and in defining etiologic spectrum and epidemiology characteristics of pneumonia cases and deaths. With the development of rapid antigen and molecular testing methods, the clinical laboratory is no longer reliant solely on traditional culture methods for detection of pathogens in clinical specimens and more rapid etiologic diagnoses may be achievable. However, the clinical impact of the use of molecular tests and the potential for point-of-care diagnosis remains to be clearly defined.
