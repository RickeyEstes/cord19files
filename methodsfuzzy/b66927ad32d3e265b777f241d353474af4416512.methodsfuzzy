L-132 cells were seeded at 5 × 10 3 cells/well in 96-well flatbottom culture in MEM 5% FCS. Cell counts were performed with the TB exclusion method. Cells were incubated at 37 • C in 5% CO 2 , for 48 h to obtain a confluent monolayer. After removing medium, 180 L of fresh MEM 2% FCS were added to each well. Cells were then infected at a multiplicity of 0.2, and 10-fold serial dilutions were carried out. Infected cells were incubated at 33 • C in 5% CO 2 for 6 days to obtain the optimal CPE. At the end of the incu-bation period, cells were fixed and stained with May-Grünwald and Giemsa. Fifty microliters/well of May-Grünwald solution were allowed to fix and stain cells for 5 min and after a washing step with tap water, 50 L/well of Giemsa solution were added for 15 min to achieve the final staining before a last washing step with tap water. Infected wells were counted under a phase-contrast inverted microscope (Olympus, Rungis, France) and viral titers or 50% cell culture infective dose (CCID 50 ), expressed as viral infectious particles mL −1 , were estimated according to the Reed and Muench method (Reed and Muench, 1938) .
