To assess whether the boldness of colonies' boldest individuals influenced collective-foraging behaviour, we generated a generalized linear model. We included the reward treatment (rewarding/ unrewarding stimulus), the day of the assay (1e5) and the boldness of the boldest individual as fixed effects. In addition to these effects, we included two interaction terms in our model: day*boldness of the boldest individual and day*boldness of the boldest individual*reward treatment. One model was created to predict colonies' latency to attack a prey, and a separate model was created to predict the total number of attackers that responded to the prey stimulus. To assess whether colonies' boldest individuals engaged in foraging behaviour more than generic individuals, we used chisquare tests. We performed a single test independently for each day. For each test, we compared the total number of colonies in which the putative keystone individual was the first attacker against a null expectation of one out of every 10 colonies, since there were 10 spiders in each colony. To control for type I error, we used a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha of 0.01 for these analyses. Then, to assess how the participation of colonies' boldest individuals changed over time, we created a generalized linear model with the day of the assay (1e5) and the reward treatment as fixed effects. In addition to these effects, we included the interaction term day*reward treatment as a predictor in our model. Our binary response variable for this model was whether colonies' boldest individuals did or did not participate in prey capture (coded as 1 ¼ attacked, 0 ¼ did not attack). To assess whether the presence of one extremely bold individual influenced within-colony behavioural variation at the end of our study, we generated a generalized linear model with the following predictor variables: boldness of the boldest individual, the reward treatment and their interaction term. For our response variable, we used the standard deviation in the boldness scores of the nine generic colony members taken at the end of our study. Note that colonies did not differ significantly in their within-colony behavioural variation at the start of our experiment (P > 0.90). To assess whether the boldness of colonies' boldest individuals influenced colony mass gain, we used a simple linear regression with the boldness of the boldest individual as the predictor variable and the collective change in mass of the nine generic individuals as our response variable. For this analysis, we restricted our focus to the rewarding stimulus treatment only. To assess whether the boldness of colonies' boldest individuals influenced survivorship of fellow colony members, we performed an ordinal logistic regression with the number of surviving generic group members (5e9) as our response variable, and the boldness of the boldest individual, the reward treatment and their interaction term as predictor variables.
