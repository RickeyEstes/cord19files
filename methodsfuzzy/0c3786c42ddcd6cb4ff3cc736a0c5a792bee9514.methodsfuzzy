Eleven naturally-infected cats were treated (four infected by FeLV, FeLV + ; seven infected by FIV, FIV + ), with ages ranging between 6 months and 10 years, including both male (7/11) and female (4/11), most of them (10/11) of mixed breed, and with different regimes of roaming. They were treated for eight weeks with commercial rFeIFN-(Virbagen ® , Virbac, France) following the protocol suggested by De Mari et al. (2004) . Ten other cats (five FeLV + and five FIV + ), eight of them female, and housed in a cattery, were left untreated and used as controls. The date of infection was unknown in all cases; presumably, the cats were in different stages of the disease, since they included three asymptomatic FIV + cats, and ten cats (4 FeLV + and 6 FIV + ) with six or more different retrovirus-associated clinical signs (RACS) of various degrees of severity (clinical score ≥6, severe disease). The most frequent disorders were anorexia, apathy, pallor and oral lesions. Blood samples were taken before the beginning of treatment (V1), and two weeks after completion (V2), with equivalent sampling dates in untreated cats. Three treated cats were brought for follow-up examination until month 12 (V3). Blood sampling, hemogram, leukogram, biochemical profile, electrophoretogram, and CD4/CD8 determination were conducted as described previously (Miro et al., 2007) . FeLV p27 and FIV p24 proteins were evaluated using commercial Petchek kits developed by Idexx (Westbrook, ME, USA), and RT activity was measured with kits provided by Cavidi Tech (Uppsala, Sweden). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted using the procedures described by Pinches et al. (2007) and Leutenegger et al. (1999) . Results were statistically analyzed using Statgraphics. Differences in the ANOVA and Chi-square values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Animal handling, treatment, reagent manipulations and data collection were all carried out in compliance with guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and Good Laboratory Practice of the Animal Welfare Committee of the Veterinary Clinical Hospital and the Complutense University (Madrid), and the experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Complutense University.
