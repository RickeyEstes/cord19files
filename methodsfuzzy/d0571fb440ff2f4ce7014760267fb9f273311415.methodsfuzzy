Analyses will be performed following the intention-to-treat principle (all randomised patients except those that withdrew consent). Statistical analyses will take into account the 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   18 The categorical variables will be reported as numbers and percentages, while continuous variables will be summarised using means (± standard deviation [SD]) or medians (interquartile range [IQR]) for normally and non-normally distributed data, along with their respective 95% confidence intervals. Analyses of the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints related to VAP incidence will use logistic regression models with adjustment for stratification factors. The cumulative event curves (time until first VAP diagnosis) will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier procedure. The number of ventilator-free days (VFD) is the number of days for which the patient is successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation until the endpoint at day 28 (or day 60). This is defined as follows: VFD = 0 for patients that died within 28 (or 60) days or required mechanical ventilation for 28 (or 60) or more days; VFDs = (28 [or 60] -x) for patients that were successfully weaned off mechanical ventilation within 28 (or 60) days, where x is the number of days on mechanical ventilation. The number of antibiotic-free days (AFD) is the number of days that the living patient did not receive antibiotics over 28 (or 60) days. Any prophylactic or curative antibiotic therapy related to the trauma will not be considered. The VFD and AFD will be assessed in the same manner, and will be compared between groups using regression models that allow adjustment for stratification factors. The other categorical secondary endpoints will be compared between groups using logistic regression models. Statistical analyses will all be conducted using SAS 9.3 software. Missing data will be described as the number and corresponding percentage for each group. The presence of any imbalance in the proportion of missing data between treatment groups will be evaluated using logistic regression models. To assess the robustness of the results in the case of missing data, sensitivity analyses will be performed with imputation of missing data (worst value such as failure, death, etc.) and multiple imputation.

Analyses of the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints related to VAP incidence will use logistic regression models adjusted for stratification factors and covariates significantly imbalanced between groups. The cumulative event curves (time until first VAP diagnosis) will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier procedure.
