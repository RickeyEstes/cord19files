Viruses. The virulent Shizuoka strain (Sasahara et al., 1958) of TGE virus was used for oral inoculation of pigs. The strain had been passaged 17 times in piglets and stored at -80°C in the form of a 10% suspension of infected small intestine. The TO strain of an attenuated TGE virus was used for production of antigen to be used for lymphocyte stimulation in vitro. The strain had been serially passaged in pig kidney cell cultures (Harada et al., 1969) , and was used at passage 168 in the present studies. Vesicular stomatitis virus (New Jersey type) was used as challenge virus in an interferon (IF) assay. Experimental pigs. A total of 28 Yorkshire pigs 2 to 3 months old, serologically negative for TGE antibody, were obtained from a farm where no outbreaks of TGE had been reported. Experimental design. Two experiments were carried out. In the first experiment, effects of the ambient temperatures on induction of immune responses and on production of IF in the intestinal tract in pigs inoculated orally with TGE virus were investigated. Twenty-two pigs were kept at the high temperature (30 + 2°C) for 4 days and then divided into two groups. Eleven pigs (Group 1) were transferred to the low temperature (4 ± I°C) room. Nine of them were infected orally with 104 50% pig infectious doses (IDs0) of virulent TGE virus and kept at 4°C. The remaining two pigs kept at 4°C were not infected and served as controls. Eleven pigs (Group 2) were maintained at the high temperature throughout the experiment. Nine of these pigs were exposed orally to 104 IDs0 of virulent TGE virus on the fourth day of the experiment, and the remaining two pigs served as uninfected controls. Three pigs inoculated with virus in each group were sacrificed at 3, 5 and 7 days post-inoculation (DPI), respectively. All the control pigs were killed on the seventh day of the experiment. Lymphocytes were collected from Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and peripheral blood of these pigs, and tested for proliferative reactivity to TGE viral antigen in vitro Shimizu, 1979a, 1979b) . IF activity of the intestinal contents and washings, obtained from all the pigs, was also examined. In the second experiment, the influence of an immunosuppressive drug on the protective effect induced in pigs by high ambient temperatures was investigated. Six pigs were kept at the high temperature. Three of them were given dexamethasone (DM), a synthetic corticosteroid, subcutaneously in doses of 5 mg/kg daily for 5 days, except on the third day when this dose of the drug was administered intravenously. On the fifth day of the experiment, all pigs were exposed orally to 104 IDso of virulent TGE virus, and maintained continuously at 30°C. The concentration of circulatory T lymphocytes and non-specific blastogenesis of peripheral lymphocytes to phytohaemagglutinin-P (PHA) were determined on the first and the fifth day of the experiment. Preparation of lymphocyte suspensions. Lymphocyte suspensions to be used in a lymphocyte proliferative assay were prepared by methods described previously Shimizu, 1979a, 1979b) .
