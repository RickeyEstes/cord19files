This study was performed on 15 hysterectomy-derived and colostrum-deprived (HDCD) piglets, which were individually housed in Horsfall type units. They were inoculated with the Belgian isolate of PRCV, designated TLM 83, at the age of 1 week either using different inoculation routes or different inoculation dosages. Three piglets were inoculated intravenously into the ear vein with l07 TCIDso in 5 cc phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and were euthanatized at 1 / 2, 1 and 1 1/2 days post inoculation (PI). Twelve piglets were inoculated into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract after laparotomy. One piglet was inoculated with 107 TCIDso into the gastric lumen and was slaughtered at 3 days PI. Three piglets were inoculated with 107 TCIDso into the lumen of the small intestine and killed 2, 3 and 3 days PI. The intestinal inoculation was performed at three sites, namely the cranial jejunum, mid jejunum and the ileum. Eight piglets were inoculated into the lumen of the cranial jejunum using different inoculation dosages. One piglet was inoculated with 107 TCIDso, two with 105, four with 103 and one with 10 ~. Each dose was suspended in 5 ml PBS. One piglet inoculated with 105 TCIDso and one with 103 were slaughtered 3 and 4 days PI respectively. The other piglets were followed for clinical signs and serological responses. Blood was sampled for the detection of TGEVseroneutralization (SN) antibodies at 0, 10, 20 and 25 days PI. Rectal-and tonsillar swabs were collected daily for viral isolation (VI). After euthanasia, the following tissues or samples were collected for viral isolation and/or immunofluorescence (IF): lung lobes, small intestine, mesenteric and bronchial lymph nodes, spleen, plasma and the contents of small intestine, large intestine and rectum. The small intestine was divided into seven segments equal in length and numbered from 1 (duodenum) to 7 (ileum). A piece of approximately 1.5 cm in length was collected for IF. VI was performed on the remaining parts. VI was performed according to standard procedures. The supernatant of a 20% suspension in PBS of each sample was inoculated on swine testicle (ST) cells in 10 tubes. Quantitative titrations of infectious virus were performed by inoculating I 0-fold dilutions of the supernatants on ST cells in microtitre plates. The IF-test was performed only on tissues which were positive by VI. IF was performed using as hyperimmune serum a specific antiserum to TGEV. The SN-test was performed in SK6 cells using the Purdue-114 strain of TGEV. INo virus isolated. 2Not determined. 31noculated in cranial and mid jejunum and ileum.
