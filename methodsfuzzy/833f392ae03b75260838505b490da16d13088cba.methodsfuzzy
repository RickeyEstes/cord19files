Animal and tissue samples Male Fischer 344 rats (Harlen Sprague Dawley, Inc, Indianapolis, IN), weighing 140-150 g at the beginning of the experiments, were used. The basal diet was obtained from Dyets, Inc., Bethlehem, PA. BR931 (LPB Instituto Farmaceutica S.P.A., Milan, Italy) and BR931 was incorporated in the basal diet at a concentration of 0.16%. Water was supplied ad libitum. On days 3, 7, 14, 28 and 56 after feeding of the designated diets was started, rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and their livers were removed, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70'C. After long term feeding of BR931, approximately 8-9 months, hepatic tumours and normal-adjacent livers were quickly removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70Â°C. RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis Frozen liver tissues were homogenised in guanidine monothiocyanate, using a Polytron homogeniser (Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY), and total RNA was isolated by the method of Chirgwin et al. (1979) . The polyadenylated RNA fraction was then isolated by passage of this RNA through oligodeozy-thymidylate cellullose columns (Collaborative Research, Waltham, MA) (Aviv & Leder, 1972) . Five jig samples of polyadenylated RNA were subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels that contained 6% formaldehyde and were then transferred to Hybond-N hybridisation transfer membranes (Amersham Corporation, Arlington Heights, IL). The membranes were then irradiated with UV light for 2-5 min. Hybridisation to appropriate 32p_ !abelled probes (see below) and autoradiography were per-formed according to Wahl et al. (1979) . After hybridisation to one probe and autoradiography, some filters were washed extensively and rehybridised to a second probe. A nonpolyadenylated RNA sample was included in each gel to provide rRNA molecular size markers (5.0 and 2.0 kilobases). In order to visualise the markers and the amount of RNA present in each lane, the gels were stained with ethidium bromide. The ethidium bromide staining indicated that all lanes contained approximately equivalent amounts of RNA. The relative abundance of specific transcripts in the different lanes was determined by densitometric analysis of the autoradiographs employing a Molecular Dynamics 300A computing densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). 'Fold induction' in a specific RNA was calculated as the ratio of the mean value (four or six animals/group) of abundance of that RNA in rats fed the BR391 diets to the corresponding value of the same RNA present in age-matched rats fed the basal diets (Govindarajulu, 1988 (Gonda et al., 1982) ; Ha-ras-specific insert, 460-base EcoRI fragment excised from the BS-9 clone (Ellis et al., 1980) ; c-myc, a 1.5kilobase PstI fragment excised from a pBR322 clone (Stanton et al., 1983) ; epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, a 768-base EcoRI fragment excised from HER64.3 plasmid (Ullrich et al., 1984) ; and ODC, a 2.4-kilobase EcoRI-BamHI fragment excised from pmODC-l plasmid (Kahana & Nathans, 1985) . The purified fragments were 32P-labelled by nick translation (Rigby et al., 1977) .
