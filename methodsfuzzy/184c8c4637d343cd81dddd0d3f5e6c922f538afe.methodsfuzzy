Ethics statement. This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The French North West I Hospital Ethics Committee (Comit√© de Protection des Personnes ''Nord-Ouest I'', University Hospital, Rouen, France) approved the research study. All patients provided written informed consent for the collection of samples and subsequent analysis. A prospective multicentre study was conducted in infants hospitalized for a first episode of acute bronchiolitis during three epidemic seasons (November to March 2002 March -2004 . Four pediatric centers in a same geographical location (North West of France) participated in the study. Inclusion criteria were as follows: Infants aged from 1 month to 1 year, requiring hospitalization for a first episode of acute bronchiolitis. The diagnosis was based on dyspnea and wheezing or crackles associated with lung hyperinflation on chest X-ray. Exclusion criteria were any administration of steroids, history of wheezing, or underlying disease susceptible to modify the natural outcome (immunodeficiency, chronic lung disease, cystic fibrosis, congenital heart disease etc.). Medical history and demographic data were collected. Atopy was defined by asthma, allergic rhinitis or eczema in first degree relatives, or by eczema in infants. Diagnosis and severity of bronchiolitis were first established in the Pediatric Emergency Department, where the decision to be hospitalized was made. The severity of the disease was assessed with SaO 2 %, a clinical score, the duration of oxygen requirement, and the length of hospitalization. The clinical score associated standard criteria previously described [13, 14] (Table 1) . Each item was scaled from 0 to 1 and the score varied from 0 to 18. Because the disease could worsen after admission, the infant was further scored daily. The highest score observed during the hospitalization was retained for determining the severity of the disease. The discharge of the patient was based on the following criteria: SaO 2 %$95%, normal respiratory rate (RR#47/min for infants aged ,2 mo, and #42/min when older) and no alteration in feeding during the past 24 h nor other complications directly related to the bronchiolitis. The length of the hospitalization was calculated as the time between the admission and the validation of the discharge criteria. Any prolonged hospitalization for other reasons was therefore not taken into account. The Rouen Hospital Ethics Committee approved the research study and informed consent was obtained from the parents.
