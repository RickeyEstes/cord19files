Nasal wash samples were obtained from trained medical staff from each side of the nose and placed in universal transport media. These were stored in fridge at 4Â°C and transported to the laboratory using carriers with ice packs within 24 h. An ISO15189-accredited laboratory that regularly takes part in QCMD EQA programmes was used to perform molecular diagnostic testing. Detailed laboratory methods have been described in the previous publication. 18 Briefly, this was done by the extraction of nucleic acids using the DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Inc, Valencia, CA, USA) and then tested using multiplex PCR assays coupled with bead array detection technology (Resplex I and II, version 2.0, Qiagen, Inc, Valencia, CA, USA) which can simultaneously detect and subtype 18 different pathogens. First, pathogens of the same genus were grouped (e.g. 'influenza A' includes its various subtypes, and 'enterovirus' also includes coxsackievirus, echovirus and rhinovirus). Demographic characteristics for controls, mono-pathogens, dual pathogens and patients with more than two pathogens were analysed and compared using descriptive statistics. Analyses on the prevalence of co-existing pathogens were then performed. Interval/ratio variables were compared using oneway analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA). Comparison of nominal variables with expected frequencies less than or equal to 5 was done using Fisher's exact test, while comparison of nominal variables with expected frequencies more than 5 was done using Pearson's chi-square test. Pearson's chi-square test was conducted to identify trend in proportions. Further analysis focussed on comparing patients with one and two pathogens. In this regard, i) controls, ii) patients with more than two pathogens as well as iii) mono-and dual pathogens with sample sizes of less than 15 observations (considered too small for analysis) were excluded. As a result, a total of 11 mono-pathogens and 18 dual-pathogen pairs were available for comparison. Permutation tests were conducted to compare the number of symptoms observed between mono-pathogen and dualpathogen patients for each pathogen as a proxy for severity of infection. To assess differences in symptom expression, dual pathogens were compared against mono-pathogens for mean proportions of 16 symptoms (or signs). Empirical proportions of symptoms with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for both mono-pathogens and dual pathogens were calculated and compared using Pearson's chi-square test at a significance level of 0.05. Symptoms with onsets in at least 30% of patients for a minimum of one pathogen or combination were described in detail. In particular, dual infections with statistically different results from their respective viral monoinfections were highlighted. R Statistical Software (version 3.0.3) was used to perform all statistical analyses. 19 Ethics approval was given by the Singapore military Joint Medical Committee for Research and the National University of Singapore's ethics review committee.
