Oligonucleotides design. Primers were designed using the Primer Premier 5.0 program. Like a TaqMan probe, the HFman probe was designed in general with a fluorophore and a quencher at 5′ and 3′ end, respectively; however, a better form of the HFman probe is to have a 3′ fluorophore and a 5′ quencher. All primers were synthesized commercially by Thermofisher scientific (Shanghai, China) . The detailed information of the primers, TaqMan and HFman probes are shown in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. Preparation of RNA standard and RNA templates with various mutants. Various target gene fragments (human genes or virus genomic sequences) containing a T7 promoter were obtained by gene synthesis or RT-PCR amplification, and then cloned into pMD18-T plasmids (TaKaRa, Dalian China). A series of mutants were prepared using Fast Mutagenesis System (Transgene Biotech, Beijing, China). To obtain RNA template, in vitro transcription were performed using the recombinant plasmids or amplification products of the plasmids. RNA was quantified, serially diluted and used as RNA standard or templates. The novel and conventional real-time RT-PCR reactions. The novel (using HFman probe) and conventional (using TaqMan
