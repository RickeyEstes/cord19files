This is a multicenter cross-sectional study. This research focused on results of a survey completed by the staff who were responsible for work organization at that ED, from 18 metropolitan teaching hospitals for the calendar years 2013 and 2014. The questionnaire included: A description of the source of data for each ED to complete the data collection from that ED, demographic information for each ED (including total annual census, subdivided as the total numbers of urgent care visits and the total numbers of outpatient visits), and the total numbers of ED-ICU and ED-Observation patients served each year in each ED (whether ED-Observation status occurred due to an inability to obtain agreement by inpatient doctors to admit the patient due to the perceived complexity of their needs, or due to the patient's need for long-term care of chronic or end-stage illness), and the total number of patients ''boarded'' in each ED each year before they were moved to an inpatient bed. To qualify as being ''boarded,'' the patient who was subsequently moved to an inpatient bed had to have stayed in the ED a minimum of 8 h after the decision to admit them for inpatient care was made, in keeping with the Australasian definition of ''access block.'' The time of a case of ED boarding starts when the decision to seek inpatient admission is made, and ends when the patient leaves the ED on their way to their inpatient bed. Also compiled were the 10 most frequent diagnoses for each ED's patients, including categories of diseases for the ED visits, categories of diseases necessitating urgent care, categories of patients placed in ED-Observation status, and symptom groupings for ED visits and hospital admissions. Also reported are the ''average ED waiting time'' for obtaining physician care (the average of the total time between initial registration or triage until the patient was first seen by a physician) and the average time spent in ED-boarding status (for those patients boarded in the ED before they were moved to an inpatient bed), and the average time spent in ED-Observation status for the ED-Observation patients (the interval between the time of arrival at triage until the time of departure of the patient from the ED after being in ED-Observation status). The demographic portion of the form was completed by the staff who was responsible for work organization at that ED. The administrative department of the hospital was responsible for the assurance of completion of the survey. The study team at each hospital was responsible for data entry work. Data were recorded manually on data collection sheets and subsequently transferred into a data spreadsheet (Excel, 2003; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) for further analysis.
