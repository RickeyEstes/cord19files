Drug therapy (in particular, opioids with or without Î± 2 -agonists) is a cornerstone for acute pain treatment and surgical preemptive pain prevention. However, local anesthetics delivered epidurally, via perineural or plexus injection, intraarticular or trigger point injection, are also effective analgesics for acute and chronic forms of pain and inflammation. The NSAIDs that classically have been reserved for treatment of more chronic or persistent pain states now are being used regularly for treatment of acute and perioperative pain once blood pressure, coagulation, and gastrointestinal parameters have been normalized.
