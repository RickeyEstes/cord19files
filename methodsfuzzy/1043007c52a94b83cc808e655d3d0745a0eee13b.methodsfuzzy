Mice 15 and 60 days old AI] mice (originating from the Pasteur Institute, Paris, France, bred in our mouse colony and periodically controlled for the absence of Coronavirus or specific antibodies), here referred as young and adult AI] mice, respectively, were used to study the mortality, the virus growth and the IFN-aJ~ and -y synthesis in peritoneal exudate and serum after MHV3 infection. We also investigated the MHV3 growth and IFN-aJ~ synthesis in cultured peritoneal macrophages as well as the IFN-y synthesis in cultured spleen cells.
