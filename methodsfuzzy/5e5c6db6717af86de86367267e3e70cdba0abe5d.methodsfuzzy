Experiments were carried out in a 32.25 m 3 (3.35 Â 4.26 Â 2.26 m) mechanically ventilated chamber, which is similar in size to a single bed hospital room. The chamber is operated at a negative pressure of approximately À25 Pa and air is HEPA filtered on the supply and extract. Air was supplied through a low level wall mounted diffuser (Inlet A, Fig. 1 ) and extracted through a high level diffuser on the opposite wall (Outlet A). The room was empty except for the bioaerosol source and sample tubes, there were no heat sources in the space and the room air was maintained at 21(AE1.1) C and 50(AE20)%RH. Bioaerosols were generated using a six jet collison nebulizer (CN 25, BGI Inc, USA) operated at 12 l/min with a maintained pressure of 20 psi. These were injected into the space via a 34 mm diameter plastic pipe that terminated with 3 parallel sets of 4 holes, spaced equally apart around the pipe and located in the centre of the room to simulate a point source. A linear source was also created using 8 repeats of the point source spread equally over a distance of 750 mm. A pure culture of Serratia marcescens (ATC274) was used to create the bioaerosols. This is a non fastidious organism that grows on general purpose media and performs comparably with other vegetative organisms when sampled from the air during controlled tests [38] . The nebulised liquid was created out of a 2 ml aliquot with concentration of approximately 1 Â 10 9 per ml suspended in 100 ml of sterile distilled water. For passive scalar validation the chamber was ventilated at a constant rate of either 6 or 12 ac/h for 4 h during which time the nebulizer was operated continuously. Forty five minutes were allowed for the ventilation air and bioaerosol concentration to stabilise, then air samples were taken sequentially from each of the 12 sampling locations (Fig. 1 ) every 10 min. Air was sampled through 5 mm plastic tubes using an Andersen sampler (Anderson Instruments, USA) and impacted onto 90 mm diameter plastic agar plates filled with Nutrient Agar. These were incubated for 24 h at 37 C and the resulting colony forming units (cfus) were counted and subjected to positive hole correction [39] before quantifying the concentration of Serratia marcesens in cfu/m 3 . Twelve sample repeats were carried out at each 12 locations spread over three distinct experiments. Deposition of bioaerosol particles on the chamber floor was measured for comparison with the Langrangian particle tracking model. In these experiments 21 nutrient agar plates were spaced out across the floor. The room was ventilated at a constant rate of 3 ac/h for 3 h with bacteria injected as above for the first 1.5 h. Air samples were taken every 20 min (equivalent to 1 air change rate). The air samples followed the same procedure as above but used only one sampling point close to outlet A. Following the experiment all the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 C and the colonies counted. Figs. 4e6 show the comparisons between the experimental measurements of bioaerosol concentration and the CFD results. These show the concentrations exported from the simulations along three lines alongside the equivalent experimental samples at a height of 1.15 m (see Fig. 1 ). Results are normalized in order to compare the pattern of dispersal between the simulations and experiments. For the experimental data a normalised value was found for each experiment and the average of all three experiments used for comparison. For the simulations the values are normalised using the average from all three lines. As can be seen in Figs. 4e6 there is a large variation in bioaerosol measurements which is likely to be due to loss of viability during nebulisation and sampling. However, despite this variation there is clear tendency for the simulation to follow the same dispersion pattern as found experimentally. In both simulations and experiments there is a tendency for the contaminant to be entrained into the inlet air stream at higher air change rates (Fig. 7) . This pull towards the inlet was also confirmed using smoke tests. It was not possible to take experimental samples directly at the source, although based on interpolation it appears that there is a tendency to overestimate the concentration at this location in the simulations which has previously been noted by Zhang et al. [26] . The experimental deposition of microorganisms on the floor was calculated as a percentage of the total airborne count. This was quantified by extrapolating from the summation of all air samples. The airborne count was not calculated from the nebulizer concentration as the nebulising process can cause a significant loss of viability [41] . The deposited fraction was then found by averaging the number of colonies formed on each of the 24 plates, and multiplying up to assume the same deposition over the whole floor. In the CFD simulations the total number of particles depositing on the floor was found as a fraction of the injected quantity. Deposition values were found by a exporting data for the time and co-ordinates of particles "trapped" on the floor zone. Comparison between experimental and CFD depositions are shown in Table 2 . Once the DRW model was incorporated the values of deposition were of the same order of magnitude as the experimental values. The experimental validations shown here are important as they present controlled experimental conditions designed to directly mimic the CFD model incorporating bioaerosol transport, as opposed to validating simulated bioaerosol transport to tracer gases which is more common. They also consider the pattern of dispersal across the space, indicating areas of higher or lower risk, rather than a total or representative biological count in the room. Since the experiments were carried out using microorganisms there was a large amount of variation in sampled counts between locations. However despite this the simulations gave a reasonable representation of the results. The contour plots (Fig. 7) show clearly the similarities between the model and the experimental results and in particular the tendency for the bioaerosols to be entrained towards the inlet air stream in both cases. The CFD simulation shows a 'safe' zone down the side of the room, with a much lower level of contamination than is shown in the experimental results. This is mainly due to the lower resolution in the experimental data where concentrations were not measured close to the wall. Although the k-3 turbulence model is well validated for use to simulate bulk air flow, this is not the case for particle tracking simulation, and particularly deposition. In fact the assumption of isotropic turbulence has been found to overestimate the deposition of small particles <1 mm in diameter [32] , with results becoming more realistic as inertial forces dominate with large particles. There is a lack of literature presenting experimental data on the deposition of bioaerosols however there have been some attempts to validate the deposition of particles. Leduc and Fredriksson [43] replicated the deposition within a particle sampler and found the RNG turbulence model gave improved results for the deposition of particles <1 mm. However in this study of a full scale room no significant difference was found for the deposition with the two different turbulence models for particles this size. Rui et al. [35] attempted to correlate the simulated deposition of bioaerosols to the transport of bacteria that occurred during a knee surgery. However the level of movement present in the real situation is attributed to lack of correlation between the two scenarios. In the study presented here bioaerosol deposition was measured in a room-size test chamber, under controlled conditions, to ensure the simulations were directly comparable to the experiments. The study considered the overall deposition of a range of particles with a mass median diameter of 2.5 mm and found the results to be comparable between the simulation and experiments, but only when the DRW model was incorporated into the particle tracking model. Since the aim of the zonal source is to simulate average behaviour of a bioaerosol source it may be expected that using simply the effect of the bulk airflow on the particle would provide adequate results. However, without incorporating the DRW model the deposition was significantly underestimated. These results are promising, indicating that simple passive scalar and particle tracking approaches within steady state CFD models may be used to understand the behaviour of bioaerosols. However to understand the effect of turbulence on smaller particles further work is required. The validation also does not consider the pattern of deposition across the space which is important to understand where pathogenic particles may land and cause reservoirs of infection within a ward. However this study provides an important step in validating CFD models to the airborne dispersion and the total deposition of bioaerosols within a room.
