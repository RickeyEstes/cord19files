With the wide action and utilization of the essential oil from Lonicera japonica, different extraction methods have been employed to extract it. In 2009, Du et al. (2009) indicated that with the fresh flowers homogenate method, the main compounds were propylbenzene (12.40%), ethyl benzene (8.58%), benzoic aldehyde (8.04%), translinalool (4.72%) and isophytol (2.94%), but with the steam distillation method, the main components were cyclohexano (8.06%), cyclohexylisooxalic ester (3.45%), methylcyclohexane (12.35%) and n-hexadecanoic acid (12.56%). These suggested that different extraction methods would result in different contents and compositions of essential oils.
