To determine the seroprevalence of HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 in humans, we developed an ELISA protocol for detecting IgG antibodies against HBoV1-4 using VLPs as coating antigens. The concentration of the coated VLPs (0.125 mg/mL) for this ELISA assay was optimized using chessboard titration tests. The positive sera and negative sera showed different results at 1:200 serum dilutions. As the results obtained using lower serum dilutions were similar to those obtained at 1:200 (data not shown), the 1:200 dilution was used in subsequent ELISA analysis of serum samples. To determine the cut-off values for the ELISA, we determined the mean values and standard deviation of negative sera for HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 using HBoV VLP ELISA at dilutions of 1:200. We used the mean absorbance at 450 nm of the negative sera plus threefolds the standard deviation as the cut-off values, as previously described [19, 31] . For HBoV1, 2, 3 and 4, the cut-off values were 0.344, 0.304, 0.321, and 0.31, respectively. A sample was considered positive for HBoV1, 2, 3, or 4 if its absorbance at 450 nm was above the cut-off value of the respective species in ELISA. As there are cross-reactivities between HBoV species in ELISA assay, we developed a cELISA assay to evaluate the seroprevalence of each HBoV species. We evaluated the specificity of this protocol using heterologous competition assays with parvovirus B19 and human parvovirus 4 (PARV4) VP2. Neither human parvovirus B19 nor PARV4 VP2 inhibited the reactivity of IgG against HBoV1, 2, 3, or 4 in the serum from adults or children ( Figure 3 ). These results suggest that there is no antigenic crossreactivity between HBoVs VP2 and human parvovirus B19 VP2 or between HBoVs VP2 and PARV4 VP2. To confirm the specificity of this ELISA protocol, we tested sera from 15 adults that were positive for human parvovirus B19. In the HBoV VLP ELISA, we did not detect false-positive signals for HBoVs (data not shown).
