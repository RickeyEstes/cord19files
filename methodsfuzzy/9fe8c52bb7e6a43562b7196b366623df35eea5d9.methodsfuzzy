All the reagents were commercially available and used without further purification unless indicated otherwise. All solvents were of anhydrous grade unless indicated otherwise. All non-aqueous reactions were carried out in oven-dried glassware under a slight positive pressure of argon unless otherwise noted. Reaction mixtures were magnetically stirred and monitored by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel. Flash chromatography was performed on silica gel of 60-200 lm particle size. Yields are reported for spectroscopically pure compounds. Melting points were recorded on an Electrothermal MEL-TEMP Ã’ 1101D melting point apparatus. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AVANCE 600, 400 and 300 spectrometers. Chemical shifts are given in d values relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS); coupling constants J are given in Hz. Internal standards were CDCl 3 (d H = 7.24) or DMSO-d 6 (d H = 2.49) for 1 H-NMR spectra; CDCl 3 (d C = 77.0) or DMSO-d 6 (d C = 39.5) for 13 C-NMR spectra. The splitting patterns are reported as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), br (broad), and dd (double of doublets). IR spectra were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet 380 FT-IR spectrometer. High resolution ESI mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Daltonics spectrometer.
