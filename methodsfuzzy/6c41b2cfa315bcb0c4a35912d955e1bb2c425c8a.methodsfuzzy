In this study, the chemical composition of the fly ash was determined by X-ray Energy Dispersion Spectroscopy (GENENIS 4000, EDAX Inc., USA). Heavy metals were extracted by an acid mixture of HNO 3 , HClO 4 and HF Vol. 25 (5:2:2, V/V/V) similar to that used by Chan et al. (1996) , then the concentrations were analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) (SOLAAR 969, Thermo, USA). The concentration of PCDDs/Fs in fly ash was measured using HRGC/HRMS (JMS800D, JEOL, Japan) according to US EPA method 1613. Chromatographic separation was carried out on a 60 m DB-5 quartz capillary column (250 μm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness, Agilent, USA). The temperature program for the GC oven was initial temperature 150°C, held for 1 min; 150-190°C at 25°C/min held for 2 min; 190-280°C at 3°C/min held for 20 min. The carrier gas was helium (99.999%) at a 1.2 mL/min flow rate. The temperature of the injector was 280°C. Mass spectrometer conditions were: electron impact ionization, 38 eV; ion source temperature, 280°C; interface temperature, 280°C; selected-ion monitoring mode (SIM). The mass system was tuned to a minimum resolution of 10,000 (10% valley) using perfluorokerosene as lock mass, and the method detection limit of samples ranged between 0.02 and 0.3 pg/g. The leaching ability of heavy metals was evaluated using toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP, USEPA method 1311). Acetic acid solution (pH 2.88 ± 0.05) was used as the leaching liquid. The liquid-to-solid ratio was 20:1 and agitation time was 18 hr with rotary tumbler at (30 ± 2) r/min. After extraction, the leachates were examined by AAS. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to get a better understanding of the microstructure changes after the plasma melting process. Archimedes method was utilized to measure the density of the samples.
