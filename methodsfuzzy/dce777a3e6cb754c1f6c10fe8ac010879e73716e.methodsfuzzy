Reporter assays of Rev activity in DDX1 silenced cells siRNA oligonucleotides 5′-GGCAATTTCCCTGGTGG-CAACAGAA-3′ (si-DDX1-A) and 5′-GGAGTTAGCT-GAACAAACTTTGAA-3′ (si-DDX1-B) and GC-contentmatched control siRNA oligo were purchased from Invitrogen. Silencing of DDX1 was accomplished by two sequential transfections with siRNAs. Initially, HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA (at 20 nM) with RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the cells were cotransfected with siRNAs (at 20 nM) and either pGag-RRE with the RREcontaining fragment of the env gene together with an expression plasmid encoding HIV-1-1 Rev (pRev) or the control plasmid pGag-CTE, in which the RRE was replaced with four copies of the CTE. 31 The second transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h of incubation, the cells were collected for analysis by Western blotting. Knockdown efficiency and Gag expression were evaluated using rabbit anti-DDX1 (Proteinteck Group) and mouse anti-p24 (Chemicon), respectively.
