Cells and viruses. Huh-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Dengue 2 virus (New Guinea C) propagated in C6/36 cells was used throughout this study. Huh-7 cells were infected with DENV at MOI of 0.1. Plasmid construction. Full-length DENV NS4A was cloned into pGBKT7 vector (Clontech) using NdeI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites. The resulting constructs were sequenced to ensure correct reading frames and were subsequently used as bait in yeasttwo-hybrid (Y2H) library screening. The short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (5 0 -AAGGAACTTCCATCATTCCAGAGAACTTGCTTCTTCTCTGGAATGA TGGAAGTTCCTATAGTGA-3 0 ) directed against human PTB mRNA was cloned into psiRNAhH1-GFPzeo vector to generate psiRNA-PTB. Huh-7 cells were transfected with psiRNA-PTB using lipofectamine 2000. Stable transfectants were selected with zeocin (200 lg/ml, Invitrogen) and called PTBKD cells. Huh-7 cells transfected with scrambled shRNA sequence produced scrambledKD cells. Y2H screening. Y2H mating assays were carried out using NS4A as bait and pre-transformed human liver cDNA yeast library (Clontech) as described by the manufacturer. The resulting positive colonies were picked to isolate the library plasmids using Yeast plasmid extraction kit (Clontech) and sequenced for BLAST analysis (GenBank). Co-immunoprecipitaion. Huh-7 cells (5 Â 10 5 ) were infected with DENV. At 24 h post-infection, cell lysate was pre-mixed with 2 lg of anti-DENV NS4A/anti-PTB conjugated magnetic microbeads and purified using lMACs column (Miltenyi Biotec). Samples obtained from co-immunoprecipitation assays or whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting using anti-DENV NS4A (1:400)/anti-PTB (1:400) antibodies. Localization studies. Huh-7 cells were infected with DENV. At 24 h post-infection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X. The anti-NS4A (1:400) or anti-PTB (1:700) antibodies were used as primary antibodies and secondary goat antibodies conjugated to FITC or Texas red (Chemicon) were used. The nuclei were stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes). The specimens were viewed with a laser scanning confocal inverted microscope (Leica TCS SP2). Virus growth kinetics. Huh-7, scrambledKD and PTBKD cells were infected with DENV or transfected with RNA in vitro transcribed from full length infectious clone of DENV. At the indicated timings, culture supernatants were collected for plaque assay. Real-time RT-PCR. Huh-7, scrambledKD and PTBKD cells were infected with DENV. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and subjected to real-time RT-PCR using iTaq TM Supermix (BIO-RAD) with primer sequences targeting NS1 region. The forward primer is 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled 5 0 -CACAACCA TGAAGAGGGCATTTG-FAM-G-3 0 and the reverse primer is unlabeled NS1 reverse primer, 5 0 -TTTGTTTCCACATCAGATTCCCA-3 0 [17] . Reactions were performed using Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system. Standard curve was generated using DENV RNA isolated from known quantity of virus. The amount of total viral RNA from PTBKD or scrambledKD cells was determined relative to that from control Huh-7 cells. Detection of PTB-DENV association. Huh-7, scrambledKD and PTBKD cells were infected with DENV or transfected with biotinylated RNA in vitro transcribed from full length infectious clone of DENV. After 14 h, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and lysed for co-immunoprecipitation or pull down assay using anti-PTB Ab or Streptavidin beads (Invitrogen). Real-time RT-PCR was performed on the RNA isolated from anti-PTB Ab immunoprecipitated sample. The samples obtained from pull down assays were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-PTB and anti-NS4A Ab.
