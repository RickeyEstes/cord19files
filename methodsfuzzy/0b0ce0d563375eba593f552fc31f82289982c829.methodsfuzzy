Nasopharyngeal swabs were placed into 3 ml of universal viral transport media. The specimens were refrigerated at the hospital at 4°C and delivered daily by courier service to the reference laboratory at the University of Arizona, Infectious Disease Research Core. Specimens were tested for viral pathogen targets by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the ResPlex II assay (v. Laboratory results were faxed back to the sites so that physicians could use the surveillance results to understand the epidemiology of circulating respiratory infections. The remaining portion of the specimens was frozen at À80°C and sent on dry ice to the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) in San Diego for testing by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for influenza virus type and subtype, RSV, adenoviruses, and rhinoviruses (starting in 2011) using singleplex PCR on the ABI7500 platform (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). 6, 7 We report influenza, RSV, adenovirus, and rhinovirus results from the NHRC; all other results are from the University of Arizona laboratory. Specimens positive for an enterovirus and a rhinovirus from different laboratories were also reported as rhinovirus/enterovirus.
