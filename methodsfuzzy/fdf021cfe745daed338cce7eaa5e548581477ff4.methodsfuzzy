The mouse inbred strains used in these experiments are the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012) . The founders of the CC include five classical strains, A/J (AJ), C57BL/6J (B6), 129S1/SvImJ (129S1), NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD), NZO/ HlLtJ (NZO), and three wild-derived strains, CAST/EiJ (CAST), PWK/ PhJ (PWK), and WSB/EiJ (WSB). Mice originated from a colony maintained by Gary Churchill at the Jackson Laboratory, and were transferred to the FPMV lab at the University of North Carolina (UNC) in 2008. The original colony also produced most of the G1 breeders that populated the inbred funnels at ORNL, TAU and Geniad (Srivastava et al. 2017) . All mice described here were reared by the FPMV lab at UNC. Mice were bred at the UNC Hillsborough vivarium from 2008-2010 and bred at the UNC Genetic Medicine Building (GMB) vivarium from 2010-2012. A total of 4,448 litters resulting from crosses between 1,478 individual dams and 1,238 individual sires were born from all eight inbred crosses and 54 of 56 reciprocal F1 hybrid crosses, excluding hybrids between NZO·CAST and NZO·PWK, which are known unproductive crosses (Chesler et al. 2008) . The directions of all crosses are described as female by male (i.e., dam.strain · sire.strain), unless otherwise noted. Litter size and sex were determined at weaning by visual inspection. Animals were kept on a 14-hour, 10-hour light/dark schedule with lights turned on at 7:00 AM; temperature was maintained at 20°-24°with relative humidity between 40-50%. Mice were housed in standard 20·30-cm ventilated polysulfone cages with standard laboratory grade Bed-O-Cob bedding. Water and Purina Prolab RMH3000 were available ad libitum. Mouse chow was supplemented with Fenbendazole (Feb 2010) two weeks before and two weeks after transportation to the GMB facility to eliminate possible pinworms. Selamectin treatment was dropped onto the coats of mice before transfer to remove mites from the cages. These treated cages were not opened until after their arrival at UNC GMB. All animal rearing and breeding was conducted in strict compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animals Resources, National Research Council 1996, https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/books/NBK232589/). The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of North Carolina approved all animal use and research described here.
