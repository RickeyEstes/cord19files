To quantitate the effects of agents on cell proliferation1 75 yL of warm growth medium containing S mg/mL MTT was added to each well. and cultures were returned to the incubator and left undisturbed for 90 min. To spectrophotometrically quantitate formation of reduced formazan, plates were centrifuged (9OOg, 5 min), culture fluids were removed by aspiration, and 200,nL of acidified isopropanol(2 mL concentrated HCl/L isopropanol) was added per well. The absorbance of the resulting solutions was measured at 570 nm with a plate reader (MR700 Microplate Reader, Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA). The absorbance of test wells was compared with the absorbance of drug-free wells, and the concentration of agent that resulted in 50% of the absorbance of untreated cultures was determined by linear regression of logit-transformed data [19] . A linear relationship between P388, HL-60, HL-60/AR, HT-29, and A549 cell number and formazan production was found over the range of cell densities observed in this study. Antitumor eficacy. Compounds were dissolved in 95% ethanol, diluted in sterile 0.9% NaCI, and injected i.p. in a total volume of 0.5 mL. The efficacy of agents was expressed as the median life span of treated mice normalized as a percentage of the life span of untreated tumor-bearing mice (%T/C). The P388 lymphocytic leukemia and B16 melanoma tumor were obtained and passaged as described previously [ 161. Intraperitoneal P388 tumors were inoculated as ascites ( lo6 cells/O. 1 mL) 1 day prior to treatment, into male CD2Fl mice (Charles River, Raleigh, NC), six per group, and compounds were administered daily for 5 days (QDl-5). Time to death (mean rcr: SD, N = 18) for untreated mice was 10.2 +-1.0 days. Fluorouracil (40mg/kg; QDl-9. i.p., N = 6) administration resulted in a %T/C of 230. B16 melanoma was established by i.p. injection of 0.5 mL of a 10% tumor brei into groups of ten female B6D2Fl (Charles River) mice 1 day before therapy began. Mean time to death (*SD. N = 20) for tumor-bearing animals was 17.5 ? 2.5 days. and i.p. cis-platinum(II)diamine dichloride administration (1 mg/kg, QDl-9. N = 10) resulted in a ?/cT/ C of 156. To assess the antiproliferative effects of agents against P388, HL-60 and HL-60/AR cells, 2OOpL cultures (96-well tissue culture plates, Nunc, Denmark) were established at 1 X lo5 cells/ml in drug-free medium or medium containing agents at various concentrations. After 48-hr exposures, P388 cells were enumerated using MIT (3-14,5-dimethyithiazoi-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) as described below 1183. After 72-hr exposures, HL-60 and HL-60/AR cells were also enumerated with MTT. To assess the antiproliferative effect of agents against HT-29 and A549 cells, 200 nL cultures were initiated with 4 X lo3 cells/cm* of culture area in 96-well tissue culture plates. After 24 hr, 100 ,nL of the culture fluids was removed and replaced with fresh drug-free growth or medium containing the agent to be tested at twice the Incorporation studies. The effects of topsentin on the apparent rates of protein, RNA, and DNA synthesis were assessed by measuring cellular incorporation of tritiated leucine, uridine, and thymidine from culture fluids. P388 cultures were established in 20-mL plastic viafs (2 x IO5 cells/ml. 10mL cultures), gassed with 5% CO? in air. and incubated at 37" for 30 min in a shaking waterbath. To initiate incorporations, lo(fpL of PBS (pH 7.0, 0.8% NaCl, 0.22% NalHPOJ.7HZ0, 0.02% KH2P04, 0.02% KCI, w/w) containing [H]leutine (200 #Zi/mL), ["Hluridine (100 nCi/mL) or [3H]thymidine (lOOnCi/mL) was added. At S-min intervals, 1 mL of the cell suspension was removed and diluted with 10mL of PBS containing the appropriate unlabeled precursor at 100 PM. Cells were collected on O.itS,um nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by vacuum filtration. and macromolecules precipitated by the addition of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. Filters were extracted three times with 5 mL of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, washed with 5 mL of water, and rinsed with 5 mL of 70% ethanol. Filters were transferred to 20-mL scintillation vials and 12 mL of scintillation fluor (Aquasol, NEN Research Products, Boston, MA) was added per vial. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Quenching was similar in all samples as determined by the ratio of counts in a narrow tritium channel and a wide 14C channel. Tritiated compounds were obtained from NEN Research Products, and were the highest specific activity available. DNA binding studies. The fluorescence spectral characteristics of topsentin in the absence or presence of 1 mg/mL DNA were measured with an LS-50 fluorescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT). Fluorescence spectra reported are uncorrected. The effects of topsentin on the binding of ethidium bromide to DNA were assessed by measuring the increase in ethidium fluorescence as DNA was added to the cuvette. Volumes of a calf thymus DNA solution (2 mg/mL) were added to solutions of ethidium bromide (1 PM) in the absence or presence of topsentin (100 PM). Slit widths were 10 nm for all experiments, and excitation and emission wavelengths were as indicated in the text. The total increase in volume due to the addition of DNA was less than 7% and increases in fluorescence were not corrected for volume changes. The effects of topsentin (100pM) on the binding of Hoechst 33342 (1 PM) were determined as described for ethidium bromide, except that the excitation wavelength was 310 nm and increases in emission were monitored at 512 nm (IO-nm slit widths). The effects of CC-1065 on topsentin binding to DNA were assessed by adding DNA (final concentration of 1 mg/mL) to solutions of topsentin (100 ,uM) in the absence or presence of various concentrations of CC-1065. The relative amounts of topsentin bound to DNA were assessed by fluorescence spectral changes (excitation = 401 nm, emission = 512 nm, slit widths = 10 nm). CC-1065 was dissolved in DMSO and solvent controls were included in all experiments. DNA unwinding. The ability of topsentin to unwind supercoiled closed circular DNA was determined as previously described [20] . Reaction mixtures (2OpL total volume) containing 50mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, 120mM KCl, 0.5mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgClz, 50 pg/mL BSA, and 0.2pg ColEl DNA were incubated with various amounts of topsentin or ethidium bromide for 1 hr. DNA topoisomerase I (5 units of calf thymidine enzyme, Bethesda Research Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) was added and the mixture was incubated at 30" for 30 min before the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2pL of 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate. DNA was extracted with phenol, and supercoiled and relaxed forms of DNA were separated by electrophoreses in a 1% horizontal agarose gel. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV illumination. Experimental agents. Topsentin (~95% pure) used for this study was obtained from a deep water marine sponge, Spongosorites sp., as previously described Halichondriidae. [21] . The purity of topsentin (Rf= 0.75) was assessed by analytical reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography (MKC-18F RP plates, 200 nm, Whatman, Clifton, NJ) with 20% aqueous methanol as the development system. CC-1065 was the gift of Dr. .l. P. McGovern, The Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI. All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources.
