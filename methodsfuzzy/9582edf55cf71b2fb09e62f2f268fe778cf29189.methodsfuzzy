Preparation of SUD-N, SUD-NM, SUD-MC, and SUD-C The DNA sequence encoding nsp3 residues 1-723 obtained as a synthetic gene from DNA 2.0 (Menlo Park, CA) was codon optimized for expression in E. coli. All four constructs (Fig. S3) were cloned from this starting sequence into pET-28b. SUD-N and SUD-NM consisting of nsp3 residues 387-524 and 387-651, respectively, were cloned with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site, and SUD-MC consisting of residues 527-720 was cloned with a thrombin cleavage site after an N-terminal 6× His tag. For SUD-C, the highest expression levels were obtained for a construct with a long linker to the 6× His tag, containing both a thrombin and a TEV protease cleavage site. The four constructs were expressed in E. coli strains BL21(DE3)-RIL (SUD-N and SUD-NM), Rosetta(DE3) (SUD-MC), and BL21(DE3) (SUD-C). To produce uniformly 15 N-labeled or 13 C, 15 N-labeled protein, we grew cultures in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/L 15 NH 4 Cl as the sole nitrogen source and 4 g/L of either unlabeled glucose or [ 13 C 6 ]D-glucose as the sole carbon source. For SUD-N, SUD-NM, and SUD-MC, the cell cultures were grown at 37°C with shaking to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.8. The temperature was then lowered to 18°C, expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cultures were grown for a further 18 h. For SUD-C, the cultures were grown for 28 h after induction with 1 mM isopropylβ-D-thiogalactopyranoside at 18°C. The proteins were extracted from frozen cell pellets by sonication in lysis buffer (Table 2) . After centrifugation to remove cell debris, the supernatants were applied to a 5ml HisTrap Crude column (GE) equilibrated with buffer A ( Table 2 ). The bound proteins were eluted with a gradient to 500 mM imidazole, concentrated, and diluted into cleavage buffer. The 6× His tag was removed with agaroselinked thrombin (Thrombin CleanCleave kit; Sigma) or TEV protease using the following different conditions and buffers (Table 2) for the individual proteins. For SUD-N, tag cleavage was performed overnight at room temperature after addition of 1 ml of 0.69 mg/ml TEV protease solution per 10 ml of protein solution. The solution was applied to a HisTrap column equilibrated with buffer A ( Table 2 ). After elution in the flow-through, the protein was chromatographed on a size-exclusion column (Superdex 75 26/60; GE) equilibrated with 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (NaP i ; pH 6.6) containing 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT. The yield was about 10 mg of pure protein from 500 ml of culture. The final product contained an N-terminal GHM tripeptide segment from the expression tag. For preparation of the NMR sample, the solution was concentrated to 500 μl using Amicon UltraFree centrifugal devices with a 3-kDa molecular mass cutoff (Millipore), and 50 μl of D 2 O and NaN 3 to a concentration of 2 mM were added. The protein concentration was adjusted to 0.8 mM, since higher concentrations led to precipitation. For SUD-NM, the same procedure was used as for SUD-N, except that the final NMR sample contained 4 mM DTT, and the molecular mass cutoff of the centrifugal device was 10 kDa. The yield was about 20 mg of pure protein from 1 L of culture, and the protein concentration in the NMR sample was adjusted to 1.0 mM. For SUD-MC, tag cleavage was performed overnight at room temperature with thrombin. For size-exclusion chromatography, we used 25 mM NaP i (pH 6.8) with 150 mM NaCl. The N-terminal residual tag-related sequence was GSHM. The yield was about 15 mg of pure protein from 1 L of culture, and the protein concentration in the NMR sample was adjusted to 1.0 mM. For SUD-C, the proteins eluting from the first HisTrap column were concentrated 35-fold, then diluted 10-fold with cleavage buffer (Table 2 ). Four milliliters of TEV protease solution were added, and the reaction was incubated at 37°C for 2 days. The resulting solution was chromatographed on a HisTrap column, and the protein eluted in the flowthrough. SUD-C was then applied to a HiTrap Q FF column in 20 mM NaP i (pH 7.0) and eluted with a 0-1 M NaCl gradient. The protein did not bind to this column, but was isolated from a nucleic acid fraction with which it had previously copurified. The yield was about 3 mg of purified protein from 1 L of culture, which contained an N-terminal G from the expression tag. A 330-μl NMR sample with 1.2 mM SUD-C in NMR buffer (Table 2) containing 7.5% D 2 O was obtained.
