The study was performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) at King Abdul-Aziz Medical City, Riyadh, during a MERS-CoV outbreak from September 1-October 5, 2015. The ICU had strict environmental cleaning policies, which included cleaning the rooms at least twice daily using ammonium-based disinfectant and chlorine solution 1:10 or 5,000 ppm, having a checklist, and frequent inspection using fluorescent light or culturing of high-touch areas. Three negative-pressure rooms of laboratory-confirmed MERS patients (A, B, and C) were selected for this study ( Table 1) . The room temperature was 20.0°C-25.0°C, and RH was 30%-40%. The air exchange rate was 12 per hour, and the pressure gradient between the room and its anteroom ranged from 2.5-12.5 Pa. Sixteen high-touch surfaces were evaluated (Table 2) : 14 in the patients' room (bedrails, mechanical ventilator, ventilator tubing, sink, garbage bin, monitor, intravenous poles, intravenous pumps, telephone, door knobs, floor, drapes-blinds, air conditioning vent, and shelf of the surgical boom) and 2 outside (computer and medical chart). Environmental samples were collected as described by Julian et al. 5 Briefly, a sterile swab premoistened with viral transport media was used to swab each surface (at least 10 cm 2 ) horizontally, vertically, and diagonally for 30 seconds. This procedure was repeated using eluents: 1/4 lactated ringer solution and phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Virus detection was performed using specific real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the upstream of the envelope gene and the open reading frame 1A. Positive tests were reported as the cycle threshold value for both upstream of the envelope gene (E) and open reading (O) frame 1A.
