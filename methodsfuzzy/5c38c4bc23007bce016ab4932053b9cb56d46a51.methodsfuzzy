About 0.2 gram of stool sample was taken into a 1.5 mL tube, and 1 mL of 0.8% NaCl was added. The tube was vortexed to suspend the stool sample thoroughly and then was centrifuged for 3 min at 5 000 r/min. About 140 pL of the supernatant was collected to extract viral RNA with an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). The RNA was dissolved in 100 pL diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water containing 1 U DNase I (Promega). cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription from 10 pL RNA at 45Â°C
