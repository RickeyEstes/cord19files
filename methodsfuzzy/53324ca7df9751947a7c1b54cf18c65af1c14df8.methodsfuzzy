Ethics statement. Long bones (femur and humerus) and organs were obtained from big brown bats submit- Nucleic acid extraction, PCR and qRT-PCR. All RNA extractions were performed using the RNeasy Plus Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) as per manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was prepared using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (QIAGEN) as per manufacturer's instructions. One μg of RNA was used for cDNA preparation. cDNA was used as a template for the quantification of target genes. DNA extraction from MRC5 and Efk3 cells was performed using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (QIAGEN) as per manufacturer's instructions. Conventional PCR was performed to amplify human or big brown bat TNFα promoters, big brown bat c-Rel coding sequence (CDS) and cDNA from c-Rel transcripts in big brown bat organs using specific primers. Primers with restriction sites were used to clone the TNFα promoters and c-Rel CDS (Table 1) . Primers without restriction sites were designed to detect c-Rel transcripts in big brown bat organs (see Supplementary Table S4 ). Human TNFα promoter sequence was obtained from NCBI (Accession number: AB048818) and amplified by PCR from DNA extracted from MRC5 cells. The big brown bat TNFα promoter was defined as a sequence up to 1200 bp upstream of the TNFα gene (sequence submitted; GenBank accession: BK009991) and amplified by PCR from DNA extracted from Efk3 cells. Big brown bat c-Rel sequence was obtained from NCBI (Accession number: XM_008162099.1). PCR was performed using the following thermal cycle profile: initial denaturation for 3 min at 94 °C, 35 PCR cycles at 94 °C/30 s, 55 °C/30 s and 72 °C/1 min. The final extension was at 72 °C for 10 min. For the quantification of innate immune response genes, qRT-PCR assays targeting respective gene transcripts (see Supplementary Table S4 ) and the normalizer (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; GAPDH) were performed for both MRC5 and Efk3 cells. Agilent's MX3005P PCR cycler was used in conjunction with Quantifast SYBR Green PCR kit (QIAGEN) and samples were prepared as previously mentioned 57 . Primers for Efk3 cells were designed using the annotated big brown bat genome (Accession No. PRJNA72449). Primer sequences for MRC5 cells were obtained from PrimerBank 58, 59 or nucleotide database on National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). When primer sequences were not available for MRC5 or genes not annotated for big brown bat, multiple sequence alignment was performed with other mammalian homologues and primers were designed against conserved regions. One of the cytokines, IL8, is not annotated in the big brown bat genome. Primers for IL8 were designed using the annotated Myotis lucifugus genome. The products were quantified based on the amount of relative gene expression. All amplified products were confirmed on a gel and sequenced (Macrogen). Reaction efficiencies for qRT-PCR primers were between 95 and 105%. For qRT-PCR, after the initial denaturation step of 95 °C for 5 minutes, two step cycling for 40 cycles was performed at 95 °C/10 s, (51-56) °C/30 s. Absorbance readings were acquired after each cycle. The final three steps were carried out at 95 °C/1 min, 55 °C/30 s and 95 °C/30 s to generate the dissociation curve. Absorbance readings for the dissociation curve were acquired at every degree from 55-95 °C. The annealing temperatures were optimized for different groups of genes (see Supplementary Table S4 ). Relative fold change in gene expression between the two groups of cells (treated and mock treated) was calculated after normalizing the Ct values using GAPDH. Three housekeeping genes were tested (GAPDH, β-actin and β-2-microglobulin) for MRC5 and two for Efk3 cells (GAPDH and β-actin). There was no variation in Ct values for the housekeeping genes between treated and mock treated samples. Thus GAPDH was chosen for normalizing the data. Difference of one Ct indicates a two-fold difference in gene expression. qRT-PCR for quantifying immunoprecipitated DNA after the ChIP assay was performed using primers (Table 1) designed to amplify a region spanning the putative c-Rel binding site of approximately 480 bp for the bat promoter and 410 bp for the human promoter (±the putative c-Rel binding motif). The reaction conditions were as described above. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis. One percent agarose (Invitrogen, USA) gels were prepared using 0.5X TBE [Tris -1 M (VWR), Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA) solution -0.02 M (Gibco) and Boric acid -1 M; pH 8.4]. One ul SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen) was added for every 1 ml of gel. Ten μl of PCR or qRTPCR products were run on the gel for 1 h at 105 volts and visualized under an ultraviolet gel imaging system (AlphaImager HP). Cloning TNFα promoter and c-Rel. Human TNFα promoter sequence was amplified by PCR from DNA extracted from MRC5 cells and cloned in pCAT3 vector (Promega) upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene using restriction sites KpnI and XhoI. The big brown bat TNFα promoter was amplified by PCR using DNA extracted from Efk3 cells and cloned upstream of the CAT gene in a pCAT3 vector using restriction sites MluI and XhoI. Big brown bat c-Rel coding sequence (CDS) was amplified from cDNA prepared from RNA extracted from Efk3 cells and cloned in-phase downstream of a Hemagglutinin (HA) tag in pCMV-HA-N vector (Clontech) using restriction sites SalI and NotI. Generating TNFα promoter mutants. Mutant big brown bat and human TNFα promoters were generated by removing or adding the c-Rel binding site. Agilent's QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit was used as per a modification of the manufacturer's protocol suggested by Wang and Malcolm 60 . For the bat mutant promoter, two primers (IDT) were designed to loop out the c-Rel binding site, BBB M1 -F -GCTTCATACAAAAACTGCCTTTGGATCCAAG and BBB M1 -R -CTTGGATCCAAAGGCAGTTTTTGTATGAAGC. The primers were used to amplify wild-type big brown bat TNFα promoter. For the human mutant promoter, primers were designed containing the putative bat c-Rel binding motif: Hu-M1-F-GAATGGGTTACAGGAGGGGCTTCGGATCCTCTGGGGAGATG and Hu-M1-R-CATCTCCCCAGAGGATCCGAAGCCCCTCCTGTAACCCATTC. The primers were used to amplify wild-type human TNFα promoter. Deletion and addition of the c-Rel binding site were confirmed by sequencing (Macrogen).
