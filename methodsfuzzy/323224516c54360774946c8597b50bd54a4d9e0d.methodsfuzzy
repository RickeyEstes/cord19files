Plasmids. Viral RNA was extracted from collected VSV (Indiana serotype, a gift from Dr. Michael A. Whitt, University of Tennessee) culture supernatant by Qiagen QIAamp RNA mini kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Five fragments of VSV genome were generated by RT-PCR and assembled into a full-length cDNA. The pBluescript SK (+) (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) was modified by inserting T7 terminator from pET-28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) between XbaI/SacI sites and was named as SK-Ter. The full-length cDNA of VSV was inserted between the T7 promoter and ribozyme sequence of hepatitis delta virus in SK-Ter [24, 25] . Two complementary oligonucleotides containing the transcript stop/start sequences and a XhoI site were cloned into NheI site between G and L genes [26] . The resulting plasmid was designated as pVSV. The plasmids named pSK-N, pSK-P, and pSK-L were constructed by cloning N, P, and L genes into pSK-Ter at XhoI/XbaI sites [27] . The HIV-1 HXB2 gp120 gene was modified so that the signal peptide of TPA from pJW4304 (a gift from Prof. James Mullins at University of Washington School of Medicine) was used to substitute the signal peptide of HIV-1 HXB2 gp120 and the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail of VSV-glycoprotein (VSV-G) were added to the C terminus of HIV-1 HXB2 gp120. The fusion gene encoding HIV-1 HXB2 gp120 aa 32-505 was then cloned into pVSV plasmid using XhoI and NheI sites. The resulting plasmid was designated as pVSV-HXB2. Meanwhile, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and luciferase gene were also cloned into pVSV, respectively (designated as pVSV-eGFP and pVSV-luc). Recovery of recombinant VSV. BHK-21 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in DulbeccoÕs modified EagleÕs medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Nearly confluent cells (90% confluence) were infected with vTF7-3 (a gift from Prof. Bernard Moss at NIAID, NIH), a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was 10. Sixty minutes after infection, the cells were transfected with 4 lg each of pVSV-N and pVSV-P and 2 lg pVSV-L, and 10 lg pVSV-HXB2, pVSV-eGFP, pVSV-luc or pVSVFL(+) using a Lipofectamine 2000 transfection kit according to the manufacturerÕs instruction (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The cells were incubated at a 37°C, 5% CO 2 incubator for 48 h, and the cells on culture dishes were frozen/thawed three times. The supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 2000g for 10 min and debris was removed by passing through a 0.2 lm filter. The supernatants were added to fresh BHK-21 cells at a ratio of 5 ml per 10 cm dish and incubated with the cells for 48 h. One milliliter of each supernatant was collected from these cells and added to another plate of fresh BHK-21 cells. Recovery of recombinant infectious VSVs was performed 48 h later and confirmed by development of cytopathic effect (CPE) in BHK-21 cells. The recombinant VSVs were propagated in BHK-21 cells and stored at À80°C. The titers of the recombinant VSVs were determined to be 10 8 -10 9 pfu/ml using a standard plaque assay. The recombinant VSV-luc was determined by luciferase activity in infected BHK-21 cells on 24-well plates. Recombinant VSV-eGFP was determined for GFP expression under a fluorescence microscope. Western blot. Recombinant VSV-HXB2 gp120 and VSV-eGFP were used to infect BHK-21 cells at a MOI of 10. After 10-12 h, the cells exhibited visible CPE, but still attached to the plates. Cells were gently rinsed with PBS and then lysed in 100 ll of 1· SDS loading buffer. Proteins were electrophoretically separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ). The membrane was blocked in 5% milk in TTBS (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20) at 37°C for 1 h and with 1:500 sheep anti-HIV-1 gp160 antiserum (obtained from the National Institute of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagents Program) at 4°C overnight, and then probed with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. The proteins on the membrane were visualized using the BCIP/NBT solution (Promega, Madison, WI). Flow Cytometry. Wild-type VSVs and recombinant VSV-HXB2 were used to infect BHK cells. When the cells began to show CPE, occurring 8-10 h post-infection, the cells were collected, washed with PBS, and stained with human anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies b12, 2G12, 17b, and 48d (obtained from the National Institute of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagents Program) on ice for 1 h and then with FITCconjugated goat anti-human IgG (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA). An unrelated human IgG (a gift from Dr. Johnny He of Indiana University) was included as an immunostaining control. The cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer (DakoCytomation, Fortcollins, CO). Mouse immunization. Female BALB/c mice were housed in the Animal Center of Peking University School of Medicine and used under a protocol approved by an Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. All animals were kept in filter-isolette cages in a BL-2 animal facility of Peking University School of Medicine. Five-to six-week-old mice were intranasally immunized with 20 ll (10 6 pfu) VSV-HXB2 diluted in DMEM. VSV-eGFP was used as immunization control, DMEM alone was used as mock. There were three groups in total and each group had 5-7 mice. Serum preparation. Blood samples were collected at 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 weeks following immunization and allowed to clot at 4°C overnight. Clots were removed by centrifugation at 10,000g for 10 min. The sera were then transferred to sterilized Eppendorf tubes and heat-inactivated at 56°C for 60 min. All sera were stored at 4°C. Detection of anti-HIV-1 antibodies in the sera. The production of antibodies against HIV-1 envelope was detected by the binding ability of the mice sera to 293T cells transiently expressing HIV-1 HXB2 envelope gene. Twenty microgram of pSV7d-HXB2 was transferred (obtained from the National Institute of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagents Program) into a 10 cm dish of 293T cells by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection. After 24 h, the cells were collected and washed twice with PBS. Expression of HIV-1 envelope was determined by staining with b12 and 2F5 antibodies using FACS analysis, the normal human IgG with the same concentration used as a control. Mice sera were analyzed by FACS, the pre-immune sera used as the negative control. Anti-HIV-1 neutralization assay. The seraÕs neutralizing activity was determined by incubating the pseudotyped HIV-1 viruses with the sera and monitoring the inhibition of the infectivity of these pseudotyped viruses, as described [28] . Briefly, HIV-1 luciferase reporter viruses (pNL4-3.Luc.R À E À ) pseudotyped with HIV-1 HXB2, JRFL envelope protein were incubated with the sera at dilutions of 1:30, 1:60, and 1:120 at 37°C for 1 h and then used to infect U87-CD4-CCR5 (JRFL) and U87-CD4 _ CXCR4 (HXB2) cells on the microplate wells (96-well flat bottom). HIV-1 pseudotyped luciferase reporter viruses without anti-serum treatment were included as controls. HIV-1-infected cells were allowed to incubate for 2 more days and then lysed. The luciferase activity was assayed using a Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madision, WI) and a Wallac Microbetta 1420 Counter (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA). The neutralizing activity of the mouse sera against SARS-CoV was used as a control for the serum specificity using a similar assay [29] . In addition, each immune serum sample was compared to the serum of given mice before immunization to test nonspecific neutralization activity. Each neutralizing experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated at least twice. The neutralizing ability of the sera from each group was calculated by subtracting the mean luminescence in cells infected with HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses with serum treatment from that in cells infected with HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses without serum treatment and expressed as a fraction of that in cells infected with HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses without sera treatment. As the negative control, the reactivity of the immunized sera with SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus expressed by the infected rate; this was calculated by the mean luminescence of cells infected by SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus treated with immunized sera divided by the mean luminescence of cells infected by SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus without sera treatment.
