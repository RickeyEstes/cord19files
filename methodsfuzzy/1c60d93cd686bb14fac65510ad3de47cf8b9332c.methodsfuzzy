Chemical reagents were obtained from Aldrich Chemical (St. Louis, MO, USA), Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium), abcr GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany), acbblocks (Toronto, Canada), and Chembridge (San Diego, CA) and used without further purification. HCV-SGR plasmids. Plasmids H77/SG-Feo, S52/SG-Feo, and SA1/SG-Feo, which contain a firefly luciferase reporter gene and a genotype 1a, 3a, or 5a HCV subgenome, respectively, were kindly provided by Charles M. Rice (Rockefeller University, New York, NY) (33, 34) . Plasmid p1071-NS5A(Ni)-S2204I contains a firefly luciferase reporter gene and a genotype 1b HCV subgenome (Con1 strain) with an NS5A cassette from the genotype 1b HCV-N strain (35) . Plasmids APP76-Con1-SG-Neo-(I)-hRluc2aUb and APP40-J6/JFH1EMCVIRES-aRlucNeo, which contain a Renilla luciferase reporter gene and genotype 1b and 2a HCV subgenomes, respectively, were purchased from Apath LLC (New York, NY, USA). Plasmid I389-Neo/NS3-3=/5.1, which contains the neomycin resistance gene and an HCV genotype 1b subgenome, was used for resistance selection experiments and was kindly provided by Ralf Bartenschlager (University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany) (36) . Plasmid DBN3acc, which contains a full-length HCV genotype 3a genome, was kindly provided by Jens Bukh (University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark) (19) . Finally, chimeric plasmid fdRocco-chimeric2a/4aNS5A, consisting of a genotype 4a NS5A sequence inserted into a genotype 2a HCV subgenome from APP40-J6/JFH1EMCVIRES-aRlucNeo, was developed in our laboratory. Cell cultures. Human hepatoma Huh7 cells (kindly provided by Eliane Meurs) and Huh7.5 cells (Apath LLC) were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 g/ml amphotericin B (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Assessment of antiviral activity in HCV-SGR models. For transient HCV-SGR models, plasmids p1071-NS5A(Ni)-S2204I, APP40-J6/JFH1EMCVIRES-aRlucNeo, and fdRocco-chimeric2a/4aNS5A were linearized with XhoI, XbaI, and XbaI, respectively (FastDigest; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and in vitro transcribed by using a MEGAscript T7 transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Next, approximately 1.5 ϫ 10 4 Huh7.5 cells were transfected with 250 ng of HCV-SGR RNA using the trans-IT mRNA transfection kit (Mirus Bio LLC, Madison, WI, USA). Four hours after transfection, compounds were added to the culture medium. Luciferase activity was monitored at 96, 48, and 72 h posttransfection for genotype 1b, genotype 2a, and chimeric genotype 2a/4a HCV-SGRs, respectively. Huh7.5 cells stably harboring genotype 1a, 3a, and 5a HCV-SGRs were cultured in the presence of the compounds for 48 h before luciferase activity measurement. Plots were fitted with a four-parameter logistic curve with SigmaPlot v11 software (Systat Software, Inc.), and the EC 50 s were determined from the curves. Assessment of antiviral activity in the infectious HCV model. Huh7.5 cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 ϫ 10 4 cells and incubated 24 h before infection with 250 l of cell-culture-derived infectious HCV (HCVcc) (J6/JFH1 strain, genotype 2a/2a) in the presence of increasing concentrations of the compounds. Eight hours after infection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with fresh medium containing the inhibitors for 72 h. The luciferase activity was then measured and plotted against compound concentrations. The EC 50s were determined from curves fitted with a four-parameter logistic equation. Assessment of the combination of compound 31 and ledipasvir. Huh7.5 cells stably harboring a genotype 1a HCV-SGR were cultured in the presence of 10 pM LDV, 2.5 M C31, or both drugs at the same concentrations, in the absence or presence of 500 g/ml of G418. After 5 passages, the remaining living cells were stained with crystal violet. Selection of clones resistant to compound 31. Huh7.5 cells stably harboring a genotype 1b HCV-SGR replicon that confers cell resistance to G418 were used for selection experiments. The cells were cultured in the presence of escalating doses of C31 (1 to 50 M) and of 1.5 mg/ml of G418 until colonies growing in the presence of C31 appeared. Two resistant colonies were isolated after several passages, and total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and reverse transcribed with a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The NS5A-coding region was amplified at baseline and in the resistant colonies by PCR using forward oligonucleotides 5=-GTG CAG TGG ATG AAY CGG CTG ATA GC-3=, 5=-TTC CAR GAC TCT ARC ART G-3=, 5=-ACT ATG TGC CTG AGA GCG ACG-3=, and 5=-GGR TTG TAR TCC GGS CGY GCC CAT A-3= and reverse oligonucleotides 5=-TCC CRT GYG AGC CYG AAC CG-3=, 5=-GTG GTG ACG CAG CAA AGA GT-3=, 5=-CCC ACA TTA CAG CAG AGA CGG C-3=, and 5=-TTG ATG GGC AGC TTG GT-3=. Phenotypic characterization of amino acid substitutions selected by compound 31. Candidate resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) were introduced into a wild-type genotype 1b HCV-SGR containing the luciferase reporter gene by means of site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Ninety-six hours after RNA transfection, the susceptibility of the RAS-containing HCV-SGR to compound 31 was determined by measurement of luciferase activity and comparison to wild-type HCV-SGR susceptibility. The replication capacity of the RAS-containing HCV-SGR was assessed by comparing luciferase activities at 4 h and 96 h posttransfection and expressed as a percentage of the wild-type replication capacity. Phenotypic characterization of amino acid substitutions selected by ledipasvir. The L31V and Y93H RASs, which confer high-level resistance to LDV (37) , were introduced into the NS5A-coding region of the APP76-Con1-SG-Neo-(I)-hRluc2aUb plasmid by means of site-directed mutagenesis. After linearization with ScaI and in vitro transcription, the genotype 1b HCV-SGR was transfected into Huh7.5 cells. The cells were cultured in the presence of the compounds for 84 h, and luciferase activity was measured. The susceptibility of HCV-SGR(L31V/Y93H) to C31, ALV, and LDV was then compared to that of the wild-type HCV-SGR. Competitive binding assay. A 96-well-plate-based TR-FRET (time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer) assay (Selcia, Ongar, UK) was used to determine competitive CypA binding of C31 and CsA. Briefly, CypA was tagged with a polyhistidine sequence (6His) and formed a complex with an anti-6His antibody labeled with a fluorescent donor, F(d), while CsA was tagged with a fluorescent acceptor, F(a). C31 was added to the master mix containing the CypA-antibody-CsA complex, with a final concentration of detergent of 0.01%. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the plate was read on a SpectraMax M5 instrument (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at 2 wavelengths to detect F(d) and F(a) emissions. The F(a)/F(d) ratio was calculated, and the values were plotted against the inhibitor concentration in log 10 molar and fitted by using one-site Ki nonlinear regression to determine the K d . Nonlabeled CsA and ALV were used as controls. Protein-protein interaction assay. An NS5A-Rluc-CypA-6His in vitro interaction assay was developed to measure the efficiency of CypI disruption of the NS5A-CypA interaction by luminescence measurement. After PCR amplification with primers 5=-AAA AAC TGC AGA TGT CCG GCT CGT GGC T-3= and 5=-AAA AAC CGC GGG CAG CAG ACG ACG TCC-3= and digestion with PstI and SacII (FastDigest; Thermo Fischer Scientific), the genotype 1b NS5A-coding sequence was cloned in fusion with the Renilla luciferase into a pRluc-N3(h) plasmid (catalogue number 6310009; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). NS5A-D320E was generated by site-directed mutagenesis with oligonucleotides 5=-ATG GGC ACG CCC GGA ATA CAA CCC TCC ACT G-3= and 5=-CAG TGG AGG GTT GTA TTC CGG GCG TGC CCA T-3= and cloned similarly to WT-NS5A. Huh7.5 cells were then transfected with the pRluc-N-NS5A plasmid. Forty-eight hours later, cells were lysed with 4 thaw-freeze cycles and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 500 g of Ni-NTA magnetic beads preloaded with 30 g of purified CypA in equilibration buffer (10 mM imidazole and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS). Increasing concentrations of CypI were added during incubation. The beads were then washed 3 times with washing buffer (20 mM imidazole and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS), and elution was performed with 400 mM imidazole for 15 min at room temperature. Renilla luciferase activity in eluates was measured with a Renilla luciferase assay system (Promega). Results are presented as means Ϯ standard deviations (SD) of data from at least three independent experiments. All analyses were two sided and considered significant when the P value was Ͻ0.05. Molecular modeling and docking of C31 into CypA. Molecular modeling and docking experiments were performed by using the @TOME-2 server (38) , which integrates an original interface for comparative docking of small molecules detected in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) file of each template. The search for homologous sequences and alignments was performed by using the @TOME-2 server and the CypD sequence (NCBI accession number P30405), with a 75% identity. In each structural model, the active-site boundaries were deduced from the vicinity of the cocrystallized ligands (compound 32 [C32], C34, C35, and C36 were selected as the templates, with the PDB accession numbers 4J59, 4J5C, 4J5B, and 4J5E, respectively) by using the @TOME-2 comparative option. In addition, the same chemical entities were used to define a shape restraint to guide docking in the automatically computed models. The files for the ligands were generated with MarvinSketch 6.2.2 for SMILES and with the Frog2 server for mol2 (39) . Figure 1A For DENV and YFV experiments, total RNA was extracted from cell cultures with the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with RevertAid H Minus Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) reverse transcriptase. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a real-time PCR system (QuantStudio 6 Flex; Applied Biosystems) with SYBR green PCR master mix (Life Technologies). The data were analyzed with the 2 ϪΔΔCT method, with values for all samples normalized to the value for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). All experiments were performed in triplicate. Genome-equivalent concentrations were determined by extrapolation from a standard curve generated from serial dilutions of the plasmid encoding a subgenomic YFV replicon.

The sequences of the pan-DENV primers are as follows: 5=-TTGAG TAAACYRTGCTGCCTGTAGCTC (sense) and 5=-GAGACAGCAGGATCTCTGGTCTYTC (antisense). For ZIKV experiments, total RNA was extracted from cell cultures with the SV96 total RNA isolation system (Promega). Reverse transcription was performed with the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems 7300 system) with TaqMan gene expression master mix (Applied Biosystems), and the data were normalized to the value for GAPDH. The sequences of the primers used are as follows: 5=-ATATCGGACATGGCTTCGGA (sense) and 5=-GTTCTTTTGCAGACATATTGAGTG (antisense).
