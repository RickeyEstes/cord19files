This study involved a prospective cohort of 77 infants seeking medical attention on business days between 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM at the Emergency Unit of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Sã o Paulo, Brazil, between March 1, 2006, and July 30, 2007 . The Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein is a private institution that mostly treats people of a high socioeconomic status. To be included in the study, patients had to be under two years of age and have exhibited symptoms of acute bronchiolitis for no longer than five days. Parents' agreement (informed consent) was also required. Bronchiolitis was defined as the first episode of wheezing associated with signs of an upper respiratory tract infection. Patients with previous wheezing episodes or previous use of betaagonists were excluded. A structured questionnaire was given to parents or caregivers to obtain information regarding atopy in the family (i.e., asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis), day care attendance, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke or pets, existence of siblings, and pre-existing conditions such as prematurity, cardiopathy, or gastroesophageal reflux. Vital signs, including pulse oximetry (Nellcor OxiMax N-65, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) and respiratory rate, were obtained from all patients by an attending nurse. A detailed clinical examination was performed by the pediatrician, who then filled out the Respiratory Distress Assessing Instrument (RDAI) 13 and made all treatment decisions. The RDAI assesses wheezing and respiratory distress on a scale from 0 to 17, with higher scores indicating more severe illness, and has good interobserver reliability. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained by a respiratory therapist by the instillation of 1 ml of saline in each nostril and gentle suction with a silicone catheter. The sample was immediately put on ice and sent to the laboratory for analysis. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were volume-adjusted with saline to 3 ml, and six different aliquots were stored at -70˚C. Nucleic acid extraction was performed with a QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hamburg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed with a High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions using 20 ml of the previously extracted RNA.
