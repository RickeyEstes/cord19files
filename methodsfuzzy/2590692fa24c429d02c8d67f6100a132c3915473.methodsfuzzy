Melting points were measured on Stuart Melting Point (SMP3) apparatus (Barloworld Scientific, Staffordshire, UK) in open capillaries with uncorrected values. IR spectra were recorded on FTIR Perkin Elmer Paragon 500 and UV-Vis spectra on Lambda 20 double beam spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). All NMR ( 1 H and 13 C) spectra were recorded at 25 • C on NMR Avance 600 (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) and Varian Inova 400 spectrometers (Varian, Palo-Alto, CA, USA) at 300, 400 and 600 MHz for 1 H and 75, 100 and 150 MHz for 13 C nuclei, respectively. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm) using tetramethylsilane as reference in the 1 H and the DMSO residual peak as reference in the 13 CA, α-methylcinnamic acid ((2-methyl-3-phenyl)acrylic acid), 4-methoxy-cinnamic acid (p-coumaric acid methyl ether), 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid (caffeic acid dimethyl ether), 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid, 3,4-(methylenedioxy)cinnamic acid (3-benzo[1,3]-dioxol-5-yl-acrylic acid), 4-chlorocinnamic acid, 2-fluorocinnamic acid, 4-(trifluoromethyl)cinnamic acid, 3-(trifluoromethyl)cinnamic acid and 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)cinnamic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), predominantly as trans stereoisomers (≥99%). 1H-benzo[d] [1, 2, 3] triazole (BtH), triphosgene, PQ diphosphate, TEA, hydrazine hydrate, LOX, linoleic acid sodium salt, DPPH, NDGA, AAPH and Trolox were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich as well. PQ was prepared from PQ diphosphate prior the use. All reactions with PQ were run light protected.
