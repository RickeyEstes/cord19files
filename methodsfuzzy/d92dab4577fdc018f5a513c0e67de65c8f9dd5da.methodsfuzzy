Human fetal intestinal (HFI) organ cultures were prepared and used as outlined (Resta et al., 1985) . The J774 and C6/36 cells were obtained from the ATCC. The cell lines were fed every 3 days with RPMI medium, 2% fetal calf serum, glutamine, penicillin and amikacin. The C6/36 cells were maintained at 28°C while the other cells were kept at 37°C. Virus seed stock was prepared by passing HEC 15 times in HFI organ cultures and three times in J774 cells. The material from this last passage was frozen and thawed once and 1 ml of the resuspended slurry was placed into nunc vials and stored at − 70°C. It has been determined to be bacteriologically sterile and free from mycoplasma contamination and has been sent to the ATCC. For demonstration of the virus and its antigenic characteristics, this virus seed stock, a later passage in J774 cells or low passage virus in C6/36 cells were used. Virus was also grown in medium containing 10 mgm/ml of trypsin . Fluorescence microscopy was performed by preparing a suspension of cells; low speed centrifugation at room temperature, resuspending the cells in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), recentrifugation and final resuspension of the cells. Ten wells of a multi-welled slide were filled with this final suspension, air dried and fixed in acetone at − 20°C for 10 min. Slides were stored at − 20°C. Infected cells and uninfected control cells were overlaid with immune and non-immune human sera, incubated at 37°C for 30 min, washed with PBS and then stained with flouresceinated antihuman Ig (IgG, IgA, and IgM) or anti-human IgM or anti-animal IgG. J774 cells are known to contain receptors for the Fc portion of IgG. To perform flourescence microscopy on these cells, we used only anti-human IgM conjugates. Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) was performed by fixing the supernatants of infected cells with 2% glutaraldehyde, low speed centrifugation after 24 h fixation and subsequent centrifugation of the remaining supernatant at 130 000 g for 90 min at 4°C. The precipitate was resuspended in distilled water. Negative staining was accomplished with 2% phosphotungstic acid (PTA) at a pH of 7.2. Transmission EM with J774 cells was performed by standard methods (Bencosme and Tsutsumi, 1970) . Preparations of HEC for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blotting (WB) were made by growing the virus in J774 and C6/36 cells. When the infected cell suspension as determined by immunofluorescence approximated 25%, the cells were scraped from the surface of the flask, the contents frozen and thawed once and the supernatant was separated after centrifugation at 10 000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The saline concentration of the supernatant was adjusted to 2.3% and polyethylene glycol (PEG) added to a concentration of 7%. After standing overnight at 4°C, the solution was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The PEG precipitate was solubilized by adding ethylenediaminotetraacetic acid in normal saline that was buffered at a pH of 7.2. The resulting solution was placed on a 20 -60% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 130 000 g for 18 h at 4°C. The bands obtained at or near mid-gradient were subjected to PAGE and silver stained. WB was accomplished by taking the bands in the mid or near-mid sucrose gradient, adding a buffer containing sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) without a reducing substance and heated at 100°C for 5 min. The solubilized proteins were separated by PAGE in a tris-buffered (pH 8.2) solution containing glycine and SDS. The PAGE separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% NP40 in TBS overnight. After drying, strips were cut for WB. The WB strips were reacted overnight with sera at a 1:50 dilution followed by the addition of biotinylated anti-human or animal antisera (1:250 dilution), streptavidin peroxidase (1:250 dilution) followed by color development after the addition of a chromogenic substrate. Between each step, the strips were washed three times in tris-buffered saline. The biotinylated antisera and streptavidin peroxidase were obtained from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD. Hemagglutination studies were performed with mouse erythryocytes, 0.05%, suspended in PBS, pH 7.4. OC43 and 229E antigens and antisera were obtained from Dr John Hierholzer of the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA. For WB, antigens were further purified by equilibrium sucrose density ultracentrifugation. Dr Kathryn Holmes of the University of Colorado Medical Center, Denver, CO supplied rabbit antiserum (h N) against the N protein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV A59).
