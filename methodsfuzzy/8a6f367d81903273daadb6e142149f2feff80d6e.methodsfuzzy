We previously documented that pDC activation by FMDV occurs only in presence of specific antibodies [7] . However, these experiments were performed with pDC, which were only enriched about~5-10 fold from PBMC using a CD172a positive selection by magnetic cell sorting ( Figure 1A ). Therefore, more efficient purification methods were evaluated in this study. pDC are non-T cells (CD3 ) [22] and are found within the CD172alow CD4 high CD14 PBMC [15] . Based on this, PBMC were first depleted from CD14 + monocytes and subsequently enriched using CD172a. This resulted in a frequency of 3-5% of pDC (~20 fold enrichment), depending on the experiment. A third protocol employed a CD3 depletion and subsequent CD4 enrichment of PBMC resulting in a pDC population of 15-60% ( Figure 1A ). Type A CpG oligonucleotides, like CpG ODN D32, are potent activators of IFN-α secretion from porcine pDC [14] and were employed as positive controls. While CpG induced only a few hundred units of IFN-α from unpurified PBMC, after magnetic cell sorting the production was increased by~10 fold but with little differences between the different purification protocols ( Figure 1B ). This contrasted with pDC stimulation by FMDV O UKG 2001. As reported previously, no stimulation of PBMC or CD172a-enriched PBMC in terms of IFN-α production was observed. Only the protocols employing either the CD14-depleted and subsequent CD172a-enriched PBMC or the CD3-depleted and subsequently CD4-enriched PBMC permitted the induction of IFN-α after stimulation with FMDV O UKG 2001 ( Figure 1C ). It is important to note that these responses were in the range of 100 times lower than those seen after CpG stimulation. As the IFN-α level was not significantly higher when CD3-depleted/CD4-enriched PBMC were compared with the CD14-depleted/CD172a-enriched PBMC while the number of cells obtained upon enrichment was higher with the latter protocol, the CD14 depletion/ CD172a enrichment method was employed for the following experiments.
