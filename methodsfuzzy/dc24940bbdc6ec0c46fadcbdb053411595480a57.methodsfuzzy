A solution of arylamine (8 mmol) in 1.56 mL of conc. hydrochloridric acid and 1 mL of water was cooled to 0째C and slowly diazotized with a solution of sodium nitrite (8 mmol) in 2 mL of water. The diazonium salt solution was added dropwise, during about 10-20 min, to a cold water solution of the N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl/lupinyl)aniline monoacetate (8 mmol) , and maintaining carefully pH 7 with the simultaneous addition of a saturated solution of sodium acetate. After stirring the reaction mixture for 45 min at 0-5째C, the oil product was extracted with Et 2 O, dried, then vacuum-distilled (0.1-0.2 torr) at 80-90째C to remove the unreacted N-substituted aniline. The residue was fractionated by CC, eluting firstly with Et 2 O the triazene derivative (E) and then with Et 2 O + 5%-MeOH the isomeric azocompound (A) in quite lower yield. The isolated compounds were further purified either by crystallization or, when oily, by a second CC or distillation.  The aromatic amine (25 mmol) was dissolved in 7.3 mL of conc. hydrochloridric acid and 10 mL of water, cooling in a ice bath. The solution was kept at 0-5째C, while adding drop by drop a solution of sodium nitrite (25 mmol) in 10 mL of water. The diazonium salt was then coupled with the relevant amine (25 mmol) dissolved in 45 mL of 1 N NaOH (pH 7-8). After 20 min of stirring, the precipitate was collected by filtration. The solid was crystallized from the suitable solvent. In the case of compounds 14, 18 and 19 the proper oily aniline was added to the diazonium salt solution, followed by a solution of sodium acetate to reduce acidity. When the coupling-product separated as an oil (compounds 37, 43, 53) it was extracted with Et 2 O and after removing the solvent the oil was purified by CC. The cytisine derivative 58 was extracted with CHCl 3 , and the solid obtained was crystallized from acetone.
