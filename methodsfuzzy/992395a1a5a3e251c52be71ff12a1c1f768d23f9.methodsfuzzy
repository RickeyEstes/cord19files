Data were analyzed by 2-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). The first factor was the type of repair, and the second factor was the period of denervation (0, 8, 12, and 22 weeks). Six animals were used per repair group, and 7 animals were used for the control and sham groups. A previous study by McNamara et al. found about a 60% difference in rabbit muscle function between the neurorrhaphy technique and neurotization at 2 months after repair. 1 With 6 specimens per group, we are able to detect such a difference in muscle function with repair type (60%) with greater than 95% power and alpha equal to .05. No previous studies have assessed the effects of delayed healing time. Therefore, power was estimated for a difference of 30% with healing time. With 6 specimens per group, we should also be able to detect a difference of 30% with 85% power. These power calculations were made using PASS 6.0 software (NCSS, Kaysville, UT) and were based on a 2-factor fixed-effects analysis of variance with a 2 by 3 design. 4, 11, 13 Upon completion of the study, we ran a 2-way ANOVA with the main outcome, force ratio, as the dependent variable with time and procedure as the fixed factors. The procedure was limited to repair and neurotization. Both time (p Ͻ .001) and procedure (p ϭ .001) were statistically significant but the interaction was not (p ϭ .1). The difference at time 0 between methods is significant after a Bonferroni correction (p Ͻ .05) but at none of the other time periods. A logarithmic transformation of the force variable produced better equalization of the variances but did not alter the result of the analysis.
