All in-vivo procedures were conducted in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and the CDC-NIH Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories and were approved by the Southern Research Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUP protocol #08-05-031B). The Animal experiments were performed in the AAALAC-accredited ABSL-2 facilities at Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL. Four ferrets, two males and two females were intranasaly infected with 10 4 TCID50/ml influenza H1N1 A/California/07/2009. Viral titers in nasal swabs were analyzed by establishing the median tissue culture infective dose in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells according to our previously published protocols [32] . Analysis of nasal swabs is a straight forward method to analyze presence of replicating virus during influenza infection ( [33] and our unpublished results). One male and one female were euthanized on days three and six postinfection to increase chance of identifying transcripts with specific temporal expression patterns. Tissues were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. We collected cranial and caudal lung, heart, bone marrow from the femur, lymph node, spleen and blood. The tissues were homogenized in TRIzol and RNA was extracted according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). RNA from blood was extracted using the PAX gene kit from Qiagen, according to the supplier's instructions. Spleens from na√Øve, healthy male ferrets were The red bars indicate the length of the contigs from the assembly using the sequences from the cDNA library from infected tissues. The green bars show the contigs lengths for the combined assembly, built from these sequences as well as the ESTs previously reported [8] . The histogram in panel B illustrates the number genes that were represented by one or multiple non-overlapping of contigs in the combined assembly. Panel C shows the distribution of species extracted using the best hit (lowest blast E-value) from the Refseq Protein blast analysis of the combined assembly. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0037104.g001 collected over ice into Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (Gibco). Splenocytes were released by mechanical disruption and the cells were passed through 40 mm mesh strainers. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation. Erythrocytes were lysed in ammonium chloride-based lysis buffer (ACK Lysis Buffer, Lonza) for 5 minutes, followed by washing in heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FBS, Gibco). Splenocytes were washed and the concentration was adjusted to 2610 6 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 media with 5% FBS, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, and 200 mM L-glutamine. Lipopolysaccharide from E. coli O111:B4 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the media at a concentration of 200 ng/ ml and cells were incubated overnight (10 hours) at 37uC with 5% CO 2 and saturated humidity in a cell culture flask. Activation was confirmed under an inverted light microscope, the cells were pelleted and lysed in TRIzol. After quality assessment of the RNA using the BioRad Experion RNA StdSens analysis kit, the RNA samples were pooled to ensure sequence diversity. This RNA pool was reverse-transcribed to cDNA that was normalized prior to sequencing to avoid sequencing of abundantly expressed transcripts. Preparation of the normalized cDNA library was then done as previously published [8] and sequenced using 454 Sequencing on the Genome Sequencer FLX with GS FLX Titanium series reagents according to the manufacturers protocols (Roche). Assembly of the sequencing reads was done with iAssembler (version: v1.3) using default settings [34] . This software is a standalone package designed to accurately assemble longer next generation reads generated by the Roche-454 sequencing technology into contigs. The pipeline employs an iterative assembly strategy with automated error corrections of missassemblies to increase the accuracy of the EST assembly [34] . Two separate assemblies were built, using the sequences from the cDNA library constructed here (TSA accession numbers JR778296 -JR808535), and a combined assembly of these sequences and those that we had generated previously [8] . This assembly was done to maximize the chances of de novo identification of ferret gene orthologs. The assemblies were then blasted against the RefSeq RNA and Protein databases, as well as the RefSeq RNA and Protein databases specific for humans. We used both a more stringent analysis (MegaBlast) and regular blast to annotate the contigs. Extraction of annotation data was done using a TCL script called tcl_blast_parser, which provides a matrix file containing info about the primary blast hits, including normalized expectation values for the hits (e norm ,log(Exp)/100), the number of perfect matches, alignment length, frame of translation etc. The contigs that aligned with human nucleotide and/or protein sequences using the MegaBlast algorithm are shown in Table S1 . Contigs without human orthologous sequences or contigs aligning with non-transcribed genes and contigs exclusively aligned using the less stringent blastn algorithm are found in Table S2 . The searches against the human databases enabled functional analysis using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID, version 6.7) as well as the BiNGO Cytoscape (version 2.44) plug-in to assess overrepresentation of gene ontologies (GO) [35] [36] [37] . The settings used for the BiNGO analysis were: Hypergeometric testing followed by Benjamin & Hochberg FDR correction using a P-value 0.05 for Biological_Process in Homo sapiens. http://publications.scilifelab.se/svensson_lt/ ferret_transcriptome. Table S1 Annotation table for ferret ESTs with human sequence homology. Contigs from the combined assembly of cDNA sequences indentified here and the ESTs previously reported [8] that showed homology to human RNA or protein sequences using the ''megablast'' algorithm in BLAST. ''Similar to Human Gene'' and ''Human Refseq acc no.'' indicate the Human Gene Symbol and the accession number from the Human RNA or Human Protein database.

(XLSX) Table S2 Annotation table for ferret ESTs without human sequence homology, ESTs with homologies detected exclusively by blastn and ESTs with homology to untranscribed human gene orthologs. The ''no_hu-man_hits'' worksheet contains the lists the contigs from the combined assembly that did not show homology to human RNA or protein sequences using the ''megablast'' algorithm in BLAST, but were aligned with RNA sequences from the RefSeq RNA database. The ''RefSeq Gene from refseq RNA'' indicates the gene name for the orthologous sequence, derived from the description line of the blast hit, ''RefSeq RNA_acc'' indicates the accession number of the homologous sequence. The ''blastn'' spreadsheet lists the contigs that showed alignment when the less stringent blastn algorithm was used, and the ''hits_to_non_-transcr_hum_genes'' shows the contigs that showed the best alignment to known non-transcribed human orthologs.
