Methodologic considerations in developing 2-1-1 partnerships warrant careful consideration. Specifıcally, Shank 4 examines how cost analyses have been referenced as 2-1-1 has spread across the U.S. with an eye toward understanding how these data influence policy diffusion and uptake. Although Shank provides an important fırst look at costs, future expansion of 2-1-1 will demand increasing accountability, including more analysis of costs, benefıts, and return on investment associated with 2-1-1 programs and services. Eddens and colleagues 13 tackle an important methodologic and pragmatic question about whether the implementation of a minimal intervention research study in a 2-1-1 call center has adverse effects on key call-related quality indicators. Results from this study suggest that crises causing spikes in call volume adversely affect 2-1-1 service quality indicators as well as accrual of research participants. Thus, as the complexity or duration of an intervention or research demand is extended, support to expand 2-1-1 staffıng is likely required. Alcaraz et al. 14 expect to create more effıcient 2-1-1 systems by using existing data to model or predict the health needs of 2-1-1 callers, thereby targeting and making more effıcient future interventions. Initial fındings of this innovative and important work suggest that routinely collected 2-1-1 service request data may be useful in identifying callers with specifıc cancer prevention and control needs. To apply this approach in 2-1-1 systems across the country, standardization of service request categories will be necessary. An increasingly rigorous application of flexible designs, mixed methods, and innovative statistical analyses and modeling techniques are showcased throughout this issue. Research demands must be realistic, sensitive to the 2-1-1 mission, and cognizant of their potential effect on 2-1-1 system call quality and capacity. Papers in this special issue focus on ways in which 2-1-1 has effectively reached high-risk, disadvantaged populations; explored ways to identify key health interests and needs of 2-1-1 callers; and screened and referred and/or enrolled callers into a variety of health-related programs, services, and research studies. In addition, readers can review case examples of how 2-1-1 works, clarify the challenges of implementing research partnerships within and across 2-1-1s, and review some methodologic considerations including data privacy/ immediacy, data use, infrastructure needs, and cost. In addition to the research reports and special feature papers, a series of well-crafted commentaries provide additional insights on the promise of 2-1-1 in relation to opportunities for addressing disparities. Bennett 16 urges 2-1-1 researchers to design 2-1-1 studies that move beyond additional effıcacy trials and use innovative, smart designs to accelerate the uptake and improve the effectiveness of electronic and mobile technology healthrelated interventions. He provides surprising data which document that low-income, minority populations are more likely to have access to mobile phones with email and text options-two cornerstone features of electronic and mobile interventions. Mindful of the need to minimize burden on the 2-1-1 system, he makes a strong case for the benefıts of eHealth and mHealth technology as an essential component of an overall approach to improving health outcomes among callers to the 2-1-1 system who face health disparities. Oberlander and Perreira 15 offer a fınal and compelling commentary about the role of 2-1-1 in the larger context of healthcare reform. This paper is a timely review of how 2-1-1 may best fıt into the changing policies and structural changes underway within the U.S. healthcare system. After a brief review of key features of the ACA, and acknowledging that its full implementation will depend (in part) on the results of upcoming elections, they thoughtfully review ways in which 2-1-1 might play a role in improving health and healthcare access for its callers. For example, they propose that the 2-1-1 system is best positioned to share information with callers about their eligibility for different types of health coverage and how to enroll in programs for which they are eligible (Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicaid, and [new] healthcare exchanges); referring individuals to available health programs/services in the local community (health centers/clinics); and providing healthcare assistance to new immigrants who may benefıt from additional navigation services. They conclude by acknowledging that 2-1-1 has an important role to play for Americans who are newly eligible for insurance gain coverage and access to medical services due to ACA; particularly in "connecting the uninsured to safety-net resources." The 2-1-1 Health Research Working Group members, in partnership with the NCI and its Centers of Excellence in Cancer Communication (CECCR), and the CDC/ NCI-sponsored Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network (CPCRN), were instrumental in putting this supplement together. The Working Group consisted of an interdisciplinary team of researchers who believe that the 2-1-1 system can play an important role in addressing health disparities by influencing policy and practice through strong research partnerships that build the knowledge and evidence base. As a key leader within the initial Working Group, Dr. Kreuter 3 provides an exemplary overview of this research potential and a rationale for why health researchers should develop partnerships with 2-1-1 to address disparities in health. His overarching and compelling message is that "few, if any, health or social service organizations are better suited to deliver on the triad goals of reach-effectiveness-connections than 2-1-1." Moving forward, the focus should probably be on how to make sure that the challenges associated with these partnerships can be overcome; for example, minimizing burden on an already taxed 2-1-1 staff, making sure the health focus does not prevent callers from getting a primary need met, and building a data and training infrastructure to make sure the system can handle any new or expanded research and intervention partnerships. To that end, Hall and members of the initial 2-1-1 Health Research Working Group 19 prepared an excellent summary of the challenges, opportunities, and recommendations for advancing future 2-1-1 research. Specifıcally, they identify a need to articulate conceptual frameworks to address how the 2-1-1 system fıts into the larger public health context as well as mapping existing and potential interconnections between 2-1-1 services, referrals, and other organizations that play critical roles in enhancing the health and well-being of the nation. Once these interconnections are laid out, Hall and the Health Research Working Group emphasize the need for: 1. common measures and methods to enable data integration across the 2-1-1 system and with other data sources (e.g., Census, GIS); 2. the systematic assessment of the needs of individuals and communities who access 2-1-1; 3. a careful study of basic individual and social factors that influence the effectiveness of interventions to address health disparities among 2-1-1 callers; 4. the development, adaptation, or refınement of targeted, tailored, and multi-level interventions to meet the needs of the 2-1-1 callers; 5. the creation and tracking of cohorts to evaluate the impact of 2-1-1 interventions and the broader public health context; 6. an evaluation of the costs and impact of the potential, emerging, and existing 2-1-1 interventions for addressing health disparities; 7. a consideration of the factors that influence the implementation and sustainability of these interventions; 8. a fostering of collaboration among 2-1-1 systems, researchers, and other organizations; and 9. an increase in both outreach and utilization of the 2-1-1 system to ensure that health disparities are being addressed. 19 A practical companion article to the Hall et al. 19 paper, Eddens 18 summarizes key strategies and lessons learned for conducting collaborative research with 2-1-1 systems for those who are motivated to develop new 2-1-1 research partnerships or expand on existing relationships. Creating a research foundation based on mutual respect includes adherence to the philosophy/values of 2-1-1; fostering and maintenance of communication from the inception to the dissemination of research results; and linking the research to the 2-1-1 service mission. They also encourage collaborators to help build 2-1-1 system capacity with needed resources, staffıng and training to support research efforts, as well as ongoing involvement in the research project. This highly pragmatic and thoughtful article offers crucial guideposts for future collaborative research that should share benefıts with researchers, the 2-1-1 system and its callers. What has emerged from this collection of contributed papers and commentaries is that the promise of the 2-1-1 system playing a major role in a comprehensive plan for eliminating health disparities appears to be limited only by the commitment of time, resources, and the political will to overcome identifıed challenges within the system. This supplement is both timely and important in the context of a challenging political, healthcare, and economic environment. Clearly, results described in this supplement demonstrate these 2-1-1 system research partnerships can be part of the solution for eliminating health disparities by bringing additional resources, training, and data to strengthen and enhance the current efforts of the 2-1-1 system.
