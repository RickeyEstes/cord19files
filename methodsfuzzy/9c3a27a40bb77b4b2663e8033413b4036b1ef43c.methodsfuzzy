Recombinant F and G proteins. The recombinant fusion (F) protein was produced by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ) using a recombinant baculovirus expression system as we have previously described 34 . The recombinant attachment (G) protein was expressed in E. coli as we have previously described 34 . BRSV-F/G Nanovaccine. The BRSV-F/G nanovaccine was prepared as previously described 34 , with minor modifications. Briefly, 50:50 CPTEG:CPH copolymer was dissolved in methylene chloride at a concentration of 20 mg/mL. The F and G proteins were suspended in this solution at a total protein concentration of 7.4 mg/mL (3.7 mg/mL of each protein), sonicated for approximately 30 seconds, and the suspension poured into pentane at a 1:200 volumetric ratio (methylene chloride:pentane). The suspension was vacuum filtered to collect the nanoparticles and the nanoparticles were placed in a −20 °C freezer until further use. The nanoparticle yield was 73% with a protein encapsulation efficiency of ca. 100% ([actual protein mass encapsulated]/[theoretical protein mass encapsulated]). Animals. All animal procedures were conducted in strict accordance with federal and institutional guidelines and were approved by the Kansas State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The animal care protocol included provisions for a humane endpoint as determined by the discretion of the attending clinical veterinarian. Methods to minimize pain and distress included the avoidance of prolonged restraint and the inclusion of euthanasia as an intervention strategy. A total of forty-three, mixed-gender (n = 21 males; n = 22 females) Holstein calves were purchased from two dairy farms, one in southern Nebraska (n = 37) and one in central KS (n = 6), and were enrolled in the study at birth. Calves were randomly assigned to the VAD or VAS treatment group. All calves were prevented suckling from their dams, and instead received a first feeding of colostrum replacer within 4 h of birth. Each animal received 375 g of fractionated colostrum replacer (Milk Products, Chilton, WI) reconstituted in 1.9 L of water at approximately 40 °C. The colostrum replacer contained 150 g of bovine globulin protein concentrated from colostral whey and was essentially devoid of all fat-soluble vitamins A, D 3 , and E. Vitamins D 3 (150,000 IU of cholecalciferol/dose) and E (1,500 IU alpha-tocopheral/dose) were added back to the colostrum replacer for all calves. VA (150,000 IU retinyl palmitate) was added back to the VAS treatment group. VA was omitted from the colostrum replacer for the VAD calves. Animals were then placed on a VAS or VAD milk replacer diet for the remainder of the study (Milk Products, Chilton, WI). Calves were transported to the Large Animal Research Center at Kansas State University at 3-4 days of age and housed in groups of 2-3 calves per pen on pine chip bedding. Calves were bottle-fed three times per day (~8 hours apart) until 3 weeks of age, then twice per day (~12 hours apart). The milk replacer consisted of 21% crude protein and 20% fat, and was fed at a rate of 1.5 lbs/ day and 14% solids. VAS calves received 45,000 IU VA (retinyl palmitate) per day. VAD animals received the same milk replacer formulation without VA. Calves were also provided ab libitum access to calf starter pellets (18% crude protein, 8% ADF) starting at ~2 weeks of age. Starter grain was formulated without added VA (VAD calves) or with 1820 IU/lb (VAS calves). Serum retinol levels were monitored weekly. Samples were submitted to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for evaluation. At 6 weeks of age, animals were divided into 4 groups: 1) VAS, no vaccine (n = 6; 3 females and 3 males); 2) VAS, BRSV-NP vaccine (n = 13; 7 males and 6 females); 3) VAD, no vaccine (n = 6, 2 males and 4 females); 4) VAD, BRSV-NP vaccine (n = 12; 5 males and 7 females). Calves were vaccinated intranasally with 145 mg BRSV-F/G loaded CPTEG:CPH nanoparticles (~2 mg recombinant F and G proteins) with 2 mg soluble recombinant F and G proteins. The vaccine was suspended in 5 mL of sterile saline, with 2.5 mL delivered into each nostril. The calf was restrained and its head was tilted up, then the vaccine was administered into the nose using a syringe fitted with a 2-inch nasal cannula, equipped with a plastic depth control ring. Following vaccination, immune responses were monitored weekly in the serum, peripheral blood, and upper (nasal fluid collection) and lower (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collection) respiratory tract. Six calves (VAS, n = 3, all calves were male; VAD, n = 3, 2 females and 1 male) were sacrificed prior to challenge and samples of lung and liver tissues were collected to verify retinol concentrations and to serve as control tissues for immunology and gene expression studies. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collection. Pre-challenge bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was collected from all animals, 4-5 days prior to BRSV infection, using a protocol we have previously described 63 . A modified stallion catheter was blindly passed through the nose and advanced through the trachea until lodging in the bronchus. A total of 180 mL of sterile saline was divided into three aliquots. An aliquot was introduced to the lower respiratory tract, followed by immediate suction to obtain lower airway washes. The procedure was repeated twice more. All three aliquots were pooled at the end of the procedure. BAL samples were kept on ice, filtered over sterile gauze, and centrifuged at 200 x g for 10 minutes. Contaminating red blood cells were removed using hypotonic lysis. Cells were washed, counted and stimulated as described below for antigen recall assays.
