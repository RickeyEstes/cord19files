We carried out a comprehensive literature review aimed at investigating waterborne viral outbreaks linked to swimming pools, to explore the etiological agents implicated, pathways of transmission, associations between indicator organisms and disease, and key issues related to chlorination/disinfection procedures. Viral outbreaks are summarized in Table 1 . The presence of enteric viruses in swimming pools under non-epidemic conditions was also reviewed. Different databases (Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar) were accessed using the terms norovirus, Norwalk virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, echovirus, coxsackievirus, and hepatitis A, in combination with terms recreation, swimming, pool, and water. switched off, to avoid eye irritation with chlorine. Within one week, 25 of the 36 exposed swimmers became ill. Children swimming in the afternoon, when chlorination was still working, did not get sick. The infection was shown to spread in families having index cases (20 infected contacts). Analyses of water were done approximately 14 days after the presumed exposure. For this reason, attempts to isolate the virus from the water failed. An outbreak of acute conjunctivitis due to HAdV type 7 occurred in Kansas, USA in 1973: 44 cases and one hospitalization were documented [14] . Eye symptoms predominated (red or pink eyes, swollen eyes), but a variety of other signs were also noted (mainly fever, headache, and nausea). A school swimming pool was identified as the source of infection. Chlorine concentration was low due to an equipment failure. The epidemic was easily controlled by raising the pool's chlorine level. Unfortunately, tests for viruses and bacterial indicators were carried out after super-chlorination and consequently results were negative. In 1977, two outbreaks associated with swimming pools occurred in Georgia, USA. The first, due to HAdV type 3, involved at least 105 cases [15] , with patients showing different symptoms, including sore throat, fever, headache, anorexia and conjunctivitis. In this case, a private swimming pool was the source of infection. A temporary malfunction in the water filtration system of the pool associated with inadequate chlorine levels was recorded. Both waterborne and person-to-person transmission occurred. In the second outbreak, HAdV type 4 was recognized as the etiological agent of pharyngoconjunctival fever in 72 persons [16] . An insufficient amount of chlorine was found in the water of the pool. To stop the spread of infection, the pool was closed during the summer and adequately chlorinated. Adenovirus was recovered from the water sampled from the pool. In Oklahoma, USA, an outbreak of pharyngitis caused by HAdV type 7a was recorded in 1982 among 77 children attending a swimming pool [17] . Symptoms included conjunctivitis, fever, sore throat, headache, and abdominal pain. Two cases were hospitalized with dehydration from persistent vomiting. A malfunction of the automatic pool chlorinator was identified as the cause of the outbreak. In fact, during the two weeks preceding the epidemic, its failure forced the pool operator to manually add chlorine to the pool. Another outbreak was recorded in 1995, in Greece, where 80 athletes under 18 years of age presented with fever, conjunctivitis, sore throat, weakness, and abdominal pain, after swimming in a pool [18] . Seven athletes were hospitalized. Virological analyses on clinical samples were not performed and the illness was attributed to HAdV on the basis of clinical symptoms alone. Water samples from both the pool and the distribution system were tested for HAdV, enterovirus, and hepatitis A virus by molecular methods. The water of the pool tested positive for HAdV and negative for the other viruses, demonstrating its role as the source of infection. Samples from the water system were negative for all viruses tested. Chlorine levels were found to be low, probably due to a malfunctioning of the pool chlorination system. Five HAdV outbreaks associated with swimming were recorded in the 2000s. In the year 2000, an outbreak of pharyngoconjunctival fever occurred in North Queensland, Australia, where, after a school camp, 34 children aged 4-12, got sick [19] . In addition to primary cases acquired at the camp (N â€¢ = 25), nine other cases were acquired within the households. The school camp had a large saltwater swimming pool. Adenovirus 3 was isolated from eye and throat swabs. A PCR analysis of water samples for HAdV did not yield positive results. It was, however, demonstrated that the pool was not properly maintained, and that the level of residual chlorine was inadequate. An outbreak of pharyngoconjunctival fever affecting 59 children under 15 was recorded in a municipality of Northern Spain in July 2008 [20] . Forty-three cases were recognized as primary cases, all of whom attended a municipal swimming pool. The remaining 15 children were secondary cases, which had been in close contact with a primary case. Adenovirus type 4 was detected in pharyngeal swabs. Electrical system failures causing the intermittent breakdown of the pool's bromine dosing pumps and the slowing down of water circulation were assumed to have been the cause of the outbreak. Swimming was only allowed after the disinfection system was restored and appropriate concentrations of bromine were reached. Due to logistic problems, no water samples were taken from the swimming pool for virological analysis. In 2011, children (4-9 years old) who had attended a swimming training center in Eastern China showed symptoms of pharyngoconjunctival fever. Adenovirus type 3 was recognized as the etiological agent [21] . A total of 134 cases were confirmed from among 900 amateur swimmers, with an incidence of 14.9%. Fourteen hospital admissions were documented. Fever, tonsillitis, sore throat, headache, sneezing, cough, conjunctivitis, fatigue, and diarrhea occurred among the bathers. The low level of residual chlorine in the water, along with excessive crowding in the pool were suggested as having caused the epidemic. In the same year, in a primary school in Taiwan, an outbreak of HAdV infection occurred among 373 students, with four hospitalizations [22] . Most of the students attended a swimming course in two swimming facilities outside the school and presented with fever and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. Other symptoms included diarrhea, vomiting, skin eruptions and conjunctivitis. Throat swabs of affected students were tested for influenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza types 1-4, and herpes simplex virus. Samples were found positive only for HAdV type 7. Water samples were not obtained from any of the facilities for virological analysis. In 2013, an outbreak of pharyngoconjunctival fever involved 55 people (49 students and six staff) at a university in Beijing, China [23] . Fifty patients (91%) attending the same swimming pool two weeks before the onset of symptoms were considered primary cases. The other five subjects (9%) who had not swum in the pool were defined as secondary cases (person-to-person transmission). Human AdV type 4 was identified from both eye and throat swabs of the patients and from concentrated swimming pool water samples. Gene sequences obtained from the water samples exhibited a 100% match with the sequences obtained from swab samples. Control measures included the emptying and closing of the pool, and the disinfection with a high dose of sodium hypochlorite (500 mg/L).
