The bactericidal test method is summarized in Fig. 1 . Testing was performed at 20 ± 1°C. Hands were prepared by washing for 60 s with 5 mL of soft soap to remove transient bacteria and dried with paper towels. Hands were immersed in the contamination fluid for 5 s and then allowed to dry in the air for 3 min, avoiding the formation of droplets. Pre-washing samples were obtained by rubbing the fingertips and thumb tips on the base of a Petri dish containing 10 mL tryptic soy broth (TSB, without neutralizer) for 60 s. A separate dish was used for each hand. Dilutions of 10 -3 and 10 -4 were prepared in TSB and 0.1 mL of each dilution was plated on the surface of a tryptic soy agar (TSA) plate and incubated at 36°C ± 1°C for 24 h. Volunteers then washed their wetted hands with test product or reference soft soap following the standard hand wash procedure specified in EN1499. According to EN1499, the standard hand wash procedure was completed by a 10-s rinse of the hands under cold running tap water. Volunteers held their hands with fingertips pointing upwards until post-washing samples were taken by rubbing the fingertips and thumb tips on the base of a Petri dish containing 10 mL of TSB (with neutralizer) for 60 s. A separate dish was used for each hand. Amounts of 1.0 and 0.1 mL of the undiluted sampling fluid and 0.1 mL of a 10 -1 dilution were prepared in TSB, plated on the surface of TSA plates and incubated at 36 ± 1°C for 24 h. Neutralizer XXXII (4% Tween80 ? 3% saponin ? 2% histidine ? 0.4% lecithin ? 0.5% SDS) was used for CHG and Neutralizer XLIV ? 2% sodium thiosulfate (6% Tween80 ? 0.2% histidine ? 0.6% lecithin ?2% sodium-thiosulfate ? 0.2% peptone ? 1.7% sodium chloride ? 1.8% di-sodium hydrogen phosphate ? 0.3% potassium dihydrogen phosphate) was used for PVP-I. The number of test organisms released from the fingertips into sampling fluids was assessed before and after the hygienic hand wash and the number of viable bacteria were expressed as cfu per mL. The bactericidal activity was determined by the difference of the mean log prewashing value minus the mean log post-washing value. This difference was given as a reduction factor. The virucidal test method is summarized in Fig. 2 . Testing was performed at 20.0 ± 0.5°C. To remove transient viruses, 5 mL of diluted soft soap was applied to the cupped hands of volunteers and was rubbed in for 60 s before rinsing with tap water and drying with paper towels for 30 s. Hands were inoculated with a low concentration suspension of MNV. Volunteers were asked to cup their hands carefully, 250 lL of inoculate was slowly pipetted into the palms, then volunteers gently rubbed their hands together until all surfaces of the hands were coated with the inoculate. Finally, volunteers rotated their hands in the air for 60 s to allow the inoculate to dry. Pre-washing samples were obtained by rubbing the fingertips of the inoculated hands on the base of a Petri dish containing 5 mL Dulbeccos Minimum Essential Medium for 60 s, followed by drying hands in the air for 60 s. Volunteers then washed their hands with the test product or reference soft soap following the standard hand wash procedure specified in EN1499 before post-washing samples were obtained using the same methods used pre-washing. The Petri dishes were incubated at 37 ± 1°C under 5% CO 2 . The number of test organisms released from the fingertips into sampling fluids was assessed before and after the hygienic hand wash, and virus titers were expressed TCID 50 /mL. The virucidal activity was determined by the difference of the logarithmic titer of the pre-washing sample minus the logarithmic titre of the postwashing sample (Dlog 10 TCID 50 /mL). This difference was given as a reduction factor.
