Immunostaining of diseased tissues (immunohistochemistry) or fluids by immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase methods can be as reliable as RT-PCR, but the accuracy of these tests is limited by the quality of the reagents used, the tissues sampled, and the ex-pertise of the microscopist in discerning true positive staining within macrophages in tissue lesions or from effusions. Immunofluorescence is more sensitive than immunoperoxidase staining, but requires frozen sections (with or without glycerol/resin protection medium), while immunoperoxidase staining can be performed on formalin fixed tissues. Formalin fixation and wax embedding should be completed as rapidly as possible following tissue collection. Although immunohistochemistry is considered to be accurate for the definitive diagnosis of FIP (Giori et al., 2011) , there are cases of FIP that test negative depending on the quality of the tissues, the presence of adequate lesions within the material examined, and the quality of reagents and test performance. Immunohistochemistry of effusions or fluids from cats suspected of having FIP should be used much more often than at present. Effusions often contain numerous virus positive macrophages that can be concentrated onto slides. This technique has also been used successfully to detect FIPV infected macrophages within the cerebrospinal fluid of a cat with neurologic disease (Ives et al., 2013) . Non-specific positive staining of macrophages might also be a problem. Litster et al. (2013) compared results from direct immunofluorescence on ante-mortem feline effusions with postmortem results in 17 cats with abdominal or thoracic effusions. Histopathologic examination of tissues collected at necropsy confirmed FIP in 10/17 cases and ruled out FIP in 7/17 cases. Ante-mortem direct immunofluorescence testing was positive in all 10 cases confirmed as FIP at postmortem examination. In the seven cats where FIP was ruled out at postmortem examination, direct immunofluorescence was negative in five cases and positive in the remaining two cases. The calculated sensitivity of immunohistochemistry testing was 100% and the specificity was 71.4%. Duplicate effusion specimens from eight cats that were initially positive by immunofluorescence were stored at 4°C or room temperature (22-25°C) and subjected to serial testing to determine the duration of positive results. Direct immunofluorescence positive specimens stored at both temperatures retained their positive status for at least 2 days. Immunoperoxidase staining has been used to diagnose FIPV in macrophages in the skin of two cats with atypical skin lesions (multiple popular lesions; Declercq et al., 2008; Bauer et al., 2013) and in various tissues of a diseased Mountain lion (Stephenson et al., 2013) .
