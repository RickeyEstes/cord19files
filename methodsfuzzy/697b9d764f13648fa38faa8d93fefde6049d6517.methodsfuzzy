Construction of Expression Plasmids for SARS-CoV 12-510 S1-IgG and Full Length Spike (S) Protein Mutants The expression plasmid encoding 12-510 S1 fragment of SARS-CoV Urbani Spike (S) protein, with an N terminal C5 signal sequence and a C-terminal human IgG Fc [14] , was used as a template in site directed mutagenesis PCR using QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) to generate Sin845, GZ-C, GDO1, and GZ0402 mutants. The same procedure and primers were used for the generation of the full length S protein mutant constructs using the pcDNA3.1-S, coding for the full length SARS-CoV S protein with a C-terminal (C9) tag derived from human rhodopsin protein, as a template.
