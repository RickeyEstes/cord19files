Our approach naturally lends itself to Bayesian formulations. As it currently stands our formulation uses a proportional likelihood optimised by exploiting submodularity. However equivalent frameworks exist 3 with explicit likelihoods derived from a survival view point of a temporal point process. These methods can be used within a full Bayesian hierarchical model. This is work that we are currently developing hope to release soon. We have edited the section originally beginning on line 239 to incorporate a response to point 8 which clarifies how our method complements Bayesian methods (lines 247 to 250) , and also added a section to the supplementary information clarifying this with a similar paragraph to the one above (lines 143 to 146 of Supplementary Information). A limitations paragraph has been added (lines 227 to 238). We have also added this paragraph (lines 239 to 250). We discuss the challenges of possibly less complete reporting, larger numbers of cases and potential for a larger asymptomatic population; we introduce potential extensions to the methods (some of which are currently in development) including Bayesian approaches incorporating a wider range of data sources e.g. demographic and genetic data and data augmentation techniques to account for larger numbers of missing cases. 


Section:line 217: it would be useful to briefly describe how this method contributes to, or compliments, bayesian methods.
Section:a section describing the limitations of this method is needed.
Section:the discussion section should also describe how low-income countries, with presumably less complete surveillance data could use this method.
