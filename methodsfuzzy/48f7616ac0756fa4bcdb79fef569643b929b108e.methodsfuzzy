Sequence alignment and homology modeling of neuraminidase Neuraminidase sequences with mutations were downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) influenza virus sequence database (http://www.ncbi.mlm.nih.gov/genomes/flu/). The multiple sequence alignment method was based on the CLUSTAL W2 program (www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/ clustalw2/index.html) [11, 26] . The alignment result was forwarded into homology pipeline for further processing of 3D structure determination. The homology modeling was performed using the Swiss model, which can be accessed through http://www.swissmodel.expasy. org/SWISS-MODEL.html. 3CKZ chain A [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code] with mutation His274Tyr as template was applied to build the latest structure of N1. Validation of the 3D structure from the homology modeling was performed by protein geometry program and superimposed by superpose program in MOE 2009.10 software [9] . Based on the superimposition, the rootmean-square deviation (RMSD) was calculated to identify structural similarity between template model mutated with 3D structure from homology modeling.
