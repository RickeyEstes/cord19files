Why only physicians and nurses perspectives regarding PPE? I understand the relative risk for physicians and nurses as frontline workers is high, but other health workers are involved, and have recorded fatality rates, their experiences with PPE may also add value especially in the context of developing guidelines. Maybe the authors should consider adding this to limitations. If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate? Yes Settings is not well described, consider discussing setting in more detail under a separate title. We are not sure how to respond to this question of the reviewer. We did an Author's response: online survey among health workers who were deployed by MSF or WHO to respond to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa early on in the epidemic. Health workers worked in local hospitals, clinics or Ebola Treatment Centers, but because we did not ask further information about these settings we cannot provide a more detailed description.

We agree with the reviewer about the importance of PPE for other health Author's response: workers, for example cleaners, laboratory workers, burial teams and other workers. However, the focus of the WHO guideline which our study aimed to inform, was on healthcare workers and therefore we also focused our survey on this group.
