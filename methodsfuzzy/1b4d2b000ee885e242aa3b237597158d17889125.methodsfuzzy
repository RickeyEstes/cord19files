The Envision method was performed by using an ICC kit (Beijing Zhengshan Biotech Co.). In our study, the method was better to wax tissue sections rather than cultured cells. So the sections used the Envision method for ICC. The wax sections were dried for 2 h at 37 â€¢ C in an electric drying oven. After the sections were soaked in turn into 1,2-dimethylbenzene solution three times for 30 min, 100% ethanol two times for 20 min, 90-70% ethanol one time for 10 min, respectively, they were washed one time with water and incubated 20 min in a dark room by adding 3% hydrogen peroxide on tissue. The sections were washed one time for 5 min with water and three times with PBS for 15 min. After incubated for 30 min at room temperature by adding 50 l of primary antibodies (PC2, and CPE, preproNPY antibodies diluted into 1:1000 and 1:2000 with PBS solution), the sections were washed three times for 15 min with PBS. After incubated for 30 min at room temperature by adding the secondary antibody (ChemMateTMEnVision+/HRP), the sections were washed three times for 15 min with PBS. 50 l of DAB working solution was added on tissue and incubated for 10 min at room temperature and the sections were washed in water. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and then de-watered in turn with 70-100% ethanol for 10 min each one. The Envision procedure was finished after the sections were soaked into 1,2-dimethylbenzene solution three times for 30 min and mounted with a mounting medium (neutral balsam, Shanghai Biaoben Model Co., China).
