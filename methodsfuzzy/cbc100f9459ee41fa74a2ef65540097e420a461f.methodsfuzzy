Shelter data was provided to, and maintained by, the authors on an annual fiscal basis from program managers, shelter officials, or Board reports for each shelter listed. The calendar year annual shelter reports were generally not publicly available until 2007, when Asilomar Accords (Maddie's Fund, 2011) reporting standards were adopted by five of the six local shelters whose data is included in this report. Data provided by the shelters did not include owner requested euthanasia, quarantine, or dead on arrival cats. Fiscal year (FY) data is provided from July 1st to June 30th of each year. Calendar year (CY) data is based on January to December of each year. City of San Jose, State of California Department of Finance, and US Census Bureau population data was used to determine the human populations of individual cities in the county, which was then used to estimate the number of cats handled per 1,000 humans at the shelters. The euthanasia rate is calculated by dividing the number of cats euthanized by total live intake, less owner requested euthanasia, and dead on arrival, in accordance with Maddie's Fund/Asilomar reporting requirements (Maddie's Fund, 2011) . The Save Rate is calculated by subtracting the euthanasia rate from 100. The euthanasia rate does not include those cats who died of natural causes while in the shelter, which is 1% or less annually. The program requires incoming feral/free roaming cats be held 72 h, and these cats are included in shelter intake numbers. Within 24 h of entering the shelter system the cats are evaluated for inclusion in the SNR program. All cats are scanned for a microchip, however, due to the difficulty of handling feral/fractious cats, most are not scanned thoroughly for a microchip until they are sedated and prepared for surgery. Once the shelter identifies a cat that is healthy, but fractious enough to exclude from the adoption program, it is scheduled for alteration surgery and medical services as quickly as possible, and ideally while the holding period is still in effect. The objective is to move cats out of the shelter system as rapidly as possible. If deemed behaviorally unadoptable and suitably healthy, the cats have the alteration surgery, ear tip removal for identification in the field after return, rabies and common cat disease vaccinations, microchip, and a recovery period at the shelter during the state mandated 72 h hold. Flea/tick treatment, ear cleaning and other minor medical issues, such as abrasions, are also addressed as indicated. Once the cats have recovered from surgery, medical staff approve the cats for release to a non-profit, pursuant to California Food and Agricultural Code 31752, which states in the relevant part: "Any stray cat shall be released to a nonprofit, if requested, prior to the euthanasia of the cat". This non-profit group then returns the cat to their capture site. The criteria to establish whether or not to include a cat in the SNR program are as follows: Friendly (passes behavior) • Approaches handler • Frantically darts about the cage, or may stiffen in place • Not able to get hands on due to striking, lunging, trying to bite There is no upper age limit for a cat to be included in the program provided it is healthy. Kittens may be included in the program at four months of age, or less, if there is an identified caretaker or colony manger, or if the queen is present. Citizens who are turning over trapped cats to the shelter sign a release form that acknowledges SNR, euthanasia, and adoption as any of the possible outcomes for the cat. Cats are not returned to their trapped location in high impact situations, such as hoarding, dangerous conditions, or officially designated wildlife protection areas. When cats are returned to the capture site, door hangers are placed in proximity to the returned cat, advising the neighbors of the program. If a feral cat cannot be returned to the site of capture, it may still be euthanized. This program does not support the relocation of cats to new areas. In the event the cats are a problem to the neighborhood, and there is objection to the cat being returned, mediation is attempted, though not always successfully, through shelter volunteers, rescue partners, and staff, including enforcement when needed.
