Because 281 the total number of localities assumed to be under surveillance has a substantial impact on 282 parameter estimates, we developed a modified version of the likelihood function that accounts 283 for localities that were under surveillance but never observed in the dataset. This approach 284 calculates the likelihood of the observed dataset conditional on the fact that only localities with 285 one or more cases are included (details on the modified likelihood function can be found in 286 Methods and S1 Text). 287 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/677021 doi: bioRxiv preprint We tested the performance of the corrected-denominator method against simulated 288 datasets, looking at the same parameter sets as in the first section. The inferred parameter values 289 cluster well with their corresponding true values ( Fig 3C) : mean percent error in R estimates was 290 8.4% and in λ z estimates was 14.0%. Across the 125 simulations, the true parameter value was 291 included in the 95% CI 116 times (92.8%) for R and 117 times (93.6%) for λ z (S1 Table) . 292 Because an estimate of the true number of localities under surveillance would help 293 determine the size of the population that could be detected for a given system, we assessed how 294 well we could approximate this value. Given the number of localities with one or more cases and 295 the mean parameter estimates, it is possible to calculate the expected total number of localities 296 under surveillance (see S1 Text). Estimates of the true number of localities calculated for the 297 simulated datasets center on the correct value (S2 Fig). The magnitude of estimate error is driven 298 by the spillover rate, which largely determines the proportion of localities that are observed by 299 surveillance. The mean percent error across simulations with spillover rate of 0.0001, 0.00036, 300 and 0.0007 were 25.4%, 7.9%, and 2.4%, respectively, while simulations with spillover rates of 301 0.004 and above almost always recorded at least one case in each locality during the five year 302 surveillance period and therefore tended to estimate the exact true number of localities. 303 Inferring the sources of transmission events. We investigated how well sampled transmission 304 trees recovered the source of individual cases as well as higher-order measures, such as the 305 fraction of cases originating from zoonotic, within-locality, and between-locality transmission. 306 When comparing the overall fraction of cases attributed to each source type (zoonotic 311 versus within-locality versus between-locality transmission), the sampled transmission trees 312 closely match the true transmission patterns (Fig 4) . On average, the difference between the true 313 fraction of cases caused by zoonotic spillover and the fraction inferred in a tree was 0.022 314 (standard deviation 0.018), the difference for within-locality transmission was 0.006 (standard 315 deviation 0.005), and the difference for between-locality transmission was 0.022 (standard 316 deviation 0.018). values. If the fraction of transmissions for each source is perfectly inferred, points will lie exactly 324 on the transition between bar colors. B. Box plots summarize the error in the inferred fraction of 325 cases originating from each source type. The error size is small across all parameter sets, 326 especially for within-locality human-to-human transmission. The upper whisker was calculated 327 as min(max(x), Q 3 +1.5*IQR) and the lower whisker was calculated as max(min(x),Q 1 -1.5*IQR). 328
