Six disinfectants that were commonly used in hospitals in Hong Kong ( Table 2) were analysed for sodium and potassium concentrations in the main chemical pathology laboratory using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 7500c mass spectrometer; Yokogawa Analytical Systems, Japan). Two capillary tubes were prepared for further investigation of analytical interference. The first tube was filled with normal saline, while the second tube contained normal saline contaminated with a small drop of MAH gel. Both tubes were analysed by our POC RP400 analyser. Three different POC blood gas and electrolyte analysers were included in this study. At our hospital, the Rapidpoint 400 and Rapidlab 865 analysers (RP400, RL865; Bayer Healthcare) are used at POC sites and the main chemical pathology laboratory, respectively. The i-STAT 1 analyser (i-STAT; Abbott Diagnostics, USA) is used at POC sites in other hospitals in Hong Kong. Both the RP400 and RL865 analysers use direct ionselective electrode (ISE) technology to measure whole blood sodium and potassium concentrations, while the i-STAT employs a biosensor technology. Six different hand disinfectant products (Table 2) were tested for interference of electrolyte analysis. The test samples were prepared by mixing 500 mL of heparinised whole blood with varying amounts of each hand disinfectant (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 mL), except for MAH gel, where 1000 mL of heparinised whole blood was used with the same varying amounts of gel. The reason for this was because all three analysers produced substantially greater errors with MAH gel. The sodium and potassium concentrations of each contaminated sample were measured in duplicate and mean values were used for statistical analysis. The coefficients of variation (CV) of the measurements were within the previously established precision limits of the analysers. Student's t test was applied for assessing any significant difference between various measurements and analysers. A p value ,0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All probabilities were two tailed.
