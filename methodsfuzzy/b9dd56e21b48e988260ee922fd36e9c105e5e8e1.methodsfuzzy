The rats examined belonged to three inhalation studies and one intratracheal instillation study. In the first study (Study A, table 1) 720 female Iva: WIWU Wistar rats in eight groups were exposed in steel wire cages to diluted coal oven exhaust gas or clean air (control) for an average of 16 h/day, 5 d/week over a maximum period of 22 months. In the first 9 months of the study the animals were subjected to an exposure atmosphere of 0.3 Ilg B(a)P/m 3 • During a following one month period the animals inhaled diluted coal oven exhaust gas without any addition and in the final 12 months the B(a)P concentration after the addition of pyrolized pitch effluent to the coal oven exhaust gas was about 90 Ilg/m3. Three of the groups exposed to coal oven flue gas as well as three control groups received additional treatments with crocidolite (20 x 0.5 mg, intratracheal) or two different concentrations ofDB(ah)A (20 x 0.25 or 20 x 0.5 mg, subcutaneoulsy). Out of the 720 rats 661 were examined histologically. For details of study design see HEINRICH et al. (l986b) . In the second study (Study BI and B2, table 2 and table 3 ) 1296 female Crl:[WI] BR Wi star rats in 9 groups were exposed to PAH-rich coal tar/pitch condensation aerosol (adjusted to different B(a)p-contents) for 17 h/day and 5 d/week. The aerosol was generated by heating hard coal/tar pitch to 750°C under nitrogen atmosphere and diluting the high temperature tar/pitch vapour with 12°C clean air.

Three groups inhaled exclusively tar/pitch condensation aerosols of different B(a)P concentrations (20 Ilg/m3, 50 Ilg/m3 and 125 Ilg/m3), three groups were exposed to an aerosol (50 Ilg/m3 B(aP) supplemented with carbon black (2 mg/m3 or 6 mg/m3) or an irritant gas mixture (sulphur dioxide, nitric dioxide, formaldehyde). Three groups exclusively received clean air or irritant gas or carbon black (6 mg/m3). One half of the rats of each of the nine groups was exposed for 10 months followed by a 20 months clean air recovery period (Study Bl). The second half of each exposure group was exposed for 20 months followed by clean air for 10 months (Study B2). All rats were examined histologically. For details of study design see HEINRICH et al. (l994a) and HEINRICH et al.
