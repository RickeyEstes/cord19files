To assess the na√Øve innate response to virus we recruited women who had never been vaccinated to H1N1pdm09. Twelve pregnant women (non-vaccinated) (PNV) and 10 healthy nonpregnant women (non-vaccinated) (NPNV), recruited from October 2012-October 2013, participated in this study. Pregnant women were recruited from the John Hunter Hospital (JHH) antenatal clinics and non-pregnant women were recruited by advertisement. Inclusion criteria for all participants were females of child-bearing age (18-40 years) . Pregnant women were recruited from any trimester. Women were excluded if they had any concomitant chronic medical illness, drug or alcohol dependence, currently smoking, if they had asthma or other respiratory conditions or if they had cold/flu symptoms within the four weeks prior to sample collection. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to sample collection and ethics approval was obtained from the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee and the University of Newcastle Research Ethics Committee. Pregnant and nonpregnant women attended a single study visit at which baseline characterisation was assessed and venepuncture was performed. [17] [18] [19] . Stock viral concentrations were measured using plaque assays; which determines live virions based on plaque forming units per ml (pfu/ml) [17] [18] [19] . Ultra-violet (UV) inactivation of live viruses was achieved by placing live viruses directly under a UV lamp (254nm) for 3hrs. Successful inactivation was confirmed by plaque assays.
