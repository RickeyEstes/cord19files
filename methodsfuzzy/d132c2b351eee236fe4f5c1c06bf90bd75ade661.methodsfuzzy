Study population Every 2 months, 6000 volunteers from the PRIMO cohort in Beijing were checked for early signs of acute HIV-1 infection, as described previously [12] . In addition, their plasmas were collected and tested for HIV-1 antibodies and HIV-1 RNA levels. Amongst them, 178 individuals were diagnosed with acute HIV-1 infection, and another 196 volunteers, who were HIV-1negative, were enrolled in the control group. Every 3 months, thereafter, from detection of seronversion, whole blood specimens were collected. Following blood collection, plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated for further studies. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Beijing You'An Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
