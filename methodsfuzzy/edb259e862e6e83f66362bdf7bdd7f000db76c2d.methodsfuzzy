In 2004 a preliminary literature search resulted in twentynine criteria related to the management of the maintenance of medical TSs. Discussion meetings with several experts (i.e., two medical information scientists, one terminology expert/ontologist and one software engineer) were organized to analyze and categorize these criteria. Consensus results were captured in a draft version of the framework. This draft version was evaluated via a first questionnaire by the maintainers of 27 TSs and the results were published in Raiez et al., 2005 . 27 The extensive literature search described in the previous paragraph was performed to identify additional criteria for the maintenance process. Again, discussion meetings with the experts were held to identify and organize the final set of criteria and to develop the final version of the framework. The framework categorizes the components of the mainte-nance process and provides criteria and requirements for designing the maintenance process of medical TSs.
