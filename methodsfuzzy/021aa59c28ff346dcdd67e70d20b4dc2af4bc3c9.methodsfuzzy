Suppose that the vector of the subjective weight, given by the decision makers directly, is The vector of the objective weight, computed by Eq. (12)  The subjective weight and objective weight are assembled by nonlinear weighted comprehensive method. Based on the multiplier effect, the greater the value of the objective weight and subjective weight are, the greater the combined weight is, or vice versa. Furthermore, we can know that the Eq. (13) breaks through the limitation of only considering either subjective or objective influence. The superiority of Eq. (13) is that the rankings of alternatives and the parameter weights can show both the objective information and the subjective information. In the following, we will apply the WDBA, CODAS and similarity measure methods to interval-valued fuzzy soft sets. 5.2.1. The MABAC method and its limitation Remark 5.1. However, we can find that the above algorithm will meet the counterintuitive phenomena when − t ij or + t ij is 0. That is to say, it only determines by one of them to make decision and decision information of others can be omitted. x 3 X. Peng, H. Garg Computers & Industrial Engineering 119 (2018) 439-452 5.2.2. The similarity method and its limitation Remark 5.2. According to above algorithm, one can establish an approach to make decision. However, the limiting condition that the probability of equality of final decision results is great. That is to say, we can hardly make decision. Example 5.3. Suppose that we invite another expert to evaluate the coal mine in Example 5.3. The weight information given by expert has the prior weight set given by his/her prior experience or preference: . The assessments for emergency plans arising from questionnaire investigation to the expert are different, which is shown in Table 5 . The final decision results and ranking are shown in Table 6 . Based on the above discussion in Remarks 6.1 and 6.2, we know that the unreasonable results for MABAC method owe to the "0" problem. From Fig. 4 , we observe that the proposed algorithms (WDBA, CODAS and similarity measure) are moderately correlated with similarity measure and MABAC ) (90%). The reason for such variation is implicit from the nature of formulation used by each of these methods. To further demonstrate the strength of our algorithms, we compare them to existing methods . Fig. 5 shows the comparison of these five methods which clarifies the power of proposed algorithms better in distinguishing the optimal alternative and obtain the optimal alternative without counterintuitive phenomena. In Fig. 6 , we can find that the proposed weight determining model can effectively reflect the subjective information and objective information, but the combined weight proposed by can't reveal the difference compared with the given weight Table 5 The tabular form of interval-valued fuzzy soft set F E ( , ) in Example 5.3. Algorithm 5. Similarity measure 1: It is similar to 1-3 in Algorithm 1. information. That is to say, our weight determining model can illustrate the data law given by expert, not limit to the known subjective weight. (Yang et al., 2009 ) and its limitation Algorithm 6. choice values (Yang et al., 2009) 1: It is similar to Steps 1-2 in Algorithm 1. 2: Compute the interval fuzzy choice value c i for each alternative x i Feng et al. (2010) , the "interval fuzzy choice value" presented by Yang et al. (2009) is just the sum of membership degrees and non-membership of an alternative with respect to all parameters, interval fuzzy choice value can't be interpreted as the number of the parameter satisfied by the alternative. It can be seen as a synthesized measure to size up each alternative by a fusion of all parameters. However, this direct addition of all the membership values and non-membership values with respect to diverse parameters is not always rational. In fact, it just like the addition of weight and height. The following example will illustrate that algorithm in Yang et al. (2009) may not be successfully applied to some soft decision making problems. Example 5.5. Suppose that F E ( , ) is an interval-valued fuzzy soft set and Table 7 gives its tabular representation with choice values and scores. From Table 7 , we can find that the scores of all alternatives are identical, in other words, all of them could be selected as the best choice by algorithm in Yang et al. (2009) . Hence, it is unreasonable in current case. But in fact, we can achieve an optimal alternative by our pioneered algorithms and the existing algorithms . Suppose that we use Eq. (13) to determine the objective weight instead of combined weight by our algorithms and use Eq. (7) in to determine the objective weight instead of combined weight by Peng and Dai's algorithms . Meanwhile, assume that there is no discriminative power of cost parameters and benefit parameters, i.e., we think that the parameters are benefit parameters. Therefore, we can have the decision results by our algorithms and the existing algorithms , which is presented in Table 8 . (Feng et al., 2010) and its limitation Definition 5.6 (Feng et al., 2010 Table 9 , we can find that the choice values of all alternatives are identical, in other words, all of them could be selected as the best choice by algorithm in Feng et al. (2010) . Hence, it is unreasonable in current case. But in fact, we can achieve an optimal alternative by our pioneered algorithms and the existing algorithms . Suppose that we use Eq. (13) to determine the objective weight instead of combined weight by our algorithms and use Eq. (7) in to determine the objective weight instead of combined weight by Peng and Dai's algorithms . Meanwhile, assume that there is no discriminative power of cost parameters and benefit parameters, i.e., we think that the parameters are benefit parameters. Therefore, we can have the decision results by our algorithms and the existing algorithms (Feng et al., 2010; , which is presented in Table 10 . (Yuan & Hu, 2012 ) and its limitation Definition 5.9 (Yuan and Hu, 2012) . Let U be an initial unverse, E be a parameter set, k , then we say the lower membership of x i related to ε j is less than the lower membership of x k , its corresponding characteristic function is given as follows: Definition 5.10 (Yuan and Hu, 2012) . Let U be an initial unverse, E be a parameter set, ⊆ A E F A . ( , ) is an interval-valued fuzzy soft set on U. If ⩽ k , then we say the upper membership of x i related to ε j is less than the upper membership of x k , its corresponding characteristic function is given as follows: Definition 5.11 (Yuan and Hu, 2012) . The comparison table of intervalvalued fuzzy soft set means that row numbers and column numbers are equal. C ik is given as follows: Yuan and Hu (2012) cannot be applied to IVFSS based decision making in some cases. Example 5.13 . Assume that F E ( , ) is an intervalvalued fuzzy soft set. Then Table 11 gives its tabular representation and their decision results.From Table 11 , we can find that the score values of all alternatives are identical, in other words, all of them could be selected as the best choice by algorithm in Yuan and Hu (2012) . Hence, it is unreasonable in current case. But in fact, we can achieve an optimal alternative by our proposed algorithms and the existing algorithms . Suppose that we use Eq.

Meanwhile, assume that there is no discriminative power of cost parameters and benefit parameters, i.e., we think that the parameters are benefit parameters. Therefore, we can have the decision results by our algorithms and the existing algorithms Yuan & Hu, 2012) , which is presented in Table 12 .
