Cells and viruses . The JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM), kindly supplied by Dr S . Weiss, was used in all studies . The virus was plaque-purified twice and grown in the 17CL-1 line of BALB/c 3T3 cells (also obtained from Dr S . Weiss) in Dulbecco's MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum . Virus titer was 2-6x 106 PFU/ml as determined by plaque assay on 17CL-1 or L-2 cells . L-2 cells, generously supplied by Dr J . Leibowitz, were also grown in Dulbecco's MEM with 10% fetal calf serum . Animals . Pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories) were used in all studies . All mice were screened for prior MHV-JHM infection using an indirect immunofluorescence assay and all were antibody-negative prior to experimental manipulation . Female mice were immunized weekly for 5 weeks with MHV-JHM in Freund's adjuvant prior to mating . At 10 days of age, the offspring of immunized mice were inoculated intranasally with 2-6x10°PFU in 10 µl . To titer virus from infected animals, each organ of interest was placed in Dulbecco's MEM and sonicated to near homogeneity . Large particles were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 g. Virus was titered on 17CL-1 or L-2 cells, with nearly equivalent results . The virus neutralization titer of mice sera was determined by a constant virus-variable serum plaque reduction assay . 23 Immunoperoxidase studies . Animals were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) via intracardiac puncture . Isolated organs were embedded in Tissue-Tek II O .C .T . medium (Miles Laboratory) and frozen in liquid nitrogen . Sections were prepared and fixed with methanol containing 0 .3% hydrogen peroxide. The sections were treated sequentially with normal horse serum, with rabbit polyclonal antivirus antibody at a dilution of 1 :50 or 1 :100, then with biotinylated goat antirabbit antibody at a dilution of 1 :100 or 1 :200 and finally with Vectastain ABC (Vector Laboratories) . The slides were developed by exposure to diaminobenzidine (0 .8 mg/ml) in hydrogen peroxide (0 .01%) . The slides were air-dried, mounted and examined under the light microscope . Slides were briefly counterstained with hematoxylin prior to examination . No staining was observed if normal rabbit serum was substituted for the antivirus antibody or if brains from uninfected mice were used instead of infected brains . Immunofluorescence assay . 17CL-1 cells were infected on coverslips with MHV-JHM at a m .o .i . of 1 . After 12 hours, the cells were fixed with methanol and reacted with antisera from unimmunized or immunized mice at various dilutions . After washing, the coverslips were treated with fluoroscein conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG diluted 1 :200 and examined using a fluorescent microscope . Light and electron microscopy . For light or electron microscopy, animals were perfused with 10% formalin or 3% glutaraldehyde via intracardiac injection . For light microscopy, the isolated organs were embedded in paraffin, cut into 4-10 pm sections and stained with either hematoxylin and eosin or Luxol Fast Blue . For transmission electron microscopy, the organs were fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde, post fixed with osmium tetroxide, dehydrated and embedded in Epon . Thin sections for electron microscopy were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined using a Hitachi H-600 electron microscope . We thank Drs James Bale, Jr, C .
