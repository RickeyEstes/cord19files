Three key steps are the backbone of the viral IRES prediction system (VIPS): 1) RNA folding, 2) RNA secondary structure comparison and 3) pknotsRG program. First, RNAL fold program functions to predict the RNA secondary structure using the minimum free energy method [17] . Next, the RNA secondary structure comparison matches the known IRES structures executed by RNA Align program [18] . Finally, the pknotsRG calculates the pseudoknot score from potential IRES structures [15] . In our designed VIPS, the primary RNA sequence input in the search flowchart (see Figure 1 ), with default length parameter (L=250, previous results [7] ), is transferred as a raw RNA sequences into RNAL fold input format by perl scripts (UTR2SQ.pl and utr_dp.pl) (Methods S1) [7] . The Start_analyze.pl is the major control batch program to link each stage of VIPS. In RNA align software, two factors are considered to evaluate the IRES elements that can be predicted by our VIPS, distance score (DIST) and alignment match length (ALEN). DIST represents the score of secondary structure in comparison with the default score of each RNA structure (base-deletion, base-mismatch, arc-mismatch, areremoving, arc-altering and arc-breaking) adopted in RNA align software. Because DIST value will increase concomitantly with longer alignment length, DIST score fails to specify the significance of matched structures from shorter and bigger alignment sequences. Therefore, DIST and ALEN are transformed into a ratio which is defined as R= ALEN/DIST [7] . The R values are collected from all predicted IRES elements including known IRES and potential candidate IRES elements. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) analyzes all R values to make a discriminant line that distinguishes candidate IRES group and non-IRES group. The error rate of VIPS is estimated in comparison of known IRES structures with candidate IRES elements. All parameters were succeeded from our previous IRSS setting [7] . The output data of RNAL fold program is retransformed into RNA Align format by B2RA.pl program (Methods S1). For RNA view, B2CT.pl (Methods S1) changes the predicted RNA secondary structure into "connect file format" (*.ct) which will read by RnaViz [19] to display in screen and print. Two output files, Aligned structure and Alignment score files, were generated by RNA Align software. 2 statistical programs, DIST.R and sort.R, were applied to select all predicted RNA structures with R scores higher than best cut-off value [7] . The perl script, run_pknotsRG.pl, re-formats all candidate RNA structure into input format of pknotsRG software (Methods S1). All of the output results of RNA Align and pknotsRG software were evaluated their value by statistic programs. The predicted figure of RNAL fold program and text results of RNA Align and pknotsRG software were showed as web page while their values are higher than cut-off value. The VIPS has been implanted with known IRES elements as standard structures. For example, twelve IRES models were built upon the consensus sequences in Rfam database. consensus secondary sequences are the major templates for RNA fold program, a part of VIPS. In VIPS, if the RNAL fold program predicted an IRES element that cannot match any IRES models of Rfam or fetch at least two homolog IRESs from related species, the input data will be discarded. To evaluate the precision of VIPS, known IRES elements, such as in the IRES database (http://www.iresite.org), and the IRES elements of HCV domain III (accession number: AF177037), poliovirus (accession number: V01149), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV; accession number: X87335), and cricket paralysis virus (accession number: AF218039), were input in the VIPS as training data. Also, the entire UTR database (UTRdb, http://www.ba.itb.cnr.it/UTR/) and a part of viral database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) sequences were input into the VIPS to estimate the accuracy of IRES prediction. The distribution of pseudoknot value of pknotsRG plus the R value of VIPS were analyzed to make a discriminant line that distinguishes candidate IRES group and non-IRES group for each IRES type. The experimental IRES elements of IRES database were applied to compare with the results of UTR database searched by VIPS. The error rate of VIPS was therefore calculated to assess the accuracy of VIPS. Finally, randomly selected 500 virus genome data from NCBI were applied to test VIPS to predict IRES elements of whole viral genomes (Data not showed). The VIPS web service has been built in Linux platform in IBM server X3400. The automatic batch system will execute the customers' requests and run through all programs ( Figure 1 ) to compare four individual IRES type plus pseudoknot parameters and create a plain text file will be sent back through email to the user due to long CPU running time.
