This was an ecologic study of the time series of RSV monthly positivity in samples tested using the influenza sentinel surveillance system ("SIVEP-Gripe" -SIVEPflu), with the purpose of identifying seasonal patterns in the five regions of Brazil from 2005-2012. The temporal trend of the rates of monthly hospitalisation for bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants under 5 years of age, in the same regions and period, was also analysed. All five administrative regions of Brazil were chosen as local of study because they present different socioeconomic and environmental patterns which may influence on virus circulation. The climate in the Midwest region (14, 993, 194 inhabitants) is predominantly tropical, with a rainy season between November and March (monthly rainfall between 13.1-255.6 × 10-3 m) and temperatures ranging 22.0-26.4ºC. The Northeast region (55,794,694 inhabitants) has a semiarid climate in the interior and a tropical Atlantic climate near the coast, where the majority of the population is concentrated, with a monthly rainfall ranging 46.4-281.4 × 10-3 m and a low temperature range (monthly average of 25.1-27.3ºC). The North region (16,983,485 inhabitants) has an equatorial climate with rainfall throughout the year (monthly rainfall between 74.4-303.9 × 10-3 m) and low thermal amplitude (averages 26.3-28.0ºC). The Southeast region (84,465,579 inhabitants) has a predominantly altitude tropical climate with rainfall concentrated between November and March (monthly rainfall between 28.2-285.6 × 10-3 m) and a slightly higher thermal amplitude (monthly average between 18.7-24.6ºC). Finally, the Southern region (28,795,762 inhabitants) has a predominantly subtropical climate with rainfall distributed throughout the year (monthly rainfall between 101.1-198.9 × 10-3 m) and lower temperatures between May and September (monthly average between 14.9-23.1ºC). Influenza sentinel surveillance system data (SIVEP-Gripe) -The laboratory data were obtained from SIVEP-Gripe, which has 128 sentinel surveillance units distributed throughout all the regions of Brazil. The surveillance units record at least five samples of nasopharyngeal secretions weekly from patients with influenzalike illness (measured fever associated with sore throat and/or cough without age group distinction). Samples are processed by using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), including tests for influenza A and B; parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3; adenovirus; and RSV. The study variables included place of residence, age, and positive and negative IIF results for RSV. The laboratory positivity indicator was calculated using the results of the IIF reaction of the nasopharyngeal secretion samples: monthly positivity of IIF reaction for RSV, relative to the total of monthly valid tests, i.e., excluding the results within inadequate samples (not enough biological material, improper storage, correct material in the sample) or inconclusive results (no valid results). Because in some regions the number of samples was low until 2004 (Freitas et al. 2013) , samples from 2005-2012 were selected for analysis. Hospitalisation data -The hospitalisation data were obtained from the Hospital Information System of the Ministry of Health, which includes all the admissions made by the Brazilian Public Health System through Hospitalisation Authorisation. These data include over 75% of all hospitalisations in Brazil. The hospitalisation causes with a possible association to RSV were selected. These are codified in the information system as RSVassociated pneumonia, RSV-associated acute bronchitis, RSV-associated acute bronchiolitis and unspecified acute bronchiolitis, with the following respective codes from the International Disease Classification, CID-10: J12.1, J20.5, J21.0 and J21.9. The hospitalisation rates were calculated by dividing the number of admissions of infants less than 5 years old (under the aforementioned causes) by the annual population in the same age range, estimated by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. The hospitalisation and population data were obtained from the Informatics Department of the Brazilian Public Health System. Time series -Wavelet and Fourier analysis -Initially, plots were made to visualise time parameters and seasonal trends. The IIF positivity proportions of nasopharyngeal secretion from laboratory data and hospitalisation rates were analysed using the wavelet technique for identifying periodic patterns of RSV occurrence and associated morbidity. Wavelet analysis provides information on the time-scale domain for stationary and nonstationary events, allowing for simultaneous localisation of time and of high and low frequencies. Subtle time patterns of occurrence of phenomena of different nature can be detected, as well as changes in its periodicity. Wavelet analysis permits inferences regarding the way continuous variables relate to different frequencies and whether this relationship changes over time (Torrence & Compo 1998 , Cazelles et al. 2007 ). The algorithms described by Torrence and Compo (1998) , available in free software were used (Alonso & McCormick 2012) . This analysis allows establishing whether a specific periodic phenomenon has a stationary frequency, a basic assumption required in Fourier analysis. Next, the laboratory and hospitalisation data were analysed through Fourier time series decomposition using sinusoidal harmonics of the annual and semi-annual cycles. Fourier analysis considers every period to have a periodic stable frequency throughout time. This method allows analysing signals and systems through decomposition of periodic functions in convergent trigonometric series (sin and cos). In this case, it allowed identifying the time of annual and biannual peaks of the time series analysed through multiple linear regression. The possible occurrence of seasonal heterogeneity within the administrative regions was verified through Fourier analysis of the individual hospitalisation data of each state. Since the sole purpose of this study was the analysis of seasonality, secular trends in mortality and hospitalisations were corrected by means of polynomial regression to improve the regression fit. Analysis of RSV transmission annual seasons -The probable annual stations of greater RSV circulation were defined based on the laboratory-based positivity indicator of the samples. This indicator (monthly positive samples/ total of monthly valid samples) was used to define annual seasons of RSV as the five consecutive months in which higher IIF positivity was observed. This definition is consistent with the prophylaxis of five consecutive monthly doses of palivizumab, as recommended by the Brazilian Pediatric Society (SBP 2011) . This criterion, with minor changes, has been used before to study RSV and influenza through analysis of monthly and weekly data, and has been shown to be adequate for the study of seasonality (Chiu et al. 2002 , Bloom-Feshbach et al. 2013 . Fourier and wavelets analysis were performed using Matlab (Mathworks Inc.) software EPIPOI® (Alonso & McCormick 2012) . Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v. 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) software, and the plots were constructed using Microsoft Office 2013 (Microsoft Corporation). The research was approved by Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Campinas (number 909/2013).
