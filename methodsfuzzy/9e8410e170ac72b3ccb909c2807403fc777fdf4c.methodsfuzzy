We extracted interactions between non-human mammals and their pathogens from the enhanced infectious diseases database (EID2) [19] . These interactions formed a bipartite network with nodes represented hosts and pathogens, and links indicated whether pathogens have been found in hosts. We further checked these interactions to ascertain whether the putative pathogens caused a disease or an opportunistic infection in at least one species of mammal (including humans). This resulted in 16 548 species-level host-pathogen interactions between 3986 pathogen species (bacteria = 885, fungi = 251, helminth = 1000, protozoa = 404 and virus = 1446) and 1560 non-human mammalian species. We projected this bipartite network into a unipartite network where nodes represented host species and edges quantified shared pathogens. The motivation behind this projection is twofold: (i) it enabled us to investigate dynamics of pathogen sharing via ecological network analysis tools [9, 11] , and (ii) it facilitated identification of important non-human mammalian species via centrality measures. In addition to the network encompassing all pathogen taxa (including fungi), we generated eight additional networks: bacteria (including Gram variable), Gram+ bacteria, Gramâˆ’ bacteria, helminths, protozoa, viruses (including retro-transcribing), DNA viruses and RNA viruses. Prions were not included in this study (electronic supplementary material, note S1 lists further information). We computed various network statistics to contrast key aspects of pathogen sharing across our selected taxa (table 1). These included: transitivity (if two nodes are connected, the probability that their neighbours are also connected); density (the proportion of potential connections in a network that are actual connections); and modularity (the number of edges falling within groups minus the expected number in an equivalent network with edges placed at random [20] ). We also calculated network-level E-I index based on species orders. Given a categorical node attribute describing mutually exclusive groups (in our case, order), the E-I index represents a ratio of external (with other orders) to internal (within order) edges. A positive network-level E-I index indicates a tendency of hosts to share pathogens with species outside their order (i.e. extrovert), whereas a negative E-I index indicates a tendency to share pathogens within orders (i.e. introvert).
