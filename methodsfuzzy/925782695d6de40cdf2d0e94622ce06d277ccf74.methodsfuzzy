In November 2015, severe watery diarrhea was reported in newborn piglets (3-5 days of age). Samples were submitted to Diagnostic and Prevention Research Institute for Human and Animal Diseases for diagnostic testing. ELISA and PCR diagnostic kits were used to detect the following: TGEV and RVA, ELISA; ASFV, ELISA and PCR; PCV2, PCR; CSFV, PCR; and TGEV/PRCV, PCR; were used according to manufacturer recommendation (Vetbiochim, Moscow, Russia). RNA extraction was performed with GeneJET Viral DNA/RNA Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Once RVB was identified by NGS, subsequent samples were tested using RVB primers by PCR (VP4-I-823-842-F: CGTATCCAAAGCCAACGGGA and VP4-I-1008-1028-R: TGGGCCCTTATTTTCCAGTGT), which were designed using the primer-BLAST online software and Buryat15 VP4 sequence KU744407. Synthesis of cDNA was performed according to a random primer protocol using RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). PCR was carried out using True-Start DNA polymerase with 10 mM dNTPs mix (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Fecal samples from diarrheic piglets were diluted 1:10 in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 1% actinomycin and 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) and clarified by centrifugation. Supernatants were filtered through 0.8 µm, 0.45 µm and 0.2 µm syringe filters sequentially, serial diluted, and added to five-day old monolayers of Vero, Swine testicular cells (ST) and porcine kidney 15 (PK-15). Six blind passages were performed with the cell lines and supernatants were saved at −70 • C. To establish pathogenicity of the unknown virus, a single ten-day-old conventionally raised piglet was infected with 0.2 µm filtered, 1:10 diluted fecal sample while a single piglet was mock-infected with MEM. The two piglets were comingled to demonstrate transmission of pathological agent between piglets under experimental conditions. The sample was tested for the absence of bacterial contamination by seeding the filtered dilutions on blood agar plates. Piglets were monitored every 30 min for clinical signs of diarrhea. The piglets were sacrificed after the onset of diarrhea, and intestinal samples were collected. For NGS, previously extracted RNA underwent cDNA synthesis according to random primer protocol was performed on RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo scientific). PCR was carried out using True-Start DNA polymerase with 10 mM dNTPs mix and 10 pmol specific primers per reaction (Thermo Scientific), according to manufacturer's protocols. TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit was used with 1 µg total RNA for the construction of libraries according to the manufacturer's protocol. For rRNA-depleted library, rRNA was removed from 2.5 µg total RNA using Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (mixture 1:1 Human/Mouse/Rat probe and Bacteria probe), according to the manufacturer's protocol (with probe concentration for epidemiology kit protocol). All cDNA libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), producing 101 × 7 × 101 bp paired-end reads with multiplexing. Reads were trimmed using default parameters with CLC Genomics Workbench 8.5.1 (Qiagen Bioinformatics, Redwood City, CA, USA). Trimmed reads were de novo assembled using a word size of 64, bubble size of 100, and minimum contig length of 300. The contigs were subject to the BLASTN search. RVB sequences were deposited into GenBank with the accession numbers KU744406 (VP3), KU744407 (VP4), KX869730-KX869737 (VP1, VP6, VP7, NSP1-NSP5), and MH093644 (VP2). The newly generated RVB sequences were aligned using MUSCLE in Geneious (version 9.6.1, Newark, NJ, USA) [33] with porcine RVB sequences that had at least 80% of the open reading frame available in GenBank (Supplementary Tables S1-S11). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were made with the RAxML method using a Generalized Time Reversible gamma model of nucleotide substitution and 500 bootstrap replicates. The swine RVB G12 strains were translated and aligned with Buryat15 to compare the 21 predicted antigenic sites of RVB VP7 [24] .
