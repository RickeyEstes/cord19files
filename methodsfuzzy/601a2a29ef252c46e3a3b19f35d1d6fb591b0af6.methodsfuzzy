Ketimine can be prepared in high yield using aryl ketone diethyl ketals and arylamines, while alkylamines give only low yields (Scheme 8) [54] . Similarly, imines can react with higher boiling point amines to give the exchange products. The latter can be distilled driving the equilibrium towards the formation of the desired product [55] .
