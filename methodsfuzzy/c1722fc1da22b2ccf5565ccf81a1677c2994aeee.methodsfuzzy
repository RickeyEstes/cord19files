Cell culture and treatment. The human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 was used for in vitro experiments. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco, NY, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μ g/ml streptomycin in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO 2 in air at 37 °C. The cells were treated with different concentrations of neutrophil elastase (Merck Group, Darmstadt, Germany) and/or EGCG (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) for 24 h and then evaluated as described below. Cell viability assay. Cell viability was determined using a Cell Titer 96 ® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS assay, Promega, Madison, WI, USA). A549 cells were seeded on 96-well plates at a density of 5000 cells/well and were allowed to adhere for 36 h. After incubation in neutrophil elastase and/or EGCG for 24 h, 10 μ l of the MTS solution was added to each well, followed by incubation for 2 h at 37 °C. The resulting color was assayed at 490 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). In vitro wound healing assay. The wound healing assay was performed as previously described (Liang et al., 2007) to assess the capacity for cell migration. Briefly, the A549 cells were seeded on a 6-well plate. When the cells reached 90-95% confluence, scratches were applied using a sterile 200-μ l pipette tip. The cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and the initial wounds were examined under an Olympus microscope. Then, the cells were incubated in medium containing neutrophil elastase and/or EGCG for 24 h, and the wounds were photographed again. The rate of cell migration was evaluated based on the rate of wound closure. Transwell migration assay. Cell migration was further investigated using the transwell migration assay. A549 cells were suspended in serum-free DMEM (1×10 5 cells) and placed in the upper chamber. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h, followed by fixation of the cells in 4% formaldehyde. The upper chamber was gently wiped with a cotton swab to remove the non-migrated cells, and the migrated cells on the underside of the polycarbonate filter were stained with crystal violet and counted under an Olympus microscope (×200 magnification). Immunofluorescence assay. A549 cells were seeded on glass coverslips in an environment containing 5% CO 2 in air at 37 °C and then incubated in 10 nM neutrophil elastase and 20 μ M EGCG for an additional 24 h. The coverslips were gently washed in PBS, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min and blocked in PBS containing 3% BSA for 30 min. The fixed cells were incubated in an anti-human zinc finger E-box-binding protein-1 (ZEB-1) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber. Then, the cells were washed and incubated in the corresponding DyLight 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing in PBS, the cells were incubated in Hoechst 33342 (1 μ g/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at room Scientific RepoRts | 5:11494 | DOi: 10.1038/srep11494 temperature. After several washes, the immunostained specimens were observed under a TCS-SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
