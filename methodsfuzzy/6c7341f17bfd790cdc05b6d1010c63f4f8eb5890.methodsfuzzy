The protocol for ALIC 4  ALIC 4 E is a European multi-national, multi-centre, open-labelled, non-industry funded, pragmatic, adaptive-platform, randomised controlled trial (RCT). Initial trial arms will be best usual primary care, and best usual primary care plus treatment with oseltamivir for five days. We aim to recruit at least 2500 participants ≥1 year old presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI), with symptom duration ≤72 hours in primary care over three consecutive periods of confirmed high influenza incidence. Participant outcomes will be followed-up to 28 days by diary and telephone. The primary objective is to determine whether adding antiviral treatment to best usual primary care is effective in reducing time to return to usual daily activity with fever, head-and muscle-ache reduced to minor severity or less. Secondary objectives include estimating cost-effectiveness, benefits in subgroups according to age (<12, 12-64, >64 years), severity of symptoms (low, medium, high), comorbidity (yes/no), and duration of symptoms (≤48hours/>48-72 hours), complications (hospital admission and pneumonia), use of additional prescribed medication including antibiotics, and use of overthe-counter medicines and self-management of ILI symptoms.

Additional manuscripts will be report secondary outcomes, and be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

The ALIC 4 E trial will be delivered as work package (WP) 4 of the Platform for European Preparedness Against (Re-) emerging Epidemics (PREPARE: www.prepare-europe.eu/) consortium grant. PREPARE is a European Commission funded network for the rapid and efficient delivery of harmonised, large-scale clinical research studies on infectious diseases (ID) 19 . ALIC 4 E will be a randomised controlled trial of investigational medicinal products (CTIMP) in primary care that will determine the clinical-and cost-effectiveness of adding antiviral agents to best usual primary care for patients with specific characteristics suffering from ILI, and thus enable clinicians to better individualise prescribing decisions. The primary objective of ALIC 4 E is therefore to determine whether adding antiviral treatment to best usual primary care is effective in reducing time taken to return to usual daily activity in patients with ILI. Secondary objectives will be to determine whether antiviral treatment is cost-effective; benefits pre-specified subgroups of participants; decreases hospital admissions; decreases complications related to ILI, especially pneumonia; improves the health-related quality of life; decreases (repeat) attendance at the GP, or other health services; decreases time to first reduction, time to alleviation, and new/worsening of ILI symptoms; reduces the use of over the counter (OTC) and prescribed medication, including antibiotics, and; affects the self-management of ILI symptoms.
