The sequence of SCV helicase (576 aminoacid residues with NCBI Accession No. NP_828870) [10] was aligned with that of representatives of the other groups of coronavirus. Sequence alignment of SCV helicase with other coronavirus helicases were obtained using program ClustalW v.1.8 [11] . The ATP binding site motif was predicted with MotifScan software available at the Expasy web-site [12] . Secondary structure prediction and fold recognition studies were performed by using PsiPred v.2.1 [13] and Pyre v.0. 2 [14] , respectively. Using the fold recognition method the helicase of SARS Coronavirus (SwissProt Accession ID P59641) [15] identifies the 1UAA pdb entry [16] . Model building of the major domain (494 aminoacids) of SARS helicase was carried out using ClustalW v.1.8 [11] alignment between the target sequence and that of the template structure. Models were subsequently optimized according to secondary structure predictions. Substitution of aminoacid residues and modeling of insertions and deletions in the target structure were performed using DeepView v.3.7 software [17] . The 3D models were optimized by a 900 step minimization run with AMBER [18] and finally validated with the PROCHECK v.3.5.4 procedure [19] and PROSAII v.4.0 software [20] . A model of the metal binding domain (MBD) was obtained using DYANA v.1.5 software [21] . The insertion of zinc atoms was carried out using GROMACS v.3.2 [22] software using the force field ffgmx43a2 that allows a molecular minimization of this domain with the bound metal atoms. To investigate the structure of MBD and helicase domain, a docking simulation was performed using ESCHER software [23] . A first coarse run with a rotation step of 10°was carried out and approximately 500 results were collected. Only those models that were consistent with the available experimental data were subjected to a second run with a rotation step of 2°between ± 20°of the starting position in order to refine the most probable structures. The major side-chain clashes were removed by a 900 cycles minimization in the AMBER force Field [18] .
