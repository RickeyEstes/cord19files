Phytopthora ramorum sampling and microsatellite genotyping A total of 813 isolates of P. ramorum were collected, mostly from bay laurel and occasionally from coast live oak and tanoak in 60 forests stands across 13 California counties (Alameda, San Mateo, Sonoma, Napa, Santa Cruz, Monterey, Humboldt, Marin, Santa Clara, Solano, Mendocino, Contra Costa and San Francisco) between 2002 and 2010 ( Fig. 1) . Additionally, the analysis included 14 samples collected from 12 nurseries in 12 US States in 2004, and 5 samples collected from a California nursery located near one of the two sites that were identified as the source of the entire California epidemic in Mascheretti et al. (2008) . For some localities, only a single sample was available. Figure 1 and Supplemental Table 1 show the localities where the samples were collected. P. ramorum was cultured and isolated from the symptomatic portion of leaves and DNA extracted as previously described (Mascheretti et al. 2008 ). The following microsatellite loci were genotyped: PrMS39a, PrMS39b, PrMS43a, PrMS43b, PrMS45 (Prospero et al. 2007 ), locus 18, locus 64 (Ivors et al. 2006) and loci ILVO145PrMS145 (a, c) (Vercauteren et al. 2010) . For the full genotyping methodology see the Supplementary data.
