Cell culture. Murine astrocytoma delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells and baby hamster kidney 21 cells expressing the MHV receptor (BHK-R) (54) were maintained at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco), HEPES (Gibco), and amphotericin B (Corning). BHK-R cells were further supplemented with 0.8 mg/ml of G418 (Mediatech). The human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3 (clone 2B4) was kindly donated by C. T. Tseng (University of Texas Medical Branch) (55) and maintained in DMEM (Gibco), 20% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), and 1ϫ Gibco antibiotic-antimycotic solution. Human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were obtained from airway specimens resected from patients undergoing surgery under University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board-approved protocols by the Cystic Fibrosis Center Tissue Culture Core (UNC Tissue Core). Primary cells were expanded to generate passage 1 cells, and passage 2 cells were plated at a density of 250,000 cells per well on Transwell-COL (12-mm-diameter) supports. Human airway epithelium cultures were generated by provision of an air-liquid interface (ALI) for 6 to 8 weeks to form well-differentiated, polarized cultures that resembled in vivo pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium (29, 56, 57) . Viruses. All work with MHV was performed using the recombinant WT strain MHV-A59 (GenBank accession no. AY910861) (54) . SARS-CoV expressing green fluorescent protein (SARS-GFP) and MERS-CoV expressing red fluorescent protein (MERS-RFP) were created from molecular cDNA clones according to protocols described previously (29, 57) . Compounds and cell viability studies. GS-441524 and GS-5734 were synthesized at Gilead Sciences, Inc., and prepared as 50 and 20 mM stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), respectively. Cell viability was assessed using CellTiter-Glo (Promega) in 96-well plates according to the manufacturer's instructions. DBT cells were incubated with indicated concentration of compound at 37°C for 24 h. Cell viability was determined using a Veritas microplate luminometer (Promega) with values normalized to those of untreated cells. GS-5734 sensitivity studies and generation of EC 50 curves. To test MHV sensitivity to GS-441524 and GS-5734, subconfluent monolayers of DBT cells were infected with the indicated virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 PFU per cell for 1 h at 37°C. The inoculum was removed and replaced with medium containing the indicated concentrations of GS-441524 or GS-5734. Cell supernatants were harvested 24 h postinfection. Titers were determined by plaque assay (17) . To test the GS-5734 Coronavirus Inhibition by Remdesivir (GS-5734) ® resistance capacity of the F480L ϩ V557L SARS-CoV, Calu-3 2B4 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5 ϫ 10 5 cells/well 48 h prior to infection. The medium was replaced with fresh medium 24 h prior to infection to encourage optimal cell growth. Cells were then infected with SARS-CoV F480L ϩ V557L-NanoLuc or SARS-CoV-WT-NanoLuc at an MOI of~5 PFU/cell in the presence or absence of GS-5734 at 1:3 dilutions, with DMSO (diluent) as an untreated control and UV-inactivated virus as a nanoluciferase reporter (NanoLuc) background control. Cells were lysed after incubation at 37°C for 72 h using a Promega NanoGlo assay kit and assayed on a luminescence plate reader (SpectraMax M3; Molecular Devices). EC 50 values and curves were generated with the nonlinear regression curve fit in GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA). In vitro efficacy in human airway epithelial cells. Fully mature HAE cultures were obtained from the UNC Tissue Core. At 48 h prior to infection the apical surface of the culture was washed with 500 l 1ϫ phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1.5 h at 37°C, and the cultures were moved into wells containing fresh air-liquid interface (ALI) medium (56) . Immediately prior to infection, 500 l of PBS was added to the apical surface of the HAE cultures for 30 min at 37°C, the first wash was removed, and a second wash was added prior to moving the HAE cultures into ALI medium containing GS-5734 concentrations ranging from 0.0016 to 10 M, as indicated for each experiment. The second wash was removed, and 200 l of viral inoculum (MOI of 0.5 PFU/cell for MERS-RFP and SARS-GFP) was added to the apical surface of the cultures for 3 h at 37°C. The viral inoculum was then removed, and the apical surface of the cultures was washed three times with 500 l 1ϫ PBS, the final wash was removed, and the cultures were incubated at 37°C for a total of 48 h postinfection. For all cultures, apical washes were performed (100 l 1ϫ PBS) to assess viral replication titers, and then total RNA was collected in 500 l TRIzol (Life Technologies/ThermoFisher) and frozen at Ϫ80°C prior to extraction for real-time PCR analysis. The data that are shown are representative of duplicate sample sets performed with a minimum of three different patient isolates. For the therapeutic HAE experiments, cultures were washed as described above, and HAE cells remained in drug-free ALI medium for the first day of infection. At 24 h postinfection, cultures were moved to ALI medium containing GS-5734 concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 M as indicated. Cultures were harvested at 48 h post-drug treatment, which was 72 h postinfection. Time-of-addition assay. Subconfluent monolayers of DBT cells were infected with WT MHV at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell for 1 h at 37°C. The virus inoculum was removed, and fresh medium containing DMSO or 2 M GS-5734 was added at the indicated time postinfection. Supernatant was harvested 12 h postinfection, and the viral titer was determined by plaque assay. Real-time qPCR of viral genomic RNA. Subconfluent DBT cells were infected with the indicated virus at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell (Fig. 3B ) or 0.01 PFU/cell (Fig. 6B) . The inoculum was removed after 1 h of incubation at 37°C, and medium containing the indicated concentrations of GS-5734 was added. Supernatant was collected, and total RNA was harvested using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) after 10 or 20 h, respectively. The viral titer was determined by plaque assay, and RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) to generate cDNA that was quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) as previously described (22) . Selection of GS-5734 resistance mutations. WT MHV was passaged in triplicate in increasing concentrations of GS-441524, ranging from 1 to 12 M. Infection was initiated for passage 1 at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. Supernatant was harvested and frozen when the cell monolayer demonstrated 80% cytopathic effect (CPE) or after 24 h. A constant volume of 16 l was used to initiate subsequent passages. All lineages were maintained until passage 17 (p17). Lineages 2 and 3 were lost after p17 and p20, respectively, when virus CPE did not reach above 50% upon multiple efforts and at various concentrations of GS-441524. Lineage 1 demonstrated an increase in visible CPE, and thus lineage 1 was carried to passage 23. After each passage, total RNA was harvested from infected cell monolayers using the TRIzol reagent to be used for viral population sequencing. After passage 23, RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed using SuperScript III, followed by generation of amplicons for all three lineages covering nsp12 and nsp14 at passage 16 and 12 PCR amplicons to cover the whole genome after 23 passages of lineage 1. Dideoxy amplicon sequencing was performed by GenHunter (Nashville, TN) and analyzed to identify mutations using MacVector. Modeling and conservation of resistance mutations in the CoV MHV nsp12 RdRp. The F476 and V553 residues were located on the previously described MHV RdRp model (32) using the Pymol Molecular Graphics System (Schrödinger, LLC). Multiple sequence alignments were generated using MacVector. Cloning, recovery, and verification of mutant viruses. QuikChange mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol to generate mutations in MHV individual genome cDNA fragment plasmids using the previously described infectious clone reverse-genetics system (54) . Mutants were recovered in BHK-R cells following electroporation of in vitro-transcribed genomic RNA. All fragments containing mutations as well as virus stocks were sequenced to ensure mutations were present before use in further studies (GenHunter). To generate SARS-CoV encoding nsp12 resistance substitutions, a 1,450-bp cassette encoding the substitutions (F480L and V557L) was synthesized by BioBasic, Inc. The synthesized cassette was then cloned into the SARS-CoV D infectious cDNA plasmid at unique MluI and MstI sites, and the subsequent selected clone was sequence verified across the cassette. SARS-CoV expressing the resistance substitutions along with the NanoLuc reporter in place of ORF7 was produced as described previously (58) . Virus replication assays. Subconfluent monolayers of DBT cells were infected with WT, F476L, V553L, or F476L V553L viruses at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell for 1 h. Inocula were removed, and cells were washed with PBS before addition of prewarmed medium. Supernatants were harvested at indicated times postinfection, and titers were determined by plaque assay. Competitive fitness of mutant viruses. Subconfluent DBT cells were coinfected with F476L ϩ V553L and WT MHV at input ratios of 1:9, 1:1, or 9:1 at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell for 1 h at 37°C. The virus inoculum was removed, and fresh medium was added. At 20 h postinfection, virus supernatants were collected, and infected cell monolayers were harvested using the TRIzol reagent. Samples were frozen, and cell supernatant was passaged onto fresh DBT cells for a total of four passages. Supernatants and cell monolayers in TRIzol were collected from each passage when nearly all of the monolayer was involved in CPE-approximately 16 h postinfection. RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed using SuperScript III, and PCR amplicons covering the region of the mutations were sequenced (GenHunter). Results represent the combined frequency of F476L and V553L mutations as determined by chromatographic traces and analyzed using MacVector. Assessment of resistant virus virulence in vivo. Groups of 10 to 12 10-week old female BALB/c (Charles River, Inc.) mice were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine and intranasally infected with either 10 4 or 10 3 PFU/50 l wild-type mouse-adapted SARS-CoV expressing nanoluciferase (WT SARS-CoV) or SARS-MA15 NanoLuc engineered to harbor resistance mutations in nsp12 (F480L ϩ V557L SARS-CoV). Animals were weighed daily to monitor virus-associated weight loss. On days 2 and 4 postinfection, 5 to 6 animals per group were sacrificed by isoflurane overdose and the inferior right lobe was harvested and frozen at Ϫ80°C until the titer was determined by plaque assay as described previously (38) . A 5-to 6-animal cohort was monitored out to 7 days postinfection in order to compare the kinetics of recovery, after which lung samples were harvested and the titer determined as described for previous samples. Statistics. Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 software (La Jolla, CA) as described in the respective figure legends.
