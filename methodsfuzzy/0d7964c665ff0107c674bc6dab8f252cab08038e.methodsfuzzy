The GFP sequence and primers as well as dsRNA synthesis procedure were described in Maori et al., 2009 . Apis mellifera sequence that corresponds to the Vitellogenin mRNA (bases 4648-5084; accession no. NM_001011578.1) served as a template for dsRNA-Vg transcription, and was amplified by the following primers: 5' TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAAAAGCTTATCAGAAGGTGGAAGAAAA 3'; 5' TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGACAATGTTTGTTAACGTTATGGTGGTA 3' (T7 promoter in bold). Labeling of GFP-dsRNA was performed using a DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche) with a DIG-11-UTP concentration of 70 Âµm per reaction.
