Chemicals. The F12 K medium, penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic solution (100X), fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin-EDTA solution (1X), amphotericin B (1,000X), phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium, CdCl 2 , 25% glutaraldehyde and crystal violet were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The human IL-10 (cat. no. ELH-IL10-001) and human IL-1α (cat. no. ELH-IL1alpha-001) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were purchased from Ray Biotech, Inc. (Norcross, GA, USA). Maintenance of the cell lines. The human MRC-9 normal lung (cat. no. CCL-212) and human A549 lung cancer (cat. no. CCL-185) cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The supplied frozen cells were cultured, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were grown in 10 ml minimum essential medium (American Type Culture Collection) (MRC-9) or F12K (A549) medium, containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 0.025 µg/ml amphotericin B and 10% FBS in T-75 cm 2 tissue culture flasks at 37˚C in a 5% CO 2 incubator (Nuaire Co., Plymouth, MN, USA). Crystal violet viability test. The viability test was performed as previously reported (25) . Briefly, to investigate the effect of CdCl 2 on the viability of the cells, ~1x10 5 A549 lung cancer cells or 5x10 4 normal MRC-9 lung cells were plated into each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate and allowed to stabilize overnight in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37˚C. The cells were treated with 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 or 200 µM CdCl 2 in a final volume of 1 ml in triplicate wells and were subsequently incubated for 24 h at 37˚C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. Following incubation, the viability of the cells was measured. The median lethal dose (LD 50 ) value was calculated from the LD 50 graph where the two lines meet, according to a previous study (26) . Preparation of cell extracts. A total of ~3.9x10 6 A549 lung cancer cells or 1.95x10 6 normal MRC-9 lung cells were plated into T-75 cm 2 flasks in complete medium. Each cell line was treated with 0, 50, 100 or 150 µM CdCl 2 in triplicate flasks for various durations (0, 6, 12, 18 or 24 h) and were incubated at 37˚C at 5% CO 2 . At the end of each treatment period, the cells were trypsinized and centrifuged at 1,350 x g for 5 min. The cells were lysed in 1 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) lysis buffer, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, by homogenization in a vial on ice three times for 10 sec using a polytron homogenizer (Pro Scientific, Inc., Oxford, CT, USA). The homogenate was subsequently transferred to an eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 12,740 x g for 10 min at 4˚C to remove the lysed cell membrane debris. The supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes and the cell lysates were stored at -20˚C for cytokine analysis. Protein estimation. The protein concentration of the cell lysates were determined using a Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL, USA) with bovine serum albumin as a standard protein. The protein standards and working reagents were prepared, according to the manufacturer's instructions. In triplicate eppendorf tubes, 25 µl standard or lysate sample were added. The working reagent (500 µl) was added to each tube, incubated at 37˚C for 30 min and was subsequently measured at 562 nm in a Beckman spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA). The concentration of the lysate samples were determined using the standard curve. ELISA. The human IL-1α and IL-10 ELISA kits were purchased from Ray Biotech Inc. and used for the quantitative measurement of the expression levels of the cytokines in human lung cells. The ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The intensity of the color in the 96-well plate was measured at 450 nm using a plate reader (EL 800; Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). Statistical analysis. The viability and cytokine assay results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (n=3). All CdCl 2 -treated cell data are presented as a percentage value compared with the untreated control cells (100%). The data were analyzed for significance by Dunnet's multiple comparison test, using GraphPad Prism software version 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
