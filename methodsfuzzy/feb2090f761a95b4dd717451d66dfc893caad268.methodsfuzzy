Li et al. [24] compared the experimental data of the airflow, temperature and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) concentration with the simulated results to validate the reliability of the numerical methods. They reported ''the agreement between the measurement and numerical calculation is acceptable for the simulation of such complicated cabin environment". In this study, further validation was conducted to ensure that the numerical method can capture the airflow patterns and vortex structures. In the study of Li et al. [12] , they used a high power 2D-PIV system to measure the large-scale air distributions in the cabin mockup. The systematic and statistical errors were approximately 1-2% and 3-14.5% [12] . Based on their PIV measurement, we compared the airflow patterns with the simulated results. In addition, the vortex structure was calculated according to the experimental data. Okubo [8] and Weiss [11] introduced the Okubo-Weiss parameter, Q, which is the differential of deformation and vorticity square, to identify the type of vortex structure. For the Okubo-Weiss equation: where s n represents stretching deformation, s s represents shearing deformation, and w represents vorticity as follows: Fig. S1 shows the visualized physical meaning of deformation and vorticity. For our study, we used Okubo-Weiss's Q value to identify the airflow vortex structures in the cabin. When Q > 0, deformation dominates; when Q < 0, vorticity dominates. However, in a practical application, the interval of Q is always divided into three parts by q 0 (q 0 = 0.2 dQ , where dQ is the standard deviation of Q in the entire fluid domain). When Q > q 0 , the domain is dominated by deformation; when Q < Àq 0 , the domain is dominated by vorticity; and when Àq 0 < Q < q 0 , the domain is an ambient field. According to a previous study [27] , these standards can identify the airflow vortex structure for complex fluids. In this study, this standard was adopted, and the airflow vortex structures calculated through the experimental data were used to validate the CFD model as well. Fig. 2 compares the experimental airflow patterns with corresponding simulated data. Because of the blocks of seats and manikins, only the airflow in the upper and middle domains of this section was obtained through PIV measurement. It is shown that the decay of simulated velocity seems slower than the experiment. Lin et al. [28] stated that the RANS simulation underpredicted the turbulence energy, while a large eddy simulation (LES) can obtain more realistic turbulent energy. The LES simulation needs much more meshes than nine million, and it is beyond the current computer capability. However, the simulated results agree with the experiments in the sense that the CFD model captured the trend of airflow patterns. The jets from the right and left diffusers are merged in the middle, and the jets from left sides are both little stronger. The velocity magnitudes are lower in the top and side regions. Fig. 3 presents the comparison of the experimental and simulated vortex structures. The red regions in the figure are dominated by deformation, blue regions are dominated by vorticity, and the green regions are ambient fields. The simulated results seem smoother, while the experiment has more discrete points. However, the CFD model captures the two big vorticities on the sides and the domain dominated by deformation in the middle. Three indexes were employed to quantify the data comparison. They were relative root mean square error (RRMSE), correlation coefficient (r) and overall coincidence degree (f). They are expressed as:  where v exp;i and v sim;i are the experimental and simulated velocity at sampling point i. v exp and v sim are the average velocity. Tðv exp Þ 10th and Tðv exp Þ 90th are the 10th and 90th velocity in all experimental data. RRMSE between the experimental and predicted data was 0.70, r was 0.86, and f was 0.70, indicating that the experimental data had good correlation and overlapping with the predicted data, but the discrepancies were observable between the pairs. In such complicated cabin environment, this agreement between the experiment and prediction was acceptable.
