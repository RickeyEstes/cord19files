Construction of recombinant vectors. The yeast two-hybrid vectors pGBK/T7 and pGAD/T7, the mammalian two-hybrid vectors pM and pVP16 were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The nucleocapsid gene (GenBank Accession No. AY274119) was amplified by RT-PCR from the SARS-CoV RNA isolated from SARS-infected patients as described [10] . Primers for the amplification are 5 0 GTAC GAATTCATGTCTGATAATGGACCCCAATC 3 0 and 5 0 GTAC GGATCC-GTGGTCATCATGAGTGTTTATG 3 0 . The amplified product was then purified with MiniElute PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), followed by digestion with EcoRI and BamHI (underlined sequence in primers). The digested DNA fragments were subsequently ligated in-frame into pGBK/T7, pGAD/T7, pM, and pVP16 vectors. As additional controls under the same assay conditions for N, the gene for SARS-CoV membrane (M) was amplified with the following primers: 5 0 GTACGAATTCATG-GCAGACAACGGTA 3 0 and GTA CGGATCC-TTACTGTACTAGCAAAGCA. The PCR product was cloned into the above-noted vectors in EcoRI and BamHI sites. PCR primers for the cloning of the N gene into pAs-Red2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) fluorescent vector (designated as pAsRed-N) are 5 0 GTAC GAATTCTATGTCTGATAATGGACCCCAATC 3 0 and 5 0 GTAC GGATCCGT-GGTCATCATGAGTGT-TTATG 3 0 . The expression vector for SARS-CoV M gene is designated as pGBK-M and pGAD-M in this report. To identify putative domains of amino acid sequences required for multimerization, sequential deletion starts from 5 0 in the nucleocapsid gene, all sense primers used in the study carry EcoRI restriction site (Table 1) , and the antisense primer sequence is the same one used for full-length nucleocapsid gene cloning as mentioned above. Primers for these fragments are listed in Table 1 . The sequential deletions resulted in an approximately 40 nt truncation (see below for details). In addition to sequential deletion mutants, a serine/arginine-rich motif (amino acid 184-196) was deleted using following primers: 5 0 [Phosp]AG AGGCTTGACTGCCG-CCTCTGCTTCC 3 0 and 5 0 [Phosp]AATTC A-ACTCCTGGCAGCAGTAG 3 0 . This mutant was designated as DpM-N/SR. Yeast transformation and culture. The competent cells of yeast strain AH109 were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Transformations were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 500 ng of plasmid DNA was added to 50 ml of competent cells and mixed again with 300 ml lithium acetate for incubation at 30 min at 30°C. The above mixture was then heat-shocked at 42°C for 15 min and subsequently spread on drop-out plates in the absence of leucine, tryptophan, adenine, and histidine. Finally, the plates were incubated at 30°C for 72 h for yeast growth. Positive interactions were determined by the growth of yeast transformants on drop-out plates. Mammalian cell culture. The African green monkey kidney cell line (Vero cells) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Vero cells were selected because they were susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. All cell cultures were carried out in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator at 37°C. Cell transfection. As many as 1 Â 10 5 cells were used for transfection using Effectene transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Transfection was conducted as described previously [10] . Briefly, 250 ng plasmid and 2 ll of Enhancer were mixed with 40 ll EC buffer and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After addition of 3 ll of the Effectene reagent, the transfection mixture was again incubated for 10 min, followed by dropwise addition to the cell culture, which had been washed with serum-free DMEM. The transfection efficiency is routinely monitored by cotransfecting the cells with pEGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). In addition, the experiments triplicated for each tranfection were repeated at least 3-5 times, with SD (standard deviation) being less than 10% (see figure legends for details). Western blotting. Protein samples were fractionated on 4-12% Novex NuPAGE SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) and then Table 1 Primers for N gene sequential deletion Note. Primers used for sequential deletion of the N protein. All primers shown in the table are forward primers. The restriction site EcoRI is underlined. The reverse primer used to generate the deletion products was the one used for the amplification of the full-length N gene shown in Materials and methods. transferred to PVDF membrane using semi-dry protein transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The membrane was blocked for 1 h with 5% skim milk in TBS buffer (20 mM Tris base, 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) containing 0.2% Tween 20. Afterwards, the membrane was probed with rabbit anti-His antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) and subsequently probed with donkey anti-rabbit HRPconjugated antibodies (AP Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The results were finally revealed by using Pierce Biotechnology SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Rockford, IL). Mammalian two-hybrid assay. Mammalian two-hybrid assays were performed using Clontech's (Palo Alto, CA) Mammalian Two-Hybrid Assay Two Kit. The nucleocapsid protein and its mutant were cloned inframe into pM and pVP16 vectors as described above. The recombinant pM-N constructs were then co-transfected with pVP16-N constructs along with a reporter plasmid, pG5SEAP. The pM vector carries a Gal4 DNA binding domain (BD), while the pVP16 vector carries a herpesvirus VP16 DNA activation domain (AD). In the case of an interaction between the two proteins, the BD and AD domains form a transcriptional activation complex and activate a secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene provided on the pG5SEAP. Reporter activity was measured by a chemiluminescent assay (SEAP assay). SEAP assay. The SEAP assay was used to measure the activity of protein-protein interaction through chemiluminescent readings. Detection of SEAP level in the culture supernatants of the mammalian cell cultures as indicated above would reflect the intensity of proteinprotein interaction. The GreatEscAPe SEAP assay was performed according to manufacturer's protocol (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Baculovirus expression. Detailed expression procedure for baculovirus expression of the N protein has been described. 1 Briefly, we used Bacto-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for expression of SARS-CoV N. The 6Â histidine-tagged N gene was cloned in-frame into pFastBac vector (pFastBac-N) at BamHI and EcoRI sites. The pFastBac-N was subsequently co-transformed with Bacmid DNA into Sf9 cells. A plaque assay was performed to isolate the single clone, which expressed the N protein detectable by Western blot. Sucrose gradient assay. As many as 2 Â 10 6 of N protein-expressing baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were lysed by 5 ml of PBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 0.2% NP40 (Sigma, St. Louis MO). The lysed cell extract was added to a 10-50% (w/w) fractionated sucrose gradient and subjected to 160,000g force centrifugation for 6 h. The uninfected Sf9 cells were used as the negative control. Fluorescence microscopy. The pAsRed-N vector contains SARS-CoV N gene fused to a red-color fluorescent protein on the amino terminus. The pASRed-N/SR vector is a mutation product of pAsRed-N missing the SR-motif. The pECFP-nuc is a nuclear localization vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) expressing a nuclear localization peptide fused to a cyan-color fluorescent protein. To perform the analysis, the pAsRed-N and pAsRed-N/SR were co-transfected, respectively, with pECFP-nuc into Vero cells. Thirty hours post-transfection, cells were visualized with a Zeiss Axiovert M200 fluorescent microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The pAsRed-N and pAs-Red-N/SR were excited at 545 nm and detected at 620 nm, while the pNuc-cyan was excited at 436 nm and detected at 480 nm.
