The work reported here has been conceived within the engineering paradigm. The processes involved in building a system can be divided into the distinctive phases of analysis, system specification, design, implementation and testing. The system described here has gone through several iterations of analysis, system specification, design, implementation, and testing. The requirements listed in the section below are derived from the following sources: (1) a project that evaluated the needs and conditions for access to patient information from geographically distributed electronic health records [21] ; (2) an analysis of the SARS outbreak in March 2003; (3) an analysis of a whooping cough outbreak in Troms County in North Norway in October/November 2003. The requirements were validated and augmented by a literature study of syndromic and disease surveillance systems and solutions directed towards early detections of bio-terrorist attacks [2] [3] [4] [5] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] 20, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . The Snow Agent system is a redesign and a complete reimplementation of the Virtual Secretary system [41] in terms of the requirements reported here. The initial Virtual Secretary system was developed at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Troms√∏. The current version is built on top of the Jabber Instant Messaging and Presence system. (see details in Section 4, "propagation of program control" below.) To test the system components, we implemented a distributed epidemiology service which extracts epidemiological data from simulated EHR databases. The test data used for constructing the EHR databases is described in the next section. The hardware and software used for system testing is described in Section 2.2 below. The Snow agent system may use several connection or organisation models.
