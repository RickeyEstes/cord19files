Animals and housing conditions. Adult free-living Kudus (n = 46) were caught by mass capture or by individual darting from a helicopter on game farms in three different Conservancies and transported to the experimental holding facility on the Okosongoro Safari Ranch located about 265 km northwest of Windhoek (Fig. 1 ). Blood samples were taken on the day of capture to assess the immunological status of the animals. Separate groups of 4 to 6 animals of the same gender were housed in two attached pens ("boma") (7 m × 14 m). Each boma consisted of a covered -and an open area which could be separated from each other by a sliding door. Both areas could be entered separately. Also, a sliding door could be used to connect the pen with an adjacent pen for separating single animals. The height of the indoor part of the pen was 3 m and the outdoor section was surrounded by a 3 m high wall. Large doors opening in both directions connect the pens with the central passage. Overhead catwalks enabled the staff to observe animals and facilitated the separation and manipulation of animals, e.g. immobilization for vaccination, infection and blood sampling. For the purposes of this study, to prevent contact with free-roaming wildlife from adjacent areas, the entire experimental holding facility and surrounding area was secured by a single 3.2 m high wire mesh game proofed fence (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, no other animals were held in the experimental facility during the entire study period. The site was guarded 24 h per day. Animal feeding and prophylactic treatment. Upon arrival, the Kudus were treated with doramectin (Dectomax −1% solution, Pfizer, Sandton, South Africa) against internal and external parasites and received multivitamin preparations (Kyrovite B Co Super, Kyron, Johannesburg, South Africa) and metabolic stimulant injections (Kyrophos Metabolic-V, Kyron). During the period of confinement animals received a diet of lucerne straw (Medicago sativa) and game cubes (Boskos WESenterprises, Thabazimbi, South Africa) supplemented with pods of the camel thorn tree (Acacia erioloba) and umbrella thorn tree (Acacia tortilis). When the supply of Boskos was exhausted it was replaced by Standard Game Cubes alternated with Game Cubes plus Ivermectin (Feedmaster, Windhoek, Namibia). The provision of acacia pods was particularly reduced during the hot dry season when these fruit became unobtainable. Pens were cleaned daily by removing both droppings and uneaten feed Transmission studies. For transmission studies, in total 21 Kudus (Table 1) were held in one group of six animals (group A) and 3 groups of five animals each (groups B-D, Table 2 ). Prior to infection, animals were adapted to captivity for an 80 days period. One animal in each group was infected with a high (10 5.3 TCID 50 , N = 4) dose, while another animal was inoculated with a low (10 3.3 TCID 50 , N = 4) dose of a Kudu rabies virus isolate (see below). The remaining conspecifics served as contact animals (group A -N = 4; groups B-D -N = 3) (Tables 1, 2 ). The challenge virus was administered by intramuscular (IM) injection bilaterally in the masseter muscle at a volume of 0.5 ml per site. Upon infection, the animals were observed at least twice daily for a period To prevent contact with free-roaming wildlife from adjacent areas, the entire experimental holding facility and surrounding area was secured by a single 3.2 m high wire mesh game proofed fence. Overhead catwalks enabled staff to better observe and manipulate animals (B). Individual pen ("boma") (7 m × 14 m) consisting of a covered -and an open area (C). The sliding door could be used to connect the pen with an adjacent pen for separating single animals. The height of the indoor part of the pen was 3 m and the outdoor section was surrounded by a 3 m high wall. of 261 days and the development of clinical signs was recorded (Fig. 3) . According to the animal welfare protocol, immediately at the onset of the first clinical signs, the animals were to be sedated and humanely euthanized by a supervising veterinarian with an overdose of thiafentanil oxalate (10 mg/ml Thianil, Wildlife Pharmaceuticals, Windsor, USA). Clinical signs included bellowing, throwing head back, persistent swallowing movements, persistent licking, paresis and paralysis, hypersalivation or frothing at the mouth. Point survivors were ear-tagged, vaccinated parenterally against rabies and rehomed on the spot at the end of the observation period. Vaccination studies. Twenty five Kudus were used for vaccination studies and held in 5 groups of four animals each and one group of five animals (Table 1 ). Prior to vaccination animals were allowed to adapt to captivity for 24 days. Ten animals (7 females and 3 males) in three groups received approx. 5.0 ml of the oral rabies virus vaccine construct SPBN GASGAS (10 8.1 FFU/ml) by direct oral administration (DOA). As positive controls, 9 female Kudus divided over 3 groups received 2.0 ml of a commercial inactivated rabies vaccine (Rabisin, Merial, France) by the IM route (Table 1 ). All vaccinated animals were challenged on the same day together with the animals from the transmission study (56 days post vaccination (p.v.)) with the high dose (10 5.3 TCID 50 ) Kudu RABV isolate using the same route of administration and following the same termination criteria as described above. Survival of vaccinated animals was followed over a study period of 183 days post infection (p.i.) (Fig. 3 ). Sampling. Serum samples (B) were collected at different time points prior, p.v. and p.i. to investigate the development and kinetics of rabies induced antibodies (Fig. 3) . Initial blood sampling was on the day of capture (B0); additional blood samples were taken on day 28 p. 20 . It is postulated that the overexpression of the RABV G increased not only its efficacy but also its safety profile by reducing potential risk of reversion to virulence and enhancement of apoptosis 21, 22 . The vaccine virus was propagated on BHK21 BSR Cl13 cells and harvested after 48 hours. The cell-cultured vaccine material was subsequently 5 times ultrafiltrated and stabilized (140 ml antigen + 60 ml GS8) to reach a final titre of 10 8.1 FFU/ml. The challenge RABV virus used (Lab ID 23079) was initially isolated from the brain of a naturally infected Kudu (240K09, GenBank accession JX473841) and genetically characterized 15 . After three serial passages on mouse neuroblastoma cells (NA42/13), the inoculum had a titre of 10 3.3 MICLD 50 /ml and 10 5.3 TCID 50 /ml when assayed by intracerebral inoculation of mice and cell culture, respectively. Verification of the genetic identity of the RABV isolate after passaging in cell culture using next generation sequencing 23 revealed an additional insertion of three nucleotides at positions 2475-2477 (AAC) in the intergenic region between the phosphoprotein (P) and matrix protein (M) gene. This specific sequence variation was confirmed by conventional Sanger sequencing of two independent PCR amplicons (Supplementary material) and let to the extension of the 6 A transcription stop signal by 2 additional As, while the following intergenic region starts with an additional C comprising 7 nucleotides (nt). Informed consent. The experiments did not involve human participants (including the use of human tissue samples). Therefore, informed consent is not needed. Diagnostic Assays. The presence of RABV antigen in brain tissue of Kudus was detected by fluorescent antibody test (FAT) as described previously 24 using both polyclonal (OIE-RL Onderstepoort, South Africa) and commercial FITC-labeled monoclonal (SIFIN, Berlin, Germany) anti-rabies antibodies. Defined positive (PC, positive fox brain) and negative controls (NC, naïve cattle brain) were included in every test run. FAT indeterminate results were confirmed by realtime polymerase chain reaction (rt-qPCR) 25 and the rabies tissue culture infection test (RTCIT) 26 , the latter with three consecutive passages to confirm a negative result. Sera were tested for the presence of rabies specific antibodies using three different serological assays with modified cut-offs. Virus neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) were detected in a modified rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) essentially as described 27 using the calibrated WHO international standard immunoglobulin (2nd human rabies immunoglobulin preparation, National Institute for Standards and Control, Potters Bar, UK) adjusted to 0.5 international units (IU) and a naive bovine serum as PC and NC, respectively. VNA titres were calculated using inverse interpolation as described and expressed in international units (IU/mL) 28 . Presence of rabies specific binding antibodies were tested using a commercial blocking ELISA (BioPro Rabies ELISA, Czech Republic) strictly following manufacturer's instructions. A study evaluating this ELISA kit found 100% specificity and 95.5% sensitivity with fox and raccoon dog sera; and 95% concordance with an assay measuring VNAs (the Fluorescent Antibody Neutralization Test) 29 . None of the serological assays employed in this study have been fully evaluated with Kudu sera, and a previous publication has demonstrated variable cut-off levels per species 27 . To account for lack of a unique identifiable cut-off in the assays for Kudu sera, besides sero-positive and sero-negative results indeterminate values were considered within a range of variation around the presumed cut-off of positivity (0.5 IU/mL +/− 0.25 IU/mL for RFFIT and 40% + 4.41%/−5.28% for BioPro ELISA) as described previously 27 . As a versatile and practical method for measuring rabies specific antibodies p.v., additionally the RAPINA test 30 was applied as a 3 rd method by following instructions of the manufacturer. Final scoring if a serum sample was deemed antibody negative or positive was based on a weighted analysis of all results obtained by the 3 different assays without giving an absolute value to it. ELISA and RFFIT results were given more weight (++; −−; ++/−−) than the RAPINA test (+, −, +/−), for the latter is not considered a standard test for rabies serology yet; whereby ++ or + is sero-positive, −− or − is sero-negative and +/− or ++/−− indeterminate. Every + received a score of +1 and every − a score of −1. The total score was calculated by adding the values; a negative score (<0) was considered sero-negative and a positive score (>0) as sero-positive. FAT testing was done in parallel at the Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL) Windhoek and the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI), Greifswald-Insel Riems, while rt-qPCR, RTCIT and all serological assays were exclusively conducted at FLI after the end of the experimental study.
