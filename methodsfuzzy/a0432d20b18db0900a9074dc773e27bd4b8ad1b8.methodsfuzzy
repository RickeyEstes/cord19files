Datasets and construction of PPINs. One biological data set E-GEOD-7158 of osteoporosis was derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/geo/) (3). There were 12 monocyte low PBM samples and 11 high PBM samples in the total 23 samples. The platform is A-AFFY-44-Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 (HG-U133 Plus 2.0). The Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) was then used to preprocess data. After quantile data normalization performed by robust multi-array average (RMA) (21), 20,545 genes were obtained. The human PPIN was collected from the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING; version 9.0) (22) . Only edges whose correlations are greater than the threshold δ were chosen, and set at 0.8. A total of 8,590 nodes and 53,975 protein-protein interaction (PPI) sets remained. Then we constructed anosteoporosis PPI subnet after getting intersection with expression profiles and the PPIN, which contained 7,953 genes and 48,778 PPI sets. Identification of modules and paired comparison. Using the human subnet as a backbone, we infer a re-weighted PPIN with expression and mutation profiles of monocyte low PBM and high PBM in osteoporosis. Every side of the constructed PPIN was assigned with absolute value of Spearman correlation coefficient of every interaction according to gene expression data. Based on clique-merging, module-identification algorithm was used to identify modules from PPINs (23) (24) (25) . We found all maximal cliques from low and high PBM PPIN, and the nodes <4 or >20 were filtered out. Then 8,002 maximal cliques in osteoporosis were obtained. We identified the set C of all maximal cliques of size at least k in the two groups using a fast depth-first search with pruning-based algorithm (CLIQUES). Next, we calculated its weighted interaction density score (C) as (equation 1): We ranked these cliques in descending order of their score (C) (23) . A predefined overlap-threshold t 0 =0.5 was set to go through the list repeatedly. The modules were gathered by merging highly overlapping cliques. Accordingly, we captured the effect of differences in interaction weights between monocyte low and high PBM group via the weighted density-based ranking of cliques. The set of disrupted or altered module pairs were identified by modeling it as a maximum weight bipartite matching. The module correlation density was calculated between low and high PBM group as follows (equation 2): Characterizing networks from network entropy. Destination networks were constructed with modules of common genes of monocyte low and high PBM groups. Network entropy, one of metrics of the inflammatory network, was detected in osteoporosis (20) . The local network entropy of a node i, denoted S i , is defined as (equation 3): In which, k j is the degree of node j, N(i) is the set of neighbor nodes of node i and p ij defines a stochastic probability matrix on the PBM network, which is defined by (equation 4): c ij is the PCC between protein i and j. The global entropy of destination networks, denoted S, is defined as follows (equation 5): n is the total number of nodes in the destination networks, and C i is the degree centrality of node i, which is defined by (equation 6): The differential network entropy, denoted ΔS i , is defined as follows (equation 7): i is the local network entropy of node i in low and high PBM networks. Significance test. The non-parametric one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test was explored to judge whether the distributions of the global entropy of low and high PBM networks were significantly different (20) . We first permutated sample labels and recalculated the global entropy of the low PBM network, which was repeated L times. The significance level (P-value) of the tests was calculated by {#l|S I l ≤S N o bs for l =l,...,L}/L. S I l and S N o bs are the global entropy of the low PBM network at the 1st time-point and of the high PBM network before this test, respectively. A P-value <0.05 was used to define significantly differential network in this study. Animals and modeling. A total of 60 female SD rats were purchased from Hebei Medical University Animal Center. All rats were housed at room temperature with 12 h light-dark cycle, and fed with normal chow diet and free access to water. The rat ovariectomy experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hebei Cangzhou Central Hospital, (Cangzhou, China). After a week of feeding, all rats were randomly and on average separated into 2 groups in which rats were ovariectomized and sham operated at the age of 6 months. Three months after surgery, bone mineral density examination was used to verify if the model was successfully established. All rats in ovariectomized and sham groups were euthanized via exposure to gradually increasing concentrations of isoflurane and carbon dioxide gas (30% gradual-fill chamber vol/min), blood was drawn from the abdominal aorta of rats in each group after the blood pressure and the right femur and then the right femur and third lumbar spine were quickly removed. The number of animals used and their suffering was minimized. Surfaceattached soft tissue were removed, eardrums, vertebral bows and other accessories were retained. The obtained bone tissue was packaged by gauze soaked with saline, and kept at -80˚C in a refrigerator. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar-DPX-IQ; GE Medical Systems, Madison, WI, USA) was used to detect bone density of right femur and third lumbar vertebra. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Venous blood sample of models were collected and total RNA was extract by TRIzol RNA kit (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration and purity of total RNA were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer. Reverse transcription into cDNA was then conducted by a reverse cDNA transcription kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Otsu, Japan). SYBR Ex Script RT-PCR kit (Takara Bio, Inc.) was used to detect the expression of target genes and the primers used in this study is shown in Table I . Statistical analysis. GraphPad Prism version 5 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for statistical analyses. All data were shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD). For experiments with two groups, t-test was performed. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Experiments were repeated with a minimum of 3 times for each condition.
