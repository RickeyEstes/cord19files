I Development of pre-and post-retrofit models: The first step is to develop two energy models that can predict representative energy consumption of the building at the pre-and post-retrofit stages. With the two models, the actual energy savings can be predicted taking into account any deviation in the post-retrofit conditions from the baseline conditions. The models should be developed by using a detailed building energy simulation programme, which allows users to input all essential building information, system & equipment specifications, as well as operational characteristics for realistic energy use predictions. The two models should be basically identical except the retrofitted systems and the conditions with significant changes (e.g. change of occupancy). To ensure the representativeness of the models, the models should be calibrated with the measured energy use data. Details of the calibration procedures can be referred to other published literature and guidelines [11] [12] [13] [14] . II Sensitivity analysis: The second step is to identify the importance of influential parameters affecting energy use. In general, the influential parameters can be summarised into three categories, namely "Building Load", "System Control and Operation" and "Equipment, System and Plant". For the selection of influential parameters, attention should be paid to those parameters that are likely to change during the EPC contract period, for example, weather conditions, occupancy rate, operating hours, etc. Some of the influential parameters may be excluded, for example, building height, materials used in building facade, orientation, etc., since these parameters are unlikely to change during the contract period. In some projects, an exclusion clause is incorporated to protest the interest of ESCOs and hosts in case of significant changes in the baseline conditions (e.g. large scale renovation works are conducted during the contract period). Those parameters can also be discarded in the sensitivity analysis. There are three common techniques to conduct sensitivity analysis, namely differential sensitivity analysis (DSA), random sensitivity analysis (RSA) and stochastic sensitivity analysis (SSA) in the field of building energy study [15, 16] . In comparison with these techniques, differential analysis by finite differences (FD) is most widely used because the calculations are easy and there are fewer problems to incorporate into the simulation programme. This technique has been widely used by researchers to determine the most sensitive parameters affecting building energy use [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The selection of a proper range and interval is essential to obtain accurate results in sensitivity analysis. Therefore, the range and intervals selected should cover the two extreme scenarios with a reasonably narrow interval. Nonlinearity issues should also be studied when the standard deviation of the influence coefficient (IC) is large. The procedure of performing differential sensitivity analysis is presented in the later part of this paper. III Development of probability distribution for selected parameters: The third step is to develop the probabilistic distribution function (PDF) for each of the selected parameters. The selection of the representative PDF is critical in this analysis as it is used to simulate the yearly variations in those selected parameters during the post-retrofit period. Empirical data from official database and previous research are used to determine the corresponding PDF for the selected parameters using curve-fitting techniques. Three goodness-of-fit tests, namely the Chi-square test, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, and the Anderson-Darling (A-D) test, are performed to evaluate how well the assumed distributions fit a set of sample data [21] . The Chi-square test is used to determine the validity of two or more theoretical distribution models. The K-S test serves the same purpose, but with fewer limitations in application such as a large number of intervals. The A-D test is particularly useful when the tails of a distribution reflect an essential distribution characteristic. The lower the goodness-of-fit value of these tests is, the more representative the assumed PDF is selected. For those parameters without empirical data to determine, a triangular distribution is proposed to be the representative PDF, and the most likely value should be regarded as the baseline condition. IV Simulation of possible energy saving: The fourth step is to simulate energy saving taking into account all possible combinations of selected parameters during the post-retrofit period. Monte Carlo simulation is performed to generate a common set of post-retrofit condition data based on the PDF of the selected parameters. Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical method where output values are randomly generated based on the assumed distributions of the independent parameters. A smooth approximation of the output distribution is obtained with large sample sizes (e.g. by iterating 10,000 simulation runs). This technique has been applied in a number of probabilistic analysis [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .The Latin Hypercube Sampling method is proposed to generate those random numbers, because it more precisely reflects the shape of a defined distribution with relative small sample sizes [26] . Detailed building energy simulation programmes usually require the weather and input data files to run the simulation. To simulate the energy saving uncertainty associated with yearly weather variations, it is necessary to modify and reproduce the typical weather file 10,000 times in accordance with the results of each Monte Carlo simulation. The algorithm of weather adjustment for the original weather file is based on a "morphing" method, developed by Belcher et al. [27] who constructed design weather data for future climates. Chan [28] also adopted this morphing method to modify the Hong Kong typical meteorological year (TMY) weather file taking into accounts the effect of urban heat islands. The procedure of this method will be illustrated in the later part of this paper. Similarly, 10,000 input files are required to generate based on the result of Monte Carlo simulation. Each weather and input file represents one of the possible yearly conditions during the post-retrofit period. These weather and input files are run on the detailed energy building simulation programme for the pre-and post-retrofit models to simulate possible range of energy savings.
