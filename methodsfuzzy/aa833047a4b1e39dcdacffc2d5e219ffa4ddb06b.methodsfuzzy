We obtained daily dengue case data aggregated at hospital level from Punjab province provided by the Health Department Punjab, Pakistan, between 2011 and 2014. In total, 47 156 suspected and confirmed dengue cases were reported in 109 hospitals. All hospitals were subsequently geo-located using 'Google maps' (http://www.maps.google.com) similar to methods described here [36] . Hospitals that could not be identified were removed from the database. The hospitals were then assigned to a district within Punjab, Pakistan by their spatial location. A total of 21 182 cases alone were reported from the year 2011, which affected almost the entire province. Many more cases occurred in Lahore (35 348) compared to all other districts (8808) (table 1). A breakdown per year and each province is provided in electronic supplementary material, table S1, and additional information about collection can be found in the electronic supplementary material, appendix. No information on dengue serotypes were available. However, the predominant serotype circulating in Punjab province, Pakistan is that of DENV-2 [37] .
