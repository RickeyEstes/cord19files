High binding microtiter plates (Corning Costar, Corning, New York, USA) were sensitized with SsCBF antigen (3.6 mg/ml; 100 ml per well in 0.1 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (CBB), pH 9.6, concentration previously determined by the check board titration), for 2 h at 37 8C and overnight at 4 8C in a refrigerator. Then, the plates were blocked with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 h at 37 8C in an incubator. Plates were washed three times with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Then, 100 ml of cat sera, diluted 1:800 (dilution previously determined in pilot tests; data not shown) in PBS-T-0.5% gelatin (PBS-T-G), were added to each well (in triplicate), and stored at 37 8C for 2 h in an incubator. The plates were washed again three times with PBS-T, and 100 ml of goat anti-feline IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (US Biological) (1:2000 dilution) was added to each well for 2 h at 37 8C in an incubator. After washing three times with PBS-T, substrate (H 2 O 2 /Ortho-Phenylenediamine -OPD) was added under dark conditions for 8 min; then, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 ml of 4N H 2 SO 4 . Absorbance was read at 492 nm with an ELISA reader (TECAN model Sunrise; TECAN Austria GmbH). When crude exoantigen preparations were used for ELISA, the plates were coated with 40.0 mg/ml (100 ml/well) of exoantigens in CBB (concentration previously determined by check board titration), and steps were performed as described above.
