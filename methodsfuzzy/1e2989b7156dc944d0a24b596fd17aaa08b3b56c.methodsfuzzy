The study was approved by the St Vincent's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee. Consent was obtained from the patient or next of kin before participation in the study. The present study was an open-label, escalating-dosage phase 1 trial of nebulised heparin (heparin sodium, 25,000 U/ ml; CP Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Wrexham, UK) in mechanically ventilated patients with ALI. Four doses were studied. Each dose was assessed in four patients over 2 days. The first group was administered 50,000 U/day, as 25,000 U 12 hourly (four nebulisations); the second group received 100,000 U/ day, as 50,000 U 12 hourly (four nebulisations); the third group received 200,000 U/day, as 100,000 U 12 hourly (four nebulisations); and the fourth group was administered 400,000 U/day, as 100,000 U 6 hourly (eight nebulisations). The final nebulisation of heparin was administered at 36 hours from baseline in the 50,000 U/day, 100,000 U/day and 200,000 U/day groups, and at 42 hours in the 400,000 U/day group.
