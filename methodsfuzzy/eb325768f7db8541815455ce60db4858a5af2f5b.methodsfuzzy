Inoculation of laboratory animals with influenza viruses can be accomplished using a variety of techniques depending on the question being addressed, but by far the method used most frequently is administration of liquid virus suspensions directly to the respiratory tract, most notably by intranasal instillation to the nares of the animal. This method has become standard practice among influenza virus laboratories, using a range of volumes depending on the animal model and the region of the respiratory tract being targeted [49, 55] . A reduced volume may be used to avoid delivering a substantial portion of the inoculum to the LRT. However, a caveat of intranasal inoculation is that a portion of the inoculum may be swallowed and diverted away from the respiratory tract, because some animals may swallow during the inoculation procedure [46] . Alternatively, intratracheal inoculation may be used to bypass the URT and gastrointestinal tract and has allowed researchers to observe differences in disease parameters that may be associated with the route of inoculation [71, 72] . Studies using ocular inoculations have provided evidence that replication-independent spread of virus from the eye to the respiratory tract can occur, likely via the lacrimal and nasolacrimal ducts but that ocular tissues can also support influenza virus replication [35, 73, 74] . Studies like these demonstrate that the method of inoculation is an important component of experimental designs. There are important advantages to establishing a method of inoculation that closely mimics a natural route of infection, and the administration of a liquid inoculum does not represent how influenza virus infections occur in nature. Many studies presenting either epidemiologic or experimentally derived data have concluded that droplets and aerosols are involved in influenza virus transmission in humans and in animal models [16, 58] . Aerosol exposure of animal models such as mice, guinea pigs, and ferrets to influenza virus has been described. Studies in mice showed that, compared to intranasal inoculations, aerosol delivery of H3N2 influenza virus caused increased morbidity and mortality [75] and that aerosol delivery of antivirals and live-attenuated influenza vaccine virus is an effective method of disease prevention in this animal model [76, 77] . Guinea pigs inoculated with aerosolized seasonal influenza virus reportedly were as contagious as those inoculated intranasally [52] . Ferrets inoculated with aerosolized HPAI H5N1 virus exhibit earlier onset and a broader spectrum of disease compared to those intranasally inoculated [46, 78] , whereas ferrets inoculated with aerosolized seasonal influenza virus exhibited illness that was indistinguishable from naturally acquired infections. Specifically, when ferrets were infected by exposure to other infected ferrets, similar virus shedding kinetics and disease characteristics were noted compared to low-dose aerosol inoculated ferrets [46] . Moreover, the 50% ferret infectious dose of a seasonal influenza virus delivered via aerosols was 1.9 pfu [46] or 4 focus forming-units [79] , similar to the 50% human infectious dose of aerosol-delivered influenza virus (0.6-3 50% tissue culture infectious doses [80] ), providing additional support to the relevance of the aerosol method of inoculation and the ferret as a model of influenza virus infection. Although these studies require specialized instrumentation (described within noted references), they demonstrate the applicability of aerosol inoculations to influenza virus research and how bioaerosol exposure systems can be individualized to meet specific experimental needs. Validation of bioaerosol systems should be conducted prior to animal exposures to ensure the consistent and reliable delivery of presented doses to animals, and consideration should be given to the bioaerosol shedding profiles of infected hosts under the environmental conditions being modeled. These innovations in inoculum delivery methods have provided improvements to animal modeling of influenza virus infection, pathogenesis, and transmission by more closely recreating natural, airborne infections in a laboratory setting.
