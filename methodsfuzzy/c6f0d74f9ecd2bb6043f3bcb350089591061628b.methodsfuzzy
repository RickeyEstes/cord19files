Lowel Jacob Read (8 January (20, 21) For the median dose calculation, the Reed-Muench method is still preferred by many researchers because of its relative ease of use. Further, reducing the dose range is possible as this method required just above and below 50% values for measuring median dose. Initially, this method has been used for the endpoint estimate at the Yellow Fever Laboratory at the Rockefeller Foundation. Later, the Reed and Muench duo simplified this method. In the Reed-Muench original article, they explained the method for calculation of protective serum. When it is applied to the virus titration, the formula needs to be modified accordingly. Because of this, many authors quoting the formulas in different ways especially in using +/symbol for dilution and dilution factor. The following formula is taken from (22) as it is simple and clear. In the above formulas, it is noteworthy to clarify the following points. 1) Proportional (or proportionate) distance also known as interpolated value or difference of logarithms, 2) minus (-) symbol will be applicable for log of dilution and dilution factor, 3) Log ID is an endpoint dilution i.e. in that minimum dilution 50% of the experimental unit will be infected, for example death of animal, embryos etc. In case of TCID50, it is the minimal dose required for infecting 50% of the wells (3 out of 6 wells etc.) and not 50% of the cell population. Thus, a well showing 100% CPE and a well showing indication of CPE will be equally scored as plus; if no CPE, then as minus, 4) virus titer is reciprocal of the end dilution. The below  Although this method is popular among researchers, very similar methods were available before that (24, 25) . Several researchers compared different median calculation methods and observed that the more recent Spearman-Karber method is superior (26 -28) .
