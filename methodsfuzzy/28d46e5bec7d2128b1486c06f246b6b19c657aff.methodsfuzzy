2.1. Cell culture BSR cell line, a derivative cell line from baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 g/ml of streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Unless otherwise noted, cells were harvested and re-suspended in assay medium, DMEM with 100 g/ml streptomycin, 100 IU penicillin/l and 1% FBS. After plating and/or compound treatment, cells were incubated at 37 â€¢ C, 5% CO 2 and 80-95% humidity for the time period as noted.
