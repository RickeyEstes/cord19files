Chemicals fl-Cyclodextrin (fl-CD) was a gift from Wacker GmbH (Lyon, France) and D-Gal and L-Fuc were purchased from Fluka (St Quentin Fallavier, France). The compounds Gal-Sp-fl-CD and Fuc-Sp-fl-CD were prepared as previously described [13] . "i'he GIc-NAc-Sp-OMe was kindly donated by Dr D Charon (Chatenay-Malabry, France). The detailed synthesis of GIcNAc-Sp-fl-CD, Gal-fl-1,4-GIcNAc-Sp-fl-CD and 7(Gal-Sp)-fl-CD will be published elsewhere. All the derivatives were soluble in distilled water except 7(Gal-Sp)-fl-CD which was soluble at a concentration up to 200 mg/ml in a DMSO/I-I20 1:10 v/v mixture. This mixture had no effect on the assays. All the derivatives were sterilized by fdtration through a 0.22/zm membrane (Sartorius, Palaiseau, France) before use.
