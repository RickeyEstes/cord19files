Drosophila genetics. Fly strains were grown at 29°C on standard cornmeal medium supplemented with dry yeast. The following fly lines were used in this study: gmr-GAL4; 34B-GAL4; UAS-DIAP1; UAS-emc (a kind gift of J. de Celis); UAS-GFP-lacZ; UAS-HSPA1L; UAS-P35; UASreaper; gmr-reaper; Csp R1 (a kind gift of K. Zinsmaier); CtBP 87De-10 ; dc3 EP2305 ; Eps15 EP2513 ; lwr 02858 (Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center); Nedd4 EY00500 ; Su(H) EY07695 (Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center); the Exelixis and DrosDel deficiency collections. Generation of 3a transgenic lines. The 3a ORF was PCR amplified from viral cDNA to generate pUAST-3a and pUAST-EGFP-3a plasmids. The UAS-3a transgene produces a full-length non-tagged 3a protein, whereas the UAS-EGFP-3a transgene produces a full-length 3a protein with EGFP fused to its N-terminus. UAS-EGFP-3a E0 and UAS-3a F1 were selected for detailed analysis. Genetic screen. We screened a total of 574 overlapping deletion lines to identify genomic regions that would modify the EGFP-3a-induced rough eye phenotype (Fig. 1B) when present in only one copy. Five hundred and one of the deletion lines are from the Exelixis collection, and 73 are from the DrosDel collection. A total of 93 deletion lines representing 24 genomic regions showed reproducible modification of the EGFP-3a phenotype. Semi-quantitative RT-PCRs. Total RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Primers used were dc3F: 5 0 ATG GT TCT GGT GAT GCA 3 0 ; dc3R: 5 0 CTA CTT GTT TGA CTT GAG 3 0 ; dc4F: 5 0 ATG GGC GTT CCT GCT GGT 3 0 ; dc4R: 5 0 TTA CTT GT CGC CGA CTT 3 0 ; emcF: 5 0 TTC CGT TCA TGC CCA AGA ACA GGA 3 0 ; emcR: 5 0 GTT GGA CAG TTG CTG CTG TGA TTG 3 0 ; GAPDHF: 5 0 ACC GTC GAC GGT CCC TCT 3 0 ; and GAPDHR: 5 0 GTG TAG CCC AGG ATT CCC T 3 0 . 3a monoclonal antibodies. In brief, BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100 lg of the KLH-conjugated 3a peptide in complete FreundÕs adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by monthly i.p. boosts using the same amount of antigen in incomplete FreundÕs adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich). Preliminary screening of serum antibody activity and hybridoma fusion clones was determined by ELISA. Western blot analysis. Primary antibodies used were anti-3a MAb X98 (1:40; this study), anti-cytochrome c clone 7H8.2C12 (1:500, Pharmingen), anti-Csp (1:50), and anti-b-tubulin E7 (1:2000; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA, with funding from the NICHD). Acridine orange staining and immunofluorescence. Acridine orange staining was performed as previously described [21] . Antibodies used for immunofluorescence include anti-3a MAbs X98 (1:20), anti-denatured cytochrome c clone 7H8.2C12 (1:200, Pharmingen), and anti-native cytochrome c clone 6H2.B2 (1:100; Pharmingen). Propidium iodide (PI) was used to label cell nuclei (Molecular Probes). Slides coated with both SARS-CoV-infected cells and non-infected cells were purchased from Euroimmun.
