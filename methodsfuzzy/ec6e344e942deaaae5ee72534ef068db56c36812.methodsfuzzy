Calves were cared for by acceptable practices as described in the Guide for the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Agricultural Research and Teaching (FASS, 2010) . In phase 1 of trial 1, 48 male Holstein calves initially 2 to 4 d of age from a single dairy farm were transported 3.5 h to the Nurture Research Center in southwest Ohio. Upon arrival, calves were randomly selected to either receive a s.c. injection of Zuprevo (Merck Animal Health, Summit, NJ; 4 mg of tildipirosin/kg of BW; TIL) the day after arrival (d 0) and again at weaning (d 42) or receive no injections (CON). Calves were housed in 1.2 m × 2.4 m individual pens with a coarse rock, tile-drained floor bedded with straw in a curtain-sided, naturally ventilated barn with no added heat for 56 d. A milk replacer was fed at 0.66 kg of DM daily for 39 d and then 0.33 kg of DM daily for 3 d. The milk replacer manufactured with whey, whey protein concentrate, and animal fat (25% CP, 18% fat; Table 1 ) was reconstituted to 14% solids with warm water and fed at 0630 and 1400 h daily. A low-starch, pelleted starter similar to the one fed by Hill et al. (2016) and water were fed free choice for the 56 d of phase 1. Every other bag of milk replacer and starter was sampled and composited for nutrient analysis (Table 1) . Management practices including vaccinations and medical treatments during the trial were based on the recommendations of the herd veterinarian. The day after arrival at approximately noon, the calves were weighed (d 0, initial BW). At this time, blood was sampled intravenously, serum was separated by centrifugation at 3,000 × g (VWR, Batavia, IL) at 20°C for 15 min, and serum protein concentration was estimated using an optical refractometer (ATAGO U.S.A. Inc., Bellevue, WA). Feces were scored daily using a 1-to-5 scale with 1 being normal and 5 being watery (modified from Kertz and Chester-Jones, 2004) . Calves with fecal scores of 3 or greater (considered abnormal fecal scores) received oral electrolytes that were not counted as medical treatments. During the first 28 d, the first abnormal feces (fecal score of 3 or greater) per calf was sampled and mixed. An aliquot was tested for Cryptosporidium, Rotavirus, Coronavirus, or K99 Escherichia coli using lateral immunochromatography strips (Biox Diagnostics, Jemelle, Belgium). Antibiotic medical treatments were recorded daily. Baytril 100 (Bayer Healthcare, Shawnee Mission, KS; 5 mL subcutaneously) was administered for coughing, nasal discharges, labored breathing, and rectal temperatures >39.4°C. Navel infections were treated with 5 mL of penicillin G procaine (300,000 units/mL; Agri Laboratories LTD, St. Joseph, MO) intramuscularly daily for 7 d. On d 28, 42, and 56, an experienced technician used a stethoscope to listen for abnormal sounds associated with breathing (right, anterior side of the calf) to further assist in identification of respiratory disease. Calves received an intranasal tissue sensitive respiratory disease vaccine (TSV-2, Zoetis, Exton, PA) and s.c. injections of vitamins A, D, and E (Vital E -A + D, Stuart Products, Bedford, TX) and Se (MU-SE, Merck Animal Health) upon arrival. Calves received an injection of Bovashield Gold 5 (Zoetis) at d 7 and again at d 28. Calves were castrated and dehorned at 36 d of age. Calves were weighed initially and weekly thereafter. Body condition score (1 being thin and 5 being obese, modified from Wildman et al., 1982) and hip width using a caliper were measured initially and every 2 wk thereafter. In phase 2 of trial 1, the same calves from phase 1 grouped by CON and TIL were moved to group pens (6 pens per treatment with 4 calves per pen) for the next 56 d. The pens had 6.5 m 2 of outside pen space and 1.35 m 2 of inside pen space per calf. Inside pen space was bedded with straw, and there was no added heat. The same starter fed in phase 1 was blended with 5% chopped grass hay (Table 1) and fed with water free choice. Every other bag of starter and every bale of hay was sampled and composited for nutrient analysis. Calves were weighed, scored for body condition, and measured for hip width initially and at 28 and 56 d of phase 2. The average ambient temperature in trial 1, phase 1 was 10°C with a range from −4 to 28°C. The average relative humidity was 75% with a range from 20 to 100%. The average ambient temperature in trial 1, phase 2 was 21°C with a range from 4 to 33°C. The average relative humidity was 70% with a range from 20 to 100%. In trial 2 (56 d in length), 48 Holstein calves that were 2 mo of age (71.2 ± 1.73 kg of BW) were randomly selected to either receive a s.c. injection of tildipirosin (TIL; Zuprevo, Merck Animal Health) at 4 mg/kg of BW or receive no injection (CON). Calves had been previously transported 3.5 h and managed as in phase 1 of trial 1. Calves had been weaned for 2 wk when trial 2 began. Feeding and Table 1 ). The average ambient temperature in trial 2 was 22°C with a range from 10 to 33°C. The average relative humidity was 84% with a range from 22 to 100%. Composites of feeds, refused feed, and feces were analyzed as described by Hill et al. (2016) . Nutrient analysis of the refused feed for each wk and pen resembled the feed offered. In phase 1 of trial 1, data were first grouped by wk, except hip width and BCS change, which were grouped by 14-d periods. The data were analyzed as a completely randomized design with repeated measures when applicable by Proc Mixed in SAS (version 8, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). An auto-regressive type 1 covariance matrix was employed as determined using Akaike's information criteria. Exceptions were abnormal fecal score days and medical days, which were summed over the entire phase and analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test with Proc NPAR1WAY in SAS. Calf (one calf per pen) was the experimental unit. In phase 2 of trial 1 and trial 2, intake and growth data were analyzed as a completely randomized design with repeated measures when applicable (grouped in two 28-d segments for body measurements) by Proc Mixed in SAS. An auto-regressive type 1 covariance matrix was employed as determined using Akaike's information criteria. Pen was the experimental unit. Significance was determined at P ≤ 0.05.
