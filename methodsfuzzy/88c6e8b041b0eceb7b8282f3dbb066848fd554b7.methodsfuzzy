All animal experiments were approved by and conducted in accordance with guidelines of the committee for Animal Care and Use of the Facultad de Ciencias Químicas, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba (Approval Number HCD 388/11) in strict accordance with the recommendation of the Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals published by the Canadian Council on Animal Care (OLAW Assurance number A5802-01). Mice, infection, Parasitemia, and survival C57BL/6 (B6) mice indicated as wild type (WT) along the manuscript, were purchased from National University of La Plata (Bs. As., Argentina). Nlrp3−/− and casp-1/11−/− mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Animals were maintained at the Animal Resource Facility of the CIBICI-CONICET (NIH-USA assurance number A5802-01) at 22 ± 2°C with a 12 h light-dark cycle, with food and water ad libitum. Six-to eight-week-old male mice were intraperitoneally injected with 10 3 blood trypomastigotes-Tulahuen strain. Blood and livers were collected at 14 and 21 days post infection (dpi). Survival of each mouse was followed every day. Parasitemia was measured as previously described (31) . Uninfected mice of each strain were used as controls. Parasites were maintained by serial passages from mouse-to-mouse each 14 days in B6 mice.
