The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and informed owner consent was obtained. Descriptive statistics for the various patient groups were generated. Normality was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Nonparametric tests were used if data were not normally distributed. Data that were below the lower limit of quantification for any particular assay were entered as a value equal to 0.5 times the lower limit of quantification as previously recommended. 21 The presence of any extreme outlying data points was identified by the Grubbs' test, which restricts potential removal to ≤1 data point from each data set. 22 Differences between 2 unpaired groups were tested using Wilcoxon rank sum or unpaired t tests. Differences across ≥3 groups were tested using Kruskal-Wallis or 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc pairwise comparisons were performed using Dunn's test with correction for multiple comparisons or Bonferroni correction, respectively. Box and whisker plots were constructed with the line representing the median value, the limits of the box representing the 25th and 75th percentiles, and the whiskers extending to the 5th and 95th percentiles. Correlations among various patient demographic data, echocardiographic variables, and assay results were explored using Pearson correlation coefficient or Spearman rho and unadjusted P values. Concentrations of APs before and after administration of rhACE2 were evaluated by Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Data are shown as median (interquartile range), unless otherwise specified. Statistical procedures were performed using statistical software (Prism 8 for OS X, GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, California). Significance was defined as P < .05. Figure 2 ). This result was consistent regardless of whether or not the outlier value was included in the analysis. No significant correlation was found between ACE2 activity and age (R 2 = .057, P = .34) or body weight (Spearman r = −.092, P = .72) in the healthy cohort. Figure 3 ). This result was the same regardless of whether or not the outlier value was included in the analysis. The ACE2 activity per milligram of protein in kidney tissue was approximately 250 to 500 times higher than circulating or LV myocardial ACE2 activity.
