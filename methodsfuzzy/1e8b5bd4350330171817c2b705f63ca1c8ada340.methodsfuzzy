To fill in this gap, this study is based on Hong Kong being a regional exemplar during its 60 years of PH design progress against a persistent mismatch between the high demand for housing and the intermittent shortage in land supply, among other challenges. Situated in the sub-tropical Pearl River Delta region of China, Hong Kong stands as one of the densest metropolises in the world, with a mid-2012 population density of 6620 persons per km 2 (CSD, 2013a). As illustrated in Fig. 1 , the city comprises Hong Kong Island (the Island), the Kowloon Peninsula (Kowloon), and the New Territories. The three major regions collectively occupy a land area of 1104 km 2 . With only 20% of the areas being naturally developable (Yeung and Wong, 2003) , most of the remaining developed lands are created through reclamation. By mid-2013, 46.5% of the territorial population of 7.18 million (CSD, 2013b) relies on PH in two major forms-29.6% in public rental housing (PRH) and 16.9% in subsidized sale flats (Housing Authority (HA), 2013a). As a major PH provider, the Hong Kong HA has been statutorily committed to develop, retrofit, and manage an increasing stock of PH estates since 1973. By March 2013, the 162 PRH estates of HA are accommodating over 2 million people (Long Term Housing Strategy Steering Committee (LTHSSC), 2013). To address the re-emergence of PH supply deficiency, the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region plans to provide approximately 179,000 PRH units within a 10-year time frame starting in 2013. The target annual PRH supply accounts for nearly 40% of the total local housing supply (Transport and Housing Bureau (THB), 2013). Addressing the existing undersupply problem represents a key part of the contemporary history of Hong Kong. Moreover, this process can offer useful insights to the East Asian region by sharing the experience with areas that have similar compact urban settings as Hong Kong and with Mainland China. The latter is an ambitious PH player with a pressing need to flatten its learning curve in this regard. This study aims to synopsize the history and reality of PH design in Hong Kong, as well as to contribute a conceptual framework by outlining major considerations toward sustainable PH design, in general. The history and reality referred to in this paper are divided by the year 2003. The major reason for such division is the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which heightened awareness of PH design professionals and the society as a whole on the crucial relationships between occupant health and environmental degradation. Such relationships were previously considered insignificant in vertically compact high-rise living quarters, including PH estates in Hong Kong. The three objectives of this study are as follows: To profile historical challenges and assess their influence on design progression, To understand the local implications of global trends on urban regeneration and building sustainability for local PH design, and To outline emerging and future prospects for satisfying sustainability challenges in PH design. Desk and evidence-based studies were conducted to complement each other. Factual data were obtained from policy documents, official reports and circulars, and academic publications on local PH development. Empirical evidence was collected through housing workshops and conferences. In addition, field trips were made in regions where PH estates are concentrated. The rest of this paper is organized in as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review (from 1953 to 2003) of PH design progress in Hong Kong. Section 3 focuses on 2003 onwards by analyzing the latest policy initiatives and design innovations. Section 4 synopsizes the key findings into an evolution map of PH design in Hong Kong, which has been driven by seven major challenges since 1953. By combining historical and current perspectives, the final section also concludes the article by providing a conceptual framework for considerations and five future prospects toward sustainable PH design. Kong (1953 Kong ( -2003 The central theme of this section is to present how challenges that have been encountered over time influence PH designs in Hong Kong. As a crucial but missing component of extant PH literature, this section provides an overview of the seven major challenges encountered in PH. These challenges are presented in chronological order, but can be meaningfully grouped into three sub-categories based on their nature.
