For quality assessment, we used the Quality Appraisal of Case Series Studies Checklist of the IHE and specifically the critical appraisal tool to assess the quality of cross-sectional studies (AXIS) [35, 36] . Publication bias was assessed using a funnel-plot. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95%CI, given variable degrees of data heterogeneity, and given the inherent heterogeneity in any systematic review of studies from the published literature. Egger's test for publication bias was also performed.
