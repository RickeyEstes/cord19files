The advent of microscopic techniques to image biofilms and to prepare thin sections using, for example, cryosectioning and confocal microscopy (171) , allows direct observation of pathogens within biofilms by using specific antibody staining (175, 178) . This is beginning to help in investigations on the protective role of biofilms. For example, Figure 2 shows a clinical isolate of M. avium that has both survived and proliferated under a biofilm of P. aeruginosa in a circulating model tap water system (175) . New methodologies are changing the approach to monitoring pathogens in drinking water and will therefore affect our ability in the future to assess risk. At present it is difficult to establish concentrations of specific, viable, and infective pathogens in drinking water. The increasingly widespread use and continuing development of flow cytometry, in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to the single-cell level, magnetic separation techniques, and reverse transcription PCR (179-183) is dramatically improving detection of specific pathogens and pathogen viability in drinking water. Accelerated development of these techniques has been stimulated partly by the U.S. EPA Information Collection Rule-the requirement to monitor source waters for protozoa and viruses (184) . Considerable effort has gone into developing routine techniques for Cryptosporidium monitoring. However, immunocapture PCR that is sufficiently sensitive and specific to monitor extremely low numbers of viruses in drinking water samples is also at an advanced stage of development (179, 185) . The critical challenge is how to make these new methodologies cost effective for pathogen monitoring, particularly in developing countries where resources are extremely limited. Risk assessment methodologies also need further development. Any calculation of risk depends on considerable speculation concerning exposure pathways to the drinking water supply, infectious dose, and population susceptibility. Although attempts have been made to assess risks from drinking water pathogens, and in some cases models do appear to approximately predict incidence of disease (186) , uncertainties are enormous. Far better risk assessment methodologies are needed that take into account the uneven distribution of pathogens in drinking waters (187), include better estimations of infectious dose, and can more accurately predict the infectivity of an organism under environmental conditions (188, 189) . In addition, the inclusion of interactions among microbes and between microbes and chemicals in models that attempt to define Figure 2 . Confocal micrograph of a mixed biofilm of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium avium. Biofilms were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody to Erdman lipoarabinomannan, a Mycobacterium cell-wall lipopolysaccharide, followed by goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to rhodamine. M. avium (brightly stained) appears to be clustered close to the biofilm substratum interface (left side) (micrograph courtesy of R.
