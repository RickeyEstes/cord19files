Cell culture and virus infections. Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) were prepared by bronchoalveolar lavage as described previously (67) and grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml gentamicin, nonessential amino acids, and 10% porcine serum. Cells were grown at 37°C in a 7% CO 2 atmosphere saturated with water vapor. COS-1 cells (from African green monkey kidney) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml gentamicin, nonessential amino acids, and 2 to 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Life Technologies). The ASFV isolates Armenia/07 and NH/P68 were propagated on PAM. Briefly, subconfluent PAM cells were cultivated in p150 plates and infected with ASFV at an MOI of 0.2 PFU/cell in DMEM-10% porcine serum. At 96 hpi, the cells were recovered and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 min. The cell pellet was discarded. The supernatant containing the viruses was clarified at 14,000 rpm for 6 h at 4°C, resuspended in medium, and stored at Ϫ80°C. The viruses were then titrated by plaque assay on COS-1 cells as previously described (64) . Infection was performed after ASFV adsorption at 37°C for 90 min, when the inoculum was removed, and fresh medium was added. The cells were then incubated at 37°C for the times indicated (in hpi). Antibodies and reagents. Polyclonal rabbit anti phospho-STING antibody (Ser366, catalog no. 85735), monoclonal rabbit anti phospho-IRF3 antibody (Ser396, catalog no. 4947), and monoclonal rabbit anti phospho-TBK1/NAK antibody (Ser172, catalog no. 5483) were purchased from Cell Signaling. Monoclonal mouse anti-IRF3 antibody (SL-12, sc-33641), anti-m-IgG secondary antibody (BP-HRP, sc-516102), polyclonal goat anti actin antibody (I-19, sc-1616), and polyclonal goat anti ␤-laminin (S-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal rabbit anti TMEM173/STING antibody (19851-1-AP) was purchased from Proteintech. Polyclonal rabbit anti-histone H3 antibody (ab18521) was acquired from Abcam. Antiserum 1262 was kindly provided by E. Tabarés; monoclonal mouse anti-p32 (S-1D8) was kindly provided by S.-Y. Sunwoo. Anti-rabbit/Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-mouse/Alexa Fluor 555 antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulin G coupled to peroxidase and ECL Prime Western blotting detection reagent were acquired from Amersham Biosciences. Monoclonal mouse anti-␥-adaptin antibody (AP-1, A4200), anti-goat antibody G coupled to peroxidase, and digitonin were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. Cellular fractionation. PAM were seeded in p60 plates (6 ϫ 10 6 cells/plate) and mock or ASFV infected (2 PFU/cell) for 8 h. The WCE, cytoplasmic fraction (S2), soluble nuclear fraction (S3), and chromatin fraction (P3) were isolated as described previously (68) . Briefly, cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.34 M sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 0.1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF] , and protease and phosphatase inhibitors [Roche]) and Triton X-100 were added (separating a part for WCE), followed by incubation for 5 min on ice. The nuclei were then centrifuged at 3,600 rpm 4 min at 4°C. The first supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm 15 min at 4°C, and the second supernatant was stored (S2). The first pellet (P1) was washed with buffer A and later was resuspended in buffer B (3 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors [Roche]), incubated 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 4 min at 4°C. The third supernatant (S3) was stored, and the third pellet (P3) was washed with buffer B and finally resuspended in loading buffer. cGAMP and Ru521 treatment. Cells were treated with a specific concentration of 2=3=-cGAMP (Invivogen) or cGAS inhibitor Ru521 (Invivogen) in digitonin permeabilization buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.0], 100 mM KCl, 85 mM sucrose, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM DTT, and 10 g/ml digitonin) (28) . The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C, and then the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fresh medium or virus inoculation was added as indicated. For the Ru521-treated samples, cells were incubated for 2 h with fresh DMEM before being infected. ELISA. PAM were seeded in 24-well plates (2 ϫ 10 6 cells/well) and mock or ASFV infected (4 PFU/cell) in DMEM-10% porcine serum. ASFV viral adsorption to cells was performed at 37°C for 90 min. The inoculum was then removed, and 250 l of fresh DMEM medium without porcine serum was added. At the indicated times postinfection, cell culture supernatants were collected and assayed for porcine IFN-␤ using a porcine IFN-␤ ELISA kit (MyBioSource), as described by the manufacturer. Immunofluorescence. PAM were grown on coverslips and treated or untreated with cGAMP (20 g/ml) or mock or ASFV infected at the indicated MOI. At the indicated times postinfection (1 or 6
