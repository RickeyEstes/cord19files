Rnrigen preparation. Parasites were cultured using the m~~roaeroph~ious stationary phase culture technique [Levy Bt Risk, t980) essentially as described previously (3&e L Daemen, 1992). Parasitized erythrocytes were enriched to about 100% infected cells with density gradient centrifugation on a two-step Percoll gradient (Bhushan, Miiller & Friedhoff, 1991) , washed three times in RPMI-1~0 tissue culture medium and stored in aliquots at -80째C. A control antigen of non-infected erythrocytes of the same doner horse used for the cultures was prepared in the same manner. For the ELISA both antigens were extracted with urea OF with detergents. Urea (Gibco/BRL, Eggenbeim, Germany, no. 54@5505Uv) was used in a final concentration of 4.5 M-Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (Gibco/BRL, no. 5525UA), Triton X-100 (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany, no. 13324811, Nonidet P-40 (Boehringer, no. 1332473 ) and 3-[3-Cholamidopropyl)-dimethyiammonio]-l-propane-sulfonate (CHAPS) (Boehringer, no. 810118) were used in final concns of I %. Antigen and reagent were mixed and incubated for 20 min at 37째C (urea, Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, CHAPS) or for 5 mm at 95째C (SDS) and centrifuged (22,000 g, IO min, 4째C). The supernatant was used as antigen in the ELISA.
