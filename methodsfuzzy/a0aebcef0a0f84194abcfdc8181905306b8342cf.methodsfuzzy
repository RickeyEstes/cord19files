Use of dust-retaining materials (ie, microfiber cloths; microfiber cloths and mops have shown superior microbe removal to other materials like cotton, particularly when used with a detergent cleaner) rather than traditional brooms or rags, to minimize the dispersion of contaminated dust in the environment When cloths are used for damp cleaning, only clean water should be used; no additional detergents are needed All cloths should be washed after every use 2. Wet method Double bucket technique: first bucket is for clean water and either detergent or disinfectant; second bucket is for clean rinse water Single bucket technique: solution must be changed as soon as it becomes dirty and before moving to any new area All mop buckets should be emptied, cleaned, and left to dry when not in use. Mop heads should be changed a minimum of once a day or sooner when visibly soiled Personnel conducting the process must use appropriate personal protective equipment (eg, gloves, disposable apron, eye protection) when indicated Discard all disposable items according to proper waste disposal regulations Remove portable equipment to dirty utility area for C/D or sterilization as needed Place all laundry into an appropriate bag, seal before removal from the space, and send for processing Dry dust patient area, beginning at the top and working toward the bottom (although walls are not considered particularly critical surfaces in human medicine, the fact that veterinary patients may regularly lick those surfaces as well as floors increases their importance in veterinary infection control) Wet dust patient area, beginning at top and working toward the bottom Wash mats, caging or animal housing areas, surgical and examination tables, and other static equipment with detergent and water, rinse, and dry If disinfection is required (mandatory for infectious patients), apply appropriate disinfectant solution to any/all areas, allow contact time, rinse, and dry Use special procedures for static equipment that cannot withstand treatment with water and detergents As needed, repeat washing and disinfection of floors Data from Refs. 36
