To monitor autophagy activities within mammalian cells, which is a highly dynamic cellular process, plenty of methods have been adopted in the past twenty years. These techniques have been systematically introduced and summarized [42] [43] [44] [45] . The methods mentioned in the articles that we summarized in this review will be selected and introduced below. Electron microscopy is the most traditional and reliable method for monitoring autophagy. Autophagosome is a double-membrane compartment engulfing undigested cytoplasmic components, while the autolysosome is a single-membrane vesicle which is occasionally difficult to be distinguished from other single-membrane organelles, e.g. endocytic compartments [43] . As electronic microscopy requires proficient technique and expertise to identify different organelles, it is not an ideal method study autophagy, especially for those who are new in this field. As mentioned above, when autophagy occurs, nascent cytoplasmic proLC3 is processed by Atg4 into LC3-I and then conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to become LC3-II by a complex ubiquitin-like E3 ligase system, which bounds to autophagosome [46, 47] . Thus, LC3 is a most widely used marker for autophagic membrane. On SDS-PAGE, it usually shows two bands in LC3 immunoblotting: LC3-II (apparent mobility, 16 kD) migrates faster than LC3-I (apparent mobility, 18 kD) [48] . Quantification of LC3-II level or LC3-II/LC3-I ratio by western-blot provides valuable insight on autophagic process. Usually, the upregulated level of LC3-II represents increased autophagic activity. However, either blocking fusion of autophagosome and lysosome or inhibiting the protease activity in lysosome can also lead to accumulation of LC3-II [42, 49] . Therefore, though measurement of LC3-II/LC3-I by western blot is quantitative and relatively convenient, it is usually combined with other techniques to monitor autophagic activities [43, 50] . LC3 is often fused with a fluorescent protein, e.g. GFP and RFP. In GFP-LC3 puncta formation assay which counts the average number of punctate structures per cell by fluorescence microscopy, green punctate structures primarily represent autophagosomes [48, 51] . Since GFP can be easily quenched in acidic pH, membrane-bound LC3 autolysosome is almost absent under fluorescence microscopy. In contrast, RFP is more stable in acidic organelles, thus RFP-LC3 can be detected in both autophagosome and autolysosome. Another useful probe to monitor autophagic flux has been developed based on the difference in nature of GFP and RFP, which fuses tandem fluorescent-tag mRFP-GFP with LC3 to generate tfLC3 construct [52] . In tfLC3 expressing cells, autophagosomes can be visualized as yellow puncta as both mRFP and GFP exist, while autolysosome exhibits red only signal due to the stability of mRFP in acidic compartment. Both yellow and red puncta are increased during autophagic flux, whereas the accumulation of yellow puncta only indicates that fusion between autophagosome and autolysosome is blocked, or protease activity is inhibited in autolysosome [52] .
