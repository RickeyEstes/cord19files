Melting points were determined on a Mel-temp II apparatus and are uncorrected. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 500 spectrometer at 500 MHz for 1 H NMR and 125 MHz for 13 C NMR with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Chemical shifts (d) are reported as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), or br s (broad singlet). UV spectra were recorded on a Beckman DU-650 spectrometer. Optical rotations were measured on a Jasco DIP-370 digital polarimeter. High-resolution mass spectra were recorded on a Micromass Autospec high-resolution mass spectrometer.

To a solution of 5 (12 g, 28.0 mmol) in anhydrous CH 2 Cl 2 (100 mL), Et 3 N (11.64 mL, 84.0 mmol) was added under N 2 atmosphere at 0°C. After 5 min, methanesulfonyl chloride (3.24 mL, 42.0 mmol) was slowly added to the reaction mixture at 0°C and then stirred for 1 h at room temperature. To the reaction mixture, Et 3 N (20 mL) was added until the solution became basic and then solvent was removed under reduced pressure. 8, 143.7, 128.5, 127.9, 127.2, 124.0, 113.5, 86.4, 80.8, 77.2, 61.0, 39.0, 27.5, 27 .1; HRMS-ESI (m/z): (M+H) + calcd for C 29 H 30 O 6 S, 507.1842; found, 507.1843. (7) and (8). To a solution of NaH (1.87 g, 78.2 mmol) in THF (200 mL) was added ethylcyanoacetate (8.33 mL, 78.2 mmol) in THF (100 mL) under nitrogen atmosphere at 0°C. After 1 h, 6 (13.2 g, 26.0 mmol) in THF (0.8 L) was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was stirred at 50°C for 40 h and then cooled to room temperature, H 2 O (100 mL) was added and extracted with ethyl acetate (2· 300 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO 4 , concentrated, and then purified on silica gel column chromatography (hexane-EtOAc = 9:1-8:2) to give compound 7 (7.09 g, 52%) and compound 8 (2.43 g, 10%) as white solids.

To a solution of 7 (3.50 g, 6.68 mmol) in anhydrous ether (60 mL), DIBAL-H (1 M in hexane, 13.36 mL, 13.36 mmol) was added at À78°C over 10 min. The mixture was stirred at À78°C for 30 min and quenched with MeOH (90 mL) at À78°C. The mixture was stirred for 30 min and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resultant solid cake was suspended in EtOAc-MeOH (30:2) and then stirred for 2 h and filtered. After removal of the filtrate under reduced pressure, the residue was dissolved in MeOH (70 mL). Aminoacetonitrile bisulfate (2.57 g, 16.71 mmol), NaO-AcAE3H 2 O (2.18 g, 16.04 mmol) were added and the mixture was stirred at rt for 24 h. The solvent was evaporated and the residue was co-evaporated with MeOH (3· 60 mL). The obtained residue was suspended in EtOAc (100 mL) and stirred for 30 min. After filtration and concentration, the residue was purified using silica gel column chromatography (hexane-EtOAc = 8:2-7:3) to give compound 9 (1.54 g, 45%) as a white solid. To a solution of 9 (1.54 g, 2.97 mmol) in anhydrous CH 2 Cl 2 (75 mL), DBU (8.89 mL, 59.5 mmol) and ethyl chloroformate (2. 26 g, 20.8 mmol) were added at 0°C and the mixture was heated to reflux for 12 h. After removal of the solvent, the residue was dissolved in MeOH (30 mL) and water (1 mL), and then treated with K 2 CO 3 (55 mg, 0.42 mmol). The new mixture was stirred for 1 h at rt and solvent was removed under reduced pressure.
