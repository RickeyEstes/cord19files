Isolate collection and identification S. marcescens isolates were collected biennially between 2002 and 2010, corresponding to periods IIIeVII of the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance (TSAR) program, from medical centers and regional hospitals throughout Taiwan. In 2002 were collected between July and September from the same 26 hospitals, except that isolates in 2006 were from 25 hospitals. 24, 25 These hospitals comprised 11 medical centers and 15 regional hospitals, which are located in all four regions of Taiwan, namely seven, eight, eight, and three hospitals in the north, central, south, and east regions, respectively. Details of the collection process of the TSAR program have been described previously. 19, 24, 25 Each isolate was subcultured onto the appropriate agar plates (BBL; Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, MD, USA) to check for purity. S. marcescens was identified by standard conventional biochemical tests followed by confirmation with the VITEK Gram-negative Identification plus cards (bioMérieux VITEK, Hazelwood, MO, USA), and analytical profile index (API) 20E or API 32GN (bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France).
