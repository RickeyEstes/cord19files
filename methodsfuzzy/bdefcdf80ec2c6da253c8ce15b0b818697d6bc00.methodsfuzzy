Recombinant plasmids were used for method establishment. For each target, 2 μl of the plasmid was mixed with 2 μl of 2.5 × PCR mix (Intelligene Biosystems, Qingdao, China), 1 μl of PCR primers (0.5 μM each), and 1 μl ddH 2 O. PCR was performed at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 56°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. After amplification, shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) was used to digest excess dNTPs at 37°C for 30 min, and then the SAP was inactivated at 85°C for 5 min. The mass probe extension was performed using the Mass Probe Extension Kit (Intelligene Biosystems). Briefly, the reaction mixture was incubated with 1 μl of 10 × MPE buffer, 0.3 μl of MPE enzyme, 0.7 μl of MPE Termix, 1 μl of mass probe. The reaction procedure was 95°C for 10 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 37°C for 60 s and 72°C for 60 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 3 min. The products were desalted using Resin for 30 min, and centrifuged at 5000×gfor 2 min. The Focus Plate was pretreated with 1 μl of Nucleotide Matrix. 0.5 μl of each desalting product was mixed with 0.5 μl of Nucleotide Matrix, and the mixture was spotted on the surface of pretreated Focus Plate. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Quan SNP software v 2.0 (Intelligene Biosystems). Besides, to detect 10 viruses and the internal control simultaneously, 11 pairs of PCR primers were mixed to amplify the target genes of 10 viruses and the internal control, and the mixture of 11 mass probes were used to extend single base. The mixed plasmids of 10 viruses and internal control (10 4 copies/μl) were used as the template to optimize the concentration of mass probe. All the recombinant plasmids were constructed with a concentration of 10 10 copies/μl. In this study, we first developed the MS-based method using the plasmid to detect DHAV-1, DHAV-3, DAstV-1, DAstV-2, DRV-1, DRV-2, TMUV, AIV, GPV, and DEV, respectively. As shown in Fig. S1 , the lines marked as the virus name indicate the mass probe (such as DHAV-1), and the lines marked as the extended nucleotidevirus name indicate the extended mass probe (such as T-DHAV-1). When there is a peak at the extended mass probe line, it means the detection result is positive. All the 10 viruses and the internal control could be detected. Then, the 11-plex method was established to simultaneously detect the recombinant plasmids of 10 duck-origin pathogenic viruses and β-actin (Fig. 1b) . To achieve the best amplification signal of the MS-based reaction, the concentrations of mass probe were investigated. Based on the mass and the amplification efficiency, the concentrations were optimized. The optimization concentration of each extension primer in the primer mixture was 6.80 μM (β-actin), 6.00 μM (AIV), 7.20 μM (TMUV), 13.60 μM (DHAV-1), 6.00 μM (GPV), 10.00 μM (DRV-1), 6.80 μM (DAstV-2), 7.20 μM (DAstV-1), 15.60 μM (DRV-2), 12.00 μM (DEV), and 21.60 μM (DHAV-3), respectively (Fig. 1a) .
