The advent of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) technology has provided a significant tool for comprehensive airflow analysis of an entire room [32,43,57e59 ]. The analysis is achieved by numerically solving a set of partial differential equations representing the conservation of mass, momentum, energy, pollutant concentrations and turbulent quantities. The followings are the three groups of basic equations that govern the numerical solution for the thermal comfort and pollutant dispersal in a space: the continuity equation, NaviereStokes equation and energy equation. These equations can be solved by specifying the initial and boundary conditions. CFD modelling results can be shown through user friendly graphical tools. The accuracy of CFD modelling results must be verified by comparison with field data. Generally, the airflow in healthcare premises is turbulent. Most CFD solutions predict turbulence with modelled transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy (k) and its dissipation rate (3), which is known as the ke3 model. The standard ke3 model is easy to program, numerically robust and reasonably accurate. Apart from the ke3 model, other CFD models include the re-normalisation group (RNG) ke3 model, Reynolds averaged NaviereStokes (RANS) equations, Reynolds stress viscous model and large eddy simulation. More information on CFD theories and their applications can be found in [58, 59] . Philips et al. [43] analysed different ventilation systems of isolation rooms using CFD models and suggested the provision of an anteroom for contagious patients. Similarly, Cheong and Phua [59] examined the airflow and pollution dispersal profiles for a "negative pressure" isolation room through experiments and CFD simulations. Three airflow schemes were investigated, and the results suggested that airflow schemes and furniture layout influence the airflow pollutant distribution. Beggs et al. [50] performed a CFD simulation using a standard ke3 model to explore the effect of airflow direction on the bio-aerosol concentration generated in a ward space. The results showed a significant variation between the ventilation strategies employed. It was concluded that a ceiling diffuser ventilation scheme is the most effective, improving the pollutant removal efficiency up to a 5 times. Qian et al. [8] integrated the Wells-Riley equation in a CFD model to predict the spatial infection risk distribution in a hospital ward, and the findings concurred closely with the infection distribution profile among the exposed students and patients. The above studies represent only a small amount of research that utilised CFD tools. To evaluate the comfort levels and pollutant removals, CFD tools are very helpful in determining the sufficiency of the current design and future improvements. Furthermore, CFD tools will save much time, effort and cost prior to a facility's construction.
