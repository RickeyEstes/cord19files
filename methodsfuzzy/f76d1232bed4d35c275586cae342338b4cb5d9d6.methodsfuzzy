Bioburden loads can be reduced by cleaning and disinfecting the tissue. These steps vary by tissue type and may include: • debridement; • low doses of preirradiation (irradiation before other chemical processing steps); • physical methods such as lavage, pulsatile fluid flow, centrifuge, fluid bath rotation, and sonication; • enzymatic digestion of cellular material; • penetrating agents such as supercritical CO 2 in combination with chemical activators; • milder chemicals including alcohol, detergents, and antibiotics; • more aggressive chemicals such as NaOH, acetone, and peroxide. Cleaning processes can remove bone marrow elements, lipids, and low-molecular-weight proteins, thus reducing any graft immunogenic potential as well as bacterial, viral, and fungal contamination. 29 More aggressive agents that may be commonly used to disinfect bone, such as hydrogen peroxide, are not typically used for soft tissue grafts. At least one process that includes the use of hydrogen peroxide on tendons was correlated with a significant increase in risk for revision ACL repair. 30 In this case, however, the contribution of the hydrogen peroxide to apparent graft weakening is unclear because the process also includes pulsatile fluid flow. Cellular remnants and, presumably, associated infectious agents may also be removed through tissue decellularization methods, which will also be discussed in a later section. These methods include the use of chemicals such as nondenaturing anionic detergent, recombinant endonuclease, sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium hydroxide, sodium peroxide, sodium chloride, and antibiotics. [31] [32] [33] [34] Assurance of Tissue Sterility After processing to reduce or eliminate bioburden, the tissue is typically either tested for sterility or subjected to a terminal sterilization step. Testing for sterility usually involves sampling a portion of the tissue or processing solutions according to United States Pharmacopeia <71> sterility test guidelines before packaging. It is important to note that the United States Pharmacopeia <71> label does not necessarily indicate that the tissue product is sterile but rather that a sample of the product batch was culture negative thus passing the test for sterility. 35, 36 As an alternative to testing for sterility, the tissue may be processed, packaged, and then subjected to sterilization after placement in its final package thus at the terminus of the process. In this case of terminal sterilization the chosen method must effectively penetrate the packaging; such options will be discussed in subsequent sections. In terms of measuring sterility, an absolute assurance of sterility is not probabilistically feasible, but there is a measure known as sterility assurance level, commonly referred to as SAL. This designation indicates the degree, or level, of assurance of sterility achieved through a validated sterilization process. The two most common SALs for allografts are 10 -3 and 10 -6 . A product labeled with an SAL of 10 -3 indicates that there is a 1 in 1,000 chance of a single viable microbe present in the tissue, whereas an SAL of 10 -6 indicates a greater degree of sterility with a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of the same. An SAL of 10 -6 is the required level of sterilization by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention for medical instruments that breach the skin 37 and is thus often referred to as a medical device level of sterility. This level of sterility can only be achieved through terminal sterilization, though some terminally sterilized tissue products still retain an SAL of only 10 -3 . 38 Note that SAL is only a measure of microbial sterility and is unrelated to viruses, although the methods used to achieve an acceptable SAL may be effective at lowering viral risk. As mentioned previously, tissue processors use strict donor-screening and viral test methods to prevent viral transmission. Furthermore, several processing methods have been demonstrated to result in significant viral inactivation. For example, low-dose gamma irradiation was demonstrated to inactivate a broad spectrum of viruses, including HIV and enveloped, nonenveloped, DNA, and RNA viruses. 39 Another processing method uses vacuum and oscillating pressure combined with chemical agents to inactivate pathogens. 40 The use of a terminal sterilization process with the ability to inactivate a wide range of virus types is particularly advantageous as new viruses (e.g., Zika, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and so forth) emerge for which validated blood tests may not yet exist. Unlike organs and composite tissue allotransplants, which are typically transplanted within hours after the donor's death, allografts may be stored from weeks to years before use. Consequently, these grafts must be processed in ways that maintain their safety and clinical efficacy for an extended period of time. In addition to the processing and sterilization methods described previously, another factor which can impact the use and clinical effectiveness of allografts is the manner in which they are preserved, stored, and handled before use. Currently, allograft preservation typically includes using storage media, cryopreservation, or freeze-drying to store grafts in ambient, refrigerated, or frozen states. The storage temperature determines requirements for shipping, on-site storage, and presurgery preparation. There are several main considerations concerning the preservation and storage of allograft tissues: (1) cell viability if applicable, (2) maintaining the structural integrity and native properties of the bone or extracellular matrix, and (3) convenient storage and use. This section reviews the main types of preservation and storage, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. It is arranged by storage temperature, followed by preservation methods, if applicable. The methods are also summarized in Table 5 .1.
