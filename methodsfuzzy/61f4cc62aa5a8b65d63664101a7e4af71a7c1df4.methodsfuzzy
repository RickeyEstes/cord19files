Cell Lines and Subdoning. The derivation of the two BCL, .B, subclones, BCL,2 .62 (IgM producer) and BCL, .2.58 (IgM/IgGI producer), is described in the accompanying paper . BCL,2.54 is a sister subclone of BCL,2 .58 . For DNA analysis, we have employed additional independently derived IgM/IgGI subclones of the parental BCL, .B, line. The subclone BCL, . 13 .92 was I of the 12 BCL, .B2 subclones obtained at a frequency of 1 .35 x 10 -2 (12/888) by depositing one cell per well using a FACS III . The medium used for subdoning is the same as described in the accompanying paper. The subclone BCL, .6 .1 is a subclone of BCL, .2.58, derived in the same way. The subclones BCL,.15.9 and BCL, .15.19 were two of the seven BCL, .B2 subclones derived similarly at a frequency of 5 x 10' (7/1429), except that no WEHI 274 SN was added to the medium . As in the case of BCL,.2.58, all subclones except BCL, .6.1 secrete more IgM than IgGI and preliminary data of surface immunofluorescence indicate that all subclones express sIgM and sIgG. BCL,.6.1 secretes more IgGI than IgM (Y.-W . Chen et al., unpublished data). Southern Hybridization Analysis . Procedures for genomic DNA isolation and blotting were described in the preceding paper. All washings were done in 3x SSC plus 0 .1 % SDS, three times at room temperature, followed by washing in O.lx SSC, 0 .1% SDS at 42°C for 1 h, with the exception of the pe-(see probes) probed filter, which was washed at 65°C. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN), New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and Bethesda Research Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions . Electrophoresis was carried out as described in the accompanying paper (in 1 % agarose at 40 V for 18 h). Probes. Genomic or cDNA probes were prepared by gel isolation (20) of restriction fragments from previously characterized recombinant clones, except for pyl and pe where the whole plasmids were used. To insure that no repetitive sequences were present in the probes, particularly in fragments derived from introns, DNAs were digested with various enzymes and subjected to Southern analysis with "P-labeled mouse genomic DNA as a probe . Only nonhybridizing fragments were employed for further experiments . Relative positions of the probes are shown in Figs . 2, A-R and 6, S-U . Ali DNAs were labeled by nick translation (21) to a specific activity of^-10 8 cpm/tag . Probe A : A 700-bp Pvu II/Pst I fragment of pu3741 (cDNA clone) (22) Karyotyping. Cells from the BCL,B, and BCL, .2 .58 lines were grown to exponential phase and cells were harvested for karyotypic G-banding analysis (32, 33) . Densitometry . For band quantification, autoradiographs were scanned with a densitometer (model GS 300, Hoefer Instruments), and densities were calculated using a Bio-Rad model 33E2A integrator . C., s and C,2, (9 .2, 6.6, and 6 .4 kbp, respectively) in liver (lane 2), BCLI IgM producers (lanes 4 and 5) and BCL, .B 2 (lanes 3, 6-8) . Likewise, with the more upstream probes L, K and J (Fig . 4,b-d) , the BCLI and BCL I .B2 patterns are identical to those of the liver. Although no rearrangement occurred between y3 and y,, it still remained possible that expression of y l might be affected by a recombination between b and y3 . For example, a deletion within this region would appreciably reduce the length of a putative J r-Ca-Cy transcription unit . As summarized in Fig. 2 , we detected no rearrangements in BCL I .B, and BCLI .B 2 relative to liver within thiŝ -55 kbp area with the exception of only 7 .9 kbp of repetitive DNA (between fragment 4 and 7) that was difficult to confirm . Similarly, in the BCL I .B 2 cells, downstream genes from Cy 1 to Ca remain in germline context. Taken together, these results strongly argue that DNA rearrangement of CH genes is not responsible for expression of y, in BCL, . 1 and 4) , C,s (probe V) (lanes 3 and 6), and a mixture of probes S and V (lanes 2 and 5) . In Fig. 5c, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6 , the 17 kbp and 7.5 kbp fragments were C,2n gene crosshybridizations with probe W. The 6.2 kbp fragment is the Bgl I fragment containing VDJ sequences located on the H' allele (see Fig. 6 ) . kb markers are shown. (Fig . 3) . Both lines contain two copies of the t(12 ;16) chromosome . But a single, apparently identical variable region rearrangement is observed when Eco RI blots of BCL I .2.58, BCL I .B I and BCL I .2.62 DNA are probed with a JH region fragment (probe S and Fig . 6 of accompanying paper) . In addition, a single VDJ H2-containing band was obtained in Xba I, Hind III, Bam HI and Bgl I digests of all the BCL I .B 2 subclones probed with JH (accompanying paper and data not shown) . These data suggested that each BCL I .B 2 allele possessed an identically rearranged VDJ . However, Kpn I digests revealed a rearrangement of one of the two BCL I .B2 alleles with respect to BCL I .B I . As shown in Fig . 5a 4-6, 8) , suggesting that all BCL I .B 2 lines, although independently cloned, were derived from a common parental variant . When a similar Kpn I blot was probed with Cu ( Fig . 5 b) , only a single hybridizing band, corresponding to the 17 .8-kbp fragment from the unrearranged allele of BCL1 .B 1 , was detected in BCL, .B 2. To map the rearrangement more precisely, we performed similar Kpn I blots with probes (T and U) that extend directly from the Eco RI site in the JH-Cp intron . In all cases, only the 17 .8-kbp fragment hybridized (data not shown) . Since there is only a single Eco RI band in J3J,,4 blots, the rearrangement had to occur just 3' (<50 bp) to the Eco RI site in the J,,-Cp intron . Otherwise, the 12 .5-kbp band would have been detected by probe T or U in BCL, .B 2.
