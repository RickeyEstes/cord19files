In order to provide more rapid, sensitive and highly specific results, molecular technologies, based on the detection of ribosomal RNA of a wide variety of bacteria in a platelet contami-nated sample containing 1-10 CFU/mL, have also been evaluated. 10, 25 In 1999, Chaney et al. described a new process allowing the targeting of bacterial ribosomal RNA in five steps: i) cell lyses leading to the release of ribosomal RNA, ii) hybridization of bacterial ribosomal RNA with biotin and ruthenium-labeled oligonucleotide probe pairs, iii) capture of the labeled ribosomal RNA with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, and then iv) setting of the RNA on an electrode surface and detection of ruthenium-labeled ribosomal RNA by application of voltage, v) followed by the generation of an electrochemiluminescent signal. By this approach, the authors were able to obtain a linear relationship between the electrochemiluminescent signal representing the ribosomal RNA level with the number of CFU/mL. 26, 27 However, even if this method appeared to be suitable for routine application, its sensitivity was not sufficient. It only allowed the detection of approximately 10 5 CFU/mL. 27 Störmer et al. recently published the results of a study evaluating bacterial spreading in the different blood components infected by inoculation of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using RT-PCR, Klebsiella pneumoniae was detected in platelet concentrates immediately after its preparation. Staphylococcus epidermidis, which has a slower growth, was only detected 24 hours after the whole separation process. The authors concluded that a 24 hour storage was necessary before processing to RT-PCR. 17 Even if molecular based technologies represent a high potential for bacterial detection, their applicability in the context of detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates has not yet been demonstrated. Furthermore, their use is limited by the cost, complexity of use and, more critically, by the availability of bacterial-derived nucleic acid amplification reagents. 25 In a review of the literature published in 2004 about how to improve the bacteriological safety of platelet transfusions, Blajchman et al, pointed out that all bacterial contaminants cannot currently be detected by molecular methods and that it is not clear if bacterial DNA or rRNA is the most appropriate test marker. 28 One of the most important practical problems with the use of broad-range PCR is the contamination of the assay by exogenous bacterial DNA of the nucleotide amplification reagents, particularly of the bacterial derived enzymes and the bacterial DNA sequences commonly found in human blood. Moreover, the detection of a minor amount of bacterial DNA among a high quantity of human DNA may also constitute a problem. 25 To our knowledge, methods based on bacterial amplification techniques are not currently employed in routine screening of platelet concentrates. The INTERCEPT blood system ® (Cerus Corporation) uses amotosalen which is a synthetic psoralen, an organic compound found in fruit and vegetables like limes and celery. 29 Amotosalen compound has the potential to penetrate into cells, to cross the nuclear membrane, and to reversibly intercalate into helical regions of nucleic acid. Exposure to a longwave-length ultraviolet light (UVA, 320-400 nm) leads to covalent crosslinks between amotosalen molecules and pyrimidine bases, blocking DNA and RNA replication (cells and pathogens with nucleic acid genomes). After light treatment, the residual amotosalen as well as its metabolites are removed by a compound adsorbing device during a prolonged incubation. Platelets do not have nuclei and are not affected by psoralens. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] In 2005, Lin et al. reported results that advocate the efficiency of such an approach for virus inactivation. The authors studied 10 different families of viruses including: i) the most relevant for blood transfusion like HIV-1, HIV-2, HBV, HTLV-1, HTLV-2 or CMV, ii) viruses of emerging interest like parvovirus B19, West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndromehuman coronavirus, and vaccinia virus, and, iii) model viruses like duck hepatitis virus (an HBV model), bovine viral diarrhea virus (an HCV model), bluetongue virus, feline conjunctivitis virus, simian adenovirus 15 and porcine parvovirus. According to the FDA, the process was defined as being effective if the pathogen load was reduced by 6-10 logs. The results of this study showed a significant log reduction of enveloped viruses that were uniformly sensitive to inactivation. The non-enveloped viruses showed a variable sensitivity to inactivation. Parvovirus B19 and human adenovirus 5 were inactivated to the limit of detection, whereas the other non-enveloped viruses were resistant to inactivation. 31 In 2006, Singh et al. reported that the photochemical treatment of plasma with amotosalen inactivates high levels of gram positive (Streptococcus epidermidis) and gram negative (Klebisella pneumoniae, Yersinia enterocolitica) bacterias. They determined that the mean log reductions achieved were >7.3 for Streptococcus epidermidis and Yersinia enterocolitica and >7.4 for Klebisella pneumoniae. Photochemical treatment was also efficient at high initial titers on spirochetes with mean-reductions >5.9 for Treponema pallidum and >10.6 for Borrelia burgdorferi and on protozoa with mean-reduc- [Hematology Reviews 2009; 1:e5] tion >6.9 for Plasmodium falciparum, >5 for Trypanosomia cruzi and >5.3 for Bancrofti microti. They also showed the maintenance of clotting time and plasma coagulation factor activity after photochemical treatment. 35, 36 Genomic DNA in leukocytes is modified by psoralens that are able to inactivate more than 5.4 logs of T lymphocytes and to disrupt more base pairs (1:83) than gamma-irradiation (1:37,000). 35 Grass et al. reported that a dose of 0.05 μmol/L of amotosalen, which is 3,000 fold lower than the dose used for viruses and bacteria inactivation, was sufficient to inactivate T lymphocytes after 1 J/cm 2 of UVA illumination. 33 The extreme sensitivity of the T lymphocytes to psoralens suggests that this treatment has the potential to reduce the incidence of leukocyte mediated adverse immune reactions associated with platelet transfusion like transfusion associated graft-versus-host disease and platelet related febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction. 12, 33, 37 Platelet concentrates treated with psoralens seem to have a comparable in vitro function compared with nontreated platelet concentrates and their viability seem to be conserved. 32, [38] [39] [40] In 2004, McCullough et al. reported the results of the SPRINT trial which was a prospective, randomized, controlled, doubleblind parallel group phase III study carried out to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of photochemical treated with amotosalen platelets compared with non-treated control platelets collected by apheresis. The efficacy was defined by prevention and treatment of significant bleeding: proportion of patients with WHO grade 2 bleeding as primary efficacy end point, the proportion with WHO grade 3-4 bleeding, number of days of WHO grade 2 bleeding, one hour and 24 hour platelet count increments, corrected count increments, number of days to next platelet transfusion, number of platelet transfusion incidence of platelet refractoriness and number of erythrocyte concentrate transfusions as secondary efficacy end points. Safety end points were defined by the number of platelet transfusion reactions, development of antibody to potential amotosalen neoantigens and overall safety. The study included 671 thrombocytopenic patients needing platelet transfusion support: 318 received photochemical treated platelets, 327 control platelets and 26 of them did not require platelet transfusion. This trial showed that whereas the hemostatic effect of both photochemical treated and control platelets were comparable, the transfusion of treated platelets was associated with a lower platelet count increment after transfusion. This lower platelet count increment could partly be explained by the lower mean platelet dose in the photochemical treated group (3.7×10 11 vs. 4×10 11 in the control group; p<0.01) and by a greater proportion of treated platelet that con-tained <3×10 11 platelets. Thus, patients who received photochemical treated platelets received more platelet transfusions and had a shorter interval between transfusion than patients who received conventional platelets. 41 Studies performed in animals and humans reported no evidence for a toxicity of psoralen treatment. 34, 40, 42 Webert et al. related acute toxicity with amotosalen after UVA activation in rats with a lethal threshold dose of 150 mg/kg. In dogs, central nervous system alterations were observed after a threshold dose of 30 mg/kg. These doses were respectively 150,000 and 30,000 fold higher than the dose used for pathogen inactivation. Reproductive toxicity, determined by histological rather than functional evaluation, was observed at a threshold of 0.35 mg/kg, which was 350 times higher than the dose used for pathogen inactivation. Moreover, all substances used for pathogen inactivation are water soluble and rapidly excreted avoiding the bioaccumulation of trace amounts in treated blood products. 35 In addition, transfusion of platelets or plasma treated with this method did not appear to induce adverse immunological response when evaluated by searching the presence of neoantigens. 29, 35, 41 In 2005, Lin et al. evaluated the potential of photochemical treatment with amotosalen to create neoantigens. They quantified the amounts of residual amotosalen and photoproducts in photochemical treated platelets and plasma. Patients' serum samples from 7 Phase III clinical trials including 523 patients who received more than 8,000 units of treated platelets or plasma, were assayed by enzyme linked immunsorbent assay (ELISA) for antibodies to amotosalen neoantigens. The results indicated that no neonatigens were detected by ELISA after photochemical treatment with amotosalen. 29  The Mirasol ® PRT (Navigant Biotechnologies Inc.) system is similar to the psoralenbased method, but uses a different photo-sensitizer, riboflavin (vitamin B2) instead of psoralen. Riboflavin is a natural component found in food (milk, beer, eggs, yeasts, leafy vegetables), and is classified as a "Generally-Regarded-As-Safe" compound by the FDA. 30, 43, 44 Riboflavin interacts with nucleic acids after exposure to UV light (280-360 nm) and causes irreversible damage to DNA/RNA (direct electron transfer, production of singlet oxygen and production of hydrogen peroxide leading to the formation of hydroxyl radicals). A compound adsorbing device removal process for residual riboflavine metabolites may not be necessary. 30, 43 Perez-Pujol et al. have studied the impact of this method on the functional and biochemical characteristics of platelet concentrates. They observed, with flow cytometry studies, the same changes in treated and nontreated platelets, without modification of FvW, fibrinogen and FVa levels after five days of storage. They also showed that treated platelets have adhesive and cohesive functions similar to non-treated platelets. 45 Ruane et al. have shown that the Mirasol ® PRT system is able to inactivate viruses and bacteria in platelet concentrates. They observed significant log reductions for cell-associated and cellfree HIV, West Nile virus, porcine parvovirus, and for gram positive and gram negative bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis or Escherichia coli. The authors noted that the platelet pH and the lactate production rate were, as suggested by the literature data, predictive of recoveries in 50.8-59.8%. Therefore, they used platelet pH and lactate production rate as platelet quality indicators and concluded that platelet cell quality was maintained after treatment and during storage. 46 Goodrich et al. reviewed Mirasol ® PRT performances and confirmed that this system was able to inactivate viruses and various bacteria species such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Serratia marcescens. These data suggested a significant reduction of the risk of platelet related bacteria transmission. 16, 44, 47 Kumar et al. showed an increased genomic DNA degradation in leukocytes and bacteria after riboflavin and UV light treatment, 48 also suggesting that Mirasol ® PRT technology may be an alternative to gamma irradiation to prevent transfusion associated graftversus-host disease. 43 In December 2007, Klein et al. reported in a consensus conference about pathogen inactivation (Toronto, March 2007) that pathogen inactivation methods should be implemented as soon as feasible and safe methods to inactivate a broad spectrum of infectious agents are available. 12 The authors established a list of existing criteria and procedures that should be changed in case of implementation of pathogen inactivation such as the suppression of screening tests for: i) Treponema pallidum; ii) agents of low infectious titer and destroyed early by pathogen inactivation like West Nile virus, which is actually systematically tested in the US and Canada; iii) agents that are sensitive to pathogen inactivation for which redundant safety measures are taken (CMV, HTLV, HbsAg and those for which the methods of detection available nowadays lack specificity and sensitivity like those used to detect bacteria). Moreover, gamma irradiation of blood components performed to eliminate the risk of transfusion associated graft-versus-host disease could be eliminated. The authors conclude that an agent that is known to be adequately inactivated by these technologies should not require screening tests unless of an unusually high infectious titer. 12
