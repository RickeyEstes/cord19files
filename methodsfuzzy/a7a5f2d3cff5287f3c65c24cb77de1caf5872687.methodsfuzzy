Restriction endonuclease and Bal 31 exonuclease digestions and ligations were performed as recommended by the suppliers. Plasmid purification, agarose gel electmplforesis, and DNA-mediated transformation of E. coil were performed according to standard procedures (Maniatis et al., 1982) . Plasmids were introduced into yeast cells by the lithium acetate transforma-tion method (Ito et al., 1983) . E. coli strain MC1061 was used for all plasmid manipulations and JM103 was used for M13 phage work. DNA sequencing was performed by the chain termination method of Sanger et al. (1977) using Ml3mpl8 and mpl9 vectors (Yanisch-Perron et al., 1985) . In one case, sequencing was primed using a synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides 441-459 of DAP2 (see Fig. 2 ), prepared at the University of Oregon Biotechnology Laboratory on a DNA synthesizer (model 380B; Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) as described (Ito et al., 1982) . DNA and amino acid sequence analyses were performed using the sequence analysis software package (version 4) of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group. Plasmid pRG1 was constmc~xl by inserting the 4.7-kb Bam HI-Pst I (blunt-ended by treating with T4 DNA polymerase) DAP2 fragment (Fig.  1) , isolated from the original DAP2 plasmid YEpl3-GS13-4 (Julius et al., 1983) , into the Barn HI-Sma I sites of pUC12. Plasmid pGP3, a multicopy 2-#m plasmid containing the DAP2 gene, was constructed by inserting the 4.7-kb Bam HI-Pst I (blunt-ended) fragment from pRG1 into the Bam HI-Pvu II sites of YEp24. A chromosomal DAP2 deletion was constructed by transplacing the genomic copy with the cloned gene into which the LEU2 gene was inserted in place of 1.3 kb of the DAP2 coding region (Rothstein, 1983;  Fig. 1 ). Plasmid pRGI was digested with BstE II and Kpn I, treated with T4 DNA polymerase to make blunt ends, and ligated with a 2.1-kb Hpa I fragment containing the LEU2 gene. The resulting plasmid (pGP2) was cut with Barn HI and Pst I and used to transform the yeast strain JHRY20-2C (leu2-3, 1eu2-112). Stable LEU+ transformants were purified and screened for the lack of thermolabile dipeptidyl aminopeptidase activity, assayed as described previously (Julius et al., 1983) . Plasmid pC JR6, a multicopy 2-#m yeast vector containing the DPAP B coding region fused to the GAL/promoter, was constructed by inserting a 400-bp Eco RI-Hind III GAL/ promoter fragment (Johnston and Davis, 1984) into the Eco RI and Hind III sites of pSEYS, and subsequently subcloning into the Hind III site of this plasmid (pCJR5) the 2.9 kbp Hind IIl fragment of DAP2 (Fig. 1) , resulting in the fusion of the GAL/ promoter at position -90 of DAP2. DPAP B antigen for production of antiserum was made in E. coli by fusing a portion of the DAP2 coding region into the E. coli expression vector priSe5, which contains the T4 phage lysozyme gene under the control of the TAC promoter (Muchmore et al., 1988 ; kindly provided by R. Dahlquist, University of Oregon). Plasmid pRGI was digested with Stu I, treated briefly with Bal 31 exonuclease, and further digested with Hind III. Fragments of "~1,650 bp were cloned into the Sna BI-Hind III sites of priSe5, resulting in the production of a hybrid protein consisting of the NH2-terminal seven residues of T4 phage lysozyme fused to the COOH-terminal half of DPAP B. Transformants were screened for an isopropyl ~-D-thiogalactopyranoside-(IPTG) inducible protein species by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970) of total E. coil cell extracts. A plasmid was isolated (pRG2) which produced a large amount (*5 % lof total cell protein) of a 55-kD species upon induction with isopropyl B-D-thiogalactopyranoside.
