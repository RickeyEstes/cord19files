Since 1935, isolation of influenza virus grown in chick embryos has become the gold standard for the diagnosis of influenza. This must be performed despite being laborious, often taking up to a dozen or so days. Patient specimens often require several passages to obtain a viral hemagglutinin titer, which can then be used for a variety of tests (Krauss et al., 2012) . Isolation of the influenza virus responsible for the current infections, its identification, and the determination of the antigenic similarities between the strains circulating during a given season are necessary for the development of vaccine, i.e., for the selection of the candidate strains for the vaccine. These steps also are important from the epidemiological standpoint (George, 2012) . For many years isolation of the influenza virus has been performed in both chick embryos and in tissue culture. It was known for some time now that propagation in tissue culture has not been possible in some cases, although other methods have confirmed the presence of influenza virus in specimens from the patients concerned. Therefore, in the first instance replication of the virus should occur in chick embryos. It is worth noting that influenza vaccine is currently also produced in tissue culture, such as MDCK and Vero (Dwyer et al., 2006) . The early, correct and complete diagnosis of influenza is of particular importance at this time, not only in terms of treatment, but also to detect new unidentified pathogens, as was the case many times in the past in 1997 in (Brydak, 2008 Ganzenmueller et al., 2010) . Isolation of influenza virus from a patient gives valuable information about the type and subtype of virus circulating in the territory of the given population which is very important in the context of the Global Influenza Surveillance Response System (Brydak, 2008) . It is also pertinent to the costs incurred for the treatment of patients and their hospitalization in the case of misdiagnosis (Nitsch-Osuch et al., 2012) . Traditional diagnostic methods for the detection of influenza virus in specimens from patients also include analysis based on the detection of viral antigens in immunofluorescence, immunoenzymatic, and immunochromatographic assays (Brydak, 2008) . Serological methods are much faster and less costly than viral culture methods, but may have a lower sensitivity and specificity compared with the culture methods described above. Immunofluorescence tests (IF), which enable the identification of antigens of a specific type of influenza virus in clinical samples are used frequently (Kapelusznik et al., 2009; Berg et al., 2011; ) . The method utilizes specific antibody labeled with a fluorescent dye such as fluorescein which binds to a particular antigen of influenza virus type A or B. A positive result is obtained when the antigen antibody complex emits a green light visible against the contrasting background stain for human epithelial cells. Readings are taken with a fluorescent microscope (Nutter et al., 2012) . Direct fluorescentantibody testing has a high specificity (99%), but lower sensitivity (65%) (Bakerman et al., 2011) . Immunoenzymatic tests (IE) are also used in diagnostic laboratories for the rapid detection of influenza virus antigens. Several evaluations comparing immunoassay with the classical method of virus culture have shown that the sensitivity of IE is highly variable and ranges between 44-95% for both types of influenza virus (Jennings et al., 1981; Rapicetta et al., 1982) . From December to March during periods of greater incidence of respiratory infections, an increase in IE influenza virus sensitivity to 74-100% is also evident (Petric et al., 2006) . This relationship can be accounted for by the decrease in human immunity typical of the autumn-spring season, which may contribute to the more rapid replication of influenza virus and the relatively long persistence of viral particles in the body (Brydak, 2008; Kumar and Henrickson, 2012) . IE tests enable the simultaneous detection and differentiation of influenza A and B. On the basis of tests performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients, the specificity of the test for influenza A and B was 100%, while the average sensitivity for influenza type A was 82.9% and for influenza B was 51.5% (Brydak, 2008 (Brydak, , 2012 . Rapid tests for the detection of influenza virus antigen, based on the method of immunochromatography (IC) are also available. These tests provide confirmation of the presence of influenza viruses within 15 min (Nitsch-Osuch et al., 2012) . Since they are simple to use, they find practical application especially in the setting of primary care and family medicine (Nitsch-Osuch et al., 2013) . An evaluation of the diagnostic value of rapid immunochromatographic tests for the detection of antigen influenza virus type A and B in specimens from the respiratory tract revealed that the sensitivity and specificity of detection of the two types of virus was 65% and 100% respectively (Kok et al., 2010; Nitsch-Osuch et al., 2012) . It should be stressed that the diagnostic sensitivity of different types of strips, cassette immunochromatographic tests and immunoassays is not very much less reliable than for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, they are easier to perform and do not require the use of equipment or highly qualified personnel (Petrozzino et al., 2010; Takahashi et al., 2010) . Furthermore, the estimated cost of a single IC test is about 10 times lower than the costs incurred in the case of molecular methods. These tests are generally designed for use in the acute phase of infection, when virion numbers are not less than 10 5 -10 6 PFU (plaque forming unit). Samples taken too late in the recovery period or stored improperly may contain antigen concentrations below the detection limit (Brydak, 2008; Jacobus and Raja, 2012; Nitsch-Osuch et al., 2012) . Any doubts about the reliability of the result, especially when it is inconsistent with clinical signs, should be resolved on the basis of the reference test applying molecular biology techniques (Biggs et al., 2010) . In the case of influenza virus this is the RT-PCR method using specific primers and the corresponding thermal profile of the amplification reaction (George, 2012) . Virological diagnosis also includes serological tests, involving the detection of specific antibodies against a defined type of influenza virus, although they are of limited use especially in the rapid diagnosis of respiratory infections (Brydak, 2008) . When employing such methods, particular attention should be given to the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. This type of test involves a measurement of the level of specific anti-influenza antibodies most often that of antihemagglutinin (Brydak, 2012) . Changes in the level of antibodies between serum samples from the period of acute illness and of that of recovery or after a few weeks may confirm or refute the presence of infection with influenza virus. The hemagglutination inhibition test (HI) and neuraminidase inhibition test (NI) are performed very frequently in research studies to evaluate the humoral immune response after vaccination against influenza virus (Brydak, 2008) . Nucleic acid amplification methods play an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of influenza virus. They are characterized by much higher sensitivity and specificity than other classical techniques. The molecular detection of viral RNA also provides for the early detection of influenza virus infection, already at the onset of symptoms, before the virion numbers reach the level required by other methods (Brydak, 2008; Landry, 2011) . The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a highly specific amplification of the selected nucleic acid fragment, specific to the type of influenza virus and is determined by the sequence of the specific primers used in the reaction (Poon et al., 2009) . Visualization of the resulting PCR amplification products is made possible by their separation in agarose gel (less frequently in polyacrylamide gel) and the use of fluorescent dye, e.g., ethidium bromide which intercalates into the double-stranded DNA (Brydak, 2008) . Influenza virus belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family which store their genetic information in the RNA sequence. The identification of influenza virus requires recoding as a DNA sequence (derived complementary DNA-cDNA) before amplification of the characteristic fragments of its genome. The modification of PCR by adding a reverse transcription step is known as reverse transcriptase-PCR. The RT-PCR reaction may take two forms: a one stage process (one-step RT-PCR), where both the reverse transcription and PCR reactions are performed in one test tube; alternatively, a two stage process (two-step RT-PCR), with transcription of viral RNA into cDNA in the first stage and amplification of certain sequences in the second stage (Brydak, 2008 (Brydak, , 2012 . Numerous scientific reports indicate that the two-step process is characterized by better sensitivity (Poon et al., 2009; Wang and Taubenberger, 2010) . In order to detect the presence of factors in the test sample which inhibit the PCR reaction, internal control is performed using primers which are complementary to the sequence of the reference gene, and which are always expressed in human epithelial cells. These genes include ␤2-microglobulin, ␤-actin, ␥-actin, RNA-ase and ornithine decarboxylase (Brydak, 2012) . In view of the large variability of influenza virus its detection in a clinical specimen necessitates the use of primers which are complementary to highly conserved gene sequences and regions with a minimal variation within these genes. The most conserved influenza virus genes are those encoding the M protein and the nucleoprotein, and usually they are used to design primers/probes. In order to differentiate strains of influenza virus type A, primers/probes are hybridized to conserved regions in the gene for hemagglutinin or neuraminidase (Brydak, 2008) . Conventional PCR methods are increasingly being replaced by real-time PCR, using fluorescent techniques, which enables monitoring of the amplification product in each cycle of the PCR reaction (Brydak, 2008) . It is preferred because of some simplification of the automation technology and of a significantly less time-consuming process. The main advantage of this method is its quantitative nature, in contrast to the classical PCR method which provides a qualitative result (present/absent) only. Labeled probes bind to the replicated viral RNA providing for the measurement of the number of particles which allows for the determination of the initial level of viremia and for monitoring of the effects of therapy in patients with influenza (Brydak, 2012) . The main disadvantage of this diagnostic method is its cost. Scientific reports indicate that test duration much shorter than 24 h and the rapid confirmation of the viral etiology of infection may explain the use of such an expensive test for routine diagnostics (George, 2012; Wang and Taubenberger, 2010) . Furthermore, refraining from administering antibiotics and the rapid inclusion of appropriate treatment are factors which support the use of this method. A test has been developed based on the method of multiplex realtime PCR, which makes possible the simultaneous identification of influenza virus type A and B, parainfluenza 1-3, hMPV, RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus (229E, OC43, NL63) and the atypical Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae microorganisms in nasopharyngeal secretions. The authors of the report on this matter estimate that the cost of the analysis of a single clinical specimen in this test is significantly lower when compared to the standard methods of detecting single pathogens and amounts to about 33 Euro (Brydak, 2008) .
