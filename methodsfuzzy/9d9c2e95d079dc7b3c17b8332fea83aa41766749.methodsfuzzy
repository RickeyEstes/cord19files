A retrospective medical records search based on the diagnosis of myelomas was performed for nine cats between 1986 and 2002; all nine cats were referred and treated by the author. Parameters abstracted from each cat's medical record: age, breed, sex, complete blood haematological and biochemical analysis results, feline leukaemia, feline immune deficiency and coronavirus (FIP) antibody titre test results, relative serum viscosity readings, serum protein electrophoresis and agar gel immunoelectrophoresis results, radiological findings, bone marrow aspiration cytologies or biopsy findings, routine urinalysis, urine electrophoresis and urine heat precipitation test results. The owners were questioned about the medical history of the animal. Each cat underwent a full clinical, orthopaedic and neurological examination. Haemoglobin and total white cell count were measured on a Sysmex 520 impedance counter (Vet Lab), packed cell volume (PCV) was measured by microhaematocrit, and MCV and MCHC derived arithmetically. Differential white cell counting was performed by microscopy. All biochemistry analyses were performed by standard methods on a I lab 600 clinical chemistry system (Instrumentation Laboratories, Vet Lab). This included creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen calcium values (including ionised calcium). Serum electrophoresis was performed in all cats using the technique described by Kerr (1991) : protein fractions were separated on a polyacrylamide gel at pH 8.4. The dried and stained gel was then scanned by a densitometer to produce the typical electrophoretic trace. This was compared to the normal patterns for the species. Immunoelectrophoresis to determine the class of paraprotein using the technique by Schultz and Adams (1978) was performed in three cats. Following electrophoretic separation of serum proteins, troughs were cut into the agarose gel parallel to the separated serum proteins. Antisera specific for each of the major Ig classes were loaded into the troughs and the gel was incubated for 24 h. The antiserum diffused from the trough and formed an arc of precipitation where it encountered specific antigen. Urine was analysed in all cats using Nephur-6 test chemical strips (Roche-Vet Lab), specific gravity was measured by refractometry. Bacteriology was carried out by standard bacteriological culture methods. Urine was also evaluated for the presence of light chains of myeloma proteins (Bence Jones) by heat precipitation methods described by Terry et al (1973) . Urine was heated to 40e60(C. If Bence Jones proteins are present a protein precipitation is observed which redissolves on boiling at 100(C and reprecipitates on cooling again from 85 to 60(C. Light chains appear electrophoretically as homogeneous band. Relative serum viscosity was determined by the RBC pipette method as described by Wright and Jenkins (1970) . The red cell pipette was filled by suction of 1 ml of plasma from a standard tube. The time flow between the lines immediately above and below the bulb reservoir was recorded, the flow time of the plasma in seconds was divided by the flow time for water in seconds, this gave the relative viscosity of the plasma carried at room temperature. The normal flow of water is 90 s, 2e3 min for normal plasma. Thoracic and abdominal radiography was performed in all cats and survey bone radiography was performed in all cats to evaluate the presence of osteolytic bone lesions. Contrast myelography was performed in two cats. Ante-mortem surgical bone marrow aspirates were collected in eight cats (cases 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) with a Jamshidi bone marrow biopsy needle. The anatomical sites that were aspirated differed in different cats were: case 1 (L4/L5), case 3 (L6/L7), case 6 (C2/C3/C4), case 8 (left proximal tibia), case 9 (L5 and left and right stifles). The anatomical site of aspiration was based on the suspected sites of multiple myelomas noted on the radiographs (as in the five cases described above) or the most accessible site for bone aspiration as in cases 4, 5 and 7 where the proximal humerus was aspirated. A post-mortem section of the affected bone was sampled for histopathology in cases 1, 2, 4, 8 and 9. They were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, decalcified in 20% formic acid, embedded in paraffin wax and sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Initial treatment included intravenous administration of sodium chloride 0.9% or lactated Ringer's solution, to correct dehydration if present and improve renal perfusion. Supportive treatments including antibiotics, diuretics and vasodilators were prescribed in individual cases as follows. Nitroglycerine ointment (1 cm topically every 6 h) to help heart conditions if present. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate (30 mg/kg body weight, IV) initially, followed by two treatments of 15 mg/kg body weight, IV every 6 h. Therapy was used to relieve spinal cord compression if present. Therapy for hypercalcaemia, if present, consisted of rehydration with intravenous saline. Cage immobilisation to induce rest was employed if pathological fractures were present.
