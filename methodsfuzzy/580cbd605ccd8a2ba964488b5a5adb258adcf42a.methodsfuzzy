For environmental surface sampling, the International Organization of Standardization (2017) recommends swabbing with a sterile cotton swab presoaked in PBS followed by RNA extraction and reverse transcription, real time PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis for HAV and hNoV sampling and detection on nonporous FCS. In the U.S., there is not a standardized method available. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2012) does recommend the use of swabs for obtaining norovirus from environmental surfaces; however, the CDC has also reported that swabbing is highly variable and that the interpretation of results should be conducted with caution. Currently, hNoVs are most often detected by RT-qPCR due to its high sensitivity and low detection limits using measurements such as PCR amplifiable units (PCRU/ml). These PCRUs are determined by a standard curve produced from a 10-fold dilution series of the virus where one PCRU corresponds to the highest dilution with a quantifiable RT-qPCR value (or cycle threshold [C T ] value) (Knight et al., 2013; Tung et al., 2013) . However, Knight et al. (2013) pointed out that the determination of PCRUs in correspondence to specific C T values is dependent on the sample matrix and the standard used. Moreover, the cutoff C T values (i.e. endpoint of detection) for hNoVs also vary across studies ranging from 32 to 40 (Knight et al., 2013) . The presence of inhibitory components within some sample matrices could impact amplification efficiencies especially in contaminated food and environmental samples that typically have low viral loads (Knight et al., 2013; Sair et al., 2002) . Regardless, RT-qPCR is primarily chosen for the analysis of viruses in environmental and food samples to allow for increased sensitivity to detect low viral concentrations that are typically present (Knight et al., 2013) . However, as the authors of the review indicated, this method cannot determine infectivity since it may recognize intact or degraded viral nucleic acid, nonviable viruses, or defective viral particles (Knight et al., 2013) . Consequently, the use of surrogates and other infectivity assays remain important in investigating enteric viral viability and infectivity in lab-based studies as further discussed in Section 2.3.2. As evidenced by Table 1 , surface sampling methods used in the recovery of enteric viruses are highly variable and diverse. A majority of studies focus on swabbing for a variety of reasons. In fact, the International Organization of Standardization (2017) recommends hNoV sampling and detection on nonporous FCS to be collected with a cotton swab moistened with PBS followed by RNA extraction and reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis. Other tools and methods such as repeated pipetting, cell scraping, and sonication/stomaching have been used for viral persistence and disinfection studies (Arthur and Gibson 2015; Mattison, 2011; Yeargin et al., 2015) . Other surface sampling methods such as vortexing, repeated pipetting, stomaching/sonication, and cell scraping have been used for baseline information for viral persistence studies and disinfection studies (Table 1 ). The studies summarized in Table 1 use different surrogates, initial drying times, and elution buffers making it difficult to adequately compare the studies. Fallahi and Mattison (2011) recovered 37% of MNV-1 from stainless steel after a 20 min drying time using a repeated pipetting method with EBSS eluent. Mattison et al. (2007) recovered 11% of FCV from stainless steel after a 30 min drying time by vortexing for 30 s in EBSS eluent. Arthur and Gibson (2015) obtained recovery efficiencies of 10% and 30% for TuV from acrylic and stainless steel surfaces, respectively, after a drying time of 1 h using a cell scraping techniques. The cell scraping technique was confirmed as possible with TuV and has also been evaluated using FCV previously (Taku et al., 2002) . Taku et al. (2002) found consistently better mean virus efficiencies for FCV using 50 mM glycine (pH 6.5) from stainless steel surfaces in comparison to 50 mM glycine (pH 9.5) and Modified Eagle's medium (pH 7.2) using the scraping-aspiration method. The mean FCV recovery efficiencies for the scraping-aspiration method from stainless steel were reported to be 42% (glycine pH 6.5), 28% (glycine pH 9.5), and 10% (Modified Eagle's medium). The authors suggested the modified Eagle's medium complex composition may have played a role in being less efficient than the glycine buffers (Taku et al., 2002) . Taku et al. (2002) added cell scraping to the aspiration method for better recovery efficiencies speculating that cell scraping may facilitate release of virus from surface. In addition, Yeargin et al. (2015) recovered a range of 0.15% (cotton) to 35.22% (glass) for FCV and 0.85% (cotton) to 24.27% (glass) for MNV-1 from three surface types (i.e. polyester, cotton, and glass) using a stomaching/sonication method. The authors also found the recovery efficiencies to be highest for glass and lowest for polyester and cotton for both virus types. The recovery efficiencies were also reported to be significantly different among all surface types for the same virus type while only cotton swab recoveries showed a significant difference between MNV-1 and FCV (Yeargin et al., 2015) . Similar to other techniques, more studies with inclusion of more virus types and standardized drying times are needed to provide information on using these alternative techniques for future persistence and environmental sampling studies.
