Virus isolates. A plaque-purified isolate of equine torovirus, Berne strain (isolate 545 P138/72) (EToV) was kindly provided by Raoul de Groot (Utrecht University) and 546 cultured in equine dermis (ED) cells. This virus was initially isolated from a 547 symptomatic horse in 1972 (13). ED cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified 548 Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10 % foetal calf serum, 100 IU/mL 549 penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 1 mM non-essential amino acids, 25 mM HEPES 550 and 1 % L-glutamine in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . 551 .
