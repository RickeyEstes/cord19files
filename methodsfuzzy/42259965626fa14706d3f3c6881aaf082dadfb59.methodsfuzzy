There are a few thread-based microfluidic devices coulped with some other detection methods. Jarujamrus et al. (2018) described a complexometric and argentometric titrations using microfluidic threadbased analytical device for Mg(II) determination in water, rubber latex samples and chloride ion in water and food seasoning samples by length measurement. The fabrication of the microfluidic thread-based analytical device for the complexometric titration is shown in Fig. 7(a) . The analytical device was made from two 15 cm cotton pretreated thread tied together with a central knot and then immobilized onto a support to facilitate the sample loading with indicator solution. After the reaction between the target and deposited indicator at the test zone, a color change occurred along the thread with different lengths depending on the concentration of the analyte. The working concentration range of this device on Mg(II) determination and chloride ion were 25-1000 mg/L and 75-600 mg/L, respectively. The test results were in agreement with those obtained by classical titrations. This length measurement method on thread is vey simple and results can even been read by naked eye, which offers a cost-effective and convenient alternative tool for the conventional analytical chemistry or biochemistry. In addition, thread can also used for the applications of electrophoresis (Cabot et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018 Yang et al., , 2014a Yang et al., , 2014b Yang et al., , 2014c . Usually, thread-based electrophoresis devices usually require plasmatreated threads to obtain greater currents than that on native threads (Wei et The schematic of cotton thread device for room temperature nucleic acid rapid detection based on adenosine-based molecular beacon probe . Weng, et al. Biosensors and Bioelectronics 132 (2019) 171-185 microfluidic electrophoresis system to evaluate the zone electrophoresis upon 8 commercially available threads including 100% nylon bundle, 100% silk, 100% cotton, 100% polyester, 100% acrylic, 50% acrylic 50% nylon, 100% pure Merino wool and the waxed dental tape. It was found that the synthetic threads presented higher EOF, with acrylic (cyanide based) provided the highest value, while nylon bundle presented higher resolution and lower solute dispersion and, whilst also helped to minimize the contribution of Joule heating. They quantified of low abundance metabolites, riboflavin in human urine, on the system. Results showed that the separation could be achieved in less than a minute and a linear working rang of 0.1-15 mg/mL was obtained. Yang et al. (2014a) demonstrated an enzyme-doped thread-based device ( Fig. 7(b) ) on which liquid transportation, bio-reaction and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and electrochemical detection of urea and glucose could be simply achieved. When used in urea and glucose samples detection, linear dynamic range of 0.1 mM~10.0 mM (R 2 =0.9850) and 0.1 mM~13.0 mM (R 2 =0.9668) were obtained, respectively, which were sufficient for blood urea nitrogen and serum glucose determination. By using thread-based microfluidic devices for CE-EC detection, micromachining procedure can be avoid to fabricate the microfluidic channels. Therefore, flexible microfluidic configuration design can be easily achieved for a variety of bioanalysis. Lin and Lin (2016) developed a single polyester thread microfluidic X. Weng, et al. Biosensors and Bioelectronics 132 (2019) 171-185 Fig. 5. Schematic (A) and picture (B) of the electroanalytical device made by stainless steel pins and cotton thread and paper and the fabrication procedure. (C) Cyclic voltammograms recorded in a 500 μM solution of FeCO 2 H in 1 × PBS, pH 7.6 at a scan rate of 100 mV/s using seven independent thread-and-pin arrays (Glavan et al., 2016) . X. Weng, et al. Biosensors and Bioelectronics 132 (2019) 171-185 system for rapid mass spectrometry detection of liquid food and medical samples. The system was capable of sample loading and separation, pinch focusing and electrospray ionization. It consisted of a two electrodes and a single polyester thread. The thread was fixed on a PMMA chip with one end immersed in a buffer well to keep it wet through capillary force. Electric fields were applied on the electrodes to achieve the CE separation and electrospray ionization during which two neighboring buffer drops were applied to pinch the sample band into smaller width. The other end of the thread was put 4-10 mm in front of the mass spectrometry inlet for analyzing. This method is much simpler than conventional microfluidic electrophoresis chips.
