Viruses and cells MHV 1HM was obtained from Dr . S . Stohlman (Stohlman and Weiner, 1981) ; this virus was derived from suckling mouse brain homogenates and has been passed in tissue culture in our laboratory without plaque purification . The isolation of coronavirus SD has been described previously (Burks et al., 1980) . Both strains of virus were propagated in murine-delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells . These cells were maintained in Dulbeco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM ; GIBCO) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin . Infection of DBT monolayers was performed as previously described (Mendelman et al., 1983) . The virus inocula were prepared by infecting 75-cm 2 flasks of DBT cells with either MHV JHM or coronavirus SD for 16 hr, scraping and pelleting the cells, then suspending each flask's content in 4 .0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) . Infected cell suspensions were titered for infectious virus at the time of inoculation . The suspensions had titers of approximately 10 5 TCID50/ml .
