One gram of each faecal sample was cleaned and concentrated by a saturated sodium chloride flotation method and analysed for Cryptosporidium oocysts by epifluorescence microscopy as described by (Silverlås et al., 2009b) ). The entire wells were examined by epifluorescence microscopy, and oocysts enumerated at 200x magnification. An animal was considered Cryptosporidium positive if at least one oocyst was detected in the microscope. The lower detection limit of this method is 50 oocysts per gram of faeces (OPG). All Cryptosporidium positive samples collected at the first and fourth visits were analysed further to determine species and C. parvum subtype. DNA was extracted using the PowerLyzer ® PowerSoil ® DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Cat No. 12855-S) according to the manufacturer's recommendations but with the following modifications: up to 2 ml of each cleaned sample was spun down at 13,000 rpm for three minutes in an Eppendorf centrifuge and the pellet dissolved in 750 μl Bead Solution. The solution was transferred to the Glass Bead tube and 60 μl Solution C1 was added. The tubes were briefly vortexed and incubated at 100°C in a thermal block for 10 min, followed by bead beating using a MP Fast Prep 24 Bead Beater set at 6.5 M/S for one minute. Finally, the DNA was eluted in 80 μl Solution C6. A nested PCR protocol for partial amplification of a ∼850 bp fragment of the 18S rRNA gene was set up using KAPA2 G Robust HotStart PCR kit (KAPA Biosystems, Cat no KK5517). The reaction mixture for all reactions consisted of 5 μl KAPA buffer A, 0.25 μl of a 20 mM nucleotide mixture, 1.25 μl of forward and reverse primer (10 μM stock), 0.1 μl of KAPA 2 G polymerase and 2 μl template in a total volume of 25 μl. The reactions were run in a Bio-Rad S1000 Thermal cycler. Primers for the 18S amplification were as described in (Santín et al., 2004) ). Samples containing C. parvum were subtyped through partial amplification (∼800 bp) of the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene using the same PCR mixture as for 18S but with primers described in (Alves et al., 2003) . 18S reaction conditions were 95°C for three minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 61°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s, with a two minutes extension at 72°C after the last cycle. Two μl were used as templates for the second reaction using the same reaction conditions, except that the annealing temperature was raised to 63°C. The gp60 annealing temperature was 52°C in the first PCR and 55°C in the second. Achieved sequences were compared with sequences deposited in GenBank using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST, NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi). Analyses for rotavirus and coronavirus were performed at the diagnostic laboratory at the Swedish National Veterinary Institute. Up to five samples are pooled at the laboratory and then rotavirus is detected by antigen-ELISA and coronavirus by PCR. For each sampling, faecal samples from the experimental group and the control group, respectively, were pooled before analyses. Serum protein was analysed by refractometer.
