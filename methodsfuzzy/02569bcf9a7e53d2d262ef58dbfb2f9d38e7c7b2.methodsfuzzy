Selection and analysis of cDNA clones cDNA clones containing sequences derived from the 3' end of the FIPV genome were selected from a "random" cDNA library of FIPV 79-1146 genomic RNA (de Groot et al., 1987b) by hybridization to sucrose-gradient purified, 32p-labeled FIPV RNA 6 in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5X Denhardt's , 100 #g/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °. Recombinant DNA techniques were performed by standard methods (Maniatis et al., 1982) . Sequence analysis was carried out using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure (Sanger et al., 1977) . Sequence data were assembled and analyzed by using the computer programs by Staden (1986) . Sl nuclease analysis and Northern blot analysis were performed as described (de Groot eta/., 1987a,b) .
