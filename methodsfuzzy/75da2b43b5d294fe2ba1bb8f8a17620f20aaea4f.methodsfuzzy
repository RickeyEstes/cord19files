A successful LAMP reaction with PCV2-specific primers at 64 â€¢ C for 60 min produced many bands of different sizes upon agarose electrophoresis, since the LAMP products consisted of several inverted-repeat structures. The amplification by LAMP showed a ladder-like pattern, whereas the PCR product was a specific DNA band. The result indicated that the detection limit of the PCV2 LAMP was five copies per reaction whereas that of PCR was 25 copies (Fig. 1) . The detection sensitivity of LAMP was therefore fivefold better than for conventional PCR. DNA extracted from tissues of healthy animals, pigs infected with PCV1, PPV and PRV, and cDNA from PRRSV were used as templates for PCV2 LAMP. Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that the PCV2 LAMP reaction did not detect PCV1, PPV, PRV, or PRRSV, and gave a negative reaction with tissues of healthy swine. Only with the PCV2-BJ DNA did the PCV2 primer set give a positive reaction (Fig. 2) .
