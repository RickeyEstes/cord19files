Prophylactic and therapeutic IFN-α gene delivery to the lung A replication-deficient adenoviral gene transfer vector (Ad5) expressing murine IFN-α (AdIFN-α) was obtained from Defyrus (Toronto, Ontario, Canada -construct mDEF201 prepared at the Robert Fitzhenry Vector Laboratory, McMaster University), and an empty adenoviral vector (Addl) was used as a control. Mice anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane were infected i.n. with 10 7 plaque-forming units of AdIFN-α in a volume of 20 µl, 48 hours before (prophylactic) or 12 hours after (therapeutic) S. pneumoniae infection. As we have previously well documented, i.n. Ad5 gene transfer vector delivery leads to transgene expression within the airway epithelium and macrophages and raises transgene protein levels for a period of 12-14 days. 26 Determination of streptococcus burden in local and systemic tissues Levels of streptococcus in the lung and spleen were determined by homogenizing the tissues in PBS, plating serial dilutions on blood-agar plates, and incubating overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 . Colonies were counted and calculated as cfu per whole organ.
