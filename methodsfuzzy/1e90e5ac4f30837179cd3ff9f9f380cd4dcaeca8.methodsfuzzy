Intestines and intestinal contents were obtained from 28-day-old turkey poults from flocks which had experienced outbreaks of acute enteritis in DuBois county, southern Indiana. The specimens were homogenized in 5 volumes of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (pH 8.0) and clarified by centrifugation at 3000g for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered through 0.22 mm membrane filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and inoculated into the amniotic cavity of 22-day-old embryonated turkey eggs. Embryo intestines were harvested on day 3 post-inoculation. Harvested embryo intestines were propagated serially in embryonated turkey eggs for another four passages. Feces or cecal contents from the affected turkey poults or inoculated turkey embryos were clarified as described above. Clarified samples were ultracentrifuged at 100,000g for 2 h at 4 8C. Pellets were resuspended in distilled water and one drop of this suspension was placed on 200-mesh formvar carbon-coated grid. The grid was negatively stained with 2% of phosphotungstic acid, pH 6.5, and examined on an EM. Coronavirus particles were observed from the intestinal contents or feces of affected turkey poults from flocks which had experienced outbreaks of acute enteritis and mortality (Fig. 1) . The viral particles were spherical, enveloped, and surrounded by regularly spaced petal-or pear-shaped projections. A double fringe of peplomers could be seen. They were 50-150 nm in diameter. Inoculation with the virus-containing filtrate from the intestinal homogenate did not kill turkey embryos. The intestinal tract of inoculated turkey embryos was more distended than that of normal turkey embryos. The intestinal contents were watery, gaseous, and greenish. Numerous intact coronaviral virion particles similar to those described previously were found in the intestinal contents from the inoculated embryos by EM. Frozen intestines of affected turkey poults or inoculated turkey embryos were embedded in the embedding medium and frozen sectioned. Acetone-fixed tissue sections were incubated with turkey anti-TCV antiserum in a humidifying chamber at room temperature for 20 min. The turkey antiserum specific to the prototype TCV Minnesota isolate was obtained from Dr. Saif (The Ohio State University, Wooster, OH). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution three times, intestinal sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated goat anti-turkey IgG ðH þ LÞ (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) in a humidifying chamber at room temperature for 30 min. Slides with intestinal sections were rinsed, air dried, and mounted. The slides were examined using an UV light microscope (Patel et al., 1975) . The intestines of affected turkey poults and inoculated turkey embryos were positive for TCV using turkey anti-TCV antiserum in IFA. The infected epithelial cells had intense bright immunofluorescent staining. For purification of virus, intestines of affected turkey poults or inoculated turkey embryos were homogenized with 5 volumes of TBS by mortar and pestle. After freeze and thaw for three times and sonication, the homogenate was centrifuged at 8000g for 20 min. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000g for 3 h through a cushion of 15 ml of 30% sucrose solution. After resuspension of the pellet in TBS, the sample was layered on the top of 40-65% sucrose gradient and ultracentrifuged overnight at 100,000g. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tubes and both absorbance and sucrose density of each fraction were determined. Two absorbance peaks corresponding to densities of 1.18-1.20 and 1.14-1.15 g/ml, respectively, were obtained from the sucrose density gradient purification. Both peaks contained intact coronaviral particles with characterized petal-or pear-shaped surface projections revealed by EM. The size of viral particles varied. The peak corresponding to densities of 1.18-1.20 g/ml contained more intact coronaviral particles than that of 1.14-1.15 g/ml. The purified virus hemagglutinated rabbit erythrocytes with a titer of 16. Fractions of both peaks had infectivity to 22-day-old turkey embryos via amniotic cavity route of inoculation as evidenced by IFA and EM examination of intestines and intestinal contents from inoculated turkey embryos (data not shown). The viruses purified by sucrose gradient were solubilized in sample buffer (containing 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromophenol blue, and 1% 2mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out using the discontinuous buffer system (Laemmli, 1970) . Polypeptide bands were revealed by staining the gel with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Protein contents of the sucrose gradient purified viral preparation are shown in Fig. 2 . Lanes 2, 3, 4, and 5 were loaded with different amounts, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mg, respectively, of the sucrose gradient purified viral preparation. Numerous protein bands Fig. 2 . SDS-PAGE analysis of turkey coronaviruses purified by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Purified coronaviral preparations were electrophoresed in 10% gel under reducing conditions. Lanes 1 and 6, molecular weight markers; lanes 2-5, corresponding to 10, 20, 50, and 100 mg of purified viral proteins. The major protein bands of 200, 100-110, 50-60, and 30-35 kDa were noted. were seen when the loaded amount was more than 50 mg. The major protein bands could be grouped into 200, 100-110, 50-60, and 30-35 kDa. Only these major protein bands were detectable in lane 3 where 20 mg of purified virus was loaded. When 10 mg of purified virus was loaded in lane 2, only two bands with molecular weight of 200 and 50 kDa were detectable. Total RNA was extracted from intestines of inoculated turkey embryos or sucrose density gradient purified viral preparations using acid guanidinium thiocyanatephenol-chloroform extraction (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987) . Oligonucleotide primers for RT and PCR reactions were designed from the S1 region of spike (S) gene sequence of bovine coronavirus (BCV) (Rekik and Dea, 1994) . The primers for first PCR reaction were S5 (5 0 TAATTTACCTGCTGCTAATG3 0 ) corresponding to nucleotides from 1295 to 1314 Fig. 3 . Alignment of the nucleotide sequences of the 568-nucleotide PCR product from TCV with the corresponding S gene sequences of HCV-OC43 (Kuenkel and Herrler, 1996 ; accession number Z32768) and BCV-L9 (Zhang et al., 1991; accession number M64667) . Nucleotides identical to the consensus sequence are shown as dots. There is a single nucleotide substitution from G to A at the position of 482 in the TCV genome. of BCV S gene and S4 (5 0 TAGTCTTTTTGTAGAGTAATCCA C3 0 ) corresponding to antisense of nucleotides from 2274 to 2297 of BCV S gene. The primers for nested-PCR reaction were S3 (5 0 ATGTGTGTAGGTAATGGTCCTGG3 0 ) corresponding to nucleotides from 1488 to 1507 of BCV S gene and S6 (5 0 AGCAACTACGAATCATAAAA3 0 ) corresponding to antisense of the nucleotides from 2036 to 2055 of BCV S gene. Reverse transcription was operated using primer S4 with Superscript RT kit (Gibco-BRL) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The complementary DNA (cDNA) product as prepared above was used as the template for PCR amplification. For the first PCR reaction, 5 ml of the cDNA was added to 45 ml of PCR reaction mixture containing 1 mM MgCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mg/ml gelatin, 10 mM (each) dNTPs (Promega, Madison, WI), 1 mg primer S4, 1 mg primer S5, and 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). The reaction mixture was amplified in a Perkin Elmer thermal cycler (Model 480, Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT) with an initial denaturation at 94 8C for 2 min and 35 cycles of denaturation (95 8C for 1 min), annealing (55 8C for 1 min), and extension (72 8C for 1 min). Nested PCR was carried out using primers S3 and S6 under identical conditions. The PCR product was recovered from the agarose gel, cloned into a pBK-CMV cloning vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and transformed into E. coli DH5a (Gibco BRL) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Plasmids containing the PCR inserts were sequenced using the dsDNA cycle sequencing kit (Gibco BRL) according to the manufacturer's instruction. A nested-PCR product of 568 bp nucleotide fragment was obtained. The 568-nucleotide sequence analyzed by the computer program Megalign (DNASTAR, Madison, WI) for matching sequences with BCV-L9 (Zhang et al., 1991; accession number M64667) or human coronavirus (HCV-OC43) (Kuenkel and Herrler, 1996 ; accession number Z32768) revealed high degree of nucleotide sequence homology among them. Pairwise comparisons of the nucleotide sequence to the corresponding S gene sequences of BCV or HCV-OC43 demonstrated 99% of similarity. There was a single nucleotide substitution from G to A at the position of 482 in the TCV sequence (Fig. 3) .
