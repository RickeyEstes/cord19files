Feline coronavirus (FCoV; family Coronaviridae, genus Alphacoronavirus) is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. FCoV exists as two different biotypes: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) [1] . The former causes mild enteritis (usually subclinical infection), and the latter causes the highly lethal systemic disease FIP. Although antiviral drugs and vaccines against FIP have been investigated, no method has been established for practical use [2] . Furthermore, FCoV also exists as two serotypes: type I FCoV (type I FECV and type I FIPV) and type II FCoV (type II FECV and type II FIPV) [3] . Serological and genetic surveys showed that type I FCoV is dominant worldwide [4] [5] [6] . We previously reported that type I FCoV is closely associated with cholesterol throughout the viral life cycle [7] . We also demonstrated that U18666A, the cholesterol transport inhibitor, strongly inhibits type I FCoV infection [8] . Based on these findings, U18666A may be applied as a therapeutic drug for FIP. However, to our knowledge, U18666A is not approved for veterinary practical use. To use U18666A to treat FIP, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies must be performed for cats. As with U18666A, several candidate antiviral drugs targeting type I FCoV have been identified [9, 10] . However, none of drugs scientifically demonstrated to exhibit a therapeutic effect on FIP are practically used. To solve these problems, it is desirable to identify a potent antiviral agent for FCoV infection among drugs generally used for cats. Itraconazole (ICZ) is classified as an azole antifungal [11] . It has low toxicity and can be used to treat fungal infections in immunocompromised patients [12] . It is commonly used by veterinarians to treat fungal infections in dogs and cats. Recently, ICZ was suggested to be effective for enteroviral infection (poliovirus, rhinovirus, and coxsackievirus) [13] . We previously investigated the antiviral effects of cholesterol transport inhibitors, including U18666A, and confirmed that ICZ inhibits type I FCoV infection [8] . However, the influence of ICZ on FCoV infection has not been investigated in detail. In this study, we examined the antiviral effects of ICZ on FCoV. Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf )-4 cells sensitive to type I FIPV, type II FIPV, and type II FECV were used. ICZ (ITORIZOLE ® ) was purchased from Janssen Pharmaceutical K.K. (Tokyo, Japan). For the solvent of ICZ, 40% (w/v) hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical, Japan) containing 2.5% (v/v) propylene glycol and 0.376% (v/v) hydrochloric acid was used. ICZ was adjusted to 10 mM with the solvent, aliquoted, and stored at −30 °C until use. Maintenance medium (MEM) was used to dilute ICZ. To evaluate the cytotoxic effects of ICZ and solvent in fcwf-4 cells, cell viability was measured by the WST-8 assay as a described before [7] . The
