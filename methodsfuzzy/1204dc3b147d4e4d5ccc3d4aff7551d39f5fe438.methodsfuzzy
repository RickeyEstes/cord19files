In this retrospective study, the files of 54 patients admitted to Masih Daneshvari Hospital (a referral hospital for respiratory tract infection and diseases), from November 1 to December 30 2009, who had the criteria for H1N1 infection determined by US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention were reviewed. Most patients were referred from Northeast Tehran and the inclusion criteria were a body temperature above 37.8 â„ƒ (100 F), cough or sore throat and a real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for H1N1 infection. These patients were treated with oral antibiotics and oseltamivir. Thirty-one of the patients enrolled into the study had an available chest-X ray and ten patients with more severe symptoms had an available CT scan. The patients' files were also reviewed regarding their previous medical condition and the laboratory findings including creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hemoglobin (HB), leukocyte count and platelet count were recorded. Our institutional review board approved the study and the informed consent was waived as the study was retrospective and observational.
