Synthetic and naturally occurring cationic polymers represent a large group of carriers for nucleic acids. Although initially developed for the purpose of gene delivery, numerous reports have affirmed their utility in oligonucleotide delivery. These linear or branched polymers range from the first discovered poly-L-lysine (PLL), to the most frequently used polyethyleneimine (PEI). 112, 113 They share the properties of condensing oligonucleotides into small particles (polyplexes) that facilitate cellular uptake via endocytosis. However, their delivery efficiencies and toxicities vary significantly. PEI has been produced in particular in an assortment of structural variants. 114 A major drawback with use of PEI and many other cationic polymers is their non-biodegradable nature, which raises toxicity concerns. 115 Furthermore, their efficiencies have been poor in vivo in many cases, due to unwanted interactions with serum components. 115, 116 Polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers of different sizes have been included in PEI polymers in order to prolong the circulation time in blood (reviewed in ref. 117 ). Although such PEGylation significantly stabilizes polyplexes, it unfortunately often results in lower potency, due to inadequate cellular uptake and poor endosomal escape. 117, 118 Another strategy for stabilization of polyplexes involves use of hydrophobic modifications. For example, partial modifications of amines in PEI with tyrosine stabilize polyplexes significantly increases transfection of both siRNAs and splice-redirecting 2′-OMe oligonucleotides. 119, 120 Analogously, modification of polyamines with hydrophobic acrylates results in stabilization of cores for highly efficient siRNA and 2′-OMe anti-miR delivery in vivo. 121, 122 Peptide modifications of cationic polymers have been used successfully to either improve tissue targeting or overall delivery efficacy and to decrease the required dose. Pioneering work from the laboratory of Ernst Wagner showed that PEI-mediated gene transfer can be improved dramatically by incorporation of receptor-targeting peptide ligands (reviewed in ref. 117, 123, 124) . Many other groups have capitalized on this peptide/cationic polymer strategy to improve gene delivery profoundly. 125, 126 Surprisingly, examples of use of targeting peptides and CPPs to enhance polyplex delivery of oligonucleotides have been sparse. In one study. Tat peptide was conjugated to PEGylated PEI which, when complexed with 2′-OMe oligomers and injected intramuscularly into mdx mice, improved exon skipping of dystrophin pre-mRNA. 127 Several successful studies on siRNA delivery have been reported. Schiffelers et al. utilized the integrin-binding peptide RGD attached to PEGylated PEI for delivery of siRNA targeting VEGF-R in tumor-bearing mice. 128 Similarly, Wang et al. conjugated a bombesin peptide via a PEG spacer to a free thiol group in an amphiphilic polymer N-(1-aminoethyl)iminobis[N-(oleicyl-cysteinylhistidinyl-1-aminoethyl)propionamide] (EHCO) to target bombesin receptors overexpressed on various cancer cells. 129 The siRNA/ functionalized polymer complex was shown to efficiently promote RNA interference responses in cells and systemic administration of anti-HIF-1α siRNA with bombesin-containing EHCO displayed significant advantage over nontargeted polymer in inducing target reduction in a xenograft model of human glioma. PEGylated transferrin peptide combined with oligoethyleneimine was able to deliver siRNA highly efficiently into neuroblastomabearing mice. 130 Further, an elegant demonstration of receptor-specific uptake of defined folate-PEG-siRNA conjugates together with a structurally defined polycation was shown in use of such complexes for specific gene silencing. 131 Instead of targeting peptides, the Wagner group has obtained improved endosomal escape by inclusion of fusogenic peptides. In the initial study, PEGylated polylysine/PEI was covalently linked to the endosomolytic peptide, melittin. Since melittin possesses lytic properties at both neutral and low pH, amines within the peptide were masked by reaction with dimethylmaleic anhydride (DMMA). Dimethylmaleic groups are removed at low pH within endosomes, thus exposing the lytic peptide. Polycation-PEG-DMMA-melittin conjugates were mixed with siRNAs to form polyplexes that efficiently induced an RNA interferene response in cell culture. 132 In a further study with the same components, a cysteine residue was incorporated into the PLL to allow disulfide formation with an siRNA containing a 5′-thiolated sense strand. Such conjugates were almost as efficient as polyplexes and displayed reduced cytotoxicity. 133 Another important example of peptide/polymer combinations is a cyclodextrin containing polymer (CDP)-based system, which so far is the only platform reported for RNA interference delivery in humans. 134 CDP is a short polycation that assembles with nucleic acids (e.g., siRNA) via electrostatic interactions. In order to facilitate endosomal escape, imidazole groups were incorporated on the ends of the polymer to act as proton sponges. For systemic delivery, the polymer was stabilized by inclusion of surface-functionalized PEG moieties. In contrast to other polymeric delivery systems, the CDP approach relies on noncovalent incorporation of PEG via conjugation to adamantane, a small molecule that forms a high affinity inclusion complex with cyclodextrin. Finally, in order to confer tissue targeting to solid tumors, the surface of CDP was coated with adamantane conjugated to the transferrin ligand for targeting of transferrin receptors that are expressed abundantly on the surface of tumors. 135
