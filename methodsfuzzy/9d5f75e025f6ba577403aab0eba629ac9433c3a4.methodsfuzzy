Cells and cell culture. The rat astrocytoma C6 cells were obtained from Dr. A. Marks (Banting and Best Institute, Toronto), the rat hepatoma HTC cells from Dr. K. Yamamoto (University of California, San Francisco), and the rat myoblast L6 cell line from Dr. D. B. Sanwal (University of Western Ontario, London). Dr. S. E. Pfeiffer (University of Connecticut, Farmington) kindly supplied the murine glioblastoma cell lines, G26-20 and G26-24. The murine neuroblastoma Cl300 cells were obtained in 1971 from Dr. J. P. Broome (New York University Medical School) and the African green monkey kidney Vero cells from Dr. L. Hatch (St. Joseph's Hospital, London). The sources of the rat Schwannoma RN2-2 cell line and the murine fibroblast L-2 line were previously described (Lucas et al., 1977) . Prior to use, the cells were cloned by limit dilution in 96-well Microtest II trays (Falcon Plastics), and a representative clone of each cell line was used in this particular study. The cells were routinely propagated as monolayers in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Microbiological Associates), sodium bicarbonate (2 g/liter), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) at 37" in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% COz. Viruses. The source and routine propagation of the MHVs and JHM strains of mouse hepatitis virus have been previously described (Lucas et al., 1977) . The Hall4 strain of SSPE and the Edmonston strain of measles virus were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection at passage levels of HeLa/2-Vera/S and HK/24-HAM 141, respectively. Both viruses were routinely maintained by passage on Vero cell monolayers. Diluted virus was allowed to adsorb at a multiplicity of infection (m.0.i.) of 0.01 at 32.5 or 37" for 1 hr before medium was added. Plaque assay. MHVa and JHM virus production was determined by a plaque assay on L-2 cell monolayers as previously described (Lucas et al., 1977) . Measles virus production was ascertained using a similar plaque assay on Vero cell monolayers. For plaque assays after overlaying with MEM containing 5% FBS and 0.5% methyl cellulose, 4000 cps, the infected monolayers were incubated at 32.5" for 4 days in the case of Halle virus and 5 days when assaying the Edmonston strain, then were fixed and stained. The titer is expressed as plaqueforming units per milliliter (PFU/ml). Infectious center assay. To determine the fraction of cells able to release PFU during the state of persistence, the monolayers were washed, and the cells were released from them by trypsinization and then plated at serial dilutions on either L-2 monolayers in the case of JHM and MHVs infections or on Vero monolayers when Hall& and Edmonston infections were involved. After 3 to 5 hr attachment period at 32.5", the plates were overlaid with the methyl cellulose-MEM mixture and incubated until plaques developed as above. Infection of cell lines. Various cell lines grown into monolayers were inoculated at a m.o.i. of 0.01 at 32.5 or 39.5' with one of MHV3, JHM, Hall& or Edmonston viruses. Following adsorption for 1 hr, unadsorbed virus was removed, and the cultures were overlaid with nutrient medium. The infected monolayers were examined for development of virus-induced cytopathology and monitored daily for production of free plaque-forming units per milliliter necessitating the complete replacement of the medium each day. Determination of cerebroside sulfate. Confluent monolayers of the various cell lines were incubated for 48 hr at 37" in MEM supplemented with 2.5% FBS and containing 40 pCi/ml of [35S]sulfate (43 Ci/mg; New England Nuclear). Cells were harvested by scraping and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Aliquots were kept for protein determination by the method of Lowry et al. (1951) using bovine serum albumin as standard, but the bulk of material was extracted with chloroformmethanol according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (1959) . The lower phase lipids were subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis (Kates, 1972) and chromatographed in chloroform:methanol:water (65:25:4, v/v/v), on silica gel H thin-layer plates using cerebroside sulfate as a standard. After preparative isolation of the cerebroside sulfate band and elution with chloroform:methanol:water (95:95:10, v/v/v), the counts per minute of [35S]sulfate incorporated were determined by liquid scintillation counting in a Beckman LS-350 instrument.
