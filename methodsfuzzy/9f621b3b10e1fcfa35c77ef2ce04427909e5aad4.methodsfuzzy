Aeromonas bacteremia between January 2006 and December 2015 at a 2,000-bed tertiary care center in Seoul, Korea, were retrospectively reviewed. The analysis was performed to identify factors associated with 28-day mortality. Results: A total of 138 patients with Aeromonas bacteremia were enrolled for this study. Most common pathogen was A. hydrophila (n = 58, 42%), followed by A. caviae (n = 50, 36.2%) and A. veronii biovar sorbia (n = 19, 13.8%). 93 (67.4%) patients were male and the median age was 64.5 years. The most common source of Aeromonas bacteremia was biliary tract in 74 (53.6%), followed by peritoneum in 10 (7.2%), skin and soft tissue in 5 (3.6%), and liver abscess in 4 (2.9). Primary bacteremia with unknown origin was in 39 (28.3%). The overall all-cause 28-day mortality rate was 29%. On univariate analysis, skin and soft tissue infection (P = 0.025), peritonitis (P = 0.035), healthcare-associated infection (P = 0.029), Charlson comorbidity score (P < 0.001) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (P < 0.001) were significantly related to the mortality. Results: A total of 140 patients with PM were enrolled. The most common underlying disease was diabetes mellitus (47 cases, 33.6%) and the most common predisposing condition was trauma (21 cases, 15.0%). A total of 111 organisms were isolated from 99 (70.7%) patients, and polymicrobial infections were found in 15.2% (15 of 99). Staphylococci (43 cases) were the most common pathogen, followed by streptococci (23 cases). Enteric gramnegative organisms were identified in 32 patients. Methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was identified from 2.9% (4 of 140) patients (community-acquired cases, 2.0% [2 of 102] vs. health-care-associated cases, 5.3% [2 of 38] ; P = 0.30). The inhospital mortality rate was 8.6%. Old age, intensive care unit admission, and septic shock were significantly associated with inhospital mortality. Conclusions: Underlying conditions and severity were associated with in-hospital mortality. MRSA seems to be an uncommon causative organism of PM in Korea. were enrolled, and clinical symptoms were confirmed. The gene for 56-kDa type-specific antigen (TSA56) was amplified by nested PCR, and the nucleotide sequences of the PCR products were determined. The nucleotide sequences of the TSA56 obtained from scrub typhus patients and retrieved from the GenBank database were analyzed phylogenetically. Results: In PCR results, 247 PCR-positive samples were obtained and 218 samples (88.3%) showed Boryong genotype by DNA sequence analyses. Thirteen samples (5.3%) showed Taguchi genotype; other Korean types such as Je-cheon (5), Yeo-joo (1) and Pa-joo related strain (1) were also identified. Japanese types such as Karp (4), Kawasaki (2), Ikeda (2) and Nishino (1) were also found. The most cases were found in the group of age 70-79 (29.6%). Conclusion: In our results, the most prevalent type of O. tsutsugamushi was Boryong in Korea, 2016; however, unusual type originated from Korean and Japanese strains were also found. Consecutive and broad-ranged national survey for prevalence is needed for the control and prevention of scrub typhus in other endemic region of Korea. Background: Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a common pathogen in pediatric patients and often causes acute pharyngotonsilitis and skin and soft tissue infection. In addition, bacteremia can also occur. Method: This is a single-center, retrospective study. From January 2000 to December 2016, pediatric patients ≤18 years old with GAS bacteremia were studied. Results: Among 249 patients with positive GAS culture results, 19 patients had GAS bacteremia. Eleven (58%) patients were male and median age was 7.4 years (range 0.3-17.4 years). Fourteen (74%) patients had chronic underlying diseases. Five (26%) were immunocompromised patients. Eight (42%) patients had lymphatic or vascular malformation and seven of them had inflammatory signs of the lesion. Three (16%) patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia and presented with only fever without sore throat or other signs of skin and soft tissue infection. Two (10%) patients had underlying chronic kidney disease. Three (16%) patients developed pneumonia and two of them received ventilator care; two patients were previously healthy children and one patient had chronic bedridden condition with microcephaly on home-ventilator care. The 30-day mortality was 6% (1/19). All GAS isolates were sensitive to penicillin. Fifteen were sensitive to both erythromycin and clindamycin (79%). Conclusion: This study showed various clinical presentations of invasive GAS infections. Although uncommon, GAS should be considered as a potential pathogen that can cause bacteremia and serious clinical course. Background: Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) greatly affects the health and production of pigs and causes significant economic losses in the swine farms. The diseases are commonly associated with bacterial pathogens, and identification of the bacterial pathogens is getting a topic of great interest. In this study, PCR and culture methods were compared to detect five bacterial pathogens mostly associated with PRDC worldwide [Pasteurella multocida (PM), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (MH), Streptococcus suis (SS), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), and Haemophilus parasuis (HP)] in lung tissue with pathological lesion. In case of culture method, Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) was used to identify the bacterial species following colony isolation by bacterial culture. Methods: A total of 271 lung samples with pathologic lesion were obtained in two slaughterhouses from December 2015 to July 2016. The tissue was homogenized in 15 mL PBS using a stomacher and genomic DNA was extracted from 1 mL of the homogenized solution after spin down. PCRs were performed with each specific set of primers for a target pathogens using the extracted DNA samples. The homogenized samples were also used to isolate bacteria by streaking onto 10% sheep blood agars followed by overnight culture at 37°C. Each suspected colony of PM, MH, SS, APP, and HP was subjected to MALDI-TOF assay to identify the bacterial species. Results: Of 271 tissues samples processed, PCR detected all the five pathogens with the highest detection rate of MH (n = 141, 52%) followed by SS (14, 5.1%), HP (5, 1.8%), APP (5, 1.8%), and PM (4, 1.4%), respectively. In contrast, culture method detected only SS (29, 10.7%), PM (29, 10.7%), and APP (1, 0.3%). None of the samples were positive for MH and HP by culture method. All the culture positive samples for the pathogens were negative by PCR except 4 samples of SS positive. When combined the results of PCR and culture methods, the overall prevalence of PRDC associated bacterial pathogens in pathological lung tissues was highest for MH (141, 52%) followed by PM (33, 12.2%), SS (29, 10.7%), APP (6, 2.2%), and HP (5, 1.8%), respectively. Conclusions: PRDC is polymicrobial disease caused by infection of various combinations of primary and secondary bacterial pathogens. It is important to investigate the relevant significance of bacterial pathogens in PRDC to control the disease. MH was the most prevalent bacterial pathogen in this study, indicating MH is the most significant bacterial pathogen of PRDC in Korea. PM and SS were the second and third prevalent bacterial pathogens, but APP and HP were rarely associated with PRDC. The two detection methods used in the current study showed clearly different sensitivities to each pathogen. MH and HP were detected only by PCR but most PM and SS were identified by culture method followed by MALDI-TOF assay. Moreover, PCR and culture methods detected each different portion of positive samples, respectively, in this study. Therefore, use of combinational method of PCR and culture might be useful to increase the sensitivity for the detection of PRDC associated bacterial pathogens. The obligate intracellular bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). This bacterium is a tick-borne pathogen mainly transmitted by Ixodes ticks that infect domestic mammals and humans. Molecular characterization of the MSP2/P44 protein of A. phagocytophilum may determine not only if the bacterium is capable of invading hosts but also whether it generates antigenic variation for the purpose of escaping the host immune response, resulting in various pathologic injuries and serious clinical outcomes. In Korea, HGA patients usually present acute fever, muscle pain and headache. In this study, we confirmed seropositivity and/or seroconversion against A. phagocytophilum infection using indirect immuno-fluorescent antibody assay (IFA) from 4 patients with acute fever. We also amplified, cloned and sequenced the part of A. phagocytophilum msp2/p44 genes detected from the HGA patients and then compared them with the msp2/p44 sequences available in GenBank. The comparative data showed that the 4 msp2/p44 sequences obtained from Korean patients had a high similarity (99.17∼97.92%) with one another whereas were significantly different with sequences detected from humans in USA (NC007797, DQ519522 and JQ599137) and China (KC128828 and KC430393) . This result provides a clue to understand the distinct genetic characterization of A. phagocytophilum originated from Korean patients, which might be relevant to clinical outcomes might have suggest helpful information on them. Further study is needed to understand a mechanism on escaping the host immune response through molecular characterization of the MSP2/P44 protein. Results: Pathogens were identified in 22 (56%) of the 39 blood, liver aspirate, and/or vitreous humor samples. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent organism (12/39, 33%). Candida was next common (8.3%, 3/39). The most common combined infection was liver abscess (16/39, 41%). And, renal abscess or acute pyelonephritis was in 30.8% (12/39). Two died due to this fulminant infection. Final ocular outcomes were 35.9% (14/39) in NLP, 15.4% (6/39) LP, 15.4% (6/39) HM, 7.7% (3/39) FC, and 25.6% (10/39). K. pneumoniae is a poor prognosis factor for ocular outcome (NLP and LP vs. HM, CF, and 20/200 or better) in the univariate analysis ( p = 0.02). Other factors did not reach to the statistical difference. Tree decision analysis also revealed K. pneumoniae as a node to divide outcome ( p = 0.017). Conclusions: K. pneumoniae is the most frequent pathogen of EE and additionally, seems a poor prognostic factor of ocular outcome. Considering the rapid progression and poor prognosis of EE, early diagnosis and immediate management are vital, especially if K. pneumoniae is identified or suspected.
