proposed for searching f o r determinants. Jemmerson and Paterson (1986b) presented a method for mapping epitopes on a protein antigen by partial proteolysis of the antigen-antibody complexes, in which chromatography played an important role. An antibody bound t o a protein antigen showed a s t e r i c hindrance effect and decreased the rate of proteolytic cleavage of the antigen in regions involved i n the antibody-antigen contact. RP-HPLC of the partial digest has made i t possible to identify the contact area according to the relative amount (peak heights) and composition of the isolated peptides of the antigen, provided that the primary structure of the antigen was known and that a protease digest of the single antibody and the single antigen were chromatographed in preliminary experiments in order to localize their peptide peaks in the chromatogram. Cytochrome c and monoclonal antibody against i t were used in these experiments. A 30-min tryptic digestion was found t o be optimal. For HPLC a 250 mm x 4.6 mm I.D. column of C I 8 Spherisorb ODs-1 (Custom LC, Houston, TX, U.S. A.) was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 t o 70% acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) during 90 min a t a flow-rate of 1 ml/min. UV detection a t 214 nm was applied. Collected peaks of the antigen were hydrolysed and analysed i n an amino acid analyser. The applicability of t h i s method was discussed in detail. Another, b u t very expensive and time-consuming, experimental method f o r determining the contact area between the antibody and antigen i s X-ray crystallography of the antibody-antigen complex (Amit e t al., 1985) , from which the epitopes could be derived. This method i s very precise b u t i t cannot be generally used. The theoretically proposed or practically found antigen determinants are the starting p o i n t f o r the peptide synthesis (Shinnick e t a l . , 1983; Walter, 1986) . However, so f a r the purified peptides corresponding t o protective epitopes often possess poor immunogenicity, " a t l e a s t partly because of the removal of components carrying adjuvant activity of the original vaccines (Kotani e t a l . , 1986) ; hence the development of new types of vaccines requires studies of chemically well defined i mmunoadj uvants , which ef f ec t i vel y potentiate the immunogenic i ty of protective epitopes". Also, the effect of additivity or synergism caused by a large number of determinants on the same natural macromolecular antigen contributes t o the stronger antigenicity of natural antigens i n comparison with single synthetic pepti des. The chromatography of synthetically prepared peptides f o r vaccination does not d i f f e r from the separation techniques for any other simple peptides, which were described in detail in Chapter 11, and therefore in the following part of this section only a few examples of synthetic vaccines will be presented. 12.3.4.2 Examples There a r e two surface g l y c o p r o t e i n s i n i n f l u e n z a v i r u s , haemagglutinin and neuramidinase.

The TyrI6' peptide was linked with human serum albumin using bis-diazotized benzidine. In preliminary experiments, the peptide showed good reactivity with an antiserum directed toward the complete virus, b u t immunization with the albumin-conjugate (peptide t o protein ratio = 8: 1 ) gave no virus neutralizing anti bodies. Krchfidk and Ma19 (1986) used modern technology t o prepare and t e s t synthetic antigen fragments i n which the isolation of the real intact-protein antigen was not necessary. The principle of t h i s approach can be illustrated by the following steps: ( 1 ) determination of the DNA sequence expressing the antigen; (2) selection of the corresponding protein fragment(s1 based on theoretical translation; Ddlling e t a l . (1986) described the synthesis of peptide sequences belonging column was used ( c f . , Fig. 12 .61, eluted with a gradient of Z%/min of B (Boyle e t al., 1983; Klempnauer e t al., 1983; MalJ and KrchRdk, 1984) .

Because the FA derivatives are acids or 01 igoacids, IEC on microparticulate bonded phases was used for their rapid separation f i r s t (Reed and Archer, 1976 ; Stout e t a l . , 1976). Naturally, the retention of PtGlun in anion-exchange chromatography depends on the number of carboxyl groups, being highest with species containing most Glu residues. Bush e t a l . (1979) studied the retention behaviour of PtGlu, in RPC on an ODS-silica column and found t h i s method t o be very suitable f o r good resolution and rapid analysis. When the carboxylic groups are largely undissociated ( a t pH 2 ) , the retention of PtGlun increases with the number of Glu residues and the elution order parallels that in IEC. A t sufficiently high pH (e.g., a t pH 4.5) the carboxilic groups are dissociated and the elution order i s reversed (cf., Fig. 12.7) . The logarithm of the capacity factor i s linearly dependent (with the exception o f FA) on the number o f Glu residues over a wide range of eluent pH ( c f . , Fig. 4 in the original paper). As can be seen from Fig. 12 .8, a t pH 6 ( a t which the carboxyl groups are almost completely dissociated) the retention decreases with increasing number of Glu residues, so t h a t both methods (IEC and RPC) complement each other. In general, the efficiency of IEC with bonded phases appears t o be higher than that o f RPC a t low pH on ODS with the same particle size and column dimensions.
