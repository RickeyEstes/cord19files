BAC sequencing and assembly BAC clones from RPCI86 domestic cat BAC library [21] were selected based on FLA BAC map previously described [21] . Shotgun libraries were made using the sonication method [18] . Sequencing reactions were made from both ends of the plasmid vector using BigDye v1.0 chemistry (ABI). Electrogram files (ab1 files) were ftptransferred to an ABCC ncisgi high speed computer, analyzed by Phred base caller, assembled by Phrap assembler and finished sequence assembly by Consed13 autofinish programs [22] [23] [24] [25] . The final assembly of these BAC sequence contigs were made using Crossmatch program (http://www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed. html). The following BAC clones were analyzed for class III and proximal, central class I FLA regions in fcaB2qcen; 181p11, 116b21, 539f24, 162h14, 207i7, 20f19, 18a04, 141b1, 97q9, 410h15, 261j7, 469m20, 515g14, 167d5, 117c16, 27j10, 194g24, 253j16, 292m22, 455a7, 454a5, 148o13, 117e16, 329i22. The following BAC clones were analyzed for class I distal region in fcaB2pter with the order from a telomere of fcaB2 short arm, 46j10, 596j24, 269n17, 221p5. More than sequence quality value 20 was used for the final assembly. The first assembly from class III through central class I regions was connected with previously published [18] class II region sequence (758 Kbp) using Crossmatch program.
