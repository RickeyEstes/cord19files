We included patients who were consecutively admitted to the Hospital of Mataró with AE-COPD between April 1, 2005 and March 31, 2007. COPD was defined according to the global initiative for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (GOLD) criteria, 17 with patients exhibiting compatible spirometry measurements and a smoking history of at least ten packs/year. A diagnosis of acute exacerbation (AE) was assumed when a minimum of two Anthonisen criteria 18 were present. Any patient with COPD decompensation that was caused by a noninfectious disease was excluded from the study, assuming that the selected patients presented with an upper or lower respiratory tract infection. Identification was made based on the respiratory infection and dyspnea admission diagnoses from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) 19,20 (491, 492, 493, 496, 518.81, 464, 465, 466, 519.11, 786 .0), excluding the patients who had a known cause of respiratory failure that was different from infectious exacerbation (heart failure, pulmonary thromboembolism, pneumonia). Finally, the patients who met the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (severe immunosuppression, the need for mechanical ventilation or admittance to the Intensive Care Unit, arrival from a nursing home, or a terminal stage of the disease) were asked for their informed consent. The study was approved by the Consorci Sanitari del Maresme Ethics Committee of the Hospital of Mataró.
