Between March and September 2014, samples, including various specimen types, were submitted to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (UMVDL) to determine the etiological agent of disease. Samples are assigned a case identification (ID), which encompasses several samples and specimens obtained from the same farm, and the submission may contain demographic information. The samples were processed, extracted, and tested for PDCoV per the clients' request, using previously described methodology (Marthaler et al., 2013b (Marthaler et al., , 2014a . The results were analyzed by sample and case ID. One positive sample corresponded to a positive case ID. If a case ID contained more than one age group, the different ages within the same case ID were considered different epidemiological unit of interest. Samples were further categorized by age consisting of suckling pigs (<21 days), nursery pigs (21-42 days), growing pigs (43-56 days), finishing pigs (57-147 days) and mature pigs (>147 days). In addition, samples were categorized into 8 groups: environmental, feces, feedback, intestinal homogenate, oral fluid, rectal swab, semen, and miscellaneous, which included bacterial isolates, dried bovine plasma, feed, fluid, FTA card, plasma, RNA, serum, viral isolates, and vomitus. Descriptive statistics of positive samples and case IDs were summarized as percentages. A relationship between veterinarian and swine company were visualized in terms of social networking using the computer package software UCINET 6.5, and the network was visualized with package software Netdraw Borgatti, 2002) . The distribution of specimens was summarized as percentages and visualized with R packages; maps (Becker et al., 2014) , maptools (Bivand and Lewin-Koh, 2014) , RCol-orBrewer (Neuwirth, 2014) , and classInt (Bivand, 2013) . The independent variables, age with 5 categories and specimen with 8 categories, were first analyzed using univariate analysis of grouped data with binary dependent outcome of positive status of PDCoV (positive or negative) (Agresti, 2013) . In multivariable analyses of grouped data, environment and miscellaneous samples were excluded from the analysis since they are not associated with an age of pigs. Independent variables, age with 5 categories and specimen with 6 categories, were modeled using binary dependent outcome of positive PDCoV. Then, the covariate, state, was introduced into the previous model. The suckling pigs (<21 days) and fecal samples were the predefined-baseline reference. At first preliminary analysis, a warning signal of Quasi-separation was reported. Therefore, Firth's Penalized likelihood logistic regression models were employed to reduce the bias in maximum likelihood estimator for both univariate and multivariable logistic model (Firth, 1993; Heinze et al., 2013; Agresti, 2013) . Comparing model and model selection was based on Penalized likelihood and Akaike information criterion (AIC), and lower values indicate a better fit of the analysis to the results. Finally, relative odds (OR) of PDCoV detection were estimated. The total of submission and number of positive counts was aggregated monthly from March to September 2014. Percentage of positive samples was summarized, assuming that number of positive samples each month was identically-independent distributed with binomial distribution with probability p; n âˆ¼ bin(p,N); where n is number of positive samples each month, N is total number of samples summited each month, and p is probability of being positive (prevalence). The number of positive PDCoV samples for each month was estimated using smoothing function. Since the observed number of positive samples in the last three months was near zero and the expected number cannot be lower than zero, a Quasibinomial likelihood method was used to estimate mean-variance relationship and its confidence interval (Agresti, 2013) . Graphics were produced with the R package ggplot2 (Hadley, 2009 ). Computational analysis was performed in (R version 3.2) with different packages as aforementioned (R, 2015) . Statistical differences were considered significant when the p-value was lower than 0.05. Positive PDCoV samples with Ct values <30 (n = 19, GenBank numbers KR265847-KR265865) were selected for sequencing using the Illumina Miseq (Marthaler et al., 2013a (Marthaler et al., , 2014b . PDCoV sequences from GenBank (n = 23) and the sequences from this study were aligned using MAFFT and the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were used to infer a time scale phylogeny (Drummond and Strimmer, 2001; Drummond et al., 2002 Drummond et al., , 2005 Drummond et al., , 2006 Drummond et al., , 2012 Drummond and Rambaut, 2007; Drummond and Suchard, 2010) . A general-time reversible nucleotide substitution model, with gamma distributed among-site rate variation was applied, using a relaxed molecular clock and Bayesian skyline population prior as previously described (Marthaler et al., 2014d) .
