Ethics statement. The study was approved by the "Institutional Human Ethics Committee", of the National Institute of Virology (NIV), India. The NIV is invited by various state governments / local health authorities to investigate epidemics of viral diseases, including hepatitis. During epidemics of hepatitis E, a written informed consent is obtained from all the study subjects by the local health authorities / National Institute of Virology. The healthy pregnant women were bled on the request of the health authorities for the identification of IgManti-HEV positives so that they can be monitored for the symptoms and severity of the disease. Study subjects and clinical data. Table 1 provides details of the study population. The diagnosis of hepatitis E was based on the presence of anti-HEV-IgM antibodies in ELISA [7] and only IgM-anti-HEV positives were included in the study. Patients examined within two weeks of the onset of clinical symptoms were grouped as acute-phase while convalescent phase patients were studied during 4-5 weeks post-disease onset. The study groups included (A) healthy non-pregnant controls (NPR-control), (B) healthy,trimester-1 pregnant controls (PR-1-control), (C) healthy, trimester-2 pregnant controls (PR-2-control), (D) healthy, trimester-3 pregnant controls (PR-3-control), (E) non-pregnant patients (NPR) during early acute phase (NPR-acute), (F) NPR patients during convalescence (NPR-conv), (G) pregnant patients, The study population was identified during 3 epidemics of hepatitis E in the rural areas of the state of Maharashtra, India (2008-2010). Representative acute phase serum samples from these epidemics were subjected to HEV-specific PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis [39] . All the samples belonged to genotype-1. Two types of apparently healthy anti-HEV antibody negative control groups included (1) Non-pregnant subjects (n = 16) and (2) Pregnant women in the second and third trimesters. All the study subjects were screened for IgG and IgM-anti-HEV antibodies, IgM-anti-HAV antibodies, HBsAg, IgM-anti-HBc and anti-HCV antibodies (ELISA, Abbott, USA). A detailed clinical examination was done for all the acute viral hepatitis (AVH) cases. All AVH-E patients had typical symptoms of acute viral hepatitis, such as sudden onset of fever, nausea, vomiting, weakness and jaundice. A subclinical case was defined as an IgM anti-HEV positive with or without elevated ALT levels, no clinical symptoms at the time of first sampling and no development of symptoms up to 2 months follow-up. Anti-HEV antibodies and biochemical parameters. The titres of anti-HEV antibodies were determined by two-fold dilutions of the sera and testing in ELISA [16] . Plasma biochemical parameters and pregnancy hormones were quantitated employing Dimension RxL Max (Siemens Healthcare, 127 USA) and Architect (Abbott, USA) platforms respectively. Statistical analysis. Anti-HEV antibodies titres, plasma biochemical parameters and pregnancy related hormone levels were presented as mean Â± SE. For all analyses, a p value of < 0.05 derived from a two tailed Mann-Whitney test was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed with 'SPSS11.0 for Windows' software (SPSS Inc.). Transcriptome profiling.
