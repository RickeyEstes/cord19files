A retrospective observational study on the analysis of the medical records of children, conducted in a private hospital in the city of São Paulo (SP). Children aged zero to 14 years were included, admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, with a diagnosis of bronchospasm and/or wheezing, and who used the helium-oxygen mixture, as per the organization protocol, between January 1 st , 2012 and December 31 st , 2013. The variables collected in the medical records for analysis of the clinical outcome were severity score; heart rate; respiratory rate; and oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) soon after the installation of the mixture, time point zero, 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 120 minutes. Children were evaluated as to need for oxygen for maintenance of pulse oximetry (SpO 2 ) greater than 92% and degree of respiratory distress, evaluated by the modified Wood clinical asthma score (Table 1) . Additional oxygen was initiated when SpO 2 presented with values inferior to 92%. The oxygen flow utilized was the minimum necessary to maintain SpO 2 >93%. The helium-oxygen mixture was initiated as per the organization protocol.
