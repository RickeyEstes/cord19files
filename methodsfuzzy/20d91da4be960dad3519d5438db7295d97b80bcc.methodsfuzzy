Peptide synthesis. To determine potential vaccine candidates, ten each potential 9-amino acid peptides of SARS-CoV N and S proteins were synthesized. In addition, the HLA-A2.1-binding peptide YMDGTMSQV (tyrosinase 369-377) and the HLA-A1-binding peptide EADPTGHSY (MAGE-1 161-169) [9] were tested positive and negative control, respectively. These peptides were synthesized by solid-phase strategies on an automated peptide synthesizer (Abimed AMS 422) using Fmoc chemistry. Peptides were analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 1-5 mg/ml, liquated, and stored at À70°C. T2-cell stabilization assay: stabilization of HLA-A2.1 on the surface of T2-cells by synthetic peptides. To determine whether synthetic peptides could bind to HLA-A * 0201 molecules, peptide-induced HLA-A * 0201 upregulation on T2-cells was examined according to a protocol described previously [8] . To measure the relative amounts of HLA-A2.1-peptide complexes formed, 2 · 10 6 cells were incubated with 100 lg of each N or S protein peptide for 3.5 h at 26°C in HBSS supplemented with 5% FBS, 5 lg/ml human b 2-microglobulin (Sigma), and 5 lg/ml brefeldin A. The various titrations of peptide for T2-cell binding assay were tested, and 100 lg of peptide was the approximate concentration for this assay (data not shown). The cells were then washed and incubated for an additional 2 h at 37°C to allow the remaining peptide-free MHC molecules to denature, followed by indirect immunofluorescence staining for HLA-A2.1 expression with BB7.2 Ab and goat anti-mouse IgG (F(ab')2) FITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), being fixed with 1% para-formaldehyde, and being analyzed by flow cytometry. Results were calculated as a percentage of HLA-A2.1 expression using the formula: (fluorescence intensity of experimental peptide binding to HLA-A2.1 À mock peptide binding to HLA-A2.1) · 100%. Production of recombinant N protein. The recombinant N protein was expressed from pRSETA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in Escherichia coli system BL21(DE3)Gold (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX, USA) by DNA recombinant technology and purified by Ni-NTA resin as reported by Liu et al. [10] . Animals. HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice were purchased and imported from the Jackson Laboratory, and maintained in our Institute under specific pathogen-free conditions. The transgenic mice with C57BL/6 background that express a MHC-I molecule of human HLA-A2.1 have been described previously [11] . These transgenic mice received each N-or S-specific peptide (100 lg) or N protein (50 lg) with 30 lg CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN 1826) via intramuscular injection three times at one week intervals. One week after the last immunization, we mapped the CTL epitopes of N and S proteins by analyzing antigen-specific CD8 + interferon-c + (IFN-c + ) double-positive cells in HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice with flow cytometry [12, 13] . Intracytoplasmic cytokine staining and flow cytometry analysis. Splenocytes (2 · 10 6 ) from peptide vaccinated HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice or controls were incubated for 12 h with a 30 lg stimulator (each N or S synthetic peptide) for the detection of N or S peptide-specific CD8 + T-cell precursors. Golgistop (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) was added into each well at 6 h before the cells were harvested. Cells were then washed twice in FACScan buffer and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD8b.2 (Ly-3.2) monoclonal antibody (PharMingen). Cells were subjected to intracellular cytokine staining using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (PharMingen). Phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse IFN-c monoclonal antibody was purchased from PharMingen. FACS analysis was performed on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan with CELLQuest software (Becton-Dickinson Immunocytometry System, Mountain View, CA). HLA-A * 0201 typing. Blood samples were collected in acid citrate dextrose tubes and transported within 24 h to the Immunohematology Reference Laboratory, Mackay Memorial Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan). All samples were tested for HLA-A, B, C serology (standard microlymphocytotoxicity technique) using Terasaki Chinese HLA-ABC 72-Well Trays (lots 2, 3, 3A, 3B) [14] . In vitro vaccination and IFN-c assay. Samples were obtained with informed consent from Tri-Service General Hospital and Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, and the study was approved by the institutional Human Investigation Review Committee. Human PBMCs were isolated, respectively from 5 normal and 5 full recovery patients of severe SARS-infection with HLA-A * 0201 type by separation on Ficoll-Hypaque density gradients and re-suspended in T-cell medium [15] . These five recovery patients including one laboratory worker and four hospital nurses contracted SARS-CoV during the epidemic period on 2003 [16] . They were afflicted with SARS disease and hospitalized until full recovery. All of them were identified virus RNA in respiratory secretions. Antibodies against SARS-CoV were detected by SARS-specific IgG capture ELISA and end-point dilution Ab titers. The Ab titers were =1:16 and were observed in all recovered patients. No Ab to SARS-CoV was detected in any healthy donors. All patients' bloods were harvested over one year post-infection. The isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated on plastic dishes for 2 h. The non-adherent lymphocytes were aspirated, the adherent fraction was cultured in medium containing 1% polled human AB serum, recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (1000 IU/ml), and recombinant human interleukin 4 (IL-4) (1000 IU/ml) (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.). One hundred micrograms of recombinant N protein or the combination of multiple S peptides was incubated with the adherent cells at 37°C. Recombinant human interleukin 2 (IL-2) (10 IU/ml), recombinant human interleukin 7 (IL-7) (10 IU/ml), recombinant human interleukin 1-beta (IL-1b) (10 ng/ml), and recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) (10 ng/ml) were added every second days into antigen-vaccinated adherent cells. Three days after the initial addition of antigens to adherent cells, autologous blood lymphocytes (non-adherent cells) (2 · 10 6 /well) were coincubated with adherent cells, on the second day recombinant human interleukin 2 (IL-2) (10 IU/ml) was added. Cultures were fed with medium containing penicillin, streptomycin, IL-2, and IL-7. After 7 to 15 days of culture, the CD8 + T-cells were purified by labeling blood lymphocytes with magnetic microbeads coated with anti-CD8 + antibody in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations (Miltenyi Biotech GmbH) and separated on an Automacs device (Miltenyi Biotech GmbH) using the series procedures [17] . The isolated CD8 + T-cells were then stimulated with each indicated peptide, and the next day, the supernatants were collected and analyzed for IFN-c (polyclonal Ab) with an ELISA kit (Quantikine, R&D systems). The series concentrations of standard protein (0, 15.6, 31.2, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 pg/ml) were parallely measured for the reference, accordingly the concentrations of IFN-c in each test were calculated.
