We employ an event-study and regression based methodology to evaluate the impact of the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak events on stock returns and to test the role of the geographic proximity of information. The traditional event-study methodology is exercised to evaluate the general impact of the Ebola outbreak events upon companies' stock returns through the one-factor and two-factor market models, as inspired by prior research (e.g., Fang and Peress, 2009; Peress, 2014) . The one-factor model is estimated as: where r i, t is the rate of return on stock i in period t and r m, t is the S& P500 rate of return, which serves as proxy for the market portfolio. The two-factor market model is estimated as: where r i, t is the rate return on stock i in period t, r m, t is the S&P500 rate of return and r ind, t is the industry specific rate of return. We begin our analysis by computing the cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) around the events considered. The abnormal returns (ARs) are defined as the difference between the actual rate of return of the stock considered and its ex-post expected rate of return over the whole length of the event window. We position 100 days in the estimation window and 11 days in the event window-5 days prior and 5 days after the event day noted as day 0 (for more on event study designs, see MacKinlay, 1997) . The sample of events that we observe is temporally clustered. Hence, the event study would suffer from overlapping windows if all events were considered. For this reason, we use only events with nonoverlapping event windows (there is 40 such events). We use one of the two selection criteria to select events. The first selection criterion is labelled as the last occurrence and chooses an event only if it is not followed by another event within 10 days after its occurrence. The second selection criterion is labelled as the first occurrence and selects events in chronological order (sequence). It starts with the first event in the sample, ignores all events showing up in the following 10 days, takes the next event in succession, ignores the following 10 days, and so on until the whole sample is exhausted. In a more illustrative way, assume there are five events taking place on dates ɗ 0 , ɗ 1 , ɗ 2 , ɗ 3 , and ɗ 4 where ɗ 1 , ɗ 2 , and ɗ 3 are temporally clustered. The last occurrence uses events for CAR calculation taking place on days ɗ 0 , ɗ 3 , and ɗ 4 and the first occurrence chooses ɗ 0 , ɗ 1 , and ɗ 4 . With this strategy, we avoid unintentional bunching of events with overlapping windows in the same basket. To observe whether the geographic proximity of information to the financial markets significantly affects stock returns, we run the following regression model (see, e.g., Levy, 2010a, 2010b; Kamstra et al., 2003; Brown and Warner, 1985) : where r i, t is the rate of return of stock i on day t, γ 0 is the regression intercept, r i, t − j is the lagged dependent variable-the jth previous day rate of return, WD k, t with k = 1, …, 4 are dummy variables for the day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday), Tax t is a dummy variable for the first five days of the taxation year, and finally, EL l, t with l = 1, 2, and 3, are dummy variables that denote the location where the event happened and equal 1 on the event day if the event happened in a specific region (either in the U.S., the WAC region, or Europe), and zero otherwise. The reason for including rates of return in previous days, r i, t − j in the regression in Eq. (3) is a potential presence of a serial correlation. A serial correlation is one of the known anomalies that may contaminate the results and may occur as a result of time-varying expected returns, non-synchronous trading, or transaction costs (see, e.g., Schwert, 1990a Schwert, , 1990b Schwert, , 2003 Campbell et al., 1993) . We look at as many previous days' returns as is necessary to ensure that all significant correlations have been accounted for. In our case, it is the rates of return of the first five previous days. Following French (1980) , Schwert (1990a) , and Cho et al. (2007) , we also acknowledge that the Ebola outbreak events may not be evenly distributed over the week either by the coincidence or by the nature of the events. We use dummies for each day of the week, WD it , to capture the so-called "Monday effects" or "weekend effect." 10 Lastly, we add a dummy for the first five days of the taxation year, Tax t , starting at January 1, to account for the so-called "turn-of-the-year effect" (see, e.g., Chien and Chen, 2008) 11 To account for a potential reversal effect (driven by positive/ 7 Operation ownership: the company needs to have min 50.01% of known shareholders in the country of domicile and at least one subsidiary, affiliate or branch located in the region of interest.

For more evidence on the effect, see Cho, Linton and Whang (2007) . 11 The "turn-of-the-year effect" follows a pattern of a unique trading volume and higher stock prices in the last week of December and the first two weeks of January (see, e.g., Chien & Chen 2008). R. Ichev, M. Marinč International Review of Financial Analysis 56 (2018) 153-166 negative sentiments), we also run the following regression: where we look at the rate of return on the event day, E 0, t , and the first five subsequent trading days, E l, t (l = 1…5) 12 (MacKinlay, 1997). The following five hypotheses are tested in this study. First, we test whether the geographic proximity of information (disseminated by the Ebola outbreak events) has a statistically significant impact on the financial markets (more specifically, on companies' stock returns). We observe the U.S. publicly listed companies having exposure to events of three different geographic locations: the U.S. only, the WAC region, and Europe. We predict that the event effect (on the event day, i.e., day 0) will be strongest for the companies having exposure to the U.S. only and the WAC region since these companies are geographically closer to both the birthplace of the disease and to the financial markets (Engelberg and Parsons, 2011) . Second, we hypothesize that the event effect is stronger for the stock returns of small companies relative to large companies. This hypothesis is supported by the past research suggesting that local investors are usually the ones investing in small firms, thus their sentiment is affected by event information that is specific to the place and firm that they invest into (see, Brown and Cliff, 2005; Edmans et al., 2007) . Third, the Ebola outbreak as a type of event is perceived to increase bad mood as well as anxiety among investors, negatively affecting company returns. We proxy investor sentiment through stock price volatility. We hypothesize that the effect on the event day (i.e., day 0) is larger for more volatile stocks than for less volatile stocks (see, Kaplanski and Levy, 2010a) . Fourth, investors often hold very polarized stock portfolios. In our case, this means that some investors bet on a positive impact of the Ebola outbreak on certain stocks while others hold the opposite view. Having this in mind, we select the 12 largest industries, by contribution to the U.S. GDP, and test how (positively or negatively) the Ebola outbreak events affect each industry. We anticipate companies from the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industry to be positively affected whereas the companies from aviation and tourism sectors to experience a negative impact. Fifth, previous studies confirm that the intense media coverage significantly affects stock returns, trading volume, stock liquidity, and stock variability (see, Fang and Peress, 2009) . We hypothesize that the companies exposed to the intense media coverage are more affected by the Ebola outbreak events than the companies that receive less media exposure. We now present the results of the event-study methodology. Fig. 2a -f depict the CARs around the event date whereas Table A .5-A.9 in the Appendix reveal the event study results in greater details. Fig. 2a shows that the one-factor market model CARs on the event day are statistically significant and negative for all three groups of the companies categorized by the exposure of their operations towards the regions of interest. Negative CARs are followed by a reversal effect on the first trading day following the event day. The CARs are the most negative for the companies having exposure to the WAC region (− 0.0198 and t-value of − 2.108), followed by the companies with the exposure to the U.S. only (− 0.0140 and t-value of − 6.114), and, followed by the companies with the exposure of their operations to Europe (− 0.0101 with t-value of − 6.887). We use the two-factor model to match each company's CARs to the corresponding industry of operation and analyze whether the CARs are driven by the noise in the market (French and Roll, 1986) . Similarly to the single factor model, the CARs for the companies with exposure of their operations to the U.S. only and to the WAC region are negative (−0.0145 with t-value of −6.163 for the U.S. and −0.0192 with t-value of −2.162 for the WAC region) and larger compared to the CARs for the companies with exposure of their operations to Europe (−0.0135 with t-value of −6.825). More evidence on these effects can be found in Table A .5. In Fig. 2b and c, the portfolios of stocks are categorized by size and stock return volatility. Decile 10 (smallest firms) and decile 1 (highest volatility) show stronger negative CARs compared to the large and least volatile stocks (see also Tables A.6 and A.7). Furthermore, we find that aviation companies are the most negatively affected by the Ebola outbreak events whereas the companies producing healthcare equipment are on the other extreme and benefited the most (see Fig. 2d and Table  A .8 for more details). Lastly, the companies under the intense media coverage exhibit stronger negative and statistically significant CARs compared to the companies that are not exposed to the intense media coverage (see, Fig. 2e ). Under the intense media coverage, the trading volume, price range, and bid-ask spreads of the companies significantly increase around the event day (see Fig. 2f and Table A .9). Overall, our event study analysis points to a negative impact of the Ebola outbreak events towards the U.S. companies' stock returns. We stress that the event study results are weaker than the regression results reported in the next section due to the fact that only 40 out of 103 events were employed in the CAR analysis-as a result of the event nonoverlapping selection criteria.
