The herd comprised approximately 60 milking cows and 100 heifers and both heifer and bull calves in a loose housing cowshed. Most of the animals were of Swedish Red and White breed but some were of Swedish Friesian breed or crossbreeds. The calves were reared either for dairy replacement or as finished beef. The cows and most of the heifers were artificially inseminated by the local AI association, though some heifers were naturally mated with a bull. For reasons of economy and practicality, the animals were served between October and July. Consequently, most of the calvings occurred between July and April. In early January 1990 there were signs of a mild respiratory disease among most of the animals, which lasted for about 1 week. About 1 week later, an outbreak of diarrhoea occurred among the cows, accompanied by a fall in milk production. On 1 March one cow died after a few days of diarrhoea. An offspring of this cow, calved in late February, developed diarrhoea on 5 March and was slaughtered on 10 March. At necropsy, among other findings, there were erosions of the epithelia of the mucosa in the mouth, oesophagus and abomasum. Attempts to isolate BVDV from sera of the two animals failed. At this time, however, BVDV was isolated from a 1-month-old calf that was slaughtered because of severe pneumonia. On 27 March, milk samples were collected from all lactating cows and blood samples from all non-lactating animals. All but three animals proved antibody-positive to BVDV. The three antibody-negative animals were found to be BVDV-negative. A reproductive problem was evident during the winter and spring of 1990. Cows returned for service several times and abortions occurred. From July to September 1990, 12 calves were born with a persistent BVDV infection. Blood or milk samples were taken from all animals on 27 March 1990 and blood samples from all calves born from March 1990 to May 1991 once or more when they were 8 weeks or older. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (SVA-NOVA Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to detect antibodies to BVDV in serum (Juntti et al., 1987) and in milk (Niskanen et al., 1989) . Serum and milk samples were deemed negative for BVDV antibodies if the absorbance values (A45o) were less than 0.21 and 0.05, respectively. The presence of BVDV in sera was tested by inoculation on cultures of embryonic bovine turbinate ceils. Briefly, 20/A of serum and 100/zl of turbinate cells ( 105 cells ml-~ ) were added per well in quadruplicate in microtitre plates. After 4 days of incubation at 37 o C, the cultures were examined for cytopathic effects and the presence of BVDV was determined by an indirect immunoperoxidase test (Meyling, 1984) . A calf was considered to be PI if the BVDV was isolated from the serum on two occasions 2 months apart. A calf was considered to be non-PI either if it had a moderate (0.40 ~< A45o > 0.70 ) or a high level of BVDV antibodies, or if it had no, or a low level of BVDV antibodies (A45o < 0.40) and was virus-negative.
