The zoonoses programme managers of the ministries of health (MOH) and agriculture (MAg) from 33 LAC countries (in South and Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean) were invited to participate in a survey, which comprised 36 single, multiple choice and open-ended questions, using an online PDF questionnaire created in Adobe Forms Central 1 (S1 Survey). The questionnaire included a cover sheet explaining the objectives of the survey, clarifying that the identity of individual countries would be protected, and that the data would be presented in an aggregated form for the region. The questionnaire was available in English, Spanish and Portuguese. The survey collected data on respondent demographics, zoonoses programme resources, priority endemic and emerging zoonotic diseases, prioritization methodologies and criteria, disease specific capacities, current collaborations in zoonotic diseases and suggestions for future technical collaboration. The survey included a glossary to define terms such as 'emerging,' 'endemic' and 'prioritization' (S1 Survey). Five PAHO/WHO experts piloted the survey. The survey opened in January 2015 and remained open for approximately 5 weeks. Technical support sessions were held during the survey period to assist the completion of the questionnaire. After the official closure of the survey on February 11th, all non-respondents were followed up by email or telephone. The last questionnaire was received April 1, 2015. The data was analyzed using R open access software (i386 3.1.2) [14] and JMP 11.0.0 [15] . Exploratory data analyses were performed to show response frequencies aggregated at the regional level and compared by ministry (MOH vs. MAg) and by sub-regions (defined as South America, Central America and Mexico, and the Caribbean). Countries' population, gross domestic product (GDP) and income, as per the World Bank classification [16] were used to inform countries' comparisons. Results are presented separately for endemic and emerging zoonoses. The questionnaire requested that respondents be as specific as possible and list genus, species, and subspecies of priority zoonoses. Because not all respondents provided this level of detail, the responses were coded into broad disease categories for further analysis. Responses to the questions exploring capacity development (three pertaining to endemic zoonoses, and four to emerging) were scored (0 for absence, 1 for presence, and equal fractions adding to 1 if more than two options were possible, e.g. having conducted simulation exercises for each of the three priority emerging zoonoses) and added (to a possible total score of 7), to allow comparisons between countries and sub-regions, in effect generating profiles for capacity building. For countries with both ministries responding, the ministry scores were averaged to calculate the country score. K-Means cluster analysis, using the fpc, pvclust and mclust packages in R, were performed on the 7 emerging and endemic capacity component scores for each country. This exploratory analysis was developed to identify country groupings based on their capacity portfolios to serve as a guide for technical cooperation needs.
