Plasmids. The AAV2, AAV5, and AAV8 bait plasmids were constructed by first PCR amplifying homologous regions (nucleic acid residues 439-1,860 (AAV2), 436-1,827 (AAV5), 442-1,869 (AAV8) of each AAV cap gene) from the AAV helper plasmids pDG, 37 pDP5, 38 and pE5/V18, 5 respectively, using the following primers: AAV2 (CGGAATTCGAGCA CTCTCCTGTGGAGCCA and CGGGATCCGCTTTGCCCAGATGGGC CCCTG); AAV5 (CGGAATTCGACCACTTTCCAAAAAGAAAG and GA AGATCTACTTGGCCCAGATGGGTCCTTG); and AAV8 (CGGAATTCC CATCACCCCAGCGTTCTCCA and GAAGATCTGCTTGGCCCAGATG GGACCCTG). The PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI for AAV2, or BglII and EcoRI for AAV5 and AAV8, before ligation into the BamHI-/EcoRI-linearized plasmid pGBK-T7 (BD Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). In the resulting constructs, the cap genes were fused in-frame with a Gal4 DNA-binding domain. The mouse cathepsin B and L cDNAs were amplified from a mouse liver cDNA library (BD Clontech) using the following primers: cathepsin B (CGGAATTCACCATGTGGTGG TCCTTGATCCT and CCGCTCGAGTTAGAATCTTCCCCAGTACT), and cathepsin L (ACGCCAATTGACCATGAATCTTTTACTCTTTT and CCGCTCGAGTCAATTCACGACAGGATAGC). The cathepsin B and L PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI, or MfeI and XhoI, respectively, and then cloned into the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) vector digested with EcoRI and XhoI. Yeast two-hybrid screen. The initial two-hybrid screen was conducted using the AAV8 bait plasmid, the mouse liver Matchmaker cDNA library (BD Clontech), and the yeast strain AH109 (MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3,  leu2-112, ura3-52, his3-200, gal4D, gal80D, LYS2 ::GAL1 UAS -GAL1 TATA -HIS3, GAL2 UAS -GAL2 TATA -ADE2, URA3::MEL1 UAS -MEL1 TATA -lacZ) (BD Clontech). Clones were selected for growth on SD media (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and supplemented with the appropriate amino acids at a concentration of 0.004%), lacking Shown are the proteins recovered in our screen for which we subsequently confirmed the ability to bind to AAV2 and AAV8 particles. The laminin receptor acts as a cellular receptor for both serotypes, allowing them to bind to and subsequently enter the cell. Once the particle enters the endosome, cathepsins B and L bind to and cleave both capsids, but the AAV8 and AAV2 capsids appear to be cleaved differently. Following particle processing, they are released from the endosome and traffic to the nucleus, where AAV8 has previously been shown to uncoat more readily. 23 Molecular Therapy vol. 15 no. 2, feb. 2007 adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. To isolate the plasmid DNA from yeast, cells were resuspended in 200 ml lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 8), 1 mM EDTA (pH 8)), before the addition of glass beads and 200 ml phenol. After vortexing for 2 min, the cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 r.p.m. The DNA was ethanol precipitated from the aqueous phase, resuspended in water, and transformed into Escherichia coli. Library plasmid DNA was isolated, sequenced, and then analyzed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST program. b-Galactosidase assays. Activity of the lacZ reporter gene was determined using b-galactosidase assays with chlorophenolred-Dgalactopyranoside as a substrate according to BD Clontech. Briefly, the cells were grown overnight in selective SD media lacking leucine and tryptophan, and then diluted in YPD media (1% bacto-yeast extract, 2% bacto-tryptone, 2% glucose). After 4 h, the OD 600 of the yeast culture was measured (later used to calculate the Miller units, see below) before resuspending the cells in buffer 1 (2.38% HEPES, 0.9% NaCl, 0.065% L-Aspartate, 1% BSA, and 0.05% Tween 20) , and subsequently lysing them via three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen. The CPRG substrate was dissolved to a concentration of 0.1335% in buffer 1 and added to the lysed cells. The reaction was stopped using 3 mM zinc chloride, and the OD 578 of the sample was taken to calculate the Miller units ¼ (1,000 Â OD 578 )/(time (min) Â OD 600 ). AAV transduction in mammalian cells. 3.75 Â 10 4 NIH-3T3 cells per well were grown overnight in 24-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. Cells were transfected with the cathepsin B or L expression vectors, or pd2EGFP-N1 (BD Clontech) using Polyfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were incubated for 4 h with the cathepsin inhibitor Ca074-Me (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) before addition of the AAV2, AAV5 or AAV8(gfp) vectors. The AAV(gfp) vector construct, consisting of a double-stranded genome expressing the gfp gene from an Rous sarcoma virus promoter, will be described in detail elsewhere (Grimm et al., manuscript in preparation) . Briefly, it was engineered by assembling a full-length AAV2 ITR together with a subfragment of an AAV4 inverted terminal repeat , in a pBlueScriptII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) backbone. The AAV4 fragment contained the entire ITR sequence except for the terminal resolution site, to prevent DNA nicking during vector DNA replication. The dsAAV(gfp) vector plasmid was pseudotyped with the three different capsids using a standard triple plasmid transfection approach. 39 The virus was purified using cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation and quantitated by dot blot assay. The resulting virus particles were then added to the cells at the following ratio (particles/cell): 5 Â 10 6 for AAV5 or AAV8(gfp), or 1 Â 10 5 for AAV2(gfp). The cells were trypsinized 24 h later and analyzed by fluorescent-activated cell sorting. Treatment of AAV with purified cathepsin. An 8.5 mg portion of purified bovine spleen cathepsin B, 7.8 mg of purified bovine kidney cathepsin L in reaction buffer (50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, 3 mM dithiothreitol ), or 6 mg of human recombinant cathepsin S in reaction buffer (50 mM sodium acetate pH 7.4, 3 mM DTT) (all from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) was incubated with AAV2, AAV5, or AAV8 particles for 8 h at 371C in a final volume of 30 ml. Ca074-Me 10 nmol was added to individual reactions to inhibit cathepsin B or L activity. Proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min after the addition of Laemmli buffer. The samples were resolved on a 7.5 or 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting with a-VP1,2 and ,3 antibody or the monoclonal B1 antibody (both from American Research Products, Belmont, MA). For experiments shown in Figure 5d , 2 Â 10 10 recombinant particles of AAV2 or AAV8 were incubated with increasing amounts of cathepsin B in a 20 ml reaction volume for 16 h at 371C.
