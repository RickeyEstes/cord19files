After noticing there is a difference between the 2 battalions in the development of ARIs at the end of 2 weeks of training, we interviewed the battalion commanders to determine any factors that may be related to one battalion having a higher incidence of ARI. We evaluated whether there are differences in the training schedules, living environments, and hand washing methods in the barracks and during outdoor activities.
