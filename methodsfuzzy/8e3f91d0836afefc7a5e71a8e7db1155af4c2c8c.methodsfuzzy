Expression and purification of IBV spike ectodomain IBV spike gene (virus strain M41; GenBank number ABI26423.1) was synthesized (Genscript) with codons optimized for insect cell expression. Its ectodomain (residues 20-1084) was cloned into pFastBac vector (Life Technologies Inc.) with a N-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide and C-terminal GCN4 and His 6 tags. It was expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies Inc.) and purified as previously described [21] . Briefly, the protein was harvested from cell culture medium, and purified sequentially on Ni-NTA column and Superdex200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). IBV S1-CTD (residues 248-495) was expressed and purified in the same way as the IBV spike ectodomain, although it only contains a C-terminal His 6 tag and does not contain the GCN4 tag.
