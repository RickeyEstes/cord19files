Interestingly, HDAC6 has been described as substrate for GRK2 (3) and HDAC6 is also known to play a role in IAV uncoating (4). However, it was reported that phosphorylation of HDAC6 impacts its deacetylase activity, which was shown not be involved in HDAC6' role in uncoating. Furthermore, we did not detect any HDAC6 phosphopeptide and did not observe changes in HDAC6 phosphorylation upon IAV infection. We therefore believe that HDAC6 is unlikely to mediate the proviral effect of GRK2. We have included a section that discusses these results in l. 418-431. 


Section:substrates of grk2 in the previous version of our manuscript we had a section on the role of hdac6 as potential grk2 target in the discussion but we appreciate the reviewer's point that we should expand on the potential targets of grk2. the canonical target of grk2 is beta-arrestin, which plays an important role in g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) signalling. however, we did not detect any phosphopeptides of beta-arrestin in our proteomic analysis and we could not detect any change in phosphorylation status of beta-arrestin upon iav infection when employing the phos-tag method. furthermore, a metaanalysis of several rnai screens for host factors required for iav infection predicted no significant impact of beta-arrestin knockdown on iav infection. we thus conclude that the proviral effect of grk2 is mediated by a non-canonical substrate of grk2.
