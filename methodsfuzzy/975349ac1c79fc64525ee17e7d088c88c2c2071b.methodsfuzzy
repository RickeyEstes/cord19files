We do not expect to know the full distribution g(τ ) -particularly while an epidemic is ongoing -so we are interested in approximations to R based on limited information. We follow the approach of [29] and approximate the generation interval with a gamma distribution. We prefer the gamma distribution to the standard normal approximation used in many applications for a number of reasons. First, it is more biologically realistic, since it is confined to non-negative values. Second, it has a convenient momentgenerating function, and provides a corresponding simple form for the r-R relationship that can be parameterized with only two parameters that have biologically relevant meanings that can assist in explaining intuition behind the r-R relationship. Third, it generalizes the result obtained from simple Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) models, and approximately matches Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR), in the case where the latent period and infectious period are similar (see Appendix). While the gamma approximation has been applied to infer R in previous outbreaks (Table 1) , its theoretical properties and practical importance has not yet been explored in depth. For biological interpretability, we describe the gamma distribution using the meanḠ and the squared coefficient of variation κ (thus κ = 1/a, and G = aθ, where a and θ are the shape and scale parameters under the standard parameterization of the gamma distribution). Substituting the gamma distribution into (5) then yields the gamma-approximated speed-strength relationship: 6 .

The longer the generation interval is compared to C, the higher the estimate of R (see Fig. 1 ). We then explore the behaviour of the gammaapproximated speed-strength relationship R gamma defined above (equivalent to the Tsallis "q-exponential", with q = 1 − κ [43] ): its shape determines how the estimate of R changes with the estimate of normalized generation length ρ. For small ρ, R gamma always looks like 1 + ρ, regardless of the shape parameter 1/κ, which determines the curvature: if 1/κ = 1, we get a straight 7 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/312397 doi: bioRxiv preprint line, for 1/κ = 2 the curve is quadratic, and so on (see Fig. 2 ). For large values of 1/κ, R gamma converges toward exp(ρ). The limit as κ → 0 is reasonably easy to interpret. The incidence is increasing by a factor of exp(ρ) in the time it takes for an average disease generation. If κ = 0, the generation interval is fixed, so the average case must cause exactly R = exp(ρ) new cases. If variation in the generation time (i.e., κ) increases, then some new cases will be produced before, and some after, the mean generation time. Since we assume the disease is increasing exponentially, infections that occur early on represent a larger proportion of the population, and thus will have a disproportionate effect: individuals don't have to produce as many lifetime infections to sustain the growth rate, and thus we expect R < exp(ρ) (as shown by [44] ). The straight-line relationship for κ = 1 also has a biological interpretation. This case corresponds to the classic SIR model, where the infectious period is exponentially distributed [6] . In this case, recovery rate and infection rate are constant for each individual. The rate of exponential growth per generation is then given directly by the net per capita increase in infections: R − 1, where one represents the recovery of the initial infectious individual. Characterizing the r-R relationship with mean and coefficient of variation also helps explain results based on compartmental models [46, 37] , because the mean and variance of the generation interval is linked to the mean and variance of latent and infectious periods. Shorter mean latent and infectious periods result in shorter generation intervals, and thus smaller R estimates. Less-variable latent periods result in less-variable generation intervals, and thus higher R estimates. Less-variable infectious periods have more complicated effects. While they reduce variation in generation interval (which would be expected to increase R estimates), they also reduce the mean generation interval [39] (which would lead to a decrease). This explains the apparent anomaly between earlier results: when mean generation interval is held constant, the effect of less-variable infectious periods is to reduce variation, leading to lower R for a given r [37] ; when mean infectious period is held constant the effect of reducing generation interval will be stronger, leading to higher R [46] . There is a simple intuition for this latter result. In an exponentially growing epidemic, things that happen earlier have the largest effect. If we increase the variation in latent period while holding R constant, we have more early progression and more late progression to infectiousness. The former effect will be more important, and thus increasing variation should The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/312397 doi: bioRxiv preprint increase r for a given value of R -or, equivalently, decrease R for a given value of r. Increasing variation in infectious period has the opposite effect: it increases the amount of both early and late recovery, and thus leads to smaller r for a given value of R (and conversely). We test our approximation method by generating a pseudo-realistic generation-interval distributions using previously estimated/observed latent and infectious period distributions for different diseases ( Table 2 ). For each pseudo-realistic distribution, we calculate the "true" relationship between r and R and compare it with a relationship inferred based on gamma distribution approximations. These approximations are first done with large amounts of data, allowing us to evaluate how well the approximations describe the r-R relationship under ideal conditions, and then tested with smaller amounts of data to assess how well methods perform when data is limited. Estimating generation intervals is complex; our goal with pseudo-realistic distributions is not to precisely match real diseases, but to generate distributions that are likely to be roughly as challenging for our approximation methods as real distributions would be. We construct pseudo-realistic intervals from sampled latent and infectious periods by adding the sampled latent period to a an infection delay chosen uniformly from the sampled infectious period: where G i , E i and I i are the sampled intrinsic generation interval, latent period, and infectious period, respectively, and U represents a uniform random deviate. This implicitly assumes that infectiousness is constant across the infectious period [13] . We sample from latent and infectious periods obtained from observations (for empirical distributions), or by using a uniform set of quantiles (for parametric distributions). For the purpose of constructing pseudo-realistic distributions, we do not attempt to correct for the fact that observed intervals may be sampled in a context more relevant to backward than to intrinsic generation intervals (see [8] ). We sample latent periods at random, and infectious periods by length-weighted resampling (since longer infectious period implies more opportunities to infect). For our examples, we used 10,000 quantiles for each parametric distribution and 10,000 sampled generation intervals for each disease (see Appendix). We then calculate "exact" relationships (for our pseudo-realistic distributions) by substituting sampled generation intervals into the exact speedstrength relationship (5) . This relationship is then compared to the corresponding gamma-approximated relationship (6) . All calculations, numerical analyses and figures were made with the software platform R [34] .
