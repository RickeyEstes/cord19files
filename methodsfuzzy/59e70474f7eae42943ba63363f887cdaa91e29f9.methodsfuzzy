This policy analysis used a multiple case study design to examine policies at the federal, provincial and local levels of public health in Canada. Four policies were studied: (a) vaccine priority, (b) use of adjuvanted vaccine among pregnant women, (c) school closures as a containment strategy, and (d) recommendations on N95 respirators as a form of personal protective equipment (PPE) ( Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1) .
