Automatic nucleic acid extraction was carried out using a total nucleic acid kit on a MagNa Pure Compact instrument (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), following the manufacturer's instruction. Amplifications of parts of the specific genes of InfV A/ B, adenovirus (AdV), parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3 (PIV 1-3), hRV/EV, RSV, hMPV, hCoV (hCoV-229E, hCoV-NL63, hCoV-HKU1, and hCoV-OC43), and human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) were performed using assays previously described [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . PCR amplification of EV was conducted on a Light Cycler instrument 480 II (Roche, Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) using an Enterovirus R-gene realtime PCR kit (ARGENE, Biomerieux, Verniolle, France) and performed following the manufacturer's instructions.
