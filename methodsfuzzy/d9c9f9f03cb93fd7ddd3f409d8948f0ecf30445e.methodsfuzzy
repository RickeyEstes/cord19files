Animals. Sprague-Dawley time-pregnant female rats were purchased from Envigo (Indianapolis, IN, USA) and on embryonic day 15, euthanized for embryo collection. All animal handling was strictly adhering to protocols that were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Louisville and the NIH guidelines. Cell culture and transfections. Cultures of primary cortical rat neural progenitor cells (rNPCs) and cortical neurons were prepared from E15 rat embryos using previously described protocols with modifications 62, 63 . Briefly, cerebral cortex was dissected and meninges were removed. Then, rNPCs were isolated by triturating the tissue four times with a 1-ml pipette tip and grown as neurospheres in Neurobasal medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2% B-27 Supplement (Gibco), 1 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 20 ng/ml bFGF (R&D Systems, Cat#233-FB-025), and 20 ng/ml EGF (R&D Systems, Cat#236-EG-200). Neurons were isolated by trituration of papain-digested tissue and plated onto Poly-D-Lysine-and laminin-coated 12 mm diameter plastic cover-slips that were produced in the lab from the electron microscopy-grade Mylar masks (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield). The culture medium was Basal Medium Eagle (BME, Lonza) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum (HyClone, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Logan, UT, USA), 35 mM glucose, 1 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. The gliostatic drug cytosine arabinoside was not used due to its high toxicity in embryonic neuronal cultures. Neuronal transfections were performed on DIV2 (day in vitro 2) using Lipofectamine 2000 as described previously 64 Viruses and viral infection. ZIKV strains MR766 and PRVABC59 were provided by Dr. Barbara Johnson (CDC) and amplified in Vero76 cells as described previously 65, 66 . Viral titers were determined using the virus infection center assay as described elsewhere 67 . Viral stocks were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use. All cells were infected at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.1. Infections were performed in freshly isolated rNPCs that were grown to promote neurosphere formation (5*10 5 cells per 35 mm plate), adherent hNPCs or DIV1 rat neurons that were plated 1 day before infection; plating densities were 100,000 or 350,000 cells/well in a 24 well plate, respectively. Neurosphere analysis. Starting at 1 day post infection (dpi), neurospheres that were formed by rNPCs were observed and photographed daily using phase contrast microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TS100, 4x or 20x objective lenses were used for neurosphere counting or imaging, respectively). Number of neurospheres was determined in 5 randomly selected sight fields. As neurosphere forming potential differed between various preparations of rNPCs, data from independent experiments were compared after normalization to fold change of mock-infected control for each individual experiment. At 3 dpi neurosphere-grown rNPCs were dissociated with Stem Pro Accutase (Gibco) and plated onto Poly-D-Lysine/laminin-coated plastic cover-slips to obtain adherent monolayers of rNPC for microscopic analysis at a single cells level. After 16 h culture, rNPC monolayers were fixed and used for immunofluorescence staining.
