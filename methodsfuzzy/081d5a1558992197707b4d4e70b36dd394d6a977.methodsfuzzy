The study included excess nasopharyngeal aspirate samples available at the Molecular Microbiology Laboratory of the Children's Hospital Sant Joan de Déu after routine analyses of a multiple viral profile between October 2011 and January 2013. A first subset of fresh samples was prospectively analyzed by the mariPOC Assay and by the Anyplex II RV16 Assay, while a second subset of fresh samples was analyzed by the Luminex xTag RVP Fast Assay prospectively, frozen at −80°C for storage and then defrosted for retrospective analysis by the mariPOC Assay. Data of results of these PCR assays were prospectively registered and linked with sample identification numbers. No demographic and epidemiological data were linked with each sample. Specimens were collected from children/adolescents b18 years admitted to the hospital with non-specific suspicion of acute respiratory infection. The setting is a 345-bed size, tertiary-care children's hospital located in the metropolitan area of Barcelona (Spain), which provides healthcare coverage to a pediatric population of~200,000 children. Search for pathogens covered respiratory viruses that could be detectable by all 3 techniques (ADV; hMPV; IFV-A and IFV-B; PIV-1, PIV-2, and PIV-3; and RSV) and other specific viruses only targeted by the PCR techniques (CoV, EV, RV, BoV, and PIV-4). Of note, since the Luminex xTag RVP Fast Assay could not detect EV and RV separately, positive EV/RV samples by this technique were retested by the Anyplex II RV16 Assay to identify the causative virus. Performance by the mariPOC Assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions through the following steps: transfer of 0.3 mL of aspirate sample and 1.3 mL of buffer to the sample tube; 30-second vortex operation; 2-to 10-minute wait; 10-to 15-second vortex operation; 5-minute centrifugation; insertion of the sample tube in the mariPOC analyzer and automated analysis. Molecular amplification was preceded by RNA/DNA virus extraction in a MagNA Pure compact instrument (Roche Laboratories, Basel, Switzerland) using a 200-μL sample eluted in 50 μL, of which 10 μL was utilized for the RVP Fast Assay in a 96-well plate format and 8 μL for the Anyplex II RV16 Assay according in each case to the manufacturers' instructions. The 2 PCR tests included internal controls to check potential inhibitions by substances present in each specimen that could invalidate the results. In addition, the mariPOC assay also included an internal control to assess the integrity of all steps.
