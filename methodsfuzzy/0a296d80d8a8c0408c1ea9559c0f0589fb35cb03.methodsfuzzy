Samples: A total of 211 rectal swabs were collected from calves, aged 0-6 months, with mild to severe diarrhea from five industrial farms (3 dairy and 2 water buffalo) in Guangxi province, China. All samples were collected in sterile tubes containing 10 ml of 1/100 antibiotic 10 mM phosphatebuffered saline and transported on ice to our laboratory within 24 hr. Samples were homogenized by vortexing for 5 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, and then, the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80°C until assayed. Nucleic acid extraction and cDNA bank synthesis: RNA was extracted from 300 µl of the supernatant obtained from each rectal swab using the RNAiso PLUS kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Dalian, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNA was eluted in 35 µl of RNase-free H 2 O (Takara Bio, Inc.) and used for first strand cDNA bank synthesis with the PrimeScript II 1st strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Takara Bio, Inc.) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Detection of bovine astrovirus and genome cloning and sequencing: Bovine astrovirus was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis using the degenerate primer pair (forward) DPF 5′-GAYTG-GACBCGHTWTGATGG-3′ and (reverse) DPR 5′-KYT-TRACCCACATNCCAA-3′ to target a 418-bp fragment of the RdRp region common to astroviruses, as described previously [21] with some modifications. Some of the RT-PCR-positive samples were sequenced and primarily analyzed by comparison of nucleotide sequences using the online Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (http://blast.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to confirm the detection of astrovi-ruses. Subsequently, we amplified the 3′-end of ORF2 and the ORF1b/ORF2 regions, which have been confirmed by subgenomic RNA analysis for characterization of astroviruses. Since the direct amplification with gene specific primers (GSPs) failed, the Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) method was implemented to amplify the 3′-end of the ORF1b/ORF2 region. The 3′-end RACE amplification was performed as described previously [16] with the following modifications to the primer pair: QT 5′-CCAGTGAGC AGAGTGACGAGGACTCGAGCTCAAGCT (T) 16 -3′ and QO 5′-CCAGTGAGCAGAGTGACG-3′. The RACE products were reused as templates in a nested PCR performed to amplify desired sequences using GSPs designed in this study based on the B76-2/HK sequence available in the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) under the accession number HQ916317.1.The GSPs were designed using OLIGO 7 software (Molecular Biology Insights, Inc., Colorado Springs, CO, U.S.A.). The nucleotide sequences of the primer pairs used to amplify the partial 3′-end of ORF2 were as follows: (forward, B1205F and B1350F) 5′-CAG-GTCACCCCAGGCAACAC-3′ and 5′-ATCATACAGGC-GGGCACGAGT-3′, respectively, and (reverse, B1205R) 5′-CCCTTCACCTATGCTAATCAAATC-3′ (expected products length, 1,200 and 1,426 bp, respectively). The two primer pairs used to amplify the ORF1b/ORF2 region were as follows: (1) The PCR cycling conditions consisted of 95°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 52°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min in an automated thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, U.S.A.). 3′-RACE PCR and amplification of the ORF1b/ORF2 region were performed under the same conditions as for the PCR analysis described above with cycling set at 58°C as the annealing temperature for 3′RACE and 56°C as the annealing temperature for amplification of the ORF1b/ORF2 region and an elongation step at 72°C for 1 min for each 1 kb. The PCR products of expected sizes were purified and then cloned into pMD18-T plasmid vectors (Takara Bio, Inc.), which were then used to transform competent Escherichia coli Top 10 cells. The recombinant plasmids were submitted in duplicate for DNA sequencing to Invitrogen Biotech (Beijing, China). Editing and assembly of nucleotide sequences were performed using the SeqMan program included in the Lasergene 7 Genomics Suite (DNAstar, Inc., Madison, WI, U.S.A.).
