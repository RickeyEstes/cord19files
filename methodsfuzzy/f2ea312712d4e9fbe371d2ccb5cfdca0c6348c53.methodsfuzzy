During method development recovery and matrix effects were monitored. Recovery was calculated by dividing the signal of a blank poultry sample with addition of the compounds before sample clean-up (matrix-matched standard, MMS) by the signal of a blank poultry muscle sample with addition of an equivalent amount of the compounds, based upon 100% recovery, after sample clean-up (matrixmatched recovery standard, MMRS). The matrix effect As an alternative to the column-switch set-up, different single analytical columns were tested. zic-HILIC (Sequant, Umeå, Sweden) was tested in combination with gradient elution using ammonium formate in water and ACN or MeOH as the mobile phase, at a pH ranging from 3 to 10. Reversed-phase (RP) C 18 was tested in combination with gradient elution using water and ACN or MeOH as the mobile phase, at a pH ranging from 3 to 11. Hypercarb was tested in combination with gradient elution using water and ACN, MeOH or tetrahydrofuran as the mobile phase. For each chromatographic condition, the matrix effects were evaluated on the basis of spiked poultry muscle samples using only a methanolic extraction in combination with evaporation of the extraction solvent and redissolution in a suitable solvent. We aimed for a chromatographic system that results in sufficient retention for all compounds and adequate separation of the antiviral drugs from the matrix constituents to minimize matrix effects. SPE using strong cation exchange and PBA were tested for sample clean-up. A 50 μg kg −1 spiked methanolic sample extract was acidified and applied onto a Strata-X C cartridge. The breakthrough during application and washing were collected separately. These and the eluent were analysed using the LC-MS/MS system. The same procedure was followed for the PBA cartridges, but then the spiked methanolic extract was basified prior to application. A full validation was carried out according to 2002/657/EC [1] . The following parameters were determined: linearity, trueness, repeatability, within-laboratory reproducibility, decision limit (CCα), detection capability (CCβ), selectivity and robustness. The validation was carried out on three different occasions, by two different technicians, using different batches of SPE cartridges and including 21 different poultry muscle samples. An overview of the validation results is presented in Table 2 . For zanamivir, ribavirin, oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine and rimantadine the linearity in the range of 0-20 μg kg −1 is above the criterion of 0.990; the trueness is between 95 and 108% for all antiviral drugs which is well within the established criterion of 80-110%; the determined maximum RSD r and RSD RL are 14.3% and 15.2%, respectively, and thus below the criteria of 14.7% and 22%, respectively; therefore, the validation results comply with the established criteria. It is concluded that the presented method is adequate for quantitative trace analysis of these six antiviral drugs. For arbidol, inadequate linearity, trueness, repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility are observed. On two validation days, the calibration lines are adequate, but on 1 day the linearity is insufficient due to two deviating calibration points. The poor trueness, repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility of arbidol are caused by 10 out of 63 spiked samples showing a quantitative result that is 1.5-3.5 times higher than expected. This is likely to be caused by a difference in matrix interference, which plays a major role for arbidol Fig. 6 SRM chromatograms of (a) blank poultry muscle sample spiked with zanamivir and ribavirin at 10 μg kg −1 including the internal standards and (b) blank poultry muscle sample spiked with the internal standards only (Fig. 5a) . This effect might be overcome if a suitable internal standard for arbidol becomes available. However, the presented method is suitable for the qualitative analysis of arbidol. For oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, rimantadine and arbidol the calculated decision limits (CCα) vary from 0.1 to 0.6 μg kg −1 indicating that for these Fig. 7 SRM chromatograms of (a) blank poultry muscle sample spiked with oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, rimantadine, amantadine and arbidol at 2.5 μg kg −1 including the internal standards and (b) blank poultry muscle sample spiked with the internal standards only antiviral drugs very low levels are still detectable. The calculated detection capabilities (CCβ) of these compounds are between 0.5 and 2.5 μg kg −1 and samples spiked at 5 μg kg −1 were found to be non-compliant based upon the ion ratio criteria [1] in 100% of the cases (n021), indicating that the method is suitable for confirmatory analysis of these antiviral drugs at relevant levels. For zanamivir and ribavirin the calculated CCα values are 8 and 3 μg kg −1 , respectively, indicating that for these drugs relevant levels are still detectable. The calculated detection capabilities (CCβ) of zanamivir and ribavirin are 15 and 9 μg kg −1 , respectively. Even though the calculated CCβ for zanamivir exceeds 10 μg kg −1 , samples spiked at 10 μg kg −1 with zanamivir and ribavirin were found to be non-compliant based upon the ion ratio criteria [1] in 100% of the cases (n021) indicating that the calculated CCβ for at least zanamivir is slightly overestimated and that the method is suitable for confirmatory analysis of zanamivir and ribavirin at relevant levels as well. From the theoretical study hydroxyflunixin, ADD and THG were found to have the same molecular mass as one of the antiviral drugs and might theoretically interfere in the described method. Standard solutions of 100 μg L −1 of these compounds were prepared and injected into the columnswitch LC-MS/MS system. No interfering signals were observed in these chromatograms and, furthermore, no significant interferences were detected in the blank samples (n021); therefore, the procedure is considered sufficiently selective for the antiviral drugs. During the method development some critical steps were identified. Firstly the pH values of the solvents used during the SPE clean-up procedure are critical. The acidic methanol should be at pH≤2 to retain zanamivir on the Strata-X C material and the alkaline MeOH should be at least pH 12 for the elution of amantadine and rimantadine. Incorrect pH results in a severe decrease of the recovery. Secondly, it was found critical to centrifuge the basified breakthrough of the Strata-X C cartridge before applying it onto the PBA cartridge to prevent clogging. For ruggedness testing, three slight deviations to the procedure that might occur in practice were specifically tested: (1) extraction for 30 min instead of 15, (2) dry the PBA cartridges by applying vacuum for 1 min after applying the extract and after washing the cartridge and (3) evaporation of the solvent at 55°C instead of 50°C. The duplicates analysed by incorporating these deviations in the method showed good trueness and acceptable duplicates, indicating that the tested processes are robust. Application to real samples Two amantadine-affected muscle samples were analysed using the developed method. The results were 4.9 μg kg −1 for the poultry muscle and 15.3 μg kg −1 for the turkey muscle sample. These levels are in good agreement with the indicated amantadine concentration, being approximately 4 μg kg −1 for the poultry muscle and 8-25 μg kg −1 for the turkey muscle. From this it is concluded that the developed method is applicable to real muscle samples.
