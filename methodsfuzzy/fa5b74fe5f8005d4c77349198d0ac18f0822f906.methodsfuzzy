Confluent monolayers of Vero cells on 6-well plates were infected with wild-type and recombinant IBV and harvested at different time points post-infection. Viral stocks were prepared by three freeze/thaw cycles. Vero cells on 96-well plates were infected with 10-fold serial dilutions of the viral stock. Three days post-inoculation, the number of infected wells was counted, and the 50% tissue culture infection dose (TCID50) of each sample was determined by using the Reed and Muench method.
