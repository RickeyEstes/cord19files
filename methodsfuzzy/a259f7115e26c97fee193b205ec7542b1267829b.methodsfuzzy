There are several pre-processing steps involved in the reconstruction of rooted phylogenies to ensure maximum protection from biological and technical artifacts. First, taxa are sampled broadly while ensuring participation from each major group of organisms (and viruses) since increased taxon sampling is known to decrease phylogenetic error (Heath et al., 2008) . Taxa are distinguished by the "profile" distribution of molecular characters, which in this case represent abundance (i.e., reuse) of FSF domains in sampled taxa. Data matrices are then processed to remove group-specific FSFs (e.g., the large number of eukaryote-specific immunoglobulin FSFs lacking counterparts in prokaryotic and viral proteomes) and FSFs with zero abundance. These filtering steps reduce the data matrix to comprise only of universal (i.e., ABEV) FSFs to increase resolution in the deep branches of the ToL. Data matrices are then transformed and normalized to an alpha-numeric scale indicating 24 (or 32 or 64) possible character states (e.g., 0-9 and A-N) representing FSF abundances in sampled taxa. These matrices are imported into the PAUP * software for phylogeny reconstruction (Swofford, 2002) . During searches of tree space and prior to rooting, we optimize character changes in unrooted trees allowing for both increases and decreases in FSF abundance (e.g., see gains vs. loss tracings in Nasir et al., 2014b) . The resulting most parsimonious unrooted trees that are retained are then rooted using the Lundberg approach (Lundberg, 1972;  i.e., a posteriori), which still preserves the optimized topology. Thus, tree topology is established prior to rooting and theoretically cannot be distorted by genome size (see empirical data discussed below), which is a property of taxa (i.e., proteomes) and not individual characters (i.e., FSFs) changing on trees. In other words, our tree building methodology precludes the systematic SGA artifacts proposed by Harish et al. (2016) because decreasing proteome size decreases the number of contributed phylogenetic characters, not how character states change during phylogenetic reconstruction. Phylogenomic data and reconstruction methods follow Nasir and Caetano-Anollés (2015) . In brief, a census of structural domains in proteomes defined a phylogenetic data matrix of FSF reuse, which was normalized, encoded and used to build most parsimonious phylogenetic trees using PAUP * (Swofford, 2002) . Optimal trees were rooted using Weston's generality criterion implemented with the Lundberg method (Lundberg, 1972) , which polarizes character state change without specification of an outgroup or ancestor. Rogue taxa identification and TII calculations were performed using RogueNaRok (Aberer et al., 2013) . LS measurements and Explicitly Agree (EA) similarities were calculated with RadCon (Thorley and Page, 2000) . EvoPCO analysis was performed using Excel XLSTAT plugin as described in Nasir and Caetano-Anollés (2015) . Since proteomic make up involves a collective of FSFs of different ages, we use nd values of age derived from a ToD to transform an FSF occurrence (FSF use) matrix into an FSF occurrence * (1−nd) matrix. This makes it possible to study a multidimensional space of "reverse" evolutionary ages of domains without losing information of FSF of very ancient origin or introducing biases from FSF absences. Euclidean distances describing dissimilarities between proteomes were calculated and the distance matrices were used to calculate the first three principal coordinates describing maximum variability in data. These three most significant loadings described how FSF parts contributed to the history of proteome systems.
