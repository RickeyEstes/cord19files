To locate reactive proteins on a proteome chip, small molecule probes are labeled with either fluorescent, affinity, photochemical, or radioisotope tags. Fluorescent labels are generally preferred, as they are safe and effective and are compatible with readily available microarray laser scanners. However, probes can also be labeled with affinity tags or photochemical tags (Colca and Harrigan, 2004; Mitsopoulos et al., 2004) . Huang et al. (2004) used biotin labeled small molecules to probe proteome chips for small molecule inhibitors of rapamycin. The reactive proteins were identified with Cy3 labeled streptavidin. Regardless of the type of label used, there are problems associated with labeling the molecules used to probe a proteome chip. Chief among these problems is the possibility that the label itself may interfere with the probe's ability to interact with the target protein. To overcome this problem, a number of label-free detection methods have recently been developed. Label-free detection methods not only overcome the problem of steric hindrance of a label, but also allow for the collection of kinetic binding data (reviewed in Ramachandran et al., 2005) . The current leading technology for label-free detection of protein interactions is surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which probes the local index of refraction. Other choices include carbon nanotubes, carbon nanowires, and microelectromechanical systems cantilevers. While these technologies are still in their infancy and are not suitable for high-throughput protein interaction detections, they do offer much promise (Ramachandran et al., 2005) .
