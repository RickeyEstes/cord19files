In order to ensure the Markov method for contaminant transport established in the paper produces real-time or faster than realtime estimates of the contaminant transport, the computational time to compute the contaminant transport was evaluated. Each problem was simulated for 1000 Markov time steps. The Ray-leigheB enard problem took a simulation time of t U max / H ¼ 0.00864 to evolve the contaminant a total time of t U max / H ¼ 54.7. The IEA annex 20 problem took a simulation time of t U max /H ¼ 0.0315 to evolve the contaminant a total time of t U max / H ¼ 119.8. These tests used a 1.7 GHz Intel Core i7 processor. The Markov method was able to compute the contaminant transport 6665 times faster than an optimized PDE solver for the Ray-leigheB enard problem and 3723 times faster than an optimized PDE solver for the IEA annex problem. 6. Discussion: implications of using the Markov matrices for contaminant transport As the results shown in the previous section, Markov matrices provide a fast and relatively accurate method for calculating Fig. 13 . Comparisons between the minimum, ideal, and maximum time step equations (Equations (10), (11) and (15)) and the data produced by tracking particles at the center of each Markov state. The data corresponds to the particle tracking calculations, and the mesh corresponds to the mesh based equations. placement of sensors, and performing state estimation using Markov matrices. When designing an indoor airflow pattern for high IAQ, contaminants should not spend a lot of time in the occupied zone. Spectral analysis of the Markov matrix is useful to determine the long-term distribution of the contaminants and the time contaminants spend in the occupied space. In particular, the eigenvector with eigenvalue one of the Markov matrix carries information about the steady state or long-term asymptotic distribution of contaminant in the space. Similarly the other part of the spectrum of Markov matrix carry information about almost invariant region in the space where the contaminant spend most of the time before finally exiting these region [12] . Once the design of the airflow patterns is complete, sensors can be placed in the space to aid the HVAC system controls. The rows of the Markov matrix describe the probability of where the contaminants will go given a starting position, while the columns describe the origins of the contaminants at the previous time step. By finding the column with the maximum column support, a sensor placed in this column can sense the largest volume of the space [34] . Given a set of sensors that have been placed in the enclosed space, the next natural step is estimation of the contaminant field in the space at any given time. Here the linear property of the Markov matrices can be exploited to develop estimation techniques using linear system theory to determine the location or release of contaminant. All these future directions are being explored and will be the topic of subsequent publications. We are also currently working on an open source platform to distribute to the community that will enable fast calculation of the Markov matrix, perform contaminant transport, and place the sensors.
