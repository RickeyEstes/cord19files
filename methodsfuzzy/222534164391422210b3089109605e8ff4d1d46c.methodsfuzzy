Cell culture and transient transfection with pSARS-PLpro. Human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; HyClone Laboratories, Logan, Utah, USA) with 100 U/mL of penicillin and streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel). SARS-CoV PLpro gene, nt 4507-5840 of the SARS-CoV TW1 strain (GenBank accession no. AY291451) was amplified by RT-PCR, and then cloned into expression vector pcDNA3.1/ His C (Invitrogen), as described in our prior reports 12, 13 . The empty vector pcDNA3.1 or pSARS-PLpro at the concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 μ g/ml was transfected into A549 cells with Arrest-In transfection reagent (Thermo scientific). After 5-h incubation, transfected cells were maintained in DMEM medium containing 20% FBS. Transient expression of recombinant PLpro in A549 cells 2 days post transfection was analyzed using immunefluoresce staining and Western blotting with mouse polyclonal antibodies against anti-E. coli synthesized PLpro, as described in our prior reports 12,13 . Quantifying relative mRNA expression of fibrotic genes using real-time RT-PCR. To measure the expression of SARS PLpro, TGF-β 1, pro-fibrotic and pro-protein convertase genes in transfected cells or mouse lung tissues, total RNAs were extracted from transfected A549 cells with empty vector pcDNA3.1 or pSARS-PLpro 2 days post transfection using PureLink Micro-to-Midi Total RNA Purification System kit (Invitrogen). Relative mRNA levels were analyzed using two-step real time RT-PCR with SYBR Green I, as described in our prior reports 11, 12 . Primer pairs of SARS PLpro, TGF-β 1, pro-fibrotic and pro-protein convertase genes were listed in Table 1 . Quantification of specific PCR products was performed using the ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems). Relative changes in mRNA level of indicated genes were normalized relative to GAPDH mRNA. Immunofluorescence staining assay. For determining the expression of PLpro and TGF-β 1 as well as nuclear translocalization of transcription factors, A549 cells transiently transfected with pSARS-PLpro or empty vector grew on the glass coverslip in 6-well at 37 °C. After 2 days incubation, transfected cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for the other 1 h, and then incubated with specific primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, including mouse anti-SARS PLpro, rabbit anti-TGF-β 1 (Cell signaling), rabbit anti-NF-κ B p65 (Abcam), rabbit anti-Sp-1,
