We retrieved the Chinese publications related to SUC published between 2001 to 2015 in the Chinese periodical databases (WANFANG, VIP, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure). The number of publications for each year was recorded after the duplicates were removed. The topic of each paper was recorded and only those that were clinical in nature were included in the assessment of the complexity of SUC research. The complexity of SUC research was evaluated according to the methods described by Scott et al. The proportion of the total within each group was compared in every 5-year period (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) . The statistical significance of the differences between proportions was compared using a Chi-squared test where a P-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The number of SUC patients reported in each year, the clinical characteristics of these patients, the treatment and efficacy reported were recorded and analyzed.
