Cell culture and viruses. MHV-JHM, la, and 2c viruses were grown on DBT cells as described previously (Makino et cd, 1983) . Viruses from the persistent culture JHM-CC were harvested at different passage levels and propagated once on DBT cells before use. Prepurutim of vi&n RNA. 32P-labeled RNA was extracted from purified viruses by procedures described previously (Makino et r& 1983 (Makino et r& , 1984 . In some experiments, the 60 S virion RNA was obtained by separation on a 15-30s sucrose gradient in a SW50.1 rotor at 45,000 rpm for 1.5 hr. Prepurutim of intracellular viral RNA. DBT cells were inoculated with MHV-JHM at a multiplicity of 1.0. After adsorption for 1 hr at 37", cultures were incubated for 2.5 hr with Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM, Nissui, Tokyo) containing 5% dialyzed calf serum. Then, cultures were incubated with MEM containing 5% dialyzed calf serum, l/10 normal concentration of phosphate, and 2.5 pg of actinomycin D (AMD)/ml (Sigma, St. Louis, MO.) (l/lOP-medium). At 6 hr postinfection (p.i.) the culture medium was replaced with phosphate-free MEM containing 5% dialyzed calf serum, 2.5 pg of AMD, and 250 &i/ml of "P (Japan Radioisotope Association) (32P-medium). Intracellular viral RNA was extracted at 9 to 10 hr p.i. For the labeling of the intracellular RNA of the mutant viruses, la and 2c, the culture medium was replaced at 9 hr p.i. with l/lOP-medium. After 12 hr of infection, cultures were incubated with =P-medium and viral RNA was extracted at 24 hr p.i. For the extraction of intracellular viral RNA, monolayers of infected cells were chilled on ice, and washed three times with chilled phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. Then the cells were scraped by a rubber policeman and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4". The cells were lysed in NTE buffer (0.1 MNaCl, 0.01 MTris-HCl, pH '7.2, and 1 m&f EDTA) containing 0.5% NP-40. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4" to remove nuclei, the RNA was isolated from the supernatant following phenol/chloroform extractions as described previously (Makino et al, 1934) . Oligo(dT)-cellulose column chrwnuztography. Ethanol-precipitated RNA was dissolved in binding buffer (0.01 1K Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 MLiCl, 0.5% SDS, and 1 mM EDTA) and applied to an oligo(dT)cellulose (type 3, Collaborative Research) column. After washing with binding buffer, poly(A)-containing RNA was eluted with elution buffer (0.01 M Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 0.05% SDS, and 1 mM EDTA), and RNA was precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl. Agarose gel electrophoresk Analytical gel electrophoresis was conducted following denaturation of RNA with glyoxal treatment, as described previously (McMaster and Carmicheal, 1977) . Preparative gel electrophoresis in 1% ureaagarose gels was performed as described previously (Makino et aL, 1934) . Since individual intracellular viral RNA species excised from the gels were occasionally contaminated with smaller-size RNAs, the gel slices were melted at 75" and applied to a second urea-agarose gel. After the second electrophoresis, contaminating RNAs were no longer detected. The RNA was eluted from gel slices by the methods of Langridge et al. (1980) . O~igonucEeotide jingerprinting. =P-labeled and purified viral RNA was digested with ribonuclease T1 and the products were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (Makino et a& 1934) . Fragmentation of virion RNA for oligonwleotide mapping. The =P-labeled purified virion RNA was dissolved in a buffer containing 0.01 M Tris-HCI (pH 7.5) and 1 mM EDTA, and divided into four aliquots. Sodium carbonate was added to each at a final concentration of 0.05 M and then each solution was incubated at 25" for 1 min or 3 min or at 50" for 1 min or 3 min. Then the solutions were neutralized with acetic acid and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl. These alkali-degraded RNA fragments were pooled and applied to a urea-agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the gel areas containing RNA fragments of different sizes were excised and RNA was eluted, precipitated by ethanol, selected by oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography, and each sized poly(A)containing RNA was analyzed by oligonucleotide fingerprinting.
