Cells and viruses. Vero African green monkey kidney epithelial (ATCC, CCL-81) and human A549 (ATCC, CCL-185) cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (1x PSG). ZIKV strain Paraiba (Brazil, 2015) was kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Dewhurst (Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester Medical Center). The rZIKV-RGN was previously described 49 . Virus stocks were propagated in Vero cells and titrated by plaque assay as previously described 49 . Viral genome sequencing. Viral RNA was isolated from purified virions using a QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Quiagen). Deep-sequencing was conducted at the University of Rochester Genomics Research Center using Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) as previously described 49 . Construction of ZIKV infectious cDNA clones. Infectious cDNA clones pBAC-ZIKV-Paraiba, pBAC-ZIKV-Paraiba NS2A A117V and pBAC-ZIKV-RGN NS2A A117V were generated using our previously described pBAC-ZIKV-RGN infectious cDNA clone 49 . To generate the pBAC-ZIKV-Paraiba, 8 non-silent mutations in the viral coding region (prM: E143G, T196A and S231P; NS1: E940K, and A1027T; NS3: M1826T, and K2089R; NS4B: I2509T) and a single nucleotide substitution (T10561C) in the 3′ UTR (Table 1) were introduced by site-direct mutagenesis in intermediate plasmids containing ZIKV fragments ZIKV1 to ZIKV4 49 . The modified cDNA fragments were replaced in the pBAC-ZIKV-RGN using selected restriction sites 49 . Additional silent nucleotide mutations were introduced in order to generate a BsrB I (position 2,921 A to G) and Sap I (position 3,167 A to G; 3,171 T to A; and 3,172 C to G) restriction sites as genetic markers. To generate pBAC-ZIKV-Paraiba NS2A A117V and pBAC-ZIKV-RGN NS2A A117V, a single amino acid change (A117V) at NS2A was introduce in the pBAC-ZIKV-Paraiba and pBAC-ZIKV-RGN, respectively. All plasmid constructs were confirmed by sequencing (ACGT, Inc.), propagated in DH10B E. coli (Gibco/BRL), and prepared using the Qiagen large-construct kit (Qiagen Inc.) following the manufacturer's specifications. Primers sequences for the construction of the different plasmids are available under request.
