Data used in this retrospective study were retrieved from the Thomson Reuters Web of Science, the online version of the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) on 11 December 2013. The database was searched under the keywords "pluripotent stem cell" and "pluripotent stem cells" in terms of topic (title, abstract, author keywords, and KeyWords Plus) within the publication year with a limit of 1991 to 2012. KeyWords Plus supplied additional search terms extracted from the titles of articles cited by authors in their bibliographies and footnotes in the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI; now Thomson Reuters, New York) database, and substantially augmented title-word and author-keyword indexing (23) . Non-article-type documents such as reviews, meeting abstracts, editorial materials, proceedings papers, letters, book chapters, news items, corrections, and notes were excluded. The final filter was the front page, in which only the articles having the search keywords in their first page including article title, abstract, and author keywords were retained (24) . The impact factor of a journal was based on the Journal Citation Report 2012. The number of citations of an article in a single year, for example 2012, was referred to as the C2012 and the total number of citations since publication to 2012 was referred to as the TC2012 (25, 26) . The collaboration type was determined by the addresses of the authors. Collaboration could be classified as either a single-country article, in which all authors' addresses were from the same country, or an international collaborative article, which was co-authored by researchers from multiple countries (27) . The records were downloaded and reorganized using Microsoft Excel 2010. In the SCI-EXPANDED database, the corresponding author was designated as the "reprint" author; this study instead used the term "corresponding author". In a single author article where authorship was unspecified, the single author was both first author and corresponding author. Similarly, for a single institution article, the institution was classified as the first author's institution and the corresponding author's institution. Affiliations in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales were reclassified as being from the United Kingdom (UK) (27) . Affiliations in Czechoslovakia were checked to be in Czech Republic and Slovakia. Affiliations in Hong Kong before 1997 were included with China (24) .
