Cells and infection protocol. Drosophila S2 cells were grown at 28 8C in Gibco Drosophila serum-free media (SFM). Cells were dislodged by gentle scraping, pelleted, and resuspended at 10 7 cells/ml. FHV was added at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for all experiments. The cells and virus were incubated at 26 8C on a rotary shaker at 1,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 1 h to let the virus attach. After the hour incubation, the cells were plated onto a tissue culture dish and further incubated at 28 8C. Mitochondria isolation. Mitochondria were isolated from Drosophila cells as described by Echalier [77] . Briefly, cells were recovered by scraping and centrifugation and resuspended in a hypotonic buffer that contained 20 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES; pH 7.4), 1 mM EGTA, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (1 mM phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride, 5 lg/ml pepstatin A, 1 lg/ml chymostatin, 10 mM benzamidine, 10 lg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 lg/ml bestatin). After a 10 min incubation at room temperature, an equal volume of double isotonic buffer was added that consisted of the hypotonic buffer plus 0.5 M mannitol. The cells were lysed for 7 min using a pre-chilled Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer fitted with a Teflon pestle (Kimble-Kontes; www.kimble-kontes.com/) and attached to a stirrer motor spinning at 250 rpm. The lysate was transferred to a Dounce homogenizer fitted with a type B glass pestle (Kimble-Kontes) and disrupted manually for 100 strokes on ice. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by two 10 min centrifugation steps at 500g at 4 8C. Mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation at 3700g for 10 min at 4 8C, resuspended in an isotonic buffer containing 0.25 M mannitol, and washed by a second centrifugation at 7000g. BrUTP incorporation on the isolated mitochondria was performed at 28 8C for 1 h as described previously [15] . BrUTP transfection. Drosophila cells were infected with FHV as above. At 8 hpi, cells were treated with 20 lg/ml actinomycin D for 30 min. FuGENE 6 (Roche; http://www.roche.com) was diluted 10-fold in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 and mixed with BrUTP and actinomycin D to final concentrations of 10 mM and 20 lg/ml, respectively. The FuGENE/BrUTP/actinomycin D mix was incubated for 15 min at room temperature then added to the cells and incubated at 4 8C for 15 min. After the 4 8C incubation, the cells were moved to 28 8C for a 15-min labeling period and then immediately fixed and processed for EM. Monoclonal antibody. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against FHV protein A have been described previously [9] . MAb clone 2-1.1.2.4.8, which recognizes the protein A epitope between amino acids 230 and 399, was used for immunogold EM labeling. Immunogold EM labeling . BrUTP immunolabeling fixation was performed as described previously [15] , except that samples were embedded in LR Gold resin. Samples were sectioned and placed on nickel grids. Sections were blocked with a goat-blocking solution (Aurion; http://www.aurion.nl), and incubated for 1 h with an anti-BrU antibody (PRB-1; Molecular Probes; http://probes.invitrogen. com), diluted 1:100 in an incubation solution containing 100 mM phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 and 0.1% BSA-c (Aurion). Grids were washed six times in incubation solution without antibody, then incubated for 2 h with a goat-anti-mouse antibody conjugated to an ultrasmall gold particle (Aurion) that was diluted 1:100 in incubation solution, and washed six times again with incubation solution. Silver enhancement was performed for 30 min using R-GENT SE-EM (Aurion). Protein A immunogold EM was performed in the same manner using the mouse monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:100. Background labeling was determined using uninfected control cells. Labeling density was determined by calculating the surface area of spherules, mitochondria, and cytoplasm using the point-hit method [78] . Specific labeling was determined by subtracting the background labeling density. Northern blot analysis and quantitation of FHV RNA. Northern blotting was done as described previously [8] . The number of molecules of FHV RNAs was determined by comparison with a serial dilution of a known amount of in vitro transcripts representing a known amount of (þ)RNA or (À)RNA molecules. RNA levels were quantitated with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics; http:// www.mdyn.com/). Western blot analysis and quantitation of FHV protein A. Western blotting was done as described previously [8] . The number of molecules of protein A was determined by comparison with a purified protein A standard. To generate the standard for quantitation, protein A was expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously [8] . To purify protein A, the hydrophobic transmembrane domain of protein A was deleted (amino acids 8-89), replaced with a C-terminal His 6 tag, and purified by talon column (Clontech; http://www. clontech.com) affinity chromatography. To further purify protein A, we performed preparative electrophoresis using a BioRad miniprep cell. A 6%, 9.5-cm gel was run at 200 V for 9 h with an elution speed of 150 ll/min. Fractions containing the purified, truncated protein A standard were collected and quantitated based on comparison with known standards of bovine serum albumin and bgalactosidase. We quantitated protein levels with Lumi-imager software (Roche). EM. For conventional transmission EM, cells were fixed and embedded as previously described [8] . For electron tomography, cells were fixed in 2% parafomaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide with 0.8% potassium ferrocyanide in sodium cacodylate buffer, stained with 2% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in Durcupan ACM resin. To calculate the total number of FHV-induced mitochondrial spherules per cell, FHV-infected Drosophila S2 cells were collected at 12 hpi, processed for transmission EM, and sectioned into 70-nmthick slices. For each of 25 randomly selected cells imaged in these sections, we then counted all observable spherules with diameters larger than 20 nm. The number of spherules counted for each cell then was divided by the relevant section volume, which was calculated by measuring the cell area using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) and multiplying by the effective section thickness. The effective section thickness is a correction used to avoid overcounting spherules with centers outside of the 70-nm physical section, which would otherwise be counted twice if adjacent sections were analyzed. As previously used to calculate synaptic vesicles per cell [79] , this effective section thickness is the thickness that would encompass the centers of all counted spherules. In this case, the effective section thickness was 116 nm, based on adding 23 nm (the distance from the spherule center to a radius-perpendicular plane bisecting the spherule to yield a 20-nm-diameter section) to each face of the 70nm section. The number of spherules per cell was calculated by multiplying the resulting density of spherules by the average volume of the almost perfectly round, 10 lm-diameter Drosophila S2 cells [56] (and our independent, matching measurements). EMT. Three separate FHV infections produced samples for six independent tomograms. To survey the preservation quality and FHV-infection efficiency of the Drosophila cells, thin-sectioned material (;80 nm thick) was examined using a JEOL 1200FX electron microscope. 3-D reconstructions of portions of the cell containing FHV-infected mitochondria were generated using current techniques of electron tomography [80] . Sections were cut with a thickness of ;250 nm from blocks exhibiting well-preserved ultrastructure. These sections were stained for 30 min in 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, followed by 30 min in lead salts. Fiducial cues consisting of 20-nm colloidal gold particles were deposited on both sides of the section. For each reconstruction, a series of images was collected with a JEOL 4000EX intermediate-voltage electron microscope operated at 400 kV. The specimens were irradiated before initiating a tilt series in order to limit anisotropic specimen thinning during image collection. Pre-irradiation in this manner subjected the specimen to the steepest portion of the nonlinear shrinkage profile before images were collected. Six tilt series were collected: five single-tilt and one doubletilt. ''FHV2'' was the highest resolution single-tilt reconstruction and ''FHV6'' was the high-resolution double-tilt reconstruction; the majority of the analyses were conducted on these two reconstructions. The single-tilt series were recorded at 40,000 magnification with an angular increment of 2 8 from À60 8 to þ60 8 about an axis perpendicular to the optical axis of the microscope using a computer-controlled goniometer to increment accurately the angular steps. These single-axis tilt series were collected using a CCD camera with pixel dimensions 1,960 3 2,560. The pixel resolution was 0.55 nm. The illumination was held to near parallel beam conditions and optical density maintained constant by varying the exposure time. The IMOD package was used for generating the reconstructions [81] . Double-tilt tomography was performed by first collecting two tilt series of the same cellular region around orthogonal axes. After the first tilt series was complete using an angular increment of 2 8 from À66 8 to þ66 8, the specimen grid was rotated 90 8, and the second tilt series was acquired from À60 8 to þ66 8. The IMOD software suite was used for fiducial mark tracking and alignment. The positions of 30 gold particles were tracked in both tilt series. After alignment, the tomographic reconstruction was generated by a projective algorithm [82] . Volume segmentation was performed by manual tracing in the planes of highest resolution with the program Xvoxtrace [83] . The mitochondrial reconstructions were visualized using Analyze (Mayo Foundation, Rochester, MN, United States), ImageJ (National Institutes of Health), or the surface-rendering graphics of Synu (National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research, San Diego, CA, United States) as described by Perkins et al. 2001 [84] . These programs allow one to step through slices of the reconstruction in any orientation and to track or model features of interest in three dimensions. Measurements of structural features were made from planes within the reconstructed volume with the program ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) or within segmented volumes by the programs Synuarea and Synuvolume (National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research). Some 3-D maps, images, and videos were created using the software Amira (Mercury TGS; http://www.tgs. com).
