Mice and virus strains C57BL/6, C57BL/6 CD45.1 + , C57BL/6 CD90.1 + D b GP 33-41 TCR tg (P14), C57BL/6 CD90.1 + GP 66-77 TCR tg (SMARTA), Ebi3 −/− (Jackson Laboratory; stock 008701), Il12a −/− (Jackson Laboratory; stock 2692), Il12b −/− (Jackson Laboratory; stock 2693), Il27ra −/− (Jackson Laboratory; stock 018078; Yoshida et al., 2001) , Il6 −/− (Jackson Laboratory; stock 002650), Irf1 −/− (Jackson Laboratory; stock 002762), Stat1 −/− (Jackson Laboratory stock; 012606), and Stat2 −/− (Jackson Laboratory stock; 023309) mice were from the Jackson Laboratory. Il27ra −/− P14 CD90.1 + , Irf1 −/− P14 CD45.2 + , and Stat1 −/− CD90.1 + P14 mice were generated by mating the single-allele mice described above. All mice were bred and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions. For virus infection, LCMV Cl13 was injected by the intravenous route at a dose of 2 × 10 6 PFU per mouse. For quantification of viremia, blood was drawn from the retroorbital sinus under isoflurane anesthesia. Serum was isolated by low-speed centrifugation to remove red and white blood cells. 10 µl of serum was used to perform 10-fold serial dilutions and quantified by focus forming assay on VeroE6 cells as previously described (Battegay et al., 1991) . Tissues (spleen, lung, liver, and kidney) were harvested from euthanized mice and frozen at −80°C. At the time of the assay, tissues were thawed, weighed, homogenized in medium to 10% wt/vol, and clarified by low-speed centrifugation. 10 µl of the supernatant was used to quantify viral titers in a focusforming assay. All mice were used in accordance with guidelines from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Scripps Research Institute. Mixed bone marrow chimeras CD45.1 + mice were irradiated with two rounds of 450 cGy with a 3-h interval. Bone marrow from Il27ra +/+ (CD45.1 + ) and Il27ra −/− (CD45.2 + ) was subjected to lysis of red blood cells and was depleted of T cells by biotin-CD4 (clone GK1.5; BioLegend), biotin-CD8a (clone 53-6.7; BioLegend) antibodies, and Anti-Biotin MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Bone marrow cells were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 (2 × 10 6 cells for each genotype) and were transferred by injection intravenously. 2 mo later, recipient mice were treated with isotype control or aIFNAR1 antibody, then infected with LCMV Cl13. An equivalent procedure was followed to generate mixed chimeras using Irf1 −/− CD45.2 + and WT CD45.2 + bone marrow.
