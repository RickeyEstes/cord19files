According to the epidemic data before Feb.1,2020,it indicated that the probability from the exposed to the infected was 1.7%, 13,14 and the average incubation period was 7 days,and the average hospital stay was 14 days. 15, 16 The average daily contact rate of the infected was 6,referring to the statistical data from CCDC in the early stage of SARS epidemic in 2003. 17,18, 19 However,the population density in Hubei Province was 2.3 times the national average, so the daily contact rate in Hubei was 13.8,and the average daily contact rate of the latent was twice as the infected.The calculation method was R0 = average daily contact rate× probability of the exposed to the infected ×infection period. The average infection period was 21 days. Therefore, R0 was 4.9-9.9 in Hubei,but 2. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

It can be probably avoided the pandemic of global cases rise with the great efforts by Chinese government and its people. 26,27
