This study follows the autoregressive conditional jump intensity model by Chan and Maheu (2002) , which postulates that the jump intensity obeys an ARMA process and incorporates the GARCH effect of returns series. Given the set of returns at time t − 1 and the two stochastic innovations, ε 1,t and ε 2,t , the time-series model of returns can be expressed as follows: where ε 1,t is a mean-zero innovation with a normal stochastic process, and is assumed to be where ε 2,t denotes a jump innovation assigned to be a conditional zero-mean value, and conditionally mean zero. ε 1,t is contemporaneously independent of ε 2,t . Ebs t and UEbs t denote expected and unexpected net purchases of foreign investors, respectively. From Eq. (1) it is realized that this equation shows that the returns series includes a normal stochastic process and a jump stochastic process that is characterized by a Poisson distribution with a time-varying conditional intensity parameter, t . The Poisson distribution with parameter t that is conditional upon˝t −1 is assumed to describe the arrival of a discrete number of jumps, where n t ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . .} over the interval [t − 1, t]. The conditional density of n t is as follows: The conditional jump intensity t is the expected number of jumps conditional upon the information set˝t −1 , which is parameterized as t is related to the conditional jump intensity and t−1 which is defined as where P(n t−1 = j|˝t −1 ), called the filter, is the ex post inference on n t−1 given the information set˝t −1 , and E[n t−1 |˝t −1 ] is the ex post judgment of the expected number of jumps from t − 2 to t − 1 and t−1 is the conditional expectation of n − 1 given the information set˝t −2 . Therefore, t−1 represents the change in the conditional forecast of n t−1 by the econometrician as the information set is updated. From this definition, t is a martingale difference sequence with respect to information set˝t −1 . Therefore Consequently, the intensity residuals in a specified model should not exhibit any autocorrelation. Hence, the GARCH-ARJI model can be rewritten as follows: where t > 0, and 0 > 0, ≥ , ≥ 0. The jump size, t,k , is assumed to be independently drawn from a normal distribution. The jump-size distribution is and the jump component influencing returns from t − 1 to t is Therefore, the jump innovation associated with period t is expressed as The conditional variance of returns is decomposed into two components: a smoothly developing conditional variance component related to the diffusion of past news impacts and the conditional variance component associated with the heterogeneous information arrival process which generates jumps. The conditional variance of returns is The likelihood function is constructed as follows. The conditional density of returns is normal distributed and j jumps are normally distributed as Furthermore, Maheu and McCurdy (2004) propose and provide an ex post distribution for the number of jumps, n t . The filter is contracted as After integrating out all jumps during a 1-unit interval, the conditional probability density function may be expressed as ( 1 3 ) Therefore, the likelihood function can be expressed as where = ( , i , ω,˛j,ˇi, Â, ı, 0 , , ).
