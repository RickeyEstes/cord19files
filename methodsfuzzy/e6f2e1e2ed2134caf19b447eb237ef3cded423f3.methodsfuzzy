Study One uses time-series monthly data to try to detect and estimate the impact of a range of crisis events on the tourist flows from China to Japan and South Korea respectively in the period of 2005-2017. The monthly data on the number of Chinese tourists to Japan were obtained from the official website of the Japan Government Tourism Bureau. The monthly data on the number of Chinese travelers to ROK were obtained from the official website of the Korea Tourism Agency. Due to the unavailability of data prior to Year 2005, the research period of this paper is set from 2005 to 2017. Visitor arrival data are used to detect (discriminate) crisis events that have statistically significant impact on tourist demand and estimate the duration and severity of these events. This will assist accurate clustering and efficient indexing of ARIMA time series. The specific research method is the Time Series Regression with ARIMA Noise, Missing values and outliers (TRAMO) and Signal Extraction in ARIMA Time Series (SEATS). The methods were developed by Caporello and Maravall in 1996 and have been widely used by institutions such as US Census Bureau and Eurostat (Koc & Altinay, 2007) . The general estimation follows three steps. The first analysis stage is to follow the conventional approach to pre-process and decompose the time series (Koc & Altinay, 2007) . Specifically, TRAMO preprocesses the time series data, then passes the result to SEATS, and uses SEATS to decompose the time series into the following two models: Additive model: Y = TC + S + I (1) Multiplicative model: Y = TC × S × I Where: Y represents a time series; TC represents a long-term trend-cycle element of a time series, which is a long-term feature of a period of several years. S represents the seasonal element, which is a cyclical change that occurs repeatedly every year. The period is 12 months or 4 quarters, and I represents irregular elements. The second stage is the identification of outliers. Among them, the LS (Level Shift) outlier indicates that a crisis event has the greatest influence on the time series with the longest impact duration, which often affects the trend -cyclic component, and has a fundamental and lasting impact on the business activities of the tourist destination. However, it does not affect the irregular factors and seasonal factors in the sequence decomposition. The TC (Temporary Change) outliers represent the impact of a crisis event inferior to the LS outliers. The TC outliers do not affect the trend-cycle components, often affecting only the irregular components. In addition, the AO (Additive Outlier) outliers caused by a crisis event often only affect the irregular factors, but the impact period is very short. It often appears as a single jump point in the time series, because its influence level will not disturb the normal operation of the tourist destination. Study One aims to determine the crisis events affecting Chinese outbound travels based on the types of outliers extracted from the seasonal adjustment model. In the estimation, Level Shift (LS) and temporary outlier (TC) are analyzed but AO outliers were excluded. In the third analysis stage, point estimation and interval estimation are performed. The estimated value is added or multiplied to the corresponding unaffected component to obtain an estimated range of the natural trend curve. The loss estimate is performed accordingly. When an outlier is TC, the impact of a crisis is attributable to the irregular factors and has no effect on the trend and the seasonality. Therefore, an irregularity factor is checked to determine if it has a normal characteristic, and the interval is estimated for each month of the year in which the crisis has not occurred. This interval is the normal variation range of the irregular factor without the crisis event. Add or multiply this interval to the trend and seasonal data to get the interval estimate of the background line, If an outlier is LS, the impact comes down to the trend factor, and has no effect on the seasonal and irregular factors. Therefore, there is a need to re-estimate trends that are not affected by crisis events. The pre-crisis data are usually used to predict the trend at the time of crisis, and then the background is determined according to the seasonal adjustment model and irregular seasonal factors. During the computation, data with an average loss rate of less than 5% are excluded from the impact period. The "nbdemetra" software developed by the European Union Statistics Center was used for the computation. In order to investigate what factors generate a higher degree of crisis events' adverse impact on tourism demand and what factors help the tourism industry recover and grow after the crisis events, a qualitative method is deemed appropriate. Study 2 utilizes a qualitative method (individual and small group interviews) to report insiders' (in this case Chinese tour operator and tourism experts) views on factors intensifying or alleviating negative impacts and factors for recovery and post-events growth. Individual and small group interviews are appropriate in such a context as this gathers relevant information and provides insights and suggests solutions. Tour operators and tour leaders are interviewees, as they play a key role as tourism product developers, destination marketers, and on-site managers in the context of Chinese outbound tourism. They understand and direct the pulse of the market. Interviews were semi-structured with an interview guide to ensure that important topical areas were covered in the discussions. The main topical areas include: 1) Chinese tourists flows to Japan and South Korea and their own business operations prior, during and post various crisis events during the time period, 2) the destination market and product characteristics (i.e., Japan and South Korea), 3) tourism enterprise operating model in the tourism generating region (i.e., China), 4) other factors influencing the impact of the crisis events on the tourism businesses in generating and destination regions. Interviewees were recruited using a personal referral system. Altogether nine operators from six leading tour companies based in Guangzhou participated in the interviews. These six tour companies are among the top 15 tour enterprises nationwide in terms of business turnover, involving both wholesale and retail of tour products via online and offline mechanism. The informants were either directors of Japan and South Korea markets or the general managers of the tour companies. All interviews were conducted in the meeting rooms of the tour companies. Group interviews lasted about one and a half hour each and individual interviews lasted about 1 h each. The researcher conducted all interviews. Interview materials were transcribed and analyzed using content analysis method. Analyses were conducted using the original Chinese dialogue and quotations were translated into English for reporting purposes.
