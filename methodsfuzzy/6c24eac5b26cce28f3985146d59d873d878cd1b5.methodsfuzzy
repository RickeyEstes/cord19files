Performance of each assay was determined against a composite reference standard (Gharabaghi et al., 2011) . A positive result from all 3 methods or from culture or from both RV15 and AdvanSure™ was considered to be a true positive. A negative result from all 3 methods was considered to be a true negative. In the case of a positive result from only 1 of 2 PCR assays, the confirmatory test was as follows: A positive result from only RV15 was confirmed with RV16 (Seegene). A positive result from only RV15 with a negative result from RV16 was considered to be a false positive. A positive result from AdvanSure only was confirmed with RV16. In case of a positive result from AdvanSure only with a negative result from RV16, another confirmatory test, singleplex PCR and sequencing, was performed. The main outcomes of this study were sensitivities and specificities of culture, AdvanSure™, and RV 15 assay. Because culture cannot detect human rhinovirus (HRV), MPV, coronavirus, and bocavirus, we excluded HRV, MPV, coronavirus, and bocavirus results from the sensitivity analysis of culture. Specificity was calculated as the percentage of the number of target virus-negative specimens by each assay against the number of target virus-negative specimens by composite reference standard. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 20.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
