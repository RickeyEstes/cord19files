Collection of field samples. Samples were collected from guinea fowls showing enteritis and concomitant high mortality (Ͼ10%) in flocks in five regions in France (Bretagne, Pays de Loire, Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Occitanie, and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes) from February 2014 through November 2016. Gastrointestinal content was collected and stored at Ϫ80°C for viral RNA isolation. Tissues (duodenum, pancreas, air sac, lung, small intestine, large intestine, kidney, cloaca, trachea, and bursa) were collected during necropsy of euthanized or deceased animals in routine diagnostics by local veterinarians, fixed for 24 h in 4% (mass/vol) buffered formaldehyde, and stored in 70% ethanol. Immunohistochemistry. Paraffin-embedded tissues were sliced at 4 m, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in an ethanol gradient from 100% to 70%. Antigen retrieval was carried out in Tris-EDTA, pH 9.0 (preheated), before application of 1% H 2 O 2 in methanol. After two washes in normal antibody diluent (Immunologic), the monoclonal antibody (MAb) mouse anti-IBV M protein 25.1 (Prionics, Lelystad, The Netherlands), cross-reacting with TCoV and GfCoV (5), was applied for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-0.1% Tween, and an EnVision kit (catalog no. K4001; Dako) was used for anti-mouse secondary antibody staining according to the manufacturer's protocol. Slides were washed three times in PBS, and viral M protein presence was visualized with aminoethylcarbazole (AEC). The tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with AquaMount (Merck). Molecular characterization of GfCoV. The gastrointestinal content collected from affected guinea fowl was clarified by centrifugation (30 s at 11,000 ϫ g), and RNA was extracted using a Qiagen Viral RNA extraction kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer. A one-step real-time RT-PCR targeting the avian coronavirus N gene was carried out to confirm the presence of coronavirus RNA as previously described (13) . Subsequently, the isolated RNA was reverse transcribed using a Revertaid kit with random hexamers (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA), and overlapping conventional PCRs were performed to amplify the guinea fowl S gene (primer sequences available upon request). Sanger sequencing of the resulting fragments was performed using PCR primers. Contigs were generated with BioEdit (version 7.0.8.0) (25) and submitted to NCBI. MUSCLE (26) was used for the alignment, and MEGA (version 6.06) was used with a bootstrap value of 1,000 for the phylogeny (27) . Selective pressure was calculated as dN/dS, and the hypothesis dN ϭ dS was tested using the Pamilo-Bianchi-Li method (28), with a P value of Ͻ0.05 considered statistically significant. Construction of the expression vector. The codon-optimized sequence for GfCoV/2014 S1 (␥CoV/ AvCoV/guinea fowl/France/14032/2014), containing upstream NheI and downstream PacI restriction sites, was obtained from GenScript and cloned into the pCD5 expression vector by restriction digestion, as previously described (29) . The S1 sequence is in frame with a C-terminal GCN4 trimerization motif and Strep-tag. The expression vector encoding GfCoV/2011 S1 was generated previously (29) . Production of recombinant proteins. Recombinant S1 proteins were expressed by transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells with pCD5 expression vectors using polyethylenimine (PEI) at a 1:12 (wt/wt) ratio. Cell culture supernatants were harvested after 6 days. The recombinant proteins were purified using Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads as previously described (29) . ELISA. Gal␤1,4GlcNAc␤1,3Gal␤1,4GlcNAc (Consortium for Functional Glycomics) was coated in a 96-well Nunc MaxiSorp plate (Sigma-Aldrich) at 0.5 g/well overnight at 4°C, followed by blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) in PBS-0.1% Tween. S1 proteins were preincubated with Strep-Tactin-horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) (1:200) for 30 min on ice. For each protein, 2-fold dilutions were made in triplicate in PBS and applied onto the coated well, followed by incubation for 2 h at room temperature. TMB (3,3=,5,5=-tetramethylbenzidine; Thermo Scientific) substrate was used to visualize binding, after which the reaction was terminated using 1 M H 2 SO 4 . The optical density at 450 nm (OD 450 ) was measured in a FLUOstar Omega instrument (BMG Labtech), and MARS data analysis software was used for data analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Glycan array. Glycan structures were printed in six replicates on glass slides (Nexterion Slide H; Schott Inc.). Prelabeled S1 proteins with Alexa Fluor 647-linked anti-Strep-tag mouse antibody and with Alexa Fluor 647-linked anti-mouse IgG (4:2:1 molar ratio) were applied to the slides (concentrations are given in figure legends) and incubated for 90 min, after which the slides were washed with PBS and deionized water, dried, and imaged immediately. As controls different lectins were applied: Erythrina crista-galli agglutinin (ECA), which is specific for glycans with terminal galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, or lactose, and Sambuca nigra agglutinin (SNA) and Maackia Amurensis lectin I (MAL1), which are specific for alpha-2,6-linked and alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids attached to terminal galactose, respectively. Of the six replicates, the highest and lowest values were removed, and of the remaining four replicates, the total signal values and standard deviations (SD) were calculated and plotted in bar graphs or heat maps. Spike histochemistry. Spike histochemistry was performed as previously described (29) . S1 proteins precomplexed with Strep-Tactin-HRPO were applied onto 4-m sections of formalin-fixed paraffinembedded healthy guinea fowl tissues, and binding was visualized using 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole (AEC; Sigma-Aldrich). Proteins were applied onto slides at 5 g/ml. Where indicated (on Fig. 6 , its legend, and the text), the tissues were treated per slide with 40 U ␤-galactosidase (␤-Gal) (Megazyme, USA) or 2 mU of neuraminidase (sialidase) from Arthrobacter ureafaciens (AUNA) (Sigma, Germany) in 10 mM potassium acetate and 2.5 mg/ml Triton X-100, pH 4.2, and incubated at 40°C overnight (O/N) before protein application. Lectin histochemistry. Lectin histochemistry was performed as previously described (4) . Biotinylated Erythrina crista-galli lectin or biotinylated Sambucus nigra lectin (both from Vector Laboratories) were diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 2 g/ml (ECA) or 6 g/ml (SNA) and applied to healthy guinea fowl tissue sections for 30 min. After samples were washed with PBS, the signal was visualized by an avidin-biotin complex (ABC kit; Vector Laboratories) and counterstained with hematoxylin. Data availability. Contigs are available in GenBank under accession numbers MG765535 to MG765542 and accession numbers MK290733 and MK290734.
