In order to improve the concentration of bioactive compounds in the acetone extract, cottonseed oil sludge was used as the raw material, instead of cottonseed. It was purchased from Jingyang Sanqu oil factory in shaanxi province. TMV isolates were provided by the State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas, Northwest A&F University in the form of virus infected plants of Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. K326. Nicotiana glutinosa was used as a local lesion host and cultivated in the insect-free greenhouse at 23-25Â°C. The experiments could be conducted when the plants grow to 5-6 leaves (about 8 weeks old). For the field trials, Rice (Oryza sativa L.) infected with RSV and SRBSDV all the year around was used to test the antiviral activities of the acetone extract. The experiment was carried out in most of the main rice producing regions in China ( Table 1) .
