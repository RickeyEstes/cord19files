We sequenced a 1.8 kb segment of genome DNA upstream of the first exon of CXCL-10 and sequence variants were identified among 24 healthy individuals. Tagging SNPs were then identified by Haploview program which captures genetic variation by R 2 N 0.8. To test whether CXCL-10 promoter polymorphisms might contribute to human TB susceptibility, the genotype frequencies of the three tagging SNPs in CXCL-10 promoter (− 1447A N G, − 872G NA, − 135G N A) were examined in 240 TB patients and 176 Chinese cord blood control population.
