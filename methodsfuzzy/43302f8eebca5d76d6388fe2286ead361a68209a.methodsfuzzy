(fPLI) are useful markers of intestinal and pancreatic disease, [14] [15] [16] [17] but it is important to note that they typically do not give a precise diagnosis. Cobalamin and folate are water-soluble vitamins and are readily found in commercial cat foods so that dietary insufficiency is rare, and decreased levels are almost always because of GI disease. These vitamins are taken up by specific receptors in different areas of the small intestine. Chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease may damage the receptors and lead to decreased serum concentrations of one or both vitamins, provided the disease process is severe and long standing enough to deplete body stores. Serum cobalamin and folate concentrations may also be decreased in cats with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Trypsin-like immunoreactivity is a pancreasspecific marker, and assessment of serum TLI is used for diagnosis of EPI and pancreatitis in the cat, although the sensitivity of the assay for pancreatitis is low. PLI is a marker for pancreatic inflammation and is more sensitive than TLI for the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Since inflammation of the small intestine may be seen concurrently with pancreatitis, serum TLI and PLI are useful adjunctive tests in the diagnosis of diarrhea. TLI, PLI, and cobalamin are stable in serum at room temperature for several days, but folate is unstable so that samples for cobalamin/folate analysis should be frozen (Table 23-14) . Samples submitted for folate concentration should not be hemolyzed, because red blood cells contain high levels of folate. In addition, folate is light-sensitive, and samples should be wrapped to exclude light. Severe lipemia may interfere with common assays for TLI and PLI. The main utility of these tests are
