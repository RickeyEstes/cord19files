Virus and cell line. SARS-CoV virus isolate WHU was used in this experiment, which was isolated from a SARS patient who died of SARS and the virus genome was confirmed by sequencing (GenBank Accession No. AY394850). The virus causes typical cytopathic effect (CPE) on Vero E6 cell monolayer. Vero E6 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Rockville, MD) and maintained in DMEM (Sigma) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma). Gene construction. As shown in Fig. 1 , SARS-CoV S protein is a typical type I membrane protein. The HR1 and HR2 regions were predicted using the computer program LearnCoil-VMF (http://nightingale.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/vmf) [30] . The HR1 region covers amino acids 898-1005, whereas the HR2 includes the amino acids 1149-1186 ( Fig. 1 ). The polypeptides were then engineered in vitro and expressed in E. coli. The HR1 was expressed as an N-terminal his-tagged protein As the basic amino acid cluster required for S1/S2 cleavage is not present it is unlikely that SARS-CoV S protein would be processed further into S1 and S2. However, the positions of the putative S1 and S2 are indicated for the convenience to compare with other coronaviruses. "SS" represents signal sequence and "TM" for transmembrane domain. In the lower panel, likelihood of HR1 and HR2 predicted by LearnCoil-VMF program [30] is shown. in pET30a vector (Novagen) and HR2 (two versions) was expressed as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. A peptide corresponding to amino acids 1149-1186 (HR2-38) was also synthesized (Sigma-Genosys, UK). For construct making, His-HR1 construct was cloned into pET30a vector with BamHI and XhoI, thereof resulting in 50 extra amino acids at the N-terminus of the HR1 (same strategy as Wang et al. [31] ). GST fusion HR2 constructs (HR2-38 and HR2-44) were cloned into pGEX-6p-1 (Pharmacia) with unique restriction enzyme sites BamHI and NotI (same strategy as Yu et al. [32] ). There were two versions of GST-HR2, i.e., GST-HR2-38 and GST-HR2-44. For the latter, there were 6 extra amino acids after the predicted position at the C-terminus from the S gene (amino acids 1149-1192). Cloned constructs were verified by direct DNA sequencing. Protein expression and purification. All the relevant positive expression vectors (30a-HR1, GST-HR2-38, and GST-HR2-44) were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) competent cells and single colony was inoculated into 2 Â YT medium containing 100 lg/ml ampicillin at 37°C for overnight culture. Then the overnight culture was transferred to new 2 Â YT medium for large-scale protein production by growing at 37°C. When the culture density (OD 600 ) reached 0.8, the culture was induced with 0.2 mM IPTG and grown for an additional 5 h at 25°C before the cells were harvested. The harvested culture was centrifuged and the bacterial cell pellet was re-suspended in PBS and homogenized by sonication. Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 1%, and the lysate was incubated for 30 min on ice and was subsequently clarified by centrifugation at 12,000g for 15 min at 4°C. Then the supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Pharmacia) or Ni-chelated Sepharose affinity column (Pharmacia). The protein-loaded column was then washed with 3Â column volume of PBS. After that, for GSTfusion protein, the protein was eluted with 10 mM reduced glutathione. For the GST-removed proteins, the GST-3C rhinovirus protease (kindly provided by Drs. J. Heath and K. Hudson) was added into the resin to cleave the GST and the fused target protein and the mixture was incubated with gentle agitation for about 10 h at 4°C. The target protein was eluted with 10 ml PBS. For the His-tagged HR1, the protein was eluted with 100 mM imidazole. HR1-HR2 complex assembly and gel-filtration analysis. Equal molar purified His (30a)-HR1 and GST-removed HR2 were mixed at room temperature for 1 h. The mixture was then loaded onto a Superdex G200 column (Pharmacia). One single peak (60-70 kDa) was detected and the eluted fractions were analyzed on Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. GST pull-down experiment. Purified GST-HR2-38 was mixed with equal molar 30a-HR1 on ice for 1 h and then loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of PBS and then eluted with 10 mM reduced glutathione. The existence of both GST-HR2-38 and 30a-HR1 in the elution was tested on SDS-PAGE. Circular dichroism spectroscopy. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured on a Jasco J-715 spectrophotometer in PBS. Wavelength spectra were recorded at 25°C using a 0.1 cm pathlength cuvette. For the thermodynamic stability, the HR1-HR2 complex protein was measured at 222 nm by monitoring the CD signal in the temperature ranging from 25 to 95°C with a scan rate of 1°C per minute. Fusion inhibition assay. For the inhibition experiments, Vero E6 cell cultures growing in 96-well microplates were infected with 100Â TCID 50 /well (TCID 50 was virus titers causing 50% of CPE on Vero E6 cell monolayer and the TCID 50 used in this experiment was 1.263 Â 10 6 /ml). The serial 10-fold dilutions of polypeptides (8 repeats for each dilution) were added at the same time as virus adsorption for 1 h at 37°C. Then the mixtures of virus and the polypeptides were replaced by DMEM containing 2% FBS and continued to cultivate for 96 h until calculating the well numbers of CPE and inhibition of CPE. The IC 50 was calculated according to Reed-Muench method [33] .
