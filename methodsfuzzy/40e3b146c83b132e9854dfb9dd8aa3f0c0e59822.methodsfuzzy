Real-time monitoring of prices at major traditional medicine markets across China for TCM species by Chengdu Tiandi Net Information Technology Ltd (www.tiandi.com) enabled the compilation of longterm price data for the four focal species in this study. Major fluctuations in market prices assessed for the 15-year period (2002-2017) for four very different TCM ingredients: two plant species (one wild harvested for fruits (Schisandra sphenanthera Rehder & E.H. Wilson) the other in a transition from wild harvest to cultivation (Paris polyphylla Smith), an animal species (the Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko L.) and the entomophagous "caterpillar fungus" (Ophiocordyceps sinensis (Berk). G.H. Sung, J.M. Sung, Hywel-Jones & Spatafor). All of these species are in commercial trade, but the main reason why they were chosen is that they represented a spectrum of life-forms, a variations in geographic range and habitat specificity (from wide geographic range in the case of G. gecko to habitat specific (O. sinensis) and price ranges (from US$8.06 CNY/kg for G. gecko for to US$18726 to US$30250 CNY/kg for O. sinensis in 2016). In an influential analysis of commonness or rarity, Rabinowitz et al. (1986) developed an approach to characterize the geographic distribution, habitat specificity and relative population sizes of plant species. The first choice is whether the species has a wide or narrow geographic distribution. The second choice, within that distribution, is whether the species has a wide or narrow habitat specificity. We used this to contrast the relative "supply status" of four focal species in this study (Table 1) , also noting additional factors that influenced supplies of each species during the study period.
