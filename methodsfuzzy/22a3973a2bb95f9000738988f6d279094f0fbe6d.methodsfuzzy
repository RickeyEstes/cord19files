Legionella spp. in water samples were detected according to the protocol DIN EN ISO 11731-2. Briefly, 250 ml was taken from the shower, the water pipe or the patient care products (only 50 ml). 100 ml of water or 50 ml of patient care products were filtered using a 0.2 m membrane filter (PALL medical, Dreieich Germany). Filters were incubated on GVPC agar (Becton, Dickenson and Company, Heidelberg, Germany). Moreover, 1 ml was pipetted directly onto GVPC agar. Both samples were incubated for 10 days at 36 ± 2 • C. Plates were read on day 3, 5 and 7. Bacteria were isolated and subcultivated on BCYE agar without cysteine (Becton & Dickenson, Heidelberg, Germany) . Colonies were identified employing mass spectrometry by MALDI-TOF ® (BRUCKER, Germany). Clinical samples were directly plated onto a GVPC agar and handled in the same way as water samples. The detection of Legionella pneumophila serotype 1 antigen was performed in fresh urine sample with an immunofluorescence-based assay using lateral-flow technology (Sofia TM Legionella FIA, Quiedel, San Diego, USA). To detect molds or yeast patient material was inoculated on Sabouraud Glucose Agar with Gentamicin and Chloramphenicol (Oxoid, Germany) for 14 days at 35 ± 2 • C. Plates were read twice a week. MALDI-TOF was used for identification. Aspergillus galactomannan Antigen Index was determined in Serum (Lehrnbecher et al., 2016) , bronchoalveolar fluid (Maertens et al., 2009) and in cerebrospinal fluid (Soeffker et al., 2013) using an Aspergillus Antigen Elisa (Platelia TM , bio-rad, Marnes-La-Coquette). An index above 0.5 was interpreted as possible sign for invasive Aspergillosis. The German national reference laboratory for legionella compared the legionella isolate found in specimen derived from the patients and the legionella isolate found in the water pipe using monoclonal antibodies. The German national reference laboratory for aspergillus compared the aspergillus isolates found in the child and in the nose spray using sequencing of the beta-tubulin gene.
