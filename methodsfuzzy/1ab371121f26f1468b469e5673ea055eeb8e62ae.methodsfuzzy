In a Swiss pig herd (n = 2 boars, 7 sows, 2 gilts, 18 finishing pigs, 30 fattening pigs and 54 suckling piglets: 15 born shortly before and 39 during the outbreak), a disease characterized by fever (up to 41°C), anorexia and reduced general condition with very high morbidity was first detected in finishing pigs (weight~100 kg), extending to all age categories within few days. The pigs were housed in indoor pens with straw bedding, access to an outdoor yard with concrete floor and very good hygiene (i.e., thorough disinfection of the pen before admission of new animals; daily removal of faeces and wet straw; daily washing of the outdoor paddock). Initially, four days after observing the first clinical signs, nasal swabs were taken from five finishing pigs with reduced general condition and analysed for Swine Influenza Virus (SIV) by real time PCR (ADIAVET SIV REAL TIME, ADIAGENE, Biomérieux, Saint-Brieuc, France), with negative results. Three to four days after the first signs of fever, apathy and loss of appetite appeared in fattening pigs, five of the animals (aged 17-18 weeks) began to show severe diarrhoea and faecal samples were collected for parasitological analysis. One of the fattening pigs (breed: Large White × Swiss Landrace cross; age: 17 weeks; weight: 32 kg; length: 84 cm) that was presenting diarrhoea for two days was apathetic, dehydrated, had elevated rectal temperature (39.7°C), pale mucous membranes, cold ears and sunken flanks. The animal was euthanized due to poor condition. At euthanasia, blood samples for routine haematological and biochemical analyses were collected. A standard necropsy was performed and samples from several organs (i.e. heart, lungs, kidneys, spleen, liver, brain, small and large intestines, inguinal and mediastinal lymph nodes and tonsils) were collected, fixed in 10% buffered-formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut at 5 μm sections and microscopically examined after staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E). Faeces from the euthanized pig and from further fatteners with diarrhoea were processed for coproscopy by both a combined sedimentation/flotation technique using zinc chloride solution (specific gravity 1.45) for detection of coccidian oocysts and helminth eggs [6] and by the SAFC technique, a sedimentation method using a sodium acetate -acetic acid -formalin solution, and diethyl-ether for fat extraction to detect vegetative and cystic stages of further protozoa (i.e. Giardia duodenalis, Balantidium coli and amoebae) [6] . Faecal samples collected at necropsy were also tested for Rotavirus A and porcine Coronaviruses (Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus [TGEV] and Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea [PED]) antigens by immunochromatography using commercial kits (FASTest® ROTA Strip Megacor, Hörbranz, Austria and Anigen Rapid TGE/PED Ag Test kit BioNote, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, respectively). Additionally, a bacteriological investigation mainly directed to detect enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) was performed as described by Schubnell et al. [2] . Ileum sections were examined histopathologically for Lawsonia intracellularis infection using the Warthin-Starry silver nitrate-based stain, and tonsils, mediastinal and mesenterial lymph nodes sections were analysed by immunohistochemistry for Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV-2) infection using the monoclonal antibody F217 [17] . Liver sections with suggestive lesions were analysed for herpesvirus detection by nested-PCR [18] . For DNA extraction, 200 μl of xylene were added to a tube containing three (20 μm) formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) liver sections. After vortexing for 1 min and centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was discarded. The samples were washed with 200 μl of absolute ethanol and after further centrifugation the supernatant was discarded. This step was repeated twice. The tubes were incubated open at 37°C for 15 min to allow ethanol evaporation. Afterwards, the DNA extraction was performed with the QiAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were tested by a nested-PCR with primers targeting highly conserved regions of the herpesviral DNA polymerase gene ("Panherpes PCR") [18] . The first PCR-round included three degenerate primers (DFA, ILK and KG1) in a multiplex format and the second PCR-round two degenerate primers (TGV and IYG) [18] . The 25 μl reaction mixtures included 1 μM of each primer, 2 U of Taq DNA Polymerase, 200 μM of each dNTP and 2.5 μl 10× PCR Buffer containing 1.5 mM of MgCl 2 . Five microliters of extracted DNA served as template for the first PCR round, 1 μl product was used for the second PCR. Cycling and analysis was performed as previously described [19] . Positive products were further sequenced using specific primers (TGVseq and IYGseq) [18] by an external laboratory (Microsynth, Switzerland). The obtained sequences were analysed by a BLAST search (NCBI BLAST, http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/Blast.cgi).
