Cell culture and virus stocks. BHK-21, DBT, HEK 293T, and Vero E6 cell lines were maintained at 37°C, 5% CO 2 , with 1ϫ Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillinstreptomycin, and L-glutamine. The LCMV Armstrong 4 (Arm-4) strain was used in this report (51, 52) . Viral stocks were propagated in BHK-21 cells, and viral titers were determined via plaque assay using Vero E6 cells. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 as per the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies). Plasmids. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol from BHK-21 cells infected with LCMV Arm-4 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 48 h at 37°C, 5% CO 2 . Viral glycoprotein cDNA was synthesized using a GP-specific primer (sequence provided upon request) flanked by XhoI recognition sequences using the GoScript reverse transcriptase as per the manufacturer's protocol and cloned into the pTargeT vector (Promega). Point mutations were introduced using the site-directed QuikChange Lightning kit (Agilent Technologies), sequence verified using standard automated sequencing methods, and subcloned into the pCAGGS vector using the XhoI sites (53) . The HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA), as well as the replacement of the native stable signal peptide with the signal sequence from the influenza A hemagglutinin protein (MEKIVLLFAIVS-LVKS), was inserted into the GPC open reading frame using the overlap PCR technique (54) . For construction of the HA SSP GPC plasmid, the HA epitope was inserted between amino acids, A 10 and L 11 , in the SSP region of the fulllength glycoprotein open reading frame. The plasmid encoding only the tagged SSP was created by introduction of two consecutive stop codons at amino acids 59 and 60, the first two residues of the GP1 subunit, and immediately downstream of the SPase recognition site. Both these mutants were initially produced using the pTargeT plasmid and were shuttled into the pCAGGS backbone as stated above. SSP alignment. Amino acid sequences used to highlight the signal peptide conservation were aligned using CLC Sequence Viewer 6 and using the following arenaviruses: Western blotting. Transfected cells were incubated for 48 h, washed with 1ϫ phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1 mM EDTA, collected (600 ϫ g, 4°C, 15 min), and lysed on ice with 1% NP-40 lysis buffer and complete protease inhibitors (RPI Corp.). Clarified lysates (10,000 ϫ g, 4°C, 15 min) were separated under reduced and denatured SDS-PAGE conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. For LCMV glycoprotein complex detection, the anti-GP2 (83.6) and anti-SSP (SP7) antibodies have been described previously (18, 55, 56) . We also used anti-HA (Sigma), anti-actin (Millipore), goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and goat anti-rabbit HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch) antibodies. Blots were processed using the Amersham ECL Prime detection reagents (GE Healthcare) and were developed using the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS system. Densitometry quantification was performed using ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). Immunofluorescence. DBT cells were plated onto flame-sterilized glass coverslips and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). After 48 h of incubation, cells were fixed using 3.7% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature and, when relevant, permeabilized with PBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS-Tween 20 for 1 h prior to overnight primary antibody incubation at 4°C. The phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and Alexa Fluor 405-, 488-, and 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) were used to detect viral or cellular epitopes. For the triple labeling microscopy, cells were incubated with phalloidin-FITC overnight, followed by mouse anti-HA (Sigma) for an additional overnight staining prior to 1 h of incubation with Alexa Fluor 405. Ultimately, cells were stained with GP1 antibody (2.11-10) directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Life Technologies). For the SSP-HA and GP1/2 and the HA SSP GPC samples, coverslips were mounted with a mounting medium lacking DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), while other samples used DAPI-containing mounting medium (Southern Biotechnologies). The mannosidase II antibody was kindly provided by K. Moreman (University of Georgia). Confocal microscopy images were acquired using the Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope. All images were processed linearly using ImageJ and cropped for assembly using Adobe Photoshop. Colocalization measurements were acquired using the ImageJ colocalization finder plugin (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/colocalizationfinder.html). Flow cytometry. Transfected HEK 293T cells were collected and disassociated using cold 5 mM EDTA in 1ϫ PBS. Cells were resuspended in 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), passed through a 26-gauge syringe, and blocked on ice for 30 min. Cells were incubated with either the anti-HA antibody (Sigma), the GP1 antibody directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (2/11/10-488), or the normal mouse IgG antibody (BioLegend) for 30 min on ice. Cells were pelleted (100 ϫ g, 3 min, 10°C) and extensively washed with 5% FBS. For the HA antibody or normal IgG samples, cells were stained with the Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed twice with 5% FBS prior to one wash with 1ϫ PBS. Cells were transferred to prechilled fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) tubes prior to 7-AAD viability staining (BioLegend). Flow cytometry was performed using the FACSCalibur and CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences). All data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Ashland, OR). Fusion assay. DBT cells were plated onto flame-sterilized glass coverslips and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). After 48 h of incubation, cells were washed with 1ϫ PBS and incubated with pH 5-adjusted DMEM growth medium for 1 h before returning to pH 7.4 DMEM maintenance medium for an additional 1 h. Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and extensively washed with 1ϫ PBS, and coverslips were mounted with DAPI-containing mounting medium. Images were acquired using the Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope. The fusion index was determined by counting the number of cells versus the total nuclei, as previously described (29) . Coimmunoprecipitation. Transfected HEK 293T cells were lysed using 0.1% NP-40 lysis buffer (200 mM Tris [pH 6.8], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) with fresh protease inhibitors (RPI Corp.). Clarified lysates were incubated with protein G beads (GE Healthcare) for 30 min at 4°C and collected by mild centrifugation (8, 200 ϫ g, 4°C, 30 s) prior to overnight incubation with either anti-HA agarose beads (Sigma) or the GP1-specific 2.11-15 antibody at 4°C with continuous end-over-end rotation (39) . With the GP1 immunoprecipitation samples, after overnight incubation protein G agarose beads were added to each sample for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were washed thrice with 0.1% NP-40 wash buffer and once without detergent.
