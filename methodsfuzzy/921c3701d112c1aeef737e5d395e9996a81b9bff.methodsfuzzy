There are 2 kinds of methods for alignment-free genetic sequence comparison in the literature. 12 One is based on the statistics of oligomer frequencies and associated with a fixedlength segments, and the other one is based on information theory and chaos theory. In the past 10 years, alignment-free comparison has attracted much attention from researchers, and more and more methods and models have been proposed. The natural vector method is an alignment-free approach to characterize the genetic sequences and could be used to classify and to predict the DNA/RNA and protein sequences with high efficiency and accuracy. 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Let S = (s ,s ,...,s )  is a scaled variance of positions of letter Î±. For example, the nucleotide sequence "ACGTA" will be represented as "(2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 0.8, 0, 0, 0)." Using the natural vector representation, if a viral genome consists of a single-nucleotide sequence, known as single-segmented, then the virus will be represented by a 12-dimensional numerical vector in the database. If a viral genome contains more than one nucleotide sequence, known as multiple-segmented, then each nucleotide sequence is represented by a natural vector and this virus will be represented by multiple 12-dimensional vectors in the database. According to the distance matrix, we find the nearest neighbor of each virus, i.e., the virus that has the smallest distance to it. We check the Baltimore, family, genus, and species labels of the virus and count it as a case of misclassification if they are not consistent. We first build a distance matrix among all viruses in the database. If 2 viruses are both single-segmented, then the distance between them is defined as the Euclidean distance between their natural vectors of the 2 viruses. If at least 1 of the 2 viruses is multiple-segmented, the distance is defined as the Hausdorff distance of 2 sets of natural vectors. 10 For example, if set A = {a 1 , . . . ,a p } and set B = {b 1 , . . . ,b q }, the Hausdorff distance between them is defined as follows: The natural vector method has quite a few successful applications recently. In 2011, we applied natural vector to cluster H1N1 genomes and reported as significant results in dendrogram, which coincided with biologists' analyses in the work by Deng et al. 9 We also predict that the A(H1N1) genomes are originally from swine flu virus genome lineage, which shows the direction toward how to resist the threat of the new influenza; in 2013, we also proposed 12-dimensional natural vectors for classifying all single-segmented viruses (DNA and RNA genomes) which broadened the range of natural vector. 8 Among the 7 Baltimore classes, the error rates of classifying Baltimore labels were below 0.01% for Baltimore I, II, IV, V, and VII, and the error rates of classifying family labels were 0 for Baltimore II, III, V, VI, and VII. After validating with the published references, we successfully predicted 21 missing labels of viruses. In the work by Huang et al, 10 we extended the natural vector approach to include multiple-segmented viruses by introducing Hausdorff metric in the GenBank at that time. The error rates of the predictions of 2384 viruses were 3.5% for Baltimore labels, 4.6% for family labels, 0.3% for subfamily labels, and 4.4% for genus labels. We also analyzed the influenza A(H7N9) virus whose genome consists of 8 segments and drew the conclusion that the analysis based on whole genomes through Hausdorff distance is more reliable than the classical one based only on 2 segments, which proves that our method performs well in multiple-segmented viruses. In 2015, we applied natural vectors on Ebola viruses of the 2014 outbreak. 11 The accuracy rates on classifying family and genus labels were 100%. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that a protein named VP24 is the most consistent one to the variation of virulence among the 7 proteins related to Ebola viruses, which suggests that VP24 would be a pharmaceutical target for preventing and treating Ebola virus. As natural vector can reflect core information stored in sequences and genomes, we use it to construct the virus classification system introduced in this article.
