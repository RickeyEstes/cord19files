We assessed the sensitivity of each sampling method by considering any positive result from each of the specimens as a true positive. We compared the sensitivities using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Statistical significance was concluded if the pvalue was <0.05. Data were recorded and analyzed with the software SPSS version 17.0.
