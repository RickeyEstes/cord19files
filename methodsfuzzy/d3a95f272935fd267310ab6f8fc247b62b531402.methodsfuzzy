The protease-susceptible sites in a given protein or peptide usually extend to an octapeptide region [12, 13] . The corresponding amino acid residues are sequentially symbolized by eight subsites R 4 , R 3 , R 2 , R 1 , R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , and the eight combination positions of protease are noted by S 4 , S 3 , S 2 , S 1 , S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , S 4 (see, e.g., [8, 9] as well as Fig. 3 of [12] ). Occasionally, the susceptible sites in some proteins may contain one subsite less or more [13] , however, eight amino acid residues are the most common cases. Although the protein being cleaved contains much more than eight amino acid residues, usually only the segment of an octapeptide fits in Fig. 1 . A schematic drawing to illustrate the "distorted key" theory [12, 13] : (a) the cleavage location in the octapeptide by protease is the peptide bond between R 1 and R 1 ; (b) after chemical modification, the scissile peptide bond changes to a strong "hybrid peptide bond" and the cleavage is difficult. Adapted from Chou [12] with permission. the active site region of a protease. Therefore, our research will focus on the cleavability of an octapeptide. As shown in Fig. 1a , the combination of a thin line and a dashed line is used to represent the conjugate property in peptide bond. In Fig. 1b , however, the scissile peptide bond is replaced by a strong "hybrid peptide bond" between R 1 and R 1 through a chemical modification, and the enhanced chemical bond become not cleavable by the protease. According to the "distorted key" theory [12] , a cleavable octapeptide can be likened to a key that fits well in binding to the protease active region leading to a cleavage at its scissile bond. The octapeptide after some chemical modification can still bind to the active region but its peptide bond can no longer be cleaved by the protease. Thus, the modified octapeptide can be vividly compared to a "distorted key" that can be inserted into a lock but that can neither open it nor be easily pulled out from the lock [12] . In view of this, the modified octapeptide naturally becomes a stable competitive inhibitor and a potential candidate of drug. The octapetide AVLQSGFR is the first designed octapeptide [20] based on the molecular structure of SARS CoV M pro and is proved cleavable experimentally. In this study, we use molecular mechanical and quantum mechanical simulations to investigate the cleavage mechanism, properties of the chemical bonds concerned as well as the catalytic interaction between the octapeptide and SARS CoV M pro . The study is performed in the following four steps: (1) using molecular mechanics to minimize the energy of the SARS CoV M pro complex with the octapeptide from the basis derived from docking studies; (2) computing the atomic charge distribution around the binding pocket of SARS CoV M pro using ab initio quantum mechanics and the minimizing conformational energy; (3) computing the molecular energy, chemical bond properties, and atomic charges of the octapeptide in the background charge distribution [24] of SARS CoV M pro using ab initio quantum mechanics; and (4) in the same back- ground charge distribution, computing the molecular energy, chemical bond properties, and atomic charges of the modified octapeptide.
