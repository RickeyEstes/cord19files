During a one-year period (October 2006 to September 2007) throat swab samples were collected from 370 previously healthy children, aged 14 days to 13 years (mean age ± SD 17 ±13 months) admitted to two dif-ferent large hospitals of Thessaloniki, Northern Greece. Samples were taken on the first day of admission and kept at -70°C until use. All children were admitted because of acute infection of the respiratory tract. Demographic data and clinical diagnosis including acute infection of the upper respiratory tract, croup, bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia were obtained from a computer-generated discharge diagnosis based database. The case notes of children were reviewed using a standardised clinical data extraction form. The following data were recorded: sex, age, initial presenting symptoms, signs, discharge diagnosis and routine laboratory examinations upon admission and during hospitalization (complete blood count, C-reactive protein, chest X-ray). Extracted DNA was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which targets the NS1 gene of the HBoV genome [8] . All PCR products were sequenced and nucleotide sequences were compared with respective HBoV sequences retrieved from GenBank. In addition, all samples were tested by molecular methods for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses, influenza viruses, human metapneumovirus and adenoviruses.
