Parasites for all experiments were harvested shortly after natural egress, purified by passage through a 20-gauge needle, and separated from host cell debris using 3.0-m polycarbonate Nuclepore filters (Whatman). RAW 264.7 macrophage cells (ATCC TIB-71) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies) and cultured at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Bone marrowderived macrophages (BMDMs) were isolated from the femurs of adult mice, as described previously (71) . BMDMs were harvested in DMEM containing 20% L929 conditioned medium, 10% FBS, and 5% horse serum in a 100-mm by 20-mm untreated polystyrene culture dish (Corning). After a week of culture, the cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% L929 conditioned medium, 10% FBS, and 5% horse serum. For experiments, BMDMs were rinsed in calcium-magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested by incubation with 1.25 mM trypsin for 20 min, and seeded in DMEM containing 10% FBS. All strains and host cell lines were determined to be mycoplasma negative using the e-Myco Plus kit (Intron Biotechnology). Animals. Mice were housed and bred locally at Washington University in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-approved facility. Animal studies were conducted according to the U.S Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All mice were on a C57BL/6 background.

For survival assays, 8-to 12-week-old mice were injected with 10 4 CTG tachyzoites i.p., and survival was monitored for 60 days. For in vivo parasite clearance, 10 6 parasites were injected i.p. into 8-to 12-week-old mice. Mice were sacrificed 48 h postinfection, and peritoneal cells were isolated by lavage with ice-cold PBS. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with FITC-F4/80 and Cy5-Gr1 to identify inflammatory macrophages, Pac Blue-DG52 to label parasites, and PE-B220 to gate out B cells. The fraction of parasite-positive Gr1 ϩ -F4/80 ϩ cells was used to monitor the burden of parasite infection based on acquisition of 50,000 events per sample on a FACSCanto II flow cytometer at the Flow Cytometry research core, Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis. Data were analyzed using the flowCore R package (75) . Chronic cyst burden estimation. Surviving mice after 60 days of infection with the CTG strain were sacrificed, and their brains were harvested in 1 ml of 6% (vol/vol) formaldehyde and 0.25% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in cold PBS. Brain homogenate was prepared by passing the tissue multiple times through a 16-gauge needle. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 400 ϫ g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was then blocked with 10% (vol/vol) normal goat serum in PBS at 4°C for 1 h. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 400 ϫ g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended with 20 g/ml FITC-conjugated Dolichos biflorus lectin (DBL) in 10% goat serum for 2 h at room temperature. The homogenates were washed twice with 10% goat serum and resuspended in 1 ml PBS for microscopic examination. Each sample was examined using three aliquots of 12.5 l each using an epifluorescence microscope equipped with an FITC emission channel. Immunofluorescence microscopy. The cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, blocked using 5% FBS and 5% normal goat serum with 0.02% saponin in PBS for 30 min, and incubated with primary antibodies in 1% FBS with 0.02% saponin in PBS for 90 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies and Hoechst stain (100 ng/ml) to stain nuclei (Life Technologies) for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with PBS followed by image acquisition. Parasites and macrophages were labeled with 1:1,000 DG52 and rat 1:1,000 anti-LAMP1 as primary antibodies followed by 1:1,000 anti-mouse IgG-Alexa 488 and anti-rat IgG-Alexa 594 as secondary antibodies. Cells plated in 96-well CLEAR black plates (Greiner Bio International) for Toxoplasma survival assay were imaged on a Cytation3 cell imaging multimode reader (BioTek) using a 20ϫ objective (numerical aperture [NA], 0.45). Cells plated on coverslips for Gbp5 localization were imaged on an LSM880 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) using a 63ϫ objective (NA, 1.4) as part of the Microbiology Imaging Facility, Washington University in St. Louis. Transmission electron microscopy. For ultrastructural analyses, samples were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde-2.5% glutaraldehyde (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) in 100 mM sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, for 2 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4°C. Samples were washed in sodium cacodylate buffer at room temperature and postinfection fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Polysciences Inc.) for 1 h. Samples were then rinsed extensively in distilled water (dH 2 O) prior to en bloc staining with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) for 1 h. Following several rinses in dH 2 O, samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in Eponate 12 resin (Ted Pella Inc.). Sections of 95 nm were cut with a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, IL), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed on a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA Inc., Peabody, MA) equipped with an AMT 8-megapixel digital camera and AMT Image Capture Engine V602 software (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Woburn, MA) as part of the Microbiology Imaging Facility, Washington University in St. Louis. Toxoplasma intracellular survival assay. RAW 264.7 cells or BMDMs were seeded in 96-well CLEAR black plates (Greiner Bio International) 24 h prior to infection. Cells were infected with CTG or GT1 at an MOI of 0.5 for 30 min followed by three PBS washes to remove extracellular parasites. Cells were fixed at 30 min and 20 h postinfection using 4% formaldehyde and stained to detect host cell (anti-LAMP1) and parasites (anti-SAG1) followed by Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies. Images were acquired at 20ϫ on the Cytation3 imager, and the percentage of infected cells per field was determined using CellProfiler 2.1.1 (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). For RAW 264.7 macrophages, the number of infected cells at each time point was used to calculate the percentage of infection. Data from at least 50 fields per experiment were used to calculate the percent decrease in infected cells at 20 h versus 30 min postinfection. Luminol-based respiratory burst assay. One million RAW 264.7 cells or BMDMs per 100 l of phenol-free DMEM were warmed to 37°C for 15 min. Luminol and horseradish peroxidase were added to cells at final concentrations of 200 M and 20 U/ml, respectively, and incubated for 5 min at 37°C. The cells were then infected with parasites at an MOI of 10 or incubated with 50 g/ml ZymA (with or without 10 M DPI). Chemiluminescence was then recorded as relative light units (RLU) per second in real time for the next 2 h using the Cytation3 imager and analyzed using Gen5 software. Intracellular ROS measurement assay. RAW 264.7 cells or BMDMs were seeded in 96-well CLEAR black plates 24 h prior to infection. Parasites were labeled by incubation with 2.5 M carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) for 5 min before infecting macrophages at an MOI of 2 for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with PBS to remove extracellular parasites. At different time intervals postinfection, cells were stained with 5 M CellROX deep red (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Hoechst stain (100 ng/ml) for 30 min. After washing with PBS, images were acquired at 20ϫ on the Cytation3 imager. After illumination correction of each image, integrated emission intensity per cell in the Cy5 channel was calculated for uninfected and infected cells across many fields. Histograms of the Cy5 intensity values were generated from at least 2,000 cells per sample. Western blotting. Cell lysates of BMDMs were prepared using CellLytic M (Sigma) mixed with Complete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cell supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 6,000 ϫ g for 10 min at room temperature (RT) to avoid cell debris. Total protein was measured in each sample using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were boiled at 95°C for 15 min in Laemmli buffer containing 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Samples were separated using SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in a 1:1 mixture of Odyssey blocking buffer (OBB; Li-Cor Biosciences) and PBS overnight at 4°C. The membrane was incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Gbp5 or anti-caspase-1 at 1:1,000 and mouse anti-actin (C4 clone; Millipore) at 1:4,000 for 2 h at RT in a 1:1 mixture of Odyssey blocking buffer and PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-Tween). The blot was washed three times for 5 min each with PBS-Tween and incubated with anti-rabbit IgG IR800 and anti-mouse IgG IR700 at 1:15,000 for 2 h at RT in a 1:1 mixture of Odyssey blocking buffer and PBS-Tween. The blot was washed three times for 5 min each with PBS-Tween followed by infrared imaging on a Li-Cor Odyssey imaging system. Band intensities were calculated using the Odyssey software. Real-time PCR. Samples were lysed, and RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy minikit per the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was prepared using the Bio-Rad iScript cDNA synthesis kit per the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR of all the genes was performed using Clontech SYBR Advantage qPCR premix per the manufacturer's instructions. Data acquisition was done in QuantStudio3 (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed in QuantStudio design and analysis software (Applied Biosystems). Primers are listed in Table S1 . Comparative threshold cycle (C T ) values were used to evaluate fold change in transcripts using actin as an internal transcript control. ELISA for IL-1␤. Supernatants from samples were collected after centrifugation at 6,000 ϫ g for 10 min at RT to avoid cell debris. The supernatants were stored at Ϫ80°C if not used immediately. IL-1␤ levels in the supernatant were measured using the mouse IL-1␤/IL-1F2 DuoSet enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (R&D Systems) per the manufacturer's instructions. Cell viability staining. BMDMs were seeded in 96-well CLEAR black plates. Cells were either untreated or treated with 10 ng/ml of LPS for 24 h prior to infection or treatment. The cells were infected with CTG or GT1 parasites at an MOI of 3 for 20 h. Nigericin (10 M) was used to treat cells for 3 h prior to fixation. As a positive control, 0.1% (wt/vol) saponin treatment for 10 min was used to lyse cells. The samples were washed once with PBS and stained with the Live/Dead staining kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing a mixture of 2 M calcein and 1 M of ethidium homodimer-1 in PBS for 30 min. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min. The cells were washed with PBS, imaged using a Cytation3 imager at 20ϫ, and analyzed using CellProfiler 2.1.1. Statistical analyses. Unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests were used for comparison between experiments with normally distributed data using Prism (GraphPad). All experiments were performed at least three independent times, and statistical analyses were conducted on the composite data unless reported otherwise. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's multiple-comparison test was used to compare CTG clearance kinetics in BMDMs. Non-normally distributed data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's correction for multiple tests. Survival statistics were compared using log rank and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests in Prism (GraphPad).
