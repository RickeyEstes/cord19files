Clinical symptoms in diseased calves: Case 1: In May 2010, a Holstein calf (female, 84 days old) showed anorexia, pyrexia and diarrhea in a depositary raising farm in Yamaguchi Prefecture. Despite treatment with antibiotics (kanamycin and tylosin), sulfamonomethoxine and antipyretic, the calf died 20 days after the onset of diarrhea. Case 2: In July 2012, a Japanese black calf (female, 246 days old) on another farm in Yamaguchi Prefecture repeated diarrhea despite treatment with antibiotics (kanamycin) and a probiotic product after the birth, and then, feces were collected during the acute phase for diagnosis. Paired serum samples were collected during the acute and convalescent phases. Isolation of microorganisms: Tissue specimens obtained from major organs including cerebrum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon and ideal contents of the dead calf (case 1) and feces of the second calf (case 2) were minced and homogenized in serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium with kanamycin (MEM) (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan). After centrifugation of the 10% homogenate, the supernatant was filtered through a 450 nm membrane (Merck Millipore Ltd., Carrigtwohill, Ireland), and 0.15 ml of the supernatants were inoculated onto hamster lung (HmLu-1) cells, Mardin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells, bovine testicular (BT) cells, human rectal adenocarcinoma (HRT-18) cells and Vero cells in 24-well plates. After adsorption for 60 min at 37°C, the cells were washed with MEM, and then, 0.5 ml of MEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Bovogen Biologicals, Williams Avenue, Australia) was added to each well. The cells were incubated at 37°C, and cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed. After incubation for 10 days, cells were frozen and thawed once and then centrifuged. Subsequent passages were carried out at least twice in the same manner with 0.15 ml of the supernatant. Gimenez stain was used to identify CPE. DHL Agar, Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood and GAM agar with 5% yolk and 0.1% cysteine were used for bacterial isolation. The gene of Clostridium perfringens toxin isolated from small-intestinal contents was identified by PCR [2] . Identification of isolates by PCR, sequence and phylogenetic analysis of C. pecorum omp1 gene: C. pecoruminfected cells and the supernatants from organs described above were used for DNA extraction. Total DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Hiden, Germany). PCR was carried out with TaKaRa Ex Taq Hot Start Version (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). Primer pairs targeting fragments of genus-specific and species-specific Chlamydia omp1 genes were used for PCR as described by Kaltenböck et al. [13] . PCR products were electrophoresed on 2.0% agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide staining. PCR products were purified using Min-iElute PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, U.S.A.) and directly sequenced using a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX, U.S.A.). Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the MEGA 5 program. Sequence data were aligned using ClustalW method [23] . Genetic distances were calculated using the Tamura-Nei model [22] . Phylogenetic trees were constructed using neighbor-joining methods [19] , and the reliability of the branch was evaluated by bootstrapping with 1,000 replicates. Antigenic analysis of C. pecorum isolates: The antigenicity of isolates were compared by immunoblot analysis using rabbit antisera [6] to Bo/Yokohama [6] , Bo/Maeda [7] and Ov/IPA [6] strains of C. pecorum. Antisera to Bo/Maeda and Ov/IPA strains were prepared as described by Fukushi and Hirai [6] . HmLu-1 cells were infected with C. pecorum 22-58, Bo/Yokohama, Bo/Maeda and Ov/IPA strains and C. psittaci Cal10 [9] strain and then incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 until CPE was observed. The cells were recovered from dishes with 0.02% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended in PBS. Cells were then mixed with an equal volume of 2 × concentrated sample buffer consisting of 6.25 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 20% glycerol and 0.001% bromophenol blue. Samples were boiled for 3 min, placed on ice for 3 min and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 3 min at room temperature. Cell lysates were electrophoresed using 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Billerica, MA, U.S.A.). After blocking with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 3% gelatin (EIA Grade Reagent Gelatin; Bio-Rad, CA, U.S.A.) for 45 min at 37°C, the membrane was washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (T-TBS). After incubation with diluted rabbit antisera for 45 min at 37°C, the membrane was washed 3 times with T-TBS. Then, the membrane was reacted with peroxidase-conjugated purified recombinant protein A/G (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Rockford, IL, U.S.A.) for 45 min at 37°C. After washing the membrane with T-TBS and TBS three times each, specific bands were visualized using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Rabbit antisera described above were used for the crossneutralization test. Sera were serially diluted twofold in MEM in 96-well microplates. Each dilution was mixed with an equal volume of 200 TCID 50 /0.05 ml of C. pecorum strains and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. Then, 0.1 ml (approximately 6 × 10 3 cells) of HmLu-1 cells in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added to each well. After incubation at 37°C for 7 days, antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum which inhibited CPE completely. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses: Tissue specimens obtained from major organs, intestines and central nervous system of the dead calf (case 1) were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Paraffin-embedded tissues were cut at 2 µm and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The sections were also used for immunohistochemical detection of C. pecorum antigens. After deparaffinization and rehydration of the paraffin sections, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation in 3% H 2 O 2 for 10 min. Sections were incubated with 10% normal goat serum for 30 min and then with a rabbit anti-C. pecorum Bo/Yokohama strain antiserum [6] (1:2,000) for 30 min. Sections were rinsed three times in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 for 10 min and then incubated with Histofine Simple Stain MAX-PO (R) (Nichirei Biosciences, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min. The sections were rinsed three times in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 for 10 min. The sections were incubated with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride under the mi-croscope to control color development, washed in tap water for 10 min and rinsed with distilled water. The sections were counterstained with Meyer's hematoxylin.
