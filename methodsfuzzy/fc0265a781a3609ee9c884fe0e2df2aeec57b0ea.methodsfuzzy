The primary goal of our analysis was to establish the diagnostic accuracy of sonographically-confirmed pneumonia when compared to radiographically-confirmed clinical pneumonia as the reference standard. This comparison was conducted in child participants with respiratory findings that were diagnosed with clinical pneumonia by a study physician, and had both CXR and LUS conducted as part of the study. We focused on clinical pneumonia only because asthma, bronchiolitis and upper respiratory infection had low rates of consolidation on CXR. We defined positive sonographic findings as either finding a consolidation or any abnormality on LUS. Any abnormality on LUS was included to show that there was a difference in diagnostic accuracy between consolidation and any abnormality on LUS, when compared to radiographically-confirmed clinical pneumonia. Diagnostic accuracy was measured using positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, specificity and the C-statistic as a measure of area under the Receiving Operator Characteristic curve. We analyzed continuous variables as means using analysis of variance, and categorical variables as proportions using chi-square or Fisher exact tests, as appropriate. Inter-rater agreement among readers was determined using the kappa coefficient. We conducted statistical analyses in R (www.r-project.org) and STATA version 13 (StatCorp, College Station, Texas).
