Animal model establishment and examination. Small-tailed Han sheep were provided by the Laboratory Animal Center of the Fourth Military Medical University (Xi'an, China) and all animal experiments were approved by the animal welfare ethics committee of the School of Stomatology, the Fourth Military Medical University. A total of 6 male sheep (aged 6 months, 25-35 kg) were kept under 20˚C, 40-60% humidity with a circadian rhythm (12:12 h light:dark cycle). The animals were fed with a standard diet and had free access to water. The traumatic TMJA model was constructed according to the protocol outlined in previous publications (9, 11, 12) . Briefly, the bilateral TMJ capsule was exposed from an incision to the anterior tragus. The joint capsule was incised and the condyle was exposed, and underwent a sagittal fracture by piezosurgery. Meanwhile, the outside quarter of the joint disc was dissected and a '#' shaped groove was created by piezosurgery on the fossa surface. In addition, the right side LPM was dissected (LPD) while the left side was normal (LPN) i.e. without dissection. The tissue was tightly sutured apart from the capsule and penicillin (1 mg pure penicillin G sodium per sheep for 3 days) was used to prevent infection. Sheep who did not receive surgery i.e. untreated normal sheep (UTR) were used as a blank control. The surgical procedures are illustrated in Fig. S1 . A total of 6 sheep were used and randomly divided into 2 groups of 3, which comprised the 4-and 12 weeks evaluation groups. In each group, one sheep was randomly selected as the UTR and the remaining sheep were subjected to surgery. For each animal in the group of surgical sheep, the right side of the TMJ was the LPD group while the left side was the LPN group. Gene chip RNA preparation. At either 4 or 12 weeks (8), the sheep were sacrificed using an overdose injection of pentobarbital sodium, and the bone tissues within the condylar fractured zones were separated and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen (-195.79˚C ). Then the samples were subjected to total RNA extraction, purification and quality testing according to a standard Affymetrix protocol by Shanghai Biotechnology Corporation (Shanghai, China) as reported elsewhere (13) . The sample quality test is provided in Table SI . Gene chip analysis. The prepared RNA samples were subjected to gene chip hybridization, scanning and normalization according to the standard Affymetrix protocol. The differential genes were screened by a threshold method and the genes with a fold-change >2 were considered as differential genes (e.g. the ratio >2 or ratio <0.5). In addition, the data was further analyzed by cluster heat map (Cluster 3.0; http://bonsai. hgc.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster/software.htm), scatter plot (R 3.5.0; https://www.r-project.org/), Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) Bioinformatics Resources 6.8 Platform (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) and Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment (Bioconductor 3.8 in R 3.5.0; http://bioconductor.org/), according to the respective manufacturer's protocol. The abbreviations for the biological processes included in the GO term enrichment analysis were listed in Table SII . Genes were identified as significantly differentially expressed by GO term enrichment analysis (P<0.05). Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) RNA preparation. The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen for 48 h prior to being ground in a cold mortar. The total RNA was extracted by miRCURY RNA Isolation kit-tissue (Exiqon; Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA concentration was measured by NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and 1 µg total RNA was used for RT by the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Otsu, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, RT was conducted at 37˚C for 15 min, followed by 5 sec at 85˚C to terminate RT. Samples were then stored at 4˚C. RT-qPCR. The cDNA was amplified by SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara Bio, Inc., Otsu, Japan) in order to perform the RT-qPCR procedure according to the manufacturer's protocol. qPCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) under the following conditions: 95˚C for 30 sec, followed by 40 cycles of 95˚C for 5 sec and 60˚C for 30 sec, and finally the melt curve stage (95˚C for 15 sec, 60˚C for 1 min and 95˚C for 15 sec). The associated primers were synthesized by Takara Bio, Inc., and RPL19 was used as endogenous reference, which are listed in Table SIII . The relative gene expression was calculated by the 2 -ΔΔCq method (14) . Three independent experiments were repeated. Statistical analysis. The quantitative data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of at least three experimental repeats. The one-way analysis of variance with Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test was used to compare differences between groups within a certain gene (GraphPad Prism 5; GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
