T4 polynucleotide kinase (EC 2.7.1.78) was from Pharmacia P-L Biochemicals, tRNA~ et, ddNTPs and dNTPs were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. AMV reverse transcriptase (EC 2.7.7.49) was obtained from Omutninsk (U.S.S.R.). 30 S and 50 S subunits of E. coli MRE 600 were isolated as described previously [4] . Initiation factor IF-3 was prepared as in [5] . Initiation translation complexes were formed in modification buffer (MB-buffer) 80 mM K-Hepes (pH 7.6), 10 mM MgC12, 60 mM KCI, 6 mM fl-mercaptoethanol as described early for toeprinting experiments, only primer, reverse transcript-0167-4781/90/$03.50 © 1990 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. (Biomedical Division) ase and dNTPs were omitted from incubation cocktails containing 0.6/~M mRNA, 2-4 #M ribosomal subunits, 20-40 #M tRNA Met and 2-4 #M IF-3 [6] . Cro-mini-mRNA was isolated by using the method [7] with some modifications. E. coli PR13 (RNase I-, pnp-) transformed with the plasmid pMM 52 were grown to late log phase. Cro-mini-mRNA was separated by electrophoresis in 8% PAG containing 7 M urea and eluted with 0.5 M ammonium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS (GES-buffer) and an equal volume of water saturated phenol. Samples were concentrated on a DE-52 column, precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in water and stored in water at -20°C. The chemical probing of the mRNA structure [8] was done as follows: 1 #1 of DMS/ethanol (1 : 20, v/v) or 1 #1 of 0.54% kethoxal (KE) or 10/~1 of 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulphonate (CMCT) (42 mg/ml) were added to 10/~1 of mRNA or initiation complexes in MB-buffer. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 5 min for DMS and 15-20 min for other two chemicals. Next, 1/4 volume of stop-solution (1.5 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 1 M-flmercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM EDTA) was added, mixed and then supplemented with 3 vol. of ethanol. Pellets were resuspended in 50 #1 of GES-buffer, extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v) and precipitated with 3 vol. of ethanol. Primer extensions and dideoxynucleotide sequencing of RNA were performed as described by Shelness and Williams [9] . As a primer, a 20-mer, dCGAGGTGAAT-TTCGACCTCT, complementary to positions 98-117 of cro-mini-mRNA [10] was used.
