Pathway analysis and protein retrieval Figure 1 showed the strategies for identification of suitable drug targets and prediction of inhibitor used. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database 28, 29 was searched for metabolic pathways for both human genomes and E. coli O157:H7 Sakai strain. The identification numbers of all pathways from both organisms were listed. A manual comparison was made, and pathways that did not appear in the human genomes but were present in the pathogen, according to the KEGG database annotations, were selected as unique to E. coli O157:H7, while the remaining pathways were listed as common. Amino acid sequences of proteins from common and unique pathways were obtained from UniprotKB. 30 Identification of essential proteins and non-homologous proteins in humans Database of Essential Genes (DEG) 31 was used to identify the essential proteins involved in host-pathogen pathways. The DEG 6.8 database was retrieved from http://www.tubic. tju.edu.cn/deg/. The BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor (version 7.1.3) was used for Protein Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTP) search to screen for and eliminate the probable essential proteins of the organism setting e-value cut off 10 −4 , sequence identity .35%, bit score .100 and others as default. All human protein sequences were retrieved from Refseq database ftp site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/H_ sapiens/protein/) and essential proteins were subjected to BLASTP search against the human proteins with BioEdit. Only the non-hit proteins at e-value cut off 10 −10 , were
