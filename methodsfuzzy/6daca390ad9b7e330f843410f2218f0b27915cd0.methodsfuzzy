The genomic information of viruses, bacteria, and some eukaryotes can be found at GenBank. where 128 and 18 is the mean molecular weight of amino acids and water respectively, 6.02e23 is the number of molecules of one mole. The data for x comes from the genome database of GenBank. The data for volumes of bacteria can be found at website: http://www.ionizers.org/Sizes-of-Bacteria.html. The volumes of bacteria can be calculated based on rod lengths and rod or coccus diameters. Given the average cell volume v of multicellular eukaryotes as 300 Î¼m 3 , the total cell number z of an organism is: z = w/v = (w/3) 10 10 , where w is the weight of the organism. The data of UniGene can be found at website: http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=UniGene. On the homepage of UniGene, you can see the number of Uni-Gene clusters of diverse organisms. Click on the organism name and enter the page of statistic data, you can see "Final Number of Clusters" and "Histogram of cluster sizes". With the number of total sets subtracting the number of cluster sizes with only one sequence, you can obtain the number of UniGene clusters. TGI's data can be found at website http://compbio. dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/tgipage.html. Click on the organism names, you can enter the database of that organism. There are statistical data for every organism. Only the number of TC sequences is what we need. The singleton data can be ignored. Alternative splicing data can be found at http://t.caspur.it/ASPicDB/. There is statistic data of human alternative splicing on the homepage, including number of genes, transcripts, etc. Although there are also alternative splicing data of other species, they are not yet complete enough. You can also obtain the numbers of genes expressed in a specific tissue from this database. In the advanced search page, you can search genes with different specific tissue names in the search bar, and then you can get the number of genes. We had these numbers averaged and got about 5000. The database does not give the data of transcripts expressed in different tissues; otherwise the average size of transcriptome t can be obtained this way. The data of average adult weights of eukaryotes are calculated based on the body sizes, which can be found or estimated from various sources. All the calculation can be conducted by simple Perl scripts, which are available on request.
