Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) leading to respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation is an important cause of admission for PIC. The cause of illness in these cases may be difficult to establish, but most are believed to be due to respiratory viruses [11] [12] [13] [14] . The need for a rapid diagnosis is an ongoing discussion in the literature [12, 13] . Van de Pol and colleagues [15] reported their comparison of conventional diagnostic methods (culture and immunofluorescence) with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Of 23 patients admitted for PIC because of LRTI, the authors analysed 21 by means of culture, 22 by means of immunofluorescence, and 23 by means of RT-PCR. Fortyeight percent (n = 11) were positive for respiratory viruses by conventional methods and 96% by RT-PCR. More than one virus was detected in one third of the patients, but only by using the RT-PCR technique. This method was found to be highly sensitive for a broad range of respiratory viruses (RSV A and B, influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza virus 1-4, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, human coronavirus OC43, NL63, and 229E, and human metapneumovirus) and atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Clamydia pneumoniae). RT-PCR increased the diagnostic yield by twofold in comparison to conventional methods and proved to be a reliable and fast diagnostic method.
