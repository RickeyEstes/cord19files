The Malmquist index is the most frequently used indicator to compute the productivity of industries over time periods and the most popular approach was proposed by Färe et al. (1995) . The peculiarities of this method are that (i) non-parametric frontier technologies are used in computing the index and, (ii) it is possible to decompose the index into technical efficiency and technology change. Moreover, the indirect advantage of this approach is that in using non-parametric technologies there is no need to impose an a priori functional form on the production function. The Malmquist index is widely applied in air transportation to compute airline productivity. Recent examples of applications can be found in Sickles et al. (2002) , Greer (2008) , Chow (2010) , Assaf (2011) , and Pires and Fernandes (2012) . However, the Malmquist index approach as proposed by Färe et al. (1995) received criticism for a lack of feasibility under certain conditions (Ray and Desli, 1997) . Similar drawbacks are present in the Malmquist-Luenberger index, developed by Chung et al. (1997) to consider negative externalities in productivity evaluations. To overcome these problems, we develop a biennial Malmquist-Luenberger index (BML) starting from the biennial Malmquist index (BM) presented by Pastor et al. (2011) . The adoption of a ''biennal'' approach solves (i) infeasibility under variable returns to scale, (ii) the non-identification of technical regress, and (iii) the recalculation of indices when adding new time periods. We start by representing the production possibility set for k = 1,. . . , K airlines producing M desirable outputs, y = 1,. . . , M with y e R M þ , J undesirable outputs, b = 1,. . ., J with b e R J þ by using N inputs, x = 1,. . . , N with x e R N þ , as follows: Following Färe et al. (2007) , our technology is required to satisfy the standard axioms of (i) inactivity, (ii) finite production and consumption levels, and (iii) free input disposability. Regarding the undesirable output production, the technology requires (iv) weak disposability of undesirable outputs, (v) strong disposability of good outputs, and (vi) outputs null-jointness. The distance from the observations to the frontier is computed by a directional distance function (DDF). 4 Our DDF seeks to increase the desirable outputs while simultaneously decreasing the undesirable outputs. Formally, it can be defined as follows: where g ¼ ðg y ; g b Þ is a direction vector with g 2 R M þ Â R J þ defining the direction of the increase (decrease) of desirable (undesirable) outputs. Following Pastor and Lovell (2005) and Pastor et al. (2011) , we define a series of overlapping biennial technologies for each pair-wise comparison of adjacent periods. Two adjacent time periods are sufficient to overcome the problems normally affecting the previous productivity indices. We compute the defined technologies and respective distance functions using a variable return to a scale data envelopment analysis approach (DEA). Starting from the biennial technology and following Chung et al. (1997) , we can define the Biennial Malmquist-Luenberger index (BML) as follows: where the directional distance functionD B ðx; y; bÞ is defined on the biennial benchmark technology. A BML index > (<) 1 means that the production enables more (less) desirable outputs and less (more) undesirable outputs for a given amount of inputs. Consequently, a BML = 1 implies the absence of productivity growth. Moreover, since the technology includes both period t and period t + 1 technologies, we do not need to apply the usual geometric mean in defining Eq. (3). The BML index can be decomposed into the components of productivity growth as follows: where EC is the efficiency change and TC is the technical change. The former represents the efficiency gain over the time period and the latter accounts for technical progress in the airlines' production function. EC > (<) 1 means an increase (decrease) in the efficiency of the decision-making unit (DMU) with respect to the contemporaneous frontiers. TC > (<) 1 indicates that the best practice technology in the period t + 1 is closer (further) to the biennial best practice frontier than the best practice technology in the period t. In other words, when the TC is greater (smaller) than one, there is a progress (regress) in the technology . To calculate and decompose the BML index, we need to specify four DDFs: two functions with   observations  under  consideration  and  the  biennial  production set-namely,D B x t ; y t ; b t ; g y ; g b and D B x tþ1 ; y tþ1 ; b tþ1 ; g y ; g b -and two functions in which observations and the production set are from the time periods under observation, that is,D t x t ; y t ; b t ; g y ; g b andD tþ1 x tþ1 ; y tþ1 ; b tþ1 ; g y ; g b . Following Chung et al. (1997) and Kumar (2006) , for a BM and BML comparison, we consider the direction vector g ¼ ðy; ÀbÞ. Thus, we seek the maximum proportional contraction of negative externalities and the maximum proportional expansion of positive outputs. Finally, the biennial Malmquist (BM) index is computed as presented in Pastor et al. (2011) . The main difference between the BM and BML indices is that the BM does not consider the production of negative externalities in the distance computations. Oh (2010) describes the equivalence between the global Malmquist-Luenberger and the global Malmquist indices and such equivalence is totally valid for the BML and the BM index.
