Our investigations are part of the Europe-wide study PreDicta. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Universit€ atsklinikum Friedrich-Alexander Universit€ at Erlangen-N€ urnberg, Germany (Re-No. 4435). Informed consent was obtained from the parents of all participants. The study is registered in the German Clinical Trial Register (Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien: registration no. DRKS00004914). Subject recruitment and some clinical aspects of the children were recently published and described also elsewhere. E1,E2 This is a longitudinal prospective evaluation over a 2-year period, beginning at the age of 4 to 6 years. In accordance with the PreDicta guidelines, children who met the inclusion criteria in the absence of exclusion criteria were recruited into the study. Childhood asthma was defined as repeated attacks of airway obstruction and intermittent symptoms of increased airway responsiveness to triggering factors, such as exercise, allergen exposure, and viral infection. The children were asked about shortness of breath (day or night), fatigue, not feeling well, and specific triggers. E3 Moreover, parents and children were asked to fill diary cards at home 3 times a week on a predetermined time frame. The child's symptom score for the last 24 hours was defined as follows: 0, none; 1, mild, 2, moderate; and 3, severe. When the symptoms were level 4 and higher and there was a decrease in FEV 1 of greater than 15% or peak expiratory flow (PEF) of greater than 30%, the parents were asked to contact the doctor. Inclusion criteria for the cases were as follows: written informed consent from the child's parent/guardian; age 4 to 6 years; gestational age of 36 weeks or greater; a diagnosis of asthma within the last 2 years confirmed by a doctor of the participating study center; mild-to-moderate persistent severity according to Global Initiative for Asthma 2005 guidelines; 3 episodes in the preceding 12 months; and capacity of the child to perform a PEF maneuver. For examination, the doctor performed lung function measurements, made a clinical investigation (auscultation), and asked the parent/guardian to fill out a questionnaire. Healthy children of the same age with no reported history of asthma/wheeze, atopic illness, or both were recruited at baseline and at the end of the observation period. Exclusion criteria were severe/brittle asthma; children receiving immunotherapy; more than 6 courses of oral steroids during the preceding 12 months; other chronic respiratory diseases (cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and immunodeficiencies), except allergic rhinitis; and other chronic diseases with continuous medication use, except atopic eczema. Differentiation of asthma bronchiale from bronchiolitis was done mainly based on the clinical diagnosis and additionally mostly based on the presence of rhinovirus in the PCR samples of the nasal swabs. Bronchiolitis in Europe is an inflammatory disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus/rhinovirus infection with tachypnea and diffuse fine crackles, and oxygen is needed in some of these children. Other wheezing disorders could be anatomically defined, such as stenosis in the airways, hemangioma in the larynx, double aortic arch, and vascular ring/sling. The character of these disorders is continuous and less repetitive, and there are no or few effects of bronchial dilatators.
