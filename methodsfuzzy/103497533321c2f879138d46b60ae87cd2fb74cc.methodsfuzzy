Production of norovirus P domain and VLPs. The GI.1 P domain (Norwalk virus, GenBank accession no. M87661.1) was produced as previously described (12) . Briefly, the P domain was cloned into a modified expression vector (pMal-c2X) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells, which were grown in LB medium for 2 h at 37°C. Expression was induced with 0.7 mM isopropyl thio-␤-Dgalactopyranoside (IPTG) (OD 600 , 0.6) for 18 h at 22°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication on ice. The His-tagged fusion-P domain protein was purified from a Ni column (Qiagen) and digested with HRV-3C protease (Novagen) overnight at 4°C. The cleaved P domain was separated on the Ni column and dialyzed in gel filtration buffer (GFB; 25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6] and 300 mM NaCl) overnight at 4°C. The P domain was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography, concentrated to 4 mg/ml in GFB, and then stored at 4°C. For the production of norovirus VLPs, VP1 of GI.1 (GenBank accession no. AY502016.1, strain West Chester), GI.2 (GenBank accession no. AB078335, strain Funabashi258), GI.2 (GenBank accession no. L07418, strain Southampton), GI.3 (GenBank accession no. BD011871, strain Kashiwa645), GI.4 (GenBank accession no. AB042808, strain Chiba407), and GI.11 (GenBank accession no. AB058547, strain #8) was expressed in insect cells (45, 46) . The capsid sequence of the GI.1 VLPs (West Chester) used to immunize the alpaca was closely related (11 amino acids difference) to the sequence of the determined Norwalk virus VLP structure (PDB ID 1IHM). Production of Nanobodies. Nano-7, Nano-62, and Nano-94 were produced as previously described at the VIB Nanobody Service Facility with the approval of the ethics commission of Vrije Universiteit, Brussels, Belgium (13) . Briefly, a single alpaca was injected subcutaneously with GI.1 VLPs. A VHH library was constructed and screened for the presence of antigen-specific Nanobodies. The Nanobodies were subcloned into a pHEN6C expression vector and expressed in E. coli WK6 cells overnight at 28°C. Expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG at an OD 600 of 0.9. The Nanobodies were extracted from periplasm and the supernatant collected. Nanobodies were eluted from a Ni column after a series of washing steps and purified by size-exclusion chromatography. Nanobodies were concentrated to 2 to 3 mg/ml and stored in GFB. Direct ELISA. Microtiter plates (MaxiSorp; Thermo Scientific) were coated with 100 l/well (5 g/ml) of GI.1 P domain or VLPs for 1 h at 37°C. Plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and subsequently blocked with 5% skimmed milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Nano-62 or Nano-94 was serially diluted (1:1) with PBS, starting at 100 g/ml, applied to the washed ELISA plates, and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Nanobodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody against polyhistidine (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:4,000 in PBS. Plates were washed and then developed with o-phenylenediamine and H 2 O 2 (OPD buffer) in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the reaction was stopped with 6% (vol/vol) HCl, and absorption at 490 nm (OD 490 ) was measured. A cutoff limit was set at OD 490 of Ͼ0.15, which was ϳ3 times the value of the PBS negative control (3, 47) . Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed using an ITC-200 (Malvern, UK). Samples were dialyzed into PBS and filtered prior to the titration experiments. Titrations were performed at 35°C (Nano-7), 30°C (Nano-62), or 25°C (Nano-94) by injecting consecutive (0.5 l for Nano-7 and 2 l for both Nano-62 and Nano-94) aliquots of Nanobody (150 M) into GI.1 P domain (15 M) with 150-s intervals. The binding data were corrected for the heat of dilution and fit to a one-site binding model to calculate the equilibrium binding constant, K A , and the binding parameters, N and ΔH (change in enthalpy). Binding sites were assumed to be identical. Crystallization of norovirus P domain and Nanobody complexes. The GI.1 P domain was mixed separately at a 1:1.4 molar ratio with the Nano-7, Nano-62, and Nano-94, and the complexes were incubated for 2 h at 25°C. Each complex was purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex-200 column and concentrated to 4.6 mg/ml. The complex crystals were grown using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. For GI.1 Nano-62 and GI.1 Nano-94, the mother solution contained 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 5.5) and 20% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol 3000 (PEG-3000) for 3 to 7 days at 18°C. For GI.1 Nano-7, crystals were grown in mother solution containing 0.17 M ammonium acetate, 0.085 M sodium citrate (pH 5.6), 15% (vol/vol) glycerol, and 25.5% (wt/vol) PEG-4000. Prior to flashfreezing in liquid nitrogen, single crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant containing the mother liquor with or without 30% ethylene glycol. Data collection, structure solution, and refinement. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, France, at beamlines ID23-1, ID29, and ID30A-3 and processed with XDS (48). The GI.1 P domains in complex with Nano-7, Nano-62, and Nano-94 were solved using molecular replacement with the GI.1 P domain (PDB ID 2ZL5) and a previously determined Nanobody (PDB ID 4KRN) as search models in Phaser (49) . The complex structures were refined in multiple rounds of manual model building in Coot (50) and refined with Phenix (51). Structures were validated with Coot and MolProbity (52) . The PDBePISA server was used to determine binding interfaces and calculate the surface area. The binding interactions were analyzed using Accelrys Discovery Studio, with hydrogen bonding interaction distances between 2.4 and 3.5 Å and hydrophobic interaction distances between 3.9 and 5.3 Å. Figures and protein contact potentials were generated using PyMOL (https://pymol.org). Dynamic light scattering. The hydrodynamic size of VLPs was analyzed using dynamic light scattering (DLS) with a Zetasizer Nano S system (Malvern). The VLPs and Nanobodies (10 l/10 l) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, diluted in 1 ml of distilled water, and then measured. Measurements were performed at 25°C in three runs with 15 measurement cycles. Electron microcopy. The norovirus VLP morphology (treated and untreated) was analyzed using negative-stain electron microscopy (EM), as previously described (13) . Nanobodies (1 mg/ml) and VLPs (1 mg/ml) were mixed in equal volumes and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Prior to loading on carbon-coated EM grids, samples were quickly diluted 30 times with distilled water. The grids were washed with distilled water and stained with 1% uranyl acetate. The grids were examined on a Zeiss 910 electron microscope. HBGA-blocking assay. The binding of GI.1 VLPs to porcine gastric mucin (PGM) type III (containing HBGAs) was previously determined (20) . For the blocking assay, microtiter plates (MaxiSorp; Thermo Scientific) were coated with 100 l/well of PGM (10 g/ml; Sigma) for 1 h at 37°C. The plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and subsequently blocked with 5% skimmed milk in PBS for 1.5 h at room temperature. Nano-7, Nano-62, or Nano-94 was serially diluted in PBS and then added to GI.1 VLPs (final concentration, 0.5 g/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. The plates were washed three times with PBS-T, and then 100 l of each VLP-Nanobody mixture was added to triplicate wells for 1 h at 37°C. After washing, 100 l of GI.1-specific biotinylated Nanobody 60 (Nano-60) (20) was added. Following a washing step, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin monoclonal antibody was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Plates were washed and then developed with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) and H 2 O 2 in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the reaction was stopped with 3 N HCl, and the absorbance at 490 nm (OD 490 ) was measured. Nano-62 (GI negative control) and 2=FL (GI positive control) were used as controls in each experiment. The OD 490 value of the untreated VLPs was set as the reference value corresponding to 100% binding. The percentage of inhibition was calculated as [1 Ϫ (treated VLP mean OD 490 /mean reference OD 490 )] ϫ 100. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) was determined using the Prism software (version 6.0) (14) . All experiments with PGM binding were performed in triplicate, and standard deviations were calculated. For the dual Nano-7/Nano-94 and 2=FL treatment, a similar approach was performed, except that the serial dilutions of Nano-7/Nano-94 were combined with constant concentrations of 2=FL (final concentrations, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mM). In a similar assay, blocking of GII.10 attachment to PGM by a combination of Nano-85 and 2=FL was examined. In this assay, incubation times and temperatures differed slightly due to the different VLPs used. Coating was performed for 4 h at room temperature, blocking was done at 4°C overnight, and the treated VLPs with Nano-85-2=FL were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The GII.10 VLPs were detected using polyclonal anti-GII.10 rabbit antibodies (1 h at room temperature) and polyclonal anti-rabbit-HRP conjugate (1 h at room temperature) (47) . Bliss independence calculation. To evaluate the interaction of Nano-7 and Nano-94 with 2=FL, Bliss independence was employed for data analysis of the HBGA-blocking assays (36, 53) . This model assumes a stochastic process in which both compounds contribute to the final result but act independently by targeting different sites. The expected additive effect ͑E NanobodyϪ2'FL ͒ can be calculated based on the probability of the independent blocking activities of 2=FL and Nanobody ͑E Nanobody and E 2'FL ͒ with the following equation, where 0 Յ E Nanobody Յ 1 and 0 Յ E 2'FL Յ 1: E NanobodyϪ2'FL ϭ E Nanobody ϩ E 2'FL -E Nanobody ϫ E 2'FL A comparison of the calculated expected additive effect to the observed results demonstrates how the drugs interact with each other. If zero interaction applies, the effects of the two drugs are additive, and as a consequence, the measured values of drug combination are close to the calculated theoretical additivity values. If the observed combination values are 20% above the expected additivity values, synergistic effects are implied, and if the observed values are 20% below the expected additivity, antagonism is implied. To determine if the difference between the expected additivity and our observed inhibition was statistically significant, we performed a paired two-tailed t test for all single data points and two-way ANOVA. Data availability. Atomic coordinates and structure factors of the complexes were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession numbers 6H6Y for the GI.1 P domain-Nano-7 complex, 6H6Z for the GI.1 P domain-Nano-62 complex, and 6H71 for the GI.1 P domain-Nano-94 complex.
