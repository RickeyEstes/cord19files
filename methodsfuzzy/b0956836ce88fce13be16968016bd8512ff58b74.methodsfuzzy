Survey questionnaires were designed for both SARS cases and contactors. A retrospective survey was employed to investigate relevant individuals one by one. A sampling survey was conducted for the individuals isolated for medical observation in Haidian district. Survey of transmission chain. Information was collected by medical record review, and facetoface and telephone interview. With cases C and A as two index cases, their secondary generations, close contactors and informants were surveyed individually in detail following the clues provided by their family members. Contact history and symptom development of the contactors were recorded in detail. Those left without symptom filled in the contactor survey questionnaire. Relation with the index case, times and routes of contact within four days prior to hyperthermia, and the time when a proper treatment was initiated for each contactor in close contact with SARS, were determined by the known average incubation period of SARS [3] with their disease outcomes monitored. Survey of isolated individuals. Haidian district is geographically divided into eastern, western, southern, northern and central sections. One neighborhood (residential community) where a cluster of residents were isolated for medical observation was selected in each section. The universal questionnaires were distributed to individuals isolated for medical observation by the Neighborhood Committee and subjects for medical observation were selected by the SARS Prevention and Treatment Office under the Committee. The surveyed individuals themselves filled in the questionnaire. In case the subject was unable to fill in the questionnaires by himself/herself, another individual was appointed on his/her behalf. Following the principle of voluntary testing, a venous blood sample (10 mL) was taken from each close contactor with cases C and Z, two super transmitters in the chain of transmission triggered by case C. Sera were separated. Each sample was tested by neutralization test and ELISA for SARSCoV antibody. Plotting diagrams of transmission chains. Diagrams of the transmission chains were plotted following the two lines of family and hospital. Subsequent illness onset of contactors with different generations of cases were calculated. Plotting diagrams of contact history analyses. Contactors involved in the surveys were divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, based on their infection outcomes. Diagrams of contact history analysis were plotted for each group. The diagram had a horizontal axis with the day when hyperthermia of the SARS case started as day 0, and the bar shadow perpendicular to the horizontal axis was drawn for the day. Values for each day before hyperthermia were minus, marked with days 1, 2, 3, and 4. Otherwise the values were positive, marked with days 1, 2, and 3. A line was drawn for each contactor between the starting and end points of contact with his or her previous generation of the infected. Infectivity analysis. The secondary attack rate via contact was calculated for each close contactor based on the time of hyperthermia occurrence while having contact with SARS cases.
