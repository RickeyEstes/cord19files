For experiments involving pregnant and non-pregnant mice, 3-4 mice were included in each assessment group to ensure representation and consistency of the data. All data were analyzed using Prism6 software (GraphPad). Statistical evaluation was performed by Student's unpaired t test. Data were presented as mean Â± SEM. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; and ***p < 0.001.
