Fifty Belgian white-blue male calves, purchased from the market at about 10 days of age, were assigned to one of three treatment groups based on live weight and conformation. The same commercial milk replacer, calf starter and grass hay were fed similarly to the individually penned calves. Calves of the control group (1) received the basic diet. Calves of Groups 2 and 3 received either 2 g immunoglobulins (Ig) or 25 ml pooled colostral milk (CO) twice daily, respectively, via the milk replacer during the initial 3 weeks. Milk replacer was composed of 60% skim milk powder in order to obtain an EEC subsidy for feed manufacturers, and contained 50 ppm zinc bacitracin and 20 ppm virginiamycin. Ig were isolated from whey by a dairy factory via column chromatography. Colostral milk was pooled milk from the first six milkings postpartum. Ig content averaged 44 mg ml-1. Calves were weaned when daily starter consumption averaged 0.5 kg over 7 consecutive days. Maximum starter allowance amounted to 3 kg per day, while grass hay was offered ad libitum. Chemical composition of the feeds and net energy content is given in Table 1 . Energy content of starter and hay was assessed as described by Cottyn et al. (1987) . At the start of the experiment and at monthly intervals, blood samples were collected to study the effect on immunoglobulin concentration. Serum Ig de- termination was carried out using liquid chromatography (FPLC-Pharmacia apparatus) and calculated via an external Ig-standard solution. During the initial 4 weeks, faecal samples were taken to detect excretion of corona-and rotaviruses and Cryptosporidium. Antigens were determined via immunodiffusion for rotavirus (Vanopdenbosch et al., 1978) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for corona virus (Vanopdenbosch et al., 1985) . The presence of Cryptosporidium was detected by the carbol fuchsin method (Peeters et al., 1982) . At autopsy, viral antigens were evidenced by direct immunofluorescence in organ sections. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K99 was detected using two methods: (1) indirect immunofluorescence (Lintermans and Pohl, 1984) ; (2) isolation on a Minca glucose medium after an incubation at 37 Â° C for 24 h and identification by slide agglutination with K99 antiserum (Girardeau et al., 1979) . The experiment lasted 20 weeks. Effect on live-weight gain, feed intake, virus and Cryptosporidium excretion, diarrhoea and mortality was investigated.
