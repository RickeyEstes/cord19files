All PBMC and plasma samples used in this study were collected on the first day of presentation from individuals aged 6 months to 14 years with primary (1 ; 53 samples) or secondary (2 ; 46 samples) acute, symptomatic DENV-3 infection during the 2009-2010 epidemic season in Managua, Nicaragua (Tables 1  and S1 ) (Narvaez et al., 2011) . The majority of PBMC (82%) and plasma (91%) samples were from individuals who presented with DF. The rest of the PBMC (18%) and plasma (9%) samples were from individuals who presented with DHF/DSS. Supporting clinical information is provided in Table S1 . The DENV-3 genome was amplified via reverse transcription and PCR using sequence-specific primer pairs to generate 12 overlapping amplicons per sample ( Figure S1A ). Multiplexed libraries for high-throughput sequencing were constructed from pooled amplicon mixes and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform to yield 150-nucleotide (nt) paired-end reads in forward (read 1) and reverse (read 2) orientations. Reference genomes were reconstructed for each sample using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and SAMtools (Li et al., 2009) , and in-house python scripts were used to calculate variation at the nucleotide, codon, and amino acid levels for each locus in the DENV-3 coding region (see STAR Methods). After filtering for coverage (R1,000 reads) and Sanger quality scores (R30), median coverage per codon locus was 22,975 and 20,024 for read 1 and read 2 datasets, respectively. Only samples with R50% coverage of the DENV-3 genome were retained for downstream analyses; 68 PBMC and 31 plasma samples from 77 individuals, including paired PBMC-plasma datasets from 22 individuals, passed the threshold for genome coverage. Coding-region coverage in these samples varied between 50.7% and 99.9% (median of 98.9%) for both read 1 and read 2 datasets combined (Table S1) . Percent variant diversity at nucleotide, codon, and amino acid loci was calculated as the percent of reads spanning each coordinate that was different from consensus. Nucleotide-and codon-level diversities provide aggregate measures of both non-synonymous and synonymous mutations (i.e., mutations that do and do not change amino acid encoding, respectively), while amino acid diversity only captures non-synonymous mutations. In our study, variant abundances of R1.0% were reproducible across replicates (see STAR Methods) and were considered variants of high confidence. Unless otherwise specified, we used high-confidence variants for investigating diversity patterns. Samples from both sexes were included in all intrahost diversity comparisons; no significant differences between sexes were observed for any of the calculated DENV-3 intrahost diversity metrics (data not shown).
