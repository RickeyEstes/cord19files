Human serum samples. All methods were carried out in accordance with CDC's institutional review board (IRB) guidelines and regulations. All protocols were approved by CDC's IRB. All patients were hospitalized with pneumonia symptoms, gave informed consent, and their respiratory specimens were tested by rRT-PCR to determine etiology. Paired acute and convalescent phase human sera collected from individuals whose respiratory specimens were tested positive for hCoV-229E (n = 4), hCoV-NL63 (N = 9), hCoV-OC43 (n = 21), and hCoV-HKU1 (n = 14), by rRT-PCR, were included in a positive control panel for the study. Human sera from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV (n = 5) and MERS-CoV infections (n = 7), tested during outbreak investigation by our laboratory, were also included to the positive control panel. Acute sera were collected upon hospital admission, and convalescent phase sera were obtained 3-7 weeks later. From this panel of positive sera, convalescent phase sera exhibiting â‰¥ 4 fold increase in IgG titers, were pooled together to create a positive control for each hCoV recN. Similarly, acute and convalescent phase human sera, collected from individuals with acute respiratory illness whose respiratory specimens tested negative for all six hCoVs by real-time RT-PCR and exhibited no IgG reactivity when screened by in-house hCoV recN enzyme immunoassays, were included to create a negative control panel.
