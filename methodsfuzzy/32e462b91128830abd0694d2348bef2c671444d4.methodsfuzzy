Fifth-instar larvae of C. pomonella were fed one of three granulosis virus inocula. These were supplied by J. P Harvey and had been previously biochemically characterized and designated as CPGV-MB, CPGV-MD, and CPGV-R (Harvey and Volkman, 1983) . After initial observations, it was determined that all specimens produced similar pathogenicity at the electron microscope level and therefore all specimens were viewed collectively within each time interval studied. Larvae were fed 2-mm cubes of diet on which 20 p,l of CMGV at a protein concentration of 24.5 to 25 kg/ml had been deposited. Control larvae were fed diet inoculated with 20 ~1 of distilled water. Additional control larvae were fed diet alone. After the diet cube was completely ingested (between 15 min and 1 hr), fresh diet was added and timing of the experiment for that larvae began. Twelve to fifteen larvae were maintained at 20Â°C and sampled at 24, 32, 48, 56, and 72 hr postinoculation in a series of two experiments. Tissue, including the midgut, fat body, and epidermis, were immersed in 2.5% phosphatebuffered glutaraldehyde, pH 7.0, for 1 to 2 hr and subsequently postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (phosphate buffered, pH 7.0) for 1 hr. Samples were embedded in Araldite 6005 after dehydration in ethanol. Sections, stained with saturated aqueous uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate, were examined in a Philips EM 300 electron microscope.
