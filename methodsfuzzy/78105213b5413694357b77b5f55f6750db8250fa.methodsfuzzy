Multiwell plates (ie, 24-well assay plates) of mouse liver cells were seeded at least 1 day prior to the start of the assay procedure. On the day of the virucidal assay, an amount of 0.3 mL of virus stock was spread over a 28-cm 2 area marked on the underside of a hard, nonporous Petri dish and allowed to dry for 30 to 50 minutes at room temperature until a white, dry film was apparent. A list of the products tested, the dilutions used during testing, and the yielding concentrations are outlined in Table 1 . The products were chosen by the varying active ingredients. Those test substance samples that required diluting were prepared using sterile deionized water. The dilutions were performed based on manufacturer's instructions, except for the liquid hand soap, which was diluted further to reduce its viscosity. The contact time for all products was modified to 30 seconds. For each sample tested, 2 mL of test substance was applied directly to the virus film. Aerosolized products were used according to manufacturer's directions. At the 30-second contact time, 0.2 mL of the virus/test substance mixture was neutralized into 1.8 mL of media with 2% serum and serial 10-fold dilutions were performed. A total of 0.2 mL of each dilution was then inoculated into each of 4 wells containing the host cells. The assay plates were incubated at 378C 6 2.58C supplemented with 5% CO 2 , and the cells were observed for toxicity or characteristic viral cytopathogenic effect at a minimum of over 7 nights by looking at the plates through an inverted microscope (Olympus Tokyo Inverted CK at 103 magnification, Olympus, Center Valley, PA) throughout the assay. The viral cytopathogenic effect was characterized by a degenerated cell sheet and cell detachment. To monitor the general health of the cells in each experiment, control wells containing cells grown in the absence of virus and product were observed throughout the course of the assay period. All tests were repeated 5 times with virus and toxicity controls. Infectious dose titers were determined by the Reed and Muench tissue culture infective dose (TCID) 50 end point method. 8, 9 A minimum of 4 replicates were performed for each dilution. Several dilutions were used to quantify the virus titer and statistically determine the TCID 50 end point. 9 To express the titer in infectious units per unit volume, the reciprocal was taken and divided by the amount used for inoculation into the test wells. The end point of the test replicates was averaged between 2 replicates and then subtracted from the viral titer log recovery to determine the log reduction of each test substance.
