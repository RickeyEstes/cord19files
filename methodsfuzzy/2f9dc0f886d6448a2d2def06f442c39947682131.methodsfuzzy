In order to ensure that the list of diseases prioritized under the R&D Blueprint is as accurate as possible, WHO developed a comprehensive methodology based upon established best practices and practical national experience in compiling similar lists. The resulting methodology also specifically addressed criticism of earlier attempts to prioritize diseases. The general approach and key criteria were identified at the December 2015 consultation (WHO, 2015) . These were subsequently expanded by WHO, and an outline of the eventual methodology was presented to, and validated by, the R&D Blueprint Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) in May 2016. Following input from the SAG, the methodology was further developed to include specific disease scenarios, a series of sub-criteria to explore different factors that could affect the relevance of a disease to R&D Blueprint objectives. WHO also developed the tools for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) through a custom implementation of an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), developed in collaboration with leaders in the field. The entire methodology, its supporting models and attendant tools were reviewed at a dedicated consultation in November 2016 (WHO, 2016b) . The meeting validated a general approach, endorsing a system of annual reviews, biennial methodology reviews, supplemented as necessary with emergency reviews. The annual reviews use a combination of rounds of the Delphi technique, questionnaires and MCDA to review and update the R&D Blueprint's priority list of diseases (Fig. 1) . Following their revision in light of feedback, insights and recommendations received at the meeting, the tools and models were subsequently validated via a silence procedure in January 2017. The resulting methodology was published on the WHO website (WHO, 2017a) and a peer-reviewed journal (Mehand et al., 2018) . After its first full implementation, WHO carried out an assessment of the prioritization methodology. This assessment demonstrated: (a) the ranking produced was robust across different sensitivity scenarios; (b) similar group ranking was generated using three different approaches; and (c) the criterion "availability of medical countermeasures" had very little impact on the final ranking despite a high weight (Mehand et al., 2018; WHO, 2017b) . As a result, the prioritization criteria and subcriteria were updated (Table 1 ). Furthermore, to address possible biases, WHO developed a more comprehensive procedure for input from regional offices and expanded the range of experts proposing diseases for inclusion and participating in the annual review. The updated methodology will undergo a comprehensive review later in 2018 or 2019.
