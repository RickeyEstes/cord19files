The alignment of multilamellar membranes is quantified by the distribution function of the membrane normal vectors, which are directed along the z axis perpendicular to the solid substrate on which the membranes are deposited. The central width of this distribution is called mosaicity. A narrow distribution or equivalently small mosaicity allows for a precise distinction between the scattering vector components, vertical (q z ) and parallel (q k ) to the lipid bilayer. Thereby, the multilamellar state of the samples, which can be almost fully hydrated by controlled relative humidity (Aeffner et al. 2009 ), provides a tremendous amplification of the scattering signal compared to single bilayer preparations. However, compared to single bilayer reflectivity, the multilamellar stacks usually impede the determination of the electron density q(z) on an absolute scale, unless a full q-range fit of the electron density is performed (Constantin et al. 2003) . In principle, an ideal small-angle scattering experiment with respect to distribution, concentration, and structural integrity of the peptide species can yield multiple structural parameters (Fig. 1) . The reflection geometry for aligned lipid films (Fig. 1i ) is suited to determine the vertical density profile q(z) of the bilayers, averaged in the xy plane, e.g., by least-square fitting of the specular reflectivity curve (Constantin et al. 2003) . The specular peaks are accompanied by diffuse scattering in the form of so-called Bragg sheets extending along q k . This scattering contribution can be assigned to lateral inhomogeneities at mesoscopic length scales (nanometers to a few micrometers) due to membrane fluctuations-always present in the fluid/ hydrated state-and peptide insertions causing local orientational disorders (Fig. 1ii) , which break the lateral translation invariance. While the vertical electron density distributions may also be obtained by fitting the diffuse Bragg sheet intensities of the reciprocal space for a single angle of incidence, we have used full scans with background correction (Fig. 1iii ) in reflectivity mode (Fig. 1iv) . The lateral membrane structure at molecular length scales is accessible via the grazing incidence diffraction (GID) scattering geometry, at which the 2D detector (CCD camera) is moved out of the plane of incidence at grazing incidence and exit angles. The lipid chain correlation peak (Fig. 1v) is usually stretched around a circle with the radius q = (q k 2 ? q z 2 ) 1/2 % 1.4 Å -1 reflecting the distribution of acyl chain tilt angles with respect to the bilayer normal. The radial profile of the peak has a Lorentzian lineshape with a peak position corresponding to the inverse nearestneighbor distance of chains and its width reflecting the lateral correlation length (see below). This peak is often broadened upon peptide insertion. A lateral correlation of membrane-inserted structures, e.g., a regular oligomerization as known from pore arrangements, can be detected and characterized from ''superstructure peaks'' (Constantin et al. 2007 ) in the small-angle region at low q z (Fig. 1vi ). In addition, the conformation of the reconstituted peptide's structure can in some cases be deduced from the low q k signal of molecular form factors, the so-called helix maximum (Fig. 1vii) , or from helix peaks revealing intrahelical distances at high q k (not shown) as it has been revealed for the regularly organized and conformationally constrained alamethicin single helix (Spaar and Salditt 2003) . As we are interested in a general approach including a side-directed iodine-labeling for the reflectivity studies (Arbely et al. 2004) , the present work focuses on data recording and analysis, as can be applied for any peptide/ lipid sample. Fig. 1 Schematic representation of the reciprocal space for multilamellar membrane stacks (i) as a function of the parallel (q k ) and normal (q z ) components of the momentum transfer (q). The scheme shows the reflection geometry known as grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GISAXS) at small q k or grazing incidence diffraction (GID) at high q k . The recorded patterns include the diffuse Bragg sheets (ii) in the vicinity of the (specular) q z axis. In this study the q z components (iii) were measured by line scanning under specular conditions (iv). At low q z , the lipid acyl chain correlation maximum (v) is observed. Lorentzian fits yield the lateral lipid chain distance. The width of the acyl chain peak along q k gives information about the lipid ordering (correlation length); the angular width of the peak corresponds to the acyl chain tilt. In addition, superstructures (vi) and peptide geometries (helix maximum, vii) can be observed in some cases Eur Biophys J (2011) 40:417-436 419 Design of the b-type peptide helix motif In contrast to well established, commercially available peptide species, we concentrate our studies on a recently reported peptide model that was designed for spanning the membrane hydrophobic core and anchoring at the membrane/water interface. Therefore, this motif holds a tunable, conformationally stable peptide structure that is open for multiple functionalization ). The D,L alternation of the peptide backbone concordant with a double-helical b-type shape is related to natural peptide antibiotics such as gramicidin A (Kelkar and Chattopadhyay 2007) or feglymycin (Bunkóczi et al. 2005) . In addition, the studied sequences are unique on their own due to their almost purely aromatic side-chain composition (Alexopoulos et al. 2004; Küsel et al. 2007 ). On the basis of the crystallographically elucidated watersoluble nonameric sequence H-(Tyr-Tyr) 4 -Lys-OH (note: underlined amino acids indicate the D-conformer), the homodimeric dodecamer H-(Phe-Tyr) 5 -Trp-Trp-OH (1) (Fig. 2a, b ) and the covalently linked hairpin species H-(Phe-Tyr) 5 -Trp-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Gly-(Phe-Tyr) 5 Trp-Trp-OH (2) and H-Lys(NBD)-Tyr-(Phe-Tyr) 4 -Trp-Trp-Gly-Lys-([C 2 H 4 O] 2 -CH 2 -CO-gcgtgg-Lys-Lys)-Pro-Gly-(Phe-Tyr) 5 -Trp-Trp-OH (3) (Fig. 2a) (note: gcgtgg represents the nucleobase sequence of aminoethylglycine peptide nucleic acid monomers) were derived via synthetic modification applying solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and loop design . The transmembrane helices of the latter structures (1-3) are well adapted to the membrane environment as optimized by sequence variation in length and composition (Küsel et al. 2007 ). Through the execution of design studies of the peptide substrates, the preservation of the b 5.6 helical structure ( Fig. 2b ; the superscript denotes the periodicity of the helix), as found for the homodimeric species 1, was maintained for the final hairpin prototype 2 via constant comparison of the respective circular dichroism data resulting from several tested constructs . As there has been strong evidence for a conformational and monomer-dimer equilibrium of the homodimeric structure 1 involving antiparallel oriented b 5.6 double and b 6.3 single helices (Fig. 2c , i-iii) (Küsel et al. 2007 ), a covalent linkage of both strands seemed to be mandatory in order to circumvent the described equilibria. This goal was fulfilled through the synthesis of the peptide hairpin 2 (Fig. 2c , iv) allowing for further studies that address peptide oligomerization within lipid model membrane complexes. The helix assembly is, thereby, driven by molecular recognition of the peptide nucleic acid (PNA) moieties at the membrane's exterior (Fig. 2c, v-vi; . The attachment of fluorescence probes and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) recognition moieties led to functional constructs, such as compound 3, that have already been tested for their dynamic dimerization within lipid bilayer structures via Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays ). a b c Fig. 2 Molecular representation of the different D,L-alternating peptide types (a) ranging from the homodimeric species 1 to the designed hairpin 2 to the functionalized construct 3. Furthermore, the molecular structure of the homodimer 1 (b) (Küsel et al. 2007 ) as well as proposed equilibria (c) are sketched, either for homodimeric structures (i)-(iii) or the PNA-equipped transmembrane domains of 3 (v)-(vi) that undergo oligomerization driven by molecular recognition at the membrane's exterior Here, we probe the membrane reconstitution of the three presented kinds of b-helical species via GID and reciprocal space mapping (RSM) and evaluate their influence on the lateral lipid packing by addressing the lipid chain correlation peak. In the respective studies, parameters such as the sample composition, the relative humidity (RH), and the peptide-to-lipid (P/L) ratio are varied. The obtained results can be explained by a qualitative model that predominantly takes into account a hydrophobic mismatch situation as well as a lateral packing and ordering of the annular lipid shell that is correlated to the extent of peptide-lipid contact surface. Furthermore, we analyze the differentially (double) iodine-labeled hairpin species of type 2 via anomalous and in-house reflectivity elucidating their positioning with respect to the membrane normal (z axis) and confirming their transmembrane orientation. These experiments created the basis for a functional FRET assay that was reported elsewhere .
