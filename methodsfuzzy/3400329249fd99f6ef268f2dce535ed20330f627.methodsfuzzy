Animals. Conventional, colostrum-fed 7±14 days old male Jersey calves were purchased from two self-supplementary herds and reared in isolation units following normal management procedures for dairy calves. Before challenge, all calves were tested as previously described (Rùnsholt et al., 1996) for persistent infection with bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVDV), and all animals were negative. Inoculations. The BRSV inoculum consisted of a third or fourth passage of BRSV isolate 2022 in fetal bovine lung cell culture (FBL) or of uninfected FBL cultures (mock infection (controls)). The original BRSV material was lung lavage¯uid from a 1-monthold ®eld calf with severe BRSV-related pneumonia (Viuff et al., 1996) , and was passaged once in a 1-month-old colostrum-deprived calf before inoculation into FBL cells. The inocula were tested for and found free from other viruses, bacteria and Mycoplasma spp. as described in Tjùrnehùj (2000) . The calves were inoculated once by combined aerosol exposure (Waechtomat inhalator VM 82, most droplets less than 3 mm) and intratracheal injection. The inoculum (5 ml in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) was administered over 10 min through a mask covering nostrils and mouth. The intratracheal inoculum (20 ml in PBS) was injected into the trachea during provoked heavy inhalation. The dose was 10 4.6 ±10 5.2 TCID 50 of BRSV in each type of inoculation. Control calves and BRSV-infected calves were kept in separate isolation rooms during challenge. Clinical signs were monitored daily. Unstabilized blood samples (approximately 8 ml) were obtained by jugular venipuncture using Veno-ject tubes. The blood was allowed to clot at 48C, and serum was extracted the following day and stored at À208C. Calves were regularly blood sampled for up to 15 days after infection (see Fig. 1 ) and then euthanised. In one experiment (Fig. 1B) where the calves were blood sampled daily, all animals received 2.5 mg enro¯oxacin (Baytril 1 , Bayer) per kilogram body weight from the day before BRSV-infection until euthanasia. Post-infection analyses. Maximal temperature and days with fever (i.e. rectal temperature above 39.28C) were recorded. Post-mortem analyses. Calves were anaesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and euthanized by bleeding out through V. axillaris or V. iliaca externa. The lungs were immediately removed, and macroscopic lesions scored between 0 and 5 as described by Tjùrnehùj (2000) . Tissue from the right lung of all calves was tested for the presence of BRSV, BVDV, parain¯uenza 3 virus, and bovine corona virus as described by Uttenthal et al. (1996) . Lung-, spleen-and liver-samples from all calves were investigated for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria by conventional techniques, and bronchial swabs were examined for Mycoplasma spp. by culture. Serum haptoglobin was determined by a monoclonal antibody-based capture ELISA as described previously (Godson et al., 1996) . Brie¯y, to coat plates with antibody, ascites uid containing monoclonal antibody (1D1) to bovine haptoglobin, diluted to 1/1000 in 0.05 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.3), was added to Immulon II microtitre plates (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) and incubated at 48C overnight. Plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and blocked for 1 h with PBST plus 0.5% gelatin. Sera were diluted in PBST (1/100, 1/300, and 1/900) and incubated in the plate overnight. All incubations were carried out at room temperature and all incubation volumes were 100 ml. After washing, the biotinylated IgG of the monoclonal antibody 1D1 (0.5 mg/ml) (prepared as described in Godson et al. (1996) ) was added to the plates for 2 h. Detection of bound antibody was accomplished by addition of a 1/2000 dilution of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Gibco/BRL) for 2 h, followed by washing and the addition of the color substrate p-nitrophenylphosphate di(TRIS) salt (Sigma) in 0.5 mM MgCl 2 (pH 9.8) with 1% diethanolamine. Absorbance was measured on a Bio-Rad 3550 microplate reader at a wavelength of 405 nm (reference wavelength 490 nm). The concentration of haptoglobin in serum samples was determined by comparison of absorbances to a standard curve generated from dilutions of antibody af®nity-puri®ed bovine haptoglobin (Godson et al., 1996) . The detection limit of the assay was de®ned as two times the standard deviation of the background OD. Serum amyloid A was determined by a commercially obtained ELISA kit (Phase SAA kit, Tridelta) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This is a sandwich type assay in which sera were diluted 1/500 with the kit diluent and applied together with biotinylated anti-SAA antibody and incubated for 1 h at 378C. After washing in kit wash buffer, streptavidin-peroxidase was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before wash and colour development with the tetramethylbenzidine substrate of the kit. Colour was stopped with the stop reagent and read at 490 nm with 650 nm as background correction. All plates included the kit standard in ®ve dilutions, ranging from 2.3 to 37.5 ng/ml and a blind sample. All samples were run in duplicate.
