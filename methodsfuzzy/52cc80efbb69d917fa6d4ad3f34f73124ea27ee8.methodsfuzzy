National clinic survey data A cross-sectional survey was emailed to the 423 registered veterinary practices in New Zealand on 25 May 2016 to collect quantitative data on in-house testing and vaccination for FeLV and FIV performed during the 2015 calendar year. Veterinarians were also asked to provide their opinions on the safety, efficacy and cost of FeLV vaccines using Likert-scale ratings and free-text comment fields. A reminder email was sent to all veterinary practices 1 month after the initial email and then a hard copy of the survey was mailed to the remaining non-responders 2 weeks later. The survey closed on 25 September 2016 with a total of 112 responses. A full copy of the survey is available from the corresponding author upon request.
