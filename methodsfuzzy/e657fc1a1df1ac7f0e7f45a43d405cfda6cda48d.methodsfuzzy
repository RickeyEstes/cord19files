To establish a reliable platform for lipidomic analysis, we first validated the lipid coverage and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system stability. We applied 15 representative lipid internal standards that covered 14 lipid classes in the current study (Table S1 ) [14] . The retention time shift and mass accuracy of lipid standards ranged from −0.12%-4.73% and −7.7-4.13 ppm, respectively. The coefficient of variation (CV) of all internal standards in cell samples and the QC samples were lower than 18% and 15%, respectively. These results indicated that the operation repeatability was satisfactory. To evaluate the stability of the analytical batch, the CV values of all mass features in the quality control (QC) samples were calculated. A total of 98.70% and 93.32% of the features measured in the negative and positive mode, respectively, exhibited CV values of <30%, indicating that the analytical batch was stable with minimal variations. Taken together, these results showed that the analytical method was reliable and the observed differences among the test samples represented true physiological differences, rather than technical errors [15] . To investigate the lipid detection and extraction capacity of the current method, a total of 15 lipid internal standards were applied for sample preparation and LC-MS analysis for monitoring the lipids coverage and extraction efficiency. Additionally, to check the stability of the LC-MS system during the analytical batch, QC samples were injected at the beginning of the run and after every six samples for monitoring the system variation. QC samples were prepared by pooling equal aliquots of each sample in the current study [38] .
