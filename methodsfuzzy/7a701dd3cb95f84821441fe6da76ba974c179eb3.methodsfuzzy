Bacteriophage f 2 (f 2 ) was used as a model for the coronavirus that may be present in sewage. The f 2 was prepared and detected according to the methods described by Wommack et al. (1995) . To identify viruses in sewage, a variety of specimens (sewage before or after disinfection by chlorine) were inoculated onto Vero E6. All cell cultures were grown in Eagle's growth medium (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) containing 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.015 M DMEM buffer and antibiotics (50 g [each] of kanamycin and gentamycin per milliliter), and maintained in the same medium with 1.5% FBS. For virus propagation and isolation, cell cultures in 75-cm 2 flasks were drained of medium, inoculated with 2 ml of sample, and incubated for 2 h at 37 â€¢ C with periodic rocking for viral adsorption. Because of the toxicity of most sewage, all cell cultures were inoculated in the presence of growth medium. Medium was replaced after 1-2 days of incubation. The culture was observed daily for cytopathic effect and terminated 7 days after inoculation. Any cultures exhibiting an identifiable cytopathic effect were subjected to several procedures to identify the cause of the effect (WHO, 2003c,d,e) . If there was no cytopathic effect in the cell culture, the culture suspensate was harvested and transferred into additional flasks to isolate viruses. The cultures were used for three generations without any observable cytopathic effect.
