The mouse inbred strains used in these experiments are the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) (Collaborative The number of litters observed per cross is given by the integers, with the largest sample sizes, along the diagonal, corresponding to the production of inbred parental strains. Column and row sums are given along the bottom row and rightmost column, respectively. A total of 4,448 litters were evaluated for this analysis, resulting in a total of 24,782 weaned pups. The shading within each box corresponds to the average number of weaned pups per litter in each cross, with averages ranging from 3.6 to 9.1 pups per litter. Litters for which no pups survived until weaning were not included in our analysis. The symbol "â‡¥" is used to indicate incompatible crosses that do not produce any litters. Cross Consortium 2012). The founders of the CC include five classical strains, A/J (AJ), C57BL/6J (B6), 129S1/SvImJ (129S1), NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD), NZO/HlLtJ (NZO), and three wild-derived strains, CAST/EiJ (CAST), PWK/PhJ (PWK), and WSB/EiJ (WSB). Mice originated from a colony maintained by Gary Churchill at Jackson Laboratory, and were transferred to the FMPV lab at the University of North Carolina (UNC) in 2008. The original colony also produced most of the G1 breeders that populated the inbred funnels at ORNL, TAU and Geniad (Srivastava et al. 2017
