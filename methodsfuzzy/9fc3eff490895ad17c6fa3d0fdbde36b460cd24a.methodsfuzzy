Patients MS patients on IFN-b therapy, predominantly of northern European heritage, were recruited in Germany by primary-care physicians and neurologists. The initial study group included 268 individuals with known anti-IFN-b1 status. The ratio of males to females in the first cohort was 0.53. A total of 34 patients received IFN-b1a intramuscular injection (i.m.) once weekly (Avonex), 118 patients IFN-b1b subcutaneous injection (s.c.) every second day (Betaferon), 26 patients 22 mg and 90 patients 44 mg IFN-b1a s.c. three times a week (Rebif). The validation group compassed 242 patients with a male-female ratio of 0.36. Avonex treatment was administered to 68 patients, and Rebif was given to 88 individuals and 86 patients received Betaferon. As expected, IFN-b1a i.m. (Avonex)-treated patients were underrepresented in the study as a result of the lower frequency of antibody development in this group compared to patients treated with the formulations for s.c. application. Mean age was 39.8 yr in the first and 39.0 yr in the second group (Table 1) . Average treatment duration was 57 months in the first and 52 months in the second group. The duration of the drug exposure did not differ significantly among treatment groups. All patients gave their written informed consent. The study was approved by the ethics committees of the Universities of DÃ¼sseldorf and Munich.
