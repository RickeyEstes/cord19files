Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), targeting either conserved or variable regions of the MHV genome, has proven to be a useful diagnostic and epidemiologic tool. Caution is advised, as nonspecific amplification can and does occur, so use of appropriate controls and verification of size and sequence of the amplicon may be needed before condemnation of a mouse population. Initial application of RT-PCR for MHV detection showed that RT-PCR was more sensitive than infant mouse assay and equally sensitive as MAP testing. The approach used primers that amplified a conserved M gene sequence of 375 base pairs, and showed that all of the prototype and several field isolates of MHV could be detected using the chosen primers. This approach also allowed amplification of rat coronavirus, but not human coronavirus OC-43 or 229E (Homberger et al. 1991) . During an MHV outbreak in athymic mice in Australia, histologic findings suggested MHV as the etiology, but serologic testing of nude and immunocompetent sentinel mice was negative. The use of nested primers directed at M gene sequences by RT-PCR resulted in amplification in the liver of an athymic mouse (Matthaei et al. 1998) . Similarly, nested RT-PCR detected N gene RNA in feces of infected A/WySnJ mice. This approach, combined with sequencing the amplicons, is useful as an epidemiologic tool to determine whether one or more strains of MHV are circulating in different mouse facilities Oyanagi et al. 2004; Yamada et al. 2001) . Attempts have been made to increase the specificity of RT-PCR. Fluorogenic RT-PCR assays use an internal fluorogenic hybridization probe and thus have the added advantage of eliminating the need for post-PCR processing. Using primers specific to the highly conserved M gene, it has been possible to amplify sequences from several MHV and rat coronavirus strains. The assay was also successful when applied to infected tissues, feces, and swipes from cages containing infected animals (Besselsen et al. 2002) .
