Typing methods should have three important properties that favor their wide application: high discriminatory power, simplicity of use and low cost. In light of the whooping cough resurgence in several countries, Norman Fry (PHE, Colindale, UK) reviewed existing recommendations for Bordetella pertussis strain molecular characterization [37] . The observed increase in infection could reflect waning immunity, improved surveillance or pathogen adaptation. Understanding these factors is an important public health objective. Of the typing methods that are used, serotyping offers low discrimination, but provides an easy way of detecting changes in B. pertussis populations. PFGE, MLVA and DNA sequencing offer higher discrimination. More importantly, DNA sequence-based methods can monitor changes in particular genes e for example genes coding for cellular vaccine components, but are more labor-intensive. As for other microorganisms, wholegenome sequencing offers the greatest amount of information. For monitoring of the emergence of vaccine antigendeficient variants, N. Fry and colleagues recommend a combination of DNA sequence analysis (Sanger or HTS) and protein detection techniques, which must ideally conform to guidelines for the validation and application of typing methods used in bacterial epidemiology [46] . In the next talk entitled "S. aureus USA300: how to discriminate between the bad, the worse and the ugly", Corinna Glasner (University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands) presented the practical use of a genomebased typing method for the easy, rapid and low cost identification of different S. aureus types. C. Glasner described a study of nosocomial and community-associated MRSA isolates, all featuring the USA300 PFGE profile, but two different and highly-related spa types, using multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeat fingerprinting (MLVF). In addition, the patterns of exoproteomes of the typed isolates were compared in a search for novel microbial epidemiological markers. MLVF grouped the isolates into three distinct clusters. Importantly, it was clearly shown that MLVF was capable of overcoming the limitations of PFGE in distinguishing highly related S. aureus clones [15, 28] . Differences in the secreted proteins matched the three MLVF clusters, reflecting epidemiological relationships among the respective isolates. It was concluded that MLVF can be useful for epidemiological investigations, outbreak prevention and control, especially in countries where HTS is not yet in reach. Rebecca Lindsey and John Besser (CDC, Atlanta, USA) presented 'New Tools to Investigate Outbreaks: Shoe Leather Molecular Epidemiology'. Molecular typing methods such as PFGE and MLVA are still widely used at the CDC and are important for understanding foodborne disease epidemiology. The widespread use of molecular tools has raised scientific and legal issues and led to thinking about disease transmission in new ways. Novel sequencing methods will need to be evaluated and adapted in order to fully exploit their potential for molecular epidemiology purposes. This will require statistical evaluation of cluster significance, fluid case definitions for maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio and analyses that integrate information on the microbial agent with person-place-time dimensions. The talk concluded with a discussion on the continued need for interpretation by skilled epidemiologists, with a focus on food-borne disease epidemiology. Novel diagnostic tools are intended to enable better patient care and to improve epidemiological knowledge of pathogens, leading to better control of infections. In the first presentation of the session, entitled "Novel diagnostic technologies for next-gen clinical microbiology and infection control", Alex Friedrich (University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands) first underlined the promise of HTS for the detection of intra-hospital transmission and presented an example of a regional health care cluster of methicillinresistant S. aureus [26] . Currently, the application of HTS for infection control purposes is still limited due to a long turnaround time, with approximately four days from library preparation to phylogenetic analysis. However, in the near future, the process could take less than one day. A. Friedrich presented various diagnostic avenues and innovative technologies, including mass spectrometry, deep sequencing but also the more futuristic approaches of atom-by-atom engineering, magnetometry, electronic tables to interact with the patient or nanotechnology-based in vivo and personalized diagnoses using nanocapsules. Treatment and follow-up are also expected to evolve, with a role for diagnostic gene expression profiling based on whole transcriptome sequencing, metagenome sequencing or pharmacomicrobiomics, and 'intelligent antibiotics'. Finally, 'next-gen communication' within the health care setting should revolutionize and speed up information flow. Matthew W. Gilmour (Diagnostic Services Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada) discussed "Real-time genomics for bacterial pathogen surveillance". He considered the benefits and challenges represented by pathogen genomics to clinical and public health sectors. The speaker also underlined the potential of proteomics to facilitate the investigation of outbreaks. An integrated network coordinating the monitoring, assessment, investigation, outbreak response and recovery with standardized genomic analyses and unified laboratory workflows was envisioned. In the last talk of the session, "Rapid taxonomic assignment from high throughput sequencing reads", Anthony Underwood (Bioinformatics Unit, PHE, Colindale, UK) described the bioinformatics component of the PHE project to replace existing phenotypic or molecular typing tests by HTS. Salmonella, S. pneumoniae and S. aureus were chosen in a pilot study to extract MLST, predict serotype or determine virulence gene profile. One identified limitation was the lack of accuracy in species identification and the issue of mixed cultures. Two identification methods, ribosomal MLST [23] and k-mer quantification in the sequencing reads, were described and compared. Although both methods were able to predict species correctly, the k-mer approach was faster. A large number of typing methods have been developed to assess strain relatedness for outbreak detection, surveillance, population structure and evolution studies. However, the unsatisfied need of combining high discriminatory power, accuracy, ease of use, low cost or speed drives a continuous search for new methodologies. Repetitive DNA motifs in bacterial genomes constitute important targets for microbial typing. In the first two talks of this session, characterization of the variability of the spacer content of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci was presented as a valuable typing approach for two major human pathogens, S. enterica and group B Streptococcus (GBS). CRISPR loci, known to provide immunity against mobile genetic elements in some bacteria, consist of several noncontiguous direct repeats separated by stretches of variable sequences named spacers, and are often adjacent to cas (CRISPR-associated) genes, a set of conserved functional protein-coding genes [35] . Francois-Xavier Weill (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) presented "CRISPR markers for Salmonella epidemiology" as a new method to perform real-time simultaneous typing and subtyping of all referred Salmonella isolates [10] . As already discussed, the current standard, serotyping, is laborious and has limitations in subtyping isolates from two highly prevalent serotypes, Typhimurium and Enteritidis. Spacer content was strongly correlated with both serotype and MLST. The study of 150 Typhimurium strains showed that spacer microevolution discriminated numerous subtypes within these prevalent serotypes. Further, a highthroughput assay for Typhimurium and its monophasic variant, the CRISPOL method, was developed based on spacer presence/absence using Luminex technology. CRISPOL is now routinely used and its database includes 450 types from 6000 isolates. Claire Poyart (INSERM, Paris, France) showed how CRISPR spacer analysis could also be used for population studies and GBS strain typing and subtyping. The French National Reference Center for streptococci collects invasive GBS strains, which are characterized by molecular capsular typing (CPS) and MLST, but these methods are timeconsuming. As was the case for Salmonella, Streptococcus agalactiae has two CRISPR loci in the genome. The CRISPR1 was sequenced in 351 GBS, non-redundant isolates previously characterized by CPS and MLST [33] . CRISPR1 trailer-end spacer content was found to be highly concordant with MLST. In contrast, the distribution of more recent spacers distinguished STs or specific lineages within the hypervirulent clonal complexes CC17 or CC23. The method was validated in a blind test with more than 100 GBS clinical isolates and was able to determine the ST of 95% of the isolates. It was concluded that CRISPR sequencing in GBS, with around 900 described spacers to date, proves to be rapid, accurate and cost-effective. In the last talk of the session, Salmonella typing came back on stage, with Vitali Sintchenko (Marie Bashir Institute for Emerging Infectious Diseases & Biosecurity, Sydney, Australia) presenting "No innovation without evaluation: added value of multiple-locus variable-number-tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) for prospective surveillance of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium". Surveillance of Salmonella infections requires high-resolution systems that detect outbreak and guide prospective interventions. A total of 8936 S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (STM) isolates were genotyped between January 2008 and December 2010, with the overwhelming majority of isolates belonging to only two phage types (PT), PT170 (44.6%) and PT135 (13.9%) [43] . STM isolates were further subtyped using a five-loci MLVA scheme [32] , distinguishing 1562 MLVA patterns. Isolates from epidemiologically linked patients showed indistinguishable MLVA patterns. A cluster of infection was defined by 5 isolates with identical MLVA patterns obtained within a four-week period, with 50% of the isolates having been recovered in a restricted geographic area [43] . An illustration of the investigation of two outbreaks was presented. Isolates from one of these were further investigated by HTS, showing only 1 to 2 SNP differences. During the course of other outbreaks, the rise of endemic clones, in particular the STM 'super clone' ST456 cluster, was noted. This work enables more precise surveillance of Salmonella infections in Australia.
