Measles virus Edmonston was grown in Vero or CV-1 cells as described in the text. The Lec SSPE virus was isolated by cocultivation techniques from the brain of a child with SSPE 164 (Barbanti-Brodano et al., 1970) , and a persistent infection (Lec PI) was established in Vero cells as described (ter Meulen et al., 198 1) . This persistent infection has now been maintained in our laboratory for over two years. Immune precipitation of infected cell polypeptides was performed using cell [35S]methionine-labeled lysates prepared at 16 h p i (Edmonston), 24 h p.i. (Lec lytic) or 16 h after cell passage (Lec PI). Lysate preparation and immunoprecipitation were carried out in RIPA buffer (1OmM Tris-HC1, pH 7.4, 0.15M NaCl containing 0.1 % SDS, 1 % Triton X-100 and 1 % sodium deoxycholate as described by Lamb et al. (1978) . Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed on 10 % polyacrylamide gels using the method of Laemmli (1 970) and visualized by fluorography (Bonner and Laskey , 1974) . Messenger RNA was isolated from cellular cytoplasmic fractions and selected by oligo dT chromatography (Barrett et al., 1979) . mRNA was translated in a reticulocyte lysate system kindly provided by Dr. S. Siddell. This was prepared as described by Pelham and Jackson (1976) with modifications described by Siddell et al. (1 980) . The preparation of monoclonal antibodies and the radioimmuno-binding assay has already been described (ter Meulen et al., 1983) . Serological assays, haemagglutination inhibition (HAI), neutralization (NT) and haemolysin inhibition (HLI) tests were carried out as described (Norrby and Gollmar, 1975) .
