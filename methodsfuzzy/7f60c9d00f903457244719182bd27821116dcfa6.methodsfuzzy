Initial attempts to generate recombinant BAdV-3 using homologous recombination in Madin Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells co-transfected with purified BAdV-3 genome and a transfer vector containing a deletion in E3 region were inefficient and mostly unsuccessful [45] [46] [47] due to low transfection efficiency and inefficient recombination in MDBK cells. However, two improvements namely availability of homologous recombination machinery of Escherichia coli [48] and use of bovine retina cells for transfection of restriction enzyme excised modified BAdV-3 genome from plasmids has facilitated the efficient generation of recombinant BAdV-3 [47, 49] . Recently, a more efficient and time saving method of generating recombinant BAdV-3 has been reported by transfection of endonuclease I-SceI expressing non bovine (cotton rat lung) cells with circular BAdV-3 genomic DNA flanked by I-SceI recognition site [50] .
