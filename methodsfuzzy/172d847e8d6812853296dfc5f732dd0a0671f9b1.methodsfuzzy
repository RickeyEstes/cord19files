Viruses are present in shellfish in very low numbers; however, in sufficient amounts to pose a health risk (Bosch et al., 1994; Sa Ânchez et al., 2002 , Le Guyader et al., 2003 , 2006a . This low contamination makes necessary the development of highly sensitive viral extraction methods ensuring the virus recovery from shellfish tissues. The hypothesis made in the 1980s, that viruses are concentrated in digestive diverticulum tissues (Metcalf et al., 1980) , represented a major step for the progress of the extraction methodologies. This hypothesis was later confirmed by detection of HAV using an in situ system in oysters artificially contaminated following virus bioaccumulation (Romalde et al., 1994) as well as through the tissue-specific quantification of infectious enteric adenoviruses and rotaviruses in mussels previously contaminated by bioaccumulation of such viruses (Abad et al., 1997a) . Additionally, a very interesting result has recently been described: the occurrence of a specific binding of Norwalk virus to oyster digestive tissues through the interaction with a N-acetylgalactosamine-containing receptor (Le Guyader et al., 2006b) . Analysis of digestive tissues provides several advantages, including increased sensitivity, decreased processing time and decreased interference with RT-PCR (Atmar et al., 1995) . Focusing the analysis of shellfish on the digestive tissues, where many of the viruses are concentrated, enhances assay performance by eliminating tissues (i.e. adductor muscle) that are rich in inhibitors but contain relatively little virus (Abad et al., 1997a) . As a matter of fact, the digestive tissues represent about one tenth of the total animal weight for oysters and mussels. Except for small species, such as clams or cockles, because dissection may be technically difficult, most of recent methods are based on dissected tissues and thus will be discussed here. Methods cited in the literature are diverse, complex, poorly standardised and restricted to a few specialist laboratories. It seems obvious that quality control and quality assurance issues must be solved, as well as simplification and automatation, of molecular procedures before they could be adopted by routine monitoring laboratories. All these latter issues have been addressed in the REFHEPA project of SEAFOODplus. Extraction of enteric viruses from shellfish is based on several steps: virus elution from shellfish tissues, recovery of viral particles, and then virus concentration. The weight analysed generally ranges from 1.5 to 2 g of digestives tissues. Some recent methods propose larger weights for the first step but thereafter analysing only part of them (Boxman et al., 2006) . Viruses are eluted from shellfish digestive tissues using various buffers (i.e. chloroformbutanol or glycine) before being concentrated either by polyethylene glycol precipitation or ultracentrifugation (Atmar et al., 1995; Nishida et al., 2003; Myrmel et al. 2004) . Those approaches used in the analysis of whole shellfish meat, such as acidic adsorption prior to virus elution, are not applied to dissected tissues (Shieh et al., 1999; Mullendore et al., 2001) . When working on dissected tissues, and applying molecular techniques, direct lysis of virus particles can also be used. For example, proteinase K, or Trizol and lysis of shellfish tissues using Zirconia beads and a denaturing buffer have all been used for virus and/or nucleic acid elution (Lodder-Verschoor et al., 2005; Jothikumar et al., 2005) . A disadvantage of this direct approach is that a lower quantity of shellfish tissue is analysed in the RT-PCR assay. Since the most relevant shellfish-borne viral pathogens, enteric hepatitis viruses A and E and noroviruses, are non-culturable RNA viruses, RT-PCR and now real-time RT-PCR are the methods of choice to set up sensitive protocol for their detection. The methods used for nucleic acid extraction are dependent on those used for virus elution and concentration. Most methods are based on guanidium extraction either using the methods described by Boom et al. (1990) or using a kit, based on similar chemistry (QIAamp or RNeasy kit by Qiagen Õ ) (Shieh et al., 1999; Loisy et al., 2000; Schwab et al., 2000) . Capsid lysis by proteinase K and then purification of nucleic acid using phenol-chloroform and CTAB precipitation is a more labour-intensive but was one of the first successful methods described (Atmar et al., 1993) . One of the goals of the extraction methods is to remove inhibitors of the RT and PCR reactions sufficiently to allow detection of viral nucleic acids. Polysaccharides present in shellfish tissue are at least one substance that can inhibit the PCR reaction (Atmar et al., 1993) . Several reported methods eliminate inhibitors to varying degrees, although no systematic evaluation of the efficiency of inhibitor removal has been performed, and only a few of them have been applied on naturally contaminated shellfish. Inhibitor elimination is difficult to evaluate and depending on the time of the year and shellfish life, different compounds may be present (Di Giralimo et al., 1977; Burkhardt and Calci, 2000) . Internal control standards have been used to detect the presence of significant sample inhibition, and the amount of sample inhibition has varied depending upon the shellfish tissue being analysed (Atmar et al., 1995; Schwab et al., 1998; Le Guyader et al., 2000) . Dilution of the extracted sample is the approach often used to overcome the inhibitor problem, leading to a smaller quantity of shellfish tissues being analysed. For most methods in the literature, the weight of digestive tissues analysed in each RT reaction varies between 0.01 g and 2.5 g. The method analysing the smallest shellfish tissue weight (0.01 g) is based on direct lysis of virus without a concentration step (Jothikumar et al., 2005) , while the method analysing the largest tissue weight (2.5 g) is based upon direct extraction of all nucleic acids followed by purification of nucleic acid using a poly A capture (Goswami et al., 2002) . It is important to promote methods allowing the biggest tissue analysis as it helps to improve the detection sensitivity. Beside the inhibitor problem, molecular analysis of viruses in shellfish samples includes other frequent difficulties such as low virus concentrations, and sequence variation. As the extraction-concentration procedure is not virus specific, the nucleic acid of several viruses can be extracted at the same time. RT-PCR must be performed under stringent conditions and confirmed by hybridisation. The first important step for sensitivity and specificity is the synthesis of the complementary DNA (cDNA) by reverse transcription (RT). Most assays utilise a virus-specific primer in the RT reaction (Atmar et al., 1995; Le Guyader et al., 2000; Kingsley et al., 2002; Formiga-Cruz et al., 2002; Sa Ânchez et al., 2002; de Medici et al., 2004; Myrmel et al., 2004; Boxman et al., 2006) but random hexamers are also used in some assays (Chung et al., 1996; Green et al., 1998; Cheng et al., 2005) . PCR amplification is usually performed for at least 40 cycles; some methods use nested PCR formats with fewer than 40 cycles in the first amplification reaction. Probe hybridisation is then performed as a confirmation step and enhances both assay sensitivity and specificity (Atmar et al., 1995; Chung et al., 1996; Shieh et al., 1999; Le Guyader et al., 2000; Sa Ânchez et al., 2002; Costantini et al., 2006) . Sometimes it is necessary to analyse the amplified sequence in order to characterise the viral strains, and virus-specific amplicons must be sequenced to obtain additional information about the virus(es) present in the sample. This is particularly important for NoV detection, due to its wide strain diversity. However, sequence analysis is hampered by the scarce product sometimes obtained after PCR amplification from shellfish tissues. One of the limitations in developing RT-PCR assays for the detection of NoV has been the selection of proper primer and probe combinations that allow the detection of most or all strains of concern. The high genetic diversity of NoV makes it necessary to use broadly reactive primers. Despite several improvements in the methodology, up to now no single primer set is able to amplify all strains (Atmar and Estes, 2001; Vinje et al., 2003) . In the absence of such a universal primer set, multiple sets increase the chance to detect a greater number of strains, and the homology of the primers with the NoV strain is important in terms of sensitivity (Le Guyader et al., 1996a , 2000 , 2006a . No single assay stands out as the best by all criteria, such as evaluation of sensitivity, detection limit and assay format, not even for the stool analysis being clearly more difficult in the case of shellfish samples with such very low contamination (Atmar and Estes, 2001; Vinje et al., 2003) . For example, in three outbreak reports, primer sets targeting different regions of the NoV genome were needed to be able to amplify the strain both in clinical or environmental samples Le Guyader et al., 1996b , 2006a . For HAV, primer selection is easier since the degree of variation, particularly in the 5 H non-coding region, is significantly lower (Sa Ânchez et al., 2004; Costafreda et al., 2006) . However, when genotyping is required other regions must be analysed such as the VP1X2A junction (Robertson et al., 1992; Sa Ânchez et al., 2004) or even larger fragments. However, the low virus concentration very often hampers the amplification of such large fragments. Real-time RT-PCR assays, in which the RT, PCR and hybridisation assays are combined in a single well, are being developed and used successfully to detect enteric viruses in shellfish (Nishida et al., 2003; Loisy et al., 2005; Jothikumar et al., 2005; Costafreda et al., 2006) . This technology takes advantage of not merely detecting but also quantifying the viruses present in the sample. However, for this last purpose it is necessary not only to develop but also to standardise the methodologies by including several controls at those most critical steps, let's say the nucleic acids extraction and the RT reaction (Costafreda et al., 2006) . The efficiency of the virus nucleic acids extraction must be controlled by means of a model virus while the efficiency of the RT-PCR reaction must be traced by means of a RNA molecule amplifiable and detectable with the same combination of primers and probes as those used for the actual virus. When these two reagents are added at known concentrations their recovery can be measured. Costafreda and colleagues (2006) proposed the use of the Mengo virus to evaluate the nucleic acid extraction efficiency, in general for any enteric virus and in particular for HAV, while the RNA molecule should be specific for each assay. The use of such an internal RNA control for the evaluation of the molecular reactions inhibition has been extensively used even in qualitative assays (Schwab et al., 1998; Le Guyader et al., 2003) . Regarding other viral pathogens, such as rotaviruses and astroviruses, an interesting alternative exists based on their capability of replication in some tissue culture systems, such as the CaCo-2 cells, which represents a universal in vivo amplification system for the enteric viruses (Pinto Â et al., 1994) combined with either molecular (Abad et al., 1997b; Pinto Â et al., 1994 Pinto Â et al., , 1996 Pinto Â et al., , 1999 or immunological (Abad et al., 1998; Bosch et al., 2004) detection methods. Other cell culture molecular integrated systems have been proposed for enteroviruses (Reynolds et al., 1996) . Interestingly, these combinations allow the quantification of infectious viruses (Abad et al., 1997a) . However, although these techniques have been satisfactory evaluated and used in water samples, their application in shellfish is not common due to the infrequent shellfishborn viral outbreaks other than enteric hepatitis and norovirus gastroenteritis. In summary, the quantitative assays open a new view in terms of analysis of the sanitary risks associated to the consumption of virus contaminated shellfish.
