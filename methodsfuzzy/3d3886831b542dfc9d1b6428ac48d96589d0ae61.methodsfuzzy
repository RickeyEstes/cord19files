This method, although introduced as "real-time bayesian" by its authors, more exactly allows sequential estimation of the initial reproduction number. It relies on an approximation to the SIR model, whereby incidence at time t + 1, N(t + 1) is approximately Poisson distributed with mean N(t)e (γ(R − 1)) [12] , where 1 γ the average duration of the infectious period. The proposed algorithm, described in a Bayesian framework, starts with a non-informative prior on the distribution of the reproduction number R. The distribution is updated as new data is observed, using P RjN 0 ; . . . ; N tþ1 ð Þ ¼ P N tþ1 jR;N 0 ;...;N t ð Þ P RjN 0 ;...;N t ð Þ P N 0 ;...;N tþ1 ð Þ . In other words, the prior distribution for R used on each new day is the posterior distribution from the previous day. At each time, the mode of the posterior may be computed along with the highest probability density interval. As before, the method requires that the epidemic is in a period of exponential growth, i.e. it does not account for susceptible depletion; it implicitly uses an exponential distribution for the generation time; and assumes random mixing in the population. We conducted a simulation study to investigate how estimates of the reproduction number changed with the method of estimation, the role of over-dispersion in the secondary cases distribution and of epidemic curve aggregation at increasingly large time steps. Epidemics were simulated using a branching process, with no restriction on the number of susceptibles to allow exponential growth. For each case, the latent and infectious period were sampled in distributions typical of influenza (gamma distributions with mean+/−sd 1.6+/−0.3 days for latency and 1+/−1 days for infectious period [19] ) yielding a generation time interval with mean 2.6 days. The epidemic was started with one incident case at time t=0, then for each incident case, the number of secondary cases was sampled from a negative binomial distribution with mean β I and variance k β I, where I was the individual's duration of infectious period, β the effective contact rate, and k the overdispersion parameter. The actual time of infection of secondary cases was sampled uniformly during the infectious period of the index case. In this model, the reproduction number is R = β E(I), so that it was possible to calibrate β to obtain the desired value of R. We ran simulations with 3 values for R (1.5, 2 and 3) and overdispersion parameter k to 1 (no overdispersion) and 4 (large overdispersion). All epidemics were simulated over a period corresponding to approximately the 6 first generations of cases (24 days). For each combination of R and k, 4000 epidemics with more than 20 cases were simulated. Epidemic data were then aggregated daily, by 3 days periods and by 6 days periods. Estimation of the reproduction ratio was made, and the bias and mean squared error were calculated. The comparison of methods is presented in Table 2 . In all cases, when the data were available as daily counts, all methods had approximately the same characteristics. The ML and TD methods were the least biased. Bias increased with larger aggregation periods, especially for the ML and TD methods. For these two methods, the reproduction ratio was increasingly underestimated as data were aggregated on longer periods. Overall, overdispersion did not significantly affect the estimated value of R. In all cases, the exponential growth method performance was the least affected by either aggregation or over dispersion.
