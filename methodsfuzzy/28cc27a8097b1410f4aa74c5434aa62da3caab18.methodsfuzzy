A mixture of freshly prepared carboxylic acid 14a (5.0 g, 20.9 mmol) and Eaton's reagent (P 2 O 5 /CH 3 SO 3 H/1/10 w/w) (15 mL) was heated at 90 C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was cooled and ice (20 g) and water (80 mL) were added carefully. The aqueous phase was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 (3Â60 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed with saturated NaHCO 3 (50 mL), H 2 O (30 mL), brine (20 mL), dried (Na 2 SO 4 ) and evaporated under reduced pressure to give crude 15a (4.11 g, 89%) as a yellow semi-crystalline solid which was purified on a small silica gel (120 g) column using CH 2 Cl 2 , CH 2 Cl 2 /acetone 25/1 as eluent gave pure 15a (3.6 g, 78%) . The analytically pure compound 15a was obtained by crystallization from cyclohexane; R f ¼0.52 (CH 2 Cl 2 /Acetone, 3/1). [2,3-b] quinolizine -6,10-dione (15b) This product was obtained from acid 14b (5.0 g, 20.9 mmol) and Eaton's reagent (P 2 O 5 /CH 3 SO 3 H: 1/10 w/w) (30 mL) at 75 C for 90 min in the same way as for 15a, yield 3.28 g (71%), R f ¼0.42 (CH 2 Cl 2 /Acetone, 3/1). 4.8. (4R, 5, 6, quinolizin-8(10H)-one (trans-10Aa)
