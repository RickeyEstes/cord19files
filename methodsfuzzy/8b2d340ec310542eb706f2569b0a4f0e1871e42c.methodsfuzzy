Staining and visual identification Characteristics such as colony size, shape and colour give a clue to the underlying organism. under the naked eye or microscope Using light microscopy and staining (e.g., Gram stain) is the most rapid approach to identifying (light or electron) many bacteria. Viruses are visible with the electron microscope. Culture and growth Organisms display culture and growth characteristics; e.g., M. tuberculosis is a slow grower. Organisms can be further distinguished by their growth in particular media; e.g., chocolate agar is needed for fastidious growers such as H. influenzae.
