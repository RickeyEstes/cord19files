Cats with chronic vomiting and/or diarrhea were recruited by a multi-center group of primary care veterinarians in the greater Cincinnati region. Cats with at least one episode of vomiting and/or diarrhea per week for a minimum duration of 3 weeks, with no more than three episodes of vomiting daily were included. The vomitus excluded those defined as hairball only but could include hair material if present in addition to food and/or bile. Cats were at least 1 year of age, with a body condition score (BCS) between 2 and 4 on a 5-point scale, and housed exclusively indoors. Cats were excluded if they were fed a veterinary therapeutic diet; had a known food allergy; had a history of undesired weight loss in excess of 10% over the last 2 months; had received antibiotic therapy within the last month; received long-acting immunosuppressive drugs within the past 6 weeks; or had received any immunosuppressive drugs within 3 weeks prior to enrollment. Cat owners were required to be at least 18 years of age, be the primary caregiver of the cat, be able to monitor the frequency of vomiting and/or diarrhea, and be able to report the daily occurrences via a daily automated phone call from an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). Cats from multi-cat households (up to four cats maximum) could be included, but only one cat was eligible to participate in the study and all cats in the house-hold were required to be fed the same study diet. Additionally, the owner had to be able to monitor the frequency and occurrence of vomiting and/or diarrhea from the cat participating in the study. The weekly episodes of vomiting and diarrhea were analyzed with a mixed-effects negative binomial generalized linear model. Fixed effects in the model were week, diet, and the interaction between. The random effects were animal nested within clinic. For vomiting, the change from week 0 to weeks 1-4 for each diet and between diets was tested. For diarrhea, the change from week 1 to weeks 2-4 for each diet and between diets was tested. The negative binomial models were also used to test for an effect of positive fecal testing for FCoV, C. perfringens enterotoxin gene, and FCoV antibody on vomiting and diarrhea occurrences by changing the fixed effects to week and positive/negative and retaining the same contrasts. This same model was altered to have a response of the total vomiting occurrences over the 4 weeks and fixed effects of diet and age. Vomiting was also modeled against the initial Spec fPL values using a negative binomial model, as before, however with the change in vomiting from baseline as the interaction between. Random effects were animal nested within clinic. The same hypothesis tests were also performed comparing the change between weeks within and between diets. All contrasts performed using the mixed-effects models were corrected for the multiple comparisons using stepwise correction, to achieve a family wise error rate of 5% within each measure. The hypothesis tests of correlations were corrected using the false discovery rate method of Benjamini-Hochberg, to the 5% level. These analyses were performed in R v3.2.0 (10) statistical software with libraries lme4 (11) and multcomp (12) .
