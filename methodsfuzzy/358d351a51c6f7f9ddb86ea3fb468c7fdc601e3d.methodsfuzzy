For construction of pSilencer-siTRAF3, the single-strand oligonucleotides 5= GATCCGCGAGAACTCCTCTTTCCCTCGAGGGAAAGAGG AGTTCTCGCAGA 3= and 5= AGCTTCTGCGAGAACTCCTCTTTCCC TCGAGGGAAAGAGGAGTTCTCGCG 3= were annealed to double strands before being subcloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pSilencer 4.1-CMV neo to form the pSilencer-siTRAF3 construct. Transient transfection. Cells (HEK293ET, HEK293T, and J2-M) were transiently transfected with the plasmid DNAs (pCMV-Myc-M, pCMV-Myc, pGL3-IFN-␤-luc, or pNF-B-luc) using VigoFect (Vigorous Biotechnology, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For example, about 5 g plasmid DNAs was first added to 100 l of 0.9% NaCl. Then, 2.5 l VigoFect was resuspended into another 100 l of 0.9% NaCl solution. Then, the DNA-NaCl mixture was added to the VigoFect-NaCl mixture drop by drop with gentle vortexing. After a 15min incubation at room temperature, the reaction product was evenly distributed onto the cell culture surface of either 6-well plates or 35-mm 2 dishes and then continuously incubated for 48 h before harvesting. Construction of the 293 siTRAF3 stable cells. Plasmid pSilencer-siTRAF3 DNAs (5 g) were transfected into HEK293 cells. After a 24-h transfection, the cell culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 1,200 g/ml G418. After 2 weeks of culture, cell colonies were picked up and expanded in a 24-well tissue culture plate. Finally, Western blot analysis was performed to detect TRAF3 expression. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and qRT-PCR. Total RNAs were extracted from the cultured cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The purified total RNAs were treated with DNase I (Qiagen, Düsseldorf, Germany). All primers used in the RT-PCRs are listed in Table 1 . The RT-PCR was carried out with the PrimeScript one-step RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RT-PCR was carried out in a DNA Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) under the following conditions: 50°C for 35 min for reverse transcription and 94°C for 5 min for denaturation. The PCR conditions were 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 50 s, repeated for 20 to 30 cycles; the reaction was extended at 72°C for 10 min before the reaction product was stored at 4°C. One-step real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China) was also performed to monitor the targeted gene expression. The primers used in qRT-PCR were also listed in Table 1 . Real-time qRT-PCR was carried out with the CFX real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) under the following conditions: 42°C for 5 min and 95°C for 10 s, and then 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 10 s, repeated for 40 cycles. The dissociation of the reaction products was conducted from 55°C to 95°C as the temperature rose at 0.2°C per 10 s.
