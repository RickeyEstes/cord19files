The majority (n=23) of studies conducted data-driven operationalisation procedures, followed by definition-driven (n=9) and psychometrically driven (n=4) methods. One study used psychometrically driven and definition-driven methods, 20 that is, using a definition to capture a group of resilient individuals and then examining the level of resilience later in these groups using the resilience scale. 48 Psychometrically driven methods repeatedly employed an established resilience scale: Donohoe et al 11 repeatedly administered the Prince-Embury Resiliency Scale for Children and Adolescents, 49 and Fortney et al, 12 Songprakun and McCann 14 and Mlinac et al 20 repeatedly administered the resilience scale. 48 Definition-driven methods generally included the maintenance of an adaptive state throughout the duration of the study, demonstrated by lower levels of mental health problems, notably depression, than might be expected in the face of adversity. For example, in a study of bereaved spouses, resilient individuals were those who demonstrated low or no depression throughout 18 months of follow-up 16 (table 2) . Within the datadriven methods, several person-centred latent variable techniques, that is, statistical procedures used to group similar individuals based on a common unobserved variable, were employed: latent class analysis (n=1), longitudinal hierarchical clustering (n=2), semiparametric group-based clustering (n=3) and GMM Figure 1 Study inclusion flow chart. (n=17) (table 3) . GMM, the most popular method, is a specific form of latent variable modelling that allows the identification of classes, or groupings of individuals with similar trajectories, based on individuals' scores on a continuous variable over a number of waves of data collection. Researchers are able to classify individuals as belonging to a specific trajectory based on the similarity of their slopes and intercepts. For example, in a study of individuals with spinal cord injury, GMM was employed to identify a group of individuals who demonstrated low levels of depression over the duration of the study. 32 Latent class analysis, longitudinal hierarchical clustering and semiparametric groupbased clustering use similar approaches to GMM, that is, using latent variable models to identify groups of individuals based on similar longitudinal patterns.
