Gene construction. Genes encoding the viral gp41 HR1 fragments N51 (residues 540-590) and N34 (residues 546-579), and HR2 fragments C43 (residues 624-666) and C34 (residues 628-661) were amplified by PCR from gp160 expression vector pMT3-HXB2. HR121 (N34-C34-N34) consisted of two N34 segments and one C34 segment alternatively linked with the short peptide se-quences, while HR212 (C34-N34-C34) consisted of two C34 segments and one N34 segment. The sequences of the C to N linker (linker 1) were GSSGG while those of the N to C linker (linker 2) were GGSGG. The genes encoding the proteins were then subcloned into Escherichia coli expression vector pGEX-6P-1 (Pharmacia) by two restriction enzyme sites of EcoRI and XhoI. A stop codon was introduced before the XhoI site. This cloning strategy yielded glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, designated GST-HR121 and GST-HR212, respectively. N51 and C43 were subcloned into the BamHI/XhoI site of pET-30a and yielded the proteins with N-terminal 6· His-tag, thrombin, and enterokinase cleavage sites, which were named after N51-30a and C43-30a, respectively. Protein expression and purification. The HR121 and HR212 proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column according to the method described earlier [9] . The N108, N44, and C38 were applied on Ni-chelated Sepharose affinity column [10] . CD spectroscopy. CD spectra were performed on a Jasco J-715 spectrophotometer with proteins in PBS. Wavelength spectra were recorded at 25°C using a 0.1 cm pathlength cuvette. The protein concentration used for this was 10 lg/ml. GST pull-down assay. Excess N51-30a and C43-30a in classified bacterium supernatants were mixed with GST-HR121 and GST-HR212, respectively. The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature before glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity gel was added. The gel with the protein mixtures was then incubated with gentle agitation at room temperature for 30 min. After centrifugation at 500g for 5 min, the supernatants were removed and the gel with adsorbed fusion protein complexes was loaded into a column, which was washed with 10-bed volumes of PBS and eluted with The segments for N51, N34, C43, and C34 are also indicated. (B) HR121 contained two HR1 segments and one HR2 segment alternatively linked with the short Gly/Ser peptide sequences, while HR212 consisted of two HR2 segments and one HR1 segment. The sequences of HR1 and HR2 for constructing HR121 and HR212 were peptides N34 and C34, respectively; linker 1, GSSGG; linker 2, GGSGG. (C) Schematic models of the trimeric HR121 (left) and HR212 (right). Both HR121 and HR212 assembled into six-helix bundles with free HR1s or HR2s. reduced L-glutathione. The eluted samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Inhibition of HIV-1 env glycoprotein-mediated virus-cell fusion by HR121 and HR212. Inhibition of virus-cell fusion was determined using a recombinant luciferase reporter assay. Virus pseudotyped with the HIV-1 env glycoproteins was produced by cotransfecting 293T cells with an HIV-1 genome containing a frame-shift mutation in env and a luciferase gene replacing nef (pNL43LucE À R À ) and pMT3-HXB2. The cellular debris was removed by low-speed centrifugation. The supernatants containing pseudovirus particles were then mixed with serially diluted proteins to be tested. The virus/protein mixture was then transferred to 24-well plates seeded with GHOST-CXCR-4 cells. Three hours later, the medium was replaced. After incubation at 37°C for 2 days, the cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer, followed by the addition of luciferase substrate. The luciferase activity was measured for 10 s in a TD-20/10 luminometer. The IC 50 values were calculated by fitting the HR121 and HR212 titration data Langmuir function {luciferase activity % = 100/(1 + C/IC 50 ), where C is the concentration of protein inhibitors}.
