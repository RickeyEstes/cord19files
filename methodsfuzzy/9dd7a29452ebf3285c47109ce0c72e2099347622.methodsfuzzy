A meta-analysis was used to evaluate the association between fruit and vegetable intake and risk of asthma and/or wheezing. Only studies that met the following inclusion criteria were included in the meta-analysis: (a) fruit and vegetable intake reported; (b) the odds ratio (OR) or the relative risks and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. However, due to the heterogeneity of study designs and differences in exposure and outcome assessments, meta-analysis of all of these studies were not possible. The analysis was performed for the total number of adults and children together, and pregnant women. To assess the risk of asthma and/or wheezing, the risk estimate from each study, weighted by the inverse of variance, was pooled. Appreciable heterogeneity was assumed if I 2 > 50 and p < 0.1. Meta-analysis was performed using random effect modelling if I 2 > 50 and fixed effect modelling was used if I 2 < 50. Most studies assessed dietary intake with a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and other studies used a dietary habit questionnaire, food diaries or 24 h recall. Some studies used an FFQ with limited fruit and vegetable items such as Rosenlund et al. [17] , while other studies used an FFQ which included over 50 items, such as Shaheen et al. [18] (>200 items), Romieu et al. [19] (108 items), and Protudjer et al. [20] (72 items). In addition, some of the FFQs were modified for use in children [21] . Since the included studies used different methods in reporting fruit and vegetable intake (i.e., >4 times/week vs. never, quartile 4 vs. quartile 1, daily intake vs. never, etc.), in order to include more studies in the meta-analysis, two terms were defined: high fruit and/or vegetable intake (the group that had the highest intake of fruit and vegetables in each study) vs. low fruit and/or vegetable intake (the group that had the lowest intake of fruit and vegetables in each study). Tables 1-3 show how the variables are contrasted in different studies.
