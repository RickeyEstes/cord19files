2.1. Cell culture, plasmids and reagents Delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells, 17Cl-1 cells, Vero cells, and HeLa cells expressing the MHV receptor carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) (HeLa-MHVR) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 10% fetal bovine serum as previously described (Zhou and Perlman, 2007) . Codon-optimized MHV-A59 N protein was synthesized and cloned directly into pcDNA3 (GenScript). A tagged construct was synthesized by inserting a 3X-FLAG sequence to the C terminus of the N protein using overlapping primers and recombination by In-fusion (Clontech). Control plasmid pcDNA3-GFP was described previously (Fehr et al., 2016) .
