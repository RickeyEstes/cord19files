Introduction: Pharyngitis is one of the most common reasons for visits to health care providers. Rapid, accurate identification of the presence or absence of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) as a cause of pharyngitis is important for both appropriate treatment when it is present, and to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics in cases of viral pharyngitis. GAS remains the most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis, and timely diagnosis and treatment are known to decrease the duration and severity of infectious symptoms and lessen disease transmission. Microbiologic culture remains the gold standard for diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis, but takes 24 to 48 hours to reach a definitive conclusion. New molecular tests are challenging culture's efficacy in this role. The Solana GAS Assay (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA) is a rapid molecular test designed to identify the presence or absence of GAS in throat swabs from symptomatic patients via qualitative isothermal helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) endpoint detection by fluorescent probe within 1 hour of swab receipt. Methods: Throat swabs obtained for GAS testing at Primary Children's Hospital (PCH) in Salt Lake City, Utah per standard of care and at physician discretion over a 60-day period in January and February of 2015 were included in the study. Each throat swab was first plated using PCH standard procedures and then tested with the Solana GAS Assay following the package insert protocol. Pledgets from culture swab transport tubes were forwarded to Quidel for culturebased testing for GAS and for testing with an alternative nucleic acid test (PCR). Both PCH and Quidel culture outcomes were used to determine the consensus culture result. The PCR testing was used for discrepancy resolution between consensus culture and Solana. Results: A total of 213 swabs were tested by both Solana and consensus culture. Sixty-nine swabs (32.4%) were culture positive for GAS. Of these, 68 (98.6%) were positive on Solana testing. Of 144 culture-negative swabs, 136 (94.4%) were also negative by Solana. In all 8 cases where culture was negative and Solana positive, PCR showed the presence of GAS DNA within the sample. In the single case that was culture positive and Solana negative, PCR identified no GAS DNA in the sample. After discrepancy resolution, sensitivity and specificity of the Solana GAS Assay were 98.7% and 98.5%, respectively. Accuracy was 98.6%, PPV 97.4% and NPV 99.3%. Conclusions: The Solana GAS Assay surpassed culture for accuracy in our study of pediatric throat swabs. Use of this rapid method for identification of GAS in clinical samples has the potential to refine current methods for the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis. J.S. Thomas, D. Chung, J. Kilby, S.

Introduction: Diagnostic and treatment guidelines for solid-organ and hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients include frequent monitoring of circulating cytomegalovirus (CMV) loads. Current methods rely heavily on quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), which demonstrate marked differences in performance, reproducibility, and calibration. To understand the interrelated effects of specimen type, calibrants, and assay methodology on CMV viral load, we compared: 1) a plasmid-calibrated QRT-PCR LDT (blood and plasma), 2) the same QRT-PCR LDT calibrated to the 1st WHO International Standard for Human CMV for Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (blood and plasma), 3) Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan CMV Test calibrated to the WHO standard (FDA-approved for plasma), and 4) Bio-Rad QX200 Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) System using QRT-PCR conditions without external calibration (blood and plasma). Methods: The study included 25 CMV-positive and 20 CMV-negative adult whole-blood specimens submitted to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for CMV load testing using the plasmid-calibrated QRT-PCR LDT (reference method). Positive specimens ranged from 261 to 244,820 copies/ml. Residual blood and postcentrifugation plasma fractions were stored and tested by additional quantitative methods. Percent mean bias in log10 viral load was determined for pairwise method comparisons using Deming regression (R-value range, 0.50 to 0.99). Results: All methods showed 100% qualitative agreement with the reference method. Plasma yielded higher CMV loads compared to blood by all methods. The WHO standard did not improve agreement between plasma and blood CMV loads measured by QRT-PCR LDT (4.2% and 6.9% mean bias using plasmid and WHO standards). In plasma, calibration of the QRT-PCR LDT with the WHO standard increased agreement with the COBAS assay (change in mean bias from 9.2% to 6.8%). The impact was more pronounced in a comparison of the QRT-PCR LDT and ddPCR (change in mean bias from 22.0% to 6.1% with WHO standard). The reference method (blood) calibrated to the WHO standard compared to the COBAS assay (plasma) showed 0.20% mean bias, representing the closest agreement between any two methods. Conclusions: PCR-based measurements of CMV loads are subject to the combinatorial effects of multiple variables. Calibration with the WHO standard harmonizes the results of a classically designed QRT-PCR LDT with a commercial CMV load assay. DdPCR shows good agreement with assays calibrated to the WHO standard and offers promising clinical capability for absolute quantification of CMV. Further comparative studies, to include the role of patientspecific variables on inter-assay agreement and individual assay precision, are needed to define optimal conditions for CMV viral load testing.

Introduction: Current malaria diagnostic tests rely on parasite detection by microscopy methods or antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). Molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to increase the sensitivity of detection. However, practical deployment of molecular testing should address certain challenges such as 1) simplification of sample preparation from blood, 2) reagent stability under ambient conditions, 3) ease-of-use for the end-user and 4) affordable pricing. Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a highly sensitive, rapid molecular method which can be used to detect Plasmodium DNA. We report on the performance of a simplified malaria assay in an easy to use LAMP platform. Methods: The Meridian illumigene Malaria DNA Amplification Assay (research use only (RUO), not cleared for use in USA) uses LAMP to detect Plasmodium parasite at the genus level. During LAMP amplification, an increase in turbidity occurs due to the magnesium-pyrophosphate built up. The turbidity is measured by the Meridian illumipro-10 instrument and a result is determined. Two methods were designed to extract DNA from blood. Both procedures rely on chemical lysis, and produce amplifiable DNA within 1 to 2 minutes (simple filtration, Meridian SMP PREP) or 7 to 10 minutes (gravity-driven gel filtration column, Meridian M-prep) of sample preparation. Both methods were evaluated using five well characterized Plasmodium falciparum standards (strains US05FPHI, US05FFC27/A3, US05FBeninI, US05FSantaLucia, US08F NigeriaXII), 50 archived specimens and the five human-infecting Plasmodium species (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae and P. knowlesi). A blood sample was mixed with lysis buffer, and the lysate transferred to either SMP PREP or M-Prep. The collected eluates from each device were directly added to the illumigene Malaria test device containing lyophilized Malaria test and control reagents. Results: The Limit of Detection (LoD) of P. falciparum was determined by Probit modelling to be 1.95 parasites/μl of blood with the SMP PREP method and 0.44 parasites/μl with M-Prep method. The assay also detected all tested human-infecting Plasmodium species. Sensitivity for both sample preparation methods was determined to be 98.0% by 50 microscopy or RDT positive, retrospective samples, and 100% after resolving with inhouse PCR method. No cross-reactivity was observed with human genomic DNA. Conclusions: The RUO LAMP based illumigene Malaria assay is capable of detecting the Plasmodium species at genus level with analytical sensitivity recommended by WHO (2 parasites/μl), while using an extremely simple procedure in less than one hour. This provides a much needed alternative to the more complex molecular test for malaria diagnosis. Assay for the Identification of Clostridium difficile North American Pulse-Field Type 1 (NAP-1) T. McsMillen, M. Kamboj, N. Babady Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY. Introduction: Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) strain 027/NAP1/B1 is the most common strain type in the United States and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Molecular typing methods including multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) or PCR ribotyping are traditionally used for strain typing of C. difficile. Identification of C. difficile NAP-1 type may also be accomplished using the Xpert C. difficile/Epi (Cepheid Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) assay, a rapid, real-time PCR with minimal hands on time and manipulation. In this study we compared the Xpert C.difficile /Epi assay with MLST for identification of the C. difficile NAP-1. Methods: From September 2013 to May 2014, all stool specimens positive for C. difficile by the Xpert C.difficile/Epi assay were saved and stored at -80°C prior to typing by MLST. Discordant C. difficile NAP-1 results were further evaluated using PCR-ribotyping, tcdc gene sequencing and Matrix Assisted Light Desorption-Time of Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Percent agreement between MLST and Xpert C.difficile/Epi were calculated. Results: Five hundred thirty stool samples were positive for C. difficile by Xpert PCR with 64 samples identified as presumptive C. difficile NAP-1. A total of 401 C.difficile isolates were recovered and typed by MLST including 52 C. difficile NAP-1 identified by Xpert PCR. 42/401 (10%) were identified as MLST type 1 (NAP-1). The total percent agreement for identification of C. difficile NAP-1 between MLST and Xpert PCR was 97.51% (k=0.8; 95% CI 0.81-0.95). Sequencing of the tcdC gene and PCR ribotyping confirmed 9 of 10 and 6 of 10 strains as C. difficile NAP-1 respectively. MALDI-TOF MS confirmed 9 of 10 discordant strains as C. difficile with similarity between isolates ranging from 50% to 80%. Additionally, 10 strains with concordant types between Xpert and MLST were also tested by the same methods. All 10 strains were identified as C. difficile NAP-1 by sequencing and PCR ribotyping. Nine of the 10 concordant samples were identified as C.difficile by MALDI-TOF MS with similarity between strain profiles >85%. Overall the sensitivity of the Xpert PCR assay for C. difficile 027/NAP1/B1 identification was 100%, with a specificity of 98%. Conclusions: The limited amount of hands on time and rapid turnaround time make the Xpert C.difficile/Epi PCR assay an advantageous method for the rapid identification C.difficile 027/NAP1/B1 when compared to MLST. We demonstrate an effective method of CN estimation using an Ion Ampliseq targeted sequencing panel. When combined with detection of mutations and gene fusions, this NGS-based approach may be useful in characterizing relevant somatic alterations in cancer research samples. The assay is based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and next generation sequencing (NGS) on an Ion Torrent platform. Highly polymorphic SNPs evenly distributed over chromosome 1p and 19q were selected. The sensitivity and specificity of targeted SNP analysis was experimentally determined with DNAs extracted from 49 routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) glioma tissues and the results were compared with diagnostic microsatellitebased LOH analysis and calculated estimates. Results: We show that targeted SNP analysis allows reliable detection of 1p and/or 19q deletion in a background of 70% of normal cells, is more sensitive than microsatellite-based LOH analysis, and requires much less DNA. This assay can be easily extended for analysis of additional genomic regions and mutational analysis of any gene of interest, all with the same amount of DNA input. Conclusions: Combined NGS-based LOH and mutation detection is perfectly suited to become standard practice for routine glioma diagnostics and other diagnostic molecular pathology applications. (NENs) . The developmental role of Insm1 varies in different subtypes of endocrine tissue (eg, pancreatic A-cells versus B-cells). As the functional status of NENs often carries clinical and prognostic significance, we use molecular and in silico techniques to correlate INSM1 expression with hormone production in functional NENs. Methods: We used qRT-PCR to assess INSM1 mRNA expression in gastrointestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms (GI-NENs), pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (Pan-NENs), and pituitary NENs. INSM1 transcription factor binding sites were predicted using public databases and software. 2.5 kilobases of the upstream promoter region of selected genes were downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu) and analyzed for predicted INSM1 binding sites using the JASPAR online software (http://jaspar.genereg.net/). Conservation of the binding sites was estimated using conservation tools in the UCSC genome browser. Expression levels do not correlate with serum chromogranin (CGA) levels. We find putative INSM1 binding sites in the promoter regions of a number of genes related to neuropeptide hormone production. Higher numbers of putative binding sites correlate with increased expression of INSM1 in neoplasms with a corresponding secretory profile. Conclusions: In hormone producing neuroendocrine neoplasms, we find that INSM1 expression level correlates with hormonal subtype, and that loss or diminished expression of INSM1 often correlates with loss or diminished production of functional hormone. Loss of hormone production by neuroendocrine neoplasms also often correlates with dedifferentiation and worsened clinical outcomes. Quantitative evaluation of INSM1 may add valuable prognostic information in the assessment of NENs. P. Scott, J.E. Stanchfield SciGene, Sunnyvale, CA. Introduction: All methods specified by FISH probe suppliers require samples be codenatured with probe at a precise temperature for a specific time to achieve optimal results. Despite this, there has been no accurate and reliable method to certify that FISH slide heating equipment actually achieve their critical temperatures and times. We describe here a simple, accurate and affordable method for measuring and logging temperature data from each slide heating position on any FISH hybridizer. Using this method, we collected time and temperature profiles on over 70 instruments in 22 cytogenetics laboratories in North America. Methods: The method used in this study is based on iButton Thermochron Sensors (www.ibuttonlink.com; $89 each) a dime size, wireless sensor with integrated datalogger. Using the manufacture-provided computer adaptor and software, a data collection time interval is selected for each iButton sensor. One or more sensors are placed in slide positions on a FISH hybridizer, such as a ThermoBrite or Hybrite instrument (Abbott Molecular, Dako/Agilent, Leica, etc) and a standardized protocol of 75°C for 2 minutes, then 37°C incubation is initiated. Once the instrument cooled to 37°C, each sensor is removed and inserted again into the adaptor to download time and temperature data into a spreadsheet for analysis. Results: We have used the iButton system to measure slide position temperatures on 74 Thermobrite/HYBrite systems in 22 cytogenetics laboratories. Slide position denaturation temperatures were found to be consistently lower than the set temperature, with deviations between instruments in a single laboratory of 2.0°C to 16.4°C below programmed temperatures. Furthermore, we uncovered that FISH samples are held within 1°C of the peak denaturation temperature for only 50% of the programmed denaturation time. Conclusions: In the absence of routine calibration, slide temperatures and times achieved on FISH slide hybridizers may be much lower and deviate dramatically from those recommended by probe suppliers; contributing unnecessary variability to the quality and reliability of FISH diagnostic results. TT20. Assessment of Fetal Chromosomal Abnormalities Using Cell-Free DNA from Amniotic Fluid R. Duttagupta 1 , S. Venkatapathy 1 , K. Suyenega 1 , J. Cuevas 1 , A. Alka Chaubey 2 , B. DuPont 2 , E. Fung 2 1 Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA; 2 Greenwood Genetic Center, Greenwood, SC. Introduction: Prenatal testing and assessment for determining risk of fetal chromosomal abnormalities can be undertaken using both invasive and non-invasive methods. The spectrum of non-invasive methods have limitations in diagnostics due to either lower detection rates or indirect sampling of fetal genome through Noninvasive Prenatal Screening (NIPS) of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) from maternal blood. Hence, invasive methods such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) continue to be the reference gold standard. Due to the culture limitations required for amniocentesis, there is an increased interest in evaluating the acellular fetal fraction for determining fetal aneuploidy.This left-over material is typically discarded in the clinical setting. The ability to utilize and assess cell-free DNA from amniotic fluid (AF) for copy number assessment presents an alternate molecular strategy for performing confirmatory tests. Methods: A total of 10 AF samples with abnormal NIPS or ultrasound findings were collected from patients ranging between 15 to 29 weeks of gestation. The samples were cultured and cellular DNA extracted using the QIAamp mini kit. Approximately 4ml to 8ml of the de-identified and left-over AF was frozen at -80°C for examination of cff DNA. For purification of cffDNA, samples were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min at 4°C to pellet residual cells and cffDNA isolated using a commercially available DNA purification kits (Norgen Bioteck Corp). Isolated DNA was analyzed using the OncoScan FFPE kit and compared to karyotyping. Results: The average DNA yield for cff DNA was 9.5+4 ng per mL of AF, with yields typically correlating to gestational age. Karyotyping and OncoScan had 100% concordance for aneuploidy detection, with all 3 aneuploid cases called by both platforms and the remaining 7 karyotypically normal samples also confirmed by OncoScan. Furthermore, with the exception of cases 3 and 4, complete concordance in normal and abnormal aneuploid results were detected between cffDNA and genomic DNA fractions. Results of cffDNA analysis from cases 3 and 4 were inconclusive due to high levels of maternal cell contamination (MCC). Interestingly, NIPS results from both of these cases describe evidence of chromosomal aberrations (Monosomy X for Case 3 and Trisomy 13 for Case 4) which could not be confirmed by either microarray analysis or karyotyping. Conclusions: Taken together, these results indicate that cffDNA isolated from amniotic fluid could be an alternate source of material for the detection of fetal aneuploidies. Also, the turnaround-time for confirmation of NIPS could be greatly reduced with the ability to run this assay on cffDNA rather than waiting for karyotype results. Introduction: Inherited thrombophilia predisposes an individual to thrombotic events such as venous thrombosis, the third most common cardiovascular disease. Genetic analysis has demonstrated that the Factor V Leiden mutation, which has a relatively high prevalence in the general population, accounts for 85% to 95% of APC resistance cases. Patients testing positive for the Factor V Leiden mutation should be considered for molecular genetic testing for the coagulation Factor II (prothrombin) G20210A variant. The Factor II variant is present in 1% to 2% of the general population, and its involvement in venous thromboembolism is well established. Here we report on the validation of assays for both Factor V and Factor II mutations to run concurrently on the same PCR plate at Baystate Health. Methods: A total of 60 de-identified DNA samples previously tested with the FV LightCycler Kit and Factor II (Prothrombin) G20210A LightCycler Kit, on different runs with different cycling parameters on the Roche LightCycler 2.0 were used to assess the accuracy of the same Roche kits run on the Roche cobas z480 instrument on the same PCR plate. Thirty samples analyzed for the Factor II variant consistedof 10 wild type, 14 heterozygous and 6 homozygous mutant. Thirty samples analyzed for the Factor V variant consisted of 10 wild type, 16 heterozygous and 4 homozygous mutant. Polymerase chain reaction was performed utilizing the Roche cobas z480 with the following parameters: 10 minutes at 95°C, 95°C for 1 minute, 40°C for 3 minutes, 72°C for 15 seconds for a total of 45 cycles. The genotypes were identified by melting curve analysis: 95°C for 1 minute, 40°C for 3 minutes and 80°C with 3 acquisitions/°C. Results: Sixty of sixty DNA samples (100%) showed concordance with the expected result. Precision studies showed reproducibility of inter-assay and inter-operator results to be 100% concordant (60 out of 60 replicates). The Factor II wild-type allele exhibited a Tm of approximately 59°C whereas the mutant allele exhibited a Tm of 49°C. The Factor V wild type allele exhibited a Tm of approximately 65°C whereas the mutant allele exhibited a Tm of 57°C. The Tm values for each of the alleles were consistently within +/-2.5ºC. Conclusions: The Roche FV LightCycler Kit and Factor II (Prothrombin) G20210A LightCycler Kit run on theRoche cobas z480 instrument on the same amplification plate provides a fast, easy, and accurate test.

Introduction: Identification of specific somatic mutation is essential step for the personalized cancer medicine. Various molecular methods including Sanger sequencing, real-time PCR, microarray, pyrosequencing and next-generation sequencing have been used for detection of mutations in specific genes or gene panels. However, there are still clinical unmet needs for mutation detection with high levels of sensitivity because of frequent low mutant allele fraction in clinical samples such as plasma and tissues with tumor heterogeneity and low tumor cellularity. Methods: In this study, novel method named as ultra-high sensitive (UHS) was developed for enrichment of mutant allele specific amplicon, thereby increase the detection sensitivity. Amplification of target region and enrichment of mutant allele The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics ■ jmd.amjpathol.org could be performed simultaneously in single PCR reaction by using three primes, pair of universal sense and anti-sense primer and mutation specific sense primer. Initial amplification of target region including mutation site was started using universal sense and antisense primers with gDNA as template, and followed by exponential enrichment of mutant allele specific amplicon with pair of mutation specific primer and universal antisense primer using previous amplified mutant allele amplicon as template. Enriched product was analyzed using MassArray system (from Sequenom) composed of iPLEX chemistry and MALDI-ToF analysis. Results: Detection sensitivity of this method was evaluated as 0.1%~0.5% using serial diluted gDNA isolated from H1975 cell line has L858R mutation of EGFR gene. This method was applied to detect mutation of EGFR_L858R, KRAS_G12D, KRAS_G12V and BRAF_V600E with 45 cell free circulating DNAs extracted from lung cancer clinical samples, which are known as EGFR mutation positive in resected tumor tissues, L858R (18 cases) and exon 19 indel (27 cases), respectively. L858R mutation was detected in 6 (33.3%) out of 18 samples known as positive, thereby sensitivity of mutation detection was much higher compared to cast-PCR (3, 16.6%) and conventional iPLEX chemistry (1, 5.5%). Conclusions: This unique OncoUHS method could potentially become a sensitive, specific, simple, rapid and safe approach for detection of somatic mutation. Quality and Impacts Variant Calling by Targeted NGS R. Blidner 1 , J. Plyler 1 , J. Kemppainen 1 , B.C. Haynes 1 , R. Zeigler 1 , A. Hiddessen 2 , K. Rose 2 , G.J. Latham 1 1 Asuragen, Inc., Austin, TX; 2 Purigen Biosystems, Pleasanton, CA. Introduction: Advances in precision medicine in oncology mirror innovations in molecular profiling techniques and the utility of new biomarkers. A common denominator for workflows that enable these advances is the up-front sample preparation of tumor biopsies. The choice of DNA isolation technology, particularly for low-quality or low-quantity FFPE samples, can impact downstream assay results. To quantify this impact, we compared and contrasted multiple isolation methods, including a novel technology in isotachophoresis (ITP), for pre-analytical functional DNA yield and quality and analytical results following targeted NGS. Methods: Three commercial FFPE isolation kits from Qiagen, Norgen, and Thermo Fisher were used to extract DNA from 15 low-quality melanoma FFPE specimens. In addition, two commercial kits (Qiagen and Norgen) and a custom ITP method (Purigen) were employed for DNA isolation from a mixed tissue FFPE cohort. DNA QC was performed using spectrophotometry (NanoDrop), fluorimetric assay (Qubit dsDNA HS Assay), and qPCR (Quantidex DNA Assay). Targeted NGS of each sample was performed using variable amplifiable copy number inputs into the Quantidex Pan Cancer kit (Asuragen) with sequencing on the MiSeq (Illumina). Results: Recovered FFPE DNA was evaluated by yield, functional quality, qPCR inhibition, and variant calls from targeted NGS. A set of 15 melanoma samples revealed distinct DNA yields and quality from the same tissue input; the fraction of amplifiable DNA varied by >4-fold across three commercial isolation kits. Inhibition in qPCR was observed in 3 of 15 samples and was dependent on the choice of extraction method, indicating differences in the removal of interfering substances such as melanin. An increase in NGS variant calls was also observed between different isolation methods, particularly with reduced template inputs. Evaluation of a separate FFPE cohort confirmed these findings, and extended them by including an innovative method for isolating DNA using ITP. Compared to conventional extraction chemistries, ITP produced 2-to 3-fold higher yields of both total DNA and amplifiable DNA. All three methods enabled accurate NGS variant calls at relatively high DNA inputs, but one commercial kit manifested a categorically elevated "noise" profile when challenged with low-input DNA. Conclusions: The results underscore differences in FFPE DNA yield, and functional quality and purity, using commercial and emerging sample preparation technologies. Moreover, these differences can impact results using downstream molecular analyses such as qPCR and NGS. Our findings highlight the need to improve and standardize DNA extraction methods from challenging clinical specimens, and illustrate the potential of a new approach using ITP. TT28. Choosing an Accurate, Economical Platform for Typing Self-identifying Antigens Encoded by HLA Genes J. Sims 1 , J. Kaur 2 , E. Earley 1 , K. Robasky 1 , K. Robasky 1 , E. Lai 2 1 EA|Quintiles, Durham, NC; 2 Takeda Pharmaceuticals International, Inc, Deerfield, IL. Introduction: The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is the genomic region that regulates the human immune system by encoding proteins for the cell wall that are responsible for self-recognition. This genomic region plays a role in immunological disease, oncological immunotherapy, and drug toxicity, among other things. Accurate, cost-effective typing of this region enables biomarker identification and prediction of adverse drug reactions (ADR), as well as many other clinical applications. However, HLA genes are the most polymorphic region in the genome making characterization elusive by traditional practices and can cost over $1000 per sample. More sensitive and specific assays being developed using NGS have nearly halved that cost. Meanwhile, microarray-based techniques cost even less. Here, we quantify the accuracy trade-offs for these variable cost technologies. Methods: Classic HLA Class I and Class II molecular typing were performed using a standard method (Luminex kit). HLA-typing were additionally conducted via microarray using generic computational phasing tools and NGS using platform-specific tools. Principal component analysis was performed on the genotypes to ascertain population stratification for each sample. DNA samples were purchased from rheumatoid arthritis patients from BioServe to be used for the comparison of these methodologies. Classic HLA genotype calls were analyzed for concordance to the Luminex platform and cost comparisons were performed. Results: HLA-typing performed with NGS technologies achieved 97% to 100% concordance with Luminex for all Class I alleles and for HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB3 Class II alleles. Due to limitations in the microarray HLA-typing platform, only same-population samples and 8 of the classical HLA genes were comparable (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1). The HLA-C gene was found to have the highest concordance on every platform (up to 92% on microarray platforms), and the HLA-DRB1 gene had the lowest concordance on any platform. Recall was within 1% on all platforms, but the microarrays had lower concordance than NGS calls (by 8-44%) for every gene with the exception of HLA-DRB1, which ranged from 59% to 60% concordance across all platforms. Cost analyses show NGS is largely less expensive than traditional methods. Conclusions: Newer NGS technologies can be applied at nearly half the cost of traditional methods for HLA-typing with comparable accuracy. Microarrays can again halve the cost of NGS-based HLA-typing assays, at the cost of accuracy, and may be applicable to large legacy datasets or in circumstances where sample size and cost are sufficient to achieve the statistical power necessary for associations. TT29. Evaluation of a New, Accurate, Automated, and Cost-Effective Genotyping Approach for the Analysis of Pharmacologically Important Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms W.R. Higgins 1 , C. Keppel 2 , L. Linz 2 , A. Rodriguez 2 1 Douglas Scientific, Alexandria, MN; 2 Douglas Scientific, LLC, Alexandria, MN. Introduction: The use of genetic information by medical practitioners to guide treatment and drug dosage decisions has increased in prevalence over the last decade. Recent pushes towards personalized medicine have resulted in the need for accurate, automated, and low-cost methods for performing relevant pharmacogenomic SNP analysis in clinical and research settings. Three commonly tested SNP alleles, CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and VKORC1, have been widely demonstrated to impact the metabolism of warfarin, a commonly prescribed anticoagulant. Using probe-based SNP genotyping assays, this study analyzes human samples for these SNPs using the IntelliQube, a new integrated liquid handling and qPCR instrument. Through comparison with data previously published by Pratt, et al and results generated with standard qPCR instrumentation, we assess the accuracy and reproducibility of this platform for pharmacogenomic SNP analysis. Methods: Purified gDNA samples from 34 cell lines were obtained from the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research. Custom BHQplus probe-based genotyping assays were purchased from Biosearch Technologies and Genotyping ToughMix PCR mastermix was purchased from Quanta BioSciences. These materials were prepared and used according to manufacturer instructions. The IntelliQube instrument from Douglas Scientific was used for the automated assembly of 1.6μL reactions in Array Tape consisting of 800nL of gDNA and 800nL of primers, probes, and Genotyping ToughMix. Following setup, qPCR was performed on the IntelliQube. For comparison, 5μL reactions were manually assembled in a standard 384-well plate and a Life TechnologiesTM ViiATM 7 instrument was subsequently used for qPCR. Results from the plate-based method were then compared to those generated by IntelliQube. Results: All sample replicates tested were successfully genotyped and the genotype calls for 1.6μL reactions on the IntelliQube showed consistency with those generated in 5μL reactions on the ViiA7. Results from both methods were 100% concordant with those previously published by Pratt, et al. and the Coriell consensus genotypes. Conclusions: The IntelliQube, when used in conjunction with BHQplus assays, provides an accurate and streamlined qPCR-based method for genotype analysis of human DNA. All sample replicates tested in this study were successfully genotyped and concordant with published allele calls, demonstrating that the IntelliQube produces accurate and consistent genotype results. Combined with the automated workflow and economic benefits of miniaturized reactions in Array Tape, the IntelliQube may prove to be a useful and powerful platform for high-throughput pharmacogenomic testing. Introduction: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have rapidly made their way into the clinical laboratory setting. Performance characteristics that span pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical variables are important factors that must be taken into account when developing a custom assay for clinical use. Here, we evaluated the impact of implementing the KAPA BioSystems HyperPlus Library Preparation Kit (KHPLPK) into our current workflow for a laboratory-developed NGS assay, the JAX Cancer Treatment Profile (JAX-CTP), with the goal of lowering DNA input concentration, turn-around time and cost while increasing data quality. Methods: JAX-CTP is designed to sequence coding exons of 358 cancer related genes. Using 1 HAPMAP and 23 FFPE tumor samples, which were also processed with Agilent SureSelect XT (ASXT) in the current version of the assay, we evaluated library preparation with the KHPLPK. All samples were hybridized and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 or MiSeq. Data analysis and concordance were performed using an internal Clinical Genome Analytical pipeline (JAX-CGA). Results: Using the enzymatic fragmentation of the KHPLPK, we were able to reduce our DNA input concentration from 1ug to 200ng. A one-tube preparation method allows for better Hybridization Buffer it ranged from 17 to 20 hours for cytological and FFPE specimens, respectively. Conclusions: The new fast working Vysis Hybridization Buffer demonstrated the ability to complete FISH hybridizations within a single work shift (on average less than 6 hours) by using a 2 hour hybridization for all specimen types, reducing overall assay time to 3 to 6 hours from the standard 17 to 20 hours. Further, the fast working Vysis Hybridization Buffer 2 hour hybridizations demonstrated equivalent performance to Vysis LSI/WCP Hybridization Buffer overnight hybridizations. E. Golomb 1 , R.

Introduction: Somatic mutations emerge as superior biomarkers for rationalized drug selection in combating cancer. To trace the full cancer heterogeneity and detect mutations in cancer cells within DNA preparation that includes neighboring normal stromal cells, multiple target enrichment tools, developed to allow sequencing of the most relevant area of the genome, at the deepest possible, exhibit limited sensitivity, typically requiring 50ng gDNA. Methods: We assessed the sensitivity and specificity over a common genomic area, encompassing all frequently mutated exons of over 150 cancer causing genes, using a unique combination of target enrichment tools on Illumina HiSeq2500. This combination improves the sensitivity to less than 1 ng gDNA, from selected defined tumor cells dissected from H&E stained slides. Results: The technology we describe exhibit comparable sensitivity, reproducibility and specificity, without failing cases, even in small biopsies, with limited material. Furthermore, the use of Agilent Sureselect has the advantage of detecting gene fusions and CNVs. Conclusions: These results suggest that clinically driven tumor sequencing should read the samples at relatively high depth, even when the source material is very limited. cytotrophoblast, sheared DNA, blended with DNA from immortalized B cells, accurately replicates a cfDNA isolated from a pregnant individual when interrogated by MPS. Further, incorporation of the small fragment DNA at low concentration into a nucleosome mimetic not only confers an enhanced stability of the analyte but also facilitates its utility as a whole process control and as reference material for validation of various test methods.
