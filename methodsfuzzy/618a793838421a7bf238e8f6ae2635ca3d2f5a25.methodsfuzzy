Synchronized L4 cddko worms (P0) grown on HT115 were treated with EMS as described previously (Zhu et al., 2013) . The treated P0 and F1 worms were maintained on HT115 food. Gravid F1 adults were bleached and the synchronized L1s (F2) were spotted onto OP50 bacteria. Fertile F3s found on OP50 plates were isolated as candidates carrying a suppressor mutation. The ku544 allele was isolated from the screen above and was first backcrossed 4 times to cddko to remove background mutations. This initial backcross also confirmed that ku544 is a single recessive allele. The resulting ku544;cddko triple mutant was then crossed into the CB4856 Hawaiian strain and rough mapping with SNPs narrowed the suppressor mutation to a region with 9 potential candidates on chromosome X (Davis et al., 2005) . Additional mapping using PCR Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism identified a C-to-T mutation (T568I) in the coding region of endu-2. Generation of transgenic lines-Point-mutations and small insertions were created using Crisper/Cas9 (Arribere et al., 2014) . These strains include: endu-2(ku553) which contains the T568I mutation and an MfeI restriction site for genotyping [referred to as endu-2(−) in this report]; ctps-1(ku554) which contains a FLAG tag insertion into the 5′ end of the gene and is used as the background for all strains for western blot and immunostaining for the detection of CTPS-1 (Figures 3, 4A , 4E, and 5A); and ctps-1(ku555) which contains the S532A point mutation that abolishes the predicted phosphorylation site. The primers used for creating these strains are: atttgggatgttaagaagcgaaccgacgcctctgcggagcttatgcagatggctgatcag Large single copy insertions were created using Crisper/Cas9 into Chromosome II (Dickinson et al., 2013) to generate MH5737 and MH5661. In MH5737 (kuIs114[Pendu-2:gfp:endu-2 3′UTR + unc-119]; unc-119), an 8kb promoter sequence upstream of the start codon of endu-2 drives the gfp expression. In MH5661 (kuIs112[Pendu-2(short):ha::endu-2:endu-2 3′UTR + unc-119]; unc-119), a 3kb promoter sequence upstream of endu-2 is fused to the rest of the endu-2 genomic sequence without the first intron [referred to as endu-2(oe) in this report]. A region of ~800bp immediately following the endu-2 stop codon was used as the 3′UTR sequence. To create transgenic lines carrying endu-2 coding sequence, endu-2 genomic DNA including the 3′UTR was cloned into pPD95.77 (a gift from Andrew Fire, Addgene plasmid # 1495). The first intron of endu-2 was removed because it contains another protein coding gene kqt-2. This endu-2 genomic sequence without the first intron was fused with its own promoter (3kb upstream of endu-2) or the ges-1 promoter. H470A point-mutation was introduced into Pendu-2:endu-2 using PCR. These plasmids were injected into cddko using sur-5::dsRed as a co-injection marker to make cddko; Ex[Pendu-2:endu-2+sur-5::dsRed], cddko; Ex[Pges-1:endu-2] and cddko; Ex[Pendu-2:endu-2(H470A)+sur-5::dsRed] strains, respectively. To construct intestine-specific PKA dominant-negative strains, the plasmid containing C. elegans dominant negative PKA, kin-2a(G310D) (Wang and Sieburth, 2013) (a gift from Derek Sieburth, USC) was fused to the ges-1 promoter as previously described (Jia et al., 2016) . This new plasmid DNA was injected into ctps-1(ku554) worms together with sur-5::gfp as a co-injection marker. Three independent lines (ctps-1(ku554); Ex[Pges-1:pka(dn)+sur-5::gfp] #1~3) were used in the paper to account for variability between extrachromasomal arrays. Fertility assay-Synchronized L1 worms were grown to L4 and individual worms were transferred to new plates. Worms were considered sterile if no viable progeny was observed one week after transfer. Fifty to a hundred worms were examined for each replicate and each experiment included at least two replicates. Two independent trials were carried out for each experiment. Lifespan assay-Lifespan measurements were conducted at 20°C. The pre-fertile period of adulthood was defined as t = 0 for lifespan analysis and 80~100 worms were used per strain. Strains were grown for at least two generations ad libitum before lifespan analysis. For continuous RNAi, gravid adults (P0) were transferred to RNAi plates and F1 young adults were used for the assay. For adulthood-only RNAi, young adults grown on OP50 were transferred to RNAi plates and used for the assay. Results were analyzed by OASIS2 . p values were calculated using the logrank (MantelCox) method. Two independent trials were carried out for each experiment. Chemical supplementation of worm culture plates-Chemicals (Sigma) used in supplementation assays were: Uridine (U) (#U3003), thymidine (T) (#T1895), cytidine (C) (#C4654), 5-FU (#F6627), FUDR (#F0503) and hydroxyurea (HU) (#H8627). Supplements were directly added to cooled NGM medium before plates were poured. Overnight culture of OP50 bacteria were concentrated to OD600 = 3 and 100μL of the concentrate were added to each plate. Spotted plates were then treated with UV radiation for 30 minutes and were used within a week. For the supplementation assay, ~100 synchronized L1s were transferred to each plate and the plates were examined after three days. Each experiment contained at least two replicates and at least two independent experiments were carried out for each supplementation. RNAi treatment-All RNAi by feeding used bacterial clones from the MRC RNAi library (Kamath et al., 2003) or the ORF-RNAi Library (Rual et al., 2004) . The acy-4 RNAi construct was not found in the RNAi libraries and was made as previously described (Zhu et al., 2013) . Feeding RNAi experiments were done according to (Chi et al., 2016) . All RNAi started from synchronized L1 except for ctps-1 RNAi in Figures 2E and 2F . For these two experiments, synchronized L4 worms were fed control or ctps-1 RNAi plates until they reach adulthood. These adult worms were then bleached and the synchronized L1s were used for the experiments. RNAi for lifespan is described under "Lifespan Assay." Gravid adults were bleached and synchronized L1s were used for the drug treatment or the DNA bridge assay. dNTP measurement-dNTP extracts from worms were prepared as described by Pfister et al. (2015) . Briefly, worms were washed in M9, re-suspended in 60% methanol and homogenized using an OMNI tissue homogenizer on ice. The homogenates were sonicated then incubated at −20°C for 2 hours. Samples were boiled for 3 minutes and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was dried and dissolved in sterile water and filtered through 0.2μM filters (Corning #431219). Determination of the dNTP pool size was based on DNA polymerase-catalyzed incorporation of radioactive dNTP into synthetic oligonucleotide templates as described by Sherman and Fyfe (1989) using α− 32 P-dATP as an incorporation label (Arnold et al., 2015) . Each experiment contained 2-4 replicates and two independent experiments were carried out. Immunocytochemistry-Whole-worm DAPI staining and antibody staining of dissected gonads was carried out as described by Chi et al. (2016) . Primary antibody monoclonal ANTI-FLAG M2 (Sigma #F1804) was used at a dilution of 1:200. Secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen #A11001) were used at a dilution of 1:1000. Images were captured with Nomarski optics using a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope and a Zeiss AxioCam MRm CCD camera. Image analysis and signal quantitation was performed with ImageJ. For fluorescent quantitation, at least 20 worms were measured for each sample. cAMP measurement-cAMP concentrations were measured using a cyclic AMP ELISA kit (Cayman Chemical, #581001) as previously described (Lee et al., 2014) . Briefly, young adult worms were washed in M9 and incubated in 0.1M HCl at RT for 20 minutes to inactivate phosphodiesterase. The worms were then washed and re-suspended in the ELISA buffer. Worms were homogenized using an OMNI tissue homogenizer on ice and the homogenates were sonicated. The worm extracts were collected by centrifugation and used for ELISA per the manufacturer's instructions. Results were analyzed using 4 parametric logistic curve-fitting models. Each experiment contained 3-4 replicates and two independent experiments were carried out. Mass spec analysis-Worm pellet was ground in liquid nitrogen and dissolved in lysis buffer (1x TBS, 0.5% NP40 [Sigma, #NP40S], 0.5mM EDTA, 1x Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail [ThermoFisher, #78440]) and were sonicated. Insoluble content was removed by centrifugation at 4°C. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce Coomassie (Bradford) Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher, #1856209). Pull-down of FLAG::CTPS-1 was carried out using Anti-FLAG® M2 Magnetic Beads (Sigma, #M8823) per the manufacturer's instructions. Mass-spec and data analysis was conducted at the Mass Spectrometry Facility at CU-Boulder. Western blot with phos-tag gels-SuperSep Phos-tag, 12.5%, 17 well gels were purchased from Fisher (Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, #195-17991). Experiments were carried out using the same procedure for regular western blot experiments except that before transfer to PVDF membranes, gels were gently agitated in a transfer buffer containing 10mmol/L EDTA for 30 minutes. It is important to note that phos-tag gels cause ladders to migrate differently and is not indicative of the actual protein sizes. Drug treatment for cells-For drug treatment, 5-FU (Sigma, #F6627) was dissolved in DMSO and FUDR (Sigma, #F0503) was dissolved in water as 100mM stock solutions. The stocks were added to the growth media to the desired final concentrations with or without RNAi and cell viability was tested after 3 days. Cell viability was determined using the WST-8 Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical, #10010199) following the manufacturer's instructions. IC 50 was calculated using Prism GraphPad. Each experiment contained 3 replicates and two independent experiments were carried out.
