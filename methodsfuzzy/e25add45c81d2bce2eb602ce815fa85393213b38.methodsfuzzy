The atomic coordinates of SARS-CoV main proteinase were downloaded from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID 1Q2W). Another crystal structure of SARS-CoV main proteinase is also available (PDB ID 1UJ1), the superposition of 1Q2W A chain and 1UJ1 A chain is shown in Figure 1 , they overlap very well (rmsd ¼ 0.64), here we chose 1Q2W as docking studies, which was released early. The overall structure of a monomer of SARS-CoV main proteinase is composed of three domains: domain I (residues 1-101), domain II (residues 102-200) and III (residues 201-303), represented by green, pink and white trace in Figure 1 . The cleft between domains I and II is its substrate-binding site. Except four drugs (lopinavir, ritonavir, niclosamide and promazine), we also conducted the docking studies of two other molecules, PNU and UC2, for their molecular formulas are close to those of niclosamide and promazine, respectively (Fig. 2) , and they both are the inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. 4;5 The program Hex was employed to conduct the docking of the ligands to the SARS-CoV main proteinase, its basic approach to parametric functions, which encode both surface shape, electrostatic charge and potential distributions. The surface shape representation uses a novel 3D surface skin model of protein topology, and a novel soft molecular mechanics energy minimization procedure is used to refine the candidate docking solutions. Unlike conventional 3D fast Fourier transform (FFT) docking approaches, Hex uses spherical polar Fourier correlations to accelerate the docking between 10 and 100 times faster than FFT docking algorithm. 6 Here we used the following parameter set: correlation type ¼ shape + three probes, post-processing ¼ MM minimization, steric scan ¼ 20 (maximum), final search ¼ 32 (maximum), the others are default set. The structural comparison was performed by LGA. 7 The visualization of 3D structure was generated by PROTEINEXPLORER (http://www.proteinexplorer.org). Figure 3 displays the overall structures of docking for four drugs (lopinavir, ritonavir, niclosamide and promazine) and two inhibitors (PNU and UC2) to SARS-CoV main proteinase. The binding pockets of these compounds in SARS-CoV main protease are shown in Table 1 , which is defined by those residues that have at least one heavy atom (other than hydrogen) with a distance less than 5
