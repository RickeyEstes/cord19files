Ethics statement. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations for care and use of animals by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), National Institutes of Health. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC; permit number A-3410-01) approved the animal study protocol followed in the manuscript. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (per IACUC, UNC, guidelines) for infection and were euthanized if the body weight dropped below 80% of starting weight or clinical symptoms warranted it per IACUC, UNC, guidelines. UNC is registered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to work with select agents, including SARS-CoV. Virus and cells. The titers of recombinant a SARS-CoV Urbani strain, icSARS (GenBank accession no. AY278741), a mouse-adapted derivative, rMA15 (21, 30) , and a mouse-adapted derivative encoding a heterologous S glycoprotein, rMA15 GD03-S (17), were determined, and they were propagated on Vero E6 cells as previously described (17, 38) . rMA15 differs from the epidemic strain SARS-CoV Urbani in 6 amino acids (H133Y nsp5, E269A nsp5, T67A nsp9, A4V nsp13, Y436H spike, and E11K M protein) (GenBank accession no. AY525636). The GD-03 strain of SARS-CoV was identified from sporadic human cases during the second wave of the SARS epidemic in 2004 and is distinct from the 2003 Urbani-derived epidemic isolates (11, 17) . rMA15 GD03-S was derived from an MA15 molecular clone by replacing the MA15 Urbani spike with the GD03-S glycoprotein encoding the Y436H mouse-adapted S mutation (17) . Vero E6 cells were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% FetalClone II (HyClone, South Logan, UT) and gentamicin-kanamycin (UNC Tissue Culture Facility). All SARS-CoV work was performed in a class II biological safety cabinet in a certified biosafety level 3 laboratory containing redundant exhaust fans. Personnel wore Tyvek suits, gloves, and shoe covers and used portable air breathing apparatus (PAPR) as described previously (39) . All animal work was performed in SealSafe HEPA-filtered mouse caging as specified by the manufacturer (Techniplast) using IACUC-approved protocols and procedures (40) . Packaging and production of VRPs expressing SARS-CoV glycoproteins from different coats. VRPs expressing the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein from VEE virus 3000, 3014, or 3526 coat were constructed as previously described and assembled under identical conditions (11, 17) . For packaging VRP 3526, genes encoding the capsid and envelope proteins were synthesized from BioBasic, Inc., and were inserted into pSMART vectors (Lucigen Inc.). VRP construct expressing SARS-CoV S glycoprotein was generated using overlap PCR by fusing an amplicon containing the S gene in frame with an amplicon containing sequences from the VEE virus replicon. The primers for the VEE virus replicon and the primers used for generating the S gene amplicon were described previously (41) . VRP-HA utilizes the V3000 coat and was generated as previously described (17) . Ligated DNA was digested with ApaI and PacI and inserted into the pVR21 plasmid. VRPs were packaged using helper RNAs encoding structural proteins as described before (41) . Generation of polyclonal mouse antisera, neutralization assays, and Western blot analysis. Five-week-old mice were primed and boosted with 10 5 infectious units (IU) of the VRPs. Following vaccination, mouse polyclonal sera were generated from BALB/c mice as described previously (17) . Neutralization assays using mouse antisera involving SARS-CoV were performed as described previously (17) . For Western blotting, lysates from cells infected with VRP 3526 S or VRP 3000 S were prepared as described before in detail (42) , and these blots were probed using the indicated mouse polyclonal sera.
