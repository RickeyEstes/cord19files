If one decides to apply EM viral diagnosis, there are a number of methods available. So, what recommendation should be given to a beginner in diagnostic EM? Generally, a transmission EM is used, and the preparative technique most often applied is negative staining (for review see Biel and Gelderblom, 1999) . Thin section EM, however, is essential in the further characterization of a virus, e.g. the elucidation of its interaction with the host cell. The instrument used should not necessarily be highly sophisticated, it should allow stable primary routine magnifications of 40 000× to assess fine structural detail and also have data recording means, e.g. a sheet film or digital camera. Using negative staining, direct EM as the most simple approach should be used. It will allow assessment of the specimen quality and indicate whether enrichment techniques should be used. Immune EM (IEM) may then be applied, if necessary. Several prerequisites for the efficient performance of diagnostic EM are: (1) The use of stable, hydrophilic carbon-coated grids leads to a an efficient and stable adsorption of particles and a suitable stain distribution on the grid. Hydrophilicity can be achieved by pretreatment of the grids with polycations (MacRae and Srivastava, 1998; for details see c.f. Biel and Gelderblom, 1999) or by a glow discharge (Aebi and Pollard, 1987; Bozzola and Russell, 1992; Harris, 1997) . (2) The parallel application of two negative stains with different staining features, e.g. aqueous solutions of uranyl acetate and phosphotungstic acid, might help to visualize difficult-toassess structures more convincingly, in particular with unfamiliar specimens (Biel and Gelderblom, 1999) . (3) To increase the concentration of virus particles on the grid, i.e. to lower the detection limit, three principal enrichment techniques are available: agar filtration, sedimentation, and bioaffinity techniques; being part of our diagnostic repertoire they are listed with their respective enrichment factors in Table 2 . Agarfiltration initially was introduced for particle counting in EM (Kellenberger and Bitterli, 1976) : while giving cleaner specimens, filtration also enriches particles by a factor of 3-7. Like-wise, the pseudoreplica technique leads to an appreciable enrichment (for details see c.f. Hayat and Miller, 1990) . Ultracentrifugation permits the sedimentation of virus particles from a large suspension volume into a small sediment, following a preceding low-speed centrifugation for debris removal, if necessary. By resuspending the pellet in a small volume, the virus is concentrated 50 -100fold. Alternatively, particles may be sedimented directly onto the grid using the Airfuge ® technique, resulting in similar enrichment factors (Gelderblom and Reupke, 1978; Hammond et al., 1981) . Bioaffinity methods or IEM mainly relies on high-affinity virus-specific antibodies or other specific ligands, e.g. lectins, that may be used in different ways. Using hyper-immune sera directed against a specific virus or paired (acute and reconvalescent) sera, the etiologic role of the agent can be demonstrated by immune-aggregation or -decoration. Early, immune-aggregation was used to clump individual virus particles into larger immune complexes that can be easier detected than individual particles scattered in dilute suspensions (Anderson and Stanley, 1941; von Ardenne et al., 1941) . Thus, polyclonal sera are useful in increasing the detectability of dispersed virus particles, while monospecific antibodies help for both, immune-aggregation-enrichment and serotyping by immune-decoration. The IEM approach can be very successful, as recently exemplified by the delineation of at least nine different serotypes of SRSV (Okada et al., 1990) or three serotypes of Norwalk-like viruses (Lewis, 1990) , respectively. As well as direct IEM techniques, indirect immuno-aggregation techniques have also been developed, using species specific anti-IgG antibodies or protein A in addition to enrich, to label, and to type antibodycoated viruses (Valters et al., 1975; Katz et al., 1980) . The most sensitive IEM technique in viral diagnosis is solid phase IEM (SPIEM). Here the specific antibody is bound to the grid and, in a second step, the virus is captured immuno-specifically from the diagnostic suspension. This approach, also known as the 'fly-paper' technique and first developed for plant virus quantification (Derrick, 1973) was soon applied also to diagnostic specimens. The sensitivity was further improved by the introduction of protein A as to bind antibody to the grid (Shukla and Gough, 1979; Nicolaieff et al., 1980) , and widely applied to clinical specimens (Kjeldsberg and Mortensen-Egnund, 1982; Gerna et al., 1985 Gerna et al., , 1987 Humphrey et al., 1990; Lewis, 1990) . SPIEM reaches a sensitivity comparable to the equivalent ELISA systems (Kjeldsberg and Mortensen-Egnund, 1982; Svensson et al., 1983; Gerna et al., 1987) . Remarkably, it has also been experienced, that even direct EM can reach the sensitivity of commercial ELISAs (Moosai et al., 1985; Cubitt et al., 1999) . Using SPIEM, the sensitivity of diagnostic EM is improved up to 100 times (Kjeldsberg and Mortensen-Egnund, 1982) and reaches detection limits down to values of e.g. 10 2 -10 3 plaque forming units per milliliter (Giraldo et al., 1982) . Compared to nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAT) for SRSVs neither SPIEM nor NAT detect every virus-positive specimen-however, they complement each other (Humphrey et al., 1997; Cubitt et al., 1999) . (4) In general, the use of routine laboratory and reporting protocols following GLP rules is highly recommended (for details see Table 3 ).
