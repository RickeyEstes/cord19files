In order to analyze and quantify lipids, we developed a three steps method. In a first step, lipids were extracted with Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) according to Matyash method [1] . Lipids were then separated by liquid chromatography using either HILIC of reverse phase column prior to detection and quantification by mass spectrometry. All lipid classes were detected by ESI-MS/MS excepted cholesterol (APCI-MS/MS). Finally we applied this method to analyze the lipid content of different cell lines each expressing a different recombinant protein, during a 14 days fed batch process. Manufacturing process of PEIpro® and PEIpro®-HQ reagents. PEIpro® and PEIpro®-HQ are fully synthetic reagents, free of any animal-origin components. In comparison to PEIpro®, a more extensive number of Quality Controls are performed on PEIpro®-HQ to enable its use as a qualified raw material in GMP processes for the manufacturing of clinical batches of therapeutic products. Lentivirus and AAV production. Irrespective of the cell culture vessel type, transfection using PEIpro® was performed following our recommandations. As an example, HEK-293T (lentivirus) and HEK-293 (AAV) cells were thawed directly into each medium and passaged every 3 to 4 days before going into a 2 Liter benchtop bioreactor. Cells were resuspended and cultured for 3 days before transfection with PEIpro®. HEK-293T cells were transfected with a third-generation system (four plasmids) for lentivirus production. HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with three plasmids for AAV production. Lentiviral and AAV titers were measured 48 and 72 hours post-transfection (Data kindly provided by Généthon). Automated cell culture systems enable broader screening within a shorter time frame for many applications in upstream process development. The higher degree of parallelization and automation helps to screen for most promising parameters in a shorter time. The use of broad DoE screening design allows in addition the identification of parameters that support high titers while keeping high product quality (multiple factors at the same time). The illustration (Fig. 1b) shows an example how this combination can speed up process development steps. Main applications of the cell culture automation are for example the identification of product quality levers and media or feed optimization. We have developed a new end-to-end platform for bioprocess development, which includes a cell line development workflow system supporting seeding, selection, passaging, analyzing, cryo-conservation, and processing in (micro-) bioreactors. This platform, Genedata Bioprocess™, enables partially or fully automated cell line selection and assessment processes, and it increases process efficiency and quality. The system tracks the full history of all clones -from initial transfection all the way to their evaluation in bioreactor runs -and combines this information with analytics data on molecules, clones, and product quality. It can directly integrate with all instruments, such as pipetting robots, bioreactors, and bioanalyzers. The system is designed for a wide range of . a Schematic illustration of the automated cell culture system. Only the core system is shown with a robotic plate handler as key device connecting cultivation, processing and analytical parts. b Illustration of an example how cell culture automation can speed up process development steps. c Application in the identification of product quality levers. d Application in titer optimization biologic molecules, including antibodies (IgGs, novel formats) and other therapeutic proteins (e.g., fusion proteins). To explore the influence of the surrounding cell culture medium on the depth filtration performance, OMV was either produced in serum-free medium (VP-SFM) or serum-containing medium (DMEM + 10% FCS). The production was done in a STR with a working volume of 0.5 L as described in [3] . Cells and carriers were separated with an Opticap XL 1-module (Polygard-CR; 5 μm; Merck). For the depth filtration Millistak+ CE50 filters (Merck) were used. The filter material was autoclaved and rinsed with 25 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH=7.4). The virus suspension was filtered with a load of 50 L m -2 using a peristaltic pump (ISM931C; Ismatec) applying a flux of 150 L m -2 h -1 (Fig. 1 ). Samples were collected at the beginning and end of a filtration run. The OMV titer (TCID 50 mL -1 ) of the samples was determined according to Kärber and Reed [4, 5] . Protein content was measured with the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was measured by a microtiter assay using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Model cell line was a mAb-expressing CHO DG44 (licensed from Cellca GmbH) cultivated either in ActiPro basal medium only (GE Healthcare) or in ActiPro basal medium feed-spiked with additional supplementation with 7% Cell Boost 7a and 0.7% Cell Boost 7b (GE Healthcare). Both cultures were grown in batch mode using DASGIP™ CellFerm-Pro™ stirred-tank bioreactors (Eppendorf). The beneficial effect of feed-spiking was analysed by transcriptome analysis using microarray technology (8×60 k design, Agilent). A CHOZN® cell line producing an IgG1 was evaluated in several proprietary chemically defined media prototypes generated during the development of the catalog EXCELL® Advanced HD Perfusion medium: "Fed Batch Medium", "Early Prototype", "Mid Prototype", "Intermediate Prototype" and "Late Prototype" [2] . Small scale simulation of perfusion experiments were run in ambr®15. Media exchange was performed 3 times per day in equal amounts. Agitation, gassing, and liquid handling were stopped for an optimized period of time to allow cells to settle to the bottom. Spent media was removed in an amount proportional to 1/3 rd daily exchange volume. Agitation, gassing, and liquid handling were resumed and fresh media was added back to the vessels. For benchtop perfusion, cells were inoculated in 3L Applikon bioreactors (Applikon, Netherlands). At a concentration of~6.0x10 6 vc/mL, perfusion was initiated using the ATF2 (RepliGen, Massachusetts). Perfusion rate was limited at 1.2vvd during steady-state. Two sets of expression vectors comprising heavy chain and light chain plasmids expressing a human IgG1 kappa mAb, as previously described [1, 2] were used in the process optimisation study. The cell line used for transient expression and the PEI mediated transfection method has been described previously [1] . Transfected cultures were run under fed batch conditions for 14 days in 22L GE Healthcare Wave bioreactors (RBr), Hyclone SUB using 50L and 250L Hyclone bioreactor bags (Thermo Scientific). In a comprehensive I-optimal DOE approach ( Fig. 1) , the effect of six TE in various concentration levels and combinations in serum-free media was studied for four different CHO-K1 cells lines in an ambr® 15 setup. A scrutiny of the process performance parameters such as cellular growth, productivity, amino acids and vitamins consumptions rates for each of the conditions was performed. The process performance evaluation was accompanied by extensive product quality analysis including size and charge variants, glycosylation patterns, oxidation and methylation. Furthermore, a metabolic flux analysis was performed based on the nitrogen balance. In order to address this unmet need, we have designed an improved SPR biosensor assay to measure the kinetics of interaction between a mAb and the extracellular domain of the FcγRIIIa receptor bound at the biosensor surface [1, 2] . Recombinant monoclonal antibodies were produced by a genetically engineered Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR)-/-DG44 Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. Clarified cell culture fluid (CCCF) was obtained from 2 and 2K liter bioreactors after three filtration steps. Minipurifications were performed on Tecan Freedom EVO® robot with PreDictor RoboCol-umns® containing 200μL Mabselect SuRe® resin. Larger scale purification were executed using an AktaXpress using Hitrap column ProtA. To assess monoclonal antibody purification at small scale, we first tested the repeatability of the minipurification, purifying the samples 8 times on the same columns and using different columns, focusing on the yield of the purification and the impact on Product Quality Attributes, especially the HMWS. Then, we compared those results to those obtained with the AktaXpress at larger scale purification, comparing the yield of the purification and the PQA of the Protein-A eluates obtained with both purification systems. Finally, we assessed the capability of the robot to perform HTS of buffer and purification conditions, evaluating three different buffers at different concentrations and pH values, and also testing different loading column capacities. Lensless imaging technique directly acquires the light diffraction properties of each individual cells through their holograms images without any objective, lens or focus settings. Living and dead cells have significant holographic patterns that can be distinguished and precisely counted. We compare cell counts and viability between the reference method and our Lensless Imaging device, the Cytonote counter. Measures are performed once a day on samples from 12 bioreactors, from the inoculation to the end of the culture. We also assessed the repeatability of our method. Another Lensless Imaging prototype is setup as a measurement chamber directly connected to a perfusion bioreactor, for continuously receiving the bioreactor broth, and therefore reproducing an in situ measure. Four different cell lines, two of human origin and two CHO clones, producing four different recombinant glycoproteins were investigated in this study. Together with their respective parental cell line the clones were cultured in three replicates in shakers. Supernatant from the cultures were harvested at four time points. The removed culture volume was replaced by culture supernatant of the identically cultured corresponding parental cell line. The product was isolated from the supernatant and the glycans were released. One part of the released glycans was labeled with 2-AB and separated by HILIC-FLD. The other part of the glycans was permethylated and analyzed by MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry (Fig. 1a) . The investigated proteins were Antibody, Antithrombin III from CHO clones and α1-Antitrypsin, C1-Inhibitor from human clones. The DNA fragments encoding the heavy chain (Hc) and light chain (Lc) genes of an Fab fragment of mouse anti-bovine RNaseA [3] were respectively cloned into the plasmid vector pIHAneo, which contained the Bombyx mori actin promoter downstream of the B. mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) IE-1 transactivator and the BmNPV HR3 enhancer for high-level expression [4] . Trichoplusia ni BTI-TN-5B1-4 (High Five) cells were co-transfected with the resultant plasmid vectors using linear polyethyleneimine (PEI; Mw 40,000). Before transfection, the plasmids and PEI were prepared in 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0 and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. When the transfection efficiency was checked, a plasmid vector encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene was also co-transfected. Transfected cells were incubated with a serum-free medium in a static or shake-flask culture. Culture supernatants were analysed by western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The numbers of green fluorescent cells and total cells in culture broth was determined using a flow cytometer. Three different culture strategies were carried out in 2-litre Biostat B-DCU II bioreactor. First, a reference batch and a batch using fortified medium (nutrient enriched medium) were run and assessed in terms of Viable Cell Density (VCD) and product titer, and set as initial references. Then, a fed-batch was performed applying a feeding strategy based on the nutrient requirements estimation by monitoring the alkali buffer addition used for the control of pH. Results VCD and product titer achieved for the different culture strategies assessed (batch, fortified-batch and fed-batch) are presented in table 1. In fortified batch an increase in VCD of 145% and also 350% in product titer were obtained compared with batch. In the fed-batch culture carried out (Fig. 1) , we observed that alkali buffer addition profile matched the VCD evolution trend. Thus, the monitoring of alkali buffer addition was used for estimating the nutrients requirements (i.e. the volume of feeding medium) at any time during the fed batch phase. The feeding strategy based on alkali buffer addition enabled to maintain glucose concentration set point therein a narrow range during fed-batch phase (around 20 mM). As a result, higher VCD (16.6·10 6 cells/mL) was obtained when compared with both batch references: VCD was enhanced to 241% and 39% and an increase up to 381% and 7% in product titer in respect to batch and fortified batch respectively. The results prove that fed-batch strategy based on the alkali buffer addition is a robust on-line monitoring method that enables to optimize the feeding strategy in a fed-batch cultures. Selecting appropriate instruments and integrating them into a seamless system are the keys to a HTS platform. The developed HTS platform uses 24 deep well plates (DWPs) for culture vessels, the liquid handler of the Advance Microscale BioReactor (AMBR15) for media/ feed formulation preparation in an aseptic environment, NyONE cell imager for viability and cell growth analysis, TECAN Freedom EVO's liquid handler for activity assay sample preparation, and Cedex BioHT for high-throughput metabolite analysis. 24 DWPs offer comparable cell growth to shake flasks and compatible layout to AMBR15, which makes the 24 DWP an ideal candidate for the platform. In addition, the user friendly Design of Experiments (DoEs) interface and liquid handler function of the AMBR15 expediates the formulation preparation of varying DoE conditions [2] . A macro program was written and developed in Excel to enable the easy import of DoEs design from major statistics software packages, such as JMP and Simca, into AMBR15. High Throughput Screening (HTS) was performed with seven cell lines, while four were used in bioreactors: CHO-S, DG44, and two CHOZN® GS lines, each producing different monoclonal antibodies and include a fusion protein. For HTS experiments, cells were inoculated at 2.0x10 6 vc/mL with a 30 mL working volume in 50 mL TPP® tubes and cultured for 7 days in a Multitron shaken at 200rpm, 37°C, 80% RH, and 5% CO 2 . For benchtop perfusion, cells were inoculated at 0.4-2.0x10 6 vc/mL in 3L Applikon bioreactors (Applikon, Netherlands) with a 2L working volume. Bioreactors were operated at 350 rpm, 37°C, 40% DO, and a pH of 6.9 or 7.1±0.05 depending on the cell line. Oxygen was supplied through an L-sparger or microsparger as needed, and Excell® antifoam (MilliporeSigma, Germany) was added at a maximum rate of 0.25% v/v to control foam. At a cell concentration of~6.0x10 6 vc/mL, perfusion was initiated using the ATF2 (RepliGen, Massachusetts), with a bleed set to maintain cell concentrations at 50 or 80*10 6 vc/mL. A mechanistic model was adapted and modified from [2] and used to describe the dynamics of cell metabolism and antibody production of an IL-8 antibody producing CHO cell line (see abbreviation of Fig. 1 for cultivation details). Experiments were simulated and compared to a fully experimental DoE. As can be seen from Table 1 , user defined constraints were chosen to get a stable and reproducible process with the aim of maximizing the cell density but decreased lactate and ammonia production. In this study, to better understand the effect of hyperosmolality on the glycosylation of a protein produced from rCHO cells, we investigated 52 N-glycosylation-related gene expression and N-linked glycan structure in Fc-fusion protein-producing rCHO cells exposed to hyperosmotic conditions. Furthermore, to validate the effect of hyperosmolality on protein glycosylation, we performed hyperosmotic culture supplemented with betaine, an osmoprotectant, and then analyzed the N-linked glycan structure and mRNA levels of N-glycan branching/antennary genes. This study was performed with CHO cells expressing a monoclonal antibody targeted against the Coronoavirus responsible for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), developed by Organic Vaccines TM and the NIH, kindly provided to Univercells. Upstream process: -Fed-batch, 12 days culture at 10L scale with CD-CHO chemically defined media and feeds. Harvest treatment: -Precipitation of impurities in the production bioreactor using organic compounds (<1% v/v) and flocculation by electropositive organics (<0.1% w/v). -Acidic pH and physiological conductivity.  We established stable producing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) DG44 cell lines to analyze cellular and extracellular factors that influence quantity and quality of the produced recombinant polymeric IgM in future studies [1] . One quality parameter is polymer distribution, which can be measured directly in cell culture supernatant using densitometric analyses [2] . Additionally, we developed a very efficient single-step-affinity purification strategy using the POROS CaptureSelect IgM Affinity Matrix to analyze pure IgMs. For more precise measurements of the IgM isoform distribution we separated the purified polymers by high performance liquid size exclusion chromatography (SEC HPLC). Iterative experiments were performed in shake flasks to evaluate the influence of cultivation parameters such as shaking speed, working volume, CO2% in the incubator and daily base additions on cultivation parameters (as cell growth, pH and DO). In addition, a medium exchange was tested to mimic the perfusion mode used in the bioreactor process. The PreSens shake flask reader was implemented to allow for pH and DO monitoring. The conditions for which the performance as reflected in specific virus titer showed the best fit were selected. At these conditions, a series of parallel shaker flask infections were conducted to demonstrate statistical equivalence of performance parameter and CQAs (as cell specific IU titer and VP/IU ratio) between the production scale and reduced scale processes and thus to qualify the shake flask as a scale-down model. We have developed Genedata Bioprocess™, a new enterprise platform for bioprocess development. The platform enables automatic capture and visualization of all online and offline data (e.g., pH, O2, metabolic data), auto-calculations and aggregations (e.g., IVCD, qP, consumption rates) and multi-parametric assessment of any type of time-series bioreactor data in the context of experimental protocol data (e.g., process parameters, feeds). Genedata Bioprocess comes with dedicated interfaces for integrating with relevant laboratory instruments, control systems, statistical analysis software packages and custom enterprise solutions. It enables the modeling and tracking of complex nonlinear workflows and supports decision making in bioprocess development. The data can be analyzed in the context of upstream process development, and also be correlated to other unit operations. Automation support assists the ever increasing throughput of bioprocess development operations, and the analysis of experimental data and process parameters across unit operations or even different projects. This overall integration enhances process development workflows. In close collaboration with leading biopharmaceutical companies, we implemented a workflow, data management and analysis support system, Genedata Biologics™, enabling the automated design, screening, and expression of large panels of therapeutic candidates using these novel technologies. We have also built tools for developability and manufacturability assessments of these complex molecules. We have ensured that there is a seamless integration of all data generated and that functionalities such as bulk protein and vector generation using our in silico cloning engine, configurable library of template vectors and cloning strategies, fully annotated in silico protein molecules and DNA constructs, and DNA synthesis verification support, can be used for the newest protein formats and molecule topologies. We have developed a comprehensive platform, Genedata Bioprocess™, which supports drug candidate developability and manufacturability assessment and bioprocess development. The platform captures and structures the cell line and process parameters together with analytical data for cell lines, processes, and protein products. The protein analytical data being tracked include biological data (such as bioactivity, immunogenicity), and physicochemical properties. These properties include glycosylation, chemical liabilities (such as deamidation and oxidation), aggregation, stability under different conditions (low pH, low and high temperature), solubility, and impurities. Genedata Bioprocess™ simplifies and streamlines laborious, manual process and supports tools for molecule, clone and process selection. Furthermore, the platform allows for seamless integration with laboratory instruments, statistical software packages, and custom solutions. Chemostat cultures were performed at two dilution rate (D)(0.010 or 0.018(h-1)), two temperatures (33 or 37°C) and three feed glucose concentrations (20, 30 or 40 mM). The response was analysed considering r-protein production, cell growth and key metabolites. r-tPA protein concentration was determined by immunoassay (TriniLIZE tPA KIT); cells were counted using a hemocytometer and cell viability was determined by the method of exclusion using trypan blue (T8154, Sigma, USA); glucose, lactate and glutamate were determined by enzymatic assay using a biochemical analyser YSI (Yellow Spring Instruments). Statistical analysis of the results was performed by ANOVA (Design-Expert 7 for Windows). IgG-producing CHO cells were cultured in 2 L stirred bioreactors equipped with an in situ dielectric spectroscopy (Hamilton). Operating conditions were fixed at 90 rpm, 50% of air saturation, pH 7.2 and 37°C. Permittivity of cell culture was measured every 12 min, which allowed to calculate in real time the VCD by using a previously established linear correlation. Then, a model of online estimation of μ was developed based on VCD prediction and cell mass balance equations. Several signal noise filters and various calculation methods were evaluated to reach better model stability. Cell cultures were performed in both batch and feed-harvest modes. Feed-harvest cultures consisted of sequential renewals of 2/3 volume of the culture medium by following different strategies. The antibodies subjected to modification were a chimeric human/ camelid monoclonal antibody (EG2), a humanized monoclonal antibody (IL8), a full size chimeric antibody (Cetuximab) and polyclonal antibodies obtained from pooled human serum. The antibodies were bound to a Protein A column using conditions typical of Mab purification (Fig. 1 ). After washing out non-bound impurities by a neutral pH buffer, each antibody was subjected to enzymatic modification directed to a targeted glycan profile ( Table 1 ). The antibodies were then eluted with a low pH buffer and neutralized. The glycan profiles were analysed following glycan removal with PNGase F, labelling with 2-aminobenzamide and separation on a HILIC-HPLC column [3] . Process insight information (established either from DoE process investigation or existing experience with a process platform) is directly formalized into a set of mappings which transform bioprocess values into perceived benefits (0 to 1). At each bioreactor scale, parameters (e.g. stirring and gassing) are then chosen to maximize the product of resultant Utility Functions. The model CHO fed-batch process in this trial comprised a CHO DG44 cell line that was transfected to produce a humanized antibody IgG1. A chemically defined media system was used. The process, including cell line, medium and feeding strategy was designed and developed by Sartorius Stedim Cellca. The aim of the gassing scale-up was to achieve similar cell densities when the addition of pure oxygen starts. For all Flexsafe STR® bags oxygen was sparged via the micro sparger part of the combi sparger. All other systems used a ring sparger with holes face up. The initial air flow rate was set to an oxygen transfer rate (k L a) of 8 1/h at the corresponding agitation rate and volume. All process engineering characterization parameters were determined according to DECHEMA guidelines [2] . With the use of the Utility Functions the discrete agitation rate was determined (Table 1) . To find a more effective antioxidant in rCHO cell cultures, six different antioxidants including baicalein, which have used widely in mammalian cell cultures, were evaluated as chemical supplements with two different rCHO cell lines producing the same mAb in 6-well plates. Then, batch and fed-batch cultures were performed in shake flasks with the supplementation of baicalein, which showed the best effect on culture performance among the 6 antioxidants. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ER stress levels were measured to study the effect of baicalein on mAb production and quality. Cells were encapsulated in semipermeable SCS/PDADMAC polyelectrolyte microcapsules or confined in 1.5% alginate/poly-l-lysine (PLL) beads, a standard approach for cell immobilization. The permeability of the microcapsules was estimated using dextran-based molecular weight standards (10 and 20 kDa) and vitamin B12 (1.6 kDa). Gentle digestion with endocellulase allows an easy release of the cells out of the capsules. Cell growth, cytokines production and phenotype were measured in non-encapsulated and encapsulated cells grown under standard culture conditions. Moreover, we analyzed the interplay between the secreted cytokines and the SCS within the capsules and its putative influence on cell growth. Digital Biomanufacturing (DB) can be viewed as yet another, larger, embodiment of digital biotechnology. DB is similar to digital manufacturing in that it promotes innovations in the manufacturing of biologicals by using such things as computer aided design, manufacture, verification and deep process analysis using software sensors (Fig. 1) . However, the fact that there are living components (cells) involved in the processes puts a distinctly different flavor to the systems employed. It is desirable to use a distinct term here to distinguish it because, as in the terms bioproduction and biopharmacology, DB addresses many unique aspects of biologically-based activities. The identification of the changepoints position is based on simple rules rather than complex statistical modeling to keep the identification methodology simple. Once the changepoint are identified, a multivariate Bayesian model is adjusted on the appropriately transformed data. Prediction regions are obtained and used as control limits [1] . -Bench-scale fixed-bed bioreactor; -Carriers made of 100% pure non-woven hydrophilized PET fibers; -Vero cells grown in serum-free and serum containing media; -Attenuated polio strains; -Cell nuclei on carriers counted by the crystal violet method; -Polio virus production estimated by Elisa assay (D-antigen content). Homologous recombination in CR.pIX cells was used to generate viruses with various expression cassettes in deletion site III [4] and combinations of the differentiating point mutations of MVA-CR19 in a backbone of wildtype virus. All recombinant viruses were plaquepurified. Successful introduction of the mutations was confirmed by sequencing and specifically designed restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Viruses were analyzed by serial passaging, diagnostic PCRs accross deletion sites [4] , replication kinetics, plaque phenotype and electron microscopy. The genome was further investigated by anchored PCR and long PCR. Cells were seeded 24 hr in CHOMACS CD media before transfection. At transfection time point an equal amount of cells were resuspended in each media type. Transfection was applied either insitu or conventional (polyplex prepared in 100 μL of 150 mM NaCl and incubated for 20 min.), media addition was performed 5 hours post-transfection (hpt). Media type and transfection condition were illustrated in Table 1 . We have previously developed the cumate gene-switch, which is a very efficient expression system for protein production [1] . -Performed by trained scientists -Dilute culture to 1500 ± 500 cells/mL with ≤2% doublets -Draw cell suspension into pipette tip by capillary action; tap tip against the centre of the base of each well of a 48 well plate. -Size of resulting droplet =~1μL (Fig. 1a ) -Two scientists independently view all wells using a microscope (initially use 40x magnification with the entire rim of the droplet visible within the field-of-view. Next, examine particles using 100x or 200x magnification to confirm they are cells) and individually record the number of cells present in each well's droplet (Fig. 1b to d) . -Exclude droplet from further analysis if full visualisation is hindered (Fig. 1e to h) . -Add growth medium, and incubate plates. Record all wells containing colonies; only progress colonies from wells that both scientists agree contains only one cell. -Data analysis: -Each scientist's observations categorised as: 0 cells, 1 cell or >1 cell -Observed outcome for each well: growth or no growth -Probability of monoclonality estimated from data using a statistical model Cloning (LDC) Increased accuracy of P(monoclonality) with CACC -LDC weakness: no visualisation after seeding (to check both well seeding and subsequent growth of colonies is well described by the Poisson distribution), potentially overestimating P(monoclonality) -Addressed by CACC: Visual examination with colonies arising from wells seeded with 1 cell distinguished from those seeded with >1 cell -Visualisation step further strengthened by: Using controls for exclusion of wells; measuring errors based on the presence or absence of colonies in wells where two scientists independently reported 0 cells; and formally analysing the data using a suitable statistical model Decreased time and resource requirements with CACC -High P(monoclonality) possible in single round as each well examined individually with only those containing a single cell progressed, and because the error rate for incorrect scoring is considered to be low two scientists miss a cell one cell sitting on top of another and the two thus appearing as one An experiment was performed to estimate error frequency [3] . Conclusion -Scientists miss a cell infrequently (in the range 0.4% to 1.3%, [3] ) -Error frequency does not invalidate use of direct observation methods for cell cloning -Single cell seen by both scientists is highly likely to be monoclonal Gene synthesis and vector construction of IgG1 and fluorophore-expressing vectors was done by Atum. Vectors were transfected into CHOZN® GS -/cells via electroporation. Analysis of GFP and RFP expression was achieved using a MACSQuant instrument. Selection and generation of stable pools and single cell clones from transfections with IgG1-encoding vectors was performed as described in the CHOZN® Platform Technical Bulletin. Titer analysis was performed in static (96 well plate), in a 7 day TPP assay and in a 14 day fed batch assay using a QK ForteBio. The general process is outlined in Fig. 1. (A) The traditional antibiotics resistance marker is replaced by an siRNA, which is cotranscribed with the GoI. Unlike in antibiotic resistance, the marker here is not a protein, reducing the translational burden and providing more resources for GoI production [3] .  Plasmid vectors containing combinations of either the human HNRPA2B1-CBX3 UCOE® (A2UCOE®) or murine Rps3 UCOE® linked to different viral promoters (hCMV, gpCMV, SFFV) driving expression of an eGFP reporter gene were functionally analysed by stable transfection into CHO-K1 cells and expression analysed by flow cytometry and qPCR to determine vector copy number. In order to create stable cell lines, we transfected our CHO DG44 host cells by electroporation. Cells processed using the standard approach were cultivated in selective medium or medium containing additional 2.5 nM methotrexate (MTX) for three weeks. After an amplification step with 30 nM MTX for three weeks, stable individual cell pools were expanded and clones were generated by FACS-sorting. Clones were analyzed for growth performance and product concentration in fed-batch studies. In our new CLD 2.0 approach, we increased MTX concentrations (2.5 nM, 5 nM and 10 nM MTX) during the first selection phase of three weeks. Afterwards we omitted the 30 nM MTX amplification step. Thereby, pool generation finished four weeks earlier than in the standard approach. To evaluate the stability of cell clones derived from Mini Pools (MPs) generated according to the CLD 2.0 approach, stability studies were performed for eight weeks, including stability fed batches at t=2 weeks and t=8 weeks. Altogether three different proteins of interest with six cell clones each were tested. To identify the high expression sites in the CHO cells, we employed NGS to analyze the integration sites of a high producing cell line (titer > 3g/L). The pair-end reads with one read mapped to the vector and the other read mapped to the CHO reference genome are extracted to identify the integration sites. To test the expression activity of the integration sites, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 to specifically integrate the antibody gene into CHO genome for expression. Bligh-Dyer method was used to extract the lipids and extracts were analyzed by HP-TLC and MS. The polar lipids were separated into different categories by 2-D HP-TLC using a CHCl 3 -MeOH-H 2 O (71:25:2.5, v/v/v) solvent system in the first dimension and a CHCl 3 -MeOH-Acetic acid-H 2 O (76:9:12:2, v/v/v/v) solvent system in the second dimension. Non-polar lipids were separated by 1-D HPTLC using hexane-diethyl ether-acetic acid. 2,7-dichlorofluorescein dye was used to visualize both polar and non-polar lipids. Further detailed analysis was performed on a QqQ mass spectrometer (Thermo TSQ VANTAGE, San Jose, CA) using negative-ion and positive-ion ESI modes as well as negative-ion ESI mode in the presence of lithium hydroxide. A panel of 20 cell lines expressing a model recombinant monoclonal antibody were characterised in terms of growth, productivity, intracellular recombinant protein and mRNA amounts. Assays were also developed to investigate cell attributes using the commercially available ImageStream instrument, an imaging flow cytometer, which enables the investigation of cellular characteristics that correlate with cell productivity at the single cell level. We intended to develop a platform to generate high yield producing cell lines carrying 1-2 copy of the integrated target gene using transposon system. Two CHO cell lines, CHO-S cells and DXB11 cells, have been applied. Cells were co-transfected with transposon and target gene expression plasmids. After drug selection, the cell pool with highest productivity per target gene copy was applied to single cell cloning. The productivity and copy number of cell clones were determined, and the stability of cell clones was analysed after culture of about 60 generations. Three different cell lines were cultured in a 2-liter bioreactor: CHO-S, HEK293SF and hybridoma KB-26.5. For the FBA, two adapted genome-scale metabolic models were used: a reconstruction of Mus musculus for CHO and hybridoma [3] , and a reconstruction of Human metabolic model (Recon 2) for HEK293 [4] . Tzmb heavy and light chains were cloned in two bicistronic plasmids (pIRESpuro3 and pIRESneo3, Clontech) and in a tricistronic plasmid derived from pIRESpuro3. IFNα2b was spliced to Tzmb heavy chain by overlap extension PCR and the resulting Tzmb-IFNα2b fusion protein was also cloned in the expression vectors in the same way than non-modified Tzmb. Selected cell pools were cultured in 125 ml shake flasks containing SFMTransfx supplemented with 10% v/v of Cell Boost 5 (HyClone), 4 mM of GlutaMAX (Gibco) and 2 μg/ml of puromycin and also with 700 μg/ml neomycin in the case of the cells transfected with pIRES-neo3. Cells were cultivated in the same conditions as described elsewhere [2] . Purified products (using protein A chromatography (HiTrap MabSelect Sure, ÄKTA Avant 150)) were quantified by both ELISA and SDS-PAGE. Antigen binding test was performed in Sk-br-3 breast cancer cell line by means of flow cytometry analysis. The biological activity of the different candidates was tested with MTT assay. Therefore, three different cell lines (HEK 293, 293T, 293FT) were investigated concerning their productivity of LVV and their growing behavior in the in-house serum-free medium TransMACS. As part of this, Design of Experiment was used to investigate the optimal conditions for PEI/ DNA-transfection. Furthermore, this statistical approach was used focusing an ideal ratio between the 3rd generation plasmids (transfer plasmid CD20-CAR or GFP, envelope plasmid, packaging plasmids). In addition, different enhancers (sodium butyrate, lithium acetate, caffeine, trichostatin A, cholesterol, hydroxyurea, valproic acid) were investigated concerning their effects on productivity comparing HEK cultures producing LVV encoding for GFP-marker or CD20-CAR. A CHO-K1 cell line stably expressing an IgG was used for knockdown experiments. SgRNAs were designed to target the seed region of each miRNA member and stable mixed populations were generated (Fig. 1a) . Total RNA form each mixed population was reverse transcribed into cDNA using miRNA specific stemloop primers. The expression was quantified by RT-qPCR. To further analyse the range of indels the miR-23a and miR-23b clusters were amplified by a standard high-fidelity PCR. Amplicons were cloned into pCR TM -TOPO® vector and positive clones were analysed by Sanger sequencing. Cell growth was monitored using ViaCount TM viability stain on a Guava TM benchtop flow cytometer. Productivity was assessed by ELISA. Students t-test was used for statistical analysis. We performed 1) chase assay, 2) immunofluorescent microscopy observation, and 3) size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis to investigate the duration of secretion, bottleneck position, and formation of recombinant IgG, respectively. High-producer CHO cells expressing humanized IgG1 [4] and IgG3 were used. For the chase assay, cells were cultivated in shake flasks with serum-free medium containing 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) to stop nascent peptide synthesis. The amounts of IgG both remaining in the cell and secreted into the medium at each time point were measured by quantitative western blotting. For immunofluorescent microscopy observation, cells were cultivated on coverslips with CHX for 4 h. Immunofluorescent staining against the recombinant IgG, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Golgi apparatus was performed after chemical fixation. For SEC, cells cultured with CHX were re-suspended in a buffer containing tritonX-100 and injected into a column. The amount of IgG in each fraction was measured by quantitative western blotting. All five variants were expressed transiently in HEK293-6E cells and binding affinities were investigated in two individual settings with bio-layer interferometry. In the first approach concentrated cell culture supernatants were directly applied and mAbs were captured on protein A tips, blocked with 3D6scFv-Fc and the association and dissociation of 2F5 IgG was measured. For the second approach, the culture supernatants were purified and the affinity was determined with streptavidin biosensors. First, biotinylated 2F5 IgG was bound and then the association/dissociation of the purified 3H6 variants was measured. The chosen CHO cell lines were cultivated in triplicates in SILAC media containing isotopically-labeled lysine/arginine (hLys/hArg) and in parallel in identical standard media (lLys/lArg, TCX10D, Xell). Cell density, viability, metabolism and cell cycle distribution were monitored during 50 ml batch culture for 7-8 days. At day 3.25 IGF was added into hLys/hArg cultures. 5 min later a part of the cells was harvested. For MS analysis IGF-treated (hLys/hArg cultures) and control cultures (lLys/lArg cultures) were combined. The following MS sample preparation workflow included digestion of whole protein lysate and phosphopeptide enrichment via TIO 2beads. NanoLC-ESI-Orbitrap MS (Q Exactive Plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific) of phosphopeptides was excecuted with subsequent identification and quantification in MaxQuant [1] . In addition to SILAC quantification of H/L ratios for investigation of IGF effects, aquired data was also used to perform label-free quantification (LFQ) in MaxQuant [1] for comparison of cell lines. Statistical significance was calculated via t-test (p<0.05) or ANOVA (permutation-based FDR<0.05) in Perseus [2] . Results IGF effects on growth and production The IGF treatment resulted in a prolonged viability for all cell lines. However, an increased VCD was only observed for producer cell line 1, yielding in an enhanced integral of VCD (IVCD). For the parental cells growth was inhibited by IGF, although S-phase cells were enriched at least temporary (Fig. 1a) . Regarding antibody production IGF led to a decreased qP and product titer, concomitantly with an increase in S-phase cells (Fig.  1a) . This inverse correlation of proliferation and cell specific productivity is known from different productivity enhancing molecules, like butyrate [3] . MS investigation of signaling events The phosphoproteomic experiment resulted in the identification of 10.485 class I-phosphorylation sites. Statistical evaluation of phosphopeptide abundances in Perseus showed up 144 significant differences between the cell lines and led to producer vs. parental classifications (Fig. 1b) . The quantitative evaluation via SILAC yielded in about 2.408 quantifiable phosphosites in at least 6 biological replicates. Rapid phosphorylation changes after growth factor treatment indicated signaling towards protein synthesis, cell cycle and regulation of actin cytoskeleton amongst others. For 201 phosphosites significantly different H/L ratios were calculated between the two groups parental vs. producer, four of them are listed (Table 1) . Plasmid vector carrying the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) was transfected into CHO cell line producing IgG1 antibody. After G418 selection and single colony isolation, EBNA1 expression was checked with capillary electrophoresis system Wes (ProteinSimple). EBV EBNA1-antibody (1EB12) was used for detection as the primary antibody. The expression vector for the gene of interest was prepared by inserting 1508 bp of an oriP DNA sequence into a plasmid vector carrying CAG promoter, resulting in the pOTC vector. PEI max (Polysciences, Inc.) and BalanCD Transfectory CHO (Irvine Scientific) were used for the transfection. The number of viable cells and GFP-positive cells were counted using Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The transfected cells were cultured in CELLSTAR CELLreactor tubes. The tubes were incubated in a Climo-shaker ISF1-X (Kuhner). Antibody production was measured using biolayer interferometry with an Octet QK system (Fortebio). All expression vectors comprised a hCMV promoter and BGH polyadenylation sequence in the expression cassettes for the gene of interest, and a selection marker gene with SV40 promoter and SV40 polyadenylation sequence. 2G UNic™ Vectors also contained genetic elements (2G UNic™ technology, ProteoNic). CHO GS null cells (Horizon Discovery) were transfected in duplicate with Reference or 2GUN expression vectors and selected in media lacking glutamine and containing the appropriate antibiotics. The bulk pools were seeded at equal viable cell density after obtaining maximum viability and cultured for 9 days without feeding (batch). Expression of the target protein in cell culture supernatants of stable bulk pools was measured by ELISA. Transcriptome analyses using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)-based high-coverage expression profiling (HiCEP) and de novo mRNA-seq were performed on DG44-SC20, DG44-SC39, IgG3-SC20 and IgG3-SC39. To compare cell lines with different numbers of chromosomes, transcriptome data from mRNA-seq were adjusted for cell number using RNA reference materials (NMIJ CRM 6204-a; National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology) mixed at equal amounts per cell. Pathways related to differentially expressed genes were searched using KeyMolnet (KM Data). Recombinant expression of hBMP2 was investigated in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells and in stable clones established in CHO-K1 cells cultivated in ExCell and Pro-CHO5 medium, respectively. Protein stability and interaction of the hBMP2 with the producer cells were investigated in vitro using commercially available rhBMP2. In addition, we investigated a cell-free protein synthesis system harboring translocationally active microsomal structures, hence having the potential to perform post-translational modifications, as an alternative production method. The paramagnetic nano-stars library was synthesized by coating maghemite nanoparticles (γ-Fe 2 O 3 ) with a thin silica-shell functionalized with an atomic transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) initiator. PDMAEMA arms were grown from the core particles via ATRP. In one case, the PDMAEMA arms was end-capped with PDEGMA blocks produced during a second ATRP step. All nanostars were characterized by size exclusion chromatography and thermogravimetry to calculate number and length of the PDMAEMA arms. The core diameter was determined by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The different variants (Table 1) were analyzed for their ability to complex pDNA (pEGFP-N1) using various physicochemical methods (DLS, Zeta sizer). Transfection efficiency/cytotoxicity in CHO-K1 cells were determined by flow cytometry. Transfected cells were placed in a magnetic field and the influence of the polymer architecture on the magnetic separation was investigated. Nonparametric Spearman analysis was used to correlate between arm length/arm densities, magnetic properties of the cells and transfection efficiency. Anti-rhesus IgG-secreting CHO cells [2] were cultured in SF-CDM in 125 mL shake flasks. The cells were treated with varying concentrations (30-500 ng/mL) of tunicamycin in a batch culture. Further, the effect of treatment with tunicamycin for short periods of time (24 hrs) was also evaluated. IgG titers and mRNA expression levels were quantified using ELISA and qRT-PCR (Illumina), respectively. Results CHO cells were treated with different concentrations of tunicamycin and cultured in a batch for 8 days (referred as Continuous treatment/CTE). Figure 1a presents the maximum VCD and % drop in viability under treatment. A dose-dependent inhibitory effect is observed on growth and viability of cells in CTE-cultures, with minimal inhibition as lower concentrations. Contrastingly, IgG titers (Fig. 1b) were higher in treated cultures w.r.t. control in initial phase of the cultures at all the concentrations of tunicamycin. The per-cell productivity (Fig. 1c) also showed a significant increase w.r.t control at all the concentrations of tunicamycin. However, the increased productivity due to tunicamycin was not sustained and levels become similar to control after day 3 (data not shown). To prevent loss of viability due to tunicamycin, the effect of short-term treatment (STE) with tunicamycin was explored. Cells treated with tunicamycin for 24 hours were harvested (corresponding to day 2 of CTE cultures) and inoculated in fresh media. The STE-cultures showed improved viability and higher maximum VCD as compared to CTE-cultures (Fig. 1a) . The fold increase in IgG titers was not sustained beyond day 1-2 in STEcultures ( Fig. 1d ) but significant increase in productivity was seen in the initial phase (Fig. 1e) . Further, the cells were adapted over 25 continuous generations under 30ng/mL tunicamycin. The adapted cells had overall 1.3-fold higher productivity, as compared to control (Fig. 1f) , in a batch culture. To understand the molecular basis of increase in productivity, mRNA expression level of key genes was determined. XBP1s is a transcription factor involved in activation of chaperones (like Grp78, Calreticulin) and apoptotic genes (such as CHOP). Significant increase in the levels of calreticulin was seen on treatment with tunicamycin (Fig. 1g) . Both XBP1s and Grp78 were marginally induced when treated with 30ng/mL of tunicamycin in both CTE-and STE-cultures (Fig. 1h) , and significantly up-regulated when treated with 500ng/mL of tunicamycin. The CHOP mRNA levels also increase with increasing tunicamycin concentrations, with levels in STE-cultures lower than CTE-cultures (Fig. 1h) . The results suggest that UPR induction may be important to increase productivity in these CTE/STE-cultures. Note that, tunicamycin had no effect on the expression levels of IgG heavy-chain, thus eliminating the involvement of IgGHC-mRNA in increasing productivity (Fig. 1i) . A gene map of chromosome 1 was constructed by combining the BAC-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based chromosome physical map and sequence data of mapped BAC clones. The sequences of BAC clones were searched by BLAST with NCBI and CHOgenome.org databases. Three different regions on chromosomes A and B were selected based on CHO genomic BAC library sequences as target sites. CHO-K1 cells were stably transfected by lipofection. The target sequences were broken using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system and humanized IgG1 genes were integrated by non-homologous end joining recombination. Transfection without using the CRISPR/ Cas9 system was also performed. These cell pools were cultivated for six days with serum-supplemented medium, and their levels of antibody productivity were evaluated by ELISA. Copy number analysis was also performed using real-time PCR. Results and discussion Construction of gene map of chromosome 1: Eighty-three BAC clones were mapped onto chromosomes A and B (each clone contained 100-150 kb of the CHO genome sequence). As a result of annotations of 83 BAC clone sequences, 91 genes were mapped on chromosome 1. Investigation of the differences of productivity among antibodyproducing cells that were constructed by chromosome 1 targeting and/or random integration: Cell growth was not affected by the gene targeting site. The specific production rates of antibodyproducing cell pools constructed by gene targeting of chromosome 1 were higher than those of the cell pool constructed by random integration. All cell pools constructed by gene targeting showed lower copy numbers of heavy chain and light chain in genomic DNA than those in the cell pool constructed by random integration, despite showing high productivity. A viral vector plasmid (pQMSCV/HD[scFv-Fc]) encoding reporter genes and an scFv-Fc expression unit flanked with wild-type and mutant loxPs was constructed for the production of IDRVs. Cre-IDRVs were produced described previously [2] . Results and discussion Figure 1a shows a schematic drawing of each round of targeted transgene integration using Cre-IDRVs harboring an scFv-Fc expression unit. (Fig. 1b) . Genomic DNA extracted from the cells were subjected to PCR using specific primer pairs α and β, and γ and δ to confirm site-specific integration. DNA fragments with expected sizes were amplified in each cell clone (Fig. 1c) . These results indicate that site-specific repeated integration was achieved using Cre-IDRVs. In contrast, scFv-Fc productivity in CHO/HD[scFv-Fc]×2 cells was slightly decreased compared with that of CHO/NE[scFv-Fc]×1 (data not shown). Although the reason remains unclear, repeat-induced gene silencing might occur due to tandem repeat structure of expression units. We reported improved recombinant antibody production using a production enhancer element [4] . Such a cis-regulatory element might be a feasible approach to enhance the productivity. The purpose of this work was to develop a robust lipidomics method applied to mammalian cell cultures in a three step method: extraction, separation and detection (Fig. 1 ). Both Matyash [1] and Folch [2] extraction method were performed on our cells to reach the highest yield. Two separation techniques were also tested: hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and reverse phase chromatography. Finally lipid classes' identification was achieved by tandem mass spectrometry analysis thanks to structure-specific fragmentation ions. The experimental design comprises a two level factorial screening, set-up using Design Expert V9.For the transduction 60,000 c/cm 2 were seeded in 24-well plates with DMEM + 10% FCS and incubated overnight at 37°C, 8% CO 2 and humidified atmosphere. The recombinant baculovirus using an integrated EF1α promoter to control GFP expression, described elsewhere [18] , was diluted to the respective concentrations in the different surrounding fluids. After discarding the cultivation medium of the hMSC-TERT, 1 mL of virus containing solution was added to the cells. The following incubation was varied in duration before replacing the virus solution with growth medium and an incubation overnight. 24 h post transduction (hpt) the cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized with 100 μL Trypsin/EDTA and incubated for 5 min at 37°C. Trypsination was then stopped applying 100 μL soybean trypsin inhibitor and the cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. The suspension adapted HEK-FreeStyle 293-F cell line was used for the experiments in chemically defined animal component free media (HEK-TF, HEK-GM (Xell AG), Freestyle F17 (Thermo Fisher Scientific)). Samples for viable cell density and viabilities were taken daily and analyzed using an automated cell counting system (CEDEX, Roche Diagnostics). Transient transfection of 3×10 6 cells/ml was carried out with polyethylenimine Max in a 1:4 DNA-PEI ratio (w/w) with 2 μg DNA. Three plasmids (pGOI, pRepCap, pHelper) were applied in a molar 1:1:1 ratio (Fig. 1a) . Pretests were performed in orbital shaking tube spin bioreactors. For scale-up, batch processes were carried out in 125 ml shake flasks as well as in 2 l stirred bioreactors at 30% air saturation and pH 7.1. Transfection efficiencies and rAAV production were quantified by flow cytometry using a GOI coding for a fluorescent protein and qPCR of genomic copies, respectively. We have been using the Sk-Hep-1 human cell line for the production of recombinant FVII. To generate the recombinant cell line we have used a bicistronic lentiviral vector, 1054-GFP, containing a FVII gene and the GFP selection marker gene. A master cell bank and a work cell bank were generated in GMP conditions. The rFVII analyses were made by ELISA assay, western blot, gene expression quantification and biological activity using the Prothrombin Time (PT) assay. rFVII purification by affinity chromatography using VIISelect (GE) column. After purification the rFVII was formulated and dry froze to be used in in vivo experiments. Our expertise in the field of microbeads design using jetcutting technology [4] enabled us to engineer +/-200 μm alginate beads of various G/M monomer ratio. We used jetcutter (geniaLab Gmbh) with 100 μm nozzle at max speed 12000 rpm. Alginate solutions with concentrations 2% to 4% were gelifyed in 2% CaCl2 EtOH 50% solution. Alginates with estimated viscosity (@1%) from 30 to 720 mPa were tested. A further surface treatment with gelatine (0,1%, 1%) and poly-L-lysine (0,1%) was carried out to reach an optimal cell anchoring of human adiposederived mesenchymal stem cells (ATCC-PSC-500-011) in MesemPro RS medium (Gibco). The CI-huOB cell line was recently described and cultivated in huOB Maintenance Medium (InSCREENeX, Germany). For spheroid creation CI-huOBs were grown in a monolayer, magnetized by adding a magnetic nanoparticle assembly (NanoShuttle, NS, Nano3D Biosciences, Houston, TX, USA) at a concentration of 4μl NS/cm 2 growth area. After an overnight incubation magnetized CI-huOB were detached and seeded into Cellstar® Cell-Repellent 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany). With the help of mild magnetic forces cells were printed into spheroids within 2h. These consist of 1.000-50.000 cells and were cultured for a period of up to 50 days. The cell viability was analyzed by a Propidium iodide (PI) and Calcein AM staining. To improve spheroid functionality spheroids were cultivated with huOB Differentiation Medium (InSCREENeX, Germany). "Mini bone" tissue functionality and thus mineralization was analyzed by an alkaline phosphatase (alkaline phosphatase activity) and an alizarin red S Staining (Ca 2+ deposits).
