We employ monthly Bursa Malaysia index (BMKLCI) series together with selected fundamental and behavioural risk proxies spanning from January, 1977 to December, 2014. The analyses are segmented into six different period clusters, namely; overall, pre-industrialization, post-industrialization, millennium, non-crisis, and crisis. Similar approach (use of sub-sample) has also been undertaken by some researchers reviewed in this article. The weak informational efficiency is examined using autocorrelation (AR) and variance ratio (VR) tests. As a robustness test, the behaviour of stock prices and riskereturn relationships are inspected using ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile (QR) regression approaches. In the first analysis, the AR test is performed. The AR tests as presented in Eq. (1), measure the serial correlation coefficient between a series of returns and its lagged value with the null hypothesis; AR ¼ 0 for all lag. The objective is to examine whether the return series is truly random in a sense that it will exhibit zero autocorrelation behaviour. This indicates a predictability pattern of stock returns based on its past series information. From this model, a positive and significant autocorrelation indicates that the series contains a trend. While a negative one implies a reversal in series behaviour (Ratner, 1996) . In the second analysis, the VR test is conducted. The VR test of Lo and MacKinlay (1988) is one of the standard measures of market efficiency that examine whether the variance of the logarithms of a variable series following a random walk. The variance ratio at lag q (VR(q)) of the q difference series is calculated as in Eq. (2) with the null hypothesis; VR ¼ 1 for all lag. Where P s 2 c ðqÞ is an unbiased estimator of 1/q of the variance of the qth-differenced series. While P s 2 a ðqÞ is an unbiased estimator of the variance of the first-differenced series. Theoretically, if the natural logarithm of the series ðp t Þ to follow a random walk behaviour which is defined as p t ¼ a þ p tÀ1 þ ε t , the variance of the qth differenced series ðr t À r tÀq Þ is expected to equal to q times the variance of the first difference series ðr t À r tÀ1 Þ. The VR(q) in Eq. (2) will be estimated using two alternative test statistics. The first statistic Z(q) is a test based on homoscedastic data behaviour which assumes i.i.d. error terms. The second statistic Z*(q) provide adjustment on possible heteroscedasticity in the error terms and does not require the assumption of normality. Technically, VR less then unity implying a mean reverting process. While, VR increasing in q indicates mean aversion behaviour (Jasic & Wood, 2006) . . X s 2 a ðqÞ ð 2Þ To uncover the dynamic behaviour, in the final analysis, the stock returns autocorrelations and riskereturn relationships are examined and compared using the standard OLS and QR approach. In the standard linear regression of OLS method as presented in Eq. (3), the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is summarized based on the conditional mean function, Eðy i jx i Þ that provides at best, only the average perspectives. In OLS method, the estimation of model prediction error (ε i ) is based on minimization of P i ε 2 i . As an alternative, in QR method as presented in Eq. (4), the relationship between dependent and independent variables are estimated based on the conditional median function, Q ðqÞ ðy i jx i Þ of specific quantile (q) of the empirical distribution. Where conditional quantiles range between 0 < q < 1 and the QR can be performed from q0 to q1 with q0.5 known as the median regression. This means that, the data is split into proportions of q below and 1 À q above. In the estimation of the model prediction error, median regression minimizes P i ε i and QR minimizes a sum that gives asymmetric penalties ð1 À qÞjε i j for overprediction and qjε i j for underprediction. Unlike OLS, the QR is more robust to outliers and does not require fulfilment of normal distribution of the error process (Koenker & Bassett, 1978; Koenker & Hallock, 2001) .
