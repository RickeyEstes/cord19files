Four samples were obtained from the upper respiratory tract of each patient, in the following order: (i) nasal swab, (ii) nasal aspirate, (iii) nasal wash, and (iv) nasal brush, using one nostril for each procedure and alternating nostrils, with an interval of 5-10 min. A nasal swab sample (i) was obtained with a cotton tip (MW104, Medical Wire & Equipment, UK), rubbing the middle meatus. The cotton tips were washed twice in 1 ml of normal saline, spun for 10 min at 400 g and stored at −80 • C. (ii) A nasal aspirate was taken using a sterile mucus trap connected to gentle wall suction. If there was obvious mucus present, the trap was inserted slowly into the nostril and moved slowly in and out while sucking the mucus. A total of 0.5-1 ml of mucus and 5 ml of sterile normal saline, used to wash all the material from the tubing, was obtained. (iii) Nasal washes were performed after 2.5 ml of normal saline were instilled in one nostril (older patients were asked to avoid swallowing). The mucus was harvested 30 s later, using a sterile mucus trap connected to gentle wall suction. The aspirates and washes were placed on wet ice and stored at −80 • C as soon as possible. (iv) Nasal brushings were harvested from the nasal cavity with a brush (Cytobrush Plus, Medscand Medical, Sweden) by sampling the middle meatus. The brushes were washed twice in 1 ml of normal saline, spun for 10 min at 400 g and stored at −80 • C.
