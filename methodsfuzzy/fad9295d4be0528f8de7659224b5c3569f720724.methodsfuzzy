Univariate analysis was performed to identify which variables were significantly associated with seropositivity. The magnitude of association between the variables and seropositivity is expressed as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Statistical significance was set at P < 0.01. Analyses were performed using SPSS software version 17.0 (IBM, USA).
