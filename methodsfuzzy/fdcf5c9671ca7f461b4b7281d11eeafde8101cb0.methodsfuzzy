Melting points were recorded in a Mel-Temp apparatus and are uncorrected. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Merck precoated 60F 254 plates. Reactions were monitored by TLC on silica gel, with detection by UV light (254 nm) or by charring with sulfuric acid. Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel (240-400 mesh, Merck). 1 H, 19 F and 13 C NMR spectra were obtained at room temperature with a Brucker 400 0045-2068/$ -see front matter Ã“ 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.bioorg.2010.08.001 spectrometer at 400, 376 and 100 MHz, respectively, using CDCl 3 and methanol-d 4 (CD 3 OD) with internal tetramethylsilane (TMS) for 1 H and 13 C and internal trifluorotoluene (TFT) for 19 F. The chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million (d) and following abbreviations were used: s = singlet, d = doublet, dd = doublet doublet, dtr = doublet triplet and m = multiplet. Mass spectra were obtained with a Micromass Platform LC (ESI-MS). Infrared spectra were obtained with a Perkin-Elmer Model 1600 FT-IR spectrophotometer. Optical rotations were measured using an Autopol I polarimeter. All reactions were carried out in dry solvents. Acetonitrile was distilled from calcium hydride and stored over 3E molecular sieves. Dimethylformamide (DMF) was also stored over 3E molecular sieves, and pyridine was stored over potassium hydroxide pellets. A mixture of methanolic ammonia (140 mL) and N 4 -benzoylcytosine derivative 2d [11] (1.70 g, 3.36 mmol) stirred for 4 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated and crude 3f was obtained (0.83 g, 90%, R f = 0.15 in AcOEt) as colorless oil. Product 3f was used without further purification. a
