The investigations were performed in spring and early summer 2003 on 14 dairy farms in Ostfriesland and Weser-Ems counties (Lower Saxony, Germany). All farms had a history of suspected clinical coccidiosis during the last 6-8 years. On 10-15% of the farms, faecal samples were examined previously and coccidia were found. Groups of animals on all farms were repeatedly showing watery diarrhoea. Usually less than 5% of the animals died within the first 3 weeks post turnout, and more than 50% showed severe weight loss post turnout. All data were analysed descriptively using appropriate descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and 95% confidence intervals for continuous data, while frequencies and relative percentages along with respective 95% confidence intervals were displayed for categorical data. Associations between variables were analysed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. A nominal significance level of 5% (a = 0.05) was used for all statistical tests. No multiple testing adjustments were carried out. All analyses were performed using the SAS statistical analysis software Version 8.2, SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA.
