A system of geocoding was developed to match 'postal addresses' to an existing spatial database. In this setting in rural Kenya, compounds are known by the name of the compound head, usually the patriarch of the family. Individuals have three names, two given and one family name. Names of the compound head were collected as part of the questionnaire at the facility. Names were matched to an existing database of names of compound heads with associated spatial coordinates collected as part of a large cross-sectional survey in the area. This community survey sampled about one third of the population [27] . As not all compounds were sampled during the community survey, the names of the three nearest neighbours were also collected at the facility to increase the probability of finding a match. This method would be useful in areas that have existing and updated registries with accompanying spatial information and could easily be applied to all scales, depending on the availability of baseline data. Analysis was restricted to those compounds located in the area of the community survey. Names from the two databases were matched using Levenshtein's distance algorithm [28] for string matching using Stata v. 12.1 (StataCorp, USA). Possible matches, where the matching probability was 580%, were checked manually. Matches were discarded if: (a) there was more than one compound head with the same name in either database; (b) if only one of the three names was recorded; or (c) if all three names were provided but at least one of the names did not match. This process was repeated for the names of the nearest neighbours. All likely matches were plotted in ArcGIS v. 10.1 (ESRI, USA) and the distance between the actual geolocated compound and the matched compound from the community survey was calculated. Compounds from the health-facility survey were considered successfully located if they were <250 m from the corresponding compound in the community survey. This resolution was a pragmatic choice as it was deemed an acceptable balance between accuracy and spatial resolution, as this area would only likely comprise 2 or 3 compounds. The second method assessed was participatory mapping, and was similar to the recently published 'map-book' exercise [25] and involved producing poster-sized, high-resolution satellite images (Quickbird; Digital Globe, USA) of each facility catchment area (Fig. 2) . Locations of health facilities, schools, markets and other key landmarks were labelled on the image and a reference grid consisting of 2 × 2·5 km 'blocks' was superimposed on the area [27] . Each block comprised 20 'cells', each measuring 500 × 500 m. Each block/cell combination was given a unique numeric identifier. The system (including size of polygon) was selected because it was familiar to the field workers and would provide them a better frame of reference for facilitating the exercise. As part of the participant questionnaire, the interviewer would explain the main features of the satellite map and with the participant, would attempt to locate the residence on the map and record the corresponding cell identifier. Due to the spatial resolution required to locate compounds, this approach is most applicable to local scale but could be scaled up if satellite imagery was indexed into a book-format instead of a poster. Locations of participants followed to their compounds were plotted in ArcGIS and were classified as correctly located based on the participatory mapping exercise if they fell within the reported cell. To account for the likely edge effect with compounds located just outside a grid cell being considered incorrect, the proportion of compounds correctly identified within 500 m (one cell) or 1000 m (two cells) surrounding the reported block/cell was also calculated. The distance between the edge of the cell/buffer and the incorrectly located compounds was calculated in ArcGIS to determine the mean error associated with the approach. The final method tested was to see if participants resided in the catchment of self-reported nearest landmarks. This approach is the most flexible and could be easily applied at all scales, given a database of the relevant landmark with accompanying spatial information is available. At the health facility, each participant was asked to name the nearest health facility, primary school, market and church to their compound. Combinations of responses were also assessed using overlapping catchment areas to increase the precision of the approach. Locations of compounds were plotted using ArcGIS and a compound was considered to be correctly located if it fell within the catchment area or intersecting catchment areas that matched the response provided at the facility. Catchment areas for each type of landmark were estimated based on both Euclidian distance (straightline) and cost distance [29, 30] . There were some missing coordinates for certain reported schools. Therefore, analysis was restricted to participants who reported residing near the schools with known coordinates. Euclidian distances were calculated using the ArcGIS Euclidian distance tool in the spatial analyst package to delineate catchment areas for both health facilities (Fig. 3a) and primary schools (Fig. 3b) . A cost-distance function to account for factors that may either impede or facilitate travel was also used to delineate landmark catchment areas. Given the gently undulating topography of the study area, it was assumed that ease and speed of travel between compounds and relevant landmarks is determined either by the presence of roads (facilitating travel) or by the presence of rivers (impeding travel). Roads and rivers in the study area were digitized using highresolution Quickbird satellite multispectral imagery at 2·8 m resolution sharpened with a 60 cm resolution panchromatic image. Roads were classified into four categories: (1) tarred roads where the likely maximum speed is 80 km/h; (2) roads that are not tarred but where vehicles travel at a likely maximum speed of 40 km/h; (3) roads that are not tarred but accessible to a vehicle or motorbike with likely maximum speeds of 20 km/h; (4) paths not likely traversed by a vehicle but by motorbike with likely maximum speeds of 10 km/h. For all other surfaces, including walking paths or fields, a maximum speed of 5 km/h was assumed [23] . Rivers were classified as barriers to movement except where they were intersected by a road or path. The cost-distance models for both health facilities (Fig. 3c ) and primary schools (Fig. 3d) were created using IDRISI software (Clark Laboratories, USA) and imported into ArcGIS for analysis. The mean error for both methods was calculated as the distance between the border of the catchment and the location of the incorrectly located compound. The distance between each compound and the centroid of each polygon could have been calculated. However, due to the irregular shape of many of the polygons, the distance to the centroid is not be an accurate reflection of the error rate in this approach as points that are far away from the centroid but located to the correct catchment area would generate a large error rate and be misleading. Of the geolocated participants, 519 lived within the area of the community cross-sectional malaria survey and could be used for geolocation. Of the 328 matched compounds, 56% were successfully located using the head of compound. Of the participants that were matched, 72·9% were correctly located to within 250 m (95% CI 67·7-77·6, median distance 36·2 m). Possible reasons for why more people were not correctly matched may include people not being familiar with the full names of their neighbours or reporting different heads of compound for the same  Using the participatory mapping approach, 64·9% (95% CI 61·2-68·4) of 695 participants who attempted the mapping exercise were successfully located to the appropriate 2 × 2·5 km block (Table 1) . When a 500 m buffer in all directions around the block was included, the proportion correctly located improved to 82% (95% CI 78·9-84·8) at the block level and from 12·4% (95% CI 10·0-15·0) to 57·1% (95% CI 53·3-60·8) at the cell level. However, 135 (16·3%) participants did not participate in the mapping exercise. Reasons for refusal were not recorded, but there were no differences in sex or age distributions in the populations who did and did not participate in the exercise. Of those willing to locate their residence, 61·5% were female compared to 58·9% in the unwilling group (P = 0·6). Similarly, the mean age in the adult populations in those unwilling to locate their residence was slightly higher at 37·9 years compared to 35·3 years in those that did attempt the exercise, although the difference was not significant (P = 0·3). For compounds that were incorrectly located, the median distance to the correct block was 489 m (IQR 229-1036 m), 1036 m (IQR 737-1737), and 1737 m (IQR 1179-2728) for the block only, >500 m buffer, and >1000 m buffer, respectively. The median distance of compounds incorrectly located from the identified cells was 539 m (IQR 236-1095 m), 1055 m (IQR 737-1644) including a 500 m buffer, and 1588 m (IQR 1200-2180 m) including a 1000 m buffer. Moreover, the proportion of people that were correctly identified to a specific block or cell significantly varied per facility (block only, P = 0·007; >500 m, P = 0·003; >1000 m, P < 0·0001). Analysis of self-reported nearest landmarks indicated that responses for nearest market tended to predominantly consider relatively large markets, rather than smaller, local markets. In addition there was too much variability in responses concerning the nearest church, the majority of which were small establishments whose spatial coordinates had not been recorded, to conduct meaningful analysis. For these reasons only data relating to the nearest health facility and primary school were retained. Overall, the nearest health facility and primary school were reported correctly 84·9% (95% CI 82·2-87·2) and 73·4% (95% CI 68·8-77·7) of the time, respectively, based on straight-line distance (median distance 1486 m, IQR 1008-2241 m). The use of the self-reported nearest primary school was able to locate 82·0% (95% CI 78·1-85·8) of participants' compounds to the correct Euclidian distance catchment area (mean area of 6·7 km 2 ) ( Table 2) with a median distance to the self-reported nearest school of 878 m (IQR 522-1234 m). The self-reported nearest health facility was able to locate 78·1% (95% CI 73·8-82·1) of compounds to an area of 12·3 km 2 . When the combination of responses was tested, the mean area reduced to 1·7 km 2 and 48·7% (95% CI 43·6-53·6) of participants' compounds were correctly located. Next, 77·1% (95% CI 74·1-80·0) and 78·1% (95% CI 73·8-82·1) of participants were located to the correct health facility and school catchments, respectively, using the cost-distance catchment area. The combined responses were able to locate individuals based on the combination of responses with 72·4% (95% CI 67·8-76·8) of compounds successfully located to a mean area of 3·7 km 2 (table 2). Of those individuals who did not reside in the catchment area of the reported nearest landmark, the mean distance away from the edge of the catchment area was 1252 m (IQR 261-1899 m) for catchments based on Euclidian distance and 496 m (IQR 174-605 m) using the cost-distance model.
