A major advantage of acoustic rhinometry over other methods is that it is a very simple technique to use and requires minimal patient cooperation. For measurement, the patient sits in the upright position, clears their nose of secretions, and places the disposable nosepiece attached to the end of the acoustic rhinometry tube into a nostril. Different size nosepieces are available and should fit comfortably but firmly into the external nares to ensure an airtight seal. In some instances, it may be necessary to apply a proprietary soft paraffin wax to ensure an airtight seal. Measurements are made separately for each nostril. It is suggested that subjects keep their eyes focused on a point marked on a wall to keep the same head position during repeated measurements. Studies have evaluated the use of a head frame to fix the head rigidly in a set position, but this approach has not been found to provide better results 80 ; rather paradoxically, the results have been reported to be less repeatable under such circumstances. However, the angle of the rhinometry tube is important, because the axis at which the sound travels in the nasal cavity should be parallel to the nasal floor from the nasal valve, and alterations influence the measurement. 81, 82 Measurements are made during breath holding, as the area-distance function may be affected by breathing. 83 The measurements are passive and require no other cooperation from the patient. A major misconception regarding hyperresponsiveness is that it is a phenomenon that globally affects every aspect of nasal function. It is important to realize, however, that the nasal mucosa comprises several functional elements, including sensory and effector nerves, submucosal glands, respiratory epithelium, goblet cells, subepithelial capillaries, capacitance vessels, and so forth, all of which are regulated by distinct mechanisms and have a certain degree of independence. Nasal symptoms are produced by the activity of 1 or more of these elements. For example, sneezing is produced by activation of nasal sensory nerves or by sensory nerves at a distant part of the body. Rhinorrhea, on the other hand, requires activation of the glandular apparatus, which may occur directly by a chemical stimulus or, most commonly, through cholinergic activation, via a central reflex. In the latter case, several elements of the mucosa are involved, namely sensory nerves, cholinergic effector nerves, and submucosal glands. Nasal symptoms do not always occur in concordance and, depending on the patient or the condition, different nasal symptoms may predominate. Allergic rhinitis characteristically involves sneezing and pruritus, something that is rather rare in patients with nonallergic rhinopathies. 151 Also, clinical observations have suggested that patients with rhinitis can be separated into sneezers, runners, or blockers on the basis of the predominance of the respective symptom. 155 Given this complexity, one has to attempt to define hyperresponsiveness as an attribute of a specific functional element of the nasal mucosa and not as a global condition. The terms sensorineural hyperresponsiveness, glandular hyperresponsiveness, and so forth should therefore be used. The problem arises as to which tests-that is, which stimuli-can reliably offer information on the responsiveness of specific functional elements of the nose. Unfortunately, only a few stimuli with single specificity for a particular functional element have been identified. Methacholine. One of the most specific stimuli is methacholine. In the nasal mucosa, it induces glandular secretions by activating cholinergic receptors on the basal surface of glandular epithelial cells. 156 Methacholine does not appear to affect the nasal vasculature, although the theoretical potential for vasodilation exists. 157 Clearly, methacholine does not activate sensory nerve endings. 158 The outcome of a methacholine nasal provocation can be the amount of nasal secretions produced by the stimulus or the content of nasal secretions in biochemical markers of mucus or serous gland activation. These can include mucus glycoproteins (which are very difficult to measure), the content of fucose (a characteristic sugar of the mucus glycoproteins), lysozyme, or lactoferrin (serous cell products). 159 Is there evidence of nasal hyperresponsiveness to methacholine-that is, of nasal glandular hyperresponsiveness? Several publications support the notion that such a form of nasal hyperresponsiveness does indeed exist. [160] [161] [162] [163] [164] There is also some evidence that nasal provocation with allergen can increase nasal responsiveness to methacholine. 165 Unfortunately, not all studies reproduce these findings. One study examined the effect of methacholine applied to the septal mucosa through filter paper discs in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis who were distinguishable from healthy controls when other tests for hyperresponsiveness were applied. There was no difference between the groups, 166 and no good explanation for this discrepancy was apparent. Capsaicin. Another stimulus with high specificity for a particular functional element of the nasal mucosa is capsaicin, the pungent component of hot peppers. Capsaicin stimulates a specific vanilloid receptor 167,168 on sensory nerve endings to induce a central reflex with its efferent arm leading to cholinergic glandular activation. 168, 169 Capsaicin induces a strong burning sensation but only induces sneezing at very low doses. In addition to the generation of neural reflexes, capsaicin can result in local release of neuropeptides by sensory nerve endings. These peptides can also stimulate glands and may induce plasma exudation from adjacent blood vessels. In the human nose, high doses of capsaicin may yield evidence of plasma exudation, but only in patients with active allergic rhinitis. 170 Despite this, it is difficult to define rhinitis by capsaicin provocation because of a considerable variability in response, and intranasal challenge cannot identify a particular type of nasal hyperresponsiveness. On the other hand, the ipsilateral and contralateral nostril secretory response to unilateral capsaicin provocation using the filter paper technique allows for a clear differentiation between healthy subjects and patients with active allergic rhinitis, with the ED 50 100-fold lower in the latter. 171 Histamine. Very little controversy exists about the ability of histamine to differentiate between active allergic rhinitis and the healthy state. 161, 163, [171] [172] [173] [174] [175] In addition, hyperresponsiveness to histamine has been convincingly demonstrated to occur after experimental nasal allergen provocation and to be inhibited by nasal corticosteroids, linking this phenomenon to allergic inflammation. 154, 172, 176, 177 Most impressively, nasal responsiveness to histamine, with symptoms as the outcome, was found to correlate moderately well with clinical indices of perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR), such as daily symptom scores and the score from the rhinitis quality of life questionnaire. 178 Histamine is by far the most commonly used stimulus in studies assessing nasal hyperresponsiveness. Histamine has multiple effects on the nasal mucosa. It induces sensory nerve activation leading to sneezing, pruritus, cholinergically mediated glandular secretions, and possibly even reflex vasodilation, which may be a cholinergic effect. In addition, histamine has a direct effect on the vasculature leading to vasodilation of the capacitance vessels and plasma exudation from the postcapillary venules of the subepithelial plexus. It is not clear whether histamine can directly activate the nasal glandular apparatus. 179 Despite the complicated effects of histamine on the nasal mucosa, the methodology of the provocation permits differentiation of various aspects of nasal hyperresponsiveness. First, histamine-induced sneezing is a quite clean outcome, reflecting sensory neural function, and can be used to assess sensorineural hyperresponsiveness. Second, evaluation of the content of histamine-induced nasal secretions in markers of plasma extravasation can be used as a measure of vascular hyperpermeability, a form of nasal hyperresponsiveness. One can also measure changes in nasal airflow after unilateral histamine challenge and separate the ipsilateral from the contralateral to the challenge nostrils. This technique may allow an assessment of the direct effects of histamine on the capacitance vessels (by subtracting the changes in the contralateral from the ipsilateral nasal passage). Alternatively, pretreatment of the challenged nostril with a local anesthetic may reveal only the direct, as opposed to the indirect (neural), effects of histamine provocation on nasal airflow. Bradykinin. Bradykinin is a product of allergic reactions. 180 Its most evident effect on the nasal mucosa is plasma extravasation. In this respect, bradykinin does not appear to differentiate patients with active allergic rhinitis from healthy controls. 181 However, in a study by Riccio and Proud, 181 healthy subjects or patients with SAR, when tested out of the pollen season, generate minimal secretory responses to bradykinin and no sneezing. In contrast, both ipsilateral and contralateral secretions to unilateral, localized bradykinin provocation, as well as sneezes, are induced in patients with PAR and in those with symptomatic seasonal disease. This indicates that, in the presence of active allergic disease, a sensorineural response to bradykinin is induced. However, there are some discrepancies between this study and a study reported by Baraniuk et al. 182 Thus, more work with bradykinin in the nose will be required to obtain a more concrete impression of its potential usefulness as a tool to examine specific forms of nasal hyperresponsiveness. Studies on the effects of antiinflammatory agents on hyperresponsiveness to bradykinin have not been performed. Neither do we know whether experimental allergen provocation can change as well as augment the qualitative characteristics of the responsiveness to bradykinin. However, it is worth mentioning that, in the lower airways of patients with asthma, responsiveness to bradykinin increases dramatically 24 to 48 hours after allergen inhalation challenge, much more so than the responsiveness to methacholine. 183 Inversely, bronchial responsiveness to bradykinin can be dramatically reduced with inhaled glucocorticosteroids. 184 Other pharmacologic and biochemical stimuli. Other products of the nasal allergic reaction could turn out to be useful in assessing nasal hyperresponsiveness. These include the sulfidopeptide leukotrienes, prostaglandin D 2 , platelet-activating factor, and so forth. There is very limited experience, however, with nasal provocations involving these agents. Also, other endogenous substances that are capable of inducing nasal symptoms but have not been clearly associated with allergic reactions should be considered, including serotonin, endothelin, and neuropeptides such as substance P or neurokinin A. Physical and environmental nonantigenic stimuli. Nasal symptoms can be produced by physical stimuli. The most common and well-characterized physical stimulus is cold, dry air and, associated with that, hyperosmolar solutions. Many individuals complain of nasal symptoms on exposure to cold, windy conditions, particularly during winter skiing, a phenomenon termed skier's nose. 185 Cold, dry air nasal challenges have been performed in the laboratory, and nasal responsiveness to this stimulus has been well characterized. [186] [187] [188] [189] [190] [191] Although many individuals without allergy have a specific sensitivity to cold, dry air, which is not associated with any other kind of nasal dysfunction, patients with active allergic rhinitis respond more vigorously to this stimulus compared with healthy subjects. 189 Furthermore, patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma have stronger nasal reactivity to nasal challenge with cold, dry air compared with patients with allergic rhinitis alone. 192 Finally, nasal allergen provocation augments the nasal reaction to cold, dry air. 193 Interestingly, cold, dry air has been shown to differentiate patients with nonallergic, noninfectious perennial rhinitis from healthy subjects with higher sensitivity than histamine. 194 Although the exact mechanism through which cold, dry air induces a nasal reaction is not known, available data support the concept that this is primarily a sensorineural reaction initiated by increased tonicity (osmolarity) of the nasal surface, which is in turn induced by excessive water loss. 195 The main outcome of the reaction, however, is glandular activation. 196 In accordance with the theories regarding the mechanism of nasal reaction to cold, dry air, various forms of nasal challenges with hyperosmolar solutions have been developed. 55, 197, 198 The outcomes from these provocations support the concept that hyperosmolarity and cold, dry air share common pathways. 195 As with cold, dry air, hyperosmolar challenges reveal stronger nasal responsiveness in patients with PAR compared with healthy controls. 55 Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that intranasal hypertonic saline enhances the exudative and secretary effects of histamine and methacholine respectively. 199 Shusterman and Balmes 200 and Shusterman et al 201 have developed a methodology to stimulate the nose with chlorine gas and with carbon dioxide. These stimuli are quite relevant to daily environmental exposures, and nasal responsiveness assessed through such methodologies has direct clinical implications. These studies have so far demonstrated that patients with SAR, even when tested outside the pollen season, develop nasal airflow limitation on exposure to chlorine gas with lower threshold, compared with healthy controls.
