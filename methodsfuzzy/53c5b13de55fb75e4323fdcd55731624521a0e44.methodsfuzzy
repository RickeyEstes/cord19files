Source and puri$ication of virus. OC 43 strain of human coronavirus was grown to high infectivity titers (~O'LD~O/.O~ ml) in SMB and harvested as a 20 % suspension in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The virus was extensively purified by temperature-dependent adsorption to and elution from fresh human "0" erythrocytes and by batch CaHP04 chromatography (Kaye et al., 1970) . The final purified virus suspen-sion was concenhrated either by ultrafiltration with XMlOOA or XM300 Diaflo membranes (Amicon CorporatiorQ, Lexington, MA), by pelleting at 20,000 rpm (26,400g) for 2 hr in a Beckman No. 40 rotor, or by hydrogel extraction (Lyphogel, Gelman Instrument Company, Ann Arbor, MI), depending upon the test's to be performed on the product. Preparation of imlnune sercG. Antiserums to crude virus (20 % suspension in PBS), normal SMB (20 70 in PBS), and purified virus were prepared in adult Swiss white mice, both as serum and ascitic fluid, in adult ,gu.inea pigs (Hartley strain), and in adult White Leghorn chickens. For the production of antiserum in mice, five weekly ip injections of 0.5 ml antigen were given, and the mice were exsanguinated 2 weeks after the last injection. For product'ion of as&c fiuid in mice, four weekly ip injections of 0.5 ml antigen were given (Days 0, 7, 14, 21) , by 0.2 ml of a 10% suspension of sarcoma M/TG ip on Day 25; 0.5 ml antigen ip on Day 28; paracentesis on Days 36, 39, and 42; and exsanguination on Day 42. The schedule for producing antiserum in guinea pigs consist'ed of five weekly SC injections of 2.6 ml of a 50-50 mixture of antigen emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant; guinea pigs were exsangtinat'ed 2 weeks after the final injection. In chickens a brief schedule was used t'o enhance the titer of precipitating antibodies. Two milliliters of antigen were given ip and 2 ml of a 50-50 mixture of antigen in Freund's complete adjuvant were given im in four sites (0.5 ml/site) on Days 0 and 7; the chickens were exsangainated en Day 13. Pseimmunizat'ion serum samples were obtained from all experimental animals, and serum w-as obtained from control animals to monitor adventitious infections. Serologic tests. Hemagglutinin (HA) titrations were performed in "the microtiter system with 0.01 l/l PBS diluent, pH 7.2, and 0.5 % adult chicken red blood cells (RBC) (IIierholzer et al., 1969) . Indirect HA (INA) tests for incomplete l~emagglutil~~~s were performed in the following manner. Seriai dilutions of test antigens were mixed ie 0.025-ml vol with 0.025 ml of 2 hemagglut,inin-inhibition ) antibody units of guinea pig anti-p virus serum and incubated for 2 hr at room temperature, T-W HA units of crude virus in 0.025 ml were added and the t'est reincubated for 4 hr at room temperature. er addition of 0.05 ml. of 0.5 % chicken R suspension and incubation for I hr at room tempera$urc, tests were observed for absence of i:nhibition ix wells containing dilutions of test materials. Complement $x&ion. (CF) tests. CF tesrs were performed by the standardized microt,iter method with overnight fixatiorl of 5 unit's of complement (Casey, 1965 )~ Protein n2easurenwnts. Protein determinations were made by the method of Lowry et al. (1951) and read in a spectropbotometer at 750 nm against a. BSA standard curve. Immunodi$usion ( )* Ouchterlony double-diffusion. tests lvere carried out OLZ 25 x 75-mm glass slides containing 4 mi 0.7 % agarose (Ma!lestad Lab ries, R polis, MS) in 0.81 N st-ith merthiolate as preservative. Wells 3 mm in diameter and 9 mm apart, cent.er-to-center, were filled three times. The plates were incuba,ted at room t'emperature for 2 days, photographed, stained with amido black (set: IE procedure), and rephotographed. I~n-nnzunoeZeci~o~horesis (123). 133 was performed on 25 X 75-mm slides containing 4 ml I % agarose in 0,025 A1 Tris-barbitalsodium barbital buffer, pH 8.8. Antiger a-& 1.5 mm in diameter were filled with 0.02-Q.03 ml sample. The samples were eleetrophoresed for 75 min at, 24" and 250 V at 5-&nA/'siide in a 0.50 M Tris-barbital-sodium barbital buffer, ppi 8.8. Arcs of preeipit'ate developed after application of appropriat'e ant'isera to l-mm troughs and incubation for li da>-at room t,emperature, Aft'er immunoelect8rophoresis the a,ger slides were sta,ined for protein and protcinbound lipid (Uriel, 1964) . The slides were washed for 2 days in 2 % NaCl, rinsed for 2 days in distilled water, and dried overnight under filt,er paper at room temperature. For protein staining, the slides were immersed in amide black 10B (0.1% stain in 10 % acetic acid and 45 % methanol) for 20 min and destained through several rinses in the acetic acid-methanol solvent. For lipids, slides were stained with oil red 0 (saturated solution in 60 % ethanol) and destained in 50 % ethanol. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed based on the method of Holowczak and Joklik (1967) . Gels, 6 X 60 mm, were composed of 7.5 % acrylamide, 0.20 % N , N'methylenebisacrylamide, 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), 0.0575 % N ,N ,N',N'tetramethylethylenediamine, and 0.07 % ammonium persulfate, in 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Samples to be electrophoresed were solubilized by incubation for 1 hr at 37" with equal volumes of the 0.01 M phosphate buffer containing 4% SLS, 2 % 2-mercaptoethanol (ME), and 1.0 M urea. Samples were then heated at 100" for 1 min. The materials were dialyzed overnight at room temperature against the phosphate buffer containing 0.1% SLS, 0.1% ME, and 0.05 M urea. Samples thus treated and containing 75-135 pg of protein were stabilized to lo-20% sucrose and applied to the gels. The gels were electrophoresed at 78-86 V and at 3.5 mA per tube at room temperature until a tracking dye, 0.05 % bromphenol blue, migrated to 1 mm from the distal end of the gel (about 60 min). The reservoir buffer in both chambers during electrophoresis was 0.01 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, with 0.1% SLS. The gels were removed from the support tubes and stained for protein, protein-bound lipid, and protein-bound carbohydrate. For protein staining, the gels were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for 4 hr, stained with 0.05 % Coomassie blue in 10 % TCA for 8-12 hr, and destained for 3-5 days in 10 % TCA (Chrambach et al., 1967) . Alternately, gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie blue in 50 % methanol/7.5% acetic acid and power-destained as described by Maize1 et al. (1970) . For lipid staining, gels were immersed in saturated oil red 0 in 60 % ethanol for 2 hr, destained with 50% ethanol for 2 hr, and rehydrated in distilled water (Crowle, 1961) . For carbohydrate staining, gels were oxidized with 1% periodic acid in 3 % acetic acid for 1 hr, rinsed in distilled water for 1 hr, stained with 0.5% reduced acidified basic fuchsin (Schiff's reagent) for 45 min, destained in distilled water, and stored in 1% sodium metabisulfite (Clarke, 1964) . All gels were scanned for accurate detection and quantitation of bands with a Gilford model 2410 linear transport coupled to a model 2000 recording spectrophotometer (Gilford Laboratories, Oberlin, OH). Gels stained with Coomassie blue were scanned at 640 nm, those with oil red 0 at the absorption maximum of 492 nm, and those with Schiff's reagent at the absorption maximum of 534 nm. Molecular weight determinations of the separated polypeptides were performed by PAGE as described by Shapiro et al. (1967) . Solubilized cyt. c, RNAse, hemoglobin, carboxypeptidase A, pepsin (all from Nutritional Biochemicals Company, Cleveland, OH), trypsin, ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin (Schwarz/Mann, Orangeburg, NY), and fetuin (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY), and nonsolubilized purified human IgG (courtesy of Dr. H. Daugharty, Center for Disease Control) were used as molecular weight standards in coelectrophoresis and companion electrophoresis runs. Fetuin was also used as a carbohydrate standard. Enzyme treatment. Purified virus was treated with bromelin (NBC, Cleveland, OH) in a reducing buffer with dithiothreitol as described by Compans et al. (1970) and was subsequently repurified on a 5-40% potassium tartrate gradient by equilibrium centrifugation at 75,000g. Electron microscopy (EM). Negative contrast electron microscopy was carried out with concentrated samples sprayed onto carbon-coated grids, stained with 2.0 % sodium phosphotungstate (PTA), and examined at 80 kV with a Philips EM-300 electron microscope. Ultracentrifugal analysis. Sedimentation coefficients and est.imates of molecular weight were determined at 15, 16, and 18,000 rpm and at 20.0" with a An-H titanium rotor and 12-mm Kel-F cells in a Beckman Model E ultracentrifuge equipped with schlieren, interference, and uv optical systems. The virus samples were dialyzed against 0.01 M sodium borate buffer, pH 8.0, with 0.16 M NaCl, and contained 1-2 mg protein per 0.4 ml. Apparent molecular weight (iWW,> was calculated from eqrations derived by Svedberg and Pedersen (1940) and as applied by Burness and Clothier (1970) .
