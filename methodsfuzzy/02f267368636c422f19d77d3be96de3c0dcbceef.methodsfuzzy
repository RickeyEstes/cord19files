A 70-mer nucleic acid hybridization probe, named the InflA probe, was constructed from the most conserved portion of the matrix gene in segment 7 of the Influenza A H3N2 virus. Properties important for the design of variation (mismatch)-tolerant yet specific probes were investigated by studying the interaction between a set of virus-derived probes and complementary targets with different degrees and distributions of mismatch. The 70-mer DNA probes were coupled to color-coded microspheres, hybridized with biotinylated target nucleic acids, incubated with streptavidin-phycoerythrin and analyzed in a Luminex Ã• 200 TM system. The hybridization reaction was performed at a standard non-saturating concentration (0.2 nM target) in 3 M TMAC buffer. In further experiments, in an attempt to make a probe with an extended mismatch tolerance, a series of dInosinecontaining probes were synthesized and analyzed for hybridization in the 3 M TMAC buffer system. A limited number of experiments comparing dInosine with an alternative universal base (5-nitroindole) or with wobbles (degenerations) were also conducted. Many viruses harbor synonymous mutations (sm), which means that the third base in a codon can wobble without changing the amino acid in the protein. Targets with regions where every third base was mutated, to resemble the common phenomenon of sm (i.e. the nt sequence is varied without affecting the coding for a specific amino-acid code), were of special interest, since this is often the cause of the variation in coding viral sequences. Rotavirus is a dsRNA virus that causes gastroenteritis. Clinical fecal samples, previously confirmed to contain rotavirus, were used to test the design strategies of this report. An asymmetric PCR, with biotinylated rev-primer in excess, was set up for the VP6 segment. The primers were designed using knowledge gained from this report, i.e. both degeneration and dInosine were used to create moderately degenerated probes with uninterrupted matching stretches as long as possible, in the most conserved regions. The biotinylated reverse (rev-) primer was made 77-nt long to be as tolerant to variation as possible, while the shorter forward (fw-) primer (23 nt) contained four locked nucleic acids (LNA) to increase the hybridization strength (represented by melting temperature, T m ) to match that of the rev-primer.
