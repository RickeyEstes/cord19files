Two upper respiratory specimens (1 nasal and 1 throat) were obtained from each patient by study personnel, using the BBL™ CultureSwab™ (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD, USA). Specimens were transported to the virology laboratory within 4 h after collection and placed in the refrigerator at 2-8°C. Specimens were extracted daily, but testing was not performed in real time; instead, specimens were batched and tested weekly to increase efficiency. Swabs were broken off in Microtest™ M5® Transport (Remel; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lenexa, KS, USA) prior to extraction using the MagNA Pure Compact instrument with the MagNA Pure Compact Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit-small volume (cat. no. 03 730 964 001) (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Both nasal and throat swabs from each participant were tested with the EraGen MultiCode-PLx Respiratory virus panel using manufacturer recommendations. The assay utilizes an open system in which, following RNA/DNA amplification, the amplicon is transferred to the Luminex instrument for specific virus detection. All throat swabs were also tested for GAS by a separate, previously validated, LightCycler-based real-time PCR assay, with a sensitivity of 93% for GAS detection (Uhl, et al., 2003) . With an estimated respiratory virus detection rate of 45% among cases, and 15% among asymptomatic controls, the sample size required for an alpha of 0.05 and 80% power would be 36 cases and a similar number of controls for the primary outcome. Two-by-two contingency tables were created, and data were analyzed using the chi-square test for difference between 2 proportions of interest. Agreement between results from nasal and throat swabs was calculated as the percentage of participants either testing positive for the same virus or testing negative on both specimens.
