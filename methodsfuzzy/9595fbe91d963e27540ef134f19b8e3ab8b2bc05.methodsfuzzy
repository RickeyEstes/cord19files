Oleuropein (Ole) and hydroxytyrosol (HT). Oleuropein (Ole) was purified from olive leaf extract, characterized, and standardized by liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (LC-MS) [3] . Hydroxytyrosol (HT) was prepared by stepwise hydrolysis of Ole with b-glucosidase (Sigma G4511) in 80 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0 using 1 U/lmole substrate at 37°C for 1 h. This treatment removes the glucose moiety from Ole and yields oleuropein aglycone (Ole-AG). Ole-AG was subsequently hydrolyzed with esterase (Sigma E0887) in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 at 1 U/lmole substrate at 25°C for 1 h to yield hydroxytyrosol and elenolic acid. The mixture was separated by HPLC and standardized by LC-MS. HT was also prepared by chemical synthesis from 3,4-dihydroxylphenylacetic ester (DHPA). Cell lines and HIV-1. Uninfected MT2 and H9 cell lines, and HIV-1 IIIB chronically infected H9 (H9/HIV-1 IIIB ) and HIV-1/IIIB virus, were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, NIAID, NIH. MT2 cells [4, 5] were obtained from Richman, and H9 and HIV-1IIIB virus stocks [6, 7] from Gallo. The cell lines were cultured in RPMI medium 1640 containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 lg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Viral stocks were prepared and standardized as described [8] . Anti-HIV and cytotoxicity assays. The effects of Ole and HT on acute HIV infection and viral replication were measured by assays on syncytial formation in cell-cell HIV-1 transmission and on HIV-1 core protein p24 expression as described [8] . Cytotoxicity was evaluated by the MTT assay [8] . Molecular modeling. Molecular modeling was performed by molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and free energy calculations [9, 10] . Docking was performed with Autodock version 3.0.5 [11] . The relaxation of docking structure obtained was then implemented under Discovery from Insight II (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) using 500 steps of Steepest Descent followed by Conjugate Gradient until the root mean square of the energy gradient reaches a value of 0.01 kcal/mol Å . HIV-1 gp41 fusion peptides C34 and N36. HIV-1 gp41 fusion peptides, N36 and C34 were synthesized by solid-phase FMOC method (GeneMed, CA) and purified by HPLC. The sequences of these peptides are (Ac-SGIVQQQNNLLRAIEAQQHLLQLTVWGIKQLQARIL-NH 2 ) and (Ac-WMEWDREINNYTSLIHSLIEESQNQQEKNEQELL-NH 2 ), respectively. Corresponding viral peptides N36 and C34 prepared from HIV-1 were obtained through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, NIAID, NIH [12] and used as standards for purification and bioassays. Fusion complex formation. Fusion complex formation was carried out by incubating equimolar amounts of HIV-1 gp41 fusion peptides N36 and C34 in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2 and 150 mM NaCl) at 10 or 20 lM each at 37°C. Peptide N36 was first incubated either alone or with various concentrations of Ole or HT for 30 min. Next, an equimolar amount of C34 was added and the samples incubated for 30 min. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (N-PAGE). N-PAGE was carried out as previously reported [13] with modifications that involve fusion peptide concentration, order of reactions, and time of incubation in fusion complex formation. Tris-glycine gels (18%, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were electrophoresed at 120 V for 2 h, stained with Coomassie blue and analyzed by densitometry. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. CD spectra were recorded on an AVIV 62-DS CD spectrometer, using 1 mm sample cells and a fixed temperature of 4°C [8] . Each spectrum is a smoothed average of 10 scans. The bandwidth for each measurement was 1 nm. CD intensities are expressed as mean residue ellipticities [h] (degrees cm 2 /dmol). Prior to calculation of the final ellipticity, all spectra were corrected by subtracting the reference spectra of PBS without peptides.
