This is an open-label Phase I study for adults 18-70 years old to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 3-injection vaccination regimen with an investigational plasmid DNA vaccine that encodes for an H1 hemagglutinin from the Influenza A/California/04/2009 H1N1 strain. The study schema is shown in Table 4 .1, including an optional booster injection with a licensed inactivated H1N1 vaccine. A target window for the inactivated H1N1 vaccine is shown in the schema, however, given that all subjects will be at or beyond Study Week 12 the earliest mutually convenient date after the licensed vaccine supply and amended protocol become available is acceptable for administration of the optional injection. The added post-boost research sample collections will then be scheduled for intervals of time that are relative to the date of the H1N1 booster injection. Subjects who have received the H1N1 vaccine outside of the study may consent to contribute additional research samples post-boost as well. The hypothesis is that the DNA vaccine will be safe for human administration and elicit an antibody response. The study will be conducted by the VRC Clinic, NIAID in the NIH Clinical Center or its approved satellite facilities [e.g., Mobile Clinical Trials Unit (MCTU) or VRC Clinic at Cedar Lane]. Vaccinations will only occur at the NIH Clinical Center. Safety of the vaccine will be evaluated at scheduled study visits and by study subject report. The estimated duration for each subject to complete immunizations and follow-up is 32 weeks. To maintain a balanced age distribution of subjects, no more than 10 subjects in the 51 to 70 year old age range will be enrolled. Subjects across the full 18-70 year old age range will be enrolled simultaneously. No more than 5 subjects may be enrolled in the first week of the study. Following the 5th enrollment, the remainder of subjects may be enrolled without restrictions on enrollment rate.
