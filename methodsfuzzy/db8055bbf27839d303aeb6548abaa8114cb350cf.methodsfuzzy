The use of RNA virus replication machinery to express heterologous sequences depends on the ability to engineer recombinant RNA molecules. Although recombinant RNA techniques have been used in studies of the RNA bacteriophage Q[3, the methodology for amplification, in vitro cleavage, and ligation of RNA molecules to produce replication-competent viral RNAs remains cumbersome when compared to recombinant DNA technology. Therefore, most studies have relied upon cDNA intermediates that can be used to produce biologically active RNA molecules after either in vivo or in vitro transcription. As first shown for bromegrass mosaic virus [2] , in vitro transcription of cDNA templates by Escherichia coli, SP6, T7, or T3 DNA-dependent RNA polymerases can generate RNAs with precise 5' and 3' termini and specific infectivities that approach those of authentic virion RNAs. RNAs produced in vitro can be introduced into cells by microinjection, electroporation, or encapsulation in liposomes. A variety of compounds, such as diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) dextran or cationic lipid micelles, can enhance transfection efficiency. The transfection efficiencies of the different methods vary greatly among cell types, thus limiting the utility of RNA-based expression systems. In some cases, this has been circumvented by devising systems that allow amplification and packaging of recombinant RNAs into infectious virus particles or by expressing replication-competent RNA virus transcripts in vivo using recombinant DNA viruses, such as vaccinia (JA Lemm and CM Rice, unpublished data). Alternatively, bacteriophage transcription systems have also been used in vivo to produce replication-competent RNA transcripts [3,4" ] which allow the use of DNA transfection methodologies. RNA viruses can be viewed simplistically as consisting of cis-acting RNA elements that are necessary for replication, transcription, and packaging, together with genes encoding the viral proteins necessary for these processes. In this review several kinds of recombinant RNA molecules are described. 'Self-replicating RNAs' or 'replicons' will be used to describe RNAs that encode the viral proteins necessary for replication and that also contain the cis signals required for replication. RNAs containing the cis signals for replication (and in some cases for transcription and packaging) but requiring viral replicase functions to be supplied in trans will be referred to as 'defective RNAs'. A common property shared by all positive-strand viruses, which has been the key to their development as gene expression vectors, is the ability of naked virion RNA to initiate a productive infection after transfection of an appropriate host cell. The viral genome functions directly as an mRNA for production of all viral proteins necessary for synthesis of a genomelength complementary negative-strand RNA. Once synthesized, this negative-strand template is copied to produce additional genome-length positive strands and, for some viruses, and one or more subgenomic mR-NAs. RNA replication and transcription mechanisms are diverse for different positive-strand virus families. For the purpose of discussing the development of these viruses as vectors, two groups can be distinguished based on whether or not subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized. In the group employing the simplest strategy, which includes the picornavirus and flavivirus families, only genome-length positive strands are synthesized. Picornaviruses have been widely used for constructing chimeric viruses expressing short heterologous epitopes [5] and have found more limited use in the production of larger proteins [1, 6] . In the other group, which includes the togavirus and coronavirus families, negative strands also function as templates for high level transcription of one or more 3' co-terminal subgenomic mRNAs. As reviewed below, it is this expression strategy that has facilitated the use of alphaviruses for heterologous gene expression. Apart from the infectivity of their virion RNAs, other common features of positive-strand RNA viruses make them attractive candidates for the development of RNAbased expression systems. For example, possible unpredictable and deleterious effects of nuclear splicing on expression of heterologous RNAs are eliminated as RNA amplification and transcription occurs in the cytoplasm. In addition, with the exception of the coronaviruses, the genomes of these viruses are small, varying in size between 7.5-14kb, which facilitates construction and manipulation of cDNA clones, but may also impose size limitations on engineered RNAs when viral packaging systems are utilized.
