One of the basic techniques that are used in genetic screening is the gain-of-function method, the other being the loss-of-function approach. In the gain-of-function approach, the function of a specific gene can be probed with the help of the ectopic cDNA  The RNAi methodology has been used for the development of the loss-of-function screening. The different RNAi tools such as the short hairpin RNAs, small interfering RNA, and the long double-stranded RNA are some of the commercially available tools used for this purpose.
