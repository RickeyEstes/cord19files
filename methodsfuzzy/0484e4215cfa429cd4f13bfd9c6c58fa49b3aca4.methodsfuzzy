The risk of a portfolio may be measured by the variance of returns to the portfolio. Johnson (1960) shows that the optimal hedge ratio for a portfolio may be derived from minimizing the variance of the portfolio returns. Let S t represent the natural log of jet fuel spot price at time t and F t represent the natural log of another petroleum commodity futures price. Assuming that the variance-covariance matrix of the portfolio returns is constant over time, we write the returns as (1) where h is the static ratio of the number of futures contracts needed to hedge jet fuel; DS t represents the change in spot price S t or the first log difference, S tþ1 À S t at time t; DF t represents the first log difference of the futures prices, F tþ1 À F t . The variance of R t is  (2) The minimum variance of R t is obtained by taking the first derivative of equation (2) with respect to the hedge ratio and setting the derivative equal to 0: The terms in equation (3) can be rearranged such that The parameter h * in equation (4) is the minimum-variance hedge ratio (MVHR). It is the most widely used hedge ratio and is considered optimal for producing the lowest variability in portfolio returns (Chen et al., 2003) . Since the correlation coefficient of DS t and DF t is where SDðDS t Þ and SDðDF t Þ are the standard deviations of DS t and DF t respectively, the optimal hedge ratio in equation (4) is equivalent to This study considers the h * estimated from different econometric models to determine the optimal hedge ratio.
