Chemical analysis of quercetin was performed by High-Performance Liquid Chromatograp hy (HPLC) using a Shimadzu Prominence UFLC system equipped with an SPD-20 A UV-Vis detector, LC-20AT solvent delivery unit, SIL-20A HT autosampler (Shimadzu Corporation , Japan) and NovaPak C18 column (5 lm, 150 Â 3.9 mm, Waters, Ireland). The HPLC settings were as follow: detection wavelength 370 nm, flow rate 0.4 mL min À1 , injection volume 100 lL, and retention time of 4.5 min. The mobile phase was a mixture of acetate buffer and acetonitrile (55: 45, v/v) and 1 mM EDTA. Standard linearity was obtained between 0.2 and 20 lg mL À1 .
