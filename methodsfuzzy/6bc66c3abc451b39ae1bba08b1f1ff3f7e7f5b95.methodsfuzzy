MARC 145 cells 32 were used to prepare PRRSV stocks and assays. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For virus infection, DMEM with 2% horse serum was used. North American prototype PRRSV strain VR2332 2 was used in vaccine preparation (provided by Dr Eric Nelson, South Dakota State University, USA), and PRRSV MN184 2 was provided by Dr Michael Murtaugh (University of Minnesota, USA). M. tb WCL was prepared as previously described. 33 Preparation of vaccine antigens and Plga nanoparticle-based vaccine formulations PRRSV strain VR2332 2 was grown and UV-killed/ inactivated (KAg) as described previously. 13, 30 PLGA NPs entrapping KAg (NP-KAg) or M. tb WCL (NP-M. tb WCL) were prepared using a double-emulsion method (w/o/w) as previously described, 34 with a few modifications. 26
