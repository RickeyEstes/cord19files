2.1. Materials. Dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), and diacylphosphatidylethanolamine-N-lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl (RH-PE) were obtained from Avanti Polar-Lipid (Alabama). N-(α-Trimethylammonioacetyl)-didodecyl-D-glutamate chloride (TMAG) was purchased from Sogo Pharmaceutical (Tokyo, Japan). Asialofetuin (AF) and 2-mercaptoethanol were obtained from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO). Nhydroxysulfosuccinimide (Sulfo-NHS) was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) was from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan). 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES) and 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl] ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) were purchased from Nacalai Tesque hydroxylamine HCl, AF-liposomes were obtained. To remove the free AF, we performed gel filtration using Sepharose CL-4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) and determined phospholipids and AF by the Bartlett method [24] and the Bradford method [25] , respectively. The fractions number 26-30, which eluted both phospholipids and AF, were collected as the AF-liposomes fraction (Figure 1(b) ). The ζ-potential value and particle size of AF-liposomes were 31.2 ± 0.1 mV and 230.7 ± 4.2 nm, respectively. The amount of AF modification in 1 μmol of AF-liposome lipids was 35.8 μg/μmol lipids, indicating that AF modification rate against DPPE in liposomes was 0.75%. Liposomes without AF modification (N-liposomes) was prepared by the solution without Sulfo-NHS-AF, and the other procedure was the same as that of AF-liposomes.
