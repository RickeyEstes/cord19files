Considering the complexity of exposure path ways associated with environmental ARB risks and the large uncertainty in the input data for some nodes along the various exposure path ways, outputs would inevitably be difficult for decision makers to interpret and could in fact be counter productive. Thus, there is merit in considering decision analysis approaches to prioritize risks, guide resource allocation and data collection activities, and facilitate decision making. Although there is a range of ranking options, uses of weightings, and selection criteria (Cooper et al. 2008; Pires and Hald 2010) , as well as failure mode and effects analysis (Pillay and Wang 2003) , in the overall area of microbial risk assessment, there is a consolidation to MCDA approaches that may include Bayesian algorithms (Lienert et al. 2011; Ludwig et al. 2013; Ruzante et al. 2010) . Approaches such as MCDA are designed to provide a structured framework for mak ing choices where multiple factors need to be considered in the decisionmaking pro cess. MCDA is a wellestablished tool that can be used for evaluating and document ing the importance assigned to different fac tors in ranking risks (Lienert et al. 2011) , albeit heavily dependent on expert opinion. In the context of MRA, MCDA has been used to rank foodborne microbial risks based on multiple factors, including public health, market impacts, consumer perception and acceptance, and social sensitivity (Ruzante et al. 2010) , as well as to prioritize and select inter ventions to reduce pathogen exposures (Fazil et al. 2008) . Examples of MCDA applications in structuring decisions for man aging eco toxico logi cal risks have also been reported (Linkov et al. 2006; Semenzin et al. 2008 ) and provide useful MCDA approaches. MCDA could be used, for example, to evalu ate and rank the relative risks between habi tats highly polluted with anti biotics, ARG, and ARG determinants, as described above for possible hot spots for HGT and develop ment of ARB. MCDA could be applied to evaluate the relative contribution of coselect ing agents (e.g., detergents, biocides, met als, nano materials) from various sources to the overall risk of ARB in the environment. Moreover, for a range of anti biotics consid ered to be of environmental concern, MCDA approaches could be used for risk ranking according to criteria based on relevant con tributing factors (e.g., mobility of resistance determinants in genetic elements, antibiotic resistance transfer rates in different environ mental compartments, accumulation levels of anti biotics in environmental compartments, environmental fate and transport to expo sure points). In the MCDA process, it is also important to identify low probability but high impact "onetimeevent" types of risk. Because MCDA techniques rely on expert opinion (which is often regarded as a limi tation of such approaches), wellstructured and recognized elicitation practices should be used in order to avoid introduction of biases and errors by subjective scoring. In contrast, one of the main advantages of MCDA tech niques is that they capture a consensus opin ion among an expert group about the most relevant criteria and their relative weight on the decision.
