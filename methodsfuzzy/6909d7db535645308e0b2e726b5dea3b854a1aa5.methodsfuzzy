Sample collection. Samples included DC, sheep, and goat sera; whole blood and nasal and rectal swabs freshly collected in 2013; and archived serum samples from 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 2004, 2009, and 2010 . Two rectal and two nasal swabs were obtained from each animal. One rectal swab and one nasal swab were placed into RNAlater (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and one rectal swab and one nasal swab were placed into viral transport medium (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). All were stored at Ϫ80ºC. After 24 h in fixative, plates were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and placed in PBS for storage at 4°C. Plates were loaded with infected and noninfected cells in alternating rows to generate a differential reading for each serum tested. Positivity was defined as an infected-cell optical density of Ͼ0.6 and Ͼ3ϫ the noninfected-cell optical density. Test sera were diluted 1:3,000 in PBS-0.05% Tween 20 -1% bovine serum albumin; secondary antibodies were rabbit anti-goat IgG (HϩL)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:3,000; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), rabbit anti-sheep IgG (HϩL)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:3,000; Bio-Rad), and anti-llama IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:10,000; Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX). Western blot. Extracts of noninfected Vero cells or Vero cells infected with MERS-CoV strain EMC were generated at Rocky Mountain Laboratories, loaded onto discontinuous 3 and 7.5% SDS gels (Bio-Rad), and transferred onto nitrocellulose with iBlot Transfer Stacks (Invitrogen iBlot; Life Technologies). Lanes were loaded with alternating infected and noninfected extract samples, and a pair were cut for incubation with DC sera (1:800 in blocking solution) after blocking of the membrane in PBS-0.05% Tween 20 -5% dry milk blocking solution for 1 h. Membranes were washed three times with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 after a 2-h incubation with serum and then incubated for another 1.5 h with secondary antibody (1:7,000 in blocking solution; anti-llama IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate; Bethyl Laboratories). Following three more washes, the membranes were developed with WesternSure premium chemiluminescent substrate (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) and read on a C-DiGit Blot Scanner (LI-COR). LIPS assay. The nucleocapsid proteins of Bo-CoV and MERS-CoV were PCR amplified with primers introducing appropriate restriction sites for cloning into vector pREN-2 fused to the C terminus of the Renilla luciferase reporter (20) . Sequence-confirmed construct DNA was purified from Escherichia coli cultures (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and transfected into COS-1 cells (African green monkey kidney, ATCC CRL-1650; 1 g; Lipofectamine; Invitrogen, Life Technologies). Cells were harvested at 48 h posttransfection in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1% Triton X-100, 50% glycerol, protease inhibitors), and the protein extract was clarified by two rounds of centrifugation at 12,000 ϫ g. The target concentration was determined in relative light units (RLU), and approximately 10 ϫ 10 6 RLU were incubated with test serum (1:100) in a final volume of 100 l buffer A (50 mM Tris [pH 7.7], 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1% Triton X-100) per well in 96-well plates (catalog no. 249944; Thermo/Nunc, Waltham, MA). After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, protein A/G beads (catalog no. 53135; Pierce, Junction City, OR) were added and the mixtures were transferred to 96-well filter plates (catalog no. MSBVN1B50; Millipore, Billerica, MA) for another hour of incubation at room temperature with shaking. Bead-bound anti-gen was washed eight times with buffer A and three times with PBS (Tecan Hydroflex, Maennedorf, Switzerland) and then read with coelenterazine substrate (Renilla luciferase assay system; Promega, Madison, WI) on a Centro LB960 luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Nucleic acid extraction and PCR. Total nucleic acids were extracted from nasal swabs, serum, and whole blood on a QiaCube with Cador Reagent kits (Qiagen) or RNeasy Reagent kits for extraction of RNA from rectal swabs. Real-time qPCR used a OneStep Real-Time qPCR buffer (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) and primer/probes upE and ORF1a (16, 17) . Products for sequencing were generated by RT-PCR. cDNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript III and random hexamer primers. PCR was performed with Amplitaq Gold (Life Technologies) and primers designed to amplify a 1,044-nt region of the spike gene (heminested PCR), a 913-nt region of the N gene (nested PCR) or a 2,004-nt region of the ORF1ab region (heminested PCR). For the sequences of the primers used, see Table S2 in the supplemental material. Products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and with QIAquick Gel Extraction kits (Qiagen) and subsequently sequenced on both strands by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (GeneWiz, South Plainfield, NJ).
