All the chemicals used in the present studies were of synthetic grade and were obtained from Merck specialties Ltd. and HiMedia laboratories Pvt. Ltd, (Mumbai, India). The prepared products were analysed by FT/IR (JASCO FT/IR 4100 Spectrophotometer) using KBr pellets. An LC-MS column C 6 (150 mm Ã‚ 4.6 mm) with a 5 mm particle size (Shimadzu-Mass spectrophotometer) was used. The 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 1 H NMR 400 MHz using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard, and the chemical shifts were reported in d ppm. The UV (Jasco V-630 Spectrophotometer) and elemental analyses for C, H, N and S were performed on a Perkin Elmer model 2400 CHNS/O analyser. A Shimadzu XRD 7000 was used for the study of the structural environment of the synthesized ligands and their metal complexes. The Faraday balance technique was employed for the measurement of magnetic susceptibility of the metal complexes. The in vitro antimicrobial activities against different bacterial and fungal pathogens were determined by the agar well diffusion method, sourced from IMTECH, India, Chandigarh.
