We compare the performance of our method with three competing state-of-the-art approaches. The first benchmark method, which is based on an assumption of independent Poisson observations, is straightforward to understand and to implement and has been used to infer basic fundamental parameters during the early appearance of novel pathogens [23] . For the second and third approaches, we consider Particle Filter and Ensemble Kalman Filter [27] as these methods won the 2014 "Predict the Influenza Season Challenge" sponsored by the U. S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention [41] and also demonstrate competitive performance against four other methods in a recent comparison study [27] . Benchmark method A: Likelihood approximation with the assumption of independent Poisson observations (I.Poi). We use the method from Riley and colleagues [23] as the first benchmark. This method assumes that the observations y i are independent and factorizes the likelihood function L(Y i ; θ) (Eq (1)) to where P ðI:PoiÞ ðÁjyÞ $ Poissonðm i Þ. To calculate the mean μ i , we obtain 1000 stochastic trajectories using parameter values θ and shift them so that the first observation for each trajectory lies within the first observation period [t 0 , t 1 ]. We then calculate the mean of observations over period [t i−1 , t i ] (i.e. μ i ) using these simulated trajectories. This approach ignores the interdependencies between observations y 1 , y 2 , . . ., y i and approximates Pð y i jy 1 ; . . . ; y iÀ 1 ; yÞ by P ðI:PoiÞ ð y i ; yÞ. Without the knowledge of an updated belief state P(Á|ν i ; θ), Eq (9) for prediction reduces to The mean and variance of random variable Z can be estimated using simulated trajectories with parameter values selected according to the probability function π i (θ|Y i ). These simulated trajectories can also be used to make inference about the epidemic state at time t i . To make predictions at time t i , our implementation of the benchmark approach uses only simulated trajectories that have not been extinguished before t i . Benchmark method B: Particle Filter. The Particle Filter (PF) approach described by [27] also seeks to approximate the likelihood function (1) to calculate an a-posteriori distribution π i (θ|Y i ) using the epidemic history Y i . This method, however, uses a different approximation to calculate the probability Pð y i jY iÀ 1 ; yÞ: While the belief state is also a point distribution, the state update is performed based on the solution of ODE system (5):n i ¼ xðt i À t iÀ 1 ;n iÀ 1 ; yÞ: In Eq (12), the forward propagation p (PF) (ν i |ν i−1 ; θ) is a point distribution with mass 1 atn i , and P (PF) (y i |ν i , ν i−1 ; θ) is assumed to follow a normal distribution N ðhðn i Þ; s 2 obs;i Þ where the function h maps state to observations and the observational variance s 2 obs;i is assumed to be: This observational variance is identical to the one used in [27] . Our sensitivity analysis reveals that the choice of observational variance, Eq (13), does not have a significant effect on the comparative performance of PF compared to the methods studied here (see Discussion). Since this approach calculates belief states and posterior distribution for θ, the prediction is performed in an identical fashion as for the MSS approach as described in Eq (9) . The pseudo code and the full implementation of this approach for an epidemic model is described in the SI (S1 Text subsection 6 "Pseudo code for the PF" and S1 Text subsection 10 "Detailed pseudo code for PF"). Benchmark method C: Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). We selected the ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) [27] for the third benchmark method. EnKF does not use a likelihood function L(Y i ; θ) and instead it propagates an initial ensemble that contains both epidemic states and epidemic parameters. Each new observation is then used to update this ensemble. After such updating, the ensemble is considered as a sample from the posterior distribution for both the parameters and the states. Similar to PF and MSS, this approach calculates belief states and posterior distribution for θ, and hence predictions can be performed using Eq (9) . The pseudo code and the full implementation of this approach for an epidemic model is described in the SI (S1 Text subsection 7 "Pseudo code for the EnKF" and S1 Text subsection 11 "Detailed pseudo code for the EnKF").
