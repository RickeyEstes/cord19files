The present study was designed to adapt an indirect ELISA protocol for the detection of antiporcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) IgA in serum and fecal samples to compare the capability of detection of IgA in the two different matrix types. The spike gene S1 domain (aa 1-781) of a genogroup 2 prototype U.S. PEDV expressed in a mammalian vector was used as antigen [1] . For the optimization of the assay, a total of 69 paired serum and fecal samples from pigs with known PEDV exposure [2, 3] were used. Source of the pigs and inoculation were similar to what has been described under ''control samples''. Specifically, samples collected at 28 dpi from 31 PEDV infected pigs and 38 sham-inoculated negative control pigs were utilized [2, 3] . Samples were tested in single wells in at least two independent runs and the mean S/P value was used for each sample. The cut off value for the IgA ELISA was calculated by the mean S/P ratios of PEDV negative samples plus three standard deviations (SD). The cut off points were determined to be a sample S/P ratio of 0.13 (average S/P AE SD, 0.02 AE 0.03) for the fecal ELISA and sample S/P ratio of 0.14 (average S/P AE SD, 0.00 AE 0.01) for the serum ELISA. These values were further evaluated using a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis (Fig. 1) . The analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism v. 6.01 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). A correlation between S/P values in serum and the corresponding fecal sample from a given pig was determined using Spearman's rank correlation method. A significant positive correlation was found between fecal and serum anti-IgA levels (r = 0.7889; p < 0.001, Fig. 2 ). fecal samples distributed according to PEDV challenge status of the animal (no, yes) relative to the assay cut off (full line). An S/P ratio higher or equal to 0.14 was considered positive for serum samples and an S/P ratio higher or equal to 0.13 was considered positive for fecal samples. Background PEDV, a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in pigs of any age with often high mortality in neonatal piglets. PEDV strains can be divided into genogroup 1 and genogroup 2 based on significant amino acid differences in the N-terminal domain of the S gene [4] . PEDV infection has resulted in high economic losses in Asian pig industries, the disease has been reported in 2013 in North America and in 2014 in South America [5] and recent outbreaks have been described in Europe during 2015. Most PEDV strains circulating in Europe and in Asia prior to 2010 belong to genogroup 1 while the more recent outbreaks were associated with PEDV genogroup 2. PEDV genogroup 2 can be divided in at least two major clusters, one containing the strains similar to the ones that emerged in the US in 2013 (U.S. PEDV prototype strain) and the other cluster containing PEDV strains with distinct insertions and deletions in the spike gene (S INDEL strains) [6] . Although the antigen used for the ELISA development in the present study was based on the U.S. PEDV prototype strain, the same protocol can be applied for S1 antigens based on different strain sequences that may be more relevant in a certain geographic location.
