This was a prospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary-care university hospital in Brazil. The study was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Board (#17470/2014) and written informed consent was obtained from the patients' parents. All consecutive children younger than five years attending the pediatric emergency room with ALRI who were admitted to hospital from January 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2016 were eligible for the study. ALRI was defined by the presence of cough, tachypnea, respiratory distress with prolonged expiratory time, and wheezing or crackles on auscultation. Subjects were excluded if they had used systemic steroids for over 24 h within 4 weeks of presentation or had multiple comorbidities (more than two). Demographic, clinical and outcome data were collected from patients' health records. Disease severity was defined as need for mechanical ventilation. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were obtained within 24 h of admission (Day 1) and on the fifth day (Day 5) of hospital stay. In case of hospital discharge before Day 5, the sample was collected just prior to it. NPA technique consisted of washing the nasal cavity with 3 mL of saline followed by sample collection into a mucus extractor. During the first year of the study, blood samples were also concomitantly drawn. The samples were processed, aliquoted and stored at −70°C until analysis. NPA were tested using real-time PCR for the presence of RSV A and B, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus A and B, influenza virus A and B, and adenovirus, including quantification of viral load. Total RNA and DNA were extracted from 250 μL nasopharyngeal washes using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies), following the manufacturer's protocols. Reverse transcription was done with High Capacity Reverse cDNA transcription kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using 1 ng of extracted RNA and random hexamers, following manufacturer's instructions. Newly synthesized cDNA was subjected to TaqMan real-time PCR (qPCR) with specific primers and probes (Supplementary material 1) in a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). The RNAse P gene was used as internal control for all samples. All real-time PCR assays were tested in duplicate. Reverse transcription, assembly of real-time PCR mixes, and cycling parameters were per a previously published protocol [22] . IL-33, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and the soluble receptor (sST2) were measured using a commercial enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; R&D systems) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Detection limits for the assays were 0.186 pcg/ml (IL-33), 2.44 pcg/ml (sST2), 3.8 pcg/ml (IL-1β), 15.5 pcg/ml (TNF-α), 0.2 pcg/ml (IL-4), 3 pcg/ml (IL-6) and 31.1 pcg/ ml (IL-8).
