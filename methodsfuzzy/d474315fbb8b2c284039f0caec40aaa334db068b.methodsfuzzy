Cell lines and cell culture. HEK293T (ATCC, CRL-11268), HEK293 (ATCC, CRL-1573), A549 (ATCC, CCL-185), and HeLa cells (ATCC, CCL-2) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; GIBCO) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; GIBCO) at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Human bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells were cultured in DMEM-nutrient mixture F-12 Hams (1:1) supplemented with 1% MEM nonessential amino acids solution (GIBCO), 1% GlutaMAX (GIBCO), and 10% FBS (GIBCO) at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Calu-3 cells were seeded at a density of 5 ϫ 10 5 cells/cm 2 on semipermeable membrane inserts (0.6 cm 2 ; Millicell-PCF; Millipore). After 3 to 4 weeks of culture for differentiation, cells with transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values over 600 V/cm 2 were used for HBoV infection. Transfection. Plasmids (2 g) were transfected into cells plated on 60-mm dishes with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Virus production and purification. The infectious clone pHBoV1-WH (10 g) was transfected into HEK293T cells seeded on 100-mm plates with Lipofectamine 2000. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, the cells were collected and lysed by three rounds of freezing and thawing. The cell lysate was then spun at 10,000 rpm for 30 min after Benzonase (Sigma) treatment for 30 min at 37°C. The supernatant was collected and further purified through discontinuous step gradients of iodixanol, prepared using a 60% (wt/vol) sterile solution of OptiPrep (Axis-Shield) as described previously (44) . Viral DNA was extracted using a QIAamp blood minikit (Qiagen) and quantified using quantitative PCR as described previously (21) . Virus infection. Differentiated Calu-3 cells in Millicell inserts were incubated with HBoV1 virus purified from transfected HEK293T cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 g/cell at 37°C for 2 h, followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were then cultured for HBoV RNA analysis. Plasmid construction. (i) HBoV1 infectious clone construction. The HBoV genome was prepared from the feces of a 2-year-old infant using a viral DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nearly full-length genome (lacking the left-end hairpin [LEH] and right-end hairpin [REH] sequences) was amplified using primers (XhoI-F, 5=-GCGCTCGAGCCGGCAGACA TATTGGATTC-3=; XbaI-R, 5=-GCGTCTAGATGTACAACAACAACACATTAAAAGATATAGAG-3=). LEH and REH were synthesized according to the reference sequence JQ923422. The full-length recombinant HBoV clone was ligated into the pBBSmal vector and designated pHBoV1-WH (21, 45) . (ii) Construction of pHBoV1-WH mutants. All of the nonstructural and structural protein knockout plasmids were constructed based on the recombinant HBoV clone pHBoV1-WH by single-nucleotide mutation that resulted in early translation termination of the open reading frame. NS1, NP1, VP1, and VP2 open reading frames were disrupted by mutating nt 542 from T to A, nt 2588 from G to A, nt 3205 from T to A, and nt 3540 from T to G, respectively (Fig. 3A) . (iii) Inverted terminal repeat (ITR) mutants. LEH truncation plasmids pHBoV1LEH-39, pHBoV1LEH-70, pHBoV1LEH-96, and pHBoV1LEH-140 were constructed by deleting the first 39, 70, 96, and 140 nt, respectively, of HBoV in pHBoV1-WH. Similarly, the right-end mutant plasmids pHBoV1REH-98 and pHBoV1REH-161 were constructed by truncating the last 98 and 161 nt of HBoV in pHBoV1LEH-140, which does not contain the LEH. (iv) Reporter constructs to test cis elements required for polyadenylation at (pA)d2. The parent polyadenylation reporter plasmid pEGFP-C1(-SV40 PA) was generated by deleting the SV40 polyadenylation signal of pEGFP-C1. The (pA)d2 reporter plasmids pEGFP-(pA)d and pEGFP-(pA)d2 were constructed by inserting the HBoV sequences of nt 5121 to 5271 and nt 5121 to 5543, respectively, into pEGFP-C1(-SV40 PA). pEGFP-HS was constructed by replacing nt 5121 to 5355 with the heterologous sequences from the open reading frame of kanamycin spanning from nt 57 to nt 291 based on plasmid pEGFP-(pA)d2. pEGFP-sPA was generated by changing nt 5153 to 5201 with a synthesized polyadenylation signal (5=-AATAAAAGATCTTTATTTTCATTAGATCTGTGTGTTGGTTTTTTGTGTG-3=) based on plasmid pEGFP-(pA)d2. pEGFP-mPAS was constructed by replacing (pA)d hexanucleotide AAUAAA with CCTAGG based on pEGFP-(pA)d2. (v) Constructs to identify the DSE of polyadenylation at (pA)d site. pHBoV1-WH(NheI-SmaI) was constructed by mutating nt 4918 to 4921 from CTCA to TAGC and nt 5350 to 5355 from ATGCAA to CCCGGG, resulting in NheI and SmaI restriction enzyme sites in pHBoV1-WH. pHBoV1mDSE1, pHBoV1mDSE2, pHBoV1mDSE3, and pHBoV1mDSE4 were constructed by mutating nt 5159 to 5196, nt 5177 to 5196, nt 5159 to 5177, and nt 5159 to 5201 to 5=-CACTGACTGTCAGTCTGAGTCAGAGTCACTGA CTCAGC-3=, 5=-TCAGAGTCACTGACTCAGC-3=, 5=-CACTGACTGTCAGTCTGAG-3=, and synthetic polyadenylation signal (5=-AGATCTTTATTTTCATTAGATCTGTGTGTTGGTTTTTTGTGTG-3=), respectively, in pHBoV1-WH(NheI-SmaI) (46, 47) . (vi) Constructs to analyze effect of the distance between (pA)d and (pA)d2 on polyadenylation at (pA)d2 site. pHBoV1Del1 and pHBoV1Del2 plasmids were made by deleting nt 5223 to nt 5356 and nt 5197 to nt 5356 on pHBoV1-WH(NheI-SmaI) to shorten the distance between (pA)d and (pA)d2. pHBoV1mut1 was mutated from nt 5223 to nt 5356 with a kanamycin open reading frame from nt 4 to nt 117. pHBoV1HS1 and pHBoV1HS2 were constructed by replacing the sequences from nt 5223 to nt 5356 with a kanamycin open reading frame from nt 4 to nt 217 and nt 4 to nt 617, respectively. (vii) Construction of NS1, NP1, and VP2 expression plasmids. NS1 expression plasmid pcDNA-NS1 was constructed by inserting the NS1 ORF into pcDNA3.1 vector with a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. NP1 ORF, VP2 ORF, and downstream sequences were inserted into pXJ40-FLAG to generate NP1 (pXJ40-NP1) and VP2 expression plasmids [pXJ40-VP2(pA)d and pXJ40-VP2(pA)d2]. The plasmid pXJ40-VP2(pA)d contains only the (pA)d sequence. The plasmid pXJ40-VP2(pA)d2 contains both (pA)d and (pA)d2 sequences (Fig. 9A) . Southern blot analysis. Isolation of low-molecular-weight (Hirt) DNA and Southern analysis were performed as previously described (29, 48) with digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled DNA probes (Roche). RNA isolation. Total RNA from transfected cells was harvested using TRIzol reagent (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3= RACE. Reverse transcription was performed with total RNA from transfected or infected cells with oligo(dT) primers (5=-GCTATCATCACAATGGACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTV-3=). PCR amplification was performed using an adaptor primer (5=-GCTATCATCACAATGGAC-3=) and a gene-specific primer (GSP1, 5=-CCAACTAACCTAGAATACAAACTTC-3=). The second round of PCR was performed with the adaptor primer and another gene-specific primer (GSP2, 5=-CAGATTTCCTATCACCAGAG-3=), and the PCR products were gel purified with the gel extraction kit (Omega) according to the manufacturer's protocol and then sequenced. RNase H cleavage and Northern blotting. Total RNA (20 g) was combined with 100 pmol oligo(dT) (5=-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3=) and a gene-specific primer (5=-CATCCATATGTCCCCCACTA-3=). The mixture was incubated at 65°C for 5 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. RNase H buffer and enzyme (5 U) were added and samples were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. RNase H-treated samples were ethanol precipitated for at least 30 min at Ϫ20°C and then centrifuged. The RNA pellet was dissolved and run on 1.5% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde for 12 h at 28 V. RNA was transferred to Hybond-N ϩ membrane by semidry transferring and then cross-linked using UV. Probe detection was performed by using the DIG luminescence detection kit II (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Signals were detected with the ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad). Western blotting. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection and were separated by SDS-12% PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose. Protein detection was carried out using standard protocols with anti-HA antibody (66006; Proteintech), anti-GFP (66002; Proteintech), anti-FLAG (F1804; Sigma), and anti-actin (sc-47778; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Luminescent signals were detected with the ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad). Statistical analysis. 3= RACE was repeated at least three times. The ratio of polyadenylation at (pA)d2 to (pA)d was quantified. The averages and standard deviations are presented.
