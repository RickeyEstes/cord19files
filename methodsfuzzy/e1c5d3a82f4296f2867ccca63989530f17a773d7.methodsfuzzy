The method was fully validated in accordance with the US-FDA document and other related guidelines with respect to specificity, linearity, precision and accuracy, recovery, matrix effect and stability. Selectivity was assessed by comparing the chromatograms of a blank plasma sample, a blank plasma sample spiked with the working solutions and a rat plasma sample obtained from 15 min after an oral administration of the mix standard solution of seven analytes. Linearity and sensitivity: The linearity of assay for the test in vivo compounds with a total of six calibration standards were prepared in blank rat plasma at least six concentrations, respectively, obtained by plotting the peak area (y) of each analyte versus the theoretical standard concentrations (x) and assessed by weighed least-squares linear regression using concentrations (x) as the weighting factor in SPSS-based software. Accuracy and precision: The accuracy and precision of intra-day and inter-day determination were carried out in six replicates samples at three QC levels (low, medium and high) within the same day and on three consecutive days. Matrix effect and recovery: The matrix effect of the biological matrix (rat plasma) and extraction recoveries were evaluated at three QC levels for analytes with six replicates, matrix effect was assessed via comparison of the peak responses of the analytes in the extracted blank rat plasma matrix to those obtained from neat standard solutions at equivalent concentrations. While extraction recoveries were calculated by comparing the peak areas of samples added before extraction with those of samples added after extraction. Stability The short-term and long-term stability of seven analytes in rat plasma in auto-sampler vials for 24 h, at −20 • C for 30 days and after three freeze-thaw cycles was assessed, and also carried out in six replicates samples at three QC levels (low, medium and high). The method was fully validated in accordance with the US-FDA document and other related guidelines with respect to specificity, linearity, precision and accuracy, recovery, matrix effect and stability. Selectivity: Six blank samples of rat plasma from different sources were analyzed. Representative sMRM chromatograms of Astragaloside (Figure 4B ), and plasma sample from a normal rat 15 min after oral administration of mix-std ( Figure 4C ). The background noise was very low, and the absence of endogenous interference at or close to the retention time of the analytes clearly proves the high selectivity of the method.  The method was fully validated in accordance with the US-FDA document and other related guidelines with respect to specificity, linearity, precision and accuracy, recovery, matrix effect and stability. Selectivity: Six blank samples of rat plasma from different sources were analyzed. Representative sMRM chromatograms of Astragaloside Figure 4 , including blank plasma ( Figure 4A ), blank plasma spiked with the analytes (Figure 4B ), and plasma sample from a normal rat 15 min after oral administration of mix-std ( Figure 4C ). The background noise was very low, and the absence of endogenous interference at or close to the retention time of the analytes clearly proves the high selectivity of the method. Linearity and sensitivity: Lowest limit of quantification (LLOQ) is calculated as the lowest level of the analytes that can be reliably detected with a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio above 10, and reproduced with an accuracy of 80-120%. Summary of regression equations, coefficient and LLOQs of the seven analytes in blank rat plasma are presented in Table 5 . All calibration curves exhibited good linearity with coefficient of determination (r 2 ) within the range of 0.995-0.999. The LLOQs were sensitive enough for quantitative detection of analytes in the pharmacokinetic studies. Accuracy and precision: Intra-day and inter-day precision was expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD) should not exceed 15% (or ±20% for LLOQ), and the accuracy was denoted by the proximity to the theoretical concentration relative error (RE) ((true value of concentration − observed value of concentration)/(true value of concentration) × 100%) should be within ±15% (or ±20% for LLOQ). Table 6 summarizes the accuracy, precision, recovery and matrix effect data of the seven analytes with different concentrations of low, medium and high in rat plasma (n = 5), Intra-day and inter-day precision was less than 13% in terms of RSD%, and the accuracy (RE%) was below 15%, with only one exception of cimicifugoside (17%) at its lowest concentration, which is still be acceptable (≤20%). These values indicate that the overall reproducibility of the method is within the bioanalytical method validation acceptance criteria as per FDA and EMA guidelines. Table 6 . Summary of accuracy, precision, recovery and matrix effect of the seven analytes in rat plasma (n = 5). Matrix effect and recovery: The results of matrix effect and recovery are also summarized in Table 6 , from which we can see that the extraction recoveries of analytes and matrix effect are all in the range of 75-120%, with only the recovery of calycosin at 122%, a little bit over the criteria. The other results show this method was consistent, precise and reproducible. Stability: The analytes would be considered stable when the accuracy bias was within ±15% of the nominal concentrations (or ±20% for LLOQ). Table 7 shows the results of stability studies under different conditions: the measured concentrations for seven analytes at each QC level were within ±13.5% of nominal values, indicating that they were stable under all conditions tested.
