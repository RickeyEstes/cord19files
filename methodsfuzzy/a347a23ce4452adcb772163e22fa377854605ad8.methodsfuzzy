Bearing in mind the above considerations, let us now consider the various approaches being developed to create vectors for gene therapy. In general, these can be divided into three groups: (i) active viruses, (ii) viral mimics that attempt to reproduce a subset of viral activities in a synthetic construct, and (iii) artificial delivery systems. Given the amount of effort being expended on the development of these systems, and the highly varied nature of the intended target diseases and organs, it is likely that there will never be a single best choice of method. Every disease will call for a tailored strategy that can be optimized to best fit the needs of the situation. Table 1 contains a summary and comparison of various gene therapy delivery vectors. Cationic Liposomes. Liposomes made entirely or partially of a cationic lipid have a charge-based affinity for DNA. When such liposomes are incubated in solution with DNA, they form complexes that can transfect cells. Several types of cationic lipid are available which in general have similar characteristics (Leventis and Silvius, 1990; Ito et al., 1990; Gao and Huang, 1991; Hazinski et al., 1991; Farhood et al., 1992) . This technique was initially intended exclusively for in vitro use. However, in vivo transfections have been performed with several commercial preparations of cationic lipids. There are several reasons why cationic lipid-DNA complexes have proved so popular for transfections: (i) They are very easy to prepare. The liposomes and the DNA are incubated together, and then used without further preparation. (ii) The complexes are relatively non-toxic. (iii) Transfections using this method are efficient with most cell types. And (iv) because the DNA remains outside the liposome, questions of entrapment efficiency do not apply. In vivo transfections using cationic lipid-DNA complexes are completely uncontrolled. That is, there are no targeting or specific binding agents present, and the complexes probably deliver DNA to the first cell they contact. This occurs most often in the first capillary bed through which the injected complexes pass. When DNA-lipid complexes are intravenously injected, the highest levels of gene expression are usually seen in the pulmonary vascular endothelium (Brigham et al., 1993) . DNA-lipid complexes introduced into the airway cause a generalized transfection of the lung. Because the site of transfection is completely uncontrolled, expression of the inserted gene may need to be regulated by means of tissue-specific promoters (Hazinski et al., 1991) . Cell specific promoters are not available for all tissues, and those currently available are sometimes less specific than desired. While both cationic liposomes and retroviral gene delivery vectors lack the ability to target specific cells, the lack of length constraints makes tissue-specific expression easier to achieve using DNA-lipid complexes as compared to retroviruses. Ca2 +/EDTA Chelation. In the presence of calcium, small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) composed of acidic phospholipids (typically phosphatidylserine) aggregate and fuse into large cochleate structures. When EDTA is added to chelate the calcium, these structures form large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) (Papahadjopoulos et al., 1975) . In the process, the vesicles encapsulate a substantial fraction of the surrounding solvent and solutes. If DNA is present, some of it becomes encapsulated in the vesicles. Two advantages of this technique are: (i) the DNA is not exposed to harsh conditions that would degrade it, and (ii) the entrapment is relatively efficient. However, the requirement for phosphatidylserine makes this technique impractical for most in vivo applications, with the exception of transfecting macrophages which have cell surface receptors for phosphatidylserine (PS). Detergent Dialysis (and Virosomes). When membranes are mixed with detergents at concentrations above their critical mixed micellar concentration (CMMC), they combine with the membrane's phospholipids and proteins to form mixed micelles. Because detergents are relatively water soluble, they can be removed from the mixed micelles by dialysis. When their concentration in the micelles falls below the CMMC, membrane bilayers regenerate and form liposomes. Enveloped viruses have membrane proteins that promote the fusion of the viral membrane with cellular membranes. When an enveloped virus fuses to a cell, the nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm, and the infection proceeds. Detergent solubilization of enveloped viruses produces a micellar mixture containing detergent, viral phospholipids, and viral membrane proteins. Dialysis of these detergent mixtures results in the production of liposomes that are often called virosomes to indicate the presence of viral proteins. If the dialysis is performed properly, the fusion proteins of many viruses can be reconstituted in an active conformation (White et al., 1983) . Viral fusion proteins having a variety of different characteristics have been identified. For example, some are only active at low pH and fuse with endosomal membranes, while others are active at physiological pH and fuse to the plasma membrane. Some viral fusion proteins, such as the HA protein of influenza, bind to specific receptors before fusion. A few viral fusion proteins will only promote fusion to target membranes containing a specific mixture of phospholipids (Cervin and Anderson, 1991; Nussbaum et al., 1992) . The major advantage of detergent dialysis is that it is very gentle since no sonication, vortexing, or organic solvent is used. This results in only a small amount of DNA fragmentation during encapsulation. Unfortunately, the efficiency of entrapment is very low, causing much of the DNA to be wasted and resulting in a high fraction of empty liposomes being formed. Loyter and co-workers have fused DNA-containing liposomes with cells by making empty virosomes and DNA-containing liposomes separately, and then fusing the two populations of vesicles in the presence of target cells (Lapidot and Loyter, 1990) . To date, this technique has not been used in vivo. Reverse-Phase Evaporation. Currently, the highest DNA entrapment efficiencies can be achieved when vesicles (REVs) are prepared by reverse-phase evaporation (Fraley et al., 1980) . REVs are prepared by bath sonication of a mixture of lipid, DNA, ether, and buffered saline, followed by evaporation of the ether to form a paste of phospholipid inverted monolayers surrounding aqueous droplets. These are resolved into liposomes by vortexing the paste. Encapsulation efficiency is high (up to 40 or 50%) because there is only a small amount of aqueous buffer present in relation to the amount of lipid. Presumably, DNA molecules present in the buffer are forced to curl up in small aqueous droplets, a conformation that is easily entrapped (Szelei and Duda, 1989) . Because the size distribution of the REVs is heterogeneous and hard to control, they are often sized by extrusion through a filter before use. Extrusion. Multilamellar vesicles formed by vortexing a hydrated lipid film are repeatedly passed (extruded) through a filter under pressure. As the liposomes are forced through the pores of the filter, they are converted from multilamellar to unilamellar vesicles, and the buffer and anything present in it is trapped inside the liposomes (Mayer et al., 1986) . To a certain extent, the size of the liposomes corresponds to the pore size of the filter used. Advantages of this technique are: (i) nearly any lipid or lipid mixture can be used, (ii) liposome size from 25 to 100 nm in diameter can be controlled, and (iii) the encapsulation efficiency is excellent (up to 30%). The main disadvantage is that the high pressures used in the extrusion process can fragment the DNA, and denature or dissociate DNA-protein complexes.
