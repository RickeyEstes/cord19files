As shown in Table 1 , all calibration curves of the glucosinolates showed good linearity (R 2 > 0.9991) within a relatively wide range of concentration (0.0365-3.080 mg/mL). The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were lower than 0.802 and 2.305 µg/mL, respectively. Table 1 . Regression equations, linear range, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for three analytes. The known purities of R-goitrin (%) and S-goitrin (%) were mixed and simultaneously determined by UV and CD to calculate the g factors ( Table 2 ). The relative purities of R-goitrin (%) and g factors made calibration curves. The calibration curve between g factors (X 2 ) and the different relative purities of R-goitrin (Y 2 ) was Y 2 = −0.0092X 2 + 0.4965 (R 2 = 0.9970), which showed a good linearity with a wide range of R-goitrin purities (0~100 %). Linearity was assessed by generating six-point calibration curves for each reference compound. The precision was evaluated by replicate injections of a mixture solution containing four glucosinolates and a sample solution of R. Isatidis (B10). Six injections of the same preparation solutions per day were investigated for three days. Six preparation solutions of a sample (B10) were analyzed for repeatability. To determine the recovery rate of extraction, the four reference components (approximately 50%, 100% and 150% of the original amount) were added to the weighed powder of R. Isatidis that was extracted and analyzed.
