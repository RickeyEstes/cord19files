IATA [5] provides comprehensive air travel data covering more than 12000 airports across the world. Given a source and destination airport, it provides the number of passengers traveling between the two airports as reported by the airlines ("reported PAX") and the IATA estimated ("reported + estimated PAX") per month. The travel details include both direct and multi-hop connections between the airports. In addition, it provides the different carriers serving the two airports, which allow for simulating airline cancellations using historical data. For this analysis, we used data from the month of February 2019. Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) [9] is a metric developed by the RAND Corporation to identify countries potentially most vulnerable to poorly controlled infectious disease outbreaks because of confluence of factors including political, economic, public health, healthcare, demographics, and disease dynamics. Arrival times are curated from the official situation reports [10] published by World Health Organization. Each country is associated with the first date of confirmed case, with China being assigned December 31st, 2019. Airline suspensions information available as on February 10th 2020, by airline and routes was obtained and curated from Bloomberg [11] and other websites 2 .
