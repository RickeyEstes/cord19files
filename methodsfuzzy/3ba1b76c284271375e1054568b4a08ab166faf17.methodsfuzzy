Chickens: Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) white leghorn eggs were obtained from Sunrise Farms, Inc., Catskill, NY, hatched and used in all experiments. All hatched chickens were used for the below outlined experiments regardless of sex. Chickens were housed in cages in BSL 2 facilities for the duration of the experiment. Food and water were provided ad libitum. All experimental procedures and animal care were performed in compliance with all applicable federal and institutional animal use guidelines. Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine is an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-accredited institution. IBV-vaccination and challenge: SPF chickens were ocularly vaccinated with 3 × 10 5 50% embryo infectious doses (EID 50 ) of a live attenuated ArkDPI IBV vaccine strain (Zoetis, New York, NY) in 50 l PBS, which was expanded in our laboratory. Chickens were vaccinated 1 day of age and 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks of age. All groups were challenged ocularly with 7.3 × 10 5 EID 50 of the AL/4614/98 IBV field strain 21 days after vaccination Sample collection: Tears were collected as previously described [19] . Blood samples were obtained by puncturing the brachial vein with a sterile 20G needle into Kendall monoject, EDTA containing, blood collection tubes (Tyco Healthcare Group LP, Mansfield, MA) and incubated on ice. Blood samples were centrifuged at 500 × g for 30 min. Plasma was collected and stored at −80 • C until tested. IBV propagation and purification for ELISA: IBV was propagated in SPF White Leghorn embryonated chicken eggs (Sunrise Farms, Inc., Catskills, NY) by inoculation on day 10 of embryonation as previously reported [20] . Supernatants were titrated for the IBV virus using the Reed and Muench method [21] . IBV was treated with 0.1% ␤-propriolactone for 30 min at 37 • C [22] . Inactivation of the virus was confirmed by injection into embryonated eggs. The inactivated IBV was purified based on a previously published protocol [23] . The virus was then stored at −80 • C until used.
