rNA isolation, cdNA synthesis, and nucleic acid sequencing. Viral RNA was extracted from a field sample of BRAV RS3X (Ide and Darbyshire, 1969) using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen NV). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScript® III First-Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an oligo-dT primer and approximately 1 µg of total RNA as the template. Different fragments of RS3X cDNA from the 5′ UTR end to the 3′ UTR end were amplified in a model PTC-200 thermal cycler (MJ Research Inc.) and using the Phusion High Fidelity PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with specific primer pairs complementary to BRAV. The PCR reaction conditions used were according to the manufacturer's recommendations for amplification products between 5 kilobase (kb) pairs and 9 kb pairs. The 5′ end of the genome between the putative poly(C) and VP3 coding regions was isolated by using a commercially available rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) kit (SMART™ RACE; Clontech Laboratories Inc.). A 3′ anchored cDNA was synthesized using the complimentary gene specific primer (VP3-R1: 5′ TTGGGCCTCACTCA-GAGTGGTGGGGGGAT-3′) and by following the manufacturer's protocol. By using the Advantage® 2-PCR enzyme system, 5′ RACE reactions were carried out using anchor (universal primer mix) and gene-specific primers (VP3-R2: 5′-TGGGTCCGCGGTGATGGGACTAGTGGTGC-3′) according to the manufacturer's recommendations for amplification of products ranging from 1 kb to 5 kb. PCR products were purified using a PCR-purification kit (Qiagen NV), and the integrity of amplicons was confirmed on a 1% agarose gel. Sequences corresponding to the ends of the purified amplicons were obtained by direct sequencing with specific primers designed from previously determined partial BRAV (SD-1) sequence. Subsequent sequence data were determined by using a "primer walking" strategy in which primers for sequencing were designed based on ongoing sequence determination. All sequencing reactions were carried out using the Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analyzed on a PRISM 3730xl automated DNA sequencer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). sequence assembly and genome annotation. Nucleotide sequences were assembled and analyzed with Sequencher (Gene Codes Corporation). The sequence reported in this work has been deposited in the GenBank database under accession number KT948520. All other GenBank accession numbers are indicated either in figures or figure legends. Analysis of nucleic acid and amino acid sequences in relation to related Aphthoviruses. Molecular phylogenetic analysis by neighbor-joining method. The evolutionary history of BRAV RS3X was inferred by building P1 and 3D pol coding region phylogeny in Picornaviridae using the neighbor-joining method based on the Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) matrixbased model for amino acid substitution 27 included in MEGA 6 software package. 28 The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1,000 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. 29 Positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated (pairwise deletions only). There were a total of 1247 sites for the P1 region and 552 sites for 3D pol in the final dataset. Selection pressure analysis. Selection pressure was evaluated by determining the natural selection mechanisms acting on the codons of the ORFs of Aphthoviruses and BRVs. These mechanisms were determined using hypothesis testing using phylogenies package under the Datamonkey web-server (www.datamonkey.org). 30 The dN/dS ratios (v) were calculated using three different codon-based maximum likelihood approaches: the single-likelihood ancestor (SLAC), fixed-effects likelihood (FEL), and the internal branch fixed-effects likelihood (IFEL). 31, 32 The mixed effects model of evolution (MEME) method, a branch-site model, was also employed for studying the selection pressure. This method is a generalization of FEL, which models variable (v) across lineages at an individual site that could to detect smaller proportions of evolving branches subject to positive selection that would otherwise be detected as "negatively" selected by FEL. 33 For all the methods employed for the ORF datasets, the HKY 95 model was used as a nucleotide substitution bias model. Trees were inferred by the neighbor-joining method and significance levels were set at P , 0.05 or Bayes factor 0.50. Recombination analysis. Possible recombination events among different Aphthoviruses and BRVs were assessed separately using RDP v.4.65. 34 In default mode, RDP, GENECONV, CHIMAERA, MAXCHI, BOOTSCAN, PHYLPRO, LARD, SISCAN, and 3SEQ algorithms were utilized to detect potential recombination events between the input sequences. 34 Structural modeling. Homology models of BRAV RS3X 2B and FMDV A 24 Cruzeiro 2B were built using the hepatitis C virus structure (protein data bank (PDB): 2MTS). VP1 of FMDV A 24 Cruzeiro and BRAV RS3X were modeled using the FMDV type O capsid (PDB: 1FOD Chain 1) as a template. All of the homology models were prepared on SWISS-MODEL workspace. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] The stereochemical quality of the models was further validated with PROCHECK. 40 Structures were rendered using USCF-Chimera 1.10. 41 results Genome and genome encoded proteins. We sequenced the near full-length genome of BRAV RS3X (7,267 nucleotides) from a putative poly(C) tract at the 5′ UTR end to the poly(A) tail at the 3′ end. 5′ UTR. Starting with the 5′ UTR poly(C) of BRAV, RS3X shares 64.12%, 54.00%, and 41.03% nucleotide sequence identity to FMDV (A 24 Cruzeiro), BRBV, and ERAV, respectively. L pro . ORF scan analysis suggests that L pro of BRAV RS3X is smaller in comparison with the Lab form observed in other Aphthoviruses including FMDV, BRBV, and BRAV isolates BSRI 4 and 140032-1. As shown in Figure 1 , the L pro active site (highlighted in yellow color) 42 and translation initiation factor-binding sites (highlighted in cyan color) are conserved among BRAVs. Importantly, in BRAV RS3X, these sites are identical to other members of the Aphthovirus genus (Figs. 1A and B). [43] [44] [45] P1 region. The structural protein VP4, the first encoded protein from the P1 region, shows the highest conservation among Aphthoviruses as well as BRVs. However, BRVs encode a longer VP4 protein than other Aphthoviruses. The N-terminus of VP2 is remarkably conserved among all Aphthoviruses. The rest of the VP2 protein and the entire VP3 and VP1 of BRVs and ERAV are distinctively different from that of FMDV. Additionally, the characteristic RGD tripeptide, which serves as the cell surface-binding site in the VP1 G-H loop of FMDV, [46] [47] [48] is lacking in all other Aphthoviruses, suggesting an alternative mechanism of their interaction/attachment to the cell surface (Figs. 1A and B). Considering the absence of the RGD tripeptide in BRAV RS3X VP1, structural models of FMDV A 24 Cruzeiro and BRAV RS3X were prepared and compared. Structural models of the two proteins when superimposed on each other show that the G-H loop region is completely disordered in the BRAV RS3X VP1 molecule, which reinforces the speculation that a different virusreceptor interaction occurs on the cell surface (Fig. 2Bi) . Non-structural proteins. 2A containing a C-terminal ribosome-skipping motif NPG↓P encoded by all Aphthoviruses (and many other Picornaviruses) is similar in size. The N-termini of 2A show greater variation, suggesting a lesser functional significance for this region. 49, 50 The most obvious differences between BRVs (including BRAV RS3X reported here) and FMDV (Figs. 1A and B) are the sizes of the 2B and 3A proteins as well as the number of 3B (VPg) peptides encoded. The N-terminus of the 2B "viroporin" [51] [52] [53] in all Aphthoviruses, but FMDV bears a significant deletion toward the N-terminus. TMMH (membrane protein topology prediction method) web server analysis revealed that 2B of BRAV RS3X lacks a trans-membrane region that is observed in FMDV A 24 Cruzeiro (Figs. 2Ai and ii). However, when we built a homology model of BRBV RS3X 2B using hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7 viroporin (PDB: 2MTS), the viroporin domain appeared to be conserved in BRAV RS3X and was very similar to HCV p7. In fact, the pore lining histidine residue is only present in BRAV RS3X, and FMDV 2B lacks the pore lining α-helix altogether, suggesting a different mechanism for FMDV 2B interaction with intracellular membranes (Fig. 2Bi) . The non-structural protein 3A contains two hydrophobic residues (L38 and 41 in FMDV) that are supposedly important for its attachment to intracellular membranes. Although the hydrophobicity of the amino acid residues corresponding to residues 38 and 41 of FMDV 3A are conserved among all the Aphthoviruses, the smaller 3A of BRAV RS3X and ERAV followed by BRBV indicates a divergence in the membrane association of 3A of these viruses from FMDV. 54 The functional significance of smaller 2B and 3A proteins remains undefined and invites further investigation. Furthermore, the 2C-ATPase is conserved in BRAV RS3X as well as other Aphthoviruses when compared to FMDV. Importantly, the amino acid residues corresponding to residues 116, 160, and 207 of FMDV 2C that are critical to 2C activity are conserved in BRV RS3X and other Aphthoviruses compared here (Figs. 1A and B) . FMDV is unique among Picornaviruses with respect to encoding three non-identical copies of the 3B (VPg) protein in its P3 region, although possible examples of two copies of VPg are speculated for members of the Aquamavirus, Mosavirus, and possibly Passerivirus genera (N.J.K., unpublished observations). Unlike FMDV, BRAV RS3X and all other Aphthoviruses encode only one copy of the nonstructural protein 3B that closely resembles the third non-identical copy of FMDV 3B (3B 3 ). Importantly, the tyrosine residue at position 3, a target for uridylation and a substrate for virus genome replication, is conserved in this single copy gene. 55 Finally, as expected, both the 3C pro and 3D pol (highlighted in yellow color) are most conserved and catalyti cally important residues of the two proteins (highlighted in yellow color) are absolutely conserved in all the viruses compared herein. 56, 57 Phylogeny. We constructed neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees of the structural protein region P1 as well as non-structural protein 3D pol , the former being most diverse and latter being most conserved. The BRAV RS3X sequence reported in this study and all of the classified Picornaviruses (54 species in 31 genera, as shown in Fig. 3 ) were utilized to illustrate the evolutionary space of BRAV RS3X in Picornaviridae. 11 The amino acid sequences of the P1 and 3D pol regions were first aligned with the Muscle algorithm implemented in MEGA 6, and later were manually curated to ensure the accuracy of the alignment. Finally, a phylogeny tree was constructed as specified in the Materials and methods section. The resulting P1 phylogenetic trees (Fig. 3A) show clear divergence between the BRAVs separated by distinct nodes. The RS3X strain and isolate BSRI4 cluster together, while isolate SD1 forms another distinct node, and isolate H1 and strain 140032-1 form a third distinct cluster. Other Aphthoviruses including FMDV strain A 24 Cruzeiro, BRBV, and ERAV each form separate nodes characteristic of their genera. However, as would be expected, all of the Aphthoviruses group together, thus proving their close evolutionary relationship within the genus Aphthovirus. The NJ-JTT phylogeny tree of the 3D pol region showed similar clustering of Aphthoviruses (Fig. 3B) . BRAV RS3X and the isolates BSRI4, SD1, H1, and 140032-1 form a cluster distinct from FMDV A 24 Cruzeiro, BRBV, and ERAV. Finally, the order of relatedness exactly matched with that of the P1 region phylogeny. selection pressure analysis. Positive selection is a major mechanism of RNA virus evolution. Therefore, we first analyzed the selection pressure between Aphthoviruses that are the closest relatives to BRAV by including the BRAV RS3X strain, Bioinformatics and Biology insights 2015:9(s2) Table 1 show that the SLAC method did not detect any codon site subject to positive selection between these viruses. However, the FEL method detected codon sites 489 and 832 in the structural protein P1 region and codon site 1958 in the 3D pol region under positive selection pressure. The IFEL method that computes site-wise selection only on the internal branches of the phylogeny tree detected 14 sites subject to positive evolutionary selection, with ten sites in the 3D pol region and four in the structural protein P1 region. Together, these data suggest that the 3D pol region has the higher prevalence of evolutionary selection. SLAC and FEL methods detected 363 and 425 sites under negative evolutionary pressure, whereas IFEL unexpectedly found only 3 sites under negative selection. It appears that the selection pressure detected by IFEL, by virtue of working on the internal branches of the phylogeny tree, detects mostly the selection events within species and hence BRAV RS3X and BRBV, being more closely related, would yield such unexpected results. Analysis of selection pressures acting among BRVs by the SLAC method did not detect any positive selection. The FEL method detected one codon site, 680 in the structural protein region under positive selection. However, the IFEL method detected six codon sites subject to positive selection. Four of these sites (614, 617, 680, and 811) are in the structural proteins, one (139) in L pro , and one (1806) in 3C pro . All three methods identified numerous sites under negative selection pressure in BRVs with SLAC, FEL, and IFEL detecting 511, 1143, and 843 sites subject to negative selection, respectively. The MEME method, which represents an advancement to the FEL method and detects positive selection sites that would be detected negative in the FEL method, detected 6 codon sites under positive selection among Aphthoviruses: three in the 3D pol region at positions 2054, 2331, and 2394; one at position 49 in the L pro region; and sites 735 and 884 in the P1 structural region (Table 1 ). Among BRVs, the MEME method detected 22 sites subject to positive purifying selection and distributed evenly along the ORF, clearly suggesting the existence of strong positive selection within BRV species ( Table 2) . determination of potential recombination events. During recombination, two molecules of DNA or RNA that carry matching sites (homologous sequences) exchange their segments to yield novel combinations. In fact, recombination is considered to contribute significantly to RNA virus evolution. When analyzing a group of nucleotide sequences for the probability of recombination events, the most common first step is to search for so-called "recombination breakpoints" in the existing sequences. Multiple algorithms have been designed to dissect an alignment of
