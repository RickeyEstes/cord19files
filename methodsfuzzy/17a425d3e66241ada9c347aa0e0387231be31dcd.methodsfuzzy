Fingerprint of YPFS was made by Agilent HPLC system fitted with DAD at 210 nm. The mobile phase consisting of 0.1% phosphate buffer (A) and acetonitrile (B) was eluted at a linear gradient flow of 1 mL/min at 5%-60% B within 60 min. The detection of analytes was accomplished with a C18 column (Inertsil, 4.66250 mm, 5 mm or equivalent). The herbal extract of YPFS was dissolved in methanol at 40 mg/mL for 30 min sonication, and which was filtered through 0.22 mm filtration membrane before injection. The chemical analysis was performed on an Agilent RRLC 1200 series system (Agilent) equipped with a degasser, a binary pump, an auto-sampler, a DAD and a thermostated column compartment. The herbal extract was separated on an Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 column (1.8 mm, 4.6650 mm) . An Agilent QQQ-MS/MS (6410A) equipped with an ESI ion source was operated in negative or positive ion mode. The drying gas temperature was 325uC; drying gas flow: 10 L/min; nebulizer pressure: 35 psig; capillary voltage: 4000 V; delta electro multiplier voltage: 400 V. Ten mL (after a 0.45 mm Millipore filter) samples were injected. In a negative mode, a linear gradient elution was applied from 15-20% B at 0-3 min, 20-30% B at 3-8 min, 30-40% B at 8-14 min, 40-75% B at 14-18 min, 15-15% B at 18.5-22 min. In a positive mode, a linear gradient elution was applied from 10-35% B at 0-5.5 min, 35-65% B at 5.5-6 min, 65% B at 6-10 min, 65-80% B at 10-14 min, 10% B at 14.5-18 min. Agilent Mass Hunter workstation software version B.01.00 was used for data acquisition and processing.
