The present investigation is a part of a population-based case-control study on MS which was conducted in the Hantes-Pyr~ntes "dtpartement" (a jurisdiction in the southwest of France). Ascertainment of MS cases is described with details elsewhere [11] . Only patients with definite or probable MS according to the criteria of Poser et al [ 12] were included. A control group consisting of healthy individuals of similar age and sex as the patients and living in the same area was selected for comparisons. The geographical origin of patients and controls was documented by their birthplace and that of their parents. The present investigation was restricted to the major histocompatibility complex class II antigens, HLA-DR 1-w14 and HLA-DQ wl-w3. Typing was performed by the two-color fluorescence method using 49 anti HI.A-DR and 9 HLA-DQ alloantisera or monoclonal antibodies, either local or obtained by exchanges following the Eighth and Ninth Histocompatibility Workshops. Samples were also tested for Gm allotypes of lgGl: G1m (1, 2, 3, 17), IgG2: G2m (23), and IgG3: Gm (5, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 28) . Allotyping was performed by the classical hemagglutination inhibition method on opaline plates at room temperature [13] . The reagents used for determination were of human origin, except for the G2m [23] allotype (rabbit antisera). The allotypes IgG3 (5, 10, 11, 13, 14) are designated by 5*. Rubella, measles, cytomegalovirur, herpes simplex type 1 virus, varicella, and mumps antibodies were determined using ELISA technique (Enzygnost Behring). Titers were defined by comparing optic density between each sample and serial dilutions of a known reference serum. Logdogit regression curves of this reference serum were established on computer. Coronavirus antigen was prepared in our laboratory from bovine enteric coronavirus (BECV) (stain C3II100) cultivated on HRT 18 (human rectal adenocarcinoma), kindly supplied by J. Laporte (INRA, Grignon, France). HRT 18 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 u/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Two-day-old confluent monolayers were inoculated with BECV diluted in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The inoculum was allowed to adsorb for 1 hr at 37Â°(2 with manual rocking every 10 rain, then the medium was removed and fresh medium added. After an incubation period of 3 days at 370C, cell cukures were frozen and thawed; suspension was homogenized and centrifuged at 3400 g for 10 rain. The superuatant was then centrifugated at 18,500 g for 1 hr (Ultra centrifuge, Beckman, Rotor 50Ti). The supematant was removed and the pellet homogenized in buffer pH 9.6 (Na2CO3 0.1 M, NaHCO~ 0.1 M). After centfifugation for 10 rain at 3400 g, the superna~ant was titrated by checkboard technique using human serum with high titer of coronavirus antibodies. The same, previously described, technique of ELISA titration was used for the determination of coronavirus antibodies. All alters were compared by transforming to log 2 the reciprocal of dilutions (geometric titer). An arbitrarily small number was assigned to trace and undetectable titers. All typlngs and serological measurements were performed blindly. Statistics. Antigen frequencies were compared by the X 2 test and geometric titers by the two-tailed t-test. Variance analysis was performed for relationships between genetic marker frequencies and viral antibody titers.
