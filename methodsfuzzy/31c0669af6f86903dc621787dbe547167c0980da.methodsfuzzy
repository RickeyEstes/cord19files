Genpeptides, Conserved domain (CD) 63 and protein family (Pfam) 64 databases were used in this study. Amino acid sequence alignments were generated using ClustalX1.81 65 and Dialign2 66 programs assisted by Blosum position-specific matrices, 67 and were processed for presentation using GeneDoc. 68 Multiple sequence alignments were converted into hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles using HMMER2.01 software. 69 Sequence databases were searched in default mode, unless stated otherwise, using the HMMER2.01 package. 64, 69 and a family of Blast programs. 70 The expectation values of similarity (E) of 0.05 or lower for Blast searches and 0.1 or lower for HMMERmediated searches were considered to be statistically significant. 71 Database searches with nidovirus proteins (Tables 1 and 2) and their alignments were conducted in an iterative mode until no new homologs were identified. Also, sequences that were identified below the threshold during the last iteration were used to initiate reciprocal searches that might have resulted in new significant matches. This approach worked for all protein families described here, except for the identification of the relationship between the nidovirus ExoN family and cellular DEDD superfamily, which is known to be extremely diverse. 43 In this latter case, using the MAST program, 72 we found a strong match ðp ¼ 3 e 210 Þ between the most conserved motif III of a DEDD protein and a conserved block of the ExoN family that facilitated the identification of the two other motifs in the nidovirus proteins having a non-typical intermotif spacing partially occupied by Zn-finger(s) (see the text and Figure 4 ). Furthermore, we observed an approximately 30 times selective increase of the global similarity between the ExoN family and DEDD proteins, after the coronavirus sequences were modified artificially by removing putative Zn-fingers that are not present in the DEDD proteins. In the HMMER-mediated searches of .10 6 sequences using this Zn-finger-deficient ExoN family as a query, numerous DEDD proteins were retrieved immediately after the nidovirus proteins, starting with E ¼ 0:81: The relatively poor statistics of these hits were due to the failure by HMMER to align all three motifs. Cluster phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the neighbour-joining algorithm described by Saitou & Nei 73 with the Kimura correction, 74 and were evaluated with 1000 bootstrap trials, as implemented in the Clus-talX1.81 program. Parsimonious trees were generated using exhaustive search and evaluated with bootstrap branch-and-bound search using a UNIX version of the PAUP p 4.0.0d55 program that is included in the GCG-Wisconsin Package programs. The resulting trees were visualized using the TreeView program. 75
