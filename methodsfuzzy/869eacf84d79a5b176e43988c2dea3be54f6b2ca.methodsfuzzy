Clothing. In total, nine types of clothing were used as test samples. The properties of these clothes are provided in Table I . The clothes had been worn for the daily activities of college students (Wakayama Medical University School of Health and Nursing Science, Wakayama, Japan); thus, had the potential to be contaminated by influenza A virus during the epidemic season. The clothing had been subjected to routine wearing and washing for several months or years. The thickness of the cloth was determined using a micrometer screw gauge and the samples were cut into ~1.5-cm 2 sections. Subsequently, the samples were sterilized using an autoclave, and air-dried for several days.
