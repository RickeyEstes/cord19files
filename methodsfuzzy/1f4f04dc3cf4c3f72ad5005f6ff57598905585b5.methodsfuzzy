123 positive samples of PEDV including feces and intestinal contents obtained prior to April 2013 were kept in our laboratories. These samples were originally collected from different farms in several provinces in China (Wen et al., 2018) . 19 PEDV strains were isolated and propagated in Vero cells with 10 Î¼g/mL trypsin from these positive samples as described previously (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) . PEDV was enriched for 100 folds and purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The complete genome sequences of these virus strains were sequenced and assembled as described previously (Gong et al., 2017) . Briefly, total RNAs of each sample were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). cDNA was generated applying ProtoScript II reverse transcriptase and second strand synthesis enzyme mix (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). Size selection of adaptor-ligated DNA was then carried out using AxyPrep Mag PCR Clean-up (Axygen, Tewksbury, MA, USA), and fragments of~360 bp Fig. 1 . Phylogenetic analysis of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strains based on complete genomic sequences. According to the full-length genomic nucleotide sequences, the tree was performed by neighbor-joining method using MEGA with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The porcine deltacoronavirus strain PDCoV/ USA/Minnesota140/2015 sequence was used to set as an outgroup control. The names of GenBank accession numbers, the strains, years and places of isolation are show on the right in order, and the genogroups of virus are shown on the right of strains.
