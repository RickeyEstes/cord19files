The solution pH was measured using an EF-20K pH meter (Mettler, Switzerland). μm) (Waters, USA) (Text S1). In all figures, the relative standard deviations for all data points is less than 5%, and the error bars represent the standard deviations (n = 3). J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Table S1 ). Rapid MB degradation was observed in the VUV/UV process (kVUV/UV = 251.2 m 2 einstein -1 ), which generated HO • from the VUV photolysis of H2O (Eqs. (2) and (3)) [14] . After adding PS, MB degradation during the VUV/UV/PS process (kVUV/UV/PS) was significantly higher than that under VUV/UV irradiation owing to the additional indirect oxidation by SO4 •generated during the VUV and UV photolysis of PS. Additionally, kVUV/UV/PS (327.6 m 2 einstein -1 ) was 3.2 times higher than kUV/PS as more ROSs were produced by the VUV photolysis of H2O and PS.
