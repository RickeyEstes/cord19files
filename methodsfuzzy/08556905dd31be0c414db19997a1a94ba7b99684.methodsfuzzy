Based upon the reviewed literature and experts' opinions, this survey study developed a research framework for ''factors influencing a hospital's willingness to adopt ICKM," which includes four constructs: ''hospital characteristics," ''infection control department," ''external environment," and ''project planning" (see Fig. 1 ). Questionnaire survey was used in this study with infection control department colleagues as respondents. After responses were collected, the discriminant analysis method was adopted to examine the hypotheses and relevant discussions. This survey adopted a 5-point Likert scale, the content of which was based on questionnaire samples and pertinent theories proposed and verified by earlier researchers (Ein-Dor & Segev, 1978; Gardner, 1999; Gatignon & Robertson, 1989; Grover, 1998; Grover & Goslar, 1993; Haley, 1997; Inamura et al., 2003; Laurie, 1997; Premkumar & Robert, 1999; Premkumar & Ramamurthy, 1995; Raymond, 1990; Saranto & Leino-Kilpi, 1997; Sher et al., 2005; Staggers et al., 2002; Verhey, 1999; Wiig, 1997; Yap et al., 1994) . Furthermore, a group of experts, which includes a professor in medical information management and an executive of a hospital's infection control department, were invited to review and modify the questionnaire. Then, an in-depth interview and a pretest were conducted on three experienced ICPs, whose opinions were compiled as the modification reference for the final draft of the questionnaire. Likert five-point scale was adopted, in which 1 means ''strongly disagree" and 5 ''strongly agree."
