With this study, it was only the second time that the SCEES, a MAF division usually dealing with economic issues, have collaborated on animal health management issues (Barnouin and Berger, 1988) . Such a collaboration gave the study an advantage in terms of a representative sample of bovine herds, a high response rate to the state survey, and the skills of trained professional surveyors. One of the main concerns in such types of study is the ability of farmers to correctly diagnose the syndrome. In France, many diagnoses and treatments are performed and implemented by farmers alone, veterinarians intervening only for serious cases. Therefore farmers were the only observers able to report ABRD outbreaks occurring in their herds. Moreover, they were provided with a case definition by the surveyors. Sivula et al. (1996) demonstrated that farmer diagnosis of calf mortality due to pneumonia had a sensitivity of 56% and a specificity of 100%. Consequently, relying on farmers' reports could have led to some underestimation of the cumulative incidence of ABRD at farm level. Another concern about this retrospective study was the recall biases. ABRD is important enough in terms of economic consequences in the herds to be noticed by the farmers who would not consider the event as commonplace and unimportant and would remember it. Consequently, recall bias in reporting the occurrence of the ABRD was expected to be low, but it may have been higher in reporting date information. However, even if the month could have been approximate, the general period was considered to be reliable, and the seasonal trend unaffected by the potential for recall biases.
