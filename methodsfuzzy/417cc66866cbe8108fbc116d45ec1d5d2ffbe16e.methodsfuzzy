Patients were recruited from the joint Immunology-Respiratory service at the Royal Free Hospital, London. Patients had a diagnosis of CVID made by a clinical immunologist following the definitions of the Pan-American Group for Immunodeficiency and the European Society for Immunodeficiencies. 14 All were receiving immunoglobulin replacement and were under regular (at least 6-monthly) clinical review. The only exclusion criterion was inability to provide informed consent. All participants provided written informed consent (REC 04/Q0501/119). For this observational, prospective cohort study, patients completed daily checkbox symptom diaries for 90 days between December 2014 and February 2015. Participants were asked to report new or increased respiratory symptoms from a predefined list ( Figure E1 ). Chronic or stable symptoms were not to be reported. Patients reported daily the use of OAT to treat breakthrough infections and once a month the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Patients discontinued prophylactic antibiotics if they started OAT for breakthrough infections. Participating patients were also asked to complete the SGRQ, a validated measure of respiratory health status scored between 0 (best) and 100 (worst) quality of life and on which 4 points is considered the minimum clinically important difference. E1 The SGRQ was conducted at the end of the study period so that its 3-month recall period covered the period during which the diary was competed. Baseline information on spirometry, computed chest tomography, previous bacterial isolates on sputum culture, Medical Research Council breathlessness score, and smoking status was collected from medical records and the departmental database. From these data, we calculated the bronchiectasis severity index, a validated multicomponent score in bronchiectasis that predicts the future risk of exacerbations, hospitalizations, and mortality. E2 Simultaneously, we conducted an observational cross-sectional study in which patients experiencing acute respiratory symptoms provided samples for bacterial and viral testing. A total of 54 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 41 patients if patients were able to tolerate the procedure. A total of 43 spontaneously expectorated sputum samples were obtained from 34 patients if patients were able to produce a sufficient quantity of sputum. These samples were either collected by clinic staff or, after careful instruction on sampling, submitted directly from patients by mail.
