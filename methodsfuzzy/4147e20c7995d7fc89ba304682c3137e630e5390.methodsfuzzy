In this study, we used the Box and Jenkins (1970) ; ARIMA and Box and Tiao (1975) ITSA methods to predict the number of tourists which will then be used to estimate the loss of tourists during the 1st 12 months post-SF period. First, we use the ARIMA model to predict the number of tourists using the pre-SF data on the assumption that the past and present behavior of the data will continue. The data series should be stabilized before forecasting. It is a general practice to plot the raw data to see if there is any irregular variation, trend, seasonality, and/or other behavior that can be observed. Most often differencing the data can be used to achieve stationarity. Otherwise more sophisticated techniques of TS data analysis such as the ARIMA model should be applied to predict the number of tourists for the post-SF period. The ARIMA model is accomplished with the autocorrelation function (acf) and partial autocorrelation function (pacf). By matching the known properties of the model with the observed acf and pacf and undertaking various tests of the stability of the data tentative models are identified, estimated, and checked (see Box & Jenkins, 1970) . The Minimum Akaike (1973) Information Criterion Estimate (MAICE) is used to select the best model if several models satisfy the Ljung and Box (1978) Portmanteau test on residuals. Using the estimated parameters of the chosen model, forecasts are made for the post-SF period. In practice TS data are subject to various interventions and hence the ARIMA model alone cannot produce accurate forecasts. Under this situation, the ITSA method can incorporate various interventions with the ARIMA model and can produce a more reliable and accurate forecast. The ITSA method can also control the long-term trend and is more potentially sensitive. More importantly it can test the intervention coefficients to see whether the interventions significantly reduced the tourist numbers by using a one-tailed t-test. In this study, we should use two ARIMA models. First, for the SF to predict tourist numbers for the post-SF period based on pre-SF data, which can be used to measure the loss of tourists during the post-SF period by comparing the actual and predicted numbers (or ITSA estimate), based on the occurrence of the GFC without SF. Second, we also should use another ARIMA model for the GFC which occurred and affected tourist numbers prior to SF based on the pre-GFC data to predict the number of tourists for the post-SF period due to the GFC. One ITSA model was then redesigned with the best ARIMA fitted to the SF by incorporating two intervention variables: one for SF and another for the GFC. Now this newly developed ITSA model was estimated using the entire data set from January 2005 to May 2010. This model allows us to test the intervention coefficients for SF and the GFC to investigate whether they significantly reduced tourist numbers. The robustness of the ITSA method can be examined by comparing the predicted tourist numbers with the actual numbers. In this study both the ARIMA and ITSA models are used to estimate the loss of tourists for the post-SF period from June 2009 to May 2010 whose empirical illustrations are given below.
