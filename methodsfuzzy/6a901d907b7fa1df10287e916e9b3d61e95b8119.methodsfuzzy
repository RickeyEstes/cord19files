We now describe the construction of the model and the estimation method which allowed us to analyze the data set detailed above. Underlying assumptions are labelled A 1 , A 2 , A 3,a√Äc , A 4 . The model and the estimation method allow the handling of time-period censoring and group effects. In the following the context of fish survival is used to present the model; nevertheless, as mentioned in the introduction, the model can be applied in other contexts.
