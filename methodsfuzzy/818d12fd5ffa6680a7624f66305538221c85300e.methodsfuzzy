A herd comprised of 11 Hanwoo (a native Korean breed of cattle) cattle was placed in a feedlot, given easy access to water, and fed a total mixed ration (TMR) diet twice daily (at 06:30 AM and 18:00 PM). No supplements, vitamins, or minerals were given to the herd. The herd also had limited access to grass in the feedlot. Two castrated male calves from the herd, a 6-month-old (calf 1) and a 3-month-old (calf 2) presented with diarrhea, temporary anorexia, and blindness of a week's duration. The two affected suckler calves were housed along with the cows and their diet was supplemented with rice straw and a milk replacer. However, both calves denied the milk replacer and were, therefore, fed only by suckling and rice straw. Neither the physical condition nor the appetite of either calf was suppressed by the condition of the calves. A full ophthalmological examination, including slit lamp biomicroscopy (portable Keeler PSL ® , Keeler Ltd., Windsor, U.K.) and indirect ophthalmoscopy (Vantage Indirect Ophthalmoscope ® , Keeler Ltd.), was performed. Based on the history and the ophthalmic findings, a tentative diagnosis of hypovitaminosis A was made. Blood samples were collected, transferred into lightblocking containers, and sent to the laboratory for serum vitamin A measurement using liquid chromatography.
