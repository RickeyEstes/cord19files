Protocol and registration. The review strategy and details were registered prospectively in PROSPERO as the record 2014:CRD42014009072. Eligibility criteria. We undertook an extensive and systematic search of all published studies related to host genetics implicated in development or outcome of respiratory tract infectious diseases. Instead of focusing on a single-disease approach, we aimed at delivering systematic evidence on all respiratory infections, including cases where a syndrome phenotype was reported, such as pneumonia, without the specific pathogen information. Scientific RepoRts | 5:16119 | DOi: 10.1038/srep16119 Information sources. We used three bibliographic databases; PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ pubmed), Web of Science (http://wok.mimas.ac.uk) and Scopus (http://www.scopus.com). We also performed an additional search of the HuGe Literature Finder (http://www.hugenavigator.net), to identify articles that might have been missed in PubMed. Search. Two of the joint first authors performed the search and study selection, which was supervised by the last author. The last author also resolved any discrepancies in scoring system or data extraction process. The search was performed on May 06, 2014, with an update performed on August 25, 2015. After duplicates removal, the search yielded a total of 24,823 articles. All identified articles were firstly checked for inclusion by reading the Title and Abstract. This led to identification and exclusion of a total of 23,677 studies. The remaining 881 articles were supplemented by hand search of their references, producing an additional set of 265 articles. In total, we used a set of 1,146 articles that were read in full and screened against inclusion criteria (Supplementary Figure 5) .
