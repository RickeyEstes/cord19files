We prospectively evaluated two real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the rapid diagnosis of rickettsial infections using several blood fractions. These assays were designed for use on the JBAIDS instrument (Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System; BioFire Diagnostics, Inc. (formerly Idaho Technology), Salt Lake City, UT): a ruggedized, field-portable real-time PCR system. Specimens from 180 patients recruited into a study of fever of unknown origin on the Thailand-Myanmar border were included in the evaluation. Consenting patients' 5 years of age, with a febrile illness ( 38 C) of 7 days duration and a negative malaria test, were eligible for inclusion. Venous blood (EDTA tube) was collected for PCR at enrollment and serum was collected at enrollment and Day 14 for IFA analyses. Blood specimens were aliquoted and stored at −80 C before testing. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Thailand (MUTM 2011-008-01) and Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OXTREC 42-10). To compare the impact of use of different blood fractions in these PCRs, DNA was extracted from whole blood (adult patients only), buffy coat (all patients), and selected acute serum specimens (described below). Eight hundred microliters of whole blood and serum were extracted using the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path purification kit (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc.) and 200 μL of buffy coat was extracted using the QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions. Elution volumes were 200 μL (whole blood/buffy coat) and 100 μL (serum). Two JBAIDS-based TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR assays were designed for the specific detection of O. tsutsugamushi (47-kDa outer membrane protein gene) or Rickettsia spp. (17-kDa antigen gene). Primer and probe sequences for 17-kDa gene were modified slightly from previously published assays (see Reference 6) and optimized for use on the JBAIDS platform (R17KF_4: 5 -AAA CAA GGK CAN GGH ACA CTT CTT G-3 , R17KR: 5 -AAG TAA TGC RCC TAC ACC TAC TC-3 , and RProbeV2: 5 -6FAM-CCG AAT TGA GAA CCA AGT AAT GC-TAMRA-3 ). The limit of detection was determined by testing the lowest level of spiked template that could be detected in at least 95% of specimens (i.e., 19 out of 20 replicates) and found to be 25 copies of target template per reaction. Both target assays were multiplexed with an internal inhibition control. The DNA extracts (20 μL/assay) were added to the freeze-dried reagent tubes along with 20 μL of reconstitution buffer and immediately tested in duplicate (individual reaction volume 20 μL; DNA template volume 10 μL/reaction) on the JBAIDS instrument. Positive and negative controls were included in each PCR run. The JBAIDS instrument software automatically determined the specific operation of the instrument, i.e. times, temperatures, and number of PCR cycles, and determined a result for the duplicate reactions. Whole blood and buffy coat specimens were tested for all adult patients. For children, only buffy coat fractions were tested because there was insufficient whole blood/serum to be tested. If an adult patient tested positive for the O. tsutsugamushi or Rickettsia assay in whole blood or buffy coat, the corresponding serum *Address correspondence to Wanitda Watthanaworawit, Shoklo Malaria Research Unit, 68/30 Ban Toong Road, Mae Sot, Tak 63110, Thailand. E-mail: wanitda@tropmedres.ac specimen was then also tested. The PCR was repeated for specimens yielding uncertain results (discordant results between duplicate reactions) on first testing. For comparison, three alternate rickettsial real-time PCR assays were run on buffy coat specimens, using the same DNA extracts as for the JBAIDS-based PCRs. These PCRs targeted 47-kDa outer membrane protein gene of O. tsutsugamushi, 6 17-kDa antigen gene of Rickettsia spp., 7 and R. typhi ompB, 8 as previously described. A human RNaseP gene PCR was used as an internal control to confirm the absence of PCR inhibition and to monitor extraction efficiency. 9 One microliter of DNA template was added into each 25 μL PCR reaction. The PCR was done on an ABI 7500 Fast instrument (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). All statistical data analyses were perform using STATA/SE 10.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Diagnostic accuracy of the PCRs was calculated by comparing PCR results to the paired sera IFA results in 2 + 2 cross tabulation using the "diagt" routine. 10 The McNemar test was used to compare test sensitivities. Binomial exact confidence intervals were calculated throughout.
