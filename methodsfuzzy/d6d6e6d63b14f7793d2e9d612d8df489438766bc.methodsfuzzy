We administered a survey to the participants, consisting of 14 open-ended questions (Table 1) . These questions were aimed at identifying the participant's pre-existing job title at NCKUH, confirming the participant's occupation of a HEICS leadership position during the SARS outbreak, and characterizing the organization, structure, and function of the HEICS units and subunits the participant led and the job actions performed during the SARS outbreak. We based our survey on published recommendations for evaluating hospital disaster response and on previous studies that used structured interview methodology to characterize disaster response (27) (28) (29) (30) .
