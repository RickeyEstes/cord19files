Cell culture and generation of IFITM-expressing cell lines. Human-derived A549 cells (CCL-185; ATCC) were grown in F-12 medium (Life Technologies) and human HEK293T (CRL-1573; ATCC) and chicken DF-1 (CRL-12203; ATCC) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies); all media were supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biosera). Chicken and human IFITM gene sequences were synthesized (GeneArt; Life Technolo-gies) as codon-optimized genes for expression in human cells, and chicken IFITMs were also synthesized for optimal expression in chicken cells. All IFITM genes were cloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of the lentivirus vector, pSIN-BNHA (20) , and sequences confirmed by capillary sequencing (GATC Biotech). The gene cassette was cloned into pSIN-BNHA, to ensure that a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag followed the IFITM protein. Lentivirus vector stocks were made by a three-plasmid transfection of HEK293T cells, grown to confluence in a 10-cm dish. Briefly, 200 l of Opti-MEM (Gibco) was mixed with 10 l of Fugene-6 (Roche) before addition of 1 g of a gag-pol-expressing vector (p8.91), 1 g of a vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)-expressing vector (pMDG), and 1.5 g of vector expressing the transgene (pSIN-BNHA) and incubated for 15 min. The medium was removed from the cells and replaced with 8 ml of DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and the DNA mixture was added dropwise to the cells. After 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO 2 , the medium was removed and replaced with 8 ml DMEM plus 10% FBS and incubated for a further 24 h. Packaged lentivirus vector was harvested 48 and 72 h after transfection by collecting the supernatant and being filtered through a 0.45-m-pore filter (Millex). The lentiviruses were used to transduce human A549 lung epithelial cells and produce a mixed population from which single cell clones were derived by limiting dilution. Expression of IFITMs was detected by HA flow cytometric analysis. Confocal microscopy. Cells were seeded at 1 ϫ 10 5 /well on coverslips in a 12-well plate 1 day prior to transfection with an IFITM-encoding plasmid (1 g DNA with 3 l of Fugene [Promega]). Cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 10 min followed by being blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min. The HA epitope was targeted by an anti-HA antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 550 (ab117513), and endosomes were visualized by a Lamp1 antibody with human (ab25630; Abcam) or chicken (LEP100 IgG; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) specificity, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (ab96871; Abcam). Flow cytometric analysis. Transfected cells were harvested using 300 l 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies), neutralized with 300 l of cell culture medium plus 10% FBS, and pooled with the supernatant. The cells were spun at 2,000 ϫ g for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 l PBS and transferred to a 96-well V-bottomed plate (Nunc). The plate was centrifuged, and the cells were fixed and permeabilized in 100 l of Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer (Becton, Dickinson) and washed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The cells were resuspended with the anti-HA antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (A190-108F; Cambridge Bioscience) and incubated for 1 h at 4°C, followed by two rounds of washing. IAV replication was detected by antinucleoprotein (anti-NP) antibody (ab128193; Abcam) followed by incubation with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 650 (ab96882; Abcam). Cells were resuspended in 300 l of PBS before analysis by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur II; Becton, Dickinson).
