The medical records of all horses that were presented to the Washington State UniversityeVeterinary Teaching Hospital (WSU-VTH) from 2010 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed for this descriptive study. Horses were included in the study if they were older than 1 year, had clinical signs consistent with colitis, tested positive for ECoV using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and tested negative for other common enteric pathogens. Individual data collected included admission signalment, presenting complaint as defined by the owner, referring veterinarian or both, clinical signs, and blood work. Season was allocated based on the month at presentation: winter (DecembereFebruary), spring (MarcheMay), summer (JuneeAugust), and fall (Septem-bereNovember). Clinical signs recorded included heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, and fecal consistency (normal, soft, and diarrhea). Hematological (white blood cells count, band and mature neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, red blood cells count, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, fibrinogen, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red blood distribution width, and platelets) and biochemical parameters (lactate, gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, phosphorus, total bilirubin, sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, and anion gap) for each case were also recorded. Lactate measurements were performed using a stall side analyzer (Lactate Plus Nova; Medical Innovation House, Runcorn, Cheshire, UK). All blood work was performed on site (Clinical Pathology Laboratory, WSU-VTH) at or within 24 hours of patient admission, and all blood smears were reviewed by a board-certified clinical pathologist. Transabdominal ultrasound (MyLabAlpha; Esaote, Indianapolis, IN) findings, treatments administered, secondary complications, days of hospitalization, final diagnostics and outcome were also included. Fecal samples were shipped refrigerated immediately after collection, to the RT-PCR Research and Diagnostic Core facilities, at the University of California (Davis, CA), for RT-PCR panel testing, that included Equine Coronavirus, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile, genes encoding toxin A and B), Lawsonia intracellularis, Neorickettsia risticii, and Salmonella spp. Bacterial culture (Salmonella spp, C. difficile, and Clostridium perfringens) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (C. difficile TOX A/B II; Techlab, Blacksburg, VA) -on fecal samples were performed at the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (Pullman, WA). A case was classified as ECoV positive if at least one fecal RT-PCR was positive for ECoV and the other enteric pathogens tested were excluded. An outbreak, for the purpose of this study, was defined as two or more horses clinically affected by ECoV on the same premises.
