Poultry production and husbandry methods in developing countries such as Africa is largely dominated by backyard, traditional, or household poultry; representing about 80% of poultry stocks and can be intensive, semi-intensive, or extensive [67] [68] [69] . This type of poultry production in African countries often consist of free indigenous breeds, with various species mixed in the same flock [68, [70] [71] [72] . Poultry closely mingles with humans in the same household as well as with wild birds and other livestock where they are also exposed to vermin. More often than not backyard poultry is characterized by small poultry population with poor biosecurity measures. Biosecurity is considered as an indispensable tool to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases thereby improving the health status [36, [73] [74] [75] [76] . Poor or lack of disease control strategies and inadequate management practices result in high levels of mortality due to infectious diseases. This could easily have been averted if poultry disease management which involves taking steps to ensure good hygiene. Furthermore, increasing the standards of cleanliness as well as containment when applied reduces or prevent the risk of introducing disease into a flock and hence mortality [67, [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] . A recent study conducted by Arafa et al. [82] and Arafa et al. [83] showed that epidemiological dynamics of HPAI has changed with the origins of majority of outbreaks. This points toward household poultry, and it is associated with human cases of H5N1 infections. The rearing of multispecies of poultry (duck, turkey, pigeon, quail, and chicken) and other livestock is done in the same compound with human habitations under very poor biosecurity measures is a common practice in most countries of Africa, especially Nigeria and Egypt. Operating under such poultry production setting creates an avenue for the perpetuation of already existing HPAI viral subtypes. This provides an opportunity for reassortment for the formation of Novel and new subtypes and sublineages of HPAI in Africa. A similar scenario played out recently in Europe, specifically France, from December 2015 to date. A total of 81 outbreaks of HPAI were recorded mainly in extensively reared duck farms, initially harboring LPAI viruses. However, due to very poor biosecurity measures and multispecies rearing, these viruses eventually reassorted and within the spate of few months generated three HPAI subtypes (H5N1, H5N2, and H5N9). These eventually spread to commercial layer farms, killing millions of chickens, and ducks [43, 84, 85] . OIE [51] . *H9N2 may not be classified as HPAI, but it is endemic in Egypt [52] .
