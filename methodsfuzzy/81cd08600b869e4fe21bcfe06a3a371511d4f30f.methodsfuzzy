siRNA-loaded PLGA NS were prepared by the emulsion solvent diffusion method in water [15] . First, to prepare siRNA/DOTAP complexes, 50 ll of Milli-Q water containing 300 lg of siRNA was added to the same volume of Milli-Q water containing 300 lg of DOTAP solution with stirring. The PLGA (50 mg) and siR-NA/DOTAP complex solution was dissolved in acetone (2 ml). For the preparation of fluorescence-labeled PLGA NS, 100 lg of 6-coumarin was added to this organic solution, which dissolved both PLGA and siRNA. The resultant organic solution was poured into 25 ml of an aqueous PVA solution (2%, w/v) and stirred at 400 rpm using a propeller-type agitator with three blades. The entire dispersed system was then centrifuged (43,400g for 10 min) and resuspended in Milli-Q water (10 ml). The same volume of mannitol solution (5%, w/v) as a cryoprotectant was added to the NS suspension. The resultant dispersion was dried by freeze drying. For the preparation of CS-modified PLGA NS, chitosan (0.05%, w/v, in 0.5 M acetate buffer, pH 4.4)-PVA (1%, w/v, in distilled water) mixed solution was used as the dispersing phase for the emulsion solvent diffusion process.
