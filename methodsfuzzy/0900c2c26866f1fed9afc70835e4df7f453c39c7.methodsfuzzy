This section describes the empirical model used to examine the effect of the Wenchuan earthquake on prices of new apartments located in different floor levels. We follow a hedonic approach to evaluate average and dynamic patterns of relative housing prices after the earthquake, as compared to prior to the tremor. We are particularly interested in examining whether apartment units in lower floors exhibited a different pricing behavior than units in upper floors after the earthquake, and assess whether these relative price differences are in line with a potential overreaction of consumers in terms of an excessive fear of heights after an extreme natural event. We first estimate the following log-linear price equation, where p ijt is the price per square meter of apartment unit i located in building j and purchased at day t; Quake t is a dummy variable equal to one if the transaction occurred after the earthquake; Floor12 i and Floor36 i are dummy variables indicating whether the apartment is located in floors 1-2 and 3-6 respectively (floors 7 or above is the base category); andX i is a vector of apartment unit controls such as apartment size (in square meters). 19 We specify the error term to have a building effect κ j common to all units in the same building, a time effect η t representing common shocks to Chengdu's market, and a white noise error ɛ ijt . The building fixed effects account for all characteristics shared by units in the same building such as the quality of the building structure, the reputation of the developer (constructor), property amenities and location attributes, while a time trend (and its squared) capture overall economic and housing trends in Chengdu during the period of our study. 20 We also include the housing price index obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics to control for the national real estate market trend and dummy variables to account for the housing subsidy period and variations in the policy by unit size, which was implemented by the city government after the earthquake to help displaced people. 21 We then estimate a second log-linear price equation given by, where QuakeM St , s = 0, ..., 12, are dummy variables for 30-days windows after the earthquake. We refer to Eq. (1) as the average-effect model, which permits to assess average changes in relative prices of units located in lower versus upper floors. Parameters β 4 and β 5 capture variations after the 19 Unfortunately, we do not have additional information on unit attributes, like number of bedrooms/bathrooms or balconies, although apartment unit plans in China are relatively more homogenous than in other countries (Kong, Wu and Ma, 2008) . Similarly, there are very small differences between units in the same building (Guo et al., 2014) . 20 The results are not sensitive to using district by quarter fixed effects, district specific time trends or (annual) socioeconomic characteristics by district such as per capita disposable income and population density. 21 The subsidies started on June 2008 and ended on December 2009. The amount of the subsidy depended on the size of the housing unit: 1.5% of the sale price for units of 90 square meters or less; 1% for units between 91 and 144 square meters; and 0.5% for units between 145 and 180 square meters. earthquake in the price of units located in floors 1-2 and 3-6 relative to units located in floors 7 or above. Eq. (2) is the dynamic-effect model that allows us to analyze the progression of relative prices over the months following the tremor. The parameters of interest in this case areβ S4 and β S5 , s = 0, ..., 12. We also estimate below a more flexible model that permits to recover the evolution of relative prices over the entire period of analysis. Table 2 reports the estimation results of the average-effect model. The first two columns show the results using the full sample while the other two columns show the results for the West and East of Chengdu. In column (1) we measure the unit floor using an ordered variable from one to 36 and in columns (2)-(4) we use categorical variables to distinguish units in floors 1-2 and 3-6 (floors 7 or above is the base category). Building fixed effects and the trend terms are omitted for ease of presentation. The reported standard errors are robust and clustered at the district level.
