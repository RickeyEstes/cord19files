Recombinant protein T16 consists of 16 tandem repeats of the triple-helix fragment of hCOL3A1, Gly483-Pro512. Briefly, the DNA fragment of T16 was synthesized (Genewiz, China) and inserted into the commercially available expression plasmid pET32a(Ã¾). The resulting recombinant expression vectors were transformed into BL21 (DE3). After induced by IPTG (isopropylthio-b-galactoside), the expressed protein was purified with Nickel-chelate chromatography.
