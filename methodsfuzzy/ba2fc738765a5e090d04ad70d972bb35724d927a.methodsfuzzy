Samples collection (Table 1) was performed under the approval of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands (''Terres Australes et Antartiques Fran√ßaises''), administrator of Europa and Tromelin islands. Blood samples were collected from the brachial vein and stored in Longmire lysis buffer [12] . For samples collected on Europa in 2011, however, samples were stored in RNA NOW (BIOGENTEX, Seabrook, Texas, USA) since the primary purpose of sample collection was the detection of RNA viruses (Lebarbenchon et al. unpublished data). RNA extraction was performed with the QIAamp RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), except for samples conserved in RNA NOW that were extracted following the RNA NOW isolation and purification protocol. Samples were eluted in a final volume of 40 mL and reverse-transcription was performed on 20 mL of RNA product using a previously published protocol [13] . Hippoboscid flies were collected during bird handling for blood collection and stored individually in 70% ethanol. Because of the presence of sporozoites in the salivary glands (located in the thorax) and in order to limit detection of parasites in the digestive system, thoraxes were carefully separated and DNA was extracted using the DNEasy Blood and Tissue DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and eluted in a final volume of 40 mL. Semi-nested polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were used to detect the presence of Haemoproteus and Plasmodium genera in blood and fly samples [14] . Specifically, PCR targeting the mitochondrial Cytochrome b gene (479 bp) were performed with the HAEMNF1 and HAEMNR3 primers followed by an internal PCR with the HAEMNF1 and HAEMR2 primers as previously described [14] . The Go Taq Hot Start Green Master Mix (Promega Corporation, Madison, USA) was used in a final volume of 25 mL containing 5 mL of cDNA for the first amplification and 1 mL of the primary PCR for the second amplification. PCR conditions were used as in Hellgren et al. [14] , except the number of cycles that was increased to 30 and 40 for the primary and secondary PCR, respectively. PCR were carried out in a BIO-RAD CFX96 Touch PCR system (BIO-RAD, Hercules, California, USA). Finally, partial Cytochrome Oxidase I encoding gene (698 bp) was amplified and sequenced to determine the putative species of nine Hippoboscid flies, as described in Folmer et al. [15] . PCR were carried out in a BIO-RAD CFX96 Touch PCR system. All amplification products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel stained with 0.4% GelRed (Biotum, Hayward, California, USA) and sequenced by Genoscreen (Lille, France). Partial Cytochrome b (for parasites) and Cytochrome Oxidase I (for Hippoboscid flies) gene sequences were aligned using CLC 6.0.1. (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Maximum likelihood analyses were performed with the software PhyML 3.0 [16] . Nucleotide substitution models were selected with Model Generator 0.85 [17] and nodal supports assessed with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Nucleotide sequences generated in this study were deposited in Genbank under accession numbers KF725664 to KF725686. Blood films were collected for the 30 frigatebirds we sampled in 2012 on Europa (Table 1) . These films were fixed in absolute methanol in the field, stained with Giemsa back in the laboratory, and examined at high magnification (x1000) in order to assess the number of parasites per at least 10000 red blood cells [5, 18] . A Euromex Oxion microscope (Euromex Microscopen BV, Arnhem, The Netherlands) was used to examine slides. Statistical analyses were performed with the R.3.0.0 [19] software in order to compare infection rates between chicks and adults (Chi-squared test) and to detect a potential relationship between age of chicks (based on flattened wing measurements) and their parasitic status (Student's t-test).
