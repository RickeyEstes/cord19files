All reagents and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA) and Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, USA). All experiments involving moisture-sensitive compounds were carried out in an argon atmosphere. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on precoated silica gel F 254 thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (E, Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) with visualization under UV light. The final products were purified by preparative medium-pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) (Biotage Isolera One instrument) on a silica column (Biotage SNAP HP-Sil) spectrometer (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses were performed using a Bruker 400 (400 MHz for 1 H; 100 MHz for 13 C) spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany). The chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (δ). The deuterium lock signal of the sample solvent was used as a reference, and the coupling constants (J) are given in hertz (Hz). The splitting pattern abbreviations are as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; dd, doublet of doublets; and m, multiplet. The purity of all tested compounds was confirmed to be higher than 95% by analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis performed with a dual-pump Shimadzu LC-6AD system equipped with a VP-ODS C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 µm, Shimadzu).
