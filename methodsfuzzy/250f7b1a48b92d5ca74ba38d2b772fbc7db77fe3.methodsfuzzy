The strain of SLE virus used was TBH-28, a standard laboratory strain that had previously been passaged seven times intracerebrally in suckling mice; it had an infectivity titer of lo9 LD,dml when titrated in suckling mice by intracerebral inoculation. Eight litters of 4-day-old Syrian hamsters (LAK-LVG, Lakeview Hamster Colony, Charles River Co., Newfield, N.J.) were inoculated subcutaneously in the hip with 103 LD,, of virus. Animals were anesthetized on the fifth day after inoculation when first signs of illness appeared or on the sixth day when they were moribund, and organs and tissues were excised and prepared for examination by immunofluorescent, light, and electron microscopy. Light microscopic observations were of little help in identifying major extraneural target organs and tissues in the clinically ill and moribund hamsters, but frozen-section immunofluorescence of all organ systems indicated significant virus growth in the pancreas, adrenal gland, small intestine, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Specimens from these organs/tissues were, therefore, selected for electron microscopic examination. Blocks, approximately 1 mm3 in size, were taken from each organ/tissue specimen and fixed in 2.5% phosphate-buffered gluteraldehyde for 1 hr. The tissues were then posttixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded concentrations of alcohol, and embedded in a mixture of Epon and Araldite (Mollenhauer, 1964) . Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and were examined in Philips 200 and 300 electron microscopes.
