The general procedure of plasma preparation for 2-DE analysis is shown in Fig. 1 . This procedure involves plasma collection, the depletion of high-abundant plasma proteins, the removal of contaminants that may interfere with 2-DE analysis, and the solubilization of proteins.  The affinity-based methods are predicated on the affinity of albumin for Cibracon Blue (CB) and associated dyes [52, 56, 57, 59] . CB dye has not been used expressly for bind-ing albumin, but also for the binding of NAD, FAD, and ATP binding sites of proteins, via ionic and hydrophobic interactions, which allows CB dye to bind to a large number of other proteins, resulting in the potential loss of other proteins [52, 53] . This non-specific binding probably includes both proteins that bind to the dye as well as some minor proteins that bind albumin [59, 67] . Despite this high degree of non-specific protein binding, this method has several advantages, including high-loading capacity and low cost [65] . Due to their relatively low cost, they are disposable, which prevents any cross-contamination between different samples [66] . Generally, IgG removal is commonly achieved by the immobilization of protein A or protein G onto the affinity resins, which bind to the Fc region of the IgG [51, 53] . However, Proteins A and G may not bind to all of the immunoglobulin subgroups, thereby leaving a portion of these heterogeneous abundant proteins behind. Other methods involve the use of a proprietary polypeptide affinity matrix and a peptide-based affinity medium that removes albumin [51] [52] [53] . The peptide with modified sequences of the Fc region was produced by protein engineering in an effort to increase albumin binding capacity, which has been employed for the depletion of abundant proteins from plasma [51] . The advantages of these peptide-based ligands include low cost, reproducibility, sterilizability, a completely defined product, and nonbiological origin. Another depletion method involves the use of a centrifugal ultrafiltration device for the separation of proteins by size. The effectiveness of this approach, however, has been reported to be limited [59, 61] . As ultrafiltration membranes have a normal pore-size that represents the average of a normal distribution of smaller and larger pores, it is somewhat common to observe suboptimal retention rates particularly for high concentrations, as in serum samples [61] , thereby highlighting the limitations in reproducibility. Antibody-based depletion methods have recently been developed and described by many researchers [47, 49, 50, 60, [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] . Individual antibody methods have proven more specific in the depletion of targeted proteins, and resulted in a more complete removal of abundant proteins [48, 49, 51, 60] . Monoclonal antibodies appear to represent a promising option for the depletion of high-abundant proteins, and have been used to target a specific epitope of these proteins, thereby resulting in the removal of the targeted proteins. However, this technique may not be appropriate for the recognition of all forms of the targeted protein, due to the presence of proteolytic fragments, post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as glycosylation, phosporylation, the disruption of the antigen-binding site in partially or completely unfolded proteins, or the occlusion of the epitope as the result of protein-protein interactions [48] . Polyclonal antibodies, on the other hands, are more likely to deplete multiple structural forms of a protein. They are desirable for the depletion of as many high-abundant proteins as possible, while minimizing the incidental losses of nontargeted proteins. Recently, the depletion systems using several polyclonal antibodies with high specificity have been developed, which can remove multiple proteins simultaneously, in a rapid and efficient manner [50, [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] : immunodepletion systems based on IgG and IgY antibodies [48, 50, [62] [63] [64] [65] . The relative popularity of these methods may be resultant from this polyclonality of the immunoglobin ligands. The immunodepletion system based on IgG is capable of simultaneously removing six of the most abundant proteins in human plasma, albumin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), haptoglobin, transferrin, and alpha-1antitrypsin, using high-specificity rabbit polyclonal antibodies. This method is capable of the depletion of high-abundant proteins, including different molecular forms and many proteolytic products of these proteins, coupled with low nonspecific losses of other proteins, rapidly and efficiently, in a single purification step [50, 58, 62, 65, 66 ]. An immunodepletion system based on IgY employed chicken antibodies, which orient the antibody with the antigen-binding site facing outward, with a constant portion of the antibodies covalently coupled to a solid phase material. This permits maximum antigen binding efficiency. This system also allows for the depletion of human albumin, IgG, IgA, IgM, fibrinogen, and the transferrin, and depletion of albumin in a variety of mammalian species [64] . The principal disadvantages of antibody-based depletion include its relatively high cost and low sample capacity. Fortunately, antibodies are highly robust proteins, it appears likely that such systems will last for many purification cycles if appropriate care is taken to minimize both proteolysis and column clogging. Multicomponent immunoaffinity columns have recently become commercially available [54] . Although these commercial kits are relatively expensive, they are also quite convenient and useful for small samples, such as those that can be applied to electrophoretic gels. With regard to format, approaches for the depletion of albumin or high-abundant proteins, using spin-column format and chromatography format, have been previously utilized. In the spin-column format, the reagent can be regenerated many times to deplete the same sample or multiple samples after proper column washing. In addition, the polyclonal antibody resin also functions effectively in a spin column format, which allows for the parallel processing of multiple samples or aliquots and requires no complex instrumentation. The liquid chromatography column format is also amenable to automation on a high-throughput scale. In order to analyze the clinical samples, speed and reproducibility are crucial for the accumulation of statistically reliable information. Depletion is one method that allows the screening of lowabundant proteins in plasma, but depletion can also result in a risk of losing proteins of interest other than those specifically targeted for depletion. As albumin is a plasma transport protein that binds with a large number of compounds (including hormones, cytokines, lipoproteins, and amino acids) [68] , its removal from plasma may also result in the removal of lowabundant proteins. Attempts to recover low abundant proteins from an immunoaffinity column have previously involved the use of a mild solvent, salt-out preparation, molecular sieve filtration, and a peptide-based affinity medium [49, 51, 69, 70 ].
