The plasmid used for mutagenesis was a derivative of pASK30 with an insert coding for an amino-terminal methionine followed by residues 109 to 666 of P22 tailspike protein, i.e., for the tailspike protein lacking its amino-terminal head-binding domain (Danner et al., 1993) . Lipopolysaccharide fragments from Salmonella thyphimurium SH4809, serogroup B, 0-antigen 4,5,12; and S. enteritidis SH1262, serogroup DI, 0-antigen 9,12 were purified as described (Eriksson et al., 1979) . The strains were from the strain collection at the Division of Clinical Bacteriology, Huddinge University Hospital. The 05 antigen is lost during the process of oligosaccharide preparation. Oligosaccharides were characterized as described by Weintraub et al. (1988) and were quantified by their dry weights. Unless indicated otherwise, S. enteritidis oligosaccharides were used in the experiments. 7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin (Amc) and NaCNBH3 were obtained from Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany), acetonitrile was from J. T. Baker (Deventer, England), and maltoheptaose was from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). Other chemicals were analysis grade, and quartz bidistilled water was used throughout. Site-directed mutagenesis, protein expression, and purification Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out essentially as described by Kunkel et al. (1987) , with slight variations (Yuckenberg et al., 1991) . Expression and purification of amino-terminally shortened tailspike proteins were done as described for the wild-type protein (Steinbacher et al., 1994; Miller, 1995) . Their concentrations were determined using a specific absorbance at 278 nm of AIBg/ltlll = 1.1 1 (Danner et al., 1993) . Purified protein was stored as a suspension in 40% saturated (NH4)2SO4, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0.
