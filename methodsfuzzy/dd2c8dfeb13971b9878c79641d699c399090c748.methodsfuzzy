We performed a small-scale validity study on our case-finding procedures. We tested the validity of our system by reviewing the complete medical charts of 99 patients who did not have any relevant ICD-9 codes and obtained their records from the microbiological dataset on or before December 31, 2010 (end of the study period). We examined the reliability of our case-finding procedure by randomly selecting 20 records of potential cases having them reviewed independently by 2 infectious-disease specialists (C.C.H. and C.Y.J.). Finally, we increased the reliability of our diagnoses, by having the infectious-disease specialist assess (C.C.H.) all cases judged to be problematic. The panel accepted 80 diagnoses (95%) out of the 84 cases examined, and rejected 4.
