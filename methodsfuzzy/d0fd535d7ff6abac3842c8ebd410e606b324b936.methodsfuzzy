Tracy L. Hartman, Robert W. Buckheit Jr. ImQuest BioSciences, Inc., Frederick, MA, USA The rapid selection of drug-resistant virus strains in HIVinfected patients during antiviral therapy is a primary reason for treatment failure with both nucleoside and nonnucleoside RT inhibitors. Although resistance would appear to be a detrimental outcome of antiviral therapy, it may be possible to select for resistant viruses with reduced replication capacity and/or fitness. Resistance-engendering mutations may yield beneficial therapeutic effects if the selected mutations cause reductions in the rate and/or extent of virus replication. Reduced virus replication may effectively prolong the interval between initial HIV infection and AIDS, allow the immune system to more effectively deal with the virus, and allow more effective therapeutic intervention with other HIV inhibitory agents. Our laboratory has developed assays which allow us to evaluate the relative rate of resistance selection between antiviral compounds, and to compare wild-type and resistant virus strains with regard to their replication kinetics and capacity and their relative fitness, as well as identifying the potential contribution of compensatory changes in the virus which result in enhanced replication of low fitness viruses. These assays employ NL4-3 virus with specific amino acid changes introduced into the reverse transcriptase or protease by site directed mutagenesis. Using competitive viral replication assays, we have shown that virus containing point mutations that confer resistance to nucleoside and nonnucleoside RT inhibitors and protease inhibitors may exhibit reduced or increased rates and extents of virus replication or may exhibit no change in replication. The relative growth potential of the mutant virus was also compared to wild-type virus in the absence and presence of drug selective pressure. The assay compares relative replication capacity in both CEM-SS cells and fresh human primary mononuclear cells. These results demonstrated that drug-induced single and multiple mutations in the reverse transcriptase and protease have both positive and negative effects on the ability of HIV to replicate in human cells. Further evaluation of each mutation, alone or in combination, may prove valuable in designing therapeutic strategies for HIV-infected patients. Cyanovirin-N (CV-N) is an 11 kDa protein with potent anti-HIV activity. CV-N was originally discovered in and purified from extracts of the cyanobacterium (blue-green alga) Nostoc ellipsosporum. It has been reported that CV-N is extremely resistant to methods used for physicochemical degradation. CV-N can withstand treatments with denaturants, detergents, organic solvents, and extreme temperatures without significant loss of antiviral activity. Low nanomolar concentrations of CV-N inhibit the replication of all clinical HIV strains evaluated and laboratory strains of HIV-2, SIV and FIV. Moreover, CV-N is active against all subtypes of HIV-1. CV-N binds irreversibly to the HIV surface envelope glyco-protein gp120, specifically interacting with the high mannose groups. This binding blocks interactions between gp120 and receptors on various target cells, leading to inhibition of attachment and fusion of the virus particle to the target cell. We have expressed recombinant CV-N as inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of E. coli, resulting in monomeric CV-N which binds to gp120 with nanomolar affinity and retains its potent anti-HIV activities in cell-based assays. We have evaluated the antiviral activity of a variety of excipients, alone and in combination with recombinant CV-N, as well as the in vitro activity of formulated drug product. Specifically, recombinant CV-N was formulated in hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) or a co-polymer and tested in Depo-provera-treated Chinese rhesus macaques. In animals treated with 0.5% CV-N in HEC, no infections were noted up to 4 weeks post-infection as measured by plasma viral RNA. The results suggest that CV-N formulated gel will be an effective vaginal microbicide. In addition, HEC placebo gel was analyzed for in vitro and in vivo effects on safety and efficacy, demonstrating appropriate physical properties, stability as a vaginal gel formulation, and safety for use in the clinical study of investigational microbicides. Finally, the unique properties of CV-N and its potent inactivation of HIV make this protein relevant for development as a vaginal anti-HIV microbicide. Advanced preclinical development is underway. To prove that new series of 5 -mononucleotide analogues can act as effective pronucleotides, their decomposition pathway were studied in cell extracts. Thus, we developed and validated a simple and rapid method by highperformance liquid chromatography for the simultaneous quantification of zidovudine (AZT) and its monophosphate (AZTMP). Without pretreatment, biological samples could directly be injected on an analytical system. Using an ion-pair agent, AZT, AZTMP and an internal standard (IS) were trapped on the cleaning precolumn and the proteins quickly eluted. Thereafter, the precolumn was connected to a reverse-phase analytical column where analytes were separated, and detected using UV detection at 266 nm. This method was validated over the range of 5-125 g/ml for AZT and AZTMP. Extraction recoveries of the analytes and IS from cells extracts were higher than 95%. This method is currently used to study the decomposition pathway of AZT prodrugs in cell extracts. Among the cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) of small animals, the guinea pig CMV (GPCMV) is of interest for antiviral research, due to a similar disease pathogenesis to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), including transplacental transmission. Unfortunately, GPCMV is resistant to the most commonly used HCMV antiviral, ganciclovir (GCV), rendering in vivo study of this agent problematic in this animal model. Using the GPCMV genome cloned as an infectious bacterial artificial chromosome in E. coli, we used an inducible recombination system to engineer a series of mutant GPCMVs, including a virus deleted of the GPCMV UL97 (GP97) homolog, and viruses which replaced the native GP97 gene with the HCMV (Towne strain) UL97 gene. These studies demonstrated that a GP97 deletion virus retained replication competence, but was severely attenuated for in vitro replication. Two chimeric viruses which replaced the GP97 gene with the HCMV UL97, in contrast, replicated efficiently in cell culture. Evaluation of the GCV susceptibility profile of wild-type and mutant GPCMVs revealed that replacement of the GP97 with HCMV UL97 resulted in substantially improved susceptibility of the chimeric virus to the inhibitory effect of GCV. Plaque reduction assays revealed that the IC 50 for wild-type (BAC-derived) GPCMV for GCV was approximately 200 M. In contrast, two independently derived chimeric GPCMVs which expressed HCMV UL97 were GCV-susceptible, demonstrating an IC 50 of 15 M. Northern blot, using HCMV UL97-specific probes, was performed. These probes hybridized with RNA purified from reconstituted chimeric viruses, but not wild-type BAC virus. These studies demonstrate the usefulness of employing recombination systems in E. coli to generate BAC-derived chimeric GPCMVs expressing HCMV genes. The improved GCV susceptibility profile of the recombinant GPCMV should facilitate the testing of GCV, and, potentially, other antivirals which target UL97, in this uniquely useful small animal model. Human herpes viruses cause a variety of clinically significant diseases: HSV-1 (cold sores), HSV-2 (genital herpes), VZV (chicken pox, shingles), and HCMV (retinitis, pneumonitis). The current treatment of these diseases uses nucleoside (acyclovir, ganciclovir, cidofovir) and phosphate (PFA) substrate analogues. Because of the toxicity associated with PFA and ganciclovir, together with the emergence of mutants resistant to acyclovir, there is a need for a new class of antiherpes compounds with novel mechanism of action.
