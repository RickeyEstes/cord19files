Prediction of the RNA Secondary Structure: CROSS Secondary structure profiles were generated using CROSS (Delli Ponti et al., 2017) . CROSS models have been previously trained on data from high-throughput experiments [PARS: yeast and human transcriptomes (Kertesz et al., 2010; Wan et al., 2014) and icSHAPE: mouse transcriptome (Spitale et al., 2015) ] as well as on low-throughput SHAPE (Watts et al., 2009) and high-quality NMR/X-ray data (Andronescu et al., 2008) . The consensus model Global Score was trained and tested on independent sets of NMR/X-ray structures [11,670 training fragments, 5,475 testing fragments (Wu et al., 2015; Lorenz et al., 2016) , see https://github.com/stanti/shapebenchmark/ tree/master/benchmarkdata]. In the testing phase, single and double-stranded nucleotides were recognized with an AUC of 0.72 and a PPV of 0.74. Comparison with experimental SHAPE data shows similar performances (AUC of 0.76 and PPV of 0.76; see http://service.tartaglialab.com/static_files/algorithms/ cross/documentation.html#5) and the details are reported in our previous publication (Delli Ponti et al., 2017) . In addition, as done with experimental SHAPE data, Global Score has been also used as a constraint in RNAstructure (Mathews et al., 1999; Reuter and Mathews, 2010) . On the test set (Lorenz et al., 2016) , Global Score was shown to increase the PPV of RNAstructure from 0.68 to 0.72, with remarkable improvements in 13 cases (from 0.44 to 0.72) and decreases the PPV in only three cases for which real SHAPE data does not improve performances. Moreover, using the partition function computed with RNAstructure, we previously calculated the AUC for each structure with and without CROSS constraints and observed an improvement from 0.81 to 0.86 when CROSS is integrated in the algorithm. We observed a similar trend using RNAfold (Lorenz et al., 2016) (the PPV increases from 0.67 to 0.70 using Global Score and the AUC remains at 0.85). In the present study all the profiles were computed using the Global Score module: nucleotides with a score higher than 0 are predicted to be double-stranded and structured, while nucleotides with a score lower than 0 are single-stranded. Since the algorithm has no sequence length restriction and shows strong performances on both coding and non-coding RNAs (Delli Ponti et al., 2017) it was combined with DTW for pairwise comparison of structural profiles.
