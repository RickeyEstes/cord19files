The oligosaccharide-binding activity of KAA-2 was determined using a centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC method as described previously [10] . Briefly, 90 ll of 500 nM KAA-2 in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 10 ll of 300 nM pyridylaminated (PA)-oligosaccharide were mixed and kept at room temperature for 60 min. Subsequently, unreacted PA-oligosaccharides were collected by centrifugation (10,000g, 30 s) using Nanospin Plus (Gelman Sciences, Pensacola, FL). An aliquot of the filtrate was applied to a TSKgel ODS 80TM column (4.6 Ã‚ 150 mm) and unbound PA-oligosaccharide was quantified. The amount of bound PA-oligosaccharide was obtained by subtracting the amount of unbound oligosaccharide from the amount of added oligosaccharide, which was determined from the filtrate of the reaction solution without a lectin. The binding activity (%) was calculated as the ratio of the amount of bound oligosaccharide to that of added oligosaccharide.
