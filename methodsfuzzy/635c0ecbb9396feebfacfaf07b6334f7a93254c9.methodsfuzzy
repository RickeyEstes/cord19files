The following cells were used: FL (amnion) cells (Stephan Angeloff Institute of Microbiology, Sofia, Bulgaria; ATCC No. CCL-62) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (GIBCO BRL, Paisley, Scotland, UK) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10 mmol/L HEPES buffer (VWR International GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) and antibiotics (penicillin, 100 U/mL, streptomycin, 100 mg/mL); BS-C-1 (Cercopithecus monkey kidney) cells ( 13 For poliovirus type 1, stock virus suspensions with an infectious titre !10 8 CCID 50 /mL were centrifuged at low speed and then at 70 000 g (L8, Beckman Instruments, Porterville Plants, CA, USA) for 30 min at C4 8C. The sediment was resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged again at low speed. The clarified supernatant contained a titre of at least 10 8 CCID 50 /mL. For fingerpad experiments, Sabin vaccine strain of poliovirus type 1 (LSc 2ab, ATCC VR-59, kindly provided by the Behringwerke AG, Liederbach, Germany) or the abovementioned strain F9 of FCV was used. The study was performed for poliovirus type 1 according to ASTM standard E-1838-96 18 and for FCV according to ASTM standard E-1838-02. 19 Briefly, 10 mL of virus suspension was placed on a demarcated area on each fingerpad and the inoculum was allowed to dry. The dried inoculum was then exposed to 1 mL of the reference [70% (v/v) ethanol, 70% (v/v) propan-1-ol and 60% (v/v) propan-2-ol] or standard hard water (SHW) or test formulation contained in a glass vial (Serolab, Aidenbach, Germany). The contact time was either 30 or 60 s. For poliovirus testing, tests without soil load were performed, whereas for FCV, a tripartite soil load according to E-1838-02 with bovine serum albumin, mucin and tryptone was included. Virus remaining on fingerpads was eluted with 1 mL Earle's balanced salt solution containing 1% tryptone (FCV without tryptone). Afterwards, virus titre in the eluate was determined directly by endpoint titration (poliovirus titration with GMK-AH 1 cells, FCV titration with KE-R cells) in microtitre plates. The calculation of virus titre for the fingerpad method was performed by the methods of Spearman 20 and KÃ¤rber. 21 Three controls were included to determine: (1) the amount of infectious virus in the inoculum; (2) the infectious virus placed on the two thumbpads without drying; and (3) the infectious virus remaining on fingerpads after drying of the inoculum. The difference in infectious virus in the inoculum control and the dried virus control represents the loss in virus infectivity due to drying of the inoculum. The amount of infectious virus remaining after drying of the inoculum was used as the baseline to determine the extent of virus elimination after treatment with test product or references. We used four randomly selected fingerpads for treatment with test product and two for treatment with references.
