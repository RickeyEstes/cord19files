2.1. Mycoplasma cynos isolates M. cynos isolates cultured from respiratory samples from dogs with moderate to severe respiratory disease were identified from an earlier large study. Isolation and identification of these isolates has been previously described (Chalker et al., 2004) . Briefly, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and trachea samples were obtained from euthanized dogs from a re-homing centre with a history of endemic CIRD (population A). Alternately, BAL samples were taken from dogs with persistent coughs at a training centre (population B). Dogs were graded for respiratory signs prior to sampling or euthanasia. M. cynos was cultured on Mycoplasma media (Mycoplasma Experience) and identified by PCR specific for the 16S/23S rRNA intergenic spacer region. Cultures of the single-cloned M. cynos isolates were stored frozen at Ã€70 8C. The type strain M. cynos H381 NCTC10142 was obtained from the National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC), Collindale, London.
