Cell line and MERS-CoV viruses. African Green monkey kidney-derived Vero E6 cells (ATCC #1568) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) and maintained in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator at 37 °C. MERS-CoV strains used in this study included a human isolate (MERS-CoV/Hu/Taif/SA/2015) and two camel isolates (MERS-CoV/Camel/Taif/SA/31/2016 and MERS-CoV/Camel/Taif/SA/39/2016). MERS-CoV viruses were isolated, passaged and titrated by TCID 50 in Vero E6 cells as previously described 49 . All tested isolates were at passage no. 2. All experiments involving live virus were conducted in our Biosafety level 3 facility following the recommended safety precautions and measures. DNA constructs. Four DNA vaccine candidates were generated as shown in Fig. 1a . Full length MERS-CoV S gene from MERS-CoV-Jeddah-human-1 isolate (GenBank accession number: KF958702) was codon optimized for efficient mammalian expression and synthesized by Bio S & T (Montreal, Canada). The coding sequence was then subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter generating pS construct. The second construct (pS1) expressing S1 domain (aa 1-747) was produced by cloning corresponding coding region by PCR using Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Kit (Life Technologies) from pS plasmid into pcDNA3.1 vector using the following forward 5′ -GATCGCGGCCGCGCCACCATGATCCAC-3′ and reverse 5′ -GATCGGTACCTTACAGAATGAAAAAGACGC-3′ primers. Similarly, pS∆ TM expressing truncated S protein (aa 1-1295) without the transmembrane domain and pS∆ CD expressing truncated S protein (aa 1-1318) without the cytoplasmic domain were generated by PCR subcloning into pcDNA3.1 vector using the above-mentioned forward primer and the following reverse primers; 5′ -GATCGGTACCTTACCACTTGTTGTAGTATG-3′ and 5′ -GATCGGTACCTTACAGAATGAAAAAGACGC-3′ , respectively. All constructs were cloned between NotI and KpnI restriction sites in pcDNA3.1 vector using the T4 DNA ligase. All constructs were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing. Bulk endotoxin-free preparations of all four constructs as well as the empty control plasmid (pcDNA) were prepared for animal studies using a plasmid Giga purification kit (Qiagen). In vitro Protein expression. Prior to animal experiments, protein expression from all DNA constructs was confirmed in vitro in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1b) . Briefly, 80-90% confluent Vero E6 cells in 6-well plates were transiently transfected with 1 μ g of each DNA construct (pS, pS∆ CD, pS∆ TM, pS1, or pcDNA) using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions, followed by incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 incubator for 48 h. Transfected cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with cell lysis buffer as previously described 50 , and subjected to western blot analysis for protein expression using rabbit anti-S1 Abs (Sino Biological). Western blot analysis confirmed that all gene products show bands at expected molecular weights. Notably, the large band that is observed in all blots in Fig. 1b is due to non-specific binding as it was also detected in an un-transfected cell control (data not shown). Animal Studies. Six-to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice were obtained from the core facility in King Fahd Medical Research Center (KFMRC), King Abdulaziz University (KAU). All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines and the approval of the Animal Care and Use Committee at KFMRC. Mice were divided into five experimental groups (5 mice in each group) and immunized on days 0, 14 and 28 with three doses of 100 μ g of each construct dissolved in 100 μ l PBS. Mice were immunized intramuscularly with two injections (50 μ l each) divided between the two thighs. Three weeks after the last doses (day 49), mice were euthanized and blood as well as spleens were collected for immune response analysis. ELISA. The end-point titers of anti-S1 total IgG Ab as well as IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes from immunized mice were determined by ELISA as described previously 29, 50 with minor modifications. Briefly, 96-well plates (EU Immulon 2 HB, Thermo Scientific) were coated with the MERS-CoV S1 protein (Sino Biological) at 2 μ g/ml in PBS at 4 °C overnight. Plates were then washed 6 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T), followed by blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS-T for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, plates were incubated with a 2-fold serial dilution of mouse sera starting from 1:100 and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, plates were washed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG, IgG1, IgG2a or IgG2b secondary Abs (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) at concentrations recommended by the supplier and incubated for additional 1 h at 37 °C. After extensive washing, Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (KPL) was added for 30 min for colorimetric development and the reaction was stopped with 0.16 M sulfuric acid. Absorbance was read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. End-point titers were determined and expressed as the reciprocals of the final detectable dilution with a cut-off defined as the mean of pre-bleed samples plus three SD. Viral microneutralization assay. Microneutralization (MNT) assay was performed as previously described 29, 30 . Briefly, two-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated sera prepared in DMEM starting from a 1:5 dilution were incubated with equal volume of DMEM containing 200 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. The virus-serum mixture was then transferred on confluent Vero E6 cell monolayers in 96-well plates (four wells were used per dilution) and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed on days 3 to determine nAb titer. The nAb titer for each sample is reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that completely protected cells from CPE in 50% of the wells (MNT 50 ). CD8 + T cell intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Memory CD8 + T cell IFN-γ responses were evaluated at 3 weeks after last immunizations as previously described 50 . Briefly, single-cell suspensions of splenocytes were prepared from individual mice in each group. Spleens from mice were collected in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and smashed between frosted ends of two glass slides. Processed splenocytes were then filtered through 45-μ m nylon filters and centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min. Red blood cells were then lysed by adding 5 ml of ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysis buffer (Life Technologies) for 5 min at room temperature, and equal volume of PBS was then added. Cells were centrifuged again and pellets were resuspended in RPMI 1640 at a concentration of 1 × 10 7 cells/ml. Splenocytes were then added to a 96-well plate (1 × 10 6 per well) and re-stimulated with 5 μ g/ml of several synthetic S1 MHC class I-restricted peptides including S291 (KYYSIIPHSI), S319 (QPLTFLLDF), S448 (YPLSMKSDL), S498 (SYINKCSRL), S647 (NYYCLRACV), S703 (TYGPLQTPV), which were synthesized by GenScript as previously described 32 . The stimulation was conducted by incubation for 6 h at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 in the presence of Protein Transport Inhibitor Cocktail (brefeldin A) (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stimulated cells were then washed in FACS buffer and stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen) and anti-mouse CD8α -FITC antibody (clone 53-6.7; eBiosciences). The cells were then washed with FACS buffer, fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm Solution (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and labeled with anti-mouse IFN-γ -APC-Cy7 antibody (clone XMG1.2; BD Biosciences). All data were acquired on a BD FACS Calibur flow cytometer and analysis was completed with Flow Jo, Version 8.8.4 (Tree Star Inc.). Results for IFN-γ producing CD8 + T cells were calculated as percentage of live CD8 + T cells after subtracting the values obtained from no peptide controls from each sample. Data analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVA. Bonferroni post-test was used to adjust for multiple comparisons between the different groups. All statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA). P values < 0.05 were considered significant.
