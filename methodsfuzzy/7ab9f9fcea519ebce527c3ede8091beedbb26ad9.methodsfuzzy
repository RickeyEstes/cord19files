Sequences: Amino acid sequences of the S protein used in the phylogenetic analysis were obtained from The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.10.942185 doi: bioRxiv preprint GenBank, and Bat-SL-RaTG13 (EPI_ISL_402131) was obtained from GISAID data base. Amino acid sequence of the FCoV-TN406 S was provided by Prof. Susan Baker (Loyola University Chicago). Amino acid alignments and phylogenetic trees: Sequences alignments were performed on coronavirus S protein sequences using MAFFT v7.388 (Katoh et al., 2002; Katoh and Standley, 2013) . A Maximum-Likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the S protein alignment was generated using PhyML (Guindon et al., 2010) . Numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap support (100 bootstraps). Sequence alignment display and formatting was performed using Geneious R10 (Biomatters) and phylogenetic tree display and formatting was author/funder. All rights reserved.

The modeled S protein of 2019-nCoV, RaTG13, CoVZC45, CoVCZXC21 and LYRa3 are compared to SARS-CoV S structure. The amino acid homology between the modeled proteins and SARS-CoV S is noted in red and amino acid differences in blue in both models and identity scale. The S amino acid identity between 2019-nCoV and bat-CoVs is also noted (black identity scale).
