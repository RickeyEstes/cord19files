To label mature secretory granule contents with 35SO42six 15-cm dishes of PC12 cells were incubated in sulfate depleted media (with serum) containing 0.167 MCi/ml 35SO42for 12 h . Medium was removed and replaced with normal culture medium for another 12 h incubation . Cells were removed and washed as above, then twice more in PBS. To stimulate The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 117, 1992 release of secretory granule contents, the labeled cells were incubated for 5 min at 37Â°C in DME H21 containing 0 or 12 .5 ag/ml a-latrotoxin (Meldolesi et al ., 1983) . This confirmed that sulfated secretogranin II was stored into regulated secretory granules .
