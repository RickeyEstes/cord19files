This research has involved carrying out a comprehensive synthesis of the expanding literature on airport privatisation. This type of research, that can identify overarching trends or tease out findings that single studies do not produce, is comparatively rare in air transport whilst being much more common with the physical sciences. It has been undertaken here by applying a systematic review of the findings, rather than using more precisely defined metaanalytical techniques that are not suitable given the nature and lack of comparability of the airport research. An extensive range of different publications, such as newspapers and journals, textbooks, government documents, conference papers and theses, industry and other stakeholder policy statements, have considered airport privatisation. However an assessment of the findings and viewpoints of all of these would be overwhelming and lacking in rigour and so the analysis here focused on academic journals. The justification for this was primarily because of the assurance of quality that is guaranteed because of the refereeing process undertaken for the vast majority of the papers. Moreover most of these papers were widely available (usually in electronic format) and the content could easily be searched through an examination of the key word and abstract sections. The journal papers were selected by undertaking a search through Elsevier's Scopus database and the electronic databases of JSTOR, ScienceDirect, Business Source Complete and SwetsWise. Articles were accepted for consideration if there was mention of airport/air transport and privatx, ownerx and governance (where x was a wildcard) in the article title, abstract and key words. 61 papers were selected. Added to this were an additional four papers that did not mention these search words but were clearly related to the topic area. In addition a review of edited books was undertaken and it was decided to include selected papers from 'Aviation Infrastructure Performance' by Winston and de Rus (2008) as these were also refereed and were highly relevant. In total this resulted in 71 papers being considered for this analysis (See Appendix A). Whilst the database search ensured that international papers that conventionally tend to be written in English were identified, a potential drawback was that papers in other languages may have been omitted which in turn may have influenced the geographical coverage of the papers. A start date of 1980 was chosen for the search, seven years before the first ever privatisation in the UK, to take account of any papers produced in the preparation stages of this privatisation. The end date was November 2010although papers 'in press' and to be published later than this were also included (The exception here was with the JSTOR database that does not cover recently published articles). Within this time period the number of selected papers increased significantly coinciding with the growth of airport privatisation worldwide. Before 1996, only one paper was identified. Between Fig. 1 shows the geographical spread of the coverage of the papers. The region that has received the most attention is Europe followed by Asia and Australia/New Zealand. Around a quarter of all papers had a broader or non-specific geographical focus. Fig. 2 presents the research approaches that were adopted by the papers or the main approach used when more than one had been selected. The majority of the studies used secondary information (and in a few cases personal professional experience) to review the strategy and policy implications of privatisation. Around a quarter of the other papers contained some statistical analysis of data ranging from simple ratio or trend analysis to more complex statistical tools such as data envelopment analysis (DEA) or total factor productivity (TFP). The remaining few papers presented theoretical models or discussed primary research findings. The papers were evaluated with the assistance of the software package NVivo 8 which is designed to analyse qualitative information such as written text. Specifically the 'Text Search' and 'Word Frequency' query features, which identify sources for particular text and its frequency of use, were employed at the initial stages of the analysis to help identify key themes and concepts that were then further investigated.
