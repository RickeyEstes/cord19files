For the determination of the LSDV RPA assay analytical sensitivity by the molecular DNA standard, a semi-log regression analysis (PRISM, Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, California) and a probit analysis (STATISTICA, StatSoft, Hamburg, Germany) were performed by plotting the RPA threshold time against the number of molecules detected. Clinical sensitivity and specificity values were calculated using standard formulas.
