We collected data from WHO global and regional databases such as the EMFLU, FluID and FluNet. Information on influenza disease burden was collected from the articles published in peer-reviewed medical journals from the Region. We used the following four outcome indicators to measure improvements in three focus areas of influenza surveillance and esponse: (1) evidence that a country col-lects and reports epidemiological surveillance data; (2) evidence that a country is testing and reporting influenza virus types and subtypes with EMFLU and FluNET; (3) evidence that a country has published influenza disease burden estimation using surveillance data and/or other data or published information; and (4) progress in introducing seasonal influenza vaccines as part of influenza control programme. We further reviewed the progress in each of these four outcome indicators through analysing the influenza surveillance programme performance indicators that were used in the cooperative agreement of CDC and WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office for measuring progress over time in improving influenza surveillance system. Information collected from WHO global and regional databases (EMFLU, FluID and FluNet) were further triangulated through direct oral or written communication with Ministry of Health officials whenever required. The improvement achieved against each of these four outcome indicators by the end of 2018 and further reviewed by available evidence, were compared with the situation prevailing in 2011 (when the first five-year period of CDC Cooperative agreement on influenza surveillance programme ended and the second five-year period began) in order to assess improvement and measure progress.
