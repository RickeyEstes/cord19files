Cell culture and viral replication ST cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; GIBCO, UK) containing 1% L-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan, UT) at 37uC in 5% CO 2 . Culture medium was replaced two to three times per week. The TGEV TH-98 strain was isolated from a suburb of Harbin, Heilongjiang province, China. The virus was propagated in ST cells and preserved at 2 70uC in our laboratory.
