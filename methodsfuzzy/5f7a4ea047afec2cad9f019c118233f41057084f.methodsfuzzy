Toll like receptor-9 antagonists 33. Both the method described by Traggiai et al. and ours utilize human B cells of exposed individuals to select monoclonal antibodies against a variety of microbes without the need of recent vaccination of the donors. However, in contrast to B cells transformed by EBV 34 all B cell lines obtained with BCL6+Bcl-xL genetic programming stably express high levels of a signaling-competent, membrane-bound BCR. This high level of cell surface BCR facilitates isolation of B cells on the basis of antigen binding which greatly increases the frequency of antigen specific cells and abrogates the need for extensive subcloning. Whereas the generation of antigen specific clones using the EBV method takes 3 months 33, the genetic programming approach reduces this to 1 month. The fact that rare B cells can be easily cloned compares our method favorably with a recently described single cell cloning approach used to isolate influenza-specific antibodies 35 . In this study, Ig DNA was isolated 7 days after influenza vaccination from a population of CD27 high CD38 high B cells which contained a relatively high frequency of only several Influenza virus-specific B cells. The feasibility of this technique depends on a relative high frequency of antigen-specific B cells, that can be obtained by vaccination or very recent exposure to a microbe 35,36. As discussed above expression of AID in the genetically modified clones may be utilized to select antibodies with higher affinity providing an advantage compared to the EBV transformation and single cell PCR methods as platforms to generate human monoclonal antibodies. Another advantage of the method described here is that it can be used to obtain stable lines of B cells from species other than humans. We demonstrate that BCL6+Bcl-xL-transduced B cells of mice and non-human primates proliferate for at least one month in the presence of CD40L and IL-21. We also generated a series of cloned lines of mouse B cells (results not shown). It is therefore feasible to assume that our method will allow for expansion of antigen-specific B cells of multiple species including rabbits and goats. Such lines cannot be obtained by using EBV, which is only capable of transforming B cells of a variety of monkey species such as Chimpanzee, Marmoset, Squirrel, Owl and Cebus monkeys 37. The monoclonal cell lines that can be generated with this technology are very useful not only for generation of monoclonal antibodies, but also allow for detailed mechanistic studies of BCR-mediated signal transduction induced by specific antigens. They may be used to study signaling of BCR variants that differ in affinity for antigen. Furthermore, these cell lines can be useful tools to study the effects of a variety of external signals like antigen or cytokines on the function of AID and the induction of SHM.
