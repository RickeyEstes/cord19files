We have analyzed cytokine levels that were collected during the first five days of the 2006 TGN1412 clinical trial. TGN1412 dosage was 0.1 mg per kg of body mass, which averaged 79.7 kg for the six patients. The drug was infused at a rate of 2 mg/min over an average time of 3.97 min. The infusion time was short compared to measurement intervals and the time scale of response. Effects of different infusion durations are estimated from the derived dynamic model in the sequel. When the patients began to experience adverse side effects, clinicians treated the subjects with corticosteroids, chlorpheniramine, acetaminophen, ondansetron, metaraminol, methylprednisolene, and an anti-IL2 receptor antagonist antibody. All subjects received aggressive individualized treatment while in intensive care. Consequently, the recorded cytokine histories reflect not only the natural reactions of the subjects but their response to therapy. Concentrations of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-a, Interferon (IFN)-c, Interleukin (IL) 10, IL8, IL6, IL4, IL2, IL1, and IL12 were measured eight hours before drug infusion, and 1, 4, 26, and 40 hours post-infusion. Clinicians then took measurements every six hours through day 4 and daily until day 10. These values were linearly interpolated to points tabulated at 6-hr intervals through day 5 for our analysis. TNF-a, IFN-c, IL1, IL2, and IL8 are generally characterized as pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL4 and IL10 as anti-inflammatory cytokines, and IL6 and IL12 as either, depending on the signaling pathway [21] . Ordinary differential equations are often used to describe population dynamics of immune cells, pathogens, and signaling proteins [9, 22, 23, 24] . Here, we present linear, time-invariant models whose parameters are estimated from the median time series data for the six TGN1412 clinical subjects [11] . The models describe the evolution of nine cytokine concentrations without regard to the cells that secrete or are affected by them; cellular sources and sinks reported in the literature are discussed in a later section. Separate second-order equations for the concentrations and rates-of-change of each cytokine are constructed, and best-fit time constants are found by numerical search. All nine cytokines are then analyzed concurrently in an eighteenth-order system. A unified search over all of the higher-order system's parameters improves the fit to the measured variables and provides an integrated model of the cytokine storm event. The coupled model illustrates multi-class interactions among the cytokines, identifies response modes and mode shapes (i.e., eigenvalues and eigenvectors), and reveals similarities in principal components. The data set, differential-and difference-equation models, and numerical search algorithm are described. The effects of uncertainty in initial conditions, exogenous effects, and parameter estimates are evaluated using a stochastic extension of the linear model. Normal cytokine concentrations range from 3.7 pg/mL (IFN-c and IL10) to 48 pg/mL (IL1) or less, several orders of magnitude below the maximums shown in Fig. 1 . The points identified as ''Measurement'' in Fig. 1 are the median values for all six patients referenced to the baseline at infusion time, as presented in Fig. 3 of [11] ); inter-quartile error bars, which often span the measurement range, also are shown in this figure. Supplementary material shows considerable patient-to-patient variation in cytokine profiles. Signal saturation limits for the cytometric bead array immunoassays were 5,000 pg/mL; thus, higher cytokine values could not be detected. Because individual signals frequently reached saturation limits during the first few days of the event, estimates of several peak cytokine levels (particularly IL6, IL10, TNF-a, and IFN-c) may be conservative. The median rather than the mean (or average) for the six individuals is presented because saturation would bias the mean computation for the original data.
