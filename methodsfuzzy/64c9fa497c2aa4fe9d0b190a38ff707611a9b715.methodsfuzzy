When there is undesirable output (CO 2 ), the DEA data domain can be expressed as follows (Seiford and Zhu, 2002) : where y denotes the outputs; x denotes the inputs; y g and y c denote the desirable output (GDP) and undesirable output (CO 2 ), respectively; x c and x l denote the capital and labor, respectively. CEE can be improved by increasing the desirable output (GDP) and decreasing the undesirable output (CO 2 ), thus the undesirable output (CO 2 ) was calculated as follows (Woo et al., 2015) : where y c denotes CO 2 emissions; y c denotes the value of CO 2 emissions after linear transformation. The model (4) can be expressed as follows: where the variables share the same meanings in Equations (4) and (5). Based on Equation (6), Equation (1) can be expressed as follows: where the variables share the same meanings as in (1) and (6).
