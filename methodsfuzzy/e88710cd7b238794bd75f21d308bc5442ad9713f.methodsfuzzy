To detect a difference of 3 days between the mean duration of symptoms in the two treatment groups with a standard deviation of 4 days, given a two-sided P value of 0.05 and an approximate power of 80%, we calculated the sample size for each group to be 28 patients. Sixty-two consecutive patients presenting to two outpatient clinics in Alexandria, Egypt, suffering from common cold symptoms and meeting the eligibility criteria (stated in Inclusion criteria) in the period between 5 September 2009 and 5 March 2010 were recruited to the study. The local research ethical committee approved the study protocol, and all participants signed informed consents at the time of enrollment.
