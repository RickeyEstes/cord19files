The antimicrobial activity assay was performed on FTA and its metabolites with five test bacterial strains, and three replicates were performed for all of the samples. The positive controls were levofloxacin for bacteria and nystatin dehydrate for fungus, and the negative control was sterile distilled water. The antimicrobial effect of all of the samples was assessed in petri dishes with 20 ml nutrient agar plus 0.2 ml microorganism suspension (10 8 CFU/ml, O.D 0.1, λ = 590 nm). Once the agar had solidified, 200 μl of each sample and sterile distilled water (negative control) was added to wells that were 3 mm in diameter. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h, and the inhibition halos were evaluated (mm). The antimicrobial effect was determined by measuring the inhibition halos that formed around the wells [17, 18] . The MIC value was determined by the dilution method according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards [19] . The active samples and positive controls were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 3200 μg/ml. Twofold serial dilutions of the solution were then prepared (3200, 1600, 800, down to 6.25 μg/ml). Nutrient broth was prepared with 1% test bacteria strains (10 8 CFU/ml, O.D 0.1, λ = 590 nm). In total, 10 concentrations of each sample × three test bacterial strains × three replicate wells were performed in sterile round-bottom 96-well plates by comparing the sample with the non-inoculated nutrient broth. Inoculated nutrient broth (0.9 ml) and sample (0.1 ml) were placed into each well, and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. MIC values were determined as the lowest concentration that inhibited visible bacterial growth as detected by the unaided eye.
