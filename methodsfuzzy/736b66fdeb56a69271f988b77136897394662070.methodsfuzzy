IBV Beau was grown in confluent primary chick kidney cell cultures and labelled with [3H]uridine or t3H]adenosine as in [3] . HCV 229E was grown in confluent monolayer cultures of continuous MRC cells and labelled with [3H] uridine or [3H] adenosine [7] . Finally, MHV 3 was grown in confluent secondary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The cell monolayers were infected at an input multiplicity of 0.1 infectious particles per cell, with an adsorption period of 1.5 h at 37'C. At 6 h after infection, 20 pCi/ml of t3H]uridine or [3H]adenosine (Radiochemical Centre, Amersham) were added to the medium. At 32 h after infection the cells were harvested and subjected to 3 freeze-thaw cycles. The virus preparations were purified on sucrose gradients and labelled virus particles with typical coronavirus morphology were obtained in peak fractions of density 1 .I 8 g/ml coincident with peaks of infectivity [3, 7] . RNA was extracted from coronavirus particles with proteinase K [7], purified on cellulose CF 11 columns and analysed on 2.2% polyacrylamide gels supported by 0.5% agarose [7] . Oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography, digestion with pancreatic ribonuclease A and T1 ribonuclease, and digestion with polynucleotide phosphorylase have been described in [7]. As these RNA molecules are so large and their mol. wt were calculated by extrapolation of marker RNAs beyond that of the largest marker, their mol. wt may be over-or underestimated by an unknown amount. However, it is clear from these results that the sizes of these coronavirus genomes are almost identical.
