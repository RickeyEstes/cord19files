Dogs from three shelters located in Rio Grande do Sul state (RS), Brazil, were included in this study. Two shelters (#1 and #2) are located in Cachoeira do Sul (30 • 02 21 S and 52 • 53 38 W), and one shelter (#3) is located in Passo Fundo (28 • 15 46 S and 52 • 24 24 W). The sample collection was performed in 2014 in months of low temperatures (July and August). Fig. 1 illustrates the environmental conditions observed in these shelters. Shelter selection was performed to include a variety of shelter conditions, including those with low temperature seasons, varying population densities (to take into account the appearance and frequency of cleaning of the premises), and the nutritional states of the dogs (taking into consideration the type of food and the frequency of feeding according to healthy/unhealthy animal appearance). The selection of the animals within each shelter was performed randomly. Shelter #1 hosts stray dogs and cats of both genders, of all ages and primarily crossbred animals. The animal population of the shelter was 150 dogs and 30 cats on the date of sampling. The young dogs (six months up to two years old) and adults (more than two years old) were maintained in individual cages/small barns held by leashes in an open space, and most animals had direct and indirect contact with each other. Small, medium and large dogs had individual cages/houses shelters within the same area (approximately 1 m 2 ). Puppies were maintained in collective cages indoors without direct contact with adult animals. Shelter #1 was visited in the cold season when the temperatures ranged of 5-10 • C. At the visit, several animals presented with nasal discharge, indicating respiratory infection. Sanitary and nutritional conditions were inadequate, and the locality had not recently been cleaned. The animals did not receive good quality food and were not fed sufficient amounts. Shelter #2 hosts stray dogs of both genders independent of age and primarily crossbred animals. On the day of the visit, the number of animals was 70. During the day, the animals remained outdoors in fenced areas or held by leashes and were grouped according to gender and age. During the night, the animals were allocated indoors, in collective cages, with approximately 10 animals/cage. The dogs had a wide area in which to run and exercise during the day and had contact with each other. Shelter #2 was visited when the outdoor temperatures were between 10 and 15 • C. The sanitary and nutritional conditions were fair to good; the animals were fed once per day, and the cages were cleaned three times per week. Shelter #3 hosts stray dogs and cats of both genders, varying ages and primarily crossbred animals. At the visit, 180 dogs and 20 cats were present in the shelter. The dogs were allocated according to gender and age in collective fenced barns that had at least one dog house per animal. The animals had constant direct contact with other animals from the same cage/barn. The individual area was approximately Nasal swabs of 74, 35 and 77 dogs in shelters #1, #2 and #3, respectively, were randomly collected; approximately 50% of the dogs in each shelter were sampled. After sample collection, the swabs were maintained in RNAlater solution (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and the samples remained in dry ice during transport to the laboratory where they were stored at −80 • C. All proceedings involving animal manipulation were performed under the supervision of a veterinarian and according to the recommendations of the Brazilian Committee of Animal Experimentation (Comitê Brasileiro de Experimentação Animal -COBEA, law #6.638, May 8, 1979) . This research was approved by the institutional Ethics and Animal Welfare Committee (UFSM, Comitê de Ética e Experimentação Animal: approval number 080/2014). RNA and DNA extraction from nasal swabs were performed using an RTP DNA/RNA virus extraction kit (Invitek, Hayward, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After RNA extraction, complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using an enzyme Super Script III Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The PCR reactions were initially standardized to optimize the concentration of each reagent. Viruses obtained from two commercial vaccines were used as controls for CDV, CPIV and CAdV-2. For CaHV-1, nucleic acid extracted from the liver of a puppy naturally infected with CaHV-1 was used as a control. 17 Ultrapure water was used as a negative control in all reactions. The primers used in all reactions are described in Table 1 . All reactions were performed using a total volume of 25 L with 2 L of total DNA (100-200 ng) according to the PCR conditions described for each virus. Primers to CPIV were obtained using the Clone Manager 7 program (http://www.scied.com), and the sequences are shown in Table 1 For nucleotide sequencing, 90 L of each PCR product was purified using a PureLink ® Quick Gel Extraction and PCR purification Combo Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Positive samples were randomly selected and sequenced in quadruplicates in an automatic sequencer ABI-PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The obtained sequences were analyzed using the Staden Package for consensus sequences achievement. 22 The matrix of sample identity with sequences deposited in GenBank was performed using the BioEdit
