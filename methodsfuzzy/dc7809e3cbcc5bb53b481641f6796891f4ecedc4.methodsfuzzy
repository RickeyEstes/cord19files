Clinical specimens-Respiratory secretions. Brisbane cohort. A total of 1,245 specimens (predominantly NPAs) were collected between January 1, 2003, and December 22, 2003, from patients presenting to the Royal Children's Hospital in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, with symptoms consistent with acute lower respiratory tract infection. St. Louis cohort #1. A total of 480 BAL specimens were tested. These included samples from a retrospective and a prospective collection. The retrospective specimens were from a sequential collection of BAL specimens submitted routinely to the Virology Laboratory at St. Louis Children's Hospital between December 2002 and August 2003 [33] . For the present study, an effort was made to select specimens from this collection from patients with acute respiratory illness, and to exclude specimens collected as routine post-lung transplant surveillance. The prospective specimens were from an ongoing study of the etiology of severe acute respiratory illness and were collected between October 2005 and October 2006. Both collections included specimens from patients of all ages, although the large majority were from adults. St. Louis cohort #2. This collection was made up of respiratory specimens, mostly nasopharyngeal swabs, submitted for routine virologic testing to the Virology Laboratory at St. Louis Children's Hospital between September 2005 and June 2006. The majority of these specimens were from children. Of the 410 specimens in this collection, 200 were selected because they had been found to be positive by fluorescent antibody staining or culture for influenzavirus A or B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, or adenovirus. Clinical specimens-Urine. Brisbane cohort. Urine specimens (226) that were submitted during 2003 to the diagnostic laboratory for routine investigation were collected. These represented a diverse mixture of donors, including those from (i) sexual health clinic (n ¼ 50), (ii) pediatric clinic (n ¼ 52), (iii) antenatal clinic (n ¼ 33), (iv) indigenous health clinic (n ¼ 36), and (v) bone marrow transplant patients (n ¼ 55). The St. Louis urine specimens were from a study of polyomaviruses in adult renal transplant recipients [24] . A total of 200 individuals were enrolled in the study between December 2000 and October 2002. From each patient, up to three specimens were tested, including a specimen obtained before the transplant and specimens obtained at 1 and 4 mo after transplantation. Diagnostic testing of clinical specimens for known respiratory viruses. Brisbane cohort. Nucleic acids were extracted from 0.2 ml of each specimen using the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid kit (Roche Diagnostics Australia, http://www.rochediagnostics.com.au) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR assays for 17 known respiratory viruses were performed as described [20] . St. Louis cohort. All respiratory specimens were tested originally by fluorescent antibody staining using a panel of monclonal antibodies directed against influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial, parainfluenza 1-3, and adenoviruses (Simulfluor Respiratory Screen; Chemicon, http://www.chemicon.com). Specimens that were negative were also cultured using cell culture systems that could detect the same group of viruses plus rhinoviruses, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus. Total nucleic acid extracts were purified using a Qiagen M48 instrument (http://www.qiagen.com). Nucleic acid extracts were tested for a panel of respiratory viruses using the EraGen MultiCode-PLx respiratory virus panel (EraGen Biosciences, http:// www.eragen.com), a multiplex PCR assay that detects the following viruses: influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, parainfluenza 1-4, human meatpneumovirus, adenovirus subgroups B, C, and E, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses OC43, 229E, and NL63. Library construction and shotgun sequencing. Samples were prepared in the following manner for high throughput sequencing analysis. A total of 200 ul of neat NPA sample was thawed and directly treated with DNase I (Fermentas, http://www.fermentas.com) for 60 min at 37 8C. Total nucleic acid was extracted using the Masterpure Complete DNA and RNA Purification Kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, http://www.epibio.com). Then, 100 ng of total nucleic acid was randomly amplified using the RdAB protocol exactly as described [9] . RNA in the total nucleic acid preparation was converted to cDNA by reverse transcription with primer-A (59 GTTTCCCAGTCACGA-TANNNNNNNNN). Two rounds of random priming with primer-A and extension with Sequenase (United States Biochemical, http:// www.usbweb.com) enabled second strand cDNA synthesis as well as random priming of DNA originally present in the total nucleic acid sample. Amplicons were then generated via 40 cycles of PCR using primer-B (59 GTTTCCCAGTCACGATA) with a cycling profile of: 94 8C 30 s; 40 8C 30 s; 50 8C 30 s; 72 8C 60 s. The primer-B-amplified material was TOPO cloned into pCR4.0 (Invitrogen, http://www. invitrogen.com) and transformed into bacteria, and white colonies were picked into 384-well plates. DNA was purified by magnetic bead isolation and sequenced using standard Big Dye terminator (v3.1) sequencing chemistry. Reaction products were ethanol precipitated, resuspended in 25 ul of water, and loaded onto the ABI 3730xl sequencer. Analysis of shotgun sequences. Sequences were assessed for quality using Phred [34] , and reads that contained less than 50 contiguous bases with a score of phred 20 or greater were rejected. The remaining reads were analyzed in the following steps: 1) reads were aligned to the human genome using BLASTn with an e À10 cutoff; 2) remaining reads were aligned to a bacterial database using BLASTn with an e À10 cutoff; and 3) remaining reads were aligned to the viral RefSeq protein database using BLASTx with an e À2 cutoff [35] . Complete genome amplification and sequencing. The WU genome derived from the index case was sequenced to 33 coverage using six unique pairs of PCR primers for the amplification. Amplicons were cloned into pCR4.0 and sequenced using standard sequencing technology. All primers used for amplification and sequencing are listed in Table S1 and their positions depicted in Figure S5 . Additional complete genomes were sequenced to at least 23 coverage using the same primers listed in Table S1 . Completed Nucleic acid prevalence studies. For all PCR assays, standard precautions to avoid end product contamination were taken, including the use of PCR hoods and maintaining separate areas for PCR set up and analysis. For initial screening of WU virus, PCR primers AG0044 59 tgttacaaatagctgcaggtcaa and AG0045 59 gctgcataatggggagtacc were used with Accuprime hot start Taq (Invitrogen) to amplify 1 ul of template using the following program: 40 cycles of 94 8C 30 s; 56 8C 30 s; 72 8C 60 s. For every 88 samples tested, seven notemplate negative controls were interspersed between the actual samples. Products were visualized following electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. The resulting 250-bp amplicon was sequenced directly in both directions using primer AG0044 and AG0045. These sequences have been deposited in GenBank (see Supporting Information for accession numbers). Secondary confirmation was performed using primers AG0048 59 TGTTTTTCAAGTATGTTGCATCC and AG0049 59 CACCCAAAAGACACTTAAAAGAAA that generate a 244-bp amplicon in the 39 end of the LTAg coding region. The same cycling profile of 40 cycles of 94 8C 30 s; 56 8C 30 s; 72 8C 60 s was used. For detection of both BK and JC viruses, primers AG0068 59 AGTCTT-TAGGGTCTTCTACC and AG0069 59 GGTGCCAACCTATGGAA-CAG were used with a profile of 40 cycles of 94 8C 30 s; 56 8C 30 s; 72 8C 60 s. Figure S1 . Raw Sequence Data from High Throughput Screening A) The initial six shotgun reads with homology to polyomaviruses. B) The three contigs derived from the six reads. The consensus TAg binding motif is GAGGC. The known primate polyomaviruses SV40, JC, BK, and baboon polyomavirus all have four copies of the copies of the binding site oriented as shown above for SV40 (NC_001669). The first nucleotide of the third copy of the consensus TAg binding site is defined as nucleotide 1 for WU and SV40. Differences between SV40 and WU Virus are 1) one of the TAg binding sites in WU virus appears to be a non-canonical TAGGC; 2) the second and third consensus TAg binding sites in WU virus overlap; and 3) the nucletoide spacing between the TAg binding sites in WU virus varies from the prototype SV40 as shown.
