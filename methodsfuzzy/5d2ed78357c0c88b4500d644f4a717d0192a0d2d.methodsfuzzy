Forty-eight hours after transfection, CHO cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before addition of 200 l of lysis buffer (10 mmol/L Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 150 nmol/L NaC1, 1 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.25% NP-40, 0.2 mg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride per ml) at 10 6 cells/100 l for 20 minutes at 4Â°C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and 20 l of each was separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a Hybond-N nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham, Mississauga, Ontario). Membranes were probed with monoclonal anti-His antibody (Invitrogen). Bound antibodies were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham). Eight cases of fulminant viral hepatitis were examined (virus types: hepatitis B, 3; syncytial giant cell hepatitis with paramyxoviral like particles, 1; hepatitis virus non-A non-B non-C, 4). The micrographs shown are from one of the latter cases which are representative of all cases presented. Histological sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunoperoxidase staining (dark brown) used the avidin-biotin complex method. For fibrin detection, a rabbitanti-human fibrinogen antibody (DAKO, Carpenteria, CA), known to react with fibrinogen and fibrin in human tissues was used. The CD68 antibody (DAKO) was used to detect macrophages (histiocytes). A 216-bp DNA fragment from the conserved carboxyl end of the hfgl2 coding region was used as a template, to synthesize, with T3 and T7 RNA polymerases, digoxigenin-11-UTP (Boehringer Mannheim, Laval, PQ)-labeled sense and antisense cRNA probes for the in situ hybridization studies. 4 Alkaline phosphatase (dark blue) served as a marker of the reaction product. Tissue for electron microscopy was prepared by routine methods, 11 ultra-thin epon embedded sections were stained with lead citrate and examined in a Philips 400 electron microscope (Einthoven, The Netherlands).
