In the capacity of reference laboratory operating within InfluNet network [7] , our laboratory is in charge of carrying out the virological surveillance of severe forms of influenza infection in Lombardy (nearly 10 million inhabitants). From October 1, 2009, to April 30, 2011, 206 respiratory samples were collected from patients hospitalized due to severe respiratory illness. Of these, 61.2% were males with a median age of 44.3 years (IQR: 49.7 years; range: 1 month-89 years); 17.5% were children ≤ 5 years and 23.3% were ≥65 years. Data on comorbidities presence were available for nearly 70% of study patients: 64.3% reported medical conditions [3, 4] ; in detail, 25.6% had weakened immune system (due to cancer, HIV/AIDS, or long-term steroid treatment), 19.7% heart disease, 11.6% asthma/chronic lung disease, and 10.4% neurological/neurodevelopmental conditions. Out of 206 patients, 91 (59.3% males; 18.7% aged ≤ 5 years, 58.2% aged 6-64 years) were SARI cases who required admission to ICU and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy, and 115 (62.6% males; 16.5% aged ≤ 5 years, 60% aged 6-64 years) were ARDS cases, as defined by the European Consensus Conference [8] . Nine ARDS patients (median age: 35.6 years, IQR: 21.4 years) died during hospitalization: case fatality rate (CFR) in our ARDS series was 7.8% (9/115). No SARI case was fatal. Respiratory specimens (paired nasal/oral swab and bronchoalveolar lavage) were collected from each SARI/ARDS case. Nucleic acids were purified by NucliSENS easyMAG (bioMérieux, France) and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR assay to identify influenza virus. In detail, a one-step realtime RT-PCR assay was performed to simultaneously detect influenza viruses type A and B [9] . The subtyping of influenza A positive samples was carried out by a one-step realtime RT-PCR assay using specific primer/probe sets for the hemagglutinin gene [10] . The clinical specimens that resulted negative to influenza virus detection were then screened by real-time RT-PCR/PCR for a panel of respiratory pathogens (Respiratory MWS r-gene Real-time PCR, bioMérieux, France) to detect respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B; human metapneumovirus (hMPV) A and B; human rhinovirus (hRV) and enterovirus (hEV); adenovirus (AdV); human bocavirus (hBoV) 1-4; human coronavirus (hCoV) 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1; human parainfluenza virus (hPIV) 1-4; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Cases which resulted negative to all diagnostic assays were further investigated by VIDISCA-454 technique. This is a virus discovery method based on recognition of restriction enzyme cleavage sites, ligation of adaptors, and subsequent amplification by PCR combined with high-throughput sequencing 454 FLX/Titanium system (Roche, USA) [5] .
