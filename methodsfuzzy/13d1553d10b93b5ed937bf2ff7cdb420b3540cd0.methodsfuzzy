Genomic RNA isolation RCNMV (Australian isolate) was propagated and maintained in Nicotiene ctevetendii. Virus was purified and virion RNA phenol extracted as previously described (Lommel et et., 1988) . Preparative separation of the two genomic RNA components was achieved by electrophoresis of heat denatured virion RNA in 1% agarose gels containing 1x TBE buffer (89 mM Trisborate, 89 mM boric acid, and 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for 1 hr at 60 V. Ethidium bromide-stained RNA bands were visualized by long-wave uv transillumination and excised from the gel. RNA was electroeluted from the agarose into a 5 M NaCI salt bridge at 100 V for 2 hr in sterile 0.5x TBE. RNA was ethanol-precipitated from the salt bridge solution and resuspended in sterile water. Electroelution was repeated to eliminate trace contamination of the RNA with the other component.
