Differences in categorical and continuous distributions were evaluated by Fisher exact and Student t tests, respectively. Two-tailed Mann-Whitney (nonparametric) was used to compare the nonsteroid-and steroid-treated fl ow data. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction: RNA was extracted into 12 m L of water from 250 m L of respiratory speci-pared with those not treated (5.4 Ϯ 8.5 vs 17.2 Ϯ 34.4, P 5 .08). Of note, blood samples were collected on average 2 days after steroids were begun. By day 28, serum IL-6 levels were similar in both groups. RSV-specifi c serum and nasal antibody titers measured at the time of enrollment were not significantly different between groups. Serum and nasal antibody responses to RSV infection were slightly blunted in the steroid-treated group ( Figs 2A, 2B ) with convalescent titers approximately twofold lower compared with the untreated group. However, only serum-neutralizing antibody responses to group A virus ( P 5 .05) and nasal IgA to the fusion protein ( P 5 .01) were signifi cantly lower. Twenty-nine randomly selected subjects (16 steroid treated and 13 untreated) had T and B lymphocyte subpopulations analyzed at three time points: acute ( ‫ف‬ 36-48 h after initiating steroids), day 12 to 14, and to the hospitalized cohort to provide more balanced illness severity in the comparison groups. Although a variety of steroid regimens were prescribed, most patients received 4 to 10 mg of dexamethasone or 40 to 60 mg of methylprednisolone every 6 h for 1 to 2 days followed by an oral prednisone taper. The mean duration of steroid therapy was 11.3 Ϯ 7.3 days with a range from 1 to 27 days. Five subjects received 2 or fewer days of corticosteroid treatment. Seven subjects were taking oral corticosteroids prior to admission, and all were given IV corticosteroids or higher doses of oral prednisone treatment while hospitalized. Predictably, the clinical features of the subjects who received corticosteroids were different from those who were not treated ( Table 1 ) . Although most differences did not achieve statistical signifi cance, those given steroids in the hospital were more often men with a history of COPD and were receiving oral steroids and supplemental oxygen prior to admission. The presence of diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease was slightly more common among those not treated with corticosteroids. Admitting diagnoses were similar between the two groups, although COPD exacerbation was most common among those treated with steroids, and a diagnosis of pneumonia was the leading diagnosis for those not treated. Wheezing at the time of admission was more common in the steroid group, whereas the patients not treated with steroids patients were more often febrile. Although not signifi cantly different, there was a trend toward higher rates of infi ltrates on chest radiographs and mean peripheral WBC counts in those not treated with steroids. Overall, the hospital course for patients who received corticosteroids was similar to those who were not treated ( Table 2 ). Rates of respiratory failure, intensive care admission, and in-hospital mortality were not signifi cantly different. Two patients in the steroidtreated group died, and in both cases patients were placed on hospice care because of longstanding severe COPD. No patients developed nosocomial bacterial infections, and there were no overt complications related to steroid treatment, such as psychosis or severe glucose dysregulation. Although the mean last days of reported wheezing or dyspnea were significantly longer in the steroid-treated group compared with those not treated, the length of hospital stay and illness duration were not signifi cantly different. Group A and B viruses were evenly distributed in those treated with steroids vs those who were not treated. Viral shedding was not prolonged, nor was the mean viral load higher in the steroid-treated group ( Figs 1A, 1B ) . Infl ammatory mediators were measured in nasal samples at enrollment, day 12, and day 28 and were not consistently different in either group ( Table 3 ) . There was a trend toward lower acute serum IL-6 levels in patients treated with steroids com- between days 2 and 6, and 1.2 Ϯ 0.4 3 10 3 / m L after day 9. Representative fl ow cytometry results are shown in Figures 3 and 4 for a random subset of 35 and 23 patients for T-and B-cell panels, respectively, at the mid time point (day [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Analysis of early and late testing demonstrated similar fi ndings in B-and T-cell subsets (data not shown). A representative sample of B-and T-cell subsets is shown in e- Figure 1A and 1B. No signifi cant differences between steroidtreated and steroid-untreated subjects at any of the time points were noted regarding the total percentage of B cells (% CD19 1 ), CD27 1 memory B cells, antibody secreting cells (ASC), or plasmablasts ( Fig 3 ) . Additionally, there were no signifi cant differences in the fraction of CD3 1 T cells, monocytes, CD4 and CD8 T cells (naive and memory), and natural killer cells (subsets of CD56 1 CD16hi and CD56hi) ( Fig 4 ) .
