Study design and subjects. Thirty-two healthy, unselected infants from the ongoing prospective Basel-Bern Infant Lung Development (BILD) cohort study were included between April 2010 and February 2013 (39) . Pregnant mothers were recruited at maternity hospitals and practices of obstetricians by advertisements and interviews. Exclusion criteria for the BILD cohort study and thus our subgroup analysis are ethnicity other than white, preterm delivery (Ͻ37 weeks), major birth defects, disease or later diagnosis of airway malformation, or specific chronic respiratory disease. A weekly telephone interview was performed by study nurses to assess respiratory health. This substudy was performed in Bern only and thus approved by the Ethics Committee Bern. Nasal swab procedure. An anterior nasal swab (FLOQSwabs, in room temperature universal transport medium [UTM-RT]; Copan, Italia) was collected biweekly by parents after being instructed by study nurses about correct and standardized sampling of the swabs, starting in the fifth week of life. Immediately after acquisition, nasal swabs were sent to our study center and frozen at Ϫ80°C. The microbiota, 10 different viruses, and two atypical bacteria were analyzed in each sample. Microbiota analysis. The methods used for PCR amplification of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and 454 amplicon sequencing are described in detail elsewhere (10, 40) . In brief, V3 to V5 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the primer pair 341F/907R. The following primers were used: 341F (5=-CGTATCGCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGXXXXXXXXXXACTCCTACGGGAGGCAG CAG-3=) and 907R (5=-CTATGCGCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGXXXXXXXXXXCCGTCAATTCMTTTGAGTTT-3=). The template-specific sequences are in boldface, adaptor sequences are italicized, and the XXXXXXXXXX sequences describe the sample-specific multiplex identifier (MID) tag barcode. PCR mixtures were eluted in 40 l of double-distilled water, after purification with the Wizard SV PCR cleanup system (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR products with a concentration of less than 1.0 ng/l were excluded from the study, corresponding to less than 1 pg/l bacterial DNA (10) , which was recently recommended as a reliable threshold (41) . For further quality control, we excluded samples with less than 70 reads and sequenced two negative-control samples. Samples displaying greater than 5% sequence reads identical to the negative controls were excluded. In addition, we did not identify taxa that have recently been identified to be contaminations (42) . A 40-ng/l concentration of each PCR product was pooled, and every MID was used once. The 8 resulting amplicon pools were sequenced with the 454 sequencing platform, and the reads were submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive. Analysis of sequencing products was performed using PyroTagger pipeline (43) , which comprises the definition of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 97% sequencing identity, estimation of chimeras, and taxonomic assignments. Pipeline settings were described in detail before (40) . As an additional quality cutoff, samples with less than 70 sequence reads were excluded from the study (n ϭ 13), resulting in a minimum number of reads of 77. The mean number of sequence reads was, however, much higher (1,469 [SD, 1,083] reads per sample). Outcome parameters were bacterial density estimated by the concentration of the 16S rRNA PCR product (PCR concn ) in nanograms per microliter, alpha diversity assessed by the Shannon diversity index (SDI, based on OTUs of 97% sequence identity), and beta diversity, the latter both calculated in R using the "vegan" package. For beta diversity, dissimilarity indices were calculated using the Jaccard distance method and the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, and nMDS was used as the ordination method. Again, beta diversity measurements were based on OTUs of 97% sequence identity. The five most abundant bacterial families (Streptococcaceae, Staphylococcaceae, Moraxellaceae, Corynebacteriaceae, and Pasteurellaceae) and Carnobacteriaceae (which were formerly described in interrelationship with respiratory infections [23] ) were analyzed, and the remaining families were grouped as "others." This phylogenetic level was used for additional statistical analyses (see below). The real-time PCR was performed on different real-time PCR machines of Applied Biosystems (7500, 7900HT; QuantStudio 7 Flex). The hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) cellular gene control (CC) essay using the duplex rhinovirus and EV/CC r-gene samples was used to evaluate sampling quality, extraction, and amplification in every sample. Samples showing an exponential amplification curve with a threshold cycle (C T ) value of Ͻ45 were assessed as positive. The PCR tests were done by a certified laboratory that has routinely used the CE-marked Respiratory MWS r-gene for the detection of respiratory viruses since 2012. For easier reading, the term "viral analysis" is used in the text, although two atypical bacteria are also included in the analysis. Respiratory symptoms. In weekly standardized telephone interviews, symptoms of lower and upper respiratory tract infections, wheeze, and/or cough were recorded. Rhinitis (runny or blocked nose) was independently assessed as the most common upper respiratory symptom. For data analysis, if referring to symptomatic viral infection, we combined upper and lower respiratory symptoms. If referring to URTI, cough and/or wheeze had to be present. An LRTI was defined as cough, wheeze, or breathing difficulties and upper respiratory tract symptoms or elevated temperature for more than 2 consecutive days. A viral infection was specified as symptomatic if any respiratory symptoms occurred up to 4 days before until 7 days after detection of viral colonization in the sample. Additional risk factors or confounders. Information about pre-, peri-, and postnatal history, including family, maternal, sociodemographic, and environmental histories, was collected in hospital records and with a questionnaire. At the time of the weekly standardized phone interview, changes in host and environmental factors were documented. The following factors were included in our statistical model to adjust for potential confounders: the time-invariant factors included in our study were maternal atopic disease (maternal asthma, hay fever, or eczema), parental education (categorized as low [less than 4 years of secondary education], middle [at least 4 years of secondary education], and high [tertiary education]), mode of delivery (C-section or vaginal delivery), smoking during pregnancy, and presence of older siblings. The time-variant factors included were age and season of sampling, breastfeeding ("current" [yes/no] at time of swab), hypoallergenic nutrition ("current" [yes/no] at time of swab), and child care ("current" [yes/no] at time of swab). Statistical analysis. We investigated the association between viral colonization and the microbiota using multilevel regression with random effect to correct for clustering on the individual level. We performed binomial multilevel regression to analyze bacterial families and PCR concn . In a subgroup analysis, zero inflated binomial regression was not a better statistical model than regular binomial regression (Vuong test for model selection) and thus was not used. Diversity (SDI) was analyzed with multilevel linear regression after transformation (square root [sqrt]) to obtain a normal distribution. We investigated an association between viral colonization and the microbiota in the same sample ( Fig. 1 ; analysis I), the microbiota after viral colonization ( Fig. 1 ; analysis II), and the microbiota before viral colonization ( Fig. 1; analysis III) . After performing a univariable model (no adjustment), two adjusted models were performed. In the first adjusted model, an adjustment for season and age was performed, because both influence the microbiota (10). In the second adjusted model, we adjusted for further risk factors of respiratory symptoms or viral infections in early life: having siblings, mode of delivery, child care, hypoallergenic nutrition, breastfeeding, parental education, smoking during pregnancy, and maternal atopy (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) . To analyze the microbiota at the end of the study period, we calculated the median of the different microbiota outcome parameters of all existing samples of an infant between 9 and 12 months of age. We used two different indices to calculate the diversity between samples. The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and the Manhattan-type Jaccard dissimilarity were used to calculate the weighted beta diversity indices (abundance based), by using the "vegdist" function of the "vegan" package in R. For nMDS, "metaMDS" of the vegan package was used. To analyze differences in beta diversity, the "Adonis function" was used as a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) analysis, and adjustment for multiple measurements was applied ("strata" operator in the Adonis function). We performed two sensitivity analyses to ensure robustness of results. We excluded the samples with a number of reads below 500 (n ϭ 84) and (i) repeated the main analyses as stated above. With this approach the range of number of sequences per sample between the different samples is much smaller. (ii) The total number of sample reads was randomly resampled to an equal number of reads and rarefied to 500, using the "rrarefy" command of the vegan package in R. Subsample analysis in all remaining samples with 500 reads (n ϭ 475) was performed. Results are represented as coefficients (Coeff), incidence rate ratios (IRR), or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and P values; P values of Ͻ0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were done using Stata13 (College Station, TX), R ("vegan package" "Adonis function") version 3.1.1 (R Foundation of Statistical Computing), and GraphPad Prism 5.
