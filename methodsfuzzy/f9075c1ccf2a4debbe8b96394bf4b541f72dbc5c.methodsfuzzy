Cell growth during the cultivations was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ). For dry cell weight (DCW) determination, a known volume of fermentation broth was centrifuged for 10 min in pre-weighed test tubes at 4°C and 4000 rpm, washed once with water, and dried for 24 h at 90°C to a constant weight. To extract lycopene, the E. coli cells were grown in a 500-ml shaking flask at 37°C and 200 rpm, harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm and 4°C for 10 min, and rinsed twice with deionized water. Then the cells were suspended in 1 ml of acetone and incubated at 55°C for 15 min in the dark. The samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min, and the acetone supernatant containing lycopene was transferred to a clean tube. The lycopene content of the extracts was measured according to the previous reported method [8] . Lycopene (purchased from Sigma) dissolved in acetone was used as the standard. The results were the mean from three independent determinations, and the standard deviations were in the range of ± 10% of the means.
