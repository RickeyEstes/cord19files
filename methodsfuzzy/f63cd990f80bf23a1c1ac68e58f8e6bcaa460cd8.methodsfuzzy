2.1. Preparation of VLP, PCV2 recombinant proteins, and peptide conjugates PCV2 CP (amino acids [aa] 1e233) was expressed in baculovirusinfected Sf9 insect cells, as previously described [19] . The PCV2 ORF2 gene (GenBank no. EU747125) was cloned into the pFastBac expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and transfected into Sf9 cells. The culture supernatant containing the recombinant baculovirus was harvested and used to infect a separate batch of Sf9 cells. After 3 days, VLPs were purified from culture supernatant by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Recombinant CP with a deletion of the N-terminal region of the protein (delN CP, aa 44e233) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified, as described previously [12, 20, 21] . A synthetic CP 169e180 peptide (STIDYFQPNNKRC) was chemically synthesized using Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis (Peptron, Inc., Daejeon, South Korea) and conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) or keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) [10] .
