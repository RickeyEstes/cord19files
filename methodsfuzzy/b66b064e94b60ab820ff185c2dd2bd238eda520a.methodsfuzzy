Antibodies and plasmids. The rabbit anti-S serum used in Western blot and FACS analyses, P540, was described previously [5] . The anti-Myc epitope antibody was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The anti-ACE2 goat polyclonal antibody was purchased from R&D system (Minneapolis, MN) and used for detection by Western blotting. Site directed mutagenesis was used to create the consensus cleavage sites corresponding to that of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) and some coronaviruses within the full length SARS-CoV S glycoprotein gene in pCDNA3. The Quick-Change Kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) was used and the protocol suggested by manufacturer was followed. For expression of various N-terminal S fragments, the corresponding gene fragments were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pSecTag2 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad). The plasmid pCDNA3-ACE2-ecto, which expresses the ACE2 soluble ecto domain tagged with C9 peptide, was kindly provided by Michael Farzan (Harvard University, Boston, MA). Protein expression and purification. Various N-terminal fragments of the S glycoprotein were sub-cloned in pSecTag2 expression vector and transfected into 293T cells followed by infection with VTF7.3 as described previously [5] . The protein expressed and secreted into the medium was purified using the HiTrap Ni 2+ -Chelating column (Pharmacia) under the native condition. The purified protein was dialyzed against PBS buffer and stored for further analysis. S glycoprotein dimerization and its interaction with ACE2 examined by co-immunoprecipitation. For S fragment dimerization, different S glycoprotein constructs were transfected alone or in combination with 293T cells as described previously [5] . Medium containing S fragments was subjected to immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-S polyclonal antiserum P540. For some co-immunoprecipitation experiments, DTT was added to create reducing condition to eliminate inter-molecule interactions through disulfide bonds. Immunoprecipitated S fragments were detected by Western using an anti-Myc epitope monoclonal antibody. Soluble ACE2-C9 was expressed similarly to expression of S fragments. ACE2-C9 secreted into the medium was used directly for incubation with various S fragments for 2 h at 4°C. Afterwards, ACE2 was immunoprecipitated by incubating with 1D4 anti-C9 monoclonal antibody and protein G-Sepharose beads at 4°C for 1 h. The beads were washed four times with PBS, suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and subjected to gel separation. The presence of either ACE2 or S in the sample was examined by Western as described previously [5] . Flow cytometry. Cells transfected with full length S glycoprotein or S glycoprotein with different N-terminal deletions and infected with VTF7.3 were incubated with the P540 rabbit anti-S polyclonal antibody and goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with FITC in PBS containing 1% BSA at 4°C for 2 h. Cells were then washed four times in ice-cold PBS and analyzed with FacsCalibur (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, California). Gel filtration analysis of S fragments. After being purified on Ni-Chelating column and buffer-exchanged to PBS, S fragment samples were loaded onto a Superose 12 10/300 GL column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) that had been pre-equilibrated with PBS. The proteins were eluted with PBS at 0.5 ml/min and 0.5 ml fractions were collected. The Superose 12 column was calibrated with protein molecular mass standard of 669, 440, 232, 158, 67, 44, and 25 kDa. A 10ll aliquot was taken from each fraction for Western blot analysis. Crosslinking. Purified S537 fragment was diluted to a concentration of 0.2 lg/ml in PBS. BS 3 (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was added to the S537 solution to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubated on ice for 1 min. The samples were then mixed with an equal volume of 4· SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by Western blot. Cell fusion b-gal reporter gene assay. Cells transfected with pSec-Tag2B-S or pCDNA3-ACE2 and infected with VTF7.3 and VCB21R, respectively, were collected by trypsin digestion and washed once with PBS. Cells were then suspended in regular DMEM at pH 7.4 and mixed. Cells were lysed after 4 h of incubation and b-gal activity was measured using CPRG as the substrate (Roche) as previously described [5] . ELISA. Two ELISAs were used. In the sandwich ELISA the plate was coated with an anti-His tag antibody, then the S fragments were added and detected with an anti-c-Myc epitope antibody. This assay was used for detection of the S fragments. In the second ELISA the C9 tagged receptor ACE2 was coated on the plates through an anti-C9 antibody (ID4) and the S fragments were added and after washing detected with an anti-c-Myc epitope antibody. In all experiments the incubations with the c-Myc epitope antibody were for 2 h at room temperature. The optical density (OD) was measured and normalized to the highest value.
