This study was carried out with a total of 960 juvenile white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) obtained from a farm free of WSSV as confirmed by PCR analysis 5 days prior to the beginning of the trial. The study lasted for 18 days. Shrimps had a mean weight of 5 g at the beginning of the trial and were randomly distributed in four groups with four replicates each. Thus each replicate was carried out with 60 shrimps and the groups were distributed as follows: 1. Control untreated-challenged group (CUCH), fed with drug-free food throughout the trial and challenged with WSSV on day zero. 2. Control untreated-unchallenged group (CUUCH), fed with drug-free food throughout the trial but not challenged and dosed with saline solution. 3. Experimental 1 (E1), fed as E1, but starting 17 days before challenge as above with WSSV and maintaining the treatment for further 5 days after. 4. Experimental 2 (E2), fed standard diet plus Viusid® throughout the trial and starting 1 day before the challenge with WSSV, as group CUCH. Once groups were formed five shrimps from each group were randomly selected and their hemolymph obtained and measured to set basal values of total hemocyte counts by direct counting with the Neubauer chamber. Then, additional samples from five shrimps per group were obtained for hemocyte count on days 6, 12 and 18. Shrimps were maintained in 1000 L tanks with continuous flow of brackish water at an approximate rate of 10 L/h. Temperature was kept at 23-25°C with a thermostat (LED 200 W Dymax), pH was approximately 7.6-7.8 (Aqualytic, Germany), and continuous aeration was provided at 6.79-6.56 mL/min. Animals were fed twice a day with commercial shrimp drug-free pellets (Camaronina Purina®, Sonora, México), having: 35% protein min, 9% fat min, 3/32 in pellets and considering a 3% feed intake per day with respect to the biomass as established by Alday-Sanz (2010). Lack of ecdysis in shrimp was ensured before initiation of this trial. Glycyrrhizinic acid was incorporated to pelleted shrimp-feed as liquid Viusid® (Catalysis Spain, distributed by Dermaceutical México, S.A. de C.V. Mexico City). To achieve this, 540 mL of the commercial preparation was diluted in 100 L of demineralized water. Then pellets were dressing-sprayed on big trays. Feed was allowed to dry at room temperature for 8 h, stored in paper bags and fed to shrimps.
