Plasmid construction XRN1 from S. cerevisiae, including 1000 bp of the 5' and 3' UTRs, was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA prepared from S. cerevisiae S288C. This PCR product was cloned into the plasmid pAG425-GAL-ccdB by the "yeast plasmid construction by homologous recombination" method (recombineering) [84] to produce pPAR219. Briefly, pAG425-GAL-ccdB was amplified by PCR to produce a 5000 bp product lacking the GAL-1 gene and the ccdB cassette. The PCR primers used to amplify pAG425-GAL-ccdB contained additional DNA sequence with homology to the UTRs of XRN1 from S. cerevisiae. Both PCR products were used to transform BY4741, with correctly assembled plasmids selected for by growth on complete medium (CM)-leucine. The XRN1 open reading frame (HA-tagged and untagged) from S. mikatae, S. bayanus, or S. kudriavzevii was introduced into pPAR219 between the 5' and 3' UTRs from S. cerevisiae XRN1 using recombineering to produce pPAR225, pPAR226, and pPAR227, respectively. As a negative control, NUP133 was cloned into the pPAR219 plasmid backbone to produce pPAR221, which was used to allow growth of xrn1Δ on medium lacking leucine without XRN1 complementation. The LEU2 gene was replaced by TRP1 using recombineering techniques to produce the plasmids pPAR326, pPAR327, pPAR328, and pPAR329. Using PCR and recombineering, we also constructed chimeric XRN1 genes by exchanging regions of S. kudriavzevii XRN1 (pPAR227) with the corresponding regions of S. cerevisiae XRN1 (pPAR219). XRN1 inducible plasmids were constructed by cloning PCR-derived XRN1 genes into pCR8 by TOPO-TA cloning (Thermo Fisher). Utilizing Gateway technology (Thermo Fisher), XRN1 genes were sub-cloned into the destination vector pAG426-GAL-ccdB for overexpression studies [85] . The same pCR8/Gateway workflow was also used to clone and tag GAG from a cDNA copy of the L-A totivirus (pI2L2) to produce pPAR330 and pPAR331. The DNA sequences from all constructed plasmids can be found in S2 File. A list of all relevant plasmids can be found in S2 Table. Yeast strain construction The S. cerevisiae killer strain (BJH001) was created by the formation of a heterokaryon from the mating of the haploid strains BY4733 (KAR1) and 1368 (kar1) [86] . The resultant daughter heteroplasmon cells were selected by growth on CM-uracil and the ability to produce zones of growth inhibition indicative of the presence of L-A and the killer virus. The inability to grow on CM lacking histidine, leucine, tryptophan or methionine was also used to confirm the genotype of BJH001. BJH006 was created by replacing XRN1 with the KANMX4 gene using homologous recombination within BJH001 [87] . A list of relevant yeast strains and species used in this study can be found in S3 Table. Rapid extraction of viral dsRNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae 1 x 10 9 yeast cells (~10 mL) were harvested from a 24-48 h overnight culture grown to saturation. Strains of S. kudriavzevii and S. mikatae were grown at room temperature, all other strains were grown at 30°C. The flocculent nature of some strains of wild yeasts made it challenging to accurately determine the exact number of cells present in some cultures. In these cases, the size of the cell pellet was used as an approximate measure of cell number relative to S. cerevisiae. Harvested cells were washed with ddH 2 O, pelleted, and washed with 1 ml of 50 mM EDTA (pH 7.5). Cells were again harvested and the pellets suspended by vortexing in 1 ml of 50 mM TRIS-H 2 SO 4 (pH9.3), 1% β-mercaptoethanol (added fresh), and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The cell suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant removed and the cell pellet suspended in 1 ml of BiooPure-MP (a single-phase RNA extraction reagent containing guanidinium thiocyanate and phenol) (Bioo Scientific) and vortexed vigorously. 200 μl of chloroform was added and vortexed vigorously before incubation for 5 min at room temperature. The aqueous phase and solvent phase were separated by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and 1/3 volume of 95-100% ethanol added and mixed well by vortexing. The entire sample was loaded onto a silica filter spin column (Qiagen plasmid miniprep kit) and centrifuged for 30 s at 16,000 x g. The flow-through was discarded and the column washed twice with 750 μl of 100 mM Nacl/75% ethanol by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 30 sec. The column was dried by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for an additional 30 sec. The dsRNA was eluted from the column by the addition of 100 μl of 0.15 mM EDTA (pH 7.0) and incubation at 65°C for 5 min before centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 30 sec.
