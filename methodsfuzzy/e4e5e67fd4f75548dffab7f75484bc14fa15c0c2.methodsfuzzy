Strains and culture conditions Wildtype phi6 (ATCC no. 21781-B1) and its standard laboratory host: P. syringae pathovar phaseolicola (PP) strain HB10Y (ATCC no. 21781) were originally obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Bethesda, MD). These, along with novel hosts P. syringae pathovar atrofaciens (PA), P. syringae pathovar tomato (PT), P. pseudoalcaligenes East River isolate A (PE) were streaked from glycerol stocks originally obtained from G. Martin (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), and L. Mindich (Public Health Research Institute, Newark, NJ) as described in previous studies (23, 25) . Previously isolated isogenic host range mutants phi6-E8G and phi6-G515S (with E8G and G515S mutation on the host attachment protein P3, respectively) (23) were used to examine genome-wide mutations on host expansion. Both host range mutants can infect PP, PT and PE. Bacteria were grown in LC media (LB broth pH 7.5), 25°C. Phages were grown with bacteria in 3mL 0.7% agar top layer on 1.5% agar plates as previously described (23) . Mutational neighborhood mapping Twice-plaque-purified phi6-WT, phi6-E8G, and phi6-G515S were raised to high-titer lysates on their respective hosts ( i.e. phi6-WT was grown on PP while phi6-E8G and phi6-G515S on PT), and titered on their respective hosts. All lysates were tested for existent PA host range by spot plating approximately 10 4 -10 5 plaque forming units (pfu) on a lawn of PA before plating to select for host range mutants. At least 10 6 pfu of phage were plated on novel host PA to isolate one host range mutant per lysate. 50 single plaques were isolated from each lysate by plating on PA. Five of the phi6-G515S PA host range mutant plaques were isolated by the Biotechnology class of Spring 2016 at South Brunswick High School. All 150 plaques were stored in 40% glycerol at -20°C as freezer stock and generated into high-titer lysates again for further analyses. PA mutation frequency assays Four independent clones of twice-plaque purified phi6-WT, phi6-E8G, and phi6-G515S plaques were raised to high-titer lysates on host PP, PT and PT respectively. After measuring titers on these hosts, these high titer lysates were titered on PA to assess the PA mutation frequency within the population standing genetic diversity. One of the four clones tested for each genotype was the source of the 50 clones.
