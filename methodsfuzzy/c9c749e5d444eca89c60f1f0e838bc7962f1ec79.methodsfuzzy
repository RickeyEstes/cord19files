The study used a cross-sectional survey research design with purposive sampling to recruit a total of 100 patients post-CABG (50 male and 50 female) from a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) CABG surgery in the past 5 years, (2) ability to read Chinese, and (3) willingness to participate in the research. Patients with psychiatric diagnoses were excluded. Approval from the institutional review board at the hospital was obtained. Permission to use the instruments was obtained from the respective copyright holders. Potential participants were invited in person at the doctor's office, and the researchers discussed the risks versus benefits of the study with each patient. Patients who agreed to participate in the study were given a research packet that included a consent form and 3 questionnaires (coping, anxiety, and demographics) and were asked to complete the questionnaires within 1 week. In addition, a stamped, preaddressed envelope for their convenience in returning the questionnaires was included in the research package. Confidentiality, anonymity, and the right of participants to withdraw from the study were presented. The surgeon who performed the operation on the participants is a member of the research team. Taiwanese patients usually have great respect for their physicians, and he explained to the patients that the study would help health care providers understand patients' anxiety and coping after CABG. Thus, the return rate was 100%.
