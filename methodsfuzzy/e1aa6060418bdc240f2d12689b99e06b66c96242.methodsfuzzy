Dipping of animals is the most hazardous method of application because entry may occur through all portals. Spraying is safer because percutaneous absorption and inhalation are the only portals of entry. The small particle size of the compound and concentration of animals in confined spaces while spraying increase the possibility of poisoning. Oily preparations are not used for animal treatment but are used inadvertently and are readily absorbed through the skin. The source of infection is always an infected animal, and the method of spread is almost always by the bite of an infected animal, although contamination of skin wounds by fresh saliva may result in infection. Not all bites from rabid animals result in infection because the virus is not always present in the saliva; the virus may not gain entrance to the wound if the saliva is wiped from the teeth by clothing. The virus may appear in the milk of affected animals, but spread by this means is unlikely as infection. The rabies virus is relatively fragile, susceptible to most standard disinfectants, and dies in dried saliva in a few hours. One of the most important parameters in rabies models is the transmission rate, or the number of susceptible animals infected by a diseased animal per unit of time. In a population of 19 raccoons feeding at a concentrated, common food source available during the summer in rural eastern Ontario, raccoons bite and are bitten an average of 1.0 to 1.3 times per hour, respectively. Because of the natural occurrence of rabies in animals in caves inhabited by infected insectivorous bats, inhalation as a route of infection came under suspicion. It is now accepted that interbat spread, and spread from bats to other species is principally by bites, but that infection by inhalation also occurs. That infection can occur by ingestion has been put to use in devising systems of vaccinating wildlife by baiting them with virus-laden baits. Pseudorabies is not very contagious and large quantities of the virus are required to infect pigs except very young piglets. Larger doses of virus are needed for oral infection than nasal infection. In feral pig and wild boar populations it appears to be venereal transmission that is more important. 7 It can be transmitted transplacentally, especially in the last third of gestation. It can also be passed through the colostrum. In milk excretion of virus takes place for 2 to 3 days following infection. Virus can be transmitted for up to 12 days in semen following infection. Venereal transmission of latent infection in sows and boars has been suspected, but there is no direct evidence. The virus cannot usually be isolated from urine. In a study of PRV in wild swine in the United States it was found that the virus was found in the oral cavity of feral pigs and was widely distributed in the tonsils, salivary glands, taste buds, and even mucosa in the region of the tusks. 8 Infected swine shed virus in large quantities from all body excretions, secretions, and aerosols. Virus shedding starts 1 to 2 days after infection, reaches a peak at 2 to 5 days, and may last up to 17 days. Virus can be isolated from the oropharynx for 18 to 25 days. Pigs, and possibly rodents, appear to be the primary host for the virus. The virus is present in the nasal discharge and in the mouth of affected pigs on the first day of illness and for up to 17 days after infection. This suggests that short-length aerosol transmission is a common occurrence within buildings or units but long distance transmission is still doubted. After infection and recovery pigs may be regarded as carriers. The method of spread is not known but is suspected to be fecal-oral. 1 Spread from farm to farm does not occur readily. On some farms only sporadic cases may occur, but on others one or two cases occur every year. In still other herds the disease occurs in outbreak form, with a number of animals becoming affected within a period of about 4 weeks. The epidemiology of SBE resembles in many ways that of malignant catarrhal fever in cattle. The organism can be isolated from many organs, including liver, spleen, and CNS, and from the blood, feces, urine, nasal discharges, and milk in the early stages of the disease. There is some evidence that the organism is eliminated in the feces for several weeks after infection. More than 75% of kids born to infected dams may acquire infection, which can be potentially transmitted to them by several routes. Infection can also occur in older goats. EHV-1 is highly infectious, as evidenced by transmission of infection despite stringent biosecurity measures in referral hospitals, riding schools, and so on. 32,46,47 Transmission occurs by the inhalation of infected droplets myeloencephalopathy. Genital disease is an unusual manifestation of EHV-1 infection. Infection with EHV-1 causes retinitis and fatal disease in camelids. It also causes disease in wild equids including zebras and neurologic disease in black bears (Ursus americanus), Thomson's gazelles (Eudorcas thomsonii), guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus f. dom.) Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), and polar bears in zoologic parks in which these animals are in proximity to equids (such as zebra). [37] [38] [39] It is associated with abortions and stillbirths in guinea pigs. 37 Infection is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and therefore by ingestion and possibly by aerosol. The virus replicates primarily in the intestinal tract, particularly the lower intestine and the ileum but also in the respiratory tract. Replication is thought to be in the reticuloendothelial cells of the lamina propria. There may be a viremia in the Teschen type of disease but not in the mild forms. Piglets may pick up the infection after weaning when the maternal antibody disappears. Many strains can infect the pig. They can be infected at any age with a strain that they have not been exposed to before. When infection first gains access to a herd, the spread is rapid and all ages of pigs may excrete virus in their feces. The initial epidemiologic studies suggested that the disease in the UK was an extended common-source epidemic, and the only common source identified in these initial studies was the feeding of proprietary concentrate feedstuffs. Epidemiologic studies also suggested that the presence of MBM in proprietary concentrates was the proxy for affected cattle to have been exposed to a scrapie-like agent, and this conclusion is supported by case-control studies examining feeding practices to calves that subsequently developed the disease. This hypothesis explains breed differences in incidence because concentrates are not commonly fed to beef calves in the UK; it also can account for geographic differences in incidence. The oral route of challenge is known to be an inefficient route for the transmission of the agents associated with spongiform encephalopathies, and this is thought to be the reason for the low within-herd incidence of the disease in the face of a common exposure. MBM is manufactured by the rendering industry from tissues discarded in slaughterhouses and from down and dead livestock. The outbreak of BSE in Great Britain was temporarily preceded by a change in the method of processing of MBM to a continuous process with a cessation of the use of hydrocarbon fat solvents. It is postulated that this change permitted the cycling of unrecognized but extremely low-incidence cases of classical BSE. The initial exposure probably occurred from 1981 to 1982 and, subsequently, the agent recycled from infected cattle carcasses and offal used in the preparation of MBM. Rendering procedures have subsequently been devised to minimize survival of the agent. The marked fall in disease incidence following the introduction of the feed ban in 1987 in the UK substantiated the importance of ingestion of MBM as the major method of infection. Bans in Europe were largely introduced in 1990. Knowledge of transmission of scrapie is based primarily on the experimental disease and observations of the natural disease in experimental flocks. The method of supplementation will vary depending on the class of livestock and the ease with which the vitamin can be given. In pigs, the vitamin is incorporated directly into the complete ration, usually through the protein supplement. In feedlot and dairy cattle receiving complete feeds, the addition of vitamin A to the diet is simple. In beef cattle, which may be fed primarily on carotene-deficient roughage during pregnancy, it may not be possible to supplement the diet on a daily basis. However, it may be possible to provide a concentrated dietary source of vitamin A on a regular basis by feeding a protein supplement once weekly. The protein supplement will contain 10 to 15 times the daily allowance, which permits hepatic storage of the vitamin.
