. . Patients. This study was retrospectively designed. Consecutive patients who were newly diagnosed with LAPC at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between August 2015 and August 2017 were included in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) pathologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma and radiologically confirmed LAPC. LAPC was defined per the seventh edition of the AJCC staging system for pancreatic cancer, which describes LAPC as arterial encasement of either the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery or unreconstructable superior mesenteric or portal vein involvement, with no evidence of metastatic disease from abdominal and thoracic computed tomography [17, 18] ; (2) IRE therapy as the initial treatment. A total of 11 patients were excluded based on the following exclusion criteria: (1) other treatments, including surgical resection and RFA before IRE (seven patients); (2) existing metastatic implants before IRE (one patient); (3) heart arrhythmia and a history of second primary malignant tumors (one patient); (4) missing information of parameters or lost to follow-up (two patients). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. All procedures performed in present study involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of institutional and/or national research committees and the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or similar ethical standards. Written informed consent was obtained from patients prior to treatment. . . Clinical Data Collection. The following clinical and radiological data were retrieved from medical record archived at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, including age, gender, tumor size, tumor grade, tumor site, white blood cell (WBC) count, platelet (PLT) count, serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), albumin (ALB), total bilirubin (TBIL), indirect bilirubin (IBIL), Creactive protein (CRP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9). The inflammationbased indexes, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), prognostic index (PI), and modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS), were also entered into this study. The thresholds for the clinical or radiological variables were used as the cutoff values. With the cutoff value of 1.47 and 165.29, NLR and PLR were associated with the optimal Youden indexes for OS and progression-free survival (PFS) prediction, respectively. The defined score of other inflammation-based indexes, such as PI and mGPS, had been described in previous studies [19] . . . Treatment Procedure. The NanoKnife IRE equipment from Angiodynamics System (Queensbury, NY, USA) was used. General anesthesia with deep neuromuscular block was adopted. To create an electric field around the tumor, 3 to 6 probes were used according to the size and location of the tumor. Ultrasound was used to guide the placement of all probes, and adequate space between probes was then confirmed. The generator unit software was used to analyze the probe configuration data of the ultrasound and provided optimal voltage and pulse length delivery. If the tumor size was larger than 1.5 cm in the axial plane, a pull-back technique with the same procedure was performed to cover the entire area of ablation. . . Sample Collection. All blood samples were collected before the hypothesis of this study was known. The blood samples were collected using Na-heparin plasma tubes from enrolled patients before IRE (preOP) and then on days 3 (D3) and 7 (D7) after IRE. Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was processed immediately using Hypaque-Ficoll (Promega) and frozen in liquid nitrogen in 5% (v/v) plus 95% (v/v) autologous serum [20] . . . Flow Cytometry Analysis. Frozen PBMCs were thawed in a 37 ∘ C water bath and then cultured overnight at 37 ∘ C in RPMI-1640 (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 5% human AB type serum and labeled with FITC-, APC-, and/or PEconjugated murine anti-human monoclonal antibodies. The CD3, CD3CD4, CD3CD8, CD3CD16CD56, and CD4CD25 phenotype of lymphocytes were sequentially analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS caliber, 4 color system, BD Bioscience, CA, US). . . Assays of Immune Parameters. The quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique (ELISA kit, R&D system, Minneapolis, MN) was adopted to measure serum concentrations of cytokines, including IL-2, IL6, IL-10, interferon-(IFN-), and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF). During the procedure of measure, 50 to 100 l of assay diluent was added to the 96-well polystyrene microplate, which was precoated with murine monoclonal antibody against IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-, and TNF. Serum samples were incubated at 37 ∘ C for 2 hours and then the plates were aspired and washed three times. Same incubation was repeated after 200 micoliters of conjugate was added. Then, plates were incubated at 37 ∘ C for 20 to 30 minutes after 200 l of substrate solution was added. Finally, 50 l of stop solution was added to the plates. A microplate reader (ClinicalBio 128c, Austria) was used to read optimal density (OD) within 30 minutes at 450 nm wavelength, whose references were set to 550 and 620 nm. A Beckman ARRAY 360 System (Beckman Coulter, Galway, Ireland) was used to evaluate the concentrations of several humoral immune parameters, including C3, C4, IgA, IgM, and IgG. Specific antibodies were measured by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After the incubation, the microplate reader (ClinicalBio 128c, Austria) was used to read OD within 30 minutes at 450 nm wavelength, whose reference was set to 630 nm [20] . . . Follow-Up. The follow-up procedure was performed in accordance with previous publications and recommendations [21, 22] . OS was defined as the duration from treatment until death or the last follow-up. PFS was defined as the duration from treatment until the date when disease progression was diagnosed or until the last follow-up. The last follow-up was completed on September 30, 2018. . . Statistical Analysis. Continuous variables were compared using an independent sample t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Binary categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test. OS and PFS curves were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between the groups were identified using the log-rank test. Univariate analysis was performed to assess the significance of parameters. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression model for the variables that were found to be significant in the univariate analysis, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. ROC curves and C-indexes were used to compare the survival predictive ability. Twotailed P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical package (R software version 3.4.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
