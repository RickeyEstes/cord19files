This study was conducted using a modified Delphi technique, a consensus-based methodology that is favoured by medical educationalists worldwide [7] . Delphi is a "group communication process" that focuses on gathering information from a panel of experts, aiming to reach a convergence of opinion regarding a particular issue or set of issues [8] . Unlike other data collection methods, the Delphi method employs a number of iterations or rounds, with three rounds being deemed sufficient by relevant experts, until a consensus of opinion is reached [8] . To begin with participants are supplied with a prepared questionnaire, which is followed by a second questionnaire based on the results garnered from the first. Subsequent surveys refine and define the central issues at heart of the study, taking into account the opinions provided by the participants [9] . Determining the level of consensus must be carefully considered when developing the Delphi rounds. There is no universal consensus proportion agreed upon for the Delphi method; different experts have advocated percentage measures ERS international Adult Respiratory Medicine syllabus for postgraduate training ranging between 50% [10] , 70% [11] and 80% [12] . For this particular study, the ERS task force opted to apply an 80% cut-off rate.
