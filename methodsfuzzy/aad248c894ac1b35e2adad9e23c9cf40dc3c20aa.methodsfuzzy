Fabrication of thin two-layered polyacrylamide (PA) hydrogels on 24-well glass-bottom dishes PA hydrogel fabrication was done as previously described with a few modifications for the specific experiments (Georges et al., 2006; Bastounis et al., 2011 Bastounis et al., , 2014 Vincent et al., 2013) . Glassbottom plates with 24 wells (MatTek; P24G-1.5-13-F) were incubated for 1 h with 500 μl of 2 M NaOH. Wells were rinsed with distilled water, and 500 μl of 2% 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (Sigma; 919-30-2) in 95% ethanol was added to each well for 5 min. Wells were rinsed again with water, and 500 μl of 0.5% gluteraldehyde was added to each well for 30 min. Wells were rinsed with water and dried at 60°C. To prepare hydrogels of varying stiffness, mixtures containing 3-10% acrylamide (Sigma; A4058) and 0.06-0.6% bis-acrylamide (Fisher; BP1404-250) were prepared. Specifically, 0.6-kPa hydrogels contained 3% acrylamide and 0.06% bis-acrylamide, 3-kPa hydrogels contained 5% acrylamide and 0.1% bis-acrylamide, 20-kPa hydrogels contained 8% acrylamide and 0.26% bis-acrylamide, and 70-kPa hydrogels contained 10% acrylamide and 0.6% bis-acrylamide. For each stiffness, two mixtures were prepared, the second of which contained 0.03% 0.1 μm-diameter fluorescent beads (Invitrogen, F8803). Mixtures were then degassed for 15 min to remove oxygen, which inhibits acrylamide polymerization. First, 0.06% APS and 0.43% TEMED were added to the solutions containing no beads to initiate polymerization. Then, 3.6 μl of the mixture was added at the center of each well, capped with 12-mm untreated circular glass coverslips, and allowed to polymerize for 20 min. The coverslips were then lifted with a syringe needle with a small hook at its tip, and then 2.4 μl of the mixture containing tracer beads was added, sandwiched again with a 12-mm untreated circular glass coverslip, gently pressed downward with forceps, and allowed to polymerize for 20 min. Next, 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.5 was added to the wells, and coverslips were removed using the syringe needle and forceps. PA hydrogels were UV-sterilized for 1 h. Hydrogels were then activated by adding 200 μl of 0.5% wt/vol heterobifunctional cross-linker Sulfo-SANPAH (ProteoChem; c1111) in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, on the upper surface of the hydrogels and exposing them to UV light for 10 min. After activation, the hydrogels were washed with 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.5 to remove excess cross-linker and were coated with 200 μl of 0.25 mg/ml rat tail collagen I (Sigma-Aldrich; C3867) in 50 mM HEPES overnight at room temperature. Prior to seeding cells, hydrogels were incubated with cell media to allow equilibration for 30 min.
