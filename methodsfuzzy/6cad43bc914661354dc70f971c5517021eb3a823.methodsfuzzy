Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained using a sterile feeding tube and injector for nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash or a sterile nylon swab without culture medium. Samples were kept at 4°C for up to 24 hours before storage at -80°C, pending transport on dry ice to the UK for virus detection by multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 19 viruses: RSV; IV (A, B); HPIV types (1-4); AdV (A-F); hRV; HMPV; HCoV (NL63, 229E, OC43) and hBoV (gene targets and primer sources in Table 1 ). At the time of processing, viral material was eluted into a volume of 200 μl. Nucleic acid extracts were prepared using a QiagenMDx BioRobot. First round amplification was performed using 20 μl nucleic acid extract. Second round PCR was performed using 1 μl amplicon from first round PCR as template material. Reactions were run using a Lightcycler 480 with melt curve analysis for the detection of PCR products. Genotyping was performed by Sanger sequencing of second round PCR products when appropriate (AdV). Sequences were analysed using the BLAST algorithm.
