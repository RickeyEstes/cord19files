S. eriocheiris Culture, Host Cell Culture, and Treatment S. eriocheiris was isolated from E. sinensis with TD using the methods described by Wang et al. (2004b) and cultured in R2 medium at 30 • C (Moulder et al., 2002) . 3T6-Swiss albino (3T6) cells were purchased from the Type Culture Collection cell bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Committee (Shanghai, China) and Human cervical epithelial adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells from Professor Chen's lab. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), (Wisent, Canada) complete medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.15% NaHCO 3 , 0.45% glucose, 4 mM L-Glutamine (Wisent, Canada), and antibiotics (100 U ml −1 penicillin, 100 U ml −1 streptomycin) at a suitable pH of 7. 20-7.40 . When the cell cultures grew to >70% confluence, they were treated in the following ways: (1) 3T6 cells were treated with S. eriocheiris (S. eriocheiris groups) for 36 h; (2) 3T6 cells were infected with S. eriocheiris, which was treated with anti-ALP (1:2000) for 1 h at 30 • C (S. eriocheiris+Anti-ALP groups), and incubated for 36 h; (3) 3T6 cells were infected with S. eriocheiris, which was treated with pre-immume serum for 1 h at 30 • C (S. eriocheiris+serum groups), and incubated for 36 h; (4) 3T6 cells were treated with recombinant ALP (5 µg/ml) for 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min (using 0 min as control); (5) 3T6 cells were treated with EGF (20 ng/ml) and using different concentrations of recombinant ALP (0, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 µg/ml) for 15 min, cells without any treatment served as a control; (6) HeLa cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding EGFP-ALP and DsRed-Fiblin7, using X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche) according to the supplier's instructions. The all host cells were culture with same conditions 37 • C and 5% CO 2 .
