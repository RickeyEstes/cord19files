Bioaerosol samplers used and preparation of mineral-oilspread agar plate In this study, an Andersen six-stage sampler (SKC) and a portable BioStage impactor (QuickTake 30) (SKC Inc., Eighty Four, PA) were used for studying the efficiencies of mineral-oilspread agar plates. The Andersen six-stage sampler has six stages, which have respective cutoff sizes of 0.65, 1.1, 2.1, 3.3, 4.7 and 7.0 mm, and different impaction velocities of 24-1.1-m/s. The BioStage impactor is the sixth stage of the Andersen six-stage sampler, and has a cutoff size of 0.65 mm. Recent development of QuickTake 30 pump from SKC has equipped the BioStage impactor with the portability. The QuickTake 30 pump can continuously vacuum air for 4 h at the flow rate of up to 30 L/min (SKC Inc., Eighty Four, PA). In this study, right before the sampling the mineral-oil-spread agar plates were prepared by first pipetting 100 mL mineral oil (ViaTrap Collection Medium, SKC) and then plating it evenly using a spreading bar onto Trypticase soy agar (TSA) (30 mL) (Becton Dickinson Microbiological System, Sparks, MD) Petri dish plate for bacteria, and Malt Extract Agar (30 mL) (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Sparks, MD) for fungi inside a Biosafety Level II cabinet (Sterilchem GARD, Baker Co., Sanford, Maine). Given the dimension (,8.6 cm in diameter) of the Petri dish used, a mineral oil film of ,180 mm thick was formed on the agar plate. The mineral oil used was indicated to neither kill nor grow bacteria [21] .
