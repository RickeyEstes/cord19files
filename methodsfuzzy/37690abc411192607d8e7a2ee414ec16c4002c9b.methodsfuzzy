The literature review included recent books, journal publications and grey literature about ToC practice generally and also within the A4RD and food security domain. Based on their networks and knowledge, the authors developed an initial list of 70 potential interviewees considered to be at the forefront of the AR4D domain and who were focused on Africa and Asia, the global hotspots of chronic food insecurity and poverty. The potential interviewees worked in different national, regional and international research, academic, non-government, donor, private, and public organisations, and included equal representation of women and men. Of the 70 in the original list, 44 individuals were prioritized and invited to an interview; 28 individuals accepted the invitation and ultimately 26 (8 women and 18 men) made themselves available for interview. Twelve interviewees were researchers, nine were managers or advisors in development programs, and five were from governmental or philanthropic donor organisations. The interviews involved a set of semi-structured questions about the expert's understanding of ToC and impact pathways, and their experience of applying ToC in intervention design, implementation and impact assessment. Interviews were transcribed and analysis of transcripts was assisted by use of NVivo qualitative analytical software (QSR International Pty Ltd, 2012) . Analysis of both the literature and interview transcripts employed a constant comparative technique from a grounded theory approach (Glaser, 2017; Strauss and Corbin, 1997) in order to develop an understanding of the state of, and constraints to mainstreaming ToC in AR4D.
