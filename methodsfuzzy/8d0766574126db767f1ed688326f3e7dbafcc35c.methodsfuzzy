We have examined the occurrence of all new patients positive for MRSA in any site A (in the period January 1st 1997-October 22nd 2004, and B) in the period from August 1st 2003 to October 22nd 2004, the same period the new MRSA detection broth has been in used. Only the first positive specimen-set from new patients, both carriage and infections, were included. In period A the specimens were grown on a selective mannitol agar containing 6% NaCl (2% NaCl after October 2002) and Oxacillin 4 mg/L, whereas in period B the specimens were grown in a selective broth containing phenol red mannitol with aztreonam 75 mg/L and ceftizoxime 5 mg/L. Isolates of MRSA were verified by PCR detection of nuc and mecA genes by PCR in both periods. Objectives: Challenged by an increasing demand for MRSA surveillance and declining resources, clinical laboratories require sensitive and specific screening media to ensure a rapid turn-around-time (TAT) to notification and a low falsepositivity rate if costs and MRSA are to be controlled. Conclusion: While the CFOX plates were more costly, they were significantly more sensitive (P < 0.0001) and specific (P < 0.0001) than MSOX resulting in less material and labour costs. The TAT to notification appears reduced due the ease of working directly from the CFOX plate. Results: Using a breakpoint of R < 19 mm (cefox 10); R < 24 mm (cefox 30) and R < 29 mm (cefox 60) two, three and two mecA positive isolates tested false susceptible, respectively. Five, four and six mecA negative isolates tested false resistant. Zone edges for the 10 mcg tablet were more distinct and easier to read. For S. aureus ATCC 29213 the following zone diameters were found 21-23 mm, 27-29 mm and 29-33 mm, respectively and for S. aureus ATCC 25923 22-23 mm; 27-29 mm, and 32-33 mm, respectively. Conclusions: All three cefoxitin Neo-Sensitabs performed with high accuracy using this challenge set and as good as the results obtained in a recent evaluation of a 10 mcg paperdisk. The cefoxitin 10 mcg Neo-Sensitabs performed slightly better than the 30 or 60 mcg and zone edges were easier to read why we will suggest the use of 10 mcg tablet. Since the year 2001,103 p aged 14-42 years (64 females), were assessed for FUO.C serology was carried out in the 1st-step workout, together with haematological-biochemistry studies, and assays for collagen vascular and autoimmune disorders, thyroid function, and microbiology studies for mononucleosis, toxoplasmosis, HIV, communityacquired respiratory, urinary, and stool pathogens, and tuberculosis. All p underwent C serology for IgM-IgG search, a minority of p had viral DNA-antigen search. Results: Of 103 p,14 (13.6%) had a positive IgM search for C, confirmed in 4 cases by biomolecular-antigen assays.A crossreaction with EBV serology was found in 8 p, but IgM antibody titres against EBV were lower and rapidly declined during a 6-12 month follow-up. An altered leukocyte count and differential was always present,and lymphocyte subsets showed a transient imbalance of CD4/CD8 cell ratio, a decrease of rate and absolute number of CD4 cells (250-580/lL), and an expansion of CD8 subset. Underlying signs-symptoms included fever in all p associated with a mononucleosis-like syndrome in 11 p, usually characterized by a moderate lymphadenopathy and pharyngodinia. In 10 cases a moderate (2-4-fold) elevation of transaminases was present and hepatosplenomegaly was confirmed by ultrasonography. In 3 p only fever, fatigue and anorexia were the predominant signs and symptoms. A normalization of hepatic enzymes and leukocyte differential preceded the disappearance of lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, while positive C IgM search lasted until 36 months in 1 p (mean time to disappearance:10-26 months). Discussion: Primary C is a self-limiting disease, whose apparent increase in frequency is probably attributable to the easier access to specific laboratory testing. Although no treatment is indicated in otherwise immunocompetent p, clinicians should maintain an elevated suspicion for primary C when a FUO is of concern, since C may last significantly and p with missed diagnosis are at risk of a vicious circle between an apparently unexplained disease, and the need of further examinations. Results: 27 out of 30 HHV-8-positive samples were positive on the novel EIA. Assay sensitivity was calculated at 90%. Coincidence with commercially available EIA was 98.21%. The percentages of positive reactivity in all investigated groups were as follows: 119 for health blood donors, 1.76 for children, 2.21 for STD-patients and 3.38 for HIV-infected. Specificity of the assay was around 98.2%-98.8% and there were no significant differences between health donors/children and groups at highest risk of acquiring HHV8 infection. The design was a single round audit questionnaire was sent out to the selected haematologist of 220 haematology units in the UK. Questions were asked regarding both antimicrobial chemotherapy of choice and antimicrobial prophylaxis in managing febrile neutropenia. Results: Responses were received from 167 (76%) of the 220 haematology units providing care to patients with febrile neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia is empirically treated with piperacillin-tazobactam or carbapenem monotherapy by 10% of haematologists. Overall, dual therapy (i.e., an aminoglycoside plus a piperacillim-tazobactam) is prescribed by 72% of haematologists. When response to initial empirical therapy does not occur after 3-4 days, 32% of haematologists may add glycopetide (vancomycin or teicoplanin) or 29.1% may change to carbapenem and glycopeptide. Forty-eight per cent of haematologists will routinely add conventional amphotericin to the ongoing antibiotics in persistent neutropenia, compared to 39% using liposomal amphotericin. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is frequently used as an adjuvant in managing febrile neutropenia (47% of haematologists). For antifungal prophylaxis, fluconazole is prescribed by 57% of haematologist followed by itraconazole by 33%. Forty-seven of haematologists use antifungal prophylaxis in all neutropenic patients compared to 17% whom used antifungals only in patients with neutrophil less than 0.1 · 109/L. Conclusions: Rationalization of using antimicrobial chemotherapy in the management of febrile neutropenia, by adopting Study selection: RCTs comparing ciprofloxacin with an aminoglycoside as combination therapy to a beta lactam for the treatment of febrile neutropenia and reporting effectiveness, mortality, and/or toxicity data were included in the analysis. Studies that examined quinolones as monotherapy, the combination of a quinolone with an aminoglycoside, use of quinolones in the outpatient setting from the start of treatment, or quinolones other than ciprofloxacin were excluded. Data extraction: Data for 3 primary and 2 secondary outcomes were extracted by two investigators. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency and susceptibility patterns of bacterial pathogens isolated from blood cultures in febrile neutropenic cancer patients hospitalized in an anticancer hospital over a two years period. Methods: A total number of 586 blood cultures were examined, using the automated Bact/Alert Microbial Detection System (aerobic FAN and anaerobic FN). After classic subculture methods, all isolates were characterized at species level by the Api 20 system. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were performed using the semi automated method Microscan according to NCCLS recommendations. All the investigated patients were neutropenic (WBC <1 · 10 to the power of 9 per liter) with fever (>38°C) and were under antimicrobial and antifungal therapy at the time of blood culture. Results: Over the two years period (2002) (2003) 586 blood cultures were performed on the basis of the physicians request from 81 patients hospitalized in the two oncology and one hematologist ward of our hospital. The mean length of neutropenia was 13 days. The pathogens were isolated from 64 blood cultures in 21 patients (25%). Among the 22 bacterial strains isolated from bloodstream infections, 72.7% were Gram negative strains (n = 16), 18,1% Gram positive cocci (n = 4), one strain L. monocytogenes and one strain C. kruzei. In the group of Gramnegative strains E. coli was dominant with an increase antibiotic resistance (7/9 resistant to Amoxicillin / Clavulanic acid and 5/9 resistant to Ciprofloxacin). All the Gram-negative rods were highly susceptible to Imipenem (15/16), Meropenem (16/16) and Piperacillin/tazobactam (16/16). In the group of Gram-positive bacteria glycopeptide resistant strains were no found. All the Staphylococci strains were susceptible to Methicillin. Conclusions: We observed rising trends in the number of Gram-negative isolates and in antibiotic resistance of all gramnegative rods. The empiric therapy with wide range antibiotics in febrile neutropenic cancer patients seems to be the optimal option, but the monitoring of antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial strains is still required. Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) is frequently associated with mild hepatitis and rarely with acute liver failure. Immunologic impairment is a significant predisposing factor. Objectives: We report a 4 years-old girl with Acute Lymphoblatic Leukemia (ALL) and acute fatal liver necrosis after VZV infection. Methods/Results: She was the second child of the family, with a negative history of VZV disease or vaccination. ALL had diagnosed six months ago, the child was treated according to the ALL -BFM 2000 protocol and was then in complete remission. On the time of admission, she was three weeks on dexamethasone (10 mgr/m 2 /day) (re-induction). The child was first admitted in the Hematology/Ongology Department with severe abdominal pain, fever (38°C) and elevated transaminases. Next day, cutaneous lesions appeared on the chest and face, suggesting VZV infection, and antiviral therapy with acyclovir was immediately initiated. Two days later the patient was transferred to the PICU with severe clinical and laboratory deterioration, high fever, tachypnea with positive chest x-ray (right low lobe consolidation with pleural effusion), abdominal distention, liver enlargement, gross haematuria and GI bleeding, vesicular rash on the chest, face and scalp and generalized petechiae and echymoses. The patient had pancytopenia, marked elevated hepatic enzymes and bilirubin, hypoalbuminemia and severe disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. She was continuously transfused with FFP, RBC, PLT and cryoprecipitate. The child was intubated in hours, because of progressive respiratory and neurological deterioration. Renal failure was developed. Assistance was asked from a liver transplant team and the little girl was urgently transferred to a special department for emergency liver transplantation. Unfortunately, two days after transportation, the child developed deep coma and severe hypotension and died. VZV antibody levels were negative, but VZV DNA was detected from liver biopsy and blood specimen, with PCR. Conclusions: Immunocompromised children are potentially threatened of infections, such as highly contagious chickenpox. The mortality of VZV-induced hepatic failure is very high. Only few patients survived with liver transplantation. The study was performed on some P. aeruginosa strains isolated from central venous catheter related infections in patients admitted for cardiovascular surgery. The strains were firstly submitted to antimicrobial testings performed by standard disk diffusion method and 25 strains susceptible to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and quinolones were further tested by two experiemental models for antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial cells included in biofilms formed in liquid and solid media. The strains were also studied for slime production and for cell hydrophobicity. Results: Our results showed that the P. aeruginosa cells growing in biofilms are significantly less susceptible to antibiotics, in a dose-response (increased MICs and MBCs) and time-dependent manner. This aspect was particularly evidenced and statistically confirmed for aminoglycosides, which poorly penetrate the biofilm, due to their policationic structure. The majority of the tested strains produced high amounts of slime, evidenced after safranin staining of the biofilm developed on glass tube walls, expressed both at 37°C and 4°C and well correlated with the presence of bacterial capsule. All the tested strains exhibited high hydrophobicity levels evidenced by decreased absorbance values of the aqueous phase of bacterial cultures in the presence of paraxilen and also by the ability to self-aggregate, raising the risk of colonizing the inert materials and of catheter related persistent infections. We have recently identified a genetic locus involved in biofilm formation of E. faecalis. Biofilm formation was measured using a polystyrene plate assay and media supplemented with oligosaccharides. The expression of genes was measured by real-time PCR and the locus was sequenced. Homology was assessed using BLAST and related programmes. Results: The genetic locus identified by us is also involved in maltose uptake and metabolism. The expression of genes in this locus is regulated by maltose and glucose in the growth medium indicating that nutritional oligosaccharides may promote or inhibit biofilm formation. While the wild-type strain was able to produce biofilm in medium containing either glucose or maltose, two mutants (one transposon mutant and one deletion mutant) showed opposite effects. A transposon mutant showed a reduced biofilm formation when grown in medium containing 1% glucose while a deletion mutant produced more biofilm when grown in glucose, but was unable to form biofilm when maltose was added to the growth medium. The sugar-binding transcriptional regulator bopD seems to bind to an operator upstream of the bop locus and a consensus binding sequence shown to bind to the maltose repressor MalR is present in the non-coding region upstream of bopA. Conclusions: The biofilm-positive phenotype of the wild-type strain seems to facilitate colonization of enterococci in the gut and the presence of oligosaccharides in food may regulate biofilm formation and therefore colonization of enterococci in the gastrointestinal system.
