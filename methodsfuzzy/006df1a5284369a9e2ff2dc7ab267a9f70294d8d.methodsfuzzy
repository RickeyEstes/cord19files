Clinical samples, positive controls and DNA extraction The study (Ref. No. LEC 08013) was approved by the Institutional Review Board of L. V. Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, India. Vitreous samples were collected from 20 patients with clinically suspected viral retinitis between January 2009 and May 2009. HSV-1 DNA extracted from HSV-1 grown on rabbit corneal epithelial cells was used as a positive control. The viral DNA was extracted from clinical samples and from the HSV-1-infected cell line using the Qiagen DNA minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The viral DNA was finally eluted in 75 lL of elution buffer and stored at )20Â°C. All the patient samples were tested with both the LAMP assay and with a real-time PCR assay.
