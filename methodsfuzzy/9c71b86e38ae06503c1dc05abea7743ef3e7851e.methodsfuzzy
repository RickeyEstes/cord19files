BAL was performed through a fiberoptic bronchoscope using standard techniques [12] . Microbiological investigations performed on BAL included Gram's stain, acid-fast stain, and cultures for conventional bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. Quantitative culture of BAL specimens was used to assay conventional bacteria with a threshold value of â‰¥10 4 colonyforming units/mL [13] . An immunohistochemical stain to detect P. jirovecii was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with a commercially available mouse monoclonal antibody that reacts with human and rodent pneumocystis cysts and trophozoites (Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Pneumocystis Jiroveci, Clone 3F6, Code M0778, Dako, Denmark). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) was cultured by standard techniques [4] . Viruses other than CMV, including respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus, were detected using direct immunofluorescence assays for respiratory virus screening and identification (Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH, USA). An amount of BAL fluid containing 10 3 cells was centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature. Differential cell counting was used to determine the percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and alveolar macrophages [14] . Using a hemocytometer chamber, a medical laboratory technologist counted cells and a laboratory medicine specialist verified it.
