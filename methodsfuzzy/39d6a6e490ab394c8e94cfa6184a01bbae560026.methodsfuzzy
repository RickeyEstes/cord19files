Nucleotide sequences of the coronaviruses were taken from Genbank (MERS: JX869059, SARS: NC004718, CoV 229E: KF514433, CoV OC43: NC005147, CoV NL63: JX504050, HKU-1A: DQ415914, HKU-1B: DQ415911, HKU-1C: DQ415912). MFold (Zuker and Turner, 1999) was used with default settings for RNA secondary structure prediction. The single-stranded or ss-count file of an MFold output supplied the number of folded structures (50 maximally), including a frequency value for each individual nucleotide of being unpaired in this collection of structures. We scored a nucleotide as unpaired (single-stranded, "ss") if half or more than half of the structure models reported its position as "ss". Nucleotides with a ss-count value below this criterion were scored as being paired (double-stranded, "ds"). Discrimination between ss and ds nucleotides was performed in Excel and fasta files were created in order to determine the composition of ss and ds nucleotides, separately, by means of MEGAv5 (Tamura et al., 2011) . The size limit for submission to the MFold server is 9000 nucleotides (nts). The 30,000 nts coronaviral RNA genomes were therefore partitioned into four portions (3 Ã— 8500 nts and rest) with 500 nts overlaps. This obviously ignores long-distance interactions that may occur in a coronavirus RNA genome. The ss-count data of the submission output files were arithmetically averaged at the region of overlap before the ss/ds discrimination was performed. We used the MFold ct file of the top 1 structure model to score the basepair usage in coronaviral RNA (regular Watson-Crick and G-U/U-G pairs). Partial sequence files were reconstituted at a site near the center of the overlap to minimize folding artifacts near the borders of the submitted sequences. Base composition analysis along the RNA genome length and the accompanying ss and ds fasta files was performed by the method of cumulative skew diagrams in overlapping windows (Grigoriev, 1998) . For normalization purposes, windows were defined around 1% of the sequence length with a step size of 20% of the window size. Codon usage was characterized by means of plotting the effective number of codons (ENC-values) of coronavirus genes versus their GC-content at the 3rd synonymous codon positions (GC3values): the "Nc-plot" (Wright, 1990) . This analysis excludes the codons AUG (Met) and UGG (Trp). A continuous line indicates theoretical ENC values with random codon usage as a function of GC3. Deviation from this line in the direction of lower ENC-values points to translational selection acting in favor of a preferred set of codons, as has been described for highly expressed genes in yeast (Bennetzen and Hall, 1982) and Escherichia coli (Sharp and Li, 1987) . Codon usage data for the nuclear genes of the host species were obtained from the Codon Usage Database (Nakamura et al., 2000) . The data were available for the following numbers of codons (number of available coding sequences or CDS in parentheses): human: 40,662,582 (93,487), dromedary: 6414 (21) and bats (3 species): 3522 (10). Calculations were performed in Excel.
