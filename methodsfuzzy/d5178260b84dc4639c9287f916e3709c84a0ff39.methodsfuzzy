Virus propagation and putificatim The A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was grown in the spontaneously transformed 17 Cl-l line of BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts as previously described (Sturman and Takemoto, 1972; Sturman, 1977) and assayed by plaque titration in 17 Cl 1 cells. To prepare radiolabled virus, cells in 150-mm2 plastic flasks were inoculated with 1.0 ml of MHV at a multiplicity of 0.3 to 3 PFU/cell in Dulbecco's modified Eagles' minimal essential medium, high glucose (DMEM; Gibco, Grand Island, N. Y.), and incubated for 1 hr at 37". The inoculum was removed and cells were refed with 30 ml EMEM + 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (dFBS) containing 20 &i/ml of L -rH]amino acid mixture (New England Nuclear) and incubated for 24 hr. Virus released into the supernatant medium was harvested and purified by a modification of the method described previously (Sturman et aL, 1980) , using discontinous and continuous sucrose density gradients in TMS buffer (containing 0.05 M Tris-maleate and 0.1 M NaCl, pH 6.0) and omitting the polyethylene glycol precipitation step. L4zbeling and electrophoresis of intracellular viral pol~peptides. To study synthesis, processing, and release of viral specific polypeptides, pulse-chase experiments were performed. Confluent monolayers of 1'7 Cl 1 cells in 60-mm petri dishes (Falcon, Inc.) were preincubated for 18 hr at 37" in L-leucine deficient EMEM (leu-def MEM) with 10% dFBS and either mock infected with 0.5 ml/plate of leu-def MEM with 10% dFBS or inoculated with 3 to 5 PFU of MHV/cell in 0.5 ml/plate of leudef MEM with 10% dFBS. After incubation for 1 hr at 37", the inocula were removed, the cells were refed with leu-def MEM with 10% dFBS, with or without 0.5 pg/ml of tunicamycin (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, Ind.), and the cultures were held at 37". Four hours prior to pulse labeling, 5 pg/ml of actinomycin D was added to the medium. At 8 and 10 hr after virus inoculation infected and control cells were pulse labeled for 15 min with 20 or 40 &i/ ml of rHlL-3, 4, 5-leucine (New England Nuclear, Inc.). The labeled medium was removed, cells were washed and refed with DMEM containing a lo-fold excess of unlabeled L-leucine, 10% FBS, 0.5 pg/ml tunicamycin. At intervals after the pulse, labeled intracellular polypeptides were extracted. Cells were washed twice in PBS and solubilized with 1.0 ml/plate of 1% Nonidet P40 (NP40, Accurate Chemical Corp.) in PBS. Nuclei and debris were removed by centrifugation at 1800 Q for 10 min at 4". Radiolabeled polypeptides were analyzed directly by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) or were immunoprecipitated with rabbit antiserum against purified, detergent-disrupted virions in the presence of staphylococcal protein A prior to analysis by PAGE (Sturman et aL, 1980) . Samples for SDS-PAGE slab gels were heated at 37" for 30 min with an equal volume of sample treatment mixture composed of 6M urea, 4% SDS, and 0.05% bromphenol blue in 0.0625M Tris-chloride, pH 6.7. SDS-PAGE in cylindrical gels was performed using a high pH discontinuous buffer system and fractionation of gels with a Gilson automatic linear gel fractionator as previously described (Sturman and Holmes, 1977) . Five to twenty percent polyacrylamide gradient slab gels were prepared and fluorographed as previously described (Sturman et al 1980) . Anal@s of glycopeptides. The glycoproteins El and E2 were isolated from SDS-PAGE of gradient-purified MHV which had been grown for 24 hr in medium containing 3 &i/ml [3Hlglucosamine (New England Nuclear, Inc.). Isolated El and E2 were eluted from the gels, digested with 15 pg of self-digested Pronase (Sigma) per milliliter for 30 hr at 60", concentrated by lyophilization, and analyzed as borate esters by PAGE in Tris-borate buffer at pH 8.3 according to the method of Weitzman et al. (1979) . Electron microscopy. Concentrated, gradient-purified virions were prepared for electron microscopy using 2% phosphotungstic acid (PTA) at pH 7.2 on carboncoated, Formvar-covered, 400-mesh copper grids. Electron microscopy of cells was done by fixation with 1% glutaraldehyde followed by postfixation with 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydration in a graded series of ethyl alcohol solutions and propylene oxide, and embedding in Epon 812 resin as previously described (Compans et al, 1966) . Sections were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate and examined in a JEOL 1OOCX electron microscope.
