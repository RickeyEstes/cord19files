A standard linear regression between the Ct values and log TCID 50 /mL was generated after testing known viral TCID 50 /mL dilutions on the real-time RT-PCR: Y = 43.36 −3.51X, where Y = Ct value and X = log TCID 50 /mL. The maximum detectable Ct values by RT-PCR-pyroseq for the NA H275 codon ranged from 34.15 to 37.63, with an average detectable Ct value of 36.24 (Table 1) . Based on the above equation, the detectable Ct values were equivalent to a mean viral concentration of 107 (range, 43 to 417) TCID 50 / mL. The detection limits were from 1 to 8 TCID 50 (b1 to 6 plaque forming units [PFU]/mL; PFU/mL = TCID 50 /mL × 0.69) per reaction (average = 2). Testing with the validation panel from Diagnostic Hybrids produced a similar detection limit, reaching 6 viruses per reaction (data not shown). The RT-PCR-pyroseq inter-and intrarun assays on the same dilution group of 2009 H1N1 samples in the validation panel produced the same DNA amplicon size and sequence results. The RT-PCR-pyroseq method produced no amplicons or valid sequences from seasonal influenza A H1N1, non-influenza A viruses, or bacteria such as those tested in this study (Table 2 ) and detected H275Y in a 1:4-ratio mixture with an oseltamivir-susceptible 2009 H1N1 viral suspension.
