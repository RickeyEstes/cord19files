Expression of rHuMig in Escherichia coli. The HuMig cDNA (18) was cleaved with NlalV and PstI to give a 664-bp fragment that encoded the predicted HuMig protein minus the signal peptide, including residues 23-125 of the HuMig open reading frame. After making the PstI end blunt using T4 DNA polymerase, BamHI linkers were added and the fragment was inserted into the BamHI site of the pET-3b vector (20) 3' to a promoter for the T7 ILNA polymerase. The resulting plasmid was predicted to give rise to an mRNA encoding a fusion protein with the NH2-terminal 11 amino acids of the T7 bacteriophage gene 10 protein followed by three additional residues (1KDP) and followed in turn by HuMig residues 23-125, consisting of the entire predicted, secreted HuMig protein (18) . The gene 10 protein/ HuMig fusion protein was produced in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) as described by Studier et al. (20) . Expression of rHuMig in ClIO Cells. Using PstI, a 785-bp fragment containing the entire coding sequence of HuMig was excised from the pBluescript SK-phagemid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that contained HuMig cDNA (18) . The termini were made blunt using T4 DNA polymerase and XhoI linkers were added, and the fragment was inserted into the XhoI site of pMSXND (21) , 3' to a mouse genomic fragnlent containing the metallothionein I promoter and 5' to elements from the SV40 genome, including the small t antigen intron and the early region polyadenylylation sequence, pMSXND contains a mouse dihydrofolate reductase cDNA 3' to the early promoter of SV40 and a neomycin resistance gene 3' to a thymidine kinase promoter. CHO cells were proline auxotrophs (21) and were a kind gift from Se-Jin Lee, Johns Hopkins University. pMSXND DNA, containing the HuMig cDNA fragment in either the sense or the antisense orientation with respect to the metallothionein I promoter, was made linear by digestion with PvuI and was used to transfect CHO cells by the lipofectin method according to the manufacturer's protocol (GIBCO/BILL, Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were grown in 400 p~g/ml G418 (GIBCO/ BILL, Life Technologies) to eliminate nontransfected cells, followed by growth without G418 but with 0.2 p~M methotrexate 1Abbreviations used in this paper: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CM, carboxymethyl; MCP, monocyte chemotactic protein; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; rHuMig, recombinant human Mig; SDF, stromal cell-derived factor; TIL, tumorinfiltrating lymphocyte. (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in MEM supplemented with 11.5 p~g/ml proline and 10% dialyzed FCS (Sigma Chemical Co.). Methotrexate-resistant colonies were picked and analyzed for production of rHuMig by growing the cells in 100 nM cadmium sulfate, and subjecting supernatants to SDS-PAGE (22) followed by immunoblotting as described below. Cell line CHO/ H9 was derived from cells transfected with DNA having the HuMig cDNA in the sense orientation. Cell line CHO/IL5 was derived from cells transfected with DNA containing the HuMig cDNA in the antisense orientation. The CHO cell lines were not single-cell cloned. For collecting supernatants for protein purification, the rHuMig overexpressing CHO cells were cultured in MEM-(x (GIBCO/BILL, Life Technologies), supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS, 2 mM glutamine, and 0.2 btM methotrexate. When the cells became confluent, the culture medium was removed and replaced with serum-free MEM-~x with 100 nM cadmium sulfate, After 12-24 h, the medium was discarded and fresh serum-free medium with cadmium was added. The harvesting and refeeding were done each 24 h and continued for 7 d and the supematant from day 2 to day 7 was used as starting material for the purification of rHuMig. Production of HuMig Antisera. The gene 10 protein/HuMig fusion protein expressed in bacteria was used to raise rabbit antisera JH49 and JH50. Bacterial lysates containing the gene 10/ HuMig fusion protein were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The fusion protein was visualized using 0.05% Coomassie brilliant blue, the band excised, and the gel lyophilized and pulverized for injection. New Zealand White rabbits were injected subcutaneously with material containing 100-200 p,g of protein initially in complete, and subsequently in incomplete Freund's adjuvant, approximately once per month over 16 mo with regular bleeds. Antisera JH49 and JHS0 were used for immunoblotting. These antisera, raised against denatured rHuMig, were not efficient in immunoprecipitating HuMig, particularly the low-kD HuMig species (data not shown). To raise antisera 5092, a rabbit was injected with 100 bLg of the rHuMig high-kD species that had been purified from the overexpressing CHO/H9 cell line, and the rabbit was boosted with 60-100 p,g of the rHuMig high-kD species per month over 3 too. Antiserum 5092 was used successfully for immunoprecipitating the various forms of HuMig as described below. IgG was purified from rabbit serum using protein A-activated Acti-Disk cartridges (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) according to the manufacturer's protocol. SDS-PA GE, Silver Staining, and Immunoblotting. In general, samples were analyzed under reducing conditions using Tricine-SDS-PAGE and a 10-20% gradient gel (Jule Biotechnologies Inc., New Haven, CT) according to the method of Schagger and Von Jagow (23) . For the determination of apparent molecular weights, a Tris-glycine-SDS, 15% acrylamide gel was used according to Laemmli (22) . For immunoblotting, the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell Inc., Keene, NH) using a solution of 10 mM sodium bicarbonate, 3 mM sodium carbonate, pH 9.9/methanol of 8:2, in a TransBlot apparatus (Bio-iLad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) at 45 V for 7 h in the cold. The membranes were blocked with 50 mM Tris/HC1, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaC1, 0.1% Tween-20, and 10% milk (1-2% fat) and all incubations and washes were done in the presence of the blocking solution. Blots were incubated with rabbit anti-HuMig serum JH50 at a 1:1,000 dilution, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) at a 1 : 5,000 dilution, washed again, and visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL). The markers used routinely for the immunoblots were the prestained protein molecular weight standards from GIBCO/ BIKL, Life Technologies. The high-kD species of HuMig (see below) reproducibly comigrated with both prestained lysozyme as well as with lysozyme that had not been prestained. For this reason, the position of the prestained lysozyme on the immunoblots is designated as 14.3 kD, lysozyme's reported molecular mass, without regard to changes in the mobility of the marker due to prestaining. Silver staining of proteins was performed according to the method of Blum (24) . The markers used for silver-stained gels and for the determinations of apparent molecular weights were the Mark 12 wide-range proteins standards from Novel Experimental Technology (San Diego, CA).
