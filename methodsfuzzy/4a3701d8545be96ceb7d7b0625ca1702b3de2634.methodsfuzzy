Patients selection. We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of 356 patients between 11 days and 14 years, with suspected respiratory infection, evaluated at the Santobono Hospital of Naples, between 1 January 2016 and 31 January 2017, with FilmArray ® Respiratory Panel (FARP) testing on NasoPharyngeal Swab (NPS). From patient electronic medical records the following information was obtained: Demographics (age and sex), month of hospitalization, and geographical origin. We have divided the patients into three age groups (Early childhood, 0-2 years; preschool age, 2-5 years; third childhood: 5-11 years), in the season of hospitalization (winter: December, January, February; spring: March, April, May; summer: June, July, August; autumn: September, October, November) and geographical origin (metropolitan area of Naples and extra-urban areas). FilmArray testing. NPSs were collected according to a standard procedure, kept in viral transport medium, and stored at -20˚C prior to analysis. FARP (FilmArray ® Respiratory Panel BioFire Diagnostics LLC 390; Wakara Way Salt Lake City, UT, USA) is a test based on multiplex PCR. The FilmArray RP cartridge is designed for the simultaneous detection and identification of following viruses and bacteria of the upper respiratory tract: Influenza A virus (H1N1, H1N1 2009, and H3N2), influenza B virus, RSV, PIVs 1-4, ADV, HRV/enterovirus (the assay does not distinguish between these two pathogens), HMPV, HCoV (229E, HKU1, OC43, and NL63), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis. The FilmArray instrument and pouch system have been described in detail elsewhere (10) . The research use only version of the FilmArray RP system reported a cycle threshold for each positive PCR assay (11) . Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Viral prevalence were compared using the Chi-square test for categorical variables, and the cartogram was drawn using Excel software (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
