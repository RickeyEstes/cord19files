Two PUVL with the wavelengths of 355 and 266 nm, were produced by Q-switched Nd 3+ :YAG laser in its third and forth harmonic, respectively. The energy of each pulse for 355 nm was 12.7 mJ/cm 2 and for 266 nm was 35.2 mJ/cm 2 . BVDV were produced and titrated in MDBK cell line. MDBK and FBS were already checked for non-cytopathic or cytopathic pestiviruses, using related Ag-ELISA kit. BVDV suspended in solution with the dilution of 1:2 before exposure. The quartz tube with the minimum UV-absorption in compare with air, used as a container for exposed solutions. Calculation of the virus titer, 10 4.3 TCID 50 /ml, was done based on the Reed and Muench method. BVDV suspended in PBS was exposed into the 3.52-352 J/cm 2 of PUVLs with the wavelength of 355 nm and also, was exposed into the 1.27-92.25 J/cm 2 of PUVLs with the wavelength of 266 nm. Furthermore, BVDV suspended in FBS was exposed into the 88, 176, 352 and 704 J/cm 2 of PUVLs with the wavelength of 355 nm and also, was exposed into the 6. 35, 25.4, 63.5, 127 and 190 .5 J/cm 2 of PUVLs with the wavelength of 266 nm. Results: The minimum dose for inactivation of BVDV suspended in PBS with the 355 and 266 nm wavelengths of PUVLs, were 352 and 92.25 J/cm 2 , respectively. Also, the minimum dose for inactivation of BVDV suspended in FBS with the 355 and 266 nm wavelengths of PUVLs, were 704 and 127 J/cm 2 , respectively. To evaluate the FBS quality to support cell culture, treated FBS with the dose of 190.5 J/cm 2 of 266 nm PUVLs was used to grow Vero cell line in 12 successive passages. The viability of cells in two study groups was identical. The statistical evaluation of two treated groups showed no significant difference, in 12 passages. Conclusion: Because inexpensive equipment can be used to produce PUVLs capable of handling different volumes of biologics with operational ease, this viral inactivation technique is cost effective for relevant industries. The procedure has the potential to be combined synergically with other inactivation method. PUVLs offer a new, nonadditive and chemically safe alternative for the treatment of FBS to inactivate adventitious viruses and to preserve the biological activity necessary for the propagation of cell culture.
