All patients were admitted to the Respiratory Unit of the Persahabatan Hospital, a referral center for the diagnosis and treatment of human avian infl uenza. All patients with suspected infl uenza A(H5N1) infection had throat and nasal swabs (primary diagnostic respiratory samples) for analysis by real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR performed at the World Health Organization-approved reference laboratory of the National Institutes of Health Research and Development in Jakarta. This laboratory lacks a biosafety level 3 facility for viral culture. Rectal swabs, endotracheal aspirates, and pleural fl uid were also obtained from a small number of patients as part of their care. All 22 patients in this report were RT-PCRpositive for infl uenza A(H5N1) by throat swab. Patients were managed intensively in an isolation ward equipped with ventilators. Data were extracted retrospectively from patients' medical notes. We used standard defi nitions of acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS (ie, a Pa o 2 :F io 2 ratio of , 300 and , 200, respectively; bilateral CXR infi ltrates; and no evidence of left atrial hypertension. 17 Lung-protective ventilation was used for ventilated patients, consistent with the ARDS Network guidelines. 18 Presumptive evidence of a consumptive coagulopathy was defi ned as increased (greater than upper limit of normal [ULN]) D-dimer levels and prothrombin (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTT), and a platelet count , 150,000/ m L. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was determined using the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) score (platelet count, PT, fi brinogen and fi brinogen degradation). 19 A score Õ† 5 is overt DIC and , 5 nonovert DIC. Pleural fl uid was defi ned as an exudate if the LDH concentration was . 2/3 ULN of serum LDH (ULN = 200 IU/L) or the pleural fl uid-to-plasma ratios of: (1) total protein were . 0.5, or (2) LDH were . 0.6. 20 The Sepsis Organ-related Failure Assessment (SOFA) was used to assess admission illness severity (higher scores indicate greater severity). SOFA scores (up to 4 per organ system) respiratory (Pa o 2 :F io 2 ratio), liver (total bilirubin), and renal (creatinine) functions; level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Score); mean arterial BP; and coagulation (platelet count). 21 Ethical approval was not considered necessary for this retrospective study.
