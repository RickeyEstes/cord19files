Media . Tryptone broth contains per I : 10 g Bacto-tryptone (Difco), 5 g NaCl . Minimal growth medium contains Vogel-Bonner minimal salts 33 supplemented with 2 mg ml -' glycerol . Bacterial strains . Stools were collected from neonates in the Syracuse area at the onset of NEC symptoms . For each patient, the species of Enterobacteriaceae isolated on MacConkey lactose agar was either unique or by far the most predominant in the stool . These organisms were purified and designated DC1 to DC6 . Purified normal flora Enterobacteriaceae controls (DC7-DC12) were obtained from stools of healthy infants at the Westchester County Medical Center nursery, Valhalla, New York . All isolates were identified according to standard procedure using the Microscan system . DC4R is the original DC4 isolate . DC4W is a white segregant isolated upon subculturing of DC4R on MacConkey lactose agar . DC4R* is a red back segregant of DC4W obtained upon subculturing of DC4W on MacConkey lactose agar . Purity of strains DC4R, DC4W, and DC4R* was maintained by repeated subculture on MacConkey lactose agar . MR1, a wild-type K. pneumoniae laboratory strain and plasmid pCR100, 34 a pBR322 derivative containing the entire K. pneumoniae lactose operon, were obtained from Dr Monica Riley . Strain DC17 was isolated following ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis 35 of the wild type strain MR1, as follows . Mutagenized cells were grown overnight in phenyl-fl-galactoside to enrich for mutants constitutive in /3-galactosidase synthesis, 36 and individual clones with this phenotype were identified by plating on tryptone plates containing XGal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-fl-D-galactoside) . 36 One clone with high /3-galactosidase activity in the presence and absence of inducer, in both tryptone and minimal medium, was designated DC1 7 . Introduction of a wild type lactose operon in trans (by transformation of DC17 with plasmid pCR100) restores the normal inducible phenotype, suggesting that DC17 is most likely deficient in repressor synthesis . All strains were maintained in 60% glycerol at -20°C . 39 Prior to their use in the experiments described, freezer stocks were subcultured onto nutrient agar and the phenotype of individual colonies was verified . Enzyme assays . /3-galactosidase assays were performed on toluenized cells harvested during exponential growth at 37°C, as described by Miller ." Lactose permease specific activities were determined as described by Carter et al. 37 In this assay the rate of hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl-/3-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) is measured in intact cells poisoned with azide . Under these conditions the rate-limiting step is lactose permease mediated transport of ONPG into the cell . Specific activities are expressed in arbitrary units . Unless otherwise noted, induction of the lactose operon was achieved by growth in the presence of 1 mm IPTG . 35 Pathogenicity assays . The pathogenicity of bacterial strains was assayed according to Clark et al ." Weanling New Zealand white male rabbits were fasted for 8 h . Each rabbit was anesthetized with Ketamine (35 mg kg -1 ) and Xylazine (5 mg kg -') intramuscularly. The abdomen was shaved and cleansed for surgery . The peritoneum was opened and ligature was placed just distal to the ligament of Treitz . The intestine was then flushed with sterile saline and ligated into approximately 5 cm intestinal loops, with care being taken to preserve blood supply . These loops were then injected randomly using a 26 gauge needle with 1 ml per 2 cm of intestine of bacteria freshly grown in tryptone broth, diluted to 10 6 organisms per ml in proprietary infant formula . Control loops were injected with infant formula or saline alone . The peritoneum was closed and the animal was allowed to recover from anesthesia . 18 h later the animal was sacrificed by Ketamine anesthesia with blood letting, and the intestine was removed . The contents of each loop was drained into a syringe . Tissue and fluid were then studied histologically . Distention, mucosal thinning and hemorrhage were typical of a pathogenic response, and microscopy revealed mucosal disruption with villus destruction and a fibrinopurulent exudate . Non-pathogenic strains did not cause these symptoms . A typical strong pathogenic response (Grade 3) and a non-pathogenic response (Grade 0) are shown in Fig . 2 . Intermediate responses were scored using the following grading system : Grade 0 : villi completely intact (non-pathogenic response) ; Grade 1 : villous tip necrosis with preservation of villous crypts ; Grade 2 : necrosis of villous tip and crypts with loss of mucosal and submucosal architecture ; Grade 3 : necrosis extending into muscularis ; Grade 4 : transmural necrosis . The presence and extent of edema, lymphatic dilation, cell infiltration, hemorrhage and inflammation was also noted . Animal care was in accordance with institutional guidelines . Fractionation of tryptone . A measured volume of 20x sterile tryptone was dialyzed to equilibrium versus sterile distilled water to retain the >3000 molecular weight fraction . In a complementary experiment a measured volume of sterile water was dialyzed to equilibrium versus an excess of 20x sterile tryptone to collect the <3000 molecular weight fraction in the dialysis bag . Volume changes resulting from dialysis were taken in account in expressing the resulting fractions in tryptone concentration equivalents . Cloning methods . Plasmid DNA was prepared by the rapid alkaline lysis method of Birnboim and Doly . 38 Transformation was performed using the CaCl z method ." Lambda DNA was purchased from BRL . Restriction enzymes were obtained from IBI and restriction reactions were incubated overnight at 37°C in the buffers supplied by the manufacturer . DNA fragments were separated on 0 .7% agarose using the standard Tris-borate buffer system . 39 Gels were run at 50 V for 3 h and stained with ethidium bromide .
