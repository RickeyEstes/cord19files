Radioisotopes and fluorescent dyes are the two most common labeling methods for signal detection in protein microarray assays. Fluorescent dyes, such as Cy-3/5 and their equivalent, have been used as a popular labeling method. Because most good dyes have relatively narrow excitation and emission spectra, multicolor scheme can be readily implemented for simultaneous detection and direct comparison of different samples, both reducing cost and avoiding chip-to-chip variation. Semiconductor quantum dot labeling, which is brighter and more stable than organic dyes, has also been applied to protein microarrays (Shingyoji et al., 2005; Zajac et al., 2007) . In addition to fluorescent labeling, Huang (2001) detected multiple cytokines on an antibody array with enhanced chemiluminescence, providing an alternative detection method. Enzymatic signal amplification is also a valuable labeling method. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) has been developed for protein microarray assays. For low abundance protein samples, the sensitivity of traditional fluorescence or chemiluminescence detection is relatively low, whereas RCA can detect captured proteins at femtomole level and is promising to improve the sensitivity of fluorescent detection (Lizardi et al., 1998; Schweitzer et al., 2000; Schweitzer et al., 2002; Shao et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2004) . Tyramide signal amplification is another way to amplify signals with enzymes, which utilizes the horseradish peroxidase conjugated on secondary antibodies to convert the labeled substrates (tyramide) into short-lived extremely reactive intermediates, which then very rapidly react with and covalently bind to adjacent proteins (Varnum et al., 2004) . For certain types of biochemical assays, especially enzymatic reactions, use of radioisotopes is the only detection method available (see below for more details). They still offer the most sensitive and reliable detection of posttranslation modification events when there is a lack of high-quality and high-affinity detection reagents, such as antibodies. We and others have successfully applied 32 P-, 33 P-, and 14 C-labeled substrates to detect protein phosphorylation and acetylation events (Lin et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2011; Ptacek et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2009 ). One obvious disadvantage of label-dependent detection is the requirement of either manipulating structure of a probe or a specific antibody. It is not amenable to real-time label-free detection, which can provide important information when analyzing reaction dynamics. Therefore, label-free detection methods have also been investigated for protein microarrays. Optical techniques of various types are emerging as an important tool for mentoring the dynamics of biomolecule interactions on a solid surface. For instance, Imaging Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy (SPR) (Nelson et al., 1999; Thiel et al., 1997) , Imaging Optical Ellipsometry (OE) (Wang and Jin, 2003) , and Reflectometric Interference Spectroscopy (Piehler et al., 1997) are three label-free optical techniques that in essence measure the same optical dielectric response of a thin film and therefore detect changes of physical or chemical properties of the thin film, such as thickness and mass density during biochemical reactions. As compared with the above three methods, the oblique-incidence reflectivity difference (OIRD) technique is a more sensitive form of ellipsometry that measures the difference in reflectivity between sand p-polarized light (Chen et al., 2001; Landry et al., 2004) . Recently, the OIRD technique has been applied to detect DNA hybridization and protein-protein interactions in a microarray format in a real-time fashion, and these studies demonstrated its potential as a high-throughput detection method that can obtain association and dissociation rates of biomolecule interactions (Lu et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010) . This is an extremely sensitive detection method: it has a time resolution of 20 ms, a space resolution (i.e., thickness) of 0.4 nm, and a detection limit of 14 fg of protein per spot. In addition, it also shares other advantages of the SPR and OE methods, such as noncontacting damage-and label-free detection (Fei et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2010) . The principle of OIRD-based detection is illustrated in Fig. 4 .3. First, a p-polarized He-Ne laser beam (l ¼ 632.8 nM) passes through a photoelastic modulator to induce oscillation between pand s-polarization at a frequency of 50 kHz. Second, after passing through a phase shifter, the resultant beam is incident on the microarray surface at an oblique angle theta (q inc ). Finally, the first I(U) and second harmonics I(2U) of the reflected beam intensity are simultaneously monitored by two digital lock-in amplifiers (Lu et al., 2010) . The difference caused by changes in reflectivity between the sand p-polarized light, namely the OIRD signal, is Dp À Ds, composed of both real and imaginary components. Because the imaginary component, which is proportional to the first I(U), is more sensitive, the OIRD signal is determined as "Im{Dp À Ds}" (Formula I), which is dependent on the incident angle (q inc ) and the dielectric constants of the ambient, protein, and substrate of the microarray (i.e., glass) (Wen et al., 2010) .
