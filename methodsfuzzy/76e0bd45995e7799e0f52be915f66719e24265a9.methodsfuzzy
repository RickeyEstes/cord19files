Specificity: ICP-MS uses a special interface technique to incorporate the inductively coupled plasma with the quadrupole mass spectrum, involving a high temperature (8000 K) ionization source and a sensitive, rapid scanning mass detector. Compared with traditional element analysis methods, such as graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF-AAS) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), ICP-MS provides improved sensitivity and selectivity and is very suitable for pharmacokinetic studies. In addition, ICP-MS can satisfy all the detection requirements of inorganic element analysis and the limit of detection can achieve the level of sub ppt, and it also has the ability to determine many elements at the same time. The LOD and LOQ: The concentration of W in the blank plasma sample was detected. The LOD and LOQ, indicators of the sensitivity of the assay, were found to be 0.002 and 0.008 ng/ mL, respectively. Standard curves and linear ranges: The calibration curves were all linear with regression correlation coefficients(r) .0.999. The curve equations and correlation coefficients of plasma, tissues, urine, feces and bile were as follows: plasma: y = 9218.01x+128.70, r = 0.99961; liver: y = 8201.12x+77.93, r = 0.99982; fat: y = 8055.85x+105.55, r = 0.99966; skeletal muscle: y = 7506.4x+ 18.06, r = 0.99999; urine: y = 8217.29x+29.57, r = 0.99997; feces: y = 10091x+36.14, r = 0.99997; bile: y = 13897.3x+51.74, r = 0.99997. The linear ranges were 0.05,100 ng/mL. The precision and accuracy: The intra-day and inter-day precision (expressed as RSD%) and accuracy (expressed as RE%) of the assay are shown in Table 1 . Both intra-and inter-day precisions and accuracies are within acceptable limits (i.e., less than 15% for RSD% and RE%) for low QC, medium QC and high QC samples (8) . Overall, the intra-day accuracy and precision for the assay were in the ranges 28.861,12.74% and 0.581,5.198%, respectively. The corresponding values for the inter-day runs were similar, giving a precision of 0.860,5.047%. Recovery: The results of recovery are shown in Table 2 . The mean recoveries in rat plasma, tissues, urines, feces and bile for the low, middle and high QC samples were all approximately 100%, which demonstrates that the recovery is high.
