Culturing and treatment of the cells hiPSCs (IMR90-1) was purchased form WiCell. Cells were cultured on feeder free conditions using Matrigel (Corning) for cell attachment. Under these conditions hiPSC colonies were grown in mTeSR media (STEMCELL technologies) and maintained at 37˚C in a CO 2 incubator. For cell passage, cell colonies were dissociated to the appropriate size cell aggregate using nonenzymatic reagent (ReLeSR; STEMCELL technologies). Confluent cell colonies were treated with the indicated concentrations of SA, H 2 O 2 , and emetine (all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) at 37˚C in a CO 2 incubator as previously described [5] . For HS treatment, plates were tightly sealed with Parafilm to ensure the maintenance of optimum CO 2 levels within the plates and then incubated in the oven for the desired time and temperatures. Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) were purchased from ATCC and were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 at 37˚C.
