Broilers used in the experiment were handled in accordance with published guidelines [10]. Two hundred forty 1-d-old Ross × Ross 308 male broilers (BW = 33.6 g) [11] were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 experimental treatments blocked by initial BW. Treatments included a control (no plasma) and 2 forms of SDP (powder, AP 920; granular, Appetein) fed continuously throughout the experiment or discontinued after d 14 (Table  1) . Diets were formulated to meet or exceed nutrient requirements for broilers [12] . The feeding program consisted of 3 phases, with starter from d 0 to 14, grower from d 15 to 28, and finisher from d 29 to 35 of the experiment. Spray-dried plasma [7] was produced according to standard manufacturing procedures and added at the rate of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25% in the starter, grower, and finisher diets, respectively. Feed was manufactured according to standard procedures at Kansas State University [13] ( Table 2 ). In all diets, 1% fat was added before pelleting, with the remaining fat added after pelleting. Diets were pelleted at a 85°C conditioning temperature using a 0.40 × 3.18 cm die and a conditioning retention time of 15 s. Starter diets were crumbled. From d 0 to 3, feed was offered ad libitum in trays (729 cm 2 ), followed by hanging gravity-flow feeders [14] . The hanging feeders were adjusted regularly to maintain optimal height for feed consumption. Water was delivered via free-standing 3.8-L poultry founts. The founts were washed daily and refilled with fresh water. Broilers (6 per pen; 8 pens per treatment) were housed in floor pens (56 × 122 cm). Pens contained soiled litter (softwood shavings used in 3 consecutive experiments), resulting in a high pathogen load environment. Following removal of broilers from the previous experiments, all pens were raked, allowed to dry (2 d), and caked dry litter was removed. The remaining litter was mixed with new litter and leveled to an average depth of 10 cm. Heat lamps maintained average temperatures at bird levels of 32, 29, 27, and 24°C for wk 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the end, respectively. Broilers were maintained on 23L:1D. Vaccinations prehatch were half a dose of Marek's and, before shipping, half a dose of Newcastle and Bronchitis. On d 7, all birds were vaccinated with Bursal Disease Vaccine [15] via the water, and on d 14, they were vaccinated with Newcastle-Bronchitis Vaccine [16] by coarse spray. Feed intake and mortality were measured daily. Pen weight was measured daily to d 7 and weekly thereafter. Individual BW were measured on d 0. Data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design using the GLM procedures of SAS [17] . Pen was the experimental unit, and placement within room of the facility was the blocking criterion. Least squares means were considered significantly different if P < 0.05.
