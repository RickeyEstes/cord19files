Although it is lacking a robust evidence-base, 216 airway clearance techniques (encompassing various types of chest physiotherapy) are recommended in children and adults. 190, 196 Available studies suggest that airway clearance techniques are beneficial with improved QoL and exercise capacity and reduced cough and sputum volumes. 216 Thus daily chest physiotherapy is recommended in a form that maximizes potential benefit and minimizes burden of care. In the past, postural drainage was standard therapy for children with CSLD/bronchiectasis. However, this treatment may increase gastroesophageal reflux and possible aspiration. 217 Given the availability of multiple techniques for airway clearance and the lack of clear superiority of any one technique, specific choices should be individualized and pediatric-specific physiotherapist expertise sought. In addition, children with bronchiectasis should be encouraged to participate in exercise activities.
