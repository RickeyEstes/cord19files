Cell culture and differentiation WRN −/− hMSCs and LMNA G608G/+ hMSCs were obtained via the directed differentiation of WRN −/− hESCs and LMNA G608G/+ hESCs that we previously established Zhang et al., 2015) . hESCs were maintained on mitomycin C-inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder in hESC culture medium containing 80% DMEM/F12 (Gibco), 20% Knockout Serum Replacement (Gibco), 10 ng/mL FGF2 (Joint Protein Central), 0.1 mmol/L non-essential amino acids (NEAA, Gibco), 2 mmol/L GlutaMAX (Gibco) and 55 μmol/L β-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen). hESCs used in this study were also cultured on Matrigel (BD Biosciences) with mTeSR medium (STEMCELL Technologies). The human MSCs were cultured in hMSC culture medium containing 90% α-MEM + Glutamax (Gibco), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gemcell, Lot b Figure 9 .

Alleviating premature aging by quercetin RESEARCH ARTICLE A77E01F), 1 ng/mL FGF2 (Joint Protein Central) and 1% penicillin/ streptomycin (Gibco). Differentiation of hESCs into mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was performed as described previously (Duan et al., 2015; Fu et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018a; Wang et al., 2018b; Zhang et al., 2015) . Briefly, embryoid bodies were cultured in matrigel-coated plates with hMSC differentiation medium (α-MEM with GlutaMAX (Gibco), 10% FBS (Gemcell, Lot A77E01F), 10 ng/mL FGF2 (Joint Protein Central), 5 ng/mL TGFβ (Stemimmune LLC) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco)). After about 10 days, the confluent MSC-like cells were passaged on gelatin-coated plate and cultured in hMSC culture medium containing 90% α-MEM with Glutamax (Gibco), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gemcell, Lot A77E01F), 1 ng/mL FGF2 (Joint Protein Central) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco).
