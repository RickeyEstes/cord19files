Supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through SFB74-Cl. The open reading frame (ORF) L1 of papillomaviruses is highly conserved and codes for the major capsid protein. This protein carries group-specific and type-specific antigenic determinants. We have cloned a 600 bp HaeIII-fragment from the central, less conserved part of ORF L1 of human papillomavirus 8 into a procaryotic expression vector, which gives rise to a~-gal-fusi on protein. A guinea-pig antiserum against this protein was tested with antigens from different wart biopsies using indirect immunofluorescence tests and Western blotting, It detectedcapsid proteins of HPV8 and of HPV5, 9, and 17, which are all closely related with,HPV8. The antiserum did not react with structural antigens of HPVl or HPV3. This indicates that the central part of HPV8 L1 reveales antigens, which are common to viruses associated with epidermodysplasia verruciformis. In contrast, group-specific antigens appear to be encoded by the 5' and 3' -parts of ORF Ll ,
