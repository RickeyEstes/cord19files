Most fluid specimens contain a high concentration of salt which, if allowed to dry on the specimen grid, will crystallize and obliterate viral particles during EM examination. To circumvent this problem, a simple dialysis method can be used for specimens that contain at least 10 9 virus particles per milliliter (Doane et al., 1969) . One microdrop of specimen is placed on a drop of sterile distilled water resting on a waxed surface. A coated grid is touched briefly to the surface of the drop. Negative stain is then added, excess fluid is removed with filter paper, and the grid is airdried and examined. This is a modification of the method of Kelen et al. (1971) . It is useful for salty specimens, especially when the virus concentration is low (Anderson and Doane, 1972b) . The limit of detectability by the agar diffusion method is approximately 10 7 virus particles per milliliter of original sample. Cups of disposable microtiter plates are approximately threefourths filled with 1% aqueous Noble agar, and a 300-mesh coated specimen grid is placed on the solid agar surface of each cup. Plates so prepared can be used immediately, or they can be covered tightly with strips of adhesive sealing tape and stored at 4°C for several weeks. To prepare a specimen for examination, one to two drops are added to a grid and allowed to air-dry (15-30 minutes). A drop of negative stain is then added. After 1 minute the grid is removed with forceps, aid-dried briefly, and examined by EM. Tissue specimens not exceeding 1 mm in thickness are collected in cold 2.5% glutaraldehyde in Millonig phosphate buffer. A minimum of 15 minutes is allowed for fixation; however, tissues can safely be stored in glutaraldehyde for several days. Primary fixation is followed by three rinses (1 minute each) in phosphate buffer, and a second fixation of 15 minutes at room temperature in 1% osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer. Fixed specimens are dehydrated through acetone as follows: 70% acetone, two changes in 3 minutes; absolute acetone, three changes in 5 minutes. After 10 minutes in a 1:1 mixture of absolute acetone and epoxy embedding plastic (either Spurr's medium, or a mixture of Araldite and Epon), followed by two changes of 100% plastic (5 minutes each), the specimen is placed in fresh plastic in an embedding capsule and heated to 95°C for 60 minutes to achieve polymerization of the plastic. The total processing time is 2 hours. Embedded tissue processed by this method can be trimmed for sectioning within 15 minutes after removal from the oven. Thin sections can be cut with either glass or diamond knives, and are collected on uncoated 300-mesh copper specimen grids prior to staining with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. Negative staining methods used for screening cell cultures are similar to those described in Section V. For thin sectioning, cells are fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer, followed by 1% osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer, dehydrated either with acetone or alcohol, and embedded in epoxy resin, either by standard EM histological procedures or by the rapid embedding method (Section IV,B). Cultures to be checked by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for mycoplasma contamination are grown on glass cover slips, preferably for several days, to allow the mycoplasma (if present) to become well established. They are then processed by the following method: cultures are fixed at 4°C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for at least 18 hours. They are then rinsed in three changes of 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, and immersed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Fixed cultures are then rinsed in cacodylate buffer, passed through 5-minute changes of 50, 70, and 95% alcohol, three changes of absolute alcohol, then quickly transferred to a critical point dryer, where they are dried by passing through the critical point of C0 2 . In preparation for SEM examination, dried cover slips are mounted on SEM stubs by means of silver paint, and coated with gold-palladium. The most commonly used method for serotyping by IEM is the direct mixing of virus and serum, recommended by Almeida and Waterson (1969) . The viral antigen is reacted at 37°C for 1 hour with an equal volume of antiserum, then left overnight at 4°C. The following morning the mixture is spun at 10,000 rpm fori hour to sediment immune complexes. For smaller viruses, e.g., picornaviruses, centrifugation of at least 15,000 rpm is recommended, whereas vaccinia-antibody complexes will sediment using a clinical-type bench centrifuge. The resultant pellet is usually resuspended in a small volume of distilled water prior to negative staining and examination in the electron microscope. Some workers have shortened the entire procedure to 1 hour incubation at 37°C (Lutton, 1973; Vassal and Ray, 1974; Doane, 1974) . Edwards et al. (1975) and Valters et al. (1975) described a more sensitive indirect IEM method, whereby the virus-antibody complexes were further aggregated by anti-immune globulin sera (anti-IgG). When applied to serotyping of adenoviruses, it was from 4 to over 32 times more sensitive than the direct method, indicating its value not only in differentiation of viruses, but also as a sensitive method for revealing new viruses (e.g., when used with patients' serum). The indirect method, as used by Valters et al. (1975) for detecting adenovirus type 7 in throat swab specimens (and which identified 19 out of 25 adenovirus-positive specimens), is as follows: ί ml of diluted adenovirus antiserum was mixed with an equal volume of throat swab fluid and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C and then for 3 hours at 6°C. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 minutes, and the pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. An equal volume of anti-IgG serum, diluted to the optimal concentration (as determined by a chess board titration of adenovirus type 7 antiserum and anti-IgG) was added, and this mixture was incubated at 6°C for 16 to 20 hours. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 minutes, the pellet was suspended in 0.1 ml of distilled water, negatively stained, and examined by EM. Kelen et al. (1971; Kelen and McLeod, 1974) have described a practical microtechnique for demonstrating hepatitis Β antigen-antibody complexes and for serotyping myxoviruses and paramyxoviruses. Virus and antiserum are incubated together at 37°C for i hour. A microdrop of the mixture is then deposited on the surface of a standard microscope slide that has previously been covered with 5 ml of 0.8% agar. Immediately thereafter, a Formvar-carbon coated grid is placed upside down and left floating on top of the drop. When diffusion of the fluid phase into the agar is complete (a matter of a few minutes), the grid is removed for negative staining and EM examination. Specimens prepared by the ADF method are both partially purified and concentrated, the agar acting as a molecular sieve and effectively removing interfering salts, maeromolecules, and tissue debris of 15 nm in diameter, while retaining the virus particles on the surface. A further modification of the ADF method has been developed by Anderson and Doane (1973) for serotyping of enteroviruses by IEM. In this method, the antisera are incorporated in the agar itself. Dilutions of single or pooled typing sera are added to a cooled (56°C) molten solution of 1% aqueous agar, which is then pipetted into the cups of disposable microtiter plates. Once the agar has solidified at room temperature, Formvar-carbon coated grids are placed on the agar surface. Viral specimens to be typed by IEM are added to the grids in volumes of 1 to 2 microdrops, and allowed to air-dry (approximately 30 minutes). Preparations are then negatively stained and examined by electron microscopy. The SIA method is rapid and simple to perform, and requires only small quantities of virus and serum. Although the antisera are contained within the agar itself, homologous antibodies apparently diffuse rapidly into the viral specimen, resulting in the formation of immune complexes. The sensitivity and specificity of this method for enterovirus typing has been found to be comparable to that obtained using the direct method. From a practical point of view, however, the SIA method is more useful in that cups can be stored at 4°C for several months prior to use, and cups containing diffeïent types of antisera can be color-coded for reference.
