2.1. Tissue collection and RNA extraction P. alecto bats were trapped in Southern Queensland, Australia, and transported alive by air to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Victoria, where they were euthanized for dissection using methods approved by the AAHL animal ethics committee. Tissues were stored at −80 • C in RNAlater (Ambion). Total RNA was extracted from frozen P. alecto tissues using a Precellys 24 tissue homogeniser (Bertin technologies) and an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNase-I treatment (Qiagen) to remove traces of genomic DNA. Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) harvested from P. alecto blood by density centrifugation, using lymphoprep (Axis-Shield) and an RNeasy mini kit with on-column DNase-I treatment, but using Qiashredders (Qiagen) for homogenisation. Quantification of nucleic acids was carried out by absorption spectrometry. 2.2. PCR, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), cloning and DNA sequencing PCR and RACE primers were designed using Clone Manager 9.0 (Sci-Ed Software) and are listed in Table 1 . Total spleen RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) and full-length amplification was performed using Long-amp DNA polymerase (New England Biosystems). 5 and 3 RACE were performed using a GeneRACER kit (Invitrogen). PCR and RACE products were cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit for sequencing (Invitrogen). M13 forward and M13 reverse primers were employed for DNA sequencing using a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v3.1 (Applied Biosystems) and an Applied Biosystems 3130 XL Genetic Analyser.
