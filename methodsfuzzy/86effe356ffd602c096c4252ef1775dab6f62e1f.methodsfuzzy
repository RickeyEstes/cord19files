Obviously, the information that we can obtain from ultrathin sections of a certain region of interest (ROI) of an infected cell is limited. Since ultrathin sections with a common average size of 200 ¢ 250 µm contain normally the profiles of several cross-sectioned cells, this limitation can be overcome even by conventional TEM when analyzing intracellular events that occur with high frequency. Moreover, even in case of relatively low rates of infection it is possible to find infected cells among these cell profiles when the virus-induced phenotype is rather striking and known. However, interpreting the 3D organization of a structure from such 2D sections is difficult and most often leads to a "simplification" of much more complex structures [89] . Furthermore, depending how these objects are sectioned conflicting interpretations can arise [90] . Thus, for a correct interpretation of a 3D structure all components must be recognizable in the section [14] . Therefore, gaining access to the ultrastructural information contained in thick sections or -ideally-in the whole volume of an infected cell is essential. Several approaches have been developed to gain 3D information of cellular structures by EM ( Figure 4 ). In the following sections these approaches and their applications to study viral infection (summarized in Table 1 ) are described.  An alternative to the analysis of resin-embedded cells (plastic-EM) is the analysis of unstained, frozen-hydrated cells (cryo-EM), in which the contrast is formed exclusively by the density of the biological material itself [184, 185] (Figure 4) . However, vitrified specimens have low inherent contrast (that can be partially overcome with the use of better detectors) and are electron-dose sensitive. Due to these challenging aspects, cryo-EM is not as widely used as plastic-EM, but in returns yields datasets with very high resolution, disclosing molecular details of the cellular landscape.
