Animals and rites. MHVfree C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used in all studies . MHVJHM, originally obtained from Dr. S. Weiss (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA), was plaque purified and grown as previously described (12) . Surgery. 28 4-wk-old mice were anesthetized with ketamine (200 mg/kg) . The hair over the frontal and nasal bones were removed with Nair (Carter Products, Inc., New York, NY), and lidocaine (1%) was administered subcutaneously. Unilateral bulbectomy was performed essentially as described by Whitten (17) . A 1-cm incision was made in the skin -0.5 cm caudal to the eyes. A small hole was made in the frontal bone overlying the olfactory bulb and dura, and the left olfactory bulb was gently aspirated. The skin was closed with a single suture . The surgical survival rate was 71% (20/28 ) . An additional three mice died over the next 2 d, leaving 17 mice that could be evaluated . After the mice were killed, the completeness of the bulb removal was estimated to be 90% or better by visual inspection, with only occasional, minimal destruction of other parts of the brain . After 24 h, 9 x 104 PFU MHVJHM were inoculated into each nostril after light anesthesia with methoxyflurane (Pitman-Moore, Inc., Washington Crossing, NJ) . Brains were removed from mice at 4 d (six mice) or 5 d (11 mice) post-infection, and individual halves were prepared for in situ hybridization as previously described (18) . In Situ Hybridization . In situ hybridization was performed on frozen sections using a'sS-labeled antisense RNA probe, as previously described' (18) , except that slides were pretreated with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) before section placement . The RNA probe was complementary to MHV genes 5 and 6 and to 200 bases of genes 4 and 7 . Slides were analyzed both by exposure to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) and by emulsion autoradiography (Kodak NTB-2 track emulsion) . A negative (uninfected brain) and a positive (brain from a mouse with acute encephalitis) control were analyzed in each experiment . No signal was detected by film autoradiography when sections from uninfected mice were analyzed.
