Small hairpin RNAs interference and lentivirus construct. We used pGLV-U6-EGFP (pGLV1-1) containing U6 expression cassette, an RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription of shRNA transcript. This vector also expressed green fluorescent protein from a cytomegalovirus promoter, which allowed for monitoring of the transfection efficiency. Small hairpin RNAs were designed to contain 21-nucleotide sense sequences identical to the target molecule(s), followed by a short (7-nucleotide) nonspecific loop sequence and an antisense sequence, followed by two thymidines, which served as a stop signal for RNA polymerase III. The TACE target sequence consisted of 4 duplex sequences of target-specific 21nt siRNAs including: 5′ -atagagccactttggagattt-3′ , 5′ -ggatttaaaggttatggaata-3′ , 5′ -ggacttcttcagtggacatgt-3′ , 5′ -ggaacacttcatgggacaatg -3′ in TACE splice variant. As a control, we used 21-nucleotide scrambled small hairpin RNA, which did not give more than an 18-nucleotide match against any rabbit genomic sequence. The oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into pGLV1-1 between the HpaI and XhoI sites. The vector was transfected into 293T cells together with the viral packaging vectors by GenePhama, Shanghai, China.
