Developments in techniques from molecular biology enable studies of virus latency that were not possible 20 years ago. We know that DNA is transcribed into RNA, and that RNA becomes protein. The continuous production of increased amounts of IgG in the brain (figure 1) and CSF in MS suggest the presence of an antigen (probably a protein) against which the IgG is directed. The RNA from which this protein was translated could be used to identify the putative unique MS antigen. RNA can be readily extracted from the brain of patients with MS. Although RNA degrades quickly, it can be reverse-transcribed into cDNA, which are stable molecules. There are many methods by which cDNA libraries of a brain, containing all genes expressed in that brain, can be used to identify genes and RNA unique to disease. For example, the ability to prepare and characterise libraries of genes from human tissue has allowed the isolation of cDNA clones derived from hepatitis C virus (HCV) without prior knowledge of the virus, the viral genome, or the presence of circulating viral antibodies. 73 Abundance of HCV-specific RNA in total liver RNA of infected animals is 0Â·00001%. 73 Combined cloning in expression vectors (even without subtraction hybridisation) and immunological screening of about a million recombinant phages (prepared from a cDNA library derived from infectious material and constructed in bacteriophage) led to the identification of an HCV-specific antigen. Some of these strategies have been applied in MS research. Cloning of IgG in brain and CSF in MS has shown over-represented (identical) heavy-chain sequences expressed at many plaque sites. 74 Normally, the sequence of every heavy-chain and light-chain antibody is different. Alignment of the heavy-chain sequences to their closest germline counterparts showed clonal amplification and extensive somatic mutationfeatures of an antigen-driven response. 74, 75 Comparison of the IgG heavy-chain sequences in MS and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis again showed features of an antigen-driven response in both diseases. Because the antigen in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is known to be measles virus, the parallel findings in MS suggest an antigen-driven immune response 76 rather than a non-conventional mechanism of B-cell activation. Furthermore, the antigen-driven clonal B-lymphocyte and plasma-cell response has been found after a single clinically isolated syndrome, 77, 78 which suggests that detection of the disease-relevant antigens in early CNS demyelination may bear on the inciting antigens in MS. Further analysis of the specificity of IgG in brain and CSF has the potential to identify an infectious agent in MS. Drugs of the interferon beta family are among the most widely used to treat MS. These drugs are presumed to have immunomodulatory effects, but they could also be antiviral because interferons are produced by cells hours after virus infection.
