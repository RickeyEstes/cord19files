The antibacterial activity of phenolic extracts was evaluated via the paper disc agar diffusion method reported by Özer et al. (2007) , with some modifications. The test solution was prepared by dissolving 5 mg/mL crude extracts in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Penicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol (10 µg/mL) were used as positive controls and DMSO solution as the negative control. The zone of inhibition was measured in millimeters. The diameters of the inhibition zone (DIZ) were ranked as follows: not sensitive (−) for zone diameters equal to 8 mm or below, sensitive (+) for zone diameters between 8 and 14 mm, very sensitive (++) for zone diameters between 14 and 20 mm (Schroeder and Messing, 1949; Ponce et al., 2003) . Inhibition zones were calculated as the average values from triplicate experiments.
