Data were analysed using the SAS V8.2 software. Statistical significance between vaccine groups for data describing the population's baseline characteristics was calculated using the Student's t-test and the chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test where necessary.

Paired ttests were performed to assess the difference between preand post-vaccination GMTs within each vaccine group. A
