We used the Illumina HumanQuad610 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego) to determine genotypes for 620,901 linkage disequilibrium bin-tagging polymorphisms and copy number variation (CNV) markers. Approximately 500 ng of genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples was used for each subject. Each sample was whole-genome amplified, fragmented, precipitated, and resuspended in hybridization buffer. Denatured samples were next hybridized on BeadChips for 16 hours at 48uC, the single base extension reaction performed, and the chip stained and imaged on an Illumina Bead Array Reader. Normalized intensity data for each sample were loaded into Illumina Beadstudio 2.0 and genotypes called using the manufacturer's clustering algorithm. Gender was checked using built-in controls. Clusters were checked for separation, deviation from Hardy-Weinberg, and lack of variation (mono-morphism). Genotypes that did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, demonstrated .95% call rate, and a minimum quality score determined by the manufacturer's software, were eligible for statistical association analyses. SNP imputation was also performed on the discovery cohort using the Markov Chain Haplotyping (MACH) software (http://www.sph. umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MaCH/index.html) for genotype imputation on markers that are not present in the genotyping platform used. The software version 1.0.16 was used in the study, and the default two-step procedure was adopted for imputation. The software requires several input files for SNPs and phased haplotypes, so we used the HapMap phased haplotypes (release 22) on HapMap Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe (CEU) subjects, as downloaded from the HapMap database (http://www.hapmap.org). We analyzed the mlinfo file generated from the imputation process and used the recommended R 2 threshold of 0.3 to flag unreliable markers used in imputation analysis, and removed these markers from association tests. We also analyzed the mlqc file, which provides a pergenotype posterior probability for each imputed call, and we used the 0.9 threshold to flag unreliable calls (by recoding them as NoCall genotype). In total, 2,487,415 imputed autosomal markers (out of 2.54 million markers with phase information in HapMap CEU population) passed quality control for the ALI cohort. We have included all loci with p,0.01 in Phase 1 in Supplemental  Table S2 .
