2.1. Cloning of SARS-CoV M pro and construction of plasmid pET SVMP SARS-CoV (strain HKU39849) RNA was extracted from cell lysates of virus-infected Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cell line) by TRIZOL (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using Thermoscript RT-PCR system purchased from Invitrogen. The full-length cDNA was subsequently amplified by PCR using forward primer SVMPF (5 0 -CGCGGATCCGATCGAAGGTCGTAGTGGTTTTAGGAAA-ATG-3 0 ) and reverse primer SVMPR (5 0 -CGGAATTCTTATTG-GAA-GGTAACACCAGA-3 0 ). PCR product was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), digested with BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonucleases, ligated to BamHI-EcoRI-digested pET28b DNA (Novagen), and transformed into E. coli DH5a cells by electroporation to generate pET SVMP. The nucleotide sequence of the SARS-CoV M pro gene in plasmid pET SVMP was sequenced to confirm that no undesired mutation has been introduced. The construct was designed in a way that a factor Xa cleavage site was engineered in the N-terminus of the SARS-CoV M pro (His-Tag. . .IEGR # SGFRKM. . .; the factor Xa cleavage site is indicated with a # and the released Nterminal part of the SARS-CoV M pro is bolded). Cleavage with factor Xa releases the His-tag and yields recombinant SARS-CoV M pro with authentic SARS-CoV M pro amino acid sequence. The identity of the purified SARS-CoV M pro was determined by mass spectrometry (Genome Research Centre, the University of Hong Kong).
