Small CQ-NP were successfully prepared using the parameters selected for the nanoprecipitation method. For each experiment B-NP were produced using the same experimental parameters in absence of drug. The NP <250 nm with negative zeta potential and narrow particle size distribution (PdI < 0.2) were identified for tested formulations (Table 1) . Three different CQ:PLA ratios were tested (Formulations 1-3) using the same slightly acid aqueous phase (pH = 6.4). However, EE% levels less than 11% were identified for these samples, which decreased according to the CQ: PLA ratio (from 10.6% to 3.4%). In addition, the zeta potential becomes more negative (from −3.13 mV to −14.42 mV). Due to the pH-dependent solubility character of the CQ, two alkaline aqueous phases were tested aiming to improve the EE% (Formulations 4 and 5) ( Table 1 ). Using 0.1 M NaOH as alkalizing agent (Formulation 4), it was possible to achieve an EE% of about 11.4%. On the other hand, the Formulation 5, produced using 0.5 M NaHCO 3 , induced an EE% of about 25%.  In this approach, an adjusted emulsification-solvent evaporation method was used, applying a small-scale liquid-liquid partition to provide the maximum concentration of chloroquine free base (CQ-fb) in the organic phase. All experiments have the CQ-fb amount in organic phase analytically controlled using UV spectrophotometry. An average level of 97.51% of CQ-fb dissolved in the DCM was achieved. NP < 300 nm with negative zeta potential and PdI of about 0.3 were produced using the selected parameters ( Table 2 ). The strategy to induce CQ-fb in an immiscible organic phase structured as droplets dispersed in an alkaline 0.5M NaHCO 3 aqueous solution (pH = 8.4) provided an excellent EE% of 64.1%. This formulation (formulation 6) was then selected for further studies.
