Although nasopharyngeal aspirate is considered the best specimen for detection of influenza viruses [41] , we opted for pharyngeal (throat) and nasopharyngeal swabbing to reduce patients discomfort and performance easiness. In children nasal swabs are comparable to that of nasopharyngeal aspirates for the detection of all major respiratory viruses, except RSV [42] . In adults, swabbing has been used to study respiratory virus disease [43, 44] , and IVE [14, 18, 40, 45, 46] . We obtained a yield of positives similar to other studies on hospitalized adults [16, 43] , and the timing of the epidemic wave and types and subtypes we identified were consistent with those reported by Spain's surveillance system [47] . Swabbing is a reliable and convenient alternative to obtain specimens for RT-PCR testing [42] , and accounting for days elapsed from symptoms onset to swabbing, should limit the effect of misclassification of true positives as negatives [10, 15] .
