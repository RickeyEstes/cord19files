Twelve adult patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia participated in the study (Table I) . Two patients had XLA, and 10 had common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Their ages ranged from 32 to 79 years (median, 47.5 years). CVID was characterized by decreased serum immunoglobulin levels (>2 SDs less than the age-adjusted mean), defective in vitro antibody formation, and exclusion of other known causes of humoral immune defects. The diagnosis of XLAwas based on early-onset, very low serum immunoglobulin concentrations; male sex; and a lack of circulating mature B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and mutation analysis of the Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene. 5 All patients were receiving regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy (dose, 400-600 mg/kg/mo). The trough serum IgG concentration was greater than 5 g/L in all patients; 9 patients had serum IgG levels of 6.0 g/L or greater. No patients were receiving prophylactic antibiotic treatment at the beginning of the study. All patients were nonsmokers. Eleven spouses of the 12 patients served as healthy control subjects. In 3 families there were school-aged children. One of the patients was a widow and lived alone. respiratory tract infections. The study was carried out at Turku University Hospital, Finland. Informed consent was obtained from the patients and healthy control subjects, and the study was approved by the Joint Commission on Ethics of the Turku University Hospital and the University of Turku. The primary outcome variable was an acute episode of respiratory tract infection (the common cold) defined on the basis of new symptoms (ie, excessive sneezing, sore throat, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, and cough). The secondary outcome variable was viral cause of this acute respiratory episode. We searched for 15 viruses: adenovirus; coronaviruses OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63; enteroviruses; human bocavirus; human metapneumovirus; influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza type 1, 2, and 3 viruses; rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). At the first visit and follow-up visits every 3 months, patients were examined (L.K.). Four nasal swabs were taken, and the patients provided induced sputum samples. At the onset of respiratory tract infection, the patients were asked to contact the investigator (L.K.) if they presented with new symptoms of respiratory tract infection. The patient was examined (L.K.) within 2 days. Three nasal swabs were taken, and the patients provided an induced sputum sample. Enteroviral and rhinoviral PCR, as well as viral and bacterial cultivation, were performed from the swab and sputum specimens. If rhinoviral PCR results were positive in the nasal swab samples, sputum samples, or both, new nasal swabs were taken every 2 weeks until rhinoviral RNA results became negative. The research nurse taught the patient to take nasal swabs at home, and swabs were sent in vials by post to the laboratory. 6 If the bacterial culture of the sputum sample was positive, the patient received antibiotic treatment. A new induced sputum sample was taken after the antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic treatment was also given in some patients with bacterial culture-negative acute infections. Samples from healthy control subjects. If the spouse of the patient had acute symptoms of respiratory tract infection, she or he took nasal swabs at home according to the instructions of the research nurse and sent the vials by post. In cases in which the rhinoviral RNA results were positive, new nasal swabs were taken every 2 weeks until they became negative. Symptom diary. Patients and spouses completed a common symptom diary, recording fever, nasal discharge, cough, sputum amount and color, absenteeism from work, and antibiotic treatments. The diaries were returned monthly and checked by the research nurse. If questions arose, the research nurse called the patient or the spouse. Statistical analysis were performed with SPSS for Windows software (version 16.0; SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill). A paired-samples t test was conducted to compare respiratory tract infection episodes in patients and spouses and to compare respiratory tract viral infections and rhinoviral infections, respectively. (Table II ). In 7 patients the rhinoviral PCR results were positive for 8 or more weeks in nasal swabs taken every 2 weeks. In a patient with XLA rhinovirus, PCR results stayed positive for 5 months. The same rhinoviral type, with more than 98% partial 59 nucleotide sequence homology, was found for 4 months (Fig 2) . In a patient with CVID, the same rhinoviral type persisted for 6 weeks (score of 98% similarity). The majority of rhinoviral infections occurred during the fall months (Fig 1) .
