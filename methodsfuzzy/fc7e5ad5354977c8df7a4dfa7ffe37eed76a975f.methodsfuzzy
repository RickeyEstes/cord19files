For this study, free-tailed bats were chosen for two reasons: (a) opportunity; the bats were from a conservation site wherein the animals' well-being is periodically evaluated and bat fecal samples were available for evaluation; and (b) they are among the most abundant bats often found roosting in buildings in Florida, and hence are most likely to interact with humans. These bat species were identified and evaluated for overall health by expert bat biologists of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). The FWC has no designated or required IACUC protocol, however they follow the guidelines of American Society of Mammalogists for the capture and handling bats [30] . Nineteen (n = 19) fecal samples were collected from capture/release bats in Gilchrist County, 8 km southwest of Ft. White, Florida in May 2016. Following collection, the samples were immediately sent to a BSL2-enhanced laboratory and stored at −80 • C. Bat fecal pellets were homogenized to 10% (w/v) suspensions in Gibco™ advanced Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (aDMEM) (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, Cat#12491015) supplemented with 0.2 mM glutamine (Gibco™ GlutaMAX, Fisher Scientific, Cat# 35050-061), antibiotics (50 µg/mL penicillin, 50 µg/mL streptomycin, 100 µg/mL neomycin (PSN, Fisher Scientific, Cat #15640055)) using Covidien Precision™ disposable tissue grinders (Fisher Scientific, Cat# 06-434-1). The homogenates were cleared of debris by low-speed centrifugation (5 min at 1500× g), and the supernatants filtered through 0.45 µm PVDF, sterile filters (Fisher Scientific, Cat# 09-720-4) to remove bacteria and other particulates, and the filtrates stored at −80 • C until further use. American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) cell lines VERO E6 (African green monkey kidney; CRL-1586), A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma epithelium; CCL-185), and Tb1 Lu (Tadarida brasiliensis lung epithelium; CCL-88) were propagated as monolayers as previously described [31] , and a newly confluent monolayer of each of these three cell lines was inoculated with aliquots (75 µL) of the filtered homogenates. The inoculated cells were incubated in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere at 35 • C, and observed daily for virus-specific cytopathic effects (CPE). Viral nucleic acids were extracted from both filtered homogenates and spent cell media using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA, Cat#52904). CoV RNA screening was performed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. Briefly, viral RNA was denatured at 65 • C for 5 min in the presence of SUPERase-In RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA, Cat#AM2694), cooled rapidly on ice and cDNA synthesis performed with Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase (RT) (Qiagen, Cat# 205111) for 1 h at 37 • C using primer CorTheoNL63R1 (5 -CCRTCATCAGANAGAATCATCAT-3 ). PCR was performed using One Taq DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA, Cat# M0480) with primer pair CorTheoNL63F1 (5 -GGTTGGGAYTATCCYAANTGTGA-3 ) and CorTheoNL63R1. With an expected product size of 440 bp, PCR was performed as: initial denaturation step (94 • C for 2 min); followed by 40 cycles of 94 • C (60 s), 48 • C (60 s), 68 • C (60 s), and a final extension step at 68 • C for 5 min. PCR products were visualized by gel electrophoresis in a 1.5% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. In preparation for sequencing, samples wherein a 440 bp PCR amplicon were initially observed were re-amplified using high-fidelity polymerases. Briefly, cDNA was produced using AccuScript High Fidelity Reverse Transcriptase (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA, Cat# 200820) in the presence of SUPERase-In RNase inhibitor, and PCR was performed using Phusion Polymerase (New England BioLabs, Cat# M0530S) with denaturation steps performed at 98 • C. The re-amplified samples were individually electrophoresed in a 1.5% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel and the 440 bp amplicon excised and purified using a Qiagen MinElute Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Cat# 28604). The purified 440 bp PCR amplicons were then subjected to Sanger Sequencing. Preliminary sequence analyses were performed with the NCBI BLAST software. For phylogenetic analyses, all available RdRp CoV sequences were downloaded from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega [32] and manually edited in Bioedit [33] . Phylogenetic signal was investigated by likelihood mapping in the program TREE-PUZZLE [34] in order to assess the phylogenetic signal in the sequence alignment and to remove the appropriate identical sequences. The maximum likelihood tree was estimated using the best nucleotide substitution model (TPM3 + I + G4) according to the results from IQ-TREE [35] . Bootstrapping (1000 replicates) was also performed using the IQ-TREE software. This was done in order to statistically analyze branch support in the maximum likelihood tree. The maximum likelihood tree was then manually edited in FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) to display geographical locations of the sequences and to show branches with strong statistical support (bootstrap values greater than 95%).
