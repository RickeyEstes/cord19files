In this paper we adopt the convention of using italics for the genus and species elements when we refer to a name as a scientific name (e.g. Carex scirpoidea Michx. ssp. convoluta (Kük.) Dunlop), but we use bold font when treating it as an example of a name-string that we need to manage (e.g. Carex scirpoidea Michx. ssp. convoluta (Kük.) Dunlop). All examples in the results of this paper are verbatim entries from the sources used in this study. The examples were copied from sources and pasted into this report. A copy of the data is available from the DRYAD data repository (http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/ dryad.50c71).
