The method of land application of biosolids essentially depends on the percent solids contained within them, which determines whether the biosolids are liquid in nature or a " cake " (Information Box 24.5). Figures. 24.28 , 5.12, 5.14, and 5.15 illustrate all methods of land application, which can be grouped into two categories: • Injection. Liquid biosolids are injected to a soil depth of 6-9 inches. Injection vehicles simultaneously disc the field. Injection processes reduce odors, and bioaerosols, as well as the risk of runoff to surface waters. • Surface application. Liquid or cake biosolids are surface applied and subsequently tilled into the soil ( Fig. 24.29 ).
