An epidemiological study of all MERS-CoV cases recorded by the Saudi Ministry of Health between June 6, 2013 and May 14, 2014 was performed. As data are limited regarding MERS-CoV available from the Saudi Ministry of Health website, we concentrated on disease distribution by date of confirmed diagnosis, sex, age group, and region. Since May 2013, the Saudi Ministry of Health has published a daily report on MERS-CoV infections, with the primary objective of defining the burden of this disease in Saudi Arabia. Currently, there are limited data in these reports, although each contains the number of cases diagnosed, the number of deaths confirmed, the sex of the patients, and the region inhabited by the infected person. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS for Windows, Version 20.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). The frequency of cases of MERS-CoV infection and percentage of resulting deaths were calculated and categorized by date of diagnosis, sex, age group, and region. In addition, the case fatality rate (a measure of the severity of epidemic disease) was calculated and categorized by month, sex, age group, and region. The average relative humidity and temperature of the regions with the highest incidence of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia were calculated, to study the geographical and temporal characteristics of this disease.
