Viral strain propagation. The highly pathogenic PRRSV (LS-4 strain) was used throughout the present study 36, 37 . The viral strain was passaged five times in MARC-145 cells. The MARC-145 cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC no. CRL-1223) and cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin in a humidified 37 °C/5% CO 2 incubator. Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were obtained by lung lavage from specific pathogen-free piglets as previously described 38 . All PAM batches were tested for susceptibility to PRRSV infection, and only highly PRRSV-susceptible cells were used for the present study. Prior to use, PAMs were suspended at 3 × 10 6 cells/ml in EMEM with 5% FCS. For infection assays, PAMs in a non-adherent state were used. A total of 200 μ L of cell suspension was added to sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf polypropylene tubes, the tube caps were pierced with a 16 G needle to allow air exchange and cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air + 5% CO 2 atmosphere.
