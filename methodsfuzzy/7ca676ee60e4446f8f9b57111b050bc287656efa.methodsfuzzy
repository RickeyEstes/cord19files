Virus. --The American strain of bovine coronavirus, BC-1 (Stair et al., 1972) was kindly supplied by Dr. C.A. Mebus. It had been passed over 20 times in bovine kidney cells. Organ cultures. --Tracheal organ cultures from four bovine foetuses between 5 and 6 months of gestation were prepared as described by Thomas and Howard (1974) . They were maintained as rings in rolled tubes at 37°C in Eagle's basal medium containing 0.14% sodium bicarbonate, 0.09% bovine plasma albumin (Armour Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd), 5% tryptose phosphate broth, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ~g/ml streptomycin, 250 ~g/ml ampicillin, 100 ~g/ml kanamycin, 25 ~g/ml mycostatin and 30 mM HEPES buffer adjusted to pH 7.2 with 1 N NaOH. Cultures were inoculated with 0.2 ml of virus and after incubation for 2 h at 37 ° C, cultures were washed three times to remove unadsorbed virus. Thereafter medium was changed and samples taken every 3 or 4 days.
