1. Sera to be tested and control sera (negative and positive) are diluted 50 times (5 μ1/250 μΐ PBS-Tween-20) and dispensed (0.25 ml) into the designated well of a round-bottom 96-well plate. 2. In another plate, antigen beads are placed using a bead dispenser. The beads are then transferred simultaneously with the Magnetic Transfer Device into the wells with the sera. 3. The plate containing sera and beads is incubated for 45 min at 37°C with gentle rocking. 4. Transfer the beads to wash solution and raise and lower the magnet 12 times for efficient release of nonspecifically adsorbed material. 5. Transfer the beads to conjugate-containing (0.2 ml) wells and incubate for 45 min at 37°C. * Procedure for the HTLV Bio-EnzaBead test kit provided by Litton Bionetics Laboratory Products Division. 6 . Transfer the beads sequentially to two plates containing wash solutions (move the beads, respectively, two and four times up and down in the wash solutions). 7. Transfer the beads to a clean plate containing substrate (in the Bionetics HTLV Bio-EnzaBead Test kit, ABTS since peroxidase is used). Arrest the reaction after 10 min. 8. Remove the beads and read the results on a white background or with a test reading mirror (with a white paper on top of the plate).
