As we have outlined in Fig. 2 , averaging of 2D and 3D single particles follow highly analogous workflows. In some cases it may be beneficial to mix these two. In one example of such a hybrid approach, the structure of the GP spike of prototypic foamy virus (PFV) has been studied (Effantin et al., 2016) . First STA was used to determine the structure of the trimeric GP at $30 Å resolution ( Fig. 2B; steps 1, 2, 3, 4) . Plotting back the GP structure allowed visualizing hexagonal assemblies of six GPs on the envelope ( Fig. 2B ; step 5). A patch of six trimers was extracted, sixfold symmetry was imposed and this volume was used as a search model to pick and extract GP subparticles directly from untilted images ( Fig. 2A ; steps 1 and 2 0 ). GP spike subparticles were then subjected to conventional SPA refinement that allowed determination of a threefold symmetrized GP density map at $9 Å . The density map revealed a region interpreted as a coiled-coil of three α-helices, a hallmark of viral class I fusion proteins.
