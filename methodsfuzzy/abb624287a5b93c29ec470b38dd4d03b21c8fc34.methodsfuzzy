Fresh fecal samples were submitted to the Clinical Virology Laboratory (University of Tennessee Veterinary Medical Center) for electronmicroscopic examination. Samples were processed as described in [63] . Briefly, samples were centrifuged in distilled water at approximately 15,000Ã—g for one hour. The supernatant was discarded and pellet resuspended in 2-3 ml distilled water. 100ul of the resuspended material was added to 1 ml distilled water containing 3% phosphotungstic acid. The solution was aerosolized onto a carbonate-coated copper grid and examined by EM at 30,000 and 300,000X.
