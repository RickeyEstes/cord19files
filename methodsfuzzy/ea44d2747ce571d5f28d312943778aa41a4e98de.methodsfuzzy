For the influenza HIG test the method used was similar to that of Russell et al. (1975) . An aliquot of 0.5 ml of 10% sheep erythrocytes were mixed with an equal volume of 5 x l0 -4 M potassium periodate in phosphate buffered saline and kept at room temperature for 10 min with gentle mixing. Then 0.5 ml virus, in the form of allantoic fluid or Tween-ether treated hemagglutinin, was added and the mixture kept at 4Â°C for 10 min. The sensitized erythrocytes were washed 3 times and made up to a 5% suspension in DGV buffer.
