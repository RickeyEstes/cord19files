2.1. qRT-PCR development 2.1.1. Virus preparation, titration and RNA extraction DUGV (IbH 11480), CCHF (IbAr 10200), Hazara (JC280), Coronavirus (ATCC VR-740), Influenza A (ATCC VR-547), were used in this study. All infectious work was carried out in a biosafety-level 2 and 4. The batches of viral inocula used in this study were prepared by 2 passages in BHK21 cells (ATCC CCL-10) grown at +37 • C, 5% CO 2 in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (PAN, Biotech, GmbH, Aidenbach, Germany), 5 × 10 4 U Penicillin and 50 mg Streptomycin (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Briefly, cells were incubated for 1 h at +37 • C, 5% CO 2 in the presence of the initial virus inoculum at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0,1 in DMEM medium without FCS. Medium containing 5% of FCS was then added and cells were maintained for 3 days. Absence of mycoplasma was confirmed using the Mycoalert kit (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium). Cell culture supernatants were centrifuged (5 min, 3000 × g, +4 • C), aliquoted and frozen (−80 • C) until used for viral RNA extraction. Viral titers, expressed in focus forming units per ml (FFU/mL) were estimated by the immunoperoxydase assay on Vero cells seeded in a flat bottom 12-well plate (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), according to the dilution methods reported previously using an in-house hyperimmunized mouse ascitic fluid specific to DUGV (Peyrefitte et al., 2010) . All viral RNAs were extracted from 200 L of cell supernatants using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) according to the manufacturers' instructions. To evaluate the influence of the serum, virus from infected cells supernatant was serially diluted in human serum (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany).
