Ganglia from 54 cattle aged from 10 days to 10 years (mean 38.54 AE 27.48 months) were examined. Ganglia were harvested from two sources, healthy control animals (n ¼ 13), ranging in age from 5 to 58 months, that had been examined post mortem and represented negative control animals in a German BSE pathogenicity study (Hoffmann et al., 2007) and cattle (n ¼ 41) submitted to the UVH Dublin for post-mortem examination following a variety of illnesses. All cattle over the age of 48 months from the latter source underwent mandatory BSE testing (HerdChek Ò BSE-Scrapie Ag Test, Idexx at Identi-GEN, Dublin, Ireland) and no evidence of prion proteins was found. The post-mortem diagnosis was recorded for each case.
