Melting points (uncorrected) were determined with Büchi melting point B-545. Precoated Merck silica gel 60F-254 plates were used for thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and the spots were detected under UV light (254 nm). Solvent system used for TLC was chloroform:methanol = 9:1. Mass spectra were recorded with an Autospec: ESI/Q-TOF Premier instrument. 1 H-NMR spectra were recorded at 600 MHz, in deuterated DMSO-d6, on Bruker (UXNMR/XwinNMR) spectrometer, using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal reference. 1D and 2D NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on Varian Unity Inova 300 spectrometers. 1 H and 13 C chemical shifts were referred to residual signal of CDCl 3 , CD 2 Cl 2 and DMSO-d 6 (δ TMS 0.0 ppm). 19 F chemical shifts were referenced externally with respect to CCl 3 F (δ 0.0 ppm). 1 H, 13 C and 19 F-NMR resonances were assigned on the basis of signal intensities and multiplicities in 1D spectra as well as correlation signals in 2D 1 H-1 H COSY, 1 H-13 C HSQC and 1 H-13 C HMBC NMR spectra. Elemental analyses were performed in the Central Analytic Service, Rudjer Bošković Institute Zagreb, Croatia, using a Perkin Elmer 2400 Elemental Analyser. The infrared spectra were obtained from potassium bromide triturate containing 0.5% of the product on a Perkin-Elmer 1000 FT-IR spectrophotometer. All data were recorded at 25 °C unless specified otherwise.
