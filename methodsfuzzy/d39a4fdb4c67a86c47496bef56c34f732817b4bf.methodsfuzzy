Cells, viruses, and plasmids. A549, BHK-21, HEK293, HEK293T, Vero B4, and Vero E6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) and CCM34 medium (DMEM with addition of 17.8 mg/liter L-alanine, 0.7 g/liter glycine, 75 mg/liter L-glutamic acid, 25 mg/liter L-proline, 0.1 mg/liter biotin, 25 mg/liter hypoxanthine, and 3.7 g/liter sodium bicarbonate) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. The Sabin strain of SFSV was obtained from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA) and propagated in Vero B4 cells. Attenuated RVFV strains MP12 and clone 13 were propagated in BHK-21 cells. Recombinant RVFV strains rZH548, rZH548ΔNSs, rZH548ΔNSs::NSsSFSV, and rZH548ΔNSs::NSsTOSV have been described previously (44, 84, 85) . rZH548ΔNSs::NSsPTV-A, rZH548ΔNSs:: PTV-B, and rZH548ΔNSs::NSsSFSV-CTAP were generated using a polymerase I (Pol I)/Pol II-based rescue system as described for the other recombinant RVFV strains (35, 53, 85) . In brief, NSs coding sequences for PTV-A and PTV-B NSs (GenBank accession no. EF201835 and EF201834, respectively) were obtained by gene synthesis (Mr. Gene) and inserted into modified S-segment rescue plasmid pHH21_RVFV_vN_TCS. The reading frame of SFSV NSs was amplified from cDNA of infected cells and inserted into rescue plasmid pHH21_RVFV_vN_MCS_CTAP, which contains a C-terminal tag for tandem affinity purification (TAP). Primer sequences are available on request. The resulting plasmids were transfected together with L-and M-segment rescue plasmids pHH21_RVFV_vL and pHH21_RVFV_vM, respectively, as well as helper plasmids pI.18_RVFV_L and pI.18_RVFV_N into cocultures of HEK293T and BHK-21 cells. Recombinant RVFV strains were harvested 5 days after transfection, propagated in Vero E6 cells, and characterized by RT-PCR and sequencing of the N-and NSs-coding regions. Titers of all virus strains were determined on Vero E6 cells via plaque assay. Both the cell lines and the virus stocks were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. To generate constructs encoding 3ϫFLAG-tagged NSs of SFSV (GenBank accession no. EF201822.1), PTV-A, or PTV-B, the viral open reading frames were amplified from cDNA (SFSV) or synthesized DNA (PTV-A and PTV-B) and inserted into pI.18 by ligation-dependent cloning via the use of 5= BamHI and 3= XhoI restriction sites. Primer sequences are available on request. pI.18-NSsRVFV-3ϫFLAG and pI.18-3ϫFLAG-ΔMx were described before (35) . Firefly luciferase reporter constructs p-125Luc, p-55C1BLuc, and p-55A2Luc (52) were kindly donated by Takashi Fujita, and pRL-SV40 was purchased from Promega. Expression plasmids for human TBK1 (86) and IRF3(5D) (55) were kindly provided by John Hiscott, for human MAVS by Shizuo Akira (87) , and for full-length pEGFP-C1-IRF3 (88) Dual-luciferase assay. HEK293 cells seeded into 96-well plates (1.5 ϫ 10 4 per well) were transfected the following day with firefly and Renilla luciferase reporter constructs (40 ng each), as well as expression constructs for MAVS (10 ng) and NSs proteins or the control protein ΔMx (0.1 ng, 1 ng, and 10 ng) via the use of TransIT-LT1 (Mirus Bio LLC). The total plasmid DNA amounts were adjusted to equal levels with empty vector pI.18. Cells were processed 24 h after transfection, and luciferase activities were measured with a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to those of Renilla luciferase, and the stimulated control samples were set to 100% within each biological replicate. Means and standard deviations (SD) were calculated across the indicated number of biological replicate data sets. Proteomics. As described previously (35, 53) , approximately 2 ϫ 10 8 HEK293T cells were infected with the recombinant RVFV strain expressing TAP-tagged SFSV NSs (rZH548ΔNSs::NSsSFSV-CTAP) at an MOI of 5. The cells were washed with and scraped off in prechilled PBS at 16 h postinfection (hpi). The cell pellet was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, lysed in TAP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40, 5% glycerol) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, snap-frozen again, and stored at Ϫ80°C until further processing. TAP purification was performed by sequential pulldowns using streptavidin agarose and HA-agarose beads. Bound protein complexes were eventually eluted in Laemmli buffer and subjected to one-dimensional SDS-PAGE prior to trypsin digestion and peptide analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), which was described in detail elsewhere (53) . Coimmunoprecipitation. HEK293 cells (2.5 ؋ 10 6 per 10-cm-diameter dish) were transfected with expression plasmids (4 g each) via the calcium phosphate method. Cells were washed twice in PBS the following day and lysed in prechilled lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.0], 150 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL-630) freshly supplemented with protease (Roche) (complete, EDTA-free) and phosphatase inhibitors (Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail set II; Calbiochem). Finally, cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 ϫ g, 10 min, 4°C), and the supernatants were used for further processing. For immunoprecipitation via the use of GFP, supernatants were applied to prewashed wells of a GFP-multiTrap (Chromotek) and incubated at 4°C for 60 to 90 min under conditions of mild shaking. Wells were washed extensively with lysis buffer and bound proteins eluted for 20 min with preheated Laemmli buffer under conditions of strong agitation. For immunoprecipitation via the use of FLAG, magnetic beads (143-21D; Invitrogen) were covalently coupled with FLAG M2 antibody (F3165; Sigma) overnight and processed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Lysates were then added to the coupled beads followed by incubation under conditions of rotation at 4°C for 4 h. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer at 94°C for 5 min. To map the binding region within IRF3, constructs comprising a T7 promoter, the open reading frames (ORF) of the respective truncated IRF3 mutants fused to eGFP, a stop codon, and a poly(A) stretch were assembled via PCR (primer sequences available on request) and purified via gel extraction (Omega Bio-tek) and DNA precipitation. The respective proteins were then produced by coupled in vitro transcription-translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (L4610; Promega) and added to lysate of HEK293 cells transiently expressing SFSV NSs. Immunoprecipitation via GFP was performed according to the aforementioned protocol. IRF3 dimerization assay. A549 cells infected with SFSV were lysed as described above and then processed as described before (90) . In brief, 10% native polyacrylamide gels were prerun at 25 mA for 30 min in native running buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, pH 8.3), with 1% deoxycholate added to the cathode buffer. Samples were supplemented with native loading buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 50% glycerol, 1% deoxycholate, 0.5% bromophenol blue), run at 20 mA for the desired duration, and finally transferred to PVDF membranes via semidry blotting. Immunofluorescence assay. A549 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips (1 ϫ 10 5 per 24 wells) 1 day prior to infection at an MOI of 1. The cells were washed with PBS at 12 hpi and fixed overnight in PBS-4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4°C. The coverslips were then washed with PBS, and the cells were permeabilized with PBS-0.1% Triton X-100, washed again, and blocked in PBS-1% FCS. Staining with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (IRF3 FL-425, 1:200; SFSV, 1:2,500) was performed for 1 h in a humid chamber. Afterward, the coverslips were washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse [A21202] and Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit [A31573]; Thermo Fisher Scientific) (both 1:500) and 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (0.1 g/ml) for 45 min in a humid chamber. Samples were washed again in PBS, rinsed in demineralized water, and mounted on microscopic slides using FluorSave reagent (Calbiochem). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica SP5 microscope and the accompanying software. Promoter binding assay. Biotinylated DNA covering the IRF3-responsive positive regulatory domains within the human IFN-␤ promoter and the downstream sequence as a linker (GenBank accession no. EF064725.1) was ordered as complementary single DNA strands (sense, 5=-GAC ATA GGA AAA CTG AAA GGG AGA AGT GAA AGT GGG AAA TTC CTC TGA ATA GAG AGA GGA CCA TCT CAT ATA AAT AGG CCA TAC CCA TGG AGA AAG GAC ATT-biotin-3=; antisense, 5=-AAT GTC CTT TCT CCA TGG GTA TGG CCT  ATT TAT ATG AGA TGG TCC TCT CTC TAT TCA GAG GAA TTT CCC ACT TTC ACT TCT CCC TTT CAG TTT  TCC TAT GTC-3= ) and subsequently annealed by initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by slow cooling (1°C/min) to room temperature (91) . The double-stranded biotinylated oligonucleotide (10 pmol per sample) was bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin; Invitrogen) (25 l per sample) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293 cells seeded into 6 wells (2.5 ϫ 10 5 per well) were transfected with plasmids coding for eGFP-IRF3 or for eGFP (250 ng), MAVS (500 ng), 3ϫFLAG-tagged SFSV NSs, or ΔMx (25, 250, or 500 ng) and empty vector (to adjust plasmid amounts) via the use of TransIT-LT1 and lysed in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors as
