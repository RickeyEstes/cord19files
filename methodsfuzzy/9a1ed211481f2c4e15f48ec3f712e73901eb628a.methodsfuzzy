Organism Disease Genomics/reverse vaccinology: Analysis of the genetic material of an organism in order to identify the repertoire of protein antigens/drug targets the organism has the potential to express. Bioinformatics screening of the genome sequence to identify ORFs predicted to be exposed on the surface of the pathogen or secreted, expression of recombinant proteins, generation of antibodies in mice to confirm surface exposure, and bactericidal activity [14] . Prediction algorithms need to be validated. Non-protein antigens including polysaccharides or glycolipids, and post-translational modifications cannot be identified. High-throughput cloning and protein expression is required. Serogroup B N. meningitidis [15, 16] Major cause of septicemia and meningitis in the developed world. Pan-genomics: Analysis of the genetic material of several organisms of a single species to identify conserved antigens/ targets and ensure the chosen target covers the diversity of the organism. Similar to above, but ORFs are chosen by screening of multiple genomes with either direct sequencing or comparative genome hybridization [18] . Sequences of multiple isolates of a species are required. Similar limitations as described above. S. agalactiae [20] Leading cause of neonatal bacterial sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis in the US and Europe. Comparative genomics: Analysis of the genetic material of several individuals of a single species, to identify antigens/ targets that are present in pathogenic strains but absent in commensal strains, and thus important for disease. Similar to pangenomics, but ORFs are chosen by screening of genomes from multiple strains of pathogenic and commensal strains of a species [18, 21] . Similar limitations as for the above two approaches. E. coli [22] Major cause of mild to severe diarrhea, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and urinary tract infections. Transcriptomics: Analysis of the set of RNA transcripts expressed by an organism under a specified condition. Gene expression is evaluated in vitro or in vivo using DNA microarrays or cDNA sequencing [24] . There is no direct correlation between the levels of mRNA and protein. In vivo studies require relatively large amounts of mRNA. V. cholerae [26] Causes diseases ranging from selflimiting to severe, life-threatening diarrhea, wound infections, and sepsis. Functional genomics: Analysis of the role of genes and proteins in order to identify genes required for survival under specific conditions. Genes that are functionally essential in specific conditions in vitro or in vivo are determined by gene inhibition followed by screening of mutants in animal models or cell culture to identify attenuated clones [87] . Genetic tools, acceptance of transposons, and natural competence of the pathogen are required. H. pylori [32] Major cause of duodenal and gastric ulcers and stomach cancer as a result of chronic low-level inflammation of the stomach lining. Proteomics: Analysis of the set of proteins expressed by an organism under a specified condition and/or in specific cellular locations (e.g., on the cell surface). 2D-PAGE, MS, and chromatographic techniques to identify proteins from whole cells, fractionated samples, or the cell surface [34] . Proteins with low abundance and/or solubility and proteins that are only expressed in vivo may not be identified.
