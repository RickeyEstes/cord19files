We first sequenced five influenza A positive and five influenza-negative throat swabs, each 91 spiked with Hazara virus control at 10 4 genome copies/ml. Using the SISPA approach [21] 92 followed by Nanopore sequencing, we produced metagenomic data dominated by reads that 93 were bacterial in origin, with extremely few viral reads detected. Passing the sample through a 94 0.4 Âµm filter prior to nucleic acid extraction increased the detection of viral reads by several 95 orders of magnitude ( Fig S1) . Filtration is relatively expensive, so we also assessed the 96 alternative approach of adding a rapid centrifugation step to pellet bacterial and human cells, 97 followed by nucleic acid extraction from the supernatant. We used a pooled set of influenza A 98 positive samples (concentration 10 6 genome copies/ml), to provide a large enough sample to 99 .

Enrichment 100 for influenza and Hazara was similar for filtration vs centrifugation, based on reads mapping to 101 the viral genome ( Fig S2) . As centrifugation is simpler and cheaper, we selected this approach 102 for all further testing. 103 104 Method optimisation to reduce time for cDNA synthesis 105 Synthesis of tagged, randomly primed cDNA and its subsequent amplification via SISPA [21] 106 required lengthy reverse transcription and PCR steps (1h and 3h 45min) respectively. 107 Optimising these stages upgraded the reverse transcriptase from SuperScriptIII to 108 SuperScriptIV (ThermoFisher), reduced incubation time to 10min (processing time reduction of 109 50min) and reduced the PCR extension time within each cycle from 5min to 2min (1h 30min 110 processing time reduction). Comparing this final method with our original protocol, using 111 triplicate extractions from the pooled set of influenza A positive samples, demonstrated no 112 significant loss in performance in the more rapid protocol ( Fig S3) and we adopted this 113 approach as our routine protocol. 114 115
