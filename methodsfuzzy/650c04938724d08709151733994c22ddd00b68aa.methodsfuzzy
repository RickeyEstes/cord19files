Sequence and synthesis information for dsRNA tethers. Each dsRNA molecule consists of a template strand for PV RdRp hybridized to a complementary tethering strand that is linked at its two extremities to the flow chamber and the beads, respectively (Dulin et al., 2015a) . Apart from a small hairpin that terminates the 3'-end of the template strand (sequence  of  the  initial  24  bases  of  the  template  strand: 3'-GGGGAGCUCCCCUUUUUUUUUUUU…-5', where boldface designates the hairpin sequence), the dsRNA construct used in this study is identical to that employed in our preceding studies of Φ6 P2 RdRp (Dulin et al., 2015a , Dulin et al., 2015b (Fig.1A) . This hairpin forms an efficient way to mimic a primer hybridized to the template strand and promotes primer-dependent initiation (Arnold and Cameron, 1999 , Arnold and Cameron, 2004 , Arnold and Cameron, 2000 . Briefly, the RNA constructs were assembled by first subjecting Plasmid pBB10 (Petrushenko et al., 2006) to PCR amplification using primers AB-For, AB-Rev, CD-For, CD-Rev, Bio-For, Bio-Rev, Dig-For, Dig-Rev, SP-For, and SP-Rev listed in the RESOURCE TABLE. Singlestranded RNA molecules were produced from these PCR products via in vitro run-off transcriptions using T7 RNA polymerase from the Ribomax large-scale RNA production system (Promega) and purified using an RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit (Qiagen). These different ssRNA molecules are then assembled into the dsRNA construct (see Fig.S1A in (Dulin et al., 2015a) ) for single-molecule studies of PV activity via hybridization protocol performed in a PCR machine.
