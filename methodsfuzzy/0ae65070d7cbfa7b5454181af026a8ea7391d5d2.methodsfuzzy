Female inbred BALB/c mice were used for the assessment of immunogenicity and ZIKV challenge. Mice were purchased from either Envigo (Bicester, UK) or from Charles River (Wilmington, MA, USA). All animals and procedures were used in accordance with the terms of the UK Home Office Animals Act Project License. Immunisation and immunogenicity procedures were approved by the University of Oxford Animal Care and Ethical Review Committee (P9804B4F1). Animal experiments performed at Harvard (immunisation and ZIKV challenge) were approved by the BIDMC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The transgene was designed based on the Asian Lineage and produced by GeneArt (prME). The GeneArt prME plasmid was used as template to further generate the four ZIKV antigens (prME, prME ∆TM, Env, and Env ∆TM) as previously described ( [17] ). ZIKV antigens were used to generate MVA viruses as previously described [24, 25] . Briefly, the resulting antigen sequences were ligated into a shuttle vector, pMVA-GFP, which placed the open reading frame (ORF) under the control of the vaccinia p7.5 early/late promoter and also included GFP as a marker gene under the control of the vaccinia p11 late promoter. The shuttle vector was transfected into chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) infected with MVA for homologous recombination and insertion of the ZIKV ORF and GFP marker gene at a TK locus of MVA. The infected cells were harvested and screened by PCR to confirm identity. Plaque picking was performed until the culture was free of parental virus, as determined by PCR. The recombinant viruses were plaque purified and then expanded in Doug-Foster-1 (DF-1) cells [24] . The preparation of MVA vaccine stocks was performed by the infection of permissive CEF cells at low multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.). The supernatants were collected and the remaining cells lysed by successive rounds of freezing and thawing. The released virus was further concentrated by centrifugation through 36% (w/v) sucrose cushions and titres determined by routine plaque assay in DF-1 cell monolayers [24] . Formvar/carbon 200 Mesh Cu grids were glow-discharged in air and loaded with 3.0 µL of MVA viral sample encoding prME ∆TM. Excess liquid was removed, and the grids were washed three times with MilliQ water. Finally, grids were treated with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 s, excess uranyl acetate was carefully removed using filter paper. The grids were air dried and analysed with a T12 transmission electron microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). To test the expression of ZIKV antigens, BHK-21 cells were transfected with rMVA. At 24 h after transfection, BHK-21 cell extracts were tested by Western blot as previously described [19] . Briefly, samples added to Laemmli sample buffer containing 20 mM β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and loaded on a Mini-PROTEAN TGX protein gel with Bio-Rad, Precision Plus Protein TM WesternC TM standards. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Trans-Blot ® Turbo TM ). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in PBS/ 0.1% Tween (PBST) for 1 h and then incubated with 1:1000 anti-Zika Env monoclonal antibody (mouse mAb to Zika Env protein, AZ1176, Aalto BioReagents, Dublin, Republic of Ireland). After washing with PBST, membranes were incubated for 1 h with an appropriate secondary antibody using an HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad Cat. 170-6516). The membranes were washed and incubated with chemiluminescent substrate (Clarity TM Western ECL Blotting Substrates, Bio-Rad, Watford, UK) prior to detecting the signal by the chemiluminescent Western blot imaging system (Image Lab, Bio-Rad). Groups of five or six mice were vaccinated with a single dose of new recombinant modified vaccinia ankara (MVA) encoding the ZIKV antigens at a dose of 1 × 10 6 PFU. All viral vector vaccines were administered intramuscularly (IM) and diluted in endotoxin-free PBS. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-recombinant ZIKV Envelope protein was used to measure anti-ZIKV envelope antibody concentrations in vaccinated mice by ELISA as previously described [19] . Briefly, Nunc Maxisorp Immuno ELISA plates were coated with Zika virus envelope antigen (Env-CD4) diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 2 µg/mL and left at room temperature (RT )overnight. Plates were washed six times with PBS/0.05% Tween (PBS/T) and blocked with 300 µL with PierceTM protein-free (PBS) blocking buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 2 h at RT. Mice sera were obtained 4 weeks or 12 weeks after single immunisation with MVA-ZIKV vaccine. Mice sera reactive to ZIKV E was serially diluted three-fold down in PBS/T with 50 µL per well as final volume and incubated for 2 h at RT. Following washing six times with PBS/T, bound antibodies were detected following a 1 h incubation with 50 µL of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies specific for whole mouse IgG (A3562-5ML, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Following a further six washes with PBST, development was achieved using 100 µL of 4-nitrophenylphosphate diluted in diethanolamine buffer and the absorbance values at OD405 were measured and analysed using a CLARIOstar instrument (BMG Labtech, Aylesbury, GB). Serum antibody endpoint titres were defined by the sera dilution reaching a greater value than the average OD405 value of the control naïve sera plus three standard deviations. ELISPOT was carried out using peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) isolated from the blood as previously described [17] . Briefly, MAIP ELISPOT plates (Millipore) were coated an Anti-mouse IFN-γ mAb, contained in the Mouse IFN-γ ELISpot BASIC (ALP) kit Ref 3321-2A), after 1 h blocking with complete DMEM media (10% FCS). Isolated PBMCs (using ACK buffer solution) were plated alongside 20-mer specific peptides overlapped by 10 a.a. (10 µg/mL) and 2.5 × 10 5 splenocytes per well. After 16 h incubation, cells were discarded and plates washed with PBS. Following this, 50 µL of biotinylated anti-mouse IFNγ mAb (1:1000 in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 2 h. After washing, plates were incubated with 50 µL of ALP (1:1000 in PBS) reagent for 1 h. After another washing step, developing solution (Bio-Rad, Watford, UK) was used. Once spots were visible, the reaction was stopped by washing plate off with water. Spots were acquired using an ELISPOT reader. Spot forming cells (SFC)/10 6 PBMCs producing IFNγ were calculated. The ZIKV challenge was performed as described [26] . Briefly, naïve and vaccinated BALB/c mice (n = 5 per group) were infected at week four by the intravenous (i.v.) route with 10 5 viral particles (10 2 plaque-forming units (PFU)) of the ZIKV-BR strain. Viral loads following ZIKV challenge were quantitated by RT-PCR at day 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7. Sample size was determined to achieve 80% power to detect significant differences in protective efficacy. Vaccines were administered in a blind experiment. After the experimental outcome of the ZIKV challenge, samples were decoded. Viral loads were assessed as described [26] . Briefly, RNA was extracted from serum with a QIAcube HT (Qiagen, Germantown, U.S.A). RNA was purified using the RNA clean and concentrator kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, U.S.A), and RNA quality and concentration was assessed by the BIDMC Molecular Core Facility of Harvard University. Log dilutions of the RNA standard were reverse-transcribed and included with each RT-PCR assay. Viral loads were calculated as virus particles per mL. Assay sensitivity was 100 copies per mL. The infectivity of virus in peripheral blood from ZIKV challenged mice was confirmed by PFU assays. Specific primers were used to amplify a region contained in the Capsid of the ZIKV genome.
