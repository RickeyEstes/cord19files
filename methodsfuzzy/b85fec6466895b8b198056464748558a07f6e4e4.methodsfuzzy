An aliquot of NPS sample was tested for hMPV. Viral RNA was extracted directly from NPS specimens using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of DNase-free, RNase-free double-distilled water and was used as the template for RT-PCR. A 267-bp fragment of the polymerase gene of hMPV was amplified by RT-PCR using primers (LPW 4764 5 0 -TGGTGYCARAARYTMTGGACA-3 0 and LPW 4765 5 0 -AAAYT GRAGATCYCTTGATATATA-3 0 ). The RNA was converted to cDNA by a combined random-priming strategy using the Su-perScript II kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA). The PCR mixture (50 ml) contained 1 ml of cDNA, PCR buffer (10 mM TriseHCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 and 0.01% gelatin), 200 mM of each dNTPs and 1.0 U Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). The mixtures were amplified in 40 cycles of 94 C for 1 min, 50 C for 1 min and 72 C for 1 min and a final extension at 72 C for 10 min in an automated thermal cycler (PerkineElmer Cetus, Gouda, The Netherlands). The PCR products were gel-purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany). Both strands of the PCR products were sequenced twice with an ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), using the PCR primers. For hMPV culture, FRhK-4 cell monolayers in culture tubes were inoculated with 200 ml of NPS and the cells were maintained in serum free medium MEM (minimal essential medium) with trypsin (2.5 mg/ml), and incubated at 35 C for up to 14 days. They were examined daily for cytopathic effect (CPE), immunofluorescence done on fixed cell smears when CPE appeared or at the end of the incubation period. hMPV antibody detection was performed using indirect immunofluorescence test of hMPV-infected cell smears (Fig.  1bed) . Briefly, serum with serial 2-fold dilutions starting from 1 in 10 was screened on infected and noninfected control cells for 30 min at 37 C. The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min each time, and then anti-human IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugates (INOVA Diagnostic, San Diego) were added and the cells were further incubated for 30 min at 37 C. The IF-dyestained cells were examined at a Ã‚20 magnification under a UV fluorescence microscope.
