Phylogenetic analysis of coronaviruses' spiker proteins. Spiker (S) proteins of 15 relevant enveloped viruses, which consisted of 13 closely related coronaviruses in addition to HIV and Influenza virus as references, were collected to perform the multiple alignment in the level of amino acids by the program of Vector NTI Suite 8.0 (Invitrogen), and the available data were processed by TreeView software to generate the phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 1 . Development of HCoV-229E fusion core. The spiker (S) gene of HCoV-229E was utilized in this work. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2 , the HCoV-229E S protein belongs to the typical type I membrane protein. The two heptad-repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) were predicted using the computer program of LearnCoil-VMF [39] . The predicted HR1 region covers amino acids 777-916, and the relevant HR2 includes the amino acids 1057-1105 (in the bottom panel of Fig. 2) . To achieve the soluble production of the HCoV-229E fusion core, both HR1 and HR2 regions were rationally modified (Fig. 3A) , basing multiple lines of considerations including alignments of HCoV-229E with the other related coronaviruses in their corresponding conserved regions (Fig. 3B) [12, 29, 36] . Subsequently, the HCoV-229E fusion core (2-Helix construct) was designed successfully by connecting the truncated HR1 (789-852) and extended HR2 (1053-1110) with a flexible linker (SGGRGG, single amino acid abbreviation) (Fig. 3C) . Finally, the DNA coding sequence with optimized codes in Escherichia coli was amplified via the overlapping PCR technique, and then was inserted directionally into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6P-1 (Pharmacia) between the restriction sites of BamHI and XhoI (introduced by PCR primers). The resultant recombinant plasmid was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Soluble production of HCoV-229E fusion core. The possible positive clones were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) competent cells and the single colony was inoculated into Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 50 mg/L ampicillin (Sigma, USA) at 37°C for 8 h. Following, the culture was transferred into the fresh LB medium for large-scale protein production at 37°C. When the culture density (OD 600 ) added up to 0.8-1.0, the culture was induced with 0.20 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Sigma, USA) and grown for another $12 h at 16°C untill the bacteria cells were harvested. The harvested culture was centrifuged to collect the bacterial pellet. The pellet was re-suspended in the iced PBS and homogenized by sonication [12, 29, 36] . The lysate was centrifuged at 18,600 rpm for 20 min at 4°C and subsequently filtered through 0.22 lm membrane for clarification [12, 29, 36] . Then the supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Pharmacia), and the GST-fusion protein was eluted by 20 mM reduced glutathione (Pharmacia). To obtain the GST-removed protein, the GST-3C rhinovirus protease (kept in our laboratory) was added into the resin, and then the mixture was incubated with gentle agitation for about 8 h at 4°C. The target protein was eluted with 20 ml PBS. Gel-filtration analysis. The target protein (2-Helix) loaded on a Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia) with an AKTA Purifier System (Pharmacia) after it was concentrated by ultra-filtration (10 kDa cut-off) and exchanged from PBS buffer into the exclusion buffer. The fraction of the peak was collected and analyzed by a 17% SDS-PAGE, and the molecular weight of the interested peak was estimated by comparison with the GST protein run on the same gel [12, 29, 36] . CD spectroscopic analysis. CD spectra were performed on a Jasco J-715 spectrophotometer in PBS buffer, and wavelength spectra were recorded in a 0.1 cm path-length cuvette at 25°C. Chemical cross-linking assay. The purified 2-Helix protein after the gelfiltration was dialyzed against cross-linking buffer (50 mM Herpes, pH 8.3; 100 mM NaCl) and concentrated to approximately 5 mg/L by ultra-filtration (10 kDa cut-off). The resultant proteins were performed to chemical cross-linking reaction with ethylene glycol bis-succinimidylsuccinate (EGS) (Pierce). The reactions were incubated for 1 h on ice at different concentrations of EGS, respectively (0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 5.0 mM EGS), and quenched with 50 mM glycine. Eventually, the cross-linked samples were analyzed by 17% SDS-PAGE [12] . 3D structure modeling. The deduced amino acid sequence of the HCoV-229E fusion core was sent into the CPHmodels 2.0 Server and then was processed. Finally, the coordinates were used to generate the 3D structure of the HCoV-229E fusion core using the program of DeepView/ SwissPdb-Viewer 3.7 (SPS) [12] .
