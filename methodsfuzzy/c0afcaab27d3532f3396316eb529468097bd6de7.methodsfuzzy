Peripheral blood samples were obtained from healthy adult volunteers. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Lymphoprepâ„¢ (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway). CD14 + monocytes and CD4 + T cells were isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany), and purity was confirmed by flow cytometry. Monocytes (average purity 98%) were isolated by positive selection using anti-CD14 microbeads. CD4 + T cells were isolated via negative depletion (average purity 95%), and in some experiments, CD45RO + CD4 + T cells were subsequently enriched by positive selection using CD45RO microbeads (average purity 87%). In some experiments, CD4 + T cells were sorted to very high purity (> 99%) and part of the cells depleted of CD4 + CD25 high CD127 low Tregs by FACS-sorting after labeling cells with CD4 PerCP Cy5.5 (SK3), CD25 PE (M-A251), CD127 Alexa Fluor 488 (A019D5) mAbs (all from BioLegend, Cambridge, UK). The study was approved by the Bromley Research Ethics Committee (06/Q0705/20), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
