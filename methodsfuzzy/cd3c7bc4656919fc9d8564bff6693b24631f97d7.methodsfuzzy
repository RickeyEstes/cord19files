Virus titrations. The PR8 strain was titrated in MDCK cells by immunofocus assay (with results reported as fluorescent focus units [FFU] per milliliter), as previously described (57) . All PR8 infections were performed in the presence of 1 g/ml of tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)treated trypsin (Sigma). r3LCMV-GFP/Gluc was titrated in Vero cells by fluorescence assay, as previously described (54, 55) . rVSV-GFP was titrated by plaque assay (and quantified as PFU per milliliter) in Vero cells as previously described (25) . siRNA-mediated silencing. Human A549, 293T, or HAP-1 cells were transfected independently with two different "silencer select" small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for human IFI44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, s20721 and s225440) or two different siRNAs specific for human FKBP5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, s5215 and s5216) or with nontargeting (NT) negative control no. 1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM4635). Mouse L929 cells were transfected with an siRNA specific for mouse IFI44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, s97494) or with NT negative control no. 1. All siRNAs were transfected at a final concentration of 20 nM, using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RT-qPCR. mRNA levels of IFI44, FKBP5, IFN-␤, IFN-1, IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2), and IFN-induced protein 27 (IFI27) in human A549, 293T, and HAP-1 cells and in mouse L929 cells were analyzed using total extracted RNA (RNeasy minikit; Qiagen). RT reactions were performed at 37°C for 2 h using a High Capacity cDNA transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and random primers and 100 ng of total RNA. qPCRs were performed using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) specific for human IFI44 (Hs00197427_m1), mouse IFI44 (Mm00505670_m1), human FKBP5 (Hs01561006_m1), human IFN-␤ (Hs01077958_s1), human IFIT2 (Hs00533665_m1), mouse IFIT2 (Mm00492606_m1), human IFI27 (Hs01086373_g1), and human IFN-1 (Hs00601677_g1) genes.

Human 293T cells were transfected with HA-tagged IFI44 or IFI6 and IFI27 (as controls) expression plasmids (pCAGGS-IFI44-HA or pCAGGS-IFI6-HA and pCAGGS-IFI27-HA, respectively), using DNA-IN (MTI GlobalStem), for 48 h. Cells were lysed in coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) buffer (NaCl 100 mM; EDTA 0.5 mM; 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 M; Triton X-100 1%; glycerol 5%) containing protease inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then, Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and ␤-mercaptoethanol were added and samples were heated at 95°C for 5 min before SDS-PAGE was performed. Proteins were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and excised from the gel. Gel bands were destained with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate-50% acetonitrile. After reduction and alkylation, trypsin (Pierce) was added at 10 ng/l and samples were incubated overnight at 37°C and then extracted using 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Peptides were desalted, dried in a SpeedVac, and reconstituted in 0.1% TFA-water. Peptides were injected onto a C 18 column with 1.8-m-diameter beads (Sepax), using an Easy nLC-1000 high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which was connected to a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Raw data were analyzed using the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science) within the Proteome Discoverer software platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Swiss-Prot human database. Western blots. Cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega) and clarified by centrifugation. Cell lysates were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer containing 2.5% ␤-mercaptoethanol and heated at 90°C for 5 min before SDS-PAGE was performed. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and detected using primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) specific for IFI44 (Abcam ab172499), FKBP5 (Cell Signaling 8245), HA tag (Sigma-Aldrich H6908), FLAG tag (Sigma-Aldrich F7425), phospho-IKK␣ (Ser176)/IKK␤ (Ser177) (Cell Signaling 2078), phospho-IKK (p IKK Thr501) (Rockland 600-401-267), and IRF-3 (Abcam ab25950) and mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the His epitope tag (Thermo Fisher Scientific MA1-21315), the MYC epitope tag (Thermo Fisher Scientific IFI44 Modulates Antiviral Responses ® 13-2500), phospho-IRF-3 (pIRF-3; Abcam ab76493), phospho-IkB␣ (pIkB␣; Thermo Fisher Scientific MA5-15224), IkB␣ (Abcam ab32518), and actin (Sigma-Aldrich, A1978) followed by incubation with a 1:1,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit (pAb) or anti-mouse (MAb) IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich). Membranes were revealed by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Co-IP. Human 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing FKBP5 and IFI44 (pCAGGS-FKBP5-FLAG and pCAGGS-IFI44-HA, respectively) using DNA-IN for 30 h. Alternatively, human 293T cells were transiently transfected with different combinations of pCAGGS-FKBP5-FLAG, pCAGGS-IFI44-HA, pCAGGS-MYC-IKK, and pCAGGS-MYC-IKK␤ plasmids using DNA-IN for 30 h. The total amount of transfected DNA plasmid was maintained at a constant level with empty pCAGGS plasmid. Cells were lysed in Co-IP buffer containing protease inhibitors. Cleared cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4°C with 30 l of anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich, A2220) or anti-HA (Pierce 26181) affinity resins. After three washes in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 (for anti-HA resin) or TBS containing 0.1% SDS (for anti-FLAG resin), precipitated proteins were dissociated using disruption buffer at high temperature (95°C) and analyzed by Western blotting as described above using anti-HA (IFI44)-, anti-MYC (IKK and IKK␤)-, and anti-FLAG (FKBP5)-specific Abs. Confocal microscopy. Confluent human A549 cells on sterile glass coverslips were transiently transfected with pCAGGS plasmids expressing FKBP5-FLAG and IFI44-HA using DNA-IN. At 24 hpt, cells were fixed and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. FKBP5-FLAG and IFI44-HA were detected with murine anti-FLAG and rabbit anti-HA pAbs, respectively. Coverslips were washed 4 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit Abs conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 and 546 (Invitrogen), respectively, at room temperature for 45 min. Nuclei were stained using 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Coverslips were mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and analyzed on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope. Images were acquired with the same instrument settings and analyzed with the Leica software. IFN production and signaling assays. To evaluate the effect of IFI44 on the induction of IFN, human A549 and HAP-1 cells and mouse L929 cells were transfected with siRNAs specific for IFI44 or for the NT siRNA control for 36 h. Then, A549 cells were infected with PR8 (MOI of 3), r3LCMV-GFP/Gluc (MOI of 3), rVSV-GFP (MOI of 0.1), or SeV (MOI of 3) for 24, 42, 24, or 24 h, respectively. Alternatively, A549, HAP-1, and L929 cells were transfected for 16 h with 250, 2,000, and 100 ng/ml of polyinosinic-poly(C) [poly(I·C); Sigma], respectively, using DNA-IN. To assess the effect of IFI44 on IFN signaling, human A549 and HAP-1 cells were treated with universal IFN-␣ (Axxora) (250 U/ml and 2,000 U/ml, respectively). Total RNA was extracted and RT-qPCRs were performed as described above. Alternatively, HAP-1 WT and IFI44 KO cells were seeded and treated with IFN-␣ (Axxora) (2,000 U/ml) or transfected with 2,000 ng/ml of poly(I·C) using DNA-IN. At 16 h after treatment, cells were infected with rVSV-GFP (53) for 24 h. Viral titers in tissue culture supernatants were determined in Vero cells as previously described (25) .
