Extractions were carried out by using three different techniques [accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), extraction under ultrasonic waves (USW) and the classical extraction by percolation (CE)]. The plant material was extracted with different solvents (liquid ammonia at different concentrations, 50% ethyl alcohol, acetic acid at different concentrations and water) at different pH which were used in case of ASE and USW. The concentration of liquid ammonia used was 30% NH 4 OH and it was considered as 100% in the study. The proposed method was validated by carrying out linearity, limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), precision and accuracy studies. Linearity was determined on the basis of calibration curves. Regression analysis was used to assess the linearity of the developed UPLC-qTOF-MS method. In the present study, linearity was studied for standard solutions of glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetic acid respectively. LOD and LOQ were measured based on the method described by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH, 2005) . The LOD and LOQ of glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetic acid were determined on the basis of signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and 10, respectively. The precision parameters were ascertained in three different concentrations (5, 25 and 200 ng/mL), 6 replicates each in 2 sets on the same day and on 3 consecutive days. Accuracy was determined in terms of % recovery in two different concentrations (30 and 180 ng/mL), 6 replicates each in 2 sets on the same day and on 3 consecutive days. Recovery study was performed by analyzing analytes at three different levels (10, 50 and 250 ng/mL) by comparing the mean peak areas (nÂ¼ 6 for each concentration) obtained from blank samples with those spiked on 3 consecutive days.
