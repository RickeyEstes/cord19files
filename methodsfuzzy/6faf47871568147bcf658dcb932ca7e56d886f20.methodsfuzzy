This category includes pasteurization, UV irradiation and filtration. Pasteurization entails increasing the temperature, typically to 70°C, for several minutes (30-60 min). It is effective and eliminates most pathogens (e.g. bacterial indicators, Ascaris suum eggs, swine vesicular disease virus), however it does not eliminate spore-forming bacteria, like Clostridium spores or viruses such as porcine parvovirus (Bagge et al., 2010; Sahlström et al., 2008) . Increasing the pasteurization temperature at 90°C could result in a more reliable inactivation of bacteria, heat-resistant viruses and parasites (Martens and Böhm, 2009) . It is however an energy intensive process that could be economically feasible when waste thermal energy is available, such as in biogas production plants. UV irradiation can achieve high reduction of enteric bacterial and protozoan pathogens (2-5 log 10 ), however some viruses are relatively resistant to UV irradiation (Bilotta and Kunz, 2013; Sobsey et al., 2006) . UV irradiation does not generate any unwanted residuals and does not alter the nutritional composition of WaW. Although filtration (ultra-and nano-filtration) is effective to remove pathogens (even prions) (Yunoki et al., 2008) , its application for large volumes of WaW, at an industrial scale as required for effective biomass production, is hindered by the presence of the various suspended and dissolved solids. This category includes alkaline treatment, chlorination, ozonation, and advanced oxidation processes. Alkaline treatment involves the addition of alkali, like ΚΟΗ, CaO or Ca(OH) 2 , and mixes with other materials like ash, to reach a pH > 12. The most frequent alkaline treatment is lime stabilization (CaO or Ca(OH) 2 ). This is effective for most pathogens, with reduction of fecal coliforms, Salmonella sp., helminth eggs and protozoan oocysts up to 98-99.99% that can be achieved after a few hours of stabilization (Sobsey et al., 2006; Viancelli et al., 2015; Wong and Selvam, 2009 ). However, alkaline stabilization can also precipitate nutrients such as phosphorus. Combining alkaline treatment with heat favours alkaline hydrolysis, a confirmed reliable method for inactivation of pathogens (Kaye et al., 1998) . Hydrolysates thus obtained might contain amino acids and sugars that may be directly assimilated by microalgae or duckweeds (Markou et al., 2014) offering an attractive source of organics for mixotrophic or heterotrophic growth. Chlorination is the most cost-effective process for wastewater disinfection (Amin et al., 2013; Rodríguez-Chueca et al., 2015) ; however the main drawback is the formation of toxic and carcinogenic by-products. Moreover, although chlorination is very Data summarized from (Bicudo and Goyal, 2003; Costantini et al., 2007; Kumar et al., 2013; Manyi-Loh et al., 2016; Sahlström, 2003; Spencer and Guan, 2004; Ziemer et al., 2010) . effective for inactivation of bacteria it is less effective for reduction of viruses and protozoa (Sobsey et al., 2006) . Ozonation is effective for inactivation of bacteria, viruses and protozoa; however organic matter in WaW can inactivate ozone which limits the efficacy of the method leading to requirements for high ozone doses (1-2 g L −1 ) (Sobsey et al., 2006; Watkins et al., 1997; Wu et al., 1998) . Ozonation does not alter the nitrogen and phosphorus content of the wastewater (Watkins et al., 1997; Wu et al., 1998) . The use of advanced oxidation processes for agro-industrial WaW could be more appropriate since organic matter is degraded during the process and does not interfere with the disinfection ability. Advanced oxidation processes are effective for disinfection giving bacterial reduction higher than 3 log 10 (Rodríguez-Chueca et al., 2015) and have been widely studied for agro-industrial WaW (Deng and Zhao, 2015; Matilainen and Sillanpää, 2010; Oller et al., 2011; Wagner et al., 2002) . However, more research is needed around the formation of potentially toxic intermediate products (Oller et al., 2011; Särkkä et al., 2015) . Agro-industrial WaW are treated mainly by biological methods, such as stabilization lagoons and AD. Other biological methods such as aerobic digestion, biofilters, activated sludge or constructed wetlands are not commonly employed for agro-industrial WaW. Stabilization lagoons (aerated, anaerobic, facultative or multiple configurations) offer low-cost options for WaW treatment. Especially multiple stabilization ponds are more effective in pathogens reduction (2-6 log 10 ) than single ponds (1-3 log 10 ) (Sobsey et al., 2006; Viancelli et al., 2013) . However, they require long retention times (> 3 months), their performance is not consistent, and depend significantly on environmental parameters (Sobsey et al., 2006) . Moreover, due to the long retention times required high loss of nutrients could occur; over 80% of N could be lost through ammonia volatilization (Rockne and Brezonik, 2006) . Among the biological methods for agro-industrial WaW treatment, AD is increasingly gaining interest because of the simultaneous treatment of the WaW and the production of biogas, which is an energy carrier that can be used to produce electricity/thermal energy or transportation fuels (biomethane) (Weiland, 2010) . AD may be performed either in the psychrophilic (temperature of the environment), mesophilic (30-40°C) or thermophilic (45-65°C) temperature ranges. Most frequently AD is carried out in the mesophilic range, as it is more robust compared to the thermophilic range digestion. The latter exhibits uncertainty in methanogenesis, especially when the ammoniacal nitrogen concentration of the waste liquor is relative high (Moset et al., 2015; Yenigün and Demirel, 2013) . Thermophilic AD is nonetheless more effective for pathogen reduction (Table 4) . Nevertheless, thermophilic digestion does not inactivate spore-forming pathogens of Clostridium or Bacillus (Bagge et al., 2010; Sahlström, 2003 ). An increase in organic acids (volatile fatty acids, such as acetate) in the digestion liquor may substantially reduce spore-forming pathogens (Salsali et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2015) and thus a two-phase thermophilic/mesophilic configuration could be applied to address such pathogens (Huyard et al., 2000) . Such an approach might also overcome the instabilities of the thermophilic reactors. In practice, a pasteurization stage (70°C for 1 h) either before or after the mesophilic AD is included to ensure the hygiene of the effluents (Sahlström, 2003) . Still, pasteurization does not fully inactivates all spore-forming microorganisms (bacteria or fungi) (Bagge et al., 2010; Sahlström, 2003; Schnürer and Schnürer, 2006) and it was proposed to combine it with alkaline hydrolysis for increasing the reliability of disinfection (Kaye et al., 1998) . In general, the wide diversity of pathogens renders WaW difficult to disinfection via a single technology, and often a combination of technologies is required (Viancelli et al., 2013) . Wastewater treatment research shows that pathogens partition between the solid and the liquid phase at variable proportions is a function of the treatment option and the status of the abiotic parameters in the treatment system (van der Drift et al., 1977; Zhang and Farahbakhsh, 2007) . Nevertheless, studies directly focusing on the distribution of pathogens between the solid and liquid fractions after separation are scarce. It was found however, that most indicator pathogens were retained in the liquid fraction . Additionally, improved animal management and housing techniques could also contribute in reducing pathogen load in animal WaW. Such techniques include vaccination and antibiotic therapy, adjustments of animal diets, on-farm hygienic and sanitation actions, and livestock housing management (Sobsey et al., 2006) .
