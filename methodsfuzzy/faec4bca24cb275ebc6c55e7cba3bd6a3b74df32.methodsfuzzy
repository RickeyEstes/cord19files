Plasmid construction. Full-length HEPIS isoform A and B coding sequence (CDS) was amplified from MCF-7  cDNA using PCR with the following primers: Forward,  5'-TTCAAGCTTATGTCTGCCCATATGTCAGG-3' and  reverse, 5'-TAA GGA TCC GTC ACA GGA TTT CTC TAA  GTC T-3 '. The PCR fragments were run on an agarose gel, photographed, recovered, digested with HindIII (AAGCTT) and BamHI (GGATCC) and cloned into the pEGFP-C3 vector (BD Biosciences). pEGFP-C3-HEPISa plasmid contained the CDS sequence of HEPIS isoform A, whereas pEGFP-C3-HEPISb plasmid contained the CDS sequence of HEPIS isoform B. The partial human HEPIS CDS was amplified from MCF-7 cDNA using PCR with the following primers: Forward, 5'-ATA CTC GAG GAA GTG GAG CAG GAT GTA-3' and reverse, 5'-ATA GCG GCC GCT CAG TCA CAG GAT TTC TC-3' , and the PCR fragments were cloned into the psiCHECK™-2 (Promega Corporation) vector using XhoI (CTCGAG) and NotI (GCGGCCGC) restriction sites. This partial human HEPIS CDS sequence contained the targeting site of the small interfering (si)RNAs described below. The target siRNA sequences for human HEPIS were 5'-GAT GC TAA CCT CCA AGT TT-3', 5'-GCA AGC AGC AGA AGA GAA A-3' and 5'-AGT TTA GTC CTG CAG AGAT-3'. These oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into pSilencer 4.1-CMVneo (Ambion; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) to construct HEPIS-specific siRNA expression plasmids siHEPIS-1, siHEPIS-2, and siHEPIS-3, respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol. pSilencer 4.1-CMVneo expressing scrambled siRNA (Ambion; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was used as si-control. Cell culture. HeLa and MCF-7 cells (ATCC) were maintained in high glucose DMEM (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone; GE Healthcare Life Sciences), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 U/ml) and incubated at 37˚C with 5% CO 2 . Cell transfection. HeLa and MCF-7 cells were transfected with plasmid using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 1x10 4 cells/well in 96-well plates, after 24 h of culture, the cells were transfected with 200 ng/well pEGFP-C3-HEPISa, pEGFP-C3-HEPISb, or pEGFP-C3 for subcellular localization. HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 7x10 4 cells/well in 24-well plates. After 24 h of culture, the cells were transfected with 800 ng/well pEGFP-C3, pEGFP-C3-HEPISa or pEGFP-C3-HEPISb plasmids for reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). MCF-7 cells were seeded at a density of 1x10 4 cells/well in 96-well plates. After 24 h of culture, the cells were co-transfected with 100 ng/well of either si-control, siHEPIS-1, siHEPIS-2 or siHEPIS-3 and 100 ng/well psiCHECK™-2-HEPIS for silencing target site selection; the cells were transfected with 200 ng/well pEGFP-C3-HEPISa, pEGFP-C3-HEPISb, pEGFP-C3, siHEPIS-3 or si-control for Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay; the cells were co-transfected with 80 ng/well of pEGFP-C3-HEPISa, pEGFP-C3-HEPISb, pEGFP-C3, siHEPIS-3 or si-control, 80 ng/well of pNF-κB-Luc and 40 ng/well pRL-TK for Dual-luciferase reporter (DLR) assay. MCF-7 cells were seeded at a density of 7x10 4 cells/well in 24-well plates. After 24 h of culture, the cells transfected with 800 ng/well pEGFP-C3, pEGFP-C3-HEPISa, pEGFP-C3-HEPISb, si-control or siHEPIS-3 plasmids for 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) cell proliferation assay and RT-qPCR; the cells were transfected with 800 ng/well of either pEGFP-C3-HEPISa, pEGFP-C3-HEPISb or pEGFP-C3 for western blotting. The cells were transfected with 800 ng/well of either pEGFP-C3-HEPISa or pEGFP-C3 for gene chip assay. Transmembrane domain prediction. The transmembrane domain of HEPIS was predicted by Transmembrane Hidden Markov Model (TMHMM) Server v.2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu. dk/services/TMHMM/).
