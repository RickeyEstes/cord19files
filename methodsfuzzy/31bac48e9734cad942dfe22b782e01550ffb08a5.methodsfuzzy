We carried out a retrospective review of the medical records to describe the clinical features of seven patients presenting with Coronavirus infection and the impact on the ICU. We collected demographic data, reason for admission, concomitant medical conditions, history of illness, clinical characteristics, results of laboratory investigations, disease assessment score including Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) and pneumonia severity index (PSI) of FINE [4] , management, and outcome. SAPS II score is used to assess disease severity and is calculated using the worst 12 physiological indicators during the first 24 hours in the ICU. Continuous variables are presented as median and interquartile range, and categorical variables are reported as number or frequency. As per French law (L.1121-1 paragraph 1 and R1121-2 Public Health Code), neither informed consent nor approval from an ethics committee were necessary for anonymous data extraction from an analysis of patients' medical charts.
