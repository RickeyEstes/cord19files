Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from otherwise healthy children admitted to the Pediatric Highly Intensive Care Unit of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca′ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy, for respiratory tract infections in February 2015 were evaluated. Respiratory secretions were collected immediately after admission to the hospital, by using a nasopharyngeal flocked swab (one swab per child), which was stored in a tube containing 1 mL of universal transport medium (Copan, Brescia, Italy). The analysis also included a number of nasopharyngeal samples, collected from children with communityacquired pneumonia, that had previously been found positive for M. pneumoniae with a validated real-time PCR method and had been stored at −80°C for no longer than 6 months. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca′ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. Written informed consent from a parent or legal guardian was obtained, and children ≥8 years of age were asked to provide their written consent. The general characteristics and clinical findings of the enrolled children were collected and archived on a previously prepared electronic chart. Nucleic acids were extracted from the swabs by using the NucliSens easyMAG automated extraction system (Biomeriéux, Craponne, France). A portion of the extract was tested for infectious agents using the Luminex NxTAG Assay and the Luminex RVP Fast Assay v2 (both produced by Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada). Both of these assays simultaneously detect, influenza A viruses (non-specific influenza A, A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and influenza A/H1N1 2009), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (types 1-4), hADV, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1), human enterovirus/rhinovirus (hEV/hRV) and human bocavirus, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Luminex Molecular Diagno stics Inc.). However, the NxTAG Assay is slightly less time consuming in comparison to RVP Fast Assay v2 (about 3.5 hours vs more than 4 hours). Moreover, the NxTAG Assay can differentiate RSV type A from RSV type B and can detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. The remaining extracts were tested for RSV A and B, hRV, hMPV, hADV and M. pneumoniae by using validated real-time PCR specific for each of the agents (Bosis et al., 2008; Esposito et al., 2015 Esposito et al., , 2016b Principi et al., , 2015 . The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and Cohen's kappa coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the NxTAG Assay were calculated; in agreement with previous definition (Cyr and Francis, 1992 ), a kappa coefficient higher than 0.80 was considered to indicate agreement. McNemar's test was applied to compare paired proportions. The analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (Cary, NC, USA).
