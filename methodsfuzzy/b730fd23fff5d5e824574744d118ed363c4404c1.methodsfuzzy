Bacterial strains and tissue specimens VTEC isolates from calves with diarrhea were collected by the South Dakota Animal Disease Research and Diagnostic Laboratory and the Department of Diagnostic Investigation at the University of Minnesota. Entire calves and tissues collected at field necropsies were routinely submitted to the laboratories. Historical and clinical information about each animal was obtained from submission forms and interviews with producers and veterinarians. Intestines were processed for histopathological examination using routine methods. Colonization was based upon observations under light microscopy of short bacilli which were intimately adherent to intestinal epithelial cells exhibiting irregular erosive lesions typical of attaching and effacing infections (Moxley and Francis, 1986; Janke et al., 1990) .
