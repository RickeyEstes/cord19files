The details of the cats in this case series were collated from clinical cases presenting to the authors CR, SH, DG-M, NJ and also from distant cases from veterinary surgeons or owners that contacted the above authors for advice via telephone, fax or email. All of the cases had long-term follow-up of at least a year after the initial episode. Cases were included if there was: (1) mutilation to the face or tongue or (2) repeated signs of oral discomfort without oral lesions or other pathology. Cases were excluded if they showed signs of mouth discomfort without mutilation where there was an obvious predisposing cause, eg, jaw neoplasia, and/or where the signs of discomfort resolved after having dental treatment alone. Information was collected on signalment; age at the first episode; whether the condition had resolved; whether the cat had a recurrent problem; the coexistence of dental disease or environmental stress, and whether the episodes of discomfort could be triggered by any particular event, eg, eating. Diagnostic tests with results, treatments tried and outcomes were also documented and the pedigrees of the cats (if available) were evaluated.
