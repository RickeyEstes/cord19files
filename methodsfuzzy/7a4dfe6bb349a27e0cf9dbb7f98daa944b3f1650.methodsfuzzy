Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following: sample was then linearly amplified by T7 in-vitro transcription, and the resulting RNA was fragmented and converted into a sequenceready library by tagging the samples with pool barcodes and illumina adapter sequences during ligation, RT, and PCR. Each pool of cells was tested for library quality, and concentration was assessed as described (Jaitin et al., 2014; Paul et al., 2015) .
