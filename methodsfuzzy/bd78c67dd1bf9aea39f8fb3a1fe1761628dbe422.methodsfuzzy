Cells and virus. LLC-PK porcine kidney cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. The tissue culture-adapted PSaV strain Cowden was recovered from the full-length infectious clone pCV4A and was propagated in LLC-PK cells supplemented with bile acid (15) . Chemicals and antibodies. Celecoxib, NS-398, SC-58125, SC-236, nimesulide, and SC-560 were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). GCDCA, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), L-NAME, MDL-12330A, and indomethacin were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). COX-1 siRNA, COX-2 siRNA, and scrambled siRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Monoclonal antibody (MAb) against mouse COX-1 and polyclonal antibody against rabbit COX-2 were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). Mouse MAb against HA tag was purchased from OriGene (Rockville, MD, USA). Synthetic PGE 2 was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO, USA). The anti-PSaV capsid MAb and the anti-PSaV VPg polyclonal antibody were previously described (41) . The secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat immunoglobulin against rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA) and mouse IgG (Santa Cruz) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat immunoglobulin against rabbit IgG (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratory, West Grove, PA, USA). Cytotoxicity assay. The cytotoxicity of the chemicals used in this study was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (42, 43) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells in 96-well plates were incubated with medium containing different concentrations of various chemicals for 24 h. After removal of the medium, 200 l of MTT solution was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37°C in a CO 2 incubator. Each well was supplemented with 150 l of DMSO and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The absorbance as an optical density (OD) was read in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader at 570 nm. The percent cell viability was calculated using the following formula: [(OD sample Ϫ OD blank )/(OD control Ϫ OD blank )] ϫ 100. Nontoxic concentrations of each chemical were used in the study.
