The success of the RT-LAMP method relies on the specificity of the designed primer sets. The primers were selected to target the prM gene derived from the T1P1 strain of the JE virus. In order to validate the sensitivity and specificity of the primer set, 0.1 and 0.5 g of total RNA extracted from JE virus-or mock-infected BHK-21 cells were separately subjected to the RT-LAMP reaction at 42 • C and 60 min for RT and subsequently at 65 • C and 60 min for the LAMP reaction. In the meantime, the RT-PCR was used in the same experiment as a positive control. The results indicated that the viral RNA could be detected from the extract of JE virus-infected BHK-21 cells, but not that from mock-infected cells, at both concentrations, shown as DNA ladder-like products (Fig. 1A) . In the RT-PCR, viral RNA was also detected and showed a single band representing the 868-bp fragment (Fig. 1B) . To examine the limit of the reaction time, LAMP was performed at 10-min intervals (20-60 min). While the viral gene was detected as early as 40 min, a time course of 60 min for amplification was shown to be the optimal condition (Fig. 2) .
