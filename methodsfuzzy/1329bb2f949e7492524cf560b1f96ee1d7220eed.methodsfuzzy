There are two methods to derive a reasonable pharmacophore model. One is from the crystal structure of proteinligand complex, another is based on molecular modeling of enzyme with its potential inhibitors. Here we used the experimental structure of SARS-CoV main proteinase complexed with its peptide inhibitor CMK (PDB ID 1UK4) [19] and the predicted structures of SARS-CoV main proteinase with six drugs/compounds [20] for establishing pharmacophore models. The structures of CMK peptide and six compounds are shown in Fig. 1 . The POCKET module in LigBuilder program [21] was employed to obtain the pharmacophore models of SARS-CoV main proteinase. This approach was successfully applied to the identification of novel inhibitors for alanine racemase [22] . The proposed pharmacophore model is a binding-site-derived pharmacophore model, which includes the following pharmacophore features of ligands binding to the enzyme's active site: a positively charged nitrogen atom (ammonium cation) to represent a hydrogen bond donor (HBD), a negatively charged oxygen atom (as in a carboxyl group) to represent a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), and a carbon atom (methane) to represent a hydrophobic center (HPC). A pharmacophore model is generated for each protein-ligand complex.
