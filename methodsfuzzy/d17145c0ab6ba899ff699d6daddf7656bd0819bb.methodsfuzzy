Cell culture, transfection, and virus infection 293T, Vero E6 and FRhK-4 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) at 37Â°C in a CO 2 incubator. Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) was applied for transient transfection following the manufacturer's procedure. For SARS-CoV infection, FRhK-4 cells were inoculated with virus (GZ 50 Strain) as previously described (Zhong et al., 2003) at MOI of 5 for 1 h in medium without FBS. After 1 h, the cells were washed with medium and cultured with complete medium for the required time. All procedures with SARS-CoV infection were performed in a biosafety level-3 laboratory.
