The proposed IAQ audit follows a systematic approach with portable equipment, involving the measurement of physical parameters (temperature (dry bulb), relative humidity and the concentration of the suspended particulate matter (PM 10 )), the monitoring of the concentrations of selected chemical indicators (carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (HCHO), and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs)), and the measurements of biological indicators (bacteria, fungi, Legionella). In the reported case, air exchange rates (AERs) were measured by the concentration-decay method using metabolic CO 2 as the tracer gas. The IAQ audit commences with the collection and analysis of the available architectural, mechanical and electrical drawings follows by the walkthrough inspection in order to verify and update the information provided by the building owner or responsible agent, as well as observation for any apparent or potential pollutant sources, occupant's activities and complaints, swift verification of CO 2 levels in the building, pre-evaluation of the hygienic and maintenance conditions of the HVAC systems, and collection of additional information which is deemed necessary for an adequate audit planning. All collected information on the building and its HVAC systems, including during the walkthrough inspection, is considered to determine the quantity and locations of the required sampling points, a crucial task for the suitable planning of the measuring campaign. The next stage of the audit involves the measurement of the specified indicators, followed by the evaluation phase. In this phase, the measured data will be analyzed and compared with standards/regulations specified limits and the sources of IAQ problems will be identified, with the help of an integral correlation between all indicators measured and information acquired. Finally a set of corrective actions will be recommended to the building owner/manager.
