Cell culture MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), were plated at a density of 4 ·10 3 per cm 2 and maintained as described before [27] . Cells were irradiated 48 hours post-plating in a Cs 137 irradiator (Gammacell 1000 Elite/3000 Elan) at a dose rate of 475 cGy/minute or in X-ray irradiator (Polaris sc-500 series II) at a dose rate of 100 cGy/minute. Rapamycin, Vorinostat (LC laboratories, Boston, MA), Ku-0063794 (Selleck, Houston, TX) and salubrinal (Calbiochem-Merck4Biosciences, Germany) were added to the cultures from stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Control cultures received equal eIF2α -An Effector of mTOR -Modulates DNA Repair amounts of the vehicle. DMSO concentration in the medium did not exceed 0.08%. Drugs were added to the culture immediately following radiation.
