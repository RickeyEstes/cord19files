HIV-1 Virion Production. HIV-1 virion particles were prepared as described. 23 Briefly, HIV-1 NL4-3 (group M, subtype B) derived by the transfection of 293T cells with pNL4-3 (obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: pNL4-3 from Dr. Malcolm Martin 24 ) was used to infect cells from a non-Hodgkin's T cell lymphoma line (SupT1-CCR5). 25 Purified HIV-1 preparations (1000× concentrates) were stored frozen at −80°C until used. In Virio RNA Modification and Extraction of RNA Genomes from Virions. Virions were treated as described, 26 with the exception that the 1M7 SHAPE reagent was used in place of NMIA. Briefly, virions treated with 1M7 or unmodified virions were digested with subtilisin and centrifuged through a 20% (w/v) sucrose cushion prior to the extraction of genomes. 27 Virions were then lysed by incubation in virion lysis buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 15 μL 20 mg/mL proteinase K] (using 100 μL lysing buffer per 1 mL volume of 1000× HIV-1 culture supernatant concentrate) for 30 min at room temperature. The digest was extracted four times with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, followed by four extractions with pure chloroform. The aqueous layer was brought to a NaCl concentration of 300 mM, nucleic acids were precipitated with 70% ethanol, and samples were stored at −20°C. Pelleted RNA was resuspended in storage buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8) at a final RNA concentration of 400 nM. These aliquots were flash frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at −80°C. Folding of Ex Virio RNA. For each reaction, 1 μL of 400 nM ex virio RNA (prepared as described above, without in virio RNA chemical modification) was dissolved in a Mg 2+containing standard folding buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 8), 200 mM potassium acetate (pH 8), and 3 mM MgCl 2 ] to promote the formation of native-like interactions (total volume was 20 μL). This mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min before SHAPE modification. Formamide Denaturation. For the formamide denaturation experiments, 1 μL of 400 nM ex virio RNA was resuspended in 5 μL of folding buffer and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. A formamide-containing folding buffer [67% (v/v) deionized formamide, 50 mM HEPES (pH 8), 200 mM potassium acetate (pH 8), and 3 mM MgCl 2 ] was then combined with the appropriate amount of standard folding buffer and added to the reaction mix to obtain the desired formamide concentration in a reaction volume of 20 μL. Experiments were performed at final formamide concentrations of 0% to 60%, in increments of 10%. The RNA was incubated in formamide for 20 min at 37°C prior to SHAPE modification. LNA Oligonucleotide Design. We used 9-and 10-nt LNA oligonucleotides (Exiqon) that were the reverse complements of HIV-1 sequences comprising helices proposed in the SHAPE-directed frameshift model. The sequences were chosen to avoid self-complementarity and to avoid stretches of three or more G or C nucleotides. When possible, we included flanking single-stranded regions as part of the targeted strand to facilitate LNA binding to structured helices. SHAPE Modification of Ex Virio, LNA-Bound, and Formamide-Denatured RNA. SHAPE modification was performed by adding 9 μL each of RNA sample to 1 μL of 40 mM SHAPE reagent (1M7 for standard SHAPE reactions and 1M6 and NMIA for differential SHAPE reactions) or 1 μL of neat DMSO as a no-reagent control. The samples were incubated for 4 min at 37°C. We then added 1 μL of 50 mM EDTA and performed a cleanup step to remove LNA oligonucleotides if necessary (RNeasy Mini Kit; Qiagen). The resulting mixture (100 μL) was precipitated with 10 μL of 2 M NaCl and 300 μL of ethanol and stored at −80°C until primer extension. Primer Extension and Capillary Electrophoresis Detection of SHAPE Adduct Sites. Pellets containing SHAPE-modified or control RNA were resuspended in 7 μL of 0.5× TE and 6 μL of 0.4 μM VIC-labeled DNA primer (Applied Biosciences). Primer extension reactions for LNA binding experiments were performed using DNA primers complementary to RNA genome nucleotide positions (see above) 1750−1771 (primer 6.2, with sequence ATC GGC TCC TGC TTC TGA GAG G) and 2033−2054 (primer 7, with sequence CAA TTA TGT TGA CAG GTG TAG G). We used primer 6.2 for formamide denaturation experiments and primer 7 for in virio experiments. Primer extension reactions were performed as described. 28, 29 Data Processing. Raw capillary electropherograms were processed using QuShape. 28 Briefly, key processing steps include a mobility shift to correct for small differences in the electrophoretic mobility between the NED and VIC fluorescent dyes and a signal decay correction to account for signal attenuation as the distance from the reverse transcriptase primer binding site increases. DMSO control peaks were subtracted from reagent peaks, and the resulting SHAPE reactivities were normalized on a scale where a normalized reactivity of 1.0 was defined as the average intensity of the top 10% most reactive peaks, excluding a few highly reactive nucleotides taken to be outliers. The resulting reactivities span a scale from 0 to ∼1.5, where 0 indicates no reactivity (and a highly constrained nucleotide) and reactivities >0.7 typically indicate highly flexible nucleotides. Secondary Structure Modeling. SHAPE-directed models for the frameshift domain were created by incorporating SHAPE data into the RNAstructure folding algorithm. 17, 18 For HIV, we used values of m = 3.0 kcal/mol and b = −0.6 kcal/ mol. To account for LNA binding, the LNA target site was forced to be single stranded by imposing artificial SHAPE reactivity values of 100. For LNA 5 and 6, which target the highly stable anchoring helix, base pairing was also prohibited at partner nucleotides as the observed reactivity increases were taken to imply a single stranded state. Plasmid Construction. Complementary synthetic oligonucleotides (IDT) with BamH I and Sac I compatible ends were phosphorylated, annealed, and ligated into the p2luc vector using the BamH I and Sac I sites between the rluc and fluc reporter genes. 22 Plasmid DNA was purified from cell cultures (Qiagen), and the sequences of all constructs were verified by sequencing. RNA Synthesis, Purification, and the Frameshift Assay. RNAs for the frameshift assay were transcribed in vitro from p2luc plasmid DNA linearized with PmlI, purified His6-tagged T7 RNA polymerase (10×), 11.25 mM NTPs, and 2 units of RNase inhibitor (RNasin Plus; Promega, N2615) in 200 μL for 2 h at 37°C. Pyrophosphate was pelleted by centrifugation (10 min, 13,200 rpm), and RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform. Unincorporated NTPs and salt were separated from the RNA by gel filtration (Ilustra MicroSpin G-25 Columns; GE Healthcare). RNAs were heated at 95°C for 5 min followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. Samples were lyophilized to dryness and resuspended in water at 1 μg/μL. RNA integrity and purity were confirmed with 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. In vitro frameshift assays were completed with each RNA reporter using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL System; Promega, nuclease treated, L416A). Translation reactions contained 0.63 μg of RNA, 10 units of RNase inhibitor, and 8.8 μL of RRL in 12.5 μL. Following a 90 min incubation at 37°C , reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 6 mM. For each reporter, a minimum of three independent frameshift assays were completed using different preparations of mRNA (full biological replicates). Independent biological replicate assays included four replicate reactions. Luminescence was measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay (Promega). Readings were taken with a microplate luminometer (Veritas) equipped with dual-injectors (Turner Biosystems) for 10 s after 25 μL of the respective substrate was injected into the reaction mixture (2 s lag time prior to measurement). Each experiment included an in-frame positive control 22 with a mutated "non-slippery sequence" and an additional nucleotide inserted immediately before the Sac I site, which places the rluc and fluc genes inframe. Frameshift efficiencies were calculated by taking the ratio of the experimental to control luminescence (firefly to Renilla). Small variations in the activities of control reactions were observed with different preparations of mRNA and reticulocyte lysates. To account for these differences, frameshift efficiencies were normalized relative to wild-type levels, and averaged. The non-normalized frameshift efficiencies for the native sequence construct in all biological replicates (n = 9) was 5.4 ± 0.9%. Standard deviations were propagated to yield a standard error of the mean (SEM).
