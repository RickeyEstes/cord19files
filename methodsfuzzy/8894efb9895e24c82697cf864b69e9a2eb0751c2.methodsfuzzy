Restriction endonuclease digests and ligations were performed as recommended by the suppliers. Plasmid purification, agarose gel electrophoresis, fill-in reactions of sticky-ended DNA fragments using T4 DNA polymerase, and DNA-mediated transformation of Escherichia coli were done according to standard procedures (Maniatis et al., 1982) . Lithium acetate transformations of yeast were performed as described (Jto et al., 1983) . A disruption of the chromosomal STE/3 locus was constructed by onestep gene disruption (l~thstein, 1983) , using the plasmid pSLK349 (kindly provided by Dr. George Sprague). pSL349 consists of pBR322 containing a 7.2 kbp BamHI STE/3 fragment, from which a 1.6-kbp BclI fragment within the coding region of the DPAP A lumenal domain (C. A. Flanagan, D. A. Barnes, M. C. Flessel, and J. Thorner, manuscript submitted for publication) was replaced by the 2.9-kbp BglII LEU2 fragment. To create a strain lacking both DPAP A and DPAP B, a disruption of the chromosomal DAP2 locus with the HIS3 gene was made using the plasmid pGP6, which contains the 1.2-kbp EcoRI-BamHI HIS3 fragment (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989) in place of the L3-kbp BstEII-KpnI portion of the coding region of DAP2 (Roberts et al., 1989) . The c~-factor signal sequence was fused to the lumenal domain of DPAP B as follows: a Sail linker was inserted at the Hincll site of plasmid p771, which contains a portion of the 5' region of the MFcd gene (Kurjan and Herskowitz, 1982) , including 70 bp of non-coding region (not including the UAS) and 66 bp of coding region, including the signal sequence, signal peptidase cleavage site (Waters et al., 1988) , and 3 NH2-terminal residues of pro-a-factor, fused to the KRE/gene (Boone et ai., 1990) . The AccI site at position +140 of the DAP2 gene was changed to a SalI site using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1987) . Mutagenesis of DAP2 was performed using the vector pCJR27, which contains the 3.3-kbp BamHI-HindIII DA/'2 fragment in the plasmid KS + (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The 2.7-kbp SalI-HindUI fragment, encoding the lumenal domain of DPAP B, was inserted into the SalI-HindIII sites of p771/SalI, fusing the coding regions of MFal and DAP2 in frame, c~Fss-B was placed under the control of the GA/_J promoter (Johnston and Davis, 1984) by inserting the 2.9-kbp BamHI-HindIII fragment from this plasmid into the BamHI-HindIII sites of pC JR52, which contains the 822-bp EcoRI-BamHI GA/_,/ promoter fragment inserted into EcoRI-BamHI sites of the CEN plasmid pSEYC68 Ca modified version of pSEYC58; Emr et al., 1983) . The resulting fusion protein consists of the NH2-terminal 22 residues of prepro-afactor and two residues arising from linker sequences fused to residue 49 of the lumenal domain of DPAP B (Fig. l B ; amino acid sequence NH2-MRFPSIFTAVLFAASSALA-APVGRPHH . . . ). The BB-Inv fusion protein expression vectors, pCJR13 and pC JR15 (2p and CEN plasmids, respectively), were constructed by inserting the 0.6-kbp BamHI-AccI fragment (AccI blunt ended) into the invertase fusion vectors pSEY304 (a derivative of the 2/z plasmid pSEY303; Emr et al., 1986) and the CEN plasmid pSEYC306 (Johnson et al., 1987) at the BamHI and Hin-dIII sites (HindlIJ blunt ended). The resulting fusion protein contains the 48 NH2-terminal residues of DPAP B fused to residue three of cytoplasmic invertase ( Fig. 1 B) . BB-Inv was placed under the control of the GAL/promoter by cutting pCJR15 with EcoRI and HiedIII and ligating in the 822-bp GAL/fragment (Johnston and Davis, 1984) . This fused the 3' end of the GAL/fragment at nucleotide -92 of the DAP2 sequence. Vectors encoding A20-BB and A27-BB were constructed as follows. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1987) was used to create 60-and 81-bp deletions in DAP2 (A20-BB and A27-BB, respectively) in pCJR27. The ~3.2kbp BamHI-HindIII mutant DAP2 fragments were inserted into the BamHI-HindIII sites of the CEN plasmid pSEYC58, creating pMNH1 (620-BB) and pC JR45 (A27-BB). &20-BB and A27-BB were over-produced by replacing the DAP2 promoter with the GAL/promoter as follows. The HindIII site at -92 of DAP2 was blunt ended and religated, creating an NheI site. The ~3-kbp NheI-HindIII fragments of pC JR43 and pC JR44 were inserted at the XbaI-HindIII sites of pC JR52, creating pC JR56 and pC JR54, respectively. The A20 and A27 deletions removed residues 2-21 and 2-27 of DPAP B, changing the NH2-terr~nal acid sequence of DPAP B from NH2-MEG-GEEEVERIPDELFDTKKKHLLDKLIRV30 to NH2-MHLLDKLIRV and NH2-MIRV, respectively ( Fig. 1 B) . The 2pt plasmid encoding DPAP A, pCJR46, was constructed as follows: the 5.9-kbp XbaI-BamHI fragment, containing the STF_J3 gene (C. A. Flanagan, D. A. Barnes, M. C. Flessel, andJ. Thorner, manuscript submitted for publication) was isolated from the plasmid p13-3 (Julius et al., 1983) and inserted into pUC13. The 5.9-kbp SalI-BamI-II fragment from this vector was inserted into the XhoI-BglII sites of the 2# plasmid pCKR201 (C. Raymond and T. Stevens, unpublished results) . The CEN plasmid pCJR78 was made by inserting the 4.5-kbp EagI-PvuII STE/3 fragment into the EagLEcoRV sites of pRS316 (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989) . The plasmid pC JR64, encoding the fusion protein AA-B, was constructed by inserting the 2.5-kbp BamHI-MluI (MluI blunt ended) fragment from p13-3, encoding the STF.J3 promoter and the cytoplasmic and trans- membrane domains of DPAP A, and the 2.7-kbp Sall-HindlII fragment of DAP2 (Sail blunt ended), encoding the lumenal domain of DPAP B, into the BamHI-HindlII sites of pSEYC58. The 5.2-kbp BamHI-HindlII fragment of the resulting vector (pCJR41) was cloned into the BamHI-HindlII sites of the 2# plasmid, pSEY18 (Emr et al., 1986) . The resulting plasmid encodes AA-B, which consists of the NH2-terminal 150 residues of DPAP A to residue 47 of DPAP B (Fig. 1 C) . For the construction of the fusion protein A-BB, XbaI sites were created in both the DAP2 and STE/3 genes just upstream of the coding regions of the transmembrane domains of DPAP B and DPAP A, respectively, using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1987) . Nucleotides 69 and 70 of the DAP2 gene were changed from GT to TC (Roberts et al., 1989) , and nucleotides 342-344 of STE/3 were changed from GCC to AGA (with the A of the initiation codon as 1) (C. A. Flanagan, D. A. Barnes, M. C. Flessel, and J. Thorner, manuscript submitted for publication). A 1.1kbp SacI-XbaI fragment (encoding the STE13 promoter and the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A) and a 2.8-kbp Xbal-HindlII DAP2 fragment (encoding the transmembrane and lumenal domains of DPAP B) were ligated into the SacI-HindlII sites of pSEY18. The resulting plasmid (pCJR67) encodes a protein consisting of 113 residues of the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A fused to amino acid 24 of DPAP B (Fig. 1 C) . The fusion protein B-A-B was constructed as follows: the 3.3-kbp BamHI-HindUI DAP2 fragment, including the Xbal site at +70, was ligated into the BamHI-HindlII sites of pSEYC58. A 4.3-kbp Xbal-HindlII fragment of STE/3, encoding the transmembrane and lumenal domains of DPAP A, was inserted into the XbaI-HindlII sites, resulting in the plasmid pC JR58. The 2.7-kbp SalI-HindIII DAP2 fragment (SalI blunt ended), encoding the DPAP B lumenal domain, was inserted into the MluI-HindlII sites (MluI blunt ended) of pCJR58, resulting in pCJR69, a CEN plasmid encoding B-A-B. The 4.8-kbp BamHI-HindlII fragment from pCJR69 was inserted into the same sites of pSEY18, resulting in pCJRT0. B-A-B was placed under the control of the GAL/promoter by cloning the NheI-HindlII B-A-B fragment into the XbaI-HindlII sites of pCJR52, creating pC JR79. The B-A-B fusion protein consists of residues 116-150 of DPAP A in place of residues 26-46 of DPAP B ( Fig. 1 C) . Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the portion of STE/3 encoding the 118 amino acid cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A ( Fig. 1 A) was performed in pCJR71, which consists of the 0.65-kbp EagI-PstI fragment of STE/3 inserted into the EagI-PstI sites of KS +. A 66-bp in-frame deletion, removing the amino acids 85-106 (z~22), was created, and the Sacl-MluI fragment from this plasmid was inserted into the SacI-MluI sites of pCJR64, creating the 2# plasmid pSN58, which encodes A92-AAB ( Fig.  1 C) . The same SacI-MluI fragment was ligated with the 4-kbp MluI-Hindlll (encoding the lumenal domain of DPAP A) into the SacI-HindIII sites of pSEY18, creating pSN59, which encodes A22-AAA ( Fig. 1 C) . A22-AA-B was placed under the control of the GAL/promoter by fusing a SacI-EagI fragment from pCJR125 (contains the 360 bp HindlII-EcoRl GAL/fragment in pGEM-5Zf) to an Eagl-HindlII fragment from pSN58, both of which were ligated into the SacI-HindlII sites of pSEY18, creating pSN89. The Fusl-LacZp expression plasmid pCJRll4 as follows: a 6-kb NheI-HindllI fragment, encoding the 254 NH2-terminal amino acids of the FUS1 protein fused to ~-galactosidase, under the GALl promoter (isolated from pCJRll3, a derivative of pSB231 (Trueheart and Fink, 1989) ) was cloned into the Xbal-Hindlll sites of pVT105U, a 2# plasmid (Vernet et al., 1987) , creating pCJR114. For the production of DPAP A antigen to be used to generate DPAP A antiserum, the plasmid pCJR24 was constructed by inserting the 0.8-kbp MluI-Hpal (MluI blunt ended) STE/3 fragment into the Sinai site of pEXP1, an E. coli expression vector containing the Tac promoter just upstream of the translational start codon of T4 lysozyme and a multiple cloning site (Raymond et al., 1990) .
