Glass slide format microarray slides were hybridized with amplified, Cy3-labelled target DNAs as published previously [53] , with minor modifications. Slides were prehybridized in 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS and 4× Denhardts solution (Sigma-Aldrich), washed in sterile, nuclease-free water, followed by 100% isopropyl alcohol then air-dried. Cy3-labelled randomly-amplified target DNAs were denatured at 95 • C for 3 min then diluted to a final concentration of 80 µg/mL in 5× SSC buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1% SDS, 4× Denhardts solution. Forty microlitres of this hybridization mix were then applied to the microarray slide, covered with a glass coverslip, placed in a humidified multislide chamber (Genetix Inc., Wallsend, UK), then incubated at 50 • C for 16 h. The slides were then washed once in each of the following buffers for two minutes: (A) 1× SSC, 0.2% SDS, 50 • C, (B) 0.1× SSC, 0.2% SDS, 50 • C, (C) 0.1× SSC, 0.2% SDS, 20 • C, then centrifuged to dryness at 213× g for 5 min then scanned using an Affymetrix 428 microarray laser scanner at a gain of sixty. 2.5.2. Hybridization to Pan-Pathogen Arrays Using Randomly-Amplified Cy3 Labelled Targets Using the Advalytix Slidebooster™ Hybridization Station. Nonspecific hybridization to unrelated oligonucleotides was observed to a number of oligonucleotide probes on the array, using both pathogen and nonpathogen labelled nucleic acids. To address this issue and to attempt to reduce these events, nonmanual hybridizations were conducted using a Advalytix Slidebooster™ hybridization (Beckman Coulter UK, High Wycombe, UK) and wash station with addition of a blocking agent i.e., Denhardts solution and 16% formamide to the hybridization buffer to reduce background from nonspecific hybridization [73] . Microarray slides were prehybridized as described for manual hybridizations then placed array side up into a Slidebooster hybridization chamber containing sonic agitation chips, with coupling fluid placed between the slide-base and the platform, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lifter-slips were then placed on the slide, gasket side down and the slide left to preheat to 50 • C, prior to addition of labelled target. Preprepared target DNAs (Cy3-labelled randomly-amplified targets DNAs denatured at 95 • C for 3 min, then diluted to a final concentration of 120 µg/mL in 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 4× Denhardts solution, 16% formamide at 50 • C) were then applied to the Lifter-slip edge, drawing the labelled target onto the array by capillary motion. Use of this platform was found also to significantly reduce the time of incubation needed. Thus, the slides were then incubated at 50 • C for six hours, at a maximum mixing power of 27. After incubation the slides were removed, placed in an Advawash™ chamber and washed according to the protocol for manual hybridizations described above. The slides were centrifuged to dryness at 213× g for 5 min and then scanned using an Affymetrix 428 microarray laser scanner at a gain of sixty. We have shown previously that identification of pathogen-specific identification signatures was achieved using highly purified pathogen nucleic acids and were observed tentatively with some patient CSF DNA samples. This latter result may be due in part to low abundance of the bacterial DNA and high nonspecific background signals from contaminating host DNAs. As the signal-to-noise ratios with our existing hybridization buffers and protocols were not satisfactory, we sought to improve this technical issue through the use of 16% formamide-containing hybridization buffers and an automated hybridization station, the Advalytix Slidebooster™, to improve sample mixing during hybridization. Patient CSF samples were again hybridized to the meningitis glass slide array, (as described in Section 2.6). Samples of no added DNA, human Donor DNA, N. lactamica HPA1, N. meningitidis strain Z5005 (Serogroup A), N. meningitidis strain Z4673 (Serogroup B) and S. agalactiae amplified targets were used as negative and positive controls. The results were confirmed for N. meningitidis using real-time PCR assay for the ctrA gene. The data obtained are shown in Figure 3 and Supplementary Material S7. The combined data for all these hybridizations and real-time PCR results are summarised in Table 1 . Overall formamide-containing buffers gave lower fluorescence binding intensity signals, across all probes. Addition of 16% formamide reduced overall signal intensities by approximately seven-fold. There was an observed overall improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio and the nonspecific hybridization to previously identified rogue probes e.g., StAU5 was greatly reduced. N. lactamica, N. meningitidis strains Z5005 and Z4673 and S. agalactiae hybridizations gave strong pathogen-specific binding signals to specific oligonucleotide probes, as expected for those sample DNAs. Data of high fluorescence intensity and good confidence were obtained with some samples e.g., CSF1S, CSF1P, CSF2P, CSF4S and CSF7P. Pathogen-specific signals could be ascribed to these samples, with some degree of confidence. Data of low fluorescence intensity and reasonably good confidence were obtained with other samples e.g., CSF3S, CSF4P, CSF6S, CSF6P and CSF7S; pathogen-specific signals could be tentatively ascribed to these samples. The remaining hybridizations produced data of low fluorescence intensity and low confidence e.g., CSF2S, CSF3P, CSF5S and CSF5P; pathogen-specific signals could not be ascribed to these samples with any degree of confidence. Thus, putative Neisseria-specific hybridization profiles were seen with patient CSF samples, CSF1S, CSF1P, CSF2P, CSF3S, CSF4S and CSF4P, CSF6S and CSF6P and CSF7S. These results corresponded more precisely with the results of the real-time PCR for N. meningitidis ctrA, as five out of six real time-PCR (RT-PCR) positive samples were now correctly identified, although some RT-PCR negative samples now appear positive e.g., CSF3S, CSF6P and CSF7S. These discrepancies may be due to the fact that we are working at the limits of detection and there are likely to be sampling errors between High-Throughput 2018, 7, 32 14 of 30 different aliquots of the same sample. Tentative serogroup identification could be made in two of the Neisseria-containing samples, serogroup X in CSF4P and serogroup C/D in CSF6S and CSF6P, as hybridization to serogroup-specific probes were observed in these samples. A streptococci profile was observed again in CSF7P. No specific species could be assigned for this sample.
