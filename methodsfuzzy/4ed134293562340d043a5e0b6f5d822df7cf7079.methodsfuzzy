This study utilized four tools, two ontologies and two annotation databases for inferring functional and disease insights from list of human proteins involved in 3D domain swapping. Protein domain enrichment was performed using DAVID 6.7. Protein domain annotations were derived from Pfam database, a database of evolutionarily conserved protein domain coordinates. Ontologizer 2.0, a GO term enrichment tool with commandline interface and improved statistical method for deriving GO terms enriched in a given list of proteins was used in this study. SubPathwayMiner, an R package that internally handles KEGG annotations for pathway enrichment analysis were used to derive statistically significant pathways associated with the dataset. Enriched disease ontology terms were identified using Functional Disease Ontology server that consults Disease Ontology and it's derivative disease-ontology lite for identifying significant diseases. H 0 = List of curated proteins with swapped conformations are not associated with any class of protein domains, gene ontology terms, KEGG pathways or disease ontology terms. We tested our null hypothesis individually using four different tools and associated annotations or ontologies. P-value from enrichment analyses were obtained using default statistical settings of different tools employed in this study. Protein domain enrichment P-values were derived from DAVID using a modified Fisher Exact P-value, called EASE score [81] . GO term enrichment analysis P-values were derived using Ontologizer 2.0 and corrected using Bonferroni method [68] . KEGG pathway enrichment using SubPathwayMiner, it provides False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrected P-values. Disease enrichment analysis was performed using Functional Disease Ontology server and it uses a Fisher's exact test for deriving Pvalues.
