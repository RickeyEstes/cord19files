Zika IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) was performed accordingly to the guidelines from CDC [13] with minor modifications. A humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-flavivirus kindly provided by CDC was used as positive control. Antigens (ZIKV or Mock) were derived from β-propiolactone inactivated cell-culture supernatant from non-infected and ZIKV infected cells. For ZIKV genome detection, viral RNA was extracted from 140 μL of samples using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Real-time RT-PCR was performed as described by Lanciotti et al. (2008) [14] , using 5 μL of RNA and Go-Taq Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR System (Promega). Assays were performed in the LightCycler 96 instrument (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and human RNAse P was used as endogenous control [15] .
