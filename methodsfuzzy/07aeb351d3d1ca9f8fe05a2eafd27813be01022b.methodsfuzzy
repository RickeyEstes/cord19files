Plant materials and preparation of TSL-1 TS leaves were obtained in Tuku (Yunlin County, Taiwan). The leaves were picked and washed with water as described by Chang et al. in 2002 [25] . Reverse osmosis water was added to TS leaves at a proportion of 4 L of reverse osmosis water to 1 kg of leaves. The mixture was boiled for 30 minutes, after which the leaves were removed and the remaining liquid concentrated over low heat and filtered with a sieve (70 meshes). The filtered concentrate was lyophilized with a Virtis apparatus (Gardiner, NY, USA) to obtain a crude extract. The crude extracts were centrifuged at 1400g for 12 minutes, and the supernatantlabeled TSL-1 (an advanced bioactive fraction of TS) was used for this study. The extracts were then concentrated in a vacuum, freeze-dried to form a powder, and stored at Ã€20 C for subsequent analysis. Various doses of TSL-1, from 5 mg/mL to 50 mg/mL, were used in this study.
