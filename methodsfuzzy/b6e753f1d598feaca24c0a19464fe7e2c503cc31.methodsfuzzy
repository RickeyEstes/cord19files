Solutions and reagents. The following buffers were used: NET (0. Virus was released from cells in the suspension by freezing and thawing four times, and particulate matter was removed by centrifuging at 5,000 g in a Spinco 40 rotor for 20 min. The supernatant was retained in an ice bath while the pellet was resuspended in PBS to 20% of the original volume and recentrifuged; both supernatants were then combined for purification. Virus was partially purified by adsorption to and elution from human "0" erythrocytes according to the method of Kaye et al. (1970) . Virus-adsorbed erythrocytes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and virus was finally eluted in two steps at 37" into approximately 20% of the original volume of PBS. In some early purifications, the eluate was then treated with ribonuclease and deoxyribonuclease (each at 50 pg/ml final concentration) in order to degrade any cellular nucleic acids adherent to the virus. When later work revealed that the profile of RNA extracted from virus treated in this manner was similar to that from untreated virus, we omitted the step. Virus in the eluate was then concentrated by centrifuging through a 15% sucrose interface to a 0.75-ml cushion of 65% sucrose in NET at 43,200 g for 30 min in a Spinco SW 36 rotor. The concentrates were pooled, diluted with NET, and centrifuged to equilibrium for 15 hr at 97,lOOg through a lo-ml 25-65% sucrose gradient in NET at 7" in an SW 36 rotor. Thirtydrop fractions were collected, and aliquots of each were assayed for total radioactivity, hemagglutinin, density (from refractive index), and absorbance at 280 nm. A typical profile is seen in Fig. 1A . Two visible bands are present: (1) a lower opalescent band in the density range 1.168-1.202 g/ml containing all hemagglutinin activity and (2) an upper, more flocculent band of membranous material, having a density of 1.074-1.133 g/ml and no hemagglutinin. Fractions 6-10 containing the lower band were then pooled, diluted with NET, and centrifuged in a velocity gradient in the SW 36 rotor for 1 hr at 43,200 g in a 9.0ml 15-65% sucrose gradient in NET. Fractions were collected and assayed for hemagglutinin and radioactivity. The profile in Fig. 1B equilibrium centrifugation may be further resolved into (1) a fast-sedimenting peak with radioactivity but little hemagglutinin, and (2) an upper heterogeneous peak of coincident hemagglutinin and radioactivity. The lower peak, which is not usually visible, probably consists of internal cell membranes and has been observed by Pocock and Garwes (1975) in the purification of TGEV. Heterogeneity in the upper peak is consistent with the high degree of pleomorphism observed for coronaviruses (Almeida et al., 1968) . Fractions from the upper peak, which were shown by electron microscopy to contain highly purified virus, were pooled, diluted to 5% sucrose with NET, and held at 4" for RNA analysis. Final virus preparations contained ap proximately 11 cpm/HA unit and purification resulted in a 1Cfold enrichment of hemagglutinin per unit of protein. RNA extraction. The following methods were used. (1) In the warm phenol-SDS (WPS) method (Tannock, 19731 , the viral suspension was shaken for 10 min at 37" with phenol containing 1% SDS. The two phases were separated by centrifugation, and the extraction was repeated. After a suitable marker RNA, 100 pg of carrier RNA, and sodium acetate to 0.15 it4 were added, 2 vol of ethanol were added and all RNAs were allowed to precipitate for 16 hr at -15". The precipitate was collected by centrifuging at 43,200 g for 30 min in an SW 36 rotor and then dissolved in a suitable volume of NET. All RNAs were stored -70" for analysis. (2) In the SDS-lysis (SL) method , SDS was added to 1% (w/v) to a purified virion suspension, and the mixture was held at 23" for 15 min. The RNAs released were mixed with suitable marker RNA and immediately analyzed in preformed sucrose gradients or in polyacrylamide gels. (3) In the phenol-chloroform (PC) method for influenza modified from Pons (1975) by using the ribonuclease inhibitor diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEP) in place of bentonite, the virus sample was mixed with 5% DEP, 0.1 vol2-mercaptoethanol, 1 vol PC extraction buffer, and 1 vol of phenol:chloroform (1:l) and shaken for 3 min at 23". The phases were separated by centrifugation, and the extraction of the aqueous phase was repeated. Precipitation in the presence of marker and carrier RNAs and centrifugation were as described for the WPS method. RNA sucrose gradient analysis.
