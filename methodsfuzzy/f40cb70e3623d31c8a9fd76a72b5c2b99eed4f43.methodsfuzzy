Chen et al. [31] showed by applying mathematical models (the Well-Riley model, competing-risk model and Von Foester equation), that public health interventions (vaccination, insulation, tracing down of the contacts of infected people etc.) are not enough to stop the outbreak of a disease in a modern society. They concluded that more advanced methods need to be applied to help people fight the diseases, namely engineering techniques combined with public health interventions. A great effort has been made to find engineering techniques to keep airborne pathogens away from occupants in buildings, or at levels low enough to be unable to cause a disease: dilution, filtration, Ultra Violet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI), etc. The airborne pathogens might originate from a sick person, from the building itself (infected/polluted HVAC system, infected building materials etc.) or from an intentional release, i.e. a terrorist attack [32, 33] . There is a need for new air distribution systems that reduce to a minimum the airborne route of pathogens in occupied volumes and protect occupants from cross-infection to be developed. One possible solution is personalized ventilation (PV) that provides clean air to the breathing zone of each occupant, and thus improves perceived air quality. Improved thermal comfort, by providing individual control of velocity, temperature and direction of the personalized flow to each occupant, is another benefit of PV. PV may thus increase occupants' satisfaction, decrease SBS symptoms, and increase work performance [78] . When properly applied, PV has greater potential than total volume air distribution to protect occupants from airborne pathogens. Research in this area started only recently but there is already evidence that PV in conjunction with mixing ventilation can protect occupants from airborne pathogens and is superior to mixing air distribution alone [79] . Cermak and Melikov [79] applied the model for prediction of the risk of airborne transmission of diseases suggested by Rudnick and Milton [80] to compare the performance of mixing ventilation, underfloor ventilation and personalized ventilation in conjunction with background mixing ventilation. An air terminal device installed on a movable arm and supplying clean air to the face from in front was used. The comparison was based on the reproductive number calculated for influenza in case of a quantum generation rate of 100 quanta per hour. The reproductive number represents the number of secondary infections that arise when a single infectious case is introduced into a population where everyone is susceptible. The calculation was made when one of 30 persons occupying the same room for eight hours was infected. The results are shown in Fig. 1 and indicate that in the case of mixing ventilation and a supply rate of 10 l/s per person, it is likely that 7 out of 30 occupants will contract influenza in the course of one working day. The number of possibly infected persons decreases to just two (one already infected and one secondarily infected) if either the ventilation rate is increased to 40 l/s per person or an underfloor system (UFAD) with a short throw is employed. The use of PV is shown to reduce the risk of any cross-infection to a very low level. Apart from protecting occupants, PV may also facilitate the transport of exhaled pathogens, in the case where the host individual uses PV while the other occupants do not use any PV for protection. In rooms with displacement ventilation, PV promotes mixing of the exhaled air with room air [81, 84] . This is also true for rooms with underfloor ventilation [79, [82] [83] [84] . There is therefore a risk of transmission of airborne infections to occupants who are not protected by high efficiency PV, e.g. occupants who are not at their work places. PV has been reported to improve the perceived air quality as well as to protect the user from cross-infection when applied with downward ventilation in rooms with textile air terminals [85] . Most existing PV designs are for desk mounted air supply devices. Bolashikov et al. [86] reported on an air terminal device (named Round Movable Arm, RMP) for installation on a desk, providing nearly 100% clean air for inhalation. A solution that incorporates the PV air supply diffusers into the headrest of the user's chair has recently been proposed [87] . In this case, over 90% of the inhaled air was clean air at PV flow rates above 8 l/s per person. The performance of this system was found to be dependent on the position of the head relative to the diffusers, the angle of the diffusers themselves, the clothing insulation of the occupant, the thermal insulation of the seat and the ambient air temperature. Niu et al. [88] studied a ventilated seat with an adjustable personalized air supply nozzle. Eight different nozzles were studied in terms of their effectiveness in reducing exposure to pollutants and personalized air utilization efficiency (the proportion of actual personalized air in inhaled air to the total supplied personalized air). The best nozzle managed to achieve 80% of clean PV air in the air inhaled. Human subject tests were also performed. People found the air quality better, but at high flow rates (1.6 l/s) they felt draught. Nielsen et al. [89] proposed a low velocity personalized ventilation system (LVPV) discharging supply air at very low velocities (laminar flow) and relying on the entrainment of this clean PV air from the natural convection flow around the human body. Their designs were for a person seated in a chair and included a neck support pillow and a complete seat cover (placed on the seat and backrest of the chair, with the whole surface being the air outlet) and a seat cover which was partially open in areas along the two sides of the seat. The effectiveness of the pillow reached 94% of clean air in the air inhaled and 80% for the seat cover, in both cases for flow rates above 14 l/s. Among other factors, the performance PV systems installed in desks and chairs depends on their users' activity, body posture and movement. Such designs protect occupants from airborne transmission of infectious agents only when the user is seated at the desk. This narrows their usefulness. Bolashikov et al. [86] used a headset to supply clean air just in front of the mouth and the nose, in order to overcome the disadvantages described above. They achieved up to 80% clean air in inhalation. The close proximity of the Headset supply orifice to the breathing zone makes it applicable in places where there is high occupation density and hence an elevated risk of airborne infection (theaters, cinemas, airplanes etc.). Low velocity personalized ventilation, based on a ventilated pillow and a ventilated blanket for application in the hospital environment as a way of limiting cross-infection, was studied and reported by Nielsen et al. [90] . The performance of these devices was studied in regard to the patient and not the health care workers or visitors. The efficiency of both devices was found to be dependent on the position of the patient: lying on one side or on the back. The highest efficiency was achieved for a patient lying on his side: almost 95% of the inhaled air was clean PV air. When lying on the back less clean air was able to reach the breathing zone of the Fig. 1 . Reproductive number for influenza, for different ventilation systems and outdoor air supply rates. The normalized concentration was 1, 0.2, and 0.05 in the cases shown from left to right [77] . patient. This was due to the low supply velocities: the entrainment rate of the clean PV air by the natural convection flow was low and it was pushed aside before reaching the nose/mouth. The positive feature of the advanced air distribution methods discussed above is their feasibility and the relatively small flow rates used, as well as their close proximity to the occupant. A HEPA filter or UVGI unit can be included in PV systems that use room air to ensure that each occupant receives air that is clean and free from pathogens. This would further improve the efficiency of the PV system. However field studies are required to evaluate the magnitude of this improvement.
