Independent variables determined to have a potential correlation with disease levels were selected and utilized in the development of a preliminary statistical model. Spatial regression analysis was performed in R to assess the validity of the independent variables as predictors of the corresponding dependent variables. First, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was performed to determine whether the collected independent variables were significantly related to the diseases studied. Independent variables were introduced into the OLS model based upon the prior exploratory data analysis; those with the highest correlations with disease levels were interpreted as the most likely predictors and were incorporated first, followed by the next highest correlation, and so on. The regression model was run each time a new variable was introduced. Those that did not exhibit a relationship with 85% confidence (i.e. p-value not < 0.15) were omitted from further consideration. This conservative level of confidence has been employed in prior studies performing spatial regression of environmental data [33] . Predictor variable collinearity was assessed using the calculation of variance inflation factor (VIF) scores; it was ensured that no predictor variable had a VIF score > 3.0 [34] . This analysis provided an initial model with which to assess the relationships between variables. However, OLS regression does not account for spatial autocorrelation in the data, and other regression models that do account for this may be appropriate [33] . The degree of spatial autocorrelation was assessed in R and quantified with Moran's I and Lagrange multiplier diagnostics using k-nearest neighborhoods of different sizes. It was found that values of k > 1 provided appropriate results; a value of k = 5 was utilized in diagnostic tests to adequately account for spatial autocorrelation. These diagnostic tests found the existence of spatial autocorrelation in this dataset, and determined that a spatial lag model would be more appropriate. The spatial lag regression model was therefore performed in R to adjust the regression coefficients of the selected predictor variables. Akaike information criterion (AIC) values for each of the models were calculated to determine which model was of higher quality.
