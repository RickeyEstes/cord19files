All references published in the printed version of Annals of Emergency Medicine from January through December 2000 December , 2003 December , and 2005 were included in our study. We excluded references within advertisements or supplemental publications. We grouped each reference into one of 8 categories: medical/ scientific journals, books and book chapters, government documents, presentations and announcements, newsletters and newspapers, databases and software, pamphlets and package inserts, and Internet references. The Internet reference category comprised our main study group. Throughout a 2-month period (August to September 2006), we attempted to access all Internet references cited in Annals of Emergency Medicine during our study years. In a post hoc analysis, we classified the Internet references into 11 categories (Table 1) . To better interpret the data, we then organized the 11 categories in 2 main groups. The first group consisted of Internet references that were readily accessible and contained information that the author intended to cite. The second group consisted of Internet references that failed to contain readily accessible information that the author intended to cite. We entered all the Internet references into a spreadsheet and checked the spelling of each uniform resource locator (URL) against the original published Internet reference at the time of data entry and again if the Internet reference was placed in the "no site found" category. The spreadsheet was linked to an Internet browser (Firefox, version 1.5.0.1; Mozilla Foundation, Mountain View, CA), and double-clicking on each URL directly from the spreadsheet accessed the URLs. These spreadsheets can be found in Appendix E1, available online at http://www.annemergmed.com. We were concerned that the dynamic nature of the Internet would give the "no site found" message or "temporarily unavailable" message erroneously. To avoid misclassification when these messages appeared, we retried each site at least 24 hours after the failed attempt. We frequently encountered a situation in which the URL would access a generic home page. The authors' intended information would be related to the content on the home page, but the specific topic cited by the author could not be identified by scrolling through the Web site. For example, a URL that links to the New York Times Web site will be active, but the information the authors intended to cite will no longer be on the home page. Because the main purpose of the study was to evaluate the accessibility of referenced information on the Internet, we thought that classifying these URLs as active sites
