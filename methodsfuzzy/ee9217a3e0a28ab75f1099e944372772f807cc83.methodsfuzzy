Glial cell cultures . All cultures were derived from C57BL/6 mice obtained from Jackson Laboratories (designated 'MHV-free') . Mixed glial cell cultures were derived from 3 week old mice by mincing and trypsinization of brains followed by filtration through nylon mesh and plating onto tissue culture flasks . Oligodendrocytes were purified from these brains by Percoll gradient centrifugation ." Alternatively, mixed glial cultures were derived from newborm mice and after 2 weeks in culture were subcultured into enriched astrocytes and enriched oligodendrocyte cultures by the procedure of McCarthy and DeVellis 10 designed for rat glial cells as modified for use with mouse cells ." Briefly, this involves shaking off of the less adherent oligodendrocytes and replating of these cells onto poly-L-lysine coated cover slips (at a concentration of approximately 5x 10 4 cells per cm 2 ) while the astrocytes remain adherent to the tissue culture plastic . In both cases infections were performed on cells at 3-4 weeks of development . In both cases, cultures were similar in terms of percentage of cells containing viral antigen and amount of infectious virus produced . Because the cells were difficult to obtain routinely from the older mice, most of the experiments were performed on cultures derived from the newborn mice . All cells were grown in Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO 2 . The purity of the cultures was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Cells were stained either with antiserum directed against galactocerebroside (GaIC), an oligodendrocyte specific marker, 14 or antiserum against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocyte specific marker, 13 followed by a secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescein or rhodamine . As defined by staining with these antisera 3 days after plating, oligodendrocyte enriched cultures consisted of more than 80% oligodendrocytes whereas astrocyte enriched cultures consisted of more than 90% astrocytes ." Infection of cultures with MHV-A59. Plaque purified MHV-A59 grown in 17CI-1 cells was used in all infections . 3 17Cl-1 cells were infected at MOI=1 TCID 50 /cell and glial cultures were infected 1-3 days after plating with MOIs as indicated . At the time of infection 17Cl-1, mixed glial and astrocyte cultures contained approximately 1 .5x105 cells per cm 2 . Enriched oligodendrocytes contained approximately 5x 10 4 cells per cm 2 . After adsorption for 1 hour at room temperature cultures were washed with phosphate buffered saline three times and fed with warm media . At the indicated intervals post infection, supernatants were collected (replaced with fresh media) and tested for infectious virus by a TCID S°a ssay in 17CI-1 or L-2 mouse fibroblasts (as indicated) as previously described ." Titers were approximately the same in both cell types . Infection in mice . Five day old C57BL/6 mice were infected intracerebrally with 400 TCID 50 of MHV-A59 . One day later brains were removed and mixed glial cultures derived by the techniques of McCarthy and DeVellis16 as described above . Antigen dection by immunofluorescence . Cultures were stained by immunofluorescence . When staining for oligodendrocytes expressing viral antigens, cells were washed and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-galactocerebroside serum (1 :100 dilution) and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody, then fixed with a acetic acid/ethanol and incubated with mouse polyclonal anti-MHV-A59 (1 : 100 dilution) and fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody ." When staining for astrocytes expressing viral antigens cells were fixed, stained with rabbit polyclonal, anti glial fibrillary acidic protein serum (1 :150) and rhodomine-conjugated secondary antibody and then stained for viral antigens as above . Cells were then viewed with phase contrast, rhodamine, and ultraviolet fluorescence optics .
