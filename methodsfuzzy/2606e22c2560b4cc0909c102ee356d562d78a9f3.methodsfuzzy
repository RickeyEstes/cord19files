Escherichia coli strain DH5a was used to amplify plasmids, and E.coli transformations were performed using the high efficiency method of Inoue et al. (33) . YPAD and synthetic complete medium (H À ) were used as described previously (34) . Isogenic ResGen yeast strains (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) derived from BY4742 (JD1158: MATa his3D1 leu2D0 lys2D0 ura3D0 and JD1181: MATa upf3::Kan R his3D1 leu2D0 lys2D0 ura3D0) were used for in vivo measurement of programmed À1 ribosomal frameshifting. All yeast cells were transformed using the alkali cation method (35) . Dual luciferase plasmids pJD375 and pJD376 have been described previously (36) . Computationally identified putative À1 PRF signals derived from BUB3, CTS2, EST2, FKS1, FLR1, NUP82, PPR1, SPR6 and TBF1 were designed with the appropriate restriction sites on the 5 0 and 3 0 ends (Supplementary Table 1) . Furthermore, naturally occurring termination codons were eliminated from the À1 reading frame by shortening the spacer region between slippery site and the putative downstream stimulatory structure by a 1 nt. PAGE purified oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technology, Coralville, IA) corresponding to each À1 PRF signal were annealed and gel purified. pJD375, the 'zero-frame' control dualluciferase frameshift reporter (DLR) plasmid, was used as a vector backbone and each putative PRF signal was cloned into unique SalI and BamHI restriction sites located in the multiple cloning site (MCS) between the Renilla and firefly luciferase orfs. The resulting new PRF-reporter vectors were verified by DNA sequencing (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea). In vivo Dual-Luciferase Ò Reporter Assays (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) for programmed À1 ribosomal frameshifting were performed as described previously in yeast strain JD1158 (36) . Luminescence readings were obtained using a Turner Designs TD20/20Ô Luminometer (Sunnyvale, CA). A minimum of 12 replicate assays were carried out for each candidate À1 PRF signal. Statistical analyses of each luciferase dataset followed an established protocol aimed at identifying outliers, validating the statistical assumptions of sample size and distribution, and for the accurate comparison of multiple bicistronic reporter assays (37) .
