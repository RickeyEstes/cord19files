A total of 169 clinical samples were used to detect CSFV by viral isolation, RT-PCR, RT-nPCR, and RT-MRT-PCR. These samples included 39 samples collected from SPF pigs, 86 samples from CSFV outbreak farms, and 44 samples from local animal disease control centers. The agreement among tests was based on kappa statistics (Thrusfield, 1995) . The agreement was classified by kappa statistic values into five groups: almost perfect (0.81 or higher), substantial (0.61-0.8), moderate (0.41-0.6), fair (0.21-0.4), slight (0.01-0.2), and poor (0). Agreement of viral isolation, RT-PCR, RT-nPCR, and RT-MRT-PCR, 101 of 169 total clinical samples were detected as CSFV-positive, and 68 of these samples were CSFV-negative by viral isolation. All 101 CSFV-positive samples detected by viral isolation were also shown to be CSFV-positive by RT-MRT-PCR, RT-PCR, and RT-nPCR. Among CSFV strains were 10-fold serially diluted and CSFV was detected from viral isolation, RT-PCR, RT-nPCR, and RT-MRT-PCR. The TCID50 of CSFV strains was calculated from result of viral isolation.
