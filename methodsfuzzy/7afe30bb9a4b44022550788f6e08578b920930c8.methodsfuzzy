The two strains viz. 3D7, the CQ-susceptible strain (isolated in West Africa; obtained from MR4, VA, USA), and W2 (isolated in Indochina; obtained from MR4, VA, USA), the CQ-resistant strain, were maintained in culture in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom), supplemented with 10% human serum (Abcys S.A. Paris, France) and buffered with 25 mM HEPES and 25 mM NaHCO 3 . Parasites were grown in A-positive human blood (Etablissement Français du Sang, Marseille, France) under controlled atmospheric conditions that consisted of 10% O 2 , 5% CO 2 and 85% N 2 at 37 C with a humidity of 95%. The two strains were synchronized twice with sorbitol before use [35] , and clonality was verified every 15 days through PCR genotyping of the polymorphic genetic markers msp1 and msp2 and microsatellite loci [36, 37] ; additionally, clonality was verified each year by an independent laboratory from the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN). Chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) was purchased from Sigma (Saint Louis, MO). CQ was resuspended in water in concentrations ranging between 5 and 3200 nM. The synthetic compounds were resuspended in DMSO and then diluted in RPMI-DMSO (99v/1v) to obtain final concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 100 mM. For in vitro isotopic microtests, 25 mL/well of antimalarial drug and 200 mL/well of the parasitized red blood cell suspension (final parasitemia, 0.5%; final hematocrit, 1.5%) were distributed into 96 well plates. Parasite growth was assessed by adding 1 mCi of tritiated hypoxanthine with a specific activity of 14.1 Ci/mmol (Per-kineElmer, Courtaboeuf, France) to each well at time zero. The plates were then incubated for 48 h in controlled atmospheric conditions. Immediately after incubation, the plates were frozen and thawed to lyse erythrocytes. The contents of each well were collected on standard filter microplates (Unifilter GF/B; Per-kineElmer) and washed using a cell harvester (Filter-Mate Cell Harvester; PerkineElmer). Filter microplates were dried, and 25 mL of scintillation cocktail (Microscint O; PerkineElmer) was placed in each well. Radioactivity incorporated by the parasites was measured with a scintillation counter (Top Count; PerkineElmer) . The IC 50 , the drug concentration able to inhibit 50% of parasite growth, was assessed by identifying the drug concentration corresponding to 50% of the uptake of tritiated hypoxanthine by the parasite in the drug-free control wells. The IC 50 value was determined by non-linear regression analysis of log-based doseeresponse curves (Riasmart™, Packard, Meriden, USA). IC 50 are expressed as geometric means of 5 experiments.
