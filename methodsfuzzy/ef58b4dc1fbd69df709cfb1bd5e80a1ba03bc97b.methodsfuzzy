Sampling. 270 nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected patients that show respiratory clinical signs were collected during October to December 2015 (9) . Samples were collected from three hospitals in Tehran city (Besat, Golestan, and Imam REZA). The patients suffered from respiratory syndrome such as coughing, gasping, and excessive lacrimation. The range of age was between 12-75 years old. In addition, the males and females were 65% & 35% of the cases respectively. RNA Extraction. RNA was extracted from swabbed samples using high pure viral RNA kit (Roche Co.,Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. The purity of the extracted RNA was determined by taking the ratio of the readings at 260 and 280 nm. We used negative control during the extraction procedure. cDNA synthesis. For cDNA synthesis, 1 µL (0.2 ug) of random hexamer primer (SinaClon, Iran) was added to 5 µL of extracted RNA and the mixture was heated at 65°C for 5 minutes. Fourteen µL of cDNA master mix containing 7.25 µL DEPC-treated water (SinaClon, Iran), 2 µL dNTP mix (SinaClon, Iran), 0.25 µL RiboLock RNase Inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) , 0.5 µL Revert Aid Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific , USA), and 4 µL 5X RT Reaction Buffer was added to each tube, resulting in a final volume of 20 µL. Then, the mixture was incubated at 25°C for 5 min, 42°C for 60 min, 95°C for 5 min, and 4°C for 1 min, respectively. The cDNA was stored at −20°C until use (10) . SYBR green Real-Time PCR. cDNA was amplified by a real-time PCR using Real Q PCR 2 x master mix (Ampliqon), in the Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagene, USA). The primers sequences are available in Table  1 . Each reaction had a total volume of 25 µL, including 12.5 µL SYBR Green master mix, 200 nmol of each forward and reverse primers, 5 µL cDNA plus 7.1 µL ddH2O. The cycling conditions included an initial denaturation step of 10 minutes at 94°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95°C, one minute at 55°C and one minute at 60°C. Fluorescent detection was at the end of each cycle. Melting curve analysis program was used for identification of specific PCR products. After the last cycle, the temperature was increased to 94°C, then decreased to 75°C and slowly increased to 94°C at a rate of 0.1°C per second, with continuous fluorescence monitoring. Positive and negative controls were added in each set (11) . For final confirmation, the PCR product was analyzed by electrophoresis on 2.5% agarose gel and visualized under UV light.
