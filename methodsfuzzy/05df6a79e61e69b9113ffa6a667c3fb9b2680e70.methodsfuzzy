Cell lines. The EBV-positive BL cell lines Akata and Mutu-I, and the EBV-negative BL cell lines Akata 31, BJAB and Ramos were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, streptomycin (100 mg/ml), penicillin (100 U/ml) and L-glutamine (2 mM). EBV-positive BL Akata cells expressing a dominant-negative MyD88 (DN-MyD88 Akata) 16 were grown in the same medium supplemented with 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Primary BL tissue samples and peripheral blood from healthy individuals. BLs were retrieved from the database of the Institute of Surgical Pathology, University Hospital of Zurich (PathoPro Software, Institute of Medical Software, Saarbrücken, Germany). The BL diagnosis was performed according to the WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. 37 DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded whole-tissue sections, according to standard procedures. This study was in accordance with Swiss laws and approved by the official authorities of the ethical committee of the Canton of Zurich (StV2-2007). Peripheral blood was collected from 402 healthy blood donors (aged 19-70 years) who were randomly selected according to the criteria of the Swiss Red Cross. 38 Single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis. Whole-genomic DNA was extracted with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genotyping of the TLR9 polymorphisms -1237 T/C (rs5743836) and 2848 G/A (rs352140) was done by tetra-primer assays as previously described. 39 Treatment with TLR9 agonists. Cells were split to a density of 0.5 Â Microarray analysis. Akata cells were mock treated or treated with CpG-2006, and harvested 6 h later. Total RNA was isolated with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microarray analysis was performed at the Functional Genomic Center Zurich (University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland). Human Exon 1.0 ST Array chips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Genespring GX software (Agilent Technologies, Basel, Switzerland) were used for the analysis. An at least twofold change in gene expression (upregulation or downregulation) in the treated versus the mock-treated sample was regarded as significant. qRT-PCR (Taqman). Total RNA was extracted from 10 6 cells with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and DNA was removed with DNA-free (Ambion Europe, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, UK). 1 mg of the purified RNA was used to generate cDNA with the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems,
