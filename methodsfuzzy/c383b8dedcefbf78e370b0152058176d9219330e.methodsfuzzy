Experimental TCRV infection in bats, sample collection, and RNA extraction. Experimental infections of Jamaican fruit bats were previously reported (22) . Briefly, two Jamaican fruit bats were inoculated with 100 l of sterile Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) as negative controls (bat IDs 688 and 689), and two bats were inoculated with 100 l containing 10 6 TCID 50 TCRV (bat IDs 714 and 729). Negative control bats were euthanized at the end of the experimental period (45 days), whereas TCRV-infected bats were euthanized as they became moribund (days 11 and 18, respectively). Necropsies were performed directly following euthanasia, and organs were harvested and collected in RNAlater stabilization reagent (Qiagen). RNA was extracted from flash-frozen tissues by homogenization with a Mini Bead Beater (BioSpec Products, Inc.), using QiaShredder columns with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA-Seq. Stranded Illumina libraries for each tissue were prepared from total RNA using the NEB Ultra Directional RNA library prep kit with poly(A) selection. Sequencing (paired-end 100 bp) was performed on the Illumina HiSeq-2000 platform at the UC Denver Genomics core. Read processing and assembly. For transcriptome assembly, raw reads were filtered for adapter sequences and low-quality reads, and assembly was performed using Trinity (30) with the following parameters: -min_contig_length 300 -min_glue 3-min_kmer_cov 2. Resulting contigs were processed for read alignment and abundance estimation with Bowtie and RSEM (75, 76) . Differential expression was performed using the edgeR package within the Trinity differential analysis pipeline using default parameters (77) . A pairwise comparison was made between TCRV-infected samples and control uninfected samples. Genes were considered differentially expressed with an FDR of Ͻ0.01 and a log 2 fold change of Ͼ2. The complete list of annotated differentially regulated genes in each organ can be found in Data Set S3. Gene ontology and pathway analysis. BLAST alignments and functional annotations were performed using Blast2GO Pro or Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (78, 79) . Specific parameters can be found in Data Set S5 in the supplemental material, and the resulting outputs are summarized in Data S4. Direct pathway analysis for immune-related genes was performed using the gene list from the ImmPort database (31) . Immunoglobulin sequence analysis. Contigs for immunoglobulins were translated using the default translation table of MacVector software. MUSCLE alignments were made to identify leader, framework regions, and complementarity-determining regions of the V segments using a black flying fox sequence as a reference (NCBI GenBank accession no. ADD71702.1) (50) . Heavy chains and hinge regions were identified by BLAST against other Chiroptera. RT-qPCR validation of RNA-Seq data. The experimental primer sequences used in RT-qPCR analysis are listed in Fig. S2 . cDNA was generated using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific) and SYBR Select master mix for CFX (Applied Biosystems). The same two Jamaican fruit bats that were used for uninfected samples in RNA-Seq were also used as uninfected samples for RT-qPCR. Accession number(s). Raw reads have been deposited into GenBank under GenBank accession no. GSE75771.
