For many experimental studies, and also colony management, it is important to know about the reproductive status of the females. Monitoring can be performed using invasive and non-invasive methods. Hormone measurements in blood, urine or faeces are indirect methods since hormone values reflect the function of the reproductive organs. Ultrasonography provides direct results through an immediate view of the ovaries and uterus (Tarantal and Hendrickx, 1988) . To determine the time of ovulation, all sample collection for hormone analysis, needs to be performed at least twice, but preferably three times, a week.
