Epidemiological data. To conduct our analysis, we collected epidemiological data from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and System website (6). Incidence data were collected from various sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO); U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention the Chinese National Health Center (NHC) as well as DXY, a Chinese website that aggregates NHC and local CCDC situation reports in near real-time. Daily cumulative confirmed incidence data were collected for each province in China from January 23, 2020 (i.e., the closure of Wuhan) to February 10, 2020. For comparison, we also obtained epidemiological data for affected countries including Thailand, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea, as well as other regions in China with important differences in data collection, 2 All rights reserved.

Estimation of a proxy for the reproductive number. Based on the cumulative incidence data for each province, we estimated a proxy for the reproductive number R in a collection of 5, 6 and 7-day intervals (7) . R is a measure of potential disease transmissibility defined as the average number of people a case infects before it recovers or dies. Our proxy for R, designated as R proxy , is a constant that maps cases occurring from time (t) to time (t + d) onto cases reported from time (t + d) to time (t + 2d); where d is an approximation of the serial interval (i.e., the number of days between successive cases in a chain of disease transmission). For multiple time points, t, we obtained values of R proxy (t, d) given by : where the values of d range from [5 to 7] , consistent with reported estimates of serial intervals (7). Our measure is considered only a proxy for R because it does not use details of the (so far poorly defined) serial interval distribution, but instead, simply calculates the multiplicative increase in the number of incident cases over approximately one serial interval. Such proxies are at least approximately monotonically related to the true reproductive number and cross 1 when the true reproductive number crosses 1 (8) . After computing these proxy values over a variety of subsequent moving time windows, a mean value was obtained and utilized as our estimated reproductive number R for each province. To minimize potential inclusion of imported cases in our analysis, R estimates were calculated after the closure of Wuhan on January 23rd, 2020. Weather data. We obtained monthly values of temperature and relative humidity data in January 2020 for each provincial capital in China from World Weather Online (9) . We assumed that the majority of disease incidence for each province would occur or be reported in or near the capital due to increased population density in these metropolitan areas. We then calculated the "absolute humidity" from these two variables for each province using the following formula, which is an approximation of the Clausius Clapeyron equation (  where AH is the absolute humidity, T is the temperature in degrees Celsius, RH is the relative humidity in percent (0-100), and e is the base of the natural log. Relationship between local exponential growth and environmental factors. We used two different interpolation approaches, a Loess regression and an exponential fit, to visually identify the relationship between absolute humidity and our proxy for the reproductive number (an indicator of the observed exponential growth rate) for each location. In order to identify the sta- Table 1 : Relationship between local exponential growth, log(R proxy ), and environmental factors (i.e., absolute humidity and temperature). tistical relevance of the relationship between the local reproductive number of COVID-19 cases and environmental factors, we fitted a linear model using the logarithm of the local reproductive number R proxy as our response variable. Absolute humidity and temperature were included as independent variables.
