The information provided by GWAS-based studies is not focused on the directed response to an infection but on the information already stored within the host's genome. On the other hand, transcriptomic approaches identifies the interactions between the pathogen and the host's genome by evaluating transcript levels, typically mRNAs. The most commonly used transcriptomic methods are RNA-seq [69, 70] and microarrays [65, 66] . RNA-seq is generally suitable for unbiased transcriptomic profiling and provides better understanding of global transcriptomic changes. This agnostic method is appropriate for identifying changes in the human transcriptome as a result of an emerging viral infection to show specific mechanisms of immune response evasion and other effects in the host's biology at the transcriptomic level. Conversely, targeted-approaches depend on previous knowledge of host-transcriptomics. Studies with human cohorts and animal models have developed gene signatures that discriminate between viral and bacterial respiratory infections [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] . Other groups have developed sepsis classifiers to guide treatment options in clinical settings [71, 72] . A goal of developing these disease classifiers is to use them to predict disease outcome prior to the onset of symptoms and to assist in decision making when a symptomatic disease with an unknown etiology is suspected. Effective and accurate discernment between a viral and a bacterial infection can make the difference in administering the appropriate therapeutics and potentially saving lives. When a specific viral species can't be identified, a gene classifier may be useful to determine potential disease outcomes such as lethality.
