A ssDNA fragment (3 -CACGAACGTGACGAAT-FITC-5 ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus was designed as a sample [e.g. target ssDNA(II)] and a trace amount of the sample was recovered from the solution using this method. The 4.1 M biotin-labeled capture ssDNA(II) (5biotin-AAAAAAAAAAGTGCTTGCACTGCTTA-3 ) was first modified onto the nanoparticles as mentioned above. The target ssDNA(II) was then added to the capture ssDNA(II)modified nanoparticles suspension until the concentration was 6.5 nmol/l. The mixture was incubated in 50 • C water bath for 30 min. Then the magnetic DNA bio-conjugate was separated from the supernatant under the magnet field. The recovery efficiency was determined by fluorescent measurement of target ssDNA(II) solution before and after hybridization. The selectivity of this method has also been investigated by comparing the separation efficiency of target ssDNA(II) with mismatched ssDNA(II) [one base mismatch ssDNA, three bases mismatch ssDNA and random ssDNA]. Recov- ery efficiency of this method for target ssDNA(II) was shown in Fig. 6 . By using capture ssDNA(II), the recovery efficiency for 6.5 nmol/l target ssDNA(II) is 68.17 ± 3.29%, for one base mismatch ssDNA is 31.53 ± 2.57%, for three bases mismatch ssDNA is 15.33 ± 3.24%. The recovery efficiency for random ssDNA is very low. The above results demonstrated the recovery of target ssDNA at trace concentrations. Good selectivity was confirmed by comparing the recovery efficiency of target ssDNA with the mismatched ssDNA.
