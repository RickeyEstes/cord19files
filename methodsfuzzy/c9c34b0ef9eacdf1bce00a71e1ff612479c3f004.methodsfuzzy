Rickettsiae and mice. For in vitro infection, R. australis (Cutlack strain) was cultivated in Vero cells and purified by either Renografin density gradient centrifugation or the use of a Renografin cushion, as previously described (35, 63, 64) . For mouse inoculation, R. australis was propagated in the yolk sacs of specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs as described previously (30) . The concentrations of stock rickettsiae cultured in both yolk sacs and cell cultures were determined by plaque assay, as described in previous studies (30) . The rickettsial stock was stored at Ϫ80°C until used, and all the experiments described in this study were performed in a certified biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory at UTMB. WT B6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (catalog number 000664). Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre and Atg5 flox/flox (control) mice were kindly provided by Noboru Mizushima at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University in Japan and Herbert Virgin IV at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, MO (33, 41) . For in vivo experiments, Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre and Atg5 flox/flox mice were inoculated i.v. through the tail vein with R. australis at a dose of 3 ϫ 10 5 PFU per mouse, which is a sublethal dose for WT B6 mice. Uninfected mice served as negative controls. After infection, the mice were monitored daily for signs of illness. On day 4 p.i., the mice were euthanized. Mouse tissues, including lung, liver, and spleen tissues, were collected for measurement of bacterial replication and histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. All mice were maintained and manipulated in an animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL3) facility at UTMB. All experiments and procedures were approved by the UTMB Animal Care and Use Committee, and experiments in mice were performed according to the guidelines of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (65) . Generation of bone marrow-derived macrophages. The generation of primary BMMs from 6-to 8-week-old female WT B6 mice, Atg5 flox/flox mice, and Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice was performed as previously described (66) . Briefly, after the femurs and tibias were dissected, the bone marrow was flushed and cells were cultivated in low-endotoxin Dulbecco modified Eagle medium containing 10% (vol/vol) newborn calf serum (catalog number 16010142; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with either 20% supernatant from an L929 cell culture or a CMG14-12 cell culture or recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor (catalog number 315-02; PeproTech) at 37°C in 5% CO 2 (67). On day 6 of culture, cells were harvested and characterized by flow cytometric analysis after staining with anti-F4/80 and CD11b Abs (catalog numbers 565410 and 553310; BD Bioscience). Approximately 90% of these cells were F4/80 ϩ and CD11b ϩ . These cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 1 ϫ 10 6 cells/well and used for the experiments within 24 h. In vitro infections of macrophages. BMMs were infected with R. australis at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2:1 or 5:1 as indicated below and in the figure legends. To synchronize bacterial internalization, rickettsiae were centrifuged onto the cells at 560 ϫ g for 5 min. Cells were continuously incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . At 1 h, 3 h, and 24 h p.i., cells were collected and washed for further experiments. Uninfected macrophages served as negative controls. Cells treated with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; catalog number 14170112; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 4 h served as the positive controls of autophagy induction. Immunofluorescence microscopy. For immunofluorescence detection of LC3 puncta and localization of LC3 and rickettsiae, cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 12-well plates 1 day before infection. At the time points indicated below, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X in PBS for 20 min, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Samples were incubated with rabbit polyclonal Abs directed against R. australis and goat anti-mouse LC3 (catalog number sc-16755; Santa Cruz), followed by appropriate secondary Abs, including Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated chicken anti-goat IgG and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (catalog numbers A21467 and A31573; Life Technologies). The anti-LC3 Ab preferentially labels autophagosome-associated LC3-II. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) in ProLong Gold antifade mountant (catalog number P-36931; Life Technology). Coverslips were sealed with nail polish and visualized by confocal microscopy (Olympus Fluoview 1000 microscope) using FV10-ASW software (Olympus). The percentage of cells containing LC3-positive (LC3 ϩ ) puncta and the percentage of rickettsiae colocalized with LC3 ϩ puncta in more than 300 cells or 300 bacteria from at least 12 randomly selected images were calculated using MetaMorph software and/or ImageJ software as previously described (68, 69) . Transmission electron microscopy. For examination of infected BMMs by electron microscopy, BMMs were harvested at the time points p.i. indicated above and immersed in Ito's fixative (2.5% formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 0.03% CaCl 2 , and 0.03% trinitrophenol in 0.05 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3) at room temperature for 1 h and then overnight at 4°C. After washing, samples were processed further as described previously (45) . Ultrathin sections were cut on a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Inc.) and examined in a Phillips 201 transmission electron microscope (Phillips Electron Optics) at 60 kV. Western immunoblotting. For assessment of the cellular LC3 levels and the conversion of naive LC3-I to lipidated LC3-II, cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (catalog number 20-188; EMD Millipore) supplemented with protease inhibitors (catalog number 05892970001; Roche). The soluble part of the cell lysates was isolated by centrifugation and separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with a rabbit polyclonal Ab directed against LC3B (catalog number 4108; Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an appropriate secondary Ab and enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (catalog number 32106; Thermo Scientific, Pierce). Equal protein loading of the gels was monitored by detecting ␤-actin with mouse monoclonal antibody (catalog number A1978; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in the cell lysates. The detection of p62/SQSTM1 is indicative of the autophagic process, as described previously (70) . SQSTM1-specific immunoblotting was performed as described above using Abs directed against p62/SQSTM1 (catalog number 5114; Cell Signaling Technology). The amounts of LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1 relative to the amount of ACTB and the ratio of LC3-II to p62/SQSTM1 were calculated after densitometry measurements were made using ImageJ software or Image Studio Lite software (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) (71, 72) . Induction of autophagy with rapamycin treatment. For the study of the effect of autophagy on inhibiting or supporting bacterial infection, BMMs were incubated with medium containing rapamycin (catalog number R8781; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at a concentration as low as 50 nM. The culture medium in each well was replaced with fresh medium containing rapamycin. After 4 h, the cells were infected with R. australis at an MOI of 2. At 1/2 h and 48 h p.i., BMMs were washed with PBS to remove extracellular bacteria, and intracellular bacterial replication was monitored using real-time PCR as described below. The activation effect of rapamycin on autophagy was examined by immunoblotting with antibodies against LC3 and p62/SQSTM1. Cell morphology was observed by microscopy, and cell viability was determined with the trypan blue dye exclusion method.
