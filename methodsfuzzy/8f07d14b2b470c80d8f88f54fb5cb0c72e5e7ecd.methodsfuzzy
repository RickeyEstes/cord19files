The mouse thigh infection model described by Craig was employed. Mice were made neutropenic by cyclophosphamide, 150 mg/kg day −4 and 100 mg/kg day −1. P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 was injected into the posterior thighs of mice at a burden of 10 6 CFU. A preliminary study was performed as a dose range of Cefto alone and Levo alone. Sigmoid Emax analysis was employed to identify areas of greatest Fisher Information. As this model has 3 parameters, each preliminary experiment allowed identification of 3 doses most informative as to linking exposure to response. This allowed a second experiment to be performed (16 cohorts): no-treatment control; 3 Cefto alone; 3 Levo alone and 9 combination therapy cohorts (3X3). At 24 h, mice were sacrificed, the posterior thighs dissected, homogenised and plated after serial dilution on plates without drug (estimation of total bacterial load) and on plates containing 3 x baseline MIC of either Cefto or Levo (isolates resistant to one of the drugs). The Greco URSA model was fit to the data using ADAPT II. Weighting was the inverse of the observation variance. Results: For Cefto as a single drug, Emax (cell kill) was 4.1 log (CFU/g) and EC50 was 12.6 mg/kg. For Levo as a single drug, Emax was 6.9 log (CFU/g) and EC50 was 145.4 mg/kg. Combination therapy was statistically significantly synergistic (a -interaction parameter 5.13; 95%CI 0.644−9.62). The cell kill is demonstrated in the Figure. Perhaps more importantly, the combination efficiently suppressed resistance emergence to either of the two drugs. Doses of Levo greater than 50 mg/kg, combined with Cefto doses greater than 15 mg/kg generally suppressed all resistant bacteria. Ceftobiprole-levofloxacin combination therapy against P. aeruginosa ATCC27853. The molecular method involves two features: the length of the interspace (IS) region between the 16s and the 23s rDNA and specific primer sequences discriminating Firmicuta and Bacteroidetes, the two major phyla in the human colon. The IS region is conserved within a species, but varies between species. Thus bacteria can in principle be identified by the length of their IS region. Unknown species can be recognised using the specific primer sequences. The primers were combined with non-specific reverse primers in a double label multiplex PCR. Size and colour sorting of fragments was performed in an ABI 3130XL sequencer. For validation purposes an in silico profile of 5 bacteria was constructed based on known sequence information and tested with the cultured bacteria. Then, colonic mucosal biopsies from 20 patients were analysed using this method. Intra-and interpatient composition of colonic microbiota was analysed in 5 biopsies per patient, from coecum, flexura hepatica, flexura lienalis, sigmoid and rectum. Results: All cultured bacteria showed a profile identical to the in silico profile. Subsequently, excellent bacterial profiles were obtained for the clinical samples. Each patient had a unique bacterial profile, with only a few fragments being identical between patients. These fragments corresponded to well known colonic bacteria such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Patterns obtained from the different sites of the colon of a single patient were almost identical. The genome sequences of the PAI-negative strain E1071 and the PAI-positive strain E1162 have been determined in our laboratory (Van Schaik et al., in preparation) . From the genome sequences, regions that were homologous to the flanking sequence of the esp containing PAI in E1162 were identified in E1071 and in another PAI negative strain, E. faecium DO, which has a publicly available genome sequence. This allowed us to identify the PAI integration site. Subsequently, PAI integration and sequence heterogeneity adjoining the integration site was determined using normal and long-range PCR in 17 PAI-positive and 34 PAI-negative strains using combinations of PAI specific primers and primers specific for the flanking genes. Results: DNA alignments between E1162 and DO revealed integration in E1162 of a 61-kb large DNA fragment, containing the esp gene, in the 3 end of an open reading frame with high identical to orf1671 of E. faecium DO. This integration resulted in a 54-bp duplication. At the 5 end of the E1162 PAI a 22-kb region with high similarity (up to 100%) to an E. faecalis mobile element was found, while the 3 -end is homologous to orf13 to orf23 of Tn916. Interestingly, in strain E1071 another 8.3-kb element with no homology to the PAI of E1162 was integrated at the same position. PCR demonstrated that in all 17 PAI-positive isolates the PAI was integrated in the DO orf1671 homolog. In 23/33 PAI-negative strains, PCR confirmed no integration at this site, however, in one isolate PCR indicated integration of a fragment of at least 13-kb. In 9 strains no PCR product using primers spanning the integration site was obtained suggesting either integration of DNA elements too large to amplify or polymorphisms at the primer annealing site. We investigated the presence of HBoV by quantitative PCR of nasopharyngeal samples of 192 French consecutive children hospitalised for acute bronchiolitis. The detection of the other common respiratory viruses was performed using classical immunofluorescence antigens, cell culture detection, or RT-PCR assays. Results: HBoV was the unique viral pathogen detected in 14 (7%) and was associated with another viral respiratory pathogen in 10 (5%) of 192 study children. This virus was identified as the third aetiological cause of bronchiolitis after respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus (45 (23%) and 24 (12%) of 192 cases, respectively), occurring more often in infants aged 1−12 months (P = 0.002). The median levels of the HBoV DNA genomes in respiratory samples appeared to be significantly higher in patients with single HBoV infection than those observed in patients with a mixed respiratory viral infection with HBoV (4.10 8 copies/ml vs. 2.10 3 copies/ml, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Our data suggest that HBoV at a high viral load could be an aetiologic agent of respiratory tract disease, whereas the exact role of HBoV at a low viral load, as aetiological cause or as pathophysiological co-factor of respiratory diseases, remains to be determined. We constructed by insertion-duplication mutagenesis a specific AcrB mutant, designed as 52DB, from the K. pneumoniae virulent strain 52145. Characterisation of the mutant was performed by Southern blot analysis, RT-PCR analysis of AcrB expression, and determination of the MIC of several antimicrobial agents. To investigate the virulence of the AcrB-deficient mutant, standard survival assays were performed incubating the bacterial cells with human bronchoalveolar lavage, polymyxin B or human beta-defensin. Virulence was also tested in a murine model of pneumonia. Results: Southern blot and RT-PCR analysis confirmed the interruption of the AcrB gene and the abolishment of the expression of AcrB in 52DB. The mutant was more susceptible to cefoxitin, erythromycin, and nalidixic acid than the parent strain. MICs (mg/l) of antibiotics for strain 52145 and its 52DB mutant were respectively; 8 and 1 (cefoxitin), 64 and 1 (erythromycin), and 4 and 0.5 (nalidixic acid). The mutant 52DB exhibited a significant reduction of more than threefolds in its capacity to survive in the presence of bronchoalveolar lavage, polymixin or human beta-defensin compared with the parent strain. Furthermore, the mutant was less virulent than the parent strain in a murine model of pneumonia and Balb/C mice were i.v. infected with inocula of 10 7 to 10 8 (five to ten female per isolate). agr dysfunction (that may enhance adhesion) and virulence factors such as the capsular type (CP) and the toxin gene profile were screened in all isolates to interpret the results. Results: In comparison to the MSSA group, a higher adhesion (mean of 69.1±10.9 versus 42.2±3.7 adherent bacteria per cell, P < 0.001; Figure, panel A) and a higher virulence in the mouse sepsis model (P = 0.072 with C57BL/6 and P = 0.01 with Balb/c) was observed for the MRSA ST8 group (Figure, panel B) . The MRSA ST5 group was significantly less adhesive to HAECs (mean of 12.1±3.3, P < 0.001; Figure, panel A), but induced a high mortality (79% at day nine; Figure, panel B) in the sepsis model in comparison with MSSA (P < 0.001). We observed heterogeneity in the results obtained with the MRSA ST8 group both in the adhesion and in the sepsis model, with three MRSA ST8 isolates not being lethal at all. The higher adhesion of MRSA ST8 isolates did not correlate with agr dysfunction. Virulence of MRSA ST8 and ST5 isolates may be due, at least in part, to the combination of expression of CP5 and production of superantigenic toxins. Indeed, all MRSA isolates: (i) expressed CP5, contrary to four MSSA, only; (ii) harbored genes encoding SEA (MRSA ST8) or TSST-1 (MRSA ST5) whereas none of the MSSA isolates were positive for these genes. The secretion of gliotoxin after fungal growth in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was measured using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. An effect of gliotoxin on the viability and proliferation of astrocytes, neurons and microglia was tested by MTS assays. Phagocytic activity of cells in the presence of gliotoxin was quantified using fluorescent latex beads and subsequent microscopic analysis; oxidative burst was studied by FACS. Results: Pathogenic Aspergillus species like A. fumigatus secrete significant levels of gliotoxin when cultivated in CSF. The corresponding concentration of gliotoxin was sufficient to affect the viability of astrocytes, neurons and microglial cells, with neurons and microglia being the most sensitive cell types. Subtoxic concentrations of gliotoxin diminished the capacity of microglia to phagocyte pathogens. Furthermore gliotoxin exaggerated the oxidative burst in infiltrating granulocytes induced by stimuli such as PMA. Therapeutic approaches might aim to neutralize the inhibitory or even toxic effect of gliotoxin and thus to reconstitute the potency of cerebral immunity. We used glutathione for this purpose, a tripeptide made up from cysteine, glutamate and glycin which act as a reducing compound. In first promising experiments with glutathione we were able to protect brain cells from gliotoxin concentrations which otherwise were shown to kill the cells. Furthermore glutathione reconstituted the phagocytic activity of immune cells in the presence of gliotoxin. We measured IP-10 levels in plasma supernatants from Quantiferon In Tube (QFT-IT) stimulated whole blood from 80 patients with culture and/or PCR proven active TB, 86 unexposed Danish high school students, and 38 unexposed high school teachers. Based on ROC curve analysis we established two IP-10 cutoff points and constructed a diagnostic test algorithm inspired by the QFT-IT test; with positive, negative, and indeterminate test outcome. Results: TB patients produced significantly higher levels of IP-10 and IFN-g compared with controls: for IFN-g median 215 pg/ml (IQR 22-651 pg/ml) vs. 0 pg/ml (IQR 0−0 pg/ml), for IP-10 median 2158 pg/ml (IQR 582-5882 pg/ml) vs. 37 pg/ml (IQR 13−99 pg/ml. IP-10 and IFN-g responses were highly correlated (0.81, p < 0.0001). Based on ROC curve analysis we selected a sensitive IP-10 cut-off (237 pg/ml), and a specific cut-off (673 pg/ml). A cut off for indeterminate test was established by comparing the mitogen IP-10/IFN-g ratio. QFT-IT and the specific IP-10 test showed comparable performance with equal sensitivity/specificity and 90% agreement (kappa 0.79), table 1. The sensitive IP-10 test had a higher sensitivity 71/80 (90%), but also a high degree of positive responders among the controls 14/124 (11%), primarily among the older teachers (10/14) Discussion: IP-10 is expressed in response to the RD1 antigens in consistent and significant higher levels than IFN-g. IP-10 has properties that enable the development of diagnostic test algorithm with positive, negative and indeterminate outcomes, performing with excellent concordance and comparable or even superior discriminatory power compared with the QFT-IT. As IP-10 is expressed in high amounts, it holds promise for the development of a new generation of more sensitive TB tests with simpler and potentially field-friendly read out formats, such as the lateral flow dipstick. The CAS family was the most prevalent in the study population (24.7%) followed by the T, EAI, and LAM families comprising 16.4%; 15.9%, and 15.5% of total isolates respectively; CAS and EAI strains were dominant in patients born in the Indian subcontinent, East Africa and South-East Asia, and LAM and T families were more common in patients born in Europe, UK and other parts of the world. Analysis of allelic diversity within certain loci in combination with results of spoligotyping and deletion mapping allowed the selection of loci of greater phylogenetical relevance (MIRU4, 24, 26, ETR-A, -B, -C) and propose VNTR codes (combinations of allelic variants) which can be potentially used for identification of families, major lineages and species within MTBC. A cohort of all HIV infected patients was followed at a tertiary care referral centre in Mexico City. Specific endpoints were defined and analysed in relation to tuberculosis infection, and other co-morbidities. (16) were lost to follow-up. Primary resistance to anti-TB drugs was 9.3%, whereas secondary resistance was 5.4%. Only two cases of MDR-TB were detected, both in patients with relapses and poor compliance to anti-TB treatment. Mortality was observed in 18.5% (17 cases) at their last visit. Tuberculosis was the cause of death in 11% (10). The median time to death attributed to TB was 12 days (IQR 3-428). The case definition was based on typical clinical subcutaneous lesion associated with positive specimens for NTM. An assessment practice study was performed to determine potential risk factors to be tested in a comparative epidemiological study. Data were collected including schedules of outpatient visits, localisation of injections, and type of injected products.  To test this experimentally we constructed a set of 29 isogenic strains carrying combinations of up to 5 resistance mutations found commonly in clinical isolates, and measured their associated levels of resistance and fitness. Fitness was measured in pairwise growth competition in vitro. M. Rodriguez-Dominguez, A. Ripoll, M.C. Turrientes, J.C. Galan, F. Baquero (Madrid, ES) Objective: To describe a robust molecular protocol based on realtime PCR method able to discriminate strains in pairwise competition experiments, in order to estimate easily the relative fitness. Methods: Two E. coli isogenic strains, REL606 and REL607, which differ in only one base pair (SNP) were used. This SNP, located in the arabinose operon, allowed us to discriminate between those strains by phenotypic (capacity to use arabinose as energy source) and genotypic methods (RT-PCR). Two forward primers (differing only in the SNP) and only one reverse primer were design to amplify specifically each one of the strains. The amplified product was detected with Sybr-green as detector dye. A calibration curve was made in each experiment using chromosomal DNA of known concentration. To validate the method, we quantified the relative fitness (W) in standard competition experiments between REL606 and REL607 wild-type strains. Moreover, two rifampicin-resistant spontaneous mutants, carrying the mutations S531F and L533P in RpoB obtained from REL606 and REL607 respectively, were coculture with their parental strains and between them during three days, plating each day and taking an aliquot for DNA extraction. Six replicates of each competition experiment were performed and W was calculated for both methods. The magnitude of the fitness difference corresponds to how much more slowly one strain grew relative to the other. Haemophilus influenzae (Hi), Neisseria meningitidis (Nm), Group A Streptococcus (GAS), and Group B Streptococcus (GBS) were forwarded to reference laboratories in AK (2000 AK ( -2006 , N Can (2000 N Can ( -2006 , GN (2001 -2006 ), Nor (2005 -2006 and N Swe (2003) (2004) (2005) for confirmation and serotyping. Norway did not provide data for GAS and GBS. Clinical and demographic information were collected using standardised surveillance forms. , and stx2f genes. Positive specimens were partially subtyped using the monoplex real-time PCRs to identify stx1, stx1c, stx1d, stx2f, and the group containing stx2, stx2c, stx2d, stx2e, and stx2g (stx2cdeg). Isolation of STEC strains was performed from stx2f positive specimens by culture on sorbitol MacConkey agar and colony screening by PCR. Results: A total of 37 specimens showed STEC specific amplification signals. Subtyping was successful in 35 of 37 specimens, and revealed stx2f (n = 4) as the third most prevalent genotype after stx2cdeg (n = 13) and stx1 (n = 6). Other genotypes detected included stx1 + stx1c (n = 2), stx1c (n = 2), stx1 + stx2cdeg (n = 1), and stx1/stx1c + stx2cdeg (n = 1). Patients positive for stx2f had uncomplicated diarrhoea (n = 2) and bloody diarrhoea (BD) (n = 2), although the BD could also be explained by co-infection/morbidity these patients. Isolation of an STEC strain was successful in 2/4 stx2f-positive specimens, and yielded an O63:H6 serotype, eae gene (intimin) positive in both cases. Both strains were also shown to be highly related based on pulsed field gel electrophoresis, although no epidemiological link was apparent between both patients. Conclusions: STEC that carry the stx2f gene were the third most prevalent stx-genotype in The Netherlands during the study. Our results suggest that stx2f-carrying STEC may be an overlooked cause of diarrhoea. Diagnostic screening strategies need to be adapted to detect this variant in the routine diagnostic laboratory. We performed a comparative study of the two control sample options with a microarray designed with three fully sequenced strains. We hybridised two of these strains as test samples using only the third strain as a control or a mix of the three strains as the control sample. The strain used in the single control was the one with more specific spots in the array. Resulting Log-ratios of test over control sample signal were used to classify genes as present or absent. We evaluated classification performance through the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. AUC measures the probability that the Log-ratio of a present gene is higher than that of an absent gene. Here we describe the development and application of fluorescence based diagnostic oligonucleotide microarrays for the genotyping of TEM, SHV, and CTX-M b-lactamase variants based on allele specific hybridisation. To increase the coverage, we developed chip modules to genotype plasmid-mediated AmpC and OXA-type beta lactamases. To enable a single all-in-one b-lactam resistance test for the clinic, we fully integrated individual chip modules (TEM, SHV, CTX-M) to a single ESBL chip platform. The technique involves amplification of the 16S rRNA gene with two differently labeled primers, digesting the amplicon with restriction endonucleases, and retrieving the molecular weight of the labeled terminal restriction fragments (the outer ends of the amplicon) in an automated DNA sequence apparatus. The labeling of both the forward and reverse primers might lead to a more accurate identification of species within a community profile since the presence of two peaks instead of one confirm the presence of a certain species. Firstly, cultures of three common intestinal habitants of the human gut were subjected to T-RFLP analyses, alone and in mixtures, to determine if competition in the PCR between species has an effect on the T-RFLP profiles. Secondly, mucosal biopsies from five colon locations per patient were gathered from 20 patients for analysis by T-RFLP. The three aforementioned species were quantified in the samples by quantative realtime PCR to determine if adequate amounts were present for detection by T-RFLP. Three-year prospective survey (02/2003-01/2006) with systematic mycological screening performed on all patients admitted to the SICU, immediately at admittance, then weekly until discharge. Patients with more than 2 weeks of Cg colonisation were retrospectively included in this study. For each patient, each isolate was genotyped using microsatellite-based MLVA method. Susceptibilities of Cg isolates to azoles were determined with NCCLS reference method (first and last isolate per strain per patient, susceptibilities to FLC, itraconazole, voriconazole VRC and posaconazole). Patient data (including azoles exposure during SICU stay) were retrospectively collected. Acquired FLC resistance was defined by MIC of the last isolate for FLC > 8 mg/mL and a 4x-fold increase of this MIC during SICU stay. Results: Thirty nine patients out of 1218 admitted in SICU were included. Characteristics of patients included were: mean age 65 years (±15), median SICU stay 30 days [range: 18-160], mean SAPS II score 44 (±14). Main underlying disorders were abdominal surgery and polytrauma. All patients harbored only one Cg strain, except one patient colonised with two different strains. Acquired azole resistance was not observed in six patients without azole exposure. Thirty three patients were given azole antifungals during SICU stay, all with high daily dose (DD) of FLC or VRC (mean DD: 470 mg/day). Nine out of 33 (27%) presented SICU-acquired resistance of their own Cg strain. Cg strains with FLC acquired resistance all showed cross-resistance to other azoles. No significant risk factor of acquisition was identified among patient data, characteristics of azole regimens used (duration, total dose) and Cg genotypes. Conclusion: Acquisition of cross-azole resistance following azoles exposure occurs frequently in SICU patients. Antifungal agents others than azoles (i.e. candins, polyenes) should be considered as initial therapy in SICU patients with suspected invasive candidiasis in the setting of prior azole exposure. We performed a continuous 20 step dilution series of amphotericin B between 0.2 and 3 mg/ml in 0.2 mg/ml steps, and evaluated the MICs in 115 isolates of Aspergillus spp. Isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus complex (n = 63), A. terreus complex (n = 35), Aspergillus flavus complex (n = 26) and Aspergillus niger complex (n = 16) were obtained from patients suffering from invasive aspergillosis and stored in water at room temperature. Susceptibility testing was performed according the EUCAST methodology for conidia forming moulds. An inoculum size of 2×10 5 -5×10 5 CFU/ml and RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% glucose (RPMI 2% G) as culture medium was used. MIC reading was done after 48hours of incubation at 37ºC. The MIC value was defined as a no-growth visual endpoint. In addition, we studied the in vivo response of several isolates to amphotericin B. Outcome data were obtained earlier in a temporarily neutropenic disseminated mouse model of invasive aspergillosis. Results: MIC distributions were as follows: for A. fumigatus complex ranging from 0.4 -1.4 mg/ml, with modal MIC of 0.8 mg/ml; for A. flavus complex from 0.8 -2.4 mg/ml with modal MIC of 1.2−1.4 mg/ml; for A. terreus complex from 1 ->3 mg/ml with a biphasic distribution with one modal MIC at 1.0 mg/ml and another at 2.4 mg/ml; and for A. niger complex from 0.4 -1.2 mg/ml with modal MIC of 0.8 mg/ml. Only A. flavus and A. niger complex distributions were approximately Gaussian. Suggested epidemiological cut-offs are therefore 1 mg/ml for A. fumigatus, A. niger and A. terreus complex, and 1.4 mg/ml for A. flavus complex. We were able to correlate in vivo and in vitro data. Mice infected with Aspergillus spp. showing MICs <1 mg/ml (n = 9) had a successful outcome, with MICs >1 mg/ml (n = 3) failed amphotericin B therapy (p < 0.05). The protocol was designed to present demographic data as well as the amounts and indications for antimicrobial agents. Treatments were recorded in relation to diagnoses, prophylactic use, community acquired (CAI) and hospital acquired infection (HAI). Three nation-wide PPS were performed in November 2003 November , 2004 November and 2006 . Three areas were identified for intervention before the last PPS; duration of perioperative prophylaxis, treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, use of fluoroquinolones in community-acquired cystitis in women. Direct information to all hospital physicians and feed-back of earlier results was used as the intervention strategy. Results: 13,420 patients treated with antimicrobial agents in 54, 49 and 64 hospitals were included in the three PPS. The number of admitted patients corresponds to 50−75% of all admitted patients in Sweden during one day. 32.5−34.9% of the admitted patients were treated with antimicrobials. The indication for treatment was CAI in 17.0−18.0%, HAI in 9.2−9.9% and prophylaxis in 6.3%. For adults cultures were taken before oral treatment in 60% and before parenteral treatment in 70%. Only minor changes in the patterns of the overall use of antimicrobials were observed. However, in lower urinary tract infections of women the relative use of mecillinam and trimethoprim increased from 36 to 44% and from 22 to 26%, respectively, while the use of fluoroquinolones decreased from 25 to 13%. For community acquired pneumonia no significant changes were observed. The 2006 PPS result shows a decrease of peri-operative treatments longer than one day from 47% in 2003 to 31% in 2006. The one-dose peri-operative prophylaxis in the lower gastrointestinal tract has increased from 62% to 77%. The total amount of antimicrobials used for adults was 40.  A. Calderaro, G. Piccolo, C. Gorrini, S. Peruzzi, G. Dettori, C. Chezzi, G. Snounou (Parma, IT; Paris, FR) Objectives: Malaria is the most frequent imported infection in Italy, related to the increasing number of travellers and migratory flows from endemic countries. Microscopic examination has poor sensitivity and may give problems in the differentiation of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), P. malariae (Pm), P. ovale (Po), and P. vivax (Pv), especially in cases of low parasitaemia or mixed infections: to circumvent these limitations molecular assays based on 18S-rDNA were developed by several research groups, including us. Our study aimed to accurately and promptly diagnose cases of malaria and to describe their occurrence in our area comparing the results of microscopy and molecular assays, in order to assess the usefulness of these assays in the diagnostic practice. Conclusion: Despite microscopy remains the reference diagnostic method (rapid and inexpensive), in some cases molecular assays are the only ones allowing a correct diagnosis of malaria, particularly to detect infections by species other than Pf and mixed infections. However, in our study only one PCR assay developed by us showed the higher accuracy in Po detection due to specific primer design done to recognise all the variants in Po 18S-rRNA gene. PCR proved to be more sensitive and specific than microscopy and changed the picture of malaria epidemiology in our area detecting 5 single and 1 mixed infections missed by microscopy, revealing 5 single and 2 mixed infections incorrectly diagnosed by microscopy and giving speciation in 6 cases in which microscopy had limited the result to genus identification. The most prevalent malaria cases in our area as well as in Italy were imported from Africa and due to Pf, followed by Po and Pv. In our experience a rapid and accurate diagnosis of malaria allowed to administer a prompt and targeted therapy with positive impact on the clinical management of the patients. Between the 13 Spanish's patients 7 of them were children (age between 0 and 6 years old); and the other 6 remaining patients were adult women. These 6 women, fitting of endemic areas were obtained nationality in Spain. A nested case-control study design with conditional logistic regression analysis is performed using administrative data on patients aged 65 and over, admitted through the Emergency Department (ED) to a medical unit, with a recent antibiotic prescription. The relationship between three groups of variables -ED exposure measures (length of stay, level of crowding); inpatient variables (unit and room types, number of room changes); antibiotic type -and the occurrence of nosocomial CDAD is examined, while controlling for several factors previously identified as associated with CDAD transmission. [1.72; 6.61] are associated with the occurrence of CDAD, and that both groups are the most administered antibiotics in the sample. Conclusions: This study fails to identify any significant association between nosocomial CDAD and measures of ED crowding or increased patient contacts due to room changes or the use of multi-bed ward rooms. However, the validity of our methodology is supported by the association between antibiotic prescriptions and nosocomial CDAD occurrence, as already quoted in the literature. We note a temporal decrease in the reported rate of Clostridium difficile infection in our institution since the study period (April 1, 2003 -March 31, 2004 and suggest that the most likely reason is improving housekeeping practices over this period. thermal conditions to kill C. difficile spores in PBS (i.e. no organic challenge) was also evaluated using spore suspension testing at 80oC and 90oC. Two different makes of W-BPWs were evaluated. Results: Our data on suspension testing showed that the C. difficile spore count was not reduced after 5 minutes at 90oC. Simulated-use testing demonstrated that the ward-BPW when used without detergent, did not effectively eliminate C. difficile spores from inoculated plastic or stainless steel bedpans whereas the CPD-BPW did. The thermal disinfection default cycle in the two makes of W-BPW and the CPD-BPW was 80ºC for 1 minute. The ISO15883−3 guidance document recommends these thermal conditions as adequate for reprocessing of bedpans. Exposure to these conditions resulted in~1 Log10 reduction in spores. However, the 80oC for 1 min thermal cycle combined with the 116ºC drying cycle for 7 mins used by the CPD-BPW killed 6 Log10 C. difficile spores. Further testing showed that using an alkaline detergent along with the W-BPW did reliably eliminate C. difficile spores. Conclusion: Despite the wide use of 80ºC for 1 minute, our data showed that these thermal conditions alone were not effective in killing C. difficile spores. Only when alkaline detergent was used was the W-BPW able to eliminate C. difficile spores from bedpans. We recommend that alkalkine detergent always be used with W-BPWs to reduce the risk of C. difficile spores remaining on reprocessed bedpans as this could pose a risk for nosocomial transmission. (ST80) harbours an H2 haplotype which is described as the ancestral allele that gave rise to the other variants. These trends, although largely regionalised, must be taken into account when targeting skin infections as well as other infections, including community-acquired pneumonia. In summary, these emerging tendencies towards increased incidence of CA-MRSA and decreased susceptibility to antimicrobial agents must be considered when choosing empiric treatment options. In most, but not all, U.S. cities, CA-MRSA is now the most common pathogen cultured from patients with skin and soft tissue infections in emergency departments. Epidemic community-associated MRSA disease has also been reported from some rural areas. In Canada, a similar pattern of emergence is occurring with the West Coast being most affected. Of concern is the risk of greater incidence of communityacquired pneumonias caused by MRSA in the future. Although severe pneumonia caused by CA-MRSA was reported in children soon after this pathogen emerged in the U.S., reports in adults have been rare and typically associated with influenza virus infection. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 10 cases of severe MRSA CAP in 2006; six of the 10 patients died. Although a small sampling of patients, these cases nonetheless underscore the need for healthcare providers to be extremely vigilant for cases of severe CAP caused by MRSA. The emergence of MRSA strains since 1961 has complicated the treatment of S. aureus infections, and glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin) are, in many cases, the only therapeutic alternative. Glycopeptides remain the first-line option when infection due to MRSA is suspected or diagnosed. However, vancomycin treatment failure is not uncommon, even when MRSA strains are fully susceptible to vancomycin (MIC 2 mg/mL). A reduction in the efficacy of vancomycin against MRSA strains with a high vancomycin MIC (1−2 mg/mL) has been described in observational studies with low number of patients, suggesting that subtle changes in the MIC may explain clinical failures. These findings require healthcare practitioners to consider alternative treatments and look to the future, as newer, more active compounds are developed to improve the treatment armamentarium against communityacquired infections with drug resistant S. aureus.

Gorgievski-Hrisoho (Berne, CH) Respiratory viruses are among the most frequent human pathogens worldwide, leading to a significant number of hospitalisations, especially in children and in immune-compromised patients. Several new diagnostics tools for respiratory viruses have recently appeared on the market, including the xTag Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) by Luminex Molecular Diagnostics. The goal of the present study was to compare this new multiplex PCR method with conventional direct immunofluorescence (DIF) in children's nasopharyngeal aspirates for the following viruses: respiratory sincytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV), parainfluenza viruses 1−3 (PIF), influenza viruses A and B (IF), as well as human metapneumovirus (hMPV). The RVP kit permits in addition the detection of entero-/rhinoviruses, coronaviruses and parainfluenza virus 4. In total 240 nasopharyngeal aspirates (126 DIF negative and 114 DIF positive samples) were analysed. All RSV, PIVA, IF and hMPV DIF positive samples (43, 15, 18 and 11, respectively) were confirmed as positive for the same virus by RVP. For ADV, however, only 13 out of 27 DIF positive samples (48%) were also ADV positive by RVP. The samples with discrepant results are currently being reanalysed by DIF and by a second, independent PCR. Of note is the finding that over 64% (81/126) of all DIF negative samples were positive when analysed with RVP. This was in great part due to the additional entero-/rhinoviruses detected by RVP (75/81), but also because of additional RSV, IF, PIF, ADV and hMPV positive samples that had been missed with the DIF assays (21/81). Finally, using RVP we detected as many as 10.4% (25/240) of double and 0.5% (1/240) of triple infections, versus a single double infection detected by DIF. The implications of our findings for both diagnostics as well as clinical practices are discussed. We have conducted the comparative study of the antiviral effect of low-and high-molecular hemagglutinin inhibitors on influenza A (H1N1, H2N2, H3N2) and B viruses in the inhibition assay of infectious focus forming in MDCK cells. To characterise efficacy of inhibitors in vivo we have investigated a mouse model, based on measuring the value of fifty percent respiratory infectious dose (RID50) for mice. To elucidate mechanism of action for hemagglutinin inhibitors we have examined influenza virion morphology by the negative contrast techniques. In the present study we tested sera of 249 patients with suspected Lyme borreliosis, collected from routine work, with three serological methods targeting different borrelial antigens: i) in immunofluorescence assay (IFA) a local isolate of B. afzelii (strain SA/91), the most frequently isolated Borrelia species in Slovenia, was used as an antigen; ii) in Lyme Borreliosis ELISA kit (DakoCytomation, Denmark) the antigen was purified native B. burgdorferi flagellum, and iii) in chemiluminiscence immunoassay LIAISON ® (Diasorin, Saluggia, Italy) antigen for IgM antibodies detection is OspC while for IgG antibodies Vls E antigen is used. 1. MRSA proliferation according to the control of intestinal bacteria: A. Four GAM broth tubes were prepared, and tubes were inoculated 10 5 cfu/ml of viable MRSA328GTS, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC29212, and Bacteroides fragilis GM7000, and cultivated for 24 hours (= independent cultivation). Next, a GAM broth tube was prepared, and inoculated mixed up with above 4 strains (= mixed cultivation). B. After managed under eight days of total parental nutrition (TPN) and continuous administration of antacid, viable bacterial counts in large bowel of male Wistar rats (body weight 250g) were counted after an inoculation of 10 9 cfu/rat MRSA238 solution by gastric tube on day four.
