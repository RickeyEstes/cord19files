In order to investigate the factors contributing to the changes in the number of hospitalisation days per person between 2000 and 2010 in Hong Kong, data on the total population and public hospital admissions for this period (table 1) were collected from the Census and Statistics Department and the Hospital Authority, respectively. The census statistics include sex and age for the entire population. The Hospital Authority provides episode-based hospitalisation data which contain information on age, gender, hospital, date of birth, district of residence, dates of admission and discharge, disease code, duration of stay for each visit, and discharge destination. However, as a significant proportion of the patient data have missing disease codes, we will not examine the disease-code specific duration of stay in this analysis. Although the capacity of the Hong Kong hospital system has varied over the years, the overall occupancy rate is about 90% on average. The hospital service model in Hong Kong remained relatively unchanged during the study period. It is also assumed that the range of clinical services and patient case mix in the public hospital system remained constant over the 11-year period.
