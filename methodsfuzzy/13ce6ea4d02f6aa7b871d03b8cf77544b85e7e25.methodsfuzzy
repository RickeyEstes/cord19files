By modifying the sample protein distribution, prefractionation strategies allow proteins initially present at low concentrations to be accessible for analysis. Hence, many different fractionation/separation techniques, considering protein's biochemical and biophysical properties such as molecular weight, isoelectric point, and hydrophobicity, as well as the efficiency and reproducibility, have been developed and applied in a multidimensional fashion to enhance detection of low-abundance proteins in human serum/ plasma [22, 23] . Due to the great "masking" effect created by highabundance proteins on the LMW proteins detection, the depletion of high-abundance proteins has become one of the most commonly applied strategies to reduce dynamic complexity of serum/plasma. Indeed, Tu and coworkers reveal that removal of the top 7 or top 14 high-abundance proteins has been shown to result in a 25% increase in the number of identified proteins [24] . So far, there are several different approaches commonly used to remove high-abundance proteins from human serum/plasma, including organic solvent precipitation, centrifugal ultrafiltration, or affinity-based techniques.
