Monoclonal antibodies used for pH1N1 ELISA Two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (10B4 and 1E12) that recognize the cluster-specific epitopes in HA of pH1N1 virus were created by immunizing with a pH1N1 isolate (A/California/04/2009(H1N1)) in mice. The specificities of the two mAbs were determined in a series of influenza viral isolates, using haemagglutination inhibition assays and cellbased microneutralization assays, performed as previously described [6, 7] (Table 1) . mAb 10B4 was then coated on the microplate, and mAb 1E12 was conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Detection protocol of pH1N1 ELISA A schematic diagram of the principle and manipulation of pH1N1 ELISA is shown in Fig. 1 . For detection by pH1N1 ELISA, 50 lL of viral lysis buffer was added to the coated wells, and a 100-lL specimen aliquot was then added and mixed. After incubation for 60 min at 37°C, the plate was washed five times with a washing buffer. Then, 100 lL of 1E12-horseradish peroxidase solution was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. After five washes, 100 lL of tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution was added and incubated at 37°C for 15 min, and the optical density (OD) 450/630 nm was measured with a microplate reader (Sunrise, Tecan, Switzerland) (Fig. 1) . The final result was obtainable within 105 min. The cut-off value was set as mean + 4 standard deviations, equal to 2.1-fold of the mean value of two negative control wells or 0.105 if the mean negati value was <0.05. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasopharyngeal aspirate/nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), nasal swab/nasal wash, throat wash, oropharyngeal swab, cell culture supernatant and allantoic fluid specimens were available for the test without any pretreatment. However, the swab specimens need to be transported in viral transport medium (phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 100 U/mL kanamycin and 120 U/mL ampicillin) before testing.
