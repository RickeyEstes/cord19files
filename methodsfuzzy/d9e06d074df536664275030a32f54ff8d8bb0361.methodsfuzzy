The accompanying Supplementary Information (Text S1) describes in detail the construction of the vectors used for expression of synthetic genes coding for the E1-E2DTM segment of the 9 HCV isolates tested (Table 1) , the protocols for production, purification and conformational characterization of recombinant HCV E2e, as well as the computer and experimental analyses used for secondary structure predictions. Finally, a detailed description of the procedures used for the experimental identification of the cysteine residues involved in 8 disulfide bonds of E2 is provided.
