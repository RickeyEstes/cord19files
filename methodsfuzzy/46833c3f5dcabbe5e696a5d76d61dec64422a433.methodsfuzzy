One of the basic problems hindering studies on protein S-palmitoylation lies in the fact that there is no identifiable consensus sequence for the palmitoylation site that could facilitate its prediction. From the technical point of view, the progress in a comprehensive survey of protein S-palmitoylation was also hampered by a lack of antibodies detecting this modification, with the sole exception of an antibody specific to palmitoylated PSD-95 (95) . A classical method used to demonstrate protein palmitoylation is based on metabolic labeling of living cells with [ 3 H]-palmitic acid, subsequent immunoprecipitation of a selected protein and detection of the incorporated tritiated fatty acid by autoradiography (96) . A major disadvantage of this method is its low sensitivity. Only a minute fraction of the radioactive palmitate is bound to proteins, the majority being incorporated into lipids, which requires lengthy film exposure (counting in days). A methodological breakthrough in the identification of palmitoylated proteins came with the development of two nonradioactive methods based on so-called click chemistry (97) (98) (99) and acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) (74, 100) . These techniques have paved the way for high-throughput mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of protein palmitoylation in various cells and tissues and facilitated identification of new palmitoylated proteins of both pathogens and host cells involved in the innate immune responses. In the click chemistry-based method, cells are metabolically labeled with a palmitic acid analog bearing an alkyne group at the Ï‰ carbon of the fatty acyl chain, such as 17-octadecynoic acid (17ODYA) or alk-16 (Figure 2A) , and this step resembles the classic labeling of cells with [ 3 H]-palmitic acid. However, in the click chemistry-based assay, the labeling and lysis of cells is followed by in vitro coupling of the function group of the palmitic acid analog to a reporter tag, which greatly enhances the sensitivity of detection of labeled proteins (98, 99) . Thus, after cell lysis, the labeled proteins are subjected to Cu (I) -catalyzed cycloaddition known as "click" reaction with an azide-bearing detection tag. In this step, a triazol is formed between the alkyne group in the palmitic acid analog and the azide of the tag (Figure 2A) . The azide-bearing tags can be either fluorescent, such as tetramethylrhodamine or dyes with infrared fluorescence, or carry a biotin moiety. Depending on the tag used, subsequent SDS-PAGE separation of proteins allows global visualization of palmitoylated proteins by simple in-gel fluorescence or by blotting with a streptavidin-conjugated reporter (98, 101, 102) . Notably, proteins biotinylated via the click reaction can also be enriched on streptavidin-coated beads and then subjected to on-bead tryptic digestion (or in-gel digestion if eluted from the beads) followed by identification by mass spectrometry. Such comprehensive click chemistry-based proteomic analysis has brought about identification of an array of palmitoylated proteins in dendritic cells (10, 103) , macrophage-like RAW264 cells (14) , and T cells (99, 104, 105) . Some of the S-palmitoylated proteins newly identified in those studies, such as IFITM3 and TLR2, are involved in the host-pathogen interactions regulating innate immune responses (10, 103) , while many others are known to contribute to adaptive immunity (99, 105) , as described below. Recently, global profiling of Toxoplasma gondii (the causative agent of toxoplasmosis) has been performed revealing that many components of the parasite's motility complex are palmitoylated (106) . Similar studies on Cryptococcus neoformans (the fungus causing cryptococcal meningitis) have revealed a contribution of specific zDHHC palmitoyl acyltransferase, called Pfa4, to its virulence (107) . Moreover, application of analogs of various saturated and unsaturated fatty acids confirmed the heterogeneous nature of the fatty acylation of proteins in RAW264 cells and suggested that dietary unsaturated fatty acids, after incorporation to proteins, can change their properties and thereby affect the functioning of immune cells (14) . The major advantage of the click chemistry-based method is that it can reveal the time course of protein S-palmitoylation. By using click chemistry-based labeling in the pulse-chase mode, one can follow the dynamics of protein palmitoylation. With such an approach, it was found that the palmitate turnover on Lck, an Src-family tyrosine kinase, is accelerated by T cell activation (72) . Additional introduction of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cells (SILAC) has provided quantitative proteomic data , and after cell lysis, the click reaction is conducted with azido-tagged biotin or fluorescent probes allowing enrichment and detection of labeled proteins in various ways. Biotinylated proteins can be bound on a streptavidin resin and then released using, e.g., high concentrations of urea and SDS (108) . When a cleavable derivative of biotin, azido-azo-biotin, is used the labeled proteins are eluted from streptavidin beads with sodium dithionite, which cleaves the diazobenzene moiety in the linker arm of azido-azo-biotin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry or immunoblotting (109) . (B) ABE method. Cells or tissues are lysed, free thiol groups of proteins are blocked by alkylation, and palmitoyl moieties are released with hydroxylamine. The newly exposed protein thiol groups are subjected to labeling with biotin-HPDP allowing selective binding, elution, and analysis of the originally S-palmitoylated proteins. The proteins can also be captured without biotinylation through a direct interaction of their thiol residues with a thiol-reactive resin (acyl-RAC technique). on the dynamics of protein palmitoylation in the cell (104, 110) . This approach revealed, rather unexpectedly, that in unstimulated T cell hybridoma, the palmitoylation of most protein species does not undergo turnover (104) . Another advantage of the click chemistry-based assay is its high specificity, because the alkyne group introduced in the analog of palmitic acid is not normally found in cells (98, 102) . The click chemistry-based methods can also be used to follow the cellular localization of palmitoylated proteins by immunofluorescence when combined with the proximity ligation technique (111, 112) . Palmitoylation of individual proteins can also be studied after their immunoprecipitation (11, 72, 73, 98 ). Despite its unquestionable success, the click chemistry-based methods have limitations. They will detect only those proteins that undergo palmitoylation during the period of the metabolic labeling of cells. One should also bear in mind that the palmitic acid analog can be incorporated at S-, N-, and O-palmitoylation sites alike (111, 112) . In addition, although 17ODYA (alk-16) is preferentially used to mimic palmitoylation of proteins, it can also be incorporated with low efficiency at N-myristoylation sites of proteins (98, 99) . Another group of proteins that will be labeled with the palmitic acid analog but are not S-palmitoylated are those bearing the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (85, 113) . Most of these limitations can be overcome using various fatty acid reporters, inhibitors, and by exploiting the sensitivity of the thioester bond to hydroxylamine treatment. Given the large variety of chemical reporters preferentially mimicking distinct fatty acids, recent years have witnessed a plethora of chemistry-based proteomic studies not only on palmitoylated but also myristoylated proteins and proteins bearing the GPI anchor, including those of pathogens and immune cells (10, 14, 85, 86, 114) The aBe Method Reveals Protein
