Amplification of target sequences by PCR method is currently the most common and most sensitive molecular diagnostic approach to the detection of CHV in natural or experimentally infected animals. The PCR assays described initially were gel based, implying that the amplified products are visualized by UV illumination of ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. Miyoshi and colleagues 16 combined a nested PCR with Southern blotting and showed that the detection limit of this combination was equivalent to 1 TCID 50 . Schultze and Baumgärtner 17 described nested gel-based PCR and in situ hybridization assays to diagnose acute CHV infection in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of 1-to 3-week-old puppies that were naturally infected. The specificity of the PCR products was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion. Viral DNA was detected in a variety of cell types, such as bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells, hepatocytes, renal tubular epithelial cells, neurons, fibrocytes, cardiac myocytes, and endothelial cells. This is in accordance with the previously described "pantropism" of CHV. When paraffin-embedded tissues are used for PCR, it has to be kept in mind that the quality of the DNA can be affected by several factors, such as the length of time between tissue removal and fixation, the presence of nucleases in the tissue, and the length of storage of the paraffin blocks. Burr and colleagues 13 developed a gel-based PCR for CHV and used it in conjunction with Southern blotting to confirm the authenticity of the amplicons. They also assessed the PCR compatibility of each sample for CHV PCR by first verifying that primers specific for a portion of the canine pancreatic lipase gene-amplified their target in each of the tissue extracts. The assay was capable of detecting approximately 14 genomic copies spiked into 1 g of placental DNA and approximately 3500 copies when spiked into 0.2 ml of blood. Erles and colleagues 18 described a gel-based PCR targeting a 494 -base pair region of a gene homologous to HSV-1 UL 37. Reubel and colleagues 52 described a nested PCR that had a sensitivity that was 100 times higher than virus isolation. Ronsse and colleagues 22 described the use of 2 PCR assays for CHV. One of these assays had a sensitivity of 0.01 CCID 50 . The most sensitive and specific method currently available to detect CHV DNA is probe-based real-time PCR. A fluorogenic real-time PCR assay was described by Reubel and colleagues 52 and reported to have a detection limit of 10 copies of viral DNA. The first probe-based multiplex real-time PCR for CHV was reported by Ledbetter and colleagues. 8 Very recently, Decaro and colleagues 14 reported the development and complete validation of a probe-based real-time quantitative PCR for the detection and quantitation of CHV DNA in clinical samples. The assay was found to be very sensitive, since it could detect as few as 10 copies of the target per sample. In comparison with the gel-based PCR assay described by Schulze and Baumgärtner, 17 which was used in parallel, this assay has a 10-fold lower detection limit. Specificity for CHV was very high, as determined by lack of amplification of other canine viruses. The dynamic range was validated by successful amplification of a number of CHV-positive samples from different geographic locations. Reproducibility of the assay was determined by determining both intra-assay and interassay variability between the results obtained with samples containing variable amounts of target DNA. Both intra-assay and interassay variability, expressed as a coefficient of variation, were fairly low, were dependent on the target concentration, and were found to increase with decreasing target copy numbers. A potential pitfall of PCR assays is that the sample contains substances that are inhibiting the reaction, thus potentially leading to false-negative results. To control for this possibility, an internal control construct was spiked into each sample at known quantity and co-amplified. This way, any inhibition would be readily detectable from a decrease in the expected signal resulting from the amplification of this internal control. A relatively simple way to avoid inhibition was to prepare a 10-fold dilution of the sample. Since it allows absolute quantitation, the assay was used to determine viral loads in tissues of pups that had died from acute infection and a vaginal swab collected from the dam. The viral load in the vaginal swab was 1.57 ϫ 10 3 copies/10 l. The highest viral load in tissues was 5.76 ϫ 10 9 copies/10 l, present in kidney homogenates. The authors concluded that, since it quantitates copy numbers over a wide range, this assay will be very useful not only for diagnostic purposed, but also for future pathogenesis studies and for the testing of the effect of antivirals on the replication of CHV.
