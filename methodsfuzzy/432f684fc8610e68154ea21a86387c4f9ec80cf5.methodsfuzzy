Monitoring of airborne contamination was conducted using a Surface Air System Super-180 sieve impactor active air sampler (Cherwell Laboratories, Bicester, UK). The air sampler was situated in the corner of the isolation room, approximately 1e1.5m above the ground, and sampled the air by actively drawing a pre-set volume of air through the sampler. Fivehundred-litre air samples were collected every 15 min over 10-h (08:00e18:00 h) and 24-h (08:00e08:00 h) periods on to non-selective tryptone soya agar (TSA) plates (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK), favourable for environmental sampling. An activity log was compiled to record room activity that may correlate with peaks in air contamination. After sampling, TSA plates were incubated at 37 C for 48 h and enumerated. The total number of microbial cfu on each plate was corrected for the statistical probability of multiple particles passing through the same hole by referring to correction tables supplied with the equipment [13] . The probable count was then used to calculate the cfu/m 3 sampled using the equation: where V is volume of air sampled, Pr is probable count, and X is cfu per 1 m 3 of air.
