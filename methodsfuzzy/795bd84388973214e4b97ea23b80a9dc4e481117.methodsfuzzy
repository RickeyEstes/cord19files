Cell culture, transfections, and siRNA knockdowns All cell lines used in these studies (HEK293T, A549, NCI-H358, NCI-H2009, and MEFs) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 4.5 g/L D-glucose, L-glutamine, 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Scientific) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in a humidified incubator. HEK293T and A549 cells were purchased from ATCC. NCI-H358 and NCI-H2009 cells were obtained from the ATCC and provided to us by Dr. Gustavo Leone (The Ohio State University). NEDD4 WT and KO MEFs used in this study were generated by Dr. Hiroshi Kawabe (Max Planck Institute) [38] and were kindly provided to us by Dr. Matthew Pratt (University of Southern California) who also generated the retrovirally reconstituted control cell lines. For Western blotting, cells were plated for 90% confluency in 6-well plates for 24 h prior to transfection with 2 μg/well of plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For microscopy, MEFs were plated for 50% confluency on glass coverslips in 12-well plates for 24 h prior to overnight treatment with IFN-α (BEI Resources). IFITM3 constructs were expressed from the pCMV-HA or pCMV-myc vectors (Clontech) as described previously [2, 4, 23] . IFITM3 mutants were made using the QuikChange Multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmids expressing HA-NEDD4 and HA-NEDD4-C867A were obtained from Addgene (plasmids 27002 and 26999, deposited by Dr. Joan Massagué, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) [61] , and plasmids expressing FLAG-NEDD4, FLAG-NEDD4-ΔWW, and HA-CBL-B were kindly provided by Dr. Jian Zhang (The Ohio State University). FLAG-SMURF1 and FLAG-SMURF2 were obtained from Addgene (plasmids 11752 and 11746, desposited by Jeff Wrana, University of Toronto) [62] . IFITM3 knockdown in MEFs was performed using Silencer Select Ifitm3 siRNA (Ambion, catalog no. 4390816) and negative control (Ambion, catalog no. 4390844). Human NEDD4 knockdown in A549, NCI H358, and NCI H2009 cells was performed using Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool Human NEDD4 (GE Healthcare, catalog no. L-007178-00) and Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus Control Pool Non-targeting control (GE Healthcare, catalog no. D-001810- [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . siRNAs were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Transfection of siRNA was performed for 24 h for mIFITM3 knockdown, and 48 h for NEDD4 knockdown. For Western blotting, cells were lysed with 1% Brij buffer (0.1 mM triethanolamine, 150 mM NaCl, 1% BrijO10 (Sigma), pH 7.4) containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) and 25 μM MG132 (Sigma). Immunoprecipitations were performed using EZview Red anti-c-myc or anti-HA affinity gel (Sigma), or with Protein G Plus Agarose Suspension (Calbiochem) in conjunction with anti-mIFITM3. Chloroquine, bafilomycin, and leupeptin were purchased from Sigma.
