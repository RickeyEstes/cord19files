Studies of virus persistence and the determination of a virus' ability to retain infectivity are usually performed according to basic principles. Generally, tested samples are artifi cially contaminated by a virus suspension containing a determined concentration of infectious particles, and the samples are then stored or processed under defi ned conditions. Subsequently, the viruses are extracted from the sample and the infectious units are quantifi ed. The comparison between the number of infectious viruses isolated from a tested sample and the number which was originally introduced provides data about the persistence of virus infectivity (Rzezutka and Cook, 2004 ) . Studies can be performed under laboratory or under natural conditions; both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of studies carried out under laboratory conditions are the possibilities for precisely defi ned and stable conditions (e.g., temperature, relative humidity and pH). Virus persistence is infl uenced by combinations of biological, physical and chemical factors, the various permutations of which it is not feasible to successfully recreate under laboratory conditions. Thus, laboratory experiments can be used only to defi ne the effect of individual factors on virus persistence. In contrast, experiments performed under natural conditions provide compact data about virus persistence in the environment. However, problems could arise with regard to the defi nition of specifi c conditions infl uencing virus persistence. Successful detection of infectious viral particles in the environment is complicated by several factors, such as virus size; the wide variation among and within viral genera; low concentration; the presence of substances which can interfere with analysis procedures; the limits of detection of different techniques; and the absence of reliable controls (Vasickova et al ., 2010 ) . Various methods have been developed for the isolation of infectious viral particles from different kinds of matrices (e.g., water, soil, food and surfaces). Their basic principles and aims are similar; they involve the separation of viral particles (elution, washing or fi ltration) from the sample and their subsequent concentration to an amount which is suitable for proper detection. Successful detection depends on both the extraction method and the detection techniques. The standard methods for the detection of infectious viruses and thus viral survival under different conditions still involve cell culture. Susceptible cell lines in which the viruses propagate are required. The advantages are the direct detection of infectious viral particles and their sensitivity; theoretically, these methods can detect a single viable viral particle (Reynolds et al ., 2001 ) . The quantifi cation of infectious virions can be achieved through the use of cell culture in a quantitative format, for example, plaque assay. Routinely cultivable viruses include poliovirus and related viruses from the family Picornaviridae , astroviruses, rotaviruses, and cell culture-adapted strains of hepatitis A virus (HAV) (Richards, 2012 ). However, each virus type or even strain has different capabilities and thus may require different conditions for effective propagation in cell culture; for example, not all enteroviruses are able to propagate on one cell line (Dahling, 1991 ) . Cell culture methods can also be time-consuming: the time required varying between 4 and 30 days depending on the virus. Furthermore, detection is problematic in the case of those viruses which cannot be grown in conventional cell culture: for example, human norovirus (NoV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) (Rodriguez et al ., 2009 ; Vasickova et al ., 2010 ) . Although NoVs have been reported growing in highly differentiated 3D cell cultures (Straub et al ., 2007 ) , these systems require specialised equipment and extensive experience, and have proven diffi cult to successfully reproduce (Parshionikar et al ., 2010 ) . The lack of a suitable cell culture method for the detection of infectious particles of non-cultivable viruses such as HAV or NoV has led to the use of surrogate viruses, which provides at least predictive data about the survival of non-cultivable viruses in the environment. The selection of a proper surrogate virus is usually based on its ability to propagate in cell cultures, and its genetic, biological, physical and chemical relatedness to the virus which is to be isolated. Although several surrogates have been used specifi cally for NoV ( Table 9 .1 ; Richards, 2012 ), differences have been found between the inactivation of NoV and these viruses. It was also shown that the susceptibility of different NoV surrogates to temperature, environmental and food-processing conditions or disinfectants differs dramatically between these viruses (Cannon et al ., 2006 ) . Moreover, several studies reported that HAV strains that have adapted to cell culture have diverse sensitivities to heat and high pressure (Shimasaki et al ., 2009 ) . Differing modes of inactivation can be anticipated also among other kinds of viruses. However, differences between strains of viruses belonging to the same genus may not be as pronounced as those between the non-cultivable viruses and their surrogates. Therefore, data obtained by the use of surrogate viruses should be evaluated and presented carefully as presumptive evidence of how pathogens may respond to different treatments. Thus, the use of surrogate viruses and extrapolation from the persistence of surrogates to the persistence of non-cultivable viruses is questionable (Richards, 2012 ). Molecular techniques are an alternative method, particularly for the detection of viral genomes. These methods, based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Malorny et al ., 2003 ; Shimasaki et al. , 2009 ) , nucleic acid sequence-based amplifi cation (NASBA) (Cook, 2003 ; Casper et al ., 2005 ) or their quantitative format (qPCR, qNASBA), represent highly sensitive and specifi c assays. Molecular techniques can be used for all types of viruses (in the case of RNA viruses it is necessary to run a reverse transcription reaction prior to PCR), can determine the presence of different agents in the same sample, allow the identifi cation of non-cultivable viruses, are rapid and can be used to quantify the viral load in the sample. Besides, additional sequencing of the amplicons allows the establishment of epidemiologic associations. The disadvantage of molecular methods is that, when used alone, they are not able to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious viruses. This is due to the ability of the viral capsid to protect nucleic acid even in non-infectious particles in many instances (Ogorzaly et al ., 2010 ) . Therefore, the use of PCR or NASBA has limited application for persistence studies. In the case of commonly cultivable viruses, the integration of cell culture and PCR (i.e., integrated cell culture-polymerase chain reaction; ICC-PCR) can allow the detection of infectious viruses in the space of hours or days compared with the days or weeks necessary with cell culture alone (Reynolds et al ., 2001 ; Gallagher and Margolin, 2007 ) . The detection of enteroviruses in water samples, for example, is reduced to 5 days. The assay is based on an initial replication of viral particles using an appropriate cell culture for a short period, followed by PCR amplifi cation of a specifi c part of the viral genome. The sensitivity of this method is comparable to that obtained using a second passage of cell culture (Rodriguez et al ., 2009 ) . So far the use of ICC-PCR has been described for the detection of enteroviruses, HAV, enteric adenoviruses, reovirus and astroviruses (Shoeib et al ., 2009 ; Rigotto et al ., 2010 ; Schlindwein et al ., 2010 ) . Despite the major advantages of this method, namely that it overcomes the limitations of cell culture and PCR methodologies when used alone, a system capable of detecting infectious non-cultivable viruses is still lacking. To address the limitations of PCR-based methods several new approaches have been developed recently (Gilpatrick et al ., 2000 ; Nuanualsuwan and Cliver, 2002 ; Parshionikar et al ., 2010 ; Li et al ., 2011 ) . Generally, these include additional sample pre-treatment steps prior to nucleic acid isolation or PCR. These steps utilize the essential properties of the viral capsid, which are associated with the loss of infectivity of viruses (Cliver, 2009a ). However, these methods have been successfully used to prevent the transcription and amplifi cation only of certain kinds of inactivated viruses, and serious limitations have arisen during their application ( Table 9 .2 ). Despite this, with further development these assays have the potential to provide more information about virus persistence. Generally, for public health protection, the usefulness of a method is determined by its applicability to all cultivable and non-cultivable strains of viruses, its detection of viral infectivity and the rapidity with which the results are obtained (Parshionikar et al. , 2010 ) . A combination of molecular techniques and cell culture methods should be used (Cliver, 2009b ) , but this does not solve the problem of non-cultivable viruses such as NoV and HEV. The ideal solution would involve a single and simple pre-treatment of any kind of sample that would quickly preclude nucleic acid amplifi cation from non-infectious viruses (Cliver, 2009b ) . None of the pre-treatment procedures is applicable for all viruses and further optimization is needed.
