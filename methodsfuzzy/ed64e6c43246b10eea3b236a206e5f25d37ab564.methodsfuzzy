Almost all of the currently used vaccines were developed by classical methods. There are two categories of licensed vaccines used for mononegaviruses: inactivated and live vaccines. In an inactivated vaccine, an adjuvant, which non-specifically enhances the immune response to a given antigen, is necessary to give an adequate protective immunity. When an animal is vaccinated for the first time, a double vaccination is required to induce an adequate level of immunity. The Vaccine against rabies virus is an example of an inactivated vaccine. Inactivated vaccines usually give rise to high serum antibody titer. However, inactivated vaccines are rather ineffective in stimulating appropriate specific cell-mediated and mucosal immune responses. Thus, the systemic humoral immunity and immunological memory will probably contribute the most to the vaccinal immunity against the infectious diseases. A live attenuated vaccine is generally composed of viruses that are rendered avirulent through attenuation and are still able to replicate in the host. The aim of attenuation is to weaken or eliminate the virulence of viruses without affecting their immunogenicity. Usually a single vaccination is sufficient to induce a high level of immunity. Vaccines against RPV, canine distemper virus (CDV), MeV, and NDV are examples for live attenuated vaccines. The immunological mechanisms underlying the protection from the viruses induced by live vaccine will probably involve a complex interplay between the induced humoral and cell-mediated immunity and immunological memory.
