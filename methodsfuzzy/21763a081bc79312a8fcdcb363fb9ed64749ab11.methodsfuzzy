The efficiency of an RNAi vector is dependent on the cell type and delivery method. There are several well-characterized methods for RNAi delivery, but desired throughput may limit the options available for a particular assay (Table 2) . Lipid delivery methods use a phospholipid bilayer to form a vesicle around the siRNA or shRNA, which fuses with the cell membrane. Lipofection typically has a low level of toxicity, but sensitivity is dependent on the type of reagent used and the cell type being transfected. This method can be used for high-throughput screens. Electroporation delivers an electric pulse to the cells, which results in membrane pores, and the charge of the electric pulse helps to move the nucleotide vector into the cell. Electroporation can cause considerable cell death and requires transfer of the cells between the electroporation device and the plating well. Because of this extra step, this delivery method has limited throughput. Finally, viral vectors can be used for RNAi delivery. Retroviral vectors become integrated into the cellular genome, allowing for stable expression of the delivered shRNA. In contrast, adenoviruses do not incorporate into the genome and are therefore only useful for transient expression. Due to their effectiveness at specifically reducing the expression of target genes, RNAi technologies also have great potential for therapeutic use. However, the delivery of RNAi vectors in vivo is a much greater challenge than delivery to cell lines. Uptake of siRNA or shRNA by target cells in vivo is poor, and the RNAi vectors themselves are often rapidly degraded once they enter the bloodstream. There has been some success in targeting specific organs, such as the liver, but systemic delivery poses additional challenges. There are, however, promising avenues for this type of delivery, including chemical modification of the siRNA or shRNA, cholesterol conjugation, viral vectors, and various polymers (Kanasty et al., 2013) .
