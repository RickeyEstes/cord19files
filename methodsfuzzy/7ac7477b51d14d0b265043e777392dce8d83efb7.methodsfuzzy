Construction of plasmids. The cDNA construct for expressing SARS-CoV 3a protein was obtained from SARS-CoV 2003VA2774, an isolate from a SARS patient in Singapore, as previously described [13] . pXJ3 0 -3a for transient expression in mammalian cells was previously described [13] , while pBacPAK8-3a used for the production of recombinant baculovirus was constructed for this study using the method previously described [22] . Transient transfection of Vero E6 culture and infection with SARS-CoV. Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney epithelial) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured as previously described [13] . SARS-CoV isolate from a SARS patient in China was used to infect Vero E6 cells as previously described [13, 21] . For metabolic labeling, monolayer of cells was infected at multiplicity of infection of 0.1 for 2 h, then starved with methionine (Met) and cysteine (Cys) free medium (DMEM, NEN) for 0.5 h and were then labeled for 12 h by replacing with the medium supplemented with [ 35 S]Met and [ 35 S]Cys (100 Ci/ml, NEN). At approximately 14 h postinfection, the cells showed approximately 50% cytopathic effects (CPE) and the culture supernatant was collected. Lysis buffer was added to the culture supernatant to give a final concentration of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40 (BDH Laboratory Supplies), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.005% SDS (1· lysis buffer). The remaining cells were lysed in 1· lysis buffer. Then both cell lysates and culture supernatant were subjected to immunoprecipitation with rabbit polyclonal anti-3a antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as previously described [13] . The immunocomplexes were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography as previously described [24, 25] . A mock infection was performed in parallel as negative control. For detection of 3a by Western blot analysis, a similar protocol was used except that no metabolic labeling was performed. The cell lysates were subjected to Western blot as previously described [13] . For transient expression of 3a, Vero E6 cells were transfected with pXJ3 0 -3a using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manu-facturerÕs protocol. Primary antibodies for Western blot analysis (anti-3a rabbit polyclonal antibody [13] or anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma)) were used at 1:3000 dilutions. Quantification of autoradiographs was performed using a model Bio-Rad/GS-700 Imaging Densitometer with Bio-Rad Multi-Analyst version 1.02/Mac software. Purification of virions from culture supernatant of SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. In order to obtain purified virion from SARS-CoV infected cells, Vero E6 were infected as described above except that in order to obtain the highest virus titer, the cells were left for 48 h postinfection when the CPE observed was 90%. Then, b-propiolactone was added to infected cell culture to a final concentration of 0.05% to inactivate infectivity. The inactivation was examined by titration of treated samples in Vero E6 cells. The viruses were harvested by freezing/thawing three times and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min. Ultrafiltration was performed to concentrate viruses (300,000 NMWL, Millipore). The concentrated sample was applied to Sepharose 4B fast flow column (Pharmacia) following manufacturerÕs instruction. The eluted fractions were examined by transmission electron microscopy and the fraction containing virus particles was used for Western blot analysis. Insect cell culture and production of recombinant baculoviruses. The Spodoptera frugiperda IPLB-Sf21 (Sf21) insect cell line was cultured as a monolayer in TNM-FH insect medium, containing 8% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum as described previously [26] . It was used for the propagation and infection of recombinant baculoviruses; titers of viruses were determined by a newly developed quantitative real-time PCR-based method [27] . Recombinant baculoviruses carrying the M and E genes were produced in a previous study [22] . Here recombinant baculoviruses carrying the 3a gene were generated using Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) viral genome in a similar manner. Briefly, pBacPAK8-3a was co-transfected with linearized viral DNA (BaculoGold, BD Biosciences) by using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) into insect cells and successful recombinants were isolated by the indication of red fluorescence. The recombinant baculoviruses encoding the E, M, and 3a proteins, assigned as vABhRpE, vABhRpM, and vABhRp3a respectively, were obtained by two-or three-round serial dilutions, and all viral stocks were prepared and manipulated according to the standard protocol described by OÕReilly et al. [28] . Isolation of coronavirus-like particles (VLPs). Sf21 insect cells were co-infected with vABhRpE, vABhRpM, and vABhRp3a at a multiplicity of infection of 1:5:1. At 4 days post-infection, cells were collected by a cell scraper (Costar) and then re-suspended in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (1:1000 dilution, SET III, Calbiochem), and lysed by sonication. The postnuclear supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min and was then placed on a 30% (w/w) sucrose cushion for centrifugation at 34,000 rpm for 20 h. Pellets were washed twice with TBSs resuspended in the same buffer, and then subjected to a 20-60% (w/w) sucrose gradient at 34,000 rpm for 60 h. Twenty-eight fractions, monitored at a wavelength of 280 nm, were extracted from the centrifuged sucrose gradient using a density gradient fractionation system (ISCO). Each fraction of sucrose gradient was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilin-P, Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h and then probed (at a dilution of 1:5000) by antiserum at 4°C overnight. The antibody used to detect the 3a protein has been described previously [13, 29] and was developed by immunizing rabbits with bacterially expressed recombinant proteins. And the antibody for detecting the M protein was purchased from Abgent. The antibody used to detect the E protein has been described previously [22] and was raised by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide. After three washes with 0.1% Tween 20 containing phosphate-buffered saline (TPBS), a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was added at a dilution of 1:2500 for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was then washed with TPBS four times, followed by visualization using chemiluminescent reagent (Western Lightning, Perkin-Elmer) and developed on an X-ray film (BioMax, Kodak).
