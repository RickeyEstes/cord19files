Setup of the ALI culture. The overall setup of the ALI culture for the HK1 cell line has been previously described (25) . Detailed experimental parameters are as follows. A total of 0.5 ϫ 10 6 cells are seeded on thin-coat collagen-coated polyester membrane transwells (Corning) (0.4 m pore size, 12-mm diameter) in 0.5 ml apical medium. Cells are fed from the basolateral surface with 1 ml of media used for the propagation of HK1 cells (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum). Thin-coat collagen is prepared by diluting 0.1 mg/ml stock of fibrous collagen (IV) from human placenta (Sigma) in water supplemented with 200 l glacial acetic acid (100% [vol/vol]), with rocking overnight at 4°C to facilitate solubility. The stock collagen solution is sterile filtered and further diluted 1:10 in 0.1 M Na 2 CO 3 to a working concentration. Collagen stocks can be aliquoted and frozen at Ϫ20°C, but diluted stocks should be made fresh. For a 12-well plate, 250 l of the collagen working stock is used to coat the apical surface of the transwell at 37°C for a minimum of 30 min and up to 1 h. Before the cells are seeded, the collagen solution is aspirated and gently rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). At 1 to 2 days postseeding, a confluent layer should form. The apical medium is removed, and the basolateral medium is replenished. Beginning as early as the next day, a successful ALI culture is established when there is no medium leakage into the apical surface, and that day is noted as day zero. Cells at the ALI are fed twice a week from the basolateral compartment and cultured for up to 3 additional weeks. The uninfected cells should have minimal apical leakage over the 3-week period and should be gently removed at every feeding. The ALI culture of EBV-infected cells increasingly disrupts the monolayer, and apical leakage is expected to increase over the 3-week period, but the integrity of the monolayer should still be apparent by visual inspection with phase microscopy. Analysis of EBV protein induction by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and RNA-seq. The subsequent procedures are described for a 12-well plate transwell configuration. At weekly intervals, protein lysates were harvested. The basolateral media and apical leakage were removed. Cells were gently rinsed once in PBS and lysed in 50 l of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM activated sodium orthovanadate, and a 1:100 dilution of protease and phosphate inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). The cells were lysed directly in the transwell by rocking at 4°C for 30 min followed by scraping and were clarified at Ն20,000 ϫ g for 5 min at 4°C. Protein concentration, separation by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed as previously described (25) . Antibodies for immunoblotting were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (EBV zebra clone BZ1; EaD clone 0261; filaggrin clone AKH1; HSC70 clone B-6), Thermo Scientific (EBV VCA p18; keratin 10 clone Ab-2), and Sigma (involucrin clone SY5). For immunofluorescence staining, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and punched out of the transwell with the lid of a cryovial (or by the use of the top end of a P1000 tip cut to the size of the transwell). The use of a scalpel is not recommended since this can wrinkle the membrane and create an uneven surface for imaging. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 -PBS for 5 min and washed in wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 -PBS) followed by blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin-PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were probed with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber. Following three rinses in wash buffer, cells were incubated with secondary antibody diluted in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. For EBV zebra (clone BZ1), EaD (clone 0261), and gp350 (clone 0221) stains, all primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were diluted 1:100. EBV zebra and EaD were detected with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 3.75 g/ml. EBV gp350 was detected with biotin-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG diluted at 3 g/ml and rhodamine red-conjugated streptavidin at 0.78 g/ml (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were counterstained in DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and mounted in aqueous mounting media. Epifluorescence images were acquired on an Olympus Provis microscope with Q-Capture software. All images were adjusted for equal levels of intensity and brightness. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) from HK1-EBV cells after induction of the lytic cycle at the indicated time points (week 0, week 1, week 2, and week 3). Briefly, cells were lysed in 1 ml of Trizol, purified with chloroform, precipitated with isopropanol followed by two washes of 75% ethanol, and resuspended in water. DNase-treated RNA (Turbo DNA-free kit; Ambion) was submitted to the Health Sciences Sequencing Core at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh for quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) analysis and quantitation on an Agilent TapeStation and Qubit. rRNA is susceptible to degradation during EBV reactivation; therefore, the expected RNA integrity number (RIN) can range from 2.4 to 5.5, with an expected total RNA yield in the range of 0.2 to 7 g per ALI culture sample, decreasing as reactivation progresses. A more accurate measure of transcript integrity should be determined by the percentage of nucleotide fragments larger than 200 bp or by Northern blotting for intact EBV transcripts such as the abundant nonpolyadenylated EBERs. Following QA/QC analysis, DNase-treated RNA samples were subjected to rRNA depletion using a Ribo-Zero Epidemiology kit (Illumina) and were converted into a deep sequencing library using Illumina's Truseq stranded total RNA kit. Deep sequencing was performed on a NextSeq500 platform using a Mid-output kit and a 2 ϫ 75-cycle paired-end run. We obtained 47.1, 49.4, 46.9, and 47.7 million reads An ALI Method To Study EBV Pathogenesis for samples at week 0, week 1, week 2, and week 3, respectively. Sequence reads were trimmed by 10 nucleotides based on read quality and subsequently aligned to the EBV Akata genome (GenBank accession number KC207813.1) or to human reference genome hg38 using TopHat2 (58) and the options "-no-novel-juncs -r 300 -library-type fr-firststrand." Among the total reads, 0.4%, 0.2%, 0.8%, and 0.8% aligned to the EBV genome for sample week 0, week 1, week 2, and week 3, respectively; the alignment rates for hg38 were 82.7%, 84.1%, 80.0%, and 82.2%, respectively. To generate a heat map of EBV transcript abundance, Cufflinks (59) was used to calculate FPKM values of EBV genes, which were then applied to the heatmap.2 tool in the gplots package (60). For analyzing differential host gene expression, the algorithm CuffDiff2 (61) was used to compare week 0 transcriptomes and week 3 transcriptomes with the options "-library-type fr-firststrand-compatiblehits-norm-max-bundle-frags 1000000000000." Table S3 in the supplemental material includes data from host genes that exhibited a 2-fold change between the week 0 and week 3 samples. Analysis of EBV DNA genome replication by qPCR and Southern blotting. Cells were harvested by scraping in 100 l of PBS followed by three cycles of rapid freezing-thawing to release virions. Cellular debris was pelleted at Ն20,000 ϫ g for 5 min, and the supernatant was harvested and split for subsequent experiments performed with or without DNase treatment. Half of the sample was treated with a Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion) to isolate encapsidated genomes. Both the samples subjected to DNase treatment and those left untreated were subjected to Hirt purification for isolation of extrachromosomal EBV genomes (22) . For every 25-l sample, 415 l Hirt buffer, 5 l of 20 mg/ml proteinase K, and 25 l of 10% SDS were added and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. This was followed by phenol-chloroform extraction (470 l phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol [25:24:1]) and separation into the aqueous phase by spinning at Ն20,000 ϫ g for 10 min, followed by washing the aqueous layer with 470 l of chloroform and collecting the aqueous layer by spinning at Ն20,000 ϫ g for 10 min. DNA was precipitated with 0.1ϫ 3 M sodium acetate and 2.5ϫ 100% ethanol and was incubated overnight at Ϫ20°C. To pellet DNA, samples were spun at Ն20,000 ϫ g for 10 min at 4°C, washed with 300 l 70% ethanol, and pelleted again at Ն20,000 ϫ g for 10 min at 4°C. The DNA pellet was air dried and resuspended in 12.5 l of water. Of note, it would also be possible to perform the qPCR procedure using column-purified total genomic DNA and normalization to a cellular target but the procedure would need to be empirically optimized for sensitivity and template quantity. For qPCR, 2 l of the Hirt-purified DNA was analyzed by the Sybr green absolute quantitation method. A standard curve was generated with 10 0 to 10 9 copies per reaction using a BALF5 plasmid (7,782 bp) as the template (62) . Reaction mixtures were assembled with a Maxima SYBR green qPCR master mix kit (Thermo Scientific) with 0.3 M of each primer, using recommended cycle conditions with ROX as a passive reference dye in a total reaction volume of 10 l. Primer sequences are as follows: for qBALF5-F, 5= GAGCGATCTTGGCAATCTCT 3=; for qBALF5-R, 5= TGGTCATGGATCTGCTAAACC 3=. Reactions were amplified on a StepOnePlus instrument (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed with StepOne software (v2.3). Average values and standard deviations were calculated from triplicate technical replicas and three independent experiments. Water and uninfected HK1 ALI culture cells from corresponding weeks were used as negative controls. End values were represented as BALF5 copy number per ALI culture. For Southern blotting, total genomic DNA was harvested from Trizol-lysed cells or could also be harvested by column purification (GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit with RNase treatment; Thermo Scientific). Total DNA was isolated from the nonaqueous phase according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The DNA harvested from each ALI culture was digested with BamHI, ethanol precipitated in the presence of 5 to 10 g of glycogen, and loaded on an agarose gel. A linearized Xho1a (1.9-kb) probe was generated by random-prime synthesis, radiolabeled, and hybridized as previously described (63) . Measuring EBV titers. Residual media on the apical side were collected. Intracellular and extracellular virus was harvested by scraping cells in 100 l of RPMI media followed by an additional 50-l rinse and was collected to reach a total volume of 200 l. The sample was clarified by spinning at 500 ϫ g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected and stored at 4°C as extracellular virus. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 l of RPMI media followed by three cycles of rapid freezing-thawing to release intracellular virus. Disrupted cells were spun down at 500 ϫ g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected and stored at 4°C as cell-associated virus. Infectious titer was determined by the green Raji Unit (GRU) assay (50) . In a 96-well plate, 90 l of RPMI medium was added to 10 l of virus stock and titrated in 10-fold serial dilutions (10 0 to 10 9 ). Ten thousand Raji cells in 10 l media were added to each well and, after a 48-h inoculation period, reactivated with 200 nM TPA and 5 mM sodium butyrate overnight. A fluorescence microscope was used to count the number of GFP-positive cells in each well to determine the number of GRU per milliliter. TEM. HK1 and HK1-EBV ALI cultures harvested at week 2 were fixed in cold 2.5% glutaraldehyde-0.01 M PBS. Specimens were rinsed in PBS, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide with 1% potassium ferricyanide, rinsed in PBS, dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, and embedded in Poly/Bed 812 (Luft formulations). Semithin (300-nm-thick) sections were cut on a Leica Reichart Ultracut ultramicrotome, stained with 0.5% toluidine blue-1% sodium borate, and examined under the light microscope. Ultrathin sections (65 nm thick) were stained with uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate and examined on a JEOL 1011 transmission electron microscope with a side-mount AMT 2-k digital camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques).
