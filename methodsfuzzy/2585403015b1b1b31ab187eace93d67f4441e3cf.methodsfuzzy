The selected metagenomics classification workflows consist of up to five different steps: pre-process, filter, assembly, search and post-process ( Figure 1A ). Only three workflows (SRSA, Isakov et al., 2011 , Exhaustive Iterative Assembly, Sch√ºrch et al., 2014 , and VIP, Li et al., 2016 incorporated all of these steps. All workflows minimally included a "search" step ( Figure 1B , Table 4 ), as this was an inclusion criterion. The order in which the steps are performed varies between workflows and in some workflows steps are performed multiple times. Workflows are often combinations of existing (open source) software, while sometimes, custom solutions are made. For 17 workflows for which these data were available, we looked for correlations by plotting performance scores against the analysis steps included (Figure 3) . Workflows that included a pre-processing or assembly step scored higher in sensitivity, specificity and precision. Contrastingly, workflows with postprocessing on average scored lower on all measures. Pipelines that filter non-viral reads generally had a lower sensitivity and specificity and precision remained high. Next, we visualized correlations between the used search algorithms and the runtime, and the performance scores (Figure 4 ). Different search algorithms had different performance scores on average. Similarity search methods had lower sensitivity, but higher specificity and precision than composition search. The use of nucleotide vs. amino acid search also affected performance. Amino acid sequences generally led to higher sensitivity and lower specificity and precision scores. Combining nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences in the analysis seemed to provide the best results. Performance was generally higher for workflows that used more time. Finally, we inventoried the overall runtime of 17 workflows ( Table 5 ) and separated them based on the inclusion of analysis steps that seemed to affect runtime. This indicated that workflows that included pre-processing, filtering, and similarity search by alignment were more time-consuming than workflows that did not use these analysis steps.
