Design of head-only RSV F immunogens The amino acid sequence of RSV F subtype A, strain A2, with DS-Cav1 mutations S155C, S190F, V207L, and S290C [16] , was used a starting point for each design. All designs included both a His-tag and a Strep-tag for use in purification and antibody-binding assays.
