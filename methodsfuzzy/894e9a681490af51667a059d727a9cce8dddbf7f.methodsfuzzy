Cell lines, sera, and reagents. BHK21-15 and Vero T144 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Omega Scientific), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), and 10 mM nonessential amino acids (Cellgro) at 37°C. C6/36 Aedes albopictus mosquito cells were grown in Leibovitz-15 (Sigma) medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 mM HEPES at 25°C. Fresh human blood samples were collected in glass tubes and allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes. After centrifugation (830 ϫ g) for 10 minutes at 4°C, sera were aliquoted and frozen at Ϫ80°C. Serum samples were thawed on the day of analysis. Sera from wild-type C57BL/6 mice and congenic complement- Ϫ/Ϫ , fB Ϫ/Ϫ , and fD Ϫ/Ϫ ) and antibody-deficient (RAG1 Ϫ/Ϫ ) mice were obtained as previously described (25) . Enzon Pharmaceuticals provided the purified recombinant human MBL (27) as a generous gift. Blood samples from subjects in the United States were obtained with informed consent and approval by the Washington University institutional review board. Some human samples were obtained in Denmark from anonymous blood donors with informed consent according to the Danish law of blood donation. C6/36 cell-derived DENV-1, -3, and -4 were preincubated with 2% (vol/vol) wild-type mouse serum in the presence or absence of mannan (100 g/ml). The virus was added to Vero cells, and infectivity was determined 48 hours (for DENV-1 and -4) or 60 hours (for DENV-3) later by a focus-forming assay. Neutralization was calculated based on reduction of the number of foci in a given condition compared to the value in heat-inactivated (HI) serum. Error bars indicate SEM for 5 or 6 independent experiments performed in duplicate. (B) C6/36 cell-derived DENV-1, -3, and -4 were incubated with purified human MBL (3 g/ml) in the presence or absence of mannan (100 g/ml) prior to addition to a monolayer of Vero cells. Data are presented as percent neutralization (percent reduction of the number of foci compared to the value in buffer alone) in a given condition. Error bars indicate SEM for 5 independent experiments performed in duplicate. (C) C6/36 cell-derived DENV-1, -3, and -4 were preincubated with 10% (vol/vol) naïve human serum (donor 1 or donor 2) in the absence or presence of 1 M mannose or 1.36 g/ml purified human MBL. Neutralization was calculated based on reduction of the number of foci compared to the value in heat-inactivated (HI) serum. Error bars indicate SEM for 5 independent experiments performed in duplicate. Values that are significantly different are indicated by brackets and asterisks as follows: *, P Ͻ 0.05; **, P Ͻ 0.01; ***, P Ͻ 0.001. MBL genotyping. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region at positions Ϫ550 (H/L variants) and Ϫ221 (X/Y variants), in the 5= noncoding region at position ϩ4 (P/Q variants) and in codons 54 (allele B), 57 (allele C), and 52 (allele D) in exon 1 of the MBL2 gene were identified as previously described (52) . Virus stocks. DENV serotype 1 (DENV-1) (16007), serotype 2 (DENV-2) (16681), serotype 3 (DENV-3) (UNC 3043), serotype 4 (DENV-4) (1036), and WNV (New York 1999) were propagated in C6/36 or Vero cells to generate insect cell-or mammalian cell-derived virus stock, respectively. In some experiments, DENV-2 was cultured in freshly isolated human peripheral blood monocytes or monocyte-derived dendritic cells as previously described (53) . Virus neutralization. DENV-2 or WNV (10 2 PFU of DENV-2; 10 3 PFU of WNV) was incubated with naïve mouse or human serum (fresh or heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 min) or purified recombinant human MBL diluted in gelatin veronal buffer with Mg 2ϩ and Ca 2ϩ (GVB ϩϩ ; Complement Technology) for 1 h at 37°C. Samples were added to a monolayer of BHK21-15 cells and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were washed, overlaid with 1% low-melting-point agarose (SeaPlaque; Lonza) in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 4% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and cultured for 3 (WNV) or 4 (DENV-2) days at 37°C. Following formaldehyde (10%) fixation and crystal violet staining, plaques were scored visually. For studies with DENV-1, -3, and -4, 10 2 to 10 3 focus-forming units (FFU) of virus were incubated with serum or purified recombinant human MBL for 1 h at 37°C as described above. Samples were added to a monolayer of Vero cells and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were washed and overlaid with 1% methylcellulose mixed with DMEM containing 5% FBS and incubated for 48 (DENV-1 and -4) or 60 (DENV-3) hours. Monolayers were washed thrice with PBS to remove methylcellulose, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature, rinsed, and permeabilized in Perm Wash (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], 0.1% saponin, and 0.1% BSA). Infected-cell foci were stained by incubating cells with the flavivirus crossreactive MAb WNV-E18 (54) (1 g/ml) and quantitated as described previously (34) . In some experiments, viruses were incubated with serum or MBL in the presence or absence of 100 g/ml mannan or 1 M mannose prior to the addition to cells. MBL-DENV capture ELISA. MBL binding to DENV was evaluated using a virus capture ELISA with MAb-coated wells on microtiter plates as described previously (25) with the following modifications: the wells on microtiter plates were adsorbed with an anti-DENV prM protein-specific MAb 2H2 (55) or an isotype control (IgG2a) anti-hepatitis C virus E2 MAb H77.16 (56) (10 g/ml in PBS) at 4°C overnight. DENV-2 stocks were diluted in DMEM to 5 ϫ 10 5 PFU/ml and added to wells. The wells on the plates were washed and then incubated with increasing concentrations of purified human recombinant MBL diluted in binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% [wt/vol] BSA, 1 M NaCl, and 10 mM CaCl 2 ). The wells on the plates were washed, incubated sequentially with biotin-conjugated mouse anti-human MBL MAb (Cedarlane), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin, and developed with 3,3=,5,5=-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (DAKO). The optical density (OD) at 450 nm was determined by a 96-well plate reader (Genio Pro; Tecan Instruments). In some experiments, captured DENV-2 was incubated with human serum (1:4 dilution) instead of purified recombinant human MBL. For a negative control, purified human MBL was diluted in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mM NaCl supplemented with 40 mM EDTA or supplemented with 100 g/ml mannan. In parallel experiments, captured DENV virions were detected by biotinylated anti-DENV E-protein-specific MAb 4G2 (55) (1 g/ml), followed by HRP-conjugated streptavidin (2 g/ml). MBL ELISA. The levels of MBL in serum were measured using an MBL oligomer ELISA kit (BioPorto, Gentofte, Denmark) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hemolysis assay for serum C4. Serial dilutions of serum and purified C4 (Complement Technology) were prepared in DGVB ϩϩ (2.5 mM Bar-bital sodium, 139 mM dextrose, 71 mM NaCl, 0.1% [wt/vol] gelatin, 0.15 mM CaCl 2 , and 1 mM MgCl 2 ). Ten microliters of diluted serum or a C4 standard was added to a tube containing 476 l DGVB ϩϩ , 11 l of antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes (EA) (5 ϫ 10 8 cells/ml) (Complement Technology), and 3 l of C4-deficient guinea pig serum (Complement Technology). The tubes were incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C and then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 830 ϫ g. The OD of the supernatant was measured at 414 nm. C4 concentrations were calculated from a standard curve. CH50 assay. The amount of hemolytic complement in serum was measured by the method of Giclas (57) to obtain the CH50 values. Statistical analysis. Data sets were compared using a two-tailed, unpaired t test. Multiple comparisons were performed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Correlation coefficients were estimated based on the Pearson product-moment correlation using Prism software (Graph-Pad Software). Statistical significance was achieved when P values were Ͻ0.05.
