Sera and CSFs were collected from 46 MS patients and frozen at Ϫ80°C until utilized. Patients' sex, age, and clinical features of disease are summarized in Table 1 . All the MS subjects had a definite diagnosis of relapsingremitting MS according to the criteria of Poser et al. [26] . In 35 of 46 MS patients sera and CSF were collected within 30 days from the onset of a clinical relapse, defined as the appearance of a new symptom or the worsening of an old one, accompanied by an appropriate neurologic abnormality lasting at least 24 h in the absence of fever, and preceded by a period of stability or improvement of at least 30 days. All MS patients did not assume steroids or immunosuppressive drugs. CSF analysis showed an increased immunoglobulin (Ig) G index in 80% of cases and the presence of oligoclonal bands at isoelectrofocusing in 95% of cases. Sera and CSFs of 29 OND patients (Table 2 ) affected by diseases such as epilepsy, headache, psychiatric disorders, without clinical, laboratory (CSF examination including IgG index), and neuroradiologic (computerized tomography) evidences of organic involvement of CNS, were also collected and frozen as specified. The sera of 20 healthy subjects were used as controls.
