Thirty-eight men were studied, 18 in Edinburgh and 20 in London. All had 'chronic or recurrent mucopurulent obstructive bronchitis', as defined by the MRC (1965) . Patients with bronchiectasis, arrested pulmonary tuberculosis or other disease causing widespread lung damage were excluded from the study. No patient admitted to the study was taking long-term prophylactic antibiotics. Patients were excluded if their forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV0 increased by more than 30% within 20 minutes of two inhalations of salbutamol aerosol. The mean FEV1 of the 38 patients on recruitment was 1.40 litres (SD 0.59 litre). After salbutamol, FEV1 increased by less than 10% in 29 patients and by 11-29% in eight others. In the remaining patient FEV1 increased by 33% but, because the absolute increase was only 0.20 litre from a resting value of 0.60 litre and also because he was a typical bronchitic in all other respects, he was retained in the study. Of the 38 patients 20 either had previously received a trial of prednisolone (at least 20 mg a day for two weeks) or were given such a trial on the completion of the study; in none was there any improvement in daily measurements of peak expiratory flow (PEF). At the beginning of the study 29 (76%) of the 38 patients were aged 60-69 years, the other nine being aged 44-54 years. 26 patients were currently smoking, of whom three stopped during the study. Nine (24%) of the patients' households contained children. The study covered the period January 1975 to April 1977 and included two complete winters. Four patients were withdrawn; one because of the development of carcinoma of the bronchus and three because they proved uncooperative. One patient moved to another district and was lost to follow-up. Two patients died during the survey (one from carcinoma of the oesophagus and one from myocardial infarction). Data obtained from these seven patients during the periods in which they were followed up have been included in the analysis. A detailed history was taken to ensure that patients fulfilled the criteria of the MRC definition of chronic or recurrent mucopurulent obstructive bronchitis and that they had no other respiratory condition which would have excluded them from the study. Patients attended every four weeks for routine review. Enquiry was made about any change in their symptoms or smoking habits during the previous four weeks. They were asked to notify the coordinators as soon as they began a head cold or throat infection or if they considered that their habitual symptoms of expectoration or breathlessness had increased in severity. They were seen as soon as possible after the receipt of this notification, and were questioned about the following symptoms: coryza, sore throat, hoarseness, increased cough, increased wheeze, increased sputum and a change in colour of sputum to green or yellow. An exacerbation was deemed to have occurred if a patient reported either an increase of cough or wheeze or a change in sputum colour, plus at least one other item on the above list, or an increase in sputum volume (whether or not it was accompanied by anything else on this list). At every routine attendance the following specimens were obtained: (a) an early morning specimen of sputum ; (b) nasal and pharyngeal swabs ; and (c) a specimen of blood. In exacerbations the same specimens were obtained and an additional blood specimen was taken two to three weeks later. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs were placed in a bijou bottle containing virus transport medium (Hanks' BSS with 0.2% bovine albumen, ampicillin 200 ~g/ml, and penicillin 150 international units/ml) and were kept at 4Â°C until delivered to the laboratory. Sputum specimens were collected in sterile containers and were stored at room temperature. Whenever possible, specimens were delivered to the laboratory on the same day, but occasionally they had to be stored overnight. The laboratory methods used in Edinburgh and London were identical and are described below.
