Protein samples were analyzed by performing electrophoresis on a 12% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel. For the immunodetection of the His-tag-fused scFv proteins, a monoclonal anti-His antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Sigma-Aldrich) was used. An ECL kit (Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent, GE Healthcare) was used for signal detection.
