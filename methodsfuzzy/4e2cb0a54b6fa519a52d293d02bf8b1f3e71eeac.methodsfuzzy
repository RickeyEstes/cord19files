The first successful example of using the web for public health purposes dates back to 2003, when, in The Netherlands and Belgium, a Dutch scientific communication project was initiated by the small company Science in Action. The purpose was to inform the general population about influenza by means of a self-reporting Internet platform in Dutch (http://www.degrotegriepmeting.nl), where volunteers in The Netherlands and Belgium (the Flemish part) could answer socio-demographic, medical and behavioural questions, and report their influenzarelated symptoms each week. User participation was achieved through targeted communication and recruitment. A positive side effect of this project was the collection of almost real-time data about influenza, including from individuals who did not visit a doctor when ill. Knowledge of volunteers' postal codes allowed the real-time collection of data at the postal code level. Thanks to a vigorous communication campaign using both online and offline media, the project attracted 20 000 users during this first season. The possibility of collecting such detailed data about influenza cases from such a wide audience attracted the interest of the Gulbenkian Institute of Science Epidemiology group in Portugal, who implemented their own platform in Portuguese, and deployed the system at the beginning of the 2005 influenza season (http://www.gripenet.pt). In Portugal, during the first 2 years of the project, approximately 5000 volunteers were attracted [3] . On the basis of this success, the computational epidemiology group of the ISI Foundation in Turin, Italy decided to deploy a similar platform during the winter of 2007, to carry out influenza surveillance with the aim of informing computational models for studying the spread of ILI on a large scale. Data collected by these four platforms have been evaluated [3, 4] (Paolotti et al., 3rd International ICST Conference on Electronic Healthcare for the 21st Century, 2010, Abstract no. 30), and the estimated seasonal influenza incidence curves have been found to be in good agreement with those from the former European Influenza Surveillance Scheme. Since 2009, the four Internet-based monitoring systems have formed the foundation of a European-wide network of platforms that became the key instrument for providing real-time disease incidence for the epidemic forecast infrastructure developed by the EU-funded research project EPIWORK (http://www.epiwork.eu). The proposed network of web platforms, called Influenzanet (http://www.influenzanet. eu), saw, for the first time, the collaboration of epidemiologists, public health practitioners and modellers with the aim of collecting epidemiological data in real time through the contributions of Internet volunteers self-selected from among the general population. The epidemiology teams devised reference standard questionnaires for different diseases to collect unified data across European countries (presented in the supporting information). ILI has been the focus in the early deployment of the system, but the final goal is to considerably enlarge the portfolio of diseases and health conditions monitored. In June 2009, the plans to export the platform to other European countries were accelerated by the unfolding of the H1N1 pandemic in the northern hemisphere. A web system very similar to the Italian platform was rapidly deployed in the UK (https://flusurvey.org.uk/) to capture the whole progress of the H1N1 pandemic, with the involvement of the mathematical modelling group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. This work allowed researchers to detect the differences in healthcare-seeking behaviour between different population groups and changes over time, with significant implications for estimates of total case numbers and the case-fatality rate [5, 6] . The extension of the web platform in each country represented a separate scientific challenge and research problem, as the countries have different population stratifications and geographical distributions. The Influenzanet prototypical web platform implementation had to take into account these differences and design specific mapping/representation solutions, as well as find the optimal granularity for the data acquisition and statistical sampling in the different countries. It also had to provide easy management of content, news, and info-graphics, and provide a user-friendly interface for the volunteers to access the surveys aimed at collecting epidemiological data. The data collection revolves around two main surveys: a background survey and a symptoms survey. The background questionnaire is completed at registration, and contains questions about the user's postal code, gender, birth date, household, level of education, employment, chronic health conditions, smoking habits, etc. The symptoms questionnaire is a weekly survey with a list of symptoms that the users employ to describe their health status. The platform is equipped with a 'Reminder', i.e. a weekly email sent to users to remind them to fill in the symptoms survey. These features were included in a plug-and-play implementation to lessen the burden of deploying the platform in new countries, and to let the local teams concentrate on the communication and dissemination needed to attract participants, instead of having to deal with technical problems. The new Influenzanet system started to be deployed in October 2010. The localization, translation, testing and fine-tuning activities took place between October 2010 and February 2011. This powerful and flexible new platform has been successfully adopted by all of the 'old' countries (The Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, the UK, and Italy), and, thanks to its plug-and-play features, it was deployed, in December 2011, in Sweden by the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control, and by the Institut National de la Sant e et de la Recherche M edicale in France. In both cases, in <2 months, the platform saw the enrolment of several thousands of participants from all over the country. The system has since been successfully deployed in Spain at the Instituto de Biocomputacion y F Ä±sica de Sistemas Complejos, at the University of Saragoza, in September 2012, in Denmark at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, and in Ireland at the College of Engineering & Informatics, National University of Ireland, Galway in August 2013. All of the national platforms upload their data to a centralized database, which provides uniform epidemiological real-time data from >50 000 volunteers in ten European countries.
