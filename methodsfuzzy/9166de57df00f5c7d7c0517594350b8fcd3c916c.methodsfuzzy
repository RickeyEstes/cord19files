The clinical VTEC strain isolated from 4-year-old child suffering from HUS was incubated with ampicillin/ sulbactam, meropenem, cefepime, piperaciline, piperacilline/ tazobactam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicine, amikacin, ciprofloxacine and trimethoprime/sulfamethoxazole using dilution method. After 2 h and 4 h incubation, the verotoxin was separated and the presence of verotoxin was confirmed by ELISA with monoclonal antibodies against verotoxin2. We used t-test for statistical analysis. Results: Based on ELISA tests, we have not found any significant increase or decrease of verotoxin release after 2 h incubation. However, after 4 h incubation we have found that ciprofloxacin (p < 0.05) significantly induced the production of verotoxin 2 and verotoxin release from clinical VTEC strain was significantly decreased by meropenem and amikacine (p < 0.05) compared with clinical VTEC strain incubated without antibiotics. Conclusions: Antimicrobial drugs play role not only as inhibitors of the bacterial growth but some of them can activate the production of important virulence factors. Therefore, it is important not only isolation of VTEC from HUS patients but also detection of the influence of antibiotics used for prophylaxis in hospitals to verotoxin production of isolated strain. The clinical isolate of S. aureus with the highest adhesive capacity was selected in the model of it's co-incubation with the target cells in culture. The inoculums was prepared at a baseline concentration of 108 cfu/ml after 24 h grown on meatpeptone agar. The antiadhesive activity of the normal human immunoglobulin (NHI), Intraglobin and Pentaglobin at a baseline concentration of 20 lg/ml was assessed. The estimation of the influence of the agents under investigation on the bacterial adhesion process was performed on the above mentioned model of co-incubation of microorganism and the target-cells in culture as well as using 1 h pre-incubation with agents to be tested. Also the experiments were held in the presence Protein A from the staphylococcus cell wall as well as clostridial collagenasum and animal hyaluronidasum. The intensity of bacterial adhesion and antiadhesive properties of used compounds were expressed as following indices: Index of adhesion (IA) calculated as mean number of attached microbes per one eukaryotic cell; Percent of affected cells of the monolayer (AC%); Microbial contamination of the monolayer (MC) obtained as a product of IA•AC%; Percent of inhibition of bacterial adhesion (II%) calculated from the figures of IA with respect to the control. Results: All preparations revealed more or less significant inherent antiadhesive activity in vitro, which became apparent in the reduction of all indices characterizing colonization of target-cells. Most effective proved to be the preparations with 1 hour preincubation with clinical isolate of S. aureus which protected fibroblasts against the bacterial adhesion in more than 92% in this case. Conclusion: The protective effect of NHI and Intraglobin disappeared with addition of Protein A, collagenasum or hyaluronidasum to nutrient medium but remained the same for Pentaglobin. According to its specific polymeric structure and prospective form as well as content of IgM Pentaglobin possesses much more antiadhesive activity in the presence of Protein A, collagenasum or hyaluronidasum. In the presence of Protein A and enzymes IgM makes the antiadhesive activity of Pentaglobin irreversible. The 126 isolated strains were tested for susceptibility to various antibiotics and those resistant to ofloxacin were tested for point mutations in the gyr A gene using single strand conformational polymorphism analysis ( SSCP, and by sequencing in 2 selected strains. Results: Twenty-eight (22.2%) out of the 126 isolates were resistant to ofloxacin. Point mutation in gyrA gene was not detected in any of the 28 quinolone resistant strains by SSCP. However, by direct sequencing of the PCR-amplified gyrA fragment from two clinical isolates, single mutation in which, threonine at position 83 was substituted by an isoleucine, was detected in both cases. Cells attached to surfaces in biofilms can be more tolerant to various anti-microbial agents than their planktonic counterparts. In biofilm environments the cells have the ability to differentiate and change phenotype leading to severe treatment problems in many cases of persistent or chronic infections. An approach addressing this issue identified specific resistant subpopulations in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and indicated that differentiation plays an important role in this context. Biofilms were established in flow-chambers, and their development and responses to addition of colistin (a polymyxin) were monitored by confocal scanning laser microscopy and time-lapse recording together with use of live/dead staining. Initial results indicate that modification of LPS is an important factor in relation to colistin tolerance development and may be the initiator of cell differentiation as pmr mutant biofilms of PAO1 result in sensitivity to colistin.Results indicated furthermore a regulatory connection between the composition of the cell envelope and cell motility (twitching, swarming) and in that way a correlation between motility and tolerance to anti-microbial agents. Tube biofilm experiments were set up for isolation of colistin treated and non treated biofilm material and further analysis of changes happening in the differentiating population by use of micro Array and LPS analysis. Epidemiology of resistance, antibiotic usage and oxacillin 26 (20.2%); followed by lincosamides (lincomycin) 17 (13.2%), aminoglycosides 8 (6.3%). To notice, aminoglycosides were prescribed to 51 (17.0%) of all patients who received antibiotics. Body weight was determined in 6 (11.8%) and serum creatinine was measured in 37 (72.5%) of patients receiving aminoglycosides. Among prevailing combinations were gentamicin plus oxacillin 12 (14.6%), lincomycin and oxacillin 11 (13.4%), metronidazole and ciprofloxacin 5 (6.1%), and ampicillin plus gentamicin 5 (6.1%) of cases. In total, aminoglycosides for a combination therapy were administered in 43 (52.4%) of patients. Conclusion: Penicillins remain most often prescribed antibiotics for monotherapy and in combination with aminoglycosides. However surgeons often omit safety recommendations of administration of aminoglycosides. Further strategies to improve safety issues of antimicrobial therapy in surgery should be implemented. Methods: The 14th survey of external programme for 2004 distributed to 532 laboratories in Tehran. The selected microorganisms were: Shigella flexneri, Sreptococcus agalactiae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. S. flexneri were sent to all 532, S. agalactia to 395, and S. maltophilia to 137 microbiology laboratories. We asked all laboratories for identification each unknown organism, performance of susceptibility testing for S. flexneri and return their answer to reference laboratory within 2 weeks receipt of samples. Scoring of results determined according to WHO external surveys criteria. Results: Of 532 laboratories we received answer from 428 (80.5%) laboratories. Of 428 laboratories 205 (38.5%) produced correct answer for identification of S. flexneri and received 3 score of points. and 31(5.8%) laboratories produced incorrect answer for identification of this organism. The remaining 192 (36.1%) laboratories received 1-2 score of points (mean score 2.2, SD ± 0.91). Of 137 labs only 11(8%) labs produced correct answer for identification of S. maltophilia and 66 (48.2%) labs received zero score of points. The remaining labs 23 (16.8%) received 1-2.5 score of points (mean score 81, SD ± 1.13). Of 395 labs 146 (37%) identified S. agalactiae correctly and obtained 3 score of points and 32 (8.15) were not able to identify this organism and therefore received 0 score of points The reaming laboratories 137( 36%) obtained 1-2.5 score of points (mean sore 2, SD ± 1.1). The results of susceptibility testing were satisfied and the majority of laboratories produced correct answer for susceptibility testing of S. flexneri (mean score 4.52). It is assumed that the result of external quality control in Tehran microbiology laboratories was not acceptable. Conclusion: Our study reveals that unfortunately proficiency testing in microbiology laboratories of Tehran is poor .The poor results were due to: defective reagents, l culture media inappropriate settlement of internal quality control programme and of unqualified technologists. Methods: In an analytic study 232 patients with gastrointestinal signs were studied. Endocopy was done and 2-3 biopsies were taken from antrum. Specimens were processed by shandon tissue processor (citadel) and prepared sections were stained by Hematoxylin-Eosin and Giemsa. Slides were studied by two pathologist and one microbiologist. Also 5 cc blood was taken to determine anti HP (IgG) by ELISA method. Objective: Campylobacter spp. are recognized as a major cause of acute bacterial enteritis in the developed countries. Several potential virulence factors have been proposed as important factors in the pathogenesis of Campylobacter jejuni e.g. motility, adherence, invasion and toxin production. The only toxin of C. jejuni characterized at the molecular level is the cytolethal distending toxin (CDT); cdt genes have also been found in various other Gram negative bacteria. The aim of this study was to examine whether the level of CDT expressed had any impact on the clinical outcome in patients infected with C jejuni. Methods: The levels of CDT expressed by 30 clinical C. jejuni isolates, from patients with campylobacteriosis, were determined using a HeLa cell assay. The presence of the three CDT coding genes, cdtA, cdtB and cdtC was tested in these isolates by PCR. The presence and titres of serum neutralizing antibodies to CDT in the corresponding patient serum was also measured. Clinical data were obtained from these patients using a standardised questionnaire. A 17 year-old female was admitted in our hospital for fever, headache, loss of weight and progressive disability to walk. She presented: fever, later cervical lymphadenopathy and the objective neurological signs were: coma, nuchal rigidity, Kernig signs were positive, lack of abdominal cutaneous reflexes and osteotendinous reflexes, paraplegia, convergent strabismus. We performed: CT brain scan, routine hematological and chemical tests, chest X-ray, lumbar puncture, CSF culture, blood culture. Results: CT brain scan revealed cerebral edema. Objectives: The increasing incidence of tuberculosis and multidrug resistance (MDR) among Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains remains one of the major public health problems in Poland. The geographical position of Lublin means that potentially MDR strains from former Soviet Union countries are more likely to be present. Rapid detection of MDR can optimize the efficacy of antituberculosis therapy and control their transmission. The aim of the study was to compare current methods of drug susceptibility testing with two molecular assays. Methods: The Inno-Lipa Rif. TB was applied to detect mutations in rpoB gene conferring rifampicin resistance and a noncommercial low-density macroarray (MDRTB screening array) detecting mutations in rpoB and kat G, inh A genes responsible for rifampicin and isoniazid resistance, respectively. Differentiation of M. tuberculosis complex species was confirmed using biochemical analyses, niacin accumulation test and spoligotyping based on polymorphism of the chromosomal direct repeats (DR) locus, which contains a variable number of short DR interspersed with non-repetitive spacers. Results: 18 MDR strains cultured from patients with pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis in the laboratory of Public Hospital were subjected to susceptibility testing for rifampicin and isoniazid by the resistance ratio method on L-J medium. All these strains were analysed by the Inno-Lipa Rif, MDRTB screening array and spoligotyping. Phenotypic testing established that 17 of 18 isolates were rifampicin and isoniazid resistant using the resistance ratio method -Ôthe gold standardÕ to compare with. Objectives: To evaluate the performance of BacT/ALERT 3D (bioMerieux, France) for isolating of mycobacteria in comparison with the Lö wenstein-Jensen medium. Additionally, a series of studies were conducted to detect the sensitivity of p-nitrobenzoic acid test for differentiation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex with other mycobacteria at Social Security Institute Sureyyapasa Chest Disease Hospital, Istanbul. Methods: During our investigation, a series of different samples such as sputum, bronchial aspiration, pleural fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage, gastric lavage, urine, periton fluid and lenfadenopathy drenage recovered from patients in the three major services, were treated with N-acetyl-L-cysteine-3% NaOH decontamination and concentration procedure. Each sample was then cultivated in BacT/Alert 3D MP bottle and Lö wenstein-Jensen medium in 37°C. Acid-fast staining was employed for smear preparation. Time and presence of growth on BacT/Alert 3D MP bottle was monitored and recorded. Additionally, we have evaluated efficiency of BacT/ Alert MP medium in rapid differentiation of mycobacteria by adding PNB. Results: Among the smear-positive and smear-negative specimens, more Mycobacteria grew on BacT/ALERT MP then L-J media. In smear-positive samples, BacT/ALERT 3D system showed a few days earlier then in smear negative samples. Contamination ratios for BacT/Alert 3D and L-J were 3 and 4%, respectively. The total mean time of detection of BacT/ ALERT MP bottles were approximately 19 days shorter than Lö wenstein-Jensen media. It has been determined that all bottles with Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex showed no growth or late growth compared to bottles containing p-nitrobenzoic acid. But other mycobacteria bottles showed same type of growth as the bottles containing p-nitrobenzoic acid. Mean time of p-nitrobenzoic acid test for other mycobacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex have not exceed more than 5 days. Conclusions: It has been showed that the performing of p-nitrobenzoic acid test in BacT/ALERT MP bottles is sensitive and rapid. Thus total testing time of mycobacteria at the system provides the ability to meet the 21 days target for detection and identification of M. tuberculosis complex as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA. The studies were performed on 15 strains of S. aureus isolated from patients with chronic inflammatory processes in the throat and/or skin and demonstrated to be of staphylococcal aetiology. Surface proteins were isolated by Laemmli buffer and were electrophoretically separated (SDS-PAGE), stained with Coomassie blue or transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting with patient sera, obtained in two time points, i.e. before and after applying the autovaccine. The antigen/ antibody reactions were visualized employing the alkaline phosphatase method. Protein profiles for individual S. aureus strains and immunobloting results were analysed using GelD-OK software (Syngen Biotech). Results: Using Western-immunoblotting, the IgG lass antibodies were fund to react to S. aureus surface proteins of 14-140 kDa molecular weight while IgM class antibodies reacted with proteins of molecular weight of 25-94 kDa. In studies on the autovaccines IgM antibodies were detected directed toward individual polypeptides in 12 patients while no IgM class antibodies could be detected in the remaining 3 patients. In the subsequent time point of the study (after administration of autovaccine), in 12 patients IgM class immune response was found to resemble that documented before while the remaining, previously negative 3 patients this time carried IgM antibodies specific toward individual polypeptides. As far as IgG class humoral reaction was concerned, the response was comparable in the two time points of the study.
