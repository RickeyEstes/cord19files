The trends in clinical virology practices show gradual substitution of the traditional virus discovery methods with novel molecular biology technology. Nevertheless, traditional and the newer molecular biology techniques to isolate, identify, and characterize viruses play complementary roles in the viral discovery effort. For a comprehensive list and detailed description of molecular methods used for virus discovery, readers are referred to reviews by Delwart [31 ] and Tang [35 ] . Here, we focus on the viruses discovered using these methods and their future applications in clinical microbiology and public health settings. Two types of molecular methods have been used for the virus discovery effort: sequence-dependent and sequence-independent methods. Sequence-dependent methods, including PCR using consensus primers and hybridization methods such as microarrays, require the knowledge of the nucleic acid for the detection of novel viruses. Indeed, consensus sequences of previously known viruses have been used to identify novel viruses including highly divergent clades of human immunodeficiency virus [36] , simian retroviruses [37] [38] [39] [40] , and hepatitis E virus [41] . However, PCR using consensus primers based on previously characterized viruses have little or no value in detecting completely novel viruses. The microarray techniques were first introduced in 1995 to monitor the expression of multiple genes simultaneously [42] . For virus discovery, microarrays can be prepared with probes that hybridize known viral sequences and potentially novel viruses with sufficient sequence similarity. The method has been applied to detect a wide range of known viruses as well as novel highly divergent viral taxa [43] . Microarray screening has led to the identification and characterization of a novel gammaretrovirus, xenotropic murine leukemia virusrelated virus (XMRV), in prostate tumors [43, 44] . Subsequent studies did not confirm these initial findings [45, 46] , which points to potential limitations of the method. Another example of a well-known virus discovered with microarrays is SARS-CoV, a highly divergent coronavirus discovered amid a worldwide outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [43] . Reproducibility of results between microarray tests is frequently poor [47] . Unlike PCR and microarrays, the sequence-independent viral metagenomic approaches do not rely on prior knowledge of viruses in the samples. The suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and representational difference analysis (RDA) are examples of sequence-independent virus discovery methods. SSH was used first to study gene expression [48] and was later applied to investigate the etiology of diseases of unknown origin [49] . By hybridizing DNA obtained from patients and control subjects, nucleic acid from an unknown pathogen(s) can be detected [49] [50] [51] . Use of RDA led to the discovery of human herpes simplex virus type 8 (HHV8) [52] , Torque Teno virus (TTV) [53] , GBV-A, GBV-B viruses [54] and a novel highly divergent murine norovirus [55] . This method lacks sufficient sensitivity to detect viruses when the viral burden is low or when the DNA sequence of the suspected etiological agent is not clearly distinguishable from the control sample [31] . Sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) circumvents the viral load limitation of SSH. Although there are several variations to the original protocol published by Reyes et al. [56] , the main strategy of SISPA is to exploit the sensitivity and the specificity of PCR amplification using primers that bind oligonucleotide fragments ligated to any putative viral DNA materials in the sample. SISPA has been modified to allow the detection of both DNA and RNA viruses after the removal of genomic and contaminating nucleic acids [57] . The SISPA method was used successfully for the discovery of Hepatitis E virus [58, 59] , Norwalk virus [60] , Human astrovirus [61, 62] , and Parvoviruses 2 and 3 [63] . Another sequence-independent technique, the viral metagenomics (described in detail below), provides superior capability to detect known and unknown viruses than the traditional and molecular sequence-dependent and sequence-independent methods.
