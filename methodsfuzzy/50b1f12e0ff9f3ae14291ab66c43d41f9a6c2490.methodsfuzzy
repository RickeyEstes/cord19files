Cells and virus. The sources and routine propagation of the L2 and RN2-2 cell lines, and the MHV3 and JHM strains of mouse hepatitis virus were as previously described (Lucas et al, 1977) except that alpha medium (Stanners et al, 1971 ) was used in place of Eagle's minimal essential medium. Virus production was monitored by a plaque assay on LZ-cell monolayers as previously described (Lucas et a& 1977) . Yields are expressed as PFU/ml (plaque-forming units/mililiter). To determine the fraction of cells able to release virus, an infectious center assay was performed (Lucas et al, 1978) . Selection of genetica& wmrked IA? cells. L2 cells were treated for 3 hr in the presence of 0.2 pg/ml. N-Methyl-N'-nitro-Nnitrosoguanidine at 34", washed, and resuspended in fresh medium. Survival was usually about 50%. The cells were allowed to grow 6 days to allow for expression of putative mutations before selections were carried out. The basic procedure for mutant selections is described elsewhere (Flintoff et al., 1976) . Cells, at 5 X 105/100-mm tissue culture dish, were exposed to 0.2 pg/ml 6-thioguanine (TG) (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 8 days at 34" with replacement of drug and medium every 2 days. Colonies surviving at a frequency of 4 X lop6 were picked, cloned by limit dilution, and tested for resistance. One clone, L2 TGR7, was resistant to at least 50 pg/ml TG, a concentration lo3 higher than was cytotoxic for the wild-type cells, and contained ~0.1% of the wild-type hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase activity as determined by the assay described by Chasin and Urlaub (1976) . The L2 TGR7 cells were exposed to 3 mM ouabain (Oua) to select for Oua-resistant cells (Baker et al, 1974) . Colonies surviving at a frequency of lOA were isolated, cloned, and shown to be resistant to at least 3 mM Oua. Wild-type cells were unable to grow at concentrations above 0.5 mM. One doublely marked clone, L2 TGROuaR7-1, was used in the hybridization experiments. Neither resistance to TG, nor Oua, nor the presence of both of these markers affected the ability of the cells to support the replication of either the MHV, or JHM strains of mouse hepatitis virus. Cell-cell hybridization. Somatic cell hybrids were formed between the L2 TGROuaR7-1 and RN2-2 cells by exposure to polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 (British Drug House) for 1 min using the procedure described by Pontecorvo (1975) . Cells were plated in complete medium for 1 day to allow recovery from the fusion process prior to the addition of HAT + Oua selection medium (7 X 1O-5 M hypoxanthine, 2 X lop8 M methotrexate, 4 X lop5 M thymidine, 2 X lop3 M Oua). Using these selective conditions, neither parental cell line survives. The mouse L2 cells are unable to survive in the HAT medium and the rat RN2-2 are killed by the Oua. Table 1 summarizes the hybridization frequencies obtained in two separate experiments. After 8 to 10 days incubation at 34" surviving colonies were picked, expanded, maintained in normal medium, and used for study. Subclones of some of these isolates were obtained by limit dilution. There were no differences in the responses of these subclones and the original isolates to virus infection. Kaqotgpic analyses. Exponentially growing cells were incubated with 0.25 pg/ml colcemid (Grand Island Biological Co.) for 1.5 hr at 34". The cells were washed with hypotonic and fixing solutions and chromosome spreads prepared (Worton and Duff, 1979) . Preparations were either treated with 0.05% trypsin for varying periods of time and stained with Giemsa or the centromeres were stained using the procedure described by Marshall (1975) . For this latter procedure, slides were baked for 48 hr at 55", treated for 1 min with 0.05% trypsin in 0.15 MNaCl, treated with formamide-SCC (95 ml neutralized formamide and 5 ml 20X SSC (1X SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 1.5 mM Na citrate) at 65" for 20 min, rinsed with distilled HzO, stained with 10% Giemsa in Gurr's buffer, pH 6.8, and  ,J Hybrids were formed and selected by growth in HAT medium containing 2 mM Oua as described under Materials and Methods.
