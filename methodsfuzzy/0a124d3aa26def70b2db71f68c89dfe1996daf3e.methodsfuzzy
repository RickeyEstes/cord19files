Nucleotide sequences of the single-stranded (ss) RNA genomes of coronavirus, picornavirus, and HIV (reference strains and unclassified species) were downloaded from the ViralZone database (http://viralzone.expasy.org/) [7, 8] . Flaviviridae were selected and classified according to [9, 10] (Berkhout and van Hemert, unpublished results). GenBank IDs are provided in the figures. Nucleotide skew analysis was done by means of the GenSkew algorithm [1] , of which Dr. T. Rattei (Technische Universität München) kindly provided a version that is not restricted by the length of a sequence. For normalization purposes, the overlapping window size was set 1% of the sequence length with a step size of 20% of the window size. e skew between two nucleotides N1 and N2 is defined by the ratio (N1 − N2)/(N1 + N2), and hence, a positive value of this ratio indicates that N1 proportionally exceeds N2. If the N1 versus N2 comparison results in a negative skew value, the same but positive skew value is true for these nucleotides in the reverse order (N2 versus N1). Algorithms converting skew data into a pairwise Euclidean distance matrix are provided as Additional File S1. e multiple sequence alignment of coronaviral, flaviviral, picornaviral, and HIV genomes was obtained by means of MAFFT [11] . Other alignments and Neighbor Joining (NJ) skew distance trees were built in MEGA v7 [12] . Phylogenetic histories were inferred by using the maximum-likelihood method based on the general time reversible model of nucleotide substitution in the viral genomes [12] . A discrete gamma distribution (5 categories) was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites. e tree with the highest log likelihood is shown. Randomization of the rubella virus RNA genome (10 consecutive cycles to ensure complete nucleotide randomization) was performed by means of the BioWeb server (http://www.cellbiol.com/ scripts/randomizer/dna_protein_sequence_randomizer. php). All calculations were performed in Excel.
