A human codon-optimized gene encoding the MHV spike gene (UniProt: P11224) was synthesized with a R717S amino acid mutation to abolish the furin cleavage site at the S 1 -S 2 junction (S 2 cleavage site). From this gene, the fragment encoding the MHV ectodomain (residues 15-1231) was PCR-amplified and ligated to a gene fragment encoding a GCN4 trimerization motif (IKRMKQIEDKIEEIESKQKKIENEIARIKKIK) 3
