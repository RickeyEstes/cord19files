We telephoned all 261 hospitals in the UK listed as having a major ED in the 2004 directory of the British Association for Emergency Medicine. In the UK a major ED is defined as one that accepts patients 24 h per day, 365 days per year and is staffed by accredited emergency physicians. Major EDs range in size from small district general hospital EDs which see less than 25 000 patients per year to large inner-city EDs which see greater than 100 000 patients per year. As these are the only health care facilities that provide care 24 h per day, 365 days per year they are therefore at greatest risk of receiving patients with potential infectious diseases. Telephone calls were made to the duty sister/ charge nurse or duty shift leader in the ED of each hospital. An initial approach was made in July 2004. Follow-up telephone calls to initial non-responders were made in October 2004 and December 2004. Data were collected using a standardised data collection sheet (Appendix 1). Data were collected on hospital characteristics, facilities for isolation of patients presenting to the ED with potential infectious diseases, and procedures for the management of patients with known infectious diseases. The questions used were derived from national guidance current in the UK at the time the survey was undertaken and from experts in infectious diseases, public health medicine and emergency medicine.
