2.1. Preparation of an analytical sample 2.1.1. Extraction of nucleic acids 2.1.1.1. Cattle and bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1). The present study used seven samples of feces collected from calves in farms of Hokkaido, Ishikawa prefecture, and Kagoshima prefecture in Japan. BHV-1 served as a positive control. Feces were adjusted to a 10% emulsion with sterile PBS and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 C by using a microcentrifuge. RNA was extracted from the supernatant using the TRIzol LS Reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and treated with DNase I (TaKaRa Bio). Then, equal amounts of RNA obtained from each sample were mixed into 1 sample. For DNA extraction from the isolated strain of BHV-1, QIAamp DNA Mini kit (QIAGEN) was used. 2.1.1.2. Pig and goat samples. Feces of four piglets less than 3 weeks old collected from one farm in Japan and diarrheic feces obtained from two goats in Okinawa prefecture were analyzed. We previously reported the presence of a novel porcine rotavirus, astrovirus, posavirus, and circovirus in the sample group including these four samples [9,11e13,15] . Feces were adjusted to 10% emulsion with sterile PBS and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 C. RNA was extracted from the supernatant by using the ISOGEN LS Reagent (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). DNA was extracted from the supernatant with the QIAamp Fast DNA stool kit (QIAGEN, Venlo, Netherlands). An analytical sample was constructed for the library using the SureSelect QXT Reagent kit (Agilent Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). The overview of each step is shown in Fig. 1 . First, we generated the DNA library of obtained ds DNA samples by randomly fragmenting the dsDNA, and subsequent addition of adapter sequence, to which the index primer anneals. Then, the DNA samples were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA). Next, the adapter-attached library was amplified using the Sure-Select QXT Primer Mix. The PCR was conducted as follows: 68 C for 2 min, at 98 C for 2 min, followed by 8 cycles of 98 C for 30 s, 57 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 1 min; with a final extension at 72 C for 5 min. Immediately after the reaction, the DNA sample was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP. The adapter-attached DNA library was hybridized to the virus capture library designed for this study, and nucleic acids of the target viruses were enriched. Specifically, a sample was mixed with the SureSelect QXT Fast Blocker Mix and was incubated at 95 C for 5 min and 65 C for 10 min using a thermal cycler. After holding the sample at 65 C for 1 min in the thermal cycler, we added SureSelect QXT Fast Hybridization Buffer to the sample and performed 60 cycles of incubation at 65 C for 1 min and 37 C for 3 s. Immediately after the reaction, SureSelect RNase Block solution was added to the sample, and the captured DNA was purified by using Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K. Yokohama, Japan). Then, the DNA library, which was attached to streptavidin beads, was amplified by PCR after addition of the index primer, dNTP mix, Herculase â…¡ Reaction Buffer, and Herculase 2 Fusion DNA polymerase. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 98 C for 2 min; followed by 20 cycles of 98 C for 30 s, 58 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72 C for 5 min. After PCR, streptavidin beads were removed from the sample by using a magnet stand, and the PCR products, which were not associated with the beads, were further purified with Agencourt AMPure XP. The obtained purified product was subjected to NGS analysis. We call the NGS data analysis of the library on the basis on this method postcapture sequencing. As a conventional method, libraries were constructed from ds cDNA using the Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, Calif., USA). Specifically, ds cDNA was randomly fragmented and was mixed with an adapter and was attached to an index. After the reaction, size selection was performed using Agencourt AMPure XP. The NGS data analysis of the library constructed by the conventional method was called precapture sequencing.
