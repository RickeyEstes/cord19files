Regardless of the many variations on the theme of how to assemble a large synthetic DNA, at the core of all current methods are chemically synthesized oligonucleotides. The downward price trend for oligos has slowed significantly over the past 5 years and appears to be bottoming out (currently in the $0.10-0.20/base range). Because the price gap, and therefore the profit margin, between finished synthetic genes and their oligo building blocks is narrowing, it can be expected that oligobased gene synthesis prices will soon follow. For long DNA synthesis to become economical, radically new technologies need to be developed that either reduce the errors in run-ofthe-mill oligos by orders of magnitude, or allow de novo gene synthesis independent of the error-prone oligonucleotide chemistry, perhaps by developing enzyme-based synthesis of long accurate polynucleotides. Barring such breakthrough, the routine synthesis of bacterial or larger genomes will likely remain prohibitively expensive for some time to come. As a case in point, the recent synthesis of the Mycoplasma genome (Gibson et al., 2008) cost an estimated $10 million (Herper, 2007) . At the research level, however, once gene synthesis hits the $0.10-0.20/bp price range, synthesis will very likely replace the traditional recombinant DNA methods for many smaller scale cloning projects within the next few years. A major problem with genes assembled from overlapping oligos is the inherent error rate of about 1% during the chemical synthesis of the oligos themselves. The most frequent error is the failure to incorporate bases due to less than perfect deprotection of the reactive groups or incorporation of the incoming nucleotide. It appears that there is a rather hard limit for improving the oligo accuracy during the synthesis step much beyond the 1/100. Therefore, several techniques are being employed, often in combination, to improve the accuracy of oligos and the assembled DNA intermediates. 1. Keeping the oligos and the overlapping regions between them short (40-50 bases) not only reduces the relative error rate per nucleotide in the oligo, but also increases the disruptive effect of mismatches between annealed oligos. Using stringent hybridization conditions thus reduces the chance of incorrect oligos to partake in the assembly reaction (Young and Dong, 2004 ).
