Protein-protein interaction analysis by bioinformatics. A new method developed in our laboratory was applied to map the binding proteins of SARS_NP. In brief, the procedure of this method comprised the following steps: (1) homology search was performed to identify the homologous proteins of SARS_NP. These proteins were selected as queries for searching the protein-protein interaction database DIP (http://www.DIP.org). (2) Proteins in the DIP database that possibly interact with SARS_NP homologous proteins were selected as the candidates of the SARS_NP binding proteins. (3) PFAM database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/) was searched to obtain the domain distributions of the binding protein candidates. (4) Keywords search was performed on the PFAM and Interpro databases (http:// www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) to annotate the biological functions of the SARS_NP binding protein candidates. Proteins with functions related to immunosuppression, immunoregulation, and virus infection were picked out for further analysis and biological assay. Chemicals and enzymes. The restriction and modifying enzymes in this work were purchased from TaKaRa. The bacterial strains M15 and DH5a, and the vector pQE30 were from Qiagen. TRIzol and Superscript II reverse transcriptase were purchased from Gibco. The chelating affinity column and lower molecular weight (LMW) marker were purchased from Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech. Isopropyl b-D Dthiogalactoside (IPTG) was purchased from Promega. All other chemicals were from Sigma in their analytical grade. Plasmids and site-directed mutagenesis. All the recombinant DNA methods including PCR, restriction digestion, ligation, Escherichia coli transformation, and plasmid DNA preparation were performed according to the standard methods [31] . SARS-CoV (isolate BJ01) RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturerÕs instruction (www.genehub.net/ trizol.htm). The reverse transcription was performed with the random priming method by the Superscript II reverse transcriptase. The SARS_NP cDNA was subsequently amplified by PCR, using the following primers: Fw, 5 0 ATTAGGATCCTCTGATAATGGACCCCA ATCA3 0 ; and Rv, 5 0 TTAAGTCGACTGCCTGAGTTGAATCAGC AGA 3 0 . After digestion with BamHI and SalI, the PCR product was inserted into the BamHI and SalI sites of the vector pQE30 to construct the plasmid pQE30-SARS_NP. The SARS_NP insert was verified by sequencing. The site-directed mutational plasmids pQE30-SARS_NP-Q307A, pQE30-SARS_NP-Q307D, pQE30-SARS_NP-W302A, and pQE30-SARS_NP-I305A were obtained according to the Quick-change Mutagensis (Stratagene). The plasmid pQE30-CypA was kindly provided by the Center of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Nanjing PLA Hospital, Nanjing 210002, China. The site-directed mutational plasmids pQE30-CypA-R55A, pQE30-CypA-R55D, pQE30-CypA-Q63A, pQE30-CypA-W121F, pQE30-CypA-R69A, and pQE30-CypA-R69K were obtained according to the Quick-change Mutagensis (Stratagene). Expression and purification of SARS_NP, hCypA, and mutants. SARS_NP wild-type protein was expressed and purified based on the following procedure. The recombinant plasmid pQE30-SARS_NP was transfected into M15 (DE3) bacterial strain. Clones were grown overnight in LB medium containing 100 mg/L ampicillin and 25 mg/L kanamycin. Expression of the His-tagged recombinant protein was induced at an OD 600 of 0.7-0.9 with the addition of isopropyl-b-D Dthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM. After induction for 12 h at 37°C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 30 min at 4000 r/m, 4°C and stored at À70°C. During the protein purification, cells were resuspended in 20 ml buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, and 1 mM PMSF) and then lysed by sonication for 15 min in icy bath. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 4°C, 14,000 r/m for 60 min. To the supernatant were added DNAase and RNAase to the final concentration of 2 lg/ml for either of them in order to get rid of the possible bound DNA and RNA scraps to the protein of interest. This mixture was incubated at 20°C for 3 h before further treatments. The nuclease treated supernatant was loaded on a 4 ml Sepharose Ni-NTA column (Amersham-Pharmacia) equilibrated with 30 ml buffer A. The column was eluted with buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, and 500 mM imidazole) after being washed by buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, and 120 mM imidazole). The elution fraction was further applied to a gel filtration column (Hiprep 16/60 Sephacyl S100) on a FPLC (Amersham-Pharmacia) system. The expression and purification of the SARS_NP mutants (SARS_NP-Q307A, SARS_NP-Q307D, SARS_NP-W302A, and SARS_NP-I305A) in this work were carried out using the similar procedures for the SARS_NP wild-type protein. The procedures of expression and purification for hCypA wild-type and its mutants hCypA-R55A, hCypA-R55D, hCypA-Q63A, hCypA-W121F, hCypA-R69A, and hCypA-R69K are similar to those for NP wild-type and its mutants except that for hCypA wild-type and its mutants: (1) the expression temperature is 25°C; (2) the concentration of IPTG is 0.5 mM; and (3) the expression time is 7 h. Protein-protein binding assay. The binding affinities of proteinprotein interactions (hCypA to SARS_NP and SARS_NP mutant proteins, and SARS_NP to hCypA and hCypA mutant proteins) were determined emplying SPR technology based Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Rapsgatan 7, S-754 50 Uppsala, Sweden). Immobilization of the protein to the CM5 sensor chip (Biacore) was carried out by the standard primary amine coupling reaction. The protein to be covalently bound to the matrix was diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.3) to a final concentration of 0.35 mg/ml. Equilibration of the baseline was completed by a continuous flow of HBS-EP running buffer (10 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20, pH 7.4) through the chip for 1-2 h. All the Biacore data were collected at 25°C with HBS-EP as running buffer at a constant flow of 20 ll/min. All the sensorgrams were processed by using automatic correction for non-specific bulk refractive index effects. Langmuir binding fitting model was used for estimating the K D values, in which the association rate constant (k on ) and dissociation rate constant (k off ) are fitted simultaneously by rate Eq. (1), where R represents the response unit, C is the concentration of the ligands, and Molecular modeling and free energy calculation. Based on the sequence alignment ( Fig. 2A) , the 3D model of the segment Val235-Pro369 of SARS_NP was constructed by using Homology module of Insight II (Insight II, 2000) and the MODELLER program [32] taking the 3D structure of capsid isolated from the X-ray crystal structure of CA 151 -hCypA complex (PDB entry 1AK4) as a template. After structural optimization, the 3D model of segment Val235-Pro369 was manually docked into the active site groove of the X-ray crystal structure of hCypA by taking loop Trp302-Pro310 as the SARS_NP binding loop. The entire complex structure was then optimized by using molecular mechanics method with AMBER force field and Kollman-all-Atom charges [33] . Complexes of wild-type hCypA (or SARS_NP) with mutated SARS_NP (or hCypA) were constructed based on the 3D model of SARS_NP-hCypA complex (Fig. 2B ) by using Biopolymer module encoded in Sybyl 6.8 [34] . These complex models were solvated by a 28 Å TIP3P [35] water sphere. Then the solvated models were equilibrated for 300 ps at 300 K by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and a 100 ps MD simulation was run on each model system, sampling the conformations for binding free energy calculation. All MD simulations were carried out by using the AMBER 7.0 program with AMBER force field (parm98) [33] . The MM/PBSA method [36] was used to evaluate the binding free energies of SARS_NP-hCypA complexes. In general, the average binding free energy of proteinprotein interaction (averaged over 50 samples isolated from the MD trajectory), DG bind , is calculated by Eq. (3) : where DE MM is the interaction energy of the two proteins calculated by the AMBER force field, including internal, electrostatic, and van der Waals components; DG PB is the polar solvation contribution calculated by using a finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) model [37] , and DG NP is the non-polar solvation energy, which is obtained from the solvent accessible surface area (SASA). The relative binding free energy, DDG bind , is the difference between the binding free energy of a mutated SARS_NP (or hCypA) to wild-type hCypA (or SARS_NP) and that of wild-type SARS_NP to wild-type hCypA.
