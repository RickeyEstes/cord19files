The study took place at the University Hospital of Saint-Ã‰tienne, France, from January to March 2013, i.e. the period of circulation of epidemic viruses (influenza viruses, RSV, gastroenteritis-associated viruses) in our setting [22] (personal data). HCWs of the paediatric and adult emergency rooms, as well of those of the general paediatric and the infectious diseases departments, were involved. The term 'mobile phones' was used to indicate both PMPs and DECTs. Physicians and residents were considered to be medical staff (n = 55); nurses and nurses' assistants were considered to be paramedical HCWs (n = 59). The design of the study is summarized in Fig. 1 . Medical students were excluded from the survey, but because the sampling of MPs was performed in their unit during the study, we also sampled their PMPs. None of the HCWs declared or presented signs of epidemic viral infection at the time of MP sampling. Behavioural patterns in the use of MPs by HCWs Each department was visited twice by SP and EBN during the study period. A questionnaire was administered to all HCWs in the visited departments, without previous information about the study being provided. Participants were volunteers and answered anonymously; they all agreed that the MPs they used could be sampled. General data about the use of PMPs or DECTs during work were recorded, such as using the device close to patients, using an alcohol-based hand rub before and after use and cleaning the MPs.
