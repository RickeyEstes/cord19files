Of 137 female patients studied the predominate symptom was frequency in 40 patients, urge incontinence in 31 and stress incontinence in 66 patients (table 1) . A cystometrogram was done with the patient in the supine and standing positions via a 16F Foley catheter using a Merrill air cystometer. Cystometrograms were repeated at different rates of fill. For vesical and urethral pressure profile measurements 2, 5F Millar PC 350 Mikro-Tip catheters were used and the distance from the tip of the catheter was marked in centimeters. At first both catheters were passed into the bladder and 1 was fixed in the bladder while the other catheter was withdrawn through the bladder neck, and a urethral pressure profile was obtained with constant withdrawal at 1 mm. per second by mechanical means. Urethral planimetry was defined as the measurement of the area under the urethral profile extending from the point where the urethral pressure exceeds the bladder pressure and including the area down to the zero base line. Electromyography of the levator ani, and the external anal and external urethral sphincters was done using Disa coaxial needles. For the levator ani the needle was inserted in the perineum 1 cm. from the midline and 3 to 5 cm. deep (depending on the subcutaneous tissue of the patient). For the external urethral sphincter the second needle was inserted 1.5 cm. deep between the clitoris and the external meatus; previous insertion of the Foley catheter made this placement easier. The third electromyography needle was inserted in the external anal sphincter 1 cm. from the mucocutaneous line and 1 cm. deep. In all 3 insertions the audible recording of active motor neuron firing was used to confirm the correct positioning of the electromyography needle in the required muscle. When the needles were in proper position, reflexly provoked electromyographic activity was registered by pulling on an indwelling Foley catheter, which provided sensory input for pelvic floor muscle contraction. The method of recording the electromyography was 2-fold: 1) visually on a storage oscilloscope with Polaroid camera reproduction of the tracing and 2) acoustically with the loudspeaker. Both modalities gave approximately an equal amount of information and both were taken into consideration in determining the degree of innervation of the muscle studied. The grading of innervation (activity) was classified as normal or slight, moderate. or severe degrees of denervation (reduced activity).
