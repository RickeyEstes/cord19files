Systems biology approaches have been used to assess vaccine effectiveness. 97e99 There is a difficulty in looking at gene expression in immune cells since there are many cell types involved in the immune response. Each blood sample can provide information on many lineages and differentiation states for the cells involved in immune response. Characterization of gene signatures for a range of vaccines can result in the design of gene chips for high-throughput analysis of gene expression in response to a vaccine or Natural Adjuvants and Immunopotentiators vaccine plus adjuvant. The systems biology approach to vaccine optimization can also use other omics technologies such as proteomics or metabolomics. There are several systems, which can be used to assess the effect of adjuvants in improving the immune response to antigens. Animal models are widely used, but there are frequent debates about how animal models translate to action in humans. 100 Whole fresh blood with antigen plus adjuvant can be followed by monitoring of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1b or IFN-g release by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 101 Assays used in the development of vaccines and associated adjuvants include stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine productiondeither Th1 (IL-2, IFN-g, and TNF-a) or Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10); quantitation of the expression of cell activation markers on cell surface such as CD25, CD69, CD80, and CD86 by using a fluorescenceactivated cell sorter (FACS) 102 ; quantitation of different lymphocyte subpopulations by FACS, e.g., CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16/CD56, CD19, CD20, and CD45; augmentation of NK cell cytotoxicity; stimulation of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a production by macrophages in response to LPS; and stimulation of antibody plaqueeforming cells and antibody production. In vivoeassociated assays include stimulation of antibody titers by specific antigens and determination of Th1/Th2 cytokine profiles. 102, 103 There is a gradual move toward more systems-based approaches in assessing vaccine efficacy, and some applications of omics technologies are also included in this. The most widely used technology to date is the application of microarray technology to examine RNA expression posttreatment. 97e99 In addition, microchip technologies can be applied to well-established assays such as ELISA and the enzyme-linked immunospot assay. 104, 105 The application of microarray technologies has been recently reviewed. 106 Another commonly applied assay uses Luminex technology. In this case, beads bearing either single DNA strands or antibodies are introduced into the sample in a 96-well-plate format and the analytes of interest are captured. 107 The technology is highly suitable for quantifying response to an antigen via measurement of an array of cytokines and allows systems biology approaches to be used in assessing vaccine response. 108 Further down the omics ladder, the application of proteomics in adjuvant research does not appear to be widespread. However, the use of metabolomics to find lowmolecular-weight metabolite markers of vaccine effects is just beginning to emerge. Metabolomics simply aims to profile all the metabolites within a biological fluid or tissue. In effect this means that somewhere between 200 and several thousand metabolites are monitored depending on the instrument technology used for screening.
