Peptides N-acetylated or fluorescein-conjugated peptides derived from the GBV-C glycoprotein E2 (P4-7, P4-7s, P6-2, P6-2s, P9, and P28) were obtained from EMC Microcollections (TÃ¼bingen, Germany). All other peptides (listed in Table S1 ) were synthesized by a standard solid-phase FMOC method using a peptide synthesizer. The N-and C-termini of N36 and C34, as well as the gp120 N-terminus peptides, were acetylated and amidated, respectively. The gp41 disulfide peptides (Loop36ox and Loop36s) were N-terminally biotinylated for site-selective attachment to streptavidin-coated assay plates. Loop36o6 was cyclized by formation of a disulfide bridge between the two cysteine residues through air oxidation at pH 8. The peptides were purified to homogeneity (.95% purity) by high-performance liquid chromatography and verified by laser desorption mass spectrometry (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) and by ESI mass spectrometry, respectively. Peptide stocks were dissolved in 75% DMSO/H 2 O and diluted for experiments in respective buffers or medium. Globular and disordered regions in E2 were identified using GlobPlot2.3 [47] with standard settings. Secondary structure prediction was performed using the consensus prediction method provided by the NPS@ server [48] . Structural homologs were identified with the bioinfo.pl meta prediction server [49] , and modelling was performed with Modeller6.2 [50] , using the crystal structure of a single-variable-domain antibody (PDB code: 2Z8W) as template [51] . Sequence comparison between different E2 proteins and between E2 and gp160 was performed with LALIGN (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/LALIGN_form.html) using the local alignment option. The gp160 signal peptide comprising residues 1 to 30 was removed prior to the similarity searches because it is not present in the mature protein.
