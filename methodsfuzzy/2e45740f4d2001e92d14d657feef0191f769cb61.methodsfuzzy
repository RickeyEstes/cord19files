A potential pathogen was identified in 164 (53%) cases. Multiple agents were detected in 30 cases (10%; Table 3 ), and the most commonly identified organism was S pneumoniae, (61 cases, 20%). A respiratory virus was recovered in 47 cases (15%), and an atypical bacterial agent (M pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, or Legionella species) was recovered in 43 cases (14%). In addition, Burkholderia pseudomallei was detected in 1 instance, in a traveler returning from Southeast Asia. Among cases with multiple pathogens detected (n = 30), the most common combination was S pneumoniae with a virus. S pneumoniae was detected with influenza in 5 cases (17%), (14) 1 (17) 1 (17) 7 (15) 3 (7) 5 (17) COPD 80 (26) 19 ( 35 (57) 17 (39) 12 (55) 3 (38) 4 (57) 3 (60) 12 (43) 1 (17) 2 (33) 19 (40) 19 (44) 17 (57) Diaphoresis 94 (30) 16 (26) 16 (44) 4 (18) 1 (13) 3 (43) 1 (20) 12 (43) 1 (17) 1 (17) 16 (34) 16 ( (14) 10 (16) 3 (8) 4 (18) 3 (38) 1 (14) 0 4 (14) 2 (33) 1 (17) 8 (17) 4 (9) 6 (20) Diarrhea 49 (16) 12 (20) 9 (25) 3 (14) 1 (13) with rhinovirus in 4 cases (13%), and with RSV in 3 cases (10%; see Table 3 ). Sputum culture was positive in 54 cases (53% of available samples); however, only 101 participants (33%) could provide an adequate sample. In comparison, blood culture yielded relevant results in 16 (7%) of 231 cases. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of 201 available samples resulted in the identification of 43 (21%) atypical bacterial pathogens and 47 (23%) viruses. In addition, 31 (25%) possible cases of S pneumoniae and 12 (12%) possible cases of H influenzae were detected using PCR. For S pneumoniae, 19 cases were not confirmed by other methods, whereas 4 cases of H influenzae were not confirmed by other methods. S pneumoniae and H influenzae were identified in 22 and 30 additional cases, respectively, using multiplex PCR, but these were above the cycle threshold and thus excluded from further analysis. A complete set of samples was available in 58 cases (19%) ( Table 4) , an etiological agent was detected in 45 cases (78%), and multiple pathogens were identified in 15 cases (26%). S pneumoniae and H influenzae were identified at a greater rate among patients without recent antibiotic use, whereas M pneumoniae was detected more frequently among patients with recent antimicrobial use (Table 4 ).
