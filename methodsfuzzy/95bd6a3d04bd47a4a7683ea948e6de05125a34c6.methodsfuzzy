Weekly health status updates are collected over the telephone as an automated telephone poll or in person. Results from the latter are entered directly into REDCap and from the former are automatically collected as a CVS file. Interviewer administered questionnaire responses are entered onto an electronic form using a tablet, with these electronic data then transferred into REDCap; if entered on paper forms, double data entry will be used to enter data into REDCap. Information obtained from medical chart reviews, if not received as an electronic file, is documented on standardized paper forms, and then deposited in the subject's file after review by the Study Coordinator. Clinical laboratory reports, including reference ranges and individual results, are documented electronically by the Stanford Clinical Laboratories or another reference laboratory with hard-copy forms sent to the PI. All clinical laboratory results are faxed to the study office on individualized standard report forms as completed. Serologic and cytokine assays are run in batch with results captured automatically on Excel spreadsheet templates and emailed to the PI, Data Analyst and Study Coordinator for review. Results of microbiome analysis are captured automatically off the sequencers as raw .sff files, which are then run through a bioinformatics pipeline (Google QIIME).
