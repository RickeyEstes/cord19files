Plasmids. Plasmids expressing HSV-1 (KOS strain) gB (pPEP98), gD (pPEP99), gH (pPEP100), and gL (pPEP101) (kindly provided by Patricia Spear, Northwestern University) were previously described (49) , as were plasmids expressing human nectin-1 (pBG38; kindly provided by Patricia Spear, Northwestern University) (6), HVEM (pBEC10; kindly provided by Patricia Spear, Northwestern University) (4), and human PILR␣ (pQF003) (50) . pGS1439, a plasmid containing the Kan r -encoding gene, was kindly provided by Gregory Smith, Northwestern University. pSG5-HSVgB-I671A/H681A/F683A contains HSV-1 gB carrying three alanine mutations in domain V (3A here) (20) . Virus construction. To construct the HSV-1 gB 3A viruses, we first created a gB-null virus by using BAC pGS3217 (kindly provided by Gregory Smith, Northwestern University). GS3217 is an HSV-1 F strain that carries the red fluorescent protein (RFP) tdTomato reporter gene with a nuclear localization signal under the control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. GS3217 was derived from a BAC kindly provided by Yasushi Kawaguchi, University of Tokyo (51) . The CMVϾNLS-tdTomatoϾpA cassette is inserted after the start codon of US5 (gJ) and introduces an in-frame stop codon. First, the Kan r -encoding gene was amplified from pGS1439 by PCR with primers TGCACATGCGGTTTAACACCCGTGGTTTTTATTTACAACAAA CCCCCCGGGCGGGACTACGGGGAGGATGACGACGATAAGTAGGG and GCCCCCAGGCTACCTGACGGGGG GCACGACGGGCCCCCGTAGTCCCGCCCGGGGGGTTTGTTGTCAACCAATTAACCAATTCTGAT, which consist of UL27 (gB) flanking sequence and Kan r homology (in bold). By using a two-step red-mediated recombination strategy (32, 33) , this PCR product was recombined into pGS3217 in place of UL27 (gB) to delete WT UL27 and then the Kan r cassette was recombined out to generate gB-null BAC pQF282 ( Fig. 1B and C) . To add the mutant gB 3A-encoding gene to gB-null BAC pQF282, the Kan r -encoding gene was amplified from pGS1439 by PCR with primers CGTTCCACCGGTACGGGACGACGGTAAACTGCATCGTCGA GGAGGTGGACGCGCGCTCGGTGTAGGATGACGACGATAAGTAGGGA and TCCCGTACCGGTCAACCAATTAA CCAATTCTGAT, which consist of UL27 (gB) sequence (including an AgeI restriction site [in bold]) and Kan r homology (underlined). This PCR product was digested with AgeI and ligated into AgeI-digested pSG5-HSVgB-I671A/H681A/F683A (20) to generate pQF270. pSG5-HSVgB-I671A/H681A/F683A is a plasmid that carries the gB 3A mutant gene and contains a unique AgeI site located in the middle of the gB-encoding gene. The gB 3A-encoding gene containing a Kan r -encoding gene insert was amplified from pQF270 by PCR with primers ACAAACCAAAAGATGCACATGCGGTTTAACACCCGTGGTTTTTATTTACAACAA ACCCCCCGTCACAGGTCGTCCTCGTCGGCGTC and CCTCCAGCACCTCGCCCCCAGGCTACCTGACGGGGGGC ACGACGGGCCCCCGTAGTCCCGCCATGCACCAGGGCGCCCCCTCGTGG. By two-step red-mediated recombination, this PCR product was recombined into gB-null BAC pQF282 and then the Kan r cassette was recombined out to generate BAC pQF297, which carries the gB 3A mutant gene in place of WT gB (Fig. 1D) . At each step of the BAC constructions, the intermediate BACs with Kan r -encoding gene insertions and the final BACs were confirmed by at least four restriction enzyme digestions. gB Mutations That Impact Fusion ® BAC pQF297 was transfected into Vero cells expressing Cre recombinase by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The transfected cells were harvested 3 weeks after transfection, sonicated, and subsequently passaged on Vero cells to generate HSV-1 gB 3A stocks. gB 3A-1 and gB 3A-2 viruses were isolated from two separate transfections of pQF297, and both contain the same triple alanine mutation in gB, as confirmed by sequencing. WT GS3217 virus was harvested at 6 to 7 days posttransfection. Viral DNA was sequenced by the Northwestern Genomic core facility. Western blot assays. Western blot assays were performed to examine the expression of HSV-1 gB (50). Viruses harvested from Vero cells infected at an MOI of 0.01 were lysed in 200 l of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na 3 VO 3 , 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Proteins were boiled for 5 min under reducing conditions, separated by SDS-PAGE on 4 to 20% gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with anti-gB PAb R74 at a 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature, followed by IRDye 800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) at 1:10,000. The bands were visualized by Odyssey imaging (LI-COR). Incorporation of gB 3A into the virion was examined as previously reported (52) . Briefly, medium from infected Vero cells containing extracellular virus was subjected to low-speed centrifugation to pellet cells and debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 48,000 ϫ g for 1 h at 4°C over a 10% sucrose cushion. The pellet was dissolved in sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4 to 20% gel under reducing conditions. Western blot analysis was performed with R74 at a 1:10,000 dilution and anti-VP5 MAb (East Coast Bio) at a 1:2,000 dilution, followed by the addition of IRDye 800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) and IRDye 680LT donkey anti-mouse antibody at 1:10,000 (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Microscopy and determination of plaque size. Fluorescence microscopy of RFP expression in infected Vero cells was performed with an EVOS Cell Imaging System (AMG, Fisher Scientific). Plaques of both WT and gB 3A viruses were visualized by Giemsa (Sigma-Aldrich) staining after 3 days of incubation and then imaged by transmitted-light microscopy with an EVOS Cell Imaging System. Plaques size was calculated by using the EVOS Cell Imaging System. Randomly selected plaques were enlarged on a computer screen, and the average plaque radius was calculated from two independent measurements of at least 20 plaques. By using this average radius, the plaque area and the ratio of the plaque sizes of mutant and WT viruses were determined. Single-step growth curve analysis. To analyze viral replication kinetics, a single-step growth curve was determined as previously described (53, 54) . Briefly, Vero cells in six-well plates were infected with the HSV-1 gB 3A-1, HSV-1 3A-2, or GS3217 (WT) virus at 5 PFU/cell for 1 h. The inoculum was removed, and the cells were rinsed twice with PBS and then incubated at 37°C (time zero, binding time not included). After 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 h of incubation, cells were harvested and freeze-thawed at Ϫ40°C three times and virus titers were determined by plaque assay on Vero cells. Multiple-step growth curve analysis. Multiple-step growth curves were determined as previously described (55) . Vero cell monolayers in six-well plates were infected with HSV-1 gB 3A or GS3217 (WT) virus at 0.01 PFU/cell for 1 h. The inoculum was removed, and the cells were rinsed twice with PBS and then incubated at 37°C (time zero). At 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h of incubation, cells were harvested and freeze-thawed at Ϫ40°C three times and virus titers were determined by plaque assay on Vero cells. Virus cell penetration kinetics. To assay the cell entry of the HSV-1 gB 3A viruses, a cell penetration experiment was performed as previously described (56) . GS3217 (WT) virus or HSV-1 gB 3A viruses were diluted to 150 PFU/ml in PBS and allowed to adsorb to Vero cell monolayers in six-well plates for 1 h on ice, Cells were washed three times with cold PBS, and then 1 ml/well of medium prewarmed to 37°C or 40°C was added (time zero). Cells were incubated at 37°C or 40°C for up to 12 h. At the time points indicated, cells were treated for 1 min with citrate buffer (135 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 40 mM citric acid, pH 3.0) or with PBS as a control. The cells were carefully rinsed five times with PBS. The monolayers were overlaid with methylcellulose medium (0.5% methylcellulose in DMEM with 1% heat-inactivated serum [Sigma-Aldrich]) and incubated at 37°C for 3 days for HSV-1 3A viruses and WT virus. Plaques were visualized by Giemsa staining and counted under light microcopy. Virus binding assay. HSV-1 gB 3A or GS3217 (WT) virus was diluted to 200 PFU/ml in PBS with 1% heat-inactivated calf serum and 1% glucose, and 1 ml was added to Vero cell monolayers in six-well plates at 4°C or 37°C. Plates were incubated for 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, or 120 min. The cells were rinsed twice with PBS, overlaid with methylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) medium, and incubated at 37°C for 3 days. Plaques were detected by Giemsa staining. Plaque size determination after gB mutant complementation. Vero cells in six-well plates were transfected with 1,500 ng of the vector or a plasmid encoding gB 3A or gB 876T. After 24 h, cells were infected with about 200 PFU of gB 3A-1 or gB 3A-2 virus for 2 h, followed by methylcellulose overlay. After 3 days of incubation, plaques were visualized by Giemsa staining and imaged by transmitted-light microscopy with an EVOS Cell Imaging System. The radii of at least 40 randomly selected plaques were measured, and the plaque area was calculated on the basis of the radii. Cell-cell fusion assay. The cell-cell fusion assay was performed as previously described (49) . Briefly, CHO-K1 cells were seeded into six-well plates and incubated overnight. One set of cells (effectors) was transfected with plasmids encoding T7 RNA polymerase, gD, gH, and gL, as well as WT gB, mutant gB, or empty vector, using 5 l of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 400 ng of each plasmid. In some experiments, the total amount of gH and gL plasmid DNA transfected was titrated from 200 ng/well to 2 g/well. A second set of cells (targets) was transfected with 400 ng of a plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase-encoding gene under the control of the T7 promoter and 1.5 g of the empty vector or a plasmid encoding PILR␣, HVEM, or nectin-1 with 5 l of Lipofectamine 2000. After 6 h of transfection, the cells were detached with Versene and resuspended in 1.5 ml of F12 medium supplemented with 10%
