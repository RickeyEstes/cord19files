Workshop participants agreed that the primary impediment to broader acceptance and use of available nonanimal replacement methods is the associated cost and time required for each vaccine manufacturer to conduct a product-specific validation of the in vitro potency assay for each specific vaccine. In addition, the lack of international harmonization on alternative potency methods often means that the veterinary vaccine manufacturer must perform multiple potency release tests for the same vaccine depending on its point of manufacture and use. As a starting point, workshop participants recommended that regulatory agencies harmonize the general principles for the validation of alternative potency tests. In the United States, the CVB has issued general guidelines on the validation of in vitro potency assays [111] and relative potency assays and reference preparations based on ELISA antigen quantification [135] . International organizations also play an important role in this harmonization process. The International Cooperation on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products (VICH) is a trilateral program of collaboration among the regulatory authorities and animal health industries of the European Union, Japan, and the United States. The VICH aims to harmonize technical requirements for the registration of veterinary medicinal products by establishing and implementing specific guidelines after extensive input and review from national regulatory authorities. The VICH was established under the auspices of the World Organization of Animal Health (OIE), which participates as an associate member in the VICH process by supporting and disseminating the outcomes at a worldwide level (http://www.vichsec.org). As VICH guidelines are developed and reviewed by members of the international animal health community, there is increased acceptance of the regulatory principles that should facilitate faster and more uniform implementation. Examples of VICH guidelines that have been adopted by APHIS include VICH GL 41: Examination of Live Veterinary Vaccines in Target Animals for Absence of Reversion to Virulence (VICH 2007 (adopted by the U.S. in 2008) and GL 44: Target Animal Safety for Veterinary Live and Inactivated Vaccines (2008) (adopted in the U.S. in 2010). In addition, a draft guideline is in development by VICH to consider a waiver for the Target Animal Batch Safety Test [26] . In addition to harmonizing general principles, there is a need to harmonize the testing procedures for individual vaccine antigens, including development of the necessary reagents. For example, reference standards such as specific antibodies, viruses, bacteria, and antigens can be accessed from the CVB by U.S. entities to aid in the development of in vitro potency test assay development. Broad international availability of reference standards, supported by the national and regional regulatory authorities, would greatly help to convert animal-based tests to non-animal assays. Additionally, universal reference standards could be monitored and maintained by organizations such as the OIE, USDA, World Health Organization (WHO), or EDQM. The availability of reference standards is a key factor in the ability of vaccine manufacturers to switch to an in vitro replacement assay. For example, in an ELISA, the reference must be analyzed in conjunction with the sample so that a direct comparison of test vaccine to a known reference can be used to determine a relative potency. Relative potency is defined by the CVB as the potency of a product as determined by comparison with an approved reference [135] . For in vitro antigen potency assays, the unknown is typically compared with a working reference that was generated from the master reference. The master reference potency must have been previously correlated, directly or indirectly, to host animal immunogenicity. As the master reference is correlated to host immunogenicity, its relative stability must be monitored over time to ensure that the reference remains stable during storage. Currently, in the United States a frozen master reference is allowed a maximum dating of five years or, if stored under refrigeration, a maximum dating of two years [135] . After the dating period, each reference must be requalified in the host animal immunogenicity test. To avoid the use of additional animals for requalification, workshop participants recommended that requalification be conducted in any currently acceptable potency test. Development of new requalification tests is the responsibility of the vaccine manufacturer. This requires significant resources, especially in the development stage. Vaccine manufacturers cannot afford to dedicate these resources to products that are older and less profitable. Therefore, prioritization of veterinary vaccines for replacement testing and the potential availability of reference standards can significantly accelerate the animal test replacement process. Workshop participants recommended that stability monitoring for both products and reference standards be considered early in the development process. They recommended that regulatory authorities work with industry stakeholders to set expectations for the stability monitoring program [17] . The stability monitoring of references typically requires that multiple previously validated tests be conducted on a 3-, 6-, or 12-month schedule (Brown 2010, personal communication). As test methods change so might the stability monitoring methods and even the reference standard itself. Consequently, regulatory agencies may require flexibility to work with the vaccine manufacturers in bridging reference standards and methodologies as industry moves toward in vitro replacement assays. Regulatory guidance will also be required on the development and application of new technologies to the development of veterinary vaccines such as genetically engineered (rDNA) products, including inactivated/subunit, live (or inactivated) gene-deleted, or live vector (gene insertion) products [17] . Clearly, vaccine manufacturers must decide which products to prioritize for specific non-animal replacement potency testing. Typically, considering the output of industry resources, this decision is based upon product revenue and profitability. To aid in this process and to expedite replacement testing, sufficient resources are essential to develop and maintain reference standards specifically for industry use. In addition, broad accessibility of general procedural guidelines (as well as specific testing procedures) for individual antigens would further facilitate the international harmonization of replacement assay development and use.
