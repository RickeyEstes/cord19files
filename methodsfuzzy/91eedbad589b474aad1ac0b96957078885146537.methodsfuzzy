After extraction, RNA samples underwent quality control and miRNA was labeled using miRCURYTM Array Power Labeling kit (Cat #208032-A, Exiqon). The detailed steps are described as follows:One microgram RNA sample was added to 2 μL water, and then 1 μL CIP buffer and CIP enzyme (Exiqon) were added to the RNA sample solution, and the mixture solution was incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction in the sample solution was terminated at 95°C for 5 min, and then 3 μL labeling buffer, 1.5μL fluorescent label (Hy3 ™ ), 2.0 μL DMSO, and 2.0 μL labeling enzyme were added and the solution was incubated at 16°C for 1 h.The reaction in the samples was terminated at 65°C for 15 min. After labeling, the sample was hybridized with miRCURYTM LNA Array (v.18.0) (Exiqon), and the subsequent procedures were conducted according to Exiqon's experimental methods.the hybridization system used was the Nimblegen system (Nimblegen Systems Inc., Addison, WI, USA).The microarray chip was rinsed with Wash buffer kit (Exiqon) after hybridization.
