Sputum specimens were collected from children aged 6 months to 15 years with radiologically verified CAP treated in the Paediatric Infectious Disease Ward of Turku University Hospital (Turku, Finland) from January 2006 to April 2007. Pneumonia was defined as the presence of pneumonic infiltrates (alveolar or interstitial) on the chest radiograph with simultaneous signs and/or symptoms of acute infection. Sputum production was induced by inhalation of 5.0% hypertonic saline solution, and the sputum sample was obtained by aspirating through the nostrils (N = 69) or by expectoration if the child was old enough to produce an adequate sputum sample (N = 7). A good-quality sputum sample with <25 squamous epithelial cells and >25 leukocytes per low-power field was obtained from 76 of 133 children otherwise eligible for the study. The details of the sputum collection method and preliminary microbiological results have been described previously by Lahti et al. [9] . Viral antigen detection (influenza A and B viruses, PIV types 1, 2 and 3, RSV, and adenovirus (AdV)) by timeresolved fluoroimmunoassay, and nucleic acid detection by quantitative RT-PCR for enteroviruses, RV, RSV and HMPV, and quantitative PCR for HBoV, were performed as described previously [9] . We completed these viral studies to maximize the number and variety of viruses recovered from respiratory tract samples. Multiplex RT-PCR (Seeplex RV12 ACE Detection; Seegene, Seoul, Korea) was used for the detection of 12 respiratory pathogens (AdV, influenza A and B viruses, RSV A and B, HMPV, PIV types 1, 2 and 3, RV A and B, and coronaviruses 229E/NL63 and OC43/ HKU1) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequence analysis was used for RV species determination as described elsewhere [11] . In addition, quantitative RT-PCRs detecting human parechoviruses, PIV4, influenza C virus, and quantitative PCR for AdV, were performed in separate assays. The assay for human parechovirus has been described in detail elsewhere [12] . The assays for PIV4, influenza C virus, and AdV are described in the Supporting Information. Gram staining, semiquantitative bacterial culture, quantitative Streptococcus pneumoniae PCR on S. pneumoniae culturepositive samples, Mycoplasma pneumoniae PCR and the IgM immunoassay test for M. pneumoniae were previously performed as described by Lahti et al. [9] . We completed these bacterial studies by multiplex PCR (Prove-It Sepsis) searching for respiratory bacteria (S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes), performed by the manufacturer at Mobidiag (Helsinki, Finland) for 14 samples with negative results or only normal/mixed flora found in previous bacterial studies. All of the patients were previously immunized against H. influenzae type b, and therefore only non-typeable serogroups of H. influenzae were studied. Univariate associations between age and the frequency distribution of viral and bacterial pathogens were analysed with logistic regression. Univariate associations between the distributions of viral, bacterial and mixed viral-bacterial detections and the clinical picture of illness were studied with multinomial logistic regression analysis. The studied predictor variables were the patient's age, a white blood cell count and a serum C-reactive protein level on admission, Tsolia et al. [3] Cilla et al. [4] Hamano-Hasegawa et al. [7] Nascimento-Carvalho et al. [5] Samramsamruajkit et al. [13] Cevey-Macherel et al. [6] Wolf et al. [14] O'Callaghan-Gordo et al. [ and the highest fever during stay at hospital. Thereafter, a multiple multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed with all of the predictor variables simultaneously. Associations between viral, bacterial and mixed viral-bacterial detections and the chest radiograph were studied with Fisher's exact tests. For children with at least one virus, the univariate association between predictor variables and number of viruses was studied with logistic regression analysis. Thereafter, a multiple logistic regression analysis was performed with all of the predictor variables simultaneously. The clinical pictures of the most commonly found combinations of viruses and bacteria (the three most common viruses (RV, HBoV and HMPV) with one or more bacteria, and the three most common bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis) with one or more viruses) were compared by using one-way analysis of variance for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for chest radiographs. The statistical analyses were performed with SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC,USA). p-Values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of South-West Finland. Signed, informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians before enrolment.
