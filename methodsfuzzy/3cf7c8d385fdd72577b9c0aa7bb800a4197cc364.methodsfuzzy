After interviewing each subject, we collected a 5 mL blood sample for SARS antibody detection, refrigerated it at 4°C, and screened it for the SARS-CoV antibody using whole viral lysate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Beijing Huada GBI Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Beijing, China). 14, 15 If the ELISA test was positive, we used the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA; Euroimmun Co, Lübeck, Germany) to retest for the presence of the SARS-CoV antibody. [16] [17] [18] We performed an IgG test for the SARS-CoV by an indirect ELISA test that used the lysate of whole SARS-CoV as the coated antigen. 17 The cutoff value for a positive IgG test by ELISA was 0.13 absorbance units above the negative control. We performed IFA testing using a diluted serum specimen that reacted against SARS-CoVinfected Vero E6 cells and non-infected cells. 17, 18 First, we placed 25 μL of serial diluted serum (starting from 1:10) onto each well of the slide and incubated them for 30 minutes at room temperature. After washing for 5 minutes twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), we added 20 μL of diluted fluorescein-labeled anti-human globulin to each well, and incubated them for 30 minutes at room temperature. Then we washed the slides twice with PBS and observed samples under a fluorescence microscope. The cutoff value for a positive IgG test was 1:10.
