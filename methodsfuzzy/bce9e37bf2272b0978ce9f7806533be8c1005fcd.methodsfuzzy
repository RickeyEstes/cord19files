DS GeneAtlas is an automated high-throughput pipeline for the prediction of protein structure and function [5] . The pipeline consists of transmembrane domain prediction using TransMem [6] , domain prediction using HMMer and Pfam, sequence similarity search using PSI-BLAST, fold recognition using SeqFold [7] , and homology modeling using MODELER [8] . The con¢dence of the annotations is often judged based on the consensus of several methods. For structural annotation, 'Consensus Score' is used to rank the con¢dence of the annotation. 'Consensus Score' is de¢ned as 'Model Score' plus the sum of the active site percentage identity minus a threshold factor of 0.2 where the sum is over all the reported active site records in template PDB ¢le. If there is no active site record in template, 'Consensus Score' is the same as 'Model Score'. The con¢dence is high if 'Consensus Score' is greater than 1.0, the con¢dence is medium if the 'Consensus Score' is between 0.0 and 1.0, and the con¢dence is low if 'Consensus Score' is less than 0. con¢dence is high; if e-value is between 0.1 and 1e35 and the bit score is better than the noise cuto¡ [9] , the con¢dence is medium; otherwise, the con¢dence is low. Polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are cleaved by a 3CL main protease and the papain-like accessory proteinase. We used the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab as well as the cleaved products de¢ned by the putative cleavage site as input to DS GeneAtlas. M pro cleavage sites were identi¢ed using the [GAVSTP]XLQ[SAGN] motif, with cleavage occurring immediately after the Gln residue [10, 11] yielding 11 cleavage sites. The papain-like protease (PLP) cleavage sites were identi¢ed only in the ¢rst (N-terminal) product of M pro cleavage (residues 13 240). Using the motif [RK]XXXG[GA], which is most consistent with all known data about PLP cleavage sites in coronaviruses [12, 13] , six cleavage sites were found.
