The methodology of this literature review follows the framework of a qualitative systematic review (14) . The literature review aims to identify, evaluate, and summarize the findings of relevant research studies, thereby making the available evidence more accessible to decision makers, other stakeholders, and the scientific community. When appropriate, combining the results of several studies can give a more reliable and precise estimate of the available knowledge, intervention, or control measures' effectiveness than one study alone. The methodology of the literature review has four main components: (1) identifying and selecting research evidence, (2) data extraction and quality assessment, (3) data synthesis, and (4) report writing (14) .
