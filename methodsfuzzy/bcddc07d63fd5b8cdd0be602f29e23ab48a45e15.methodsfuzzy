For closely related protein sequences with identities higher than 30-40%, the alignments produced by all methods are almost always largely correct. The quickest way to search for suitable templates in this regime is to use simple pairwise Figure 2 Comparative protein structure modeling. (a) A flowchart illustrating the steps in the construction of a comparative model. 23 (b) Description of comparative modeling by extraction of spatial restraints as implemented in MODELLER. 96 By default, spatial restraints in MODELLER involve: (1) homology-derived restraints from the aligned template structures; (2) statistical restraints derived from all known protein structures; and (3) stereochemical restraints from the CHARMM-22 molecular mechanics force field. These restraints are combined into an objective function that is then optimized to calculate the final 3D structure of the target sequence. sequence alignment methods such as SSEARCH, 35 BLAST, 36 and FASTA. 35 Brenner et al. showed that these methods detect only B18% of the homologous pairs at less than 40% sequence identity, while they identify more than 90% of the relationships when sequence identity is between 30% and 40%. 37 Another benchmark, based on 200 reference structural alignments with 0-40% sequence identity, indicated that BLAST is able to correctly align only 26% of the residue positions. 46  The sensitivity of the search and accuracy of the alignment become progressively difficult as the relationships move into the twilight zone. 34, 38 A significant improvement in this area was the introduction of profile methods by Gribskov and co-workers. 39 The profile of a sequence is derived from a multiple sequence alignment and specifies residue-type occurrences for each alignment position. The information in a multiple sequence alignment is most often encoded as either a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) 36, 40, 41 or as a hidden Markov model (HMM). 42, 43 In order to identify suitable templates for comparative modeling, the profile of the target sequence is used to search against a database of template sequences. The profile-sequence methods are more sensitive in detecting related structures in the twilight zone than the pairwise sequence-based methods; they detect approximately twice the number of homologs under 40% sequence identity. [44] [45] [46] The resulting profile-sequence alignments correctly align approximately 43-48% of residues in the 0-40% sequence identity range 46, 47 ; this number is almost twice as large as that of the pairwise sequence methods. Frequently used programs for profile-sequence alignment are PSI-BLAST, 36 SAM, 48 HMMER, 42 and BUILD PROFILE. 49  As a natural extension, the profile-sequence alignment methods have led to profile-profile alignment methods that search for suitable template structures by scanning the profile of the target sequence against a database of template profiles, as opposed to a database of template sequences. These methods have proven to include the most sensitive and accurate fold assignment and alignment protocols to date. 47, [50] [51] [52] Profile-profile methods detect B28% more relationships at the superfamily level and improve the alignment accuracy by 15-20% compared to profile-sequence methods. 47, 53 There are a number of variants of profile-profile alignment methods that differ in the scoring functions they use. 47, 50, [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] However, several analyses have shown that the overall performances of these methods are comparable. 47, [50] [51] [52] Some of the programs that can be used to detect suitable templates are FFAS, 60 SP3, 53 SALIGN, 47 and PPSCAN. 49 4.10.2.1.6 Sequence-structure threading methods As the sequence identity drops below the threshold of the twilight zone, there is usually insufficient signal in the sequences or their profiles for the sequence-based methods discussed above to detect true relationships. 44 Sequencestructure threading methods are most useful in this regime as they can sometimes recognize common folds, even in the absence of any statistically significant sequence similarity. 21 These methods achieve higher sensitivity by using structural information derived from the templates. The accuracy of a sequence-structure match is assessed by the score of a corresponding coarse model and not by sequence similarity, as in sequence comparison methods. 21 The scoring scheme used to evaluate the accuracy is either based on residue substitution tables dependent on structural features such as solvent exposure, secondary structure type, and hydrogen bonding properties, 53,61-63 or on statistical potentials for residue interactions implied by the alignment. [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] The use of structural data does not have to be restricted to the structure side of the aligned sequence-structure pair. For example, SAM-T02 makes use of the predicted local structure for the target sequence to enhance homolog detection and alignment accuracy. 69 Commonly used threading programs are GenTHREADER, 61,70 3D-PSSM, 71 Yet another strategy is to optimize the alignment by iterating over the process of calculating alignments, building models, and evaluating models. Such a protocol can sample alignments that are not statistically significant and identify the alignment that yields the best model. Although this procedure can be time-consuming, it can significantly improve the accuracy of the resulting comparative models in difficult cases. 72 alignment errors. Improving the performance and accuracy of methods in this regime remains one of the main tasks of comparative modeling today. 73 It is imperative to calculate an accurate alignment between the target-template pair, as comparative modeling can almost never recover from an alignment error. 74  There are two main classes of loop-modeling methods: (1) database search approaches that scan a database of all known protein structures to find segments fitting the anchor core regions 90, 107 ; and (2) conformational search approaches that rely on optimizing a scoring function. [108] [109] [110] There are also methods that combine these two approaches. 111 The database search approach to loop modeling is accurate and efficient when a database of specific loops is created to address the modeling of the same class of loops, such as b-hairpins, 113 or loops on a specific fold, such as the hypervariable regions in the immunoglobulin fold. 107, 114 There are attempts to classify loop conformations into more general categories, thus extending the applicability of the database search approach. [115] [116] [117] However, the database methods are limited because the number of possible conformations increases exponentially with the length of a loop. As a result, only loops up to 4-7 residues long have most of their conceivable conformations present in the database of known protein structures. 118, 119 This limitation is made even worse by the requirement for an overlap of at least one residue between the database fragment and the anchor core regions, which means that modeling a 5-residue insertion requires at least a 7-residue fragment from the database. 89 Despite the rapid growth of the database of known structures, it does not seem possible to cover most of the conformations of a 9-residue segment in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, most of the insertions in a family of homologous proteins are shorter than 10-12 residues. 98 To overcome the limitations of the database search methods, conformational search methods were developed. 108, 109 There are many such methods, exploiting different protein representations, objective functions, and optimization or enumeration algorithms. The search algorithms include the minimum perturbation method, 120 molecular dynamics simulations, 111,121 genetic algorithms, 122 Monte Carlo and simulated annealing, 123-125 multiple-copy simultaneous search, 126 self-consistent field optimization, 127 and enumeration based on graph theory. 128 The accuracy of loop predictions can be further improved by clustering the sampled loop conformations and partially accounting for the entropic contribution to the free energy. 129 Another way of improving the accuracy of loop predictions is to consider the solvent effects. Improvements in implicit solvation models, such as the Generalized Born solvation model, motivated their use in loop modeling. The solvent contribution to the free energy can be added to the scoring function for optimization, or it can be used to rank the sampled loop conformations after they are generated with a scoring function that does not include the solvent terms. 98 Two simplifications are frequently applied in the modeling of side-chain conformations. 133 First, amino acid residue replacements often leave the backbone structure almost unchanged, 26 allowing us to fix the backbone during the search for the best side-chain conformations. Second, most side chains in high-resolution crystallographic structures can be represented by a limited number of conformers that comply with stereochemical and energetic constraints. 134  It is crucial for method developers and users alike to assess the accuracy of their methods. An attempt to address this problem has been made by the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Proteins Structure Prediction (CASP) 170 and the Critical Assessment of Fully Automated Structure Prediction (CAFASP) experiments. 171 However, both CASP and CAFASP assess methods only over a limited number of target protein sequences. 102, 172 To overcome this limitation, two additional evaluation experiments have been described, LiveBench 172 and EVA. 173, 174 EVA is a large-scale and continuously running web server that automatically assesses protein structure prediction servers in the categories of secondary structure prediction, residue-residue contact prediction, fold assignment, and comparative modeling. The aims of EVA are: (1) to evaluate continuously and automatically blind predictions by prediction servers, based on identical and sufficiently large data sets; (2) to provide weekly updates of the method assessments on the web; and (3) to enable developers, nonexpert users, and reviewers to determine the performance of the tested prediction servers.
