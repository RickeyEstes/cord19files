Animals. Healthy New Zealand rabbits weighing 2.5-3 kg and aged 2-3 months were provided by the Experimental Animal Centre of Shanghai Jiao Tong University affiliated Sixth People's Hospital (Shanghai, China). Animals were maintained in single cages at a controlled temperature (15-25˚C)under a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed with a standard diet. Animals received humane care in compliance with the Guide of the US Department of Health for the care and use of laboratory animals (23) . The experiment protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Isolation and culture of ASCs. Primary ASCs were harvested from the adipose tissue of New Zealand rabbits. Briefly, the animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (3 mg/100 g; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Adipose tissues were harvested and digested with 0.1% collagenase I (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. The complex was filtered with a 100-µm nylon mesh (Shanghai Bolting Cloth Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) and centrifuged at room temperature for 30 min at 363 x g The cells were then resuspended with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA), and were plated on culture flask (Corning Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA, USA). The cells were cultured at 37˚C in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator. The culture medium was replaced every 3 days, and non-adherent cells were removed. The cells were passaged approximately at a 1:3 split at subconfluence. The cells of four to six passages were used for the following experiments. Western blot analysis. To evaluate the influence of DMOG (Sigma-Aldrich) on the expression of HIF-1α protein in ASCs, the cells were seeded on six-well plates at 3x10 5 cells/well and regular medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) was added with different concentrations of DMOG (0, 200, 500 and 1,000 µM). After 1, 3 and 7 days, total protein was harvested from the cultured cells according to standard protocols (24) . Briefly, cells were washed three times with (PBS; Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), and then solubilized in lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) at 4˚C for 10 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 15 min. The supernatants were collected and stored at -80°C. The protein concentration was measured using a bicinchoninic protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Proteins (10 µg) from each sample were then separated using 12% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. They were then blocked in 5% non-fat milk at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibodies against HIF-1α (1:800; ab1; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) were added to incubate with the membranes at 4˚C overnight. Then, infrared-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000; ab97040; Abcam) were added to incubate with the membranes for 1 h at room temperature. The resulting membranes were scanned in an Odyssey Scanner (Li-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA), and quantified using Odyssey software version 3.0. The protein levels were normalized against those of β-actin (1:500; ab6276; Abcam). Preparation of transplanted composite. A self-assembling peptide gel (BeaverNano TM hydrogel; Cyagen Biosciences, Inc., Guangzhou, China) was used as the scaffold for loading ASCs. The transplanted composite was prepared by mixing cells with the hydrogels according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 1x10 7 ASCs were suspended in 1 ml 10% sucrose solution (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), and the cell suspension was mixed with the hydrogels in an equal volume. Then, PBS was slowly added to the mixed hydrogel composites in an equal volume and incubated for 30 min at room temperature to allow cross-linking. For the DMOG-treated ASCs, cells were cultured in regular medium with 1,000 µM DMOG for 24 h prior to being mixed with the hydrogel. To ensure ASCs were continuously exposed to DMOG after implantation into the femoral head, 1,000 µM DMOG was added to PBS during the composite mixing procedure. Animal ONFH model and treatment protocol. A total of 50 New Zealand rabbits (age, 2-3 months) were used to established ONFH models according to previously reported protocols (25) . In brief, one injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 µg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) was administered intravenously at day 1, then three injections of methylprednisolone (MPS; 20 mg/kg; Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY, USA) were administered intramuscularly at days 2, 3 and 4. Six rabbits died of the inductive protocol after the injection. ONFH was confirmed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) at 6 weeks after the last injection of MPS. The stage of ONFH was evaluated respectively by two experienced radiologists in a blinded fashion. Then the rabbits with early-stage ONFH were randomly divided into four groups: i) Group I (n=11) did not receive any therapy and served as controls; ii) Group II (n=11) only received core decompression of the femoral head; iii) Group III (n=11) received core decompression and normal ASC transplantation; and iv) Group IV (n=11) received core decompression and DMOG-treated ASC transplantation. Surgical procedure and perfusion. The surgical procedure was performed as previously reported (26) . In brief, the animals were anesthetized with intravenous pentobarbital, and a lateral approach was made to expose the greater trochanter under aseptic conditions. A drill with an diameter of 1 mm was inserted at the flare of the greater trochanter and into the necrotic area of the femoral head, assisted by a C-arm X-ray machine. The necrotic tissue was then removed completely, and the cell-hydrogel composites were transplanted into the necrotic area through the bone tunnel made by drill for Groups III and IV. The bone tunnel was sealed with an absorbable collagen sponge plug, and the wound was closed in layers. Following the operation, animals received gentamicin (80 MU/day; Shanghai No.1 Biochemical & Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) intramuscularly as prophylaxis for 3 days, and all animals were free to move. Four weeks after the surgery, animals were anesthetized with intravenous pentobarbital. The abdominal cavity of the rabbits was opened. A syringe needle was inserted in the abdominal aorta distal to the heart, and the abdominal aorta proximal to the heart was ligated. Then the abdominal vein was cut open, and heparinized normal saline (Shanghai No.1 Biochemical & Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) was injected in the vasculature through the needle at a flow speed of ~20 mm/min. When the outflow was limpid, a silicone injection compound (MICROFIL MV-122; Flow Tech, Inc., Carver, MA, USA) was pumped into the vasculature of the femoral head. The animals were then stored at 4˚C to ensure polymerization of the contrast agent. After 1 h, the proximal parts of the femurs were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.
