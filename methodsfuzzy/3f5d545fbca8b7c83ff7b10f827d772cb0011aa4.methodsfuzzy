Consecutive patients with AECOPD who applied to the Konya Numune Hospital Pulmonology Department, Konya, Turkey, from September 2012 to December 2013 and who were ambulatory or undergoing inpatient treatment were included in this study. The patients were diagnosed with COPD according to GOLD 2011 criteria. The existence of three criteria described previously, dyspnea, sputum volume, and increase in sputum purulence, was searched in the diagnosis of acute exacerbation. 11 Patients with a history of antibiotic use in the last 10 days, accompanying bronchiectasis (verified with high-resolution computed tomography), pneumonia, immunosuppression, malignancy, and congestive heart failure were not included in the study. CAT and a pulmonary function test, which is in accordance with the American Thoracic Society, were provided to the patients. All pulmonary function tests were performed by the same technician after the administration of 400 µg salbutamol while the patient was stable. The exacerbation history was noted. The combined COPD assessment scaling was applied according to GOLD 2011 criteria. Patients were divided into four groups, GOLD A, B, C, and D. Sputum samples were taken from patients to a sterile container after rinsing the mouth and throat and were analyzed microscopically by Gram staining without waiting. Sputum samples that were observed to have fewer than ten epithelial cells and more than 25 leukocytes in each area upon 100× magnification were included in the study as appropriate sputum samples. All patients were informed about the study. Their written consents were taken. The consent of the Selçuk University Meram Medical Faculty Ethics Committee was taken for the study.
