Plant material preparation, RNA extraction, and library preparation All nine tissues for L. japonica, namely, shoot apex, stem, leaf-1 (youngest leaf near shoot apex), leaf-2 (second leaf), Homologs for all genes from secoiridoid metabolic pathways were identified in L. japonica transcriptome assembly, and were highly correlated. Highest expression was observed in leaf-1 and shoot apex leaf-3 (mature leaf), green floral bud, white floral bud, white flower, and yellow flower were harvested in June 2014. L. japonica plants were cultivated in the natural environment of Chiba University pharmaceutical garden, Chiba (located at 35°36 0 17.7 00 N; 140°08 0 06.9 00 E). All tissues from L. japonica were harvested on ice, cut into small pieces, and were snap-freezed by liquid N 2 before storing at -80°C prior to RNA extraction. The frozen tissues from L. japonica were powdered using a multi-bead shocker (Yasui Kikai, Japan), and were used for subsequent extraction of total RNA using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality was assessed using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technology, USA), and RNA samples with RNA integrity number (RIN) above 8 were used for cDNA library preparation. mRNA for each sample was isolated from the total RNA by using beads with oligo (dT), and were added with fragmentation buffer to shear mRNA into short fragments, which were then used as a template for the synthesis of first-strand cDNA using random hexamer primers. cDNA library for Illumina sequencing was prepared using SureSelect Strand specific RNA library kit (Agilent Technology, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Illumina sequencing and pre-processing of raw reads A cDNA library was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq TM 2000 sequencer (Illumina Inc., USA) to obtain paired-end reads with an average length of 101 bps. cDNA library preparation and sequencing were performed at Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan. The raw read sequences, transcriptome assembly, and RSEM-based transcript abundance data for nine tissues of L. japonica discussed in this study have been deposited in the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE81949. Raw reads thus obtained through Illumina sequencing were pre-processed using the Trimmomatic program [42] for the removal of adaptor sequences, empty reads, reads with ambiguous 'N' base [5 %, low-quality raw reads (Phred score \20), and raw reads with an average length \50 bps. The clean reads thus obtained were in the form of paired reads, or unpaired clean reads (forward and reverse), and were all used to perform de novo transcriptome assembly.
