The E. coli strains, DH5α and BL-21 (λCE6), were purchased from Shanghai Dingguo Co. All primers were synthesized by Shanghai Ding'an Co. The bacterial protein expression vector, pET-32a, was purchased from Novagen (Darmstadt, Germany). Restriction enzymes and nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3 -indolyphosphate ptoluidine salt (BCIP) were obtained from Promega (Madison, USA). Taq DNA polymerase and the related PCR reagents were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, USA). Ni-NTA resin was purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). The antibody anti-human IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was purchased from Beijing Zhongshan Company. Sera of SARS patients were from hospitals in Beijing and the control sera were obtained from healthy volunteers. The clinical diagnostic criteria for SARS followed the Clinical Description of SARS were released by WHO. The SARS-CoV BJ01 strain cultured by the Microbe Epidemic Institute in Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences was used in this research. Its genome was sequenced by Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). All of the S protein fragments were designed based upon this genomic sequence (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, GI: 30275666). The SARS virus was propagated on Vero-E6 cells as described before in the Microbe Epidemic Institute (23 ) . After viral propagation, the cells were harvested and placed at 70˚C for 2 h to inactivate the virus. The inactivated infected Vero-E6 cells in culture medium were concentrated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) 20,000 followed by cell lysis and protein denatureation with 8 M urea. The cell lysate was further sonicated with a probe sonicator and centrifuged at 13,000 g to remove the insoluble debris. The supernatant was used for Western blot and ELISA determinations. The amino acid sequence of the S protein was downloaded into the ProtScale program at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) to analyze the physical characteristics of the proteins, such as hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, accessible residues, buried residues, MW, and pI values. Forty-one peptides ranging in size from 16 to 25 amino acid residues were selected for synthesis. All of the peptides were synthesized commercially by Chinese Peptide Co., Hangzhou. The synthesized peptides were characterized by HPLC and mass spectrometry. The viral genomic RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out as described in the company manual (Superscript TM kit). Two pairs of primers were designed to amplify S 469−749 and S 602−882 fragments based upon the open reading frame (ORF) of the S gene from BJ01 SARS genome. Specifically, the sequences of these primers are, 5 CGGATCCCCACCTGCTCTTAATTGTTA (S 469−749 forward with a BamH I restriction site at the 5 end), 5 CCGCTCGAGGAGTGCACGATTTA-GTTGTGT (S 469−749 reverse with a Xho I restriction site at the 3 end), 5 CGGGATCCAACTGCACTGA-TGTTTCTACA (S 602−882 forward with a BamH I restriction site at the 5 end), and CCGCTCGAG-GCATAGCAAAAGGTATTTGAAG (S 602−882 re-verse with a Xho I restriction site at the 3 end). PCR products and pET-32a vector were excised with BamH I and Xho I overnight at 37˚C, purified from agarose gel and ligated with each other at room temperature for 3 h. The ligation products were transformed into DH5α strains. The expression vectors with S gene insertions were checked first by restriction digestion and further confirmed by DNA sequencing. The correct vectors were transformed into BL-21 (λCE6) for protein expression (24 ) . Two transformed BL-21 stains containing the expression vectors, pET32a-S 469−749 and PET32a-S 469−749 , were inoculated into 500 mL of LB broth containing kanamycin of 100 µg/mL. Being shaken, the cultures grew to an optical density of 0.6-0.8 at 600 nm at 37C, and IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. The bacteria were incubated at 37˚C for additional 4-6 h and harvested, followed by centrifugation at 4,000 g for 10 min to get the bacterial pellets. The pellets were resuspended in a 10-mL binding buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 200 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole. The buffer was then lysed by sonication for 3 min. The bacterial pellets containing inclusion bodies were dissolved in the binding buffer containing 8 M urea. The recombinant proteins were purified with an affinity chromatography, Ni-NTA (Qiagen), with 100 mM imidazole. The recombinant proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked by 3% BSA in Tris 100 mM, NaCl 120 mM, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.9 (TTBS), and then were incubated with the sera from SARS patients as the primary antibody. An anti-human IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was used as the second antibody. The immunoprecipitated bands were developed using a substrate mixture of NBT and BCIP. ELISA experiments were carried out according to conventional protocol. In brief, the purified fusion protein was mixed with sample dilution buffer, embedded in 96-well ELISA plates, and incubated at 37˚C for 30 min. Then the wells were washed for five times with washing buffer and incubated with the sera from either SARS patients or normal controls. Each well was washed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG at 37˚C for 20 min. Finally the wells were washed again with PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20. The peroxidase reaction was visualized using the o-pheylenediamine solution as substrate. After 10 min of incubation at 37˚C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 µL of 4 M sulphuric acid, and optical density at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 630 nm was measured by using an automatic ELISA plate reader (Multiskan Microplate Photometer, Finland). On SDS-PAGE, the protein bands stained by Commassie Blue corresponding to the immunostaining signals in Western blot were excised, successively destained and dehydrated with 50% acetonitrile. The proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT at 56˚C for 1 h and alkylated by 55 mM iodoacetamide in dark at room temperature for 45 min. Finally, the gel slices were thoroughly washed with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate in water/acetonitrile (50/50) solution and were completely dried in a Speedvac. Proteins were digested in 25 µL of modified trypsin solution (10 ng/µL in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate) by incubation overnight at 37˚C. The digested peptides were directly loaded and analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a LCQ Deca XP ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, Finland). A linear gradient elution program was conducted to separate the peptides, delivering buffer A (0.1% formic acid in water) from 98% to 20% and buffer B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) from 2% to 60% within 66 min. After HPLC, the eluant was split and introduced to the mass spectrometer with a flow rate of about 2 µL/min. The spray voltage was 3.2 kV and the heated desolvation capillary was set to 150˚C. The m/z range from 400-2,000 was scanned in 1.2 sec, and the ions were detected with a high energy Conversion Dynode detector. The LC-MS/MS data were converted into DTA-format files and submitted to the searching software, TurboSEQUEST. Protein searches were performed by comparing experimental data with the protein database of SARS-coronavirus generated by Beijing Genomics Institute.
