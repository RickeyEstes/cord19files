This section mainly focuses on the methodology of the feasibility study experiment of heart rate extraction using a digital camera. Previous databases such as MANHOB-HCI database [21] , have presented data which exhibit physical motion regarding moving the head while the body remained static. Also, previous database provided emotion variations which also exhibits motion variations only with respect to the muscles movements in the face. Most of the existing databases are compiled under controlled environment. The aim of our study is to generate heart rate measurement database under realistic environment. Our experiment involved various scenarios that were similar to real-world situations emulating a realistic situation. The database resulting from our experiment intended to investigate the effect of four real-world situations that would help us understand improve reliability of the methods for heath monitoring. The data was collected for two scenarios mainly; humancomputer interaction scenario (i.e. a person sitting in front of a compute and interacting with the computer), and health monitoring scenario. The human-computer interaction scenario investigate the feasibility of issues related to real world situations; effect of Illumination variance, motion variance and the effect of different skin tone of the subject. The health monitoring scenario investigate the feasibility of heart rate measurement for subjects from various distances from the camera sensor. The health monitoring scenario was conducted by using a surveillance cameras setup. During the experiment, 45 healthy subjects were used for data collection. The subjects were separated into three groups based on the skin tones (i.e. Fair, Brown and Black). The subject's age varied from 21 to 63 with a mean of 29.77 years and standard deviation of 7.88 years. Two camera sensors were used to collect data in RGB color space. Camera sensor one denoted as 'cam1'is a Bayer mosaic 24-bit RGB camera which records data at 30 fps with a resolution of 1080 Â 1920. The camera was mounted at 120 cm from the ground with 90 degree angle. Camera sensor two denoted as 'cam2'is also a Bayer mosaic 24-bit RGB camera which records data at 30 fps with a resolution of 1080 Â 1920. The camera was mounted at 240 cm from the ground with 59 degree angle. The camera sensor information is tabulated in Table 1 . The ground truth heart rate was captured using a pulse oximeter. The WristOx2 model 3150 wrist-worn pulse oximeter by Nonin Medical [22] , was used to collect the heart rate (see Fig. 2 ). The device was highly accurate during clinical tests and during lab tests with a MDA (Medical Device Authority) approved DANTESTT DT-HW5 ECG device. The oximeter was strapped to the wrist of the subject, and the heart rate measuring sensor was attached to the index finger of the subject. The subject was asked to wear the pulse oximeter throughout the experiment, and the heart rate was monitored individually for each session in units of beats per minute (bpm).
