Thomas has thoroughly reviewed a broad range of study designs for G × E interaction protocols (Thomas, 2010a, b) , updating earlier methods reviews (Kraft and Hunter, 2005; Yang and Khoury, 1997) . Among the standard case-control, cohort, nested case-control, and case-cohort epidemiological study designs, cohort studies have the desirable feature of longitudinal exposure data collection. Counter-matching and two-phase designs permit stratification jointly on disease and exposure status, based on sampling probabilities. A variant that counter-matches each case with three controls on surrogates for both exposure and genotype can be substantially more efficient than counter-matching only on exposure, only on genotype, or neither. Family-based designs, including case and parents triads, generate a higher proportion of genotype-concordant, exposure-discordant case-control pairs than in usual case-control series. Mendelian randomization separately tests the associations of an environmentally modifiable intermediate variable and a disease with a gene that appears to influence it. For example, the gene MTHFR governs a critical step in folate metabolism; the genotype acts as an instrumental variable under the assumption that the gene has no effect on the disease independent of the intermediate phenotype (the enzyme activity). Emerging methods focus on multiple genes and multiple environmental factors related to biomarkers, pathways, modules, and functional systems. Hierarchical Bayes modeling is well suited to these studies. Applications include the WECARE study of radiotherapy-associated risk of second breast cancers in relation to DNA damage response pathways, and colon cancer candidate gene studies in relation to folate. Challenge studies in exposure chambers are feasible to study some kinds of environmental exposures. For example, atopic individuals have been studied for effects of diesel exhaust particles and allergens on immunologic markers, using a double-blind factorial randomized crossover design; individuals with either GSTM1 null or GSTP I105 genotype had higher IgE levels in response to either exposure, and still higher levels if they had both genotypes (Gilliland et al., 2004) . Ancillary studies in randomized clinical trials can be efficient designs as well, since both treatment and genotype are randomly assigned. Subsets can be genotyped based on their treatments or outcomes, or can be selected for biomarker measurements based on treatment and genotype. Exposure assessment is critical to G × E studies, as it is for environmental epidemiology generally. Exposure variables are often complex, with continuous scales of measurement that are time-dependent, multidimensional, spatially correlated, and sometimes available only at an aggregate level, as with ambient air pollutants. With ambient measurements, exposure doses for individuals must be imputed or predicted with models using time-activity and dispersion patterns, potential chemical modifications, subsample data, and transport and fate mapping. Much larger samples are required for interactions than for detection of main effects, typically at least four times larger (Thomas, 2010b) . Measurement errors and uncertainties of exposure estimates put conclusions about G × E interactions at risk. Another complication is the use of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), because individual genes often have multiple variants. Thus, haplotype analysis is more reliable and more efficient. Genetic, environmental, and behavioral variables jointly influence the risks of many diseases and traits. It is hard enough to discover, confirm, validate, and generalize across populations robust single-factor disease associations. Doseresponse relationships for genotypes and especially for environmental exposures are critical to obtaining credible evidence. In quantitative terms, two or more different risk factors (genetic or non-genetic) can appear to interact in several ways: l They may each give statistically and clinically significant increases in risk of onset (or severity of progression) of the disease; the effects of the interaction between factors a and b may then be additive (a + b) or synergistic (>>a + b), as, for example, in the case of cigarette smoking and occupational asbestos exposure in causing lung cancers. l Neither of the risk factors may be detectable as increasing incidence rates for the disease, but the two together may do so, as in the case of red meat and NAT2 (see later). l One of the factors may be predisposing silently, while the other may increase the risk, as with alcohol or smoking.
