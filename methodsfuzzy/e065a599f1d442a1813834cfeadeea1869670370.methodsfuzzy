This open-label, single-dose, randomized-sequence, 2-period crossover study was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, People's Republic of China. The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments 12 for biomedical research involving human subjects and the principles of the Good Clinical Practice guideline. 13 The clinical protocol and the informed-consent form were approved by the local ethics committees at China Medical University. To investigate the specificity and selectivity of the HPLC-MS/MS method, blank human plasma samples, spiked plasma samples, and subject samples were prepared and analyzed. Chromatography findings are shown in Figure 1 . The arbidol and diazepam retention times were 1.7 and 2.8 minutes, respectively, suggesting that no endogenous peaks at the retention time of arbidol and IS interfered with the determination. The calibration curves of arbidol in human plasma were obtained using 6 calibration standards, each of which was prepared in triplicate and extracted together with blank samples and quality control (QC) After a 1-week washout period, subjects returned to the clinical unit, where the alternative formulation was administered and blood samples were drawn as before so as to complete the crossover design.
