The method involves respectively scoring the severity of clinical signs, transmission of the infection, number of cases, and the infection source ( Table 1 ). The scores of the four aspects of an outbreak are multiplied together and the resulting product represents the severity of the outbreak. A higher product indicates a more serious outbreak, with products in the ranges of 1-14, 15-29, 30-59, 60-119, 120-200, 200-450 rating the severity of the outbreak as grade I, grade II, grade III, grade IV, grade V, and grade VI, respectively. For example, if a total of 27 people are infected in an outbreak with mild clinical signs, likely with transmission among frequent close contacts, and the outbreak is linked to sheep (though no clear evidence has been found), the final score of the outbreak is 24 (= 2 Â 3 Â 2 Â 2), which suggests the outbreak is of grade II severity. In the method, a case is defined as a person suspected to be infected with the same known or unknown pathogen by a medical professional entity, like a hospital, a medical research institute, or the health section of the local government. Generally speaking, grade I, grade II, grade III, grade IV, grade V, and grade VI indicate that the outbreak is mild, moderate, severe, very severe, highly severe, and extremely severe. Moreover, if an outbreak is rated grade III (severe), it is assumed to be a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), and should be reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), according to the new International Health Regulations adopted in 2005. 6
