Hierarchical combination of ligand and structure-based VS approaches generally involves sequential execution of dissimilar VS methods. Mostly, computationally inexpensive ligand based approaches such as similarity search and pharmacophore screening are used during initial steps of an HLVS protocol. Methods demanding comparatively high computational resources such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation are used once the number of compounds to be screened decreases to a reasonable number. The final step in a majority of HLVS campaigns incorporates the visual selection of compounds by expert researcher commonly known as ''cherry picking''. In this step, ranking from VS methods is combined with expert chemical intuition and with literature-based knowledge. The HLVS can be classified in three categories based on the combination of VS methods: ligand-based HLVS, structure-based HLVS and hybrid HLVS, which will be described in detail below. A few successful cases of small molecule discovery using these three classes of HLVS are summarized in Table 1 .
