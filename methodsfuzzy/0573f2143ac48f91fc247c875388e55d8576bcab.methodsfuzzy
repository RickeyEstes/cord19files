In this review, relevant articles in the fields of biological hazards, industrial hygiene, and epidemiology were found using PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), Google Scholar (http:// scholar.google.com), and ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com). Keywords were used to locate relevant articles, and the following is an example of a typical search: biohazard AND workplace AND worker OR environment OR occupation AND health OR industry. These searches yielded more than 150 articles, which were further reviewed for occupational content. At the end of this selection process, 83 articles were deemed relevant to this review, and they were examined with particular emphasis on three topics: biological hazards, biological hazards associated with industries, and protection of workers against biological factors or their prevention. Prospects of industries that depend on biohazards and the significance of preventive health and safety measures in these industries have also been discussed here.
