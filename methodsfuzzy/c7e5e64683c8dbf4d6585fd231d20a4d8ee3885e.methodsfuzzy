Cell culture. 17Cl-1 cells, HeLa cells expressing MHV receptor carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1a) (HeLa-MHVR), and baby hamster kidney cells expressing CEACAM1a (BHK-MHVR) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Pen-Strep), 2% sodium bicarbonate, 2% L-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% sodium pyruvate (D10). Low-serum medium is the same as D10 with 2% fetal calf serum (D2). Mice. Pathogen-free C57BL/6 (B6) and BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. B6 interferon alpha/beta receptor-knockout (IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ ) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, and Toll-like receptor 7-knockout (TLR7 Ϫ/Ϫ ) mice were obtained from Shizuo Akira (Osaka University) via Westley Reeves (University of Florida). Mice were bred in the animal care facility at the University of Iowa. Animal studies were approved by the University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Generation of recombinant viruses. pBAC-rJHMV PSϪ and pBAC-rJHMV Nsp15-HA were created using pBAC-rJHM.IA, by Red recombination, and using the primers listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Using gBlock fragments with the corresponding mutations and listed primers, a PCR product was created with the HA or PS Ϫ substitution, kanamycin followed by an ISCE-I restriction site (KanI), and homologous arms. Either the KanI-HA-or KanI-PS Ϫ -containing product was transformed into competent GS1783 cells harboring the rJHMV.IA pBAC. Chloramphenicol-positive (CML ϩ ) Kan ϩ colonies were screened for intermolecular recombination by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. Colonies with the correct intermediates were then used for intramolecular recombination of the homologous arms. Correct colonies were amplified, and the ISCE-I enzyme was induced with 1% arabinose for 2 h. The Lambda Red recombination enzymes were induced by heat shock at 42°C for 30 min, and cells were then incubated at room temperature for 4 h. CML ϩ Kan Ϫ colonies were screened for correct final products by PCR, restriction enzyme digestion, and sequencing. pBAC.IA PSϪ or pBAC.IA Nsp15-HA was cotransfected with plasmid expressing N protein into BHK-MHVR cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected BHK cells were collected at the time of maximal cytopathic effect and lysed by freeze-thawing. rJHMV PSϪ and rJHMV Nsp15-HA were then passaged 3 times to obtain working stocks. Two independent clones of the PS Ϫ virus (Fig. 1C) , rJHMV PSϪ , were isolated, and the sequence of each clone was confirmed. No coding mutations were present in either clone; however, rJHMV PSϪ3.2 did contain a synonymous mutation in nsp15 3= of the PS. It is unlikely that this mutation significantly alters the secondary structure in this region, and this isolate behaved identically to rJHMV PSϪ4 . 2 . rJHMV Nsp15-HA was sequenced after passaging with no mutations found. To introduce the previously published PS Ϫ mutation (8) into rA59, the published mutations were introduced into the F plasmid of the rA59 system (21) . The F plasmid was linearized, and homologous arms, with the PS Ϫ mutations, were added by PCR using the primers listed in Table S1 . The linearized plasmid was recombined using the homologous arms and the In-Fusion cloning kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PS Ϫ mutations were screened for by PCR and sequencing. The F plasmid and other fragments were digested with BsmBI and ligated together using T4 DNA ligase. Ligated DNAs and N protein transcript were transcribed in vitro using the mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit (Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. BHK-MHVR cells were then transfected by electroporation with transcribed RNAs. Transfected BHK-MHVR cells were plated in D10 and monitored for cytopathic effects. Rescued recombinant viruses were collected, their titers were determined as described above, and they were termed rA59 PSϪ P0. rA59 PSϪ P0 stocks were used to generate rA59 PSϪ P1 stocks by infecting 17Cl-1 cells with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 PFU/cell and collecting cells at times of maximal cytopathic effects. Titers of P1 stocks of rA59 WT and rA59 PSϪ were determined, and the stocks were utilized for all experiments with rA59. Tissue culture cell infection. Unless otherwise noted, all infections were completed as follows. Semiconfluent monolayers of cells were infected on either 12-well or 24-well plates. Virus was adsorbed in DMEM at 37°C for 30 min at the indicated MOI. After adsorption, remaining virus was removed, and the cells were returned to growth medium for the indicated times. Mouse infection. For rJHMV infections, 5-to 8-week-old male mice were sedated using isoflurane and infected by the intranasal route with 3 ϫ 10 4 PFU, unless otherwise stated, in 12 l. In IFNARblocking experiments, 1.5 g of InVivoMAb (Bio X Cell; MAR1-5A3) IFNAR-blocking antibody or rat IgG (MP Biomedical) was administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection 6 h prior to infection and 0.5 g was administered 3 days postinfection. For rA59 infections, 5-to 8-week-old male mice were sedated and infected intracranially with 700 PFU. All infected mice were weighed and monitored for 2 weeks and euthanized if the mouse dropped below 70% of initial body weight or became dehydrated, in accordance with University of Iowa IACUC-approved animal protocols. RT-qPCR. For cellular RNA experiments, RNA was isolated from cultured cells using Trizol (Fisher Scientific). cDNAs for all RNAs except sgRNAs (see below) were prepared using Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase with random hexamers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed using Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 3 and PowerUp Sybr green master mix (Applied Biosystems). All primers used for qPCR are listed in Table S2 . Target gene levels were normalized to hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) by the threshold cycle (C T ) equation: ΔC T ϭ C T of the gene of interest Ϫ C T of HPRT. All results are shown as a ratio to HPRT calculated as 2 ϪΔCT . Selective viral RNA packaging. Infected 17Cl-1 supernatants were collected at 20 hpi, when maximal cytopathic effects were observed but before cell lysis. Supernatants were clarified by centrifugation at 1,000 ϫ g and filtered through a 0.45-m filter. Clarified supernatants were overlaid on 30% sucrose in Na-Tris buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) and centrifuged at 27,000 rpm for 4 h at 4°C. Pelleted virions were resuspended in DMEM. Viral RNA and cellular RNA from infected monolayers were isolated using Trizol (Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA for viral RNAs was generated using Superscript IV (Fisher Scientific) and strand-specific primers (Table S2) according to the manufacturer's protocol, while cDNA for HPRT was generated using random hexamers as described above. Quantification for viral RNAs was performed utilizing a standard curve, which was generated from reverse-transcribed PCR-derived gRNA and sgRNA products. Relative quantification was performed using ΔC T with normalization to gRNA. Data are presented as a ratio of ϩ/ϪsgRNA7 RNA to gRNA, gRNA units per milliliter, or HPRT RNA to gRNA. Viral titers. Viral titers were determined by infecting HeLa-MHVR cells as described above. Following rA59 infection, a 1:1 ratio of 1.2% agarose and D2 was applied to cells and the cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Following incubation, cell monolayers were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 2% methanol. Following rJHMV infection, cells were returned to D2 medium for 16 h at 37°C. After incubation, a 1:1 mixture of 1.2% agarose and D2 with 1% neutral red was applied for 4 h at 37°C before counting plaques. BMM cultures. Male and female B6 mice were euthanized, and bone marrow was isolated from each femur and tibia. The bone marrow was treated with ammonium-chloride-potassium lysing buffer for 30 s and then washed three times with RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum. Bone marrow cells were then strained through 70-m strainers and counted. Bone marrow cells (5 ϫ 10 5 ) were plated in BMM medium (RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum, 10% L929 cell supernatant, 1% Pen-Strep, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% L-glutamine) and cultured for 4 days. Following the 4th day, medium was changed daily until the day of experiment (day 7). BMMs were infected as described above at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. Statistics. Student's unpaired t test or the Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze differences in mean values between groups. All results are expressed as mean Ϯ range or Ϯstandard error of the mean where indicated. P values of Յ0.05 were considered statistically significant. Survival data were analyzed using Mantel-Cox tests (*, P Ͻ 0.05).
