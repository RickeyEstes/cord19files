Many methods have been employed for the initial detection and identification of novel emerging pathogens including microscopy, bacterial culture, cell culture, animal inoculation, electron microscopy, archaic serologic tests, cross-reactive serologic tests, serendipitous serologic testing, and immunohistochemistry. However, currently molecular methods including probe hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that amplifies the target or the signal, and nucleic acid sequencing are the most prominent methods for detection and characterization of newly emerging pathogens, both for discovering the agent and for determining that it is truly novel [1À11] . An example of the application of molecular methods to the identification of previously unidentified  agents of human infection is that of hepatitis C virus (HCV). After the discoveries of hepatitis A and B viruses, it was clear that the majority of cases of posttransfusion hepatitis were due to a condition designated non-A non-B hepatitis. The disease was transmissible to chimpanzees. In 1989, plasma from an infected chimpanzee was pelleted by ultracentrifugation and nucleic acids extracted from the pellet. cDNA was synthesized from both RNA and DNA with random primers and reverse transcriptase. Screening identified an RNA-encoded clone that expressed an antigen that reacted with antibodies of infected subjects. Eventually the complete genomes of all of the genotypes of HCV were determined, and a novel species most closely related to flaviviruses was established [12, 13] . Another dramatic emergence of a viral disease occurred in 1993 in the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. A mysterious highly lethal respiratory illness was investigated by a team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Extensive serologic screening of numerous antigens revealed unexpected reactivity with antigen of hantaviruses from other parts of the world that caused renal disease and hemorrhagic fever, and immunohistochemistry detected hantaviral antigen in pulmonary endothelium. Regions within the M segment of the RNA hantaviral genomes encoding G2 protein that are highly conserved were targeted by primers for nested PCR after reverse transcriptase generation of cDNA. Tissues from infected patients were analyzed, and the PCR products sequenced revealing a novel hantavirus subsequently named Sin Nombre virus. Viral sequences were identified in other patients and in Peromyscus maniculatus rodents, the reservoir. The story of hantaviral pulmonary syndrome unfolded to reveal related agents in many locations in North, Central, and South America [14, 15] . A novel coronavirus in association with cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) emerged in southern China in late 2002 and spread to 37 countries in five continents with 8273 confirmed cases and 775 deaths. No further cases have been reported since July 2003 [16] . RT-PCR, cloning, and sequencing contributed to identification of the SARS-CoV within weeks of the first cases reported in 2003 [17À20] and enabled rapid development of effective molecular diagnostic assays for routine clinical use [21, 22] . SARS-CoV is associated with high mortality. Thus, timely and accurate diagnosis is needed to prevent the spread of this contagious disease. SARS-CoV spreads by respiratory secretions and airborne transmission. Early in the illness, SARS cannot be distinguished from common respiratory infections based on clinical symptoms [16] . During the SARS epidemic, PCR-based molecular testing was helpful because of its ability to rapidly screen for many viruses. After the identification of SARS-CoV, specific RT-PCR and serological assays were developed, and RT-PCR detected infection before the appearance of antibodies when the risk of transmission is greatest [16À22] . The bacterial rrs gene encoding 16S rRNA was recognized as a valuable phylogenetic tool for discrimination and identification of bacterial species. David Relman crafted this tool into an approach to identify an unknown etiologic agent by PCR of the rrs gene with primers that corresponded to genomic regions that were conserved among eubacteria. Using this approach, he amplified and determined bacterial DNA sequences from bacillary angiomatosis lesions of patients with AIDS. Comparison with a bacterial gene database revealed that the DNA sequences matched bacteria that are currently named Bartonella henselae and B. quintana. Serendipitous testing of a patient who also had been diagnosed with cat scratch disease led to the recognition that B. henselae was also the long sought-after etiology of this well-characterized disease [23, 24] . The same approach to discovery using rrs gene amplification and DNA sequencing led to the identification of what is currently classified as Anaplasma phagocytophilum as the etiologic agent of tick-transmitted human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis [25, 26] . Subsequently Ehrlichia ewingii was recognized as another human tick-borne pathogen among patients evaluated in a molecular diagnostics laboratory who tested negative for E. chaffeensis infection [27À29]. More recently, Bobbi Pritt at Mayo Clinic noted that the melting curve of the DNA amplicons in a real-time PCR assay for Anaplasmataceae differed from the expected curves of known pathogens for a group of patients in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Sequence analysis identified another novel tick-borne pathogen tentatively designated Ehrlichia muris-like agent [8, 9] . The discovery of a novel bunyavirus that has caused thousands of human infections with a case fatality rate of 12% in 15 provinces in China relied upon a molecular approach to identify the viral agent. Xue-Jie Yu investigated an outbreak in China that was thought to be due to severe infection with A. phagocytophilum. He noted that some of the clinical manifestations differed from those of anaplasmosis. He observed cytopathic effect in DH-82 cells inoculated with clinical samples rather than the typical morulae formed by Anaplasma species in infected cells. Ultrastructural analysis suggested that the pathogen causing the outbreak was a virus that belongs to the family of bunyaviruses. Based on the known sequence of bunyaviruses, PCR primers were designed, which yielded no amplicons. Subsequently, he began sequencing the RNA of heavily infected cells and discarded the sequences of the culture host species, Canis familiaris. This approach enabled him to determine that he had recovered a novel Phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae. He accomplished this feat without the use of nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) [10] . The application of NGS now allows us to obtain an abundance of viral gene sequences from infected host cells and the discovery of further novel viral and bacterial agents.
