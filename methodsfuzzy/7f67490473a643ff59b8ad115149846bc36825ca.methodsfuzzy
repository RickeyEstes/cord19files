Ethics statement. All Table 1 ) [103] [104] [105] [106] . Mice in Group A were monitored for 3 months (87-94 days post-infection; dpi) to evaluate long-term phenotypic differences. Group B contained 37 mice, including 19 females and 18 males, from 4 of the 5 strains represented in Group A (CC013, CC019, CC041, and CC061). To identify phenotypic differences related to the acute phase of TMEV infection, roughly half of the Group B mice (2 females and 2 males per strain, including 1 infected of each sex) were evaluated for 7 dpi and the remaining mice (2-3 mice of each sex per strain, including 1-2 infected per sex) for 28 dpi. Infection. At Genotyping and haplotype reconstruction. Genotyping of CC strains has been described previously 108 . Genotype data is publicly available at the CC Status website (http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index. py?run=AvailableLines).
