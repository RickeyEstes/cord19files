Cell culture. 17Cl-1 cells, HeLa cells expressing MHV receptor carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) (43) , (HeLa-MVR), and baby hamster kidney cells expressing CEACAM1 (BHK-R) (44) were grown as previously described (39, 45) . Generation of recombinant strain rA59 Nsp15-HA . An epitope derived from the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA), YPYDVPDYA, was introduced into the F plasmid of the A59 in vitro ligation system (39) . The F plasmid was linearized, and homologous arms, with the HA substitution, were added by PCR using the following primers: 5= GAGCCCACAAGGTAATCCGGGTGGTTGCGTAATCAGGAACGTCGTAAGGGT AGAAGCTCTAGCGCGTGGCAC 3= and 5= GATTACCTTGTGGGCTCCGGTAATGTGCGTAATCAGGAACGTCGTA nsp15 Interacts with CoV RTC-Associated Proteins ® AGGGTAGAAGATAACATCGTCACCGT 3=. The plasmid was recombined using In-Fusion (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol and screened for the HA substitution. MHV-A59 fragments were digested and ligated as previously reported (46) . Transcripts were generated using mMessage Machine T7. RNAs were then electroporated (Bio-Rad GenePulser Xcell) into 6 ϫ 10 7 BHK-R cells seeded into a T75 flask. Flasks were monitored for cytopathic effect (CPE [24 to 48 h]), and viruses were collected by freeze-thawing at peak CPE. After thawing, cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 1,500 ϫ g, and supernatants were then aliquoted and termed passage 0 (P0). To create working stocks, rA59 Nsp15-HA and rA59 WT P0 viruses were passaged on 17Cl-1 cells and collected at maximum CPE. Virus infection. Recombinant versions of the A59 strain of MHV (termed rA59 herein) were used in all experiments. The cDNA clone used to develop recombinant rA59 Nsp15-HA and rA59 WT has been described previously (GenBank accession no. AY910861) (39) . Unless otherwise stated, 17Cl-1 cells were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 0.1 for 30 min at 37°C. Viruses from supernatants and cells were combined prior to determination of viral titers. Viral titers. Virus titers were determined on HeLa-MVR cells as previously described with some modifications (47) . HeLa-MVR cells under agarose overlays were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde at 16 to 24 hpi and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Passaging and competition assay. The rA59 Nsp15-HA P1 viruses were passaged on 17Cl-1 cells at an initial MOI of 0.1. Each passage was collected at maximum CPE. For each subsequent passage, an estimated MOI of 0.1 was used by infecting 17Cl-1 cells with 5 l of infected supernatants. Following the fifth passage, stocks of each virus were used to infect 17Cl-1 cells and collected for immunoblotting as described below. RNA analysis. Subconfluent monolayers of 17Cl-1 cells were infected at an MOI of 5 and collected by Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at the indicated times. RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions and transcribed into cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV RT) (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Viral gRNA, sgRNA, and cellular hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) RNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) with the indicated primers (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) using an Applied Biosystems 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The levels of gRNA and sgRNA were normalized to HPRT by the following threshold cycle (C T ) equation: ΔC T ϭ C T of gene of interest Ϫ C T of HPRT. All results are shown as a ratio to HPRT calculated as 2 ϪΔCT . Selective viral RNA packaging. Cell supernatants were collected at 16 hpi from 1.5 ϫ 10 7 17Cl-1 cells infected with rA59 WT or rA59 Nsp15-HA at an MOI of 0.1. Supernatants were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm to remove cellular debris and then passed through a 45-m-pore filter. Viruses were pelleted through a 30% sucrose cushion for 4 h at 27,000 rpm using a Beckman ultracentrifuge and an SW32 Ti rotor (Beckman, Indianapolis, IN). Viral pellets were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and viral RNA was isolated using Trizol. The ratio of sgRNA to gRNA was measured using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Confocal microscopy. Subconfluent monolayers of 17Cl-1 cells on glass coverslips were infected at an MOI of 1 with either rA59 WT or rA59 Nsp15-HA virus. At the indicated times, monolayers were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before blocking with 1% goat serum. Following blocking, cells were stained with indicated primary antibodies for 3 h at room temperature using the following concentrations: anti-HA, 1:500 (clone 16B12 [BioLegend]); anti-nsp8, 1:1,000 (8); anti-nsp12, 1:500 (9); anti-M (5B11.5), 1:10,000 (48) ; and anti-nsp15 (D23 [a generous gift from Susan Baker, Loyola University, Chicago, IL]), 1:500 (10, 49) . Following washing with blocking buffer, fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody was applied. Goat anti-rabbit 488 and goat anti-mouse 568 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used 1:500 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed before mounting with Vectashield antifade reagent (Vector Laboratories). In most cases, 4 to 5 images, with an average of~10 cells per image for each condition and for each experiment, were taken using a Leica STED Sp8 scanning confocal microscope. Images were analyzed using LAS X software. Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCCs) were obtained by analyzing individual cells from at least four images from two independent experiments using the CoLoc2 plugin for FIJI (50) . Background was subtracted for data analysis as required. Immunoblotting. Infected or uninfected subconfluent monolayers of 17Cl-1 cells were lysed with 2ϫ sample buffer containing SDS, protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Basal, Switzerland), ␤-mercaptoethanol, and Pierce Universal Nuclease (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Boiled cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE on polyacrylamide gels. Gels were transferred overnight at 30 V to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore), and the membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS or Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-Cor). Blots were incubated with listed primary antibodies, for 3 h at room temperature: anti-nsp8, 1:1,000; anti-nsp12, 1:500; anti-HA, 1:500; anti-N protein (5B188.2), 1:10,000 (a generous gift from Michael Buchmeier, University of California Irvine); anti-JHM, 1:10,000 (51); and anti-actin, 1:10,000 (clone AC-15 [Abcam, Inc.]). Immunoblots were washed with 0.1% Tween in PBS. Blots were incubated with infrared-conjugated secondary antibodies (Li-Cor) for 1 h and then washed with PBS before imaging. Immunoblots were imaged using a Li-Cor Odyssey Imager and analyzed using Image Studio software (Li-Cor). Immunoprecipitation. 17Cl-1 cells were plated on 10-cm dishes 2 days prior to infection. For each condition, 4.5 ϫ 10 7 17Cl-1 cells were infected with either rA59 WT or rA59 Nsp15-HA at an MOI of 0.1. When plates reached maximum CPE (16 to 20 hpi), cells were collected and pelleted by low-speed centrifugation prior to lysis. Cell pellets were lysed with IP buffer (0.5% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], with or without Pierce Universal Nuclease [Thermo Fischer Scientific]), as indicated for 1 h at 4°C. Next, nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (16,000 ϫ g for 15 min at 4°C) and applied to protein G Dynabeads (Thermo Fischer Scientific) conjugated to the indicated antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell lysate and antibody-bound beads were mixed overnight at 4°C. Beads were washed with PBS-Tween before elution with 2ϫ SDS sample buffer at 95°C for 5 min. Eluates and lysates were then subjected to immunoblotting as described above. Statistics. Student's unpaired t test or Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze differences in mean values between groups. All results are expressed as means Ϯ range or standard error of the mean. P values of Յ0.05 were considered statistically significant.
