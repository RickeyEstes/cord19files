Initial chiral screening was automated on SFC using 5 different polysaccharide CSPs (Chiralpak ADH, Chiralpak ASH, Chiralcel ODH, Chiralpak IA, and Chiralpak IC) cross-matched with 5 different organic modifiers (MeOH, EtOH, ACN, IPA, and 50 : 50 MeOH/EtOH solvent). For each combination, the percentages of the modifier were set at 5%, 10%, and 20%. Though clear separation of R-goitrin and S-goitrin could be observed either on Chiralcel ODH coupled with MeOH or on Chiralpak IC coupled with ACN, the greatest potential for preparative purification was demonstrated on the latter combination. Therefore, further SFC conditions were optimized on Chiralpak IC column using acetonitrile as cosolvent. Four parameters, namely, modifier concentration, column temperature, flow rate, and back pressure, were chosen as optimization factors. Retention time (Rt) and resolution (Rs) were used as criteria to evaluate the separation quality. As can be found in Tables 1-4, composition of the mobile phase shows dominant influence on Rt and Rs, while the other 3 factors have relatively weaker impact on separation. It is obvious that when less acetonitrile is used, larger resolution will be obtained. But the analysis time will be extended at the same time. Finally, the condition that gave sufficient resolution and relatively shorter analysis time was chosen. At 35 âˆ˜ C, 15% ACN (3.5 mL/min), and 100 bar, satisfactory resolution (Rs = 3.75) and quick separation (within 5 min) were achieved. Following optimization, a new chiral analytical method was obtained. The total analysis time represented a tenfold increase in speed, compared to the authors' previous established NPLC method (see Figures 2 and 3) . The peaks were identified by running the (R)-goitrin and (S)-goitrin standard. Interestingly, the elution order of (R)-goitrin and (S)-goitrin was reversed on the same column in SFC and HPLC (Figures 2 and 3 ).
