Pharyngeal swabs or broncho-alveolar lavage fluids were collected from patients and processed immediately. Total nucleic acid was extracted from samples using the QIAmp MinElute Virus kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) on an automated QIAcube (Qiagen) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Detection of respiratory pathogens was done using the FTD respiratory pathogens 21 kit (Fast track diagnostics, Junglingster, Luxemburg). The assay is able to detect influenza A and B viruses, and also enables detection on a subtype level for A(H1N1) pdm09. In addition, the assay is capable to detect coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, enterovirus/parechovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, human metapneumovirus A/B, human bocavirus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus A/B, and adenovirus. Of note, all samples positive in the general influenza A assay were classified as A(H3N2) without further typing. This was based on the finding that only influenza virus A(H1N1) pdm09 and A(H3N2) had circulated in Germany from 2010 on according to national surveillance data [3] . Thermal cycling was done using an ABI 7500 machine (Applied Biosystems, Wiesbaden, Germany) as recommended. The FTD respiratory pathogens 21 kit was supplemented with three in-house real-time PCR assays for the detection of Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila, and Chlamydia pneumonia as described elsewhere [4] .
