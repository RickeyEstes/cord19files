This section on GIS methods and the following one discussing GIS applications are complementary to our review of the subject published in 2001 [10] . Freier also provides one of the best thorough, but concise and easy-to-follow descriptions of the main GIS methods available today for emergency management. These methods, which also apply to other types of health-related analyses using GIS, include overlay analysis of thematic data and spatial intersection, buffer generation, neighbourhood analysis, vector-based grid generation, network analysis, and (raster) surface modelling. These GIS methods should be coupled with proper spatio-temporal statistical methods to ensure valid analyses and robust conclusions [11, 12] . GIS offer powerful features not available to users of either paper-drawn or electronic map images. In GIS, geographic boundaries of study areas can be accessed and modified, data class intervals and symbologies restructured, map layers (variables) vertically overlayed and integrated, new independent map variables added for multivariate spatial statistical analysis, spatial weights computed, spatial autocorrelation on predictor variables assessed, and probability scenarios of mapped variables explored based on modelled changes in regression coefficients over time, with unparalleled computational speed and ease. GIS also enable multi-dimensional surface images to be drawn to scale, a feature important in studies involving elevation or subsurface shape. The mathematical treatment of topographic or surface statistical values can be used as a filter against other variables or other surfaces. A range of statistical techniques have evolved that are well suited to GIS analysis, including density kernel estimation, grid and probability estimation, and kriging (see "Smoothed maps" below) [13] . Rushton suggests that GIS provide the capability to perform two types of spatial analysis that could not be performed without GIS: finding areas of high disease incidence that can be labelled as statistically significant and worthy of further investigation, and examining the spatial relationship between disease incidence and information that is geo-referenced differently from the disease data [14] . Rushton also argues that GIS are useful for exploratory spatial analysis but are less useful for confirmatory analysis [14] , although it is clearly possible to integrate confirmatory statistical methods with GIS.
