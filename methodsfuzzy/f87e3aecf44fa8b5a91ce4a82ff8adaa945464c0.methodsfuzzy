TCV strains examined in the present study included Minnesota strain (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC VR-911), Indiana strain (Tom Hooper, Purdue University), and NC95 strain (Guy et al., 1997) . These viruses were isolated from turkeys in Minnesota in 1974 , Indiana in 1994 and North Carolina in 1995 . TCV strains were propagated by amniotic inoculation of embryonated turkey eggs (Guy et al., Fig. 1 . Comparison of amino acid sequences of the nucleocapsid protein of TCV (Minnesota, Indiana and NC95 strains) and published sequences of IBV (Beaudette, KB8523 and M41 strains; Boursnell et al., 1985; Sutou et al., 1988) . The positions where amino acids are identical are indicated as (·).

The positions where nucleotides are missing are indicated as (-) and identical nucleotides are indicated as (·). 1997). Viral RNA was extracted from sucrose gradient-purified virus, and cDNA synthesis was accomplished by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as described (Breslin et al., 1999) . The RT reaction was primed with an oligo (dT) primer 15 bases in length; this primer along with a specific oligonucleotide primer designed from the 5% end of the N gene (TGAATTCTAAATTCACCTCAACCTAAGT) (Breslin et al., 1999) was used in the PCR procedure. Primers possessed EcoRI restriction sites that facilitated cloning of cDNA into pUC19; clones were used to transform competent Escherichia coli strain DH5a (Gibco BRL) as described (Sambrook et al., 1989) . DNA was sequenced at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill) Automated DNA Sequencing Facility on a Model 373A DNA Sequencer using the Taq Dye Deoxy™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). All sequences were confirmed by sequencing of both strands. Preliminary nucleotide sequence data allowed the design of primers to amplify internal N gene and 3% UTR regions to confirm the nucleotide sequence. Primers again were designed with EcoRI restriction sites, used in a RT-PCR procedure and cDNA fragments were cloned and sequenced as described above. The complete nucleotide sequence of the N gene and the 3'UTR of each TCV have been deposited in GenBank; accession numbers are TCV (Indiana) AF111995, TCV (Minnesota) AF111996, TCV (NC95) AF111997.
