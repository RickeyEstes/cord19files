The two air sampling pumps used were model SKC AirChek XR5000. These were located in a seat at the back of the economy class cabin. Both pumps sampled at 3.5 liters per second, the NIOSH protocol for stationary sampling and approximately the normal breathing rate of adults. Just prior to each sampling, each pump was calibrated using a MesaLab Defender Calibrator. Air samples of 30min duration were collected onboard the aircraft during five distinct sampling intervals. Once the pilot announced the flight time, we calculated the quarter-way point, halfway point, and three quart-way point. Thus, the five sampling periods were pre-boarding and boarding, Q1 ± 15 min, Q2 ± 15 min, Q3 ± 15 min, and touchdown to end of deplaning. In addition, one sample was collected throughout the whole flight from 10,000 ft on ascent to 10,000 ft on descent. Flight 2 only has data for four time points. Following each sampling period, the sampling cartridges were wrapped with Teflon tape, labeled, logged, and placed in a cooler with chemical ice packs. Prior to each flight, we prepared an ordered list of seven randomly selected seats, of which the first two occupied seats, as confirmed by the gate agent prior to boarding, were sampled. We also randomly chose a rear lavatory door (port or starboard) for sampling. We swabbed the laboratory door handles using Bode SecurSwab DNA Collector dual swabs, placing three drops of DNA-and RNA-free water on one of the two swabs, then, swabbing in one direction within a 9 cm × 9 cm template, and finally swabbing in the perpendicular direction within the same template. Afterwards, we placed each swab into its secure tube, labeled it, logged it, and placed it into a cooler on a chemical ice pack. We sampled three touch surfaces at each passenger seatthe inside tray table, the outside tray table, and the seat belt buckle. Using the templates and the dual swabs, we sampled the bottom corners of each side of the tray table as described above. We did not use the template to swab the seat belt buckle; rather, we swabbed the entire upper surface in one direction and then in the perpendicular direction. We placed each swab into its secure tube, labeled it, logged it, and placed it into a cooler on a chemical ice pack. Material from the two swabs was combined in Tris Buffer and homogenized per kit instructions. The air filters were similarly prepared. DNA isolations were performed using the Power Soil kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions with an elution volume of 50 μl. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified for sequencing using the 515F primer (5′ GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA 3′) and 806R primer (5′ GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT 3′) [47] . The 16S rRNA gene-specific primers were tailed with Illumina adaptor sequences to allow a secondary PCR to add indexing barcodes and full Illumina adaptor sequences to support paired-end sequencing. Libraries were pooled for sequencing in batch sizes of 48 samples per batch and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq at HudsonAlpha Biosciences. Paired-end sequencing with a read length of 150 bases per read was used, providing a small overlap at the end of each read to facilitate assembly of the paired-end sequencing reads to a single fragment of~290 bp representing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. In reality, the reverse read was of very low quality preventing assembly for forward and reverse reads. Therefore, only quality trimmed forward reads were used for all downstream analyses. The 16S sequence data have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database on BioProject accession number: PRJNA420089 and at the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under Accession IDs SRR6330835-SRR6330871. Reads were de-multiplexed according to the barcodes and trimmed of barcodes and adapters. Following the initial processing of the sequence data, sequences were combined, dereplicated, and aligned in mothur (version 1.36.1) [48] using the SILVA template (SSURef_NR99_123) [49] ; subsequently, sequences were organized into clusters of representative sequences based on taxonomy called operational taxonomic units (OTU) using the UPARSE pipeline [50] . Initial filtering of the samples ensured discarding OTUs containing less than five sequences. Libraries were normalized using metagenomeSeq's cumulative sum scaling method [51] to account for library size acting as a confounding factor for the beta diversity analysis. Moreover, in addition to discarding singletons, OTUs that were observed fewer than seven times in the count data were also filtered out to avoid the inflation of any contaminants that might skew the diversity estimates.
