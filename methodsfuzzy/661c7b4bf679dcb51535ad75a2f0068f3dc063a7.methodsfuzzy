We conducted a comprehensive search for Cochrane reviews of TCM for ARTIs. We screened the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in the Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2007. The search string contained (traditional AND Chinese AND medicine) OR herb*. We found 70 Cochrane reviews and protocols. After scrutiny, six reviews were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The six reviews related to the use of TCM in the treatment of acute bronchitis, influenza, measles, sore throat, common cold and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), respectively.
