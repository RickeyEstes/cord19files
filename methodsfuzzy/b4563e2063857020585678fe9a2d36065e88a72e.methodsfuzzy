Forty milliliters of sterile distilled water were continuously mixed while heated to one of seven treatment temperatures: 4.4, 65.6, 71.1, 76.7, 82.2, 87.8, and 98.9°C (with 4.4°C serving as a positive control). Water at each temperature was inoculated with 1.5 ml (10 6 TCID 50 /ml) of cell-culture adapted PEDV (strain PC22A, (Oka et al., 2014) ) and following inoculation, 1 ml aliquots of inoculated water removed at specified time points: 5, 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 300, and 600 s. Immediately after collection, aliquots were mixed 1:1 with maintenance medium (MM) being held at 4°C in an ice block (Bowman et al., 2015b) . In the same manner, each vial of heated water was sampled immediately prior to inoculation with PEDV to serve as a negative control. All above mentioned procedures were completed in triplicate. All samples were inoculated in quadruplicate with 24 well cell culture plates containing monolayers of Vero cells (CCL-81; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) with 600 µl of the sample. The remainder of each sample was frozen at −80°C for additional testing. Inoculated wells were observed daily and all samples demonstrating cytopathic effects (CPE) three days post-inoculation in any of the wells were classified as positive. Previously described methods were used to measure tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) for all positive samples (Bowman et al., 2015b) . Mean TCID 50 values were calculated for each triplicate, which were subsequently log-transformed, normality visually assessed, and compared using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. In addition, each sample was tested with rRT-PCR targeting the N gene using previously described methods (Jung et al., 2014 , Bowman et al., 2015b in order to determine if the hot water degraded viral nucleic acid.
