Dataset Nucleotide sequences of 103 SARS-CoV complete genomes were taken from the PubMed NCBI Entrez database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez) in GenBank and FASTA formats. Since there were 7 pairs of nucleotide-identical isolates, we considered the dataset to consist of 96 isolates (Tables 1 and  S1 ). All the sequences are between 29,013 (Shang-haiQXC2) and 29
