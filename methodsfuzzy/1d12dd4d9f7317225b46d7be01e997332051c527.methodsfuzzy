The virus. The La Crosse strain of CE virus was kindly provided by Dr. N. Karabatsos of the Yale Arbovirus Research Unit. This had been passaged 5 times intracerebrally in suckling mice, and for experiments covered in the present report, seed virus derived from 3 additional passages was used. This was in the form of 10% clarified mouse brain suspensions in Hanks' salts plus 1% bovine serum alumen. Titers ranged from 4.5 to 7.5 X 10' PFU/ml. Experimental animals. One-to 2-day-old litters of Swiss albino mice were infected by the intracerebral inoculation of 0.02 ml of a lo-fold dilution of stock virus. Mice were sacrificed and samples of brain tissue taken for electron microscopy at stages from the first appearance of paralysis through to the moribund state, events which occurred on average from 38 to 46 hr post infection. Cell cultures. Cells of the stable African green monkey kidney cell line (Vero) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL-81). Growth medium consisted of Eagle's MEM (Hanks' salts) plus 7.5 % newborn calf serum. MEM (Earle's salts) plus 2% serum was employed as maintenance medium. Cells of the continuous mosquito cell line of A. albopictus (Singh, 1967) derived from insect larvae, were kindly provided by Dr. Arthur Greene, Institute of Medical Rcsearch, Camden, New Jersey. They were cultured in glass prescription bottles using a growth medium formulated by Dr. W. F. Scherer (personal communication) and consisting of 0.65 % lactalbumen hydrolyzate, 0.5% yeast extract, d-glucose 0.4%, heatinactivated newborn calf serum 5%, 1% of a 1.4% sodium bicarbonate solution, all in Hanks' BSS. Cells were cultivated at 30°C. For maint.enance, the serum content was reduced to 2 %. Assay of infectious virus. A plaque assay based on the procedure of Stim and Henderson (1969) using Vero cell monolayer cultures was employed. Confluent cultures in 2-02 prescription bottles were washed with PBS and inoculated with virus diluted with 1 YO bovine serum albumen in Hanks' salts at pH 7.8. After absorption of 1.5 hr the virus inoculum was removed and an agar overlay medium was added. The overlay medium of Stim and Henderson (1969) was supplemented with lactalbumen hydrolyzate and yeast extract to concentrations of 0.18% and 0.05%. In addition, pancreatin (Came et al., 1969) was added to a concentration of 0.33%. The agar concentration in the overlay was 0.9%. A second agar overlay containing Neutral Red indicator was added following an interval of 2 days. Plaques were read from 3 to 5 days after infection. (;~~th cu)'ves. Cells were infoctcd at, a multiplicit'y of 10 PE'U/coll. I:ollowing a 1.5hr absorption period, the virus inoculum n-as removed, the cells were washed three times with PBS, and maintenance medium \vas added. The mosquito cells wcrc maintaincd at 30", t'he Vero cells at 37". Samples wor(l withdrawn at intervals following infection and &orcd at -70" for subsequent assay. For estimation of cell-associated virus, ~11 sheet,s were washed wit11 PBS, resus-per&d in Hanks BA medium, sonicsted, and clarified by low speed cckntrifugntion. Such cell-derived supcrnatants went stored and assayed as indicated above. IttJectious center assay. Infcctc>d mosquito ~11s were trypsinizcd, dispcrsrd and washed in growt'h medium, and incubated for 15 n-tin at room temperature in a hcnt-inactivnted hyperimmunc serum prc>pared in guinc>a pigs, diluted 1: 10. After two further II-ashes in growth medium, counting in a hc~macytomctrr, and appropriate dilution in medium, one ccl1 in 0.1 ml \vas socded int,o each of 96 ~11s (0.4 ml capacity) of a plastic tray (Modrl 15-F'B-9G-TC, Limbro Chrmical Co., Inc.). Two trays were used per assay. Trays were s&cd and returned to the> 30" incubat'or. Afttv overnight incubation each ~011 was srcdcd with 25,000 Vcro cc& in 0.2 ml of Vcro muint,enancc lnedium, and trays were rcscaled and re-turnc>d t'o the 37" incubator. Vcro ccl1 mono-layc>rs were rapidly established and observed (WW several days for the development of cytopat,hic effects. The infectious center assay of Vero cells was similarly conducted. Electron microscop2/. Immediately after sacrifice, the brains of suckling mice were excised and randomly cut into 1 mm3 blocks in ice-cold 2.5 % phosphate-buffered glutaraldchyde at pH 7.2. After fixat,ion for 1 hr at. 4", and removal of excess glutaraldehydc by washing, specimens w(xre postfixed for 1 hr at 4" in 1% phosphate-buffered osmium tetroxide. After a sclries of dehydration steps in graded aqueous ethanol solutions, specimens w-ore cmbcdded in Epon. Sections were cut. with a Porter-Blum MT-2 ultramicrotome equipprd with glass knives, then stained for 20 min with 4 % sq. uranyl acetate followed by 10 min in an 0.5 % alka-lint lc~ud caitratct stain.

F'igurca 1 drtpicts comparativf> growth curves of CE virus in Vcro and A. albopictus cells. After a11 eclipse phase lasting 4-6 hr, virus replicated cxponctntially, rcbaching maximal titers 20-24 hr post infrction. The yields of crll-associated virus cllosrl>r paralleled rrlcascd virus, indicating a rapid release of virus from infected cells. In tho mosquit,o ccl1 cultures, the ratio of rclr:w~d t.o cell-associated virus, 24 hours post infrction was 5.S:l, whcr(*:ls in Vfbro cultures this ratio npproximatckd unity. The rc>sults of a11 infectious center assay are presclntcd in Table 1 . The pcxrccntnge of infected mosquito ~11s (9.4) was significantly less than that of infected Vero cells (81.0%). It, \vas calculated that' the yield of virus per infected mosquito cc:lI was a~)proximately 40 PFU/cell, somewhat highcr than a corrrsponding figure 25 PFU per infected Vcro ~11. Thtl outcome of infechion in Vero cells was cell lysis. Cytopathic effects, involving increasing cytoplasmic granularity, eventual detachment from the surface of the culture bottles, first detectable in a small percentage of the cells 24 hr p.i., progressively involved the majority of cells by 48-72 hr p.i. This CE virus-Vero cell interaction contrasted sharply with observations in the infected mosquito cultures. Here, the infection was seemingly moderate, no gross cytopathic effects were apparent, and cultures could be maintained with replenishment of medium for at least 2 weeks without subcultivation. As indicated in Table 2 , such infected cultures could be serially subcultivated yielding cultures which remained persistently infected. The replication of virus in suckling mouse brain cells was similar to that recorded by Murphy et al. (1968a) , maximal titers being reached 34-40 hr after infection.
