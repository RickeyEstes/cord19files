Expression and purification of the His-tagged SCV NTPase/Helicase. The protein expression plasmid harboring the SCV NTPase/Helicase domain (pHelA12, kindly provided by Dr. Huang, J.-D. University of Hong Kong, China), which was constructed in the previous study [9] , was transformed into E. coli Rosetta TM competent cells (Novagen). The recombinant His-tagged SCV NTPase/Helicase was purified as described previously [9] with a following modification; after purification with a nickel-charged HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare) chromatography, fractions containing the protein, which was determined by 10% SDS-PAGE, were ultrafiltrated with Amicon stirred cell (YM-30). During the ultrafiltration, desalting and buffer exchange was accompanied for the next column containing 180 ml of Sephadex G-100 resin (Sigma), which was washed with Buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl; pH 7.5, and 0.3 mM NaCl). After the protein sample (2 ml) was applied to column, it was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate 0.3 ml/min. Pure fractions determined by SDS-PAGE were combined, and the pooled fractions were ultrafiltrated with Amicon stirred cell (YM-30) for volume down. The purified protein in 30% (v/v) glycerol was frozen at À80 o C for long term storage. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay system (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Typical yields were $5 mg of purified protein/6 liter of bacterial culture. Preparation of random RNA library. The RNA library used for in vitro selection was generated by in vitro transcription, using T7 RNA polymerase and 109 bp DNA template containing 40 random nucleotides (Fig. 1A) . The DNA template for in vitro transcription was generated by 15 cycles of amplification of single stranded DNA with forward primer containing T7 promotor (underlined sequence) (5 0 -GATAATACGACTC ACTATAGGGTTCACTGCAGACTTGACGAA-3 0 ) and reverse primer (5 0 -GAATTCGTAGATGTGGATCCATT-3 0 ). In PCR-amplified DNA template the random regions were flanked by defined sequences comprising the T7 promotor and restriction sites for in vitro transcription and cloning purposes (Fig. 1A) . The amplified DNA was purified by phenol and chloroform, and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. The produced RNA was gel-purified on a 12% Urea-denaturing gel. The sequence of the generated RNA is 5 0 -GGGUUCACUGCAGACUUGACGAAGCU U-N40-AAUGGAUCCACAUCUACGAAUUC-3 0 , where N40 represents 40 nt with equimolar incorporation of A, G, C, and U at each position. In vitro selection of RNA aptamers. In vitro selection was carried out with the purified His-tagged SCV NTPase/Helicase and the generated RNA library. First, 5 lg of the RNA library was preincubated with 100 ll of Ni-NTA sepharose beads in 100 ll of binding buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl; pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1% (w/v) BSA) for 20 min at room temperature with occasional shaking. The RNA-bead complexes were precipitated and discarded for removing RNAs with nonspecific binding activity to sepharose bead. In each cycle, precleared supernatant was incubated with 2 lg of His-tagged SCV protein in 100 ll binding buffer for 30 min at room temperature. One-hundred microliters of Ni-NTA sepharose was added and incubation was continued for another 20 min. The reaction mixture was centrifuged to remove These RNAs of three groups were identified to contain a AG-rich conserved sequence of 10-11 nucleotides (in white boxes) in the middle of core region. Group II and III are observed to include an additional conserved sequence (in gray boxes). RNA molecules that do not bind the protein, and pellets were washed five times with 500 ll of the binding buffer. The helicase complexed with RNA was dissociated from the Ni-NTA beads by eluting with the elution buffer (binding buffer components plus 250 mM imidazole). RNAs bound to the protein were recovered from the supernatant by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Recovered RNAs were reverse transcribed with ImProm-IIä reverse transcriptase (Promega), amplified by PCR with Taq DNA polymerase, and used for next round of selection. Eight consecutive rounds of selection were performed in the same manner. However, starting from the round nine, a more stringent condition was employed by reducing the protein concentration at every one or second round: 1 lg (round 9), 0.5 lg (rounds 10-11), 0.25 lg (rounds 12-13), and 0.125 lg (rounds [14] [15] . After the 15th round, cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into a linearized pGEM T vector (Promega). After subcloning and transformation into E. coli, plasmid DNA was isolated from individual clones and the DNA sequences of clones were analyzed. The secondary structure of selected RNA aptamers was predicted by the MFold program based on the Zuker algorithm [22] . ATP hydrolysis by SCV NTPase/Helicase. ATPase activity of SCV NTPase/Helicase was investigated in the presence of either original RNA library or enriched RNA pool from the SELEX round #15 (ES15 RNA) for monitoring the inhibition of ATPase activity by RNA aptamers. ATPase activity of the SCV helicase was assayed by measuring the amount of phosphate released from adenosine triphosphate. Inorganic phosphate was quantified by using color-developing reagent that is specific for P i [23] . ATP hydrolysis reaction was carried out by mixing 0.1 lM SCV helicase with 0.5 mM ATP, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , and various concentrations of RNA aptamer pool (or random RNA library) with or without 100 nM Poly (rU) ($290 nts, purchased from GE healthcare) in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) in a final volume of 30 ll. The reactions were incubated for 3 min at 37 o C and were stopped by adding 70 ll of the colordeveloping reagent (1 part of 10% (w/v) ascorbic acid and 6 part of 0.42% (w/v) Ammonium molybdate in 1 N H 2 SO 4 ). The quenched reaction then was incubated for 1 h at 37 o C and developed cyan-blue color was read at 820 nm. ATPase activity was assayed by the amount of phosphate released and quantified by comparison with a standard phosphate calibration curve. FRET-based helicase activity assay. MALDI-TOF MS analysis of RNA aptamer pool. The mass analysis of the RNA aptamer pool was performed using Autoflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Brucker Daltonics Inc, Billerica, MA, USA). The spectrum was acquired in a linear mode with a Smartbeamä laser as a desorption/ionization source. Negative ions were subjected to 20 kV accelerating voltage with 0 V set to the sample plate. The spectrum was accumulated from 5 points with 200 per point. One microliter of a matrix solution, which was prepared by mixing equal volume of hydroxypicolinic acid (20 mg/ml in acetonitrile/water = 1:1) and ammonium citrate (50 mg/ml in water), was mixed with 0.1 lg of the RNA aptamer pool.
