Phylogenetic tree construction. We employed the following methodologies for genetic analyses. The genome sequences of 2019-nCoV were obtained on 29 January 2020 along with genetically related 10 SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-like virus genome sequences that we identified through the BLASTN search in NCBI database. We also included 10 sequences of MERS-CoV strains and one outgroup alphacoronavirus sequence. 2019-nCoV genome (30 Kb in size) codes for a large non-structural polyprotein ORF1ab that is proteolytically cleaved to generate 15/16 proteins, and four structural proteins -Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N), as well as five accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8 and ORF10). The genome sequences were aligned using the MAFFTv7 program 9 , which were exported to MEGA-X 10 for Neighbor-Joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree construction with 1000 bootstrap support and genetic .

Structural genes/proteins were aligned with closely related sequences using Clustal Omega Program 11 . High Binding Affinity (HBA) epitope identification. In order to identify the potential target peptides for vaccine design, the structural protein sequences of highly conserved and annotated representative 2019-nCoV strain Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947.3) were used to predict the CD4 T-cell epitopes (TCEs) with the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) consensus tool by IEDB recommended prediction method 12, 13 . To identify the most immunodominant (IMD) CD4 epitopes, we employed the computational approach described previously 14 . For all the possible 15-mer peptides from the SPs, the binding affinity was predicted using six most prevalent Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA; MHC Class-II DR) alleles (http://allelefrequencies.net/) that cover most of the ethnic population in China (PRC), Thailand (TH) and Japan (JPN) (Supplemental Table 2 ). Since, the prevalence of dominant HLA-DR types may vary in human populations from different countries, the prevalent six HLA-DR alleles covering Asia-Pacific region 14 and Global population data sets have been used for binding affinity predictions to assess the generality of those predicted epitopes with high binding affinities (HBA). We calculated the average binding affinity score for each predicted 15mer peptides against all the predominant HLA-DR types from each country/region using a sliding window approach ( Figure 2 ). This approach is more efficient as the epitopes predicted with average HBA (IC <=10 nM), indicate that those epitopes are more likely to bind and enhance a cellular immune response in the studied population. (Table 1C) . Whereas, M protein shared 98.6% identity with one amino acid insertion (position 4, S) and N protein showed 99% identity with 4 non-synonymous changes (P37S, S215G, S243G, Q267A).
