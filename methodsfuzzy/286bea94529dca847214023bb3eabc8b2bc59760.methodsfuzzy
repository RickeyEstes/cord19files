Study sites and design. Findings from a prospective, hospital-based, multicenter, longitudinal study, conducted at five sites in four countries located on three continents, were analyzed: Lucknow and Vadu in India, Antananarivo in Madagascar, Bamako in Mali, and San Lorenzo in Paraguay. The participating sites are members of the GABRIEL (Global Approach to Biological Research, Infectious Diseases and Epidemics in Low-Income Countries) Network established by Fondation Mérieux. 11 The study protocol and sites are described elsewhere. 12 Pneumonia cases from the original case-control study were followed up during hospital stay and constituted the analyzed cohort. The study population comprised children aged between 2 and 60 months, complying with protocol definitions and inclusion criteria. Eligible patients were identified by study clinicians at each participating site. All consecutive patients hospitalized in pediatric departments, who were eligible for study entry, were enrolled during each season (dry and rainy) for at least a 1-year period. The study aimed at obtaining an equal number of individuals in each season at each study site. Incident cases were defined as hospitalized children aged 2-60 months, with clinical features of pneumonia, as described latter, radiological confirmation of pneumonia on chest X-ray as per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, 13 and informed consent statement signed by the children's parents or legal guardian. Wheezing at auscultation was initially an exclusion criterion, but was amended because it slowed the inclusion process. Thus, it was finally decided to include children presenting pneumonia with or without "wheezing." The present study selectively comprised sites with better quality data on oxygen saturation (SO 2 ) at admission, mortality among pneumonia cases, and documented recording of patient follow-up during hospitalization. Main characteristics were compared by site, and multivariate analysis accounted for heterogeneity of sites regarding observed or non-observed potential confounding factors. Patients with missing data on follow-up, SO 2 measurement, and vital status at discharge were excluded (N = 59). Excluded patients did not differ from those analyzed for gender and weight-for-height Z score, but were older (P = 0.03). Definition of pneumonia. Pneumonia cases were defined by the following criteria: Data sources and quality control. Data quality was monitored and evaluated by each site and by the Emerging Pathogens Laboratory (Lyon, France) for pooled data analysis. Demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, medical history, clinical examination at enrollment, therapeutics, vaccinations, and outcomes were recorded prospectively for each patient on a standardized paper form. Each potential error was discussed with local investigators, and a final ruling was applied. The principal investigator at each site was informed about quality assessments and was involved in their resolution. Hypoxemia was defined as SO 2 < 90%, according to WHO recommendations. 15 SO 2 was measured at hospital admission, before the administration of oxygen or other therapeutics. Vital status was recorded until patient discharge. Biological samples. Samples were collected in the first 48 hours of patient hospitalization. Nasal swabs/aspirates, whole blood, and pleural effusions (in case of pleurisy) were sampled from all patients. Urine was collected at patient admission to ascertain history of antibiotic use. Biological samples were taken before the in-hospital administration of antibiotics. Whole blood allowed complete blood count and culture, with real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the identification of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae type B. C reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were quantified in serum. Respiratory specimens permitted the identification of viruses and bacteria by RT Streptococcus pneumoniae-positive specimens were serotyped by multiplex RT-PCR that detects 29 different serotypes. A centralized, blinded PCR respiratory quality control panel was provided to all sites to ensure procedure validation on-site before specimens were processed locally. Statistical methods. Qualitative variables were described as numbers and percentages with comparison by χ 2 test, if appropriate, or Fischer's exact test. Quantitative variables were reported as median and interquartile range (IQR) and compared by the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance. Positive likelihood (LR+) and negative likelihood (LR _ ) ratios of various clinical signs and symptoms were calculated to detect hypoxemic cases with the following formulae: LR+ = sensitivity/(1 _ specificity) and LR _ = (1 _ sensitivity)/specificity. It has been underlined that LR calculation is useful to improve diagnostic accuracy. 16 LR could thus express the proportion of hypoxemic children who presented a particular sign or symptom divided by the proportion of non-hypoxemic children with the same result. Microbiological findings from different sample sites associated with hypoxemia were assessed by logistic regression modeling. Multivariate analysis was performed after univariate analysis, with forced adjustment on patient age, time per quarter, and study center. Microorganisms with P < 0.15 values on univariate analysis were initially entered in the multivariate model. Thus, backward stepwise deletion was applied until all P values were < 0.05. Models were compared by Wald testing. Factors associated with in-hospital mortality were assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves and compared by log-rank test. Follow-up was censored at 14 days after admission or discharge, if duration of hospitalization was less than 14 days. The characteristics of patients deceased within 2 weeks (N = 13) were compared with non-deceased patients (N = 392). Univariate and bivariate proportional hazard Cox regression analyses were undertaken. No multivariate Cox model was fitted owing to the limited number of events. Bivariate analyses expressed the effect of one major risk factor from univariate analysis adjusted on one other possible confounder (age category, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] seropositivity, time per quarter, or weightfor-height Z score). All tests were two tailed, and P < 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was conducted with Stata version 13.0 (StataCorp., College Station, TX). Ethics. The study protocol, informed consent statement, clinical research form, amendments, and all other study documents were submitted to and approved by the institutional research ethics committee of each site.
