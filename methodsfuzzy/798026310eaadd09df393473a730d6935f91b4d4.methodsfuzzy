The sequences of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (accession numbers in NCBI are shown in the Table 1 ) from Peru, Argentina, China, and so on in Homo sapiens are downloaded and examined. Specifically, coding sequences within Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome are selected according to the following: (1) containing more than 300 bases, (2) starting with the start codon, (3) number of bases being a multiple of 3, and (4) having no stop codon in the inner sequence. Thus, a total of 12965 coding sequences for Mycobacterium tuberculosis are selected (originally the total of coding sequences is 24520).
