To compare the distribution of H5N1 virus in animals infected via the conventional method with that in animals infected via the aerosol method, animals from each group were euthanized on day 4 post-infection and organ samples were collected for virus titration. Relatively high virus titers were detected in the tonsils of all infected animals in both groups ( Table 2) . Viruses were recovered from the nasal mucosa, trachea, and bronchus of some of the infected animals in both groups (Table 2 ). Additionally, virus was recovered from the mediastinal lymph nodes of two and one of Animal ID Virus titers (log 10 PFU/ml) of animals infected with VN3040 virus via the: Aerosol method #1-4 #2-2 #3-1 #3-2 #1-9 #2-3 #3-3 #3-4 Table 1 . Virus titers in nasal swabs from cynomolgus macaques infected with the H5N1 virus via the conventional or aerosol method a . a Cynomolgus macaques were inoculated with 4 ml of a 10 7 PFU/ml solution of A/Vietnam/UT3040/2004 virus (VN3040) by the conventional method (through a combination of the intratracheal, intranasal, ocular, and oral routes) or via the aerosol method by using a nebulizer. b -, virus not detected (detection limit: 1.3 log 10 PFU/ml).
