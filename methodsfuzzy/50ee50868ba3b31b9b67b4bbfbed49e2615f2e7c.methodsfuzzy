As stated in the introduction, this paper seeks to illuminate attitudes towards tourism crises and ways of dealing with them from the perspective of senior industry managers based in Penang. A qualitative research methodology was considered most suitable for the purpose, involving semi-structured face-to-face interviews in which a set of pre-determined questions were asked. Such an approach allowed comparisons amongst the responses of participants and afforded the chance to digress and probe further when appropriate. Issues raised were the types of tourism crises that had struck the businesses, outcomes, industry reactions and crisis management strategies. A total of twelve key persons judged to be industry leaders were interviewed and the sample was selected using the purposeful snowball method. According to this method, personal links were used to identify suitably knowledgeable respondents. The sample size for this study was determined by using the criterion of 'saturation', as defined by Patten (2007, p.152) : "at the point at which several additional participants fail to respond with new information that leads to the identification of additional themes, the researcher might conclude that the data collection process has become saturated". The managers represented hotels, official tourism departments, airlines, tour operators and travel agents. Material collected was subject to qualitative thematic analysis which is a means of identifying, describing and reporting the content of data and emergent patterns. It aims to uncover the themes which are prevalent within a text at different levels and is a well established tool in qualitative research. Results thereby discerned are outlined in the next section which features direct quotations to support the findings.
