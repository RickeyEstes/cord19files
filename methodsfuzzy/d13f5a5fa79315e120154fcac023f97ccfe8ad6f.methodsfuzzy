Several experimental strategies have been developed to determine the in vivo contribution of a specific cell type to the type I IFN response during infections (78) . Initially, antibody mediated depletion has been utilized frequently to ablate pDCs and monocytes (79) . Antibodies against Ly6G/C (also known as Gr1) and CD317 (also known as BST-2) have been used to deplete pDCs in vivo and in vitro (18, (79) (80) (81) (82) (83) (84) (85) (86) (87) . However, these antibodies generally target multiple cell types in addition to pDCs: The antibody RB6-8C5 directed against Ly6G/C reacts strongly with neutrophil-specific Ly6G antigen, but cross-reacts also with the Ly6C Ag (88) expressed on pDCs as well as on monocytes/macrophages, activated T cells, NK cells, plasma cells, and endothelial cells (89) (90) (91) (92) . Likewise, CD317 is recognized by the three different antibody clones 120G8.04, JF05-1C2.4.1 (also known as PDCA-1), and eBio927, and is expressed in naïve mice by pDCs, but also plasma cells. Following stimulation with type I IFNs and IFNγ CD317 is upregulated, additionally, on several other myeloid and lymphoid cells (79, 93) . Finally, in vivo treatment with clodronate-containing liposomes depletes phagocytes in mice, but also disturbs the microarchitecture of secondary lymphoid organs (94, 95) . In the past years, several genetically modified mouse lines with a constitutive or inducible lack of specific cell types attributed to produce type I IFN have become available ( Table 1 and Figure 1 ) (78) . For pDCs, already several mouse models exist for constitutive or inducible ablation. Mice carrying a hypomorphic mutation at the Ikaros locus express low levels of the transcription factor Ikaros (Ik L/L ) and therefore lack peripheral pDCs, but no other DC subsets (61) . When using this line as a "pDC-less" model, one has to take into account that other hematopoietic lineages including T and B cells and neutrophils are also affected by the Ik L/L mutation, and that Ik L/L mice start to develop thymic lymphomas by 10 weeks of age (62, 96, 97) . Constitutive deletion of E2-2, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, also known as TCF4, that controls development and maintenance of pDCs, results in perinatal lethality in mice (98) . To overcome this lethality and to specifically ablate the pDC lineage, mice harboring a constitutively deleted and a floxed Tfc4 allele (Tcf4 flox/− ) have been crossed to Itgax-Cre (CD11c-Cre) or Rosa26-CreER mice in which Cre is expressed in DCs or can be induced ubiquitously after tamoxifen administration, respectively (63, 64, 99, 100) . Another strategy uses Diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR)mediated conditional and targeted cell depletion. CLEC4A-DTR-tg mice express DTR under the human pDC specific promotor of the C-type lectin domain family 4 member A (CLEC4A; also known as blood dendritic cell antigen 2, BDCA2). Administration of diphtheria toxin (DT) in these CLEC4A-DTR-tg mice results in transient but specific depletion of pDCs (65) . In an alternative approach, a cDNA encoding the human DTR fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and preceded by an IRES was inserted into the 3 ′ untranslated region of the Siglech gene. This Siglech dtr/dtr mouse model allows specific elimination of pDCs in vivo via injection of DT (66) . An analogous mouse line termed SiglecH-DTR-tg was generated using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic technology (67) . SiglecH represents a sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin that exerts immunomodulatory roles in antiviral immune responses. In SiglecH eGFP/+ mice, heterozygous for the reporter gene, it was shown that in addition to pDCs, SiglecH was
