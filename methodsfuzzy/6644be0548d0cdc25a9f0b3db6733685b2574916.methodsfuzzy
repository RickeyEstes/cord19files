This is a retrospective descriptive study. No informed consent was necessary as the study being retrospective. Institutional hospital information system (HIS) and radiology picture archiving computer system (PACS) were reviewed for patients confirmed positive for corona virus by serological test (real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates according to Case Definition and Surveillance Guidance for MERS-CoV Testing in Saudi Arabia -13 May 2014. Laboratory workup includes complete blood picture, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein. A total of 12 patients were included in our study. Laboratory tests include complete blood picture, C-reactive protein, ESR and virus profile. All patients were subjected to serial X-ray -one view frontal radiograms. Upon presentation; 8 cases were able to be imaged in postero-anterior view while the rest were done in AP view whether in supine or setting position. Follow-up X-ray was obtained on daily bases. X-ray was done on Siemens Multix vertex (Germany): PA: averaging kV 125 and mAs 3.2 and AP: kV 70-77 and mAs 4-6.3) Siemens or Axiom Aristos (Germany): Kv125 and mAs: 1.99. High resolution non-contrast CT chest was also obtained for 10 patients. The machine is Toshiba Aquilion Vision 320 CT scanner -Japan: CT is usually obtained 1-2 days after admission. Follow-up CT was done in all of the 6 treated patients usually once 2-3 days after initial CT. In two cases follow-up high resolution CT was done for three times. Reconstruction was done into Axial 1 mm thick standard lung settings and axial, coronal and sagittal 5 mm thick soft tissue settings. Images were sent to the PACS (Agfa healthcare system). The scans were reviewed for findings including consolidation, ground-glass opacities, nodules, reticular opacities and hilar and mediastinal adenopathy. The findings were categorized into focal or diffuse and unilateral or bilateral. Predominant distribution was also assessed as being in the upper, middle, or lower lung zone and as being in a random, predominantly central or peribronchovascular, or subpleural location. These lesions were defined as follows: Consolidation was defined as ill-defined homogeneous opacity obscuring vessels. Nodular opacities are those with foci with rounded contour. Reticular opacities were defined as linear opacities forming a meshlike pattern (7).
