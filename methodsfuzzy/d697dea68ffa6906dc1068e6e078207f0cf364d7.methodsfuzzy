Mass 41 20 and 1336-1360 in the Ark 99 21 of S1 gene. The Mass specific upper primer (5′ CTGGGTG Virus and culture conditions TATTGTT GGTACTA TTC 3′) is located at 270-294 nucleotide 20 and the Ark specific primer (5′ ACATTGT Table 1 shows a list of IBV strains representing six TTTAAGA GCGGATCT AA 3′) is located at the 464serotypes and three variants, and other avian patho-488 position 21 of the S1 gene. All primers were syngens and their sources. The IBV and Newcastle Disthesized by the Biotechnology Center, at the ease Virus (NDV) were propagated in 11-day-old University of Connecticut. specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated eggs. The allantoic fluids were harvested after 36 h of incubation at 37°C. Avian reovirus was propagated in chicken Reverse transcription (RT) and multiplex PCR embryo fibroblasts and plaque purified as described reaction previously. 17 Mycoplasma gallisepticum S6 was grown in Frey's media. 18 The reverse transcription reaction was conducted using GeneAmp PCR Kit (Perkin Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT, USA). The reaction contained 4 l of 80 m
