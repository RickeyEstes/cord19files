Cells, viruses, and antibodies. HuH-7 cells (kindly provided by Ralf Bartenschlager, Heidelberg University) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Lonza) supplemented with 8% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum (FCS; Bodinco), 2 mM L-glutamine (PAA Laboratories), and nonessential amino acids (PAA Laboratories). 293T cells (kindly provided by the Virgin lab, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, MO) were cultured in DMEM with 10% (vol/vol) FCS. All cell culture media contained 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. Infection of HuH-7 cells with MERS-CoV (EMC/2012 strain kindly provided by Ron Fouchier, Erasmus Medical Center, The Netherlands [3, 4] ) was performed as previously described (21) . Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-HA (clone HA.C5; Abcam), mouse anti-␤-actin (clone AC-74; Sigma), and mouse anti-V5 (clone 2F11F7; Thermo Fisher). A rabbit serum recognizing SARS-CoV-nsp3 that cross-reacts with MERS-CoV nsp3 has been previously described (21, 22) . A polyclonal rabbit serum was used against a combination of two MERS-CoV nsp5 peptides, SGLVKMSHPSGDVEAC (amino acids 3248 to 3263 of pp1a) and CPADQLSDPNYDALLI (amino acids 3291 to 3306), which was produced by Eurogentec. Plasmid construction and transfection. Human codon-optimized coding sequences of MERS-CoV nsp3-6 were designed using GeneArt, ordered from Thermo Fisher in four fragments, and subsequently assembled in low-copy-number vector pACNR1180 (64) using conventional cloning. The precise parts of MERS-CoV pp1a used for polyprotein constructs are outlined in Table S1 in the supplemental material. The nsp4 construct included the 21 C-terminal aa of nsp3 to prevent the N-terminal hydrophobic region of nsp4 from acting as a signal sequence, which could result in improper membrane insertion. In all constructs with a C-terminal myc or V5 tag, the C-terminal glutamine of the viral sequence was omitted to prevent the removal of the tag by M pro . The SARS-CoV nsp3 gene (Frankfurt 1 strain, pp1a amino acids 819 to 2740) was synthesized by Bio Basic Inc. (Ontario, Canada). Coding sequences were transferred to the pCAGGS expression vector (Addgene) for expression. pCAGGS-SARS-nsp4 was described previously (42) . 293T cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HuH-7 cells were transfected using a Nucleofector 2b device (Lonza) with Nucleofector kit T (Lonza) in 6 ϫ 10 6 cells and 12 g of plasmid DNA per transfection. Cotransfections were carried out with equimolar amounts of plasmids. Western blotting. Cells were lysed in 2ϫ Laemmli sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% [vol/vol] glycerol, 4% [wt/vol] sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 20 mM dithiothreitol, 0.02 mg/ml bromophenol blue) and separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Amersham) using a Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked with 5% (wt/vol) ELK skimmed milk powder (Campina) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 20. Secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies (Dako) and ECL Plus Western blotting substrate (Thermo Fisher) were used to visualize protein signal. Immunofluorescence microscopy. After electroporation, HuH-7 cells were seeded on coverslips and fixed 24 h later with 3% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in PBS. Samples were permeabilized with 0.2% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 and incubated with antibodies, including fluorescent conjugates, diluted in 5% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Nuclei were stained with 1 g/ml Hoechst 33258. After embedding with Prolong Gold (Thermo Fisher), samples were analyzed with a Leica TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope, which was equipped with a 63ϫ objective (numerical aperture [NA] 1.40; 1 Airy unit) and a Leica HyD hybrid detector. and incubated with antibody overnight. Antibody-protein complexes were then pulled down using protein A and protein G Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), which were first blocked with 2% (wt/vol) BSA in PBS, and incubated for several hours. After repeated washing of the beads with IP buffer, proteins were eluted by heating in 2ϫ Laemmli sample buffer. After separation on large 10% polyacrylamide gels and gel drying, signal was visualized using an Imaging Screen-K (Bio-Rad) and a Typhoon 9410 scanner (GE Healthcare). Electron microscopy. Transfected HuH-7 or 293T cells were fixed 24 h posttransfection in 1.5% (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde in 0.10 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in 0.14 M cacodylate buffer, samples were postfixed and stained at 4°C with 1% (wt/vol) osmium tetroxide in 0.10 M cacodylate buffer for 1 h. After washing with 0.14 M cacodylate and Milli-Q water, cells were scraped and stained with 1% (wt/vol) tannic acid in Milli-Q water on a 3D rotator for 1 h at room temperature. Following washing with Milli-Q water, cells were spun down in heated 3% (wt/vol) agar in PBS, and after solidification, pellets were excised, cut into small blocks, and dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol. Samples were embedded in epoxy resin (LX-112; Ladd Research), and after polymerization, 100-nm sections were placed on mesh-100 copper EM grids covered with a carboncoated Pioloform layer. Following poststaining with 7% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate, samples were analyzed on an FEI Tecnai 12 BioTwin microscope equipped with an Eagle cooled slow-scan charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (FEI) and operated at 120 kV. Measurements of circular profiles from 2D EM images were done with ImageJ software and Aperio Imagescope software (Leica). Circular profiles were measured over their longest and shortest axes, and the geometric mean of those values was used as the diameter. One hundred circular profiles were measured for each condition. Electron tomography. Sections of 150-nm thickness were cut from the resin-embedded blocks of transfected HuH-7 or 293T cells prepared as described above. Prior to poststaining, colloidal gold particles of 10 nm were applied to both sides of the EM grid to serve later as fiducial markers for alignment. Tomography data were recorded on an Eagle CCD camera (FEI) in an FEI Tecnai 12 BioTwin (HuH-7 samples) or a Twin (293T samples) electron microscope operated at 120 kV, with the grids mounted on a 2040 Fischione tomography holder. Dual-axis tilt series of the regions of interest were collected using Xplore3D software (FEI) at magnifications that resulted in a pixel size of 1.7 nm (BioTwin data) or 1.4 nm (Twin data). The angular coverage for each single-axis tilt series was 130°sampled in
