The calculation of sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the semi-automated surveillance system was executed according to standard epidemiological methods. Accuracy was defined as the proportion of true positives and true negatives in all evaluated cases. The c-square test was used to test differences in categorical variables. All calculations were performed with STATA version 15 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA).
