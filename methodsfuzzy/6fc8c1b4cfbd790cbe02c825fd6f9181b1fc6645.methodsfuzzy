Given the high workload of NHS Direct staff during our study, the most pragmatic way to obtain sufficient participants for our analysis was to ask call centre staff to recruit up to five participants each. This essentially provided us with a convenience sample. As such, we cannot provide any meaningful response rate for the study: it is not clear how many participants were asked to participate in the research, but declined. Nonetheless, we believe that the themes we identified do reflect the key variables that were important in causing people to seek advice from NHS Direct and to find their contact with NHS Direct reassuring or useful. We have no reason to believe that our sampling excluded a large subset of patients whose experiences or perceptions were qualitatively different from those who were included. Although we were unable to feed back our results to the initial callers in order to gauge their credibility, presentation of our results to an NHS Direct call centre team suggested that the issues we identified did appear to be complete, although it is possible that some small subgroups, such as pregnant women or GPs may have had different concerns when they called in. The relative importance of each of the subthemes that we identified is less clear. Quantitative research with a more robust sampling strategy would be required to answer questions such as what proportion of patients contact the health services due to worry, what proportion obtain benefit from a discussion of how one can become exposed to a particular hazard, and what proportion remain concerned about a major public health incident despite receiving reassurance. Whether the sub-themes we identified are more generally applicable to other major incidents involving the release of a chemical, biological or radiological hazard, or whether they are specific to swine flu is also unclear. However, we have previously noted similar themes among members of the public who spoke to the Health Protection Agency following the dispersal of radioactive polonium 210 in central London in 2006 [14] . Additional research to identify the factors that motivate people to contact the health services during future incidents and the key aspects of that contact that help to reassure them is required.
