Test compounds. Recombinant gp120 from HIV-1(III B ), produced in CHO cells, and HIV-1(YU2), produced in insect cells, were purchased from Immunodiagnostics (Woburn, MA). ␣-1,2-Mannobiose and ␣-1,3mannobiose were purchased from Dextra (United Kingdom). Laminin, from human placenta, and mucin, partially purified from porcine stomach, were purchased from Sigma, while BSA-GlcNAc was purchased from Dextra Laboratories (United Kingdom). Viruses, cell lines, and cell cultures. HIV-1 R5 strain BaL and HIV-1 X4 strain NL4.3 were originally obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH). MT-4 cells were a gift from L. Montagnier (during that time at the Pasteur Institute, Paris, France) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; HyClone, Perbio Science) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen) at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 controlled atmosphere. PBMCs from healthy donors were isolated from buffy coats obtained from the Blood Transfusion Centre (UZ Leuven, Belgium). PBMCs were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 2 ng/ml interleukin-2 (IL-2; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were activated with 2 g/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA; Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 days before infection with HIV-1. TZM-bl cells were obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH). Expression and purification of FimH-LD, N-Als3p, N-Als1p, and N-Epa1p. The sequence of FimH-LD from E. coli K-12 (strain K514) was used for this work (residues 22 to 179; UniProt entry P08191). The cloning, expression, and purification of FimH-LD have been previously described (10) . The N-terminal parts of the Als3, Als1, and Epa1p proteins were expressed in and purified from S. cerevisiae and E. coli as previously described (22, 27) . Glycan array screening. The N-terminal parts of Als3p and Als1p were subjected to glycan array screening for binding to glycans printed on a glass slide microarray (version 5.0) developed by the CFG (5). Screening of Als3p was performed at concentrations of 20 and 200 g/ml. The adhesins were labeled with NT-647 dye via an amine-coupling method (NanoTemper) (see the supplemental material). SPR. SPR experiments were performed with a Biacore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare) at 25°C. The recombinant gp120 envelope proteins, BSA-GlcNAc, FN, mucin, and laminin were covalently immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip by amine-coupling chemistry. A reference flow cell chemically treated in the same way as the ligand flow cell was used as a control. For FimH-LD-gp120 kinetic analysis, fitting of experimental curves and calculation of kinetic parameters were performed by using the BIAEvaluation software version 4.1 (GE Healthcare) and a 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model. In all of the other cases, dissociation constants in the equilibrium state (K D ) were determined. The results were then analyzed with the BIAevaluation software and with Prism 6 software (Graph-Pad) (see the supplemental material). AFM-SMFS. AFM-SMFS experiments to determine the unbinding force between HIV-1(YU2) gp120 and FimH-LD were performed as described in the supplemental material. LGI network construction. The results of the glycan array screenings for FimH-LD (L. Wyns, 2011, CFG database, glycan array version 5.0) N-Als1p (first screening, glycan array version 3.2 [22] ; second screening, CFG glycan array version 5.0 [this work]), N-Als3p, N-Epa1p (28), N-Epa6p, and N-Epa7p (85) were retrieved from the CFG-Core H database (http://www.functionalglycomics.org/) and used to generate the Als/ Epa-glycan interaction networks. The results were filtered by removing the data of three times the standard error of the mean (SEM) and using a signal-to-noise ratio cutoff value that was larger than the average number of relative fluorescence units (RFU). The signal-to-noise ratio cutoff value was visually selected on the glycan array screening graphs. The RFU values were normalized by dividing the values by the maximal RFU value of the screening. The mean RFU value was used when more than one value was detected in different screenings for the same glycan interaction. Glycanbinding protein binding sites may accommodate glycan determinants made up of two to six linear monosaccharides together with their potential side chains containing other sugars and modifications (4) . Therefore, glycan determinant structures containing oligosaccharides composed of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbohydrate residues present at the nonreducing end were submitted to the GlycoSuiteDB database in the UniCarbKB platform (46, 47) . In order to obtain the glycoproteomic data, we developed a set of three Perl scripts that collaborated to extract the data from the GlycosuiteDB website (see the supplemental material). LGI network modeling and visualization. The interactions were modeled as a weighted undirected graph G(V, E, W), where V is the set of vertices, E is the set of edges connecting the pairs of vertices, and W is the set of weights associated with each edge. The edges' weights were calcu-lated according to the interaction type (see the supplemental material). The Gephi open-source graph visualization and manipulation software was used (86) . Within Gephi, the force-directed visualization method of Hu (49) , which is known to be accurate when visualizing local clustering and symmetry (87) , was used. This approach allowed us to obtain relatively well-defined spatial distributions and local clusters according to the network structure ( Fig. 2 and 5) . The LGI networks were also visualized as a hierarchical structure by using Cytoscape 2.8 (88) and the Cerebral app (89) (see the supplemental material). MTS-PES antiviral assays. The anti-HIV-1 activity of each compound, both alone and in combination, in MT-4 cell cultures was determined by a tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay. Briefly, 3-fold dilutions of the test compounds were added to a 96-well plate, and it was preincubated for 20 min at 37°C with MT-4 cells. Five days postinfection, CPEs were scored microscopically and antiviral activity was measured by the MTS-PES method with a SpectraMax 96-well plate reader (Molecular Devices) as described previously (90) . PHA-stimulated PBMCs were resuspended in cell culture medium supplemented with 2 ng/ml IL-2 and seeded into 48-well plates (Iwaki Glass) containing various concentrations of test compounds. After 20 min of preincubation at 37°C, infection with HIV-1 was performed. IL-2 was added at days 3 and 6 postinfection. Supernatant was collected at day 10, and viral replication was measured with an HIV-1 p24 Ag ELISA (PerkinElmer) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. TZM-bl-HIV-1 infectivity luminescence assay. Firefly luciferaseand E. coli ␤-galactosidase-expressing CD4 ϩ CXCR4 ϩ CCR5 ϩ TZM-bl cells were resuspended in cell culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS and 1% HEPES) supplemented with 15 g/ml DEAE-dextran (Sigma-Aldrich, Diegem, Belgium) and preincubated for 30 min at 37°C in cell culture medium-diluted test compounds in 96-well plates. Next, a laboratory HIV-1 strain (X4 NL4.3 or R5 BaL) was added according to the 50% tissue culture infective dose of the viral stock. Two days postinfection, CPEs were first scored microscopically, and afterward, viral replication was measured by luminescence. Steadylite plus reagent (PerkinElmer) was mixed with lyophilized substrate in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines. Supernatant was removed, and the steadylite plus substrate solution was added to the 96-well plates. Next, the plates were incubated in the dark for 10 min in a closed plate shaker. Finally, cell lysis was scored microscopically and aliquots were transferred to white Lumitrac 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) to measure the relative luminescence units with a SpectraMax L microplate reader and SoftMax Pro Software (Molecular Devices), an integration time of 0.6 s, and a dark adaptation time of 5 min.
