Other techniques used for the establishment of serological relationships among parvoviruses include (1) immunodiffusion and (2) microagglutination as seen in the electron microscope. Immunodiffusion has the drawback that concentrated, purified antigen prepa rations are required. In our experience, the best results in the Ouchterlony doublediffusion technique are obtained at a virus concentration of about 0.1 optical density unit (at 260 nm, 1 cm pathway) per ml. Though Atchison et al. (1966) successfully employed this method for studying the distribution of antibodies, in general the use of this technique has been rather limited.

Though microagglutination [or immune electron microscopy (IEM)] necessi tates the use of an electron microscope, this technique is rather simple and economical. Negative staining of virus without prior treatment with specific antivirus antiserum may often result in a very sparse distribution of virus par ticles; also, different parvoviruses are virtually indistinguishable by electron microscopy. Virus suspensions treated with specific antiglobulin result in the formation of virus-antibody complexes which adhere to the grid and can readily be recognized in the electron microscope, even at low magnification (Karasaki, 1966) . The aggregates have a strong tendency to stick to the surface of the supporting film so that cellular debris is easily eliminated by subsequent washings. Karasaki (1966) observed that a low antibody concentration (e.g., 1:640) pro vided optimal conditions and that with this technique even capsid architecture could be studied. Yates et al. (1973) obtained an efficient aggregation using concentrated antiserum solutions (1:2 or 1:10), but the fibrous material (anti body) around the virions obscured their fine structure. This technique has been proven useful and very convenient in a number of cases (Table VIII) .
