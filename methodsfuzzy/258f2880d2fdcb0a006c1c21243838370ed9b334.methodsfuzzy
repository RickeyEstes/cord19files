All relevant information about the botanical description, ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemicals, pharmacological activities of C. serrata were collected from published literatures. The electronic databases used for the collection of relevant information include; Google Scholar, Summon (Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University Portal), Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct and Springer Link. The key words; "C. serrata"; "Toona serrata"; "Meliaceae"; "Flavonoids"; "phytochemical"; "active constituents", "ethanopharmacology"; "ethnomedicinal"; "antioxidant"; "antiglycating"; "anti-infective"; "antimicrobial"; "antifungal"; "Leishmanicidal"; "anti-diabetic", were searched with no time limit. Books such as; "The Handbook of Naturally Occurring Insecticidal Toxins", "Trees of Pakistan" and "Herbalism, Phytochemistry, and Ethnopharmacology" along with thesis "Phytochemical studies of two plants Ziziphus oxyphylla and C. serrata" were studied for gathering the relevant information. Chemical structures were drawn using ChemDraw pro 8.0 software. PubChem database was used to check IUPAC names of phytochemicals reported for the plant.
