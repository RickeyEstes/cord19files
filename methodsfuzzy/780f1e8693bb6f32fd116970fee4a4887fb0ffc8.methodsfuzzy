Firstly, to assess the accuracy of our proposed approach in measuring vital signs, reference measurements were conducted simultaneously and independently for comparisons. Specifically, the heart rates of all 101 subjects calculated by our method were compared with the ones obtained from a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor. The PPG signal were processed by a Heart Rate Analysis Toolkit [37] to measure the reference heart rates. For the respiratory rate, the reference values were measured by manually counting how many times the subject's chest rises during the 30-second monitoring period. Three staff separately did the count to obtain a reliable reference. Our filtering method, with different orders of the band-pass and lowpass Butterworth filters, namely the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th, was compared with the reference measures. A Student's t-test [39] was employed to find the most appropriate orders. The test showed whether the means of two samples are different from each other, and how significant the differences are, based on statistical computation. In this study, to evaluate the performance of the signal processing stage, the t-test was applied for the vital signs obtained by our proposed method and the reference methods. Secondly, to evaluate the accuracy of the two classification measures, the k-fold cross-validation method [40] was employed. The entire dataset was shuffled randomly and split into k similar-in-size disjoint subsets. (k -1) subsets were used for training, and the remaining subset was used for testing, which is also called the hold-out cross-validation set. The model made predictions of all samples in the holdout set, and by comparing those with the ground truth class labels, all evaluation metrics such as training accuracy, precision, recall and f 1 -score [41] were collected. The process is repeated k times, which means each subset is used 1 time as the hold-out set and (k -1) times for the training stage. The precision (P) and the recall (R) are defined as: The precision score measures the accuracy of a machine learning model in terms of false positive cases, i.e., the number of infected patients predicted to be healthy. The lower the false positive cases, the higher the precision of the model. Meanwhile, the recall score gives information about false negative cases, which is the number of predictions that a person has an infectious disease but is actually healthy. In the context of disease screening, it appears that ignoring infected patients is far more severe than misdiagnosing healthy people; thus the precision makes more sense than the recall in terms of evaluating a model. The f 1 -score is an overall statistical measure that combines and balances both the precision and recall values; thus it is the most suitable metric for model evaluation. In this study, 4-fold cross validation (k ¼ 4) was chosen, which means that each subset constitutes 25% of the entire dataset. To make a reliable assessment about the robustness of a classifier, especially when shuffling the dataset before splitting, the 4-fold cross validation was conducted 10 times repeatedly to obtain the average and standard deviation (STD) of evaluation metrics. However, the cross-validation method was not used to measure the training and testing time of the two classifiers, since this method reduced the size of the dataset used for training. Instead, the entire dataset containing the 3 vital signs of 101 objects was used for training, and only one test case was used for testing. . 4 illustrates the results of the digital signal processing stage and how the three vital signs were computed. In the second subplot, through the band-pass filter, all of the high-frequency noise and respiratory information in the original signal were eliminated, to produce the HR from the extracted cardiac frequency component. The third subplot illustrates the waveform of a reference cardiac signal, monitored by the PPG sensor simultaneously with the radar signal. Meanwhile, the fourth subplot shows the low-pass filtered signal, which contains information to calculate the RR. All red dots represent the peaks detected in the two signals after filtering, by applying Algorithm 1. Then using (4), (5) and (8) , with the measuring time t m ¼ 30s, 32 peaks in the cardiac, and 8 peaks in the respiratory filtered signals, the 3 vital signs were obtained:
