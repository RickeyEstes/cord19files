This was a short-term study (AprileMay 2003). Consent was obtained from the senior medial officer, the patients and their attendants. The physical space, entry and exit system, location, registration area, lobby/corridor, waiting area, triage area, examination rooms, observational beds, emergency X-ray room and laboratory, treatment rooms, nurse's station, staff rest rooms, stores, police post and public relations office were observed. In addition, the patient/attendant load, patient flow, and medical staff practice were observed, and information displayed on SARS or other infectious diseases was noted. The EMOPD has four entrances manned by security guards. These open into a spacious, welllit lobby. There are separate emergency wards for medicine and surgery (total 110 beds), and 28 observational beds. On average, 80e100 patients are admitted daily and almost twice that number of attendants accompany them. A computed tomography (CT) scan/radiology department, seven operating theatres, a blood bank, an attendant waiting room, laboratory, and a public relation officer's room are attached to the EMOPD. No isolation facility is available. At any one time, there is a consultant, two senior residents, three junior residents, four nursing staff and a sanitary staff member present. The principal investigator was a senior resident (MD) in community medicine with six years' experience. He sat with a public health nurse in a lobby near an EMOPD entrance from 08:00 to 17:00 and was on call for the rest of the day. The security guards directed patients with respiratory symptoms to the principal investigator, who asked them and their relatives the SARS screening questions specified in the WHO protocol, i.e. Do you have a fever? Do you have one or more of the following symptoms: cough, shortness of breath, difficult breathing? Have you been in contact with a person with respiratory symptoms in the last 10 days? They were also asked to provide their travel history over the past 10 days. There was no objective assessment of temperature. Patients with at least two of the three symptoms had chest radiographs. The WHO protocol was used to classify the patients as having suspected or probable SARS. 3
