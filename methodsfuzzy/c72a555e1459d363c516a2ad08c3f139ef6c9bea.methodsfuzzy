A clinical isolate of MERS-CoV was kindly provided by R. Fouchier, A. Zaki, and colleagues. 3 The isolate was amplified by one additional passage in Vero cells to make working stocks of the virus (4 Ã‚ 10 5 TCID 50 /ml). All experimental protocol involving live MERS-CoV isolate followed the standard operating procedures of the approved Biosafety Level-3 facility as we previously described. 31 The influenza A/ WSN/1933 (H1N1) virus was expanded in chick embryo as we previously described. 25 Chemical reagents and high-throughput screening (HTS) A total of 1280 pre-existing drug compounds (Microsource Discovery Systems) were screened against influenza A/ WSN/1933 (H1N1) virus. High-throughput screening (HTS) was carried out in a fully automated Beckman Coulter Core System (Beckman Coulter, USA) integrated with a Kendro robotics CO 2 incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at Chemical Genetics Unit, Department of Microbiology, Research Center of Infection and Immunology, Li Kashing Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong as we previously described with modifications. 25 Briefly, compounds were added in 96-well microtitre plates (TPP) in duplicate with a final concentration of 10 mM or 100 mM and 20,000 MadineDarby canine kidney (MDCK) cells per well in 100 ml complete Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated FBS. Cells were then inoculated at an MOI of 0.01 with influenza A/ WSN/1933 (H1N1) virus for detection of broad-spectrum antivirals. After infection, the plates were incubated at 37 C with 5% CO 2 and monitored daily using a Leica DM inverted light microscope for virus-induced CPE. Drugs that gave full protection of MDCK cells (no CPE) were selected for further evaluation with MERS-CoV in a Biosafety Level-3 laboratory. The cytotoxicity of selected drug (Ribavirin: 1600e0.1 mg/ml; IntronA 75,000e4.58 IU/ml; Avonex: 75,000e4.58 IU/ml; Rebif: 250,000e15.26 IU/ml; Betaferon: 50,000e3.05 IU/ml; MMF: 32e0.25 mg/ml) was determined by thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay according to manufacturer's instructions. The endpoint was the 50% effective cytotoxic concentration (TC 50 ).
