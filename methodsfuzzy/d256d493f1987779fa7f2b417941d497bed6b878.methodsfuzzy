Peptidyl-tRNA was precipitated with the cationic detergent cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr), as described previously (12, 16) . The method for the preparation of samples for SDS gel electrophoresis and subsequent fluorography has been described (12) . The radioactivity in specific polypeptides was quantitated by scintillation counting of hydrated excised gel slices in 10 ml of Soluscint A, containing 300 ~1 of Solusol (National Diagnostics).
