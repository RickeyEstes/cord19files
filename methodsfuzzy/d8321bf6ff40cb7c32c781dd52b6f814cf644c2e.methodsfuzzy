Growth media, yeast strains, and plasmid constructs. All strains, plasmids, and plasmid constructs used in this study are described in Table 1 . The full-length N gene of the SARS coronavirus (Singapore isolate) was PCR-amplified from a genomic construct of clone NC_004718, and cloned into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The full-length N gene was subjected to DNA sequencing, and the inserts were verified against the corresponding region of the SARS coronavirus complete genome NC_004718. The full-length N gene was excised from the pCR-XL-TOPO-N construct using the restriction enzymes EcoRI and ClaI, and ligated into the pGADT7 vector to generate an N-terminal in-frame fusion with the GAL4 activation domain (AD). To clone N in fusion with the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, pGADT7-N was digested with NcoI and PstI, and the excised fragment was ligated into the pAS2 vector which was linearized with the same pair of restriction enzymes. HA tagged N was cloned into pSGI by digesting pGADT7-N with BglII and ligating into pSGI digested with the same enzyme. Myc-tagged N was produced by ligating the BamHI and ApaI fragment from pCR-XL-TOPO-N into pcDNA 3.1 vector digested with the same enzymes. All DNA manipulations were performed as described by Sambrook et al. [8] . All deletion constructs were generated by subcloning the full-length N gene as summarized in Table 1 . All constructs were verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. Yeast two-hybrid techniques. The GAL4-based two-hybrid system, kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Elledge [6] , contain pAS2 (DNA binding domain vector) and pACT2 (activation domain vector), together with the yeast reporter strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 (Table 1) were employed. The host strain containing pAS2-SNF1 and pACT2-SNF4 was used as a positive control [9] . The AH109 host contains integrated copies of both HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes under the control of GAL4 binding sites. The AH109 yeast strain was transformed with the appropriate plasmids using the lithium acetate procedure, and grown on SD plates in the absence of Trp and Leu (SDTrp À and SDLeu À , respectively). Protein interaction was tested on SD plates without Leu, Trp, and His (SDLeu À Trp À His À ). After incubation 30°C for 3 days, individual colonies were streaked out and tested for liquid and filter-lift b-galactosidase activity, by 50 mM oft 3-amino-1,2,3-triazole (3AT) assay, and by the diploid His assay. The filter b-galactosidase assay, a parameter directly reflecting the strength of protein-protein interactions, was performed by streaking doubly transformed yeast colonies onto filter paper and allowing them to grow for 2 days on selection medium. Yeast cells were permeabilized by freezing yeast-impregnated filters in liquid nitrogen and thawing at room temperature. The filter was placed over a second filter that was pre-soaked in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 300 mg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D D -galactopyranoside (CPRG) and 0.27% b-mercaptoethanol. Filters were left for 48 h to develop a blue color which indicated a positive protein-protein interaction. The liquid b-galactosidase activity was determined using the substrate CPRG as described previously [10, 11] . Relative enzymatic activity was determined for five independent transformants. Data for quantitative assays were collected for yeast cell number and are means AE SEM of triplicate assays. Appropriate positive and negative controls, and buffer blanks were used. The AH109 host strain containing pAS2-SNF1 and pACT2-SNF4 was used as a positive control [9] . Coimmunoprecipitation assay and Western blotting. COS-1 cells were transfected with the pSGI-N or pCDNA3.1-N plasmid or both using the lipofectine reagent. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed once in PBS and then lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM b-glycerol-PO 4 , 1 mM Na 3 SO 4 ), with protease inhibitor cocktail. Equal amounts of protein were incubated with respective antibodies overnight at 4°C. To the samples was added 100 ll of 10% suspension of protein A-Sepharose. The mixture was allowed to shake for 1 h at 4°C following which the beads were washed four times in lysis buffer, and protein was eluted in 2Â SDS dye by boiling the sample for 5 min. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked using 0.5% non-fat dried milk in PBST for 1 h, and incubated overnight with primary antibody. The blot was then washed thrice in PBST, incubated with anti-mouse IgG HRPO for 1 h and washed thrice and bands were detected using the ECL detection method as recommended by the manufacturer (Cell Signalling Technology).
