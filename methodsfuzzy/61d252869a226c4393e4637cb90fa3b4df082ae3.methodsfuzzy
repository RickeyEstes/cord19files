We collected data on the turnaround time of referrals for fever in the returned traveller to the TDU at Toronto General Hospital from three EDs of Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) and the University Health Network (UHN) between October and December 2013. This enabled establishment of a baseline 'referral wait time' to definitive consultation for febrile returned travellers at our institution.
