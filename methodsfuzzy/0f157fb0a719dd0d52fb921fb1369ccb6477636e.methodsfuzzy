Methods developed by William Gallaher and coworkers to derive models of VFP have been described previously [22, 18, 17, 20] . William Pearson's LALIGN program http:/ /www.ch.embnet.org/software/LALIGN_form.html, which implements a linear-space local similarity algorithm [35] was used to perform regional alignments. PHD (Columbia University Bioinformatics Center, http:// cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/), which is part of the ProteinPredict suite was the preferred method of secondary structure prediction [36] . Domains with significant propensity to form transmembrane helices were identified with TMpred (ExPASy, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/ TMPRED_form.html). TMpred is based on a statistical analysis of TMbase, a database of naturally occurring transmembrane glycoproteins [37] . Sequences with propensity to interface with a lipid bilayer were identified with Membrane Protein eXplorer version 3.0 from the Stephen White laboratory using default settings [38] , which can be used to calculate scores on the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale (WWIHS) [39] .
