The entire sequence of NDM-1, which contains 158 amino acids, was taken from NCBI Protein database with an accession of AB571289. According to the score of BLAST search, the crystal structure of VIM-2, a Zn-b-lactamase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa [40] , was selected as a structural template to perform homology modeling to develop the 3D structure of NDM-1. The PDB code of the crystal structure is 1ko3, which was released in 2008 with a resolution of 2.20 Ã… [40] . The entire sequence of 1ko3 contains 230 amino acids. The sequence alignment between NDM-1 and 1ko3 was performed by the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE), and the alignment result thus obtained indicates that the two proteins have a sequence identity of 43%. Meanwhile, using the web-server EzyPred [41] at http://www. csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/EzyPred/ and the protein sequence information, it was identified that NDM-1 is a member of hydrolases enzyme family (acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds), and so is 1ko3. Since both NDM-1 and 1ko3 belong to a same enzyme family with the same action mechanism, and their sequence identity is higher than 40%, it is quite reasonable to use the crystal structure of 1ko3 [40] as a template to develop the 3D structure of NDM-1 via homology modeling. Based on the sequence alignment ( Fig. 1 ) as well as the atomic coordinates of 1ko3, the 3D structure of NDM-1 was derived by using the I-TASSER algorithm, an extension of the previous TASSER (Threading/Assembly/Refinement) method [42, 43, 44] . The homolog-modeled 3D structure was subject to a short-time molecular dynamics simulation (,3 ns) for further refinement. The final 3D structure thus obtained for NDM-1 is shown in Fig. 2 . Meanwhile, some assessments by the Swiss Model Server indicated that the computed structure is quite reasonable and creditable. Subsequently, molecular docking operations were carried out with Monte Carlo simulated annealing [45] to get the favorable binding interaction modes for NDM-1 respectively with Imipenem and Meropenem, two typical b-lactam antibiotic drugs. It was reported recently [6] that NDM-1 showed a comparatively high resistance to Imipenem and Meropenem. The binding pocket was identified using Q-SiteFinder [46] . Because binding of inhibitors in the active site may induce a conformational change to closing some flaps [47] , we adopted a flexible docking procedure to construct the binding modes of NDM-1 with Imipenem and Meropenem. Before the docking procedure, we extracted 1000 conformations of NDM-1 from the aforementioned 3-ns molecular dynamics simulation. The ligand (Imipenem or Meropenem) was then docked to all of these conformations to search for a favorable binding mode. The docking program [48] used in this study would automatically generate a diversified set of configurations by randomly changing the ligand's coordinates. When a new configuration of the ligand was generated, the search for the favorable binding was operated within a specified 3D box by the simulated annealing to optimize the purely spatial contacts as well as electrostatic interactions. Finally, the favorable binding mode thus obtained was further optimized by a short time molecular dynamics simulation (,5 ns). The binding energy was calculated using a scoring function London dG [49, 50, 51] . In all our calculations, the Merck force field (FFMM94) parameters were adopted. The most favorable binding interactions thus obtained for NDM-1 with Imipenem and Meropenem are given in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 , respectively.
