In vitro infection of SUP-T1 cells with HIV-1 LAI. The design of our experiment comprised treating SUP-T1 cells with HIV-1 strain LAI, UVinactivated HIV-1 strain LAI (HIV UV ), or cell-conditioned medium as mock infection. Experimental steps were performed as described in reference 1 but with the following changes. HIV UV was generated by irradiating HIV preparations for 5 min, a dose we found sufficient to abrogate viral replication in MAGI-CXCR4 cells as detected by X-Gal (5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl-␤-D-galactopyranoside) staining. Lack of replication with HIV UV was confirmed in SUP-T1 cells by viral mRNA load by Taq-Man qPCR (35) . Both live virus and UV-inactivated virus were added to 5 ϫ 10 6 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 5. This dose of live virus was found to achieve 100% infection at 24 hpi with~50% cell viability as measured by trypan blue exclusion assay. Mock infections were performed with an identical volume of SUP-T1-conditioned medium. Each treatment was performed in triplicate, and replicates were sampled at 5, 12, and 24 hpi. RNA preparation and library construction. Total RNA was extracted using the mirVana kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX), and quality and concentration of RNA were determined by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Small RNA libraries were prepared with a small RNA version 1.5 sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Total RNA was ligated with two adaptors: a 3= RNA adaptor specifically modified to target microRNAs (5=-/5rApp/ATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG/3ddC/) and a 5= RNA adaptor that included the sequencing primer (5=-GUUCAGAGUUCUACAGUCCGACGAUC). Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR amplification was performed using the adaptors as primers. The resulting double-stranded cDNA libraries were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 6% Novex Tris-borate-EDTA gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and size selected to eliminate dimerized adaptors. The quality and concentration of libraries were determined by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and RiboGreen fluorescence on QuBit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Next-generation sequencing and read mapping. All libraries were sequenced to a 54-nucleotide (nt) read length on individual lanes of a Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Small RNA sequences were submitted to Geospiza (PerkinElmer, Seattle, WA) for initial analysis. Raw reads were trimmed to remove adapter sequence. Trimmed reads were aligned using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) software against a filter reference containing rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, and mtRNA sequences (36) . The remaining reads were aligned to NCBI build 37.2 of the human genome using BWA and subsequently quantified using genomic annotations for microRNAs (miRBase 17) (7), piRNAs, and known genes (Ref-Seq gene, build 37.2) or classified as unmapped. MicroRNA read count data were obtained from Geospiza (available at http://viromics .washington.edu). By read count, we refer to the number of cDNA fragments that are sequenced and map to a particular genomic feature. Filtering was performed by requiring Ն10 reads in all the samples of at least one condition for a given microRNA. Normalization was applied to the remaining read count data using DESeq, an R software package for testing differential expression, using R version 2.14.1 (13) . Briefly, normalization comprised calculating a size factor for each sample (as the median ratio of read counts for each feature and sample to the geometric mean of read counts for each feature across samples) and dividing all of the read counts in a particular sample by the sample size factor (13) . DE microRNAs were determined using negative binomial tests implemented in DESeq, where dispersion was estimated using a fitted, parametric curve. For comparison, data from HCMV-infected fibroblasts was obtained through the Short-Read Archive (study identifier [ID] SRP009246) (17) . Integrative analysis of small RNA-Seq and mRNA-Seq data. To integrate microRNA and mRNA data, we generated target predictions from three prediction algorithms-TargetScan (37), PITA (38) , and Miranda (39)-accessed through the MAGIA website (40) . We obtained mRNA data from previous mRNA-Seq analysis of the same 12-and 24-hpi HIVand mock-infected samples used to derive the small RNA-Seq data set 1. mRNA data were represented as log 2 fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments (FPKM) in each replicate and identified by Entrez gene IDs as accessed via Biomart in Bioconductor (41) . MicroRNA data were represented as log 2 DESeq-normalized counts with miRBase 17 IDs. For each predicted microRNA-mRNA pairing, we calculated a Pearson correlation coefficient as well as a Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted P value. Significant interactions were identified by negative correlation coefficients associated with adjusted P values of Ͻ0.05. These interactions were used to generate networks in Cytoscape (42) . Functional analysis of mRNA targets of DE microRNAs. To examine annotations associated with target mRNAs, we utilized the NIH David resource (43) . We analyzed up-and downregulated target mRNAs separately in David using the Functional Annotation Chart feature with annotations for GO_BP_Fat, GO_MF_Fat, BioCarta, and KEGG_Pathway and human genome as background. An identical analysis was performed on up-and downregulated DE mRNAs from mRNA-Seq data. Overrepresentation of target mRNAs was determined by one-sided Fisher's exact tests for each annotation term. Identification of candidate novel microRNAs. Candidate novel mi-croRNAs were identified by analyzing genome-mapped small RNA-Seq reads from HIV-and mock-infected samples at 5, 12, and 24 hpi using miRDeep with default parameters (15) . Candidate novel microRNAs were then filtered to include only those present with Ն10 reads in Ն11 out of 17 samples (i.e.,~two-thirds of samples). DE candidate microRNAs were identified using DESeq. As a final filter, we considered only candidates with nonzero expression in mock-and HIV-infected samples at the DE time point for further analysis. The UCSC Genome Browser (44) was used to access other small RNA-Seq data from the ENCODE project (16) as well as evolutionary conservation data via Multiz (45) and GERP scores (46) . qPCR. We performed qPCR for each microRNA using a miRCURY LNA universal RT microRNA PCR system (Exiqon, Woburn, MA). For each assay, we utilized 20 ng of total RNA in an ABI 7900 real-time PCR system with SYBR green-based detection (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each assay was run in triplicate with SYBR green PCR Master Mix (Exiqon, Woburn, MA) for microRNA detection in a 10-l reaction volume.
