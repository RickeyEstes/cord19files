A German Shepherd dog, female, not castrated, eight years old, was brought to the Pet Care Veterinary Hospital, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, with a history of hyporexia and muscle weakness for five days. During anamnesis, the owner told that the animal lives in a place near to dam water having as contactants a horse and a dog of non-defined breed. Both dogs were fed with commercial dog food, vaccinated with anti-rabies vaccine and V10 (vaccine against Hepatitis, Distemper virus, Parvovirus type 2, Parainfluenza, Leptospirosis, Coronavirus, Adenovirus) and received profilactic treatment for ixodidiosis, with fipronil, each three months, whereas the non-defined breed already presented a picture of hemoparasitosis. During the clinical exam the animal presented good hydration, normocoloured mucous membranes, prostration and fever. The hemogram showed leucocytosis by neutrophilia with left shift toxic granulation neutrophils, lymphopenia, eosinophilia and basophilia (Table 1) . The animal's renal function was normal with creatinine values of 0.94 mg/dl (reference value: 0.8-1.8 mg/dl) and urea of 26.6 mg/dl (reference value: 15-40 mg/dl). At the initial treatment, enrofloxacine dose of 5 mg/kg each 12 h and dipiron sodium 25 mg/kg each 8 h was prescribed. An ultrasound exam to evaluate the abdominal organs was requested, whereas the hemogram suggested an active inflammatory process. Two days after the initial admission, the animal returned to the clinic for accomplishing this exam. The dog presented no fever, although prostration. The exam revealed an uncharacteristic presented right kidney and on its topography a ring-like structure involved by a thin hypercogenic capsule of 5.64 cm in diameter in transversal image could be observed (Fig. 1 ) and left kidney with normal topography (Fig. 2) . The ultrasound findings suggested parasitism by D. renale. Urinalysis confirmed the diagnosis by the presence of parasite ova in the urine (Fig. 3) . Treatment was surgical. The patient's right kidney was removed (Fig. 4) . This kidney was enlarged due to the presence of 3 parasites inside the renal capsule, with lengths of 52 cm, 53 cm and 57 cm respectively. The kidney's parenchyma was totally destroyed and only the renal capsule with the nematodes and hemorrhagic exudates inside could be found (Figs. 5-7) . The animal presented excellent surgical recovery and was released one week after surgery.
