Subjects. This study was reviewed and approved by ethics committees in the Ministry of Health in Vietnam as well as the International Medical Center in Japan. Written informed consent had been obtained from all subjects and detailed characteristics of the subjects had been described beforehand [6] . In short, the study population comprised 44 SARS patients in Vietnam, 103 staff members of the same hospital as control subjects, who had come into contact with SARS patients but had not developed SARS, and 50 individuals reflecting the general Vietnamese population, having had no contact history with SARS patients. Out of 44 SARS patients, 22 required oxygen therapy because of hypoxemia, with the other 22 cases, not being hypoxemic, not receiving any such oxygen therapy. There was a significant correlation between the degree of lung involvement in chest radiographs and the requirement of supplementary oxygen. Because of this finding, the progression of SARS in the lung could be reasonably determined from the status of supplementary oxygen ascertained in our previous study [6] . Peripheral blood samples were obtained in all subjects and the genomic DNAs were subsequently extracted [6] . Anti-SARS-CoV antibodies in the blood samples were tested by SARS ELISA (Genelabs Diagnostics, Singapore). Genotyping of allelic variants of the OAS-1, MxA, and PKR genes. The SNPs analyzed in this study were all genotyped utilizing PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methods. It was once held that OAS-1 gene consisted of 8 exons [23] . However, according to the current database of RefSeq gene NM_016816, it comprises six exons. As a result, the A/G SNP (rs#2660) in exon 8 of OAS-1 gene associated with outcome of HCV infection in the previous report by Knapp et al. [22] should have been located in exon 6, which falls on the 3 0 -untranslated region of long transcript E18 (NM_016816). To detect the SNP, genomic DNA was amplified by AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) with primers 25AS-e6F (5 0 -GAG GAC TGG ACC TGC ACC ATC CTC-3 0 ) and 25AS-e6R (5 0 -AGA AAG TCA AGG CTG GAA TTT CAT-3 0 ), and the PCR products of 309 bp were digested with MboII (New England Biolabs) at 37°C for 1 h. The 309 bp product was not cut in the presence of G-allele, but was cut into fragments in the presence of A-allele. Subsequently, the fragment was separated into 188 and 121 bp units on 2% agarose gels with ethidium bromide. We found a non-synonymous SNP in exon 3 of the OAS-1 gene registered in the JSNP database (No. IMS-JST093062, i.e., rs#3741981). The A/G SNP in exon 3 was genotyped by PCR with primers 25AS-e3F (5 0 -ATC AGG AAT GGA CCT CAA GAC TTC-3 0 ) and 25AS-e3R (5 0 -CGG ATG AGG CTC TTG AGC TTG GT-3 0 ), and RFLP with AciI (New England Biolabs). The PCR products of 306 bp were digested with AciI and electrophoresed on 3% agarose gels to analyze undigested 306 bp band and digested parts of 159 and 147 bp bands. The G/T SNP at position À88 in the promoter region of MxA gene was analyzed by PCR-RFLP methods as described previously [20] . The G/T SNP at position À88 was associated with the result of IFN treatment in chronic hepatitis C [20] [21] [22] and with the result of HCV infection [22] . The T/C SNP at position À168 in the promoter region of PKR gene, associated with result of HCV infection [22] , was genotyped as follows. PCR was carried out with primers PKR-pF (5 0 -GTG GAA CCC TTG ATT CGA GAA CCT AGT-3 0 ) and PKR-pR (5 0 -GCG GCT TCG GGA GAG CTG GTT CTC AGT-3 0 ) using TaKaRa Ex Taq with GC buffer I (TaKaRa). The cycling condition is 45 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 55°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 1 min. PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and digested with SgrAI (New England Biolabs). Digested DNA was electrophoresed on a 5% agarose gel. The presence of T-allele was demonstrated by 169 and 155 bp fragments, and the presence of C-allele was indicated by 169, 136, and 19 bp fragments. Statistical analysis. Possible differences deriving from the distribution of age and gender between two groups were evaluated with the unpaired t test and v 2 test, respectively. Disease associations were assessed by the v 2 test. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant in all the tests, and data analysis was carried out using JMP version 5 (SAS Institute). Genotype distribution of tested polymorphisms in the control population was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We calculated LewontinÕs jD 0 j and r 2 to assess the extent of pairwise linkage disequilibrium between polymorphisms [24] . These indices were calculated with the use of haplotype frequencies estimated by the PHASE algorithm (PHASE, version 2.1.1) based on Bayesian methods.
