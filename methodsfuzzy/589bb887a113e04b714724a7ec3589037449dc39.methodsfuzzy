Animals, viruses, and clinical scores C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (NCI, Fredrick, MD). C57BL/6-RL 2/2 mice were bred and housed under pathogen-free conditions in the Biological Resources Unit of the Cleveland Clinic. All procedures were performed in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were infected at 6 weeks of age by intracranial injection with 250 PFU of the gliotropic MHV-JHM variant V2.2-1 [48] in 30 mL endotoxinfree Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS). The severity of clinical disease was graded as previously described [48] : 1 = ruffled fur, 2 = slow righting reflex, 3 = loss of righting reflex, 4 = moribund. Following intraperitoneal administration of ketamin/xylaxine (100 mg/kg/10 mg/kg), mice were perfused intracardially with 10 mL DPBS. Brains, spinal cords, spleens, cervical lymph nodes (CLN) and livers were collected and processed as described below.
