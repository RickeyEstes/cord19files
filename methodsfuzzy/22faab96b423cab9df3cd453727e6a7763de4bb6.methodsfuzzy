The study group was composed of children hospitalized due to pneumonia in the period between 01.2014 and 02.2015 at the Karol Jonscher Teaching Hospital in Poznan, in whom multiplex real-time PCR tests (FTD respiratory pathogens 33; fast-track diagnostics) were used in the diagnostic process. FTD respiratory pathogens 33 is an in vitro test with eight multiplex real-time PCR reactions for the qualitative detection of the following viruses, bacteria, and fungi causing respiratory infections: influenza A, B, and C; parainfluenza viruses 1 The analysis included the following factors: age, sex, comorbidities, immunosuppression, low body mass, airways obstruction, and respiratory failure requiring admission to ICU (Intensive Care Unit). Respiratory samples (throat or nasal swabs) were collected from all patients. The next step was extraction of pathogens' genetic material either DNA or RNA, followed by amplification of specific regions by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The presence of specific pathogen sequence in the reaction is reported as a cycle threshold value. Apart from the multiplex real-time PCR method, also traditional microbiological culture tests were performed in the studied children: blood cultures, nasopharynx smear cultures, and respiratory aspirate cultures. Positive microbiological cultures were defined a â‰¥105 CFU/mL. All the described tests were done as diagnostic tests during hospitalization. Informed consent was obtained from parents/legal guardians on admission to hospital.
