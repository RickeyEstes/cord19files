Nanocarriers are nanometer-sized materials that have the capacity to deliver therapeutic agents at the disease site (Arias, 2011; Schroeder et al., 2012) . They are designed to possess unique physicochemical properties, aiming to improve the pharmacokinetic and biodistribution of a drug molecule (Li and Huang, 2008) and to deliver a significant amount of drug molecules. Examples of some therapeutic nanocarriers are lipid-based particles (Al-Jamal and Kostarelos, 2011), micelles (Kedar et al., 2010) , nanoparticles (Shi et al., 2010) , dendrimers (Svenson, 2009) , and polymersomes (Levine et al., 2008) . Some of these have been proposed for the treatment of various diseases including cancer (Dhar et al., 2011) , coronary artery diseases (Chan et al., 2011) , and rheumatoid arthritis (Thomas et al., 2011) . In the particular case of cancer, the unique anatomy-that is, the leakiness of the tumoral vasculatures-concedes a passive transport of the nanocarriers by enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Maeda et al., 2003) . However, the porosity of the tumor blood vessels may vary with the tumor type (Bae, 2009) . Even with a successful delivery by the EPR effect, the nanocarriers must be able to internalize into the cancer cells (Gradishar et al., 2005) . A new paradigm in drug delivery embroils a combination of active and passive targeting. Targeting ligands, such as antibodies (Mamot et al., 2005) , peptides (Srinivasan et al., 2009) , small molecules (Kukowska-Latallo et al., 2005) , or aptamers (Farokhzad et al., 2006) can be attached onto the surface of a nanocarrier. The carriers recognize and bind to the cell-surface receptors and are subsequently taken by the cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis for releasing the therapeutic payloads (Shi et al., 2011) . The binding affinity of targeted nanocarriers can also be increased several orders of magnitude by the multivalent effect . Among all the targeting ligands, antibodies are well known for their high binding affinity, specificity, and availability for a number of disease biomarkers (Manjappa et al., 2011 ). An antibody can be simply absorbed on the surface of a nanocarrier via hydrophobic and/or electrostatic interaction (Sokolov et al., 2003) . However, using this approach, the absorbed antibody may orient randomly on the surface and result in losing the binding affinity. Furthermore, the antibody may exchange with other endogenous protein in vivo (Nobs et al., 2004) . Therefore, antibodies are generally preferred to attach to the nanocarriers covalently (Arruebo et al., 2009 ). An antibody consists of a number of functional groups that provides many options for bioconjugation (Manjappa et al., 2011) . Bioconjugation can take place by means of adsorption (at the isoelectrical point of the antibody via electrostatic interaction), by direct covalent linkage between the surface of the nanoparticle and the antibody, or by using adapter molecules. The use of adapter molecules generally involves streptavidin and biotin for the formation of the complex. Biotin-labeled polyclonal goat anti-Escherichia coli antibodies have been attached to streptavidin-coated magnetic nanoparticles, and used for the separation and selective quantification of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in ground beef in the presence of other bacteria (Varshney et al., 2005) .
