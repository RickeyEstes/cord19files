We obtained all the reviewed protein sequences of simian rotavirus strain SA11 from UniProt which is most studied reference strain of rotavirus [35] . It has been widely used for experimental characterization of rotaviral pathogenesis globally [36, 37] . Therefore this strain seems to be most appropriate for the intrinsic disorder MoRF analysis. Furthermore, we have also obtained the reviewed protein sequences of most common human pathogenic rotavirus serotypes from UniProt to examine the comparative penetrance of intrinsic disorder. The list below provides the Uni- Prot IDs for different proteins of these rotaviral serotypes: for G1  serotype, the UniProt IDs for NSP1-VP7 are (B3SRS0, B3SRS2,  B3SRS1, Q9YJN7, B3SRS5, B3SRS6, B1NKR3, B1NKR4, B1NKR5,  B3SRR9, B1NKR6, and P11853 respectively); for G2 serotype, the  UniProt IDs for NSP1-VP7 are (P35423, Q03240, A1YTU9, B3SRT2,  P23048, B3SRT4, A7J3A6, B1NKR8, Q6WNW5, P11196, A7J3A8,  and P11850 respectively); for G3 serotype, the UniProt IDs for  NSP1-VP7 are (B3SRV2, B3SRV4, B3SRV3, B3SRV6, B3SRV7,  B3SRV8, B1NKS9, B1NKT0, B1NKT1 , P11195, B1NKT2, and P11854 respectively); for G4 serotype, the UniProt IDs for NSP1-VP7 are (Q82045, B3SRX0, Q82053, Q82035, B3SRX3, B3SRX4, B1NKT7, B1NKT8, B1NKT9, P11200, B1NKU0, and P10501 respectively); and for G9 serotype, the UniProt IDs for NSP1-VP7 are (B3SRX6, B3SRX8, Q82049, B3SRY0, B3SRY1, B3SRY2, B1NKU1, B1NKU2, B1NKU3, B3SRX5, B1NKU4, and B3SRX9 respectively). For intrinsically disordered regions (IDPRs) and MoRF analysis, numerous technologically advanced predictors are available, such as IUPred [38] , ANCHOR [39] , MoRFPred [40] , MoRFchibi_web [41] , DisEMBL [42] , GlobPlot [43] , DisoPred [44] , PONDR Ò pool [including predictors, such as PONDR Ò VLXT [45] , PONDR Ò VLS2 [46] , and PONDR Ò VL3 [47] , as well as a meta-predictor PONDR Ò FIT [48] , and several others [49] . Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) was used to examine the accuracy of several disorder predictors, and several of the software mentioned above were compared using CASP [50] . All the available predictors are developed to identify the presence of intrinsically disordered residues and regions in query proteins, yet they all have diverse perspectives to examine the occurrence of intrinsic disorder. Therefore, it is sensible to use several computational tools to comprehend the abundance of intrinsic disorder in proteins [11] . All the predictors have limited accuracies of the prediction of intrinsic disorder in proteins, and the predictors whose accuracies are above 75% are considered as precise predictors. Characteristically, if the mean disordered score of any protein/region is above the threshold of 0.5, such proteins/regions are considered as IDPs/IDPRs. In addition, the iso-electric point of proteins has also been predicted by putting sequence in ExPasy (ProtParam tool) server [51] . Based on that standard, we selected four predictors from the PONDR family [PONDR Ò VLXT, [45] PONDR Ò VLS2, [46] PONDR Ò VL3, [47] , PONDR Ò FIT [48] ] and one more widely used server IUPred to analyze the prevalence of intrinsic disorder in rotavirus proteome. A meta-predictor PONDR Ò VL-XT integrates three predictors, the VL1 predictor trained to recognize long IDPRs, the amino-terminus-based predictor (XN), and the carboxylterminus-based predictor (XC) both trained to identify short disordered regions based on the X-ray crystallographic studies [45] . PONDR Ò VSL2 predictor uses a linear support vector machine (SVM) to predict both long and short IDPRs with 81% accuracy [46, 52] . PONDR Ò VL3 is trained for sequence-based predictions of long IDPRs (>30 amino acid residues) by calculating the means of 10 artificial neural networks and choose the final prediction [47] . A meta-predictor PONDR Ò FIT represents a combination of PONDR Ò VLXT, PONDR Ò VSL2, PONDR Ò VL3, FoldIndex, IUPred, and TopIDP that gives considerably enhanced precision in the collective as related to its different constituent predictors [48] . For each protein, we used the outputs of these five disorder predictors to calculate the corresponding PPID (predicted percent of intrinsic disorder) values, which correspond to the percent of residues of a query protein that were predicted to be disordered by a given predictor. We also calculated the mean PPID values for query proteins by averaging the outputs of all five predictors. Apart from IDP analysis, we have also performed the MoRF predictions for each protein of SA11 rotavirus strain. In general, MoRFs are the short (5-25 residues) protein binding sites within disordered region sometimes longer also (more than 50 residues) and may have the potential to undergo disorder to order transitions upon interaction with other partners [53] . In our study, four standard MoRF predictors were used as: ANCHOR [39] , MoRFPred [40] , MoRFchibi_web [41] and Disopred [54] . All these predictors utilize different types of algorithms to predict MoRFs, so we have used four predictors to completely characterized these regions in rotavirus proteome. ANCHOR based predictions utilize estimated energy calculations relative to biophysical properties whereas MoRFpred identifies on the basis of sequence alignment and support vector machine (SVM) [39, 40] . Disopred provide disorder region based upon sequence property training sets trained through neural networks [54] . MoRFchibi_web is the most advanced and accurate predictor available; it gives the combined output of MoRFchibi and MoRFDC by following the Bayes rules [55] . Therefore, we have used only MoRFchibi_web-based predictions to map the regions on available crystal structures of rotavirus proteome. We have also investigated the multiple sequence alignment of G1, G2, G3, G4 and G9 serotypes with the SA11 strain of rotavirus by Clustal Omega, web-based server [56] . All sequences were analyzed on the basis of three annotations which includes, conserved positions, strong polymorphisms and weak polymorphisms. The conserved regions have similar amino acid sequence throughout all strains. The strong polymorphisms are represented by space in the output file, which means substitutions among strongly dissimilar amino acid residues according to PAM 250 matrix. The weak polymorphisms are regions which have conserved residues among similar sequences based on their properties. These are denoted by colon and period symbols based on their scores having a threshold of 0.5 in PAM 250 substitution matrix. The predicted MoRF regions were also checked for functional annotations by using eukaryotic linear motif (ELM) server [57] which gives the information of short linear motifs (SLiMs) (3-10 residues) within IDPRs having conserved functional sites. These motif sequences provide an interface for functional interaction with other binding partners with low binding affinity. In this study we have predicted functional sites in rotavirus proteins from strain SA11 using ELM (Eukaryotic Linear Motif) server, which constitutes the manually annotated instances (matched sequences) curated from experimental literature [58] .
