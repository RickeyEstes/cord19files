A cross-sectional design was used to conduct this study. The target population for the study was all nurses and doctors who worked in emergency rooms, operation rooms, intensive care units (ICUs), surgical departments, and burn units in hospitals of Gaza Strip during the Israeli offensives against Gaza in August 2014. These departments were chosen because they received the victims of the offensives. A Senses population that included all nurses (n = 266) and doctors (207) in three hospitals that geographically represent Gaza governorates, were recruited to participate in this study.
