2.1. Preparation and generation of waterborne and airborne E. coli E. coli bacteria (CMCC1.3373) inoculated into nutrient broth medium (Beijing Sanyao Science Technology, Inc. China) were cultured in a constant temperature oscillation incubator (IS-RSDA, Crystal Technology & Industries, Inc. USA) at 37°C for 24 h at 170 r/min (revolutions per minute). The suspension was centrifuged at 9500 r/min for 10 min, and then used the 0.9% NaCl solution (weight percentage) to wash the suspension for three times to remove the medium and diluted to a certain concentration (about 1.0 × 10 8 CFU/L). The waterborne E. coli bacteria was added into the aerosol generator (Topas, ATM226, Germany) to form airborne E. coli with particle size of 1-5 μm (Support Information, Fig. S1 ) (Wang, Lu & Zhang, 2018) .
