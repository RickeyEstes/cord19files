The polio example is one of many that motivates new methods of vaccine design. The challenge of poliovirus is unusual in that it is a case in which we can no longer afford reversion to wildtype virulence. Yet vaccine reversion becomes an issue even for viruses eradicated on a local scale. This section describes several attenuation methods, with a strong emphasis on designs enabled by genome synthesis. The coverage here is not comprehensive (e.g., viral chimeras are omitted, as are many methods specific to genetic details of a particular virus) but instead emphasizes methods with potential generality across many different viruses, where there is some anticipation of prediction, and for which some data on reversion are available. The framework presented here is easily extended to methods not covered. To anticipate points made below, it should be apparent that the evolutionary reversal of an attenuated strain, leading to an increase in R 0 and possibly in virulence, does not require an actual genetic reversal of the attenuating mutations. The reversing mutations may leave intact the attenuating mutations and merely compensate for their effects, enabling a fitness increase. Thus the design of an attenuated strain to avoid strict genetic reversal of the changes does not ensure the absence of an evolutionary reversal of the attenuation. 5 The old way: haphazard, no control over attenuation or recovery The standard method for viral attenuation, the one used for at least half a century, is haphazard (Fenner and Cairns 1959; Lauring, Jones, and Andino 2010; Hanley 2011) . The foundation of this method, and indeed nearly all methods of attenuation, with the average R0 of the virus. (B and C) For the viruses that have attained a particular chain length, there will have been some evolution occurring during that chain, resulting in a distribution of R 0 values increasing with chain length. If the chain is long enough, there may have been enough evolution that some viruses now have R0 > 1, and if they get into the next patient, an outbreak may occur (depending on other factors). The net probability of evolving a virus that exceeds the epidemic threshold combines the probability of each chain length with the probability that viruses in that patient have R0 > 1 and escape to the next patient. The net probability of escape will be vanishingly small if chain lengths are short and the virus either never evolves R0 > 1 or is slow to do so.
