Virus and cells. The Purdue strain of TGEV was plaque purified and grown on the swine testicle (ST) cell line as previously described (Brian et al, 1980) . Puti&cation of genomic RNA. Virus was purified from clarified supernatant fluids as previously described (Brian et al, 1980) except that all sucrose solutions were made up in TMEN (10 mM Tris-maleate, pH 6.0, 100 mMNaC1, 1 mMEDTA). Viral RNA in 1 of 10 flasks was radiolabeled in order to follow the purification of the RNA. For these radiolabeled cultures, infected cells were refed with phosphate-free medium containing 1% fetal calf serum and 40 &i [32P]orthophosphate (ICN) per milliliter. Viral RNA was extracted by dissolving the virus pellet in 0.5 ml TNE (10 mM Trishydrochloride, pH 7.5,lOO mMNaC1, 1 mM EDTA) containing 1% SDS and 0.5 mg proteinase K per milliliter, incubating for 0.5 hr at 37", and extracting twice with an equal volume of a mixture of 50% phenol/ 48% chloroform/2% isoamyl alcohol. RNA was ethanol precipitated after adding 0.1 volume 2 M sodium acetate. Because small molecular weight RNA species are found in some preparations of purified coronavirion RNA, full-length genomic RNA to be used for cDNA cloning and making probe for colony screening was selected by rate-zonal sedimentation on preformed linear gradients of 15 to 30% sucrose (wt/ wt) made up in TNE-0.1% SDS. RNA was dissolved in water and sedimented 1.5 hr at 110,000 g, 25", on 5-ml gradients. Fractions of 0.2 ml were collected and the distribution of radioactivity was determined by Cerenkov counting. Only RNA sedimenting with a sedimentation coefficient of 50 S or greater, as determined by reference to sedimentation of mammalian 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA in a parallel gradient, was recovered by ethanol precipitation and used in the experiments described below. cDNA cloning of the 3' end of the TGEV genome. TGEV genomic RNA was cloned using a modified method of Gubler and Hoffman (1983) . First strand synthesis was carried out in a reaction volume of 50 ~1 containing 50 mM Tris-hydrochloride, pH 8.3,lO mMMgC12, 10 mMDTT, 2 mMdCTP, 2 mM dTTP, 2 mM dATP, 2 mM dCTP, 10 &i [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, ICN), 50 pmol oligo dT12-18, 6 pg TGEV RNA, 30 U RNAsin, 10 U reverse transcriptase (Seikagaku), for 1 hr at 42", and the reaction was stopped by adding 2 ~1 0.5 M EDTA. Nucleic acids were phenol-chloroformisoamyl alcohol extracted and ethanol precipitated after the addition of 0.5 vol of 7.5 M ammonium acetate. Second strand synthesis was carried out in a reaction volume of 100 ~1 containing 20 mM Tris-hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgC&, 10 mM (NHJ2S04, 100 mMKCl,O.l5 mM ,&NAD, 50 mg/ml BSA, 40 pM dNTPs, 8.5 U/ml Escherichia coli RNAse H, 230 U/ ml DNA polymerase I, 10 U/ml DNA ligase, and all of the product from the first strand reaction. The reaction was incubated at 12' for 1 hr, then at 22" for 1 hr. The reaction was stopped by adding 4 ~1 0.5 M EDTA and reaction products were phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extracted and fractionated on a Sephadex G50 spun column (Maniatis et d, 1982) , and the ds cDNA was ethanol precipitated. Double-stranded cDNA was homopolymer tailed essentially by the method of Roychoudhury and Wu (1980) . The follow-ing were added together, in order: 3 ~1 dCTP3' (>800 Ci/mmol), 20 ~1 10X cacodylate buffer (1.4 mM potassium cacodylate, 0.3 M Tris-hydrochloride, pH 7.6), 4 ~1 5 mM DTT, 3 ~110 mM dCTP, 2 ~1100 mM CoCIZ, 12 units terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (PL Biochemicals; at least 8 unitdpmol3' end) in 1.5 ~1, Hz0 to 200 ~1 final volume. The reaction was carried out at 12" for 1.5 min then stopped by adding 10 ~1 0.5 M EDTA. This reaction resulted in an average of 15 dCMP residues added per 3' end of &DNA, the optimal number for annealing and transformation (Peacock et al., 1981) . C-tailed cls cDNA was annealed to Gtailed, PstI-linearized pUC9 vector (PL Biochemicals) for 4 hr at 58" in a 50-~1 vol of buffer containing 10 mM Tris-hyclrochloride, pH 7.5, 150 mlM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA. The total concentration of DNA used was less than 0.5 pg/ml and the optimal insert:vector ratio was 1:l on a mass basis. E. coli strain JM103 was transformed using the method of Hanahan (Hanahan, 1983) . Cells containing inserts were observed as white colonies on YT agar plates that contained 100 pg ampicillin/ml, 1 mM IPTG, and 0.004% X-gal (Heidecker and Messing, 1983) . Recombinant colonies were transferred to nitrocellulose (Millipore, HAWP) and probed with random-primed cDNA copied from TGEV genomic RNA. Identification of large clones containing 3'-speciJic TGEV sequences. =P-labeled, random-primed cDNA used for colony hybridization was synthesized as described above for the oligo(dT)-primed reaction except that 0.2 pg of RNA was used and oligo(dT) was replaced by 20 pg of fragmented calf thymus DNA. Probe was alkali treated to hydrolyze the RNA and then was used for colony hybridization (Maniatis et al., 1982) . Colonies yielding a strong signal were analyzed for insert size by electrophoresis of plasmid DNA in agarose gels (Kado and Liu, 1981) . Inserts of 0.2 to 2.0 kb (the largest) were further analyzed by Southern hybridization with 32P-labeled poly(dT) to detect poly(dA) content and by cross-hybridization with nicktranslated inserts to detect overlapping sequences. 32P-labeled poly(dT) probe was prepared as described above for the oligo(clT)-primed reaction except that 50 pmol oligo(dT) . poly(rA) (PL Biochemicals) replaced the RNA. Alkali-treated =Ppoly(clT) probe was incubated for hybriclization at 37" for 12 hr then at 20" for 36 hr, and blots were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 20". Restriction endmuclease mapping. Plasmid was purified by lysozyme lysis and cesium chloride centrifugation (Maniatis et al., 1982) , and restriction endonuclease mapping was clone essentially as described by Smith and Bernstiel (1976) using plasmicls that were labeled at the SalI site within the multiple cloning linker region. DNA sequencing and sequence analysis. Restriction fragments end labeled with =P were isolated and sequenced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert (1980) . Sequences were analyzed with the aid of the program developed by Queen and Korn (1984) and sequence homologies were searched against Genbank, both marketed as part of the Beckman Microgenie program, March 1985 version (Beckman Instruments, Inc.).
