Sample concentration was performed as described by Katayama et al. (2002) [13] . Briefly, this method consists of filtration, concentration, and elution of viral particles in water samples through a negatively-charged membrane. The final sample was approximately 10 mL before using a Centriprep Reconcentrated YM50® (Millipore), resulting in a final volume of approximately 5 mL, after centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The concentrated samples were stored at −80°C until further analysis.
