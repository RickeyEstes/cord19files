Purification of nCRT nCRT was purified from mouse livers using a modification of a previously described methods [39, 40] . Briefly, fresh mouse liver cells (erythrocytes depleted) were collected and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was lysed in 3 volumes of lysis buffer (1% Triton-X 100, 0.2 mM PMSF in PBS) for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 35,000 g for 60 minutes. The supernatant was then precipitated using (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 and the final precipitate dissolved in binding buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, PH7.4) followed by dialysis against this buffer. The sample was applied to a DEAE Sephadex A50 column (1062 cm, GE Healthcare, US) which was then sequentially washed with binding buffer and washing buffer (280 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, PH7.4) at 1 ml/min to remove contaminating proteins. The fractions were eluted with a linear salt (280-500 mM NaCl) gradient.
