Two hundred and fifty-eight patients under 6 years of age were studied. All patients had gastroenteritis or febrile diarrhoea, as previously described,a which started during 1974. The study of a well-defined outbreak of rotavirus enteritis in a long-stay children's ward 14 demonstrated that, while the virus may persist in fseces for 2 to 3 weeks, it is often no longer detectable, by the method used in the Birmingham laboratory, 8 or 9 days after onset of disease. We did not include any patients whose faeces were first collected more than 7 days after onset of disease. Most of the patients had been admitted to the communicable-diseases unit at East Birmingham Hospital or to the isolation unit at Copthorne Hospital, Shrewsbury; the remainder were either inpatients at other hospitals in the Birmingham region or under the care of their general practitioner. Since the East Birmingham Hospital admits patients with communicable diseases from the whole of Birmingham and its surrounding districts (a population of about two and a half million), a reasonable cross-section of the child population of the region was thus obtained. Faeces from these patients were prepared for electron microscopy (E.M.) as previously described,15 except that high-speed centrifugation was at 30,000 r.p.m. for 30 minutes instead of 50,000 r.p.m. for 1 hour; this was adequate for sedimenting rotaviruses. Routine virus isolation was attempted in primary or secondary rhesusmonkey-kidney and HEP2 cells; human-embryo-kidney cultures were used when available. Isolation of viruses in suckling mice was not attempted. The specimens were examined for Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and enteropathic serotypes of Escherichia coli by the Public Health Laboratory, East Birmingham Hospital, the Shrewsbury laboratory, or by other hospital laboratories which sent the specimens to us for examination.
