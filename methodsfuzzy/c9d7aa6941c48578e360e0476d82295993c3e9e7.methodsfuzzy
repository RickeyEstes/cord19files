Materials pBAD24esfGFPx1 was a gift from Sankar Adhya and Francisco Malagon (Addgene plasmid no. 51558) [12] . The 3C protease expression vector pET/3C was a gift from Ari Geerlof (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). The pBLN200eGFPmut2eCar9 plasmid was a gift from Fran√ßois Baneyx [13] . All chemicals of the highest available purity were purchased from SigmaeAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), American Bioanalytical (Natick, MA, USA), Thermo Fisher Scientific (Rockford, IL, USA), Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, IN, USA), or EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA) unless otherwise stated. Restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA, USA). Fast-Link T4 DNA Ligase was purchased from Epicentre (Madison, WI, USA). All polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were carried out using either the PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA Polymerase (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) or the Phusion Flash High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
