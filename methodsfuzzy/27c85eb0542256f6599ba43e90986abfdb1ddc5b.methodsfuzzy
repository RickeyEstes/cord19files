We first applied 6 negative binomial regression models (18) to the monthly number of deaths and monthly proportions of positive influenza virus and RSV tests, to examine the relationships between mortality and the respiratory viruses (namely, models 1−6). Details of the models are shown in the Appendix. We then used the full model (model 6) to obtain the relative risks (RR) of death (and 95% confidence interval [CI]) from influenza A, A (H3N2), A (H1N1), and B viruses, as well as RSV, for each of the 3 mortality categories (i.e., all-cause, underlying P&I, and underlying C&R deaths). We also attempted to estimate the excess number of deaths from the viruses. Apart from accounting for possible overdispersion of the data in the models, the models also adjusted for potential confounding factors, including the number of days in each month, linear and squared term of time trend, seasonality (3−4 pairs of sine and cosine terms, allowing for 3 to 4 cycles per year to capture the main seasonal variations per year), temperature, and relative humidity. Linear and squared terms of time trend were included to capture secular trends, including population growth, changes in completeness of ICD coding, and changes in diagnostic methods. For each model, residuals were examined for discernible patterns and autocorrelation by means of residual plots and partial autocorrelation function plots. Since the unit of analysis was the calendar month, the lag effects of influenza and other covariates were not necessarily taken into account. We estimated the influenza-associated mortality fraction by dividing the number of excess deaths (the difference between observed and expected deaths) by the number of observed deaths, when the proportion of positive influenza results was set to 0 in model 6. The 95% CI for each estimated fraction was obtained by using the bootstrap resampling method with 1,000 bootstrap resamples (19) . The number of excess deaths attributable to influenza was then derived by multiplying the total number of deaths in each mortality category by the respective influenza-associated mortality fraction (6, 20) . We also derived the excess mortality rate per 100,000 person-years by dividing the number of excess deaths during the study period by the sum of the annual midyear population for the entire 8-year period. All analyses were performed by using S-Plus 6.0 Professional Release 2 software (Insightful Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA).
