In the membrane filtration (MF) method, a measured volume of sample is passed through a membrane filter of known pore size that retains bacteria on or near the filter surface. The colonies that develop after incubation on a selective medium are presumed to have originated from individual bacteria, thus representing a direct count of the number of bacteria in the original sample. The MF method is often the method of choice in the analysis of most water types (Russell, 2002; Smith et al., 2013; Tortora et al., 2010) . One of the most commonly used methods of secondary treatment are activated sludge systems. The term activated sludge refers to particles produced in wastewater by the growth of organisms in aeration tanks. Aerobic bacteria are the most common organisms in activated sludge. However, facultative bacteria along with higher organisms such as fungi and protozoa can be present. The exact composition of bacteria depends on the reactor design, environment, and wastewater characteristics. The sludge microorganisms oxidize the organic carbon in the wastewater to produce new cells, carbon dioxide, and water. As microorganisms grow, they form particles that clump together. These particles (floc) are allowed to settle to the bottom of the tank, leaving a relatively clear liquid free of organic material and suspended solids. The effluent can be discharged into a river or treated in a tertiary treatment facility if necessary for further use. There is a large variety of design; however, in principle all activated sludges consist of three main components: an aeration tank, which serves as a bioreactor; a settling tank or clarifier for separation of activated sludge solids and treated wastewater; and a return activated sludge equipment to transfer settled activated sludge from the clarifier to the influent of the aeration tank. The mixture of activated sludge and wastewater in the aeration tank is called mixed liquor. The average amount of time that microorganisms are kept in the system is called solids retention time (SRT). The time that a fluid particle remains in the reactor is called hydraulic retention time (HRT). Activated sludge processes show many advantages such as: resistant to organic and hydraulic shock loads, high reduction of BOD and pathogens, and high effluent quality. On the other hand, these processes have some disadvantages such as: high energy consumption, high capital and operating costs, prone to complicated chemical and microbiological problems, and sludge and possibly effluent require further treatment and/or appropriate discharge. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology has emerged as a wastewater treatment technology of choice over the activated sludge process. It overcomes the drawbacks of the conventional activated sludge process. MBRs have two fundamental process arrangements: (1) integrated systems that have membranes immersed in an activated sludge reactor and (2) separate systems that have a membrane module placed outside the reactor. Immersed membranes are the most popular arrangement. The membranes (which could be flat sheet or tubular) have porosities ranging from 0.035 to 0.4 Î¼m (which is considered between micro-and ultrafiltration). When immersed in wastewater, the membrane forms a barrier for impurities, while allowing pure water molecules to pass. Process arrangements for implementation of MBR for nitrification, nitrogen removal, and complete biological nutrient removal could be also found. The MBR technology provides the following advantages over activated sludge process: it eliminates the requirement of large space for settling tank (or clarifier) which is replaced by the membrane, thereby reducing plant footprint which is usually 30%-50% smaller than an equivalent conventional activated sludge facility; it produces high-quality effluent with higher volumetric loading rates; it needs shorter hydraulic retention time (HRT), and longer solid retention times (SRT); it leads to less sludge production. A membrane bioreactor is able to process significantly higher sludge concentrations (10-20 g/L) and lower reactor volumes, compared to conventional activated sludge systems. However, the use of MBR technology has disadvantages, including higher energy costs, the need to control membrane fouling problems, and potential high costs of periodic membrane replacement. Membrane fouling is believed to be a major drawback of MBR, as it significantly reduces membrane performances and membrane lifespan, leading to an increase in maintenance and operating costs and low treatment efficiency. Membrane fouling in MBRs is attributable to suspended particulates in activated sludge that includes biomass of microorganisms and cell debris, colloids, solutes, and sludge flocs. These materials deposit onto the membrane surface and into the membrane pores, clogging the pores, and leading to a decline in the permeability of the membrane. When the clogging of membrane is due to accumulation of biomass of microorganisms, it is referred to as membrane biofouling. Membrane biofouling is caused by several physicochemical and biological processes, which are highly dependent on the composition of feedwater, membrane characteristics, operation conditions, and microorganisms present. Biofilms formation is thought to be essential in membrane biofouling. Therefore, controlling biofilm formation in membranes can prevent MBR failures. In order to overcome the fouling problem, several operational strategies have been employed; however, membrane fouling remains an issue of investigation in MBR operation. Understanding the biofouling phenomenon in MBR is crucial to be able to control this problem. Hence, it is essential to characterize the microbial community involved in the development of mature biofilms in MBR. Biofilm formation begins with the colonization of bacteria and subsequent surface attachment. The initial colonization starts with the detection of quorum sensing (QS) signal molecules (such as AHLs) from the surrounding environment. The QS regulates the bacterial group behaviors in a cell density-dependent way and is closely associated with biofouling of the membrane in MBR treating wastewater. Thus, characterization of activated sludge AHLs will provide an additional insight into the bacteria involved in MBR. Also it helps in developing more effective strategies to deal with the biofouling problem in MBRs, for example, by blocking of intercellular communication to prevent biofilm formation (Lade et al., 2014; Yeon et al., 2009) .
