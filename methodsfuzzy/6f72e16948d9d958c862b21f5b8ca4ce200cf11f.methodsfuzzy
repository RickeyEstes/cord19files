To obtain the pedestrian level wind environment in the campus, the wind tunnel test approach was utilised in this study. The CLP Power Wind/Wave Tunnel Facility (WWTF) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) were used to conduct the wind tunnel tests. The scaled ratio for the campus model with its surroundings was 1:200, and the campus model was reproduced in great detail (see Fig. 6(a) ). 16 wind directions were measured during the wind tunnel tests at an interval of 22.5°from 0°(North) to 360°. A reference sensor was located at 1 m high (200 m in full-scale) above the edge of the turn table on the windward side. The approaching wind profiles were acquired by grouping and fitting from previous topographic study, which could represent local wind conditions in real life. The measured and target values of the wind profiles and their corresponding approaching wind directions are presented in Fig. 6(b) , where the mean wind velocity at the reference height (200 m in prototype) was around 8 m/s. The measured errors were within 5%, which confirmed the confidence in the measurement data. The similarity requirements were strictly examined during the wind tunnel tests, and the blockage ratio was 4.5% with Reynolds Numbers (Re) over × 7 10 4 . These met the requirements of the quality wind tunnel test standards ASCE (1999) and AWES (2001) manuals). The Kanomax velocity sensors were utilised for the measurements of pedestrian level wind environment, and they were Y. Du, C.M.
