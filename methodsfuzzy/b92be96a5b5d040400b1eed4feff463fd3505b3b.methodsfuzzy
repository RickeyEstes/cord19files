This was a population based, observational study requiring a database link of all patients of the SCU to available information housed at Mona GeoInformatics Institute (MGI). The study was granted ethical approval by The University of the West Indies Ethics Committee. All persons who had been registered at the SCU up to December 2011 were geocoded based on their residential addresses. The Unit is located in an urban setting and provides free healthcare to patients with SCD across island. It operates a daily clinic at its main site located in the eastern region and two monthly outreach clinics in the southern and western regions of the island. There are about 6,000 active patients registered in its database and the Unit has close to 10,000 annual visits. Healthcare is provided by primary care physicians, paediatricians, nurses, and a social worker. Medical technologists are available to provide urgent hematology assessments daily. Chronic blood transfusion programs are not employed by the Unit. Hydroxyurea use is increasing but uptake is still quite low. Patients presenting with acute complications are admitted to the daycare ward located within the SCU, and patients requiring hospitalization for inpatient care are transported to the nearest government operated hospitals. Once geocoded, spatial data layers attached to community and/or enumeration district data were created for further processing and analysis with physical, environmental and social data, all housed at MGI. MGI has access to 30-year meteorological records such as rainfall, mean temperature and surface elevation from the Meteorological Office of Jamaica, from their more than 300 monitoring stations island-wide, and to geochemical data (from the International Centre for Environmental and Nuclear Sciences' Geochemical Atlas of Jamaica, 1995 [25] ) across more than 250 monitoring sites across the island with details on available soil elements including zinc, lead, cadmium, and arsenic. Distances of patients from factories and SCU clinics were calculated, poverty levels (based on Planning Institute of Jamaica's database), and rural/urban designations by communities were also used for the analyses. The poverty indicators utilized were those that best predicted per capita consumption levels in households based on data from the Planning Institute of Jamaica. Poverty level was defined as being the percentage of persons in that community living below the poverty line. Clinical data extracted from the SCU database on these individuals included their date of birth, gender, genotype, age at first visit to clinic, number of years attending the SCU, total number and annual rate of all visits to clinic, total number and annual rate of health maintenance visits, as well as history of and annual rates of visits for specific conditions, such as pain events, leg ulcers and respiratory problems including acute chest syndrome and asthma. Genotype was further categorized as mild (including heterozygous SC and Sβ+ thalassemia genotypes) and severe (including the homozygous SS and the heterozygous Sβ0 thalassemia genotypes) genotypes.
