There were 84 (81.6%) cases detected positive for EV71/CA16-IgM by ELISA in all serum samples. The results in different HFMD cases were discordant from the RT-PCR method. Of the 70 severe cases, 62 (88.6%) were positive for EV71/CA6-IgM, and 22 (66.7%) of 33 mild cases were positive for EV71/CA6-IgM; the positive rate of EV71/ CA16-IgM in severe cases was much higher than in mild cases (Ï‡ 2 = 7.153, P = 0.007).
