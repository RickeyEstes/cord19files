In current study, the protein interactions with small molecule, ATA, were made up of theoretically-determined (six structures) and experimentally-determined (13 structures) structures as stated the following. The threedimensional theoretical models for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, ID = 1O5S) (Xu et al., 2003) , spike protein subunit 1 (S 1 , ID = 1Q4Z) (Spiga et al., 2003; Zhang and Yap, 2004) , spike protein subunit 2 (S 2 , ID = 1Q4Y) (Spiga et al., 2003; Zhang and Yap, 2004) of SARS-CoV, the 3-dimensional crystal structures for nucleocapsid protein (N protein, ID = 1SSK) , non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9, ID = 1QZ8) (Egloff et al., 2004) , 3Clike main protease (3Clpro, ID = 1Q2W) of SARS-CoV, the crystal structure for YopH from Yersinia pestis (ID = 1QZ0) , m-calpain from Rattus norvigecus (ID = 1DF0) (Strobl et al., 2000) , RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Dsrna bacteriophage 6 (ID = 1HHS), Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (ID = 1KHW), Poliovirus (ID = 1RDR), Bovine viral diarrhea virus (IVDV, ID = 1S4F), Norwalk virus (ID = 1SH0), Hepatitis C virus (ID = 1C2PA) and HIV reverse transcriptase (ID = 3HVT) were retrieved from Protein Data Bank. The three-dimensional geometry of all the molecules were validated for restraint violations using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1996) . The three-dimensional coordinate for the small molecule Aurintricarboxylic Acid (ATA-C 22 H 14 O 9 ) was derived using PRODRG2 (Schuttelkopf and Aalten, 2004) and JME editor (http://www.cem.msu.edu/ âˆ¼reusch/VirtualText/Questions/MOLEDITOR/jme window. html). VAST and DALI programs were used to locate similar structural patterns between crystal structure of all molecules. Sequential structural alignment was done by CE (Shindyalov and Bourne, 1998) and COMPARER (Sali and Blundell, 1990) . Finally, three-dimensional structural comparative analysis was performed by LGA (Zemla, 2003) . Preparation of Macromolecule and ligand prior molecular docking was done using WhatIF software (Vriend, 1990) . Molecular docking to determine the best conformation in term of lowest Gibbs free energy and shape complementary was performed using Autodock 3.0 (Morris et al., 1998) . The visualisation of the 3-dimensional structural data was generated by Rasmol (Bernstein, 2000) .
