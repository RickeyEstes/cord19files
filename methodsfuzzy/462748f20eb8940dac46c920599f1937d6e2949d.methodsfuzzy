Unless otherwise stated, the methods used were the same for the splenocyte and serum transfer experiments. Virus neutralising titre (VNT) in donor mice: titres in MVA VP2vaccinated and MVA-wt vaccinated mice (splenocyte transfer) and in mice vaccinated twice or three times with MVA-VP2 (serum transfer) were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Elispot data for donor mice: the numbers of cells excreting IFNc were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test, with mice grouped according to vaccination status (MVA-VP2 or MVA-wt) and stimulus (AHSV or VP2) (i.e. there are four groups in total). Differences between groups were then explored using post hoc Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Clinical scores in recipient mice: clinical scores in different groups of mice were compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (splenocyte transfer) or a Kruskal-Wallis test (serum transfer). In the latter case, differences between groups were then explored using post hoc Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Viraemia in recipient mice: differences in viraemia amongst groups of mice were assessed using linear mixed models with log 10 pfu as the response variable, days post infection (as a factor) and group as fixed effects and mouse as a random effect. Model selection proceeded by stepwise deletion of non-significant terms (as judged by the Akaike information criterion) starting from a model including days post infection and group as main effects. Survival in recipient mice: survival in different groups of mice were compared using log-rank tests. VNT in recipient mice: titres at experiment end point (either death or 14 days post infection) were analysed using a one-way analysis of variance, followed by post hoc Tukey tests to identify differences between groups. A significance level of P = 0.05 was used in all analyses. All methods were implemented in R version 3.1.0 (R Core Team 2014).
