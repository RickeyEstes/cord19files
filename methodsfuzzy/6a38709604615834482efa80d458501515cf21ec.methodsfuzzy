The protein content was determined by direct spectophotometric measurement at 280 nm and by the Coomassie blue dye binding method (Bradford, 1976) . Densitometric analysis was performed using the Imagemaster 1D software (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were processed with a scanner and subjected to computerized image analysis. On each membrane image, profile plots were obtained displaying the fAGP peak, and the volume of each peak was calculated by the software. Fig. 1 reports the chromatographic procedure set up to purify fAGP. The fraction containing fAGP (Fig. 1a , fraction 2) from Q-Sepharose chromatography was loaded onto a SP-Sepharose chromatography column.
