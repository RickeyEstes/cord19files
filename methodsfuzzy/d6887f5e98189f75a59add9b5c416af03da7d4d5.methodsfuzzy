In the context of extreme events, SARS has more in common with a drought than a major earthquake. In the case of SARS, globally, not many people died compared with many other disasters, the recognition of the challenge posed by SARS was fairly slow, the disaster event lasted a relatively long time (allowing for management strategies to be implemented during the event), but millions of people were affected. Nevertheless, the accumulation of many small dislocations and the costs of response measures were massive. SARS was a new disease but, aided by advanced communication systems, it was not the first to have a global reach, and, from that perspective, it was not without precedent. At the time that this chapter was being prepared, the media was engrossed with bird flu. Not long before that it was mad cow disease and shortly before that it was foot and mouth disease. Although SARS originated in China, at the time that SARS was first reported in the Western press, the author was in Beijing and first learned about it in an e-mail from Canada. Like many others, he subsequently had his Asian travel curtailed and his Asian projects disrupted-it was difficult to undertake tourism research or training in China in the summer of 2003! Thus, the author has personal experiences of the consequences (but not the disease) that he can draw upon. However, the main sources of information for this chapter come from elsewhere. This contribution is based primarily upon a systematic analysis of the contents of two Canadian newspapers from April 2003 to the present (September 2004). The two newspapers are the Globe and Mail (GM) that is published daily in Toronto but has broad national and international coverage; many regard it as Canada's national newspaper. The second paper, The Record, is published daily in Kitchener, Ontario, which is located approximately 100 km west of Toronto. It contains international stories but primarily serves a regional market. For many years the author had been clipping and saving all of the articles on tourism in the two papers. Thus, data acquisition was in progress prior to the onset of the event. It was therefore only necessary to sort the clippings to take out those pertaining to SARS. The clippings were then arranged chronologically and by newspaper. The articles were then reread to identify the stakeholders involved, critical events, actions proposed, and actions taken. The empirical part of the chapter reports the results of these activities.
