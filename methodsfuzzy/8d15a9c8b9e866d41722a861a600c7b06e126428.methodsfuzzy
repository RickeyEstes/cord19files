The increasing availability of mouse-specific reagents has resulted in many new assay techniques that provide a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. Growth in the number of reagents capable of quantitating analytes in mouse serum is illustrated in Table 6 -2. Techniques employing nonisotopic labels for detection such as enzyme cascade, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and electrochemiluminescence, are rapidly replacing older radioimmunoassay (RIA) techniques. Enzyme immunoassays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), enzyme-multiplier immunoassay technique (EMIT), and cloned enzyme donor immunoassay (CEDIA), provide quantitative results based on photometric methods. Enzyme immunoassay is popular because it generates compounds that can be quantitated photometrically. Typical enzymatic labels include ~-galactosidase, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, and glucose-6-dehydrogenase. In addition these ELISA test kits are compact, easy to use, and quantitated with inexpensive instruments. These kits (usually in a well format) are available for quantitation of a wide range of mouse serum and plasma biomarkers (Table 6-3) . Fluoroimmunoassay (FIA), which utilizes a fluorescent molecule as an indicator label, was previously subject to problems associated with background fluorescence. Today this problem has been largely resolved by using chelates of lanthanide as a label. Modifications of FIA have eliminated the need to separate free from bound label (homogenous assay). Chemiluminescent and electrochemilumiscent immunoassays are similar to enzyme immunoassays, except that quantitation of results is based on the emission of light after a chemical label is exposed to an oxidation reaction (chemiluminescence) or to an electrochemical reaction (electrochemiluminescence). The number of biomarkers that can be quantified by commercially available test kits based on immunoassays is likely to grow at unparalleled rates as a result of proteomics research where mice are the favored model.
