Experimental animals. Chicks used in these studies were Hy-VAC B 12 /B 12 (Hy-VAC, Adel, IA) as well as B 8 /B 8 B 19 /B 19 from the Department of Biological Sciences, Northern Illinois University (DeKalb, IL) (Briles and Briles, 1982) . Chicks were hatched in our laboratory and housed in a specific, pathogen-free environment at the Laboratory Animal and Resources Facility (Texas A & M University, College Station, TX). Viral inoculations. The nephrotrophic Gray strain of IBV, used as the source for viral inoculation, was propagated by inoculating the allantoic sac of 11-day-old chicken embryos and harvesting the allantoic fluid 36 h p.i. (Sneed et al., 1989) . Preparation of donor lymphocytes. Chicks at the age of 28 days were infected with 10 7 EID 50 of the Gray strain of IBV. Splenocytes were collected from IBV-infected chicks at 10 days p.i. Control donor cells were prepared from age-matched uninfected chicks. Lymphocytes were separated with a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient (Histopaque 1.077; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), adherent cells were removed by incubation on plastic petri dishes, and B lymphocytes were depleted using nylon wool columns . T-cell-enriched preparations were transferred directly to naive chicks or were first stimulated in vitro for 10 days with antigen-presenting cells (APC) in RPMI with 10% chicken serum, 50 g/ml gentamycin, 5 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 M 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mM L-glutamine from Gibco BRL (Grand Island, NY). IBVinfected CK cells , irradiated with 10,000 rad, were used as APC. Inoculation of donor lymphocytes and challenge virus. Each group consisted of at least five chicks. Immune or nonimmune donor lymphocytes were given at 5 days of age through a wing vein. One day after receiving donor lymphocytes, chicks were challenged with 2 to 4 ϫ 10 6 EID 50 of the Gray strain of IBV by the nasal-ocular route. Birds were observed twice each day for clinical signs of illness, such as coughing, sneezing, rales, or dyspnea. Statistical differences in illness were determined by analysis of variance (Ott, 1984) . Viral load was evaluated in lungs and kidneys collected 5 days p.i. . Depletion of T lymphocyte subtypes. Stimulated T cell subtypes were enriched, after B cells and adherent cells were removed, with antisera specific for CD4, CD8, TCR1, or TCR2 . Briefly, tissue culture flasks were coated with goat anti-mouse IgG. The immune T cells were labeled with mouse anti-chicken CD4, CD8, TCR1, or TCR2 monoclonal antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) before being added to IgG-coated plates and being incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The suspensions were swirled gently before being incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature. Nonadherent cells were decanted from the plates following gentle agitation, centrifuged for 10 min at 600 g, and resuspended in PBS before being transferred to chicks. CTL assay. In vitro stimulated T lymphocytes depleted of T cell subtypes were tested for CTL activity using target CK cells infected with the Gray strain of IBV as described previously . Target cells were labeled with 51 Cr for 90 min before being washed and mixed with effector lymphocytes . Varying amounts of effector cells in 100 l of RPMI with 10% chicken sera were added to each well in 96-well round-bottom microtiter plates, and 100 l of 2 ϫ 10 4 of 51 Cr-labeled target cells that were infected with IBV or uninfected was added to each well. Microtiter plates were centrifuged at 100 g for 5 min before being incubated for 4 h at 40°C. After being centrifuged at 600 g for 10 min, 100 l of the supernatants in triplicate samples was collected for determining 51 Cr release using a gamma radiation counter (Cobra Autogamma, Canberra Packard). The percentage of specific lysis was calculated as (E-S/M-S) ϫ 100, where E is the mean of three test wells, S is the mean of spontaneous release from the three target cells without effector cells, and M is the mean maximal release from the three target cells with 3% Triton X-100. The spontaneous 51 Cr release of target cells was less than 15% of the maximum release. Determination of viral load in chicken lungs or kidneys. Lungs and kidneys were collected and pooled from syngeneic chicks in each group . Tissues from the chicks in each group were pooled before being weighed and homogenized. A 10% w/v tissue suspension was prepared in Eagle's MEM containing 200 U/ml of penicillin and 200 g/ml streptomycin. After standing for 90 min at 4°C, cells were pelleted by centrifuging for 20 min at 2000 g and serial 10-fold dilutions of supernatants were prepared in Eagle's MEM. One-tenth of a milliliter of each virus dilution was injected into the allantoic sac of six 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (Cook, 1983) . The eggs were sealed with collodion before being incubated at 38°C for 5 days and then the embryos were examined for dwarfing by weighing. EID 50 was calculated by the Reed and Muench method (Burleson et al., 1992) .
