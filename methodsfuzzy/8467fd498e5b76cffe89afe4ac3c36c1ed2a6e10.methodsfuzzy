The conventional Engle and Granger (1987) bivariate cointegration procedure without a structural break is a test for a unit root based on the residuals from the regression below: (1) In this regression y 2t $I(1) and e t $I(0). Assuming that the residuals follow a AR(1) process such that ê t ¼ rê tÀ1 +v t , the null hypothesis entails testing whether the error term is stationary or r ¼ 1. We can restate the hull hypothesis as Ho: 1Àr ¼ 0 in the equation: where v t is white noise. White noise might represent too strong a restriction, therefore, when it is violated, Eq. (2) is augmented by additional lags: Residual-based cointegration tests such as that proposed by Engle and Granger (1987) assume that cointegrating vectors are constant over time. However, if there is a regime shift in the series, there will be a shift in the cointegrating vector as well. In such circumstances, these traditional tests will lead to incorrect inferences about the long-run relationship of the series. Moreover, according to Phillips (1986) , if a structural break exists in the data, but is omitted from the cointegration relation, this can lead to spurious rejections when the null of no cointegration is wrongly rejected. For the Engle and Granger (1987) test, such spurious rejections tend to occur for breaks that are located either too early in the sample or when the magnitude of the break increases. Thus, the power of the Engle and Granger (1987) test to find cointegration is severely affected by the presence of breaks in the level or the trend function in the cointegration relationship. Gregory and Hansen (1996) addressed this issue and proposed a residual-based cointegration test that takes into account regime shifts either in the intercept or the entire vector of coefficients. Gregory and Hansen analysed four models and then tested the null hypothesis of no cointegration. Model 1 (Eq. (1)) is the standard cointegration model where no changes in the intercept or a trend function are allowed under the null hypothesis. The other three models include shifts in either the intercept (Model C) or trend (Model C/T) or shifts in the intercept and slope (Model C/S). Model C/S is unique in the sense it allows the longrun equilibrium relationship to rotate as well as shift in parallel fashion. The break point t in any model is determined endogenously within the data series. Model C can be expressed as Model C/T can be represented by Model C/S is In these three models above, the structural break is modelled by the introduction of a dummy variable f tt , which takes values (0,1) depending on the nature of the structural break. In all four models postulated, the null hypothesis of no cointegration can be tested by examining whether the residuals of the ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression applied to Eqs. (1) and (4)-(6), respectively are stationary processes or that e t $I(0). The procedure for calculating the test statistic for each possible regime shift tAT involves four steps. In essence it involves the search for the smallest value of either the modified PP (Z n a and Z n t ) or ADF (ADF*) test statistic across all possible break points: ADFðtÞ
