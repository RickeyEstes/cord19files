Statistical inference of 0 is still in progress, and it is recognized that the estimate is very sensitive to dispersal of the disease progression [11] . Estimation of 0 can be illustrated by employing time-since-infection model and suggests origin of transmission of infectious diseases which is the counterpart of compartmental models like SI, SIS, and so forth. Both models are originated in the basic paper of Kermack and McKendrick [12] , and both the SIR model and the simplest time-since-infection model are known as "the Kermack-McKendrick age structure model. " It is used to identify key epidemiological parameter by using a simple renewal process which adheres to the basic reproduction number 0 . Let ( ) represent the number of new infections or incidence at calendar time ; that is, each infected individual on an average generates secondary cases at a rate ( ) at timesince-infection which is a specific case of renewal equation of birth process [13] [14] [15] . Consider (1) Since 0 represents average number of secondary cases that a primary case generates during entire his/her infectious period, the estimate is given by [16, 17]  Under Kermack and McKendrick assumption "single infection causes an independent process of infection with host" which allows an age representation for the state of infection, that is, infectivity of an individual. The time elapsed since infection is called the infection age or time since infection, whereas ( ) is expected infectivity of an individual with time-since-infection whereas ( ) becomes the rate of secondary transmission per single primary case at time-sinceinfection [18] : where ( ) is the transmission rate which depends on frequency of contact and infectiousness at infection age and Γ( ) is the probability of being infectious at infection age . Further, we consider a probability density of the generation time where generation time is defined as time from infection of an individual to the infection of a secondary case by that individual, denoted by ( ) through normalized density of secondary transmission [16, 17, 19] . We have Using (5) in (4) we get Then, the basic reproduction number 0 is as in In reality, the case incidences are rather in discrete form as daily/weekly reports. The discretized analogy of (7) can be derived as Computational By taking the inverse of both sides of (8) we get where is the discretized form of time since infection (usually in days), is discretized calendar time (usually in days/weeks), and is the generation time distribution for an infectious disease which is the probability distribution function for the time from infection of an individual to the infection of a secondary case by that individual [19, 20] . From Figure 2 the concept of 0 through contact patterns has been illustrated here before taking up the Bayesian method of estimation. From Figure 2 (a), the transmission tree with 0 = 2 represents who infected whom, where each primary case on an average generates "2" secondary cases. Secondary transmissions from primary to secondary cases are given by the basic reproduction number 0 = 2. From Figure 2 (b) restructuring the transmission tree, given that all the potential contacts made by primary cases with the probability of each possible contact resulted in a secondary transmission, is 1/ 0 . This type of transmission tree represents who infected whom which is unobservable in nature unless rigorous contact tracing is implemented [21, 22] . The numerator of the right hand side of (9) represents the total number of effective contacts made by a possible primary case in day/weeks which have an equal probability of resulting in the secondary transmission; that is, the probability that a secondary case is linked to an effective contact made by a single primary case at time is given by 1/ 0 . Effective contacts lead to potential secondary cases with equal chance of getting the infection from the primary cases at time . It has been seen that every contact does not lead to successful transmission of infection; that is, the effective contacts are uncertain which is defined as the contact that is sufficient to lead to the transmission of infection between infectious and susceptible population. The total number of effective contacts made by a potential primary case at time is the sum of the product of incidence cases and generation time distribution during the generation interval of length . This indicates a simple binomial law of uncertainty in effective contacts [22] . Total number of effective contacts become = ∑ =0 − , during the th day, that is, ∼ Bin( , 1/ 0 ), ∀ = 1, 2, . . . , , where 1/ 0 is the probability of effective contacts. Let denote incidence or new cases at calendar time and denotes generation time distribution at time-sinceinfection . Then the probability mass function of effective contacts becomes  The likelihood function of 1/ 0 is as follows: Here, Bayesian inferential approach is used to estimate parameter 0 which provides us with different but related estimate by combining prior belief and the evidence observed. As more evidence is gathered the prior distribution is modified into the posterior distribution that represents the uncertainty over the parameter values. Posterior distribution is derived from the Bayes formula [23] where ∫ ⋅ Θ ( / ) ( ) is a normalization constant, indicated data, is the unknown quantity, ( ) is the prior distribution, ( / ) is the likelihood function, and posterior distribution ( / ) completely describes the uncertainty. There are two key advantages of Bayesian theory: (i) once the uncertainty in the posterior distribution is expressed via probability distribution then the statistical inference can be automated and (ii) available prior information is reasonably incorporated into the statistical model. Now, the posterior estimate of parameter 0 is derived using its prior information, where likelihood function follows binomial distribution with conjugate prior as beta distribution of first kind [24] . That is, 1/ 0 ∼ Beta( , ), with realistic choice of parameters ( , ): Now posterior distribution of 1/ 0 is proportional to the likelihood times prior. Therefore, We are interested in estimating 0 with its 95% credible interval (CrI) which has been derived by considering the sampling transformation of 1/ 0 through simulation from the above posterior distribution with different choices of priors for beta distribution. Theoretically, it is hard to find the posterior distribution of 0 where 1/ 0 is a beta variable. Through simulation we have generated 10000 samples from beta posterior distribution and also estimated 95% CrI. We have considered beta distribution with several combinations of mean (ranges from 0.4 to 0.8) and accordingly we chose different values of ( , ). The second and fourth column of Table 1 represent our estimates of 0 which are posterior means along with 95% CrI. Figure 3 displays the posterior distribution of 0 with different prior choices. Generation time is another most important characteristic in infectious disease epidemiology, since 0 indicates only the average number of secondary infections one primary infection produces in one disease generation. When we consider disease transmission in real time scale such as days or weeks, it matters a lot how long one disease generation lasts. Generation time is the average time taken for secondary infections produced by a primary infection [25] . Generation interval or generation time distribution is assumed to be known as Weibull distribution which is a biologically plausible choice [20, [26] [27] [28] with a mean of 1.78 and 2.48 days and a standard deviation (SD) of 0.66 and 1.06 days for = 7 and 10 days [29, 30] (Tables S1 and S2 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine All the sensitivity analysis was done by using MATLAB (Supplementary Material, Algorithm).
