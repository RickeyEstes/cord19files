Sera. Six non-ligulosed roach from Highfield Pool, Nottinghamshire, U.K. (mean fork length 14.6 -+ 0.1 cm) were maintained at 12°C +_ l°C in dechlorinated, aerated tapwater. After anaesthetising in MS222 each fish received a 0.2 ml intraperitoneal (IP) injection of Ligula tegumental homogenates (protein concentration 0.3 mg/ml) in Freunds Complete Adjuvant (FCA) (1:1) on day 0 and again on day 14. Tegumental homogenates were obtained by freezethawing of whole worms, washing in 0.85% saline and removing the supernatant. Fish were bled, under anaesthetic, by caudal puncture one week after the second injection, i.e., day 21 post-primary injection, and blood allowed to clot for 1.5 h at 4°C, after which the serum (immune roach serum; IRS) was removed, pooled and frozen at --20°C until required. Pooled normal roach serum (NRS) was obtained from 6 non-ligulosed fish, mean fork length 13.2 _+ 0.1 cm. Immune carp serum (ICS) was obtained from carp, Cyprinus carpio, fork length 10-15 cm, infected with the tapeworm Bothriocephalus achielognathi. Anti-carp IgM polyclonal antibody (ct-clgM), raised in Dutch white rabbits, was kindly supplied by Drs M. Cross and R.M. Matthews of Plymouth University, U.K. Peroxidaselabelled goat anti-rabbit IgG (peroxidase c(-rIgG) was obtained from Sigma Chem. Co. Immunoblotting. In each assay antibodies were diluted in blocking solution (PBS, 1% dried milk powder, 0.01% Tween 20). Five rows, each comprising 4 spots of 5 ~tl reagent, were immobilized on to 4 sheets of nitrocellulose blotting paper (Sartorius). The first row, comprising IRS, was spotted in dilutions of l:l, 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8. Similar dilutions of sera were used in the controls, i.e. a negative control of normal roach serum in row 2 and a positive control of ICS in row 3. Row 4 contained spots of blocking solution whilst the fifth row, which served as a positive colour control, comprised ct-clgM polyclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:200. After incubating at room temperature (approximately 20°C) the nitrocellulose papers were immersed for 30 min in blocking solution and washed 3 x 5 rain in PBS, 0.01% Tween 20. Primary antibody ((x-cIgM) was added at dilutions of either 1:50, 1:100, 1:200 or 1:400, each dilution being placed on to one of 4 sheets. The primary antibody was then left to incubate overnight at room temperature. After removal of the primary antibody and washing, the nitrocellulose papers were incubated in a 1:1000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated a-rIgG for 15-30 mins. After washing, the sheets were developed for 10 min in a solution of 0.6mg/ml chloronapthol/0.05% hydrogen peroxide in PBS, and then rinsed in distilled water. Western blotting. NRS and IRS were diluated 1:4 in sample buffer (0.2 M-Tris base, 1.0 M-sucrose, 5% mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Bromophenol blue, pH 8.8) and 10 p.l of each solution placed into a well in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Ten p.l of molecular mass markers comprising 180, 116, 84, 50 and 48 kDa protein subunits (Sigma) were used as comparisons. Electrophoresis was carried out using an LKB "Mighty Small" PAGE electrophoresis unit connected to an LKB Bromma 2197 40 mA power supply. Following separation proteins were electrophorectically transferred from the gels on to nitrocellulose blotting paper using a TE70 Semi-dry transfer unit (Hoefer Scientific Instruments) run at 80 mA. Nitrocellulose papers were temporarily stained with 0.2% Ponceau Red for 5 min to check that all bands had been transferred. The papers were then destained in distilled water and the proteins probed with a 1:200 dilution of rabbit a-clgM. Following this a 1:1000 dilution of peroxidase conjugated goat a-rlgG was added for 15-30 min. Final visualization was carried out as described above. Immunofluorescence labelling. Ligulosed roach fry, mean weight 0.65 +-0.01 g, were obtained from Tittesworth Reservoir, Staffordshire, U.K. Fish were maintained in dechlorinated, aerated tapwater at 12 _+ I°C and fed on commercial fish meal. Worms were removed under teleost Ringer (Lockwood, 1963) using parafilm-covered forceps and washed 3 x in fresh Ringer solution to remove any adherent host cells. The worms were then cut into approximately 3 mm pieces and each section prefixed in 2% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS (pH 7.4) for 4-6 h. After prefixing, worms were washed first in teleost Ringer and then PBS-I%BSA. After blocking in 3% BSA in PBS for 2 h, the tissue was again washed in PBS-I%BSA, and immersed for 2 h in primary antibody (a-clgM) in PBS at dilutions of 1:20, 1:50 and 1:100. Worm material was then washed and blocked as above and then incubated for 2 h in the secondary antibody, FITC conjugated c~-rlgG, at a dilution of either 1:10, 1:20, 1:40 or 1:80 in PBS. After washing, specimens were viewed using a Reichert Zetopan microscope with a twin lamp Binolux II source, set up for epifluorescence. Photographs were taken using Kodak EKTAR 1000/31 ° film. In addition to the above, four controls were prepared: (a) to check for autofluorescence, worms were incubated in PBS-3%BSA, in the absence of antibodies; (b) to check for non-specific binding of the secondary antibody (FITC a-rlgG) the a-clgM stage was omitted, (c) to check for non-specific binding of components other than antibody in the immune rabbit serum, normal rabbit serum was included at a dilution of 1:50, before applying the secondary antibody; (d) IRS was included before the application of the secondary antibody. This addition would check for and eliminate unbound a-IgM in the assay. Immunogold labelling. Worm material, washed and blocked as described above, was incubated for 2 h in primary antibody (polyclonal c~-clgM) in 0.5 MNaC1, 0.1%BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% Foetal Bovine Serum at a dilution of either l:10, 1:20, 1:50 or 1:100. After washing, the material was immersed for 2 h in the secondary antibody, goat anti-rabit IgG-gold conjugate (ee-rIgG gold), 10 nm particle size (Sigma) in 0.05 MNaC1, 0.01%BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% Foetal Bovine Serum at dilutions of 1:10, 1:20, 1:40 or 1:80, and postfixed overnight in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M-sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) 251 containing 2 mM-CaC1. The material was washed for 4 h in 0.1 M-sodium cacodylate, 2 mM-CaC1 and finally postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer for 2 h. After dehydration in a graded series of acetone (30, 60, 90, 100%) parasite material was embedded in Spurr's resin. Ultra-thin sections were viewed unstained using a Jeol 100 CX II electron microscope at 80 kV. Control preparations were as for immunofluorescence with the exception of the check for autofluorescence.
