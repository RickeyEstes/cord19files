and immune effector responses under varying conditions. For example, enterocytes release various cytokines, in-Cytokines cluding interleukin (IL)-8, in response to invasive bacte-All cytokines were purchased as lyophilized powders ria, 1,2 presumably to recruit neutrophils to sites of bacteshipped, aliquoted, and stored according to the suppliers' recrial invasion. On the other hand, many cytokines originating in mononuclear cells, such as interferon Particles with methionine-free medium containing 100 mCi/mL [ 35 S]-Single-shelled virus preparations were treated with 10 methionine. HT-29 cells were a gift from John Barnard, Vanmmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) before use to derbilt University. Caco-2 cells were obtained from American ensure removal of outer capsid proteins. Such EDTA-treated Type Tissue Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were grown in preparations had no residual infectivity when inoculated on RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, L-MA 104 cells without liposomes. Monolayers were washed glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin in a 5% CO 2 incubawith serum-free media and incubated at 37ЊC for 4 hours tor. Cells were grown in 96-or 24-well culture dishes. Unless with a mixture containing 10 mg/mL Lipofectin (GIBCO/BRL, otherwise stated, the cells were treated for the indicated times Gaithersburg, MD) and dilutions of CsCl-purified rotavirus with cytokines at the stated concentrations in fresh media after double-or single-shelled particles in serum-free media as dereaching confluence 4 days after plating. Control cells were scribed previously. 12 The cells were then fed an equal volume given fresh media without cytokine at the same time. Caco-2 of complete (10% fetal bovine serum) media and incubated cells, which were used 20 days after confluence for studies of overnight at 37ЊC. Infection was detected by immunoperoxidifferentiation effects, were fed fresh media every other day. dase staining.
