Cell cultures. Feline whole fetus cells (fcwf-4), Crandell feline kidney cells (CrFK) and Swine kidney cells (CPK) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 20% Leibovitz L-15 Medium (L-15 ) 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units ml-~ penicillin and 100 #g ml-~ streptomycin. The maintenance medium was MEM containing 20% L-15 and antibiotics as above. The cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 ° C. Viruses. The coronavirus isolates used in this study and their sources are shown in Table 1 . Among these virus strains, the authors isolated the strain KU-1 of FIPV from the liver cells of a kitten with the effusive form of FIP, and the strain KU-2 of FIPV from the peritoneal cells of an adult cat, also with effusive FIP. Among the FIPV strains used in the study, strains UCD-1, NW-1, UCD-2, UCD-3, UCD-4, Black, Yayoi and KU-2 show cell-associated growth, and are therefore regarded as Type I virus strains in the classification of Pedersen et al. (1984a) . Moreover, since strain KU-1, like strain 79-1146, Pedersen et al., 1984b McKeirnan et al., 1981 Pedersen et al., 1981a Pedersen, 1976a Pedersen et al., 1981a Pedersen and Black, 1983 Pedersen and Floyd, 1985 Pedersen and Floyd, 1985 Pedersen and Floyd, 1985 Black, 1982 Pedersen and Black, 1983 Hayashi et al., 1981 McKeirnan et al., 1981 Pedersen et al., 1984b Furuuchi et al., 1975 Harada el al., 1967 Binn et al., 1975 grows well even in CrFK cells in a non-cell associated manner, it is considered to be a Type II virus strain. FIPV and FECV, TGEV, and CCV were passaged two or three times in fcwf-4 cells, CPK cells, and CrFK cells, respectively, and were used for the study. Preparation of virus antigen. The antigen was prepared with the FIPV 79-1146 strain or FECV 79-1683 strain grown in fcwf-4 cell cultures. Infectious culture fluid concentrated about tenfold by ammonium sulfate precipitation was layered onto a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (20 and 60%) in an RPS 28 rotor (Hitachi Koki Co., Ltd., Japan) and centrifuged at 27 000 r.p.m, for 2 h. The virus bands formed were collected, diluted in NTE buffer, (0.1 M NaC1, 0.01 M Tris-HC1, pH 7.4, 0.001 M EDTA) and centrifuged at 80 000 g for 1 h. The virus-containing pellet was suspended in a 1/500 volume of NTE buffer. Production of antibody-secreting hybrydomas. BALB/c mice, about 5 weeks of age, were inoculated intraperitoneally with a mixture of 50/~g of the viral antigen prepared as above and 10 9 cells of pertussis adjuvant. Four or six weeks later the mice received an intravenous booster dose of 50/~g of viral antigen, and spleen cells were obtained for fusing 3 d later. The fusion was carried out by essentially the same method described by K/Shler and Milstein (1975) . Polyethyleneglycol-4000 (Merck, Germany) was used as a fusing agent and the ratio of mouse spleen cells and mouse myeloma cells (P-3/X-63-Ag8o6,5,3 ) was 10: 1. The selective medium contained hypoxanthine ( 10-4 M), aminopterin (4× l0 -7 M) and thymidine (1.6× 10 -5 M). The fused cells at a concentration of 3.5 × 10 6 spleen cells per ml was dispensed in 100 /A volumes into wells of 96-well, flat-bottomed microplates (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY ) and incubated at 37 ° C in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After incubation for 2 weeks, the wells were examined and those which contained hybridoma cultures were tested for feline coronavirus specific antibody by an indirect immunofluorescence test (see below). The colonies in antibody positive wells were passaged in 24-well multiplates (Coming Glass Works, Corning, NY) and incubated in medium containing hypoxanthine ( 10 -4 M) and thymidine ( 1.6× 10 -5 M). The cells were then cloned by the soft agar method.
