We The three equations for each system of equations in the empirical framework are estimated simultaneously, for more efficient estimators, using the generalized method of moments (GMM) based on the Newey-West covariance estimator due to the observed autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity in the time series data (Angrist and Pischke, 2009; Cameron and Trivedi, 2009; Greene, 1997; Verbeek, 2000) . The Newey-West estimator calculates consistent covariance matrices even when serial correlation and heteroskedasticity are present (Cameron and Trivedi, 2009; Johnston and DiNardo, 1997) , while the GMM allows one to drop the assumption of homoskedasticity and apply White's estimator for heteroskedasticity of unknown form (Greene, 1997) . The estimation method uses two-stage least squares coefficients with GMM standard errors using an optimal weighting matrix (Cameron and Trivedi, 2009), resulting in robust estimators and standard errors. Moreover, we used the fixed-effects model to estimate the econometric equations to control for any unobserved heterogeneity in the data and because the fixed-effects model yields robust estimators even when a number of time-invariant explanatory variables have not been included in the model (Johnston and DiNardo, 1997) . We used similar instruments in the GMM estimation of the short-term and long-term impact systems of equations such as a vector consisting of tourist arrivals from OECD (North America and Europe) and ASEAN countries, a vector consisting of the GDP growth rates of OECD and ASEAN countries, a vector consisting of the official exchange rates of OECD and ASEAN countries, tourist daily expenditures, tourist length of stay, domestic shocks, and international shocks. We also used dummy variables such as the FAA downgrade long-term impact and the EU ban long-term impact as instruments for the short-term impact system of equations and FAA downgrade short-term impact and the EU ban short-term impact for the long-term impact system of equations. We used the Sargan Test with a null hypothesis that "the overidentifying restrictions are valid" using the J-statistic, the value of the GMM objective function evaluated at the estimated coefficients multiplied by the sample size, and the chi-square test with m (number of instrumental variables) minus k (number of endogenous variables) degrees of freedom (df) (Hansen, 1982; Sargan, 1958 Sargan, , , 1988 ) and α¼0.01. The J-statistic for the short-term impact system of equations is 33.89 while the critical value for the chi-square (df¼23, α¼0.01)¼40.29, resulting in the non-rejection of the null-hypothesis. The J-statistic for the long-term impact system of equations is 33.30 while the critical value for the chisquare (df ¼17, α¼0.01)¼33.41, resulting in the non-rejection of the null-hypothesis. The results of the Sargan Test for over-identifying restrictions indicate that the instruments used for each system of equations are valid, that model misspecification is not an issue, and that the model is adequately specified, resulting in robust estimates and standard errors (Cameron and Trivedi, 2009 ).
