The mPCRs were optimized separately for CRV and CEV. Two mixtures containing standard plasmid were used as templates to optimize the annealing temperature (Ta). The primer concentrations used in this study were 10 mM. The reaction for detection of CRV was performed in a 20-μl volume that contained 10 μl of 2× Taq , and ddH 2 O. Gradient mPCR was performed for each mixture to optimize the reaction with gradient annealing temperatures (Ta) ranging from 55˚C to 65˚C. Both reaction procedures were as follows: initial denaturation at 97˚C for 5 min; 30 cycles of denaturation at 97˚C for 30 s, varied Ta for 45 s and 72˚C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72˚C for 8 min. 10 μl of mPCR product loans were evaluated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. To evaluate the specificity of the mPCRs, we performed specificity assays on CRV and CEV with CRV-and CEV-specific primers, respectively. Similar procedures were used to detect possible cross-reaction of CRV and CEV primers with RNA/DNA extracted from MDCK cells or from other pathogens (RABV, E. coli and Salmonella enterica). The nucleic acid extraction products of the MDCK cells, E. coli and Salmonella enterica were used directly as PCR templates. In contrast, the viral RNA extraction products of RABV required RT prior to use as templates. Both the individual plasmid and premixed plasmids were tested separately in this assay. The empty pMD-18T vector was used as a negative control. The sensitivity of the mPCR assays was also examined. The concentrations of the seven plasmids (pMD-CAV-2, pMD-CDV, pMD-CIV, pMD-CPIV, pMD-CanineCV, pMD-CCoV and pMD-CPV) were measured using a NanoDrop 2000 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA). Copy number was calculated by the following Table 1 . Primers used for PCR amplification of CRV and CEV. To verify the stability of the assay, the established mPCR methods were performed as three independent mPCR assays by using three different PCR instruments at different times. The plasmid mixtures for CRV and CEV were used as templates after dilution from 1×10 5 copies/ μl to 1×10 3 copies/μl. The optimal reaction conditions were explored by adjusting the annealing temperature, primer concentration, extension time, and cycle number. Premixed plasmids of CRV and CEV were used as templates to verify the mPCRs, and the products were visualized by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Ta was evaluated using a gradient, and the optimum Ta values were 59.4˚C and 58.2˚C, which yielded no primer dimers or nonspecific amplicons for CRV ( Fig 1A) or CEV (Fig 1B) . The specificity of the mPCRs was evaluated using other pathogens (RABV, E. coli and Salmonella enterica) and MDCK cells as templates. No specific amplicons showed in the lanes representing negative controls, E. coli, Salmonella enterica, RABV and MDCK cells, whereas the lanes for detection of CRV and CEV showed amplified bands in both CRV mPCR (Fig 2A) and CEV mPCR (Fig 2B) . Each plasmid was used as a template to evaluate the sensitivity of the mPCRs. For CRV, the minimum detection limits for pMD-CAV-2, pMD-CDV, pMD-CIV and pMD-CPIV were 1×10 3 (Fig 3A) , 1×10 3 (Fig 3B) , 1×10 4 ( Fig 3C) and 1×10 4 (Fig 3D) viral DNA copies, respectively. For CEV, the minimum detection limits for pMD-CAV-2, pMD-CanineCV, pMD-CCoV and pMD-CPV were 1×10 4 (Fig 4A) , 1×10 4 (Fig 4B) , 1×10 3 ( Fig 4C) and 1×10 3 (Fig 4D) viral DNA copies, respectively. The sensitivity test results revealed that the minimum simultaneous detection limit for mPCR of CRV was 1 × 10 4 viral copies (Fig 3E) , and the limit for CEV (Fig 4E) was also 1×10 4 viral copies. To evaluate the reproducibility of the assay, the detection mPCRs for both CRV and CEV were performed as three independent mPCR assays by using three different PCR instruments at different times. Three premixed plasmids for CRV ( Fig 5A) and CEV (Fig 5B) , with different dilutions, could be amplified under different conditions and showed similar results among the assays.
