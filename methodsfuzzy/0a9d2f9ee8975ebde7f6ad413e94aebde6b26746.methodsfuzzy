Chemicals. All chemicals including T-2 and tissue culture components were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise noted. Mice. Animal studies were conducted in accordance with NIH guidelines and were approved by the Michigan State University (MSU) Committee on Animal Use and Care. Female B6C3F1 mice aged 7-10 weeks were obtained from Charles River (Portage, MI) and acclimated for 1 week prior to experiments. Mice were housed under negative pressure in a BSL 2 room with humidity and temperature control at the MSU University Research Containment Facility. Virus. Reovirus serotype 1, strain Lang (T1/L) was grown in L929 fibroblast cells at 34°C in DMEM medium with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml of amphotericin B (Gibco). A third-passage plaque-purified virion (Furlong et al., 1988) was used for mouse infection and prepared by 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2trifluoroethane extraction and discontinuous CsCl gradient centrifugation (Silvey et al., 2001) . Titers of purified viruses were determined by standard plaque assay (Cuff et al., 1990) . Experimental design and sample collection. Mice were injected i.p. once with 0.05 to 1.75 mg/kg bw T-2 with the highest dose representing approximately 1/2 the LD 50 (Ueno, 1984; . After 2 h, mice were infected by oral gavage with 3 × 10 7 plaque-forming units (PFU) of reovirus in a total volume of 100 μl borate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.3% (w/v) of gelatin (London et al., 1987) . Fecal pellets were collected 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 days after viral infection and frozen at −20°C. At experiment termination, mice were bled and euthanized. Intestines and spleens were procured from euthanized mice and processed as described below. Lymphoid fragment cultures. A lymphoid fragment culture system (Logan et al., 1991) as modified by Cuff et al. (1998) was used to study immunoglobulin secretion. Briefly, seven PP per mouse were removed from intestine, pooled and washed three times in HBSS with 5 μg/ml of gentamicin and twice with tissue culture medium (TCM) consisting of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.5 μM of 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 μg/ml of gentamicin, 100 unit/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Individual patches were cut in half and incubated collectively in 2 ml of TCM for 5 days at 37°C under 5% CO 2 without additional stimulation. Lamina propria cultures were prepared, after removing PP, by splitting intestine longitudinally and cutting it into pieces 2-3 cm long. The fragments were washed at least 3 times with HBSS with 0.2% (w/v) NaHCO 3 , 0.1 M HEPES, and 5 μg/ml gentamicin. One half of the fragments were used for viral titer detection, and the rest were incubated twice for 30 min in 5 mM EDTA in HBSS to remove epithelial cells. The fragments without epithelial cells were washed twice more and then Virus titration. For viral plaque counts of GI tract (Major and Cuff, 1997) , intestinal segments were placed in 2 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline, freeze-thawed three times, and sonicated. Tissues were homogenized in 3 ml saline containing 0.3% gelatin. Serial dilutions (100 μl) in TCM were incubated on monolayers of L-929 fibroblasts in 12-well tissue culture plates for 45 min at 34°C and thereafter overlaid with 3 ml of 1% (w/v) agar in Medium 199 and cultured at 34°C. Plaques were counted after 7 days incubation. Real-time PCR for reovirus. Total RNA was extracted from 200 μl of supernatant of 10% (w/v) fecal suspension using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) and real-time PCR for reovirus L 2 gene was performed as reported previously . PCR primers for λ 2 core spike (L 2 gene) of reovirus T1/L were forward, 5′ ctg acg tcg atc agg tcg ttg 3′ and reverse, 5′ gat gtg gca tgc atg cat gag 3′. Purified reoviruses were added into 10% (w/w) of fecal pellet suspension from vehicle mice at concentrations of 0, 10 1 , 10 2 , 10 3 , 10 4 , 10 5 10 6 , and 10 7 PFU/ml for standard curve and sample quantification. ELISA. Serum was separated from clotted blood samples and stored at 4°C. Fecal pellets were suspended at 0.1 g/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, held on ice for 2 h, and then sonicated for 15 s. Solutions were cleared by high speed centrifugation for 10 min at 4°C and stored at − 20°C. Serum, culture fluid, and fecal supernatant were assayed for virus-specific IgA and IgG 2A antibody by the ELISA of Major and Cuff (1997) as modified by . Absorbance was used as endpoint for fecal and fragment cultures. For sera, geometric mean antibody titers were determined from the highest serum dilutions to yield absorbances of 0.2 or higher. Real-time PCR for cytokines. For cytokine PCR, PPs were collected and immediately put into RNA later (Ambion) at 4°C and total RNA isolated with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). RNA (1 μg) was denatured by incubation at 70°C for 10 min with 250 pM Oligo (dT) 12-15 primer (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed as previously described (Kinser et al., 2004) on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector with ABI SYBR Green PCR core kit (Applied Biosystem). Primer sequences (Table 1) were based on published cytokine mRNA sequences (Samuel and Knutson, 1983; Overbergh et al., 2003) . Reactions contained a total volume of 12.5 μl: 1 μM primer pair 3 mM Mg +2 , 0.8 mM dNTP mixture, 6 ng cDNA template, 0.075 μl Taq Gold DNA polymerase (ABI). Reactions were started by incubation at 95°C for 5 min and followed by 40 two-step thermal cycles of each 15 s denaturation at 95°C, 60 s primer annealing, and extension at 60°C. Real-time threshold cycle (C t ) value for each sample was determined. Negative control and positive samples ranging After 4 days, total fecal pellet and PP RNA were purified, and L-2 RNA quantified by real-time PCR. Data are mean ± SEM (n = 6). Bars without the same letter differ significantly (P b 0.05). Fig. 4 . T-2 suppress reovirus-specific IgA response in feces. Mice were treated with 0 or 1.75 mg/kg of T-2 i.p. and then 2 h later orally infected with 3 × 10 7 PFU of reovirus. Fecal pellets were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 days after infection. Virus-specific IgA in fecal suspensions was determined by ELISA. Data are means ± SEM (n = 9). Asterisks indicate significant difference between control vehicle from groups given T-2 (P b 0.05). from 10 1 to 10 8 copies/ml of target gene were used for standard curve and sample quantification. Statistics. Data were analyzed using Sigma Stat software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). For comparisons of two groups of data, Student's t test was performed. For comparison of multiple groups of data, a Kruskal-Wallis oneway ANOVA on ranks and SNK post hoc test were used. Data sets were considered significantly different when P b 0.05.
