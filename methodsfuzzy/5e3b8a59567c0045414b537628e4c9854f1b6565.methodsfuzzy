Glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins have been used for more than 20 years for the synthesis of recombinant proteins in bacterial expression systems (Smith and Johnson, 1988) . The GST pull-down method can be used to identify interactions between one known and several unkown proteins or to demonstrate and analyze an already identified protein interaction (Kaelin et al., 1991; Orlinick and Chao, 1996; Sambrook and Russell, 2006) . Based on the results reported by Zhou et al. (2008) , Zhang et al. (2014) recently analyzed the interaction of EF1␣ with the nucleocapsid protein of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). Using a GST pull-down assay after expressing the GST-N fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21, Zhang et al. confirmed the interaction between TGEV N and EF1␣. In TGEV-infected ST cells, the viral N protein co-localized with EF1␣. A knockdown of EF1␣ protein in ST cells using siRNA led to a reduction in viral N protein expression as well as in TGEV replication. Using a similar GST pull-down approach, McBride and coworkers demonstrated that a dibasic motif present in the C-terminal part of the SARS-CoV S and IBV S protein cytoplasmic domain interacts with COPI (McBride et al., 2007) . For this purpose, the C-terminal 29 amino acids from the coronavirus S protein were fused to GST by using the expression vector pGEX2T. The respective constructs were transformed into competent E. coli BL21 cells and GST fusion proteins were purified from bacterial cell lysates using Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. To demonstrate binding to COPI, McBride et al. incubated 10 g of each purified GST fusion protein with CHO cell lysates on Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. In a following Western blot analysis they detected COPI in the GST-IBV S and GST-SASRS S samples using an anti--COP antibody when the cell lysates had been prepared at pH 6.5. COPI coatomer components were also detected in purified SARS-CoV particles by Neuman et al. (2008) . As the COPI coatomer is involved in the retrograde vesicular transport between Golgi and ER and in transport from the intermediate compartment to the cis-Golgi (Kirchhausen, 2000; Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2005) it may have a role in SARS-CoV and IBV assembly by concentrating the S protein at the site of coronavirus budding. The GST pull-down assay is a long-known affordable approach to look for cellular interaction partners. Moreover, it was successfully used to demonstrate the interaction of coronaviral proteins with cellular proteins (McBride et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2014) . We performed a GST pull-down assay to identify cellular proteins that may interact with the TGEV S protein. The S protein of TGEV contains a tyrosine-based retention signal in the C-terminal part of its cytoplasmic domain (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2004) . Recently, we have shown that this retention signal leads to the subcellular localization of the TGEV S protein at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), the site where coronavirus assembly and budding occurs (Paul et al., 2014) . We assume that this localization is determined by the interaction of one or more cellular proteins with the tyrosine-based sorting signal present in TGEV S and that this interaction may play a role in virus assembly.
