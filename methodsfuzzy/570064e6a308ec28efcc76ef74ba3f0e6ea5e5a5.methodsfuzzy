In silico screening of DPP-4 inhibitors Virtual screening has been seamlessly integrated into drug discovery and development 75 and its success significantly relies on compound library, 76 especially the structural diversity of compound library. 77 For instance, microalgal metabolites were screened for DDP-4 inhibitors. 78 Compared with the synthesized chemicals, natural compound libraries generally consist of more structurally diverse compounds than their synthetic counterparts, 79 providing a better screening resource. As such, numerous studies have adopted various natural compound libraries to find novel DDP-4 inhibitors as listed in Table 2 . It is not uncommon to observe that docking studies were carried out based on a single DDP-4 crystal structure, despite the fact that a great number of DDP-4-inhibitor co-complex structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Deng et al. 88 for instance, docked a series of synthesized triazole-based uracil derivatives into the linagliptin-DDP4 co-complex structure (PDB code: 2RGU) using the standard precision (SP) Glide (Schr√∂dinger, Inc.), which places internally generated ligand conformations with various positions and orientations into the binding pocket. Deng et al. 89 employed Gold (Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center), which is a genetic algorithm (GA)-based scheme to explore the conformational flexibility of ligand and the rotational flexibility of receptor, to dock synthesized pyrazolo inhibitors into the quinazolinone-DDP4 co-complex structure (PDB code: 2ONC). 90 It should be noted that both Glide and Gold are flexible docking algorithms. 91 Nevertheless, DDP-4 is unrestrained per se as manifested by the fact that DDP-4 consists of various binding subsites, namely S 1 , S' 1 , S 2 , S' 2 , and extensive S 2 , etc., to which the corresponding amino acids of the DDP4 substrate peptide designated by P 1 , P' 1 , P 2 , P' 2 , etc. from the nearest to the farthest cleavage point can bind as shown in Figure 1 ,92 and S 2 , which is composed of various hydrophobic residues, namely GLU205 and GLU206 dyad and ARG125, is highly plastic. 93 Furthermore, Nabeno et al. categorized inhibitors into three different classes (Figure 1 ) based on the interactions between inhibitor and DDP-4 subsites as listed in Table 3 , from which it can be observed that inhibitors of different classes bind to different DDP-4 subsites, and S 1 and S 2 are the Table 2 . Natural compound libraries adopted by various studies.
