A 69-year-old Greek national presented to a tertiary care hospital in Athens on 17 April 2014 with prolonged fever, diarrhea and pneumonia (onset of symptoms on 8 April). He had arrived a few hours earlier from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he resides permanently [6] . Because of high suspicion of MERS-CoV infection, two oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected on 17 April (specimen A) and 18 April (specimen B) for laboratory investigation. The purpose of the urgent clinical care testing needed was explained to the patient and written consent was obtained for potential publication. For molecular detection of MERS-CoV RNA, two real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays targeting regions upstream of envelope gene (UpE) and the open reading frame (ORF) 1a were used [7] . Partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and N genes and BLAST analysis of the amplicon sequences was also performed as previously described [7] . A serum sample collected from the patient after six days of hospitalization was available for serological testing using the Anti-MERS Coronavirus Indirect Immunofluoresence kit (Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany). In addition to partial sequencing, full length ORFs of the S (4042 nt) and N (1242 nt) protein genes were obtained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA, using Sanger sequencing methods and deposited into the GenBank database under accession numbers KJ782550 and KJ782549, respectively. Sequences were confirmed independently by two separate CDC laboratories.
