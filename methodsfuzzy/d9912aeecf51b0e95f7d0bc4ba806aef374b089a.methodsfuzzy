Analytical analysis of gene expression includes hierarchical clustering, self-organized mapping, principal components analysis, K-means clustering, and nearestneighbor clustering. Hierarchical clustering is the most commonly used method of identifying groups of closely related genes or samples [26, 27] . Hierarchical clustering is a method that successively links genes or samples with similar profiles to form a tree structure that is very much like a phylogenetic tree. This technique has become popular for four reasons: (1) it simplifies large volumes of data; (2) the analysis reveals groups of similar genes; (3) it visualizes the data in a hierarchical way using interactive computer programs; and (4) the results are visualized in a style which is familiar to many geneticists. The algorithm calculates distances between genes or between samples using single linkage, complete linkage, or average linkage. Complete linkage defines the distance between two clusters as the average of the distances between all pairs of points in the two clusters. Average linkage is an intermediate value between single and complete linkage and tends to perform well in many microarray applications. Principal components analysis is used to reduce multidimensional data to a single x-y graph [28] [29] [30] . The data from expression arrays are often of high dimensionality. This analysis allows the data to be reduced into a lower dimensionality that is more suitable for visual analysis. When reducing the gene dimensions, the first step is to construct a variance-covariance matrix for the genes. Then, a new variable called the eigenvector is transformed from the matrices. The first principal component is the axis that captures the most variation between patients and has the highest eigenvalue. The second principal component is orthogonal to the first, maximizing the remaining variance. Self-organized mapping is a related method that allocates genes or samples to a predefined number of clusters that relate to each other on a spatial grid [31] . K-means clustering is a non-hierarchical clustering that allows genes or samples to cluster appropriately. Knearest-neighbors clustering is the simplest method for grouping samples [26] . The general form of k-nearestneighbors clustering uses k nearest neighbors and proceeds as follows: (1) for each patient, the k nearest neighbors is found according to the distance metric used, and (2) the class that is most common among the k neighbors is predicted.
