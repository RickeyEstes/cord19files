Of the 330 faecal samples collected from pigs of various age-groups in the Port Moresby area during November 1981--March 1982, 232 samples were from pigs raised on concrete in two commercial farms with similar, modem production practices, and 98 were from free-ranging and scavenging village pigs. In addition, intestinal contents from five wild boars which were killed by villagers were also obtained during the same period. In the Parasitology Research Laboratory of the University of PNG, the faecal samples were macerated in 2.5% (w/v) potassium dichromate solution, filtered through cheesecloth, and placed in thin layers in Petridishes for 14 days at room temperature (24--26Â°C) to allow sporulation of oocysts. Centrifugal flotation in concentrated NaCl solution was used to concentrate oocysts for microscopic observation, and counting of oocysts per gram (opg) faeces was done according to the modified McMaster method. Identification of oocysts strictly followed previously published descriptions of oocysts of porcine coccidia (Biester and Murray, 1934; Vetterling, 1965; Pell6rdy, 1974) . Data on the general prevalence of coccidia, predominance of each species observed, and oocysts per gram faeces were collected separately for diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic piglets (<24 days), weaners (>24 days--6 months), lactating sows, and gestating sows {Tables I and II, Fig. 1 ). the wild boar, four were positive for coccidia. The results showed substantially higher percentage incidences of oocysts in the diarrhoeic {53.3%) and non-diarrhoeic (62.5%) village piglets compared to 36.6 and 30.4%, respectively, of their counterparts in the commercial farms. On the other hand, the farm-raised weaners and sows showed comparatively higher prevalence of oocysts than the free-ranging ones in the village system (Table I) . The cumulative prevalence of oocysts in all the age groups of the farm-raised and village pigs was 46.6 (108/232) and 54.0% (53/98), respectively. Nine of the 15 known species of porcine coccidia were recovered from the samples (Table I ). In their decreasing order of predominance in all the age groups of the pigs raised on concrete, the species observed were Eimeria debliecki (26.7%), E. scabra (22.4%), E. neodebliecki (19.8%), E. porci (15.5%), E. suis (11.6%), E. polita (8.6%), E. perminuta (6.9%), E. spinosa (5.6%) and Isospora suis (3.9%). In the village pigs also, the first five species listed above predominated, with slight variations in the percentage of their prevalence. Oocysts of E. polita, E. spinosa and I. subs were each found in 4%, and E. perminuta in 8.2%, of the village pigs. The total prevalence of/. suis in the 330 pigs sampled was 3.9%, and this coccidium was not recovered from the lactating and gestating village sows and the 5 wild boar (Table I}.
