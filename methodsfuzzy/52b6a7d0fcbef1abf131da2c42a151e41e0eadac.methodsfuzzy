This study adopts the hedonic price method to determine the marginal WTP and ES for each architectural and environmental attribute for the information of homebuyers and building developers in Hong Kong, based upon performance indicators developed earlier by the authors (Fung & Lee, 2011 , 2014 and representative transaction records. Previous studies have identified that the contingent valuation survey method (Altaf, 1994; Kang, Haab, & Interis, 2013; Torres, Green, & Ortúzar, 2013) , travel costs method (Chae, Wattage, & Pascoe, 2012; Gürlük & Rehber, 2008) and hedonic price method (Chan, So, Tang, & Wong, 2012; Cotteleer & Kooten, 2012) are the most used for determining the implicit price of an attribute for substitution with a less desired option. Among the three, the contingent valuation method is often considered not reliable because it is based on what people say they will do rather than what people are observed to do (Kang et al., 2013) and the travel cost model method is only good for valuating site-specific attributes (Chae et al., 2012; Gürlük & Rehber, 2008) . The hedonic price method estimates value based on actual choices, is considered the most suitable for valuating price for various architectural and environmental attributes (Cotteleer & Kooten, 2012) . In the use of the hedonic price method, a residential property's market price (PRI) is represented as a function of "n" attributes, i.e. PRI ¼ f(X 1 , ……, X n ) for multiple regression analysis for analyzing the marginal WTP of the attributes. This appraisal methodology was set by Eisenlauer (1968) . After his article, many other researchers have explored the use of multiple regression analysis for property prices analysis (Rosen, 1974) . However, to ensure marginal WTP is determined based on actual choices, the successful use of this method is subject to: i) availability of reliable property prices; and ii) homebuyers knowing and choosing the attributes (Collins, Scorcu, & Zanola, 2009) . In respect of reliability of source of data, property transaction records (property details and selling prices) in Hong Kong are readily available through many sources (Centreline Property, 2013; Midland Realty, 2013) and so can be good indication of property prices. But considering Hong Kong residential property price fluctuates month by month and year by year due to different reasons, transaction records to be selected must be representative and should be free from impact of economic conditions and government policies. For knowing and choosing the attributes, unfortunately, most homebuyers do not have the background required to understand the physical meaning of the attributes, particularly the environment-related issues. Hence, simple indicators for representing the performance of various environmental attributes need to be developed.
