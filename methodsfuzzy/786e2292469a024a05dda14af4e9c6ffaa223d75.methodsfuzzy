Sample volume in addition to sampling method are the most challenging steps required in the identification of HEV in environmental samples [78, 79] . For the initial concentration of viruses, the adsorption elution principle has been widely applied for the primary concentration of enteric viruses from water, based on the fact that viruses mechanisms are linked to the surface charge [80, 81] . In line with the distinguishing viral particle surface capabilities, they have the potential to eagerly adsorb to a number of materials [82] . However, in recent years, a wide range of concentration procedures and techniques have been implemented for the primary and secondary concentration of viruses in water samples. This entails the adsorption of virus-related particles or phages onto the surface of a filter membrane, through the interaction of electrostatic charges, followed by elution with the appropriate buffer system [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] . Alternatively, the concentration of viral particles could also be based upon size exclusion of the particles, rather than the electrostatic interactions of the filters on the viruses [82] , with varying adsorbent material and elution buffers. In Africa, some of these concentration techniques have been used and reported [59, 70, 72, 88] . Table 2 provides a short summary of the conventional and improved concentration procedures used for the recovery of HEV in environmental samples.  In vitro growth methods such as cell culture are the most pronounced traditional standards used to identify and detect the occurrence of HEV in environmental samples [82, 98, 99] . Cell culture is a technique whereby a microorganism's cells are grown at a carefully controlled condition outside of the living animal [100] . It is a very time consuming, laborious and expensive approach that usually demands prior knowledge of the targeted species [51, 70] . The limiting factor with this method is that there are some viral species that are not capable of producing any cytopathic effect when propagated on a cell line [51] . HEV detection has also been explored using the integrated cell culture polymerase chain reaction (ICC-PCR), this technique has also been used for the discovery of HEV in ecological samples [65, 101, 102] . The merit of this technique is that it gives room for several modifications of the protocols, enhanced the direct analysis and monitoring of HEV in environmental samples [103] [104] [105] [106] . Epifluoroescence and transmission microscopy, is another type of conventional technique that has been explored for the abundance, morphological and enumeration studies of viral entities within the aquatic environments [107, 108] . Here, the virus-like particles are counted using fluorescent nucleic acid stains through visualisation [107] [108] [109] [110] . Flow cytometry and vortex flow filtration (VFF) have also been used for the quantification and counting of virus-like particles and prokaryotes in aquatic environments [98, 111, 112] . Figure 3 exhibits the numerous molecular approaches that have been used in the diagnostics and identification of HEV in environmental samples.

Figure 3 exhibits the numerous molecular approaches that have been used in the diagnostics and identification of HEV in environmental samples.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a sensitive conventional assay technique that is used on targeted amplification of the viral DNA or RNA over a range of magnitude to produce thousands or millions of copies [51, 106] . PCR methods are designed to amplify a single specific nucleic acid sequence a million times under three distinctive steps that include denaturation, annealing and extension. For denaturation to take place, the target DNA is subjected to a high temperature in other for the DNA strands to be separated. Annealing of the primers to the target DNA allows the DNA to polymerase and selectively amplify the target DNA at a lower temperature [51] . PCR assays are very sensitive, highly specific, and particularly attractive for detection of non-cultivable infectious agents thereby making it an attractive method for the detection of target pathogens [51] . A comprehensive array of PCR systems exists for rapid detection and confirmation of the presence of HEV in different environmental samples. These samples include water sediments [113, 114] , wastewater treatment  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a sensitive conventional assay technique that is used on targeted amplification of the viral DNA or RNA over a range of magnitude to produce thousands or millions of copies [51, 106] .

A comprehensive array of PCR systems exists for rapid detection and confirmation of the presence of HEV in different environmental samples. These samples include water sediments [113, 114] , wastewater treatment [59, 115] , treated and untreated sewage [115, 116] , groundwater [117] , and surface water [69, 102] . A wide range of primers have been designed for the precise detection of many HEV and an immediate overview of these is presented in Table 3 . The chief limitation of the PCR techniques is that they are incapable of distinguishing between active and inactive targets, and are found to be prone to inhibition due to the interaction with DNA or interference with the DNA polymerase which increases false negative results. In addition, different primer sequences make it inappropriate for use, especially with the discovery of unique viruses. Previous information of the viral sequence is, therefore, a pre-requisite for any PCR reaction. Various modifications of the PCR assay have been used for detection of HEV, and they include the nested [118] , multiplex [119] [120] [121] , real time [106] , and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction [118] , all displaying their own merits and demerits. [134, 135] The presence of norovirus, astrovirus, enterovirus have been established have been established in surface water, ground water and wastewater samples via multiplex and nested PCR [51, 120, 136] . Other modified PCR techniques developed are the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The RT-PCR are able to amplify and detect HEV viruses that possess only the RNA genomic information [27, 49, 69, 89, [109] [110] [111] [112] . These techniques has been implemented for the identification of different groups of the HEV in various environments [78, 83, 84, 106, 117, [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] [142] . These techniques also offer better rates of detection, and great sensitivity and accuracy. In addition, they are precise, they reduce experiment time and the Viruses 2018, 10, 429 9 of 25 possible source of contamination is reduced [51, 78] . A summary of the numerous molecular techniques, principles, merits and limitations is presented in Table 4 .
