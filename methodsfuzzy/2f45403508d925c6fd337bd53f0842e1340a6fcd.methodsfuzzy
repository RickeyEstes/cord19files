Foreskin tissues were obtained from a randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in Kisumu, Kenya, through the Universities of Nairobi, Illinois and Manitoba Collaborative Research Project. Men aged 18 to 24 years were recruited into an unblinded trial with two arms: the circumcision arm and the delayed circumcision (control) arm to examine whether male circumcision reduced HIV incidence. 13 For the present study, samples were randomly selected before circumcision and stratified by HSV-2 serological status. Equal numbers of specimens were randomly selected from each stratum and matched for age (18-20 and 21-24 years). The STD screening included a history of discharge and previously diagnosed sexually transmitted infections (STIs), a clinical examination 2 weeks before and at the time of circumcision, as well as laboratory analysis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid) and Treponema pallidum (syphilis). 14 Serum specimens were tested for HSV-2 antibody (Kalon HSV-2 IgG ELISA, Kalon Biological Limited, Aldershot, UK), using the manufacturer's recommended cut-off. 14
