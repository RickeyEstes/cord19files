MCEs overwhelm health care systems and resources, and anesthesiologists may need to provide care in austere environments; thus, anesthesiologists should be prepared to improvise anesthetic techniques when commonly used modern equipment (eg, ventilators, anesthesia machines, ultrasound machines, medications) is unavailable. Anesthesiologists must be prepared to deliver anesthesia through alternative methods. For example, patient ventilation may need to be performed by hand. Regional and neuraxial techniques may be performed in certain surgeries and in the absence of anesthesia equipment. Alternatively, in developing countries, older anesthesia machines, breathing apparatuses, and volatiles seldom used in the states (ie, halothane), may be the only equipment available. Finally, the wide range of medications we have at our disposal in everyday use may be unavailable. Ketamine is a preferred anesthetic in developing world ORs during disasters. It preserves airway reflexes and spontaneous respiration, has analgesic properties, supports the cardiovascular system, and does not need complex supportive equipment. However, access may be extremely limited to a few older drugs (eg, diethyl ether, chloroform). Providers should be familiar with the routes of administration, dosage, and adverse effects [67] . The infrastructure of hospitals and ORs may be underdeveloped with unreliable oxygen supply, electricity, and nonfunctioning or unavailable necessary anesthesia equipment (eg, endotracheal tubes, laryngoscopes). These limitations can be challenging. Under these circumstances, anesthetic procedures that can be carried out safely and effectively in resource-limited settings include neuraxial/regional anesthesia, general anesthesia without intubation (spontaneous ventilation), total intravenous anesthesia while spontaneously breathing, general anesthesia with intubation, or combined anesthesia [68] . Providers must be flexible in their anesthetic practice and not be dependent on technology or drug variety [69] . Ultrasounds may not be available, and placing central lines and regional blocks are performed using anatomic landmarks. Providers may also need to bring their own portable monitors (eg, pulse oximeter, blood pressure cuff) to austere or underserved areas [70] . The 2010 earthquake in Haiti led to the destruction of most medical facilities, making the delivery of immediate surgical management challenging. Physicians were required to work out of tents without power, sterile conditions, means to administer oxygen, and anesthetics, in addition to having limited surgical supplies. Most of the procedures needed to be performed using regional/neuraxial techniques [71] . Regional techniques also help manage pain.
