Experimental data were processed and analyzed using SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). All indicators were expressed as mean Â± standard deviation. Multiple comparisons were carried out by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test or oneway ANOVA with repeated measures and Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons. All tests were two-tailed and P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Differences with P < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
