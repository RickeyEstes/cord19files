Bis isopropyl phosphonoethoxyethylchloride (1) (2.58 g, 10.0 mmol) or bis isopropyl phosphonomethyltosylate (7) bromotrimethylsilane (13 ml) overnight at room temperature. The mixture was then evaporated and codistilled with acetonitrile (3 Â 25 mL), water (2 Â 25 ml), ethanol (25 mL) and toluene (3 Â 25 mL). The syrupy residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (50 ml) then DMF (0.1 ml) and oxalyl chloride (6.0 ml, 68.8 mmol) were added. The solution was gently refluxed (2 h), evaporated to dryness, and redissolved in dichloromethane (20 ml). The solution was cooled down to 0 C and treated slowly with pyridine (1.6 ml). The mixture was added to a cooled (À30 C) solution of hexadecyloxypropanol (6.01 g, 20 mmol) in dichloromethane (100 ml) and triethylamine (8.7 ml). The mixture was allowed to reach 0 C and kept at this temperature for 3 h. The reaction mixture was evaporated, codistilled with toluene (3 Â 50 ml) and the residue was chromatographed on a silica gel column (400 g) in EtOAc/hexane (1:2 / 1:1). The mixture of 6-chloropurine or 2-amino-6-chloropurine (1.5 mmol, 232 or 254 mg, respectively), bis (hexadecyloxypropyl) phosphonoethoxyethylchloride (754 mg, 1.0 mmol), Cs 2 CO 3 (326 mg, 1.0 mmol) and DMF (10 ml) was heated to 100 C for 6 h (reaction with aminochloropurine) or 16 h (reaction with chloropurine). The mixture was evaporated and the residue was chromatographed on a silica gel column (50 g) in 6% MeOH/CHCl 3 . The crude product was refluxed in 80% aqueous acetic acid for 2 h, then concentrated and chromatographed on a silica gel column (30 g) in 7% MeOH/CHCl 3 . The mixture of 3 or 4 (0.2 mmol, 170 mg or 174 mg respectively) and LiN 3 (1.6 mmol, 78 mg) in DMF (2 ml) was heated to 100 C for 16 h and then evaporated. The syrupy residue was chromatographed on a silica gel column in MeOH/CHCl 3 (20% / 40%). The combined fractions containing product were evaporated and dissolved in hot water (2 ml, drop of 10% aqueous ammonia was added for complete dissolution). The solution was neutralized with aqueous hydrochloric acid to pH z 3. Crystallized product was filtered off and washed with water.  A mixture of 6-O-benzylpurine (9) or 2-amino-6-O-benzylpurine (10) (20 mmol, 4.52 g or 4.82 g, respectively), S-(À)-glycidol trityl ether (6.33 g, 20 mmol), Cs 2 CO 3 (800 mg, 2.5 mmol) in DMF (100 ml) was heated to 100 C for 10 h. The solution was evaporated and the syrupy residue was chromatographed on a silica gel column (500 g) in EtOAc/toluene (1:3).  A mixture of 11 or 12 (2.4 mmol, 1.30 g or 1.34 g respectively) and 8 (2.66 g, 3.6 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (20 ml) was treated with NaH (60% suspension in mineral oil, 290 mg, 7.2 mmol) while cooling down (À25 C). The mixture was stirred at a room temperature overnight and then heated to 35 C for 8 h. The mixture was then neutralized with acetic acid (0.27 ml, 4.8 mmol) and partitioned between chloroform (100 ml) and aqueous saturated solution of NaCl (100 ml). The aqueous portion was extracted with chloroform again (50 ml). The combined organic portions were dried with MgSO 4 evaporated and the syrupy residue was chromatographed on a silica gel column (200 g) in gradient EtOAc/toluene (1:1) / EtOAc. Syrupy trityl derivative was dissolved in Et 2 O/MeOH (1:1, 10 ml). The solution was acidified with methanolic solution of hydrogen chloride to pH 2e3 and stirred for 48 h. The product crystallized overnight in a fridge. The mother liquors were concentrated and chromatographed on a silica gel column in methanol/chloroform/hexane (1:5:5). (14) Yield 0.68 g (32%  To a solution of 13 or 14 (0.5 mmol, 435 mg or 442 mg, respectively) in dioxane (25 ml) an aqueous solution of NaOH (2M, 0.5 ml, 1.0 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 48 h. The solution was neutralized with hydrochloric acid (1 M, 1.1 ml, 1.1 mmol). Mixture was evaporated, codistilled with toluene and the residue was chromatographed on a silica gel column (20 g) in methanol/chloroform (1:4 / 1:2).
