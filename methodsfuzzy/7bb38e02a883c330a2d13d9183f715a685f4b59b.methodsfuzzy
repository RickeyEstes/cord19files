Bacteriophages and plaque assay Bacteriophages T2 and T4 of E. coli strains C and B, respectively, were obtained from Ward's Natural Science (Rochester, NY) and Carolina Biological Supply Company (Burlington, NC). Bacteriophage titrations were performed by the double agar layer technique (Lipson and Alsmadi, 1989) . Briefly, 0.1 ml virus was inoculated into 10 ml overlay medium (0.75% tryptic soy agar containing log growth phase E. coli strains B or C). Underlay consisted of the same medium but contained 1.5% agar. Plates were incubated at 37 1C for 24-48 h. Plaques were counted on a bacteriologic colony counter and recorded as plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml. The bacteriophage strains were temporarily stored at 4 1C.
