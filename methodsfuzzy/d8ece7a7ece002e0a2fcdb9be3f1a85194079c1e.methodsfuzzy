Bacterial Strains. N . gonorrhoeae MS11 variants were propagated on gonococcal clear typing agar (20) . Wild-type variants MS11mk expressing chromosomally encoded Opa proteins were provided by J. Swanson and are designated according to Swanson et al. (21) by capitals, e.g., OpaA-OpaK. Recombinant MS11 Opa variants (5) were a gift of T.F. Meyer (Max-Planck Institut für Biologie, Tübingen, Germany). Opa protein expression was verified by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of bacterial lysates followed by detection with anti-Opa antibody 4B12 (21) . Only nonpiliated bacteria were used. For experiments, bacteria were grown for 3 h in 10 ml Hepes medium (10 mM Hepes, 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM glucose, and 1.5% proteose peptone no. 3 [Difco]), pH 7.4, in a gyratory shaker at 37 Њ C. Bacterial suspensions were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml Hepes buffer (Hepes medium without proteose peptone). Construction of Mutant CD66 N-domains. The construction of 6xHis-tagged N-domains of CD66e and CD66b in the pRSET-A vector was described previously (18) . Mutations were introduced in CD66 N-domains by a modification of the procedure of Picard et al. (22) . In brief, a mutagenic primer was designed containing the desired base changes flanked by at least 12 perfectly matched bases both upstream and downstream of the mutation (a list of primers is available on request). A megaprimer was generated by PCR using the mutagenic primer and a common vector-based 3 Ј primer (pRSET-rev) with the CD66 N-domain construct as template. The pRSET-rev primer was removed by passing the reaction mixture through a 100-kD Centricon device (5 min at 3,000 g ; Amicon). A second PCR was performed with the same template plus 17 l of the 50 l of 100-kD Centricon retentate as 3 Ј primer and a common vector-based 5 Ј primer (pRSET-for). The resultant PCR product was cut with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into pRSET-A. Constructs were electroporated into E . coli strain BL21 (DE3; Novagen). Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing through the entire N-domain insert. Primers were purchased from Genosys and restriction enzymes from New England Biolabs. Binding of CD66 N-domains by Gonococci. Cleared lysates of E . coli cells expressing the appropriate CD66 N-domain were prepared as described (18) . Gonococci (10 8 ) in 200 l Hepes buffer were incubated with 5-10 l of cleared lysate for 20 min at 37 Њ C. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation (5 min at 2,000 g ), washed twice with 1 ml Hepes buffer, then solubilized in 30 l SDS-PAGE sample buffer of which 2.5 l was electrophoresed in 13.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Bound CD66 N-domains were detected by anti-His antibody (1:15,000; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by peroxidase-conjugated protein A (1:20,000; Sigma Chemical Co.). Blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Documentation and quantification of bands were performed with an AlphaImager ® 2000 Imaging system (Alpha Innotech). Construction of CD66b cDNA Mutants. CD66b cDNA in pUC118 was a gift from Motomu Kuroki (Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan). The CD66b insert was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pTracer-CMV2 (Invitrogen). All mutations were made first in the CD66b N-domain construct in pRSET-A as outlined above. To introduce mutated N-domains into the full-length CD66b cDNA, the BlpI site present at the start of the N-domain in CD66b cDNA was introduced in the CD66b N-domain construct in the pRSET-A vector by PCR. For introduction of the chimeric CD66e/b N-domain into CD66b, the BlpI site present in CD66b (GCTCAGC) was mutated to the BlpI site found in CD66e (GCTAAGC) by megaprimer PCR, in order to have the N-domain start with the CD66e-derived lysine. The resultant PCR product was cleaved with BlpI and NsiI (NsiI cuts at residue 71 in CD66 N-domains) and substituted with the fragment present in the full-length CD66b cDNA in pTracer-CMV2. To substitute the entire CD66b N-domain with the CD66e N-domain, a silent mutation containing a ClaI site was introduced at residue 113 just downstream of the N-domain in CD66b. The CD66e N-domain in pRSET-A was amplified with primers containing a BlpI and a ClaI site, respectively, cut and ligated into BlpI/ClaI-cut CD66b. The constructs were electroporated into E . coli DH5 ␣ . All mutations in the pTracer-CMV2-CD66b constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Transfection Procedure. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Pro5) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were grown in RPMI 1640/5% FCS in 25-cm 2 flasks to 50% confluency. Plasmid preparations of pTracer-CMV2-CD66b mutants were made by the Wizard miniprep procedure (Promega Corp.). Pro5 cells were incubated in 2 ml DMEM/10% Nuserum (Collaborative Biomedical Products) containing 4 g plasmid DNA and 0.2 mg/ml DEAE-dextran ( M r 5 ϫ 10 5 ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h at 37 Њ C. Cells were then shocked with 2.5 ml 10% DMSO in PBS for 1 min at room temperature, washed once with HBSS, and subsequently cultured overnight in RPMI 1640/5% FCS (23) . The next day, the transfectants were trypsinized and seeded onto 12-mm-diameter circular glass coverslips in 24-well plates (10 5 cells per coverslip). Cells were cultured for 2-3 d before infection assays were carried out. Infection Assay. Gonococci (1.5 ϫ 10 7 ) were added to 24-well plates containing the transfected cell cultures on coverslips, in 1 ml DMEM (without serum) for 45 min at 37 Њ C and 5% CO 2 . Nonadherent bacteria were removed by three washes with HBSS. Infected cultures were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS for at least 30 min. Staining Procedures. Fixed infected cells were incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min and then blocked with 5% FCS in PBS for 1 h. Antibodies were diluted in PBS/0.05% Tween/0.5% FCS. To detect receptor expression, cells were stained with rabbit anti-CD66 antiserum (1:200; Dako) followed by Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (GAR) IgG (1:400; Molecular Probes, Inc.). To subsequently stain gonococci, coverslips were incubated with a mouse mAb against gonococcal LPS, generated in our laboratory by J. Swanson, followed by FITCconjugated goat anti-mouse (GAM) IgG (1:400; Sigma Chemical Co.). When only receptor expression was evaluated, the permeabilization step with Triton X-100 was omitted. mAb Kat4C was provided by H. Turley (John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK). To distinguish extra-and intracellular bacteria, infected cell cultures on coverslips were subjected to a differential staining procedure as described previously (10, 24) . In brief, fixed cells were incubated successively with an anti-LPS mAb and a protein A-gold conjugate. The gold was enhanced by silver-staining to visualize extracellular bacteria, after which cells and intracellular bacteria were stained with 0.005% crystalviolet in H 2 O for 10 min.
