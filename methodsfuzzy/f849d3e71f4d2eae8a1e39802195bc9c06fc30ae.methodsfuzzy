Sputum samples were collected from each patient in the hospital. The samples were subsequently divided into two aliquots and stored at − 80°C until required for the assay. Nucleic acids were extracted from 200-µL samples using the cador Pathogen 96 QIAcube HT Kit (Qiagen) for automated viral DNA and RNA extraction with the QIAcube HT System. The samples were tested individually by qRT-PCR using specific primers and probes targeting different genomes according to our previously reported qRT-PCR methods [18] . The qRT-PCR assays were used to detect 16 different respiratory viruses: CoV (229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1), PIV1-4, IV types A and B, RSV types A and B, HRV/EV, HMPV, human adenovirus (ADV), and human bocavirus (HBoV). We summarized and compared surgical patients demographic data between respiratory virus-positive and virus-negative groups using chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables, as appropriate. We used Student-Newman-Keuls test to assess whether there were statistical differences in the Ct values of different respiratory viruses between mild symptomatic and asymptomatic PSPs. For categorical variables, such as age group and gender, we used Fisher's exact test, ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U test to compare the differences across each categorical variable with respect to positivity. Each virus detected was counted individually. For example, in the case of co-detection of HRV and PIV3, detection of each virus was considered positive in separate HRV and PIV3 prevalence calculations.
