Cell culture. INS-1 insulinoma cells were a gift from Professor Liu Yong (Shanghai Institutes for Biological Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China), which were originally supplied by Dr Claes Wollheim, University Medical Center (Geneva, Switzerland). The culture medium consisted of RPMI-1640 (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) with 11.1 mmol/l D-glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin (both from Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Technology, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), 10 mmol/l HEPES, 2 mmol/l L-glutamine, 1 mmol/l sodium pyruvate and 50 µmol/l mercaptoethanol, in 5% CO 2 at 37˚C. To determine the effect of H 2 O 2 , INS-1 cells were grown for 48 h and subsequently incubated under basal conditions or in the presence of either 10 -8 mol/l Ang (1-7) (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 -6 mol/l A779 (Sigma-Aldrich) or Ang (1-7) and A779 together, for 2 h. H 2 O 2 at a final concentration of 250 µM was added in the final 15 min. Untreated cells served as a control. The cell supernatant was rapidly removed and rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Hyclone). Insulin secretion was determined at 16.7 mM glucose KRBB and insulin levels were measured using an insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Intracellular Ca 2+ measurement. INS-1 cells were loaded with 5 µmol/l Fluo-3AM (Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA) in a 40-min incubation at 37˚C in 3.3 mmol/l KRBB following pretreatment with Ang (1-7) or A779 for 2 h and then, in the last 15 min, H 2 O 2 was added at a 250-µM concentration. Cellular Ca 2+ signaling was determined with confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP5; Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Images were collected using 488 nm excitation (em) and the emission (em) was determined at >505 nm. ROS determination. INS-1 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 in 6-well plates for 48 h, followed by incubation with Ang (1-7) or A779 for 2 h, then a concentration of 250 µM H 2 O 2 was added in the last 15 min. Cells were loaded with 5 µmol/l dihydroethidium (DHE) ROS (Vigorous Biotechnology Co., Ltd.; Beijing, China) detection and suspended in PBS for 20 min at 37˚C in the dark. The cells were rinsed twice in PBS and collected with 0.05% trypsin (Hyclone; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Logan, UT, USA). Following centrifugation at 140 x g for 5 min, pellets were resuspended in 500 µl PBS. ROS was determined using intracellular ROS capture DHE with flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Briefly, an ex wavelength of 480-535 nm was used to determine em >590-610 nm. Cells were then divided into two subgroups: ROS-negative cells, which exhibit a very low fluorescence intensity and ROS-positive cells, which emit red fluorescence. Ten-thousand events per sample were collected. MMP. MMP was assessed using JC-1 (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) in INS-1 cells. Cells grown in 6-well plates were incubated with 1 ml JC-1 (2 mg/ml) for 20 min at 37˚C. The cells were centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 5 min, while the pellets were resuspended in 500 µl PBS. Carbonyl cyanide M-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology), a mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitor, served as a positive control. CCCP (10 M) was added to the cells for 20 min. In total, 10,000 cells from each well were analyzed by flow cytometry (ex, 490 nm, em, 590 nm). Color change from green to red indicated an increase in the MMP or the improvement of mitochondrial function. Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (http://www.graphpad.com/), and data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean. One-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's or Dunnett's tests were used to compare all groups or selected groups to the control and P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
