All infants under one year of age in Southmead Hospital and Bristol Children's Hospital who had respiratory infections during a period covering two winters (Nov. 1, 1965, to July 2, 1966 , and Sept. 10, 1966, to April 30, 1967) were included. 360 had respiratory infections on admission and 17 developed respiratory infections in hospital. Soon after admission (or onset) nose and throat swabs were taken by one of us (J. W. J.) from each infant. The throat swabs were taken with a gagging technique, so that the infants coughed over the swab. At the same time blood was taken from most of the mothers. Paired serum samples were obtained from some of the infants with an interval of [4] [5] [6] weeks.
