Preparation of SARS-CoV M pro , M +A(-1) pro and APE SARS-CoV M +A(-1) pro was cloned, over-expressed and purified as described. 24 A clone expressing M pro was Figure 10 . C α traces showing the orientations of domain III of the previously reported structures of SARS-CoV M pro in space group P2 1 at pH 6.0 (red), 7.6 (yellow) and 8.0 (blue) 25 , and the structure of M pro in space group P2 1 at pH 6.0 reported here (green). Domain III of both independent protomers rotates as pH increases from 6.0 to 8.0. generated using oligonucleotide-directed evolution to delete the codon corresponding to the N-terminal Ala of M +A (-1) pro . Using this clone, M pro was over-expressed and purified essentially as described for M +A (-1) pro . Cbz-Leu-Phe-AGln-(S,S)EP-COOEt was synthesized using the methods established to synthesize other APEs 30,32,33 with minor modifications. Crystallization, crystal soaking and cryo-protection Before crystallization, both SARS-CoV M pro and M +A(-1) pro were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM NaCl and concentrated to 10 mg/ml. All crystals were grown at ambient temperature by the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method. For the P2 1 crystals, the reservoir solution contained 0.1 M Mes (pH 6.0), 2% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 20,000, 3% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. The final crystallization drop contained equal amounts of the M pro solution and the reservoir solution. Crystals of a thick-plate habit grew in three to five days to a size of about 0.3 mm × 0.3 mm × 0.1 mm. For the P4 3 2 1 2 crystals, the growth conditions were the same as those for the P2 1 2 1 2 1 crystals; 29 the reservoir solution contained 0.1 M Mes (pH 6.5), 50 mM ammonium acetate, 6% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 3% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. The drop contained equal amounts of the M +A(-1) pro solution and the reservoir solution. Bipyrimidal crystals grew in three to five days to a size of about 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm. Macroseeding was carried out to improve the quality of the crystals. Crystals of good quality were selected and soaked overnight in drops having the same compositions as their reservoir solutions plus the APE chosen for this study present at 3 mM. Cryoprotectants had essentially the same compositions as reservoir solutions, except for the inclusion of 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol and the exclusion of dimethyl sulfoxide and dithiothreitol. Crystals were soaked for about 10 s and then immediately shock-cooled in liquid nitrogen for storage and shipment to the synchrotron beamline. Data collection and processing, structure solution, refinement and analysis The X-ray diffraction data from all crystals were collected at the synchrotron Beamline 8.3.1 (equipped with an ADSC-Q210 CCD detector) at the Advanced Light Source in the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. All data sets were indexed, scaled and merged using DENZO and SCALEPACK. 44 Structure solution and refinement were carried out in CCP4. 45, 46 All structures were solved by the molecular replacement method using MOLREP, 47 with the structure of unbound SARS-CoV M pro in space group C2 (PDB accession code 2A5A) being used as the search model. 29 In the structure of the M +A(-1) pro :APE complex, APE was located as outstanding electron densities in the substrate-binding region of M +A(-1) pro in both the |F o |-|F c |,α c (contoured at 3σ and 4σ) and the 2|F o |-|F c |,α c (contoured at 1σ) maps. A restraint was applied to the covalent bond between the Cys145 S γ atom of M +A(-1) pro and the epoxide C3 atom of the APE, on the basis that the length of a C-S single bond is normally about 1.8 Å. All structures were then iteratively refined using REFMAC, 48 and manually adjusted when needed using XtalView/Xfit. 49 The stereochemical qualities of the final structures were assessed using PROCHECK. 50 Graphical representations of the structures were prepared using PyMOL ‡. Superimpositions of the various structures were carried out using ALIGN, 51,52 based on the main-chain atoms (amide N, C α , and carbonyl C and O). The surface areas of the structures were calculated using NACCESS § Dimer interactions and M +A(-1) pro :APE interactions were analyzed using DIMPLOT' 53 and LIGPLOT, 53 respectively.
