Four multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays were developed for the simultaneous detection of 1. influenza A, influenza B, and hMPV; 2. RSV A, RSV B, and rhinovirus; 3. parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3; 4. coronavirus 229E, OC43, and NL63. Each triplex real-time RT-PCR assay was initially assessed using positive controls and compared to the previous duplicate or single target format. Triplex assays were then compared to panels of tissue culture and DIF and/or nested RT-PCR positive samples (where available). To determine whether mixed infections would reduce triplex sensitivity end point dilutions of each viral target were tested in both a single target and a pooled target (containing 10 different viral targets at the same endpoint dilution) format.
