For clinical patient data, serum IL-6 levels were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test (a = 0.05). BLR analysis was employed to predict the probability of critical care admission and death as a function of IL-6 (log 10 IL-6 (pg/mL)) levels, adjusted by age and sex. Both age and sex were identified as confounding variables when investigating the relationship between IL-6 levels and disease severity. Adjustment was performed by incorporating age and sex as predictors in the logistic regression model, thereby minimizing the confounding effect of these variables. The Student's t-test (a = 0.05) was used to identify statistically significant increases in expression of genes assayed by qRT-PCR. Survival curves were compared by the logrank test (a = 0.05) [43] . Comparisons of weight loss, viral load, gene fold change in expression, and cytokine expression were also made using the Student's t-test (a = 0.05). All Student's t-tests assumed two-tailed distributions and two-sample unequal variances. [27, 28] was applied to all differentially expressed genes for classification. Gene Ontology Biological Process pathway GO:0002526 -acute inflammatory response was selected as a suitable representation of genes implicated in the acute phase response. Fold changes in expression are expressed in log 2 . day 0 values normalized to 0. (DOC)
