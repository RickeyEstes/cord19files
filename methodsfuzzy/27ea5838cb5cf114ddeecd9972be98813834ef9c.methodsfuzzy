Data on human cases with H7N9 and H5N1 virus infections. The data regarding all laboratory-confirmed cases infected with avian influenza A (H7N9) and (H5N1) in China from 2003 to 2014 were collected from the World Health Organization 23 , and the consistency with the data from Health Map (http://www.healthmap.org/ zh/) and Flu Trackers (https://flutrackers.com/forum/) was checked to ensure data quality and reliability. The date of onset, age, gender and location of each confirmed patient was extracted and used in this study. The definitions of H5N1 and H7N9 human infections have been described as previously 15, 24 . As in previous studies 14, 15, 22 , each confirmed case was geo-referenced and linked to a digital map of China according to each patient's residence at the time of symptom onset using GIS technologies. Monthly cumulative numbers of cases based on their symptom onset dates were plotted over time to display the temporal trend of the epidemics caused by the two viruses.
