As indicated by the review in the previous section, a CFD model can be an effective tool for studying the jet flow from a gasper with complex geometry. However, the CFD model should be validated by experimental data, as such a model normally uses a large number of approximations and assumptions. To calculate the gasper-induced jet flow, this study used the shear stress transport (SST) k − ω model [34, 22] , because it has the best performance among the commonly used turbulence models in modeling a stratified jet [31] . According to Patankar [27] and White and Corfield [35] , the transport equations for momentum, k, and ω can be expressed in a general form: ∂ ∂t where the general variable , the source term S , and the coefficient of effective diffusion ,eff of the k − ω model are summarized in Table 1 ANSYS 2011. No energy equation was solved because both the experiment and the CFD simulation were conducted under isothermal conditions. The SIMPLE scheme was used for coupling the pressure and velocity equations. The second-order discretization method was used for the pressure, momentum, turbulent kinetic energy, and specific dissipation rate equations. This investigation assumed that the calculation was converged when the residuals of the continuity, u x , x y , u z , k, and ω in Eq. (1) decreased to 3.1 × 10 −8 , 2.3 × 10 −7 , 2.3 × 10 −7 , 4.2 × 10 −7 , 1.1 × 10 −6 , and 1.6 × 10 −5 , respectively. This investigation used the ANSYS Fluent program V14.0 [3] to perform the numerical calculations. To accurately model the gasper-induced airflow, it was necessary to implement the detailed geometry of the gasper in the CFD model. Fig. 2 (a) is a photograph of the actual gasper installed in the cockpit of an MD-82 commercial airliner. In the present study, we built a CAD model for the gasper with detailed geometry as shown in Fig. 2 (b). When the gasper was switched on, conditioned air was discharged through the annular opening (indicated in red in Fig. 2(b) ). There was a solid cone inside the rotatable switch. To model the case measured by Dai et al. [8] , this study placed the gasper model (nozzle diameter D = 12.6 mm) into a cylindrical calculation domain with a diameter of 500 mm (40D) and a length of 600 mm (48D), as shown in Fig. 3 . According to Fan et al. [9] , this dimension is large enough for simulating a free jet. Since the geometry in this case was symmetric, one quarter of the geometry was used to construct the computation domain, as shown in Fig. 3 (a). The plane z = 0 was defined on the edge of the gasper's rotatable switch (Figs. 2b and 3a). The velocity inlet boundary was set at the gasper outlet (the red area in Fig. 2b ). The side and bottom boundaries of the calculation domain were defined as the pressure outlet, and standard atmospheric pressure was prescribed. A symmetry (zero-shear, no normal velocities) boundary was used for the two symmetric faces. All other boundaries were defined as no-slip wall boundaries. Independence tests were conducted to determine the size of the calculation domain. It was found that enlarging the domain to a cylinder with a length of 900 mm and diameter of 750 mm did not lead to a noticeable difference in simulation results. Hence, this further verified that the originally proposed size of the calculation domain was sufficient to provide accurate results for the gasper-induced jet flow. Fig. 4 shows the grid structure used in this study, where the grid sizes were non-uniform. The smallest meshes were used around the gasper nozzle (0.12 mm), and the mesh size gradually increased with distance from the gasper. A grid independence test was conducted by comparing the velocity profile along the jet direction with three different grid numbers (444,565, 1,445,920, and 2,914,101). As shown in Fig. 5 , the resolution of 1,445,920 was sufficient for obtaining a grid-independent result for the velocity profile. In the present study, three modeling methods (CFD, empirical equations, and the virtual origin model) were used to investigate the flow characteristics of a gasper-induced jet. The predicting ability and prediction time of the three methods are summarized and evaluated in Table 3 , where stars have been used to rate prediction accuracy and solution time. Overall, the CFD method yielded the most accurate results, and it was able to predict additional flow features such as pressure and turbulence intensity. However, this method required a significant amount of time for setup and numerical computation. The empirical equations also provided good predictions of velocity, as well as predicting the entrainment ratio in the developed region, although this method was not able to predict other flow features. The virtual origin model was the simplest and thus the least time-consuming method, and it was capable of predicting velocity and entrainment ratio in most parts of the gasper-induced jet region. Generally speaking, the CFD method is recommended when other flow features are needed in addition to velocity, whereas the virtual origin model is recommended when only velocity or entrainment information in the downstream region of a gasper-induced jet is required.
