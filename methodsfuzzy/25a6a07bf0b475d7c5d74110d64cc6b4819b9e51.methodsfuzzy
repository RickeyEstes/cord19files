Guinea pigs have been used in research for over 200 years, and the term 'guinea pig' has become a synonym for 'experimental subject.' Their gentle temperament, commercial availability, and extensive historical use as a research model make them useful as research subjects. However, their use has declined sharply in recent decades. Approximately 191,000 were used in 2013 in biomedical research and teaching in the United States (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 2010), which is down from a high of 599,000 animals in 1985. Publications of research using guinea pigs have decreased from approximately 3500 per year in the 1980s to fewer than 1000 publications in 2011 (MEDLINE) . Compared with other rodent models, they more closely model human vitamin C metabolism and some immunological responses, for example, airway reactivity in asthma. However, they have largely been overshadowed by rats and mice, which have a shorter life cycle, larger litters, have been successfully genetically modified, and are subject to fewer regulations in the United States. The guinea pig was the first laboratory animal species derived and maintained in an axenic state (Wagner and Foster, 1976) . Guinea pigs have been used in a variety of studies, including anaphylaxis, asthma, delayed hypersensitivity, genetics, gnotobiotics, immunology, infectious disease, nutrition, otology, and pharmacology, and for research in space (Gray, 1998) . They are used by the pharmaceutical industry for preclinical testing of cardiac safety of new drugs, and hairless guinea pigs are used for development and testing of topical drug preparations (Hauser et al., 2005.) Guinea pigs are also used extensively in the medical device industry for sensitivity testing (e.g., Beuhler and Kligman tests), and as a source of serum complement in laboratories using the complement fixation test to diagnose infectious disease. Although guinea pigs are docile and easy to handle, their lack of a tail and their thick skin make blood collection relatively challenging compared with collection from rats and mice. Small volumes (e.g., 100 Î¼l) can be collected by jugular, saphenous, or cephalic venipuncture. Collection of more than a few drops of blood generally requires techniques that require anesthesia, e.g., retro-orbital bleeding, cranial vena cava puncture, or terminal cardiac puncture. Guinea pigs are also challenging to intubate or to dose orally due to their unique pharyngeal anatomy; an elongated soft palate covers the back of the throat, leaving only the small palatal ostium for access to the trachea and esophagus.
