A computer program has been developed to identify all putative H-type pseudoknots within any given RNA sequence (Bioinformation, in press). Figure 1 (a) shows a linear presentation of the sequence elements of a typical H-type pseudoknot, which requires that both helical stems (S1 and S2) can form simultaneously. If a given RNA sequence contains two pairs of complementary stretches (S1-5 complementary to S1-3 and S2-5 complementary to S2-3 ) G-U is considered a legitimate basepair separated by two or three connecting unpaired regions (L1, L2, and optionally L3) with a sequential arrangement as shown in Figure 1 (a), then an H-type pseudoknot can potentially form within this sequence. The computer program tests all possible combinations of stem and loop lengths within certain ranges to see whether the pseudoknotforming criteria can be met. The ranges for the lengths of the stems and loops can be set by the user. The default ranges are as follows: S1 has 5 to 20 base pairs; S2 has 5 to 20 base pairs; L1 has 1 to 10 nucleotides; L2 has 3 to 50 nucleotides, and L3 has 0 to 10 nucleotides. In order to compare the relative thermodynamic stability and mechanical strength of the identified pseudoknots within a given mRNA sequence, we implemented free energy (Δ ∘ 37 ) calculation for the two helical stems S1 and S2. In calculating the free energy, the Turner's nearest-neighbor parameters are used [41] . If L3 = 0, the two stems are taken as a continuous helical stem for the calculation but only half of the value is given to the S1-S2 stack to account for the quasicontinuous nature of the stacked stems. If an L3 is present, the free energy is calculated as a sum of the energies of the two individual stems. Although this simplified free energy calculation should only be viewed as semi quantitative, it provides a reasonable estimation of the relative stability of the detected pseudoknots, which are ranked according to the calculated free energies. The calculated free energy value is also used as a criterion to discard those pseudoknots with less stable stems. By default, only those pseudoknots with a free energy value lower than −18 kcal/mol are kept for further analysis. The output file of the program contains information about whether pseudoknots are found and how many are found; the detected pseudoknots are then listed in the order of calculated free energy of the stems. For each of the detected pseudoknots, the following information is given: lengths of S1, S2, L1, L2, and L3; free energy value of the stems; size and location of the pseudoknot. A schematic diagram is then drawn showing the actual pseudoknot forming sequence and base pairing of the two stems; a sequence of 20 nucleotides immediately 5 -to the pseudoknot is also shown because frameshift or readthrough pseudoknots usually appear several nucleotides downstream of the frameshift or readthrough sites (see Supplementary File 1, for an example output file in Supplementary Materials available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/984028).
