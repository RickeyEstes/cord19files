A review of the literature for urine and saliva samples for diagnostic of CHIK, dengue, Ebola, WN, Zika, YF, SARS and MERS was performed using the electronic database PubMed. The period for searches was 1 st January 1980 -26 th August 2016. Appropriate articles were selected according to their abstracts and further reviewed for reason for diagnostic analysis, sample types used and the methods applied for diagnosis focusing on saliva and urine as test samples. Search profile used for this review in PubMed for CHIK as an example: " Another 42 references were considered for analysing the preparation and storage of diagnostic samples as demonstrated in Table 1 , see Additional file 1 for detailed methodology. The literature research revealed 711 papers, of which we considered 128 in this study (Additional file 1: Figure  S1 ). Furthermore 43 publication analysing the sample processing and preparation were included. Our analysis shows that there should be put more emphasis on non-invasive sampling to disclose more easy alternatives for collecting human samples for clinical and routine investigations. The present review provides some indications that non-invasive sampling offers a promising alternative for routine diagnostic as well as a favourable diagnostic approach for surveillance studies with high numbers of samples. The review provides an overview of the usability of non-invasive sample for diagnostics of emerging viruses and tries to give recommendation on how this experience could be helpful for future possible outbreaks of emerging viruses.
