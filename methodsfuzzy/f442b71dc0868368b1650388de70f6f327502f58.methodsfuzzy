The CFD method has been widely used to predict airflow and pollutant dispersion in and around buildings (e.g. Blocken et al., 2008) . In order to investigate the airflow characteristics and pollutant dispersion around residential buildings, Fluent 13.3 is used to predict the flow pollutant concentration fields in and around buildings. A modified, non-standard k-ε turbulence model, which offers a good compromise between accuracy and numerical cost, is applied (Montazeri and Blocken, 2013; Tominaga and Stathopoulos, 2007; Hargreaves and Wright, 2007) . The time-averaged governing equation for an incompressible fluid can be written in the general form as Eq. (1) below: where u (m/s) is the velocity vector; φ stands for each of the velocity components, u (m/s), v (m/s), w (m/s), turbulent kinetic energy k (m 2 /s 2 ), turbulent dissipation rate ε (m 2 /s 3 ), and specious concentration c (g/m 3 ); Г Φ is the diffusion coefficient for each dependent variable φ; and S φ is the source term. The standard k-ε model is a semi-empirical model based on the model equations for turbulence kinetic energy (k) and its dissipation rate (ε). The turbulent viscosity, μ t , is computed by combining k and ε as follows: where, ρ (kg/m 3 ) is the fluid density and C μ is a model constant equal to 0.085. In the derivation of the standard k-ε model, the assumption is that the flow is fully turbulent, and the effects of molecular viscosity are negligible. The re-normalization group (RNG) k-ε model provides better predictions of flow field than the standard k-ε model, partially due to the term R ε added to the ε equation, which improves the accuracy for swirling flow. In the ε equation, the added term R ε is given by the equation below: where, η¼Sk/ε, η 0 and β are constants equal to 4.38 and 0.015, respectively. A tracer gas, CO 2 (carbon dioxide), is used to represent the pollutant and track its dispersion. The Species Transport model (Fluent, 2010a (Fluent, , 2010b can predict the local mass fraction of each species. The Turbulent Schmidt number (Sc t ) is defined as the ratio of turbulent momentum diffusivity (eddy viscosity) (V t ) and turbulent mass diffusivity (D t ) (Sc t ¼ V t /D t ). It is very important to solve the transport mass equation of the RANS model in CFD (Tominaga and Stathopoulos, 2007) . Depending on the flow problem, the Sc t value is usually treated as a constant ranging from 0.2 to 1.3 Blocken et al., 2008; Hang et al., 2012) . Previous studies employing the RNG model used the default number of Sc t in Fluent (2010a), namely 0.7 , found that the numerical results have a good agreement with the experimental results. All simulations in this study set the Sc t at 0.7.
