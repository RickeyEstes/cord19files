The origin of the IBV strains as well as the procedures used for the cloning and sequencing of the peplomer genes have been published previously 3'11'15. Sequence data were processed using the programs of Microgenic (Beckman Instruments, Ref. 16) . Phylogenetic trees were derived from nucleotide difference-matrices using the program of Dr J. Felsenstein (University of Seattle) distributed as part of the PHYLIP package 2.617.
