Hedonic price modelling is applied in this study. It is a technique which studies the demand side of housing with the assumption that a property is sold as a package of inherent attributes (Rosen, 1974) . It is assumed that the market is under pure and perfect competition. House prices for dwelling units are determined by the consumers' evaluations of a bundle of attributes. In fact, hedonic prices are the implicit values for the characteristics of the housing unit. The hedonic price model was first employed by Griliches in the studying of fixed assets in 1971. This technique was widely used in housing studies exploring the effect of different attributes on housing prices such as: accessibility to work, school and facilities; socio-economic characteristics of neighbourhood; environmental externalities; and racial discrimination, and so on. The data employed in this research were obtained from the EPRC Limited which has established a database recording all the property transaction data registered with the Land Registry of the HKSAR Government since 1991. The EPRC Limited provides online access to this database for the subscribed users. It is an authoritative database because it has secured a market share of over 95% for such services. It is obvious that transport accessibility has a significant influence on housing prices. In the Hong Kong context, proximity to Mass Transit Railway (MTR) station is known to create a premium on housing price. In order to control the effect of location-related variables, this study has assembled property transaction records from the mass housing projects located within the 'captured zones' of a 500 m radius (around 15 min walking distance) from the nearest MTR Station on Hong Kong Island. A total sample of 528 transaction records has been randomly taken from the actual property transaction records during the second quarter of 2005. This was considered as a relatively stable market after the outbreak of SARS. The selection of data helps control the undue influence of accessibility advantage and market sentiment on housing prices and enables the analysis to focus more specifically on the effect of space distribution of housing unit. Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the data and explains the key variables included in this analysis. In the first analysis, the NFA and the GFA are applied in two separate models: MODEL_NET (using NFA as independent variable) and MODEL_GROSS (using GFA as independent variable). In Hong Kong, housing unit is sold in terms of the gross price per square foot (selling price divided by the GFA). However, it is argued that house buyers are more sensitive to NFA rather than GFA. We hypothesize that home buyers are more willing to pay for a housing unit with a higher NFA, ceteris paribus. When they buy the housing units, they will perceive NFA as one of their preferences but not the GFA, as most developers only provide data on GFA and some calculations of the GFA are ambiguous. Therefore, in the first analysis, GFA and NFA are applied as independent variable, respectively, in two separate models (MODEL_NET and MODEL_GROSS) with the same combination of other variables. This shows the impacts made by GFA and NFA separately on the housing price. By comparing these two models, we are able to compare the coefficients of GFA and NFA, and to determine whether internal space is a better estimator of housing prices. In the subsequent analysis, we will examine how different attributes of floor area provision may affect housing prices. These attributes include the different levels of total shared space, the amount of 'desirable' shared space such as clubhouse and the possible exaggeration of internal floor space. Table 1 . The housing attributes are mainly classified into three categories: physical, neighbourhood, and environmental. The numerically measurable attributes which are quantitative in nature, such as size, age, floor, and distance. Dummy variables are applied in the analysis. The dummy variable method is used to deal with the qualitative variables. In this analysis, a particular condition was classified as either ''available'' or ''not available'', coded with ''1'' for available and ''0'' otherwise. Desirable attributes include access to park and clubhouse. Undesirable attributes include whether industrial land use exists within a radius of 200 m of the subject housing unit. A binary variable of value ''1'' is coded for existing and ''0'' otherwise. View is considered as one of the openness features and influences the quality of the living environment. Therefore, in this research, instead of defining a dummy variable of possessing sea view, three dummies are applied in this analysis. There are four categories of view: (1) poor view; (2) normal view; (3) good view; and (4) excellent view. In order to avoid dummy variable trap, three dummy variables of view are applied in the models: (1) NOR_VIEW (normal view-coded with ''1'' if the unit is possessing building view, inner street view, school view and podium view; ''0'' otherwise); (2) GD_VIEW (good view-coded with ''1'' if the unit is possessing garden view, mountain view, and swimming pool view); (3) EX_VIEW (excellent view-coded with ''1'' if the unit is possessing sea view). The poor view (unit possessing industrial building, old building, and elevated road) is kept as the control group. In the first analysis, we estimate the models MODEL_NET and MODEL_GROSS using the ordinary leastsquares technique (OLS) in the following equations: MODEL_NET
