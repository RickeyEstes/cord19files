Choosing optimal test(s) depends on the virus being sought, the clinical setting, specimen type, availability of kits, reagents and equipment, experience of laboratory personnel, and cost. Antigen detection methods offer the following advantages: (1) noncritical specimen collection and transport conditions; (2) ability to detect viruses that cannot be cultivated easily; (3) no need for cell culture equipment and highly trained personnel; (4) superior sensitivity compared with culture for certain viruses; and (5) rapid turnaround time (usually within hours). Disadvantages include: (1) lack of available test kits for many clinically important viruses; (2) inferior sensitivity compared with isolation for many cultivatable viruses; and (3) inferior specificity due to nonspecific/cross-reactions particularly with the use of polyclonal antibodies. Culture is preferred when results are available quickly with the shell vial centrifugation and staining methods (e.g., HSV, CMV, and VZV). Advantages of isolation include: (1) ability to recover a broad range of viruses; (2) availability of the infectious agent for further characterization; (3) 100% specificity; and (4) superior sensitivity compared with antigen detection for some viruses. Disadvantages include: (1) requirement for specialized equipment, supplies, and trained personnel; (2) longer turnaround time; (3) the lability of certain viruses under suboptimal collection and transport conditions; and (4) the inability to culture many clinically relevant viruses. The use of NAATs is rapidly replacing older viral diagnostic methods due to their rapid turnaround time, superior sensitivity, and the ability to quantify virus density. A number of relatively simple home-brew and commercially available NAATs (including analyte-specific and for research use only) are available for a wide variety of viruses. 34, 35 Serologic Methods Serologic methods can be used to diagnose a current or recent acute infection, to determine specific susceptibility or immunity, and for epidemiologic and surveillance purposes. Interpretation of serologic results is virus-specific (e.g., the presence of HIV antibodies indicates current infection, whereas the presence of IgG anti-rubella indicates immunity as a result of immunization or recovery from natural infection). Serologic diagnosis of acute infection is more useful when the incubation period is prolonged (e.g., 3 to 6 weeks) and antibody is present in serum concomitantly with signs of illness (e.g., EBV and CMV mononucleosis). Figure 287 -1 shows a typical antibody response for an acute, moderate-incubation (several days to 2 weeks) viral illness such as measles. At the onset of rash or other manifestations, antibody is undetectable or is present at low titer. Within 10 to 14 days, appreciable titers of antibody are present. For short-incubation virus infections (e.g., respiratory viruses), a rise in antibody usually does not occur until the late recovery phase or during convalescence and has no value for acute diagnosis. With the use of older serologic methods such as hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and complement fixation (CF) that detect IgG antibody, a >4-fold rise in titer based on serial dilution endpoints between acute and before a diagnosis can be confirmed with short-incubation infections. Because of the many confounding factors (e.g., passive transfer of antibodies from mother to infant, receipt of immunoglobulin, immunocompromised) serologic results always should be interpreted within the context of the clinical situation. Whenever possible, serologic diagnosis should be confirmed with the use of viral isolation or direct detection of virus antigens or nucleic acids. Depending on the serologic assay, either serum and/or plasma can be used. The use of other specimen types has not been well validated for most viruses. Some exceptions include the use of saliva for the detection of HIV antibodies and CSF in patients with viral central nervous system (CNS) disease. 52, 53 Optimal Tests for Specific Viruses Table 287 -2 lists the medically important viruses, major attributable diseases, optimal diagnostic specimen(s), available tests, and average time to a positive test result. For many tests, the time to obtain a result may be a function of the test itself (e.g., culture), the logistics of laboratory testing schedules, or the need to refer a sample to a reference lab. The preferred test provides the most rapid result with acceptable sensitivity (>90%) and specificity (>95%). Serologic tests remain the mainstay for diagnosis of certain virus infections such as the hepatitis viruses. The preferred diagnostic test or tests can vary, depending on the patient population being tested (e.g., immunocompromised hosts). In the results summarized herein for individual viruses, assessment of sensitivity and specificity of different tests may be based on a variety of parameters and not simply comparison to culture alone. Tests for C. trachomatis can be grouped into four broad categories: serology, culture, direct detection, and molecular diagnosis. Serologic tests for C. trachomatis genital tract infections are not useful for diagnosis in individual patients. 226 Antibodies to C. trachomatis persist for life. In infants, detection of IgM anti-C. trachomatis using the microimmunofluorescence (MIF) test is the diagnostic test of choice for chlamydial pneumonia. 223 Maternal IgG antibodies can persist in infants for 6 to 9 months. 226 The MIF test is the most sensitive serologic test and is the only one that detects species-and serovar-specific responses. 223 EIAs for the detection of IgM antibodies in infants have variable performance compared with the MIF test. 226 EIAs detect antibodies to the genus-specific antigen, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of chlamydial elementary or reticulate bodies and are not specific for C. trachomatis. Interpretation of a single IgG antibody test result is difficult because 50% to 70% of people can have antibodies to C. pneumoniae. 234, 235 CF tests have been used widely for the diagnosis of psittacosis and lymphogranuloma venereum, but have no value in diagnosing genital tract or neonatal chlamydial infections. Cell culture has specificity approaching 100%; however it is relatively insensitive compared with NAATs, requires cell culture facilities, and has slow turnaround time (3 to 7 days). 223, 226 Barring evaluation using other testing methods, the CDC continues to recommend culture for urethral specimens from women and asymptomatic men, NP specimens from infants, rectal specimens from all patients, and vaginal specimens from prepubertal girls. 222 The shell vial culture method has improved the sensitivity and shortened the detection time (48 to 72 hours) of C. trachomatis inclusions. 226 Diagnosis most often is accomplished by direct detection of antigens (EIA or DFA assays) or nucleic acid (hybridization assays), or by cytologic examination for the presence of intracellular inclusions. EIAs use monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to detect chlamydial LPS and are suited for processing large numbers of specimens; sensitivity generally is less than culture and NAATs. A positive EIA usually requires validation by a second nonculture method, especially in low-prevalence populations. 227 Point-ofcare EIAs can provide a result in <30 minutes but their performance is poor and evidence regarding their impact on clinical outcomes is lacking. [236] [237] [238] DFA assays using monoclonal antibodies directed against the major outer-membrane protein (MOMP) permit direct visualization of the cellular material obtained (as an assessment of the quality of the specimen) and both elementary bodies and intracellular inclusions can be detected within 30 minutes. However, DFA testing requires a skilled laboratory microscopist, and large numbers of specimens cannot be processed expediently. [239] [240] [241] DFA has been used for conjunctival and respiratory specimens from infants. Nucleic acid probes are similar in sensitivity to other antigen detection methods and are relatively specific. However, DNA probe tests (without previous amplification) require special transport media, thus precluding the use of another test on the same specimen to confirm a positive result. DNA probe tests have a sensitivity for male genital secretions inferior to that of other methods. Cytologic examination of direct smears for the presence of intracellular inclusions is useful for detection of chlamydial conjunctivitis in neonates, but not for diagnosing conjunctivitis or genital infection in adolescents. 223 Congenital CMV infection is best diagnosed by isolating CMV from the urine of neonates within the first 3 weeks of life. Beyond 3 weeks of age, isolation of CMV from urine cannot distinguish congenital from perinatal or postnatal infection. IgM anti-CMV in a newborn is positive in only 50% to 70% of congenitally infected neonates and the test can yield false-positive results. 219 Congenital VZV infection can be diagnosed by serology. Perinatal or postnatal infection with VZV, as well as with HSV and enteroviruses, usually can be diagnosed by conventional antigen detection or culture techniques, although NAAT testing is preferred for enteroviruses. Serologic diagnosis of neonatal HSV infections is inappropriate because response may not be detectable for 2 or 3 weeks after infection. 220 Demonstration of rubella IgM in a neonate with features consistent with congenital rubella confirms the diagnosis; virus isolation can require 3 to 4 weeks. 218, 220, 221 Parvovirus infection during pregnancy can be diagnosed in the mother by serology; detection of IgM or rising IgG antibody level is diagnostic, whereas a stable IgG titer reflects past infection. In neonates, positive parvovirus B19 antibody at 8 to 12 months suggests infection. 218 Parvovirus B19 infection of a fetus with hydrops can be confirmed using NAAT for viral DNA in fetal blood, amniotic fluid cells, or both. 215, 221 CHLAMYDIA AND CHLAMYDOPHILA Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and C. psittaci cause disease in humans. Psittacosis, rare in children, is confirmed serologically. Culture previously was considered the gold standard because of its 100% specificity and excellent sensitivity when optimal techniques are used. 223 However, for genital specimens, its sensitivity is approximately 70% to 80% compared with NAATs, which have become the preferred tests for diagnosis of genital tract infections. 226 For cervical swab specimens, EIA and DFA are less sensitive than hybridization tests and NAATs, whereas NAATs provide the best specificity and positive predictive value. Rapid EIA tests have relatively poor sensitivity using urethral swabs from males and cervical swabs from females and their accuracy for other specimen types has not been well evaluated. 237, 238 Testing of first-void urine in men and women by any of the 3 NAATs has a median specificity of >97% and excellent sensitivity resulting in a high positive predictive value. 231 In infants with conjunctivitis or pneumonitis, testing of conjunctival and NP specimens by culture, DFA, or EIA produces acceptable results. In a study of children ≤13 years of age, SDA and TMA had a sensitivity of 100% for urine specimens and 85% for vaginal swabs. 244 In the same study, the sensitivity of vaginal swab cultures for C. trachomatis was only 39%. In cases of suspected rape or sexual abuse, recent studies and guidelines support the use of FDA-approved NAATs when culture is not available; a positive result is confirmed using a different NAAT. 222, 245 Chlamydophila pneumoniae Accurate laboratory confirmation of acute infection with C. pneumoniae is difficult and is most often based on serology. 246, 247 The MIF test appears to be the most reliable serologic test, and the following criteria for a positive test have been used: (1) >4-fold rise in titer; (2) IgM titer >1 : 16; or (3) IgG titer >1 : 512. IgG titers between 1 : 16 and 1 : 512 are considered evidence of previous, but not necessarily recent, infection. 235 However, the limitations of the MIF test are lack of standardization and availability of high-quality reagents, and inability to distinguish past from persistent infection. 248 Comparison of EIAs (using species-specific assays) to MIF have shown good sensitivity and specificity in children with respiratory tract diseases and control children. 249 Because some EIAs detect antibodies to LPS, these tests detect antibodies to all Chlamydia species. Due to the poor sensitivity, CF tests should not be used for diagnosis. 235, 250 Isolation of C. pneumoniae is difficult. The stability of C. pneumoniae in clinical specimens has not been well studied, although one study reported that 70% of organisms remain viable after 24 hours at 4°C. 226, 251 Throat swabs, sputum, NP, BAL, and other respiratory tract specimens placed in transport media have been used with variable success. Detection of the organism in respiratory secretions does not prove causality because asymptomatic infections occur in children and persistent shedding can occur for months after acute disease in adults. 252, 253 Additional problems of culture include: small numbers of organisms present in respiratory secretions, poor recovery unless special transport media and optimal transport and storage conditions are used, and limited availability. Molecular diagnosis with noncommercial conventional and real-time PCR tests has been evaluated. 254, 255 Sensitivities appear to be as good as culture, but specificity is difficult to determine given the lack of a gold standard for comparison.
