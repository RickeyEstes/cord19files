The study was conducted over a period of two years following the approval from the Institutional Review Board from the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India. There was no specific approval number assigned at that time. Informed patient consent was obtained prior to treatment. The selection of patients for the study was made from those attending the surgical emergency of our institute. Patients belonging to the age group of 16-40 years and having a fracture of the femoral shaft alone or associated with other skeletal injuries presenting within eight hours of injury were considered for inclusion. Patients with multisystem trauma (significant head, chest, and abdominal injury), open femoral fractures, pathological fractures, or those with preexisting cardiac or pulmonary disease or chronic smokers were excluded. After obtaining informed consent, 60 patients of either sex were randomly selected for the study. In all of these patients, after initial resuscitation and necessary splinting, appropriate imaging for all skeletal injuries was done. The investigations at the time of admission included a chest roentgenogram, arterial blood gas analysis (ABG), hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, serum biochemistry, blood glucose levels, serum lactate, and coagulation profile. The selected patients were put into one of the two groups depending upon their random allocation number. At the earliest possible time after admission to the hospital, the patients allocated to the Group I (n1=30) were given ciclesonide (640 mcg) with a metered dose inhaler. The steroid dose was repeated once again after 24 hours. Patients allocated to Group 2 (n2=30) were not given any steroids and were taken as controls for the study. All the patients, irrespective of the study group, were taken up for surgical stabilization of their fractures as per their conventional management protocol. repeated clinical evaluation, including four hourly vitals (pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and temperature) and 12 hourly ABG estimations for 72 hours. During these three days, once daily chest X-ray, hemogram, and coagulation profiles were taken. A note was made of any side effects of the inhalational steroids observed during the hospital admission period, e.g. oropharyngeal candidiasis, any alteration in serum biochemistry, or wound complications. The outcome was assessed by documentation of any episode of hypoxemia within the 72 hour observation period. The fat embolism index score of all the patients was calculated daily by a blind investigator, based on the Schonfeld, et al. criteria [5] . Petechiae was the most sensitive indicator for FES, followed by hypoxaemia with arterial oxygen partial pressure (pO2 ) lower than 60 mmHg and positive X-ray findings. Patients with subclinical FES were identified as those in whom the score was less than five, but there were episodes of hypoxia diagnosed on serial arterial blood gas estimations. For the diagnosis of subclinical hypoxemia, all patients were classified into six subgroups (three in the control and three in the trial group) according to their pO2 values. We considered hypoxaemia with any pO2 < 70 mmHg and classified all patients in three categories: severe hypoxaemia (pO2 < 60 mmHg), mild hypoxaemia (60 mmHg < pO2 < 70 mmHg), and normal (pO2 > 70 mmHg). The analysis was done by comparing the incidence of hypoxemia and FES in both groups to determine the effects of prophylactic doses of inhalational steroids. The statistical analysis was done using the 'Mann-Whitney test' for quantitative data and Chi-square test for qualitative data. A p-value less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
