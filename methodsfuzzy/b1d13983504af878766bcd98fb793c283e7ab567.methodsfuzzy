The animal experiments conformed fully to the Swedish Animal Ethical Committee's code S84/00. The inoculation model was performed as earlier described by Sapino et al. [20] with some slight modifications. The R3220AC rat mammary tumour cell line (clone-D; kindly provided by Prof. G. Bussolati, University of Turin, Italy) was cultured in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax I medium (GIBCOk, Invitrogen, Stockholm, Sweden) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum and plated in tissue culture flasks (Falcon Plastics, Los Angeles, CA) in a humidified 37 jC, 5% CO 2 incubator. When the cells reached approximately 80% confluence, they were collected by trypsin-EDTA treatment. Briefly the cellsheet was rinsed once with Ca 2 + -and Mg 2 + -free PBS and incubated for approximately 5 min at 37 jC in the presence of fresh trypsin-EDTA. After incubation the cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 for injection. Viability was determined for harvested cell batches using the trypan blue exclusion dye method. All cells used for this study showed >90% viability.
