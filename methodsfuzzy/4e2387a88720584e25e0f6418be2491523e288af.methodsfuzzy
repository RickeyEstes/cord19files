Cells, virus, and reagents VERO cells (ECACC, 84113001), were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC). Cells were grown at 37 Â°C with 5% CO 2 . Cells were starved by incubating in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS; Invitrogen, 14025-076) for the specified length of time. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the Beaudette Beau-R isolate, was provided by the Institute for Animal Health (IAH), Compton Laboratory. Constructs IBV NSP6-mCherry and MHV NSP6-mCherry have been described previously. 28 The adenovirus mammalian GFP-MAP1LC3B construct has been described previously. 37 Primary antibodies used for immunofluorescence were as follows: rabbit_anti-MAP1LC3B (Sigma L7543), mouse_anti-WIPI2 (Abcam, ab101985), mouse_ H4B4_anti-LAMP2 (Abcam ab25631), mouse_J2_anti-dsRNA (English and Scientific Consulting Bt. 10010200), guinea pig anti-SQSTM1/p62 (PROGEN Biotechnik, GP62-C).
