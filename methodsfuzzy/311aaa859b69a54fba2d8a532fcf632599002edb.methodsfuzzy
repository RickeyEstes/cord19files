Ethical authorization. Ethical authorization for the use of human samples was obtained from the Cameroon National Ethics Committee, Yaoundé. All human experiments were performed in accordance with the Ministry's National Ethics Committee guidelines. Sample collection and preparation. Human fecal samples were collected between February and September 2014, after informed consent was obtained from patients in two different hospitals (Lysoka Health District and Kumba District Hospital of the Southwest region of Cameroon). This region was chosen because here bats are hunted, sold, and eaten. Diarrheic patients and/or people who came into contact with bats directly (by eating, hunting, or handling) or indirectly (if a family member was directly exposed to bats) were eligible for sampling. A total of 221 samples were collected from subjects between age 0 and Ͻ3 years (age group A, 80 samples), 3 and Ͻ20 (age group B, 63 samples), 20 and Ͻ60 (age group C, 65 samples), and 60 and older (age group D, 13 samples). All the samples were from people who had symptoms of gastroenteritis, except 2 from age group C who had contact with bats. Samples were then placed into labeled tubes containing universal transport medium (UTM), placed on dry ice, and stored at Ϫ20°C, until being shipped to the Laboratory of Viral Metagenomics, Leuven, Belgium. The samples were stored at Ϫ80°C until used (63) . Fecal samples were first diluted using UTM, and equal volumes of the dilutions were pooled based on the location, age, and bat contact status (direct, indirect, or none). Each pool contained two to five samples, and for the different age groups (A to D) we had 22, 17, 20, and 4 pools, respectively . The pools were then treated according to the NetoVIR protocol (86) . Briefly, the pools (10% [wt/vol] fecal suspensions) were homogenized for 1 min at 3,000 rpm with a Minilys homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) and filtered using an 0.8-m PES filter (Sartorius). The filtrate was then treated with a cocktail of Benzonase (Novagen) and micrococcal nuclease (New England Biolabs) at 37°C for 2 h to digest free-floating nucleic acids. Total nucleic acids (both RNA and DNA) were extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions but without addition of carrier RNA to the lysis buffer. First-and second-strand synthesis and random PCR amplification for 17 cycles were performed using a slightly modified whole-transcriptome amplification (WTA2) kit procedure (Sigma-Aldrich). WTA2 products were purified with MSB Spin PCRapace spin columns (Stratec), and the libraries were prepared for Illumina sequencing using a slightly modified version of the Nextera XT library preparation kit (Illumina), which is described in detail in reference 86. Samples were pooled in an attempt to obtain an average of approximately 10 million paired-end reads per pool. Sequencing was performed on a NextSeq 500 high-output platform (Illumina) for 300 cycles (2 ϫ 150-bp paired ends). Genomic and phylogenetic analysis. NGS reads were analyzed as described in the work of Yinda et al. (20, 63) . Briefly, raw reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (parameters: HEADCROP: and FastUniq to remove identical reads. The de novo assembly or reads and annotation of reads were performed using SPAdes (with the meta flag) and Diamond (with the sensitive option using the GenBank nonredundant database), respectively (61, 87, 88) . Open reading frames (ORFs) of contigs of interest were identified and further analyzed for conserved motifs in the amino acid sequences using NCBI's conserved domain database (CDD) (89) . Nucleotide and amino acid alignments of viral sequences were done with MUSCLE implemented in MEGA7 (90) or MAFFT (91) . Substitution models were determined using ModelGenerator (92) , and phylogenetic trees were constructed using RAxML (93) , with the autoMRE flag, which enables a posteriori bootstrapping analysis. All trees were visualized in FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) and midpoint rooted for purposes of clarity. Phageome analysis. Contig annotation with DIAMOND is dependent on the accuracy of the database used, and in most databases, phages are poorly annotated. However, VirSorter uses a manually curated database of virus reference genomes augmented with metagenomic viral sequences sampled from freshwater, seawater, and human gut, lung, and saliva. Hence, for further identification of bacteriophages, scaffolds Ͼ1 kb were classified using VirSorter (decontamination mode [60] ). Only scaffolds assigned to categories 1 and 2 were considered bacteriophage contigs and were filtered for redundancy at 95% nucleotide identity over 70% of the length using Cluster Genomes (94) . Then, trimmed reads from each pool were mapped using Bowtie 2 (95) to the bacteriophage contigs, and the generated BAM files were filtered to remove reads that aligned at Ͻ95% identity using BamM (http://ecogenomics.github .io/BamM/). Abundance tables were obtained and normalized for total number of reads of each sample. For the richness comparison, Mann-Whitney tests were used, and for the clustering, an Adonis test was performed. All downstream analyses were done in R (96) using the vegan package (97) . Furthermore, to identify the potential corresponding bacterial host, a database of these contigs was made to which a nucleotide BLASTN search (100% identity without gaps) was performed using a fasta file of CRISPR sequences (98) as query. These sequences correspond to different bacterial hosts, and their presence in the phage genome highlight the potential host of the phage. To see if the phage community of these humans is related to those of the bats from the same locality, a visualization of the network of both human and bat phageomes was performed using vConTACT (62) . Initially, proteins were predicted using Prodigal (99) , and combined with the Viral RefSeq of archaeal and prokaryotic predicted proteins. A database was generated from the contigs of bat pools, human pools, and viral RefSeq proteins, and BLASTp was performed against the combined proteins. The output of blast was used to run vConTACT, and the output network was visualized in Cytoscape (100). Data availability. All sequences were deposited in GenBank under the following accession numbers: MH608285 to MH608287 and MH933752 to MH933860 (details in Table S3 ). Raw reads were submitted to the NCBI's Short Read Archive (SRA) under the project ID PRJNA491626.
