Antivenoms are produced from the plasma or serum collected from immunized horses or sheep. Plasma can be obtained by the centrifugation of whole blood or by apheresis. Plasma from several animals is typically pooled into 20e300 l batches and subjected to a fractionation process to isolate the IgG fraction. Following the initial use of crude equine immune serum, still reported to be manufactured by one producer [5] , various methods of IgG purification and refinement have been introduced ( Table 2 ). Most manufacturers use protocols derived from the basic method described by Pope [61, 62] , modified by Harms [63] , based on pepsin digestion at low pH, to obtain F(ab#) 2 fragments, followed by ammonium sulphate precipitation of antibody fragments [5, 64, 65] . This basic approach is combined with a number of additional steps, aimed at obtaining a purer [66] preparation, such as heat coagulation [64] and ion-exchange chromatography [66, 67] . The pH at which pepsin digestion is performed by various laboratories ranges between 3.1 and 3.8, at temperatures between 30 and 37 C. Pepsin digestion is usually performed in undiluted serum or plasma (protein concentration: 60e90 g/l). Incubation times range from 40 min to 24 h and with varying pepsin concentrations [64, 65, 67, 68] . Thermocoagulation is used by many laboratories and consists of heating at 55e56 C for 1 h [64, 65, 68] although not all methods involving pepsin digestion include heat coagulation [67] . Some fractionation protocols include an additional Table 2 Steps used for the manufacture of antivenoms Screening of production animals for adventitious agents Plasma collection (whole blood or apheresis) in bags or bottles Plasma thawing at room temperature Plasma pooling IgG/fragments purification process F(ab#) 2 : B pepsin digestion (acid pH) and ammonium sulphate precipitation, or B pepsin digestion (acid pH) and caprylic acid precipitation Fab: ammonium sulphate precipitation and papain digestion at pH 7e8 Whole IgG: B caprylic acid precipitation B ammonium sulphate precipitation IgG/fragments concentration: (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 /Na 2 SO 4 precipitation, ultrafiltration Polishing: ion exchange (removes Fc and further purifies IgGs/ fragments) Ultrafiltration Sterile filtration Aseptic filling Storage in the liquid state or lyophilisation acidification step to remove some non-IgG globulins ('euglobulins') which are unstable at acid pHs [66, 69] . One producer includes a bulk pasteurisation step in its antivenom production protocol [66] . Other manufacturers produce whole IgG antivenoms using either ammonium sulphate precipitation of IgG or caprylic acid precipitation of non-IgG proteins [69e71], followed by dialysis or ultrafiltration. Recently, a simple, one-step methodology based on caprylic acid precipitation has been described [72] . The conditions used for caprylic acid fractionation of equine plasma are as follows: plasma pH is adjusted to 5.8 and caprylic acid is added directly to this plasma to attain a final concentration of 5% (v/v). The mixture is stirred during caprylic acid addition and then for one additional hour, after which the precipitate is separated by filtration. Caprylic acid is then removed by either dialysis or ultrafiltration and the product is formulated before sterile filtration [72] . Some antivenoms are made of Fab antibody fragments, obtained by papain digestion of sheep IgG, at neutral pH, after sodium sulphate precipitation of IgG [73] . Affinity-chromatography or ion-exchange chromatography steps have been described in the production of some Fab antivenoms [74, 75] . Treatment with b-propiolactone has been evaluated to reduce complement activation by horse plasma-derived products [76] ; however, it does not appear to be used routinely in laboratories producing antivenoms. In addition to the differences in fractionation protocols, antivenoms made of whole IgG, F(ab#) 2 and Fab molecules greatly differ in their pharmacokinetic profiles [1, 77] . Most antivenoms come in liquid presentation, but some are lyophilized. The former need to be stored at 4e8 C, since higher temperatures reduce their shelf-life and induce protein denaturation and aggregate formation [78] . In contrast, lyophilized antivenoms can be stored at room temperature and have a more prolonged shelf-life. Most antivenoms contain preservatives to prevent bacterial contamination [5, 79] .
