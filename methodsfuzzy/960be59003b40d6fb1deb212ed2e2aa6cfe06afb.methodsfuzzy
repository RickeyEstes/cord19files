Between 1 July 1983 and 30 June 1984, 149 live weanling diarrheic rabbits were collected from 29 commercial rabbitries with between 60 and 400 does. In the rabbitries, New Zealand White or Dendermonde White rabbits were housed in wire cages and were fed ad libitum with a commercial pelleted ration containing 66 ppm robenidine as anticoccidial drug. Rabbits were weaned between 4 and 5 weeks of age. During each visit, one representative rabbit was taken from a cage of animals showing diarrhea for a maximum of 12 h without apparent signs of dehydration. None of the animals had been treated with antimicrobial drugs. Within 20 min after killing the animals, specimens of duodenum, midjejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, heart, liver and kidney were fixed in 10% (v/v) formalin in phosphate-buffered saline and processed routinely for paraffin sections. Sections were cut at 5 pm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin; some were stained with Warthin-Starry silver stain or with Gram's stain (Lee and Luna, 1960) . Selected formalin-fixed samples were washed overnight in distilled water and fixed in 2.5% (w/v) cacodylate buffered glutaraldehyde (pH 7.6), post-fixed with 1% ,(w/v) osmium tetra-oxide and block-stained with 2% uranyl acetate (w/v). Blocks were embedded in eppon 812. Ultra-thin sections were examined with a Philips 201 transmission electron microscope. Samples of cecal content were taken for parasitological, bacteriological and virological analyses. Smears were made for Gram's stain and other smears were stained with carbol-fuchsin for demonstration of cryptosporidia (Heine, 1981) . Cecal content was examined using the salt-flotation-concentration technique for demonstration of coccidia and helminths. Numbers of parasites were counted by the McMaster egg counting technique (MAFF, 1977) . Samples of cecal content were clarified by low speed centrifugation (8000 X g). The supernatants were negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate in bidistilled water and examined for the presence of viral particles by transmission electron microscopy. The presence of E. coil in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum and cecum was evaluated after streaking plates of G2SN medium with intestinal contents and incubating aerobically at 37°C for 18 h as described before (Peeters et al., 1984c) . Coliform colonies were identified by the method of Mac-Kenzie et al. (1948}. Isolation of C. spiroforme from cecal contents was done according to Borriello and Carman (1983) . When samples could not be examined immediately, they were stored at -20°C. Numbers of spores of C. spiroforme were evaluated after culture of 10-fold dilutions of cecal contents on Columbia base (Oxoid Ltd., London, England) 10% sheep blood agar plates. Strains were stored in Robertson's cooked meat medium (Southern Group Laboratories, Hithergreen, England) to await further identification. Presumptive C. spiroforme-isolates were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE} of outer membrane proteins and compared with those of the reference strain of C. spiroforme NCTC 11493 (Cato et al., 1982) . C. spiroforme isolates were tested for their ability to produce iota-like toxin in vitro by rocket immunoelectrophoresis (RIEF) of 48-h BHI peptone glucose salts culture filtrates against antiserum to C. spiroforme NCTC 11493 toxin (Carman et al., 1985) . Cecal contents were analysed for the presence of iota-like toxin by intraperitoneal administration of cecal filtrates to mice and neutralization by C. perfringens antitoxins (Wellcome Research Laboratories, Beckenham, Kent, England) as described elsewhere (Sterne and Batty, 1975) .
