(2016) . Molecular identification of human enteroviruses associated with aseptic meningitis in Yunnan province, Southwest China.  Construction of the Cas9/sgRNA library We constructed a focused Cas9/sgRNA library targeting 3,283 genes encoding human membrane proteins. This library consisted of 30,848 sgRNAs, among which 400 were non-targeting sgRNAs as negative controls. The sgRNA plasmid library was packaged in HEK293T cells after co-transfection with pMD2.G, a plasmid expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), and pCMVR8.74, a lentiviral packaging plasmid (Addgene), with the X-tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent (Roche). Supernatants were collected and filtered with a syringe filter with a 0.22 mm pore size. A single clone of RD cells stably expressing S. pyogenes cas9 (SpCas9) was constructed by transduction of a lentiviral vector expressing spCas9 and selection by blasticidin (Addgene #52962) (Sanjana et al., 2014) . The cleavage activity of Cas9 nuclease in this cell line was confirmed by T7E1 assays. RD-Cas9 cells were transduced with the packaged lentiviral sgRNA library at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.3, followed by a puromycin selection for $2 weeks (Peng et
