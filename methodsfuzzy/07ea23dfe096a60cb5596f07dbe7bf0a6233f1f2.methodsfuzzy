Through the period January, 1979-June, 1981, samples of specimens of stools sent to the laboratory from patients with a history of gastroenteritis or diarrhoea and vomiting were examined by electron microscopy, whether or not such examination was requested. Most of these specimens had been found to be negative for bacterial pathogens (shigella, campylobacter, and salmonella); however, for some of the others we do not know whether pathogenic bacteria were present. The methods used for faecal examination and for immune electron microscopy (IEM) have been described elsewhere. 2 2 Identification was based on demonstration of the characteristic morphological features of the Caliciviridae.2,3 When calicivirus particles were detected in a specimen a questionnaire restricted to a small number of features, to be indicated as present or absent, was sent to the clinician with the report. The age and sex of the patient and month when the specimen was collected were obtained from the request forms as these data were regarded as reliable.
