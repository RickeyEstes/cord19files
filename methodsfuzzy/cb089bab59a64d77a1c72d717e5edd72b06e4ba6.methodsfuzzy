The study was prospective and approved by the Institutional Review Board. Parents and children above the age of 7 years were fully informed, and they signed consent and assent forms, respectively. The study began 2/6/13 and was completed 1/21/14. Children between the ages of 1 and 16 years were enrolled by the authors at the Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo and in their private office outside of the hospital. All surgeries were performed at the Women and Children's Hospital Buffalo. The study was open to children undergoing surgical removal of adenoids and/or tonsils for various reasons, regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. The tonsils were removed by monopolar cautery by two the surgeons and by the microbipolar technique by the third surgeon. In contrast all three surgeons used curettage to remove the adenoids. Children with craniofacial abnormalities and bleeding disorders were excluded. Data recorded included date of birth, gender, height, weight, BMI, weights of tonsils and adenoids and reason for surgery. The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea or sleep disordered breathing was a clinical diagnosis; however, the degree of airway obstruction was estimated by the Brodsky scores for the tonsils and percentages of airway obstruction for adenoids. None of the children exhibited symptoms consistent with an acute respiratory illness at the time of surgery. Palatine tonsils or adenoids were obtained by the surgeons and forwarded to the Pathology Lab where they were weighted and stored at 2e8 C before being processed by the Virology Lab; all samples were processed in the Virology lab within 24 h of collection. Detection of adenovirus and EBV was initially performed in the Virology Laboratory at the Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo. PCR was performed on DNA extracts from the tonsil and adenoid samples using the ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time Taqman PCR System with adenovirus-specific primers (Life Technologies) and probes (eurofins MWG Operon). Primer-BLAST software was utilized to assure primer specificity. Concurrent testing for RNaseP confirmed extraction efficiency and the absence of PCR inhibitors. A previous adenovirus positive respiratory sample, confirmed by DFA (Diagnostic Hybrids D3 Ultra) was extracted and used as a positive control. A nasopharyngeal swab negative for adenovirus was extracted and used as a positive control for RNaseP activity and a negative control for virus assay. Samples were run in duplicate for both adenovirus and RNaseP. Samples that showed amplification for the target in only one well, or that had a Ct value for the target exceeding 40 cycles were repeated in duplicate. Repeated samples with target amplification curves in at least one well (regardless of Ct value) were considered positive. Repeated samples with no target amplification curves in both wells, and a valid RNaseP amplification were considered negative. There were no samples lacking RNaseP amplification and therefore no samples reported as inhibited. Further molecular studies were performed in the Laboratory of Viral Diseases at the Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, Albany, New York, with conventional PCR and sequence analysis. The hexon and fiber genes were amplified, bi-directionally Sanger sequenced on an ABI3700 and analyzed using NCBI Blast analysis. All other respiratory viruses were detected at the Wadsworth laboratory using the eSensor Â® respiratory viral panel kit (GenMark Inc., Freemont, CA.) which detects Influenza A H1 and H3, influenza A H1pdm09, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, parainfluenza virus 1, 2 3, and 4, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, adenovirus B/E and C, and coronavirus 229E, NL63, HKU1 and OC43 [22] . All results from the viral panel kit were confirmed by real-time PCR. In cases where rhinovirus could not be distinguished from enterovirus, it was classified as rhinovirus/ enterovirus indeterminate. Descriptive characteristics for patients were computed. Weights, Brodsky scores and percentages of airway obstruction were used as indicators of organ size. Categorical variables were reported as proportions in percentage and continuous level variables as means. Independent t tests were used to assess the relationship of virus frequency to Brodsky scores and percent of airway obstruction. The Brodsky scores were arbitrarily grouped into low scores of 1 and 2 or high scores of 3 or 4. Percent of airway obstruction was similarly grouped into low scores of 50% or less and high scores of greater than 50%. The independent t-test was used to assess the association between low and high Brodsky scores and nine virus types. The independent t-test was used to assess the association between low and high percentages of airway obstruction and the same nine viruses. The chi-square test was used to assess the association between the number of virus types and the Brodsky scores and the percentages of airway obstruction. Paired ttest was used to assess differences between the number of virus types between tonsils or adenoids. Pearson correlation was used to assess the association between age and total virus number types present. The association between age and total number of virus types was assessed by Pearson correlation. Analysis of variance was used to assess the association between Brodsky score and percent airway obstruction with the weights of tonsils and adenoids, respectively. All statistical tests were assessed assuming two-tailed hypotheses and with alpha of 0.05. All analyses were conducted with SYSTAT 13 (SYSTAT Software, 2004).
