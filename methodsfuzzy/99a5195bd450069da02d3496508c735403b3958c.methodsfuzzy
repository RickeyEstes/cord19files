Cells and cell culture. The human hepatoma cell line, Huh7, was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; BioWhittaker), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 lg/ml of streptomycin under standard culture conditions (5% CO 2 , 37°C). The human hepatoma stable cell lines Huh7TR-4, which expresses the tetracycline repressor, and Huh7TR-core, which expresses HCV core protein in a tetracycline-inducible manner [15] , were maintained in the presence of blasticidin S (10 lg/ml) and Zeocin (100 lg/ml). Core protein expression in Huh7TR-core was induced by addition of 1 lg/ml of tetracycline for 48 h, unless otherwise specified. The Huh7 cell line R-1, which supports stable, autonomous replication of genotype 1b HCV subgenomic replicon RNA, was described previously [16] . Plasmid construction. The pcDNA3.1-Flag-Core plasmid expressing Flag-epitope-tagged full-length HCV core protein was described previously [15] . The pcDNA3.1-Flag-NS5B plasmid was constructed by inserting the cDNA encoding Flag-epitope-tagged full-length HCV NS5B protein into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNAs encoding the finger domain (amino acids 1-187), the finger-palm domain (amino acids 1-371), the palm-thumb domain (amino acids 188-591), the palm domain (amino acids 188-371), and the thumb domain (amino acids 372-591) of HCV NS5B were amplified by PCR from the pThNS5B plasmid [5] and inserted at the NheI/EcoRI site of pET-28a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) to obtain pET-28a(+)/ NS5B(1-187), pET-28a(+)/NS5B(1-371), pET-28a(+)/NS5B(188-591), pET-28a(+)/NS5B(188-371), and pET-28a(+)/NS5B(372-591), respectively. For expression of the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-fused HCV core protein and its deletion derivatives, pEGFP-C(1-191), pEGFP-C(1-75), pEGFP-C(1-121), pEGFP-C(1-173), pEGFP-C(76-191), and pEGFP-C(99-191) were used [10] . The cDNA encoding the full-length SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) capsid protein was synthesized by RT-PCR using total RNA extracted from SARS-CoV (Urbani strain)-infected Vero E6 cells, and cloned into the pTrcHisB vector (Invitrogen). Expression and purification of recombinant proteins. Recombinant HCV NS5B protein with a hexahistidine tag at the N-terminus was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously [16] . HCV core protein was expressed in E. coli and purified from inclusion bodies as described previously [15] . SARS-CoV capsid protein (N) was expressed in Top10 E. coli cells (Invitrogen) at 25°C overnight by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside. The recombinant N protein was purified by metal affinity chromatography using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and SP-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) sequentially. Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation. In vitro immunoprecipitation of HCV core and NS5B proteins was performed using 1 lg of each recombinant protein. The two proteins in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]; 50 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl 2 ; 10% glycerol) were incubated with an anti-HCV core antibody (Virogen, Watertown, MA) for 1 h on a rotator at 4°C. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, Huh7TR-4 or Huh7TR-core cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-Flag-NS5B using FuGENE6 (Roche, Switzerland) and treated with 1 lg/ml of tetracycline for induction of core protein expression. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and washed twice with cold PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer A (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 150 mM NaCl; 1% Triton X-100; 10 mM NaF; 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 ; 17.5 mM b-glycerophosphate) supplemented with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, cell lysates was incubated with an anti-Flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, MO) for immunoprecipitation of the Flagtagged NS5B protein. For domain mapping of the NS5B-interacting region of HCV core protein, the subgenomic replicon cell line (R-1) was transfected with pEGFP, pEGFP-C(1-191), pEGFP-C(1-75), pEGFP-C(1-121), pEGFP-C(1-173), pEGFP-C(76-191), or pEGFP-C(99-191) using FuGENE6 (Roche) and harvested 48 h post-transfection. Cell lysates were incubated with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). Immunocomplexes were recovered by adsorption to Protein G-Sepharose or Protein A-Sepharose (Qiagen). Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Western blot analysis was performed as described previously [15] using an anti-core antibody (Virogen), a Penta-His antibody (Qiagen), an anti-Flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), an anti-NS5B monoclonal antibody (provided by S.B. Hwang at Hallym University, Korea), an anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or an HCV patient serum (provided by K.H. Han at Yonsei University College of Medicine). Proteins associated with antibodies were visualized using appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ). Confocal microscopy. The Huh7TR-core cell line was cultured in eight-well chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY) to $50% confluence and transfected with pcDNA3.1-Flag-NS5B. At 48 h posttransfection, cells were fixed and treated as described previously [15] . Cells were then incubated with a monoclonal anti-core protein antibody (Virogen) and anti-Flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Primary antibodies were detected by fluorescein isothiocyanateand Texas Red-coupled secondary antibodies. Nuclei were visualized by staining with 1 lM 4 0 ,6 0 -diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS for 10 min. Confocal images were obtained using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 laser scanning confocal microscope. Enzyme assays. In vitro RNA polymerase activity assays were performed using the full-length (His) 6 -tagged NS5B protein as described previously [16] . For the (À)3 0 -UTR template, which represents the complementary sequence of the 5 0 -UTR, 200 ng of RNA was used. RdRp reactions with the poly(A) template (1 lg) were conducted in the presence of 10 pmol of oligonucleotide (U) 20 as a primer. Heat-denatured RdRp products were resolved on an 8 M urea, 5% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried after fixing and then exposed to X-ray film for autoradiography. RdRp product levels were determined by densitometric analysis of autoradiographs using Scion Image from the National Institutes of Health or by measuring the cpm using a Perkin Elmer Topcounter. TaqMan real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from R-1 cells using TRIZOL LS reagent (Invitrogen) and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. HCV RNA levels were quantified by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using a primer pair and TaqMan probe targeting a region within the HCV 5 0 -UTR as described previously [16] . Cellular glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA from the same extracts was used as an internal control.
