Melting points were determined in open capillary tubes with a MFB 595010M Gallenkamp melting point apparatus. 400 MHz 1 H NMR and 100.6 MHz 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 400 spectrometer and 500 MHz 1 H NMR and 125.7 MHz 13 C NMR spectra were performed on a Varian Inova 500 equipment. Except were otherwise stated, 1 H NMR (500 MHz) and 13 C NMR (100.6 MHz) spectra were carried out in CD 3 OD solution. The chemical shifts are reported in ppm (d scale) relative to internal tetramethylsilane, and coupling constants are reported in hertz (Hz). Assignments given for the NMR spectra of the new compounds are based on DEPT, COSY 1 H/ 1 H (standard procedures), and COSY 1 H/ 13 C (gHSQC and gHMBC sequences) experiments for selected compounds. IR spectra were run on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum RX I spectrophotometer always in KBr. Absorption values are expressed as wavenumbers (cm À1 ); only significant absorption bands are given. For the MS and GC/MS analyses the sample was introduced directly or through a gas chromatograph, respectively using a Hewlett-Packard 5988A mass spectrometer. For GC/MS analyses a 30-meter column [5% diphenyl-95% dimethylpolysiloxane, conditions: 10 psi, initial temperature: 35°C (2 min), then heating at a range of 8°C/min till 300°C, then isothermic at 300°C] was used. The electron impact (70 eV) or chemical ionization (CH 4 ) techniques were used. The high resolution mass spectra were carried out with a Micromass Autospec or a LC/MSD TOF Agilent Technologies spectrometers. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel 60 AC.C (35-70 mesh, SDS, ref 2000027 on oocyte plasma membranes. The S31N and V27A mutant forms of A/M2 were generated by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). Synthesis of mRNA and microinjection of oocytes were carried out as described (Ma et al., 2008) . At 48-72 h after mRNA injection, macroscopic recording of the membrane current was performed (Balannik et al., 2009) . When the inward current reached maximum, various concentrations of the test compounds were added at pH 5.5. The compounds were applied for 2 min, and the residual membrane current was compared with the membrane current before compound application. Data were analyzed with pCLAMP 10.0 software (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA).
