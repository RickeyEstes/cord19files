Methods routinely used for enhancing virus visualization in clinical specimens are: Ultracentrifugation: Ultracentrifugation is commonly used to spin down virus particles. A viral specimen should first be subjected to a low-speed centrifugation to remove gross debris. The clarified supernatant is then centrifuged at a higher speed (15,000 g) for one hour, as recommended by Almeida [7] . Pellets are resuspended in distilled water, which helps to lyse cellular structures but leaves the virus intact. More recently, a table model Airfuge (air pressure-driven ultracentrifuge) has become available for spinning minute amounts of virus suspension directly on to EM grids [8] ; this procedure could increase virus concentration a hundredfold. After centrifugation, the grids can be stained with PTA and examined. Agar-gel diffusion: This method was first introduced by Kellenberger and Arber in 1957 [9] and applied to concentrated virus for routine EM examination by Anderson and Doane [10] . It is a simple method and easy to use. A drop of viral suspension is placed on a piece of agar block (1-2 percent) on a microscope slide. A Formvar carbon-coated specimen grid is allowed to float upside down on the virus suspension. Water, salts, and proteins of low molecular weights diffuse through the block agar, leaving the virus particles concentrated in the droplet on top of the agar block to adhere to the grid. Immune electron microscopy (IEM): Immune electron microscopy has been widely used for rapid immunodiagnosis of virus infection. It is also a method for enhancing the visualization of virus particles for electron microscopic examination [11] . Immune serum containing specific antibodies to the particular virus suspected is mixed with the specimen, followed by one hour of incubation at room temperature in order to allow antigen-antibody reaction to take place. Virus particles form aggregates by reaction with their homologous antibody. Small virus particles such as Norwalk virus [12] and hepatitis A virus [13] from feces often require use of this technique in order to facilitate the detection and differentiation of the virus particles from background materials. The virus-antiserum mixture can be further concentrated by agar-gel diffusion or ultracentrifugation, as described above. Alternatively, the antiserum can be first absorbed to the grid as a solid phase, after which the virus is applied to the grid and then permitted to form antigen-antibody complexes for visualization [14] . For the purpose of immunodiagnosis, following primary antigen-antibody reaction, ferritin or colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibody (antibody against primary antibody) can be applied to the mixture [15, 16] . The antigen-antibody complexes are then made visible in the electron microscope. This procedure is useful for identifying viruses of different antigenic types within the same virus group.
