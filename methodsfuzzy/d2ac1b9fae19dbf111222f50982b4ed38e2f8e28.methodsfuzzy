Virus culture. Four wild type strains of avian H9 influenza virus and four wild type strains of human H9N2 virus were employed in this study and detailed in Table 1 . The signature amino acid changes are listed in Supplementary materials, Table S1 . A reverse genetics virus 464419-D190E re-constructed with A/Hong Kong/464419/2009 (H9N2) backbone was prepared as described 38 . All viruses were plaque purified and passaged three times in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells and their identity was confirmed by sequencing. In order to study whether H9 viruses that replicated in the ferret model would replicate in our ex vivo system, a panel of eight viruses previously generated using plasmid based reverse genetics and tested in ferret models were used. Briefly, these viruses include the parent virus A/guinea fowl/Hong Kong/WF10/1999 (H9N2, WF10), and three H9N2 avian-human reassortant viruses: 1WF10, which contains the HA gene of WF10 and the NA and the six internal genes of A/Netherlands/602/2009 (H1N1pdm); 2WF10, which contains the HA and NA genes of WF10 and the six internal genes of H1N1pdm, and 2WF10:6M98 which contains the HA and NA genes of WF10 and the six internal genes of A/Memphis/14/1998 (H3N2, M98) . The second set of viruses was based on A/ferret/Maryland/P10_UMD/2008 (P10) (H9N2), which was the result of 10 serial passages in ferrets of the 2WF10:6M98 (avian-human H9N2:H3N2) 22 . Compared with the parent virus, P10 possessed mutations at surface proteins, HA1-T189A, HA2-G192R and NA-I28V, internal proteins, PB2-L374I and M1-H110Y. In addition, three reassortant viruses with the surface protein(s) of P10 were generated. 1P10 contains the HA from P10 and the other even genes from H1N1pdm, whereas 2P10 contains the HA and NA genes from P10 and the six internal genes from H1N1pdm. Lastly, the 2P10:6WF10 which encodes the HA and NA genes from P10 and the six internal genes from WF10 was produced (Table 1) . The role of neuraminidase of H9N2/G1 in relation to human tissue tropism was studied by using two recombinant H9N2 viruses: a H9N2 (rH9N2) containing the HA and NA of G1 and the internal genes from a pandemic H1N1 virus A/California/04/2009 (H1N1pdm), and a comparable virus (rH9N1) with only HA of G1 and the other seven genes from A/California/04/2009.
