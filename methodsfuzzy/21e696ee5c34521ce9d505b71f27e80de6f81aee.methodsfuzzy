Feces or tissue homogenates were prepared as 20 30~o suspensions in distilled water. After a clarifying centrifugation at 800xg for 30 min the resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 55,000 x g for 1 hr in a swinging bucket. The pellet was resuspended in distilled water to 1/10 of the original volume. Fifty to 100 ~tl of this suspension was then placed in a spot plate and 1 ml of distilled water, 200 ~al of a 4~ phosphotungstic acid and 50 lal of a 1~ bovine albumin solution added. After thorough mixing with the aid of a Pasteur pipette this suspension was then placed in an all-glass nebulizer and sprayed onto collodium carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grids under a hood. All specimens were immediately examined in a Philips 301 transmission electron microscope.
