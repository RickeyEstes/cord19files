We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-19 in asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated patients within the first 24 hours of their arrival in France and at day 5. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled nasal and oropharyngeal swab fluids or sputum in the absence of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then carried out using several realtime reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. All French nationals and all foreign nationals who were repatriated, including children of all ages, who were willing to be tested and provided their written consent after being orally informed were included in the study. We collected one nasal and one oropharyngeal swab and one sputum sample from each individual. For children under the age of three, a nasal rinse was performed. A team consisting of between two and seven infectious disease specialists was sent to the two quarantine bases to test asymptomatic persons. When an individual became symptomatic, they were transferred from the base to our Institute and cared for in the BSL3 ward while awaiting the results of the SARS-CoV-19 diagnosis. Once SARS-CoV-19 had been ruled out, the person was returned to the quarantine base. Individuals who presented respiratory symptoms during the flight were sampled at the airport, and were then referred to their quarantine base if testing for SARS-CoV-19 was negative.
