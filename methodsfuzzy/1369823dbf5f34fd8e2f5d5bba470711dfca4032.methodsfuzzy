Patients will be considered candidates for inclusion in the study if they meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (box 1). Patients suffering from severe trauma admitted within the first 24 hours, who require invasive mechanical ventilation expected to last longer than 48 hours, should be included in the study. For all cases, patient inclusion will take place as soon as possible after ICU admission, during the 24 hours following trauma and/or over the 15 hours following oral intubation of the trachea. Pregnant or lactating women can be included in the study because the material used does not present any specific risk of teratogenicity.
