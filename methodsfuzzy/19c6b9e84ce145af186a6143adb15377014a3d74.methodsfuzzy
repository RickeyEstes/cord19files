This research was conducted under an internal review boardapproved protocol which allowed for the collection of clinical samples from patients presenting with influenza-like respiratory symptoms in the Emergency Department (ED) of Brooke Army Medical Center after informed consent was obtained. Transfer of de-identified specimens (stored virus or, in the case of H1N1 novel 2009 [swine flu] specimens, isolated viral RNA) from a local epidemiology reference laboratory was also approved. Twenty nasal swab samples collected from ED patients with influenza-like symptoms, 5 archived de-identified Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial specimens, and 75 deidentified specimens transferred from the local epidemiology laboratory were investigated. Although the viral samples obtained from the epidemiology reference laboratory were de-identified (all personal health information and personal identifiers removed), they were supplied with the etiologic agent of each sample identified. The laboratory personnel performing the extractions, Luminex RVP assay, and Lucigen PyroScript tests were blinded to the clinical results until the conclusion of all testing. These samples included 24 novel influenza A H1N1 RNA specimens and 12 influenza A H1N1 seasonal, 12 influenza A H3N2 seasonal, 15 influenza B seasonal; 5 adenovirus, 4 parainfluenza 3 viral specimens, and 3 negative samples (no virus detected). The 5 Streptococcus pyogenes culture-positive throat swab samples were confirmed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers for the ubiquitous proS gene as described before (Livezey et al., 2011) and were included in the study as influenzanegative controls. All samples were stored at −80°C. The objective of this preliminary study was to assess the specificity and sensitivity of the influenza A and B NALF systems as a potential rapid screening assay. This system, because of its simplicity and independence from expensive or complicated instrumentation, could be used in near point-of-care settings. Analysis time was considered, but did not include sample preparation time since our samples were stored specimens. For our convenience and reproducibility purposes, as well as for comparison to the Food and Drug Administration approved xTAG® (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) test, nucleic acid isolation was performed by an automated system (NucliSENS® easyMAG® system, bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) as described in Bolotin et al. (2009) . The purified nucleic acids obtained were stored at −80°C. The gold standard for the specificity and sensitivity assessment was the results of the FDA approved RVP, a nucleic acid test. The RVP test had a sensitivity of 98.2% and a specificity of 96.4% in a study of 247 clinical samples when compared to DFA and culture results (Mahony et al., 2007) . All viral isolates were amplified, hybridized, and detected with the Luminex® IS-200 instrument (Luminex, Austin, TX) using the xTAG RVP kit following the vendor's protocol. Briefly, 5 μL of purified nucleic acid from each sample was reverse transcribed in a 25-μL multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tube. A multiplex target specific primer extension (TSPE) reaction was prepared per sample using 5 μL of treated RT-PCR. After TSPE, 3.5 μL of reaction product of each reaction was added directly to a micro-well containing 20 μL of RVP Luminex bead mixture for hybridization. Phycoerythrin reporter (100 μL) was added to each well containing hybridization product to identify the presence of a virus by assessment of the fluorescence in a Luminex IS-200. Results generated were analyzed using the software component of the kit (TDAS RVP-I). In addition, all novel H1N1 2009 RNA samples were assayed by a microarray technique (ElectraSense® assay, CombiMatrix, Corp., Mukilteo, WA, USA) to positively identify the H1(sw)N1 variant (Straight et al., 2010) . The PyroScript® Influenza reagents (Lucigen) were tested for all samples in this study. One reaction per test was prepared on ice in a 200-μL PCR tube as follows: 6.25 μL nuclease-free water, 12.50 μL PyroScript Isothermal 2× master mix, 1.25 μL 20× Primer Mix, and 5 μL of nucleic acid sample. The reaction was mixed and centrifuged briefly before incubating for 40 min at 72°C in a thermal cycler (Eppendorf 5417R, Hamburg, Germany) preheated to 72°C. The reaction was stopped at 4°C on ice until the 200-μL PCR tube containing specific amplicons was loaded in a cartridge of a Type I BESt™ Cassette (BioHelix Corporation, Beverly, MA, USA) for detection according to the manufacturer's instructions. The influenza A or B-amplified molecules entered the DNA strips via capillary action. When the cassette was closed, the PCR tube released the 6-carboxy fluorescein (FAM) and biotin-labeled amplicons (flu A or flu B reagent) and detected via gold nanoparticle-labeled anti-FAM antibodies. Results were visually read after 10-15 min, photographed, and results recorded.
