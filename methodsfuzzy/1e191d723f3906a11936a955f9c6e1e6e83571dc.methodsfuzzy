Melting points were determined on a Stuart Melting Point Apparatus SMP3 and were uncorrected. IR spectra were recorded on a FTIR PerkineElmer Paragon 500 spectrometer. UVevisible double beam spectrophotometer Lambda 20 (PerkineElmer) was used for the in vitro tests. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-600 spectrometer, operating at 600. 13 and 300.13 MHz for the 1 H and 150.917 and 75. 47 MHz for 13 C nuclei. Samples were measured in DMSO-d 6 solutions at 20 C in 5 mm NMR tubes. Chemical shifts (d) in ppm were referred to TMS. CHN analyses were performed on CHNS LECO analyzer and were within AE0.4%. Solvent systems dichloromethane/methanol (9:1 and 9.5:0.5), cyclohexane/ethyl acetate (1:1), petroleum ether/ ethyl acetate/methanol (3:1:0.5 and 1:2:0.1) and precoated silica gel 60 F 254 plates were used for thin-layer chromatography. Spots were visualized by short-wave UV light, iodine vapor, phosphomolybdic acid or ferric chloride solution. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (0.063e0.200 mm), with cyclohexane/ ethyl acetate/methanol (3:1:0.6) or dichloromethane/methanol (9.5:0.5 or 8.5:1.5) as eluents. 2-(3-Benzylphenyl)propanoic acid was prepared by ketoprofen reduction. 1-Benzotriazole carboxylic acid chloride (BtcCl, 1) and NSAID (ibuprofen, fenoprofen, and reduced ketoprofen) benzotriazolides (2aec) were synthesized according to our previously published procedures [24e26] . For preparation of 1-(N-alkyl/ arylcarbamoyl)benzotriazoles (1-benzotriazole carboxylic acid amides) 4aeg our synthetic method was applied as well [27] . The following derivatives were prepared: 1-(N-cyclopentylcarbamoyl) benzotriazole (4a), 1-(N-cyclohexylcarbamoyl)benzotriazole (4b), 1-(N-cyclohexanemethylcarbamoyl)benzotriazole (4c), 1-(N-benzylcarbamoyl)benzotriazole (4d), 1-[N-(2-phenylethylcarbamoyl)] benzotriazole (4e), 1-(N-benzhydrylcarbamoyl)benzotriazole (4f) and 1-(N-benzyloxycarbamoyl)benzotriazole (4g). Benzotriazole (BtH), triphosgene, O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride, cyclopentylamine, cyclohexylamine, cyclohexanemethylamine, benzylamine, 2-phenylethanamine, benzhydrylamine, hydrazine hydrate, triethylamine (TEA) and 10% Pd/C were purchased from Aldrich. Ibuprofen, fenoprofen and ketoprofen were gift samples from Pliva, University of Potchefstroom and Belupo. DPPH, AAPH and NDGA were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Soybean LOX and linoleic acid sodium salt were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. All solvents were of analytical grade purity and dry.
