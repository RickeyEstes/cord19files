For quality control, the scaled log 2 Cy3-labeled experimental cRNA probe values and the scaled log 2 Cy5-labeled reference cRNA probe values for each WT and DHS replicate were determined as described above and then compared in box plots using R package 'graphics' ignoring outliers [63] . In addition, the scaled log 2 Cy5-labeled reference cRNA signal was subtracted from the scaled log 2 Cy3-labeled experimental sample cRNA signal for each probe. The normalized probe values for the WT and DHS replicates were analyzed by scatter plot. Linear model fit of the scatter plots was performed using 'lm' from R package 'stats' [63] . (EPS) Figure S4 The particle to PFU ratio is similar between viruses. (A) Particle number was determined by isolating DNA from viral stocks and performing qPCR using gB primers. PFU was determined by plaque assay. At least 5 viral stocks from DHS and MR, and 3 from WT were assessed for both particle number and PFU. Differences are not statistically significant.
