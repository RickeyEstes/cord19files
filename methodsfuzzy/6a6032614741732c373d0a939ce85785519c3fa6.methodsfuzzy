Recombinant simian RV strain SA11 (rRV-wt), rescued using the reverse-genetics system using cDNA clones encoding wild-type SA11 (G3P [2] ) virus (28) , was propagated in MA104 cells cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0.5 g/ml trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). Recombinant RV titration. Recombinant NSP5 mutant RVs were grown in MA-NSP5 cells, and the lysate was serially diluted 2-fold and used to infect MA-NSP5 cells, seeded in 24-well plates with coverslips. After 1 h of adsorption, virus was removed, and cells were incubated at 37°C. Nuclei were stained with ProLong diamond antifade mountant with DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2phenylindole) (Thermo Scientific). Samples were imaged using a confocal setup (Zeiss Airyscan equipped with a 63ϫ objective with a numerical aperture [NA] of 1.3). Each viroplasm-containing cell was counted as one focus-forming unit (FFU). The average number of cells with viroplasms of six fields of view per each virus dilution was determined, and the total number of cells containing viroplasms in the whole preparation was estimated. The virus titer was determined as: where N is a total number of cells containing 1 or more viroplasms and V is the volume of virus inoculum added. Replication kinetics of recombinant viruses. MA104 cell line (ATCC CRL-2378.1) or stably transfected MA104 cells (NSP5; Δ3, ΔT) were seeded into 24-well plates and subsequently infected with recombinant RVs at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) (FFU/cell) of 0.5 for multistep growth curve experiments and an MOI of 5 for a single-step growth curve experiment. After adsorption for 1 h at 37°C, the cells were washed twice with PBS and the medium was replaced with DMEM without trypsin. After incubation at 37°C, the cells were harvested after 8, 16, 24, and 36 h of virus adsorption. The cell lysates were freeze-thawed three times and activated with trypsin (1 g/ml) for 30 min at 37°C. The lysates were used to infect monolayers of MA-NSP5 cells seeded in a -Slide 8-well chamber slide (iBidi GmbH, Munich, Germany). The cells were then fixed 5 h postinfection for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 5 min with PBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100. Next, cells were incubated for 30 min with PBS-BSA at room temperature and then with anti-NSP5 serum (1:1,000) diluted in PBS-BSA (22) . After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with TRITC-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) (1:500) diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA (PBS-BSA). The number of infected cells was counted, and the virus titers were expressed in focus-forming units per ml (FFU/ml). Plasmid construction. RV plasmids pT 7 -VP1-SA11, pT 7 -VP2-SA11, pT 7 -VP3-SA11, pT 7 -VP4-SA11, pT 7 -VP6-SA11, pT 7 -VP7-SA11, pT 7 -NSP1-SA11, pT 7 -NSP2-SA11, pT 7 -NSP3-SA11, pT 7 -NSP4-SA11, and pT 7 -hybridized with a 62.5 nM concentration of an equimolar mixture of Cy3-labeled DNA probes designed to target the coding region of gene segment 6 of simian rotavirus A/SA11 (GenBank accession no. AY187029.1) using Stellaris Probe Designer v2 software (LCG Biosearch Technologies), in a total volume of 200 l of the hybridization buffer (Stellaris RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] hybridization buffer, SMF-HB1-10 [Biosearch Technologies], supplemented with 10% [vol/vol] deionized formamide). After 4 to 8 h of incubation at 37°C in a humidified chamber, samples were briefly rinsed with the wash buffer (300 mM NaCl, 30 mM trisodium citrate, pH 7.0, 10% [vol/vol] formamide in nuclease-free water), after which a fresh aliquot of 300 l of the wash buffer was applied to each sample and incubated twice at 37°C for 30 min. After 2 washes, nuclei were briefly stained with 300 nM DAPI solution in 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM trisodium citrate, pH 7.0, and the samples were finally rinsed with and stored in the same buffer without DAPI prior to imaging. Transmission electron microscopy. MA104 cells were seeded at 1 ϫ 10 5 cells in 2-cm 2 wells onto sapphire discs and infected at an MOI of 75 FFU/cell. At 10 hpi, cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 100 mM Na/K phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 4˚C and kept in that buffer overnight at 4˚C. Afterward, samples were postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 100 mM Na/K phosphate buffer for 1 h at 4˚C and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series starting at 70%, followed by two changes in acetone, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections (60 to 80 nm) were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate (47) . Samples were analyzed in a transmission electron microscope (CM12; Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) equipped with a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera (Ultrascan 1000; Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, USA) at an acceleration of 100 kV. -Ppase and CIP assays. Cellular extracts were incubated with 2,000 U of -protein phosphatase (-Ppase) (New England Biolabs) in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.01% Brij 35, and 2 mM MnCl 2 . The mixture was incubated at 30°C for 2 h. Samples were loaded into an SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by Western blotting. For the CIP assay, cellular extracts were incubated with 1,000 U of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) (New England Biolabs) in CutSmart reaction buffer (New England Biolabs) and incubated at 30°C for 2 h. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Electrophoresis of viral dsRNA genomes. Cells were infected with the recombinant viruses at an MOI of 5 and lysed 16 h postinfection. Total RNA was extracted from lysed cells with RNAzol (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the dsRNA segments were resolved on 10% (wt/vol) PAGE gels for 2 h at 180 V and visualized by ethidium bromide staining (1 g/ml). Protein analysis. Proteins derived from rRV-infected cellular extract were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel for 2 h at 35 mA and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore; IPVH00010) for 1 h 30 min at 300 mA (24) . For protein analysis, membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies: anti-NSP5 (1:5,000) (16), anti-VP2 (1:5,000) (10), and anti-NSP2 guinea pig sera (1:2,000). The membranes were then incubated with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig sera (1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Mouse HRP-conjugated anti-actin monoclonal antibody (MAb) (1:35,000) (clone AC-15; Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a loading control. Signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate; Thermo Scientific). Statistics used. Statistical analysis and plotting were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Prism 6.0; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Error bars represent standard deviations. Data were considered to be statistically significant when a P of Ͻ0.05 was determined by Student's t test. Data availability. Sequences for NSP5/S67A, NSP5/ΔT, NSP5/Δ176-180, NSP5/Δ3, and NSP5/KO are available in GenBank under accession numbers MN520458, MN520459, MN520460, MN520461, and MN520462, respectively.
