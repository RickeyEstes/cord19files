The first work on BsAb generation was published in 1961 and described the production of chimeric BsAbs containing simultaneously two different antigen-binding sites from a mixture of two monospecific Abs. Such BsAbs simultaneously precipitated both antigens specific to the original Abs. 58 In 1983-2007, it was shown that IgG 4 molecules stochastically exchanged HL fragments; this posttranslational
