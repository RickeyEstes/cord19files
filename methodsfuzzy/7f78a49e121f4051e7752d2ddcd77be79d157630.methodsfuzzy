Sixty-two PRRSV isolates (representing 52 farms) were obtained from the Illinois Animal Disease Laboratories in Galesburg, IL. These isolates had been submitted for diagnostic testing by veterinarians from Illinois and eastern Iowa between April 1997 and July 1998. Clinical data (including farms of origin and names of submitting veterinarians) accompanied each sample. Epidemiologic data pertaining to each sample were collected through interviews with submitting veterinarians. Veterinarians were contacted by telephone, informed of the purpose of the study, and assured that all information obtained would remain confidential. All telephone interviews were conducted by the same interviewer (TLG) to eliminate error due to inter-observer variation. Veterinarians were first asked to confirm the locations of the herds from which PRRSV isolates were collected, as well as dates of collection. Veterinarians were then asked to provide information about the clinical disease signs which were present on the farms at the times of sample collection, as well as information about the farms themselves. Epidemiologic variables collected are described in Table 1 . Predictor variables (farm characteristics) were chosen either because they were predicted to influence the rate and extent of transmission of PRRSV within herds (CONFINE, HERDSIZE, NURSAIAO, FINAIAO), or because they were predicted to influence the extent and severity of clinical signs once transmission had occurred (VACCINE). Outcome variables were chosen to represent the full spectrum of clinical disease manifestations typical of PRRS outbreaks (Done et al., 1996) . Genetic data consisted of nucleotide sequences of the open reading frame 5 (ORF5) gene of PRRSV. This gene, which codes for an immunologically important membranespanning protein, was chosen because of its high variability among field isolates within the United States (Kapur et al., 1996; Murtaugh et al., 1998) and because of documented differences in ORF5 between PRRSV isolates of low and high experimental virulence (Meng et al., 1995) . Genetic methodologies included in vitro propagation of viral isolates followed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of ORF5 and automated fluorescent DNA sequencing. For each PRRSV isolate, 603 nucleotide bases of cDNA (reverse-transcribed genomic RNA) were thus sequenced. The genetic techniques used are described in detail elsewhere (Goldberg et al., in press) . Genetic similarity between isolates was computed as the uncorrected pairwise percent nucleotide similarity between ORF5 sequences. Specifically, genetic similarity between all possible pairs of isolates was calculated as the raw percentage of nucleotide bases which the two sequences shared. A matrix of genetic distances was thus obtained, with values in cells ranging from a possible minimum of 0% to a possible maximum of 100%. Genetically identical isolates from the same farm were collapsed to avoid pseudoreplication. Clinical similarity between isolates was scored as either zero or one for each clinical sign: pairs of isolates received a score of one when the same clinical sign was present during their respective outbreaks; otherwise, pairs of isolates received a score of zero. A matrix of clinical similarity was thus obtained, equal in size to the matrix of genetic similarity described above, with values in cells being either zero or one. Correlations between matrices of genetic similarity and clinical similarity were performed using Mantel tests of matrix correlation (Mantel, 1967) , conducted with computer program The R Package (Legendre and Vaudour, 1991) . A standardized form of the Mantel test statistic (r) was used (Smouse et al., 1986) . For each matrix correlation performed, a null distribution of r was created using 10 000 Monte Carlo permutations of the matrices (Hope, 1968) . Observed r values were compared to their respective null distributions, and probabilities were calculated as the proportion of null values as extreme or more extreme than the observed value of r. Clinical disease signs were predicted to be positively intercorrelated, because farms experiencing any PRRS clinical sign should be predisposed to experiencing others. For c Herd size was defined as the number of sows plus the number of pigs marketed per year. Where data on the number of pigs marketed per year was missing, the number of sows was multiplied by 18.27, which was the mean number of pigs marketed per sow in the data set. d All-inÂ±all-out is a management strategy in which animals are moved through the production cycle (farrowing 3 nursery 3 finishing stages of production) in cohorts, to reduce disease transmission across age classes. Facilities were considered AIAO only if AIAO was practiced at the level of the room, building or site. AIAO at the level of the pen was considered``continuous flow''. e VACCINE represents a PRRSV vaccine having been used on the farm prior to the time of sample collection. f Predicted direction of association of predictor variable with all outcome variables. g n number of farms reporting; % percentage of farms practicing the management strategy listed, or experiencing the clinical sign listed (categorical variables). h Interval-level variable; quartile 1 (Q1) 2741, Q2 5024, Q3 10 962; minimum 1927; maximum 38 540 pigs. this reason, bivariable associations were calculated between clinical disease signs using PROC FREQ of the computer program SAS (SAS Institute, 1989) , as an aid to interpreting associations between farm characteristics and clinical disease signs (described below). Multiple-logistic-regression analyses were performed using PROC LOGISTIC of SAS to investigate the overall and independent contributions of predictor variables (farm characteristics) to each of the seven outcome variables (clinical-disease signs). All predictor variables were initially entered into each regression model, and then were subject to backwards stepwise elimination with a P-to-enter and P-to-remove of 0.10. Missing-value indicator variables were coded as needed. One-tailed statistical tests were used since directional predictions were made in all instances (Table 1) . Results were considered significant at the 0.05 level.
