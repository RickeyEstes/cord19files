Presence of C. parvum oocysts was demonstrated by microscopic examination of faecal smears stained with the modified Ziehl-Neelsen technique (Henriksen & Pohlenz 1981) . Rotavirus was analysed by a group A rotavirus ELISA (Svensson et al. 1986 ) using an optical density value of 0.1 to discriminate between positive and negative samples. Coronavirus was analysed by ELISA with an in-house method developed and used for routine diagnosis at the Swedish National Veterinary Institute. Commercially available ELISAs were used for demonstration of G. intestinalis (Prospect Giardia microplate assay, Alexon-Trend, Ramsey, MN, USA) and E. coli K99+ (BioX, Bruxelles, Belgium).
