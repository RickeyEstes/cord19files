Different types of samples, either taken in vivo, such as feces, fluids or swabs, or post-mortem during necropsy, such as viscera or organ contents, may be examined by ns-IAEM. In the first case, the convalescent sera may be taken from the same clinically affected animals, while in the second case, animals of the same group/herd/flock are sampled. Fecal materials and fluids are diluted 1:10 (v/v) in sterile distilled water. Swabs (ocular, nasal, tracheal, fecal etc.) are re-suspended in 1 mL sterile distilled water. Organs (spleen, liver, kidney, lung etc.) extracts (1:10 w/v in sterile distilled water) are obtained by mechanical homogenization using Ultraturrax (IKA ® -Werke GmbH & Co. KG, Staufen, Germany). The samples are first frozen, thawed twice, and then centrifuged at 5500× g for 20 min and at 12,800× g for 10 min for clarification. The second supernatant (85 µL) is mixed with the same amount of each serial dilution of the convalescent sera and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C before ultracentrifugation using an Airfuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA, USA) for 15 min at 21 psi (82,000× g). The Airfuge is fitted with an A-100/18 rotor holding six 175 µL test tubes containing specific hand-made adapters with 3 mm grids, which allow direct pelleting of viral particles onto a glow-discharged EM sample support (300 mesh copper grid, covered with a carbon reinforced plastic film). The adapters are almost identical to those provided in the past by Beckman. They are made of Plexiglas and shaped to fit perfectly into the tubes. The 3-mm grids are put in a slot obtained on the face of the adapter which has a slant cut with the same angle of the rotor (18°) in order to permit direct pelleting of particles on their surface. Grids are then stained using 2% sodium phosphotungstate (NaPT; Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland), pH 6.8, for 1 .5 min and observed with a TEM operating at 80-85 kV, 30,000×. At IZSLER,  a Siemens Elmiskop 102 TEM was used till 1988, from 1988 to 2011 a Philips CM10 TEM was  used and since August 2011 a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit Biotwin (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) TEM was used.
