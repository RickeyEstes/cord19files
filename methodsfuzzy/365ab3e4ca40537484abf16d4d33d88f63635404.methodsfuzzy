This bibliometric study analyzed MERS research articles published from 1 January 2012 to 22 July 2015. The study period was set on the assumption that all publications on MERS came after 2012, when the disease was first reported. We searched "MERS" or "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome" in "title/abstract" in PubMed and retrieved all records indexed under our predefined search strategy. The only limitation was the period of articles (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) . The retrieved articles were screened by two reviewers. Articles were included only if their primary focus was MERS. Duplicates, news reports, and book chapters were excluded. Profile information of each included article was then extracted by one of the reviewers, including the title, month and year of publication, corresponding author with his/her address, publication type and journal title, affiliation of the corresponding author, and the source country (determined according to the affiliation of the corresponding author). The data was double-checked by the second reviewer. Article retrieval and data extraction were completed within one day on 22 July 2015 to avoid possible bias resulting from the daily update of the databases. The collected data and its subtotals were used to obtain: (a) the contributions of countries, organizations and individuals to MERS research between 2013 and 2015; (b) the distribution of published papers in top journals. We employed VOSviewer (Center for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, The Netherlands) to map PubMed MERS articles' terms. Using VOSviewer and thresholds of minimally 10 fractionally counted papers for each term, a worldwide map of the articles term was generated [7] . Each point in the map is colored in relation to the density of the items at that point. By default, this color is somewhere in between red and blue. The larger the number of items in the neighborhood of a point and the higher the weights of the neighboring items, the closer the color of the point is to red [8] . Articles were classified by two independent reviewers into three categories (prevention and control study, basic medical sciences and clinical studies, and other studies), and prevention and control studies were further divided into four research domains (transmission and risk factors, investigation and surveillance, intervention, and others) on the basis of the main objectives(s) of the study (Table 1) [9] . Search for causative agent (identification and characteristics) 3. Investigate transmission (determine the modes and routes of transmission, estimate the transmission probability and variability andpredict future trends of the present outbreak) Intervention 1. Describe the use of specific intervention in the population 2. Estimate and evaluate effectiveness of the intervention 3. Develop methods and/or tools for real-time monitoring during the outbreak Others 1. Promote planning and policy-making by health services 2. Investigate psychobehaviors 3. Other epidemiological studies
