Data collected at the individual trial sites were pooled and analyzed descriptively and statistically. Nonparametric statistical tests were used to perform comparisons between groups. All qualitative data (qualitative oocyst excretion, incidence and prevalence of diarrhoea) were tested with Fisher's exact test. The quantitative data (quantitative oocyst excretion, body weight, age) were tested with the Mann-Whitney test. Growth performance was analyzed by calculating weight gain between the end of the study period (SD78) and the day of treatment (SD1). A multiple linear regression model with mixed effect was used to compare average daily gain between groups. Effects were considered significant at an error level of 5% (p = 0.05) or lower.
