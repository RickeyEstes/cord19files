Viruses HRV-A16 and HRV-C15 were clinical isolates that were cloned and viruses were produced by transfecting viral RNA into Hela cells as previously described (Bochkov et al., 2011) . After three freezes, thaw cycles the cell lysate was treated with RNaseA (10 mg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature to get rid of free RNA that is present outside the virions. This procedure was included so that viral RNA measurements would reflect the quantity of viruses and not unpackaged viral RNA. The viruses were purified by pelleting through a 30% sucrose cushion in a Beckman SW 41 rotor (40,000 rpm, 16 1C, 130 min) (Lee et al., 1995; Wang et al., 1998) . Pelleted virus was resuspended in PBS with 0.01% BSA and stored at À 70 1C. HRV-C41 was a clinical isolate produced by inoculating nasal secretions into sinus organ culture as previously described (Bochkov et al., 2011) . The cultures were frozen and thawed thrice to release the virions and centrifuged at low speed to get rid of the cellular debris and frozen at À70 1C till used.
