Throughout this paper, the entities of interest consist of signals detected by mass spectrometry where one or more MS/MS spectra have been recorded by the instrument. It is understood that not all of these signals correspond to compounds in the biological sample; but clearly, only those signals that do correspond are of interest for our analysis. It is also understood that we usually cannot ultimately decide whether a certain signal stems from the protonated molecule [M + H] + or, say, the protonated molecule with a water loss [M−H 2 O + H] + or an ammonia adduct [M + NH 3 + H] + . This is not a problem of our method but rather a general problem of mass spectrometry. For the sake of readability, we will nevertheless use the term compound instead of hypothetical compound, feature, adduct or ion. In contrast, our methods decide for each compound if it is protonated Diatoms. This dataset consists of solid phase (PPL, Agilent) extracts of the intra-and exometabolomes of a single diatom genus, a major group of marine microalgae. In total, ve culture samples of the species Pseudo-nitzschia subpacica (2×), Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima (2×) and Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries (1×) were grown in culture from environmental isolates. Cultures included each diatom species and its associated microbiome resulting in a complex and diverse pool of metabolites.

The samples were analyzed in data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode by UHPLC-MS/MS on a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer in positive ionization mode. Metabolomics studies of marine algae are rare, and so, existing libraries are not expected to have many relevant entries, making this an interesting dataset for testing novel compound identication. Mice stool. Quinn et al. used this dataset to examine the dierence between germ free and colonized mice by metabolomics 46 . In particular, some molecules were only observed in colonized mice, including novel conjugated bile acids and other food derived plant metabolites, which showed the role of the microbiome in their metabolization. Mice stool samples from a microbiome study were analyzed by UHPLC-MS/MS in data dependent acquisition mode mode on a maXis QTOF mass spectrometer in positive ionization mode. Due to technical limitations, the maXis QTOF used for mass spectrometry employs a broader isolation window of (at least 4 m/z ), and makes identication by computational methods challenging, because isotope peaks can be found in the MS/MS; it also strongly increases the chance of chimeric spectra (fragmentation spectra comprised of fragments from multiple compounds, see below).
