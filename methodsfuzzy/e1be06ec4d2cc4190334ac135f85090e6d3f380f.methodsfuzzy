We used Kulldorff's space-time scan statistical analysis to detect the temporal, spatial, and space-time clusters of TB, and to verify whether the geographic clustering of TB was caused by random variation or not [20] . Since the population in several areas was very small, we used the radius of the population coverage instead of the geographical radius. The discrete Poisson probability model was used for scanning since the TB incidence was not very high [18] . The window with the maximum likelihood is defined as the most likely cluster area, and other clusters with statistically significant log-likelihood ratios (LLR) were defined as the secondary potential clusters. The Pvalues of LLR were estimated through 9999 Monte Carlo simulations [16, 18] . A P-value <0.05 indicates a significantly high risk inside of the scan window, which might be a potential cluster of a high risk of TB. The relative risk (RR) of TB in each cluster was calculated to evaluate the risk of TB in the cluster areas [12, 21, 22] . The results of spatio-temporal scan are sensitive to various parameters, like the maximum cluster sizes of spatial and temporal. Thus, the selection of the maximum radius of the spatial scanning window and the maximum length of the temporal scanning window were very important [23] . In order to select optimal parameters, we analyzed the data of 2009 using the maximum spatial cluster sizes from 4% to 50% of total population at risk by increments of 1%. The radius was considered as an optimal radius for analysis if there were fewer overlaps between the areas defined by the radius, and the biggest area covered less than seven counties or 15% of all the counties [24, 25] . Similarly, we found an optimal temporal cluster size by testing the maximum temporal cluster sizes from 10% to 50% of the total study period by increments of 1% to analyze the data of the preceding 5 years (2009-2013). Based on the the optimal spatio-temporal parameters, retrospective space-time scanning analysis was applied to identify the geographic areas and time periods of potential clusters with significantly higher TB incidents than that of nearby areas. We also used Global Moran's I spatial autocorrelation analysis to depict the spatial clustering of annual TB incidence at the county level. The Moran's I > 0, = 0, and <0 indicate a positive spatial autocorrelation, random distribution, and negative spatial autocorrelation, respectively [12] . Additionally, we conducted time series seasonal decomposition analysis to identify the seasonality of TB incidence in Qinghai province [26] [27] [28] . The seasonal index was also calculated to examine the seasonal pattern of TB. The index was calculated as the ratio of the average number of cases for a given month to the average monthly incidents of 8*12 months (2009-2016). An index value close to 1.0 indicates no seasonal trend [29] . The SaTScanâ„¢ software (v 9.4.1, Kulldorff and Information Management Services, Inc.) was used for spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal analyses. Then, we used ArcGIS (v10.2.2, ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA) to visualize the relative risk of TB in high-risk cluster areas. Open GeoDa software (Arizona State University, AZ, USA) was used for Global Moran's I spatial autocorrelation analysis. P < 0.05 indicates a statistical significance.
