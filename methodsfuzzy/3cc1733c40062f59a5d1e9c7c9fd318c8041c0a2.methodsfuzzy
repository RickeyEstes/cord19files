This cross-sectional study of patients presenting with a sore throat was nested within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the use of CRP to guide antibiotic prescription in those consulting with a fever (> 37.5°C) or history of fever. 22 Patients were randomized to one of two CRP intervention groups (differing in the threshold used to recommend an antibiotic) or a control group. Patients were recruited from six government-run primary care units in Chiang Rai between June 2016 and August 2017. Chiang Rai is the most northern province in Thailand, bordering Laos PDR and Myanmar. It has a population of 1.3 million, 23 of whom approximately 20% are from an ethnic minority group (Chiang Rai Highland People Development Center, personal communication). There are 32 government-run primary care units in Chiang Rai's central district, serving a population of 240,000 in 2016. 23 They are staffed primarily by registered nurses. The study sites are located within a 30-minute drive from the center of Chiang Rai. The full list of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the RCT is presented in the protocol summary on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02758821). In brief, eligible patients were aged 1 year or older presenting with a fever or history of fever and a total illness duration of less than 14 days. Patients were not excluded for prior antibiotic use. Recruitment was stratified by age (2 groups: children < 12 years adolescents and adults ³ 12). Research nurses collected clinical data from the patients, including their presenting signs and symptoms and recent antibiotic use. Data on examination findings, diagnoses, and antibiotic prescription were collected from patients' clinical records. C-reactive protein was measured in the intervention group using NycoCard Reader II (Axis Shield, Norway; range for whole blood, 8-200 mg/L) on site using a finger-prick blood sample. The CRP results were available within minutes and fed back to the responsible clinicians. The CRP test for the control group was carried out later that day using venous blood samples, which were analyzed in the Chiang Rai Clinical Research Unit's laboratory using the same CRP reader but without feedback to the responsible clinicians. All patients were followed up with a repeat point-of-care CRP test on day 5 and assessed for clinical recovery at days 5 and 14. Patients with fever or a history of fever and sore throat were included in this nested study between November 2016 and August 2017 and had a throat swab taken. Centor 24 (criteria = tonsillar exudate, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy or lymphadenitis, history of fever, and absence of cough) and FeverPAIN 25 (criteria = fever in the last 24 hours, pus on the tonsils, attendance within 3 days of symptom onset, severely inflamed tonsils, and no cough or coryza) clinical scores were calculated retrospectively. Selection bias was reduced by recruiting consecutive eligible patients before any measurements. Written informed consent or parental consent for those aged less than 18 years was obtained from all study participants, with additional assent obtained from those aged seven to less than 18 years in accordance with local guidelines. Ethical approval was obtained from the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee, the Mahidol University Faculty of Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee, and Chiang Rai Provincial Public Health Office Research Ethics Committee. Laboratory. Throat swabs were collected and placed in Amies transport medium with charcoal and stored at 0-4°C until processed at the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU) laboratory, Tak Province, Thailand. Samples were plated onto blood agar and incubated at 35 ± 2°C in 5-10% CO 2 for 20-24 hours. The presence of BHS was confirmed by Gram stain, catalase, and Lancefield grouping. GAS isolates were then tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by disk diffusion according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria. 26 The SMRU laboratory is not accredited but participates in external quality assurance (EQA) including the EQA program from the Department of Medical Sciences, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand, for bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Patients within the control group also had a nasopharyngeal swab taken, which was tested using TaqMan ® Array Card (TAC; Life Technologies TM , Waltham, MA). 27, 28 The assay was screened for 32 pathogens in a single run of multiplex reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (see Supplementary Material). This article fulfills the Microbiology Investigation Criteria for Reporting Objectively (MICRO) framework checklist requirements for standardized reporting of clinical microbiology data. 29 Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic data using counts and percentages for categorical data and medians and IQR for continuous variables without a normal distribution. Ranksum was used to compare CRP values in those with positive throat swabs against those negative for BHS. Contingency tables were used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of CRP to detect GAS against no BHS isolation, and Wilson's method was used to calculate the 95% CIs for these estimates. Fisher's exact test was used to estimate the correlation between CRP values > 8 mg/L, Centor scores ³ 3, and FeverPAIN scores ³ 4 and GAS detection compared with no BHS isolation because of low numbers per category. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Analyses were conducted using STATA 15 (College Station, TX). Analyses were conducted on the full dataset without imputing missing data.
