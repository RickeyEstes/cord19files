TMSBr (330 mL) was added to the mixture of 4 (117 mg, 0.33 mmol) in dry pyridine (4 ml) and DMF (1 ml). The reaction mixture was stirred at 25 C for 16 h. Volatiles were removed and the moisture-sensitive product was permanently kept under argon. Solid isopropyl ester L-phenylalanine hydrochloride (330 mg, 1.4 mmol) was added to the silylated intermediate under argon, followed by dry pyridine (5 ml) and dry Et 3 N (660 ml, 4.7 mmol). The mixture was preheated to 70 C and freshly prepared solution of aldrithiol-2 (0.45 g, 2.0 mmol) and triphenylphosphine (0.54 g, 2.0 mmol) in pyridine (4 ml) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred at 70 C for 72 h. Reaction mixture was evaporated in vacuo and the residue was purified by column chromatography (0-100% MeOH in a mixture of Hexane:EtOAc, 6:4) followed by C18 reversed phase column chromatography (0-100% MeOH in water) to give 20 (30 mg, 13%) as an amorphous white solid. ((2-(2,6-Dioxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-9H-purin-9-yl)ethoxy) methyl)phosphonic diphosphoric anhydride (21) . PMEX morpholidate: Morpholine (0.35 mL, 4.0 mmol) was added to a mixture of 4 (360 mg, 1.0 mmol) in t-BuOH/ H 2 O (35 mL, 2.5/1, v/v) preheated to 100 C. Then, a solution of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (825 mg, 4.0 mmol) in t-BuOH/H 2 O (48 mL, 5/1, v/v) was added dropwise to the boiling reaction mixture over a period of 1 h.

The compounds were evaluated against different herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) strain KOS, thymidine kinase-deficient (TK-) HSV-1 KOS strain resistant to ACV (ACV r ), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) strain G, VZV strain Oka, TK-VZV strain 07-1, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) strains AD-169 and Davis as well as vaccinia virus, adeno virus-2, vesicular stomatitis virus, para-influenza-3 virus, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, Punta Toro virus, RSV, FIPV and influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 (A/PR/8), H3N2 (A/ HK/7/87) and influenza B virus (B/HK/5/72). The antiviral assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey kidney cells (Vero), human epithelial cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa), Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells (CRFK), or Madin Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 PFU, and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virusinfected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or compound concentration required reducing virus-induced cytopathicity or viral plaque formation by 50%. Compound 4 was evaluated against several TK and DNA polymerase mutants derived from the reference Kos strain by CPE reduction assay using as reference drugs ACV, GCV, BVDU, foscavir, CDV and adefovir (ADV). Cytotoxicity of the tested compounds was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration or the compound concentration that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology. Alternatively, the cytostatic activity of the test compounds was measured based on the inhibition of cell growth. HEL cells were seeded at a rate of 5 Â 10 3 cells/ well into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to proliferate for 24 h. Then, medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds was added. After three days of incubation at 37 C, the cell number was determined with a Coulter counter. The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC 50 , or the compound concentration required reducing cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls. The inhibitory effects of PMEXpp on human (a and b) and viral (VZV and HCMV) DNA polymerases were determined as previously described using activated calf thymus DNA, 100 mM of each of the three unlabeled dNTPs, and 0.5 mM of the rate limiting tritiumlabeled dNTP, and serial dilutions of PMEXpp (21) . Foscarnet pyrophosphate and acyclovir triphosphate (ACV-TP) were included as the reference compound. The 50% inhibitory concentration or compound concentration required to inhibit the polymerase-catalyzed DNA synthesis by 50% was then determined.
