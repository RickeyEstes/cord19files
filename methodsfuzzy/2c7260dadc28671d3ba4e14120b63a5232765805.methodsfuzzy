An anonymous cross-sectional survey was distributed among domestic pilgrims present in Mina, a tent city, and a main Hajj site on the outskirts of Makkah, and among overseas pilgrims who were staying in Aziziyah (before moving to tents in Mina), a borough of Makkah, adjacent to Mina, during the Hajj seasons of 2017 and 2018. The proportion of participants responding to each question was reported. To measure the association between predictors and vaccine uptake, odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) based on the risk estimate statistics were calculated. Pearson's chi-squared test was used to compare categorical variables and determine associations and correlations. For questions evaluating sources of pre-Hajj health advice and reasons for non-receipt of the vaccine, one sample nonparametric test (Jeffreys interval) was used to report the proportion of participants providing each response and the 95% CI for the point estimate. All those who declared previous receipt of the vaccine, regardless of the year of vaccination, were considered as vaccinated; further analysis was done to determine the adherence to the vaccine policy time window. Participants who were unsure about their vaccination history were excluded from the analysis in the OR calculation. A p-value â‰¤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS TM ) for Windows TM v.25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
