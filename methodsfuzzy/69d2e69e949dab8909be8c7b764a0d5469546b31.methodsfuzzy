Following the identification of the most stable reference genes from the full gene panel of 16 genes, the comparative C T method was used to validate their suitability. The comparative C T method, also referred to as the ΔΔC T method, is a relative quantitation of gene expression between a specific target gene and a reference gene. For the comparative C T method to be valid, the efficiency of the target amplification and the efficiency of the reference (internal control) amplification must be approximately equal, and this must be determined in a validation experiment. To this end, we first determined the amplification efficiency of 10 target genes (CDR1, PDH1, PDR1, SNQ2, YOR1, ERG2, ERG3, ERG4, ERG10, and ERG11) and six reference genes (ACT1, PGK1, RDN5.8, RDN18, UBC7, and UBC13). Standard curves were generated by plotting the dilutions of the cDNA of each gene against the C T values. The linear correlation coefficient (r 2 ) for all 10 target genes and the six reference genes ranged from 0.98 to 1.0. Based on these slopes of the standard curves, the amplification efficiencies of the cDNA standards, derived from the formula E = (10 −1/slope −1) × 100, ranged from 94 to 119%. The C T values of all 16 genes in the samples were within the range of the standard curves. Next, the ΔC T (ΔC T = C T target − C T reference ) was calculated using the C T values generated from standard curve mass points (target vs. reference gene). These ΔC T values were then plotted versus log 10 input amount of cDNA to create a semi-log regression line. The slope of the resulting semi-log regression line was used as a general criterion for passing a validation experiment. In a validation experiment that passes, the absolute value of the slope of ΔC T versus log 10 input cDNA would be <0.1, meaning the two C T versus log 10 concentration curves are nearly parallel. As seen in Table 5 , our validation experiments passed for all reference genes analyzed except RDN18, which had an absolute value >0.1 for the slopes of ΔC T versus log 10 input cDNA for all 10 target genes evaluated. Thus, the amplification efficiency of RDN18 was clearly different from that of the ten target genes, whereas the other five reference genes (ACT1, Each value is the slope m of the line (Y = mx + b) of the validation experiment and reflects the correlation of reference gene and target gene amplification efficiencies. An absolute slope value <0.1 is generally used as a criterion for passing a validation experiment, as it indicates that the amplification efficiency is approximately equal between the reference and target genes. The slope m = 0 indicates that the efficiencies of the two PCR reactions are equal. PGK1, RDN5.8, UBC7, and UBC13) had PCR efficiencies that were similar or relatively equivalent to the target amplification efficiencies ( Table 5) .
