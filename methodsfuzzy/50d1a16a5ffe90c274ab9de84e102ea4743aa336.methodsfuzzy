RNA molecules were prepared as optical tweezer constructs as described. 41, 42, 64 Commercially synthesized DNA oligonucleotides (Operon) corresponding to the RNA sequences studied here were inserted into the vector pBR322 (New England Biolabs) between the EcoRI and HindIII sites, creating a plasmid that was used to transform competent BL21 Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen). The plasmid was replicated by the bacteria and a DNA template for RNA transcription was removed from the plasmid by enzymatic digestion resulting in a template corresponding to the RNA sequence of the appropriate molecule plus approximately 500 DNA base-pairs on each side that correspond to the RNA sequence of the handle regions. The template was recovered by miniprep (Qiagen) and sequenced by the University of California Berkeley (UCB) sequencing facility. The DNA template was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) containing a T7 promoter sequence at the 5′ end, and sequenced by the UCB sequencing facility. RNA molecules were transcribed from the DNA templates by bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion). The RNA was prepared as an optical tweezers construct by annealing the DNA handles to the single-stranded RNA handle regions. DNA handle A (pBR322 bases 3821 to 3) was amplified by PCR and then biotinylated at the 3′ end using an exchange reaction by T4 DNA polymerase. The downstream primer used for PCR amplification of DNA handle B (pBR322 bases 30 to 628) was modified to have a terminal digoxigenin group. The biotin and digoxigenin allowed the RNA-DNA handles flanking the RNA sequence to be attached to a streptavidin coated polystyrene bead (Spherotech) and an anti-digoxigenin coated polystyrene bead (Spherotech).
