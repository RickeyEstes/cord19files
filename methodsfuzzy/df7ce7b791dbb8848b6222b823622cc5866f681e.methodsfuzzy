To estimate plausible ranges for R 0 , the Richards model [13] was employed to fit to data collected for laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 infection in a single outbreak. This type of modelling, which describes the dynamics of cumulative incidence of infection, has been widely used in the study of plant disease epidemics [14, 15] , and more recently for the epidemics in human populations [16] [17] [18] [19] .
