Isolation and culture of orbital fat-derived stem cells Isolation and culture of the OFSCs were performed as described previously [22] . All samples were removed with the written informed consent of the subjects and this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang Hospital. In brief, redundant orbital fat tissue was removed from the intraorbital cavity. Adipose tissues were fragmented, digested and filtered. After centrifuging the fluid, cells from the resulting pellet were plated in tissue culture flasks (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and maintained in Mesen Pro Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Surface phenotypes of OFSCs were positive for MSC markers (CD29, CD90, CD105) and negative for hematopoietic markers (CD31, CD34, CD45, CD106), and the trilineage differentiation ability of these cells has been checked previously [22] .
