Cells and Viruses. Huh-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium and 100 μ g/ml streptomycin sulfate and non-essential amino acids at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . Porcine kidney (PS) cells and BHK-21 cells were grown in the minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 10% FBS, Earl's salts and additives as mentioned above. SYF and SYF-Src cells were from ATCC. SYF-Fyn cells was described earlier 18 . JEV and DENV strains used in this study have been described previously 46 . siRNA transfection. siRNA library targeting the human tyrosine kinase genes were purchased from Dharmacon (Cat. No. G-103100). All transfections were performed by reverse transfection procedure as per manufacturer's instructions using Lipofectamine RNAimax reagent (Life Technologies). 10 nM of siRNAs were mixed with OptiMEM (Life technologies) and 1 μ l of Lipofectamine RNAimax to a total volume of 100 μ l in a 24-well plate. Cells were trypsinized and volume made up so as to contain 40,000 cells in 400 μ l antibiotic-free medium. After 20 min incubation of the transfection complex, 400 μ l cell suspension was added into each well. Each siRNA transfection was performed in triplicates. A group of 10 siRNAs were used for each set of experiments. Knock-down levels were monitored by RT-PCR at 48 h post-transfection from a representative siRNA for each set of experiments and we consistently observed a reduction of 80% or more in the mRNA levels of the target genes under these conditions. Plasmids and Antibodies. Csk plasmid constructs used in this study were a kind gift from Lars Rönnstrand 22 . Csk (rabbit) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-286) and mouse monoclonal Csk parametric, Mann-Whitney test. Size of pre-stained molecular weight marker band is indicated. (B) (i) Huh-7 cells were infected with DENV2 and cells were incubated in medium containing 5 μ M of PKA inhibitor, H-89, or DMSO (vehicle control). Viral titers in the supernatant was measured by plaque assays at 24 h pi. (ii) RT-PCR analysis to measure the DENV RNA in total RNA isolated at 24 h pi from Huh-7 cells infected with DENV2 and treated with DMSO or H-89 post-infection. The data are representative of at least three experiments performed with two or more replicates and indicate mean with SEM. P value was calculated by non-parametric, Mann-Whitney test. (iii) Huh-7 cells were incubated in medium containing 5 μ M of PKA inhibitor, H-89, or DMSO (vehicle control) and cell proliferation assay was performed at 24 h post-transfection. UT-Untreated. Error bars represent mean with SEM. (C) Huh-7 cells were mock-infected or infected with DENV2 and treated with DMSO or 5 μ M of H-89 from 1 h pi. Csk was immunoprecipitated at 24 h pi and phospho-Csk was detected by western blot analysis with antibody specific to CSK-pSer364. The amount of total Csk pulled down in immunoprecipitation is shown. Total Csk and DENV-NS3 in the cell lysates is shown. GAPDH levels are shown as loading control. Size of pre-stained molecular weight marker band is indicated. Scientific RepoRts | 6:30490 | DOI: 10.1038/srep30490 antibody was from BD Transduction Labs (Cat. No. 610079). Rabbit phospho-Csk (p-serine 364) antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich (Cat. No. SAB4503861). Src antibody was from Epitomics (Cat. No. 3795-1). Anti-dsRNA antibody (J2) was from Scicons. β -actin (catalogue number A2228) and anti-FLAG antibodies was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Cat. No. F7425). Tubulin antibody was purchased from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu), DENV Capsid and NS3 antibody has been described before 46, 47 , GAPDH antibody was purchased from Abcam (Cat. No. AB37168). Horseradish peroxide (HRP)-conjugated IgG raised in goat was used as secondary antibody (Santa Cruz or Life technologies) in western blotting. Viral titers, real time PCR and western blotting. Virus growth curve experiments were performed in Huh-7 cells and viral titers in the culture supernatants were determined by plaque assays on BHK-21 cells (for DENV) or porcine kidney cells (for JEV) as described previously 46 . Viral entry assays were performed by infecting cells with 5 pfu/cell of DENV-2. Cells were collected by trypsinization at 1 h pi in complete medium. For quantitation of RNA, cells were washed once with PBS and collected in 250 μ l of Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) for isolation of total RNA. Real time PCRs were performed by using one-step or two-step methods using SYBR green or Taqman chemistry as described previously 46 . For immunoblotting, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH-8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC) (Roche). Supernatants obtained after centrifugation at 17,000× g were used for loading onto SDS-PAGE and analysed by western blotting as described previously 48 . Immunoprecipitation. Huh-7 cells were infected with DENV2 at an MOI of 5 pfu/cell. Infected cell lysates were prepared at 24 h and 48 h pi in phosphobuffer (Calbiochem) containing PIC and PMSF. Lysates were pre-cleared for non-specific antibody interaction by incubating with rabbit IgG and 30 μ l of pre-washed protein A beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Pre-cleared lysates were further incubated with polyclonal Csk antibody overnight at 4 °C. Antigen-antibody complexes were pulled down using protein-A beads and detected by immunoblotting using phospho-Csk-S364 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Total Csk immunoprecipitation was quantitated by western blotting with mouse monoclonal Csk antibody.
