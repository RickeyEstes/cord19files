The two reference methods used in France, described by Humbert and Morvan (2001a,b) for organ and environmental samples, respectively, were used. Briefly, samples were diluted 1/5 to 1/10 in buffered peptone water (BPW) and incubated at 37 8C for 16-20 h for pre-enrichment. Then, samples were enriched on two different selective media: MÃ¼ller-Kauffmann tetrathionate broth (1/10 rate of inoculation), incubated at 42 8C for 18-24 h and at choice of the diagnostic laboratory: Rappaport-Vassiliadis (1/100 rate of inoculation -incubated at 42 8C for 18-24 h), or Selenite-Cystine (1/10 rate of inoculation -incubated at 37 8C for 18-24 h), or modified semi-solid Rappaport-Vassiliadis medium (MSRV). The latter was surface inoculated with 0.1 mL of the pre-enrichment (divided in three drops) then incubated at 42 8C for an initial period of 18-24 h, followed by an additional period of 18-24 h if no migration appeared after the first incubation period. Each selective enrichment medium must be isolated on one of the four following solid media: Rambach, SMID, Xylose-Lysine-Tergitol 4 or Hektoen agars. Each agar was incubated at 37 8C for 24 h, followed by 24 h more if no characteristics colonies had appeared after the first incubation period. MSRV was isolated only if a characteristic migration was observed. Two characteristic colonies by plate were biochemically identified and serotyped.
