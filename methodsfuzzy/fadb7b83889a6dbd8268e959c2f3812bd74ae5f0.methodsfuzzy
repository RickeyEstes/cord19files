The echolocation system, which is the main recognition ability of Microchiroptera, has been reported frequently [28] [29] [30] . The cognitive methods of two suborders within Chiroptera are completely different, i.e. Microchiroptera uses mainly echolocation, and Megachiroptera uses visual perception. In the former all fibers of the optic nerve entered into the contralateral optic tract, however, in the ARTICLE IN PRESS latter the optic nerve connect to both contrarateral and ipsilateral superior colliculus, being similar to the projection pattern of primates. Thus, we investigated on the optical system of R. aegyptiacus and structure of their retina in comparison with those of Michrochiroptera. In the funduscopy finding of the eye balls of Egyptian rousette, there were large numbers of tiny spots, which scatter onto the whole retina except for the optic disc. This peculiar structure could not be observed onto other animals' retina including small bats. Although blood vessels distributed from the optic nerve papilla are observed in the retina of other mammals, in the case of rousette retina, the blood vessels were not observed at all. By the histological examination, rousette retina had a papillary structure between outer granular layer and retinal pigment epithelium, unlike other animals' smooth-layered retina including small bats. In the immunohistological examinations, rhodopsin could be detected from the outer segment of the internal photoreceptor matrix (IPM) to outer nuclear layer (ONL) but mainly in the outer segment of IPM, and recoverin-positive cells were detected from inner segment of IPM to ONL. Although both recoverin and rhodopsin proteins were expressed in the same area as those in the rat retina, the ratio of rhodopsin-positive area to that of recoverin in the Egyptian rousette retina was wider than that in rat retina (Fig. 2) .
