Household contacts will be confirmed to be influenza-free at the first household visit, within 36 hours of recruitment of the index case. In the main study, clinical influenza is defined as the presence of at least two of the following symptoms: feverishness (we will strongly encourage household members to use the supplied thermometer to assess whether a fever is ≥38°C); cough; headache; sore throat; pain in muscles or joints (following [24] ). In the pilot study (as per the initial protocol), clinical influenza is defined as the presence of feverishness, or at least two of the following symptoms: cough; sore throat; nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, or sneezing; fatigue; headache; stiffness; myalgias. In the main study during the follow-up period of 7 days after recruitment of the index case, the index case and all household contacts will be asked to maintain a daily record of their symptoms (questionnaire Q3, appendix) and their tympanic temperature. A nurse will visit the household on three occasions during follow-up, namely 3 and 6 days after the initial home visit (day 0) with a window period of ±1 day. During each visit the nurse will collect nose swabs and throat swabs from the index case and all household contacts. These will be cryopreserved at the Department of Microbiology HKU as soon as possible as decribed in 4(n). The nose swabs and throat swabs taken during the follow-up visits will provide independent confirmation of the presence or absence of influenza virus in all household contacts, and the duration of viral shedding in the index case. In the pilot study the follow-up period will be 10 days, with visits on days 0, 3, 6 and 9. The primary endpoint of our study will compare the SAR in each of the intervention groups with the control intervention. We will use χ 2 tests and odds ratios adjusting for potential within-household correlation, with a 5% type I error rate. The characteristics of households, index cases and household contacts in the three intervention groups will be compared and assessed for similarity with χ 2 tests, adjusting the comparison of household contacts for potential within-household correlation. In the primary analyses, households will only be included if the index case has laboratory-confirmed influenza infection -all other households will be dropped from the primary analysis. Furthermore, in the main study households will be dropped from the primary analysis if any of the household contacts are found to have laboratory-confirmed influenza infection at baseline although this will not be incorporated in analyses for the pilot study as per the original protocol. Therefore our results will not be biased by the potentially different transmission dynamics of other respiratory diseases compared to influenza A or B, or by the potential for more than one index case in a household when the interventions are applied. The primary endpoint of our study will compare the SAR in each of the intervention groups with the placebo intervention (1). We will use χ 2 tests and odds ratios adjusting for potential within-household correlation [25] , with a 5% type I error rate. We will investigate the efficacy of the interventions on the SAR in multivariable logistic regression models with a generalized estimating equations approach to allow for potential within-household correlation [26] . Analysis will first be performed including only the effects of masks and hand hygiene. Further analyses will allow for the effects of potential confounders on the SAR. Confounders of the SAR that we will assess for each household contact include the age, gender, smoking status, chronic disease status, prior vaccination status, and additionally the age and gender of the corresponding index case. We will investigate the intervention effect in age/gender subgroups, although the statistical power for these analyses is unlikely to be high. We will further investigate the intervention effect in households where the intervention was applied sooner (with 36 hours) after symptom onset in the index case. We will further investigate the intervention effects for influenza A and influenza B separately, although with likely lower incidence the statistical power for the latter may be low. We will also assess the adherence of the index case and household contacts to the interventions, and conduct as-treated analyses of the primary outcome measure. We will conduct sensitivity analyses excluding households where the index case was prescribed antiviral medication, since onward transmission may be less likely in this scenario.
