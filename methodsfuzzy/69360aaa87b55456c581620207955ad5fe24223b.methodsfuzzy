Protein expression and purification. The R140Q, D44N and D124N mutant variants of subunit a were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the megaprimer method 35 . The fusion protein a-c/2-c, consisting of subunit a, transmembrane helix II of subunit c, and then a complete subunit c linked in a head-to-tail fashion (Fig. 1C) , was further modified to prevent spectral overlap between the signals of the arginine residues in subunit a, and the arginines corresponding to R41 and R50 in the loop region of subunit c. The corresponding arginines were replaced with lysines, and an internal KpnI site was removed in a chemically synthesized a-c/2-c gene fragment, which was then cloned into the KpnI and NheI sites of the pHP808 plasmid 22 replacing the corresponding fragment of the original a-c/2-c gene. All the protein variants included an N-terminal hexahistidine tag for affinity chromatography purification. Subunit a and the a-c/2-c protein were constitutively expressed in the context of the complete atp operon from plasmids pBWU13-aN-His 6 33,36 and pHP808 22 respectively. E. coli strains C43(DE3) 37 and C43(DE3)recA − were used for expressing subunit a and the a-c/2-c protein respectively. The latter strain was generated by P1 transduction using BLR(DE3) (Novagen) strain as a donor. Protein purification and NMR experiments. Subunit a and the a-c/2-c protein were purified essentially as described previously 38 . Briefly, the E. coli cell cultures were grown on M9 minimal medium containing 15 N-ammonium chloride (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as a sole source of nitrogen to the late exponential phase. Cells were disrupted using cell disruptor (Constant Systems Inc., Kennesaw, GA), and the cell membranes were isolated by ultracentrifugation 39 . The F 0 complex was purified from the membrane fraction by the Schneider-Altendorf procedure 31 and dissociated into individual subunits by LiBr treatment. Subunit a and the a-c/2-c protein were purified by Ni-NTA chromatography with on-the-column detergent exchange for 1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (LMPG), and equilibrated in the NMR sample buffer as described 38 . The standard NMR samples contained 0.2-0.4 mM protein in 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 6.0, 0.01% LMPG, with 5% (v/v) D 2 O and 0.3 mM 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (DSS), added for frequency lock and chemical shift referencing respectively, in a total volume of 0.35-0.4 ml. The 1 H, 15 N-HSQC spectra were recorded at 45 °C on a 600 MHz or 900 MHz Bruker (Billerica, MA) NMR spectrometer equipped with a Cryoprobe and z-axis pulse field gradients. Water suppression was achieved using double pulsed field gradient spin echo 40 . Data availability statement.
