General R version 3.2.3 (R Core Team 2015) was used for data plotting and statistical analyses. All further scripting was conducted using custom scripts in Python 2.7.10 and Python 3.6.1 (https://www.python.org/) with the Biopython 1.66 package (Cock et al. 2009 ) and Tcl (http://www.tcl.tk/). Scripts can be found at https://github.com/la466/fourth_site.git. For statistical analyses, N denotes the number of genomes used and means are given with one standard deviation.
