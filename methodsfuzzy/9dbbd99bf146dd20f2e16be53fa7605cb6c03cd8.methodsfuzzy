In the event of a biological attack or natural outbreak, identification of the bioagent is critical to both containment and diagnostic choice of appropriate prophylactic therapy. Traditional methods for the detection of bioagents include culture, immunological assays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), PCR, and others. These methods are sensitive and specific, but they are typically used after the fact to confirm a clinician's suspected diagnosis. Pairing collection and filtration systems to these techniques lays the foundation for continuous monitoring systems that could give advanced warning of a bioattack, but many of the techniques mentioned here are cumbersome, requiring purified samples and hours or days to complete the analysis [25] . Lacking the biorecognition aspect of the other bioagents, mycotoxin detection relies predominantly on physical separation technologies, including gas-liquid chromatography (GLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and capillary electrophoresis [39] [40] [41] . HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry can achieve detection limits as low as 0.1 ppb [42] . The standard method for confirming a suspected tuberculosis diagnosis is smear microscopy with a sputum sample, a diagnostic tool that can be completed within minutes but with abysmal specificity (correctly identifies 30-35% of positive cases).
