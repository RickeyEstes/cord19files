In addition to conventional copro-diagnostic methods, various immunological and biochemical methods have been assessed or established, aimed at the specific diagnosis of infection. These methods rely mainly on the detection and measurement of parameters, such as pepsinogen, gastrin or specific antibody in serum, which might be indicative of parasite infections. Clearly, conventional methods of diagnosis (reviewed in Section 4) have some limitations, in terms of sensitivity and/or specificity. In addition, they can be time consuming and costly to perform. DNA technologies have enabled the development of new, sensitive and specific diagnostic methods that have found applications in parasitology. The ability to specifically identify and study parasites (irrespective of life-cycle stage) using DNA methods has provided new insights into parasite biology, epidemiology and ecology, and has important implications for the specific diagnosis, treatment and control of parasitic diseases (Gasser, 2006) . In particular, methods that rely on the enzymatic amplification of nucleic acids can overcome some of the limitations of traditional approaches (Gasser, 2006) . Methods that employ the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Mullis et al., 1986; Saiki et al., 1988) can selectively amplify in vitro target DNA sequences from complex genomes or matrices, and have led to advances in many areas of the biological sciences. PCR involves the heat denaturation of double-stranded DNA, followed by a decrease in temperature to allow oligonucleotide primers to bind (=anneal) to their complementary sequence on sense and antisense strands of the target template. Then, the temperature is increased again to enhance the enzymatic activity of a thermostable DNA polymerase, which extends the complementary strands from the primer sites. These synthesis steps are usually repeated 20-40 times in an automated thermal cycler, resulting in an exponential increase in target DNA copies. The major advantage of this methodology is that it enables the study of parasite DNA from minute amounts of template, which would otherwise be insufficient for conventional analysis. The value of this technology in the field of diagnostic veterinary parasitology lies in its ability to specifically identify parasites, detect infection and analyze genetic variation, which are particularly important, given the increasing problems of AR in parasitic nematodes (cf. Gasser, 2006; Gasser et al., 2008) .
