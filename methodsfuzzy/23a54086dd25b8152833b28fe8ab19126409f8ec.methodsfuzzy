2.1. Experimental design 2.1.1. Colostrum feeding and calf inoculation Newborn Holstein male CD calves procured from a dairy farm were removed from their mothers at birth prior to suckling and transported to isolation facilities within the first 4 h of life. The animals were located in individual isolation rooms under controlled conditions. Briefly, each animal had its umbilical cord disinfected with iodine, received an intramuscular dose of vitamins (Vitamin A, 500 U; Vitamin D3, 75 000 U; Vitamin E, 50 mg, BAGOAD3E, Bago Laboratories S.A., Bs. As., Argentina) and 80 mg of selenium (Selfos, Agroinsumos, Bs. As., Argentina), at entry. To prevent bacterial infections, the calves were maintained under antibiotic therapy consisting of 0.3 g per day of Gentamicin (Equi systems SRL, Martinez, Bs. As., Argentina) administered intravenously, and 1 g per day of Cefalosporin (Cefalomicina-BAGO Laboratories S.A., Bs. As., Argentina) administered intramuscularly for the first 10 days. Five to eight calves were randomly assigned to the following colostrum feeding groups: colostrumdeprived (CD); control colostrum (CC) and immune colostrum (IC). Colostrum-fed calves received 1 l of control or immune colostrum pool within the first 6 h of life. After the initial colostrum intake, all the calves were fed 2 l of milk without antibodies (commercial sterilized bovine milk for human consumption; Mastellone Hnos, Bs. As., Argentina), twice a day. All calves were orally inoculated between the third and fourth feeding (approximately 36 h after colostrum intake) with 20 ml of inoculum containing 10 5.5 FFU of virulent IND BRV, previously verified to cause diarrhea and virus shedding in 100% of inoculated CD calves.
