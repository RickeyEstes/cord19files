RdRps. This set went through several rounds of semi-manual curation whereby sequences were 859 clustered using UCLUST, aligned using MUSCLE (126), and cross-searched against each other 860 and their parent sequences (often, complete viral polyproteins) using PSI-BLAST and 861 HHSEARCH (127). Upon the results of these searches, the boundaries of the RdRp domain were 862 expanded or trimmed to improve their compatibility with each other. 863 All rights reserved.

Sites containing more than 67% 867 of gaps were temporarily removed from alignments and pairwise similarity scores were obtained 868 for clusters using HHSEARCH. Scores for a pair of clusters were converted to distances (the 869 d A,B = -log(s A,B /min(s A,A ,s B,B ) formula, in which d A,B is the distance between cluster A and B and 870 s A,B is the HHSEARCH score for the comparison of these clusters, was used to convert scores s 871 to distances d). The matrix of pairwise distances was used to make an unweighted pair group 872 method with arithmetic (UPGMA) mean (128). Shallow tips of the tree were used as the guide 873 tree for a progressive pairwise alignment of the clusters at the tree leaves using HHALIGN 874 (127), resulting in larger clusters. This procedure was reiterative, ultimately resulting in the 875 single alignment of the whole set of 4,640 virus RdRp sequences and 1,028 RT sequences. 876 During the clustering procedure, 50 virus RdRp clusters, consisting of 1 to 545 sequences, 877 were defined. These clusters represent either well-established groups of related viruses (roughly 878 comparable to the ICTV family rank) or, in case of poorly characterized and unclassified viruses, 879 groups of well-aligned RdRps that are clearly distinct from others. In all cases, uncertainties 880 were treated conservatively, i.e., in favor of placing sequences with questionable relatedness into 881 separate clusters. Additionally, RT sequences were placed into two clusters consisting of group-882 II intron RTs and non-LTR retrotransposon RTs. 883 For each cluster consisting of more than two sequences, an approximate maximum likelihood 884 (ML) phylogenetic tree was constructed from the cluster-specific alignment using the FastTree 885 program (129) (Whelan and Goldman [WAG] evolutionary model with gamma-distributed site 886 All rights reserved.

Trees were 887 rooted using a variant of the mid-point rooting procedure such that the difference between the 888 (weighted) average root-to-tip distances in the subtrees on the opposite sides of the root is 889 minimized. 890 To resolve the structure of the global relationships, up to five representatives from each 891 cluster were selected using the within-cluster trees to ensure the diversity of the selected 892 sequences. This procedure resulted in a set of 228 virus RdRps and 10 RTs. The alignments of 893 the selected sequences were extracted from the master alignment and filtered for sites containing 894 more than 50% of gaps. A ML phylogenetic tree was reconstructed for the resulting alignment 895 using PhyML (48) (Le Gascuel [LG] evolutionary model with gamma-distributed site rates and 896 empirical amino acid frequencies; aBayes support values). Another form of branch support, 897 bootstrap support by transfer (BOOSTER) phylogenetic bootstrap (130), was also used to assess 898 the reliability of the major tree divisions. Alternatively, the same RdRp alignment was used as 899 the input for ML phylogenetic analysis using RAxML (LG evolutionary model with gamma-900 distributed site rates and empirical amino acid frequencies). 901 RdRps in the global tree were divided into 5 major branches (supergroups). Up to 15 902 representatives from each cluster were selected to form supergroup-level alignments. Respective 903 trees were reconstructed from these alignments using the same procedure (PhyML tree with LG 904 evolutionary model with gamma-distributed site rates and empirical amino acid frequencies). 905 The overall tree was assembled manually by first replacing the supergroup representatives in 906 the global tree with the supergroup trees, and then, replacing the cluster representatives with the 907 cluster trees. The lower-level trees were rooted according to the arrangement of the 908 representatives in the upper-level tree. 909
