Briefly, the procedure for using the SPALS-based reader to assess LFIS results was as follows: First, samples were added to sample orifice. After the immunoreaction was completed, LFIS were placed into the SPALS-based reader and the resulting, transmitted light intensities were measured using the Light Meter App. Simultaneous to light intensity measurements, a picture of the LFIS was obtained using the smartphone's camera. Images were then analyzed using the free image analysis software Image J (NIH). Additional details regarding these experiments are provided in Supplementary information.
