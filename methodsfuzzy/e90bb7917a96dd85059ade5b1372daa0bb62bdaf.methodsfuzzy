We identified comprehensive constructs of stocks and flows, in accordance with Sterman's (20 0 0) suggestions for high-level model building, based on a semi-structured interview process. Then, we referenced previous transmission dynamics studies of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which reflects similar pertinent variables such as infectivity rate, the likelihood of an outbreak, and the impact of control measures (e.g., Anderson et al., 2004; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Riley et al., 2003 ) . Lastly, based on Wolstenholme's (1993) thinking system approach, we took effort s to sequence customized epidemiology investigation, specifically MERS-CoV case management, to systematically identify the status of each patient (i.e., susceptible or infected).
