We obtained from Genbank 51 SARS-CoV sequences isolated from infected patients at different times throughout the epidemic and included in the aforementioned published phylogenetic tree (He et al. 2004 ). These constituted the available, unique sequences from the 61 that were included in that phylogenetic tree. We extracted from each among the 51 patient sequences a 3767-nucleotide sequence encoding the Spike (S) protein. We aligned these sequences using ClustalX (Thompson et al. 1997) and determined stepwise genetic distances between sequentially emerging strains (i.e. according to the phylogenetic tree) to calculate substitution rates (nucleotides per site per day). We used the observed substitution rate variation ( Fig. 1) and independently published average mutation rates (He et al. 2004; Lu et al. 2004 ) to defi ne a gamma distribution function (e.g. Golding, 1983) relating time (days) to expected genetic distance (substitutions per site). We used this gamma function (α = 1, θ = 4, implemented using the function GammaDistribution[1, 4] + 0.18 in Mathematica (Wolfram Research Inc, 1988) ) in the computer simulation program to evolve sequences according to the phylogenetic tree, which was rooted by using as outgroups sequences obtained from strains found in civet cats (He et al. 2004) . Comparable results were obtained using one-and two-parameter molecular substitution models (Jukes and Cantor, 1969; Kimura, 1980) . Reassortment was unconsidered. The computer simulation program calculated Hamming distances between an hypothetical ancestor and the sequences; paired time points with these distances according to the phylogenetic tree; performed linear regressions; and extrapolated backward to 0 distance, to estimate origin times. We ran 1000 replicates and determined the median and 95% confi dence interval for the resulting distribution (Fig. 2) , which allowed us to estimate a representative index case date.
