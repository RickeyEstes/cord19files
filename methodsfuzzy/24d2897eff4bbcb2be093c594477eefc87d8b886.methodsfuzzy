The majority of methods currently used for the detection of foodborne viruses are based on PCR. These methods focusing on NoV and HAV with others under development are more sensitive and require shorter times for analysis than cell culture-based methods. The advantages and disadvantages of available methods for detection of human enteric viruses in food are described in Table 3 with more details on specific methods outlined in the section below. An ISO technical specification (International Standards Organization, 2013; International Standards Organization, 2017) for standardized quantitative and qualitative RT-qPCR detection of NoV and HAV in food matrices including bivalve mollusks, leafy green vegetables, berries, food surfaces and bottled water describes matrix specific protocols for virus extraction and a common RNA extraction method based on capsid disruption using a chaotropic reagent followed by adsorption of RNA to silica particles. As virus detection in food matrices is challenging due to physical and chemical properties of the food, the ISO method includes certain criteria intended to prevent false-negative interpretation or underestimation of virus quantity. A virus process control is added to measure the efficiency of virus extraction. The inhibition of target amplification is evaluated by adding an RNA control, e.g. mengovirus, to the RT-qPCR reaction. However, simplification of the standard, i.e. virus elution and concentration from various matrices which allow a high recovery, needs to be addressed. Direct extraction of RNA from berry surfaces by immersion into lysis buffer was efficient in detecting some NoV surrogates on artificially contaminated berries (Perrin et al., 2015) . A further step towards complete validation, however, requires demonstrated detection of viral pathogens in naturally contaminated samples and comparison of performance between laboratories. The major issue when analyzing food matrices is the difficulty of detecting low levels of virus due to limited sample size, and the availability of the ISO method should not hinder method improvements or optimization.
