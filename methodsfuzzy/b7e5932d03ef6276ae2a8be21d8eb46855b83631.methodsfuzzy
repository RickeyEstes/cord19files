Cell culture 3D4/31 cells were grown at 37°C with 5% CO 2 in DMEM and RPMI 1640 (50:50). MARC-145 and HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum and grown at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . 30mm glass bottom tissue culture dishes were seeded with 2 × 10 5 cells 24h prior to transfection.
