If not stated otherwise all materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Bacterial strains. The virulent S. suis serotype 2 wild-type strain 10 (designated as wt) was kindly provided by H. Smith, Lelystad, NL 54 . The corresponding suilysin-deficient mutant of wt strain 10 (designated as 10Δ sly) and suilysin-deficient unencapsulated mutant of wt strain 10 (designated as 10Δ cpsΔ sly) were constructed as described in previous studies 35, 39 . In all infection experiments, cryo-conserved bacterial stocks were used and prepared as previously reported 37 . Streptococci were grown on Columbia agar supplemented with 7% sheep blood (Oxoid). S. suis strain 10cS148Δ sly (designated cS148) and 10cW461FΔ sly (designated cW461F) were constructed by chromosomal complementation of the S. suis suilysin-deficient mutant 10Δ sly by allelic exchange. The amplicon slyBamHI_SphI_cS148 was generated using oligonucleotide primers PM_sly_SphIfor (CCCGCATGCATGAGAAAAAGTTCGCACTT) and PM_sly_BamHIrev (CCCGGATCCTTACTCTATCACCTCATCCG). The amplicon slyBamHI_SphI_cW461Fmax was generated with oligonucleotide primers sly_pSET5s_SphIfor (CCCGCATGCAGTATAATACATTGCCAGAT) and sly_pSET5s_ BamHIrev (CCCGGATCCTATTCCGGAAATTGTTGGAA). DNA of S. suis wt 10 was used as template. The amplicons were cut with the restriction enzymes indicated in the name of the primers and inserted into the corresponding sites of pSET5s vector 55 . Oligonucleotide primers SLYcompSMfor (ATTCTCCAACAAGATCAACTGTTCGAACAGG) and SLYcompSMrev (CCTGTTCGAACAGTTGATCTTGTTGGAGAAT) encoding the silent mutation S148 in the suilysin gene and oligonucleotide primers slyTrp-Phefornew (TACAGGATTAGCATTTGAGTGGTGGAGAAC) and slyTrp-Pherevnew (GTTCTCCACCACTCAAATGCTAATCCTGTAC) encoding the W461 to F461 substitution were used to generate point-mutations by site-directed-mutagenesis according to the instruction manual of QuikChange ® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Ja Jolla, CA). Restriction analysis and sequencing was performed with pSET5s_sly_S148 and pSET5s_sly_W461F, respectively, to verify both constructs. The allelic exchanges for generation of 10cS148Δ sly (cS148) and 10cW461FΔ sly (cW461F) were performed essentially as described previously 56 . Final sequencing was performed to verify the resulting S. suis strains cS148 and cW461F, respectively. Porcine airway epithelial cell culture. Primary porcine PTEC or PBEC were isolated from the trachea and bronchi of pigs, respectively. Porcine lungs were obtained from a local slaughterhouse at Hannover. The animals had a good health status and no clinical symptoms. Tissue segments were washed with PBS and digested in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μ g/ml streptomycin, amphotericin B (50 μ g/ml), gentamicin (50 μ g/ml), 100 μ g/ml DNase (Roche) and 1 mg/ml Protease for 48 hours at 4 °C 23 . Primary PTEC or PBEC were harvested by scraping the cells from trachea or bronchi with scalpel, respectively. Cells were propagated in collagen I pre-coated flasks until they reached confluence with Scientific RepoRts | 6:26748 | DOI: 10.1038/srep26748 Bronchial Epithelial Cell Growth Medium (BEGM), as previously described 57, 58 with some modifications, which is Bronchial Epithelial Cell basal Medium (BEBM, Lonza) supplemented with the required additives (Sigma). BEGM was refreshed at every 2 days intervals. Approximately after 4 days of cultivation cell monolayers reached 80% confluence and were subjected for further differentiation. Primary PTEC or PBEC were dissociated with trypsin (Life Technologies) and resuspended with Air-Liquid Interface medium (ALI medium), a mixture 1:1 of BEGM and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies) and 2.5 × 10 5 cells were seeded on type IV collagen pre-coated 0.33 cm 2 polyester transwell filters with polycarbonate membrane (0.4 μ m pore size, Corning Costar). Cells were then maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . After the cells reached confluence, ALI medium was removed from the apical compartment and cells were cultured under the ALI conditions, the PTEC or PBEC were cultured at least for additional 5 weeks for differentiation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . ALI medium in the basolateral compartment was renewed every 2 or 3 days and the apical surface was washed once per week with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, Life Technologies).
