Chicken Ia antigen, a cell surface molecule present on chicken lymphoid cells, corresponds to the human MHC II antigen (Guillemot et al., 1984) ; CEF do not express this antigen. To benefit from the high resolution of serological methods, this protein was investigated by Western blotting in order to demonstrate the enrichment of plasma membrane-specific proteins by the established protocol. In addition, this test could indicate alterations of the plasma membrane proteins by this isolation procedure. Proteins of cell homogenates and plasma membrane preparations were separated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and reacted with a monoclonal antibody directed against the chicken Ia antigen (Fig. 4) . The antibody bound to the non-reduced molecule with an apparent molecular weight of 55 kDa. A constant amount of protein had been loaded on each slot; therefore, the strong increase of chicken Ia antigen in the plasma membranes of lymphoid cells indicates the efficiency of the applied protocol. Specific activity of marker enzymes of the plasma membrane ((Na + +K + )-ATPase, 5%-nucleotidase) and endoplasmic reticulum (glucose-6-phosphatase) in the cell homogenates (ch) and plasma membrane preparations (pm), preparations of lymphoid cells from bursa of Fabricus, spleen, thymus and chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). Results presented as mean 9S.E. of three different preparations. a Specific activity = mmol/mg√óh. b Enrichment= Specific activity in pm/Specific activity in ch.
