Pathogen Abbreviations: PIAN, results from PIA analysis, using narrow sensitivity priors; PIAW, results from PIA analysis, using wide sensitivity priors; CI, credible interval; RSME, root mean square error. a Estimate is defined as the mean etiologic estimate across the 500 datasets. b Bias is defined as the difference between the mean etiologic estimate and the true etiologic fraction values used to generate the data sets. c Standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance across the 500 datasets. d Root mean square error (RMSE) is a measure of error, incorporating both bias and variance. RMSE is calculated as the average of the squared differences between the mean etiologic estimate and the truth for each of the 500 datasets. e Coverage is defined as the observed fraction of the 95% credible intervals that cover the true etiology fractions out of the 500 replications. f Average length of the 95% credible intervals across the 500 datasets. Table 2 . Output for simulation in Figure 4 presenting mean etiologic estimate, bias, SD, coverage, etc. Abbreviations: CI, credible interval; RSME, root mean square error.
