LEISHDNAVAX is an equimass mixture of five MIDGE-Th1 vectors, dissolved in sterile PBS. Each vector encodes one Leishmania antigen: KMP11, CPA, CPB, P74 or TSA, respectively. Their DNA sequences and expression cassettes of MIDGE-Th1 vectors have been described previously. 22 MIDGE-Th1 vectors were synthesized in a simple and standardized procedure. 18 Forty Wistar rats (20 per sex, Janvier Labs, Saint-Berthevin, France), 8 weeks of age, were allocated to single-or four-dose study groups with 10 animals each (five per sex). Animals received needle injections of 120 μg LEISHDNAVAX per injection (~5.3 × 10 13 MIDGE-Th1 vector molecules, injection volume 30 μl) i.d. at the dorsal base of tail, either once or four times in weekly intervals. Animals injected with a single dose were killed 24 h after administration. Four-dose groups were either killed 24 h, 14 days or 60 days after the fourth injection. Clinical signs were recorded before, 30 min and 4 h after treatment, thereafter once daily. Twenty-four hours after injection, a modified Irwin test 39 was performed on the single-dose group and on a non-treated control group to assess acute neurological toxicity of the vaccine. Throughout the study, mortality was evaluated once daily and body weight once weekly. At killing, animals were anesthetized deeply by isoflurane inhalation and blood was collected from the plexus ophthalmicus. Gross pathology was performed and samples of the following tissues were taken: blood, thigh bone marrow, brain, heart, kidneys, liver (Lobus quadratus), lymph nodes (Lnn. axillares, inguinales, mesenteriales), lung, thigh muscle, ovaries, skin of injection site, spleen and testes. To avoid cross-contamination with vector DNA single-use scalpels were applied for each sample. All other equipment was thoroughly decontaminated after each dissection. Samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80°C until processing. Quantitative analyses of DNA vector amounts were performed at IMGM Laboratories (Martinsried, Germany). Total DNA was extracted from Safety and tolerability of a leishmaniasis DNA vaccine O Riede et al ~20 mg tissue or up to 280 μl blood, respectively, using the DNeasy Blood&Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and stored at − 20°C. A TaqMan-based quantitative realtime-PCR assay was established and characterized using a standard curve of LEISHDNAVAX ranging from 10 vector copies per reaction to 1.05 × 10 11 vector copies per reaction with 200 ng genomic DNA from the livers of naive animals as background. Measurements were carried out with 200 ng of extracted total DNA in 384 well plates with a reaction volume of 20 μl on an AB7900HT instrument (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Primers (Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany) and hydrolysis MGB probe (Life Technologies) were designed to detect a consensus sequence present on each MIDGE-Th1 vector. The forward primer (5′-GTCGTTTAGTGAACCGTCAGATCA-3′) anneals to the CMV promoter region, the hydrolysis MGB probe (5′-FAM-TTTATTGCGGTAGTTTATCA-NFQ-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-GCACG ACTGCGTTAGCAATTTAA-3′) anneal to the intron. Limit of detection and lower limit of quantification of the assay were determined at 525 copies of MIDGE-Th1 vector per reaction (that is, 2625 copies per μg total DNA). All samples of extracted DNA were measured in triplicates. MIDGE-Th1 vector copy numbers were calculated according to the LEISHDNAVAX standard curve running in parallel on each plate and expressed as copy number per μg total DNA. Acceptability criteria of measurements included standard curve coefficient of correlation ⩾ 0.95 and detected copy numbers of No-template-controls below the limit of detection. In addition, the s.d. of the quantification cycle values of at least two replicate measurements had to be below 0.5, otherwise the measurement was repeated. Data from the repeated-dose toxicity study in naive mice were analyzed using Student's t-test for numerical functional tests (P ⩽ 0.01), Dunnet's multiple t-test for body weight, food consumption, hematology, clinical biochemistry and organ weights (P ⩽ 0.01) and Fisher's exact test for histology (P ⩽ 0.05), respectively. Toxicity data of the biodistribution study were evaluated as follows: parameters of the Irwin test were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U-test (P ⩽ 0.05) and normality of body weight data by Shapiro-Wilks test. In case of normality, an analysis of variance was performed with post hoc Dunnett's test for multiple comparisons; otherwise, a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc Dunnett's test was employed (P ⩽ 0.05). IgG levels were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, USA). Normality of data was tested with Shapiro-Wilk test prior to applying either two-tailed Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test to analyze differences between means of two groups (P ⩽ 0.05). To evaluate tolerability of the vaccine in infected mice, comparisons between three or more groups were made by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison's test with comparison between PBS and vaccine treated groups. Comparisons between two groups were made by an unpaired t-test assuming Gaussian distribution (GraphPad Prism 6). A P-value of o0.05 was considered statistically significant.
