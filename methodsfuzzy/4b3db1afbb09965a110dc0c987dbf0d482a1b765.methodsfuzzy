Forty-three patients hospitalized in The Department of Infectious Diseases and Neuroinfections of Medical University in Białystok, Poland were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups: TBE: patients with confirmed TBE based on clinical picture, CSF examination, serum and positive CSF antibodies against TBE: 16 patients (4 women, 12 men; age 27-80, x ¼ 52 years). NB: patients with confirmed NB based on clinical picture, CSF examination and intrathecal production of antibodies against B. burgdorferi (based on serum and CSF examinations): 16 patients (6 women, 10 men; age 27-75, x ¼ 48 years). CG: control group: patients with excluded CNS infection [normal CSF (no pleocytosis, normal protein concentration); normal acute phase markers]: 11 patients (5 women, 6 men; age 23-75, x ¼ 48 years). Blood and CSF samples were evaluated in all patients at the time of diagnosis (before treatment). The serum separator tube was used and samples of blood were left to clot for 30 min before centrifugation for 15 min at approximately 1000g. CSF samples were not centrifuged before routine analysis. Aliquots of paired CSF and serum samples were frozen and stored at 80°C until analysis for ICAM-1, IL-21 and IL-23. Pleocytosis, protein concentration (mg/dL), glucose concentration (mg/dL), and chloride concentration (mmol/L) in CSF were measured at the time of admission. The detection of anti-TBEV antibodies in serum and CSF was performed by ELISA method (SERION ELISA classic kits, Germany) according to the producer's instruction. Intrathecal production of anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies in CSF was assessed using EcoLine test (Virotech classic kits, Germany) according to the producer's instruction. Concentrations of sICAM-1 (ng/mL), IL-21 (pg/mL) and IL-23 (pg/ mL) were measured using ELISA kits (DRG Instruments, Germany). CSF and serum samples were assayed on the same ELISA plate. The study was approved by the Bioethical Commission of the Medical University of Białystok.
