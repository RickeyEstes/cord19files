The Chair reiterated the model of the structure of the Steering Group (SG), comprised of ten members, decided during the September 26, 2014 meeting. The GHSA SG will have three meetings this year: the second meeting will be in the summer and the third meeting in connection with the GHSA High Level meeting in September. Meetings will be organized in immediate connection with other meetings/conferences for synergy and minimizing travel burden. The placement and timing of the second meeting was discussed and a proposal to organize it together with the OIE Global Conference on Biological Threat Reduction, which will be held in Paris on June 30 th to July 2 nd was put forward. This proposal was supported by the GHSA SG members and the OIE representative. A provisional commitment by the OIE to host the meeting was received, pending confirmation from OIE headquarters (this confirmation has been received from the OIE leadership after the meeting). Steering Group members discussed a working model for the SG. The Chair proposed that each Steering Group member appoint at least one lead person to serve on the Steering Group Working Level Support Team (WLST), a virtual secretariat that will support the work of the Chair, the Steering Group and the Action Package leaders, as needed. The work will be done through electronic contact and teleconferences. The Team Lead for the WLST for 2015 in Finland is Ms Outi Kuivasniemi. Steering Group members were asked to get back to Finland with their nominations to the WLST. A shared internet working space -a collaboration portal e based on Microsoft Sharepoint has been set up to support the work of the SG, the WLST and the Action Package leaders. This workspace was introduced by Dr. Thomas Kenyon, Director of the Center for Global Health at U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The workspace enables sharing and cooperation on documents, facilitates scheduling and the exchange of contact information. Access can be granted to partners of the GHSA. So far only one fifth of the partners have accessed the site, and SG members are encouraged to register. The Chair noted that it is intended that the SG and Action Package reports and other key documents will be distributed through the collaboration portal. The link and instructions to gain access to the collaboration portal will be re-distributed among partners. 7. Key Action Items/Next Steps y Next SG meeting June 29, 2015 in Paris, France.
