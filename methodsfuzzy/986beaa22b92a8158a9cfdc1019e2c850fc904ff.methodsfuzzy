This was a systematic prospective study conducted at Severo Ochoa Hospital (Leganes, Madrid, Spain) to assess the incidence, epidemiology and clinical characteristics of respiratory viral infections that needed hospitalisation in a cohort of moderate and late preterm infants during the first year of life. 143 preterm infants born between 32 0 and 36 6 weeks were followed up by phone, and hospitalisation incidence due to respiratory viral infections was compared with the 1858 term babies born during the same period in our hospital. The enrolment period was October 2011 to December 2012. The study was funded by FIS (Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias ---Spanish Health Research Fund) Grant 09/00246 and approved by The Medical Ethics Committee. Parents were informed and consent was obtained.
