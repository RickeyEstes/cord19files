A mathematical model of MERS-CoV transmission in South Korea is suggested based on the model in Chowell et al [12] . It categorizes each individual into one of six epidemiological classes; susceptible (S ), exposed (or high-risk latent) (E ), symptomatic and infectious (I ), infection but asymptomatic class (A), hospitalized (H ), and recovery class (R). It is assumed that only infectious and hospitalized individuals can infect others and asymptomatic individuals cannot. In Chowell et al [12] , the actual data of the zoonotic case were gathered so they were able to take secondary cases as well as index cases into account. By contrast, there was no zoonotic transmission except the primary case in South Korea, thus we do not consider the zoonotic case of MERS-CoV model in the present study. The model takes the following form: where b is the human-to-human transmission rate per unit time (day) and l quantifies the relative transmissibility of hospitalized patients; k is the rate at which 50 Y. Kim, et al an individual leaves the exposed class by becoming infectious (symptomatic or asymptomatic); r is the proportion of progression from exposed class E to symptomatic infectious class I, and ð1 À rÞ is that of progression to asymptomatic class; A; g a is the average rate at which symptomatic individuals hospitalize and g I is the recovery rate without being hospitalized; g r isthe recovery rate of hospitalized patients. Using these parameters, we will estimate the transmission rate (b) and transmissibility of hospitalized (l ) in next section. In many epidemiological models, basic reproduction number is one of the key values that can predict whether the infectious disease will spread into a population or die out. It is the average number of secondary infectious cases when one infectious individual is introduced in a whole susceptible population. The basic reproduction number is calculated by the next generation matrix approach outlined in van den Driessche and Watmough [13] . As a result, the basic reproductive number R 0 for our model is: where the first term is the average number of secondary infected people from one infectious individual during his or her infectious period and the second term is the average number of secondary infected people from one patient during their hospital stay (the details of the derivation of R 0 are given in Appendix).
