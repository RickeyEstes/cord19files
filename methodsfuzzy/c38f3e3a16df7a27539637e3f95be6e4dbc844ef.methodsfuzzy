Nasopharyngeal specimen from patients suffering from respiratory illness were tested as previously described for the following viruses: RT-PCR for human coronaviruses (NL63, SARS, HKU1, OC43, 229E) as described below, RT-PCR for human metapneumovirus (Schildgen et al., 2004; Viazov et al., 2003; Wilkesmann et al., 2006) , RT-PCR and NOW ® RSV ELISA (Inverness Medical, Cologne, Germany) for respiratory syncytial virus , human influenza viruses A and B and NOW ® Influenza A/B ELISA (Inverness Medical, Cologne, Germany), and Human Bocavirus (Allander et al., 2005; Kupfer et al., 2006; Simon et al., 2007b) . Except for human coronaviruses all methods were described in detail previously (Allander et al., 2005; Kupfer et al., 2006; Schildgen et al., 2004; Simon et al., 2006; Viazov et al., 2003; Wilkesmann et al., 2006) . For the amplification of HCoV-specific sequences RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal aspirates with the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and subjected to a single-round RT-PCR (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) using a set of primers designed on the basis of comparison of pol ORF1b sequences of known human coronaviruses (Kupfer et al., 2006) . RT was carried out for 30 min at 42 • C followed by a PCR with one initial step of denaturation (95 • C for 5 min), 35 cycles of amplification (95 • C for 30 s, 50 • C for 30 s, 72 • C for 30 s) and a final elongation step (72 • C for 5 min). The primers used for the pan-coronavirus PCR were sv387as (5 -TCA CAY TTW GGA TAR TCC CA), sv388s (5 -ACT CAR ATR AAT CTT AAR TAY GC), and sv389s (5 -ACT CAA ATR AAT TTR AAR TAY GC) at final concentrations of 0.6 M each. PCR-amplicons with a length of 251 basepairs were electrophoresed on an agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. All positive PCR results, especially those that were positive for Human Bocavirus, were confirmed by sequencing. Other common respiratory viruses such as human parainfluenza virus, human rhinoviruses or adenovirus were not included in the screening panel.
