Virus. The Gn pig-adapted (passage 25) HRV Wa G1P [8] strain was used to orally inoculate Gn pigs as described previously (43) . Animal experiments and diets. All of our animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The Ohio State University (protocol 2010A00000088). All of the pigs were maintained, sampled, and euthanized humanely. Euthanasia was performed by electrocution following anesthesia. For this study, we used the lowest number of pigs previously shown to permit the detection of statistically significant differences among treatments (44, 45) . Near-term sows (Landrace ϫ Yorkshire ϫ Duroc cross-bred) were purchased from the Ohio State University Swine Center facility. Caesarean-derived Gn piglets were maintained in sterile isolators as previously described (4) . Nursing piglets may consume between 100 and 900 ml of sow milk, which contains 5% protein, 8% fat, and 5% carbohydrates (CHO), per day. To avoid differences in nutrient intake between different groups/litters in this study, the diet intake was restricted throughout experiments. We fed gradually increasing volumes (500 to 800 ml/day) of Parmalat (bovine whole milk containing 3.3% protein, 3.3% fat, and 5% CHO) to piglets in the sufficient-diet group to provide adequate amounts of protein and fat and increased amounts of CHO compared to the daily consumption of sow milk. Similar to the 50% dietary restriction described by Zijlstra et al. (46) , piglets in the deficient-diet groups were fed increasing volumes (500 to 800 ml/day) of Parmalat milk mixed with sterile water (50:50, vol/vol), which resulted in a protein content twice as low as that of the sufficient-diet groups. Prior to HIFM transplantation, sterility was verified by aerobic and anaerobic culturing of rectal swabs to ensure that there was no bacterial or fungal contamination. Additionally, all piglets were confirmed to be negative for RV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, calicivirus/sapovirus, astrovirus, and kobuvirus (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) . Neonatal piglets from eight litters (12 to 16 pigs/litter) were assigned to different treatment groups ( Table 2) 0.05% (vol/vol) cysteine and 30% sterile glycerol as described previously (52) . Pigs in the respective groups (Table 2) were orally fed 2 ml of the diluted fecal samples at 4 days of age. Pig weights were measured twice a week with a hand-held digital scale (Brecknell). At PTD10, pigs were infected with HRV (PID0). The efficiency of HIFM transplantation and the similarity of the microbial compositions of the original infant and Gn pig fecal samples was confirmed by 16S metagenomic (V4-V5 region sequencing) analysis based on open operational taxonomic unit picking by using the GreenGenes 16S rRNA reference database (2013-08 release) as described elsewhere (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) (53, 54) . Rectal swabs were collected daily (for 8 days) from HRV Wa-inoculated piglets (1 ϫ 10 6 focus-forming units [FFU]/dose) starting at PID0 to assess HRV shedding and to record fecal scores to assess the severity of diarrhea. The piglets in the early and late HRV groups were euthanized at PID5 and PID14, respectively. Blood, duodenum, ileum, and spleen tissues were collected to isolate MNCs as described previously (55) . Serum samples collected at the end of the experiment were submitted to Marshfield Labs (Marshfield, WI) and the Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI) to assess levels of protein/albumin/ glucose and vitamin A/vitamin E/selenium, respectively. Additionally, the midsection of the jejunum (10 in. long) was collected to isolate IECs by a modified protocol adapted from reference 56. Briefly, the jejunum was cut into small pieces (1 cm) and placed in a 50-ml tube with 20 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) and 2.5 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The tissue was agitated twice in an orbital shaker at 300 rpm for 15 min, and the resulting cell suspension was filtered through a metal cell strainer. The IECs were centrifuged at 500 ϫ g for 10 min at 4°C, and the pellet was resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) enriched with 8% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD), 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD), 20 mM HEPES (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD), 100 g of gentamicin (VetOne, Boise, ID) per ml, and 10 g of ampicillin (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) per ml (E-RPMI). The viability and numbers of IECs were determined by the trypan blue exclusion method. The IECs were stored at Ϫ80°C in 500 l of RNA later tissue collection buffer (Life Technologies, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) until further analysis. Additionally, one crossover experiment was conducted to evaluate the role of an altered microbiota in the development of clinical parameters of protein malnutrition (stunting/edema). In this experiment, HIFM passaged through protein-deficient pigs (dHIFM) was harvested after 4 weeks on a proteindeficient diet and transplanted into two groups of GF pigs on protein-deficient and -sufficient diets. HIFM passaged through protein-sufficient pigs (sHIFM) served as a control and was similarly transplanted into two groups of GF pigs on protein-deficient and -sufficient diets (n ϭ 2 to 4/group). Histopathologic analysis and immunofluorescent evaluation of villin expression by IECs. At necropsy, ileum tissue (5 cm anterior to the ileocecal valve) was collected. After 48 h of fixation in 10% neutral buffered formalin, tissue sections were trimmed, processed, and embedded in paraffin. Fourmicrometer-thick sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or used for immunofluorescent staining. After H&E staining, at least 10 villi and crypts in each section were measured with a computerized image system and VH/CD ratios were calculated as previous described (57) . After heat-induced epitope retrieval (60°C, 10 to 15 min), immunofluorescent staining to evaluate villin expression was conducted with an anti-villin goat polyclonal primary antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz, CA) and a donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (1:200; Abcam, Inc., CA). Villin-stained tissues were scored as follows: 0, no villin-positive cells; 1, 1 to 29% villin-positive villous epithelium; 2, 30 to 69% villin-positive villous epithelium; 3, 70 to 100% villin-positive villous epithelium. Reduction of villin-positive epithelium was characterized by lack of or irregular distribution and mildly to moderately reduced expression of villin in villous epithelial cells of the ileal sections. Microscopic images (ϫ20) were obtained with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70-S1F2). Evaluation of serum LPS levels. To measure LPS levels in serum samples from pigs, we used HEK-Blue LPS Detection kit 2 (InvivoGen, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA extraction and qRT-PCR to quantify of CgA, MUC2, PCNA, SOX9, and villin gene mRNA levels. Total RNA was extracted from IECs with Direct-Zol RNA Miniprep (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration and purity were measured with a NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). Real-time qRT-PCR was performed with equal amounts of total RNA (75 ng) and the Power SYBR green RNA-to-CT 1 step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). The primers for CgA, MUC2, PCNA, SOX9, villin, and ␤-actin were based on previously published data (58) (59) (60) . Relative CgA, MUC2, PCNA, SOX9, and villin gene expression was normalized to ␤-actin and expressed as fold change by the 2 ϪΔΔCT method (61). Flow cytometry. Flow cytometry staining was performed the same day immediately after the isolation of all tissue-derived cells. Procedures for flow cytometry staining to assess the frequencies and distribution of different innate immune cell subsets were as described previously (62) . Data acquisition was done with MACSQuant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec, Inc.), and analysis was done with FlowJo software (LLC). The pDC-enriched fraction (referred to as pDCs) was defined as described previously (39) . Frequencies/tissue distribution of CD103 ϩ MNCs were evaluated as previously described (31) . The frequencies and tissue distribution of apoptotic MNCs were assessed with annexin V Apoptosis Detection kit APC (eBioscience, San Diego, CA)/propidium iodide staining solution (eBioscience). The analysis and gating strategies were as described previously (39) . Additionally, NK cells were defined as CD16 ϩ CD172 Ϫ (SWC3a Ϫ ). NK cytotoxicity assay. Total spleen MNCs and K562 tumor cells were used as effector and target cells, respectively. Effector-to-target cell ratios of 10:1, 5:1, 1:1, and 0.5:1 were used, and the assay was done as described previously (63) .
