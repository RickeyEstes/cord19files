The most advanced structural data are available for M2 from influenza A [63] and Vpu from HIV-1 [64] based on NMR studies. Most recently X-ray [65] and solution NMR structures [66] have been reported on M2 which deliver bundle structures even in the presence of drug candidates. Also for M2 of influenza B, BM2, a structure of the assembled TMDs including the cytoplasmic domain resolved with solution NMR spectroscopy is at hand [67] . The channel protein p7 is so far enlightened by cryo electron microscopy identifying its potential number of assembled units per channel to be most likely hexameric [23, 50] , albeit heptameric assemblies have also been reported [68] . On the computational level there are many options to achieve potential bundle models. One of the options is that the protocol for assembly can follow in vivo pathways as best as possible. This is that the protein momoners are produced in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), diffuse within the ER and either interactassemblewith other proteins, such as host proteins, or assemble with each other into homooligomers. In the latter case there can be pathways in which a putative bundle or monomeric unit is assembled by simultaneously approach of all units (concerted pathway). Alternatively, and most likely, the monomers assemble in a sequential manner (sequential pathway). Table 1 Similarity of Vpu 6-27 [51] with respective toxin and non viral channel proteins: ClyA [52] , TASK [53] , KcsA [54] , nAChR [55] , GluA2 [56] , pLGIC [57] , pFC [58] , MscL [59] , 3a from SARS-CoV [60] and BST-2 [61] . Entry code in the protein data bank (www.rcsb.org) is given in brackets. 'aa' = amino acid; '*' = identical residues; ':' = conserved substitution; '.' = semiconserved substitution; '-' = no specification suggested; 'TMD' = transmembrane domain. The helices of the toxin and the non viral channels are named according to their respective sequence number in the literature. WFY single letter code. Most of the computational techniques adopted follow a kind of concerted pathways [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] . All potential TMDs are aligned and in a more or less fine grained step-width in respect of distances and angles. Conformational space is screened resulting in a moderate number of potential models. Ranking according to calculated potential energies allows the most appropriate model to be chosen also in accordance with all necessary constrains related with the general idea of a channel. In a more recent study the tetrameric M2 channel has been obtained from a replica exchange approach [75] . Also here an enormous amount of conformational space is screened which depend nevertheless on the initial starting configuration. In a more recently assembly method which is best described as a positioning approach combined with short energy minimization an extremely large number of structural models is achieved [62] . In this method positioning is done for the backbone structure of a specific helix. The backbone structure is derived from a classical MD simulation of the monomer or monomeric unit embedded in a fully hydrated lipid bilayer. All the structures from the MD simulation are due to a principle component analysis (PCA). The frames belonging to the first eigenvector of the covariance matrix are averaged and used in the assembly method. Positioning is based on a rotational matrix for the Cα atoms in which rotational symmetry, tilt and rotation is altered with an angle and step widths chosen by the operator. In the assembly protocol for each positioning the side chains are consequently 'attached' to the individual Cα atoms on the bases of the most probably configuration taken from the software data base (MOE, www.chemcomp.com). At this stage short energy minimization steps follow and the models are ranked according to their potential energy. Structural integrity [76] or ion selectivity [77] of selected models can be further assessed stressing MD simulation techniques. In the above mentioned assembly protocols all helices in a larger assembly, e.g. four or five helices, are moved, tilted or rotated simultaneously and in the same direction (concerted pathway). Sequential pathways have been so far rarely applied. It can be argued that it is most unlikely that all TMDs assemble at once. Most likely it seems that possibly two TMDs approach each other followed by either monomeric or dimeric TMDs and also oligomeric units. Along this line investigations have been conducted in which the alignment of the monomeric units of the three TMDs of 3a follows the so call sequential pathway (Hsu and Fischer; to be published). For most of the models a helical motif of the TMD is assumed. In another approach using coarse-grained techniques the insertion and consequent formation of the secondary structural element is left to 'in silico' calculations [78] . The formation is dependent on the quality of the force field based forces present in the environment of a lipid bilayer. Starting from a random structure outside the membrane Vpu from HIV-1 is seen to enter the membrane and adopt indeed a helical formation [78] . Simulations on other proteins such as glycophorin have proven that coarse-grained methods are reliable when assembling two TMDs from random positions. [79] .
