To evaluate the correlation between the immunochromatographic strip and reference methods, a total of 178 brain tissue samples were collected from deceased piglets with suspected PHE-CoV infection from several pig farms in the Jilin Province. A 500 mg of brain tissue was measured and homogenized, then suspended 1:10 with PBS, followed by centrifuging at 7000 Ã— g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected for testing by ELISA, the immunochromatographic strips, RT-PCR. The detection assay of PHE-CoV by RT-PCR were established as previously described [23] . The kappa statistic [24] and <0.40 represented excellent agreement, good to fair agreement, and poor agreement, respectively [25] . To evaluate the agreement between the immunochromatographic strip and reference methods, the 178 clinical samples from deceased piglets were detected by sandwich ELISA, RT-PCR, and the immunochromatographic Figure 4 The virus samples were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sample numbers 1-30 were negative and 31-37 were positive. A, a histogram of ELISA results from both positive and negative virus samples; B, SPSS 13.0 for Windows was used to create a ROC curve to evaluate the threshold value; C, the standard curve was drawn by CurveExpert software with the PHE-CoV concentration on the X-axis and the average OD490 value on the Y-axis. Figure 5 The optimal antibody concentration. The colloidal gold solution was made with different concentration of MAb 4D4. The color of the tubes without sufficient protein changed from red to blue, and when the amount of protein added to the tube exceeded the minimum needed, the color remained unchanged. Table 3 . Of the 178 clinical samples, 88 were positive and 90 were negative using the immunochromatographic strip, while 90 were positive and 88 were negative using ELISA and RT-PCR. Thus, the specificity and sensitivity of the immunochromatographic strip, as compared with ELISA and RT-PCR, were 100% and 97.78%, respectively. There were excellent agreement (Kappa = 0.976) between the immunochromatographic strip to ELISA and RT-PCR.
