Molecular modeling of MT-4/17-3-6 NHR-CHR complex. The initial model for the MT-4/17-3-6 complex was constructed by using of residue replacements on the coordinate sets 1AIK in Protein Data Bank [5] , a NHR-CHR complex X-ray model of MT-4/LAI. Structural optimization was performed for this model by an energy minimization method with an MMFF94 force field [24] considering water molecules within 10 Å around protein atoms. The energy cutoff distance was set at 10 Å and the dielectric constant was distance dependent based on the value of 1.0 for the protein atoms and 80.0 for the solvent atoms. The 1AIK X-ray model of MT-4/LAI was optimized for comparison with the MT-4/ 17-3-6 model by the same method. 100 ps molecular dynamics simulation was performed for each optimized model with the water molecules at 300 K by using a 0.002 ps time step, the MMFF94 force field and NVT method (number of particles, volume, and temperature were fixed) [25] [26] [27] . Before these equilibrium iterations, 1ps heating iterations were employed to consider the stable equilibration. The potential energy of each total molecular system after the 100 ps simulation was À5.85 · 10 4 kcal/mol and À5.67 · 10 4 kcal/mol, including 3233 and 3252 water molecules for MT-4/17-3-6 and MT-4/LAI, respectively. Hydrogen bond analyses were based on 100 conformations sampled every 0.5 ps during the equilibrium iterations from 50 to 100 ps, in which the potential energy seemed to settle down clearly. All operations and calculations were performed using a graphical package for molecular structure analyses, Molecular Operating Environment (CCG, http://www.ccg.com/).
