Survey of dental patients' saliva for AHS. The number of AHS commonly found in saliva was determined from saliva samples of 47 randomly selected general dentistry patients at dental school clinics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The mean age of the patients in the survey was 39.7 years; ages ranged from 20 to 71 years. Of the 47 patients, 24 were male and 23 were female. Each saliva sample was diluted 10 -5 and 0.1 milliliter was plated on sheep blood agar. The number of both AHS and nonhemolytic colony-forming units, or CFUs, on each plate was counted. Overall surface sampling methodology. We chose the swab-rinse method for all sampling because most of the surfaces encountered either were irregular in shape and unsuitable for replicate organism detection and counting sampling or were too large for the rinse method. [41] [42] [43] The swab-rinse method consisted of using a sterile cotton swab moistened in a sterile recovery medium to sample equipment and other surfaces potentially touched by contaminated hands. The entire digital contact area of a surface was sampled. The sampled surface was rubbed several times with back-and-forth strokes (about 3 to 6 centimeters long); then the swab was rotated, and the surface was rubbed with strokes perpendicular to the original strokes. The swab was broken off in a tube containing 2.0 mL of the recovery medium and transported to the laboratory for inoculation of culture plates. To prevent growth of the bacteria in the recovery medium, the samples were kept on ice until they were processed. Within one hour of their collection, the samples were taken to the laboratory and processed. Spread plates were prepared for each sample. Each tube was vortexed for 1.0 minute to release the bacteria from the cotton swabs. The spread plates were prepared by placing 0.2 mL of the sample in 100-millimeter petri dishes containing Columbia colistin naladixic acid, or CNA, sheep blood agar, an enriched medium selective for gram-positive organisms. The sample was spread evenly over the agar surface with a sterile glass spreader. The plates were incubated in candle jars at 37 C for 48 hours. After incubation, AHS colonies were counted. Isolates were identified according to the framework described by Facklam 40 and Facklam and Carey. 44 Three recovery media were used: trypticase soy broth, or TSB; letheen broth; and Dey/Engley, or D/E, neutralizing broth. After disinfectants dry on a surface, the residual disinfectant can be reactivated when moistened by the recovery media from the cotton swab. Letheen broth and D/E neutralizing broth contain ingredients that neutralize disinfectants. However, it is known that these neutralizing ingredients also can have bacteriostatic effects on, and some degree of toxicity for, the recovered bacteria. 45 Before the sampling in the private offices and in the general environment, we performed tests to determine which of the recovery media was most sensitive for recovery of AHS. Letheen broth effectively neutralized residual phenolic disinfectants and was less toxic to the recovered AHS than was the D/E neutralizing broth. D/E broth was approximately six times less sensitive than letheen broth. 10 Iodophors, chlorine and hypochlorites are sufficiently neutralized by the organic material in letheen broth, or other nutrient media, such as TSB. 45 TSB was even more sensitive than letheen broth when there were no residual disinfectants recovered in the sample. We chose TSB for sampling surfaces where disinfectants were not used, or where use was limited, because it is not toxic to the bacteria. Recovery of AHS from surfaces in the general environment. We evaluated the occurrence of AHS in the general-nondental-environment by sampling surfaces commonly handled or touched in a general medical clinic, an ophthalmology clinic and a barber shop. We sampled surfaces and the entire digital contact area of each equipment handle using swabs moistened with TSB. Samples were taken in the afternoon after the last of the patients or customers had been seen. The staff at the medical clinic used a phenolic disinfectant to clean the examination table between patients. Other surfaces were cleaned daily with detergent and water. Surfaces sam-pled in the general medical clinic included faucet handles, light handles, countertops and examination tables. In the ophthalmology clinic, a 1 percent solution of household bleach (5.25 percent sodium hypochlorite) was sprayed and wiped on all surfaces in the examination room after patients with eye infections were seen. The frequency of visits by patients with eye infections varied from daily to weekly. Otherwise, surfaces were cleaned with detergent and water. The ophthalmology clinic surfaces we sampled included the head adjustment handle, countertops, the scope adjustment handle, the lens adjustment handle, patient chair armrests and the patient chair headrest. Disinfectants were not used on a routine basis in the barber shop. Surfaces sampled in the barber shop included armrests, countertops, clippers, drawer handles, faucet handles, the vacuum/air blower handle and scissors. Microbial sampling in the dental operatory. Surfaces in the dental operatory were sampled before and after dental procedures were performed in a dental school clinic at the school of dentistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where licensed general dentists treated patients. Surfaces of equipment handles were sampled, including the entire digital contact area of each piece. Swabs used to sample surfaces that had been disinfected were moistened with D/E neutralizing broth. Surfaces sampled before the procedure were the handpiece base and holder, the air-water syringe handle and holder, the syringe water, suction handles and holder, the bracket tray handle and eyeglasses worn by the dentist. A total of 45 samples were taken, before dental treatments began, from surfaces that had been cleaned. We observed the entire dental procedure, noting and counting the number of times each surface was touched by the potentially contaminated hands of the dentist, the dental assistant or both. We also noted handwashing and glove changes. After the dental treatment and before cleanup, the same sur-1570 JADA, Vol. 129, November 1998 The tubes of recovery medium also were incubated and growth subcultured on Columbia colistin naladixic acid sheep blood agar. † No α-hemolytic streptococci, or AHS, detected. ‡ Counts of 1 to 9 CFUs were estimated when no growth occurred on the plates and growth was detected in the recovery medium alone.
