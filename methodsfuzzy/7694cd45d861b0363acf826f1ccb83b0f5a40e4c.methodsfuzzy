Samples. For this study, we chose a variety of sample types: plant leaves from Arapdopsis thaliana, human urine as an example body fluid, the Gram-negative bacterium Shewanella oneidensis, the cultured tissue cell line Calu-3, a unicyanobacterial consortium isolated from Hot Lake, WA, USA (26) , mouse brain cortex tissue, and the archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius strain DSM 639. Calu-3 cell infection with MERS-CoV was performed as described in Text S1 in the supplemental material. S. oneidensis, the unicyanobacterial consortium, and S. acidocaldarius cells were lysed by bead beating in a Bullet Blender (Next Advance, Averill Park, NY) with 0.1-mm-diameter zirconia beads at speed 8 for 3 min at 4°C, and the lysate was spun into a Falcon tube at 2,000 ϫ g for 10 min at 4°C. Additional lysis was done via pressure cycling technology (PCT) using a Barocycler (Pressure BioSciences Inc., South Easton, MA). The suspended cells were subjected to 20 s of high pressure at 35,000 lb/in 2 followed by 10 s of ambient pressure for 10 cycles. A. thaliana leaves were frozen with liquid nitrogen and mechanically disrupted on a mortar with a pestle. Mouse brain cortex tissue was homogenized in ice-cold Nanopure H 2 O at full speed with a hand-held Omni tool and a disposable probe (Omni, Kennesaw, GA) for 30 s, allowed to cool, and homogenized again. Extraction methods. Each sample was processed in 5 replicates using the following protocols. (i) Metabolite, protein, and lipid extraction (MPLEx). The extraction procedure was adapted from the method of Folch et al. (41) by keeping the same final solvent proportions; however, the monophasic extraction step was not performed, as water was initially added to the sample along with the chloroform and methanol to simultaneously extract and partition molecules into the three different phases. Cell pellets or lysates were resuspended in water, and 5 volumes of cold (Ϫ20°C) chloroform-methanol (2:1 [vol/vol]) solution was added to the samples. Samples were incubated for 5 min on ice, subjected to vortex mixing for 1 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. For the samples for which metabolomics and lipidomics analyses were performed, the upper aqueous phase and bottom organic phase, containing hydrophilic metabolites and lipids, respectively, were collected in glass autosampler vials. The interphases, containing proteins, were washed by adding 1 ml of cold (Ϫ20°C) methanol, vortex mixed for 1 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatants were discarded, and the resulting pellets were dried in a vacuum centrifuge for 5 min. (ii) Phenol extraction. Powdered A. thaliana leaves were resuspended in 10 ml of phenol extraction buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], containing 0.7 M sucrose, 0.1 M KCl, 50 mM EDTA, 2% [vol/vol] ␤-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride), and then 10 ml of phenol solution saturated with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was added to each tube. Samples were shaken for 30 min at 4°C and centrifuged at 5,000 ϫ g for 30 min at 4°C. The upper phenolic phase was collected into a fresh tube and washed twice by adding 10 ml of phenol extraction buffer, followed by centrifugation at 5,000 ϫ g for 30 min at 4°C, and discarding of the lower phase. The upper phenolic phase was collected in a fresh tube, and 5 volumes of 0.1 M ammonium acetate in methanol was added. Samples were incubated overnight at Ϫ20°C and centrifuged at 5,000 ϫ g for 30 min at 4°C. Protein pellets were then washed twice with 10 ml ice-cold methanol and twice with 10 ml ice-cold acetone by adding the solvent, centrifuging at 5,000 ϫ g for 30 min at 4°C, and discarding of the supernatant. The resulting protein pellet was dried under a stream of N 2 . (iii) TCA extraction. 10 ml of freshly prepared ice-cold TCA-acetone extraction buffer (0.61 M trichloroacetic acid-90% acetone) was added to powdered A. thaliana leaves, and the mixture was incubated overnight at Ϫ20°C. Proteins were then precipitated by centrifuging for 30 min at 5,000 ϫ g at 4°C, and the supernatant was discarded. The protein pellet was washed three times by adding 10 ml of ice-cold acetone, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 ϫ g at 4°C, and discarding of the supernatant. The resulting protein pellet was dried under a stream of N 2 . (iv) Acetonitrile extraction. Lysates were resuspended in 4 volumes of ice-cold (Ϫ20°C) pure acetonitrile and incubated for 10 min at 4°C to precipitate the proteins. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C at 12,000 ϫ g to pellet the protein. The supernatant was removed, and the protein pellets were dried by evaporation before digesting with trypsin. (v) Methanol extraction. The methanol extraction was performed with the exact same procedure as the acetonitrile extraction, with the difference that the organic solvent was replaced by methanol. Proteomic, lipidomic, and metabolomic analyses. The detailed methodology of proteomic, lipidomic, and metabolomic analyses are provided in Text S1 in the supplemental material. For proteomic analysis, proteins were digested with trypsin into peptides and analyzed using the accurate mass & time (AMT) tag approach (22) . Peptides were separated by nano-capillary liquid chromatography (nano-LC), and eluting peptides were directly analyzed using LTQ-Orbitrap Velos or Exactive mass spectrometers (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were identified by matching to the appropriate mass tag database, and the peak areas were extracted using VIPER (42) . Matching results were filtered with Statistical Tools for AMT tag confidence and uniqueness probability scores (43) . Lipids extracted from Calu-3 cells infected with MERS-coronavirus were analyzed by LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer as previously described (14) . Then, raw data files were analyzed using LIQUID (lipid informed quantitation and identification) software developed in-house for semiautomated identification of lipid molecular species followed by manual validation of identified species. Polar metabolites extracted from Calu-3 cells infected with MERS-coronavirus were derivatized with N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as described previously (16) . The raw data files were processed using MetaboliteDetector (44) and manually validated. Comparative analysis of different extractions. The proteomic analyses comparing the different extraction methods were performed by rolling up the intensity values of peptides into values corresponding to proteins using the R rollup function of Inferno RDN (formerly DAnTE) (45) . Only proteins with two or more peptides that were unique were considered for further analysis. The intensity values were transformed to log 2 values and submitted to standard paired t tests and G tests (46) (considering only proteins present in 0 or 1 of 5 replicates).
