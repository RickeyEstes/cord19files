The research settings of this paper were Phuket, Khao Lak (a beach resort in Phang Nga province), and Phi Phi Island (a beach resort in Krabi province) in the south of Thailand, where more than 5000 local residents and foreign tourists were killed by the tsunami on December 26, 2004 (See Figure 1 for location). This study used a triangulation of data collection (interviews, content analysis and survey). In the first stage, items in the questionnaire were derived from in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of one German news reporter, one Thai travel writer and one general manager of a Chinese inbound tour company at a press conference, as well as eight tourists (one German, one Belgian, two Mainland Chinese, and four Thais) who survived the 2004 tsunami. The interviewees were asked, with an open-end question, to identify travel barriers which would deter them and the people they knew from visiting the tsunami-affected beach resorts. The researcher recorded the responses from the interviews and selected the most frequent key words and used them to develop the questionnaire items. The items in the questionnaire were also the results of the content analysis of news reports about the 2004 tsunami on Thai tourism. The interviews and content analysis resulted in 14 travel barrier attributes which are listed in Table 2 . The instrument of this study was a self-administered survey questionnaire used to determine travel barriers associated with the tsunami-hit destinations. The questionnaire was written in three languages: English, simplified Chinese, and Thai. The questionnaire contained three sections: tourist behavior, travel barriers, and demographic profile. Regarding the travel barriers, the respondents were asked: What would deter/discourage you from traveling to the disaster (tsunami) affected areas? The respondents were asked to indicate the level of agreement with each of the 14 travel barrier attributes on a 5-point Likert scale, which ranged from one (strongly disagree) to five (strongly agree). A pilot test was given to 40 local residents and tourists in August 2005 to check understanding of the wording in the questionnaire. A panel of experts in the field of tourism checked the content validity of the instrument. The target populations were domestic and international tourists who were checking in for departure flights to destinations other than the three tsunami-hit provinces of Phuket, Krabi, and Phang Nga, at Bangkok International Airport in September 2005. In order to exclude residents and tourists to the tsunami-hit destinations from the study, two screening questions were included in the survey (Are you a resident of Phuket, Krabi, and Phang Nga? and Did you visit those places during this trip?). A single stage cluster sampling was used to randomly select domestic flights for which 500 passengers were waiting at departure gates, who were approached by five Thai and Chinese research assistants to participate in the survey. A field editing was conducted to check for the completeness of the questionnaires. The first step in the data analysis was to run descriptive statistics to determine frequency distribution. Secondly, an exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the underlying dimensions of the travel barriers associated with the tsunami-hit destinations. It was also used to construct summated scale scores for subsequent analysis. Finally, Multivariate Analysis of Variance was employed to determine how travel barriers vary between Asian and Western tourists and different demographic variables.
