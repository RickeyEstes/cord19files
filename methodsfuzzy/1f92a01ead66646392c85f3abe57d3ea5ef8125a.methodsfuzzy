Dataset. Viral genomes (5, 326) were downloaded from the RefSeq database 41 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ refseq/) in October of 2014. After merging all multiple-segmented genomes from the same virus, 4,300 genomes were obtained. Viroid and satellite data were excluded from the dataset, and then 3,905 genomes remained for this research. All genome data were converted to k-mer feature counts with Jellyfish software 43 . The dataset was also divided into four subsets by 25%, 50%, and 75% quantile cut-offs of genomic size in order to explore how optimal feature lengths vary by genomic size. FFP and phylogenomic trees. All phylogenomic trees were calculated based on FFP-based distance matrices 29 . All criteria, which are related to optimal feature lengths, were computed in parallel with Python 2.7. Phylogenomic trees were calculated from distance matrices based on the neighbor-joining method with the R package phytools 44 . All dendrograms were plotted by the ITOL online tool (http://itol.embl.de/itol.cgi), and the other figures were generated by R software. Fig. 10 , the optimal feature lengths were determined by three criteria: (1) from the individual genome perspective using CRE; (2) from a pairwise-comparison perspective: ACF among genomes; and (3) from an all-genome-comparison perspective: all observed feature occurrences in genomes. If multiple values of feature lengths were determined after this process, tree stability will be used to find the optimal length.
