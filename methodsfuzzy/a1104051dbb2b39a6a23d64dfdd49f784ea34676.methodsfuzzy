Expression and purification of SARS-CoV N protein SARS-CoV N protein expression vector was constructed as described previously (15) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells. Cells were grown at 37°C until A 600 = 0.7 in LB broth. N protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and the cells were incubated overnight at 28°C. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. Cell lysate was subjected to Qsepharose ion-exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare) and the flow through fractions containing the N protein were collected. The N proteins were further purified by Ni chelating affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare) and Sephadex G-75 (Sigma) gel filtration chromatography, sequentially. The protein concentration was determined by absorbance measurements at 280 nm in 8 M urea (the extinction coefficient is 43,890 M −1 cm −1 ) and by using a Bio-Rad protein assay system (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Preparation of random DNA library and PCR condition The DNA library consisted of two primer regions and a 45-base random region (5′-GCAATGGTACGG TACTTCC-N 45 -CAAAAGTGCACGCTACTTTGCTAA-3′), where N 45 represents 45 nucleotides with equimolar incorporation of A, G, C, and T at each position. The 5′-FAM™ labeled forward primer (5′-FAM-GCAATGGTACGGTACTTCC-3) and the 5′-phosphorylated reverse primer (5′-P-TTAGCAAAGTAGCGTGCACTTTTG-3′) were used for PCR. All PCR reactions were carried out in a volume of 100 μL with forward primer and reverse primer as follows. The PCR mixture (100 μL) contained 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 μM each primer, 10 nM template and 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase. The mixture was thermally cycled 30 times through 95°C for 1 min, 37°C for 30 s, and 58°C for 40 s, which was followed by a 5 min extension step at 58°C. All synthetic DNAs were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. ssDNA generation After PCR using the 5′-phosphorylated reverse primer, purified dsDNA was incubated with 25 U λ-exonuclease (NEB, Germany) in a total reaction volume of 50 μL at 37°C for 3 h (16). The reaction was then terminated by incubation at 75°C for 10 min. The products of the digested strand were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide/8 M urea TBE gel and the band was purified from the gel for the next round of selection. SELEX procedure Selection of DNA aptamers specific to the recombinant N protein was performed as described previously (17) with slight modifications. The initial ssDNA pool was heated at 90°C for 10 min, and immediately cooled on ice for 10 min, and then 5 μg of the DNA library was pre-incubated with 100 μL of Ni-NTA sepharose beads in 100 μL of binding buffer (50 mM Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1% (w/v) BSA) for 30 min at room temperature with occasional shaking. The nonspecific DNA-bead complexes were precipitated and discarded. The pre-cleared supernatant was then incubated with 2 μg of His-tagged N protein in 100 μL binding buffer for 30 min at room temperature and 100 μL of Ni chelating sepharose (GE Healthcare) was added. The mixture was further incubated for 30 min at room temperature and washed five times with 500 μL of binding buffer. The N protein complexed with DNA was separated from the Ni chelating sepharose by adding 200 μL of elution buffer (binding buffer plus 0.4 M imidazole). The eluted supernatants of each round were precipitated with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (PCI) treatment and then ethanol precipitation. Twelve sequential selection rounds were repeated using the same procedure. A more stringent condition was employed by reducing the protein concentration from round 8; 1 μg (round 8), 0.5 μg (round 9), 0.25 μg (round 10), and 0.125 μg (rounds [11] [12] in 100 μL binding buffer. After the 12th round, ssDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into a linearized pGEM T vector (Promega). After subcloning and transformation into E. coli DH5α, plasmid DNA FIG. 1. A schematic showing the sequence of the ssDNA library used for in vitro selection and the design of the SELEX procedure. A random ssDNA library was obtained by PCR, which contains 45 random sequences, using 5′-FAM TM labeled forward primer and 5′-phosphorylated reverse primer, which was followed by λ-exonuclease digestion. Ball symbol at the 5′ end of the forward primer represents FAM TM . After eliminating non-specific binding to Ni-NTA beads, the ssDNA pool was incubated with the His-tagged N proteins, which were immobilized on Ni-NTA sepharose beads. Unbound DNA was discarded, and bound DNA was eluted by the addition of imidazole. The DNA was enriched after twelve cycles of selection, and the selected DNA was amplified by PCR, cloned and sequenced. was isolated from individual clones and the DNA sequences were determined. Bioinformatic analysis by ClustalW2 was performed to align the multiple sequences of the aptamers (18) . The secondary structures of selected ssDNA aptamers were predicted using the MFold program, which was based on the Zuker algorithm (19) . Measurement of the N protein-biotinylated ssDNA aptamer interaction by ELISA 5′-Biotinylated aptamers were generated by PCR using a 5′-biotinylated forward primer instead of the 5′-FAM TM labeled forward primer. This was followed by λ-exonuclease digestion as described above. Ni-coated 96-well plates (Pierce) were coated with purified N protein (100 nM/100 μL per well) for 1 h at room temperature while shaking at 180 rpm. The wells were washed with PBST (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS; pH 7.4) three times and blocked with 5% BSA in PBST at room temperature for 1 h. After washing, various concentrations of the 5′-biotinylated aptamers were denatured at 90°C for 10 min, immediately put on ice, added to wells, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The bound aptamers were detected using a streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1:1000 in PBST, Pierce). The color developing reaction was initiated by adding OPD (o-phenylenediamine) solution (Pierce), and terminated by adding 2.5 N H 2 SO 4 . The absorbance of each well was measured at 492 nm using a TRIAD microplate reader (Dynex Technologies). Western blot analysis The purified N protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in PBST at room temperature for 1 h, and then incubated with 5′-biotinylated ssDNA aptamer in PBST for 1 h. After 4 washes, the membranes were incubated with streptavidin-HRP for 1 h. After washing, the membranes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reaction and exposed to LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare). The same experiments were repeated using His probe-conjugated HRP (Pierce) or anti-N protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) instead of the selected ssDNA aptamer to compare the efficacy of the selected aptamer with commercial antibodies. After the blotting, blocking, and washing steps, the membranes were incubated with His probe-HRP or Anti-N protein. In the case of incubation with His probe-HRP, membranes were visualized by the ECL reaction without further treatment. When the membrane was incubated with Anti-N protein, the membrane was also reacted with the goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP prior to the ECL reaction step.
