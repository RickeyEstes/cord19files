While several metagenomics protocols have been optimized, validated or published in recent years [8, 84] one study reported the use of Oxford Nanopore's MinION sequencing device for rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in a variety of biological specimens [85] . The authors tested their protocol against a mock community and a pleural effusion from a patient with empyema. Shotgun metagenomics results were compared between IonPGM and the MinION; 16S rRNA targeted-amplicon sequencing with IonPGM was also performed. Prevotella spp. which have previously been implicated in infections of the respiratory tract [86] were identified as the major taxon according to each sequencing methodology but undetected via culture. BLAST [87, 88] analysis against the GenomeSync database [89] revealed P. oris as the dominant species. Likewise, Streptococcus anginosus, was similarly reported via each approach and verified via culture. A second study also compared the application of CMg between two sequencing platforms, Roche 454 (discontinued) and Illumina's MiSeq on a nasopharyngeal swab that was positive to the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 strain [90] . Though differences were apparent in terms of depth and coverage, both shotgun metagenomics and targeted-amplicon approaches were able to detect the H1N1 virus as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae. While the interest in CMg is largely based on the ability to rapidly detect pathogens from clinical specimens, Langelier et al. [91] has also shown that it is possible to detect both microbial and human RNA to ultimately allow for concurrent transcriptional profiling of the host immune response hence permitting precision medicine and infectious disease diagnostics. This study included a cohort of 22 hematopoietic cellular transplant recipients with acute respiratory illness who underwent both bronchoscopy and BAL. Standard microbiological testing was performed including quantitative cultures, PCR and other diagnostic assays. BAL was subjected to DNA and complementary DNA (cDNA) sequencing via paired-end Illumina sequencing. Microbiological testing detected microorganisms in 7 of 22 patients, 6 of which were considered pathogens. Further, shotgun metagenomics also detected known respiratory pathogens in 6 patients with negative microbiological testing including human coronavirus 229E and human rhinovirus A. Interestingly, while common causes of CAP these viruses are not included on many respiratory viral PCR panels. Streptococcus mitis and Corynebacterium propinquum, both virulent pathogens were detectable in one patient. Several DNA viruses were also identified and analyses of cDNA shotgun metagenomics sequencing provided evidence of active replication for some. The host airway immune response was also evaluated; significantly increased expression of immune response genes was detected in patients with confirmed lower respiratory tract pathogens. Thus, this study demonstrates that CMg has substantial ability to accurately detect pathogens and these results can be utilized to inform the host immune response.
