The epidemiological model National cattle trade networks have been characterized by previous studies, which find that they have a fat-tailed degree distribution [21, 22] . The degree of a node represents the number of connections (edges) that this node has with the rest of the network. In networks with fattailed degree distributions, highly connected nodes (hubs) are more frequent than in random networks; the distribution of degrees is heavy-tailed with power-law behavior of the form P(k)~k −φ with 2 φ 3, where P(k) is the density function evaluated for degree "k". To study the spread of an infectious disease under different scenarios a fat-tailed degree distribution network is constructed following the characteristics of the French cattle trade network described by Rautureau et al. [21] . The trade network was constructed using the Complex Networks Package [23] with a power-law degree exponent φ = 2.15 [21] . To mimic the French cattle network (Table 1) , the nodes were ranked by degree and the top 0.04% were classified as markets, the next 0.54% as dealers, and the remaining 99.42% as farms. Each group (farms, dealers, and markets) is characterized by a probability of selling derived from the French cattle network and modeled as a random variable with a uniform distribution in order to capture some of the heterogeneity (Table 2) . A node is connected to the trade network in each period when it sells animals, which is simulated as the outcome of a Bernoulli trial using the corresponding probability of selling. Rewiring of the network takes place at each time period. We extend the standard susceptible-infected (SI) epidemiological model to incorporate features that are essential for our analysis: the efficiency with which infectious disease is detected and the existence of multiple channels of infection. In our framework, each node represents an agent involved in the cattle trade (farm, dealer, or market) and each agent can be in one of two states: susceptible (S) or infected (I). If detection is imperfect, there are two types of infected nodes: detected (I d ) and non-detected (I nd ), so the total number of infected nodes is I = I d + I nd . To adapt the model to vector-borne diseases an additional transmission channel must be considered. With vector-borne diseases, the infection can propagate through (a) commercial flows and (b) geographical proximity to infected nodes. The incorporation of both channels has been highlighted as a desirable feature for realistic epidemiologic models [24] . An additional geographic network capturing the risk of vector-transmitted infection of nodes located close to infected ones has to be taken into account. An overview of the baseline model for a susceptible node exposed to infection is illustrated in Fig 1. At each time period there are 4 stages. In the first stage the trade of cattle takes place. At this stage all the market decisions are taken, animals are traded, and susceptible nodes can be exposed to infection through the arrival of infected animals. Second, there is the infection stage in which susceptible nodes exposed to infection (i.e. directly connected to an infectious node) can change from the S-state to the I-state with probability λ. The probability of a node becoming infected depends on the number of infectious neighbors and can be computed as 1-(1-λ) N , where N is the number of infectious neighbors. After the infection stage the disease is detected with probability γ, which is equal to 1 if detection is perfect. Finally the control stage takes place, in which movement-restriction policies are implemented in two steps: first, the I dnodes are isolated with probability α; second, direct neighbors at the geographic network of infected and controlled nodes are isolated. Table 3 summarizes the main parameters involved in the transition between states. The transmission rate λ depends on the disease and may also depend on other factors such as cattle density [25] and environmental factors [13] , which affect vector capacity (ability of vectors to acquire and transmit pathogens). The detection rate γ depends on two factors: the characteristics of the disease and the efficiency of the detection tools. The former is associated with the length of the incubation period or the rate of subclinical cases while the latter may depend on the sensitivity of available tests. The parameter α reflects the efficiency of the authorities in implementing the MRP. Notice that the MRP isolates the nodes detected as infected as well as their geographic neighbors, which are considered to be those nodes directly linked through the geographic network. This simulates establishing a protection zone around the infected perimeter in which no infected animals have been detected but movements are restricted. The geographic network is simplified to a square lattice in which each node is connected to its immediate neighbors, so there are no hubs in the network. Both networks have the same number of nodes and are associated through a one-to-one mapping that randomly assigns the At the infection stage, the node changes to infected status with probability λ; otherwise it retains the S-status during the whole period. At the detection stage, an infected node is detected with probability γ and adopts the I d -status; otherwise it takes the I nd -status. When disease is detected the node is removed from the network with probability α. Nodes with I nd -status and those with I d -status that are not removed (I dnc ) remain in the network until the next time period when they are again at risk of being detected or removed. Nodes can be removed from the network if they are infected, detected, and effectively controlled (I dc at control stage I), or if they enter a protection zone triggered when any direct neighbor in the geographic network is infected and controlled (C at control stage II). node's location, which remains fixed throughout the simulation. The infection is introduced by infecting one random node in the first period and the spread of the infection is summarized by the number of infected nodes up to 300 time periods. Since the probability of selling was derived for weekly cattle trade networks, a time period can be interpreted as a week in this analysis. For each scenario explored, 300 simulations were performed using Matlab (MathWorks).
