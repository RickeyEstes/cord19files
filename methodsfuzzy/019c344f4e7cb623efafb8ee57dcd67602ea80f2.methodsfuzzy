A number of spectral methods have been developed for quantification of total flavonoids and DMY. The complexation of flavonoids with Al(III) is the principle of spectrophotometric assays used for quantification of total flavonoids (Naczk & Shahidi, 2006) . Simple flavonoids normally have maximal absorption between 220 and 300 nm (Owades, Rubin, & Brenner, 1958) . The maximal absorption of DMY was observed at~290 nm. The role of its C 2 -C 3 double bond, whose presence was responsible for the absorption bands in the ultraviolet (UV) regions (Biler, Biedermann, Valentova, Kren, & Kubala, 2017) . The UV absorption was also affected by the nature of solvent employed and the pH of the solution. High pH (above 11 for DMY) induced the formation of a long-wavelength peak arising from double and/or triple deprotonation (Biler et al., 2017) . Moreover, there was a possibility of interference by UV-absorbing substances such as proteins, nucleic acids and amino acids. Another spectral method Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) has been used for structural elucidation of complex flavonoids isolated from natural resources (Jeon, Chun, Choi, & Kwon, 2008; Wang, Xiong, & Perumalla, 2016) . FT-IR has been applied to analyze the isolated compound DMY from the bark of Salix hulteni. In a recent paper reported by Wang, Xiong, and Perumalla (2016) , FT-IR has been used for quickly distinguishing homochiral (+)DMY from racemic (+/âˆ’)DMY extracted from A. grossedentata leaves. The physicochemical properties of the two phases were also assessed using FT-IR. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) are also used for elucidating the chemical structures of flavonoids. Standard 1H , 13 C NMR spectra can give a wealth of chemical information for identifying flavonoids. MS analysis is based on ionizing chemical species and sorting the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratios (Ignat et al., 2011) . By using 1 H and 13 C NMR and MS, purity and steric integrity of DMY were assessed (Outtrup, Schaumburg, & Madsen, 1985) . Recently, the active compound was identified as 2R, 3R-dihydromyricetin from pine needles of Cedrus deodara based on MS and NMR data (Liang, Wu, Qiu, Zhong, & Gao, 2014) . The identification and quantification of specific flavonoid compounds like DMY can be performed with the following chromatographic techniques like thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), high-speed counter current chromatography (HSCCC), and high-performance counter current chromatography (HPCCC). TLC is a rapid and simple method for the qualitative analysis of flavonoids in plant extracts (Ignat Volf, & Popa, 2011) . He, Pei, and Zhou (2000) determined the content of DMY in A. grossedentala by using a TCL-scanner. The implementation of a modern standardized methodology led to an increasing acceptance and recognition of DMY. HPLC is another preferred method for the identification and quantification of several flavonoids due to its simplicity and sensitivity. The HPLC conditions mainly include the use of reverse phased C18 column, a binary solvent gradient, and different detection systems such as Diode Array Detection (DAD), MS or NMR (Marston & Hostettmann, 2006) . HPLC methods have been successfully applied in DMY identification and quantification in healthy food for anti-hangover and hepatoprotection (Zou, Zhou, & Sun, 2017) , in the fruit-stalk extract of H. dulcis (Park, Kim, & Rehman, 2016) , in Yeputaoteng (Jin, Ding, & Zhang, 2014) and in red wheat (Kohyama, Chono, & Nakagawa, 2017) . HPLC was also used for analysis of DMY content extracted from A. grossedentata by different extraction methods (Li, Li, & Zhang, 2008) . Other interesting chromatographic alternatives for the analysis of flavonoid compounds include HSCCC (Du, Cai, & Xia, 2002; Gao, Ma, & Chen, 2017; Ma, Zhou, & Tong, 2017) and HPCCC (Vieira et al., 2016) . HSCCC is an all-liquid chromatographic technique very suitable for preparative isolation of pure compounds (Ignat et al., 2011) . Recently, HSCCC was successfully used for rapid and efficient separation of antioxidants including DMY from vine tea (A. grossedentata) Ma et al., 2017) . Furthermore, Purification of (+)-DMY from an extract of A. grossedentata leaves was performed using a triple-column HSCCC. With a solvent system composed of n-hexane-ethyl acetatemethanol-water (1:3:2:4, v/v) 11.3 g of (+)-DMY was obtained at a high purity of over 99% (Du et al., 2002) . HPCCC is based on a supportfree liquid-liquid centrifugal partition chromatography, which could be applied to the fast fractionation and recovery of flavonoid from plant extract. A developed HPCCC protocol was successfully used to isolate the main flavonoids including DMY from the crude extract of Impatiens glandulifera Royles (Vieira, Winterhalter, & Jerz, 2016) . Recently, the coupling of chromatographic techniques to MS or NMR has achieved growing importance for the structural elucidation of complex flavonoid compounds in natural products and biological samples. By using a HPLC-tandem electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) method, the major flavonoid extracts from A. grossedentata leaves by traditional solvent extraction and recrystallization was identified as (+)-DMY (Gao, Liu, & Ning, 2009) . A newly established ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole mass spectrometry method (UHPLC-MS) was successfully used for simultaneous quantification of 10 X. sorbifolia constituents. It was found that the wood of X. sorbifolia was rich in phenolic compounds with the contents of DMY being 6.76-7.89 mg/g (Zhang, Ma, & Ma, 2015) . In a recent study, UPLC-MS was successfully used for analysis of the fruit metabolome DMY in Actinidia arguta cultivars (Li, Fang, & Qi, 2018) . Besides the natural products, there are also some reports on determining DMY in biological sample by chromatographic methods. HPLC methods have been previously reported for the determination of DMY in rat plasma after orally administrating the decoction of A. grossedentata (Zhang et al., 2007) Recently, a bioanalytical method with liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS has been developed and validated for the quantitation of DMY in rat plasma (Liu, Yin, & Wang, 2017; Tong et al., 2015; Wu, Ma, & Zhang, 2018; Yang, Yan, & Liu, 2019) , for monitoring uptake and transport of DMY in human intestinal Caco-2 cells (Xiang et al., 2018) as well as for pharmacokinetic studies of DMY in organisms including absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (Fan et al., 2017) . In contrast with HPLC, LC-MS/MS is more rapid, more sensitive for the biological analysis.
