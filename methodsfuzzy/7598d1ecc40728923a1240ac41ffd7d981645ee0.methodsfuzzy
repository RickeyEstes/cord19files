Extraction of viral RNA from MEE samples was performed with a commercial RNA isolation procedure (QIAamp, QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription PCR was carried out by the method described previously by Blomqvist et al. 13 and Suvilehto et al. 14 The primers were targeted to highly conserved 5 NCR sequences shared by rhino-and enteroviruses and therefore the differentiation of rhinoviruses from enteroviruses was carried out by a Table 1 Number of positive samples for respiratory virus nucleic acid in two groups of samples (serous and mucoid) based on the type of effusion in 54 children with otitis media with effusion. Differences between these two groups were statistically non-significant with Fisher's Exact Test (level of significance: P â‰¤ 0.05). liquid-phase hybridisation assay with Europium-labelled oligonucleotide probes (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland, one for rhinovirus and the other for enterovirus). 15 Quantification of lanthanide fluorescence was performed in a time-resolved manner. The cut-off value of positive samples for both europium-labelled probes was the mean of the negative controls plus 5 times the SD of the mean.
