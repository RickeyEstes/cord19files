Huh7.5, U-2 OS, A549, 293T (from C. Rice), 293 (from N. Conrad), and COS-7 (from N. Alto) and all derivatives were maintained in "complete" DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1x NEAA (Gibco). Human STAT1 −/− fibroblasts (from J-L. Casanova) were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1x NEAA (Gibco). BHK21-J (from C. Rice) were grown in MEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1x NEAA. Stable cells expressing antibiotic resistance genes were grown in complete media supplemented with puromycin (Sigma) at 4μg/mL or blasticidin (Gibco) at 15 μg/mL. Normal human dermal fibroblasts were purchased from Lonza and cultured in fibroblast basal media (ATCC or Lonza) as recommended by the supplier. Human fetal neural progenitors were cultured as previously described 33 . Cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma using a PCR based assay (Vendor GeM Mycoplasma Detection Kit from Sigma Cat.#MP0025-1KT). When applicable, cell lines were authenticated with STR analysis using the ATCC Cell Line Authentication service. Generation and propagation of the following viruses or replicons have been previously 33 . Infectious HCV-Gluc was generated from the infectious clone Jc1FLAG(p7-nsGluc2A) as previously described 34 . An infectious clone of non-reporter WNV (strain TX02) was kindly provided by I. Frolov and virus was propagated as described above for WNV-GFP. DENV-Fluc with a L52F mutation in NS4B was derived from the pDENV2-IC30P-A and propagated as previously described 7 . A ZIKV MR766-GFP infectious clone (kindly provided by M. Evans) was used to generate virus as described 35 . The infectious clone, pACNR-FLYF-17Dx (kindly provided by C. Rice) was used to generate non-reporter YFV-17D. Briefly, the plasmid was linearized with XhoI, and the purified DNA was used as a template for transcription with the mMessage mMachine SP6 Transcription kit (ThermoFisher). RNA was purified with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and electroporated into BHK21-J cells. Virus-containing supernatants were collected, clarified by centrifugation, and stored at −80°C. Human coronavirus OC43 (ATCC strain VR-1558) was propagated in HCT-8 cells as specified by the ATCC. Viral titers were determined by antibody staining (Millipore MAB9012) and flow cytometry 36 .
