Hong Kong University has a 5-year undergraduate medical curriculum which emphasises problembased and self-directed learning. We used a questionnaire to survey those Year 4 medical students who completed their anaesthesiology attachment during July and August 2003 and had undergone clinical skills training in advanced life support at this time. This was approximately one third of the class. All questionnaires were therefore completed within two months following the removal of Hong Kong from the World Health Organisation's SARS Infected Areas list. All student participation was voluntary and the survey was approved by our institutional ethics committee. The questionnaire was designed to examine three main areas: (1) student confidence in performing BLS skills; (2) student perceptions of risk associated with performing BLS; (3) student willingness to perform BLS in various situations. The first section of the questionnaire consisted of 25 statements to which the students were asked to select a response from a five-point Likert rating scale: 5, strongly agree; 4, agree; 3, neither agree nor disagree; 2, disagree; 1, strongly disagree. This was followed by four hypothetical outof-hospital cardiac arrest situations involving (a) an adult stranger; (b) an elderly stranger; (c) a child who is a stranger; and (d) a family member, and the students were asked if they would definitely, probably, probably not, or definitely not, provide various resuscitation interventions during these situations. For each of the four patient types they were also asked if the SARS outbreak had made any difference to the likelihood that they would now perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation during resuscitation. The final section consisted of a list of eight possible reasons that might prevent the performance of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; fear of SARS; fear of HIV; fear of other infections; fear of being sued; fear of failure; fear of vomitus; mouth-to-mouth ventilation is unpleasant; mouth-to-mouth ventilation is not useful. The students were asked to indicate which, if any, of these reasons would stop them from performing mouth-to-mouth ventilation. Multiple responses were allowed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows, Release 12.0.0 (SPSS Inc., USA). 2
