This study was carried out from November 1993 until May 1994 on Karacabey Farm in Turkey. The farm owns approximately 300 dairy cows, with an average milk yield of 5100 kg per year per cow. We only used healthy calves; those which had other diseases (e.g. respiratory diseases with or without diarrhea) were excluded from the trial. In order to test the response relationship, the newborn calves were divided into four different groups. The percentage of dams of first parity and the breeds were equally distributed among the groups. The control group did not receive any egg powder. The other three groups received 2 g, 4 g, or 8 g egg powder with specific antibodies to rotavirus types 1 and 2 (neutralisation test: minimal titer 512) and E. coli K99 pilus antigen (ELISA titer: minimal 330) each, in a drink which was divided between two meals per day during the first 14 days of life. Calves of the Holstein Frisian breed (n = 126) and brown cattle (n = 118) were used in the trial. The first five newborn calves were put into the control group, then five calves were put into each of the 2 g, 4 g, and 8 g groups so that the calves were allocated systematically. On five occasions, ten calves were put into the control group instead Iof five to make this group larger. After the first administration of colostrum by nipple-drinking, the calves were taken away from the dams and kept individually on straw. The calves received 0.5-1.0 1 colostrum three times on the first day of life, and then 1.5-2.0 1 cow's milk three times per day on Days 2-5. After the first 5 days of life, the calves received 2.0-2.5 1 cow's milk twice a day, increasing slowly to 3.0-4.0 1 cow's milk per meal until the 4th week of life. From the 10th day, fresh water and hay were also available to the animals. At the age of 3 weeks, commercial compound feed and hay were offered. As in the study by Erhard et al. (1993) , the infectious agent, the cumulative incidence of diarrhea in the groups, the duration of diarrhea (from the first sign of diarrhea to the recovery), body weight gain, and mortality were examined during this trial. Clinical diagnosis was done by a veterinarian who had no knowledge of the experimental groups. Diarrhea was diagnosed according to the parameters faecal consistency score and the condition of the calves. Treatment of diarrhea was similar across groups, depending on the clinical state of the calves. If necessary, calves got electrolytes and/or antibiotics (tetracycline). Faecal samples were taken on Day 7 and, in cases where diarrhea was diagnosled, immediately prior to treatment. Identification of the infectious agent was carried lout in all faecal samples by means of the Lactovac" ELISA (Hoechst Veterin'ti GmbH, UnterschleiBheim, Germany). This test can identify bovine rota-and coronavirus, and E. coli K99 pilus antigen, as well as cryptosporidia. Probes (1:2 diluted in PBS, pH 7.2) were interpreted as positive if the extinction at 450 nm was above 0.1 and the negative control was below 0.1. The minimal difference in extinction was set at 0.1. Statistical analysis was made by the Mann-Whitney test (unpaired) or x2 test. All tests were two-tailed, and alpha was 0.05. The number of calves was higher in the control group (n = 80) because all egg powder groups were only compared with the control group.
