Data were reported by the attending physicians reviewing medical charts, radiologic and laboratory records. The following information was recorded; demographic data, comorbidities, time from illness onset to hospital admission, time to first dose of antiviral delivery, microbiologic findings, and chest radiologic findings at ICU admission. Intubation and mechanical ventilation requirements, adverse events during ICU stay and laboratory findings at ICU admission were also recorded. We classified patients according to case definitions (confirmed, probable, or suspected) developed by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A confirmed case of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection is defined as a person with an ILI with laboratory confirmed novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection by real time RT-PCR (8, 9) . We defined critically ill patients as those admitted to an adult intensive care unit (ICU); requiring mechanical ventilation or receiving intravenous infusion of inotropic or vasopressors during the hospitalization. Severity of illness was assessed in adults using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II within 24 hours of ICU admission. We recorded co-morbidities and prior defined major co-morbidities as the presence of one or more of the following chronic medical conditions: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), congestive heart failure, malignancy, neuromuscular disorders, cerebral palsy, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery diseases, heart diseases, chemotherapy, malnutrition, immunosuppressive status or renal failure. Nasopharyngeal-swab specimens were collected at admission, and bronchial-aspirate samples were obtained after tracheal intubation. Specimens were placed in transport medium and kept at a temperature from 2 to 4°C. RT-PCR testing was done in accordance with published guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (10) . Seasonal vaccination history and radiographic findings were recorded to study form. Specimens (bronchoalveolar lavage and blood) for culture sent to microbiology laboratory for detection of bacterial infection in invasive and noninvasive mechanically ventilated patients. The body-mass index (BMI, weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was calculated. Obesity defined as a BMI 30 to 40 in patients. Morbid obesity defined as BMI > 40. Statistical analysis; Descriptive analysis included frequency (%) and mean ± standard deviation (SD). Mann-Whitney Test used for significance in between groups. We accepted P value <0.05 for significance. Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 . In Table 4 comparison between survivors and nonsurvivors were shown. 3 ) 188.8±108.4 Opacity on initial chest X-ray, n (%) Normal chest X-ray 2 (3.2%) Bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray 55 (90.1%) 1/4 quadrants infiltrates on chest X-ray 1 (1.7%) 2/4 quadrants infiltrates on chest X-ray 10 (17.2%) 3/4 quadrants infiltrates on chest X-ray 7 (12%) 4/4 quadrants infiltrates on chest X-ray 40 (69%) Symptoms at presentation included fever (88.5 %), cough (83.6 %), sputum (79 %) and dyspnea (96.7%). Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were reported in 24.6 %, 39.3 %, and 45.9 %, respectively. The mean time from the onset of illness to critical care admission was 7.56 ± 4.1 days (range, 2 to 22). Un-derlying medical condition was existed in 50 (82 %) patients. Obesity (27.9 %) and COPD (14.7 %) were the most common conditions in patients. There was no significant difference according to underlying medical condition in between nonsurvivor and survivor groups. A total of 3 patients (4.9%) were pregnant, of whom 2 had another underlying medical condition (asthma and heart disease). Of the 4 pregnant patients, 1 was in the first trimester, 1 was in the second trimester, 1 was in the third trimester, and 1 was in the postpartum period.
