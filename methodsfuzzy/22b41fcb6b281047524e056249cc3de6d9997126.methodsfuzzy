We conducted a questionnaire survey to 308 SARS victims who attended the Princess Margaret Hospital SARS follow up clinic from 15 April-15 May 2003. The questionnaires were administered by mail in early June 2003 with return envelopes. To encourage reply we gave phone call to all patients before sending them questionnaires. One of the questionnaires, the SARS Neuropsychiatric Symptoms Checklist (NPSC), was specifically designed to evaluate the neuropsychiatric complaints after SARS according to our initial experiences [5] . It consisted of 25 items covering six neuropsychiatric domains of interest (see Appendix for questionnaire), namely cognition (Q1-4), mania (Q5-8), depression (Q9-15), anxiety (Q16-18), psychosis (Q19-21) and behavioural symptoms (Q22-25). The items were scored on a four-point ordinal scale with '0' representing 'none' and '3' 'always'. This questionnaire was duplicated into four. Two questionnaires were administered by patients and two were administered by their families. The first set was rated to the best of their recall during hospital stay (at acute phase), and the second set was rated according to their present state (at convalescent phase). The questionnaires administered by family members served to evaluate the reliability of the information provided by the patient. Severity of the SARS symptoms was recorded on a separate eight-item checklist using an ordinal scale from 0 to 3, which gave a maximum possible score of 24. We also included General Health Questionnaire 28 (GHQ28) as a screening tool for psychological well being at convalescent phase [3] . The study was approved by local ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from every participant.
