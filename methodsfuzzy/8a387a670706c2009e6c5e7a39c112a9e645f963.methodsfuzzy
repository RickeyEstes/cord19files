To further characterize viral maintenance in reservoir species, bicolored white-toothed shrews were caught alive. Trapping was performed at two sites in the administrative district of Swabia (permission No. 55.1-8646-2/75), a known endemic area for BoDV-1 infections and clinical apparent disease (Borna disease) in horses. After trapping, shrews were transported separately and put in husbandry. The animals were kept isolated from each other in single cages. They were kept in adapted standard cages type 4 and with respect to the natural requirements they were fed with a mixture of chicken heart muscle, chicken liver and insects. After an adaption period of 4 weeks and the initial veterinary care the animals stayed in husbandry for breeding. With respect to the high vulnerability to stress of wild-born animals, a health monitoring was installed. Once a day a visual examination of body condition, haired skin and behaviour was carried out and food intake was measured. Once a week body mass was recorded. The animals were monitored for any sign of direct abnormal behaviour or any indirect evidence like altered food intake, altered skin care or loss of body weight. In case of suffering, an early humane endpoint scheme adopted from laboratory rodents could be applied including euthanasia by anaesthesia conducted with CO 2 and decapitating. A postmortem examination scheme with evaluation of gross and histologic lesions could be performed to evaluate the cause of death. For comparative analysis, tissues from three naturally BoDV-1-infected dead bicolored white-toothed shrews from pest control (#2001 and #5017, [17] and another animal #5072 from the same stable as #5017) were used.
