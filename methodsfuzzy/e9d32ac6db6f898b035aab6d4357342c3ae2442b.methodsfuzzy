Demographic characteristics and possible transmission routes are presented as numbers (percentages). Viral load for RT-PCR are presented as mean 6 SEM values. Differences among groups regarding to occupation, working location and vaccination were determined by using Fisher exact test or univariate logistic regression. Odds ratio (OR) values were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Student's t-test was used for statistical comparisons between continuous variables. P value of less than 0.05 was statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
