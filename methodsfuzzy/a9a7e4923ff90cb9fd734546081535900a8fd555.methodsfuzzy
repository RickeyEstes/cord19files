Removal of natural anti-Gal xenoantibodies can be performed by immunoabsorption. This method is efficient, but incomplete, and often xenoreactive natural antibodies rebound relatively quickly (Kozlowski et al., 1998) . There are two approaches for the elimination of natural antibodies: in vitro, using α-Gal immunoaffinity columns, or in vivo, by extracorporeal perfusion of a donor organ (often the liver is chosen based on its size and vascularity). There is no swine breed available with inherently low α-Gal or animals which have spontaneously lost the α-Gal gene (Chae et al., 1999) . Identification of such animals would have been crucial to starting a low α-Gal or α-Gal-deficient herd. In another approach, Brenner et al. reported that nonspecific depletion of the majority of recipient immunoglobulins of all isotypes LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE by column immunoapheresis significantly improved graft survival of pig hearts in baboons (Brenner et al., 2000) . This strategy is clearly not clinically applicable as patients would not be able to survive long term without antibody-mediated protection. Based on these facts, Sachs and colleagues knocked out the gene in the most inbred of the MGH miniature swine (the 'D' haplotype) (Kolber-Simonds et al., 2004) . These pigs were devoid of α-Gal from the SLA dd pigs. Thus, these KOs have become the most likely donors to be used in clinical xenotransplantation. Though beyond the scope of this chapter, there are currently several additional approaches to eliminating xenoantibodies. Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies which kill B cells have been used (McGregor et al., 2005) , but there are B cells that do not express CD20, and thus are not eliminated. The use of cobra venom factor has been a common (yet toxic) method for preventing activation of complement (Dwyer et al., 2002) . The use of pigs expressing human complement inhibitory molecules such as CD46, CD55, and CD59 has also been tried (Dwyer et al., 2002) . Transgenic expression of CD59, a human complement regulatory protein, has promoted survival of swine lungs in a pig-to-primate model (Kulick et al., 2000; Yeatman et al., 1999) . The development of immunological tolerance is theorized to be the most effective method to circumvent xenograft rejection (Li and Sykes, 2012) . This approach addresses humoral and T-cell-mediated responses and has shown promise in the induction of donor-specific tolerance using bone marrow transplantation to create hematological chimeras. Tolerance to fully MHCmismatched allografts has been demonstrated in mice and primates after first creating a mixed allogeneic hematopoietic chimerism by engrafting donor bone marrow cells into the recipient. However, this hematopoietic chimerism has been difficult to achieve in the discordant pig-to-primate xenogeneic model, most likely due to species-specific differences in regulatory cytokines and elements of the stromal microenvironment (Sablinski et al., 1999; Emery et al., 1999) . Representative of a typical experimental protocol and illustrative of the complexities involved, recipient primates undergo whole-body irradiation prior to infusion of pig bone marrow. This method was modified to minimize irradiation-induced inflammatory responses. Primate anti-pig xenoantibodies were immuno-adsorbed by extracorporeal perfusion of recipient blood through a pig liver immediately before the intravenous infusion of porcine marrow. In addition to cyclosporine and 15-deoxyspergualin, recombinant pig stem-cell factor and IL-3 were given. Other calcineurin inhibitors such as FK506 (Tacrolimus) are now being used instead. Anti-thymocyte globulin and/or anti-CD2 monoclonal antibodies to target T cells have also been used. This permits, in part, the decrease of irradiation dosage. Thymic specific irradiation to prevent host resident thymic T cells from rejecting new bone marrow donor-derived thymic emigrants has been performed. Recipient primates required 4 weeks to recover from pancytopenia from whole body irradiation, and antipig IgM and IgG antibodies were temporarily depleted by the liver perfusion for 12-14 days. About 2% of the myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow of the recipient were of pig origin, and chimeras were unresponsive (or hyporesponsive) by mixed lymphocyte reaction when challenged with pig-specific stimulators. The first report of long-term survival of discordant xenogeneic bone marrow is in a primate recipient (Sablinski et al., 1999) . Others have reported on the poor function of porcine hematopoietic cells in primate marrow microenvironments. Warrens et al. found differences between swine and human bone marrow cultures in function of two well-characterized ligands known to be important in hematopoiesis, CD44 and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), but they concluded that the differences were not significant enough to explain lack of effective porcine hematopoiesis in the primate marrow, suggesting that other unknown interactions may be important (Warrens et al., 1998) . Gene therapy to express swine SLA class II antigens on baboon autologous bone marrow cells has had limited success (Ierino et al., 1999) . Transcription of the transgene was transient, and xenografts were rejected after 8-22 days. This experiment was important because it demonstrated that transfer and expression of xenogeneic class II transgenes can be achieved in baboons, and this therapy may prevent late T-celldependent responses to porcine xenografts, which include induced non-α-Gal IgG antibody responses. The use of porcine thymic grafts in immunodeficient mice has been found to support normal development of polyclonal, functional human T cells, and these T cells were specifically tolerant to SLA antigens of the porcine thymus donor, suggesting thymic transplantation may be an approach to achieve tolerance in pig-to-human xenotransplantation (Nikolic et al., 1999) . Indeed, this approach, by providing a thymokidney graft by Yamada et al., demonstrated that baboon thymic precursors were developing in the pig thymus posttransplant (Yamada et al., 2005) . The bone marrow chimerism tolerance approach is the one which has provided the longest survival and donor-specific tolerance. Refinement of this protocol will likely be the pathway that will lead swine xenotransplantation to the hospital floors. Before swine organs can be utilized as a successful alternative to human organ transplant, further research will be required to determine mechanisms to facilitate xenograft compatibility.
