Statistical analysis was carried out using the SAS/STAT W system, version 9 (SAS Institute Inc., 2002). To compare the frequency of episodes of ARI, ILI and worsening of indices of disease activity between periods of surveillance 1 and 2, and between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients the data were fitted in a zero-inflated Poisson model [36] . A multiple model for comparison of ARI and ILI episodes adjusted for other covariates: JIA type of onset (oligoarticular, polyarticular or systemic), gender, age (< 9 years old and ≥ 9 years old), disease activity and use of immunosuppressive therapy were performed. The student t test was used to compare geometric means of HI titers. Calculations were performed on logtransformed values (base 10). Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate associations between the response rates to the 3 vaccine antigens and patient groups with different therapeutic regimens (methotrexate/leflunomide, TNF-α inhibitor), different age-groups (< 9 yrs and ≥ 9 yrs), JIA onset type (oligoarticular, polyarticular and systemic) and between patients with active disease. A logistic regression model adjusted to these covariates was performed for evaluate influence on seroconversion. For comparison of variables related to disease activity before and after vaccination, the nonparametric Friedman test was used. For all tests, a significance level of 5% was adopted.
