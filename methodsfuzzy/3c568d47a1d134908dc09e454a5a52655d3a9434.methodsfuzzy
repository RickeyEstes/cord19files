Statistical analyses used SPSS, version 20.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Results are expressed as mean (Standard Deviation) or count (proportion) as appropriate. Qualitative variable comparisons used the Ï‡ 2 test or equivalents, and that of quantitative ones, the Student t test for paired samples or non-parametric equivalents. Odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were used to appreciate the impact of different variables on the duration of hospital stay, and were calculated by logistic regression analyses. A p value < 0.05 was used to characterize statistically significant results.
