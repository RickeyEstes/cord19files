The SARS-CoV RNA genome was amplified using Loopamp SARS CoV-detection kit (Eiken Chemical, Ohtawara, Japan) as reported previously with some modifications . RNA was isolated from the serum samples using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). Primers used in the Loopamp SARS CoV-detection kit for SARS-CoV RNA amplification were designed according to the nucleotide sequence of Replicase 1b region (Gen-Bank accession number NC 004718). Reverse transcription-LAMP reaction was conducted in 25 l of the reaction mixture at 62.5 â€¢ C for 45 min using the real-time turbidimeter LA200 (TERAMECS, Japan).
