We used the HLA-A*02:01-transgenic, and H-2D b−/− β2m −/− double knockout mice that express transgenic HLA-A*02:01 monochains, designated as HHD, in which human β2m is covalently linked to a chimeric heavy chain composed of HLA-A*02:01 (α1 and α2 domains) and H-2D b (α3, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains) (Figure 1a,b) . 15 Seven-to ten-weekold mice were used for all experiments. Mice were housed in appropriate animal care facilities at Saitama Medical University, and were handled according to the international guideline for experiments with animals. This study was approved by the Animal Research Committee of Saitama Medical University. Synthetic peptides HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitopes used were as follows: FMP 58-66 (sequence: GILGFVFTL), 31 HPV-E6 29-38 (sequence: TIHDIILECV), 32 HTLV-tax [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] (sequence: LLFGYPVYV), 33 and HIV-pol 476-484 (sequence: ILKEPVHGV). 34 Synthetic peptides corresponding to the above epitopes were synthesized by Operon Biotechnologies (Tokyo, Japan).
