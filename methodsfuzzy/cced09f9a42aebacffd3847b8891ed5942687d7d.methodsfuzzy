A total of 548 food handlers from 14 catering establishments located throughout Hong Kong were nasally swabbed by a trained researcher using a moistened transport swab on 2 occasions, 3-6 months apart, to define nasal carriage status. Swabs were transferred to the laboratory for culture within 2 hours of collection. Persistent carriers were defined as individuals with both specimens positive with the same spa type, whereas those positive on 1 occasion were classified as transient carriers. On the second visit, direct fingertip imprint specimens were collected. For any establishment where hand contamination rates exceeded the average by 10%, sampling was repeated 1 month after reinforcement of handwashing training. Ethical approval was obtained from the University Ethics Committee. Each subject was provided with an information sheet and gave written consent. Nasal swabs were incubated overnight in 5% salt-supplemented brain-heart infusion broth (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) at 37 C before subculture onto SA Select agar (Bio-Rad UK Ltd, Hemel, Hempstead, UK). Imprints of fingerprints of the dominant hand were obtained on mannitol salt agar (Oxoid). Isolates were confirmed as S aureus by latex agglutination (Remel, Lennexa, Kan) and characterized by spa typing and comparison with the Ridom database. 5 To determine the degree of similarity of strains, Simpson's diversity index (D) was calculated using standard formulae.
