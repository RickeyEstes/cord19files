Collections, animals, and pathological evaluations. Carcasses and tissues of 9 ball pythons (BP) with clinical signs of respiratory tract disease (stomatitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, glossitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia) from seven collections in Florida, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin were submitted for necropsy and light microscopic evaluation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and/or molecular diagnostics were performed on selected cases. (i) Collection 1. Two snakes from a private collection in Texas (BP1 and -2) were submitted in 2007 for pathological evaluations. The owners reported that affected snakes exhibited acute signs of respiratory disease characterized by audible wheezing along with a clear mucoid nasal discharge, notable "cough-like" forced expiration, and excessive amounts of foamy mucus in the oral cavity. BP1 was euthanatized and immediately necropsied. BP2 was found dead and was refrigerated for 2 days prior to necropsy. Lung was collected from both snakes, and portions were frozen or placed in neutral buffered 10% formalin (NBF) and processed for light microscopy. Lung was sectioned at 6 m and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). A portion of lung of BP1 that was fixed in NBF was cut into 1-mm cubes and transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde-2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.24, and processed for TEM (see below). Molecular diagnostics were performed on frozen tissues from two snakes (snakes 3 and 4) from a second collection in Texas (collection 2), but they were negative and are not discussed further in this report. (ii) Collection 3. Three ball pythons (5, 6, and 7) from a private collection in Wisconsin were submitted to a veterinarian due to signs of respiratory disease. Ball python 5 was found dead and submitted for necropsy. The following tissues were collected, fixed in NBF, and processed for light microscopy: lungs, kidney, liver, stomach, spleen, and ovary with oviduct. Ball pythons 6 and 7 had acute onset of respiratory signs over a 2to 3-day period characterized by an increase in respiratory rate and effort. There also was elevation of the cranial third of the snake's body (from the ground), ultimately resulting in opisthotonos (stargazing). A decision was made to euthanatize and necropsy BP6 and -7. The following tissues were collected from each snake, fixed in NBF, and subsequently embedded in paraffin: trachea, lungs, heart, esophagus, stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, kidneys, oviduct, brain, spinal cord, nasal sinuses, vomeronasal organ, and skin. The paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 6 m, processed routinely for light microscopy, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections of the vomeronasal organ of one case were stained with Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast stain, which was negative for acid-fast bacteria; methenamine silver staining was negative for yeast and hyphae. A portion of lung from BP6 was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.24, and processed for TEM (see below). (iii) Collection 4. A full necropsy and pathological evaluation were performed on a 1-year-old female ball python (BP8) from a private col-lection in Texas that died after a history of respiratory disease for 1 week and respiratory distress for 2 days. The snake was from a group of four snakes. There was a history of respiratory disease in the group, and previously one other snake had died. The snake exhibited marked dyspnea with crackles and wheezes audible without a stethoscope. Other clinical findings included hypersalivation and a swollen, erythematous glottis. Culture of a tracheal swab isolated Shewanella putrefaciens. No response to treatment with the antimicrobial enrofloxacin was noted. The following tissues were analyzed: lungs, kidney, liver, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, heart, brain, oral cavity, pharynx, nasal cavity, trachea, eye, spleen, and ovary with oviduct were placed in NBF and processed routinely for light microscopy. Six-micrometer sections of paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. (iv) Collections 5 and 6. Two BPs, one from private collection 5 in Florida (BP9) and the other from private collection 6 in Oklahoma (BP10), were submitted to an exotic animal practice for evaluation due to signs of respiratory disease and anorexia. BP9 was part of a small breeding collection where very few sick animals were previously observed. BP9 was euthanized, and the following tissues were collected during necropsy, fixed in NBF, and processed for light microscopy: trachea, lung, kidney, salivary gland, liver, brain, and small intestine. Portions of trachea, liver, and lung were collected, frozen at Ϫ20°C, and subsequently submitted for molecular diagnostics. Six-micrometer sections of paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The second case (BP10) was a 5-year-old female common BP from a large collection (500-plus) of ball pythons in Oklahoma. Prior to 2009, no significant health issues were recognized in this collection. Starting in 2009 several ball pythons showed signs of respiratory disease, and from 2010 to early 2011, three ball pythons died with clinical signs of respiratory disease. Ball python 10 had signs of respiratory disease and was euthanized for pathological evaluation. The following tissues were collected, fixed in NBF, and processed for light microscopy: brain, kidney, large intestine, liver, lung, small intestine, and trachea. Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 6 m and were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Portions of lung were collected, frozen at Ϫ20°C, and subsequently submitted for molecular diagnostics. (v) Collection 7. Ball python 11 was a 6-year-old adult from a private collection in Pennsylvania. The owner had about 74 snakes in total, all of which were ball pythons. Seven snakes in close proximity to one another from his collection became sequentially ill with clinical signs of respiratory disease, including dyspnea and open-mouth breathing, All ill snakes were immediately quarantined in a separate room from the general population. Of the 7 snakes that became ill, 6 died within a few days of first manifesting signs of respiratory disease. One of the dead snakes was submitted to a private practitioner for necropsy. Portions of trachea, lung, kidney, liver, integument, and small intestine were fixed in NBF and submitted to a pathology service processed for light microscopy. Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 6 m and were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, alcian blue, and PAS. Portions of lung, liver, and kidney were collected, frozen at Ϫ80°C, and subsequently submitted for molecular diagnostics. Ethics statement. No live animals were used in this study. Tissues and carcasses were from animals from private collections. Snakes either died or were euthanized by the attending veterinarian due to the severity of clinical signs and poor prognosis as described above. Tissues or carcasses were collected during necropsy by attending veterinarians and submitted for the purposes of this study, with the owners' consent. The acquisition of fresh, frozen, and formalin-fixed tissue samples was authorized under University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Protocol A116. Transmission electron microscopy. Formalin-fixed lung samples from BP1 and BP6 were cut into 1-mm cubes and transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde-2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.24. Fresh lung from BP6 was also cut into small cubes and fixed directly in 4% paraformaldehyde-2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.24. Fixed tissues were processed with the aid of a Pelco BioWave laboratory microwave (Ted Pella, Redding, CA, USA). The samples were washed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.24, postfixed with buffered 2% OsO 4 , water washed, and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, 25%, 50%, 75%, 95%, and 100%, followed by 100% acetone. Dehydrated samples were infiltrated in graded acetone-Spurrs epoxy resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) 30%, 50%, 70%, and 100% and cured at 60°C. Cured resin blocks were trimmed, thin sectioned (70 nm), and collected on Formvar-coated copper grids, poststained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate. Sections were examined with a Hitachi H-7000 TEM (Hitachi High Technologies America, Inc., Schaumburg, IL), and digital images were acquired using a Veleta 2k by 2k camera and iTEM software (Olympus Soft-Imaging Solutions Corp., Lakewood, CO). Clinical molecular diagnostics. Portions of fresh frozen lung specimens were selected from several of the above cases for identification of nucleic acid sequences for several viruses implicated as causative agents of respiratory tract disease of snakes. RNA was extracted from lung of BP1 and tested by using previously described consensus PCR methods for the genus Ferlavirus in the Paramyxoviridae, the Rhabdoviridae, and the genus Orthoreovirus in the Reoviridae (71) (72) (73) . Additionally, RNA was extracted from portions of lungs of BP6 and -7 and tested for gene sequences for members of the family Rhabdoviridae and Filoviridae. For molecular diagnostic detection of filoviruses (Marburg viruses and Ebola viruses), RNA was sent to the Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two independent panfilovirus RT-PCR assays were utilized as previously described (74, 75) using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, RNA was reverse transcribed for 30 min at either 45°C or 50°C, respectively, and then denatured for 2 min at 94 to 95°C. For RNAs amplified according to the protocol described elsewhere (74) , reaction mixtures were thermocycled 40 times at 94°C for 15 s, followed by successive incubations at 45°C and 68°C for 30 s each. For RNAs amplified according to the previously described protocol (75) , reaction mixtures were treated identically except that the annealing and extension temperatures were 53°C and 72°C degrees, respectively. Positive-and negativecontrol reactions were carried out in parallel to validate the performance of the testing. Library preparation and sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissues for sequencing library generation and molecular analysis. RNA was extracted as previously described (59) . Two hundred fifty nanograms of RNA was added to 20 l RT reaction mixtures containing 200 pmol oligonucleotide MDS-286 (random hexamer), 1ϫ reaction buffer, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1.25 mM (each) deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and 100 U SuperScript III (Life Technologies). The sequences of all oligonucleotides are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 42°C and then for 15 min at 70°C. Then, 1 U RNase H (NEB) diluted in 5 l 1ϫ RT buffer with 100 pmol MDS-286 was added to reaction mixtures, which were incubated for 30 min at 37°C and then 94°C for 2 min. Then, primer extension was used to convert single-stranded cDNA to double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA): 2.5 U Klenow DNA polymerase (3= to 5= exo-; NEB) diluted in 5 l 1ϫ RT buffer with 2 mM (each) dNTP was added to reaction mixtures, which were incubated at 37°C for 15 min. DNA was purified using DNA clean and concentrator columns (CC-5; Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's protocol and using a 3:1 ratio of binding buffer/sample. The DNA concentration was determined fluorometrically, and 10 ng was used as a template in 10 l Nextera transposon reactions, which contained 1ϫ buffer and 0.5 l transposase mix (Illumina), which were incubated at 55°C for 10 min and then placed on ice. Tagmented DNA was cleaned with CC-5 columns (4:1 buffer ratio), eluted in 20 l H 2 O, and used as a template in PCRs that added full-length bar-coded adapters to library molecules. PCR mixtures contained 1ϫ Kapa real-time library amplification PCR mix (Kapa Biosystems), 0.33 M (each) primers MDS-143 and -445 and 0.017 M (each) adapter1 and adapter2 bar-coded primers, and 5-l library template. Thermocycling conditions were 72°C for 3 min, followed by 95°C for 30 s, and then 5 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 63°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 3 min. Relative concentrations of libraries were then quantified in quantitative PCR (qPCR) reaction mixtures containing 10 mM Tris, pH 8.6, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.08% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.2 mM (each) dNTP, 1ϫ Sybr green (Life Technologies), and 0.5 U Taq polymerase, and 0.1 M (each) primers MDS-143 and -445. Equivalent amounts of each sample were then pooled, and the pool was cleaned with a DNA CC-5 column according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pooled libraries were then size selected (350 to 450 nt) using a LabChip XT device (Caliper), and purified again using a CC-5 column. Size-selected pooled libraries were subjected to a final round of amplification in PCR mixtures containing 1ϫ Kapa real-time library amplification mix, 200 pmol each MDS-143 and -445, and 5 l library template. Reaction conditions were 98°C for 1 min and 16 cycles of 98°C for 15 s, 63°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 3 min. The pooled libraries were finally purified using a DNA CC-5 column and quantified spectroscopically and by using the Illumina library quantification kit (Kapa Biosystems). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument. Sequence analysis. The sequence analysis pipeline was similar to that employed previously (59, 76) . Low-quality sequences and low-complexity sequences (defined as having a ratio of the length of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch compressed sequence to the uncompressed length of less than 0.46) were removed from further analysis. The first 5 bases of each sequence were trimmed, as was the last base. The CD-HIT sequence clustering tool was then used to collapse reads with Ͼ98% global pairwise identity (77) . Host-derived sequences were then filtered, first by using the BLASTn alignment tool (version 2.2.25ϩ [30] ) to query a database of snake ribosomal and mitochondrial sequences and then by using the Bowtie2 alignment tool (version 2.0.0-beta7 [26] ) to query databases composed of draft assemblies of the Burmese python and boa constrictor genomes (20, 21) . Sequences aligning with an expect value of less than 10 Ϫ12 (BLASTn) or with -local mode alignment scores greater than 86 (Bowtie) were filtered. Similarly, sequences that aligned to the Illumina adapter sequences (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) or to PhiX-174 control sequence were removed. This filtering removed on average 98% of sequences (see Table S2 ). The remaining sequences were searched against custom databases of viral protein sequences using the BLASTx alignment tool. Sequences aligning to any viral protein sequence with an expect value of less than 0.25 were further examined. False positives were reduced by using BLAST to align putative viral sequences to the NCBI nonredundant nucleotide (nt) and protein (nr) databases. Only sequences whose best hit and whose pair's best hit were still to viral sequences were retained. The PRICE de novo targeted genome assembler was used to generate initial contiguous virus sequences (22) . The reference assembly (NCBI accession no. KJ541759) was assembled using reads from a single snake (no. 2); other animals lacked sufficient coverage to assemble the complete genome. To validate this assembly and generate coverage and pairwise identity data, reads were aligned to Sanger validated assemblies using the BLASTn algorithm. Sequencing data have been deposited in the UCSF Integrated Data Repository. Sanger sequencing and RACE. The sequencing-based virus genome assembly was validated using RACE and Sanger sequencing. PCR mixtures contained 1ϫ iProof High-Fidelity DNA polymerase mix (Bio-Rad), 0.5 M (each) primer, and 2 l diluted cDNA, prepared as described above. Thermocycling conditions were 98°C for 30 s and then 40 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 60°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 1 min, with a final 5-min 72°C extension. Primers were designed to tile across the assembly in over-lapping~1,200-bp amplicons (Fig. 4B) (78) . Amplicons were verified on agarose gels and sequenced directly. In some cases, amplicons were gel purified with the Zymoclean kit (Zymo Research), cloned into the pCRBlunt vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols, and sequenced. 5= and 3= RACE was used to validate end sequences, essentially as described previously (24, 25) , with primers listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Multiple RACE amplicons were cloned and sequenced as described above. The complete and validated genome se-quence has been deposited with the NCBI (see below). Subgenomic RNA junctions were amplified and sequenced similarly. Quantitative PCR. To measure relative levels of viral RNA in samples, RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed as described above for library preparation. cDNA was diluted 1:10 in 10 mM Tris-0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8. qPCR reaction mixtures contained 10 mM Tris, pH 8.6, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.08% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.2 mM (each) dNTP, 1ϫ Sybr green (Life Technologies), 0.5 U Taq polymerase, and 0.25 M (each) primer (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Viral RNA levels were normalized to levels of cellular GAPDH (see Table S1 ). Reaction efficiencies were determined using serial dilutions of templates (79) . Tissue culture and virus isolation. Cells were cultured as described previously (59) . To prepare inocula, frozen tissues were thawed on ice, and 1-g portions were minced with scalpels and disrupted by Dounce homogenization in ice-cold minimum essential medium (MEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. Homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ϫ g for 1 min and filtered through a 0.45-m filter. Filtrate was diluted 1:10 in MEM plus HEPES and added to cultures of 80% confluent cells. Culture medium was harvested and replaced after 20 h and every 2 to 3 days thereafter for an additional 14 days and stored at Ϫ80°C until further processing. RNA was isolated from clarified culture supernatant using the ZR viral RNA kit (Zymo Research), according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was reverse transcribed and analyzed by qRT-PCR as described above. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses. ORFs in the viral genome were identified using the Geneious software program (version 6.1; BioMatters). Homologs of predicted protein sequences were detected using the BLASTp tool (version 2.2.25ϩ) to search the NCBI nonredundant protein database (nr) (30) , and by using the HMMER3 alignment tool (version 3.1b1) to search the PFam database (http://hmmer.org) (32) . For HMMER analysis of replicase polyprotein, sequence was split into 400-aa sliding windows offset by 60 aa. For sequences with no detectable similarity by those measures, the HHpred homology detection and structure prediction tool (version 2.0) was also used (31) . TMHMM (version 2.0) was used to predict transmembrane domains. The NetNGlyc (1.0) and NetOGlyc (4.0) tools were used to predict N-and O-linked glycosylation sites in protein sequences (33, 34) (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services /NetNGlyc/). In cartoons depicting sequence features, all features are to scale and accurately positioned. Sequences from a set of 33 representative nidoviruses based on a previously published analysis were downloaded (see Table S3 in the supplemental material [42] ). Conserved protease, RdRp, and helicase domains in replicase polyproteins were identified using HMMER3 and BLAST alignments. Multiple sequence alignments of these domains were created using MAFFT version 7 with default parameters (see Fig. S5 ) (80) . Amino acid substitution models were evaluated for each region using corrected Aikake information criteria in the software program ProtTest 3.2.2 (81) . LG was identified as the best-fit model (82, 83) . Bayesian analyses of each alignment were performed using the software program MrBayes 3.2.2 (84) on the CIPRES server (85), with gamma-distributed rate variation and a proportion of invariant sites, and amino acid models were also assessed by model jumping. The first 10% of 1,000,000 iterations were discarded as a burn-in, based on examination of trends of the log probability versus generation. Two independent Bayesian analyses were run to avoid entrapment on local optima. Maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis was performed using the RAxML software tool on the CIPRES server (86) , with gamma-distributed rate variation and a proportion of invariant sites. The amino acid substitution model with the best fit using ProtTest was selected. Gill-associated virus was used as an outgroup. Bootstrap analysis was used to test the strength of the tree topology (1,000 resamplings) (87) . Numbers of bootstrap replicates were determined using the stopping criteria of Pattengale et al. (88) . To test for paraphyly of the Coronaviridae, likelihood ratio testing was conducted (58) . Trees were constrained to Coronaviridae monophyly (including ball python nidovirus with the Torovirinae) and compared by the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test to the best unconstrained tree identified in RAxML. Nucleotide sequence accession number. The complete and validated sequence assembled using reads from snake no. 2 has been deposited with the NCBI under accession no. KJ541759.
