A 2-stage (factor and cluster analyses) approach was performed to identify the common and distinctive biologic subgroups of asthma and COPD. First, factor analysis was applied to the panel of sputum inflammatory mediators and reduced to small independent factors. Sampling adequacy for factor analysis was assessed by using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test. Optimal factors were retained based on scree plots (factors above the break in the curve) and eigenvalue of greater than 1. Subsequently, corresponding factor scores representing each patient were generated and used as input variables into the k-means clustering algorithm to identify the clusters. The optimal number of clusters was chosen based on a scree plot (clusters above the break in the curve) by plotting within the cluster sum of the squares against a series of a sequential number of clusters. In addition, linear discriminant analysis was performed on the sputum mediators across clusters to validate how the identified clusters from the factor scores can be predicted by using the actual mediators' measurements and to identify the contribution of each mediator in discriminating the clusters (data not shown). Discriminant scores for individual patients were calculated and used to represent the patients' biologic cluster membership graphically. Microbiome measurements from 16S rRNA sequencing at both the phylum and genus levels were performed. Thirty species at the phylum level and 400 species at the genus level were screened. The relative abundance of each species was calculated, and the alpha (within-patient) and beta (between-patient) diversities at both the phylum and genus levels were estimated by using Shannon-Weiner and Sorensen indices, respectively (Vegan R-package, version 2.3). The patterns were compared between diseases and the identified biologic clusters. In addition, patterns of those most abundant species (median relative abundance greater than 2%) and/or those known to be major airway pathogens in asthmatic patients and patients with COPD at both the phylum and genus levels were presented graphically across the diseases and the identified biologic clusters. The statistical summary of all the available characteristics is presented across the diseases and identified biologic clusters and within each cluster by disease subgroup. The clusters were interpreted according to the patterns of these characteristics. In addition, the change in clinical characteristics and mediators between stable and exacerbation states within each cluster was assessed. Parametric data were presented as means with SEMs, and log-transformed data were presented as geometric means with 95% CIs. The x 2 or Fisher exact test and 1-way ANOVA were used to compare percentages and means across groups. Nonparametric data were presented as median values with first and third quartiles, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare these data between clusters. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (version 24; IBM, Armonk, NY), STATA/IC (version 14.0) software for Windows (StataCorp, College Station, Tex), and R software (version 3.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
