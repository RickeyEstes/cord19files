The study participants were recruited by informing families through daycare centers, family daycare, health centers, well-baby clinics, and local media in the Turku area between February 1996 and April 1998. Children qualified for enrollment if they were younger than 4 years and their signs and symptoms of URI had started within the preceding 48 hours. The exclusion criteria were as follows: middle ear effusion in either ear; any infection requiring antimicrobial therapy; any use of antimicrobial agents or steroids during the preceding 2 weeks; previous adenoidectomy or placement of tympanostomy tubes; any known immunodeficiency; Down syndrome; cleft palate; and the use of any investigational drug during the preceding 4 weeks. Of 301 children initially examined at the study clinic, 91 (30%) had to be excluded from participation because of AOM or otitis media with effusion.
