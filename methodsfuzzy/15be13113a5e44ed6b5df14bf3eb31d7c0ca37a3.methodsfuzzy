Visible and thermal image processing method to remotely sense multiple vital signs This method has been described in detail from an imageprocessing perspective in a previous publication. 10 A CMOS camera-equipped IRT system (TVS-500; NEC/AVIO Infrared Technologies Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was used; this is the same system that is used in the quarantine station at Narita International Airport in Japan. 5 The IRT system integrates a CMOS camera with thermography to capture visible and thermal images, respectively ( Figure 1 ). The visible and thermal images were recorded at a speed of 30 frames per second and at a resolution of 640 Ã‚ 480 pixels. The circulation of blood in the face causes tiny color changes on facial images that are undetectable with the human eye. The CMOS camera uses this information to determine the heart rate. To measure the respiration rate from the thermal images, the temperature changes that occur around the nasal area during the inspiration of cold air from the environment and the expiration of warm air from the lungs was monitored, and the respiratory waveform was extracted from the differences in each of the thermal images. This enabled the respiration rate to be determined from the breath-to-breath intervals. The facial skin temperature was measured simultaneously using the thermal images. The image acquisition and processing programs were written in LabVIEW software (National Instruments, Texas, USA). Subjects were seated in front of the IRT system at a distance of approximately 0.5 m. The IRT system displays the 'Infection' or 'Healthy' result within 10 s using the logistic regression discriminant function, which bases the output on the heart rate, respiration rate, and facial skin temperature.
