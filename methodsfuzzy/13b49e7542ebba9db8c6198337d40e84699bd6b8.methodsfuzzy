An observational study was conducted from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015 . Patients with asthma were recruited from the Department of Respiratory Medicine of the University Hospital of Tours, located in the center of France, as well as from the Department of Respiratory Medicine of the University Centre of Reunion, a French island located in the Indian Ocean. The socioeconomic statuses of the patients are very close because both locations are managed in the same way by the French government. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 years or older and hospitalized for an asthma exacerbation. An exacerbation was defined as the increase in respiratory symptoms for more than 24 hours or the use of oral corticosteroid therapy. Asthma diagnoses were established on a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing associated with variable expiratory airflow limitation before hospitalization according to the Global Initiative for Asthma. 1 Exclusion criteria were smoking more than 10 packs of cigarettes a year, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pregnancy. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Société de pneumologie de langue Française. Each patient gave an informed written consent to take part in the study.
