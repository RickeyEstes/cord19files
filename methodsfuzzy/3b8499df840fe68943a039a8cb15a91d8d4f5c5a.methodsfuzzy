Due to the complexity and costs-sensitive issues in implementing EMR exchange, an expert panel was formed to help guide the process. This panel of nine people included one medical informatics consultant, three general experts with experience in the field, and the authors. The medical informatics consultant had extensive consulting experience with EMR exchanges and was a professor in the field of medical informatics at a Taiwanese national university. The three general experts had all been involved in the planning and implementation of exchange projects funded by the DOH; they consequently all had comprehensive experience with and knowledge of EMR implementation. The expert panel critiqued our research model, checked/reviewed its completeness and discussed the suitability of our questionnaire.
