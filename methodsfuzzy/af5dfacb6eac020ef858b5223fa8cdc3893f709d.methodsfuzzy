In landscape genetics, simulation models are usually agent-based and spatially explicit (Landguth, Cushman, & Balkenhol, 2016) . Genetic data are modelled for individuals which have discrete spatial locations with respect to one another and with respect to environmental heterogeneity. Individuals move, behave and reproduce according to their own attributes in response to other individuals and in response to the simulated environment, and the model simulates changes in allele frequencies in response to these parameters. Landscape genetic simulation modelling has been used to test and validate methodological approaches (Cushman, Wasserman, Landguth, & Shirk, 2013; Zeller et al., 2016) , address theoretical questions about how and why landscape heterogeneity influences genetics (Landguth et al., 2010) , and evaluate and explain empirical observations (Shirk, Cushman, & Landguth, 2012) . Further, simulation modelling can predict how a system might respond to certain changes, such as habitat fragmentation or future management activities. Simulation modelling has been widely implemented in the study of pathogenic and nonpathogenic disease, beginning with medical research in the 1960s (Elveback & Varma, 1965 (Rees et al., 2008) . The spread of particular host genes relevant to disease can also be simulated to inform management efforts. For instance, Landguth, Holden, Mahalovich, and Cushman (2017) used landscape genetic simulations to determine optimal planting regimes to maximize the spread of blister rust resistant genes among whitebark pine populations. Such simulations could undoubtedly be applied to vector species in particular, such as predicting the spread of pesticide resistance genes in mosquitos (Chang et al., 2016) and selecting appropriate sites for introduction of genetically modified vectors (Lavery, Harrington, & Scott, 2008) . In addition, with the need to develop further landscape genetic frameworks for the study of pathogens, simulation modelling can prove useful in testing and validating these techniques, as it has done in the broader landscape genetics field (Cushman et al., 2013; Zeller et al., 2016) . For example, Leo, Gonzalez, Millien, and Cristescu (2016) used landscape genetic simulations to validate their multitaxa integrated landscape genetic framework, which appears to be a promising solution to the challenge of studying pathogens with multiple hosts and/or vectors. Landscape genetic simulations may also include epidemiological parameters such as mortality or activity responses to infection, or limited infectious periods, which may otherwise confound conventional (i.e., nonsimulation) landscape genetic approaches. Edge detection methods, such as Monmonier's maximum difference algorithm, (Monmonier, 1973) have also been used to detect landscape barriers to transmission in pathogen studies (Carrel et al., 2015; Joannon et al., 2010) . Ancestry estimates from model-based clustering algorithms can assign individuals to their populations of origin, enabling inference of landscape barrier permeability through the identification of migrants and thus estimation of the risk of pathogen spread across the barrier. Most of the studies implementing clustering and assignment methods did not use approaches that incorporate environmental data. Instead, spatially or nonspatially explicit methods were typically used to identify genetic discontinuities and relationships with landscape barriers were inferred ad hoc, or analyses proceeded to entirely different methods that explicitly include environmental data. Associations between genetic discontinuities and landscape be applied to pathogens directly without these potential constraints.
