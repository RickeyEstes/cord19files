The study was conducted from March 2004 to December 2006 (1,036 days) in Beijing, China. Data. Particle measurements were performed at a background measuring station on the campus of the Peking University (PKU) located in the northwestern part of Beijing in the Haidian district ( Figure 1 ). The campus area is primarily residential and commercial, without heavy traffic or industrial sources. The inlet of the sampling system was placed 20 m above ground on top of a six-floor building located > 500 m away from major roads. Local emission sources within a 1-km radius include vehicular traffic and fuel combustion for domestic cooking, heating, and construction. A study of the spatial variability of PM 2.5 mass and chemical composition in [1999] [2000] [2001] [2002] showed only minor differences between a PKU campus site and an urban measurement site located approximately 10 km southeast from the PKU measurement site. The setup of the measurement station is described in detail elsewhere (e.g., Wehner et al. 2004 Wehner et al. , 2008 . We continuously measured aerosol number size distributions between 3 nm and 1 μm. Sampling was done using a Twin Differential Mobility Particle Sizer (TDMPS; Birmili et al. 1999) , consisting of two Hauke-type differential mobility analyzers and two condensation particle counters (models 3010 and 3025; TSI Inc., St. Paul, MN, USA) which covered the size range from 3 nm to 800 nm (mobility diameter) and an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS; model 3321; TSI Inc.) which measured particles between 800 nm and 1 μm (aerodynamic diameter). To combine both measurements, APS data were transformed from aerodynamic diameter to Stokes diameter assuming an effective particle density of 1.7 g/cm 3 for the particles > 800 nm, because these particles are dominated by sulfate and crustal material in Beijing (Yao et al. 2003) . A low-flow PM 10 inlet was used to minimize contamination by large dust particles. The ambient aerosol was dried in a diffusion drier before entering the air-conditioned laboratory to avoid condensation of water in the inlet systems during warm and humid days in summertime. The data were corrected for losses due to diffusion and sedimentation within the inlet line. Size-dependent losses for the TDMPS inlet line were estimated using empirical particle loss corrections (diffusion and gravitation) from Willeke and Baron (1993) . Losses of 4-nm and 10-nm particles were estimated to be 35% and approximately 10%, respectively. Number size distributions were converted to particle number concentrations (PNC) and particle surface area concentrations (PSC) assuming spherical particles. For our analysis, we calculated daily means for 3-10 nm, 10-30 nm, 30-50 nm, 50-100 nm, 100-300 nm, and 300-1,000 nm size fractions. Total particle number or surface area concentration were computed as the sum of all fractions, and UFP as the sum of particle number concentrations < 100 nm. In addition, daily particle mass (PM 10 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) concentrations were gathered from the monitoring network of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau. Measurements were obtained as averages of eight fixed monitoring sites located in different parts of the urban area ( Figure 1 ). Daily mean meteorologic data from a measurement station near the Beijing Capital International Airport ( Figure 1 ) were gathered from an internet weather service (Weather Underground 2009) because measurements from the meteorologic station closest to the particulate measurement station were incomplete. The Pearson correlation coefficients for valid days between the two data sources were 0.99 and 0.95 for daily air temperature and relative humidity, respectively, indicating a good agreement. We collected data on hospital emergency room visits (ERV) from the Peking University Third Hospital, located in the Haidian district (Figure 1) , where patients within 10 km of the measurement site were likely to be treated (personal communication with hospital doctors). The data acquisition system of the hospital recorded only patients who did not stay longer than 1 day. A standardized form was completed by medically trained study personnel at PKU, School of Public Health, by abstracting the data from the medical records. A database was built on the basis of these files, and respiratory clinical end points were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) [World Health Organization (WHO) 1993] for respiratory diseases (ICD-10 codes J00-J99). Total respiratory ERV comprise acute upper respiratory infections (J00-J06), pneumonia (J18), acute bronchitis (J20), other diseases of the upper respiratory tract (J30-J39), and chronic lower respiratory diseases (J40-J47). In addition, location of permanent residence was recorded for each case; based on this information, only patients from Haidian district were considered for further analysis. Because of an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome in China in 2003, all patients with body temperature > 38°C were separately treated in the hospital, and these cases were excluded. Assignment of the diagnoses to ICD-10 disease categories were qualityassured by a nosological expert from the Third Hospital, resulting in a good agreement, as the percentage of misclassification was about 4%. Statistical analysis. We applied a time-series analysis using generalized additive Poisson regression models (Hastie and Tibshirani 1987) to estimate associations between air pollutants and respiratory ERV. In the first step, a base model without pollutants was built for identifying pollutantindependent variability. Long-term trends and seasonality were represented by a smooth function of calendar time, and a categorical variable for day of the week was forced into the model as hospital emergency room admissions showed weekly and yearly patterns. As further potential confounders, we considered the meteorologic parameters air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. We accounted for time-delayed effects of these variables using arithmetic means for days up to 7 days before the visit. Additional influences of the year, season (December-February, March-May, June-August, September-November), month, day of the month and holiday, represented by categorical variables were investigated as well. The base model was selected according to Akaike's information criterion (Akaike 1974) and statistical significance of the covariates (p < 0.05). Nonlinear effects were modeled by regression splines with an automatic smoothness selection (Wood 2006) . The smoothness of the trend function was manually adjusted based on the absolute value of the sum of the partial autocorrelation function (Touloumi et al. 2006) . The final base model consisted of the categorical variables holiday, weekend, and season, the linear influence of same-day relative air humidity, and the smooth functions of calendar time, air temperature, represented by the mean of the present and two previous days, and same-day air pressure. The base model was extended by including air pollutants. Delayed effects up to a maximum of 5 days were estimated by polynomial distributed lag (PDL) models (Zanobetti et al. 2003) , cumulative effects models that represented the delayed effect as a moving average, and single lag models that incorporated the delayed effect as a lagged variable into the model. We constrained the lag coefficients in PDL models to follow a third-degree polynomial of the lag number. Two-pollutant cumulative effects models included PM 10 or NO 2 in addition to another air pollution variable, with each modeled according to the same lag (e.g., same-day total particle number concentration and same-day NO 2 concentration). To explore the robustness of the models, we performed several sensitivity analyses for associations with particle number concentrations from 100 to 300 nm (PNC 100-300 ) that varied the lag pattern of temperature, relative humidity, and air pressure, and used different degrees of smoothness for the time trend function. Additionally, for PDL models we varied the number of the maximum lag and the degree of the polynomial order. All statistical analyses were done using the mgcv package in the R software (R Development Core Team 2003), version 2.90.
