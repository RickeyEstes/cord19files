Nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) were extracted from 200 μL virus transport medium using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A partial hexon gene fragment was amplified by PCR to screen and type HAdV infection as previously described [16, 23] . The first-round PCR primers were AdTU7 (5 0 -GCCACCTTCTTCCCCATGGC-3 0 ) and AdTU4 0 (5 0 -GTAGCGTTGCCGGCCGAGAA-3 0 ) with 1004 bp PCR product; the second-round primers were AdnU-S 0 (5 0 -TTCCCCATGGCC-CACAACAC-3 0 ) and AdnU-A (5 0 -GCCTCGATGACGCCGCGGTG-3 0 ) with 956 bp PCR product. The PCR reactions contained 1.25 U FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase, 10× PCR Buffer with 2 mM MgCl 2 (Roche Diagnostic Systems Inc., Mannheim, Germany), 0.5 μM of each primer, 200 μM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (i.e., dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP; TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan), and 5 μL nucleic acids (first round) or 2 μL first-round PCR product (second round) as a template in a total volume of 25 μL. PCR conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 10 min, followed by 36 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 50°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 2 min. The final step was an extension at 72°C for 7 min. The second round of PCR was conducted using the same PCR conditions described above for the first round. After the nested-PCR amplification, 5 μL reaction mixtures was subjected to electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg ethidium bromide per mL. The positive products were gel purified for DNA sequencing using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequencing was performed using the Cycle Sequencing Kit (Qiagen) on a DNA analyser. Specimens positive for HAdV were further tested for co-infection with other respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR and multiple reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), picornaviruses (PIC) including enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, influenza A and B virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1, 2 and 3, human bocavirus (HBoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human coronavirus (HCoV), including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, as previously described [24, 25] .
