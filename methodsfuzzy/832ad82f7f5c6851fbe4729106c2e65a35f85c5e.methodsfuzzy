A schematic diagram of the experimental set-up for aerosol filtration is displayed in Fig. 1 . MS2 aerosol was generated by a six-jet Collison nebulizer (Model CN25, BGI Inc.) that had a virus titer of 10 8 -10 9 PFU/mL at a flow rate of 7 Lpm with a pressure of 6 psi. The flow rate through the system was controlled by a rotameter, which was calibrated with a primary flow meter (DryCal s DC-Lite, Bio International Co.). The flow containing MS2 aerosol joined the other flow rate of 7 Lpm, passed through a humidifier for RH control, and then proceeded towards a 2.3-L glass mixing chamber. Thereafter, the flow was split and each flow then reached the corresponding filtration unit at a flow rate of 3 Lpm. This flow rate corresponds to the face velocity of 14.2 cm/s, which is a standard value for respirator filtration testing (NIOSH, 2005) . The excess air passed through a separate line and bypassed the test filter. The viral aerosols that penetrated the test filter (F¼22 mm) were collected by BioSamplers (SKC Corp.) containing 15 mL of sterile DI water at a total flow rate of 5.5 Lpm for 30 min for the experimental line. The reason for using a lower flow rate than the standard 12.5 Lpm is to avoid significant reaserosolization of MS2 at high flow rate (Riemenschneider et al., 2010 ). An empty filter holder without a filter was used for the control line. The collected sample was assayed with Escherichia coli as a host by the single layer method (EPA, 1984) . The viable removal efficiency (VRE) was determined by comparing the PFUs from the experimental and control BioSamplers: where N C and N E are the viral concentrations collected by the control and the experimental BioSamplers, respectively. To quantify the amount of MS2 virus collected in a given filter, the test filter taken off from the system was immersed into 25 mL of sterile DI water as an eluent and shaken by a wrist action shaker (Model 75, Burrell Scientific) for 15 min. To evaluate the biocidal efficacy of treated filters compared to untreated filters, relative survivability (RS) of viruses on filters was calculated by comparing survival factors, SFs, of both filters as Herein, SF is defined as where N S is the viral concentration obtained from the eluent, F EE is the extraction efficiency of microbes from filter, F CE is the collection efficiency of the Biosampler, and V E and V B are the liquid volumes of the eluent and the Biosampler, respectively. Consideration of the extraction efficiency and the collection efficiency of the BioSampler was not necessary for this relative value, RS. The pressure drop across the filter was measured by a Magnehelic gauge to evaluate filter performance using quality factor (QF), a useful criterion for comparing filter performance of different filter types and thicknesses. This value is defined as (Hinds, 1999) QF ¼ Àlnð1ÀVREÞ DP where DP is the pressure drop. It should be noted that throughout the duration of experiment (30 min), the variation of the pressure drop was negligible. Experiments were carried out in triplicate and samples were assayed in duplicate. Statistical analysis was conducted using 2-way analysis of variance (2-way ANOVA) with Design-Expert s 8.0 software. Additionally, a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6330F, JEOL Inc.) was used to observe morphological changes of the filters.
