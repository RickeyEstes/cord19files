Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations. Structures depicted in Figure 2 were minimized with GAMESS 60 version 1 May 2013 (R1) using the B3LYP 61 density functional method and the 6-31g(d) basis set. van der Waals surfaces colored by electrostatic potential were visualized with Avogadro 1.1.1. Synthesis of Compounds 3−7. Compounds were synthesized using standard solid phase peptide protocols. Wang Resin (0.22 mmol/gram for alkyne containing monomers, 0.68 mmol/gram for azide containing monomers) was activated with carbonyl diimidazole (CDI, 10 equiv) in dimethylformamide (DMF) for 4 h followed by treatment with 1,3-diaminopropane (10 equiv) in DMF for 4 h. Amino acids were coupled using 3.1 equiv of Fmoc-AA−OH, where AA is Phe, Pro, Pra, Aha, or N-Me-Phe; 2.9 equiv of HATU, and 5 equiv of DIPEA in DMF for 2 h. Deprotection of Fmoc was accomplished using 20% piperidine in DMF for 1 h. Where N-Me amino acids were needed that were not commercially available, Fmoc was first removed using standard methods followed by treatment of the resin with 3 equiv of 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (NOSYL-Cl) and 5 equiv of collidine in DCM for 2 h. This activated resin was then treated with 8 mL of TMS-diazomethane and 0.5 mL of methanol in DCM overnight. Methylation was monitored by HPLC. To remove the NOSYL group, resin was treated with 3 equiv of 2-mercaptoethanol and 5 equiv of DBU for 1 h. 62 The end of each monomer was capped with benzo[g]quinoline. To form the 1,4 substituted triazole ring, the azide-containing peptide was cleaved with 98% trifuoroacetic acid (TFA), 1% triethyl silane (TES), and 1% water, and ether was precipitated to yield a crude yellow solid that was used without further purification. Next, the resin-bound alkyne was dried under a vacuum, and washed three times with dry THF. CuI (2 equiv) and DIPEA (50 equiv) were added to the vessel in anhydrous THF. After mixing for 15 min, azide (2 equiv based on resin loading) was added, and the resulting green/brown solution mixed overnight. The resin was then washed three times with THF, three times with DCM, three times with DMF, and three times with DCM, then cleaved with 98% TFA, 1% TES, and 1% water for 2 h followed by rotary evaporation and ether precipitation. Surface Plasmon Resonance. SPR was conducted using a Biacore X (Biacore, Inc.) instrument. Streptavidin was immobilized to 7500 RU in both flow cells using EDC/NHS coupling to a CM5 chip (GE). The surface was then blocked with ethanolamine. Next, 50 μM 5′-biotin HIV-1 FSS (obtained as an HPLC-purified sample from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) was refolded in 10 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl at pH 7.4 by heating at 98°C in a heater block for 2 min then cooled to RT and immobilized on one flow cell of the SPR chip to a density of 1100 RU. The control flow cell was then blocked with an injection of 50 μM biotin in 10 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl at pH 7.4. Compounds were injected at a flow rate of 50 μL/min in 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% tween at pH 7.4 for 1 min. Each injection was repeated twice for consistency. Each trace was fit individually to a Langmuir model. WST-1 Cytotoxicity Assay. HEK293T cells were plated at 1 × 10 4 cells/well in a 96-well plate in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C. After cells were allowed to adhere for 6 h, they were then incubated with the compound for 24 h in triplicate. A total of 10 μL of WST-1 premix (Clontech) was added and incubated for 1 h followed by measurement using a PerkinElmer EnSpire plate reader. Lines provided are a logistical fit of the data. Flow Cytometry. HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin−streptomycin at 37°C to 80% confluency in a 12-well plate and treated with the compound for 24 h. Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and washed twice with DPBS (Gibco). Cells were then resuspended in 300 μL of ice cold DPBS and incubated with 5 μL of propidium iodide to stain dead cells. A total of 10 000 events were collected using a BD LSR-II flow cytometer. RNASeq. HEK293T cells were plated in six-well plates and allowed to grow to 80% confluencey (about 1 million cells), then treated with 0, 6.83, and 20 μM 7 for 24 h in triplicate. Cells were then processed according to validated protocols developed by the University of Rochester Genomics Research Center and analyzed for RNAseq (Illumina). Sequenced reads were cleaned according to a rigorous preprocessing workflow (Trimmomatic-0.32 63 ) before being mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh38.p2) with STAR-2.4.2a. 64 Cufflinks2.0.2 65 with gencode version 23 human gene annotations was then used to perform differential expression analysis with a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05 (95% confidence interval). Pseudotyped HIV-1 Infectivity. The antiviral activity of all RNAtargeted compounds was measured by single-round infectivity assay with pseudotyped HIV-1 using HEK293T producer cells. The HIV-1 proviral vector (pDHIV3-GFP) includes all HIV-1 NL4−3 genes except nef (replaced with GFP) and env, thus preserving gag and pol, and the frameshift required for production of the Gag-Pol polyprotein. A single-round infectivity assay was conducted by transient transfection of the viral vector with VSV-G coat protein vector at a ratio of 1:0.5 using Fugene HD (Promega). The virus producer cells were dosed with compounds 4 h after transfection, and viral particles were harvested from the media 24 h after transfecting by filtering through a 0.45-μm syringe filter. Viral load was normalized with a p24 ELISA (PerkinElmer). The infections were performed using TZM-bl reporter cells containing stably integrated firefly luciferase, the expression of which is driven by the HIV-LTR promoter. Therefore, luciferase is expressed upon successful HIV infection. Triplicate infections in 96well plates at 10 000 cells/well with 500 pg p24/well proceeded for 48 h before the addition of SteadyGlo reagent (Promega) to each well for 30 min. Luminescence was measured as a quantitative metric for changes in viral infectivity in the presence of a compound.
