Thirty of 31 calves completed the study through 6 wk of age. One male calf, which was fed colostrum by suckling, died at 5 wk of age after prolonged diarrhea and was not included in data analyses related to feed intake and weight gain. The calf was included in data relating to health parameters such as fecal scores, electrolyte treatments, serum protein concentrations, and serum IgM and IgG concentrations that would be directly related to method of feeding colostrum. Of the 15 B calves, only three calves required the use of an esophageal feeder to supply part of the first allotment of colostrum. An esophageal feeder was only used if calves refused more than 0.24 L of colostrum after multiple attempts to feed the calf by nipple-bottle. Lactation numbers were similar for the dams of the S and B calves. For the dams of the S calves, eight were first lactation cows and eight were second or greater lactation cows. For the dams of the B calves, seven were first lactation and eight were second or greater lactation, with average colostrum quality of 87 and 89 mg/ml, respectively. Six dams of B calves either were first lactation animals that were difficult to milk, did not produce enough colostrum, or colostrum quality was low which required the use of frozen colostrum to provide calves with 2.84 L at birth and 2 L at 12 h after birth. Similar problems with low volume or low quality colostrum for dams of calves that are allowed to suckle naturally would place those calves at risk for failure of passive transfer of immunity. Performance of S and B calves is presented in Table  3 . The average number of days to weaning was greater (P = 0.1) for B calves compared with S calves. One explanation for this difference might be that calves left with their dams became accustomed to eating at frequent intervals compared to B calves, which were fed milk twice daily. If calves became accustomed to eating frequently, once they were restricted to twice daily feedings of milk, they may have continued to search for food at frequent intervals and become familiar with consuming grain earlier. Initial and final BW were similar for S and B calves (Table 3) . Total weight gain, total grain consumed, and total milk consumed were not different (P > 0.1) between treatments even though S calves weaned at an earlier age. Serum protein concentrations measured at birth were used for covariate analysis and averaged 4.2 ± 0.5 g/dl for B calves and 4.4 ± 0.3 g/dl for S calves. Mean SPC did not differ between treatments; however, there was a significant (P = 0.03) treatment × day effect for method of feeding colostrum (Figure 1 ). At 24 h after birth, the SPC was greater (P = 0.03) for B calves compared with S calves. The SPC at wk 1 tended (P = 0.1) to be greater for B calves compared with S calves. By wk 2, the mean SPC for both groups of calves was approximately 5.5 g/dl and remained fairly constant through the rest of the study. The percent increase in SPC by 24 h after the first feeding for B calves was 42.4% with only 2 of the 15 B calves having SPC less than 5.0 g/dl. In comparison, the mean increase in SPC for S calves from birth to 24 h was only 28.5% and six of the 16 calves (37.5%) allowed to suckle had SPC of 5.0 g/dl or less; indicating greater transfer of passive immunity to B calves and less than desired transfer to S calves (Table 3) . A SPC of 5.5 g/dl has been suggested as an indicator of minimal colostrum intake (Naylor et al., 1977; Wilson et al., 1994) . Tyler et al. (1998) , however, indicated that an SPC of 5.0 g/dl was a more reasonable goal based on the relative risk of mortality for calves with SPC less than 5.0 g/dl compared with calves with SPC > 5.0 g/dl. In a review of passive transfer of immunity in calves by Weaver et al. (2000) , the authors indicated that the percent of calves with SPC < 5.0 g/dl was a better indicator of risk of mortality than mean serum IgG or mean SPC. Selman et al. (1970) reported characteristics of calves allowed to suckle. They observed 30 cow and calf pairs (10 each of beef cows, dairy heifers, and dairy cows) for 8 h postpartum. Seven of the 30 calves (23%) did not suckle within the 8 h period. Selman et al. (1970) also reported that of the calves that suckled, the beef calves suckled at a mean of 81.4 min after birth, whereas the calves from dairy heifers required a mean of 218.3 min and the calves from the dairy cows required 261.1 min. The authors suggested that dairy cows have been bred for high milk production, resulting in more developed mammary glands compared with wild ungulates, making dairy cows harder to suckle. Abel Francisco and Quigley (1993) reported a decrease in apparent efficiency of absorption of Ig within 1 h after birth. The delay in consumption of colostrum that can occur in dairy calves allowed to suckle compared with calves fed by bottle may have contributed to the lower SPC at 24 h in S calves compared with B calves. In the current study, calves that were not observed to be standing and attempting to nurse were fed a small amount of maternal colostrum by bottle or were aided in suckling so that differences in Ig absorption between S and B calves were not as great as may have occurred if calves were left to suckle alone. The calf that died in the current study either failed to suckle the dam or failed to absorb immunoglobulins. The calf was observed to be standing and moving about the stall after birth, but SPC did not increase from birth to 24 h. Mean serum IgM and IgG concentrations did not differ between S and B calves (Figure 2) , and there was not a treatment × day interaction for method of feeding colostrum. Beginning serum IgM and IgG concentrations were tested as covariates but were removed from the model. In general, the shape of the curves for SPC, and serum IgM and IgG concentrations were similar; however, there was greater variability among calves in the concentrations of IgG and IgM, as measured by the ELISA assay, compared with the variability among calves for SPC as determined by a refractometer. Based on the ELISA assay, three of the S calves had IgG concentrations below 1 g/dl at 24 h compared with only 1 B calf with a serum IgG concentration below 1 g/dl. Values for SPC, and serum IgM and IgG concentrations were similar to previously reported values (Franklin et al., 1998) . The mean number of days calves had fecal scores greater than 2 and the mean number of electrolyte treatments per calf did not differ because of method of colostrum consumption (Table 3 ). Most incidences of fecal scores greater than 2 occurred during wk 2 and 3, which is consistent with previous reports (Quigley et al., 1995; Franklin et al., 1998) . Whereas the differences in SPC did not translate into significantly more days with diarrhea or increased electrolyte treatments, the calves in the current study were relatively healthy. Pathogens detected from fecal samples of calves with diarrhea were Cryptosporidium parvum, coronavirus, and rotavirus. The suspected cause of diarrhea in most of the calves, Cryptosporidium parvum, is not controlled by ingestion of colostrum (Harp et al., 1990) . Under less sanitary conditions, the lower transfer of passive immunity to the S calves compared with the B calves may have resulted in increased calf morbidity or mortality. Results from previous studies to determine the most effective method of supplying colostrum to calves are inconclusive. Many methods have been considered. Logan et al. (1981) , using Friesian calves, compared serum Ig concentrations of calves that suckled only with those of calves that were left with the dam but were fed approximately 1 L of hand-milked colostrum by bottle for the first feeding. Results indicated that only 23.2% of the calves allowed to suckle naturally acquired sufficient Ig, whereas 42.3% of calves fed 1 L of colostrum by hand and also were left with the dam to suckle acquired sufficient serum Ig concentrations. Nocek et al. (1984) reported that Holstein calves fed a total of 5.45 L of colostrum in three feedings by bottle during the first 12 h after birth had higher serum protein and serum IgG concentrations than calves that suckled. Besser et al. (1991) reported that failure of passive transfer (serum protein <5.0 g/dl or IgG <1.0 g/dl) occurred in 61% of Holstein calves allowed to suckle at birth compared to 19% failure of passive transfer in Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 86, No. 6, 2003 calves fed 1.9 L by bottle at birth and only 11% failure of passive transfer in calves fed 2.84 L by using an esophageal feeder at birth. In contrast, Quigley et al. (1995) reported that Jersey calves that suckled had higher serum IgG concentrations than did calves fed by bottle. The Jersey calves fed from bottles, however, were limited to only 2 L of colostrum (approximately 8% of BW) before obtaining the 24-h blood sample for analysis of passive transfer. Calves allowed to suckle the dam may have obtained a greater volume of colostrum than calves fed from a bottle, resulting in improved transfer of passive immunity for calves allowed to suckle. Stott et al. (1979b) also reported greater Ig absorption by Holstein calves allowed to suckle compared with calves fed by bottle; however, the amounts fed by bottle were limited to 1, 2, or 4 L during the first 12 h after birth. For the studies in which calves fed by bottle had better transfer of passive immunity, the amount fed to Holstein calves by bottle during the first 12 h varied considerably with volumes of 5.45 L (Nocek et al., 1984) , 4.74 L (present study), and either 2.84 L at birth or 3.8 L during the first 12 h (Besser et al., 1991) . In general, it appears that a volume of 2 L of colostrum at birth is the minimum that should be fed by bottle to a Holstein calf when the calf will only be fed twice during the first 12 h of life. In the present study using Holstein calves, seven of 15 calves voluntarily consumed 2.84 L by bottle during the first feeding and five more calves consumed between 2.6 and 2.84 L voluntarily. Only three calves required the use of an esophageal feeder for administration of colostrum. Therefore, 2.84 L of colostrum is likely the volume that should be fed at birth to maximize transfer of passive immunity without resorting to forced feeding of colostrum with an esophageal feeder. By removing calves from their dam and hand-feeding 2.84 L of high-quality colostrum as soon as possible after birth, calves should be exposed to fewer diseasecausing organisms and producers can insure that calves receive colostrum. Producers also can insure calves ingest colostrum before gut closure, which occurs by about 24 h after birth (Stott et al., 1979a) . Additionally, although feeding 4 L of colostrum at birth resulted in increased concentrations of Ig in serum compared with feeding 2 L of colostrum (Morin et al., 1997) , calves may not voluntarily consume 4 L and must be fed using an esophageal feeder. Morin et al. (1997) reported that 7 of 11 calves (64%) fed 4 L at birth required the use of an esophageal feeder for one or more meals compared with 10 of 40 calves (25%) fed 2 L of colostrum. Feeding 2.84 L at birth provided greater transfer of passive immunity compared to suckling, without requiring the use of an esophageal feeder for most of the calves.
