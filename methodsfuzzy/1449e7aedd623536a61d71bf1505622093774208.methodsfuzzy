Ascitic fluid sample (n= 27) and postmortem tissues (n=15) were collected from 42 clinically ill client-owned presented at University Veterinary Hospital, Universiti Putra Malaysia (UVH -UPM) during 4-year period (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) . The sampled cats comprises of 28 male and 14 females with age range from 6 month to 5 years. All cats came from neibouring areas within Klang valley and had no previous history of vaccination against FCoV as FIP vaccination is not a common practice in most clinics. Samples were consecutively designated as FCoV UPM1C/07 to UPM42C/10. The samples were processed and inoculated onto the CrFK (ATCC W ; CCL-94) and Fcwf-4 (ATCC; CRL-2787) as described previously [13] . Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of cell cultures was carried as described by Hsiung [14] . On the other hand, indirect immunofluorescent (IIF) test using polyclonal antibodies against FIPV 79-1146 virus was performed according to the method of Evermann et al. [15] . Viral RNA was extracted from infected cell cultures or Ascites fluid using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed using Access RT-PCR system (Promega, USA) [6] with previously described primers p205 and p211 [16] . Positive samples were further differentiated into type I and type II FCoV using biotypes specific oligonucleotide primers targeting S-gene region [17] . All primers were synthesized by First Base Laboratories Sdn Bhd, Selangor, Malaysia. To gain insight on the genetic relatedness of Malaysian FCoV isolates, the partial S-gene sequences of randomly selected RT-PCR positive samples (n=13) were sequenced using the ABI BigDye W Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Bioscience). Nucleotide sequences were compared with the corresponding reference FCoV isolates using BLAST software available in NCBI database. Phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA5 software using Neighbor Joining tree method.
