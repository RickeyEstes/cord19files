The statistical model developed was implemented in two steps: firstly, an exponential model relating the accumulated number of confirmed cases and time was considered. Secondly, the rate of spread was used as dependent variable in a linear model that took as independent variables temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. Only cases belonging to China were considered as an attempt to control both cultural aspects and policies adopted to contain the virus. Therefore, data from the 31 provinces of Mainland China were gathered from the 23 rd January up to the 1 st of March, completing 39 days. These data were completed with meteorological variables, comprising temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed, collected for the same period, using the Meteostat Application Programming Interface (API). 21 We searched for meteorological stations containing hourly measurements of these variables for the whole 39-day time period that were closest .

To compute the rate of spread a simple exponential model was assumed, described by: where N0 is the number of infected at instant zero, represents the rate of infection or the rate of spread and t is the time. A more natural way of interpreting is by transforming it into the doubling time, Td, given by: The doubling time is the time needed to duplicate the number of infected subjects. Since the rate of progression changes over time and the exponential model does not hold any longer, we considered mainly the initial days of the time series, selecting several periods of time composed each one of a predetermined number of consecutive days, but with different starting points. The starting point was assumed by randomly choosing the first day of the period. For each province several periods were sampled, allowing to obtain more than one value of the rate of progression ( Figure 1 ). Two different periods of time of 12 and 15 days were tested, along with 3 and 5 different starting points. For each rate of progression, a corresponding value of each meteorological variable was computed, taking into account the same period of time. We opted to use the median of the meteorological variables (temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed) as it is more robust than the mean and tends to better represent the central tendency of the variable. Only models attaining more than 0.75 for the adjusted R square value were selected. .
