Laboratory methods are often included in epidemiologic studies. In an outbreak investigation, laboratory methods enhance case definition by confirming disease diagnosis. If the same infectious agent can be isolated from the epidemiologically identified source, the investigation is confirmed. Seroepidemiology studies use laboratory measures to describe the prevalence of previous exposure to an infectious agent. The purpose of a clinical epidemiologic study might be to identify early markers of disease or predictors of prognosis that can be identified in the laboratory. In environmental epidemiologic studies, laboratory assays may be used to measure exposure. In the ideal case, all these studies would be molecular epidemiology studies, not just because they use molecular tools, but because the choice of molecular tool and the implications of that choice are accounted for in the design, conduct, and analysis. Unfortunately, this is often not the case, which weakens any inferences that might be made from the study. A typical example is using a standard laboratory test for diagnosis. Is the study participant sick or not? Consider the disease strep throat. Strep throat comes with a sore throat, white or yellow spots on the throat or tonsils, and high fever. This sounds definitive, but the same clinical presentation can include other diseases, including infectious mononucleosis. Everyone who has strep throat, by definition, has group A Streptococcus growing in their throat. However, not everyone who has group A Streptococcus growing in their throat has a strep throat, even if they have a sore throat (the symptoms might be due to a viral infection). Further, there are several ways to detect the presence of group A Streptococcus, which vary in sensitivity, specificity, and type of information provided. Some give a yes/no answer, and others give information on the amount of bacteria present. Others test for specific characteristics of the bacteria, such as presence of a toxin Streptococcus can produce. If the individual has been treated recently with an antibiotic, it is likely that no group A Streptococcus will be detected by culture, but later, group A Streptococcus might be cultured from their throat! So, when and if the individual has symptoms, symptom severity and whether the individual has been treated matter. Using a laboratory test alone is not definitive for diagnosis, but it is necessary. However, if the study is to determine how many individuals are carrying group A Streptococcus, it may be sufficient, although the investigator must decide at what level of detection an individual is "carrying" the organism, and if those with symptoms will be considered as a different category. Further, if it matters what type of group A Streptococcus is found, another laboratory method may be optimal. This is a relatively simple example, but it illustrates how the research question constrains the molecular tool, and how the molecular tool can constrain the timing of specimen collection. How to choose an appropriate molecular tool, how it can constrain the study design, and what it implies about the conduct and analysis of the results are the focus of this text.
