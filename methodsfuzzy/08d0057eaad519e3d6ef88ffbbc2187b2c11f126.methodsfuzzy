Cell culture -Aedes albopictus cells (C6/36) (ATCC CRL-1660; Manassas, VA, USA) were grown at 28ºC in Leibovitz L-15 medium (Gibco/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 0.26% tryptose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 25 μg/mL gentamicin (Gibco/Invitrogen) and 5% foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco/Invitrogen). Aedes pseudoscutellaris cells (AP61) were grown at 28ºC in Leibovitz L-15 medium supplemented with 0.52% tryptose, 25 μg/mL gentamicin and 10% FBS. Aedes aegypti cells (Aag-2) (ATCC CCL-125) were grown at 28ºC in Schneider´s insect medium (Gibco/Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 7 .0000.5248). The laboratory diagnosis of acute ZIKV infection was confirmed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). (10) Additionally, the sera were negative for anti-ZIKV IgM using an in-house enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on a previously described methodology. (11) ZIKV was isolated from human serum samples by direct inoculation of C6/36 (5 x 10 5 cells seeded in a 25 cm 2 Tissue Culture Flask) and Vero E6 cells (10 5 cells seeded in a 25 cm 2 Tissue Culture Flask) or by intracerebral inoculation of 2-day-old BALB/c mice (CEUA Fiocruz: LW-2/17) as detailed below. Attempts to isolate the ZV BR 2015/15098 in cell culture were not successful. Therefore, two-day-old BALB/c mice (n = 5) were inoculated intracranially with the serum sample (~ 20 µL). Ten days post-inoculation, the virus was recovered from two of them. The passage 0 (P0) corresponds to a 10% mouse brain suspension in PBS. ZV BR 2015/15261 viral isolation (P0) was performed on C6/36 cells for 22 days of culture, with medium exchange occurring at day 8. The isolation of ZV BR 2016/16288 was successful in both the C6/36 and Vero E6 cells, with the virus collection occurring on day 17 post-inoculation. The viral isolations were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence (12) using an anti-ZIKV E protein specific monoclonal antibody (produced by ICC/ Fiocruz-PR) and/or by RT-PCR and sequencing. To perform an in vitro biological characterisation of the three ZIKV isolates, we first amplified the ZIKV ZV BR 2015/15098, ZV BR 2015/15261 and ZV BR 2016/16288 isolates by three additional rounds of infection in Ae. albopictus C6/36 cells; a low multiplicity of infection (MOI of 0.01) was used to generate working virus stocks (passage 3 -P3). Virus titration was carried out on the same cell line by the focus-forming assay, adapted from a previously described protocol. (13) The complete genomes of the ZIKV isolates were obtained by sequencing the overlapping PCR products. The viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and was reverse transcribed with Improm-II Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and 10 µM random primers. PCR was performed using the LongRange PCR kit (Qiagen) with 0.8 µM primers [Supplementary data (Table I) ]. The amplicons were purified using High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche) or QIAquick Gel extraction Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced by Macrogen DNA sequencing service (Seoul, South Korea) in an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using specific ZIKV primers [Supplementary data (Table II) ]. The ZIKV RNA genomes were assembled using Phred/Phrap/Consed software (http://www.phrap.org/ phredphrapconsed.html), and the polyprotein amino acid sequences and the UTRs were annotated. ZV BR 2016/16288 P3 and ZV BR 2015/15261 P3 were shown to have identical sequences to the viruses that were previously sequenced from the P0 and patient sera, respectively; these sequences have been previously deposited (Gen-Bank accession numbers MF073357 and MF073358). ZV BR 2015/15098 P3 was submitted to the GenBank database under the accession number MK566202. Sequence analyses -Two different datasets were used for the phylogenetic analysis. For dataset 1, only the sequences with 100% query coverage in a Blast (https:// blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) search using ZV BR 2016/16288 as the query were selected. The sequences were aligned using ClustalW as implemented in BioEdit version 7.2.6.1 and were manually edited in the ORF region to avoid codon disruption by inserted gaps. Dataset 2 comprised sequences presenting 100% query coverage in a Blast search using ZV BR 2016/16288 ORF as the query. The sequences were codon aligned using Muscle as implemented in MEGA 7.0.26. Redundant sequences, sequences which presented no information regarding the country or collection date, and the sequences of synthetic constructs were excluded from both datasets. RDP4 Beta 4.97 was used to identify potential recombinants and to exclude them from the alignment as described in. ModelGenerator v0.85 was used for the selection of a nucleotide substitution model. Phylogenetic tree inference was performed in MrBayes v.3.2.6. using three hot chains and one cold chain and was run for 1 million (dataset 1) or 6 million (dataset 2) generations with a 25% burn-in. FigTree v.1.4.3 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/ software/figtree/) and Inkscape 0.92 were used to edit the tree. The HMMTOP tool (http://www.enzim.hu/ hmmtop/), which was run with the default settings, was used for the prediction of the transmembrane helices in the NS2A protein. The hydrophobicity plot of the NS4B protein was computed using the ProtScale tool (https:// web.expasy.org/protscale/) based on a Kyte & Doolittle scale with the default settings. For the RNA secondary structure prediction in the 3'UTR, the mfold web server (http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/RNA-Folding-Form) was used with the default settings. Only the highest revised free energy structure is presented. In vitro kinetics infection -To perform the biological characterisation studies of recent ZIKV clinical isolates we used two well-characterised ZIKV strains, MR766 and PE243, as reference viruses. The African ZIKV MR766 strain (GenBank accession number NC_012532) was originally isolated in 1947 from a rhesus monkey. The Asian ZIKV PE243 (GenBank accession number KX197192) was isolated in Recife from a patient with classical symptoms of ZIKV infection in 2015. The ZIKV strains ZV BR 2015/15098, ZV BR 2015/15261, ZV BR 2016/16288, MR766 and PE243 were used to infect mammalian (Vero E6, Huh7.5 and A549 cell lines seeded into 96-well plates at densities of 1.5 x 10 4 cells/well) and insect (Aag-2, AP61 and C6/36 cell lines seeded into 96well plates at densities of 1.5 x 10 4 , 3 x 10 4 and 8 x 10 3 cells/well, respectively) cells at an MOI of 0.1 and 1 for one hour. After, the viral inoculum was removed followed by the addition of the appropriate media. The percentage of infected cells was evaluated 24, 48 and 72 hours post infection (h.p.i.) by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-flavivirus monoclonal antibody (mAb 4G2; ATCC HB-112). The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. The images were obtained with the Operetta CLS high-content imaging system (PerkinElmer) with a 20x objective and were quantified using Harmony software (PerkinElmer). Virus biological characterisation -Initially, an infection kinetics assay was performed using the MOIs of 0.1 and 1 for 24, 48 and 72 h.p.i to select the best time point and MOI to carry the biological characterisation experiments in the different cell lines. Vero E6, Huh7.5 and A549 cells were infected with the ZIKV strains using an MOI of 0.1 and a period of incubation of 48 h. AP61 and C6/36 cells were infected with the ZIKV strains using an MOI of 1 and a period of incubation of 72 h. The cells were plated in 96 well plates, and after the period of incubation, the cells were fixed with methanol:acetone (v/v). The expression of viral E protein was analysed by immunofluorescence using an anti-flavivirus monoclonal antibody (mAb 4G2), as described above. In addition, the same infection was performed in 24 well plates. The cell supernatants were collected for virus titration by focus-forming assay, and the total RNA was extracted from cells for subsequent ZIKV genome RNA quantification. For all the experiments, the mock-infected cells were used as the negative control for the infection. The statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test. The differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Virus quantification -The viral load from the culture supernatants of ZIKV-infected cells was determined by focus-forming assays in C6/36 cells using an anti-flavivirus monoclonal antibody (mAb 4G2). (13) ZIKV genomic RNA quantification -RNA was extracted from mock-or ZIKV-infected cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's recommendation. ZIKV RT-qPCR was performed in a 20 μL reaction master mix (Promega) containing 10 ng of sample RNA, 500 nM of the ZIKV1086 and ZIKV1162c oligonucleotides and 200 nM of ZIKV1107-FAM probe according to a previously described protocol. (10) The amplifications were performed with a LightCycler 96 instrument (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). For the analyses of mammalian cells, a similar RT-qPCR protocol was performed to amplify the RNase P housekeeping gene. (14) For the analyses of mosquito cells, RT-qPCR using 250 nM of the primers 18SF (5'-CCCGTCGGCATG-TATTAGCT-3') and 18SR (5'-CACGGCCGGTACAGT-GAAAC-3') was performed for the amplification of the 18S rRNA gene, which was used as housekeeping gene for those cells. The housekeeping genes were included in all analyses for data normalisation. The relative ZIKV genomic RNA expression level was determined by calculating the 2 -ΔCT . (15) The statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test. The differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Human monocyte-derived Dendritic Cell culture and ZIKV infection -The peripheral blood samples were obtained by venipuncture from six healthy donors after written consent was given (Committee of Research Ethics from Fiocruz-CAAE: 49931415.7.1001.5248/ Fiocruz). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained by density gradient separation with Ficoll-Paque PLUS at a density of 1.077 g/mL (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). CD14 + cells were purified by positive selection with human anti-CD14 Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. For dendritic cell differentiation, CD14 + cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza) containing 100 IU/mL penicillin (Gibco), 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Gibco), 10% FBS supplemented with 25 ng/mL interleukin-4 (IL-4) and 12.5 ng/ mL granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) and were incubated at 37ºC in 5% CO 2. Three days later, new media was added, and the cells were incubated for 4 more days. The monocyte-derived Dendritic Cell (mdDC) differentiation was confirmed by flow cytometry using anti-CD11c-PE-Cy5, anti-CD209-APC and anti-CD14-BV450 antibodies (all from BD Bioscience, CA, USA). For ZIKV infection of mdDCs, 10 5 cells/well were distributed into 96-well plates and were incubated for 1 h 30 min with ZV BR 2015/15098, ZV BR 2015/15261, ZV BR 2016/16288, ZIKV PE243 and ZIKV MR766 at an MOI of 10. After removal of the inoculum, the cells were washed with PBS and were incubated with fresh medium for 24 h at 37ºC in 5% CO 2 . For the negative control (mock), mdDCs were incubated with uninfected C6/36 cell culture supernatants. The cell-free supernatants were collected for virus titration by focus-forming assays and the total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets (RNeasy mini kit -Qiagen) to quantify the ZIKV genomic RNA. The ZIKV infections of mdDCs were evaluated by flow cytometry using anti-human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) as follows: anti-CD11c-PE-Cy5, CD14-BV450 and CD209-APC (BD Pharmingen, CA, USA) and their respective isotype controls. For intracellular ZIKV envelope protein detection, the mdDCs were permeabilised with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) and were stained with 4G2-FITC at 1:200 (v/v) in Perm/Wash buffer. The cell suspensions were ac-quired in a FACSCanto II instrument (BD Biosciences) and were analysed by FlowJo software, version 10.0.7 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA). The dendritic cells were first gated as CD11c + CD14cells and then were gated as CD11c + CD209 + cells; finally, 4G2 + cells show the frequency of infected cells. The statistical analyses were performed using PRISM (version 7.0; GraphPad, San Diego, USA). The significance was determined using a paired, nonparametric test (Wilcoxon) among different stimulations in the same group. The values of p ≤ 0.05 were considered significant.
