A cross-sectional countrywide survey study was performed on the epidemiology of NSSI among HCWs at 30 hospitals in 19 cities throughout the country. Data relating to the epidemiology of NSSIs were collected using a standard questionnaire in 2004. Results: Totally 5048 HCWs completed the questionnaire forms. Nurses are the leading group (2016 persons) that joined into the study were followed by doctors (1452 persons) andlaboratory technicians (475). Totally 2498 of them (49.5%) declared an occupational exposure or NSSI in the last 12 months related their job. Needle stick injury was reported in 1698 of them (33.6%), splash into the eye in 1132 (22.4%), sharp injury in 737 (14.6%), and the other injuries in 419 (7.0%). The hepatitis positivity was reported in 567 cases (2.27%) Objectives: To assess the microbiological status of reprocessed single-use devices for interventional cardiology by testing bioburden, sterility and pyrogenic load. Methods: A total amount of 154 electrophysiology non-lumen catheters (EP) were collected after the first clinical use on patient. 20 devices were contaminated with bacteria spiked human blood and underwent four different pre-sterilization protocols including chlorine, polyphenol, and enzymatic agents. Treated samples were assayed by cultural quantitative methods (CQM) for bactericidal properties and electron microscopy (EM) for biologic residuals. 73 EP were tested for sterility. By the repetition of simulated-use (bacteria spiked blood) and regeneration (enzymatic and chlorine treatment, gas plasma sterilization) we obtained 54, 39, 26, 28, 36, 22 samples respectively reprocessed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 times. Devices were cultured for 28 days in trypticase soy broth. The pyrogenic status of 61 EP was monitored after clinical use, after decontamination-cleaning treatments and after complete reprocessing by LAL test. Results: High-resolution EM and CQM confirmed the superior properties of chlorine releasing agent added to enzymatic detergent for devices treatment before sterilization. Hypochlorous acid based protocols were more biocide (>3.1 log CFU reduction) than polyphenolic (3.2-1.9 log CFU reduction). Sterility tests showed no positive sample to inoculated strain until the fourth cycle of reprocessing. Catheters showed the growth of the inoculated strain, Bacillus subtilis in 1/35 and 1/22 samples after five cycles and six cycles respectively. Every reprocessed device was non-pyrogenic (<20 EU/catheter). In addition, tests conducted on in-vitro spiked catheters showed that pyrogenic loads of 200 EU/device were reduced to less than 11 EU/device. Conclusions: Reprocessing procedures following the adopted regeneration protocol were able to satisfy the fundamental microbiological requirements until five in-vitro reuses. Sterility tests showed that devices' sterility was not guaranteed after five reuses. Pre-sterilization treatments including enzymatic solutions and chlorine revealed high cleaning properties with effective bioburden reduction. Storage intervals among reprocessing steps longer than 24 hours should be avoided in order to limit contamination and pyrogenic load. Technical considerations suggest to consider the introduction of reprocessing procedure only in hospitals with a considerable workload.
