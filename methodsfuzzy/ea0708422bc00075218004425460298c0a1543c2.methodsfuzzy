This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted with 94 preterm infants treated at Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, between June 2008 and May 2012 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/ NCT00167700). The infants were recruited between the first and third days of life. The inclusion criteria were as follows: gestational age between 32 1 0 and 36 1 6 weeks, birth weight of greater than 1500 g, and absence of any congenital defects preventing enteral nutrition. The standard of care in our unit is to give either maternal or pasteurized donated breast milk to all preterm infants. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2000. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the infants, and the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of South-West Finland. The major challenge in this trial was the recruitment of patients. In Finland the use of commercially available probiotic Abbreviations used RR: Rate ratio RSV: Respiratory syncytial virus RTI: Respiratory tract infection products, even among newborns, is highly widespread, and most of the parents recruited did not want to participate in the study because they wanted to give their infant probiotics.
