In this prospective surveillance study, we enrolled children under 2 years old who were hospitalised with fever and/or respiratory symptoms between 16 March 2010 and 31 March 2013 at Al-Bashir Hospital in Amman, Jordan (detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria previously reported). 12 Subjects were recruited 5 days a week (Sunday through Thursday) within 48 hours of hospital admission. 12 Children with chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and newborns who had never been discharged after birth were excluded from the study. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians. setting Al-Bashir Hospital is one of the three major government hospitals in Amman, which is Jordan's largest city and capital. 12 We estimate that during the study period, the hospital provided care for â‰ˆ55% of all children in Amman (author Samir Faouri (2014), unpublished data). Additionally, the paediatric wards admitted 17 557 children, 11 230 (64%) of whom were under 2 years of age.
