2.1.1. Cells, viruses, immunofluorescent assay (IFA), and cytopathic effect (CPE) Swine testicular (ST) epithelial cells and the Taiwan fieldisolated virulent strain of TGEV were grown and propagated as described (Yang et al., 2007b) . IFA and CPE and cytotoxicity assays were also as described (Yang et al., 2007b) . Briefly, ST cells in 96-well plates, with or without a 2 h pretreatment with test compounds, were infected with TGEV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 for IFA. The IFA was performed at 6 h post-infection (hpi) with antibodies against the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of TGEV. The cells were treated with 10 different concentrations of test compounds. The results of these assays were used to obtain the dose-response curves from which 50% maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) values were determined. For the CPE assay, TGEV was inoculated into a monolayer of ST cells in 12-well plates at 5 MOI, and the CPE was determined at 24 hpi for detection of anti-TGEV activity. TGEV-induced CPE is characterized by a rounding and enlargement of cells, formation of syncytia, and detachment of cells into the medium. Results presented are representative of at least 3 independent experiments. For cytotoxicity assay, ST cells cultured in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen, Inc.) and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Co.) in 96-well plates were treated with 10 different concentrations of test compounds for 24 h. The resulting dose-response curves were used to determine 50% maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) values. Vero 76 cells and SARS CoV Urbani strain were grown and propagated as described (Barnard et al., 2006) . SARS CoV-related CPE inhibition and neutral red uptake assays for determination of antiviral efficacy (EC 50 ) and compound cytotoxicity (CC 50 ) were performed as described (Barnard et al., 2006) . 2.2. Chemicals, western blot analysis, viral RNA isolation and relative quantification by real-time RT-PCR These assays were performed as described (Yang et al., 2007b) ; antibody against human GAPDH was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (MA, USA). DMSO, PEG400 and DMA were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Inc. (MO, USA). Infergen TM was interferon alfacon-1 lot 002586 kindly provided by Intermune, Inc. (Brisbane, CA).
