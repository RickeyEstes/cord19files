Eighty-seven dust samples were collected using sterile cotton swaps from air-handler units (39 samples), vents at ceiling (37 samples), and grilles of room air-conditioners (11 samples) installed in a four-story building located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The dust particles were spread onto non-nutrient agar (NNA) plates prepared from PAS (PAGE amoebae saline) and overlaid with thin layers of living Escherichia coli. Culture plates were parafilm-sealed and incubated at ambient temperature (26 ± 2 • C) for up to two weeks. The plates were examined daily under inverted microscope for the appearance of discrete growth of Acanthamoeba. Once growth was spotted, a small piece of NNA containing the amoebae (trophozoites or cysts) was excised from the primary culture plates and inoculated onto fresh NNA plate culture plates for culture maintenance. In primary cultures, Acanthamoeba cells could exist as mixed isolates. Therefore cell cloning was necessary to produce singlespecies cell lines. Four to six cysts were isolated from each Acanthamoeba positive culture, and respectively amplified in xenic culture condition. Cysts of the cloned cell lines were subjected to axenisation with 3% (v/v) HCl overnight. Following the treatment, cells were seeded in peptone-yeast-glucose (PYG) medium incorporated with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 g/ml gentamicin (Sigma) for cultivations. Acanthamoeba isolates which could proliferate well in axenic culture condition were subsequently cultured in PYG medium alone. The Acanthamoeba genus-specific JDP1-JDP2 primer pair was employed in molecular detection of Acanthamoeba in samples (Schroeder et al., 2001) . Total genomic DNA was extracted from trophozoites of Acanthamoeba using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Amplification reactions were performed according to Schroeder et al. (2001) . PCR amplicons known as ASA.S1 were separated by a 1.5% agarose gel prepared in 0.5 × LB TM agarose electrophoresis buffer (Faster Better Media LLC, United States) and was incorporated with ethidium bromide. Electrophoresis was run at 250 V for 45 min using the 0.5 × LB TM agarose electrophoresis buffer as running buffer. After electrophoresis, gels were viewed under UV illumination in the chamber of BioDoc-It TM Imaging System (UVP, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Amplicon sizes were estimated by comparing with the GeneRuler 100 bp DNA ladder Plus (Fermentas Life Science, Canada). The ASA.S1 amplicons from selected isolates were gel-purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) prior to sequencing. The purified amplicons were sequenced directly at both strands using the amplification primers in an ABI PRISM ® 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). DNA chromatograms were examined using the Chromas LITE software version 2.01 (Technelysium Pty. Ltd., Queensland, Australia). The forward and reverse sequences were pair-wise aligned using the ClustalW2 software (Labarga et al., 2007) and were manually refined to obtain a better consensus sequence. For nucleotide similarities search analyses, each consensus sequence was blasted against all eukaryotic nucleotide sequences archived in the GenBank database (Altschul et al., 1990) . Nucleotide residues corresponded to primer regions were excluded from the similarities search analyses. To establish the evolutionary lineages between the present isolates with reference sequences of the 15 published genotypes, a phylogram was constructed from the alignments of the present ASA.S1 sequences and the corresponding 18S rRNA sequences of reference strains, using the neighbour-joining method of MEGA version 4 (Tamura et al., 2007) . Nucleotide substitutions were calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter algorithm and the reliability of tree constructed was determined by bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates. The DNA sequences obtained in this study have been deposited in the Genbank database with the following accession numbers: FJ970627 to FJ970647. Axenic Acanthamoeba cell lines which were identified in pure clone by PCR-sequencing, together with the xenic clones, were characterized morphologically according to the keys of Pussard and Pons (1977) . Wet smear morphology of cysts and trophozoites of Acanthamoeba isolates was determined under light microscopy. Student's t-test was used to determine the statistical differences between the mean cysts diameter of Acanthamoeba isolates which were grown in xenic condition and axenic condition respectively. For temperature tolerance test, four sets of culture plates, each plate centrally placed with a small NNA block saturated with cysts of the respective Acanthamoeba isolates were prepared. One set of culture plates were directly incubated at 37 • C whereas another set were at 42 • C. The remaining two sets of culture plates were respectively exposed to 46 and 52 • C overnight prior to incubations at ambient temperature. All plates were examined daily for migrating and proliferating trophozoites for seven days. For osmotic tolerance test, small agar blocks containing Acanthamoeba cysts were placed centrally on NNA culture plates incorporated with 1 M Dmannitol or without the saccharide (negative control). Culture plates were incubated at ambient temperature for seven days and were similarly scored for the presence of migrating trophozoites. The experiments were repeated in triplicates. A pathogenic strain of A. castellanii (Strain CDC:0184:V014, ATCC 50492; originally from a keratitis patient from India), was used as positive control whenever necessary.
