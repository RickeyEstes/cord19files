Plasmids and oligonucleotides. The OARD1 coding sequence was amplified from human cDNA using Gateway (Invitrogen)-compatible primers and cloned into pDONR/Zeo (Invitrogen). GW-p-N-TAP-C6orf130 was generated by Gateway recombination between pDONR/Zeo-C6orf130 and a Gateway-compatible pcDNA5/ FRT/TO-N-TAP vector 20 . A sequence-optimized TARG1/C6orf130 fragment was amplified from pNic28-BSA4-C6orf130 (kindly provided by H. Schüler, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm) using Gateway-compatible primers and recombination into pDONR/Zeo. This pDONR/Zeo-C6orf130 clone was used for gateway cloning of the OARD1 coding sequence into pDEST17 (Invitrogen), pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen), GW-pEGFP 68 , pcDNA3-FLAG, pLKO-T-REX-HA-DEST-Neo (kindly provided by F. Stegmeier, Novartis). For generation of pcDNA5/FRT/ TO-EGFP-TARG1 plasmids, the EGFP-TARG1 fragment from GW-pEGFP-TARG1 was amplified using primers containing BamHI restriction sites and cloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO. Mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The mCherry-H2B plasmid was a kind gift from E. Ferrando-May (Bioimaging Center, University of Konstanz). The plasmid for bacterial expression of GST-ARTD10(818-1025) has been described 20 . pGEX-4T1-ALY served as a plasmid for bacterial expression of GST-ALY. pcDNA3.1-based Pentaprobe plasmids were a gift from J. Mackay 41 . For the generation of Flp-In ™ T-REx ™ cell lines with inducible expression of shRNA constructs, a modified pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector was constructed: The H1 promoter from pSUPER 69 was modified with Tet regulator sequences. The fragment containing the modified H1 promoter and the shRNA cloning site was cloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO, replacing the CMV/TetO 2 promoter. A second BglII site in the resulting pcDNA5 vector was mutated. The resulting pcDNA5/FRT/TO-Super-Tet vector was digested with HindIII and BglII and ligated with annealed pairs of the oligonucleotides shTARG1_ORF_fwd (gatcgagagatgggcgatatatacgaatatatatcgcccatctctc) and shTARG1_ORF_rev (agctgagagatgggcgatatatattcgtatatatcgcccatctctc) or shCtrl_fwd (gatcagaagagtttagaggcaatcgaaattgcctctaaactcttc) and shCtrl_rev (agctgaagagtttagaggcaatttcgattgcctctaaactcttct). shRNA sequences (underlined) were taken from 9 . For the generation of CRISPR-Cas9(D10A) knock-out constructs oligonucleotides defining the gRNA sequences were annealed in pairs and cloned into a modified pX335 vector (Addgene 42335) containing a GFP-puromycin selection cassette [70] [71] [72] and verified by sequencing: (1) forward: caccccaattacagcatgtgtaaa, reverse: aaactttacacatgctgtaattgg (2) foward: cacccagattggaggaaggggtg, reverse: aaacgcaccccttcctccaatctg (3) foward: caccgctctctgctaagcaggctg, reverse: aaaccagcctgcttagcagagagc (4) forward: caccagcaccctctgcttgaagct, reverse: aaacagcttcaagcagagggtgc. Cell lines and cell culture. All cell lines were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 in a humidified atmosphere. Transfections were performed using calcium phosphate precipitation. HeLa OARD1 −/− cell clones were generated by transfection of HeLa cells with equal amounts of four different pX335 plasmids encoding the four different gRNAs for 24 h, followed by selection of transfected cells with 1 µg/ml puromycin for 24 h. Single cell clones were picked after ∼14 days and were expanded. Genomic DNA was isolated from each clone using the High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche) and used as a template in genotyping PCR reactions using oligonucleotides Ex4-fwd (tgggttgtgaggaaacatga) and Ex4-rev (gccatcactggactggagtt) for amplification of the wildtype allele and Ex1_fwd (tggttgtacagggcaatcag) and Int5-rev (ttgcaacaccctggtaagaa) for identification of the deletion. HeLa Tandem affinity purification. Large-scale purification of TAP-TARG1-containing protein complexes was performed as described previously 20 with a few modifications: 5 × 10 7 cells were trypsinized and transferred to spinner flasks in 250 ml non-selective cell culture medium. Cells were cultivated under constant stirring at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 and diluted with fresh medium every 24-48 h to a final culture volume of 1 l. Cells were treated with 1 µg/ ml doxycycline for 14 h to induce expression of TAP fusion proteins. All harvesting, centrifugation and purification steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Cells were pelleted at 200 × g and washed once with ice-cold PBS. The cells were pelleted again, were resuspended in 20 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT, 100 μM sodium vanadate, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail, ±10 µM olaparib) and lysed for 30 min under permanent agitation. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with 160 μl equilibrated IgG Sepharose for 1 h under permanent agitation. Beads were pelleted at 500 × g for 3 min and washed three times with TEV buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT). The beads were pelleted and TEV cleavage was performed in 300 µl TEV buffer with 3 µl (30 U) of TEV protease for 3 h under permanent agitation. The bead supernatants were then transferred to a fresh tube. The IgG Sepharose pellet was resuspended in three volumes of CaM binding buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mM magnesium acetate, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM imidazole, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and pelleted again. The supernatant and the supernatant of the TEV cleavage were pooled for the subsequent CBP pulldown, which was performed after addition of 1/200 volume of 1 M CaCl 2 to the supernatants with 50 µl equilibrated Calmodulin Sepharose for 90 min under permanent agitation. The beads were washed three times with CaM wash buffer (50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0, 75 mM NaCl, 1 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM imidazole, 2 mM CaCl 2 ). Residual buffer was removed carefully from the pellet and dry pellets were stored at −80 °C until mass spectrometry analysis. Mass spectrometry analysis and data analysis. The dried pellets were processed for MS-analysis as described previously 73 . In brief, the dried beads from the TAP-purification were digested for 1 hour at room temperature in 2 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 5 μg/mL Trypsin, followed by two washes with 2 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 1 mM DTT. The pooled supernatants were left to digest o/n at RT. After iodoacetamide modification and acidification of the samples, the peptides were desalted using homemade C18-tips and lyophilized. Peptides were analyzed on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer connected to an Ultimate Ultra3000 chromatography system incorporating an autosampler (both Thermo Scientific). Proteolytic peptides for each sample (5 μL) were applied to a home-made column (250-mm length, 75-μm inside diameter) (packed with 1.8 μm UChrom C18) and separated using a 40-min reverse-phase acetonitrile gradient [5-32% (vol/vol) acetonitrile] with a 250-nL/min flow rate. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode with a capillary temperature of 220 °C and a 2200 V potential applied to the column. Analysis of +olaparib samples (two TAP-purifications): Peptides were loaded onto an Ultimate 3000 nanoLC system (Dionex/Thermo Scientific); trapped on a precolumn (Acclaim PepMap100, C18, 5 µm, 100 Å, 300 µm i.d. × 5 mm, Thermo Scientific) for 10 min and subsequently separated using an analytical column (Acclaim PepMap100, C18, 5 µm, 100 Å, 75 µm i.d. × 25 cm, Thermo Scientific) employing a 130 min gradient (0-10 min: 5% buffer B (buffer A: 0.1% FA; buffer B: 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% FA), 10-105 min: 10-45% buffer B, 105-107 min: 45-100% buffer B; 107-113 100% buffer B; 113-130 min 5% buffer B). All samples were measured in duplicate on an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). MS settings: full scan spectra (Orbitrap) range: m/z 350 to m/z 1500, with a resolution of 120000 and an AGC setting of 5e5 ions; data dependent mode; 20 s dynamic exclusion; top 10 precursor fragmentation in the ion trap with a collision energy of 35%. Analysis of the raw data was performed using MaxQuant (version 1.5.1.2, 74 ) with the built-in Andromeda search engine 75 . The spectra were searched against the human SwissProt database version 06/2015 (canonical and isoforms). The MaxQuant default settings (including mass tolerance) were used. Specific settings: Trypsin as the protease (two missed cleavages); Carbamidomethylation (Cys) as the fixed modification; Oxidation (Met), Phosphorylation (Ser, Thr, Tyr) and N-terminal protein acetylation as variable modifications: The false discovery rate was 0.01 on both peptide and protein level and the minimum peptide length was set to seven amino acids. Quantification was done using the label free quantitation algorithm from MaxQuant 21, 22 . Tables were created as follows: data was cleared of reversed hits, contaminants and "only identified by site". Ratios were calculated from the LFQ values from TARG1-TAP vs. empty vector TAP. A student's t-test was performed with a minimum p-value of 0.01. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). 1 × 10 6 HEK293 or HEK293T cells were seeded onto 10 cm dishes and transfected the next day with plasmid DNA as indicated (20 µg DNA in total) by calcium phosphate precipitation for 4-6 h. Cells were washed with HEPES buffer (142 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 6.7 mM KCl, pH 7.3) before cells were incubated in fresh medium for additional 48 h. All following harvesting and IP steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. The cells were washed once with PBS, were harvested in 500 µl TAP lysis buffer (described above) and lysed for 30 min under permanent agitation. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16.000 × g for 20 min. 30 µl TAP lysate were kept for input analyses and mixed with SDS sample buffer. Per IP sample 20 µl of anti-FLAG M2 beads (suspension volume) were equilibrated in TAP lysis buffer before incubation with the remaining TAP lysate (~500 µl) for 30 min under constant rotation. Centrifugation of the beads was performed at 500 × g for 2 min. The beads were washed three times with 500 µl TAP lysis buffer. The buffer was removed from the beads completely and the beads were resuspended in 40 µl SDS sample buffer. Co-IP and input samples were incubated for 5 min at 95 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Purification of recombinant proteins. E. coli BL21 (DE3) were transformed with pGEX-4T1 or pDEST17 plasmids encoding for GST-ALY, His-TARG1 proteins or His-CHIKV-nsP3-macro. Bacteria were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium containing 0.4% glucose and protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG (1 mM) when an OD 600 of 0.5-0.7 was reached. Purification of His-tagged proteins was performed by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), all harvesting and purification steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Bacteria were pelleted and lysed in IMAC lysis buffer (100 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail, 100 µg/ml lysozyme, pH 8.0) for 30 min. After sonication and centrifugation, the lysate was incubated with equilibrated TALON metal affinity resin for 1 h. The beads were washed two times with PBS and once with IMAC wash buffer (20 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP, pH 7.5) and eluted with IMAC elution buffer (20 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 500 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP, pH 7.5). Glutathione affinity purification was performed as described previously 76 . Thermal shift assay. The thermal shift assay was carried out in a final volume of 25 µl with 1 µg of recombinant His-TARG1 proteins. First, a mastermix containing the assay buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl), SYPRO orange (1:1,000 final dilution) and recombinant His-tagged protein (1 µg per reaction) was prepared. 22.5 µl of the mixture were pipetted into one reaction tube and filled up with 2.5 µl of ligand solution or diluent as control. Each sample was measured in duplicates in a Rotorgene real-time PCR instrument (Corbett) using the 470 nm channel as the source for excitation and the 610 nm channel for detection with a gain of 7. A temperature scan (melt curve) from 25 °C to 95 °C was performed with temperature increasing by 1 °C/min. Data were analyzed according to 25 using Boltzmann fitting. Cell proliferation. For growth curve analysis, cells were seeded at 5 × 10 4 cells on 6 cm cell culture dishes in non-selective cell culture medium ±100 ng/ml doxycycline. HeLa OARD1 −/− HA-TARG1 and HA-TARG1-G43E cells were pre-induced with doxycycline (100 ng/ml) to induce transgene expression before seeding. Fresh doxycycline was added every 48-72 h throughout the analysis. Cells were trypsinized every 24 h and cell number was determined using the CASY ® cell counter system (OMNI Life Science). Live cell imaging. 5 × 10 4 U2OS cells were seeded onto high glass bottom 35 mm µ-dishes (ibidi) and transfected with plasmids encoding for EGFP or EGFP-TARG1 fusion proteins and mCherry-tagged Histone H2B the next day. Treatment with DMSO or 10 µM olaparib was performed for 2 h before imaging. 48 h after transfection, the dishes were directly mounted onto a Zeiss LSM710 confocal laser scanning microscope and kept at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . Images shown in Fig. 3a were acquired with a LD C-Apochromat 40x/1.1 W Korr M27 objective with a frame size of 512 × 512 px and a 1.5x digital zoom. EGFP fluorescence was excited with the 488 nm line of an Argon laser (25 mW, 2% output) and detected from 493 nm to 586 nm with a main beam splitter filter MBS 488. mCherry fluorescence was excited with a 561 nm DPSS laser (20 mW, 2% output) and detected from 578 nm to 696 nm with a MBS 458/561 filter. Imaging was performed on a 2.2 µm section, corresponding to 2.17 airy units (AU) in the EGFP track and 1.83 AU in the mCherry track. Images shown in Figs 3b,c and 5 were acquired with a C-Apochromat 63x/1.20 W Korr objective with a frame size of 1024 × 1024 px. Settings for excitation and detection were as described above. For each channel the pinhole diameter was set to 1 AU, corresponding to a 0.9 µm section in the EGFP track and a 1.1 µm section in the mCherry track. The pixel dwell time was 6.3 µs (Fig. 3b ) or 3.15 µs (Figs 3c and 5 ). Time series were performed at 20 cycles with 1 min interval using Definite Focus for focus stabilization. Intensity values were extracted from unprocessed images using the Zen2012 software (Fig. 3a) or ImageJ 1.47 (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. S7 ) 77 . Normalized intensities as depicted in Fig. 5b and d were measured using the ImageJ Time Series Analyzer V3 plugin. Intensities of circular ROIs covering the nucleolar areas and of three circular ROIs placed randomly throughout the nucleoplasmic area were measured for each time point. To account for changes in focus over time, the mean nucleolar EGFP intensity was normalized to the mean nuclear EGFP intensity at each time point for each cell analyzed. Nucleolar EGFP intensities were normalized to the nucleolar EGFP intensity 1 min after treatment. Only linear adjustments of the histogram range of single channels were performed to increase the image contrast. Adjustments were performed on an entire image and were equally applied to all images belonging to a single experiment. Fluorescence loss in photo-bleaching (FLIP). Cell seeding and treatments were performed as described for live cell imaging. FLIP experiments were performed with a Zeiss LSM710 confocal laser scanning microscope using a C-Apochromat 63x/1.2 W Korr objective. The 488 nm line of an Argon laser (25 mW, 1% output for imaging scans) was used for excitation of EGFP. EGFP fluorescence was detected from 493 nm to 574 nm. mCherry fluorescence was acquired to localize nuclei and nucleoli. mCherry was excited with a 561 nm DPSS laser (20 mW, 1% output for imaging scans) and fluorescence detected from 578 nm to 696 nm. A MBS 488/561 filter was applied for detection of EGFP and mCherry fluorescence. Imaging and bleaching were performed on a 2 µm section, corresponding to 2.39 AU in the EGFP track and 2 AU in the mCherry track. The frame size was set to 512 × 512 px. The pixel dwell time was 1.27 µs during imaging. Initial photo-bleaching of a circular ROI (∅2.8 µm, width and height of 11 px) was performed after 5 imaging scans using the 488 nm laser at 100% intensity with 100 iterations applying a different scan speed (pixel dwell time of 25.21 µs) and the zoom bleach option. Bleaching was repeated after every imaging scan. Nuclear photo-bleaching was performed for 60 s, after which imaging was continued without photo-bleaching for additional 30 s. The average fluorescence intensities in each of the defined ROIs were measured during imaging using the Zen2012 software. The ROI area was kept constant for every sample and cells of similar size were chosen. At least 7 data sets were analyzed per sample. Fluorescence intensities in each ROI were normalized to the mean fluorescence intensity in the same ROI before bleaching.
