Much of what I have presented is where analysis of a seemingly complex problem has revealed a conceptually relatively simple explanation, such as a genetic mutation producing functional change in an enzyme-the single gene disorders that led Garrod to his classic description of inborn errors of metabolism. Satisfyingly, this approach often elucidates normal biological functions and new targets for treatment. But how should we approach the much commoner diseases, the diseases of maladaptation, where our genetic constitution relates uneasily to the changed environment in which most of us exist? Examples are obesity and diabetes, high blood pressure, allergy, and autoimmunity, for which the combined individual small effects of many genes are the basis of susceptibility. I shall use the example of insulin-dependent diabetes, a disease caused by the autoimmune destruction of islet cells. Early hopes that predisposition to this disorder was attributable to a fairly small set of HLA genes were soon dashed. John Todd's Nature paper 73 elucidated the small contribution of one gene, that coding for CTLA4. This publication involved more than 10 000 people in 16 centres, 53 authors, who included geneticists (of mice and men), immunologists, computational biologists, and specialist statistical geneticists supported by a 5-year programme grant costing more than Â£20 million! Problems of this complexity pose an exceptional challenge. Biological complexity is now being addressed in leading universities under titles such as systems biology or integrative biology, with computational biology as its principal methodology. Paul Nurse, in his Harveian Oration Great Ideas in Biology, 74 discussed ways in which the complex molecular interactions of the cell might be transformed into logical informational structures and processes more familiar to those in disciplines such as mathematics and physics. Data are being generated on an unprecedented scale by techniques such as gene arrays and the various "omics"; this in turn is driving the development of new statistical and computational methodologies. There are also vast largely untapped datasets in the patient records, to which, in due course, will be added the output of initiatives in genetic epidemiology. Substantial resources, extensive collaboration, long-term commitment, and in particular, removal of cultural barriers or funding mechanisms that discourage interdisciplinary and interinstitutional activity, are required. Where does this leave the doctor scientist? My response is-centre-stage. The medically qualified research worker has one outstanding advantage: there is no system of university education that teaches human biology as effectively as a medical school does. But we need to do better by present and future generations of medical students. Of concern is the tendency for teaching and research to become distinct activities: research is increasingly undertaken in purpose-built laboratories, entry to which is restricted (not least because of animal terrorists). Medical students, who by-and-large are exceptionally gifted, can reasonably expect to have contact with the best researchers in their medical schools, as I did nearly half a century ago. But the competitive pressure of research and of the Research Assessment Exercise means that many university staff, especially those wholly funded by research grants, believe they cannot afford to spend time teaching. Several UK medical schools are now developing MB/PhD programmes to provide exceptional students an early opportunity to engage in research before the constraints of professional training occur. It is clear from the Cambridge programme, which started in 1990, that a majority of its graduates are committed to academic careers and are better prepared to address the complex issues ahead. I remain optimistic. The UK government is committed to substantial investment in the science base over the next decade. Medical science is one of the country's great academic strengths and we have powerful and research intensive pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and health-care industries. Most importantly, the role of the NHS in medical research is recognised, and the government's endorsement of the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Biotechnology Innovation Growth Team reports through setting up of the Clinical Research Collaboration, 75 is of great international interest. But I must leave the last words to my distinguished predecessor, Clifford Allbutt, Regius Professor of Physic 1892-1925. I quote from his Harveian Oration (1900): "It was in Padua that medicine, long degraded and disguised, was now to prove her lineage as the mother of natural science, and the truth of the saying of Hippocrates, that to know the nature of man one must know the nature of all things." 76
