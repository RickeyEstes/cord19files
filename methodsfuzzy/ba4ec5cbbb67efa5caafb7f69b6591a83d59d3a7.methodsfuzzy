Cells. The origin and growth of 17 CL1, DBT, and L2 cells has been described previously (31) (32) (33) . Cells were routinely propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Flow Laboratories Inc., Rockville, Md.) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Biocell Laboratories, Carson City, Calif.) and 25 #g/ml chlortetracycline hydrochloride grade II (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) and buffered with 15 mM Hepes, 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid, N-tris [hydroxymethyl] 3 methyl-2 aminoethane sulfonic acid, and 4 mM glutamine (Sigma Chemical Co.). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) were isolated from mice as previously described (14) . The cells were separated over Ficoll-Hypaque (density, 1.074 g/ml) at 22°C for 12 rain at 1,400 g and were recovered at the interface. The cells were adjusted to 1 x 106 PBM/ml. Lymphocytes and monocytes were separated by adherence to plastic, as previously described (14) . The recovery of cells was >86% and viability was >98%, as evidenced by trypan blue exclusion. Lymphocytes were defined by failure of adherence, morphology, and failure of uptake of neutral red and were <2% esterase positive. Monocytes were defined by morphology and uptake of neutral red and were >96% esterase positive, as previously described (14) . Mice. C3H/St, A/J, and BALB/c mice (Research Institute of Scripps Clinic breeding colony) were used at 4-6 wk of age. After infection with MHV-3, they were maintained in strict isolation. Virus. MHV-3 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. (ATTCC VR-262), and the lyophilized infected liver homogenate was reconstituted with 1 ml sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. The virus was plaque purified twice on monolayers of DBT cells. The virus was subsequently passaged once in DBT cells to prepare a seed stock. A working stock of virus was grown in 17 CL1 cells infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 -4 plaque-forming units (PFU)/eelI. This stock virus had a titer of 1.2 × 10 v PFU/ml and was used for all subsequent experiments. Virus was assayed on monolayers of L2 cells in a standard plaque assay, as previously described (31) (32) (33) (34) . Lethal dose--50% (LDso) was determined in BALB/c, C3H/St, and A/J mice and was calculated according to the method of Reed and Mueneh (35) , using an endpoint of 10 d. PCA Assay. PCA was determined in a one-stage recalcified clotting assay, as previously described (16) . Samples of frozen-thawed and sonicated cells in RPMI 1640 were assayed for the Capacity to shorten the spontaneous clotting of human plasma. The assay consisted of 50 #1 of test sample, 50 #l of 25 mM CaC12, and 50 #1 of citrated normal-fasting platelet-poor human plasma. Units were assigned from a log-log plot and standardized with dilutions of rabbit brain thromboplastin (Dade Div., American Hospital Supply Corp., Miami, Fla.), which at 36/~g/ml was assigned a value of 100,000 mU. There was no activity present in DMEM, RPMI 1640, PBS, complete media, or the virus preparations. Endotoxin Contamination. DMEM, RPMI 1640, PBS, and virus preparations were assayed for endotoxin contamination by standard limulus assay (E. toxate; Sigma Chemical Co.) and contained <0.1 ng/ml of endotoxin in the lower limits of this test (36, 37) .
