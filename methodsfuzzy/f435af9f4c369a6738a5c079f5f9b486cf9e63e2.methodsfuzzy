Ethics statement. All animal experimental protocols were carried out in strict accordance with the UK Home Office guidelines and under license granted for experiments involving regulated procedures on animals protected under the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The experiments were performed in The Pirbright Institute (TPI) Home Office licensed (X24684464) experimental animal house facilities and were approved by TPI's animal welfare and ethical review committee under the terms of reference HO-ERP-01-1. Trial 1 used SPF RIR chickens obtained from TPI Poultry Production Unit in Compton. Trial 2 used the same chicken breed but obtained from The National Avian Research Facility in Edinburgh. Cells and viruses. Tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) were prepared from 19-day-old SPF RIR chicken embryos (47) (48) (49) . Primary chicken kidney (CK) cells were prepared by The Central Services Unit, TPI, from kidneys extracted from either 2-to 3-week-old SPF RIR chickens or 2-week-old SPF derived Valo chickens (49) . The pathogenic M41 strain (50) used in this study had previously been adapted in CK cells to produce M41-CK (accession number X04722) (26) . The pathogenic strain, QX (QX L1148 strain, accession number KY933090) (51) , was donated by Richard Jones, University of Liverpool. The rIBVs BeauR-M41(S), BeauR-M41(S1), BeauR-M41(S2), and BeauR-QX(S1) used here are described in a schematic illustration (Fig. 1) and constructed using the backbone of Beau-R, which is the molecular clone of Beau-CK (accession number AJ311317) (21, 25) . All isolates of IBV and rIBV were propagated in 10-day-old RIR SPF embryonated eggs. Allantoic fluid was clarified by low-speed centrifugation at 24 to 48 hpi. Titrations to determine virus infectivity were either performed in TOCs as described previously (26) or in CK cells (49) ; titers are expressed as 50% (median) ciliostatic doses (CD 50 )/ml or PFU/ml, respectively. Analysis of growth kinetics in CK cells. Confluent CK cells seeded in either 6-well or 12-well plates were inoculated with 10 4 PFU rIBV or IBV for multistep growth curves or 10 5 PFU rIBV or IBV for single-step growth curves in 0.5 ml of serum-free N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2aminoethanesulphonic acid (BES) medium and incubated for 1 h at 37°C at 5% CO 2 . Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove residual virus, and 2 ml of serum-free BES medium was added per well. Extracellular virus was harvested at defined intervals and assayed by titration in CK cells. Experimental design of in vivo vaccination/challenge trials. SPF RIR chickens were housed in positive-pressure, HEPA-filtered isolation rooms in which each group was housed in a separate room. In two separate experiments, birds were randomly divided into 5 groups of 30 birds for trial 1 and 5 groups of 40 birds for trial 2. Eight-day-old chicks were inoculated (classified as primary inoculation) with 10 5 PFU of BeauR-M41(S1) or BeauR-QX(S1) (trial 1) or 10 4 PFU BeauR-M41(S), BeauR-M41(S1), or BeauR-M41(S2) (trial 2) in a total of 0.1 ml of PBS via conjunctival (eye drop) and intranasal routes. A challenge dose, equal to the primary inoculation, 10 5 PFU (trial 1) and 10 4 PFU (trial 2) of the corresponding wild-type viruses were administered in the same manner 21 days after the primary inoculation to the appropriate groups. Of note, the IBV QX strain used here could not be propagated in CK cells, so a CD 50 dose of 10 2.73 was used. Mock-infected controls were inoculated via the same route with 0.1 ml of PBS, and mock/ challenge control groups were inoculated with 0.1 ml PBS and challenged with the same dose of wild-type virus. Birds were euthanized by cervical dislocation at specific times postinfection, and a panel of tissues was sampled to allow for downstream analysis. Blood samples were collected and processed for the collection of serum. The clinical signs used to determine pathogenicity were snicking, rales, and ciliary activity of the trachea (a bird was considered protected if 50% or more ciliary activity was retained in 9 of 10 tracheal rings; this must be in 80% of the group) (28, 52) . Isolation of tissues: virus isolation and ciliostasis assay. Tissues collected were divided into two parts; one part was stabilized in RNAlater (Ambion) for RNA extraction and the other in 20% sucrose-PBS (0.22-m-pore size filtered) at 4°C overnight before snap freezing in OCT (Thermo Scientific) for histology. Tissues collected included: Harderian gland, CALT, NALT, and trachea. Tissues were removed at 2 and 4 days postvaccination (dpv) and at 2, 4, and 14 days postchallenge (dpc). Tracheas were removed from five randomly selected chickens from each group at 4 dpv and 4 dpc for assessment of ciliary activity as described previously (26) . Part of the trachea and CALT tissues were stored in PBS for virus isolation. Detection of viral RNA. For virus isolation and RNA extraction, tissues stored in PBS and RNAlater, respectively, were freeze-thawed and homogenized using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen), as described previously (23) . Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini-Kit and DNase treated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from 1 g of tRNA using Superscript IV reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) with a random oligonucleotide primer according to the manufacturer's instructions. To quantify infectious viral load in trachea, tissue-derived supernatant was titrated in TOCs. To determine whether infectious virus was present, 10-day-old SPF embryonated eggs were inoculated with 100 l of allantoic fluid; then, at 24 to 48 hpi they were assessed for viral presence by RT-PCR using primers specific for the 3= UTR, as described previously (53) . For quantification of viral load, qPCR was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with primers and probes specific to the 5=-UTR region, as described previously (29) . Serial dilutions of M41 cDNA (generated from 1 g of tRNA) were included to generate a standard curve, and the data, expressed in terms of the cycle threshold (C T ) value, were normalized using the C T value of the 28S cDNA product for the same sample (54) . Infectious bronchitis virus ELISA. Serum samples collected at 21 dpv (prechallenge) and at 2, 4, and 14 dpc were assayed with a commercial IDEXX IBV antibody test kit (IDEXX Laboratories). To determine the endpoint titer, the serum samples were twofold serially diluted in the range 1:20 to 1:2,560 prior to rIBV Partially Protects against IBV Journal of Virology incubation. After sample incubation, the remaining steps were followed directly according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sample/positive (S/P) ratio was calculated using by the following equation: [(mean sample -mean kit negative)/(mean kit positive -mean kit negative)]. S/P ratios greater than 0.2 were considered positive for IBV antibodies. Polyclonal chicken serum raised against M41 and QX serum were included on each independent test plate (GD Animal Health). Immunocytochemistry. For fluorescent microscopy, cryostat sections (5 m) were fixed in acetone, washed in PBS, and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 10% normal goat serum and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS (blocking buffer). Slides were washed and incubated for 1 h with optimally diluted primary antibodies (anti-Bu-1 [clone AV-20; AbD Serotec], anti-CD8␣ [clone 3-298, AbD Serotec], and anti-CD8␤ [clone EP42, AbD Serotec]) and anti-CSF1R (55) or isotype controls, all diluted in blocking buffer. Sections were washed, incubated with an Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG1/ IgG2a or Alexa Fluor 568-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG1/IgG2b according to the appropriate isotype, and diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h. Nuclei were visualized using DAPI (4=,6=-diamidino-2phenylindole (Invitrogen). Images were captured with a Leica DMLB fluorescence microscope with a coupled device digital camera and analyzed using ImageJ analysis software. For light microscopy, cryostat sections (5 m) were fixed in acetone and stained with Harris' hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% eosin (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were dehydrated through graded ethanols and xylene and mounted in a xylene-based medium (DePex; Gurr-BDH Chemicals). Images were captured with a Hamamatsu Nano-zoomer-XR digital slide scanner. Analysis of neutralizing antibody. Virus neutralization tests were performed by GD Animal Health (56) . Briefly, twofold serial dilutions of serum were made in a 1:1 mixture of Medium-199 and Ham F10 in 96-well plates. To each well, an equal volume of CEK cells (in medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum) was added. After culture with M41 for 3 to 4 days at 37°C with 5% CO 2 , cell monolayers were examined for cytopathic effect (CPE). All individual titers were expressed as the log 2 value of the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that showed complete inhibition of CPE. Statistical analyses. Viral load qPCR data were tested for normality through residual plots, and the differences between the mean corrected 40-C T values were statistically evaluated by a parametric one-way analysis of variance test adjusted for post hoc analysis using Tukey's pairwise comparison. Serum antibody levels, viral isolation titers, ciliary activity, and virus neutralization titers were tested for normality, and nonparametric analyses were performed. Differences between the groups were statistically evaluated by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test adjusted for post hoc analysis and Mann-Whitney U pairwise comparison. The relationship between anti-IBV serum and virus neutralization titers were compared by Spearman rank correlation analysis. Analysis of the viral growth curves was conducted by fitting a polynomial curve to the exponential phase of viral growth (57); growth rates were then compared between groups by using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test adjusted for post hoc analysis. For all statistical analyses, P values of Ͻ0.05 were considered significant. All statistical analyses were conducted using MiniTab v17 or GraphPad Prism 7.
