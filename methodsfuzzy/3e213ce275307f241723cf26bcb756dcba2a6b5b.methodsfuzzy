Phylogenetic Tree, Genomes, and tRNA Gene Data All analyses were carried out in R (R Development Core Team 2015) using the phytools (Revell 2012 ) and seqinr (Charif et al. 2005) packages, unless otherwise specified. The R scripts for all analyses are available at https://github.com/gauravdiwan89/ me_evolution_project. We used the bacterial phylogeny generated by Segata et al. (2013) . This phylogeny was generated using an alignment of the 400 most conserved protein sequences across all prokaryotes. We downloaded the phylogeny and removed all archaea, as well as bacteria whose genomes have not been fully sequenced. We pruned the tree further using a distance based pruning function. Briefly, when closely related species had a pairwise phylogenetic distance 0.03, we randomly sampled only one of these species. This allowed us to avoid excessive representation of some highly sequenced genomes, such as several Escherichia coli strains. This led to the final set of 1093 bacterial genomes that we used in our subsequent analyses. We downloaded the tRNA gene copy numbers for each of these genomes from the Genomic tRNA database (Chan and Lowe 2009) . For genomes where this information was not available, we determined the tRNA gene copy numbers by running the program tRNAscan-SE (Lowe and Eddy 1997) using the default parameters for bacterial genomes. The information for each of these genomes was represented using different identifiers in the various databases that we used. This information is consolidated in supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online, consisting of: (1) species name according to NCBI taxonomy, (2) NCBI accession number, (3) Phylogenetic tree tip label in the tree, (4) IMG database identifier, and (5) Genomic tRNA database abbreviation.
