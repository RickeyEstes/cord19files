The TCM view the human body and the causes of illnesses differently from Western medicine. More importantly, it does not include objective, quantitative measurement methods like the ones used by modern medicine. The most important diagnostic methods in TCM are the visual examination of the tongue, and audio examination of the pulse and breathing. Traditional diagnostic methods are widely documented in the work of Marcus and Kuchera (2005.) . These are however subjective methods that rely solely on the practitioners' experience, since no objective data can be measured. It is especially hard to reliably recognise the lung related and respiratory illnesses that are mostly induced by modern day problems like city life and industrialization. These illnesses are however becoming increasingly common in China and in other parts of the world as well. Because the practices of TCM date back several hundreds or even thousands of years, TCM is not prepared to effectively treat these kinds of modern life related illnesses. An instructive example was the 2002 epidemic outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China that has later spread to other parts of the world due to global air travel. After that, many researchers recognised that the integration of TCM with modern medicine (MM) yields promising results in the treatment of SARS. Chen, Gou and al. (2007.) summarized the available works in this field and came to the conclusion that the experience with the integration of TCM with MM in the treatment of SARS was encouraging, and thus more such work is needed. The increasing numbers of asthmatic diseases show that new, objective respiratory diagnostic methods for TCM are needed. Integrating modern spirometry with traditional methods could be the solution. As previously mentioned, TCM mainly uses herbal medicine to cure respiratory illnesses like asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). These herbal ingredients are mixed together and boiled in water to form different potions. The potions (that can be considered as water based solutions) can be applied orally, or inhaled in gas or mist form. Chang et al. used nebulisation to administer the potion in their animal experiments. Nebulisation is a widely used practice for administering medication directly into the lungs, in the form of a mist. It works by breaking up the medical solution to small droplets which when inhaled, can reach the lower airways. Originally, 8th IFAC Symposium on Biological and Medical Systems August 29-31, 2012. Budapest, Hungary nebulisers commonly drive pressurized air or oxygen trough the medical solution to form the droplets. Modern nebulisers (like ThorMed's InhalaThor) utilise ultrasonic power to form a mist, therefore they can be more compact while also creating smaller sized droplets. Droplet size directly relates to the efficiency of the nebulisers, as smaller droplets have better chance to reach the lower and narrower branches of the airways. The ultrasonic nebuliser is a favourable delivery method for inhalation of complex TCM, because it can be integrated into a medical ventilation system. In such cases, the traditional medication can be used to improve rehabilitation of people who are unable to breathe sufficiently. The disadvantage is that controlling the exact dosage of the medication is more complicated than with other methods for example metered dose inhalers (MDI). A nebuliser can also be integrated with the spirometer sensor for the proposed home patient monitoring system that -as explained before -can be used to continuously or remotely monitor patients. This integrated system can therefore be used, not only to monitor the patients, but to slowly and automatically administer their required medication. The main problem with the integration is how the spirometers' sensor will respond to the various medicines mixed in the air. Our proprietary signal processing algorithm used in the WaveFront sensors can be modified to include de necessary compensation for accurate measurement under the different conditions. The sensors mechanical construction allows its application with nebulised medications. The inner surface of the flow tube is continuous and there are no moving parts inside the device. Therefore it does not obstruct airflow, so sediments can not occur. The construction of the sensor also enables easy cleaning between different medications. A significant advantage of this concept is that the dosages can be precisely controlled. Care must be taken for accurate dosage control and possibly new sensors will be needed to achieve this. Mainly, the cost of medical systems is consisting of the following: hardware component costs, assembling costs, software or hardware development costs, and maintenance costs. For devices produced in large numbers, component costs and assembling costs dominate over the development costs, because they are proportional to the production number, where development costs are fixed. Therefore, it is advisable to implement most of the functionality in software, because it only increases the development costs, where additional hardware elements increase both the component and the assembly costs. An additional option for cost reduction is to use mass produced, commercially available components, because their price is much lower. Maintenance costs can be reduced by applying specific active software and hardware solutions for example self calibration or cleaning, but also by passive means, such as a simply cleanable or fully reusable construction. Hardware component cost reduction can be achieved the easiest way, by redesigning the user interfaces. Due to the popularity of touch screen devices, the price of resistive touch screen technology has dropped significantly. A touch panel with a moderately sized display is now much cheaper than many different switches, pushbuttons, or potentiometers. Therefore it is advisable to outfit the proposed home diagnostic and treatment devices with such touch screens. It is not only favourable as a cost reduction method, but it is an important ergonomic improvement as well. Also the devices' software can become more complex, and has the option for later upgrades. On the other hand, complicated touch screen user interfaces can increase the software development cost significantly, so there is a trade-off. Display panels with touch screens are also much easier to clean than mechanical controls. They require absolutely no moving parts, and can be completely sealed, therefore water-and dustproof. The reduction of the numbers of switches and potentiometers also mean the reduction of moving and thus deteriorating parts, and it also reduces costs. Table 1 shows the possibility of cost reduction with touch screens, by showing two user interface alternatives for performing the same function.
