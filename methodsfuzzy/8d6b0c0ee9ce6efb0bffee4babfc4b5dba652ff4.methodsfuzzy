We first describe how the protocol was developed and evaluated, We then describe the final virus purification and enrichment TUViD-VM protocol for metagenomic deep sequencing for nucleic acid from organ tissue ( Figure 1 ). accordance with guidelines of the European Pharmacopoeia (EP7.0.5.2.2) and the US Department of Agriculture Veterinary Services (Memorandum 800.65). All procedures regarding embryonated chicken eggs were based on German Animal Protection Laws. For infection, fertilized chicken eggs at embryonation day 11 were inoculated with virus into the allantois sack or onto the chorioallantoic membrane. Development of embryos was terminated at day 17 of embryonation by cooling the eggs overnight at 4°C. No further specific approval is needed for experiments on embryonated avians before time of hatching. However, additional approval from the internal ethics advisory board of the Robert Koch Institute was obtained and is available on request. All compared methods were analyzed simultaneously. Because evaluation of sample quality was ongoing, to exclude any extraction bias, an additional unprocessed control aliquot was extracted and measured with every batch. All results of 1 extraction were rigorously compared with a related control aliquot to normalize any variations caused by extraction, cDNA, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) performance. Every result was evaluated for increasing the signal-tonoise ratio of virus to host-genome (this ratio is indicated by ). Given that Δ∆x = Δ measured -Δ control, we assume that the ratio change between virus nucleic acids and host genome is given by ΔΔC t = Δ purified -Δ unprocessed, where C t is the cycle threshold. To visualize relative quantification (RQ), RQ (2 -ΔΔC t ) was plotted against the respective methods. The RQ value indicates the x-fold change compared with that of the control aliquot (e.g., RQ value of 10 means a 10-fold higher ∆ between virus and host genomes compared with the control aliquot) (13) . Per definition of the RQ method, the area of significance lays outside RQ values of 0.5 and 2 if the samples show an even Gaussian distribution. Thus, results <0.5 and >2 were considered significant. An additional scoring system was used to evaluate different methods. For every RQ result that increased the ratio between host and virus nucleic acids, we gave 1 point (maximum +4 points if the method led to better detectability for all 4 viruses), and for every decrease, we subtracted 1 point (minimum is subsequently -4 points). Methods with the highest scores were chosen for establishment of a combined protocol that included purification of unknown viruses from any tissue source (Table 1) .
