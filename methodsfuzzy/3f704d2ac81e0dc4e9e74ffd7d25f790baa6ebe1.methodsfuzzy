Expression and purification of GP CL -KZ52 complex for crystallization. Ebola virus GP (lacking the mucin domain [residues 312 to 462]) was produced by stable expression in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. Briefly, Effectene (Qiagen) was used to transfect S2 cells with a modified pMTpuro vector plasmid containing the GP gene of interest, followed by stable selection of transfected cells with 6 g/ml puromycin. Cells were cultured at 27°C in complete Schneider's medium for selection and then adapted to Insect Xpress medium (Lonza) for large-scale expression in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks. Secreted GP ectodomain expression was induced with 0.5 mM CuSO 4 , and supernatant harvested after 4 days. Ebola virus GP was engineered with a double Strep-tag at the C terminus to facilitate purification using Strep-Tactin resin (2-1201-010) (Qiagen) and then further purified by Superdex 200 size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in 10 mM Tris-buffered saline (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl [TBS]). EBOV GP CL was produced by incubation of 1 mg GP with 0.02 mg thermolysin overnight at room temperature in TBS containing 1 mM CaCl 2 and purified by using Superdex 200 SEC. Trimeric EBOV GP CL was then complexed with a KZ52 Fab fragment prior to crystallization as previously described (4) . Crystallization, data collection, and structure determinations. The purified EBOV GP CL -KZ52 Fab complex was concentrated to 3.5 mg/ml in TBS. The crystal drops consisted of a 1:1 ratio of protein/well solution. The well solution consisted of 25% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 550 (PEG MME 550), 10% 2-propanol, 5% ethylene glycol, 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.7, and 100 mM calcium chloride. Crystals grew over the course of a month and were flash frozen directly out of the crystal drop into liquid nitrogen for data collection. Data were collected remotely at the Argonne National Laboratory, Advanced Photon Source (APS), from the GM/CA beamline 23-ID-D. The structure was determined using molecular replacement with PHASER (39), within the CCP4 suite (40), using a modified EBOV GP-KZ52 complex model (PDB code 3CSY) with all the residues corresponding to the glycan cap removed (4) . Refinement of the EBOV GP CL crystal structure was done through iterative cycles of model building using COOT, followed by refinement with Refmac5 and PHENIX (41) (42) (43) . Translation/libration/screw (TLS) motion was applied during refinement with the TLS Motion Determination (TLSMD) server used to determine the TLS structure partitions (44, 45) . Five percent of the data was set aside prior to refinement for the R free calculations for each data set (46) . The statistics and stereochemistry of the crystal structure were checked using the MolProbity server until ranking at least at the Ͼ95th percentile (see Fig. S2A in the supplemental material) (47) . All of the structural figures were rendered using PyMOL (PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, version 1.5.0.4; Schrödinger, LLC). Cells and viruses. African grivet monkey kidney (Vero) cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Replication-incompetent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (serotype Indiana) pseudotyped viruses were generated as previously described (49) . The wild type (VSV-WT GP) encodes enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) in place of the VSV-G gene to allow scoring of infection and bears the EBOV GP⌬muc gene (Mayinga isolate, GenBank accession number AF086833) but lacks the mucin-like domain (residues 309 to 489 [⌬muc]) (6) . Point mutants and multiple mutants were generated by subcloning GP fragments containing the mutation(s) to replace EBOV GP⌬muc. Cleaved VSV-GP CL particles were generated by incubating VSV-GP pseudotypes with thermolysin (250 g/ ml) for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding phosphoramidon (1 mM) and incubating on ice for 5 min. Normalization of GP for ELISA. Normalization of GP CL amounts to be used in the binding experiments was done by ELISA, as illustrated in Fig. S4 in the supplemental material. Briefly, high-binding 96-well ELISA plates (Corning) were coated with serial dilutions of GP CL in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), and allowed to bind at 37°C for 1 h. The plates were blocked with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (PBSA), followed by incubation with the anti-GP monoclonal antibody KZ52 (2 g/ml in PBS) (21) and a horseradish-conjugated anti-human secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which was detected by ultra-TMB (3,3=,5,5=tetramethylbenzidine) substrate (Thermo Scientific). Absorbance readings were subjected to a nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism software) to generate binding curves and calculate an EC 50 value. Additionally, the virions were normalized for GP incorporation by comparing the amount of GP to the amount of the VSV matrix protein (M). Equal amounts of purified virions were resolved on SDS-PAGE and blotted for the VSV matrix protein using a mouse anti-VSV M antibody (23H12). Quantification was done using a LI-COR IR dye-conjugated anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 680 secondary antibody (Invitrogen) on the Odyssey Imaging Station and Image Studio 2.1 software (LI-COR Biosciences), and the results were normalized to the WT control. Virus particles that had less than 25% incorporation of mutant GP compared to the incorporation of WT GP or that were highly sensitive to proteolysis were excluded from our analysis. GP-NPC1 domain C capture ELISA. Binding of GP to NPC1 domain C was performed as previously described (10, 32) . Briefly, highbinding 96-well ELISA plates (Corning) were coated with the anti-GP monoclonal antibody KZ52 (2 g/ml in PBS) (21) . Following a blocking step, either uncleaved or in vitro-cleaved GP CL pseudotypes were captured on the plate. Unbound GP was washed off, and serial dilutions of Flag-tagged purified soluble human NPC1 domain C (0 to 40 g/ml) were added. Bound NPC1 domain C was detected by a horseradish-conjugated anti-Flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), using ultra-TMB substrate (Thermo Scientific). EC 50 s were calculated from binding curves generated by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software. Binding ELISAs were done in duplicate in at least two independent experiments. All incubation steps were done at 37°C for 1 h or at 4°C overnight. Pseudovirus neutralization assays. Serial dilutions of MAbs and of a no-antibody control were mixed with either cleaved or uncleaved VSV-GP particles and allowed to bind for 1 h at room temperature. Monolayers of Vero cells were inoculated with the antibody-virus mixture in duplicate and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . Infection was scored 12 to 16 h postinfection by enumeration of eGFP-positive cells under a fluorescence microscope. The ZMapp cocktail MAbs 2G4, 4G7, and 13C6, as well as MAb KZ52, prepared as previously described (33) , were generously provided by Mapp Biopharmaceutical. MAbs MR78 and MR72 were prepared as previously described (22) . Protein structure accession number. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank under accession number 5HJ3.
