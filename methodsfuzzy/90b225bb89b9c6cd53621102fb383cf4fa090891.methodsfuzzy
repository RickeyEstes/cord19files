Different routes of injection result in various biodistributions of Vivo-Morpholinos to tissues. Both local and systemic delivery methods have been tested in adult mice (Table 2) [27, 28] . Intravenous (iv) Liver, small intestine, colon, skeletal muscles, spleen, lung, heart, skin, stomach, kidney. Brain [27, 28] Subcutaneous (sc) injection is mainly effective for targeting skin and fails to deliver to the muscles and heart (Jiang S et al. manuscript in preparation). Intramuscular (im) injection efficiently delivers Vivo-Morpholinos to the muscles near the injected sites, but not in most other tissues including the heart, brain and diaphragm. Intraperitoneal (ip) injection is the most efficient route to deliver Vivo-Morpholinos to the diaphragm and the abdominal muscles [28] . By intravenous (iv) injection, systemic delivery was achieved in most tissues including liver, small intestine, colon, skeletal muscles, spleen, lung, heart, skin, stomach and kidney but not brain [27, 28] .
