Viruses. In this study, all viruses were derived from the virus repository of the EU/OIE/FAO international reference laboratory for AI at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, New Haw, Addlestone, Weybridge, Woking, Surrey, UK (Tables 1-3) . Representative strains were derived principally from avian hosts to include H subtypes 1-15 but also included some viruses from mammalian hosts. Several other clinically relevant viral pathogens were used for specificity testing (listed in Tables 4-6). Embryo titration. Serial 10-fold dilutions (10 À2 -10 À9 ) of virus were prepared in virus dilution media. For each dilution, 0.1 ml virus-containing medium was inoculated into the allantoic cavity of embryonated fowls' eggs ðn ¼ 4-6Þ. After 72 h of incubation at 37°C, the eggs were chilled and harvested individually and the undiluted allantoic fluids were tested for HA activity [32] . The ELD 50 per ml was calculated using the method of Karber [33] . The egg infectious dose is a measure of viral infectivity where the EID 50 is the smallest amount of virus capable of initiating infection in 50% of the embryonated fowls' eggs [34] . Design of primers and probes. The influenza A subtype H1-H15 amplification primers and capture probe were derived after comparison of the conserved sequences of the matrix protein (M) gene obtained from viruses of avian, human, swine, and equine origin. The conserved sequences were selected by sequence alignment of more than 300 M gene sequences retrieved from the GenBank database (National Center of Biotechnology Information, NCBI). Sequence alignments were performed using CLUSTALX software [35] . To further subtype avian influenza viruses using NASBA, we designed H5-and H7-specific amplification primers and capture probes, each based on the conserved sequences of the haemagglutinin genes of these subtypes. Over 100 haemagglutinin gene sequences were retrieved from GenBank for each subtype of avian, human, swine, and equine origin. The H5-ECL and H7-ECL amplification primers each contain two degenerate nucleotides resulting in a mixture of four possible oligonucleotide sequences ( Table 1 ). The H5-T7 and H7-T7 amplification primers each contain two degenerate nucleotides, including inosine, resulting in a mixture of two possible oligonucleotide sequences. The AIV-T7 amplification primer contains three degenerate nucleotides resulting in a mixture of eight possible sequences. The H5-CP capture probe con-tains two degenerate nucleotides resulting in a mixture of four possible sequences. Two different H7-CP capture probes were designed. H7-CP-1 contains two degenerate nucleotides, producing six possible sequences, while H7-CP-2 contains a single degenerate nucleotide resulting in two possible H7-CP-2 sequences, respectively. The amplification primer and capture probe sequences for each subtype assay are shown in Table 1 . RNA extraction and amplification. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 0.4 ml of allantoic fluid was mixed with 0.4 ml RLT buffer. To this, 0.4 ml of 70% ethanol was added and the entire sample was applied to an RNeasy spin column. The spin column was washed once with 0.7 ml RW1 buffer and twice with 0.5 ml RPE buffer. RNA was eluted in 50 ll nuclease-free water and subjected to amplification reaction using the NASBA method.

Detection reagents were prepared by vortex mixing a suspension comprising biotinylated influenza A virus oligonucleotide capture probes bound to streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads until an opaque solution was formed, as described in the manufacturer's protocol (bioM e erieux). The bead-oligo suspension (10 ll) and 10 ll ruthenium-labeled electrochemiluminescent (ECL) probe were mixed and this mixture (20 ll) was added to 5 ll of the NASBA product and incubated for 30 min at 41°C. Finally, ECL signal detection was performed in the NucliSens ECL Reader (bioM e erieux) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
