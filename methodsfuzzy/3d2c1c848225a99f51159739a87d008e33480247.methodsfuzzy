This study was conducted in a quiet laboratory room that was 7.1 Ï« 8.5 m in size with a height of 2.7 m. The room ventilation was temporarily suspended during the experiment to avoid potentially confounding environmental factors, such as ventilation air currents. The experimental design and method of data analysis have been described in detail in our previous study 8 on exhaled air dispersion related to NPPV.
