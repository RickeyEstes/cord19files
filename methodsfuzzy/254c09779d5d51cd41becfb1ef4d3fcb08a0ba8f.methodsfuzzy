Cloning and expression of Fc-and His-tagged proteins For the rat and human D(1-4)-Fc constructs, rat and human CEACAM1 ectodomains (GenBank accession no. J04963 and X16354) and human IgG Fc (GenBank accession no. BC014258) were amplified (rat CEACAM1, 5-AAGCTTTAGCAGGCAGCAGAGACTATGG-3 and 5-GAATTCA-GAATTTCCTTGTGTTGGATCAGG-3; human CEACAM1, 5-AAGCTTAC-CATGGGGCACCTCTCAGCC-3 and 5-GAATTCAGGTGAGAGGC-CATTTTCTTG-3; and human Fc, 5-GAATTCATGGCACCTGAACTCCT-GGGGGGACC-3 and 5-CTCGAGTCATTTACCCGGAGACAGGGAGA-GGC-3) and ligated sequentially into the HindIII-EcoRI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). For the rat D(1-4)-His construct, the BsrGI-AgeI cassette of pcDest 40 V5-His (Invitrogen) was replaced with a duplex encoding the TEV protease cleavage site (annealed 5-GTACAAAGCTTAAG-GATCCCGGGCAGCTGGAGAATCTTTATTTTCAGGGCA-3 and 5-CCGGT-GCCCTGAAAATAAAGATTCTCCAGCTGCCCGGGATCCTTAAGCTTT-3). In the resulting vector, the amplified rat CEACAM1 ectodomain (5-AGCTG-GCTAGTTAAGCTATCAACAAGTTTGTAGCCACCATGGAGCTAGCCTCG-GCT-3 and 5-TGATGATGACCGGTGCCCTGAAAATAAAGATTCTCGC-CAGAATTTCCTTGTGTTGG-3) was inserted by homologous recombination. To obtain rat D(2-4)-His, the rat D(1-4)-His vector was amplified (Phusion polymerase; Finnzymes; 5-GGTGACTTGGGCAGTGGT-3 and 5-GCAT-TACAAAAGCCCAACGTC-3, omitting the D1 domain) and self-ligated. Correct sequences and reading frames were verified by sequencing. Recombinant plasmids were transfected into HEK 293 cells, and the respective proteins were allowed to accumulate in serum-free Pro293s-CDM medium (BioWhittaker). Fc fusion proteins were purified by protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography (HiTrap Protein A HP; GE Healthcare), and Histagged proteins were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (HisTrap dimer forms for a given A Total , the curve-fit model is composed of the following six coupled differential equations, applied for numerical integration (surface-bound type 1 and type 2 dimers are indicated with R AL and R LA , respectively): (2.8) 3. Formation of two classes of dimers (types 1 and 2) and one class of trimers by two different homophilic binding sites. This model is a modification of the model described in section 2. If both binding sites participate, larger complexes can be formed. If we set the limit for a larger complex assembly at the trimer level, Eq. 2.1 expands to (3.1) In this case, addition of the trimer term does not require additional fit parameters. At equilibrium, it holds that Recalling Eq. 3.1, the total amount of analyte is composed of monomer, dimer, and trimer forms (i.e., A Total in grams/liter). It is beneficial to express these forms with simple functions of the monomer [A] combined with rate constants to provide the minimal amount of variables. We define M W as the molecular mass of the monomer and place it with the proper multiplication terms, i.e., times three for a trimer and times two for the dimers, together with Eqs. , assume a low ligand density and do not account for interactions or bridge formations between ligand units. The models were programmed in IGOR Pro (version 6.03A2) and were applied together with the IGOR Pro Global Fit Procedure based on a nonlinear least-square method using the Levenberg-Marquard algorithm (Press et al., 1999) . For numerical integration, we applied the IGOR Pro algorithm based on a fifth order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method (Press et al., 1999) . 1. Formation of one class of dimers by one homophilic binding site. This model describes the simplest system of homophilic binding interactions, where A and A 2 define the monomer and dimer forms of the analyte, respectively. At all conditions, it holds for the analyte in the units of grams/liter that (1. (1.2) In addition to Eq. 1.2 and the relation [A 2 ] = [A] 2 /K D , which provide the bulk concentrations of the monomer and dimer forms for a given A Total , the curve-fit model is composed of the following coupled differential equations, applied for numerical integration: (1.5) 2. Formation of two classes of dimers (types 1 and 2) by two different homophilic binding sites. By the introduction of a second binding site in the monomer, two more variables, k a2 and k d2 , need to be accounted for. At all conditions, it holds for the analyte (given in grams/liter) that Of the three solutions to the cubic equation, two involve complex numbers, and therefore, with regard to our model, have no physical relevance. The third one is a real number solution, which is relevant for addressing the monomer concentration in the sample (i.e., analyte), yielding However, this solution is rather fragile if applied on a real number format to curve-fit algorithms because of somewhat complicated variable compositions within the root terms. For this reason, subfunctions for these terms are better defined as complex number functions when applied together with such algorithms. One additional complication arises in the curve-fit routine for the trimer model based on the fact that, in contrast to a single form of a trimer in solution, the surface-bound trimers cannot be treated as equal. Because one of the three components belonging to the trimer will be the immobilized ligand, an asymmetry is introduced. Because of different responses for the association or dissociation of monomers versus dimers to a surface-bound ligand, together with different interaction rates for the two types of binding sites involved, the model has to account for two types of dimers and three types of trimers contributing to the SPR-based signal. These ligand complexes are distinguished as R AL , R LA , R AAL , R LAA , and R ALA (Fig. S1 ). As for the other two models, this model has to be provided with information on A Total (in grams/ liter), M W , R max , and initial values for the rate constants. Finally, together with Eq. 3.5 for the estimation of [A B ], Eqs. 3.2 and 3.3 for the estimation of the dimer [ A B 2 ] forms and Eq. 3.4 for the estimation of the 3 ] form, the curve-fit model is composed of the following 10 coupled differential equations, applied for numerical integration: were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and Western blotting was performed with rat CEACAM1-specific Mab Be9.2 (Becker et al., 1986) or Pab CC16 (Singer et al., 2000) to detect D(1-4)-His and D(2-4)-His, respectively. Protein detection on Western blots using nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll) was performed using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Chemiluminescence was detected using a digital system (LAS-1000; Fujifilm). Quantification was performed using Image Gauge software (Fujifilm).
