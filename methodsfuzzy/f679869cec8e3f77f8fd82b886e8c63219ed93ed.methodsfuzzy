Ten HCWs (7 women, 3 men), none of whom had previously used an EAPR, were recruited. Demographic variable means included the following: age, 25.1 years; body weight, 76.0 kg; height, 169.1 cm; and body mass index, 26.4. Nine subjects had never smoked, and 1 subject had not smoked in .1 year (20 pack year smoking history). The study was approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Human Subject Review Board, and all subjects provided oral and written informed consent. Physiological parameters (heart rate, breathing rate, tidal volume) were monitored with the LifeShirt Ò System (VivoMetrics, Ventura, CA), a lightweight spandex vest incorporating physiological sensors and circumferential respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) bands. Minute ventilation was calculated as the product of breathing rate 3 tidal volume. The LifeShirt Ò was calibrated against a fixed volume immediately prior to each trial. Oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations (percentage) in the EAPR dead space were sampled at 18 samples/second (total sampling volume of 500 mL/ min) via a 2-mm internal diameter sampling line attached to a port in the EAPR face piece (positioned equidistant between nares and mouth) that directed samples to gas analyzers (AEI Technologies, Naperville, IL). The gas analyzers were calibrated before each trial with gas mixtures weighed into the cylinder using a balance that has been calibrated with weights that are certified to the National Institute of Standards and Technology standards. 7 Continuous oxygen saturation and transcutaneous carbon dioxide values were obtained with the Tosca 500 Monitor (Radiometer, Copenhagen, DK), a heated (428C) combination pulse oximeter and Severinghaus-type PCO 2 sensor that is earlobe mounted. The unit was calibrated over a 10-minute period immediately prior to use. A single model EAPR (North 5500; North Safety, Providence, RI) that incorporates 2 P-100 filters was selected for the study because it had previously been shown to be well tolerated by HCWs 8 (Fig 1) . To ensure proper fit, quantitative respirator fit testing was carried out with the PortaCount Ò Plus (TSI, Shoreview, MN). All subjects attained fit factors $100 (ie, ratio of ambient particles to within-face piece particles), indicating #1% leakage, the level required by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration for half mask respirators. 9 Subjects donned the LifeShirt Ò and were tested in athletic shorts, tee shirts, and athletic shoes (no headgear of any type [eg, caps, head nets, or others] was worn). The EAPR was donned according to the manufacturer's instructions, negative and positive user seal checks 10 were carried out with the sample line pinched off, and the Tosca 500 sensor was attached to the left earlobe. Subjects were exercised for 1 hour (cumulative length of respiratory protective equipment use per shift by nursing staff 11 ) in a randomized fashion at each of 2 treadmill rates representative of HCW activities 12 that have been used in other studies 13, 14 : (1) 1.7 mph (2.74 km/h) treadmill speed (0% grade) that equates to stationary work (eg, writing nursing notes, using a telephone, and others) and (2) 2.5 mph (4.03 km/h) treadmill speed (0% grade) that equates to some bedside nursing patient care activities. Data were compared to 15-minute control values (no EAPR use) for the same subjects, at the same randomized work rates, and obtained no more than 3 weeks prior (15-minute values were considered valid for control purposes because, at relatively low intensity steady state exercise, steady state respiratory parameters are achieved in 3-6 minutes in healthy subjects 15, 16 ). Numerical rating scales (ie, modified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion [numerical range, 0-5; least to most exertion 17 ]; modified Perceived Comfort Scale [numerical range, 1-5; most comfortable to least comfortable 18 ]) were utilized for subjective evaluations of exertion and comfort. Speaking was allowed ad lib by subjects throughout the trials to mimic HCW communicating with staff, patients, and visitors. At the end of each trial, subjects filled out questionnaires related to any subjective sensations experienced (eg, facial heat, sweating, and others) or design features (pinching, odor, and others) causing discomfort. EAPRs were weighed pretrial and post-trial to determine moisture retention. A new EAPR was utilized for each of the 2 sessions, and there was a minimum 30-minute respite between sessions. The study laboratory average temperature was 21.768C (range, 20.18C -22.48C) and the relative humidity averaged 58.3% (range, 47.4%-71.5%).
