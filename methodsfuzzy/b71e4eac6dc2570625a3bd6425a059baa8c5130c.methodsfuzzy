Our model's biological parameters derive mostly from observations of early SARS patients in Hong Kong (Lee et al., 2003; Tsang et al., 2003) . We estimated time-varying control parameters by minimizing sums of squared differences between cumulative model hospitalizations, wE þ f P I P þ f R I R -where wE are those hospitalized from quarantine and fI from successive symptomatic stages, denoted by subscripts-and probable cases admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). We estimated these parameters twice, once from the first 30 days of hospital admissions (Table 1) , before quarantine began, and once from admissions during the entire outbreak (Table 2) . As we were uncertain of many parameter values, we chose either gamma or triangular distributions for Latin hypercube sampling (Table 3) . From the literature just mentioned, we obtained mean values for 1/a, 1/d P , and 1/d R of 6, 4, and 8 days, respectively. Because the gamma's mean is the product of its parameters, here called A and B, we know that B ¼ mean/A. Note that A ¼ 1 corresponds to the exponential distribution, and that the gamma's variance decreases with increasing A. We chose A ¼ 3 for all three distributions, and thus, B ¼ 6 3 ¼ 2, 4 3 , and 8 3 , respectively. (A ¼ 3 also corresponds to three sub-stages in these respective states.) As for their upper and lower values, we chose ones for which the area under the probability density function (pdf) in between was 95-98%. Similarly, for the gamma distributions of b E , b P , and b R , we used our best estimates as means (Table 2) . We chose A values of 2, 2, and 3 (i.e., assumed the variance of b E and b P exceed that of b R ), so the B values are 0:024 2 , 0:152 2 , and 0:582 3 . Each range was again chosen so that the area under the pdf in between was 95-98%. Results are similar if the A values are neither too large nor close to 1. Next we stratified the area under the corresponding density function (pdf) into M equally probable intervals (i.e., each having area 1/M, where M is at least 3 4 the number of uncertain variables, K). Letting x 0 , x 1 , y, x N be sub-interval end points, the parameter's pdf to be f(x), and its cumulative distribution function (cdf) to be F(x): Because x 0 is the lower limit of f(x), the remaining x i 's can be obtained from . . . ; M: Finally, we selected points at random from each interval. The M samples drawn for one input parameter were paired randomly with the M for another, those M pairs were paired randomly again with the M for a third, and so on. Random paring continued until samples of all K input parameters had been paired to form an M by K table. We estimated the infectious stage-specific contributions to the realized reproduction number, < i , using these M sets of input parameters. We compared final outbreak sizes with our best estimates of time-varying control parameters (i.e., quarantine and hospitalization rates and isolation efficiencies) in Singapore with hypothetical alternatives. Differences with and without interventions, or with advanced or delayed timing, are estimates of cases (and hence deaths) averted, conditional on others. Such assessments tacitly assume independence (e.g., quarantine of possible contacts did not affect the timeliness with which actual ones who developed compatible symptoms sought medical care). Social distancing may have increased with quarantine in Hong Kong (Lo et al., 2005) , but synergistic population responses in Singapore were more likely due to very effective health communications.
