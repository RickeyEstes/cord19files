Test surfaces were 1-cm 2 stainless steel carriers with a No. 4 polish. The quantitative carrier test method used was adapted from Sattar et al. 19 Each germicide experiment used 3 control carriers (no germicide applied) and 3 test carriers (germicide applied). Each experiment was performed in duplicate. Each carrier was placed in a 24-well plate, and 20 mL of virus suspension was applied. The virus was allowed to dry for 2 hours. After drying, 50 mL of use-dilution germicide was placed on the dried virus suspension on 3 test carriers, and 50 mL of cell culture medium was placed on 3 control carriers. After 1-minute contact time, 950 mL of neutralizing solution was added to the 3 test carriers to halt virucidal activity, and 950 mL of cell culture medium was added to the control carriers. To elute viruses from carriers, 150 mL of 15% beef extract (pH 7.5) was then added to all 6 carriers. Carriers were agitated on a shaking platform (60 rpm) for 20 minutes. The liquid from each well was then recovered, diluted, and assayed for virus infectivity as previously described. To determine the reduction in virus infectivity, the concentration of virus per 20-mL sample volume was calculated. Reduction in viral titer was calculated using difference in virus concentration between test carriers and control carriers. Log 10 reductions were calculated for each germicide based on 6 independent exposure trials.
