There are much documented materials worldwide concerning the characteristics of human respiratory droplets using theoretical and experimental approaches. It can be found that some researchers use different experimental methods which lead to different results [18] [19] [20] . Moreover, there have been some literatures on droplet transmission in an enclosure space using simulation method. However, these studies only used droplets from nonhuman emission source, or used other non-aerosol materials, such as water, CO2, N2O [21, 22] . And the droplet size and quantity were set as constant values and it looked as the same for different individuals [23] [24] [25] [26] .Therefore, it is necessary to reviewed the existing literatures and get characteristics of respiratory droplets, which provide scientific basis for the following study. In this paper, 25 relevant literatures are selected. The studies before 1970s showed that human respiratory activities (breathing, talking, sneezing and coughing) will produce different quantity and size droplets by utilizing impaction and high-speed photography. The impaction method, which use the paper strip and the microscope slide, includes impaction upon solid and liquid surfaces [17, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Duguid used solid impaction to measure the respiratory droplets, the diameter of which was mainly in 4-8μm, the size distribution was approximately the same among sneezing, coughing and talking, and the largest amount of droplets was sneezing [28] . Jennison used high-speed photography to measure the size≥5μm droplets from health people, but was unable to measure those of smaller. And the size of droplets were almost same, the amount of sneezing was larger than coughing [17] .The impaction method may cause particles to also spread, splash or finger and inevitably distort the true particle size if identified by microscopy.The Andersen sampler is belong to solid impaction, normally used to measure size and quantity of droplets carrying pathogen on an agar surface for later cultivation [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . Fennelly studied distribution of the tuberculosis pathogen droplets from TB patients, and found that the size of droplets containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis was mainly 0.65μm to 3.3μm. Moreover, it was found that there were no significant correlation between the droplets size and cough frequency, age and gender, it was the first experimental study focused on the pathogen dropletcharacteristics [30] . Liquid impaction, operating similarly to solid impaction in terms of relying upon inertial mass, impacts into liquid agar surfaces. The studies shows that the influence of the evaporation, the limitation of the acquisition and the function of the droplet rebound relatively reduce the size and quantity of droplets collected by impaction [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . Early studies showed that the size of droplets was approximately same, and the amount of sneezing droplets was the largest, coughing followed. Despite obvious poor precision instruments and incomplete capture of respiratory droplets, these studies have consequentially convinced that droplet transmission is the most dominant transmission mode of infectious aerosols, which promote the following theoretical and experimental study. With the development of technology, the precision of instrument is gradually improved, optical instruments begin to be used, such as optical droplet counter (OPC), particle image velocimetry (PIV), aerodynamic droplet size (APS). Papineni and Rosental [18] studied respiratory droplet characteristics of health people byusing OPC and analytical transmission electron microscope (AEM). Their study showed that the amount of coughing droplets was the largest and the amount of nose breathing droplets was the least. It was found by Chen [97] , who used the APS and scanning electron mobility spectrometer system to study size and transmission of respiratory droplets of health people, that the size of the droplets mainly was in the range of 0.6-2μm and about 90% -95% coughing droplet size was 2-10μm. C.Y.H. Chao measured droplet size using the interferometric Mie imaging (IMI), and tested air velocity using PIV, and found that geometric mean diameter of coughing and speaking droplets was 13.5μm and 16.0μm respectively. And the droplet concentrations ranged of 2.4 to 5.2 cm −3 for coughing and 0.004-0.223 cm −3 for speaking. William G.use ultrasonic spirometer to study coughing droplet characteristics during patients influenza and in recovery period [33] , found droplets concentration during suffering influenza was greater than in recovery period and existed a significant difference, but the droplets size was not [18] [19] [20] . There are much documented experiments using the optical instruments that can effectively measure size and concentration of fine droplets [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . The PIV can observe the shapes of aerosol droplets. Actually, the differences between the test precision, test range and the output parameters of the instruments must affect the study results.The existing researches show that the transmission of respiratory diseases is associated with the droplet characteristics, especially, the droplet size and concentration are important for the control of pathogen spread.
