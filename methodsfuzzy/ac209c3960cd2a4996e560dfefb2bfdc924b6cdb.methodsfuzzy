TET-21N cell line (derived from SH-EP) harbors a repressible control system to regulate the expression of exogenous N-myc at will. 26 N-myc overexpression was induced by doxycycline withdrawal from culture medium for 48 hours. TET-21 control cells (TET-21C) harbor the same repressible system except that exogenous N-myc gene is not present. N-myc expression was assessed by RT-PCR and western blot. Type I interferon (IFN) expression and IFN signaling through Jak/ STAT Cells treated or not with doxycycline were infected with VSVΔM51 at MOI of 0.1 for 6, 12, and 18 hpi or treated with intracellular or extracellular polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO): 10 ng/well in a 24-well plate format and 10 μg/ml, respectively, for 12 hours. Transfections with poly I:C above 10 ng/well had toxic effects for TET-21N (low N-myc). Cell culture supernatants were harvested, pulsed to remove cell debris, and stored at −80 °C until ready to use. Detection and quantitation of secreted IFN-β were carried out using the Verikine Human Interferon beta kit (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transcriptional analysis, RNA was extracted (Qiagen) followed by RT-PCR. Degenerate primers were used to detect the IFN-α subtypes 47 and specific primers to detect IFN-β (forward, 5′-TGGCAATTGAATGGGAGGCT-3′; and reverse GTCTCATTCCAGCCAGTGCT) and N-myc (forward, 5′-TCCACCAGCAGCACAACTATG; and reverse, 5′-GTCTA GCAAGTCCGAGCGTGT 3′). As controls for these assays, cells were treated with either intracellular (transfection) or extracellular poly I:C in reduced serum medium (Life Technologies). Concentrations of intracellular and extracellular poly I:C were optimized for all cells. Except for SK-N-AS, NB cells were treated with 10-20 μg/ml extracellular poly I:C. SK-N-AS were treated with 0.1 μ/ml extracellular poly I:C because of toxicity beyond this concentration. Poly I:C transfections were performed in a six-well plate format. N-myc-amplified cells were transfected with 15 μg poly I:C using lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Non-N-myc-amplified cells were transfected with 0.1 μg poly I:C, as higher amounts had toxic effects on these cells. TET-21 cells were incubated with extracellular (10 μg/ml in reduced serum medium) or intracellular poly I:C (0.1 μg in six-well plate format) for 12 hours. Transfections beyond 0.1 μg poly I:C had toxic effects for TET-21N (low N-myc). To monitor transfection efficiency, cells were transfected with various amounts of pLL 3.7 carrying the GFP gene (Addgene, Cambridge, MA). For analysis of the Jak/STAT signaling and N-myc detection, cells either treated or not with doxycycline were seeded at 5 × 10 5 cells per well in six-well plates and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells either infected or not were washed with ice-cold PBS, collected by scraping and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mmol/l Tris pH 8.0, 136 mmol/l NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% NP40, 0.02% leupeptin, 0.5% aprotinin, and 1.5% sodium orthovanadate) for 20 minutes followed by sonication (three times, 10-second pulse, 10% amplitude) and centrifugation at 4 °C. All protein preparations were quantified (BCA protein assay, Biolynx, Brockville, ON, Canada), run in 10% polyacrilmyde gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with monoclonal antibodies to N-myc (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), STATs 1 and 2, phospho-STAT-1 Y701 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), actin (EMD Millipore), RIG-I (Novous Biologicals, Littleton, CO); and polyclonal antibodies to IRF-9, phospho-STAT-1 (S727) and phospho-STAT-2 (Y690) (Abcam). Goat anti-mouse and -rabbit IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) were used as secondary antibodies.
