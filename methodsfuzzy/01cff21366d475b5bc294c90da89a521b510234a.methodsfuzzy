This study was carried out under the national protocol for the routine surveillance of human influenza in Uganda. Patients of all ages presenting with ILI at the sentinel surveillance sites for influenza at Kiswa Health Centre in the Ugandan capital Kampala and Entebbe Hospital in Entebbe town were enrolled into this cross-sectional study between August and December 2008. These two study sites are separated from each other by approximately 35 km. Using a World Health Organization (WHO)-modified criterion as used by others, 17, 18, 19 an ILI case was defined as any individual presenting with fever (≥ 38 °C) and any two of the following clinical signs: cough, sore throat, myalgia and headache. A maximum of five eligible cases was enrolled on each day at each of the study sites. Patient demographic characteristics and clinical history were recorded on a standardised clinical form. The presentation of other related symptoms, such as shortness of breath, conjunctivitis, diarrhoea and vomiting, was also recorded. This information was obtained from the caregiver if the patient was unable to speak or was a child.
