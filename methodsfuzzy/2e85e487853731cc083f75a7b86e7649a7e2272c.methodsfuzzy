Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following:  Generation of modified mRNA and LNP The mRNA was synthesized in vitro using DNA-dependent T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription where UTP was substituted with N1-methylpseudoUTP. A linearized DNA template was used, which incorporates 5 0 and 3 0 untranslated regions (UTRs) and includes a poly-A tail (5 0 -UTR: GGGAAAUAAGAGAGAAAAGAAGAGUAAGAAGAAAUAUAAGAGCCACC; and 3 0 -UTR: GCUGGAGC CUCGGUGGCCUAGCUUCUUGCCCCUUGGGCCUCCCCCCAGCCCCUCCUCCCCUUCCUGCACCCGUACCCCCGUGGUCUUU GAAUAAAGUCUGAGUGGGCGGC). The final mRNA utilized a cap 1 structure modification to increase mRNA translation efficiency. Encoded signal sequences were from POWV prM (SGVDWTWTFLVMALMT) or JEV prM (MWLVSLAIVTACAGA) and the prM and E genes were derived from POWV Spooner. LNP formulations were prepared by ethanol drop nanoprecipitation on a microfluidic mixer (Precision Nanosystems). Briefly, lipids were dissolved in ethanol at molar ratios of 50:10:38.5:1.5 (ionizable lipid: structural lipid: sterol: PEG-lipid) and mixed with mRNA in 50 mM citrate buffer, pH 4.0, at a ratio of 3:1 (aqueous:ethanol). Formulations were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing sucrose (8%) in dialysis cassettes for at least 18 h. Formulations were concentrated using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters (EMD Millipore) and sterile filtered through 0.22-mm filters. All formulations were tested for particle size, RNA encapsulation, and endotoxin and were between 80 to 100 nm in size, with greater than 90% encapsulation and < 10 EU/ml of endotoxin.
