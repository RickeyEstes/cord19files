Although it has numerous afferent sensitive in the aerial ways, rats and mice do not present the typical motor act of the cough, making it difficult its evaluation. Thus, the guinea pig is the specie of small postage more used in experiments (13, 16) . In the experimental works the cough can be provoked by the direct electric micro stimulation of the nucleus of the solitary treat after decerebration (26), or by stimulation electric/mechanics of the mucous of the aerial ways in conscientious animals or under general anesthesia. As much in the experimental works how much in the physicians some chemical stimulations can be used or cough agent: capsaicin, acid (citric, ascetic, tartaric) and ultrasonic nebulized of distilled water ("fog"). The capsaicin is the causes of cough more used, managed in dose only or project dose-reply. It provokes cough immediately, reason for which recommends evaluate the effect in the 15 seconds after the nebulizer. Generally the parameter analyzed in the studies dose-reply is the concentration of capsaicin capable to provoke five or more motor acts of cough. The method is considered reproducible and safe in human beings, but some individuals complain of transitory pharynx irritation after exposition to the capsaicin. The acid citric has greater probability to cause sensation of breathlessness and ardor in pharynx. The ultrasonic nebulizer of distilled water is insufficient to activate the consequence of cough in up to 20% of the people, but it can induce bronchospasm symptomatic in others, what it reduces the reproducibility and security of the method. Studies of the effectiveness of anti-cough can suffer the bias from the demulcent effect (stimulation to the saliva secretion and mucus in the VAS for the sugars) of placebo formulated in boiled (22) or of the voluntary inhibition of the cough. In the clinical research, the use of questionnaires (Burden of Cough Questionnaire, Cough Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, Leicester Cough Questionnaire) is useful to evaluate the impact of the cough in the quality of life of patient (27) .
