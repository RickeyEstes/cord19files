This method is also known as microprojectile bombardment method, where selected DNA sequences are precipitated onto microparticals (coated with gold and tungsten) and particles are fired at plant cells with high velocity. The microparticals are released into the cell wall to release the foreign DNA into the cell where it gets integrated to nuclear genome of the plant. The molecular mechanism behind this integration is still not clear (Mishra et al., 2008) . Transgenic plants thus produced are allowed to grow into new plants with the aim to produce the desired pharmaceutical or antigen protein.
