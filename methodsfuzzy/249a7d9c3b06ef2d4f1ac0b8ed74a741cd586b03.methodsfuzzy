C'ontinuous cell lines. L-2 (Rothfels et aZ., 1959) and LMTK- (Merchant et cd, 1962) murine fibroblasts derived from the L929 line (Sanford et cd, 1948) , were routinely propogated as monolayers in Eagle's minimum essential medium (G&co, Grand Island, N. Y.) , supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, (FBS) (Whittaker Bioproducts, Walkersville, Md.), penicillin (100 U/ ml), and streptomycin (100 pg/ml), termed nutrient medium (NM), at 37" in an humidified atmosphere containing 5% COz. Viruses and preparation of stocks. Mouse , hepatitis virus strains MHV3 and JHMV were grown on monolayers of L-2 cells. Once the infection had progressed to the stage when 50% of the syncytia had lifted off, the remainder of the cells were scraped off with a rubber policeman. The suspension was taken up into a syringe and forced through a No. 30 gauge needle, to cause disruption. The lysates produced were centrifuged at 40 g for 5 min at 4' and the supernatant filtered through a millipore Millex-GS, 0.22-pm filter unit to remove larger debris. The filtrate, dispensed in 0.5-ml aliquots, was stored at -70" or used when fresh. The Indiana strain of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was grown on monolayers of L-2 cells for approximately 24 hr and the virus containing supernatant fluid was used as with CV. The Ha116 strain of measles virus (MV) was grown on Vero cell monolayers at 32.5". After 48 hr or when syncytia of moderate size had formed, the virus in the culture supernatant was prepared as above. Primv bruin cultures. Primary brain explants were prepared as described by McCarthy et al. (1978) with minor but fundamental modifications. Briefly, l-or 2-day-old Wistar-Furth rat pups were decapitated, the cerebral hemispheres removed, and freed from the contaminating meninges. The tissue was placed at 0' in three washes of Basal minimal essential medium (BMElo), Gibco, Grand Island, N. Y.) immediately after excision. The medium was supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FBS, sodium bicarbonate (1 g/liter), 0.6% dextrose, and garamycin (10 pg/ml), (Shering Pharmaceuticals, Kenilworth, N. J.). The tissue was subsequently triturated through a lo-ml serological pipet until the cells were thoroughly dispersed and the resulting suspension was then filtered through a Nitex 130 mesh (Tetko Inc., Elmsford, N. Y.) . The cells that passed across were collected into pellets by centrifugation at 750 rpm for 5 min at 4" in a Daimon CRU/5000 centrifuge. The cell pellets obtained from 10 to 12 hemispheres were resuspended in 2 ml of BMElo and layered onto a Ficoll-Paque gradient, then centrifuged at 1250 rpm for 25 min at 4' to remove any contaminating erythrocytes. The cell material formed at the interface was collected, diluted in 5 vol of BMEio, and pelleted at 500 rpm at 4" to remove any residual Ficoll. Batches of cells in these pellets were resuspended in BMElo and plated in a 175-cm2 tissue culture flask (Nunc, 156502) at a density of 10 hemispheres/flask, then maintained in a humidified COa/air incubator at 37", prior to infection. Oligodendrocyte-enriched cultures were derived from the above mixed cultures, using the techniques of McCarthy et al. (1980) as modified by McMorris (1983) . Briefly, the medium of '7-to 8-day-old mixed cultures was renewed at least 2 hr prior to manipulation. The sealed flasks were then placed on a rotary shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, at 35" and agitated for 90 min at 350 rpm. Cells that had been freed into suspension were filtered through a Nitex 130 mesh. The process of vigorous shaking with another volume of medium was carried out manually so as to remove any residual adherent oligodendrocytes and filtration through Nitex 130 repeated. The pooled filtrates were then passed through a Nitex 33 mesh and the cells that came through pelleted at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4'. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of Hank's balanced salt solution, pH 7.2, containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 10 pg/ ml DNAse (Sigma, St. Louis, MO.) and 25 mM HEPES (Sigma) buffer as described by Snyder et al (1980) . The suspension was agitated for 30 min on the rotary shaker at 60 rpm to disperse cell clumps, then centrifuged at 500 rpm at 4' for 5 min. The pellets formed were again resuspended in 5 ml of BMElo, plated at a density of 2 to 3 X lo7 per 25-cm2 flask (Nunc, 1633'71) , and incubated overnight at 37". Further purification of oligodendrocytes was achieved by changing the BMElo after 24 hr, hand agitating the flasks vigorously, and filtering suspended cells through a Nitex 15 mesh to remove any extraneous clumps. The cells were enumerated in a counting chamber and plated at the desired, predetermined, density in Costar 3524, 24-well trays. The three cell concentrations usually employed in these studies were (a) low density: 1 to 2 X lo5 cells/well; (b) medium density: 4 to 6 X lo5 cells/well; and (c) high density: 1 X lo6 cells/well or greater. Cells for examination by immunofluorescence were grown on 12-mm coverslips (Chance, Propper Ltd, Smethwick, Worley, England, No. 1) in 24-well trays. Methods for inoculation and assaving infectivity The primary cell cultures, in 24-well plates or Nunc NI-409 tissue culture tubes, were inoculated with virus stocks suspended in 0.2 ml per well or 0.5 ml per tube, respectively, of BMElo. Adsorption was allowed to proceed for 60 min at the desired temperature. The multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) was varied, depending on the experiment, as indicated in the figures and tables presented in Results. Three to four hours after adsorption, surface and extracellular inoculum was neutralized for 30 min, using highly active antiviral antisera at a dilution of 1:124. CV concentrations were determined as plaque-forming units (PFU) on L-2 cell monolayers, as described by Lucas et al. (1978) , except that plaques were allowed to develop at 37" for 18 to 24 hr. VSV production was monitored in a similar fashion, except the plaques were allowed to develop for 24 hr at 37". Preparation of antisera and immune labeling. CV antisera were raised in Swiss mice. Briefly, neonates were tolerized against once frozen and thawed L-2 cells by intraperitoneal (ip) injections with 1 X 10' cells or more per animal in 0.05 ml PBS at 24 and 48 hr postpartum. Two weeks later the pups were reinjected with the same material to maintain tolerance. Four weeks postpartum the mice were injected ip four times, at weekly intervals, with concentrated virus, inactivated by exposure to uv irradiation, which had an initial titer of approximately 5 X 10s PFU/ dose. One week after the final injection, the blood drawn from batches of animals was pooled, the serum separated, diluted 1:4 in PBS, and stored at -70". Antisera against the glycolipid galactosyl cerebroside (GC) were raised in rabbits according to the procedure of Raine et aI. (1981) , except that reinjections were made with over 1 mg of GC antigen. Specific antibodies in the sera were enriched by passing the sera sequentially through protein A-Sepharose columns, to select for the IgG, and then the recovered IgG was passed through a BSA-Sepharose column to remove any anti-BSA antibodies. The avidity of the antibodies was assessed using the radioimmunoassay (RIA) of Holmgren et al. (1980) for de-tecting the antigen adsorbed onto plastic wells, as modified for use with GC by Raine et aL (1981) . Rabbit antiserum to guinea pig myelin basic protein (Ra > MBP) was kindly provided by Zobeeda Hossein, University of Western Ontario. Rabbit anti-human glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody (Ra > GFAP) (Dahl et ok, 1976 ) was a gift from Dr. Doris Dahl. The procedures for fixation, indirect immunolabeling, and examination of cells under uv for fluorescence were those developed by Manthorpe et aL (1979) , as modified and described in Dales and Oldstone (1982) . Anti-MHV, anti-MBP, and anti-GFAP sera, diluted in PBS, were used at final concentrations of 1:9, 1:19, and 1:39, respectively. The fluorescein (FITC) and rhodamine (RITC) labeled reagents were purchased from Miles Biochemicals (Elkhart, Ind.) and applied at a final concentration of 1:19 for 30 min at room temperature. The cultures were examined and photographed under uv optics, using a Wild-Leitz, Dialux 20 microscope. Immune lysis of irlfected cells. Primary oligodendrocyte or astrocyte cultures and LMTK-cells were infected, monitored for development of cytopathic effect (cpe), then treated with Ra > GC antibody plus complement to cause lysis. The anti-GC antibodies diluted 1:2 in NM were applied at 4O to infected cultures for 60 min. After rinsing away the unadsorbed antibodies with three washes of cold BMElo, the cultures were overlayed with rabbit Lo Tox complement (Cedarlane, Hornby, Ontario, Canada), diluted 1:14 in NM, and placed in an humidified CO, incubator for 30 min. The unfixed complement was removed with three rinses of warm BMElo. The cultures were reconstituted with BMElo and incubated at 3'7" for 24 hr to determine virus yields in terms of plaqueforming units per milliliter in the medium. Treatment with d&&y& cyclic AMP and assay of 2':3'-&ic nucleotide-3'-phosphohydrolase. Treatment with N6,0Z-dibutyryladenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (dbcAMP), (Sigma) was carried out as follows: primary cultures were exposed to 1 mM dbcAMP in BMElo either 48 hr prior to or following infection. The medium, or medium and metabolite, were replaced daily up to the time of infection and on alternate days following inoculation. The experiments employing papaverine (Sigma), were conducted in a parallel manner. The procedures used for determining levels of the enzyme 2':3'-cyclic nucleotide-3'-phosphohydrolase (CNPase), in primary cultures were those developed by Prohaska et al. (1973) as modified and described by McMorris (1933) . Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (1951) , using BSA as a standard.
