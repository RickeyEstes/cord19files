Since different extraction methods can greatly influence the composition and concentration of the effective bioactive molecules in the extracts, we compared the anti-filovirus activities of six different extracts of R. rosea by various extraction methods ( Table 1) . The six extracts were tested in A549 cells at 12.5 µg/mL against pseudotyped EBOV and MARV infection, with each extract showing strong antiviral activity against both viruses (Figure 2a) . Extract 3 from ethanol ultrasonic extraction showed the best antiviral activity with 98% inhibition against HIV/EBOV and 99% inhibition against HIV/MARV, respectively. Extract 3 was further evaluated by titration against pseudotyped filoviruses. It demonstrated a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 value) of 0.25 µg/mL against EBOV pseudovirion, and an IC 50 value of 4.0 µg/mL against the MARV pseudovirion, respectively (Figure 2b) . The cytotoxicity of extract 3 was low, giving a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 value) of 136 µg/mL (Figure 2c ). The selectivity index (SI) of extract 3 was >500 for EBOV and 34 for MARV pseudovirion, thus making it an attractive candidate for further anti-filovirus evaluation and development. water decoction followed by 60% ethanol precipitation
