A vaccination challenge study was carried out in 15, 7^9-week-old pups born to CDV immune dams. The CDV SN antibody titres of the three dams at whelping were high (600, 906 and 1520, respectively). Fifteen puppies with CDV SN antibody titre X30 were selected for the study. At least two litters were represented in each vaccine group as shown inTable 1. The canarypox-vectored CDVantigen was delivered in a combination lyophilized vaccine containing canine adenovirus, canine coronavirus, canine parain-£uenza and canine parvovirus (rDACPiP) antigens. Six pups received two doses of vaccine, administered subcutaneously, 3 weeks apart (Group 1). Six pups recived two doses of vaccine, administered intramuscularly, 3 weeks apart (Group 2). The remaining three pups received a vaccine identical to those animals in Groups 1 and 2, but devoid of canarypox-vectored CDV antigen (ACPiP). These three pups constituted the negative control group (Group 3). All pups were co-housed in pens regardless of group assignment. In order to evaluate protection against disease, CDV USDA NVSL challenge stock was administered intravenously to all pups 21 days after the second vaccination. All animals were observed twice daily for 21 days after challenge to record morbidity and mortality. The sta¡ performing clinical observations and laboratory analyses were ''blind'' to the dog/group assignments.
