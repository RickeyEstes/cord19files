Animal description and sample collection. Fresh tissue samples were collected from brain, lung, liver, kidneys, tonsil and tracheobronchial lymph nodes of three dogs (14P105D, 14P112N, 15P061D ) with respiratory symptoms in Bangkok, Thailand, that were also subjected to routine post-mortem gross and histopathological examination at Department of Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. In addition, twenty nasal or oral swabs were collected from other Thai dogs showing various degrees of respiratory problems (Table 1) , according to approval of Chulalongkorn University Animal Care and Use Committee (No. 1431005). All methods were performed in accordance guidelines and regulations. Routine virological testing. Extracted nucleic acids from the fresh tissues and swabs were subjected to routine laboratory investigations. Common viruses of canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC) including canine influenza virus (CIV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine distemper virus, (CDV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine adenovirus type 1 and 2 (CAdV1-2) and canine herpesvirus type 1 (CaHV-1) were screened for by multiplex PCRs 35, 36 . Pan-PCRs using degenerate primers specific for paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and herpesviruses were also performed on extracted nucleic acids as described previously 37-39 with some modifications. A commercial rapid CPV/CCV Ag test kit (Bionote Inc., Suwon, South Korea), was used to test intestinal swabs taken from the three necropsied dogs, to test for the presence of canine parvovirus (CPV) and canine enteric coronavirus (CCV) infections.
