In this worldwide comprehensive survey, were analyzed publicly available data from the WHO website:(http://www.who.int/csr/don/ archive/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/) related to laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases from September 23, 2012 until June 18, 2018. Data for the analyses was downloaded on June 20, 2018. This WHO database is periodically updated by the WHO. Epidemiological characteristics of each patient were retrieved including: Age, gender, travel history to endemic countries, nationality, country/city of origin. Also retrieved was clinical data on the symptomatic MERS patients including day/ month of the onset of symptom, day/month of the admission to the hospital, and comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease). Exposure to hazardous contacts was also collected, including healthcare workers (who worked in the hospital), camels, consumption of raw camel products, and exposure to MERS-CoV morbid patients at home or hospital within 14 days prior to the onset of symptomology. All the collected information was checked for missing or invalid data. Of a total input of 2220 MERS patient cases, 1408 with a complete data set were included in the analysis. In order to avoid measurement bias and miscategorization of cases, 812 of the 2220 patients with incomplete data were not included.
