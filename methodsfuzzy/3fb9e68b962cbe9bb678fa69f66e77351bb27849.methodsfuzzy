The ethical review board of our institution approved the design of this study (registration number: 13271). The Recent group included 110 patients (61 men, 49 women; mean (±standard deviation) age, 43 ± 13 years, range, 16e70 years); mean body mass index (BMI), (21.9 ± 3.3 kg/m 2 ) who underwent MRI of both hips after RT between April 2003 and June 2012 (i.e., during the period in which basiliximab was regularly used). During the period, 155 patients underwent RT. The Past group included 232 patients (143 men, 89 women; mean age, 34 ± 13 years; mean BMI, 21.9 ± 3.4 kg/ m 2 ) who had undergone RT between January 1986 and March 2003 (i.e., prior to the regular use of basiliximab). During the period, 332 patients underwent RT. There was no significant difference in the rates of MRI screening between the groups. (69.8% (232/332) vs 70.9% (110/155), p ¼ 0.80, chi-square test). All patients were notified about the reported incidences of ONFH after RT, benefits and risks of MRI, and possible treatment options, and given the opportunity to object. MRI was performed 3 months after RT using either a 1.0-T superconducting magnet system (SIGNA Horizon LX 1.0T; General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI), or one of two 1.5-T superconducting magnet systems (SMT150X; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan or Achieva 1.5T A-series; Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Osteonecrosis was defined as an area of normal intensity demarcated by a low-intensity band on T1-weighted imaging [16] . T1-weighted spin-echo images were obtained using a 1.5-T system in the coronal and sagittal planes, with the following settings: repetition time (TR), 500e800 ms; echo time (TE), 12e43 ms; and slice thickness, 2e10 mm. Spoiled gradient-recalled echo pulse sequences were obtained using the 1.0-T system in the coronal plane with the following settings: TR, 4.5e14 ms; TE, 1.84e3.08 ms; flip angle, 30 ; and slice thickness, 1.0e1.5 mm with no interslice gap. The following items were evaluated: ONFH incidence; patient demographic and background factors, including gender, age, BMI, and ABO and HLA incompatibility; duration of preoperative dialysis; type of renal graft (living/cadaveric donor); preoperative immunosuppressant use, including calcium inhibitors (cyclosporine A/tacrolimus) administered initially or at the time of hospital discharge; concomitant basiliximab administration; steroid administration at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after RT, as prednisolone (PSL), methylprednisolone (MPSL), and total steroid doses (converted to PSL-equivalent doses); postoperative renal function, including delayed graft function (DGF), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels at 8 weeks after RT, and acute transplant rejection; and duration of hospitalization. PSL-equivalent doses were calculated by adjusting the MPSL dose on the basis of antiinflammatory potency, using a conversion factor of 1.25. Acute transplant rejection was diagnosed as follows: a 40% increase in BUN or a 20% increase in Cr level compared with those at a previous sampling, daily urinary output 750 ml, and diagnosis by biopsy. DGF was defined as a patient requiring hemodialysis in the first week after RT. We compared these items between the Recent and Past groups using the ManneWhitney U-test, chi-square test, and Fisher's exact probability test for statistical analyses. In addition, we investigated factors influencing the incidence of ONFH for the entire cohort. Uniand multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify significant risk factors for ONFH for the entire cohort. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for predicting ONFH was determined for each factor identified by univariate logistic regression analysis. SPSS for Windows version 20.0J statistical software (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for all statistical analyses. A 5% significance level was applied to all tests.
