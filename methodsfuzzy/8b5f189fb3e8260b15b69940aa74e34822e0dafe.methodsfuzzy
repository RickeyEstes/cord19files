Individual faecal samples were taken from the rectum of the piglets at necropsy and stored at 4°C until coproscopical analyses were performed. All faecal samples were analysed by three different coproscopical methods: flotation/zinc chloride sedimentation technique; SAFC (sodium acetate -acetic acid -formalin -concentration) technique and Ziehl-Neelsen staining. In the frame of the PathoPig project, further laboratory investigations (e.g. histopathological, immunohistochemical, bacteriological and virological analyses) were decided by the pathologists according to the anamnesis, clinical data and necropsy findings. For example, a bacteriological investigation was performed to all animals with a history of diarrhoea and/or liquid faecal consistency in the large intestine, mostly directed to the identification of ETEC. The obtained E. coli pure isolates (isolated under aerobic conditions from Columbia blood agar with sheep blood, Oxoid AG, Pratteln, Switzerland) were further analysed by serotyping using different antisera (F4; F5; O141:K85 and O139:K82, Sifin Diagnostics GmbH, Berlin, Germany). If haemorrhagic enteritis in suckling piglets was observed, culture of Clostridium perfringens Type C from the faeces out of the small intestine was done (Columbia blood agar with sheep blood, Oxoid AG, Pratteln, Switzerland, incubated at 37°C for 24 h under anaerobic conditions). Detection of the target genes for the toxins α, β, β2 was done using real-time multiplex PCR [30] . Diarrheic piglets with a negative bacteriological result or sometimes parallel to the bacteriological investigation were tested by immunochromatography for Rotavirus A (FASTest® ROTA Strip Megacor, Hörbranz, Austria) and porcine Coronaviruses (Anigen Rapid TGE/PED Ag Test kit BioNote, Gyeonggi-do, Korea). A histopathological examination of the intestines was performed if no signs of autolysis were present, mostly in recently euthanized animals and only sporadically in animals which died on the farm. Lesions suggestive for Brachyspira spp. infection were never detected at necropsy and specific bacteriological diagnosis (culture followed by subsequent PCR detection [31] ) was only performed by request of the submitting veterinarian. In wasting pigs, ileum and lymphatic organs were always histopathologically investigated for lesions of infection with L. intracellularis and PCV2 respectively. L. intracelularis was intralesional demonstrated with Warthin-Starry silver nitrate-based stain and PCV2 was detected by immunohistochemistry using the monoclonal antibody F217 [32] . Only parasitological examinations were systematically conducted to all the animals included in this study.
