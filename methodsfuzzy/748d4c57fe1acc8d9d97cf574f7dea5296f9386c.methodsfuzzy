Cells. U2OS human osteosarcoma cells were cultured in McCoy's 5a medium (Gibco), and Vero grivet monkey kidney cells and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Gibco). All culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. Generation of U2OS NPC1-ko cells was carried out by CRISPR/Cas9mediated genome editing (62) using previously described methods (26) . Briefly, a CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) cloning vector (Addgene plasmid 41824) encoding an NPC1-specific gRNA that targets nucleotides 768 to 790 (5= GGCCTTGTCATTACTTGAGGGGG 3= on the complementary strand) of human NPC1 mRNA was cotransfected along with a plasmid encoding human-codon-optimized endonuclease Cas9 (Addgene plasmid 41815), a red fluorescent protein expression plasmid (to monitor transfection efficiency), and pMX-IRES-Bla (conferring blasticidin resistance to transfected cells). Following selection of transfected cells by blasticidin treatment, genomic DNA flanking the gRNA target site was amplified by PCR using forward (5= TCATAAACACACCAAACTTG-GAATC 3=) and reverse (5= TCCTGCGGCAGAGGTTTTC 3=) primers and tested for indels by Surveyor assay as previously described (26) . Once genome editing was confirmed at the population level, multiple single-cell clones were isolated for NPC1 gene sequencing. A clonal cell line, NPC1-#6, was found to contain a deletion of 13 nucleotides in both of its NPC1 alleles. The deletion in NPC1-#6 cells is predicted to cause a frame shift at amino acid position 167 that leads to production of a truncated protein of 215 amino acids, in comparison to the 1,278 amino acids of wild-type NPC1. We confirmed the absence of any remaining wild-type NPC1 alleles by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using NPC1-F (5= AGGC-CCCCTCAAGTAATGAC 3=, specific for the deleted sequence in the NPC1-knockout cell line) and npc1-R (5= GCCCAAAGTGCTGGT-CAAAG 3=) primers. Amplification of the site-1 protease (S1P) gene using S1P-F (5= GATGTGCTCTGGCAGATGGG 3=) and S1P-R (5= TTTCACGCCAGAACCCCGC 3=) primers was used as a positive control for RT-PCR. Viruses. Pseudotyped virions were generated by infecting 293T cells expressing viral glycoproteins with VSV lacking its G gene, as previously described (19, 26, 28) . GP cDNA derived from EBOV/H.sap/COD/76/ Yam-Mayinga (EBOV "Mayinga" isolate) was used to generate VSV-EBOV GP. EBOV GP⌬Muc lacks GP residues 309 to 489 (29) . All EBOV GP mutants were generated in the GP⌬Muc background. Infection supernatants were collected upon observation of significant cytopathy (1 to 4 days postinfection). Clarified supernatants were centrifuged at 4°C and 70,000 ϫ g using an SW28 rotor to pellet the virus. Viral pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and further purified through a 10% sucrose cushion at 4°C and 107,000 ϫ g using an SW41 rotor. Pellets were then resuspended in PBS at an approximate viral protein concentration of 1 mg/ml, and aliquots were stored at Ϫ80°C until use. Viral infectivity was assessed as previously described (19) . Cleavage of EBOV-GP was performed by incubating the virus with 250 g/ml thermolysin (Sigma) for 1 h for partially cleaved GP and 500 g/ml thermolysin for 2 h for fully cleaved GP at 37°C after the first ultracentrifugation step. Protease activity was quenched by addition of 1 mM phosphoramidon (Peptides International) and incubation on ice for 20 min prior to the second ultracentrifugation step through a sucrose cushion. The extent of cleavage was confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-GP1 antibody. Viral membranes were labeled with self-quenching concentrations of DiD (Life Technologies). Virus (50 g) was incubated with 250 M DiD for 90 min with gentle agitation in the dark at room temperature. Labeled virus was passed through a NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare) to remove excess dye and large aggregates and was used for imaging within 48 h. DiD labeling reduced viral infectivity by less than 10% (data not shown). Antibodies and inhibitors. ZMapp was a gift from John Dye (USAM-RIID). For production of KZ52, various heavy-and light-chain domains of KZ52 were chemically synthesized as codon-optimized sequences for expression in human cells by Epoch Life Sciences and cloned into pMAZ-IgH (containing the expression cassette of human ␥1 chain constant domains) and pMAZ-IgL (containing the expression cassette of human light-chain constant domains) vectors (63) , respectively, using a Gibson assembly kit (New England Biolabs). Sanger sequencing confirmed the identity of the cloned vectors. Antibody production and purification were carried out as described earlier (64), with modifications. Briefly, suspension-adapted HEK293-Freestyle cells-grown in suspension cultures in Freestyle F17 expression media (Thermo Scientific)-were cotransfected with pMAZ-IgH-KZ52 and pMAZ-IgL-KZ52 (1:1 ratio) vectors using polyethyleneimine. At 6 to 7 days posttransfection, the supernatant was collected and incubated overnight at 4°C with protein A agarose resin (GenScript Corporation) in the presence of cOmplete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Life Sciences). After the resin was washed with PBS (pH 8.0), bound IgG was eluted with 100 mM glycine (pH 3.0) into 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The eluate was concentrated and buffer exchanged with PBS by use of an Amicon centrifugal filter concentrator (Millipore) with a molecular weight cutoff of 30,000 Da. Purified antibody was stored at Ϫ20°C. Protein concentration and yield were determined by UV absorbance, and purity was determined by SDS-PAGE. For labeling coverslip-bound virus, KZ52 was conjugated with Zenon Alexa Fluor 555 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stock solutions of drugs were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or water and stored as frozen aliquots until use. Cells were incubated with ammonium chloride (Sigma) for 15 min or with E-64d (Peptides International) and tetrandrine (Sigma) for 1 h prior to experiments performed at the indicated concentrations. No preincubation with U18666A (Calbiochem) was performed. Inhibitors were maintained at the same concentrations during spinoculation and imaging. Expression of fluorescent endosome markers. For expression of fluorescently labeled endocytic pathway markers, cells were transduced with CellLight vectors (Life Technologies) for early endosomes (GFP-Rab5), late endosomes (GFP-Rab7), or lysosomes (GFP-LAMP1) 18 h prior to imaging according to the manufacturer's instructions. A retroviral packaging vector bearing NPC1-mNG was also generated, and cells were transduced 18 h in advance of imaging. Live-cell imaging. Live imaging was performed on a DeltaVision widefield epifluorescence microscope (GE Healthcare) at 37°C. The microscope was equipped with a heated environmental chamber, an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera (Photometrics), a 40ϫ/1.35 numerical-aperture (NA) oil immersion objective, and a DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate (TRITC)/Cy5 filter set. Cells were seeded on fibronectin-coated 35-mm-diameter coverslip dishes (MatTek) 24 h in advance of experiments and were grown to approximately 70% confluence. Dishes were placed on ice for several minutes before addition of virus. Virus in imaging buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, 2 g/ml Hoechst stain, and 2% FBS, pH 7.4) was spinoculated onto cells by 20 min of centrifugation at 1,500 ϫ g at 4°C. Inoculum volumes were adjusted so that 200 to 400 cell-associated particles were visible per field. Unbound particles were removed by four washes with cold PBS, and 500 l cold imaging buffer was added to the dish. Samples were mounted on the microscope and quickly focused, and then 1.5 ml warm imaging buffer was added to start the experiment (t ϭ 0). Images were acquired every 4 s over the duration of the experiments using a single Z-section, as the cells were very flat. Excluding the initial kinetics studies, all experiments were limited to 2 h. Data analysis. Image analysis and single-particle tracking were performed using Volocity software (PerkinElmer). Excluding minor adjustments in brightness and contrast, image files were not manipulated. For single-particle dequenching measurements, puncta were thresholded by initial intensity and size. Puncta falling outside the range of 0.125 to 1.0 m 2 expected of discrete VSV particles were excluded from analysis. For colocalization of dequenching particles with cellular markers, a virion was considered colocalized only if the GFP or mNG punctum exceeded the cellular background signal by 30% or more and if the GFP or mNG and DiD puncta cotrafficked (greater than 80% overlap of DiD signal with GFP or mNG signal) for at least 20 s before and after a dequenching event. The majority of colocalized dequenching events far exceeded these criteria. Mean measurements (Ϯ standard deviations [SD]) were derived from three separate experiments, unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significance was established by Student's t test or by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post hoc Dunnett's test (**, P Ͻ 0.01; ***, P Ͻ 0.001; ****, P Ͻ 0.0001).
