Viral RNA was extracted from the samples using the spin protocol of the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as described by the manufacturer and extended with an additional centrifugation step for 5 min at 20,0006g to dispose all residues of washing buffer before elution. Samples were eluted in 100 ml of pre-warmed 80uC AVE buffer. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed for the detection of five HCoVs; HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and MERS-CoV. Testing of samples was performed by pooling in batches of five to ten samples. Singleplex RT-PCR was used for detection of MERS-CoV as described elsewhere [36] while the other four HCoVs were detected with multiplex RT-PCR. For Multiplex RT-PCR testing of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, a 25 ml reaction was set up containing 5 ml of RNA, 1 ml of 10 mM dNTP mix (Qiagen), 5 ml of OneStep 5x buffer (Qiagen), 1 ml of Enzyme Mix (Qiagen), 600 nM of each forward and reverse primers for HCoV-NL63, 400 nM of each forward and reverse primers for HCoV-HKU1, 200 nM probe for each virus and 7 ml of RNASE free water. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 multiplex RT-PCR testing was similarly performed as described above except that 400 nM of each forward and reverse primers for HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 and 200 nM of the respective probes were used. The amplification procedure comprised reverse transcription at 55uC for 20 min followed by initial denaturation at 94uC for 3 min and 45 cycles of 94uC for 15 s and 58uC for 30 s. The sequences of primers and probes for each assay are shown in Table 1 as described elsewhere [18, 29, 36] . All PCR's were performed using light cycler 480 II (Roche, Germany).
