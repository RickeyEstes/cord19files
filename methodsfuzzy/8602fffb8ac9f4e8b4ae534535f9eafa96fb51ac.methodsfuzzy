Virus and ce//s . MHV strain A59 was propagated in a mouse fibroblast cell line and filtered (0 .2 µm) prior to use . The LD 50 of A59 was determined by end-point dilution in 4--6 week old male C57BL/6 mice . Primary mixed glial cell cultures were made from dissociated brains of newborn C57BL/6 mice essentially as described by Lavi et a/. 31 and were used 10-15 days after plating . These cultures contained 90-95% astrocytes as determined by immunostaining of glial fibrillary acidic protein 31 (data not shown) . These cultures also contain a few percent oligodendrocytes (measured by staining with antisera against galactocerebroside) and microglia (measured by phagocytosis of latex beads) . Primary glial cultures and 17 Cl-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) . EL-4 cells (an MHC-class I positive murine lymphoma cell line obtained from Glen Gaulton, University of Pennsylvania, PA) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS . Mice . Four to six week-old male, MHV-antibody free, C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) . A59 was diluted to 50 LD 50 per ml (approximately 2 .5X105 pfu/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0 .75% bovine serum albumin and 20 yl of this was injected into the left cerebral hemisphere of mice . Mock-infected controls received uninfected 17 CI-1 cell lysates comparably diluted . Virus-infected animals were housed in isolation for the duration of the experiments . RNA isolation . (a) From glial cell cultures . Cells growing in 60 mm dishes (1 .4x10 6 cells) were washed three times with cold Dulbecco's PBS and then lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCI, pH 8/100 mm NaCI/1 % Nonidet P-40 . The lysate was adjusted to 25 mm EDTA/1 %SDS/200 µg Proteinase K per ml and incubated at 37°C for 15 min . After extraction with phenol/chloroform, the RNA was precipitated with ethanol, washed once, and resuspended in water . (b) From brain . Brains were removed and washed once with Dulbecco's PBS . The tissue was homogenized in 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (BMB) and layered over a cushion of 5 .7 M CsCl . The RNA was pelleted in an SW41 rotor at 32000 rpm, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCI, pH 7 .4/1 mm EDTA, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated as described above . The RNA was washed once, resuspended in water, and quantitated by UV spectroscopy . Northern blots . RNA (10 µg) was resuspended in 20 mm MOPS/1 mm EDTA/5 mm Na acetate/2 .2 M formaldehyde/50% formamide and denatured by heating at 65°C for 10 min . After electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel containing 2 .2 M formaldehyde, the RNA was transferred to nylon membranes (Gene Screen Plus, New England Nuclear) and hybridized with [ 32 P]-cDNA probes in 50% formamide at 42°C according to the manufacturer's suggestions . Membranes were rinsed twice with 2xSSC at room temperature, washed twice with 2 x SSC/0 .1 % SDS at 60°C, twice with 0 .1 x SSC at room temperature, and exposed to X-ray film at -80°C . Dot blots. Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from either mock-or A59-infected glial cells as described above . Samples were adjusted to 6% formaldehyde/50% formamide, denatured, and 10 pg of RNA was spotted onto Gene Screen Plus membranes . RNA probes, transcribed in vitro as described below and labeled with [ 32 P]-UTP, were hybridized at 75°C in 5xSSPE (1 xSSPE is 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH 2 PO 4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7 .4)/2xDenhardt's solution [1 x Denhardt's is 0 .02% (w/v) each ficoll, bovine serum albumin, polyvinylpyrrolidone)/1 SDS/100 pg/ml salmon sperm DNA/50% formamide] . Following hybridization, the membranes were washed three times in 0 .1 xSSPE/0 .1 % SDS at 75°C and exposed to X-ray film at -80°C . Bound probe was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting . In situ hybridization. Hybridizations were performed on frozen brain sections or on infected cells as described previously ." Briefly, samples were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, incubated in 0 .1 M Tris/0 .1 M glycine, acetylated in 0 .1 M triethanol amine-HCI, pH 8/0 .25% acetic anhydride, and then dehydrated through graded ethanols . [ 35 S]-labeled RNA probes were allowed to hybridize at 50°C for 4 h in 10% dextran sulfate/1 x Denhardt's solution/4 x SSC/10 mm DTT/1 mg yeast RNA per ml/1 mg salmon sperm DNA per ml/50% formamide . Following hybridization, samples were washed twice in 2xSSC/50% formamide at 52°C and digested with RNase A in 2xSSC at 37°C . The samples were then rinsed in 2xSSC/50% formamide at 52°C, washed overnight in 2xSSC/0 .05% Triton X-100, and dehydrated through graded ethanols . Slides were coated with emulsion (NTB-2, Kodak) and exposed for 3-6 weeks at 4°C . Nucleic acid probes. DNA probes used for hybridization included (1) a 1 .2 kb MHC class I cDNA (pH211 ; 33), (2) a 1 kb MHC class II cDNA (obtained from J . Woodward, University of Kentucky, KY), (3) a 3 kb viral cDNA derived from the 3' end of the A59 genome containing sequences from viral genes 4, 5, 6 and 7 (clone 320 ; unpublished data), and (4) a previously described actin-specific 3 kb EcoRl fragment obtained from R . Weinmann, Wistar Institute ." Probes were labeled with [32 P]-dCTP by random priming to 5 x 10 6 cpm/µg or greater . RNA probes were transcribed in vitro in the presence of [35 S]-UTP from cDNAs subcloned into pGEM plasmids (Promega) containing promoters for SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases in opposite orientations . Specific activities were generally 1-5x10 $ cpm/µg . RNA probes for in situ hybridizations were hydrolyzed to approximately 100 base pairs prior to use .
