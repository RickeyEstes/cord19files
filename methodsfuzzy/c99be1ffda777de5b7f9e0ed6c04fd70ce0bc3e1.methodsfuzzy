Mice and cells. C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (http://www.criver.com/). 129Sv and type I IFN receptordeficient mice (IFNAR À/À ) [28] were obtained from the Institut fü r Labortierkunde (University of Zü rich) and bred in our facilities. All mice were maintained in individually ventilated cages and were used between 6 and 9 wk of age. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Swiss Federal legislation on animal protection. MC57, BHK-21, L929, 293, and CV-1 cells were purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (http://www.ecacc.org.uk/). D980R cells were a kind gift from G. L. Smith, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom. 17Clone1 cells were a kind gift from S. G. Sawicki, Medical University of Ohio, Toledo, Ohio, United States. BHK-MHV-N cells, expressing the MHV-A59 nucleocapsid protein under the control of the TET/ON system (Clontech, http://www. clontech.com/), have been described previously [24] . All cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (5%-10%) and antibiotics. Isolation of dendritic cells and macrophages, flow cytometry, and antibodies. Murine cDCs and pDCs were obtained from spleens of C57BL/6, 129Sv, or IFNAR À/À mice following digestion with collagenase type II (Gibco-BRL, http://www.invitrogen.com/) for 20 min at 37 8C. Cells were resuspended in PBS supplemented with 2% FCS and 2 mM EDTA and overlaid on 20% Optiprep density gradient medium (Sigma-Aldrich, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/). After centrifugation at 700g for 15 min, low density cells were depleted of CD3-and CD19positive cells using DYNAL magnetic beads according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen. com/). The DC-enriched preparations were stained with a-PDCA-1, a-CD11b, and a-CD11c, and the distinct pDC and cDC populations were sorted using a FACS ARIA (BD Biosciences, http://www. bdbiosciences.com/) sorter. Purity of both cell preparations was always .98%. Murine bone marrow-derived cDCs or pDCs were generated by 6 to 7 d of culture with either granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-containing supernatant from the cell line X63-GM-CSF (kindly provided by Antonius Rolink, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland) or Flt3-L (R&D Systems, http://www.rndsystems.com/) at 20 ng/ml, respectively. Bone marrow-derived cDCs were further purified using Optiprep density gradient centrifugation. Bone marrow-derived pDCs were purified using the mouse pDC isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, http://www.miltenyibiotec.com/) adapted for the isolation of in vitro-derived pDCs by adding CD11b-biotin to the negative selection cocktail. Antibodies used in this study were purchased from BioLegend (http://www.biolegend.com/): CD11c-PE, B220-APC, CD11b-FITC; or from Miltenyi Biotec: mPDCA-1-FITC and CD11c-APC. Thioglycolate-elicited macrophages were collected from the peritoneal cavity of mice and cultured at 4 3 10 5 cells per well in DMEM (with 10% FCS, L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin) for 2 h at 37 8C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with cold PBS. Recombinant DNA and viruses. LCMV-WE strain, originally obtained from F. Lehmann-Grube (Hamburg, Germany), was propagated on L929 cells. MHV A59 was generated from a molecularly cloned cDNA [24] based on the Albany strain of MHV A59. Coronaviruses and recombinant vaccinia viruses were propagated, titrated, and purified as described [24, 50, 51] . Mutant vaccinia viruses are based on the recombinant vaccina virus vMHV-inf-1 (containing the full-length MHV-A59 cDNA) and were generated using our reverse genetic system as described previously [24] . Briefly, the gene to be mutated was replaced by the Escherichia coli guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase (GPT) gene through vaccinia virus-mediated homologous recombination, and GPT-positive clones were selected by three rounds of plaque purification on CV-1 cells in the presence of xanthine, hypoxanthine, and mycophenolic acid (GPT-positive selection) [50] . In a second round, the GPT gene was replaced by the mutated gene, and GPTnegative clones, containing the mutated gene, were selected by three rounds of plaque purification on D980R cells in the presence of 6thioguanine (GPT-negative seletion) [50] . To construct the recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the MHV-nsp1D99 cDNA, the 59 end of the MHV-A59 cDNA in vMHV-inf-1 was replaced by GPT using the plasmid pRec4. This plasmid is based on pGPT-1 [50] , and the GPT gene is flanked to its left by 500 bp of vaccinia DNA and to its right by an internal ribosomal entry sequence (IRES) followed by MHV-A59 nts 952-1315. The GPT-negative selection was carried out using the plasmid pRec15. This plasmid contains 250 bp of vaccinia DNA followed by the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter, one G nucleotide, and MHV nts 1-828 linked to MHV nts 928-1315. To replace the MHV-A59 accessory gene 4 in vMHV-inf-1 and vMHV-nsp1D99 by a gene encoding a fusion protein of EGFP and the LCMVderived CTL epitope KAVYNFATC (GP33-GFP) [29] , the plasmid pRec8 was used for recombination with vaccinia viruses vMHV-inf-1 and vMHV-nsp1D99 . This plasmid contains the GPT gene flanked to its left by MHV nts 27500-27967 and to its right by MHV nts 28265-28700. GPT-negative selection was carried out using the plasmid pRec9. This plasmid contains MHV bp 27500-27967, the GP33-GFP gene, and MHV nts 28265-28700. Further cloning details, plasmid maps, and sequences are available from the authors upon request. Recombinant coronaviruses were rescued from cloned cDNA using purified vaccinia virus DNA as template for the in vitro transcription of recombinant MHV genomes as described [51] . The firefly luciferase (FF-Luc) plasmid for monitoring IFN-b promoter activation (p125-Luc) was kindly provided by Takashi Fujita, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Japan [52] . The FF-Luc reporter construct for monitoring ISRE activation (p(9-27)4tkD(À39)lucter) [53] was kindly provided by Stephen Goodbourn, St. George's Hospital Medical School, London, UK. The control plasmid pRL-SV40 (Promega, http://www.promega.com/) encodes the renilla luciferase (REN-Luc) gene under control of the constitutive SV40 promoter. The negative control expression plasmid contained the reading frame of the N-terminus of the human MxA protein. To construct the coronavirus nsp1 expression plasmids, the MHV nts 1-951 (pMHV-nsp1), MHV nts 1-902 (pMHV-D49), MHV nts 1-851 (pMHV-D100), HCoV-229E nts 293-625 (pHCoV-229E-nsp1), and SARS-CoV nts 265-804 (pSARS-CoV-nsp1) were amplified by standard PCR techniques and cloned downstream of a CMV promoter between the SmaI and XhoI sites of the eukaryotic high-level expression plasmid pI.18 (kindly provided by Jim Robertson, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Hertfordshire, UK). Transient transfections and reporter gene assays. Subconfluent cell monolayers of 293 cells seeded in 12-well plates were transfected with 250 ng p125-Luc reporter plasmid, 50 ng pRL-SV40, and 1 lg of expression plasmid in 200 ll of OPTIMEM (Gibco-BRL) containing 3.9 ll of Fugene HD (Roche, http://www.roche.com). At 8 h post transfection, cells were induced with either 0.2 lg of viral ssRNA containing 59 triphosphates [54] (p125-Luc), 2.5 lg of poly(I:C) (Sigma), or 500 U/ml IFN-a (p(9-27)4tkD(À39)lucter), or left uninduced. After an incubation period of 16 h, cells were harvested and lysed in 100 ll of Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). An aliquot of 10 ll lysate was used to measure luciferase activity as decribed by the manufacturer (Promega). Virus infections, determination of virus titers, and liver enzyme values. Mice were injected intraperitoneally or intracranially with indicated pfu of MHV A59 or intravenously with the indicated pfu of LCMV and sacrificed at the indicated time points. Organs were stored at À70 8C until further analysis. Blood was incubated at RT to coagulate, centrifuged, and serum was used for ALT measurements using a Hitachi 747 autoanalyzer (http://www.hitachi.com/). Peritoneal exudates cells (PECs) were isolated from the peritoneal cavity by flushing with 4 ml of ice-cold PBS. MHV titers were determined by standard plaque assay using L929 cells. LCMV titers in the spleens were determined 4 d after intravenous challenge in an LCMV infectious focus assay as previously described [55] . Histology, IFN-a ELISA, IFN-a treatment. Organs were fixed in 4% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images were acquired using a Leica DMRA microscope (Leica, http://www.leica.com/) with a 253/0.65 NA objective (total magnification, 3162). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, http://www.adobe.com). Mouse IFN-a concentration in cell culture supernatants was measured by ELISA (PBL Biomedical Laboratories, http://www.interferonsource.com/) according to the manufacturer's instructions. IFN-a treatment of cells prior to MHV infection was performed using universal type I IFN (IFN-aA/D, Sigma). Intracellular cytokine staining. Specific ex vivo production of IFNc was determined by intracellular cytokine staining. Organs were removed at the indicated time points following infection with recombinant MHV. For intracellular cytokine staining, single cell suspensions of 1 3 10 6 splenocytes were incubated for 5 h at 37 8C in 96-well round-bottom plates in 200 ll of culture medium containing 25 U/ml IL-2 and 5 lg/ml Brefeldin A (Sigma). Cells were stimulated with phorbolmyristateacetate (PMA, 50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (500 ng/ml) (both purchased from Sigma) as positive control or left untreated as a negative control. For analysis of peptide-specific responses, cells were stimulated with 10 À6 M GP33 peptide or 10 À4 M MHV S598 peptide. The percentage of CD8 þ T cells producing IFN-c was determined using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Both S598 (RCQIFANI) and GP33 (KAVYNFATC) peptides were purchased from Neosystem (http://www.neomps.com/). Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, http://www.graphpad.com/). Data were analyzed with the paired Student's t-test assuming that the values followed a Gaussian distribution. A p-value of , 0.05 was considered significant.
