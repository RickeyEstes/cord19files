HR-MS: DFS Thermo Scientific spectrometer in a full scan mode (15-500 m/z, 70 eV electron impact ionization, direct sample administration). Spectral and analytical studies were carried out at the Collective Chemical Service Center of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Column chromatography (CC) was performed on silica gel (60-200 l, Macherey-Nagel). The purity of the target compounds was determined by gas chromatography methods. All the target compounds reported in this paper have a purity of at least 95%. The following reagents were used in this study: (1R)-(+) camphor (Alfa Aesar 98%, ½a 25 D 45.5 (CHCl 3 , c 0.8)), ee 99, propane-1,3-diamine (Aldrich 98%), hexane-1,6-diamine (Aldrich 98%), heptane-1,7-diamine (Acros 98%), octane-1,8-diamine (Acros 98%), dodecane-1,12-diamine (ABCR 98%), 4,4 0 -methylenedianiline (ABCR 97%) 4,4 0 -oxydianiline (ABCR 97%). The enumeration of atoms in compounds is given in order to assign the signals in the NMR spectra and does not coincide with the enumeration of atoms in the IUPAC name (see Supplementary) . The specific rotation is given in (deg ml) ⁄ (g dm) À1 ; concentrations of solutions, in (g) (100 ml) À1 . To a solution of (1R)-(+)-camphor 1 (3 g, 19.7 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and diamine (9.8 mmol, 0.5 equiv) in toluene (60 ml) 0.15 ml BF 3 ÁEt 2 O in 5 ml toluene were added. The solution was heated at reflux with a Deane-Stark trap condenser until no further water appeared. The combined organic layers were washed two times with brine, dried (Na 2 SO 4 ) and evaporated to dryness. The reaction solution was then concentrated and crude product purified by flash silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate eluent) to obtain the desired diimine 2a-e. 19 .40 q (C 9 , C 9 0 ), 11.31 q (C 10 , C 10 0 ), 52.19 t (C 11 , C 11 0 ), 30.44 t (C 12 , C 12 0 ), 27.31 t (C 13 13 C NMR (d, ppm): 180.97 s (C 1 , C 1 0 ), 35.21 t (C 2 , C 2 0 ), 43.73 d (C 3 , C 3 0 ), 27.38 t (C 4 , C 4 0 ), 32.10 t (C 5 , C 5 0 ), 53.23 s (C 6 , C 6 0 ), 46.67 s (C 7 , C 7 0 ), 18.84 q (C 8 , C 8 0 ), 19.40 q (C 9 , C 9 0 ), 11.32 q (C 10 , C 10 0 ), 52.26 t (C 11 , C 11 0 ), 30.39 t (C 12  Camphor (15 mmol) and the diamine (7.5 mmol) were combined and treated with one drop of coned H 2 SO 4 . Si(OEt) 4 (15 mmol) was added and the mixture was placed into a flask equipped with a still head. The solution was heated at 160°C under argon. The distillate (EtOH) was discarded and the residue was dissolved in Et 2 O (50 mL) and washed with saturated NaHCO 3 solution and H 2 O (25 mL each). The Et 2 O solution was dried (Na 2 SO 4 ) and solvent removed under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in 10 mL of 95% EtOH and treated with 2 mL of 1 M KOH in EtOH. The solution was stirred for 15-20 min and filtered; the precipitate was washed with Et 2 O. The filtrate was washed with H 2 O (220 mL) and dried (Na 2 SO 4 ).
