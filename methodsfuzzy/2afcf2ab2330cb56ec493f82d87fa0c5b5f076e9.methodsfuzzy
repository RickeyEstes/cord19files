Baseline characteristics of subjects were compared between the three periods using a chi-squared test of homogeneity for categorical variables and analysis of variance for continuous variables. An a priori level of statistical significance of 0.05 was assumed. The baseline period extended over one year to give an indication of the baseline pattern of change in the rate of concordant prescribing over time, in the absence of any intervention. The academic detailing period included enough patients to detect an improvement in mean concordance from 65% to 75% (188 patients, power = 0.8 and p = 0.05). The computerised decision support period included enough patients to detect an expected further improvement in concordance from 75% to 85% (120 patients, power = 0.8, p = 0.05). Multivariable logistic models were used to compare the mean proportions of concordance across the three periods, while adjusting for disease severity, age, and suspected aspiration. Secondary outcome measures were assessed in the same way. Specifically, among the patients who required ICU admission, the proportion directly admitted from ED to the ICU, and the proportion administered appropriate broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic therapy, were compared. This was specifically recorded as a measure of the degree of recognition of markers of severe illness, which were a key focus of the guideline content. The proportion of patients with a known antibiotic allergy who received that antibiotic was also compared. Time to antibiotic administration was recorded as a measure of whether the CDSS delayed decision making to any extent. A time series analysis was performed to evaluate changes in concordance of prescribing over time, covering all three time periods. The rate of concordant prescribing was expected to improve over time. Change in concordance over time was assessed with a binary logistic model, incorporating month of treatment as a continuous variable. The 'expected' proportion of concordant treatment at any given time then plausibly corresponds to a regression line fitted through the data. We hypothesized that the rate of concordant prescribing after the intervention (in the third time period) would be greater than that expected given the observed trend before the intervention (the first and second time periods). Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 9.0. [19]
