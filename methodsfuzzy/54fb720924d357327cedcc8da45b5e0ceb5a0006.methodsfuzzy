On the basis of the frequency of their uses for HFMD, twelve medicinal materials were purchased from local herbal markets in Nanjing. Voucher specimens were stored at the Laboratory of Microbial Science, School of Medicine, Nanjing University. The corresponding Latin names, followed by abbreviations of the names and parts of the plants used for pharmaceutical and clinical practices, are listed in Table 1 . We used a modified protocol to prepare water extracts [10] . In brief, two grams of ground specimen was soaked with 30 mL of distilled water at room temperature (RT) for an hour with occasional shaking. Subsequently, the material was warmed up to 65 ∘ C in a water bath and extracted for 4 hr. The material was extracted one more time, and the pooled liquid fractions were left at RT for overnight to let insoluble materials settle down. Finally, water soluble materials were separated from the insoluble debris by centrifugation (5000 ×g, 15 min). The major chemical components in those extracts were validated following protocols given in Chinese Pharmacopeia (2010 ed.). Those showed that antiviral activities were further studied to validate the presence of characteristic chemicals in the plants following some literatures (e.g., used HPLC profiling for H. cordata and M. haplocalyx). The water extracts were then dried by lyophilization. The lyophilized powders were stored at −70 ∘ C and dissolved in distilled water to make stocks of 20 mg/mL before experiments. The study design and assays used to validate the activity of the selected herbs are summarized in Figure 7 .
