Cells, viruses, antibodies, and interferon. A549 cells and derivatives were grown as monolayers in 25-cm 2 , 75-cm 2 , or 300-cm 2 tissue culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C. When appropriate, cells were treated with human recombinant interferon (Intron A; Merck, Sharpe and Dohme) at 1,000 units/ml. Viruses used in these studies were PIV2 (strain Colindale), PIV3 (strains Washington and JS and recombinant ⌬C and ⌬D JS viruses [32] ), PIV5 (formerly known as SV5; strains W3 [33] and CPI ϩ and CPI Ϫ [34] ), MuV (Enders [35] ), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (36) , Sendai virus (strain Cantell, free of defective interfering particles), and canine distemper virus (strain Mill Hill). Plaque assays were performed by standard methods in six-well dishes that included 0.1% Avicel (FMC Biopolymer) in the overlay medium. Plaques were visualized by immunostaining by using a pool of monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antisera specific for the different viruses as described previously (37) , together with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody by using SigmaFast BCIP/ NBT as the substrate. Preparation of L-[ 35 S]methionine-labeled total-cell extracts and SDS-PAGE. Infected or uninfected cells that had or had not been pretreated with IFN for 12 h prior to infection were metabolically labeled for 1 h with L-[ 35 S]methionine (500 Ci/mmol; MP Biomedical, USA) at 18 h postinfection (p.i.). After labeling, cells were lysed in disruption buffer, sonicated, and heated for 5 min at 100°C and then analyzed by gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gels were fixed, stained, and dried, and resolved bands were visualized by phosphorimager analysis. When appropriate, the same amounts of cell equivalents were run on PAGE. Furthermore, the amount of protein in each sample was monitored by staining the polyacrylamide gels (PAGs) with Coomassie brilliant blue. Immunofluorescence. Cells to be stained for immunofluorescence were grown on 10-mm-diameter coverslips (MIC3270; Scientific Laboratory Supplies, United Kingdom). Cells were stained with specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), as described in detail elsewhere (38) . Briefly, monolayers were fixed with 5% formaldehyde-2% sucrose in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at 20°C, permeabilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 -10% sucrose in PBS for 5 min at 20°C, and washed three times in PBS containing 1% calf serum. PIV5-and PIV3-infected cells were detected by indirect immunofluorescence using a secondary goat antimouse Ig Texas Red-conjugated antibody (catalog number ab6787; Abcam). The primary antibodies were PIV5-NP-a and PIV5-Pe for PIV5 (39) and 4721, 2281, and 4812 for PIV3 (40) . After staining for immunofluorescence, the monolayers of cells were examined with a Nikon Microphot-FXA immunofluorescence microscope. RNA selection and in vitro translation. RNA for in vitro translations was isolated by sedimentation through CsCl gradients by a modified method described by Leppert et al. (41) . Confluent monolayers of infected cells, grown in 300-cm 2 flasks, were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 0.6% NP-40, protease inhib-itor cocktail [complete Mini EDTA-free, 1 tablet per 7 ml of buffer; Roche]) at 1 ϫ 10 8 to 2 ϫ 10 8 cells per ml and left on ice for 5 min prior to vortexing for 2 min. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation twice at 4,200 ϫ g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was collected, made up to 6 mM EDTA, and layered onto 35% (wt/wt) CsCl in 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)-2 mM EDTA followed by centrifugation at 175,000 ϫ g at 12°C for 16 to 18 h. Naked RNA (including mRNA) forms a pellet at the bottom of the gradient, while viral genomic and antigenomic RNAs remain complexed with nucleoprotein and do not enter the 35% CsCl cushion. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in RNase-free water and adjusted to 1 g/l. Selected RNA was translated in vitro with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit (L4960; Promega) in the presence of [ 35 S]methionine-cysteine (NEG772, EasyTag Express Protein Labeling mix; PerkinElmer) using a modification to the manufacturer's instructions: methionine-cysteine-free medium (D0422; Sigma) was used to provide other amino acids (1 l per 50 l reaction mixture). Capping and methylation of mRNA. Human RNA guanylyltransferase and 5=-phosphatase (RNGTT), RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase (RNMT), and cap methyltransferase 1 (CMTR1) were synthesized and purified according to the method of Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et al. (42) . As described in that study, the enzymes were all verified as being active by in vitro reactions followed by thin-layer chromatography. Capping and methylation reactions were carried out in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mM KCl, 1.25 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) buffer as follows: 1 l 10ϫ buffer, 1 l RNGTT (2.5 mg/ml), 1 l RNMT (0.5 mg/ml), CMTR1 (0.28 mg/ml), 1 l SAM (2 mM), 1 l GTP (1 mM), 0.5 l RNasin, 2 l RNA (1 g/l). The reaction mixture was made up to 10 l with H 2 O, including in experiments in which RNGTT, RNMT, or CMTR1 was omitted, and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Cloning and purification of IFIT1. IFIT1 was amplified with primer IFIT1F/IFIT1Xho from the plasmid pGAC-HA-IFIT1, restricted with NcoI and XhoI, and ligated with a modified pLOU3, in which maltose binding protein (MPB) was replaced with SUMO, while SalI in the mutliple cloning site (MCS) was replaced with XhoI. The primers were as follows: IFIT1F, CCGCCATGGCTACAAATGGTGATGATCATCAGG; IFIT1Xho, GCGCCTCGAGCTAAGGACCTTGTCTCACAGAGTT. The fusion protein His-SUMO-(TEV)-IFIT1 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta in 6 liters LB-ampicillin-chloramphenicol (LB/ Amp/CM). Isopropyl-␤-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; 0.2 mM) was added when an optical density (OD) of 0.8 was reached. The expression was carried out at 18°C overnight. Purification was carried out with a routine protocol for His-tagged protein. The binding buffer contained 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.3 M NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole; the washing buffer contained 30 mM imidazole; and protein was eluted with 300 mM imidazole. To remove nonspecifically bound RNA, the columns were washed with 9 volumes of 0.2 M Na 2 HPO 4 -4 M NaCl (pH 7.5). After desalting into GF buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol), the fusion was cleaved with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (1:100) at room temperature overnight. Gel filtration was carried out after passing through Ni beads again and addition of 3 mM DTT. The IFIT1 peak was collected and concentrated and had an A 260 /A 280 of 0.7 to 0.8.
