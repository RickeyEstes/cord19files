In total, 56 laboratories from 16 provinces, municipalities, or autonomous regions participated in the EQA for MERS-CoV molecular detection. Among them, 34 laboratories were from the provincial or municipal CDC of China, 13 laboratories were from [10] [11] [12] [13] were all involved in these amplified sequences. designated hospitals for suspected MERS-CoV infection, and nine were commercial kit manufacturers (Fig. 1A ). In addition, half of the participants have established the MERS-CoV molecular detection project since 2014. For nucleic acid extraction, various commercial kits were applied by the selected laboratories (Fig. 1B) . Among them, 36 participants (64.3%) chose the spin column method, 19 participants (33.9%) chose the magnetic bead method, and one (1.8%) used the TRIzol method to extract RNA. Manual extraction was preferred by most agencies while others (15/56, 26.8%) applied an automated nucleic acid extractor. However, with the exception of three participants who employed an in-house-developed rRT-PCR assay, all other participants (53/56, 94.6%) applied commercially available rRT-PCR kits (Fig. 1C ).
