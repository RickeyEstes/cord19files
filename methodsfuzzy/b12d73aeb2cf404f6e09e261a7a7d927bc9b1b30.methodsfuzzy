Cells and virus. Georgia bovine kidney (GBK) cells were grown as monolayers in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM), (Grand Island Biological Co., Grand Island, N. Y.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Grand Island Biological Co.). Strain P8-2 of BHV-1 was propagated in GBK cells and quantitated by plaquing in microtiter plates with an antibody overlay as described previously (Rouse and Babiuk, 1974) . Potassium tartarate gradient analysis. Monolayers of GBK cells were infected with BHV-1 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1. After adsorption for 1 hr at 37", the virus was removed and the cells were overlaid with methionine-free MEM containing 2% FBS and tunicamycin or monensin, if used. Six hours later 25 &i/ ml of [?S]methionine (Amersham, Oakville, Ontario) was added to the cells. At 34 hr postinfection, virus was purified from the infected cells (cell-associated virus) and the supernatant medium (extracellular virus). To release the intracellular virus the infected cells were sonicated for 15 set at a setting of '7 on a Sonifier cell disrupter (Model W140D, Ul-trasonics, Plainsview, N. Y.). After removal of the cell debris the virus was pelleted by centrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 2 hr in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Model L8-55). The virus pellet was resuspended in TNE (0.01 M Tris-hydrochloride, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.001 M EDTA, pH 7.5) by mild sonication and layered onto an 11-ml linear 20 to 50% potassium tartrate gradient in TNE. After centrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 1; hr in a SW41 rotor at 4", fractions were collected and assayed for radioactivity and infectivity. The viruscontaining fractions were pooled, diluted with TNE, and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 2 hr in a SW41 rotor at 4" to collect the virus. (NP40)). After 15 min on ice, they were sonicated for 15 see at a setting of 4 on a Sonifier cell disrupter (Model 140D, Ultrasonics). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 80,000 rpm for 15 min in a 30" Al00 rotor (Beckman Airfuge) or at 25,000 rpm for 1 hr in a SB405 rotor at 4' (IEC Model B-60), and the supernatant was immediately used for immunoprecipitation.
