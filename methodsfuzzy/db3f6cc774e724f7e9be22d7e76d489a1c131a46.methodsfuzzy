In this retrospective study, archived lung tissue of 638 common marmosets (317 males and 321 females) originating from the marmoset colony of the German Primate Center in Göttingen, Germany, was used. Archived material included formalin-fixed or paraffin-embedded lung tissue, or histological sections of the lung, which were collected between 1997 and 2011. Animals of this study were housed in small family groups in an indoor facility with a room temperature of 25 • C and relative humidity of 50-60 % on a 12 h light-dark cycle with 30 min "dawn" and "dusk" periods. Care and housing conditions of the animals complied with the regulations of the European Parliament and the Council Directive on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (2010/63/EU), the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (2010), and the applicable German Animal Protection Law. According to necropsy records, animals underwent necropsy after spontaneous death, following euthanasia due to illness with poor prognosis, or after scheduled terminal kill in the context of experimental studies. From the latter group of marmosets only control animals or animals without treatment-related findings were considered for re-evaluation of lung histology. Photographic documentation of respective macroscopic pulmonary findings and results from bacteriological culture of the lungs were available for some animals. Lung tissue samples were fixed in 4 or 10 % phosphate-buffered formaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 3 µm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). If required for diagnostic purposes, additional stains were prepared and analyzed, including periodic acid Schiff (PAS) reaction, Prussian blue stain, von Kossa stain, Masson's trichrome stain, Congo red stain, Grocott's methenamine silver stain, and Giemsa stain. The lungs of all 638 marmosets were re-examined histologically, and findings were reported on a spreadsheet (Microsoft Office Excel 2010) with searchable columns for morphological diagnosis/histological finding, sex, age, cause of death (if known), chronicity of lesion (in case of inflammation), and severity grade. Animals were assigned to three age groups: newborn (0 to 7 days old, including supposedly timely delivered but stillborn marmosets), juvenile (7 days to 30 months old), and adult (older than 30 months). Histological findings were grouped into inflammatory conditions, neoplasia, changes in air content, circulatory disturbances, pigment deposition, and miscellaneous findings. Total incidences of findings were indicated in absolute numbers and percentage. In addition, absolute numbers of findings were calculated for males and females as well as different age groups.
