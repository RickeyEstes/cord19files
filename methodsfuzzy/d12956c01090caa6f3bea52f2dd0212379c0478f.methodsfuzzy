Included studies that used PCR methods for the detection of the respiratory viruses are summarized in Table 1 [15, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] 54] . The overall analysis of these studies shows the most common viruses detected among pilgrims (Fig. 2) , including influenza (A and B) virus (7.1%), influenza A (5.1%), rhinovirus (5.1%), and influenza B (1.9%). These studies did not screen for the same surveyed viruses and there was a large variation in the screened viruses (see Fig. 2 ). A number of studies have detected respiratory viruses among pilgrims using culture methods (Table 2) . These studies included a total of 1866 pilgrims, and the most common viruses detected among them are shown in Fig. 3 . Other studies, using alternative methods for the detection of respiratory viruses, have detected respiratory viruses (primarily influenza viruses) among pilgrims. ELISA was used in three studies [47] [48] [49] and direct immunofluorescence staining was used in one study [46] . A summary of the findings of these studies are presented in Table 3 .
