RT-PCR analysis of ACE2 mRNA expression. Total RNA was isolated from 1 Â 10 6 cells using the RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Five hundred nanograms of total RNA was treated with DNaseI followed by reverse transcription using oligo(dT) oligonucleotides and the AMV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNAs were subjected to either amplification with oligonucleotides specific for GAPDH (GAPDH-5: 5 0 -ATGGGGAAGGTGAAGGTCGG-3 0 ; GAPDH-3: 5 0 -ATACTTCTCATGGTTCACAC-3 0 ) or ACE2 (ACE2-5: 5 0 -GTAAG GCCACTGCTCAACTAC-3 0 ; ACE2-3: 5 0 -TTTTTCTAAAAGGAG GTCTGAACATC-3 0 ). For detection of ACE2 transcripts, a nested PCR was performed using 5 ll of the first round PCR product as template and oligonucleotides ACE2nested-5 (5 0 -GATGGAGTACCG ACTGGAGTCC-3 0 ) and ACE2nested-3 (5 0 -CTAATATCGATGGAG GCATAAGG-3 0 ) for amplification. As a control, nested PCRs were performed using the input RNA prior to reverse transcription. Plasmid construction and mutagenesis. Eukaryotic expression vectors for ACE2 were constructed by reverse transcription of total RNA derived from human (hu) 293T kidney cells and African green monkey (agm) Vero E6 cells using the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) and either oligonucleotides huACE2-5 (5 0 -CCCGGTACC CACCATGTCAAGCTCTTCCTGGCTCCTTCTC-3 0 ) and huACE2-3 (5 0 -GGGCTCGAGTTTTTCTAAAAGGAGGTCTGAACATC-3 0 ) or oligonucleotides agmACE2 (5 0 -CCCGGTACCCACCATGTCCAG CTCCTCCTGGCTCCTTCTC-3 0 ) and agmACE2-3 (5 0 -GGGCTCG AGCTAAAAGGAAGTCTGAGCATCATCA-3 0 ). The resulting amplificates were inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector via KpnI and XhoI. Carboxy-terminal ACE2 deletion mutants were constructed by PCR using the huACE2-pcDNA3.1 construct as template and the huACE2-5 as 5 0 -oligonucleotide in combination with either ACE2-771 (5 0 -GAGCTCGAGTTATTCTCCTTTGCTAATATCGATGG-3 0 ), ACE2-775 (5 0 -GAGCTCGAGTTAAGGATTTTCTCCACTTCT TGC-3 0 ), ACE2-779 (5 0 -CAGCTCGAGTCTTGCTTTATTTTTCTT CTTCCG-3 0 ) or ACE2-790 (5 0 -CAGCTCGAGTTATTTCTTCTTCC GATCTCTGATCC-3 0 ) and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector via KpnI and XhoI. To obtain an expression plasmid encoding soluble ACE2, the huACE2 cDNA was amplified using the huACE2-5 0 primer in combination with oligonucleotide ACE2sol-3 (5 0 -GGGCTCGAGT TAGGAAACAGGGGGCTGGTTAGGAG-3 0 ) followed by insertion into pcDNA3.1 via KpnI and XhoI. Cell culture, infection, and reporter assays. The lymphatic cell lines C8166 and BL41 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 293T, Vero E6, HOS, Hep-2, and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Gibco/ BRL, Eggenstein, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum; Huh-7 cells additionally received 1% amino acid cocktail (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). HIV-based pseudotypes were produced as described [9] . Briefly, the pNL4-3env*nef*-luc plasmid [20] was co-expressed in 293T cells together with an expression vector for the SARS-S protein or control envelope proteins (VSV-G, MLV). The supernatant was used for infection of target cells followed by determination of luciferase activity 72 h post infection using a commercially available kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Antibodies, Western blotting, and FACS analysis. 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding ACE2 and ACE2 deletion variants. After 48 h, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% NP40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.3, 0.15 M NaCl, and 150 mM PMSF) and separated by 10% PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). ACE2-proteins were detected using a monoclonal ACE2 antibody (R&D systems, Minneapolis). For FACS analysis, surface expression of ACE2 on transfected 293T cells was detected using a polyclonal ACE2 antibody (R&D systems, Minneapolis) in combination with a FITC-labeled secondary antibody. Inhibition of S-mediated entry into target cells by soluble ACE2. Soluble ACE2 protein was harvested from the supernatant of transiently transfected 293T cells followed by concentration of the protein using a CentriconPlus ultrafilter with a 30 kDa molecular weight cut-off (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). For inhibition of S-mediated infection, S-or control pseudotypes standardized for equal luciferase activity upon infection of target cells were pre-incubated with different dilutions of soluble ACE2 for 1 h at 37°C followed by infection of 293T target cells. Luciferase activity was determined in cell extracts after 72 h.
