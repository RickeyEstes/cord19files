DNA sequencing. Patience was isolated using standard methods as described previously (7, 30) , and the genome was sequenced using 454 technology at the University of Pittsburgh's Genomics and Proteomics Core Laboratories; a total of~45,000 reads were assembled to yield an average (34) , and Phamerator (35) . The Phamerator database used for genomic comparisons was Mycobacteriophage_285. Phams were built using BLASTP and/or ClustalW, with similarity cutoff E values of 10 Ϫ50 and 32.5% similarity or better as described elsewhere (35) . Codon usage and codon selection. Codon usage resulting from mutational biases was estimated using the collection of all genes from a genome. The fraction (f) of each codon for a given amino acid was calculated as the ratio of the codon count to the amino acid count. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) normalizes codon frequencies so that the sum of RSCU for codons of each amino acid is equal to the number of synonymous codons for that amino acid. To measure codon selection, a second codon usage table (f o ) was tabulated, limited to genes experiencing strong codon selection. For bacterial genomes, this table was constructed from homologues of Sharp's set of 40 genes whose products participate in translation (36) . For Patience, this table was constructed in three steps. First, a codon usage table was generated from 20% of the genome using the genes with the most extreme value of codon usage bias as determined by 2 (where expected codon usage is calculated from the nucleotide composition). Next, adaptive codon enrichment (ACE u ) values (25) are calculated for all genes as described previously (25) , using this table to represent codon frequencies under codon selection (f o ) and the frequencies of codons among all genes in the Patience genome to represent codon frequencies expected from mutational processes alone (f N (34) , and Phamerator (35) . Electron microscopy. CsCl gradient-purified Patience particles were applied to glow-discharged Formvar-and carbon-coated copper grids (400 mesh) (Ted Pella). They were stained with 1% uranyl acetate and imaged with a Morgagni 268 transmission electron microscope fitted with a Hamamatsu Orca HR side-model digital camera and AMT540 software. SDS-PAGE. Patience particles were concentrated and purified via CsCl gradient and ultracentrifugation. The visible phage band was dialyzed against two changes of phage buffer; 500 l of the dialyzed CsCl band was pelleted by a 30-min spin at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in 75 l of 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and then 2 l of 0.5 M EDTA and 1 l of 1 M MgSO 4 were added. The phage was disrupted by being heated to 75°C for 2 min and then sonicated on ice six times for 30 s to disrupt the DNA. The sample was then mixed with 25 l of 4ϫ SDS sample buffer and heated in a boiling bath for 3 min at 95°C. The sample was electrophoresed through a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue in methanol. HPLC-MS/MS. Five milliliters of exponentially growing M. smegmatis mc 2 155 (optical density at 600 nm [OD 600 ] of 0.4) in 7H9-ADC medium (30) was concentrated to a 500-l volume via low-speed centrifugation and infected with Patience at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100. Phage particles were allowed to adsorb for 15 min, and then 4.5 ml of fresh 7H9 medium was added to the culture and incubated with shaking for 3 h at 37°C; the OD 600 was monitored throughout to follow cell growth and lysis. At 30 min and 150 min postadsorption, a 1-ml aliquot was removed from the culture, the cells were pelleted via centrifugation (1 min, 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge), and the supernatant was removed. The cell pellet was frozen at Ϫ80°C and then shipped overnight on wet ice to the University of California, Davis Proteomics Core (UCDPC) (http://proteomics.ucdavis.edu). There, the cells were lysed via a MagNA Lyser, the insoluble fraction was removed, and the soluble proteins were precipitated, digested with trypsin, and cleaned up using a MacroSpin column. The peptides were then separated using an Easy-LC II high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system and loaded into a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer with a Proxeon nanospray source (Thermo) for tandem MS analysis. Detected spectra and fragmentation profiles were matched against a database comprised of a six-frame translation of the Patience genome, the annotated proteins of M. smegmatis mc 2 155, and UniProt using X! Tandem. Peptide matches were analyzed using Scaf-fold4. The "Relaxed" settings (as reported in Table S1 in the supplemental material) used a peptide false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% and a protein FDR of 5%; the "Stringent" settings used a peptide FDR of 0.1% and a protein FDR of 0.6%. Estimation of relative protein abundance was determined by normalizing the total number of spectra detected to the gene size.
