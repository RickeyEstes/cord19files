This was a pre-post comparison study. The study was based in part on data from NHIRD provided by BNHI, Department of Health and managed by the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI). The database contains the registration files and original claims data for reimbursement. The NHIRD is provided to scientists in Taiwan for research purposes. Each year, the BNHI collects data from the NHI program and sorts it into data files. These data files are de-identified by scrambling the identification codes of both patients and medical facilities and then sent to NHRI to form the original files contained in the NHIRD. [32] Based on the registration files and original claims data in the NHIRD, specific data subsets can be re-constructed for research purposes. The registration datasets, systemic sampling inpatient expenditures by admissions (DD file) and systemic sampling ambulatory care expenditures by visits (CD file) were used in this study. The interpretation and conclusions contained herein do not represent those of BNHI, the Department of Health, or NHRI. [32] 2.1. Systemic sampling CD and DD files 0.2% of the ambulatory care expenditures, by visit, CD file extracted by systematic sampling method on a monthly basis, together with the related records in details of ambulatory care orders form the Systematic Sampling CD file. 5% of the inpatient expenditures, by admission, DD file extracted by systematic sampling method on a monthly basis, together with the related records in details of inpatient orders form the Systematic Sampling DD file. [32] A total of one million cases of systemic sampling dataset were used in this study. Taiwan . It has been reported that SARS had an impact on health care utilization. [33] Therefore, data from 2003 was not used in this study.
