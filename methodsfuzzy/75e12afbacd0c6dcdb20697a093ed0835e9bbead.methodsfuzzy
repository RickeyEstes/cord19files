The original approach, developed in the 1980s, was an infusion of clodronate-encapsulated liposomes, which are toxic to macrophages (65) . Since liposomes are not capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier, intracranial or intraventricular administration is necessary to deplete microglia (66, 67) . However, even under these circumstances, depletion is incomplete. Various genetic methods were subsequently developed that permitted more efficient targeting of microglia (63), however these have not been used in encephalitis models. By contrast, blockade of CSF1R signaling has been more widely adopted. As alluded to above, microglia are dependent on signaling through the CSF1R for development and survival (33, 44, 51, 53) . Csf1r −/− mice lack microglia as well as all tissue macrophage populations (44, 53) . However, these mice also exhibit profound developmental defects and significant perinatal mortality, making them unsuitable for studies of encephalitis. The ligands for CSF1R are CSF1 and IL34. Deletion of either does not lead to complete loss of microglia in the brain, reflecting a degree of redundancy (63) . Il34 LacZ/LacZ reporter mice (which are effectively IL34 deficient) have been used in a limited number of studies of viral encephalitis (68, 69) . Blockade of CSF1R [e.g., with the small molecules such as PLX5622 (70, 71) ] efficiently depletes microglia from the brain of intact rodents (72) and has been more frequently employed, presumably due to its technical ease. Collectively, the results of these studies provide a coherent set of data that supports a protective role for microglia in the acute phase of viral encephalitis (Figure 1 ).
