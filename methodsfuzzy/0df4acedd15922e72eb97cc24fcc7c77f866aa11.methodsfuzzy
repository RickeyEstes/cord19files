Cloning, expression, and purification of SCoV-N protein. The full-length SARS-CoV nucleocapsid cDNA was amplified by PCR from the SARS-CoV genomic library (CUHK-W1) and cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of pAC28m vector which places a His 6 -tag at the N terminus of the protein. Expression of the N protein was induced by adding 0.1 mM IPTG for 6 h at 25°C in Escherichia coli strain B834. Bacterial cells were lysed by sonication and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Nucleocapsid proteins in soluble fraction were purified using a combination of Ni-NTA agarose chromatography (Qiagen) and S-200 size exclusion chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). SARS-CoV-infected vero E6 cell lysate. Vero cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Gibco) at 37°C with 5% CO 2 in a humidified incubator. The Vero cells were infected with a SARS-CoV strain (CUHK-W1) for 16-48 h, and the cells were lysed in a Hepes buffer (10 mM; pH 7.0) supplemented with 40 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 5% glycerol, 0.2% NP40, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 1· protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). After removing cell debris by centrifugation, the virus-infected cell lysate was heated for 30 min at 55°C to inactivate any live virus. The heat-inactivated cell lysate was then kept at À70°C until use. ScFv library construction and biopanning. ScFv antibodies were prepared as described previously [18] . The NotI-and SfiI-restricted scFv antibodies were then cloned into pCANTAB 5E phagemid vector (Amersham). Library was constructed by chemical transformation using competent TG1 E. coli. Subsequently, log-phase TG1 transformants were superinfected with M13KO7 helper phage (Amersham) in a multiplicity of infection (moi) ratio of 3:1. Pool of scFv-phages produced in overnight culture was purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation (20% PEG8000 and 2.5 M NaCl). Purified phages were resuspended in 4 ml of a pre-blocking buffer (1· PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.01% NaN 3 , 0.1% BSA, and 10% non-fat milk) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before panning process. Phages (0.5 ml/well) were panned against immobilized antigen in a 24-well plate of which each well was pre-coated with 7.5 lg of recombinant N protein in 0.5 ml of carbonate coating buffer overnight at 4°C. After incubation at room temperature for 2 h with gentle shaking, bound scFv-phages were eluted with 100 ll of 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.2. After 10 min acid incubation at room temperature, the eluant was neutralized with 10 ll of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Specificity of eluted phage clones was confirmed by phage-ELISA. Phage-ELISA. Phage-ELISA was carried out in a 96-well ELISA plate, and each well was coated with 50 ll of a carbonate coating buffer, pH 9.6, containing 2 lg of recombinant N protein overnight at 4°C. After incubation with 100 ll scFv-phages at 37°C for 1 h, bound phages were detected by incubation with 100 ll of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 mouse antibody (Amersham) at 37°C for 1 h. Activity of horseradish peroxidase was measured by a colorimetric method with o-phenylenediamine/H 2 O 2 as substrates. Color was allowed to develop for 1 h at room temperature, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a lQuant micro-plate reader (Bio-Tek). Nucleotide sequence analysis. Nucleotide sequence determinations were performed by dye-terminator cycle sequencing using Beckman CEQ DTCS Kit as recommended by the manufacturer. Sequencing products were separated by capillary gel-electrophoresis and the nucleotide sequence was read by Beckman CEQ2000 sequencer (Beckman Coulter). Sequences obtained were compared with NCBI IgBLAST, and multiple sequence alignment was performed by ClustalW from EMBL-EBI server with the following default conditions: matrix, BLOSUM; gap opening penalty, 10.0; gap extension penalty, 0.05; gap separation penalty, 8; maxdiv, default; no end gap separation penalty. Alignment in the CDR3 was further adjusted manually in accordance with the physical property of amino acid residues. Western blot analysis of STAT 3 phosphorylation. IEC-18 cells (ATCC CRL-1589) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 0.1 U/ml bovine insulin (Sigma) at 37°C with 5% CO 2 in a humidified incubator. For STAT 3 phosphorylation analysis, the IEC-18 cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates. The cells were then serumstarved by reducing FCS supplement to 0.5% for 24 h followed by to 0.01% for 12 h. The cells were then exposed to 5 nM IL-11 (PeproTech EC) for 60 min at 37°C in the absence or presence of various individual anti-N scFv clones (9 · 10 10 cfu) in a final volume of 100 ll. The cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl; pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 1· protease inhibitor cocktail), boiled for 10 min, and then stored at À20°C until use. Proteins of cell lysate (50 mg) were separated in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and then electro-transfer to a nitrocellulose paper. The protein blot was probed with a 1000-fold diluted mouse monoclonal anti-phospho STAT 3 (Tyr 705) antibody (Cell Signalling) together with a 10,000-fold diluted mouse monoclonal anti-b actin antibody (Sigma) for 16-18 h at room temperature in an immunoblotting buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl; pH 7.4, 0.02% NaN 3 , 80 mM NaCl, 20 mM CaCl 2 , and 5% skimmed milk powder). After incubating with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody (2000-fold diluted, Zymed) for 2 h at room temperature, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by incubating with NBT/BCIP as suggested by the manufacturer (Boehringer-Mannheim).
