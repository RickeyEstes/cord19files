All dairy farms in the Orne department (Normandy, Western France) were included in the study. A bulk tank milk sample was taken during a routine milk collection from the dairy cooperatives on 3 All samples arrived at the laboratory between 24 and 72 h after collection from the farms. During all handling procedures the samples were constantly stored at 4 • C. Bulk tank milk samples from each farm were tested with an indirect ELISA using a crude O. ostertagi antigen (SVANOVIR ® O. ostertagi-Ab ELISA Kit).
