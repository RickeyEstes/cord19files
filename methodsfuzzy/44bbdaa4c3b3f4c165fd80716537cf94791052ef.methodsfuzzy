Construction of recombinant plasmids. SARS-CoV RNA was provided by Department of Medical Technology, China Medical University Hospital. SARS-CoV S gene was kindly provided by Dr. P.J. Chen. Briefly, the RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SARS-M2 primer (5 0 -GGAATTCGCCAAACATACCAAGGCC-3 0 ) and Super-Script III (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The 3580-bp DNA fragment was then amplified from the cDNA template by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using PfuUlter DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with SARS-P1 primer (5 0 -CGGGATCCTAGTGGTAGT GACCTTGACC-3 0 ) and SARS-M2 primer. The PCR profile was as follows: one cycle at 95°C for 2 min; 30 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min. The amplified S cDNA fragments were cleaved by EcoRI and BamHI, and the 3580-bp fragments were then inserted into pET-28b(+) (Novagen) to create the pET-spike expression plasmid. DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed on doublestranded plasmids by dideoxy chain termination with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed by ABP Prism 310 (Applied Biosystems). Dimethyl sulfoxide was introduced to the reaction to a final concentration of 5% to diminish the secondary structure. The primer used in the sequencing reaction was T7, SARS-P2 (5 0 -CGGGATCCTAATTACACCTGGAACAAATGC-3 0 ), T7 terminator, SARS-M2, SARS-M3 (5 0 -TTGATATAGAACAGC AACTTCAGATGAAGC-3 0 ), or SARS-M1 (5 0 -GGAATTCCACTTA CACCCCCAAAAGAGC-3 0 ). DNA was sequenced on both strands of at least two repeats of cloned DNA fragments. Expression and purification of recombinant SARS-CoV S protein. Recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain by transforming the pET-spike to produce an N-terminal fusion with six histidine residues. The expression and purification of recombinant S protein were performed as described previously with modification [18] . Briefly, cells were grown in 100 ml Luria-Bertani broth agitated at 37°C until OD 600 reached 0.6. Isopropyl-b-D D -thiogalactoside (IPTG) was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and the cells were pelleted 2 h after induction. The cell pellet was washed twice with icecold binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole) and resuspended in 5 ml ice-cold binding buffer containing 8 M urea. The resuspended pellet was incubated at 4°C with shaking for 2 h. After sonication, the suspension was centrifuged at 16,000g for 30 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was applied on nickel-affinity chromatography with 8 M urea present throughout the procedure. The protein in the final column eluate was dialyzed overnight against phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 1.4 mM KH 2 PO 4 ) and stored at )70°C until further analysis. Protein was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and was quantified with a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Cells and cell extracts. Human lung carcinoma cell (A-549), human liver cell (Chang liver), African green monkey kidney cells (Vero E6, Vero), and human monocyte (U-397) were purchased from Bioresources Collection and Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in air. The cell extracts were prepared by washing the cells once with ice-cold PBS and lysing the cells by lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 20 lM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a 30-min-incubation on ice, the cell lysate was collected by centrifugation. Protein was quantified with a Bradford assay and stored at )30°C until further analysis. Biotinylation of recombinant S protein. Recombinant S protein was mixed with Sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in a ratio of ten to one. After a 2-h-incubation on ice, the unincorporated biotin was removed by centricon-10 (Amicon) and the biotinylated S protein was stored at 4°C until further analysis. Sulfo-NHS-biotin should be prepared freshly by dissolving in DDW. Western blot analysis. Proteins (5 lg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and the protein bands were then transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membrane was blocked in blocking buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% skim milk) and probed with rabbit anti-spike (residue 511-993) polyclonal antibody or human anti-SARS sera at room temperature for 1 h. The bound antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) followed by chemiluminescence (ECL system, Amersham) and exposed by X-ray films. Rabbit anti-spike (residue 511-993) polyclonal antibody was prepared by immunizing rabbit with truncated spike and was provided kindly by Dr. P.J. Chen. Human anti-SARS sera were collected from SARS patients and provided by Dr. L.K. Chen. For biotinylated Western blot, cell extracts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and the protein bands were then transferred to membrane. After blocking, the membrane was probed with 0.1 lg/ml biotinylated S protein at 4°C for 1 h. The bound protein was detected with peroxidase-conjugated avidin (Sigma) followed by chemiluminescence and exposed by X-ray films. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated at 4°C overnight with 50 ll of 10 ng/ll proteins, which was diluted in 0.05 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6). The wells were rinsed with 200 ll washing buffer (0.5% Tween 20 in PBS) and blocked with 200 ll blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in washing buffer) by incubating at 37°C for 30 min. The absorbed protein in each well was challenged with 50 ll diluted human anti-SARS sera and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After three washes with washing buffer, 50 ll diluted peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Following three washes, 50 ll chromogenic substrate, 2,2 0 -azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazo-line-sulfonic acid), was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. The absorbance was read at 405 nm in an ELISA plate reader. For biotinylated ELISA, the procedure was performed as described previously with modification. Briefly, microtiter plates were coated with 5 lg/well cell extract which was diluted in 0.05 M carbonate buffer, blocked with blocking buffer, and challenged with 0.1 lg/well biotinylated S protein. After a 1-h incubation at 37°C, diluted peroxidase-conjugated avidin was added and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Following three washes, chromogenic substrate was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. The absorbance was read at 405 nm in an ELISA plate reader.
