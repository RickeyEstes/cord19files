Prediction of epitopes on spike protein. Spike protein sequence is deduced from SARS-CoV genome of strain BJ01 (GenBank Accession No. AY278488). Computerized algorithms were used to predict the hydrophilicity [10] , surface probability [11] , antigenic index [12] , and secondary structure [13] . These analyses were performed with the biocomputing software program Laser gene-DNASTAR. According to the hydrophilicity, surface probability, antigenic index, and secondary structure, six segments (designated as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6) that possibly contain B-cell epitope were selected (Fig. 1) . Construction of a multi-epitope gene. A chimeric gene containing S1-S6 was constructed by lining up the six segments. The sequence of chimeric gene is as follows: ctgggatccaatactaggaacattgatgctacttcaactgg taattataatggaccgggaaagcttaggccctttgagagagacatatctaatgtgggaccgggag attccgttcgagatcctaaaacatctgaaatattaggaccgggagctgaacaggatcgcaacaca cgtgaagtgttcggaccgggacctgaccctctaaagccaactaagaggtcttttggaccgggaaa aaatcatacatcaccagatgttgatcttggcgacatttcactcgagcgg. Between segments there is a Gly-Pro-Gly encoding sequence (in italic) predicted to enhance the visability of each possible epitope. A BamHI site and XhoI site (in bold) were added to the 5 0 and 3 0 ends, respectively. And three extra protective nucleotides were then added to both ends. The chimeric gene was synthesized by TaKaRa Biotechnology (Dalian, China). Expression of synthesized epitopes. The chimeric gene was inserted into the cloning sites (BamHI and XhoI) of the expression vector pGEX-6p-1 (Invitrogen). The inserts in three recombinant plasmids were sequenced. The confirmed recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21. And the expressed chimeric peptide with a GST tag was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B RediPack Column affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech). And the bound fusion protein was eluted with glutathione elution buffer (10 mM reduced glutathione, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for further analysis. The six segments and sub-segments derived from S2 and S5 (Table 1 ) were separately synthesized and cloned into pGEX-6p-1. The recombinant plasmids harboring the individual segment were transformed into E. coli BL21. The expressed fusion peptides were used for immune reactivity analysis by ELISA and Western blotting. Development of monoclonal antibody (McAb). Female, 4-to 6week-old, BALB/c mice were purchased from Experimental Animal Center of Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Mice were immunized with 250 lg fusion protein in 0.5 ml emulsion with complete Freund's adjuvant. Two booster injections with the same dose of emulsion each as the first immunization were given at 2-week intervals. One day after the last injection, the spleens were surgically removed from the mice. Splenocytes were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells and washed twice with DMEM. Fused cells were then mixed in a 15 ml conical tube and 1 ml of 50% (v/v) PEG was added over 1 min with gentle stirring. The mixture was then centrifuged at 400g for 5 min.
