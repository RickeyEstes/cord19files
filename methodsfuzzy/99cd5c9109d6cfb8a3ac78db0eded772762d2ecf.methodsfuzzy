All facilities and management procedures used in this experiment were approved by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. This experiment was conducted over 3 yr at the Eastern Nebraska Research and Extension Center (ENREC) near Mead, Nebraska, and 2 yr at the Panhandle Research and Extension Center (PREC) at Scottsbluff, Nebraska, due to snow cover that negated stalk grazing in western Nebraska the first year. Lactating, composite (Red Angus × Red Poll × Tarentaise × South Devon × Devon) beef cows (n = 127 at ENREC; n = 56 at PREC) with summer-born calves were used in a randomized complete block design with 2 treatments. In yr 1, cow-calf pairs were blocked by cow BW in 4 blocks at ENREC, stratified by calf age, and assigned randomly within strata to 1 of 2 winter cow-calf production treatments with 4 replications (pens or paddocks) per treatment per year. In yr 2, cow-calf pairs were also blocked by cow BW in 2 blocks at PREC, stratified by calf age, and assigned randomly within strata to 1 of 2 winter cow-calf production treatments with 2 replications per treatment per year. Treatments were (1) dry-lot feeding (DL) or (2) cornstalk grazing (CS). In the subsequent years, cows within location were assigned to the same treatments as were assigned in yr 1. To maintain herd size, cows culled between years were replaced with pregnant, multiparous cows sourced from the same supplier and herd of the original cows. Before the beginning of the experiment, cows within location were managed in a common feedlot pen and limit fed a distillers grain and wheat straw or cornstalk-based diet from mid-April to mid-November each year. Approximately 1 mo before calving, cows were vaccinated against bovine rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens type C (ScourGuard 4KC, Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ). Cows calved in a feedlot pen during the summer with mean calving dates of July 14 (ENREC) and July 15 (PREC). Following parturition, calf birth date, weight, and sex were recorded and bull calves were band castrated. At approximately 30 d of age, calves were vaccinated for the prevention of blackleg caused by Clostridium chauvoei, malignant edema caused by Clostridium septicum, black disease caused by Clostridium novyi, gas-gangrene caused by Clostridium sordellii, enterotoxemia and enteritis caused by Clostridium perfringens (types B, C, and D), and disease caused by Histophilus somni (Ultrabac 7, Zoetis) and were vaccinated against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine viral diarrhea (types 1 and 2), parainfluenza-3, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, and Mannheimia haemo-lytica type A1 (Bovi-Shield Gold One Shot, Zoetis). All calves were revaccinated at 70 d of age with Bovi-Shield Gold One Shot and Ultrabac 7. At approximately 210 d of age, all calves were revaccinated against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine viral diarrhea (types 1 and 2), parainfluenza-3, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (Bovi-Shield Gold 5, Zoetis). The trial was initiated at the beginning of cornstalk grazing on approximately November 11 and November 22 for ENREC and PREC, respectively (yr 1: November 6 at ENREC; yr 2: November 11 at ENREC and December 4 at PREC; yr 3: November 15 at ENREC and November 11 at PREC). Cow-calf pairs assigned to the DL treatment remained in dry-lot pens (279 m 2 ). Each pen housed 6 or 7 pairs allotting each pair 40 to 46 m 2 . The natural terrain around the pens provided some wind protection at PREC, and stacked hay bales were used to provide a windbreak at ENREC where natural terrain was not sufficient. Dry-lot pairs within location were program fed a limit-fed diet (Table 1 ) formulated to meet energy requirements for a lactating cow in early gestation based on the NRC model (NASEM, 2016) . Feed was delivered as a TMR once daily in concrete fence-line feed bunks (0.9 m of linear space per cow-calf pair). Dry matter offered increased by 0.45 kg monthly throughout the experiment to account for increasing intake of the growing calves. In yr 1 and 2, the amount of DM offered ranged from 11.6 to 13.4 kg/d. During yr 1 and 2, cows fed in the dry-lot were gaining BW and BCS and were not at maintenance. To correct for the BW and BCS gain, the amount of DM offered to cows in the dry-lot was reduced to a range of 11.1 to 12.9 kg/d during yr 3. Within location, cow-calf pairs assigned to the CS treatment were hauled to a harvested irrigated cornfield within 8 km of the confinement facility. Stocking rate for cow-calf pairs grazing corn residue was calculated using estimated daily residue intake (range of 12.7 to 14.5 kg of DM/d) for the cow-calf pair (Meyer et al., 2012 throughout the grazing period and assuming 3.6 kg (DM) of husk and leaf residue were available for consumption per 25.5 kg of corn grain yield (Watson et al., 2015) . The amount of supplement needed to meet the energy requirements of a cow-calf pair grazing corn residue was calculated using estimated residue intake of a pair (Meyer et al., 2012) and estimated digestibility values of corn residue throughout the grazing period (Wilson et al., 2004) . Cow-calf pairs grazing corn residue were supplemented daily in bunks (0.9 m of linear space per pair) with dried distillers grain-based cubes (Table 2 ) at a rate of approximately 2.4 kg (range of 1.7 to 3.2 kg) of DM per pair daily, increasing monthly to account for increased calf requirement and intake. The amount supplemented was initially targeted to provide an equivalent energy intake to that of the dry-lot pairs. However, in yr 3, supplementation to cows on cornstalks was held constant while the DM offered to cows in the dry-lot was reduced. If snow cover prevented grazing, additional supplemental feed was fed to grazing pairs. In yr 2, approximately 77 kg (DM) of ammoniated cornstalks were fed per pair at ENREC. The trial was completed when winter cornstalk grazing ended on approximately April 10 and April 9 for ENREC and PREC, respectively (yr 1: April 13 at ENREC; yr 2: April 12 at ENREC and April 14 at PREC; yr 3: April 8 at ENREC and April 4 at PREC). The completion of the cornstalk grazing period coincided with weaning of all calves. Cow BW and calf BW were recorded over 2 consecutive days at trial initiation and completion to determine changes in BW from November to April. A trained technician at each location evaluated BCS (Wagner et al., 1988 ; 1 = emaciated; 9 = obese) of cows at trial initiation and completion. Before being weighed at trial initiation, all cow-calf pairs on both treatments were limit fed a common diet for a minimum of 5 consecutive days to reduce weight variation due to gastrointestinal tract fill (Watson et al., 2013) . At trial completion, cows and calves were separated and again limit fed a common diet in the feedlot, to ensure gut fill was similar for both treatments, for a minimum of 5 d before being weighed. Cattle were weighed in the morning on 2 consecutive days before feeding (water not withheld), and those 2 weights were averaged to achieve an initial and final BW, respectively. Cows were exposed to Simmental × Angus bulls (1 bull:10 cows on average because 2 bulls were assigned to each paddock after trial initiation) beginning approximately September 25 and September 26 each year with a 73-and 74-d breeding season at ENREC and PREC, respectively. Cows received prebreeding vaccinations for protection against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine viral diarrhea (types 1 and 2), parainfluenza-3, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (Bovi-Shield Gold FP5 In vitro analysis of corn residue collected from each location was conducted to determine residue quality. Within location, fields were divided into 6 replications for sampling. This was done before harvest before the field was divided into paddocks for grazing. Ten consecutive whole corn plant samples harvested above the anchor root were collected from the 6 sampling sites just before grain harvest. Plant samples were separated into individual plant components (husk, leaf blade, and leaf sheath). Plant components were then composited within replication and ground through a 1-mm screen using a Wiley Mill (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ). Each location was analyzed separately. Composite samples were then analyzed for in vitro OM digestibility in 2 runs using the Tilley and Terry (1963) method modified by the inclusion of 1 g of urea/ mL of buffer (Weiss, 1994) . A set of forage (grass and corn residue) standards with established in vivo values were included in each run to develop regression equations that allowed for the comparison between runs (Geisert, 2007) . Triplicate samples from each plant fraction and standard were weighed into 100-mL in vitro tubes. Rumen fluid was collected from 2 donor steers fed a 30% concentrate diet. McDougall's buffer was mixed with rumen fluid to form inoculum, which was added to each tube. In vitro tubes were then incubated in a 39°C water bath for 48 h and swirled every 12 h. Following 48 h of incubation, fermentation was ceased by adding 5 mL of 20% hydrochloric acid and 3 mL of 5% pepsin to each tube. Tubes remained in the water bath for an additional 24 h and were then frozen immediately following removal. Contents from each tube were filtered through Whatman 541 filter paper, rinsed with distilled water, and dried in a 100°C oven for 12 h to determine DM. Filters were then placed in a muffle furnace at 600°C for 6 h to determine ash and OM (AOAC International, 1999; method 4.1.10). Digestible organic matter (DOM) was calculated by multiplying the in vitro OM digestibility and percent OM of the original residue sample.
