Viruses. LCMV, strain Armstrong, and its highly disseminating variant, clone 13, are ambisense RNA viruses in the arenavirus family and were propagated in BHK21 baby hamster kidney cells (32, 33) . VV, strain WR, a DNA virus in the poxvirus family, was propagated in NCTC 929 cells (32) . PV, strain AN3739, a New World arenavirus only distantly related to LCMV, was propagated in BHK21 cells (33) . CFSE labeling. Leukocytes from donor mice were harvested and isolated as described previously (1) . The donor leukocytes were labeled with CFSE using a modification of previously described techniques (35, 36) . In brief, the splenocytes were suspended in HBBS (GIBCO BRL) at 2.5 ϫ 10 7 cells/ml and incubated in 2 M CFSE (Molecular Probes) solution for 15 min at 37ЊC. After incubation, donor cells were washed twice with HBSS. Flow cytometry and intracellular IFN-␥ staining. Single cell lymphocyte suspensions were prepared from peripheral blood and spleens. The erythrocytes were lysed using a 0.84% NH 4 Cl solution. LCMV peptidespecific, IFN-␥-secreting CD8 ϩ T cells were detected using the Cytofix/ Cytoperm Kit Plus (with GolgiPlug; BD Biosciences) as described previously (37) . In brief, cells were incubated with 5 M of synthetic peptide, 10 U/ml of human recombinant IL-2 (BD Biosciences), and 0.2 l GolgiPlug for 5 h at 37ЊC. After preincubation with 1 l of Fc block (2.4 G2) in 96well plates containing 100 l of FACS buffer (HBBS, 2% FCS, 0.1% NaN 3 ), the cells were stained for 30 min at 4ЊC with combinations of fluorescently labeled mAbs specific for IL-7R (CD127, A7R34 biotin), CD44 (IM7, FITC), CD8␣ (53-6.7 per CP) and, after cells were permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm, stained with mAb to IFN-␥ (XMG1.2, allophycocyanin), all purchased from BD Biosciences except for Ab specific for IL-7R␣, which was purchased from eBioscience. For the staining of donor cells in adoptive transfer experiments, mAb specific for Thy1.1 (OX-7, PE) was additionally included. Freshly stained samples were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur and CELLQuest software. Synthetic peptides. Several previously defined T cell epitopes encoded by LCMV were used in this study (38, 39) . LCMV-specific epitopes include NP396-404 (FQPQNGQFI), GP33-41 (KAVYNFATC), GP276-286 (SGVENPGGYCL), NP205-212 (YTVKYPNL), and GP118-125 (ISHN-FCNL). We identified one VV-specific K b -restricted epitope from VV protein A11R 198-205 (AIVNYANL). Synthetic peptides listed here were purchased from American Peptide and were purified with reverse phase-HPLC to 90% purity. CDR3 length spectratyping analysis and sequencing. CDR3 length "spectratype" analysis was performed as described previously with modification (16, 40) . RNA samples were isolated from 5,000-60,000 MHC dimer-or MHC-tetramer-sorted epitope-specific CD8 T cells or from an NP205specific cell line derived from an LCMV-immune mouse. For NP396-404and GP33-41-specific cells, RNA samples were amplified with primers for C␤ and for V␤8.1, using a GeneAmp RNA kit (PerkinElmer). The PCR products were subjected to five cycles of runoff reaction with six fluorophorelabeled J␤ primers (J␤ 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, and 2.1) . The runoff products were mixed with gel-loading buffer (five parts of 100% formamide and one part of 2.5% blue dextran/50 M EDTA), loaded onto a 4.75% acrylamide sequencing gel, and analyzed on an automated DNA sequencer using Gene-Scan software (Applied Biosystems). For NP205-specific T cells, TCR V␤ analysis was performed by a qualitative PCR with specific primers for V␤ 1-18. The dominant V␤16 PCR products were subcloned and sequenced across the CDR3 region according to the method of Naumov et al. (11) . Dual tetramer staining of T cell culture. 10 7 splenocytes from LCMV-immune mice were cocultured with VV A11R 198 peptide-pulsed 10 6 RMA-S cells in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin G, 100 g/ml streptomycin sulfate, 2 M L-glutamine, 10 M Hepes, 1 M sodium pyruvate, 0.1 M MEM nonessential amino acids, 0.05 M ␤-mercaptoethanol, and 10% FBS for 5 d at 37ЊC at 5% CO 2 . The IL-2 culture supplement BD T-Stim (BD Biosciences) was added after 5 d of culture. After 10 d of stimulation, T cell lines were analyzed by tetramer staining. Cells were incubated in FACS buffer with streptavidin and Fc block to prevent nonspecific binding, washed, and stained with phycoerythrin-and/or allophycocyanin-labeled tetramers for 60 min. After 40 min of tetramer incubation, PerCP anti-mouse CD8␣ was added. Thereafter, cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and fixed in Cytofix (BD Biosciences). All staining was performed on ice. Samples were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). MHC class I K b tetramers specific for VV A11R 198 and LCMV GP118 were generated as described previously (41) .
