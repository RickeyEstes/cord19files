The genome annotation files of H. sapiens (build 35 version 1), yeast S. cerevisiae (updated February 6, 2006) , and A. thaliana (updated November 16, 2005) were downloaded from the NCBI genome database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/). In the case of alternative splicing variants, we retained the longest mRNA for analysis (although similar results were obtained by analyzing the shortest mRNA, data not shown). The data on mRNA stability were gathered from publication supplements, including the decay rates of human mRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 cells and primary fibroblast cell line Bud8 cells [16] , mRNA half-lives in human T lymphocytes stimulated with medium, human T lymphocytes stimulated with an anti-CD3 antibody, and human T lymphocytes stimulated with antibodies anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 [17] . The mRNAs with decay rate 60 h Ã€1 were excluded from our analyses. In assigning faster expressed genes and slower expressed genes and surveying motifs that regulate mRNA decay, we followed the methods/results of Yang et al. [16] . We use GNF GeneAtlas Version 2 [18] to determine human gene expression level. The data on mRNA half-life and gene expression levels of yeast S. cerevisiae strain Y262 [15] and yeast S. cerevisiae strain rpb1-1 [19] were collected from publication supplements deposited by the authors, http://web.wi.mit.edu/young/pub/holstege.html and http://genome-www.stanford.edu/turnover/data.shtml, respectively. Gutierrez et al. studied the mRNA stability of A. thaliana [14] . But they only provided the data of 100 genes with the most unstable transcripts (with half-life 6 60 min). So, these 100 genes were compared with other genes annotated in A. thaliana genome. The data were normalized by logarithmic transformation using 10 as the base in partial correlation analyses.
