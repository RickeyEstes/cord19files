A search of the available literature was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The keywords used were glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), deficiency, disease, exercise, muscle, antioxidant, vitamin, supplement, and supplementation. The search was limited to publications in English, conducted on humans, and published until August 2018. Then, the authors screened the abstracts of the identified articles to remove those that were obviously irrelevant. Studies that included exercise as a stimulus to generate perturbations on health, redox status, and performance indices were included.
