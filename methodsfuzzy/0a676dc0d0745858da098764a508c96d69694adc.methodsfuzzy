Photodegradation experiments were carried out in a 300 mL (56 mm i.d. × 130 mm H) quartz beaker with magnetic stirring, where 250 mL of the test solution was placed in the centric of the UV photoreactor, Rayonet TM RPR-200 (Southern New England Ultraviolet Co.). The reactor was equipped with two to six phosphor-coated low-pressure mercury lamps (approximately 35 W each), emitting 253.7 nm monochromatic UV at a light intensity of 1.5 × 10 −6 Einstein L −1 s −1 per lamp. Unless otherwise stated, reactions were carried out with 0.126 mM (∼100 mg L −1 ) iopromide and 2 mM KPS in blank solutions with the requisite amount of H 2 SO 4 or NaOH for the desired initial pH. To terminate the reaction, samples were mixed with an excess of sodium azide (1 mM) prior to the quantification of the probe compound and TOC. In general, the initial concentration ranges for iopromide (0.076-0.506 mM), KSP (0.4-20 mM) and the pH (2.6-11), were selected to monitor accurately the chemical reactions, ensure a reasonable reaction time (within 30-60 min), and examine a wide range of reaction kinetics for both academic and practical purposes. Analysis of iopromide concentration was performed by HPLC (Waters 515 HPLC pump), connected to a Waters 2487 dualwavelength absorbance detector. Chromatographic separation was carried out by a reverse phase column (5 m C 18 , 250 mm long × 4.66 mm i.d., Alltech Econosphere) with a 5% (v/v) acetonitrile (99.9% purity) mobile phase, adjusted to pH 2.8 with formic acid. The flow of the mobile phase was adjusted by HPLC pump (model 426, Alltech, IL) to 1 mL min −1 , and the UV detector wavelength was set at 238 nm. The chromatographic conditions provided a relatively long compound retention time (12-14 min) to ensure a satisfactory resolution of the two iopromide isomers. Solution TOC was determined using a Shimadzu TOC-5000A analyzer with an ASI-5000A autosampler. All experiments were carried out in an air-conditioned room temperature of 23 ± 2 • C.
