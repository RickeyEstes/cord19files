Female rats from two inbred strains, Fisher F344 (F344/NMol and F344/NHsd) and Brown Norway (BN/Mol and BN/SsNOlaHsd) as well as one outbred stock Wistar (Mol:WIST Han and HsdOla:WI) were supplied in equal numbers from both M&B AS (P.O Box 39, DK-8680, Ry, Denmark) and Harlan UK Ltd (Shaw's Farm, Blackthorn, Bicester, Oxon, OX60TP, England). The animals from both Week groups were acclimatized for 3 weeks at the following conditions before the experiment: Relative humidity (RH) 50-55%, temperature range of 19-21 C, and 12 h light cycle and were fed either SDS (Special Diets Services, UK), RM1 Maintenance Diet or B&K (B&K universal UK) Rodent Low Protein Diet and tap water ad libitum. Both diets have similar protein source i.e. extract of soya bean meal and whey powder. The respective unit percentage of the nutrients in the two different diets, for crude protein was 14.70% and 14.59%, respectively, and for digestible crude protein 13.30% vs 12.33%, respectively. A total of 48 rats were used and divided into two experimental weeks each with 24 rats. The two groups of animals forming the Week-groups, differed in arrival time by approximately 2 weeks and had an acclimatizing time of 3 weeks before the experiments took place. Three weeks of acclimatization has previously been observed as more than enough time to induce changes in P if : The animals were of approximately the same age (around 6 weeks, but varied in weight at the time of the experiments from 150 to 250 g. This variation is due to the fact that inbred strains are often smaller in size than outbred at the same age. The animals were kept isolated from other experimental animals, in separate rooms provided with four racks to separate the two food groups. Each rack contained 12 rats from the three different strains and each cage contained only two animals. An overview of the experimental design is presented in Table 1 . Although, we were not able to measure P if in two of the 48 rats (i.e. one Mol:WIST Han; B&K; Week1 and one F344/NHsd; B&K; Week2), the statistical analysis was not impaired by a reduction to 46 animals. The procedures were carried out with the approval of and in accordance with the regulations of the National Animal Research Authority. A factorial design was used, with all cross-classifications present. The statistical model was the following repeated measures ANOVA, using JMP (1) from SAS Institute (SAS Institute, 1993) : where Y 1 À Y 4 were the consecutive recordings of P if at 15 min intervals within an hour, FOOD were of two brands (i ¼ 2), SOURCE were two commercial breeders (j ¼ 2), STRAIN represented the two inbred strains and one single outbred (k ¼ 3), WEEK are the two consecutive weeks of repeated experiments (l ¼ 2) and e ijkl is the random error. The normality test was performed and passed prior to performing the main analysis. The analysis started with a full factorial resolution, then we only kept the significant interaction terms plus the main effects in the final model. The number of animals needed for the experiment was estimated according to Mead's resource equation (Mead, 1988) . We included sufficient animals to provide information on all two-way interactions, i.e. n ¼ 48: Results are presented as the least-squares means from (1), LS Mean7SEM
