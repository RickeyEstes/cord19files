Fifteen, 6-8-month-old, crossbred dogs, were used in this experiment. Before dogs were infected the feces of these animals were collected and searched for helminth's eggs and larvae. All the dogs were treated with anti-helminthic drug in two doses (nitroscanate, 50 mg/kg). Additional exams were performed from 7-day intervals to confirm that animals remained free of parasites. All of the dogs were immunized against parvovirus, coronavirus and distemper virus, in three doses at 1 month interval. The dogs were divided according to their weight in three groups of five animals. Groups A and B were inoculated, by oral route, with 50 and 100 infective larvae/kg of body weight, respectively. Group C was not inoculated and provided a control for the experiment. The third stage infective larvae (L 3 ) were obtained by experimental infection of aquatic snail, Biomphalaria glabrata, maintained in laboratory, with 400 larvae of first stage/snails. After 25 days after inoculation (dai), feces were collected daily and examined by Baermann method to determine the prepatent period. Samples of 10 ml of blood were obtained by atraumatic jugular venipuncture of each animal using vacutainer tubes. Blood samples were drawn before inoculation and on the 10, 20, 30 and 45 dai and thereafter 30-day intervals for the remainder of the 210-day experimental period. Five milliliters of the sample in EDTA were used to carry out the complete hemogram by the conventional technique of Dace and Lewis (1984) . Red and white blood cell counts were also processed in an automatic cell counter (CELM CC510). The remaining 5 ml of citrated whole blood, was centrifuged at 100g during 5 min to obtain the plasma rich in platelets (PRP) and, afterwards, at 500g for 10 min obtaining the plasma poor in platelets (PPP). The PPP was used for prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and of V and VIII clot factors measurements, while the PRP was used for platelet aggregation test in which adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was employed as an agonist. In the coagulation evaluation, PT and PTT were assessed by using calcic thromboplastin (Pacific HemosthasisR-ThromboScreenR) and cephalin containing celite as an activator (Biolab, Merieux), respectively, following the manufacturer's instructions. The ST4-Bio coagulometer (Stago, France) was used to read the results in seconds which were converted to percentage of activity by means of a standard calibration curve previously established. Factors V and VIII-deficient plasmas (Diamed, Brazil) were used measuring Factors V and VIII activities, following the manufacturer's instructions. The ST4-Bio coagulometer was used to read the results in seconds and the results were converted in percentage of activity a previously established standard calibration curve. All the parameters analyzed were submitted to analysis of variance by using the STA statistical pack and the means were compared by the Student's t-test. Differences were to be significant at p â‰¤ 0.05.
