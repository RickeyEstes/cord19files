An observational, prospective, longitudinal study was carried out from January to December 2006 within the University hospital attached dental care unit first aid facility. Monitoring was done without the knowledge of the dental healthcare personnel, which included professors, residents, and graduation students of the University of the Dentistry School. The groups were observed for hand cleaning before and after each clinical procedure that they executed during the workday. This study was not intended to assess the best way to clean their hands but to identify the preferred methods of Amorim-Finzi, Cury, Costa, Santos, Melo hand cleaning and its adherence by dental healthcare personnel. The treatment unit has four sinks for hand hygiene and four offices, each one with two dental care chairs outfitted with treatment equipment. The permanent staff is comprised of two professors and two residents (24-hour duty) and four to six graduation students (12-hour duty), all professionals undergoing shifts. The statistical analysis was performed by the software GraphPhad Prism 5.0. The tests applied were: Chi-square (X 2 ), Fisher's exact test for n<5, Mann-Whitney test, with 95% confidence interval, and ANOVA.
