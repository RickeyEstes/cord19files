Chicks: Day-old commercial broiler chicks were obtained from a commercial hatchery, and raised in the University of Liverpool isolation facilities. Chicks were reared on deep litter with water and feed provided ad libitum. No in-feed or in-water antibiotics were used throughout the study. All experimental procedures were conducted according to UK legislation on the use of animals for experiments, and were granted ethical approval by the University of Liverpool ethics committee. Vaccine strains: Commercially available live IBV Mass type strain H120 (Bioral, Boehringer Ingelheim, Lyon, France) and IBV variant 793B type strain CR88 (Gallivac Ò IB88, Boehringer Ingelheim, Lyon, France), NDV VG/GA-Avinew strain (Avinew Ò NeO, Boehringer Ingelheim, Lyon, France) and aMPV subtype B (Nemovac Ò , Boehringer Ingelheim, Lyon, France) vaccines were administered during this study. All vaccines were prepared prior to administration using sterile distilled water, to allow for 100 ml of vaccine per chick to be administered according to manufacturer's instructions [5, 19] . Challenge strains: Virulent virus strains of IBV (M41, 10 5.0 Ciliostatic Dose (CD) 50 /ml; QX, 10 6.0 CD 50 /ml) and aMPV (subtype B; 10 4.51 CD 50 /ml) were used for challenge. All challenge strains have been propagated in our laboratory and used in several previous studies [19, 23, 29] . PCR and bacterial culturing confirmed an absence of NDV, aMPV, avian influenza virus (AIV), infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), fowl adenovirus (FAdV) and mycoplasmas in all inocula [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .
