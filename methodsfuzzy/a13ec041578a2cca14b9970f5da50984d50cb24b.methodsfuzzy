The present experiment was a randomized controlled double-blind design. Cows were diagnosed as pregnant based on the presence of a viable embryo by TRUS between Days 35 to 60 after breeding and [2] then were divided randomly into three groups: CON group, allantochorion membrane detection by PRP (FMS group), and amniotic sac palpation PRP (ASP group). All the initial TRUS examinations were performed by the same veterinarian in the morning, who used a portable ultrasound machine equipped with a 7.5-MHz linear transducer as previously described [21] . The CON group did not receive any PRP of the uterus. The FMS group was submitted to PRP to detect the allantochorion membrane by compression of the pregnant uterine horn and allowing the chorioallantoic membrane to slip between the fingers [4] . Amniotic sac palpation consists of the compression of the pregnant uterine horn and detection of the amniotic sac as a small, turgid, slightly oblong, balloon-like structure between the thumb and the fingers [15] . All the initial pregnancy diagnoses were performed only once by a board-certified theriogenologist with over 30 years of bovine practice. In the event that one amniotic sac was found, no attempt was made to look for a second amniotic vesicle; therefore, the possibility of twin pregnancy detection was avoided. In general, the uterine horns were retracted directly or indirectly before this approach was used. No person was allowed to perform PRP or TRUS on the cattle at any time during the experimental period. After submitted to their respective treatments, each female was reevaluated for pregnancy again, in general, 2 to 4 weeks later. These pregnancy reexaminations were performed only by TRUS by two different veterinarians from the initial pregnancy diagnosis who were blind to the treatment of each cow but were aware of this project. All the pregnant females at this stage were followed until calving. A diagnosis of PRL was made when a heartbeat or signs of pregnancy (allantochorion membrane, amniotic sac, conceptus, or placentomes) were not seen by ultrasonography, or signs of conceptus degeneration were observed by TRUS [56] . All abortions, premature, or mature dead calves were submitted to necropsy to determine if abnormalities were present and which type. The necropsies were performed by two veterinarians, different from those of initial examination or reexaminations, who were also blinded to the initial intervention. All calves alive at birth were maintained for observation for 3 to 5 days to detect any type of abnormalities. Initial PRL was defined as the PRL between initial PRP and reexamination that include both late embryonic and early fetal period. Late embryonic PRL rate was defined at the percentage between the number of cows with PRL at reexamination and the initial number of pregnant cows assessed by PRP during late embryonic period. Early fetal PRL was defined as the percentage of PRL between the number of cows with PRL at reexamination from the initial number of pregnant cows assessed by PRP during early fetal period. Late PRL rate was the percentage of PRL between the number of cows that did not calve and the number of cows that were pregnant at reexamination. This is a measure of prenatal fetal loss from the middle of the first trimester of gestation to calving. Calving rate one was the percentage between the number of females that calved and the initial number of pregnant females. Calving rate two was the percentage between the number of cows that calved and the number of pregnant cows at reexamination. Missing cow was considered when the cow in the followup was either not found at the correct time, or sold or died.
