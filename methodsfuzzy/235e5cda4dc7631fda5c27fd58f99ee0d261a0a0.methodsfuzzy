Control and limitation of assembly Aggregation and undesired extension of the nanoparticles, resulting in polydisperse structures Charge repulsion at the N-termini of the helical subunits (Fletcher et al., 2013) Capped oligomers, lacking some binding elements necessary for assembly at the ends of the subunits (Usui et al., 2009)
