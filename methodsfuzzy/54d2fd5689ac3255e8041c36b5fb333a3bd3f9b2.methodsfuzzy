In order to both test the method so as to generate relevant results for the current outbreak, as well as to prove the dynamism of the resulting R values, this paper uses the data from DXY 8 on 2019-nCoV cases in China to model the R(t) values over time, with both n=3 and n=5, over a 3-week period from January 25 (t = 40) until February 14 (t = 54).
