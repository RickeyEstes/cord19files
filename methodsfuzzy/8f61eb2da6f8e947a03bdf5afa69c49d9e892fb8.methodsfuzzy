Tissue samples were taken from five cats without inflammatory disease (controls) and from 15 cats with FIP. Liver, spleen, lymph nodes, kidney, small intestine and lung were sampled from all the control cats. Small intestine and lungs were available for only 11 and 8 cats with FIP, respectively, while the other organs were sampled from all the cats with FIP. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5 µm thick sections obtained from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded samples. were applied on serial sections at the final dilution of 1:5000. The Avidin Biotin Complex (ABC) method with a commercially available kit (Vectastain Elite, Vector Labs Inc, Burlingame, CA, USA) was used to detect the positive reaction, as previously described (Hsu et al., 1980) , after inhibition of the endogenous peroxidase (H 2 O 2 1% in methanol). Antigen unmasking was performed using microwave pretreatment (two cycles of 5 minutes in citratebuffered solution, 0.01 M, pH 6.2) (Cattoretti et al., 1993) . Diaminobenzidine served as chromogen for the reaction and the slides were counterstained with Mayer's haematoxyilin. In each section, the number of cells positive for fAGPrP was evaluated and expressed as follows: −=absent +/−=rare (<2 per high power field) +=mild (2-5 per high power field) ++=moderate (5-10 per high power field) +++=abundant (>10 per high power field) In the same way the intensity of vascular positivity for fAGPrP was evaluated and considered as faint (+), moderate (++) or strong (+++).
