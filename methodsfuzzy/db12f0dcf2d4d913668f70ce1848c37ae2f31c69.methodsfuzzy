Study subjects. This study was carried out at Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Hangzhou Children's Hospital between April and August 2013 and was approved by the Ethics Committees of both hospitals. All methods were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from the children's parents or guardians prior to enrolment. Patients were identified and referred for enrolment by senior physicians after a careful examinations and evaluation. Diagnosis of HFMD was determined based on a popular or vesicular rash on the hands, feet, mouth or buttocks, which was usually accompanied with fever. Encephalitis was defined by the presence of an altered level of consciousness (including lethargy, drowsiness or coma, seizures or myoclonus) with CSF pleocytosis. In addition, patients with simple febrile convulsion (FC) were enrolled as controls. Diagnosis of FC was based on the criteria described previously 21 . In brief, simple FC was defined as generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurring in the first 48 hrs of a febrile illness and lasting for less than 15 min, but without any focal signs or recurring within 24 hrs, or no associated evidence of intracranial infection or a metabolic disorder 21 . Sampling and data collection. At enrolment, throat swabs and rectal swabs were collected from all participants. Meanwhile, a lumbar puncture was taken to obtain an acute phase CSF sample from each patient. All clinical samples from the HFMD patients mentioned above were taken at the same time and within 3 days from HFMD symptom onset. Unfortunately, recovery phase CSF samples were only obtained from 13 HFMD patients with encephalitis. All samples were stored at −80 °C until analysis. All of the clinical data of the participants were collected by reviewing electronic medical records from both hospitals, including age, gender, hematologicalparameters, CSF cytology and CSF biochemical markers.
