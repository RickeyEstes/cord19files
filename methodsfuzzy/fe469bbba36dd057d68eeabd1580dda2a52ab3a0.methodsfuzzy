2.1. Preparation and generation of airborne E. coli E. coli (CMCC1.3373) inoculated into nutrient broth medium was cultured in a constant-temperature oscillation incubator (IS-RSDA, Crystal Technology & Industries, Inc., USA) at 37Â°C and 170 r/min for 24 h. The suspension was centrifuged at 4000 r/min for 10 min, washed thrice with 0.85% NaCl solution to remove the medium, and then diluted. The bacteria-containing aqueous suspension was aerosolized by Table 1 Summary of models on bacteria inactivation using UV irradiation.
