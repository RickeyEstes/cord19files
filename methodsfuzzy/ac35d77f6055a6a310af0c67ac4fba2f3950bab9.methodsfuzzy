Because the thymus involutes after sexual maturity, evaluation of whether it is smaller than normal is difficult to discern unless the change is extreme or age-matched control animals are available. Before sexual maturity the thymus is easily identified as a lobular white to gray organ with a thin capsule. After sexual maturity the gland is often grossly indistinguishable from adipose connective tissue within the cranial mediastinum, although microscopic remnants may remain. An extremely small thymus in a neonatal animal should be considered abnormal and may indicate a primary immunodeficiency or secondary lymphoid depletion caused by extreme stress, often due to infectious diseases. Enlargement of the thymus is most often due to neoplasia. Serial sectioning of the thymus allows for gross identification of neoplasms, cysts, or hematomas.
