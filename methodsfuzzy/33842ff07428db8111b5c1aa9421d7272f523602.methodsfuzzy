This was a retrospective study including samples from all owned cats serologically tested for FeLV antigen at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria, between 1996 and 2011. Cats tested at other laboratories in the region or in-house at veterinary practices were not included in this survey. Data collated included date of testing, material tested, sex and age of cat tested, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) result. Details regarding whether cats were healthy or clinically symptomatic, free roaming, living in a multi-cat household, or were pedigree breeds were not routinely provided at the time of testing. Owing to the geographical location of the laboratory in Vienna, samples included in this study relate to cats in eastern regions of Austria only. As the annual number of samples tested decreased substantially over the 16 12 ). These ELISAs are based on monoclonal antibodies to p27 antigen and are direct techniques. They detect FeLV antigenaemic rather than viraemic cats. A positive ELISA result indicated antigenaemia (ie, an infected cat, either transiently or persistently viraemic), or a false-positive result, and a negative result showed no antigenaemia present at that time (ie, non-infected cat or a latently infected cat with no antigen detectable in blood) or a false-negative result. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all demographic parameters and all groups analysed. Prevalence data, odds ratios (ORs) and χ 2 values were calculated for a pooled analysis of data collected from 2008 to 2011 compared with data from the baseline year of 1996. P values were calculated using the CHITEST function of Microsoft Excel 2007. Furthermore, χ 2 values were calculated with respect to the age and sex of cats found to be FeLV antigenaemic.
