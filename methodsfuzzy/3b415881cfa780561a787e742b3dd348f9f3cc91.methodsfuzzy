Animals and inoculation procedures. Wistar rats (Canadian Breeding Laboratories, Montreal) were housed in conventional shoebox-type cages at 72Â°F throughout the study. Rats were inoculated with one of the following strains of HSV: the Mayo strain (obtained from the Laboratory Center for Disease Control, Ottawa, Ontario) or the EX 1966 strain (isolated from a case of herpetic keratitis by L. A. Hatch) of HSVi, and the MS or 075/72 (Percy and Hatch, 1975) strain of HSV*. Animals were inoculated subcutaneously in the interscapular region at 5 days of age. Each animal received approximately 25-50 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCIDS,J of virus, then were observed for a period of 2 weeks postinfection (pi). Clinically affected animals which died or were killed in extremis by chloroform inhalation were necropsied and tissues were routinely collected for light microscopy, fixed in Bouin's fluid, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. In selected animals, brain tissue and eyes were collected, using aseptic technique, for viral isolation and titration studies. Tissues were also collected and fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde and processed for scanning (Cohen, 1974) or transmission (Percy et al., 1980) electron microscopy. Only those litters with clinically affected animals, and with confirmed positive HSV isolations from one or more animals were included in the study. The animals reported in this communication were HSV-inoculated, nontreated control littermates of animals utilized in an antiviral treatment study. Viral culture, isolation, titration, and identification procedures have been previously described (Percy and Hatch, 1975; Nahmias et al., 1971) .
