Pseudovirion matrix and glycoprotein quantitation. Equal volumes of cell supernatants containing pseudovirions from three independent stocks were lysed in native lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] with 0.025% NP-40) and then passed through a dot blot apparatus onto nitrocellulose (Whatman). Wells were washed 5ϫ with PBS before being blocked in PBS with 10% nonfat milk for 1 h. Dot blots were incubated with the mouse anti-VSV matrix monoclonal antibody (MAb) 23H12 (a gift from Douglas Lyles) and the human anti-EBOV GP MAb KZ52 (a gift from Erica Saphire and Dennis Burton) diluted in PBS with 10% nonfat milk and 0.15% Tween-20 overnight at 4°C. By using separate IRDyeconjugated secondary antibodies (Abs) (LI-COR) directed toward the primary Abs, we were able to detect both VSV matrix protein and EBOV within a single well for each sample. The signals were visualized and quantified using an Odyssey Imaging Station and Image Studio software (LI-COR), which has been shown to be more sensitive and quantitative than enhanced chemiluminescence (47) . Thermolysin sensitivity assay. VSV pseudovirions, normalized for GP expression, were incubated with 200 g/ml, 2-fold serial dilutions starting with 5 g/ml, or a single concentration of 1.25 g/ml of thermolysin (THL) at 37°C for 15 min. The reaction mixtures were immediately placed on ice and diluted 20-fold in growth medium containing 50 M phosphoramidon (Sigma), a THL inhibitor. THL-treated pseudovirions were evaluated for Vero cell transduction. GFP-positive cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Antibody/antiserum neutralization assay. Serial dilutions of fractionated IgG pooled from 36 convalescent, vaccinated cynomolgus macaques challenged with EBOV (gift from John M. Dye, USAMRIID) or pooled convalescent sera from mice challenged with mouse-adapted EBOV (gift from Gene Olinger, USAMRIID) were incubated at 37°C for 30 min with pseudotyped VSV bearing the glycoproteins studied and normalized for the amount of matrix protein. The mixtures were diluted 5-fold in growth medium and added to Vero cells plated in a 48-well format. GFP-positive cells were enumerated with flow cytometry. The relative antiserum sensitivities were calculated as the reciprocals of the 50% infective concentration (IC 50 ) values determined with GraphPad Prism 5.
