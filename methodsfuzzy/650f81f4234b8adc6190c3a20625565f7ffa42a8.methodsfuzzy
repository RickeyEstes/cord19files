The complete genome of the E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 (Gen-Bank database accession number NC 002655), is considered since it has segments annotated as "islands". Its genome consists of a single circular DNA of 5,528,445 bp in length, 5453 genes of total length 4,885,090 bp and inter-gene sequences of length 643,355 bp in total. There is a 4001 bp long sequence of "N"s (unspecified nucleotides) in the genome (positions 1,725,749-1,729,749) and 6,641 incompletely specified nucleotides. There are 177 islands, designated as O-islands (OIs) with the total sum of length 1,278,307 bp. The backbone has a length of 4,250,138 bp. There are 4832 incompletely specified nucleotides in all the OIs. Approximately 26% of the E. coli EDL933 genes (1387/5416) lie completely within OIs, consisting mainly of phage or phage related sequences, and genes that may contribute to pathogenesis (i.e., PAI-like sequences), while others may confer strain-specific abilities to survive in different niches, or represent neutral variation between strains [5, 64] . Nine of the OIs (larger than 0.15 kilo base (kb)) encode for at least one large PAI (OI #148), and putative virulence factors having no obvious role in virulence [5, 64] . The two longest OIs, #43 and #48, are almost identical in length and nucleotide content. The OI #28, although 25,164 bp long, codes for four proteins, one of them being 5,189 amino acids in length (i.e., 15,567 bp; it is the longest protein, putative RTX family exoprotein). The 4001 bp long "N· · ·N" sequence is contained in the OI #52 [5, 64] .
