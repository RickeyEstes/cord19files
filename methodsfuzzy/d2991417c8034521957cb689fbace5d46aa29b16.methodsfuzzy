The sequences of BCoVs were named according to the following nomenclature: Virus name/FRA-EPI/location of sampling/year of sampling/specimen number. FRA corresponds to the acronym of France, EPI is an abbreviation for the EPICOREM consortium. In this study, the term "molecular isolate" was used for sequences of BCoV amplified directly from samples. To determine the genomic sequence of nsp12, S, and, N genes, a set of 17 overlapping RT-PCR products, from 553 to 1260 nucleotides, were generated using a total of 42 primers (Lau et al., 2011; Hasoksuz et al., 2002; Martínez et al., 2012) . RT-PCR reactions were performed using One Step RT-PCR System (Qiagen, Holden, Germany), from 2.5 μl of nucleic acid in a final volume of 25 μl, according the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, reaction mixtures were composed of 5 μl of 5× reaction buffer, 1 μl of a dNTP solution (0.4 mM each), 1 μl of Enzyme mix (Reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase), and 13.5 μl of RNA free water, 0.4 μM of forward and reverse primers (Table S1 , supplementary material), and 2.5 μl of RNA template. Thermal cycling involved 50°C for 30 min, followed by 95°C for 15 min and then 45 of 95°C for 30 s, 56°C to 60°C (depending of primers used), and 72°C for 1 min. The RT-PCR products encompassed all three complete genes (Table S1, supplementary material). All the primers were tested in silico and in vitro with our control BCoV strain to test their efficacy and the primer abilities to provide us with quality sequencing products. The bidirectional sequencing was performed at the Laboratory for Urgent Response to Biological Threats, Environment and Infectious Risks Unit, Institut Pasteur (Paris, France), following their sequencing protocol. The analysis of sequencing products was performed by the capillary electrophoresis 3730XL (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, US).
