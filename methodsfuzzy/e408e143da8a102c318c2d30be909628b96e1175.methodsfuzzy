Step one: Designing series of overlapping short peptides. Design all 16/18mer peptides with an overlap of 8 aa residues covering the full-length of the target protein or a longer segment sequence for the first round of antigenic peptide mapping, as well as design a set of 8mer peptides with overlapping 7 aa residues and covering each reactive 16/18mer peptide sequence for the second round of precise BCE motif identification. Note: It is recommended to design overlapping 16mer peptides, as the cost for synthesizing oligonucleotide of less than 60 nt in length is lower than that of oligonucleotide of more than 60 nt. Also, when using a mAb or cross-reactive mAb to map BCE, it is desirable to express two or several longer segments of the target protein so as to determine its shorter antibody reactive segment followed by designing overlapping 8/16mer peptides. Doing so can save the cost, time and workload in following steps 4-7. Step two: Designing oligonucleotides of plus and minus strands. Design all plus and minus strands of DNA fragments encoding each designed 8/18mer peptides of the target protein, having cohesive ends for BamH I and Sal I restriction enzymes at their 5'and 3' ends, so that they could be directly used to insert into the BamH I and Sal I sites downstream of the GST188 gene in plasmid pXXGST-3 after their annealing in pairs. Also, a TAA termination codon is designed between each 8/18mer peptide and Sal I site, so as to avoid possible false blotted bands of 8/18mer peptides for BCE and minimal motif mapping, which will be caused by four GSVD residues encoded by 12 bp present in cloning site region of pXXGST-3 ( Fig 1E) . In short, the designed plus and minus strands of encoding fragment should include sequences of 5'-GATCC and TAAG-3', as well as 5'-TCGACTTA and G-3' at their both ends (Fig 2A  and 2B ). As mentioned in step one, it is just close to 60 nt that is oligonucleotide corresponding to 57 nt encoding 16mer peptide together with 9 nt at their both ends. Note: It is emphasized that design of the target gene fragments at this step is very convenient, that is, the consideration of the optimal codon usage for expression of each short peptide fused with GST188 in E. coli is not essential as more than 1000 of the constructed 8/18mer peptide fusion proteins have been successfully expressed by using their DNA fragments from known prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes [12] [13] [14] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . However, it should be ascertained that whether there is another potential BamH I or Sal I site within the oligonucleotide sequence, if any, it needs to be modified because it will disturb annealing of the paired oligonucleotides and its subsequent cloning. Step three: Chemical synthesis of the designed DNA fragments. Once the plus and minus stands of encoding gene fragments have been designed, they can be synthesized and PAGE-purified by the SBS Genetech Co., Ltd, Shanghai. All PAGE-purified DNA fragments should be stored at -20˚C prior to use. Step four: Conduct annealing reactions of PAGE-purified DNA fragments in pairs. 1. To make 100 μM stock solution of each synthesized DNA fragment by adding appropriate volume of double distilled H 2 O (ddH 2 O) into tubes based on the report provided by the biotechnical service company, respectively. 2. Take respectively 5 μl of the stock solution from two tubes in pairs into a 1.5 ml of new tube, and add 90 μl of ddH 2 O to make 5 μM final concentration of each DNA fragment. 3. Heat tubes up to 94˚C in an electric heating block, anneal for 5 min, and then allowed them to cool gradually to room temperature (RT). Step five: Development of r-clones for expressing each 8/18mer peptide. 1. Perform the ligation reactions using above each annealed DNA fragment and constructed vector of pXXGST-3 digested with BamH I and Sal I enzymes, and then purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit after running 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis at 50 V for 90 min. The ligation reaction was carried out at 16˚C overnight using the following 15 μl of reaction mixture in 0.5 ml tube (Table 1) , in which all components were mixed by flicking and spin briefly (refrigerated Mikro 120 Centrifuge). 2. Employ the above ligation mixture in each tube to transform the E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells according to the standard procedures [28] . Grow overnight each clone on solid Luria Broth (LB)-ampicillin (amp) plates at 37˚C, respectively. It should be observed that there are about 10 to 20 clones on the LB plates next morning. Note: If there was no growth of clones on a LB-amp plate after repeating twice, it suggests that they were incorrect or wrongly paired DNA fragments and need to be resynthesized. 3. Grow overnight each clone from LB-amp plates in 3 ml of liquid LB-amp medium at 30˚C, subsequently dilute 1:50 in fresh LB-amp medium and were grown at 30˚C at 220 rpm to an OD 600 of 0.6-0.7. The clones were induced at 42˚C for 4-5 h. Harvest each cell pellets by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 5 min at 4˚C. Cell pellets obtained from 3 ml culture of expressed 8/18mer peptide fusion proteins were boiled in 400 μl of 1x sample loading buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol and 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min. Peptide biosynthetic method for epitope/epitome mapping Step six: Screening of r-clones by running SDS-PAGE. Take~3 μl of each cell suspension from prepared individual thermo-induced bacterial cultures to run SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel for screening r-clones, and cell proteins resolved by conducting electrophoreses at 100 V for 2 h. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant blue G250 for analyzing the bands of fusion proteins. Note: As shown in Fig 3, all r-clones can be easily determined by observing difference between GST188 fusion proteins expressed in lanes 3-6 and control GST188 protein expressed by pXXGST-2 in lane 2. Approximately 1 kDa difference can be observed even when expressing overlapping 8mer peptide fusion proteins as compared to GST188 protein. However, as shown in lane 7, there was no specific 8/18mer-peptide fusion protein band appeared as compared to lanes 3-6 when self-ligation of pXXGST-3 happened due to inadequate enzyme digestion, suggesting that it no longer needs any additional control (lane 2 or 7) on the gels for the 8/18mer peptides expressed specifically in r-clones when using pXXGST-3 vector in the improved GST188-BSP method. Step seven: Sequencing of insert for each determined r-clone. Conduct sequencing of all synthesized DNA fragments inserted into plasmid pXXGST-3 from r-clones verified by above SDS-PAGE analysis through the Shanghai Biosune Biotechnology Co., Ltd, China. It is recommended to use the primer 5'-GGCCATCATACGTTATATAG-3'. Note: For ensuring that all amino acid sequences of expressed short peptides are accurate, it is important to check the correctness of each synthesized DNA fragments by sequencing after determining r-clones and before conducting BCE and minimal motif mapping (Fig 2C) , because this step can avoid possible error in BCE mapping due to possible bp missense mutation or tubes numbering errors happened when synthesizing a large number of DNA fragments. Therefore, elimination of deleterious errors becomes necessary in many cases. Of course, for saving cost and time if needed, it might be carried out after finishing two rounds of BCE and fine motif mapping to check those DNA fragments encoding reactive 8/18mer peptides. Step eight: Determination of BCE recognized by mAbs/pAbs in Western blot. Proteins on SDS-PAGE gel were electrotransferred onto 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane, on which complete transfer was ensured by staining membrane with 0.1% Ponceau S. Non-specific antibody-binding sites on the membrane were blocked with blocking phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% skim milk powder or preimmune rabbit serum sample overnight at 4˚C, and probed with antisera raised against r-huZP4C that was pre-adsorbed with host cell lysates or mAb C1P5 (1:1000 or 1:5000 dilution in PBS) for 2 h at RT. Following washing four times, specific bands on the membrane were visualized by using goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with HRP at 1:10000 dilution. The blot was developed by using the ECL plus Western blotting detection reagents. Peptide biosynthetic method for epitope/epitome mapping Note: To produce clear blotted bands in Western blotting, it is suggested that before use, the antiserum against r-protein may be absorbed on host cell lysates as described earlier [28] , which facilitate in removal of cross-reactive antibodies to E. coli proteins.
