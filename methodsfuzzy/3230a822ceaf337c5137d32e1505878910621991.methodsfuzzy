Traditional direct methods for RV are viral culture and antigen detection assays. Among indirect methods, many serologic assays, such as EIA, haemmagglutination inhibition, complement fixation, etc. have been used for RV. However, serology is not useful in clinical practice since diagnosis must be achieved by demonstration of seroconversion or seroincrease of IgG antibodies, between acute-phase and convalescent-phase serum samples [16, 18] . In past decades, viral culture was the gold standard for the aetiological diagnosis of RV. No automation has been reported for this technology. Rather, advances in this field of clinical virology have been focused on shortening detection times and on increasing sensitivity. Currently, this procedure is limited to reference laboratories that are provided with the appropriate infrastructure, with the main objective of recovering the viral strain for further genetic and/or antigenic characterisation. Traditional viral culture requires at least 7 days for yielding a result. To solve this problem, the next step in the viral culture methodology was the introduction of the shellvial assay, based on centrifugation-enhanced adsorption of the sample onto the cells monolayer reproduced on cover slips. Detection is commonly achieved by fluorescent assay with monoclonal antibodies on the cell monolayer. This method reduces the time to obtain a result to 24-48 h without a deleterious effect on sensitivity and specificity. Although viral culture may represent an open system for detecting multiple viral pathogens, there is no single cell line that allows the growth of all RV, and there is no RV that may grow in any cell line. Thus, to detect the most prevalent RV, multiple cell lines must be used. The combination of shell-vial assay with the inclusion of different cell lines in the same vial has represented a subsequent step that has facilitated the recovery of RV isolates from cell cultures [19] [20] [21] . NAAT have recently contributed to increase the sensitivity of viral culture. PCR assays can be carried out on the cell culture supernatant to detect the isolates. This approach has demonstrated the highest sensitive reading procedure, and has allowed identifying viral isolates in cell monolayers with no cytopathic effect [22] . However, viral culture is not useful for detection of new RV, since they do not grow or grow poorly in cell culture. For this purpose, the best alternative is NAAT. The availability of monoclonal antibodies has allowed the development of different technologies for detecting viral antigens from clinical samples. Fluorescent and chromatographic immunoassays are rapid, easy to perform and have proved their utility, mainly for RSV and Flu. The minimum (hands-on and hands-off) turnaround time that these techniques require for obtaining results have converted them as referral point-of-care diagnostic assays. However, sensitivity widely depends on the commercial method and on the type of patient and sample, ranging from 10% to 70% in the case of pandemic Flu [23] . Higher viral loads and thus, higher sensitivity of antigen detection methods for RSV and Flu have been observed in the paediatric population versus adults and in nasopharyngeal aspirates versus nasopharyngeal exudates [24, 25] . Recently, the goal of automation in these type of diagnostic tools has been achieved by a new commercial assay, the mariPOC ® respi test (ArcDia, Turku, Finland). This allows rapid detection and differentiation between viral and bacterial respiratory infections (Flu A, Flu B, RSV, hMPV, PIV 1, PIV2, PIV3, ADV and Streptococcus pneumoniae). The test is very simple to operate and handson-time is less than a minute per sample. Results for highly positive samples are obtained in 20 minutes whereas low positive and negative samples are reported in 2 hours. The mariPOC ® system uses polystyrene microparticles as solid phase reaction carriers for the immunocomplex formation. Viral antigens are captured by specific antibodies fixed onto the microsphere and bind to a fluorescentlylabelled conjugate. The amount of immunocomplexes formed on the microsphere is proportional to the analyte concentration. Detection of the fluorescence signal is carried out by separation-free two-photon excitation fluorescence detection assay, the ArcDia TM TPX (TPX). In contrast to other antigen detection methods, TPX assay avoids the need for multiple washes, and readout is achieved by on-line monitoring of reaction kinetics [26] . Preliminary studies have reported a sensitivity and specificity of this method comparable to ultrasensitive fluorescent immunoassays (DELPHIA ® method) [27, 28] and offers the advantage of automated result readout, allowing connections to laboratory information systems. Several commercial assays offer automated solutions for nucleic acids extraction, isolation and purification that range from low to high throughput. The high quality of nucleic acids obtained with these systems are suitable for a broad range of applications in nucleic acid research, including gene expression analysis (using real-time PCR or conventional PCR on standard block cyclers), microarray analysis, genotyping reactions, and many other technologies. These instrument purify viral DNA and RNA from a broad range of respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal aspirates and swabs, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavages,…). Contaminations are reduced since the system is closed, which avoids splashing and generation of aerosols and drops. Many of these systems include ready-to-run, prefilled cartridges with all reagents required for the purification procedure. Setup is rapid and saves time. Commercial assays for the simultaneous processing of a maximum of 8 up to 96 samples are available. Specific studies on the efficiency of these methods in recovery of DNA and RNA from RV have been carried out [31] [32] [33] [34] . Besides its higher reproducibility, the amount of nucleic acids recovered from automated extraction methods is greater than the amount achieved with manual methods [31] . Overall, a good recovery of viral RNA and DNA, without significant differences among automated extractors, has been found. No evidence of the presence of inhibitors is observed as well. However, some studies have assessed that, whereas most instruments yield the same render in recovering DNA from respiratory pathogens, they differ in reproducibility, recovery and linearity in recovering viral RNA [34] . Other parameters have to be considered for the purification of RV genomes. The extractor must be versatile so that it allows extraction from a wide range of respiratory samples and from variable sample volume. Indeed, lysis buffer must be provided independently by the manufacturer to inactivate respiratory specimens in biosafety cabinets if samples are fed in open containers into the instrument.
