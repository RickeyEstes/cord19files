Hybridization-Based Assays and Microarrays An early example of this method was the discovery of human papillomavirus 16 DNA in cervical cancer specimens, 65 which was achieved by the demonstration of novel papillomaviral DNA in cancer specimens by using human papillomavirus 11 probe hybridization under low-stringency conditions. Specific probes developed using the novel DNA were found to hybridize with cervical cancer DNA from several patients, even under high-stringency conditions. Probe hybridization using panviral DNA microarrays that incorporate many 70-mer oligonucleotides derived from highly conserved sequences of several pathogenic virus families can enable virus discovery. 17, 18 The long probes hybridize to novel viral sequences even if sequence complementarity is less than perfect. Novel viruses that are related to represented viruses may produce a unique hybridization pattern, despite not being explicitly represented in the microarray. This provides an efficient, unbiased, massively parallel screening strategy for viral nucleic acid in clinical specimens after amplification by random PCR. However, the use of longnucleotide probes in virus discovery arrays increases the risk of hybridization with non-specific random PCR products. Microarray analysis was used in parallel with consensus primer amplification-sequencing by a group of investigators to identify coronavirus sequences in patients with SARS. 66 Amplification-Based Assays If the novel virus is strongly suspected to be a member of a known group of viruses, then pools of degenerate primers that encompass all possible nucleotide differences in a given sequence may be used to amplify gene segments in the clinical specimen or infected cell culture extract. Such degenerate primers are derived from amino acid motifs of highly conserved proteins of the virus group of interest. Conserved blocks (usually pentapeptides) are selected from the amino acid sequences of these proteins that preferably contain amino acids encoded by fewer codons (eg, methionine) so as to limit the level of degeneracy of the primer pool to <128-fold. A higher degeneracy would lead to a decrease in sensitivity of the assay. Degeneracy at the 3 0 end of the primer should be especially avoided because this compromises primer extension. An alternative approach is to derive consensus primers directly from the nucleotide sequences of conserved proteins of a particular virus family. Consensus primer PCR uses primer pairs constituted from the most common nucleotide variant at each position of the primer sequence and relies on the ability of this primer pair to amplify closely related target DNA. However, the sensitivity of this approach is entirely dependent on the degree of complementarity of the target DNA sequence to the consensus primers. Consensus primers derived by multiple alignment of known coronavirus pol gene nucleotide sequences enabled the discovery of human coronavirus HKU1 and several other novel animal coronaviruses 8,25e31 (Figure 2, C and D) . A different strategy combining the strengths of degenerate and consensus primers is the use of consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers (CODEHOPs). 67 CODEHOPs contain a degenerate 3 0 core region and a conserved 5 0 clamp sequence. The limited level of degeneracy in the 3 0 core maintains the relative lack of bias of degenerate primers, whereas the conserved 5 0 clamp sequence stabilizes hybridization of the 3 0 core and allows higher annealing temperatures. Interactive software programs for designing CODEHOPs are now available. 68 A recent approach to the discovery of novel equine hepaciviruses is selection of horse serum specimens that are immunoreactive to highly conserved hepacivirus antigens using a luciferase immunoprecipitation assay. 69 Positive sera were then tested with hepacivirus consensus primers, followed by sequencing of amplification products. When a large specimen pool is available, this approach enables efficient selection of specimens for screening by consensus primer PCR or high-throughput sequencing. However, antibody responses are often associated with decreasing viral loads for many acute viral infections. Therefore, this strategy could lack sensitivity for the discovery of novel viruses that do not establish chronicity. The utility of consensus primer PCR is limited if the sequence of the novel virus is highly divergent from that of known virus families. This scenario requires unbiased screening of the specimen for viral nucleic acid. However, the quantity of putative viral nucleic acid is usually scarce compared to host DNA, making such screening a tedious exercise. Overcoming this obstacle generally requires targeted amplification of nucleic acid extracted from nucleasepretreated specimens, followed by selective detection and sequencing of viral nucleic acid.
