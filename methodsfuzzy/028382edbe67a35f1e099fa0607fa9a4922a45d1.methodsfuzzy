Purinergic receptor agonists and antagonists. Adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells or A549 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were evaluated to determine the presence of the purinergic receptor P2X7. A549 cells cultured on cover glass were fixed with 4% buffered formalin and later incubated with 5% nonfat milk for 30 min. After the blocking step, the cells were incubated with a polyclonal anti-P2X7 receptor antibody raised in rabbit (OriGene, Rockville, MD). This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (67) . Female C57BL/6 or P2X7 receptor knockout mice (8 to 10 weeks old) purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) were used for all experiments. For virus challenges, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg of body weight) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) before intranasal administration of a lethal dose of influenza virus PR/8 or NL/09 in a volume of 30 l. Animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of illness, and body weights were recorded daily for 14 days. Upon reaching 75% of initial body weight, animals were humanely euthanized. Lung virus titers. On days 4 and 7 postinfection, groups of mice were euthanized, and the lungs were collected and homogenized (BeadBlaster 24; Benchmark Scientific) in 1 ml of sterile phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). The lung homogenates were spun at 16,000 ϫ g for 10 min to pellet tissue debris, and the supernatants were collected. Samples were stored at Ϫ80°C until titration was performed by standard plaque assay on MDCK cells. Histopathology. Mice were euthanized on day 4 or 7 postinfection, and their lungs were perfused in situ with 1 ml of 10% buffered formalin. Lung sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and evaluated by an experienced comparative pathologist from the Center of Comparative Medicine and Surgery in the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The following score system (on a scale of 0 to 4) was used to analyze the histopathology of the lung sections: 0, no lesions; 1, mild changes with scattered cell necrosis/vacuolation and few/scattered inflammatory cells in the bronchiolar epithelium with minimal perivascular inflammation; 2, moderate multifocal vacuolation with peribronchiolar inflammation (Ͻ5 cell layers thick); 3, marked, multifocal/segmental necrosis, epithelial loss/effacement, and peribronchiolar inflammation (Ͼ5 cell layers thick); and 4, severe, coalescing areas of necrosis, parenchymal effacement with confluent areas of inflammation. Overall pathology scores per group were used for the statistical analysis of the results. Additional sections were processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and used to determine the amount of the apoptosis-related protein caspase-3. Ten-micron-thick deparaffinized sections were subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval by boiling in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6) for 10 min, followed by a 30 min cool-down. Cleaved caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) was diluted 1:1,000 in the following buffer: 0.1 M PBS, 0.3% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% (wt/vol) sodium azide, 0.06% (wt/vol) n-ethyl-maleimide, and 20% (vol/vol) glycerol. This antibody specifically recognizes the large fragment (17/19 kDa) of the active protein (cleaved), but not full-length caspase-3. Cleaved caspase-3-positive cells were counted in printed digital images using a transparent template with a rectangular box measured 0.25 mm by 0.5 mm for photographs taken at a magnification of ϫ20 in three different fields. An individual blind to the experimental treatments completed the quantification. Bone marrow-derived macrophages. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were generated by culturing total bone marrow from femurs and tibias of P2X7 receptor KO or wild-type mice as previously described (68) . Collected cells were plated at a density of 1 ϫ 10 6 cells/well in six-well plates using high-glucose Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM penicillin-streptomycin, 10 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES, 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20% L929 cell conditioned supernatant containing macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). The cells were cultured for 5 days, after which the medium and nonadherent cells were removed, and fresh medium was added every other day until harvest between days 8 and 10. The cells were purified by adherence. To harvest the cells, we used 500 l of 0.5% trypsin. For infection studies, cells were plated in 12-well plates and infected with influenza A NL/09 virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 48 h. Supernatants of samples were collected at 24 and 48 h postinfection and analyzed for virus titer and cytokine production. Cytokine and chemokine quantification. Protein levels of cytokines/chemokines were evaluated using a multiplex bead array assay (Milliplex; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) in cell culture supernatant of bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with influenza NL/09 or in lung homogenates and serum samples from mice infected with influenza virus NL/09 or PR/8 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The assays were run using 1,500 beads per set of each of cytokines measured per well in a total volume of 50 l. The plates were read on a Luminex MAGPIX platform. For each bead set, Ͼ50 beads were collected. The median fluorescence intensity of these beads was recorded and used for analysis with the Milliplex software using a 5P regression algorithm. Flow cytometry. Mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital at the indicated time points. Lungs were isolated in HBSS buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), digested with type IV collagenase (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) for 30 min with agitation, and then processed into single-cell suspensions by forcing the digested lungs through a 70-m nylon cell strainer (Falcon, Corning, NY). Single-cell suspensions were stained in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 2 mM EDTA. Antibodies against the following immune markers were used for discrimination of immune cell types: CD45 (30-F11; BD), CD11b (M1/70; BioLegend), CD11c (HL3; BD), Ly6c (HK1.4; eBioscience), GR1 (RB6-8C5; eBioscience), major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) (M5/ 114.15.2; BD), and SiglecF (E50-2440; BD). Live cells were discriminated from dead cells by using a viability dye eFluor 520 (eBioscience). All flow cytometry data were acquired on an LSR-II flow cytometer (BD) and analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo LCC, Ashland, OR). Cell sorting was performed on a FACS Aria (BD). Bronchoalveolar lavage cytospin. Mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital at the indicated time points. Leukocytes recruited to the airway space were collected by lavaging the lungs in situ by slowly injecting 1 ml of cold sterile PBS using an input 3-ml syringe with three-way stopcock and then approximately 1 ml of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from lungs using the output 3-ml syringe. We repeated this procedure three times. Cell number and cell viability were determined using trypan blue and an automatic cell counter (Countess II; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). For the cytospin, 300 l of each BALF sample containing 1 ϫ 10 5 cells was spun at 600 rpm for 10 min. The slides were air dried for 2 h and then stained with Diff-Quick. The slides were evaluated in a blind manner by a trained comparative pathologist. Differential cell counts (percentage) were established by counting at least 200 cells at a high magnification (ϫ600) using the following categorization (69) . Undifferentiated alveolar macrophages were defined as relatively large, round to oval cells with eccentric round to oval nuclei and abundant granular cytoplasm, while activated macrophages were larger and contain more cytoplasm and numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles, with some macrophages binucleated. Neutrophils (10 to 15 m in diameter) were characterized by an eosinophilic cytoplasm and a basophilic lobulated nucleus with violet granules. Inactivated lymphocytes were small (Ͻ10 m) cells with rounded nuclei, dense nuclear chromatin, and little cytoplasm, while activated (reactive) lymphocytes were larger with more basophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei. Finally, we also quantified the percentage of lysed cells by the relative proportion of isolated (naked) nuclei. Statistical analysis. Statistical differences in virus titers and cytokine production between the KO and WT mice were analyzed using Student's t test analysis followed by the Holm-Sidak test. For analysis of survival rates, Kaplan-Meier curves were compared using the log rank (Mantel-Cox) test. For analysis of the flow cytometry results, we used a two-way analysis of variance followed by multiple comparisons using the Tukey posttest. Error bars indicate standard errors of the means. P values of Ͻ0.05 were considered significant. All the analyses were performed using the GraphPad software (La Jolla, CA).
