In order to understand the making of new regionalism in Hong KongeShenzhen region, two questionnaire surveys on two cities' residents were conducted in 2008 and 2009 respectively. Both questionnaire surveys aimed to investigate general characteristics of cross-boundary movements, public opinion on Hong Konge Shenzhen metropolis and regional integration, public opinion on some potential cooperative policies or initiatives, understanding on competition and cooperation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. In Hong Kong, telephone survey was conducted by the Telephone Survey Research Laboratory in Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In sampling, telephone numbers were first selected randomly from telephone directories and their last two digits were removed as seed numbers. Random numbers were added as last two digits, and another set of numbers was then generated. Duplicate numbers were then screened out, and the remaining numbers mixed in a random order became the final sample. Upon successful contact being made with a target household, one member of the household was selected among those present using the "next birthday" rule. Target population of the survey were age 18 or above. The survey was conducted from 6 pm to 10:30 pm every night during 30 January to 4 February 2008. Within 7000 samples, 4493 failed to contact for various reasons such as line busy, no person, fax, and non-household phone. There were 2507 successful contacts, including 1327 no person answering the phone, 183 no suitable respondents for doing the survey, 487 who refused to do the survey, and 510 successful interviews. Excluding cases of no suitable respondents and no person answering the phone, the overall response rate is 51.2%. The sampling error for all percentages is less than plus/minus 4.34% points at 95% confidence level. As 99.9% households in Hong Kong have telephone, the result of survey is representative. For the questionnaire survey in Shenzhen, it was conducted by a consultancy company in Shenzhen. The survey was conducted in four major districts in Shenzhen (Futian, Luohu, Nanshan and Yantian) during 15e25 February 2009. Interviewees were randomly recruited on streets, and some were chosen by snow-ball sampling. 508 Shenzhen residents aged 18 or above were successful interviewed. The sampling error for all percentages is less than plus/minus 5.12% points at 95% confidence level. In addition, 20 people in two cities were interviewed, including government officials, urban planners, scholars and residents, adopting semi-structured and non-structured interview methods. Selected officials and urban planners were key persons involved in Hong Kong or Shenzhen's urban development and policy making. Scholars interviewed had research focus on Hong KongeShenzhen development and integration. These interviews focused on the context of Hong KongeShenzhen development, the latest policies on Hong KongeShenzhen cooperation, cross-boundary area development plans, opinion on two cities' cooperation and competition. These informants provided very useful information for this study as supplements for the above two questionnaire surveys. 1979e1996: The emergence of regional society from below Hong Kong and Shenzhen are two cities in south China, separated by a small river (Fig. 1) . Hong Kong was formerly a British colony and was returned to China's sovereignty as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) in 1997. The framework of OCTS has been implemented in Hong Kong since then. Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy, with independent executive, legislative and judicial power. Shenzhen as Hong Kong's north neighboring city was designed as a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) by the central government in 1979, with the intention of attracting foreign investment as well as preparing for the return of Hong Kong (Wu, 1997) . In the administrative hierarchy, Shenzhen is a prefecture-level city under the administration of Guangdong Province. Shenzhen has grown from a small frontier town with a population of less than 30 thousand in 1978 to one of the top cities with a population over 10 million in China. Its GDP reached US$ 120.1 billion in 2009, about 57.0% of Hong Kong. Shenzhen was ranked as the second most competitive city in China in 2006e2010, only after Hong Kong (Ni et al., 2010) . Under the framework of OCTS, capitalist Hong Kong and socialist Shenzhen have different institutional bases, which are called asymmetric urban governance (Shen, 2008a) . Hong Kong government adopts a "positive non-intervention policy", while Shenzhen government adopts a "developmental state" approach to urban economy. Overall, the cross-boundary relationship between Hong Kong and Shenzhen is very similar to those trans-border cities and EUROREGION in the EU (Heddebaut, 2004) . Their integration can be analyzed through the lens of new regionalism. The rise of cross-boundary region of Hong KongeShenzhen/ Hong KongePRD region has much to do with a wide range of global and regional changes since the late 1970s. This study focuses on the period after 1979. Economic globalization has led to the rise of the "world factory" and the expansion of specific commodity chains in this region. Trans-national producers from the U.S., Germany and Japan relocated their manufacturing sectors to developing countries for cheap labor and raw materials (Sum, 2001 (Sum, , 2002a . The importance of such external force is another important feature of regionalism in South China, different from the EU. Due to comparative advantages in cheap labor and preferential policies in Shenzhen/PRD, Hong Kong transferred the majority of its manufacturing to Shenzhen and other cities in the PRD. Shenzhen thus became the production base of Hong Kong. Hong Kong became the "front shop" of the PRD, providing producer service to the PRD region. The model of "front shop and back factory" was an important factor underlying Shenzhen's astonishing economic growth after 1979 (Shen, 2003; Sit, 1998) . A regional society thus emerged from below in economic terms during the period of 1979e1996, due to the increasing cross-boundary investment of Hong Kong in Shenzhen. In the colonial period before 1997, cross-boundary interaction between Hong Kong and Shenzhen was mainly driven by economic factors. Hong Kong-funded firms were active agents in the crossboundary regionalization, leading to market-led economic integration (Shen, 2003) or foreign direct investment-driven (FDIdriven) regionalization (Sasuga, 2004) . Shenzhen received 27.1% of Hong Kong FDI to mainland China in 1986 and 16.0% in 1991 (Shen, 2008a . In the period 1986e1996, the total actual utilized foreign investment from Hong Kong reached US$ 6.99 billion in Shenzhen, accounting for 63.9% of the total foreign investment in Shenzhen (Table 1) . According to a survey conducted by the Federation of Hong Kong Industries (FHKI, 2003) , Hong Kong-based companies had established 53,300 operations (85% of the national total) in Guangdong province which employed 10.34 million workers in 2002. Shenzhen accounted for 29.5% of the total factories and 25% of the total employment, just after Dongguan with 34% and 39% respectively. Apart from the relocation of Hong Kong's manufacturing, some low value added services, such as retailing, accounting, recreation and leisure, have also relocated to Shenzhen and other PRD cities since the mid-1990s (Yang, 2005a; Sum, 2002a Sum, , 2002b . According to the regionness model, nation state is a dominant player in region building at the level of regional society (Hettne & SÃ¶derbaum, 2000) . There is much interaction between state and non-state actors. However, the nation state of China and colonial city state of Hong Kong took very different stances to crossboundary regionalization in the pre-1997 period. The central government of China was very active in promoting economic integration. It introduced open-door policy to expand and develop new production platforms and markets by attracting FDI including those from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Shenzhen SEZ, as well as other coastal cities, was designated as a pioneering site by the central government with various policy incentives. Shenzhen thus became a new geo-economic time-space to re-connect China to the regional and global systems (Sum, 2002a (Sum, , 2002b . Therefore, the national government of China played an important role in creating initial conditions for the development of cross-boundary Hong Konge Shenzhen metropolis (Perkmann & Sum, 2002) . In contrast, the colonial Hong Kong government was passive on economic integration. It took the "Fortress Hong Kong" policy to keep distance from the mainland before 1997 due to the cold war and conflicts in political ideologies. In short, the cross-boundary development of Hong Kong's enterprises has played a vital role in breaking down territorial jurisdictions, leading to the emergence of a cross-boundary production network in the greater PRD region. However, unlike its western counterparts, the expansion of market exchange did not induce "re-regulation" at government level. Therefore, Naughton used "informal" cross-boundary regional integration to differentiate Hong Kongemainland China's integration from the EU and NAFTA's "formal" regional integration (Naughton, 1997) . Therefore, a cross-boundary metropolis of Hong KongeShenzhen was emerging only in economic sense, inter-governmental cooperation and institutional arrangements were inadequate in these two boundary cities (Yang, 2005a) . It was clear that the regional society of Hong KongeShenzhen region was initially created by market players without the involvement of colonial Hong Kong government. It was called informal regional society from below. However, Hong Kong government has changed its position toward the crossboundary regionalization since the mid-2003. A transitional regional society emerged in 1997e2003, followed by a formal regional society after 2004. 1997e2003: The transitional regional society with return of the political In light of "the double movement" thesis, an expansion and deepening of the market system is followed by a political intervention in defense of society, inducing the second great transformation (Hettne, 2003) . In the emerging Hong KongeShenzhen metropolis, the second great transformation took place during the period after 1997. Different from Hettne's regioness model, this second movement was not a direct result of the first movement. It was a response to many economic and social challenges facing Hong Kong. Indeed, Hong Kong government and society went through a transitional period 1997e2003 when pro-integration and anti-integration camps clashed. A formal regional society emerged only after mid-2003 when Hong Kong and Shenzhen governments began to introduce formal institutional arrangements to facilitate the development of Hong KongeShenzhen metropolis. Shenzhen government, using a developmental state approach to economic development, has consistently taken a positive stance toward Hong KongeShenzhen cooperation since its inception (Shen, 2004; Yeung, 2006) . But Hong Kong government only began to respond to inter-city cooperation actively after 2003. Shenzhen was designated as a SEZ because of its proximity to Hong Kong. One original objective of establishing Shenzhen SEZ was to develop an export-oriented economy by using Hong Kong's capital and learning experiences of its capitalist market economy (Bruton, Bruton, & Yu, 2005; Ng, 2003) . The economic miracle of Shenzhen in the past three decades was largely due to the Hong Kong factor. Therefore, Shenzhen government has been active in Hong KongeShenzhen cooperation before and after 1997. In the pre-1997 period, each round of Shenzhen Comprehensive Plan emphasized cooperative development strategies with Hong Kong (Bruton et al., 2005) . During the foremost years after the 1997 handover, Shenzhen became very enthusiastic in linking up with Hong Kong in anticipation of bright prospects in Hong Konge Shenzhen cooperation. Many new ideas and vision, such as twin cities, northesouth cities and sister cities, were proposed by academic elites and government officials in Shenzhen (Bauhinia Foundation Research Centre, 2007) . However, The Hong Kong government was reluctant to accept such suggestions from Shenzhen. The slow development of cross-boundary infrastructure was an example (Yeung, 2006) . On Hong Kong side, the Fortress Hong Kong mentality was not dismantled immediately after the 1997 handover. It still prevailed in Hong Kong government as well as society. Anti-integration was popular among many officials, businessmen and residents. This has political, social and economic reasons. First, politically, there was disagreement on Hong KongePRD integration within Hong Kong SAR government. The government was divided into two camps with opposite views on the cross-boundary cooperation/ integration (Shen, 2004) . Some officials were concerned that close economic integration could undermine the political autonomy of Hong Kong SAR. Thus Hong Kong SAR government did not actively move toward cooperation. Second, it was recognized that local and international confidence in the future of Hong Kong was fragile during the early years after 1997. Many Hong Kong residents were worried that close integration may cause potential interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs by the Chinese government and change their capitalist way of life (Shen, 2004) . Third, on economic aspects, some interest groups, including real estate developers, homeowners and retailers, worried about the potentially negative economic impact on Hong Kong caused by close cross-boundary integration. Apart from the above reasons, Hong Kong SAR government also faced internal difficulties after the 1997 handover, including the economic downturn caused by the 1997 Asia Financial Crisis (AFC), the government's handling of Article 23 of the Basic Law and the epidemic outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the early 2003. These problems further deepened Hong Kong's crisis. Many Hong Kong residents were not satisfied with Hong Kong SAR government. On 1 July 2003, about 500,000 citizens joined the mass street protest against the government. It is clear that Hong Kong SAR government faced with various internal social and economic difficulties, and the strategy of Hong KongePRD integration was not considered a priority. From 2004 onwards: formal regional society with attempts to build regional institutions The worst is always a turning point for better. The Fortress Hong Kong mentality began to dismantle from the mid-2003 and Hong Kong SAR government began to rethink its relationship with the mainland. Such a change has external and internal reasons. First, with close connections with the global economy, Hong Kong's policy making is much dependent on its external conditions and needs to make reference to other localities' strategies and actions (Ho, 2000) . In the period of post-1997 AFC, Hong Kong faced heavy urban competition from cities in the Greater China. Taking the strategy of "Siliconization" as an example, almost all localities in the Greater China attempted to re-position themselves as "the next silicon valley" (Sum, 2002a (Sum, , 2002b . Although Hong Kong proposed to develop itself into an "e-hub" (Jessop & Sum, 2000) , Taiwan and cities in South China also sought similar strategies, for examples, Taiwan as a "science inland" and Shenzhen as a "gateway for information technologies" (Sum, 2002a (Sum, , 2002b . On the other hand, Hong Kong was no longer the only pacemaker/gateway for China, with rapid economic development, further reform and opening in the mainland China. The growing Yangtze River Delta region, especially the emergence of Shanghai as international shipping center and international financial center, challenges the position of Hong Kong as an international logistics center and international financial center to some degree (Huang, 2009; Jiang & Shen, 2010) . Since 2007, Shanghai port has surpassed Hong Kong port in terms of container throughput, becoming the second largest container port in the world (Fig. 2) . Hong Kong's neighboring cities, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, no longer position themselves as the "back factory" of Hong Kong (Yeung, Shen, & Zhang, 2006) . Shenzhen has proposed to develop the headquarters economy, and build itself into a regional financial center and a logistics center in Asia-Pacific region in its strategy of Shenzhen 2030. Shenzhen port will catch up Hong Kong port soon (Fig. 2) . Guangzhou is very aggressive in building competitiveness and attempts to regain its position as the "dragon head" of South China (Xu & Yeh, 2005) . A large number of mega-projects have been initiated by Guangzhou since 2000. Guangzhou made massive investment in infrastructure such as metro system in preparing the Asian Games in 2010. Under such a competitive context, a debate on whether Hong Kong was being marginalized emerged among Hong Kong's top officials and scholars. The Bauhinia Foundation Research Centre, a think-tank of Hong Kong's chief executive, released a policy research report titled China's 11th Five Year Plan: Opportunities and Challenges for Hong Kong in 2006 . The report suggested that Hong Kong should take an active stance in cross-boundary cooperation in order to maintain Hong Kong's competitiveness in a globalizing era . Second, Hong Kong's economic recovery has benefited greatly from China factor. To help Hong Kong's economy, the Central Government has introduced a series of preferential policies. In June 2003, the Central Government and Hong Kong SAR Government signed the first bilateral free-trade agreement e the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). It covers three aspects: trade in goods, trade in services, and trade and investment facilitation. Under the CEPA, the potentially huge market of the mainland is opened in advance of all foreign investors to Hong Kong investors with lower entrance thresholds than China's commitments to WTO (World Trade Organization) (Yeung & Shen, 2008) . Taking trade in goods as an example, almost all Hong Kong domestic exports to the mainland enjoyed zero tariffs. Only in the first two years of implementation, Hong Kong's businesses saved a total of around HK$ 240 million in tariffs (Hong Kong SAR Government, 2006) . In addition, the Individual Visit Scheme was also introduced by the Central Government in 2003 to boost tourism in Hong Kong. Prior to the scheme, mainland visitors could only travel to Hong Kong on business visas or in group tours. Under this scheme, residents in 43 mainland cities are allowed to visit Hong Kong on an individual basis. Such scheme has greatly stimulated the growth of tourism industry for Hong Kong. It was estimated that tourist income generated by the scheme reached over HK$ 60 billion in 2004, accounting for 55% of the total income of the industry . It is clear that Hong Kong's economic recovery has greatly benefited from supports from the Central Government. Third, the attitude of Hong Kong society toward crossboundary cooperation has become more positive. The public opinion is important to the policy making of Hong Kong government which depends on the feedback and support from the public. During the early years after 1997, many Hong Kong residents worried about the future of Hong Kong under Chinese sovereignty. Thus they took a negative stance toward cross-boundary cooperation (Shen, 2004) . With the economic recovery, Hong Kong residents' attitude toward cross-boundary integration has become more and more positive. A consensus around close cross-boundary integration has emerged in the society. According to a survey conducted in February 2002, 43.6% and 35.9% of Hong Kong residents had intention to purchase property or to work in the mainland in the coming five years respectively (Yeung & Wong, 2002) . With the changing internal and external political, economic and social conditions, Hong Kong government began to re-regulate its regionalization strategy. Hong KongeShenzhen region moved steadily toward a formal regional society with the regional institutional building, indicating the active participating of city state in regional integration. Different from its western counterparts, Hong Kong's re-regulation was mainly caused by internal and external forces, instead of the first movement. Hong Kong government began to engage in cross-boundary cooperation actively after mid-2003. A formal framework for inter-city cooperation and a joint vision were developed by the two cities in subsequent years. In 2004, two city governments signed the Memorandum of Enhancing Hong KongeShenzhen Cooperation and 8 sectoral cooperation agreements on tourism, technology and legal service, etc. It is called "1 plus 8" in brief. The memorandum and agreements can be seen as a formal institutional framework for Hong KongeShenzhen integration, symbolizing the involvement of governments in the regionalization. Under the framework of "1 plus 8", inter-city cooperation has sped up. Some cooperative initiatives in education and technology have made satisfactory progress, such as establishing branches/campuses in Shenzhen by several universities from Hong Kong and cooperation between Shenzhen Hi-tech Industrial Park and Hong Kong Science Park. According to the framework of "1 plus 8", working meetings at mayor-chief secretary level and Hong KongeShenzhen Cooperation Forums (HKSCF) have been held to promote inter-city cooperation regularly. Thus a direct communication channel has been set up between the two cities without the need to liaise via the Central Government. 1 Four HKSCFs were held in 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010 . The forum was jointly organized by The Central Policy Unit of the Government of the Hong Kong SAR, the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone Research Association and the China Development Institute (Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, 2007) . The forum involves research institutes and city governments and is a kind of cross-boundary policy networks in the region. In the second HKSCF held on 13 August 2007, the Acting Chief Executive of Hong Kong SAR advocated developing a world-class metropolis jointly. The emergence of HKSCF and "1 plus 8" indicate that Hong Konge Shenzhen cooperation has moved beyond the market-led model of "front shop and back factory" toward government-involved or institution-led regional integration. A formal regional society is in the making. Under the framework of "1 plus 8" and HKSCF, two city governments have intensively interacted, and frequently exchanged their views on Hong KongeShenzhen cooperation during the past several years. Building Hong KongeShenzhen Metropolis has become a joint vision of cooperative development for two cities. In the "Policy Address 2007e2008: A New Direction of Hong Kong" by Hong Kong's Chief Executive, jointly developing a world-class metropolis with Shenzhen was emphasized as a new direction of Hong Kong (Hong Kong SAR Government, 2007) . Shenzhen has also re-positioned itself as "a world-class metropolis with Hong Kong" in its new urban master plan and Shenzhen 2030 Urban Development Strategy. Under the discourse of Hong KongeShenzhen metropolis, Hong KongeShenzhen integration has sped up. Among ten projects for economic development listed in the Chief Executive's Policy Address 2007e2008, two are related to Hong KongeShenzhen cooperation. They are airport cooperation and joint development of Lok Ma Chau Loop area and two joint task forces were set up in December 2007 respectively. Regarding the airport cooperation, two airports are complementary (Vogel et al., 2010, chap. 10) . Hong Kong and Shenzhen airports mainly offer international and domestic flights respectively. According to Shenzhen airport's statistics, 3 million mainland visitors to Hong Kong used Shenzhen A frontier closed area (FCA) was set up around Hong Konge Shenzhen boundary in 1951 to halt the influx of immigrants from the mainland and to restrict illegal activities. The development within the area has been frozen since then. Hong Kong government has been active in the joint development of the boundary area. It reduced the size of the FCA from 2800 ha to 400 ha in January 2008. Only areas around boundary control points remained as the FCA. It is expected that the released land from the FCA will provide ample space for Hong KongeShenzhen cooperation. Lok Ma Chau Loop Area is a key area for joint boundary development. 2 Two working groups, including environment, planning and project working group and development direction working group, were set up under the task force of joint development of boundary area. Some consultancy studies had been conducted by the task force. The case of building Hong KongeShenzhen metropolis suggests that city governments can play an important role in the transition from market-based informal regional society to formal regional society. Under the discourse of Hong KongeShenzhen metropolis, a three-tier regional institution has been formed in the crossboundary space. Three tiers include HKSCF, cooperation agreements and ad hoc task forces on inter-city cooperation. Such new regional institution is still a loose, flexible and partial form of crossboundary governance. Its institutional capabilities should be enhanced, perhaps with a more fixed form of governance structure or denser policy networks. The active participation of the governments aims to facilitate cross-boundary economic and infrastructure development and planning. This can take place well before reaching higher level of regionness: the formation of a regional community or the regional institutionalized polity. This means that economicoriented regionalization can take place even when two societies do not share a clear identity or the same value. The slow development of cross-boundary regional community, which will be discussed in the next section, is another difference from European case. Close interaction with loose regional identity: a long journey toward a cross-boundary regional community The huge cross-boundary investment in Shenzhen by Hong Kong has certainly induced intense social interaction between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The number of Hong Kong residents working in the mainland, excluding those who stay in Hong Kong under one month in the six months before or after enumeration, increased from 52. 3 thousands in 1988 3 thousands in to 157.3 thousands in 1998 3 thousands in and 196.5 thousands in 2009 3 thousands in (CSD, 1999 3 thousands in , 2009 Kong SAR government's strategy of "building Hong Konge Shenzhen metropolis" has been widely accepted by the public. Regional collective identities and consensus building are important for the formation of new regions and cross-boundary regional community. However, closer economic and social interactions between the two cities do not induce the emergence of a cross-boundary regional identity among two cities' residents. Thus the regional community did not emerge after the regional society. According to our surveys, many Hong Kong and Shenzhen residents know very little about the other city. 32.4% (Hong Kong) and 5.4% (Shenzhen) of respondents never pay attention to other city's events while 56.9% (Hong Kong) and 62.5% (Shenzhen) pay their attention to the other city only occasionally. Although there is a close social linkage between two cities as mentioned above, only 7.7% (Hong Kong) and 13.2% (Shenzhen) of the respondents think that they are familiar with other city's social, institutional and economic milieus. As high as 91.8% (Hong Kong) and 84.3% (Shenzhen) are not familiar with the other city. According to our surveys, it is still very much a reality for many residents on both sides that Hong Kong and Shenzhen are divided by a rigid boundary with full immigration and custom control ( Table 2 ). The different values, different political institutions, different economic regulations and the historical and cultural gap between two cities are conceived as constrains for Hong KongeShenzhen integration by most respondents. Clearly, there is no clear cross-boundary identity and the sense of regional community is weak among residents in the emerging Hong KongeShenzhen metropolis.
