A framework is constructed for this research (see Figure 2 ). This framework consists of linked outer and inner parts. The outer part suggests that the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 1989 Tian'an Men Square Incident affected tourism and the economy through two channelsthe event itself and visa control. An event can have either positive or negative influences on the demand for tourism. Organized special events normally bring positive effects by enhancing awareness, building new images and attracting additional tourists. Crises, however, bring negative effects to the destination. Both types of events can jointly affect the industry and the economy as a whole. Visa restrictions generally have negative economic influences on the destination economy. When considering these two factors (the event itself and associated visa restriction), the overall impact can either be negative or positive. This framework is applied to both types of events using the same modelling approach. The inner part depicts the connection of the two modelling methods in the assessment-the econometric and CGE models. The input of the econometric models includes economic variables such as tourists' income, tourism price, the substitute prices and the dummy variables, which capture the tourism influence of the one-off events, especially the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 1989 Tian'an Men Square Incident. The outputs (results) of the econometric models are the tourism impacts of one-off events which are the inputs of the CGE models. The econometric models provide the key parameter-price Figure 2 . A Framework of this Research elasticity for the CGE models. The outputs (results) of the CGE models are the economic impacts. These refer to the welfare losses/gains at the macroeconomic level and to the economic indicators such as the values of labour and capital, imports and exports and prices at the industry level. This research presents the economic impact of the Beijing Olympics and the Tian'an Men Square Incident on tourism and its related sectors by considering the events themselves and the visa restrictions in force at the time. Song et al. (2012) identified the input parameters, which are the price elasticities of tourism demand by international tourists. The effects of the two events on the demand for tourism in China in terms of both arrivals and receipts form the basis of the CGE modelling exercise in the following section. The econometric models used by Song et al. (2012) are known as the autoregressive distributed lag model. The Tian'an Men Square Incident, the 2008 Olympics, visa restrictions, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the 2008 financial crisis were accounted for by dummy variables. Table 1 presents the price elasticities of inbound tourism demand to China and Beijing from various source markets. The CGE approach captures the circular flow of income. It models and simulates the behaviour and activities of each economic agent such as the production, household, government and export-import sectors. It also captures the interactions and feedback among these agents. These economic activities include intermediate and final consumptions, supply and demand, and international trade. The theoretical bases of CGE models are utility maximization subject to resource constraints (demand functions) and profit maximization subject to resource constraints (supply functions). As the model includes hundreds of functions, a high-level modelling system known as the general algebraic modelling system and its subsystem, the mathematical Lofgren, Harris, and Robinson (2002) . The main functions used in the models are the Leontief, the Cobb-Douglas, the Constant Elasticity of Substitution and the Constant Elasticity of Transformation technology. The details of these functions can be found in Li et al. (2011) . One of the key elasticities is the price elasticity of tourism demand, taken from Song et al. (2012) . The averages of the price elasticities from the ten key source markets are À0.802 for China and À0.878 for Beijing (see Table 1 ). The three models are applied to evaluate the economic impacts of the economic losses/gains of tourism demand estimated from the econometric models. Therefore, unlike the standard model structure by Lofgren et al. (2002) , the three CGE models are extended to include activities pertaining to the demand for tourism. In the extended models, a new sector (the tourism exported sector) and a new representative consumer (international tourists) are introduced. The tourism exported sector produces tourism products and services such as transportation, hotel rooms and catering services for international tourists. Details of modelling tourism using CGE models are discussed in Wattanakuljarus and Coxhead (2008) and Li et al. (2011) . This extension requires the introduction of two additional functions into the standard model. Aggregate export of tourism-related goods is represented by a Cobb-Douglas function: where p T is the aggregate price of international tourism; k is a shift parameter; p i is individual product price; and P i a i ¼ 1. The demand for the Cobb-Douglas aggregate product is a function of the aggregate tourism price: where q T is the quantity demanded by inbound tourists; Q T is the benchmark quantity demanded by inbound tourists; e is the exchange rate; and l is the price elasticity of tourism demand. The resulting economic impacts are shown at both the macroeconomic and industry levels. At the macroeconomic level, instead of evaluating the economic impact in terms of GDP, which has been used in most studies, this paper uses equivalent variation (EV) to measure the welfare impacts of the economic losses/gains due to the two one-off events in monetary terms. EV is defined here as ''the amount of extra income that, at unchanged prices, would allow consumers to reach the utility that they actually reach as a result of a policy change, or other exogenous shock'' (Fane & Ahammad, 2003, p. 176) . EV is ''the amount of income that would have to be given to (or taken away from) the economy before the policy change (or an external shock) to leave the economy as well off as the economy would be after the policy change'' (Andriamananjara et al., 2004, p. 17) . Besides, EV is the economic indicator that is more frequently used to measure welfare in CGE modelling in the literature (see Ahmed, 2008; Fane & Ahammad, 2003; Margaret & Mabugu, 2008; Ye, Lee, & Chen, 2006) . Maximising gross state product at the state level or GDP at the national level is second best to maximising the economic welfare. GDP includes increased income earned by non-resident owners of capital, non-resident labour and the government through taxes while welfare can measure the wellbeing of local residents (Abelson, 2011) . In this case, EV might have more policy implications than GDP as policy strategies on a one-off event should depend largely on the effect of welfare on local residents. Table 2 shows that both the events themselves and the associated visa restrictions related to the 1989 Tian'an Men Square Incident and the 2008 Beijing Olympics reduced China's inbound tourist arrivals and decreased China's tourism receipts from the ten origin countries under consideration. Visa restrictions were responsible for larger losses to tourism receipts, which were $-88.232 million as a result of the 1989 Incident and $-963.860 million as a result of the 2008 Olympics.
