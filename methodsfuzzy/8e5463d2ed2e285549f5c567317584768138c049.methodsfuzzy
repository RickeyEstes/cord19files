All herds in the study population were tested serologically for influenza A specific NP antibodies by ELISA (ID Screen Â® Influenza A Antibody Competition test, IDVET, Montpellier, France, according to manufacturer's instructions) and samples tested positive in the ELISA were retested for hemagglutinating antibodies using hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assays according to the method described in the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals (Office International des Epizooties, 2008). In addition, where there was suspicion of an active infection due to reported clinical signs in pigs or humans with pig contact, herds were tested for presence of viral RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) (World Health Organization. The WHO Collaborating Centre for influenza at CDC Atlanta, 2009; Robert Koch-Institut, 2011).
