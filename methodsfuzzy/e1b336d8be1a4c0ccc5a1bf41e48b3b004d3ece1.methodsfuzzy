We used data on confirmed cases on the cruise ship as published on a daily basis by public sources 17, 18 to calibrate a model and estimate the basic reproduction number from the time sequence and amplitude of the case rates observed. COVID-19 is thought to have been introduced by an index case from Hong Kong visiting the ship between the 21 st to 25 th of January, 2020. We thus used the date of 21 st January 2020 as the first time point, t=0, assuming the index case was infectious from the first day on the ship. The estimates of and the associated Covid-19 incidence on the cruise ship was derived using a compartmental model estimating the dynamics of the number of susceptible ( ), exposed ( ), infected ( ), and recovered ( ) individuals, adapted but modified from a published COVID-19 study. 19 We analyzed two instances of the model assuming respectively: (1) a homogenous population (3700 individuals), and (2) a stratified population of crew (1000 individuals) and guests (2700 individuals). The model used a relationship between the daily reproductive number, , and to infer the transmissibility and contact rate across the whole cruise ship population by the relationship: where the infectious period equals to one over the recovery rate ( ), In the homogeneous model, the infectious period, i, of COVID-19 was set to be 10 days based on previous findings. 8 In the situation of no removal (ill persons taken off the ship to be isolated in a Japanese hospital), the incubation period (or, the latent period), was estimated to be approximately 5 days (ranging from 2 to 14 days). 20 In order to model the removal/isolation and quarantine interventions, we implemented time dependent removal and contact rates as described in Table 1 . We performed additional sensitivity analysis reducing the to 3.7, an estimate of the average value across mainland China studies of COVID-19. 9 We further estimated a counterfactual scenario of the infections dynamics assuming no interventions were implemented, in particular no removal and subsequent isolation of ill persons. We assumed an infectious period of 10 days, with a contact rate remaining the same as in the initial phase of the outbreak. Additionally, in the stratified model of crew and guests, the contact rate was assumed to be different due to the assumption that crew could not be easily quarantined as they had to continue their services on board for all the passengers and possibly had more homogeneous mixing with all the passengers, whereas passengers may be mixing more within their preferred circles and areas. We kept the transient change in the contact rate and the removal of all PCR confirmed patients starting from the 3 nd and the 5 th of February respectively as in the first model. Parameters are described in Table 1 . The model describing a homogeneous population onboard can be described by: where denote all susceptible people on the cruise ship, all exposed, all infected and all recovered or removed, and where denotes the whole population. The model describing a stratified population onboard can be described by: where denotes susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered or removed, , and the subscript and are indicating guest and crew respectively. Overall, we assume mortality is negligible. Models with interventions were calibrated to reports of total infection occurrence, while models simulating the counterfactual scenarios where left with the na√Øve parameter settings (no countermeasures). The net effects of the countermeasures where estimated as the difference between the counterfactual scenario and the model with the interventions. Model parameters are described in Table 1 are the results of the calibration to the observed cumulative incidence data. The contact rate between persons on the cruise ship was calibrated to give the best fit to data with a reduction of 70% The predicted cumulative number of cases over time from this model described the observed cases well, but overestimated the cumulative case incidence rate initially ( Figure 2 ). This allowed to compensate for reporting bias in the initial phase, given that the proportion of testing of all passengers was patchy while at the end of the study (19 th In a sensitivity analysis we modified the to 3.7 (and consequently ) as this has been reported the average basic reproduction number from studies of COVID-19 in China. 9 However, from our simulation, even in the absence of any intervention, such a low cannot explain the rapid growth of incident cases on the cruise ship ( Figure 3 ). This sensitivity scenario excluded countermeasures from the model making it unrealistic that such a low value could be the true value in the cruise ship situation with confined spaces and high homogeneous mixing of the same persons. The estimate with the lower value also omitted to consider the strong interventions put into place, making it even more unrealistic. We additionally modeled a scenario stratified by crew and guests whereby we assumed the parameter values of transmission risk to be lower for crew to guest than for guest to crew ( Table 1 ). The
