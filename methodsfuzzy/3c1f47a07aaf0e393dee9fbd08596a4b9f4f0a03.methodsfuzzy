The current study was designed and carried out in Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. 179 human sera were randomly selected from McGregor's Keneba Sera Collection (1966) (1967) (1968) (1969) (1970) (1971) (1972) (1973) (1974) (1975) (1976) (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) . Different domains of MSP-2 were synthesized using GST gene fusion system and crude schizont extract was prepared from in vitro culture of Plasmodium falciparum. Total IgG and IgG subclass responses were measured by ELISA after a checkerboard study was performed for each antigen to standardise the concentration of both antigens and antibody. Results: Most sera predominantly recognized the immunodominant regions of the molecule. Increasing the age was negatively correlated with parasitaemia and positively with IgG antibody responses and haemoglobin levels indicating that total IgG responses to domains 2, 3 and crude schizont extract coincidental to a decrease in parasitaemia density and frequency. IgG3 response was the main IgG in those who had no parasitaemia at the final time point. IgG2 and IgG3 were increased amongst individuals with no parasitaemia and with higher levels of haemoglobin at higher ages that had exposure to parasite over a long period of time. Conclusion: IgG3 was the main antibody, mainly against domain 3 of MSP-2, that was associated with increase in haemoglobin levels and decrease in parasitaemia suggesting that domain 3 is preferred over other domains and crude schizont extract in presenting a clearer picture of immunity against malaria. These results could be an evidence of protective role of these antibodies against malaria disease and, therefore, domains 3 can be considered as reliable vaccine candidate antigens. Objectives: Our country is hyperendemic for dengue virus infection. Serosurveillance indicates that almost all native adults have been infected, mostly asymptomatically. A long-held mechanism explaining clinical severity involves sequential infections by different serotypes. Even though some of its peer flaviviruses are known to reside persistently within the host and contribute to host illnesses, dengue virus has not been shown to behave in a similar fashion. As dengue is a haematotropic virus, we sought to find evidence of its persistence in the bone marrow of previously-infected persons. Methods: We studied patients clinically suspected or known of haematologic malignancies and indicated to have diagnostic bone marrow initial or follow-up studies. A fraction of cellular marrow was employed for RNA extraction and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by dengue-specific primers. Serologic assessment by haemagglutunation inhibition test (HI) for dengue and chikungunya viruses and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for dengue was performed on the study of bone marrow study and, in some cases, 14−60 days later, to minimise a chance of including patients with recent dengue infection. Serologic interpretation was made according to standard criteria. Demographic data of all patients were analysed, especially for the history of recent febrile illnesses which could be due to dengue infection. Background: Intermittent preventive antimalarial treatment of infants (IPTi) is considered a promising malaria control strategy. Among the factors that influence the extent of protection provided by IPTi are malaria endemicity, seasonality, drug resistance patterns and the IPTi application schedule. Studies modeling the effect of malaria incidences on IPTi are scarce. The aim of this study was to describe how far protective efficacy of IPTi depends on the incidence rate of clinical malaria. Methods: One-thousand seventy infants were enrolled in a registered controlled trial on the efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine based IPTi in the Ashanti Region, Ghana. In an ecological analysis, malaria incidence rates in the first year following IPTi were stratified by the village of residence and month of birth of participants and the spatiotemporal variation of the malaria incidence on the protective efficacy of IPTi was analysed. Findings: The rate of malaria attacks during the first year of followup was highly dependent on the month of birth and on the village of residence of the children. Protective efficacy of the first IPTi administration (IPTi-1) correlated with malaria incidences in children living in a particular village or born in a particular month (r2 0.48, p < 0.04 and r2 0.63, p < 0.003, respectively). A corresponding trend was seen after the second (IPTi-2) and third (IPTi-3) drug administration. Interpretation : Correlations between IPTi efficacy and malaria incidences may have implications on IPTi implementation strategies I will discuss the role mathematical modelling in pandemic planning and response. Recent research examining whether antiviral prophylaxis and social distance measures could be used to contain a nascent pandemic at its point of origin will then be reviewed. Containment is potentially feasible, but requires rapid detection of the initial transmissible case cluster and a rapid and organised response to each new case. These may be demanding criteria for much of SE Asia. If containment fails, slowing spread becomes a policy priority and in that context I will discuss the potential impact of restrictions on international travel. To conclude, I will discuss pandemic mitigation strategies which make best use of limited vaccine and antiviral supplies. The following were performed: agr-typing by ScaI-RFLP method; investigation of virulence genes by multiplex-PCR; antibioticresistance by the disk diffusion method according to the CLSI guidelines. Results: MRSA was isolated in 8% of cases. All staphylococci showed the following resistance profile: 37% for ERY, 21% for GM, 5% for DA, 14% for CIP, 11% for LVX, 12% for RD, 6% for TE and 3% for C. Among the strains, agrII was the most prevalent (35%) while agrI-III-IV were isolated approximately in 21% of cases. Within the agr-groups the distribution of virulence determinants revealed a common conservedcore background (sarA-rnaIII-spa-icaA-hla-hlg), whereas accessorygenes were always represented, in different combinations, and copossessed significantly. Capsule type-5 was prevalent in agrI while type-8 was prevalent in agrII/III. agrI was associated with the presence of many virulence-genes such as cytotoxins and proteases (sea-lukE-splB) and in one agrI isolate lukS/F-PVL was found; agrII also possessed an adhesin sdrE; agrIII was associated with adhesins and enterotoxin (fnbA-sea-cna), the exfoliatinA was never detected; agrIV possessed the cytotoxin lukE, adhesin cna and exfoliatinA, eta. Protease gene (splB) was always found associated with cytotoxin lukE in agrI-II-III and, mostly, sdrE adhesin was associated with these. A frequent inversecorrelation was found between cna and lukE-splB in all agr-groups and a close correlation was observed between cap8 and cna in agrIII-IV. Conclusion: Our data demonstrated for the first time an increase of MRSA in our centre; furthermore, CF-persistent infections were not associated with a distinct agr-specificity group or a diffused antibioticresistance of the strains, but rather S. aureus isolates have a complex distribution and combination of virulence determinants which contribute to S. aureus pathogenicity in CF patients. Objectives: Proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus is increased after infection in animal models of pneumococcal meningitis. Methods: To evaluate neurogenesis in patients with acute infection of the central nervous system, brain sections of 18 patients dying from bacterial meningitis and 8 patients dying from non-neurological diseases were investigated by immunohistochemistry. Results: In the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation, the density of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA)-expressing cells was higher in patients with bacterial meningitis compared to the control group (p = 0.02). Furthermore, the number of cells expressing the immature neuronal marker protein TUC-4 was increased in brain sections of persons dying from bacterial meningitis compared to control cases (p = 0.004). In the subventricular zone, no difference of cells expressing TUC-4 was observed between both groups (p = 0.39). Immature neurons expressing TUC-4 had no morphological features of apoptotic cell death and no evidence of DNA fragmentation. We searched for randomised trials comparing the efficacy of aminoglycoside antibiotic treatment to non-aminoglycoside antibiotic in patients with infection in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, databases of ongoing trials and conference proceedings. Two reviewers assessed trial eligibility, quality and extract data. Pooled relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous data. We conclude that each of the three major clones can readily be demarcated from other A. baumannii members, and that molecular diagnostics could be developed to identify them rapidly. Analysis of the recombination/mutation rate shows that nucleotides do not change by recombination more frequently than by mutation, showing that recombination is unlikely to disrupt the clonal frame of the clones, which can therefore be expected to be stable over very long periods of time. Objectives: Molecular epidemiology studies of clinically relevant microorganisms frequently focus on a comparison between the assigned types of different typing methods. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the correspondence between types produced by different methods. This may be useful not only for the comparison of the genetic backgrounds of the particular set of isolates under study but also to produce a broader view of how the results of the different typing methods are related. To achieve this goal, a framework of measures for the quantitative comparison of typing methods results was developed (Carriço et al., Illustration of a common framework for relating multiple typing methods by application to macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes, J. Clin. Microbiol. 2006) and is now implemented in a free-access web-based interface, on which users can analyse their data anonymously and retrieve the results. Methods: To facilitate the use of the framework developed, a web-based interface was implemented to provide researchers with a user-friendly interface to compare their typing methods results. On the website, we also provide a set of Bionumerics TM scripts to allow the users to implement the proposed analysis on their Bionumerics databases while offline. A. Bartoloni (Florence, IT) Antibiotics are the most commonly purchased class of drugs in lowresource countries, where the infectious diseases are extremely frequent and the bacterial infections are the major cause of death, especially in childhood. The phenomenon of microbial drug resistance, which represents a global public health problem, is particularly serious in these countries, as resistance rates are even higher than in industrialised countries and the therapeutic options are often unavailable or too expensive. Surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility is a key element to provide updated information on the magnitude and trends in resistance, and to plan and monitor intervention strategies aimed at preserving the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics. In low-resource countries, effective surveillance programmes are difficult to implement for a number of reasons, including scarce financial resources, lack of laboratory facilities and, where laboratories do exist, lack of quality control, reliable reagents and adequate supervision. In these settings, the development of reliable and low-cost alternative methods could facilitate the implementation of large-scale surveillance. There is an increasing agreement about the importance of extending the surveillance of antibiotic resistance to the commensal microbiota of humans and animals. This bacterial population, although not being a specific target, is continuously exposed to the selective pressure generated by antimicrobial chemotherapy and may become a potential reservoir of resistant strains that can cause infections, and of resistance determinants that can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria carried by healthy individuals is considered an indicator of the spread of antibiotic resistance that could also be useful to predict the emergence of resistance in pathogenic bacteria. In this perspective, resistance patterns of some members of the commensal microbiota, such as the faecal Escherichia coli, have been evaluated in various epidemiological settings. For this purpose, different microbiological approaches have been implemented and evaluated as useful tools to conduct large scale resistance surveillance studies and to monitor resistance control programmes in a cost-effective manner. The study included 704 isolates: 301 from years before the introduction of the vaccine (1998-1999) and 298 post-release (2003) (2004) . Key demographic data, serotype and resistance profiles for 5 antimicrobial classes were analysed. Strains displaying resistance (defined as non-susceptibility based on CLSI breakpoints) to >2 classes were considered MR. Statistical analysis was carried out using linear mixed effects models for repeated measures. Results: After adjusting for age, invasive status and region, a multivariate logistic regression model showed that non-vaccine (NV) isolates are 1.9 times (1.3−2.7, p = 0.03) more likely to be MR in the post-vaccine release period. When serotypes are divided into groups according to the prevalence of multiple resistance and their propensity to expand (i.e. become more prevalent after introduction of the vaccine), we found that the serotype 19 not F was 4.4 times more likely to expand (2.1−9.1) than other NV serotypes (p < 0.0001). A group formed by serotypes [11, 15, 33, 35] is also more likely to increase in prevalence, OR 2.4, 1.3−4.5, p = 0.01) than other NV serotypes. Details in resistance prevalence and proportions at each point in time are shown in the table. Conclusion: Groups of both vaccine and non-vaccine serotypes can be categorised according to their propensity to expand and to acquire MR. Serotype 19F slightly decreases in prevalence but increases in MR rate, while serotype 19 not F both increases in prevalence and acquires resistance at a rate that is proportional to the expansion process. About half of the NV serotypes rapidly increased both in prevalence and resistance. Vaccine serotypes (excluding 19F) decreased in prevalence but not in resistance.  The new RT-TB BioRad kit includes an IS6110-BRD04 probe (instead of IS6110-Tamra in the previous version) that increases by 10-fold the sensitivity of detection of the IS6110 amplicons. Fifty-two clinical samples collected in routine (sputa, bronchoalveolar and gastric lavages) were included. DNA preparations and RT PCR reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. A new specific software developed by the manufacturer was used for the automated analysis of the RT-TB amplification results. Results: In the present study, 2 samples were found to contain inhibitors (as indicated by the negative amplification signals of the corresponding internal controls). The 8 smear positive samples included in the study were all found to be IS6110-POS and RD9-POS. Interestingly, 4 of them showed <1 acid fast bacilli per field on microscopic examination. The good sensitivity of the test was confirmed by 2 smear negative samples which were both found to be IS6110-POS and RD9-POS by the RT-TB assay. These two samples were confirmed to be positive for M. tuberculosis by the Roche Amplicor assay. Finally, the 40 remaining smear-negative samples were all found to be negative for IS6110 and RD9, suggesting that the increased sensitivity of the new IS6110-BRD04 probe does not impair the specificity of the test.
