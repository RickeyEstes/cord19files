Alternatives to real-time monitoring of the amplification process for quantifying nucleic acids that are less demanding of imaging and computational capabilities could prove more amenable to low-cost POC diagnostics in resource-limited settings and may open new opportunities for NAATs for identification of bacterial flora and gene expression profiles. One such method that has been recently developed by our group consists of an amplification-diffusion conduit (ADC), which provides a spatial indication of the concentration of target nucleic acids in the sample (Figure 3 ) [38] . This "nuclemeter" chip, shown in Figure 3a , hosts four ADCs to illustrate a serial dilution effect of target concentration on device operation. Briefly, the ADC extends from the embedded silica membrane that captures NA, as described above, and which provides the source of template NA for amplification and diffusion. The ADCs are typically 330 µm wide × 330 µm deep × 12 mm long and are pre-filled with a stabilized gel (hydroxypropyl)methyl cellulose (HPMC) to retard diffusion and with all the ingredients needed for the amplification reaction, sans the target itself. The ADC is maintained at the amplification temperature (65 °C for the LAMP process). As the target diffuses into the conduit, it amplifies. Eventually, the amplification process runs its course (i.e., saturates). After a short time from the beginning of the process, the reaction-diffusion conduit can be viewed as consisting of two regions: A region in which the reaction has been completed and a region into which the target nucleic acids have not yet diffused and the amplification reaction has not yet started. When an intercalating dye is used, the first region of the ADC, in which the reaction has been completed, emits fluorescence and appears as a column of light, while the second region, in which the amplification reaction has not yet occurred, appears dark (Figure 3b ) which can be imaged with a Smartphone camera (Figure 3c) . The two regions are separated by a relatively sharp reaction front. Once the initial reaction region has saturated, the reaction front moves with a constant velocity v (Figures 3d-1,d-2 ). That is, the position of the front is given by the equation t0) . X0 is the front location when the amplification process near the ADC's entrance has saturated and t is time (Figure 3d (Figure 3d-4) , it serves a similar role to that of the threshold time in real time machines. ADCs operating with known quantities of target molecules can serve to calibrate the length of the fluorescent column to enable quantification. The emission from multiple columns can be conveniently recorded with a smart phone camera.
