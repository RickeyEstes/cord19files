Patients and blood collection. This is a retrospective study examining miRNAs as risk/protection factors in relation to a diagnostic outcome. Prostate cancer patients were recruited as part of the Prostate Cancer Supportive Care and Patient Outcomes Project (ProsCan), a randomised controlled trial of a psychological intervention for newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients 72, 73 for the discovery cohort (N = 42) . The validation cohort of prostate cancer patients (N = 40) were recruited as part of the Australian Prostate Cancer BioResource (APCB) consisting of 3,100 patients including 350 men recruited via collaborations with urologists, 2,000 men from the QLD node of APCB, and 750 men recruited in collaboration with The Cancer Council Queensland 73 . Healthy male control participants for both the discovery and validation cohorts (N = 37) were recruited through the electoral roll as part of the Queensland Men's Health Study (QLDMen), a cross-sectional population-based study consisting of 1,300 men including 450 age-and postal code-matched controls to complement participants in the ProsCan and APCB studies. The patient and control numbers were selected depending on the availability of samples from participants with similar clinical characteristics, as well as with reference to previous studies that we have discussed in our published review article 20 . The patient group in each cohort is further divided into metastatic (≤5 and >5 years survival) and non-metastatic patients. This subdivision ensured that each category of participants i.e. metastatic, non-metastatic and healthy in each cohort consisted of about 20 samples. Follow-up data for ~10 years was available for the patients including those who survived for less than 5 years after prostate cancer diagnosis. Details of age, PSA levels, clinical grade (Gleason scores), pathologic state (TNM stages) and family history have been collected to document clinical characteristics of the disease. ~19-22% of the patients and ~11-15% of the healthy controls in each cohort had a family history of prostate cancer. 52.4-62.5% patients and 84.2-88.9% controls in both the cohorts did not have any family history of prostate cancer. Blood samples were collected within 1-4 months of diagnosis and within 1-2 months of treatment, which included radical prostatectomy, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), brachytherapy and/or radiation therapy, from patients in the discovery cohort (N = 61). Similarly, for the validation cohort (N = 58) blood was collected within 1-4 months of diagnosis and 1-2 months of any treatment, or at the time of radical prostatectomy for most of the patients, and for some collection was done after 4-9 months of hormone deprivation. Although miRNA levels are affected by the treatment regimen of patients, we have tried to mitigate this effect by keeping the timing of sample collection consistent between the discovery and validation cohorts, using appropriate statistical methods and relying on the stability of miRNAs in body fluids 74 . Blood samples were collected in ethylene-di-amine-tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) containing tubes and processed within 1 hour of collection. The resultant plasma samples were stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction was performed, and transported on dry ice to the Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI) for RNA isolation. All clinical samples were obtained from patients and controls after their written informed consent. The study was performed in accordance with the institutional ethics approval-Approval numbers: 3629H (ProsCan), 1000001165 (APCB), and 0600000216 (QLDMen) from the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and the Cancer Council Queensland (CCQ). Plasma RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis. Prior to RNA isolation, plasma samples in the discovery and validation cohorts were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4°C and all plasma samples were screened for haemolysis using a Nanodrop ND-1000. For miRNA screening (Fig. 7) , eight random plasma pools (two pools per group) were generated before RNA extraction for the control group and three patient groups in the discovery cohort using a randomising web-based tool (https://www.miniwebtool.com/random-picker/). In this way 150 µl of plasma required per pool was generated by dividing the total volume required (i.e. 150 µl) by the number of samples per pool. For example, the control group consisting of 19 healthy males was divided into two plasma pools of 10 and 9 controls. Each of the 10 controls in pool-1 contributed 15 µl of plasma, while each of the 9 controls in pool-2 contributed 16.67 µl of plasma. Similarly the three patient groups consisting of 12, 16 and 14 samples were divided into 6 × 2, 8 × 2 and 7 × 2 samples/pool respectively, and each patient per group contributed 25 µl of plasma in pools-3 and 4, 18.75 µl of plasma is pools-5 and 6, and 21.43 µl of plasma in pools-7 and 8. Therefore, total RNA was extracted from 150 µl of pooled plasma from each of the two pools per patient/ control group in the discovery cohort, and eluted in 14 µl of RNase-free water using the miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. 0.5 µg of bacterial ribosomal RNA (Roche) was added to each sample for increased RNA recovery, and 3.5 µl of miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Spike-In Control i.e. cel-miR-39 (at 1.6 × 10 8 copies/µl) (Qiagen) was added to each sample as an internal control for plasma miRNA expression profiling and normalisation of qRT-PCR data as previously described 19 . 5 µl of extracted RNA from pooled plasma samples was reverse transcribed using the miScript II RT kit with HiSpec Buffer (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Fig. 7) . miRNA PCR array analysis. The resultant 20 µl cDNA, diluted in 90 µl of RNase-free water, was applied to the 384-well miScript miRNA PCR array (Qiagen) containing forward primers for the detection of 372 cancer-associated miRNAs and duplicates of 6 internal controls (Fig. 7) . The qRT-PCR was run on a ViiA7 system (Applied Biosystems) and the data analysed using the GeneGlobe data analysis software (Qiagen). The cel-miR-39 Spike-In control was used by the program to calibrate the data sets, and the miRNA PCR array data was normalised by the global mean normalisation method 75 . This method automatically calculated a global C T mean for the miRNA targets that were commonly expressed in all the samples being analysed after an initial calibration to the exogenous cel-miR-39 Spike-In control. For plasma miRNA expression profiling in individual samples, the cel-miR-39 Spike-In control was used as an internal control for normalisation of qRT-PCR data as previously SCIenTIFIC RePoRtS | (2018) 8:6653 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-24424-w described 19 . Fold regulation represents fold change values generated during miRNA expression profiling in a biologically meaningful way. The fold change was calculated using the equation 2 −∆∆CT . For fold regulation, the fold change values less than 1 (meaning that the miRNA is down-regulated) was transformed by calculating the negative inverse. Therefore, the values remain the same while their representation is changed only. All C T (number of cycles required for fluorescent signal to cross the set threshold; inversely proportional to miRNA levels) values >30 were considered as a negative call by the software. Therefore, the lower limit of detection was ≤30 C T to avoid false positives. The final values of miRNA expression levels were generated in a biologically meaningful way as fold regulation i.e. the negative inverse of fold change. A 2.5 fold-regulation cut-off was used to shortlist deregulated miRNAs. One of the challenges of miRNA profiling from plasma samples is the lack of established housekeeping genes for data normalisation. In general, miRNA profiling experiments use small noncoding RNAs, such as small nuclear or nucleolar RNAs (snRNAs/snoRNAs) for data normalisation 76 . However, they may not serve as ideal reference genes because snoRNAs and snRNAs do not share the same properties as miRNAs in terms of expression, transcription and processing 75 . Therefore, normalisation of data was performed using exogenous cel-miR-39 as an internal control and the global mean normalisation approach 16,19 . qRT-PCR validation. RNA extraction from individual plasma samples (N = 61) and cDNA synthesis were performed as described previously and the resultant 20 µl cDNA diluted 11x in 200 µl of RNase-free water. qRT-PCR of the shortlisted mature miRNAs was performed using miScript Primer Assays (forward primers) (Qiagen), Universal Primer (reverse primer) (Qiagen) and the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen) with 1 µl cDNA input for each 5 µl reaction in triplicates. The miRNA reverse transcription control (miRTC) primer assay (Qiagen) was used as an internal control to determine the reverse transcription efficiency for each sample. The qRT-PCR data was analysed using the externally spiked-in cel-miR-39 (Qiagen) as the housekeeping Figure 7 . Study design and discovery and validation cohort study profiles.

SCIenTIFIC RePoRtS | (2018) 8:6653 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-24424-w gene 19 with a 2 fold-regulation cut-off used to identify deregulated miRNAs. The results obtained from the discovery cohort were further validated in the validation cohort (N = 58) using the same method as described above. Statistical analyses. Unpaired Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to identify differences in miRNA expression levels between patients and healthy controls in cohorts 1 and 2. The p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction. Univariate logistic regression was performed to determine the ability of individual miRNAs to predict disease occurrence in prostate cancer patients. The RNA concentration was set as an offset variable to account for the differences in the starting amounts of RNA. The capacity of combined miR-NAs to distinguish between patients and healthy controls was evaluated by ROC curve analysis in the discovery (N = 61), validation (N = 58) and combined (N = 119) cohorts to increase the predictive power of the analysis. For ROC analysis of the miRNA panel, binary logistic regression analysis was performed for all four miRNAs at the same time enabling calculation of predicted probabilities of the miRNA combination which was further used to generate AUC values for the miRNA panel. The AUC is an effective and combined measure of sensitivity and specificity that describes the inherent validity of diagnostic tests. The ROC curve corresponding to progressively greater discriminant capacity of diagnostic tests is located closer to the upper left-hand corner away from the diagonal reference line 77 . A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered to be significant for all analyses. All statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism 7.02, SPSS and RStudio in consultation with qualified statisticians from the Queensland Facility for Advanced Bioinformatics (QFAB, UQ) and the Research Methods Group (RMG, QUT). An overall summary of the methodology is presented in Fig. 7 . TCGA data and cell line expression analysis. Prostatic expression of the shortlisted miRNAs was assessed in a publicly available cohort comprising of 52 tumour and 52 non-malignant prostate tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The expression of the significantly deregulated miRNAs in prostate tumour tissues was evaluated in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines by qRT-PCR. RNA was extracted from cell lysates using the miRNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions followed by cDNA synthesis using the miScript II RT kit with HiSpec Buffer (Qiagen). qRT-PCR using the miScript primer assays (Qiagen) and QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen) was performed as described previously. Cell proliferation and migration assays. For cell proliferation assays 15,000 LNCaP and 10,000 PC3 cells were plated per well in a 96 well plate and allowed to grow for 4 hours before transient transfection with miRNA complexes as described above. For cell migration assays 96-well ImageLock plates (Essen BioScience) were coated with 40 μl Poly-L-ornithine (Sigma) overnight. 50,000 cells/well were plated the next day and allowed to form a confluent monolayer for 24 hours. The cells were treated with 10 µg/ml Aphidicolin (Sigma) (an antimitotic reagent) for 1 hour to minimise the effect of cell proliferation on migration. Wounds were created using a 96-pin WoundMaker (Essen BioScience) and the growth media was aspirated to remove cell debris. The cells were treated with 50 µl of miRNA complexes per well for half an hour before replenishment with 150 µl of RPMI containing 5% FBS. Percentage confluence (for proliferation) and relative wound density (for migration) was measured every 2 hours for 72 hours using the automated IncuCyte live cell imaging system (Essen BioScience) following the manufacturer's protocol. All treatments were performed with six replicates in three independent experiments. Data analysis was performed using the IncuCyte software. Pathway Analysis. In silico network-based visual analysis was performed using the miRNet web-based platform to identify target genes and pathways potentially altered by the miRNA signature 21 . Forward mapping, which allows users to map from miRNAs to their targets, was performed by uploading the list of miRNA IDs of interest. After data processing, the results were presented as an interaction table with each row corresponding to one miRNA and its target. The table also provided hyperlinks to the corresponding databases from where the miRNA-target interactions were derived, together with references to PubMed literature. Network visualisation was performed through functional annotations based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database, and the hypergeometric algorithm was used for enrichment analysis of input data to generate a list of miRNA target genes. This was further used as an input for in depth analysis using IPA (Qiagen) to determine top canonical pathways, upstream regulators and molecular and cellular functions of the miRNA target genes. The association of the deregulated target genes with disease phenotype was also confirmed using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) computational method. The differential expression of the target genes in normal (N = 23) vs prostate carcinoma (N = 65) tissues were determined using the Oncomine cancer microarray database and integrated data-mining platform 68 . A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered to be significant for all the analyses. Validation of in silico target genes of miR-152-3p. LNCaP (300,000 cells/well) were plated in a 6 well plate for treatment with miR-152-3p and negative control mimics for 72 hours as described above for the collection of cell lysates (Norgen). This was followed by RNA extraction (Norgen), cDNA synthesis (Life Technologies) and qRT-PCR (Life Technologies) to determine the relative fold expression of target genes of miR-152-3p using target-specific primers (Sigma). Data was normalised to the housekeeping gene RPL32 and further normalised relative to the non-targeting negative control to determine relative fold expression. The differences in target gene expression between the negative control and miR-152-3p treated cells were assessed using an Unpaired t test, N = 3 (*p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001 and ****p ≤ 0.0001).
