Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs (combined into one tube) were collected from a symptomatic patient meeting case definition for possible infection with COVID-19 pneumonia on January 26, 2020. Extraction of viral nucleic acids from clinical sample was performed with a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen #52906) as described by manufacturer. Extracted RNA samples were DNAse-treated and tested via real-time polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 using both the Charit√© Virology and Hong Kong University protocols and confirmed positive on January 27 th , 2020. 7 mNGS preparation and analysis On January 29, samples were received for cDNA library preparation. Since clinical specimens are obtained from suspected COVID-19 cases as part of the national outbreak response, requirement for informed consent was waived for pathogen identification and characterization. mNGS libraries were prepared from the viral RNA extracted from the sample. cDNA was converted to Illumina libraries using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (E7645) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Library size and concentration were determined using the 4150 Tapestation system (Agilent, MA, USA). External RNA Controls 103 Consortium collection (ThermoFisher, 4456740) spike-in controls were used as markers of potential library preparation errors and for input RNA mass calculation. Sample was sequenced on an Illumina iSeq100 instrument using 150 nucleotide paired-end sequencing. A water ("notemplate") control was included in library preparation. Microbial sequences from the sample are located in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive. Raw fastq files were uploaded to the IDseq portal, a cloud-based, open-source bioinformatics platform to identify microbes from metagenomic data (https://idseq.net). The filter steps and microbial data are accessible at http://public.idseq.net/covid-19?utm_source=bioarxiv&utm_medium=paper&utm_campaign=covid-19. Potential pathogens were distinguished from commensal flora and contaminating microbial sequences from the environment and reagents by establishing a Z-score metric based on a background distribution derived from four non-templated "water-only" control libraries. Data were normalized to unique reads mapped per million input reads for each microbe at both species and genus levels. Taxa with Z-score less than 1, base pair alignment less than 50 base pairs, and reads per million (rpM) less than 10 were removed from analysis. Geneious Prime 2020.0.5 was used for separate de novo assembly and annotation of the draft SARS-CoV-2 genome. In subsequent runs to achieve higher coverage of the viral genome, two additional steps were taken: 1) the subsampling filter of the nonhost reads was removed and 2) targeted enrichment of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence using author/funder.
