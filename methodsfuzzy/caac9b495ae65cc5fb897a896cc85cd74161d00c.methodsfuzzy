During the containment phase of the pandemic A(H1N1) outbreak in Hong Kong from April 26, 2009 , to June 18, 2009 , all patients with laboratory-confi rmed pandemic A(H1N1) infection, under the local Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance, were compulsorily isolated. 16, 17 Only those isolated in the three hospitals of Hong Kong were included in this study. 17 The study was approved by our institutional review board. In addition to drawing blood for routine hematologic and biochemical tests, a chest radiograph was taken if clinically indicated. If nasopharyngeal specimens tested positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the infl uenza A matrix gene and the pandemic A(H1N1) hemagglutinin gene, but negative for H3 and seasonal H1, 5 days of oseltamivir was recommended at a dosage adjusted for age and renal function. 18 Those who refused oseltamivir treatment were regarded as cases for our study of natural viral load profi le from upper respiratory specimens, whereas those treated were controls. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data were retrospectively retrieved from the computerized Clinical Management System for entry on a standard form for analysis as previously described. 19 The number of classic initial clinical symptoms as predictors of infl uenza infections were used to correlate with viral load in respiratory specimens. 20, 21 These included the presence of fever (temperature Ն 37.8°C), cough, sore throat, nasal symptoms, myalgia, and headache. 20, 21 (15/118, 12.7%), and Ն 4 days (20/118, 16.9%) post symptom onset. The mean (range) interval between symptom onset and oseltamivir initiation was 2.1 (0-8) days. Six patients had nonspecifi c complaints of nausea, vomiting, or loose stool on the initial 2 days of oseltamivir therapy but it was diffi cult to differentiate from clinical symptoms of pandemic A(H1N1) infection. None reported major side effects from oseltamivir therapy. The viral loads of NPA, NPS, or NTS at different intervals post symptom onset in nontreated patients were comparable ( Fig 1 A , Table 2 ), whereas significant differences were observed at days 2 to 3 to days 8 to 9 post symptom onset in treated patients ( Fig 1 B , Table 3 ). In treated patients, viral loads of NPA were higher than those of NPS and NTS, and signifi cant differences were observed at day 3 to 5 post oseltamivir initiation but not at 1 day before to 1 day after oseltamivir initiation ( Fig 2 , Table 4 ). Similar fi ndings were observed in days 3 and 4 post oseltamivir initiation in those who received oseltamivir Յ 2 days post symptom onset, and day 2 post oseltamivir initiation in those who received oseltamivir . 2 days post symptom onset. When only NPA specimens are analyzed, viral load of NPA was signifi cantly lower in treated than nontreated patients at day 5 post symptom onset irrespective of the relation between oseltamivir initiation and the day post symptom onset ( Fig 3 A , Table 5 ). When oseltamivir was initiated Յ 2 days post symptom onset, a greater rate of viral load reduction in NPA of treated patients ( 2 0.638 [95% CI, 2 0.809 to 2 0.466] vs 2 0.409 [95% CI, 2 0.663 to 2 0.185) log 10 copies/mL/d post symptom onset) than that of nontreated patients was observed. Similar rate of viral load reduction in NPA was observed in those who received oseltamivir Յ 2 and . 2 days of symptom onset ( 2 0.711 [95% CI, 2 1.057 to 2 0.366] vs 2 0.695 [95% CI, 2 0.892 to 2 0.549] log 10 copies/mL/d post oseltamivir initiation). At day 6 post oseltamivir initiation, . 90% of these patients had undetectable viral load level in respiratory specimens ( Fig 3 B ) and their viral load level of NPA was undetectable, which was 1 day earlier than those received oseltamivir . 2 days post symptom onset. Moreover, the viral load of NPA in those who received oseltamivir Յ 2 days post symptom onset was consistently lower than that of nontreated patients, and signifi cant differences were observed at days 4 to 5 and days 6 to 7 post symptom onset ( Fig 4 , Table 6 ). Among the 385 viral load tests performed, 19 out of 73 samples from 13 nontreated patients and 133 out of 312 samples from 96 treated controls had concomitant peripheral blood taken for hematologic test. The viral load level was inversely correlated with concomitant lym count (Pearson r 5 2 0.365, P , .001), Hb level (Pearson r 5 2 0.234, P 5 .008), and plt count (Pearson r 5 2 0.207, P 5 .019) in treated patients.
