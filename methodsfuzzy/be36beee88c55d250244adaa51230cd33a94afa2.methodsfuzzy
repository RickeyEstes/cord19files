(2017) as part of this research can be found in the Supplemental Files, as well as on public resources as specified in the Data and Code Availability section below. Local cases and incidence rates PAHO is the primary source for information regarding Zika virus spread in the Americas, as well as suspected and confirmed cases per country and territory (PAHO, 2017a). Weekly case counts, however, are made available as cumulative cases, not the number of new cases per week. These data are often problematic for reconstructing outbreak dynamics because of reporting delays and 'spikes' (e.g., more than one week of cases submitted after weeks of no reporting). Curated weekly case counts per country and territory are presented as bar graphs (not as datasheets) (PAHO, 2017a) . Therefore, to increase the accuracy of calculating Zika virus incidence rates, we captured screenshots of the 2016-2017 weekly Zika virus case (suspected and confirmed) distributions, and extracted the case counts using Web Plot Digitizer v3.10 (https://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer), which we previously validated . Extracted case numbers were recorded in .csv files and aggregated per month for this analysis. Yearly human population numbers were retrieved from the United Nations Population Division (https://population.un.org/wpp/) and were used to calculate monthly local Zika virus incidence rates (suspected and confirmed Zika cases/100,000 population) per country and territory. Monthly Zika cases and incidence rates are available at: https://github.com/andersen-lab/paper_2018_cuba-travel-zika. The Zika-Epidemiological Report for Cuba (PAHO, 2017c) , which was last updated on 25 September 2017, states: ''Between EW [epidemiological week] 1 and EW 52 of 2016, a total of 187 laboratory confirmed cases of autochthonous Zika virus disease were reported. No information is available on the distribution of cases by epidemiological week. No new information was provided since EW 52 of 2016.'' This shows that Zika cases from Cuba were not reported to PAHO in 2017.
