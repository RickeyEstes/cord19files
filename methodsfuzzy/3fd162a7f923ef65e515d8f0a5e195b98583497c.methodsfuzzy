Expression, purification and refolding of the CASV GP2 constructs Synthetic DNA fragments encoding "CASV-GP2(254-351)" and "pIICASV-GP2(267-351)" (described in Results) were obtained from a commercial supplier (Genewiz, South Plainfield, NJ). The genes were cloned into pET22b vectors (Novagen, Madison, WI) using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, producing the expression plasmids pJFK3 and pJFK4, respectively. pJFK3 and pJFK4 were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 42°C. These cells were grown in 1 l cultures of 2 × YT or LB broth at 37°C to an OD 600 of~0.6. Protein expression was then induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The culture was incubated at 37°C while shaking at 220 rpm for an additional 14-18 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) for 1-2 h at room temperature. The cell debris was pelleted by ultracentrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for 1-2 h at room temperature. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of 6 M GdnHCl in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 50 mM imidazole. The proteins CASV-GP2(254-351) and pIICASV-GP2(254-351) were eluted with 6 M GdnHCl in PBS containing 250 mM imidazole. The second purification step was performed on the eluted protein by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac (Hesperia, CA) C18 column (10 μM, 250 mm × 21.2 mm) with water/trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile mobile phases. The collected pure protein fractions were combined and lyophilized, then redissolved in 10 ml of 6 M GdnHCl in PBS. The proteins were refolded by stepwise dialysis into 100 mM glycine (pH 3.5) with 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (~4 h), followed by dialysis into 10 mM sodium acetate [pH 4.1 and pH 5.3 for CASV-GP2(254-351) and pIICASV-GP2(254-351), respectively] (~18 h). The protein yield from 10 l of cultures was~0.3 mg and~4.0 mg for CASV-GP2(254-351) and pIICASV-GP2(254-351), respectively.
