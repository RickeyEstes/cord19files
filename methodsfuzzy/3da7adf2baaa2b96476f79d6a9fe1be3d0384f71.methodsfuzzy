Twelve nurseries from the municipality of Copenhagen were recruited in Autumn 2012. The number of divisions in each nursery ranged from two to six, and the number of children ranged from 25 to 120. The total number of children was 587, and their ages ranged from six months to three years. Nurseries were questioned about their policies and procedures for hygiene and cleaning of toys before commencement of the study, and randomized to intervention (N ¼ 6) and control (N ¼ 6) groups. The intervention took place from January to March 2013. A commercial cleaning company (Berendsen A/S, Søborg, Denmark) collected toys and linen every two weeks from nurseries in the intervention group for cleaning in their industrial cleaning facility. Linen and toys suitable for washing machines were washed at 46 C and subsequently disinfected with Turbo Oxysan (Ecolab, Valby, Denmark). Toys that were not suitable for washing machines were either immersed in a disinfectant [Sirafan M, Ecolab (1e3% benzalkonium chloride, 1e3% didecyldimethylammonium chloride and 5e7% alcohol ethoxylates)] or cleaned manually with a microfibre cloth using the same disinfectant (Sirafan M, Ecolab). The toys were subsequently rinsed with water, air dried and returned to the nurseries. Cleaning of toys was staggered to ensure that the children had some toys to play with while others were being cleaned. Absence data and disease patterns were recorded for each child on a daily basis from December 2012 to March 2013. The number of absent children and the reason for absence (as reported by the parents) was recorded by the staff within the following categories: respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections, other illnesses, or day off.
