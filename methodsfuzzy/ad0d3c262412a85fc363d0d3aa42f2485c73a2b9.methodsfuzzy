Construction of a Markov chain for DNA sequence. Let P = [p ij ] denote the transition probability matrix of a discrete-time Markov chain 34 . Each state transition probability p ij is defined as follows: ij n j n i 1 where X n indicates the actual state at time n(n = 1, 2, 3 …) and s i is the i th state of S distinct states. In the context of a DNA sequence, the number of states is S = 4 which corresponds to the four nucleotide symbol set Since the transition probabilities are unknown initially, they must be estimated based on the observed sequence. Here, we estimate the parameters of the Markov chain by taking the frequencies of occurrence of all possible nucleotide pairs for each sequence 42 . If the total number of each adjacent nucleotide pair (s i , s j ) in the sequence is denoted by N s s i j , then the 1 st -step transition probability from state s i to state s j is estimated as represents the total number of each adjacent pair starting from nucleotide s i and ending with nucleotide s j . Presented above is the 1-step Markov chain. The k-step Markov chain can be calculated through the 1-step Markov chain, which is known as the Chapman-Kolmogorov process. Let = P p [ ] k ij k denote the transition proba- www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ bility matrix of a discrete-time Markov chain in state j after k steps from state i. Each state transition probability p ij k is defined as follows: For any three events, A, B and C, the following identity is known: ][ ] By interpreting A as X n+k = s j , B as X n+t = s r and C as X n = s i , we have Hence, the matrix with the elements p ij The selection of step k plays an important role in capturing rich evolutionary information from the DNA sequence. In the context of a DNA sequence, the k th -step transition probability can be written as: The p ij k can be calculated using the above Eqs (2 and 4). Fuzzy measure and fuzzy integral for the k th -step nucleotide sequence. Fuzzy set theory 43 is particularly suitable for modelling imprecise data, whereas fuzzy integral is highly appropriate for representing the interaction among different information sources. The concept of fuzzy integral with respect to a fuzzy measure has been proposed by Sugeno in 1974 44 . In this section, we propose the use of the fuzzy integral incorporating with the transition probability matrix, where the elements of transition probability matrix are taken as fuzzy membership degree. be the finite set of k th -step nucleotides starting from nucleotide s i and ending with nucleotide s j estimated from the observed sequence. Let X, Y ⊆ F and R(F) be the power set of F. A fuzzy measure μ is a real valued function: μ: R(F) → [0, 1] satisfies the given condition, The mapping μ → y ij ij is termed a fuzzy density function. The fuzzy density function can be interpreted as the importance of element y ij in determining the set F. By definition of the fuzzy measure μ, the measure of the union of two disjointed subsets cannot be directly computed from their disjointed component measures. In other words, the fuzzy measure value of a given subset is not simply the summation of the measures of its elements. Therefore, to define a fuzzy measure, we need to know the fuzzy densities of each element of the measured set and the measure of each combination. This measure can be provided by an expert or extracted from the problem definition. However, when dealing with a set of numerous elements, this job may become noisy, tedious or even unfeasible. A possible solution to this problem is to use a λ -fuzzy measure. A λ -fuzzy measure 45 fulfills the criteria of a fuzzy measure, and has an additional property: for all If the decreasing order criterion is not fulfilled, then F should be reordered so that the decreasing order relationship holds, and further investigation will be based on the modified relationship. Let μ: R(F) → [0, 1] be a fuzzy measure. Then, the fuzzy integral of h with respect to the fuzzy measure μ is The fuzzy integral considers the significance provided by every element of a given set, and the importance of each subset of elements (i.e., the fuzzy measure) plays an important role in its decision-making process. The combination of the extracted information and the importance of the provided source convert the fuzzy integral to an appropriate form for information fusion. This theory has the potential to address uncertainties associated with issues related to data extraction and their processing procedures. Therefore, the theory has been widely implemented in feature extraction and classification 45,46 . Fuzzy integral similarity and distance matrix for sequence comparison. The fuzzy integral similarity is based on the distance of the k th -step nucleotide pair frequency with respect to the conservation level of the position between two sequences. In our case, the k th -step nucleotide pair frequency at all sixteen positions in the transition probability matrix is taken as the fuzzy membership degree. Let P k 1 and P k 2 be two k th -step transition probability matrices. The fuzzy integral function find the similarity level of the nucleotide pairs between k th -step transition probability matrices. We constructed a fuzzy integral function h, which is given as: Additionally, the fuzzy measure function find the maximum level of conservation of the nucleotide pairs between k th -step transition probability matrices P k 1 and P k 2 , which favours the importance of better conserved positions. Taking advantage of the properties explained above, we can construct a λ -fuzzy measure μ using the fuzzy density of each element μ ij . In this case, At this stage, we should apply Eq. (7) to find λ and apply the value of λ in Eq. (6) to finally obtain the fuzzy measure μ. The result generated by Eq. (6) satisfies the given criteria (a) and (b) of the fuzzy measure. After generating h and μ, we obtained the fuzzy integral similarity by applying Eq. (8) . In fuzzy integral similarity, greater importance is given to the higher degree of membership which is calculated via the fuzzy integral with respect to the fuzzy measure. It is based on fuzzy technology and is intended to deal with the intrinsic uncertainty involved in sequence comparison tasks. Fuzzy integral similarity does not require any additional parameters, which makes it fully automated and robust. The fuzzy integral similarity measure provides the similarity score between the two k th -step transition probability matrices. Next, we will define a distance measure between two k th -step transition probability matrices P k 1 and P , k 2 which is given as follows: Similarly using Eq. (12), we can calculate the distance measure for all pairwise combinations taken from an n number of DNA sequences. Finally, a symmetric distance matrix is generated. This matrix is used as an input for the neighbor program in the PHYLIP package 38 for phylogenetic tree construction. Algorithm. This section describes the algorithmic aspect of the proposed method. The entire algorithm contains three stages. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Stage 1: Calculation of the transition probability matrix through Markov chain: Stage 2: Calculation of fuzzy integral similarity between two − k th step transition probability matrices: Algorithm 1. k th -step transition probability matrix. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Stage 3: We integrate stage(1) and stage(2) for phylogenetic construction: time complexity of the proposed algorithm. To determine the time complexity of a given algorithm, we assume that all operations took the same unit of time. The whole computational process consists of three stages. In the first stage, we calculate the transition probability matrix from the raw DNA sequences. The time complexity of stage (1) is O(m 3 nk + nl), where l is the average length of the DNA sequences, n is the total number of DNA sequences, m is the number of bases and k is the k th -step transition probability matrix. In the second stage, we calculate the fuzzy integral similarity between the two m × m transition probability matrices generated in stage (1) . The time complexity of stage (2) is O(m2 m ). In the third stage, we integrate stage (1) and stage (2) to generate a distance matrix. Let k = h be an optimal step that satisfies condition (8) in algorithm (3). Therefore, the total time complexity to generate the final distance matrix at the h th optimal step is:
