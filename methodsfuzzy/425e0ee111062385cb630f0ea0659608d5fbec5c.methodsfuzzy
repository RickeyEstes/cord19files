This study was conducted between December 2016 and March 2017 in the Pediatric Pulmonary Clinic at Tawam Hospital (Al Ain, UAE). It was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the UAE University -College of Medicine and Health Sciences (ERH 2015 3235 15 111). Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of all participants. Children 3-6 years of age, with a diagnosis of asthma, were eligible to participate in the study. The clinical diagnosis of asthma was made by the pediatric pulmonologist, based on the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) criteria. 8 Asthma staging ranged from mild to moderate, according to severity level and if the children required either ICS alone or in association with either LABA or montelukast. The study was explained to the parents of all eligible patients, and, if they agreed to the procedures, their children were enrolled in the study. The control group consisted of age-matched children without asthma, mainly relatives of our co-workers. Immunization was up-to-date in all the studied participants. Children were excluded from the study if they had significant illnesses, such as chronic lung disease of prematurity, cystic fibrosis, congenital heart disease, immune deficiency, or upper airway anomaly. Demographic, medical, and vaccination data were reviewed. History of asthma symptoms was obtained using a modified global asthma network questionnaire. 9 For the assessment of symptoms of viral infection, we used a validated Common Cold Questionnaire (CCQ). 10 This questionnaire inquired about the presence of fever, chills, muscle pain, watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, cough, and chest pain during 2 days prior to specimen collection; each complaint was scored as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). The GINA assessment of asthma control was used to assess the level of asthma control over the past 4 weeks. 8 This instrument scored the presence (1) or absence (0) of each of the 4 clinical variables, day symptoms, night symptoms, reliever use, and exercise limitation. A score of zero indicated well-controlled asthma, 1-2 partly-controlled asthma, and 3-4 uncontrolled asthma. Forced oscillation technique (FOT) was used to assess airway resistance using a commercial device (tremoFlo™ C-100, tremoFlo software, version 1.0.34 build 32; Thorasys Medical Systems, Montreal, QC, Canada), as previously described. 11 Briefly, measurements were performed with the child sitting upright with the head in a neutral position, the cheeks supported, and the nose clipped. The child was instructed to breathe tidally through a mouthpiece. Data were collected over several seconds and the average of 3 acceptable measurements (coefficient of variation ≤15%) was taken. Airway resistance at 5 Hz (R5, in cmH 2 O.s.L −1 ) was expressed as R5 z-score. 11 sample collection and processing Multiple (1-3 and 4-6 weeks apart) nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from each patient between December 2016 and March 2017 (Tables 1, 2, S1, and S2). For controls, each participant had only 1 sample collected between January and March 2017 ( Table 3 ). The specimens were stored at −70°C until analysis, which was performed using the All-plex™ Respiratory Full Panel Assay (Seegene Biotechnology Inc., Seoul, Korea) as instructed by the manufacturer. 12 The assay was composed of four panels and utilized a multiplex one-step real-time PCR to identify 16 viruses (with three influenza A subtypes) and seven bacteria.
