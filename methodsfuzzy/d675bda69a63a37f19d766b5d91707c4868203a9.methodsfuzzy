The complete spike glycoprotein gene sequences of SARS-CoVs or SARS-CoV-like viruses download from NCBI GenBank database. GenBank accession numbers see Table 1 . Multiple sequences of nucleic acid or amino acid were aligned by ClustalW 1.83 (Thompson et al., 1994) . Phylogenetic trees were constructed by MEGA3.1 (Kumar et al., 2004) (Neighbor-Joining (NJ) for gene and protein sequences), PAUP* 4.0b2 (Swofford, 2002 ) (Maximum likelihood for gene sequences) and MrBayes 3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001 ) (Bayesian inference for gene and protein sequences). The FIPV-X06170 (Feline infectious peritonitis virus) was used as an outgroup within the spike gene data set. SARS-CoV and FIPV are known to be highly identical Fig. 1 . NJ trees of the newly occurred, animal-origin and previous epidemic SARS-CoVs. Red hollow circle indicates genotype T isolate, red solid circle indicates genotype C isolate, both from human in previous epidemic. Yellow solid triangle indicates animal-origin virus in previous epidemic. Blue solid circle indicates newly occurred virus. Purple hollow triangle indicates an out-group. Left tree: the tree was constructed using the p-distance of nucleotide difference. Bootstrap = 5000. The length indicated number of nucleotide difference per site of the spike gene. Right tree: the topologic tree was constructed using the p-distance of nucleotide difference. Bootstrap = 5000. Below table: * the genetic distance between SARS-CoV GD03T0013 and three groups. Here, genotype C composed of 43 isolates, genotype T composed of 76 isolates, animalorigin virus composed of SARS-CoV SZ1, SZ3, SZ13 and SZ16. Table 1 The variant locations and substitution types in the spike protein sequences throughout the spike gene sequence (Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004) .
