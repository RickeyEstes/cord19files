Many of the diseases that currently impact human health are complex diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. These diseases involve several genes as well as environmental interactions that contribute to disease pathogenesis. While some of the genes that contribute to these conditions are known, there are unidentified SNPs and expressed qualitative trait loci (eQTL) that contribute to disease. Phenotype-driven screening programs to create random mutations and screen for desired phenotypes may be an optimal method for gene discovery-based applications. By screening for desired phenotypes, one may be able to make novel genetic associations with the screened phenotype.
