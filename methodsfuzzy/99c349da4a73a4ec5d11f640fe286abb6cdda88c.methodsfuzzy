Duplex RT-PCR assays were performed with all nasal wash specimen samples. The RT-PCR method and its validation procedure have been described previously [24] . In summary, nucleic acid extraction was performed after addition of an internal control (RNA viruses: phocine distemper virus; DNA viruses: artificial plasmid) with an Xtractor gene nucleic acid extraction robot (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with an Invisorb virus RNA HTS 96 kit (Invitek, Berlin, Germany) and a Corbett DX DNA extraction kit (Qiagen). The input volume was 200 l and output was set to 100 l. For RNA viruses, a random-primed reverse transcription reaction was performed with 57 l of RNA (MultiScribe RT [Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA]). RT-PCR was performed with an in-house assay adapted from the Erasmus Medical Center (courtesy of Dr M. Schutten, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) on an ABI 7500 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). The PCR reaction was terminated at 45 cycles. Each reaction tube was internally controlled.
