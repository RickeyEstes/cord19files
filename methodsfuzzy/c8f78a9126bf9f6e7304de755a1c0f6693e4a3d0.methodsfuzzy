Using material sourced from domains 1 and 2 of RO-BIS (Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews, Whiting et al., 2016) , we have attempted to identify and address weaknesses in our methodology. We restricted our initial literature screening to a single search engine (WoS), as different search engines employ distinct criteria and weightings to generate search results. In addition, the search terms themselves require alteration across different databases; certain search engines automatically account for similar terms whereas others do not. It therefore becomes difficult to integrate reference lists that have been generated based upon unique algorithms. We considered WoS to be the best available resource for our search due to its status as a human-curated database with itemized, structured entries. Additionally, WoS only provides results from journals indexed by Clarivate Analytics and filters out non-peer-reviewed literature; however, articles from well-known, high-impact-factor journals may be overrepresented in our results. The use of a single search engine may be considered a weakness of the present review. Thus, we have attempted to validate this approach by conducting targeted searches in PubMed to ensure no additional articles were discoverable. First, we ran the exact searches as listed in Materials and Methods in PubMed. Results indicated that no exact match was found for the phrases "reared by the dam," "reared by cows," "reared by the mother," and "calf contact with adults." Therefore, these phrases were removed to ensure that PubMed would not search within the quoted phrases. Our final PubMed search included the following fixed set: ("cowcalf" OR "cow/calf" OR "dam-calf" OR "dam/calf" OR "dam rearing" OR "suckling system" OR "mother rearing") AND (nurs* OR suckl* OR separation OR contact OR "risk factor*") AND (calf OR calves). In addition, the following targeted terms were included: (scour* OR diarr*) OR (cryptosporidi*) OR ("Johne's" OR paratuberculosis) OR (pneumonia OR respiratory) OR (immunity OR "passive transfer") OR (disease OR diseases OR diseased OR infection OR health OR morbidity OR mortality) OR (mastitis OR "intramammary infection*" OR "udder health"). A total of 61 articles were uncovered in these searches; 42 of these were duplicates from our WoS searches. Of the 19 unique articles, 10 pertained to beef cattle or other species and were therefore excluded. The titles and abstracts of the 9 remaining articles were scanned, and 7 were considered to be irrelevant to the main research question. Two full texts were reviewed and neither study made a direct comparison between cow or calf health in suckling or cow-calf contact systems and conventional rearing. PubMed searches were then conducted for all terms that yielded no results in WoS (as listed in Materials and Methods). No additional relevant results were identified. The "Topic" field of WoS generates searches of the article title, abstract, and keywords, but not the body of the manuscript. Papers assessing a variety of risk factors for a given disease may therefore have been overlooked, particularly if the risk factor of interest was not significantly associated with cow-calf contact. Thus, it is conceivable that the results of the WoS queries reported here demonstrate a bias away from the null. Fortunately, this bias is expected to be present in both directions and is therefore unlikely to affect overall conclusions. To counter this undesired selectivity, we searched within reference lists to uncover additional papers. It must be acknowledged that the authors of these papers may be more inclined to cite papers in agreement with their own conclusions, but this type of selection bias is likely to arise in any systematic review using reference lists as additional resources. Similarly, although we placed no restriction on publication year, we did not locate any manuscripts published in 2017 or 2018, since very recent papers tend to have fewer citations (from even more recent manuscripts). In the initial scans of the reference lists, we only selected papers with titles that alluded to a potential comparison of cow or calf health in different rearing conditions. For example, a hypothetical paper titled "Management decisions linked to heightened prevalence of Cryptosporidium oocysts" would have been considered, whereas a paper titled "Cryptosporidium parvum in cattle" would not have been investigated further. We may have missed papers that, in spite of a more general title, had in fact addressed the topic in question. This assessment is unavoidably qualitative. It is not possible to measure the number of primary literature articles that may have been overlooked due to our methodology; this highlights the importance of accurate and descriptive key words in manuscripts as emphasized by De Boer et al. (2014) . We excluded conference proceedings (both papers and abstracts), as well as book chapters, as we could not be certain that these sources had been peer reviewed. We also excluded literature in languages other than English, as we were unable to critically assess the methods and evaluate the results. We are unable to determine to what extent these exclusions affected the conclusions of this review. In the single-herd studies, there was a high variability in what constituted control groups in terms of the level of maternal contact. For example, in 10 of these studies, control calves were given less than 24 h of contact with the dam; in a further 9 studies, control animals were provided with a minimum of 3 d of unrestricted dam-calf contact. The feeding regimens were also different across studies. These discrepancies are likely to have affected conclusions, and thus it is difficult to make direct comparisons between articles. Even in studies seemingly describing the same treatment (e.g., "restricted suckling"), the implementation of these treatments was variable. For example, in Mejia et al. (1998) calves in the "restricted suckling" group were permitted suckling for 30 min after milking (with one quarter left unmilked), twice daily for 6 mo. In contrast, in Fulkerson et al. (1978) , calves were reunited with the dam once per day (for an unspecified amount of time) for approximately 1 mo. Further, in several studies (e.g., Fallon and Harte, 1980; Nocek et al., 1984) , dam-calf suckling is referenced, but the duration of contact between cows and calves in the control group is not described. Several of the older studies had low sample sizes and are more accurately interpreted as case reports. At one extreme, Rigby et al. (1976) presented conclusions regarding mastitis based upon a single cow nursing her calf; however, most of the other studies with small sample sizes were able to enroll at least 30 animals. Due to the variability in study type, methodology, use of controls, and the amount of information provided, it was not feasible to conduct a meta-analysis. We provided risk ratios, prevalence ratios, and odds ratios where possible, but the variation in study methodology prevented us from generating a meaningful estimate of the overall magnitude of the effects considered. Instead, only the direction of association was highlighted, and our discussion is mainly based upon on the number of positive and negative associations. A weakness of this approach is that it weighs equally all studies, regardless of sample size, effect size, and any weaknesses in design and interpretation. It is important to consider that no temporal relationship between management factors (e.g., cow-calf separation) and outcomes (e.g., disease) has been examined in the included cross-sectional studies. Thus, management decisions could plausibly have been implemented in response to the disease in question, rather than representing a risk factor for disease.
