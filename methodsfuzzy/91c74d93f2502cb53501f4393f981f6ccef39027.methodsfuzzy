V+~.G and ceZZ culture. The JHM strain of MHV-4 was provided by L. Weiner (University of Southern California). It was plaque purified in NCTC-1469 cells and then propagated and plaque assayed in L-241 cells obtained from L. Sturman ( Production of nacmochaZ antibadies to JHM'V. Balb/c mice 4-6 weeks of age were primed by ip inoculation of 103 to lo4 plaque-forming units (PFU) of MHV-4 grown in L-241 cells. After 3 weeks, boosting doses consisting of 0.1 ml of a 10% (v/v) extract of virus-infected cells were inoculated ip for 3 consecutive days prior to fusion. Fusion with P3 X 63 Ag8 clone 6531 nonsecretor plasmacytoma cells was done essentially by the method of Kohler and Milstein (1975) as we have described elsewhere . Briefly, lo* spleen cells were fused with lo7 plasmacytoma cells using PEG 1006 at 50% concentration. Cells were diluted in HAT medium and plated out in eight 96-well plates. Wells were observed for 3-4 weeks for hybrid colonies and these colonies were screened for production of antibody to MHV-4. Antibody producing cultures were immediately subcloned by limiting dilution and rechecked. Screening of culture fluids for antiviral antibody was usually done by indirect immunofluorescence on both acetone-fixed and paraformaldehyde-fixed cells. As controls, uninfected L-241 cells and culture supernatant from parental myeloma cells were included in each assay. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was prepared in this laboratory . Clones of each culture producing the highest titers of antibody in vitro were selected for ascites production in pristane (2,6,10,14,-tetramethylpentadecane)-primed Balb/c mice. Spetifiicities of monoclonal immunoglub ulins. Virus-specific antibody concentrations in cell culture and ascites fluids were estimated by indirect immunofluorescence endpoint titration on acetone-fixed target cells. IgG concentrations were estimated by radial immunodiffusion using sheep anti-mouse IgG. Determination of immunoglobulin isotype was determined by agar gel diffusion using subclass-specific antisera (Meloy Laboratories, Springfield, Va.). Immune precipitation. MHV-4 polypeptide specificities of monoclonal antibodies were determined by immune precipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled viral proteins from infected L-241 cells. Previously described methods (Schauffhausen et al., 1978; were adapted as follows. Radiolabeled cytosol extracts of infected and control L-241 cells were prepared by solubilizing 0.5 to 1.0 X 10' infected cells in 2.5 to 5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0; 137 mM NaCl; 1 mM CaCl,; 0.5 mM MgCIB; 1% Aprotinin; 1% Nonidet P 40; and 10% (v/v) glycerol), then centrifuging at 10,000 g for 30 min to remove nuclear debris. A volume of 200 ~1 of cytosol was mixed with 100 ~1 of hybridoma culture fluid or 5 ~1 of ascites fluid and incubated at 37" for 1 hr. Heat-killed, formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus bacteria (SA) in SaC buffer (0.1 Mphosphatebuffered saline, pH 7.2; 0.5% Nonidet P-40; 2 mM methionine; 0.22% sodium azide; 1 mg/ml ovalbumin) were added to each mixture in volumes of 100 ~1 of a 10% (v/ v) suspension, and incubation was continued for 30 min at 22". Pellets were collected by centrifugation at 2500g for 10 min and washed three times in Tris-HCl (0.1 M, pH 9) containing 0.5 M LiCl. The final pellet was resuspended in 100 ~1 of 2% SDS, 1% mercaptoethanol sample preparation buffer and heated at 100" for 2 min. Bacteria were removed by centrifugation and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10.5% gels. Controls included precipitation of polypeptides from uninfected cytosol and inability to precipitate MHV-4 proteins by monoclonal antibodies directed against an unrelated virus (LCMV). Virus neutralization. Virus neutralizing capacity of monoclonal antibodies was quantitated by a semimicro plaque reduction assay. Ascites fluids were first centrifuged at 10,000 g heat inactivated at 56" for 30 min, then preadsorbed with L-241 cells (1 X lo6 cells per 200 ~1 of ascites) for 30 min at 4". Virus was diluted to contain 50-100 PFU in 100 ~1 and mixed with 100 ~1 of diluted antibody. Virus-antibody mixtures were incubated for 1 hr at 4", then plated onto L-241 cell monolayers in 24-well plates (Flow Laboratories, Mc-Lean, Va.). The mixtures were adsorbed for 1 hr and then removed and replaced with culture medium. Agar overlay was not necessary due to the short (~24 hr) incubation period and cell-associated nature of JHMV. Neutralization endpoint titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest antibody dilution which gave a 50% reduction in plaque number (PRD 50%). Controls included ascites fluids containing neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to an unrelated virus. Inhibition of spread of virus in cell cdture. The growth of MHV-4 in L-241 cells is characterized by rapid formation of large syncytia and resultant intercellular virus spread. Effect of virus-specific hybridoma antibodies on spread of virus infection in cell cultures was determined by incubation of infected monolayers with monoclonal antibodies in the culture medium. L-241 cell monolayers in 24-well Linbro plates were infected at 50-100 PFU per well and incubated at 37" for 1 hr. Inoculum was removed and culture medium containing serially diluted monoclonal antibody prepared as described above was added at the concentrations indicated and incubation continued for 22-24 hr at which time plates were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The inhibition titer of monoclonal antibody was expressed as the highest dilution which inhibited the number of visible plaques and syncytia by 50%. Inhibitory effect of virus-specific monoclonal antibody on syncytium formation was also visualized microscopically by indirect immunofluorescence staining. After 6,9, and 12 hr of incubation in the presence of monoclonal antibody, coverslip cultures were washed three times in PBS and fixed in acetone. Fluorescent staining for detection of syncytia was performed using monoclonal antibody to MHV-4 nucleocapsid protein (4B-6.2). Surface labeling of mcmoclunal antibody bound to in&ected cells. Cell surface binding of monoclonal antibodies was assessed both by indirect immunofluorescence and by electron microscopic examination of immunoferritin-labeled infected cells. L-241 cells were infected for 1 hr at 37" with MHV-4 in suspension at an m.o.i of 1.0, washed, then incubated at 37" for 6 hr. Cells were then transferred to an ice bath, washed in cold medium, and viable cells enumerated by trypan blue exclusion. Aliquots of 1 X lo6 viable cells were mixed with 100 ~1 of monoclonal ascites fluid at 1:lOO dilution for 30 min at 4". Cells were then washed three times with cold medium and reacted for 1 hr on ice with 50 ~1 of rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to ferritin (Cappel Laboratory, Dorrington, Pa.). After incubation, cells for electron microscopy were washed four times with cold medium, once with PBS, and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.125 M cacodylate buffer and examined as described elsewhere (Knobler et al., 1981) . For surface immunofluorescence cells were reacted with monoclonal antibody as described above, then with sheep anti-mouse IgG coupled to biotin. After 30 min at 4" cells were washed then reacted with FITC coupled Avidin (E-Y Laboratories, San Mateo, Calif.) for 5 min. Cells were then washed and examined using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope equipped for incident illumination.
