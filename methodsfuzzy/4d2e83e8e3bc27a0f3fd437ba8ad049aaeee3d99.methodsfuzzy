Immunocompromised patients with hypoxemic ARF admitted to our closed ICU in a teaching hospital from January 2007 to July 2009 were included prospectively in this cohort study. The MMA was the intervention. The institutional review board of the Clermont Ferrand teaching hospital approved this study and waived the need for informed consent. Immunocompromised status was defined as presence of a disease or treatment known to impair the immune system, such as a hematological or metastatic solid malignancy or long-term corticosteroid therapy, immunosuppressive therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and/or bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus were not included. ARF was defined as a respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute or respiratory distress symptoms or PaO 2 on room air lower than 8 kPa or a need for ventilatory support. The data reported in Tables 1e3 were collected for each study patient. Simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), time in the ICU and vital status at ICU discharge were also collected. 18 All patients were investigated using a previously described diagnostic strategy that relies heavily on noninvasive tests. 19 Most of the patients underwent noninvasive tests for infections, such as sputum examination for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi; induced sputum for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia; serum and blood tests for circulating Cytomegalovirus and Aspergillus; blood cultures; specific PCR tests for herpes viruses on blood and respiratory samples; and urine tests for bacterial antigens. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed when deemed appropriate by the attending physician. BAL fluid was collected as previously described 19 and was used for bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal cultures; RV antigen detection by immunofluorescence; and cytological examination. Echocardiography, chest computed tomography, and thoracocentesis were also performed when deemed appropriate by the attending physician. Clinically documented infection was defined as a strong clinical and radiographic suspicion of pneumonia without microbiological documentation but with either septic shock or complete resolution after antibacterial treatment. 5 Immunofluorescence (Argene, Verniolle, France) was performed routinely to test nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) and BAL fluid for influenza A and B viruses; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1, 2, and 3; and adenoviruses. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was sought starting in October 2007. All respiratory specimens were also investigated for RVs using an MMA based on the Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe-Amplification (MLPA) technology (RespiFinder19Ò, Pathofinder, Maastricht, The Netherlands) that allows the detection and differentiation of 14 respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses A and B; PIV-1 to PIV-4; RSV A and B; rhinovirus; human coronaviruses 229E, OC43 and NL63; hMPV; and adenovirus. 20 Additionally, this MMA detects influenza A H5N1 and four bacteria (Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Bordetella pertussis). Samples were stored at À80 c. Before extraction, 5 ml of an internal amplification control which contained an encephalomyocarditis virus RNA transcript was added into the sample. Nucleic acids were purified from 400 ml of samples with the EasyMag system (Biom » rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and eluted in 100 ml of elution buffer, of which 10 were used for amplification. The three steps of pre-amplification, hybridization and ligation-PCR were performed on a C1000 themocycler (Bio-Rad, Marnes la Coquette, France). The amplified MLPA products were analyzed on an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Fragment sizing analysis was performed with the GeneMarker software (SoftGenetics, LLC, State College, PA). Two clinicians reviewed the medical charts of all study patients to determine the etiologies of ARF. This was made on Table 1 Baseline characteristics, symptoms, chest radiography patterns, need for life-supporting interventions, and outcomes of the 100 immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure and comparaison of patients with and without a positive MMA. the basis of clinical, radiographic, microbiological, and histological findings, according to predefined criteria. 1, 6, 21 The reviewers also aimed at evaluating the clinical significance of RV detection by MMA in these patients. In the absence of validated criteria, this was mainly based on the presence or absence of a definite etiology of ARF, and on the possible interplay between viral infection and this etiology.
