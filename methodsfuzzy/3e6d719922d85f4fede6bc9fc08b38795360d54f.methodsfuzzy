Data analysis concerning virologic (including M. pneumoniae) assessment was performed with the 107 case episodes and the 91 control periods. Differences in the distributions for continuous data, i.e., age, self-perceived health, and illness duration were compared with Independent Sample Student's t-test. Illness duration was not normally distributed, and was log transformed to obtain normality. A chi-square test or a Fisher's Exact Test was used to test the correlation between discrete variables, i.e., sex, influenza vaccination, smoking habits, allergy, sharing an apartment, presence of micro-organisms, symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection, systemic and other symptoms, restriction of activity, fever, medical consultation, hospitalization, episode-related medication, and episode-related antibiotic use. A Fisher's Exact Test was used to calculate the odds ratio for demonstrating a virus in cases with symptoms of acute respiratory infection vs. controls without symptoms of such an infection. Alpha was taken as 0.05 in all analyses.
