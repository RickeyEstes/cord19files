A valuable source of high resolution data on spatial and temporal aspects of the global airline system is Innovata's Schedule Reference Service (SRS) database. The SRS database contains information for 900 different airlines and their 10,935 associated airports in 4700 cities. This database represents approximately 99.9% of worldwide commercial passenger schedules for each tabulation quarter (IATA, 2007 ). An important aspect of these data is that they represent a ''neutral" worldwide schedules database which conforms to global standards put forth by the IATA for data quality control. All elements of the schedule database are thoroughly checked for the accuracy of the IATA flight codes, flight duration, segment continuity and scheduled dates and times. As a result, these data represent an unbiased, globally complete source of airline schedules. More importantly, the inter-state and trans-state biases outlined by Derudder et al. (2005a Derudder et al. ( ,b, 2007a are avoided. Similar to other databases, information regarding route capacity is included. The SRS database reports the average number of seats per week between each scheduled airport pair. In addition, flight frequency is also included. Specifically, the SRS database reports the average number of flights per week, for each quarter, between each scheduled airport pair. In sum, the SRS information provides a micro-level temporal scale database, with global coverage, that includes functional measures of both capacity and frequency between airports. For this paper, quarterly SRS data from 2001-2006 will be used for an exploratory analysis of spatial-temporal change in the global air network.
