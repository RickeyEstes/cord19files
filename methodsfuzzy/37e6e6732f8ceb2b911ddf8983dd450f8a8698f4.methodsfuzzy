Similar to the development of cationic lipids, formulation technologies for siRNA were often designed for the delivery of plasmid DNA and later adopted for siRNA. The formulation used by Felgner and coworkers (Felgner et al., 1987) for cellular transfection was a simple mixture of DOTMA and dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), which together form a complex (lipoplex) with plasmid DNA. Lipoplexes are often microns in diameter and are unstable and difficult to reproduce. They are often formulated with excess cationic charge not only to promote interaction with the plasmid DNA but also to facilitate association with the negatively charged cell surface and subsequent uptake by endocytosis (Stamatatos et al., 1988) . Incorporation of helper lipids such as DOPE is thought to facilitate the release of plasmid DNA into the cytoplasm due to its propensity to adopt the nonbilayer, membrane lytic hexagonal H II phase (Cullis & de Kruijff, 1978) . Despite intensive efforts, however, lipoplexes have not proven to be useful for in vivo applications. The chief reason for this shortcoming is that they are highly toxic due to their positive charge and are quickly removed from the circulation by the fixed and free macrophages of the MPS due to their size and charge. As a result, they do not distribute efficiently to target cells such as tumor cells. These difficulties have led to attempts to encapsulate nucleic acids within an enclosed bilayer membrane that exhibits low surface charge. In the "stabilized antisense lipid particle" method, a solution of the lipids in ethanol is added to an aqueous solution of nucleic acid at pH 4.0 (Semple et al., 2001) . The relatively low pH of the buffer ensures that the ionizable cationic lipid, 1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylammonium propane (DODAP, pKa 6.6), is positively charged for interaction with the nucleic acid. The vesicles are subsequently extruded through polycarbonate membranes to ensure uniform size distribution. Dialysis in buffer at pH 7.0 removes residual ethanol in the mixture and deprotonates the ionizable cationic lipid, creating a relatively neutral system with prolonged circulation lifetimes (Figure 4 .3). Encapsulation efficiencies of over 70% and particle diameter of about 100 nm were achieved with this method (Semple et al., 2001) . Interestingly, the resulting particles are mainly unilamellar at a low nucleic acid-to-lipid ratio, but adopt a multilamellar configuration at higher nucleic acid-to-lipid ratios. These observations led to the suggestion that nucleic acid bridges between individual lipid vesicles promoting the formation of multilamellar structures. A variation of the ethanol-drop method is the preformed vesicle (PFV) method . PFVs containing DODAP, cholesterol, DSPC and a PEG lipid at low pH, typically pH 4, where the DODAP is protonated, are prepared by extrusion in the presence of up to 40% ethanol (Figure 4.4) . Extrusion is usually very rapid in the presence of ethanol. A solution of nucleic acid at pH 4.0 is then slowly added to the ethanoldestabilized liposomes to avoid particle aggregation and the mixture is then incubated for 1 h to allow encapsulation of the nucleic acid. Ethanol is removed by dialysis after the encapsulation step and the pH of the solution  Lipid vesicles are first produced by dropwise addition of an ethanolic solution of lipids into an aqueous buffer, followed by extrusion. An aqueous solution of nucleic acid is added slowly to the resulting vesicle solution, which usually contains approximately 40% ethanol. The mixture is incubated for 1 h at 37 Â°C to allow encapsulation to take place. Residual ethanol is removed by dialysis and the pH of the solution is raised to 7.0. This method usually results in multilamellar particle of approximately 100 nm in diameter with an encapsulation efficiency of approximately 80%. is adjusted to 7.0 to create a charge neutral system. This method generated multilamellar particles of approximately 100 nm in diameter with nucleic acid encapsulation efficiency of over 80% . It was suggested that the attachment of nucleic acid onto the surface of the extruded liposome creates an adhesion point between liposomes, facilitating the formation of the multilamellar vesicles. This also explains the high nucleic acid encapsulation efficiency achieved with this method as the nucleic acid appears to be entrapped between lamellae of the multilamellar particle. An alternative method to extrusion is the spontaneous vesicle formation (SVF) by ethanol dilution method (Jeffs et al., 2005) . Similar to many methods of encapsulation, this method was first developed for plasmid DNA and later adopted for the encapsulation of siRNA. In this method, nucleic acid is prepared in an acidic buffer, while cationic lipid, DSPC, cholesterol and PEG lipid are dissolved in ethanol. The nucleic acid and lipid mixtures are then combined using a T-tube mixer, with the flow of the two streams of fluid controlled via a peristaltic pump (Figure 4 .5) (Jeffs et al., 2005) . Vesicles form spontaneously as the lipids precipitate from solution as the polarity of the medium is raised. Residual ethanol in the final mixture is then removed by dialysis. For siRNA encapsulation, this method uses low amounts of PEG lipid, typically in the range of 1-5% (mol% lipid), and results in particles ranging from 70 to 80 nm in diameter (Judge, Bola, Lee, & MacLachlan, 2006; Zimmermann et al., 2006) . The encapsulation of siRNA is highly efficient with efficiencies of over 90% routinely achieved. The resulting LNP-siRNA are termed "stable nucleic acid lipid particles". Limitations of T-tube mixer formulation include the difficulty in applying the process to laboratory scale formulations due to the high flow rates needed to achieve rapid mixing, and the limited mixing rate which results in an inability to formulate LNP with lipid compositions that require very rapid mixing to achieve stable systems. The Cullis laboratory has developed an in-line mixing method employing a microfluidic herring-bone micromixer . The herringbone micromixer has two inlets, one for an ethanolic mixture of lipids and the other for a buffered solution of siRNA at pH 4.0. A dual syringe pump is used to drive the two streams of fluid into the herring-bone micromixer (Figure 4.6) . As the two streams of fluid meet at the herring-bone micromixer, they fold and wrap around each other, exponentially decreasing the diffusion length between the two streams. This allows for rapid mixing of the two streams of fluid on a millisecond timescale. The rapid decrease in solvent polarity results in the precipitation of lipids in accordance to their solubility. This technique has resulted in greater than 90% siRNA encapsulation efficiency over a wide range of siRNA-to-lipid ratios . Cryotransmission electron microscopy has indicated that LNP-siRNA produced by microfluidic mixing exhibit an electron dense core similar to the ones produced by T-tube in-line mixing (Figure 4.7) . Additional biochemical characterizations strongly suggest that the solid, electron dense core is comprised of distorted inverted micelles of cationic lipids complexed to the encapsulated siRNA. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulation of LNP-siRNA systems suggests the particles contain a nanostructured, hydrophobic core with the siRNA surrounded by an inverted micelle of ionizable cationic lipids (Figure 4.8) . These results are consistent with the initial condensation of
