Combining lower doses of irradiation (1-3.5 Mrad, 10-35 kGy) with other processing techniques, such as antibiotic soaks, is probably the most commonly used method today. Several companies have proprietary processes for sterilization that each claims will provide a disease-free graft. Cryolife, Inc. (Kennesaw, GA) uses a slow freezing process along with DMSO or glycerol for cryopreservation of grafts. After swab culturing and desiccation, the grafts are treated for an extended period of time with an antimicrobial solution. No secondary sterilization method is used. BioCleanse (Regeneration Technologies, Inc., Alachua, FL) is a low-temperature chemical sterilization method that is claimed to penetrate the tissue and eliminate endogenous contamination. The process permeates the inner matrix of tissue with liquid sterilants, such as hydrogen peroxide and isopropyl alcohol, followed by pressure variations to drive the sterilants in and out of the tissue. Soft-tissue grafts (bone-tendon-bone, fascia, tendons, and menisci) are treated with this method. Studies have shown that the BioCleanse process does not appear to affect the mechanical properties of BPTB grafts 55 or anterior tibial tendon grafts. 56 Allowash (Lifenet, Virginia Beach, VA) uses ultrasonics, centrifugation, and negative pressure in combination with reagents, including biologic detergents, alcohols, and hydrogen peroxide. This process claims to increase solubilization and remove lipids, blood, and marrow cells that can act as reservoirs for potential bacterial, fungal, and viral agents. BPTB allografts are terminally sterilized using 13 to 18 kGy of radiation. The Tutoplast process (RTI Biologics, Alachua, FL) also uses an ultrasonic acetone bath to remove lipids, followed by a series of alternating hyperosmotic saline and deionized water baths to destroy bacteria. An oxidative treatment with hydrogen peroxide is then used to eliminate soluble proteins and destroy nonenveloped viruses and bacterial spores. A final acetone wash is done to ensure that any residual prions are removed and enveloped viruses are inactivated and to dehydrate the tissue; this is followed by vacuum extraction, which allows storage at room temperature. Terminal sterilization is done with low-dose gamma irradiation. The Clearant Process (Clearant, Inc., Los Angeles, CA) treats tissue with high doses of radiation (50 kGy), which is 2 to 4 times the dose recommended to avoid tissue damage but claims to avoid this by freezing the sample, extracting the water, and adding stabilizers and free radical scavengers. After the tissue is frozen and the water extracted, DMSO and propylene glycol are added as pretreatment radioprotectants. 53 NovaSterilis (Lansing, NY) developed a technique of sterilization that uses supercritical carbon dioxide at low temperatures and relatively low pressures to induce transient acidification, which is lethal to viruses and bacteria. Although tissue penetration appears to be good with this method, data concerning the effects on the mechanical properties of allografts are limited at this time. The Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (MTF, Edison, NJ), a non-profit organization, also uses a series of chemicals, including nonionic detergents, hydrogen peroxide, and alcohol, to treat most cortical and cancellous grafts, without terminal sterilization with irradiation. This process has been demonstrated to maintain osteoconductivity for up to 1 hour; compressive strength, impact strength, and shear strength are reported to be unaffected by the cleaning procedure. 57 BPTB and other soft-tissue allografts are treated with an antibiotic ''cocktail'' of gentamicin, amphotericin B, and Primaxin (imipenem and cilastatin). The antibiotics are washed out at the completion of processing to nondetectable levels. Low-dose gamma irradiation (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) is used for tissue that is found to have a bioburden (the number of contaminating organisms on a given amount of material before sterilization) greater than what could be sterilized by the antibiotic cocktail.
