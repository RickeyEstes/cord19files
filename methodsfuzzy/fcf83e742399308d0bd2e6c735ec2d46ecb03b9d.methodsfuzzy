ORChID is a 5-year prospective, community-based, longitudinal, dynamic birth cohort study of ARI and AGE episodes and respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogen detection in children during the first 2 years of life (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01304914). Recruitment will take place over a 2-year period, the last recruited child will be followed until their second birthday, and the final year of the study will be used to complete data entry and analysis, laboratory testing of specimens and to report study findings. The progressive 2-year recruitment plan allows for seasonal and year-to-year variation in pathogen activity. 13 20 The study is designed to allow families to be selfsufficient and avoid unnecessary contact with study staff, so as to minimise bias due to a Hawthorne effect. Parents are interviewed every 3 months to record immunisation status and changes in breast feeding and childcare attendance. An initial visit is undertaken once a child is delivered, preferably while the mother and child are still in hospital. At this visit, consent for participation is confirmed, an initial anterior nose swab and nappy swab are collected from the study child, and parents are taught the process for collecting these specimens, nasal swabs are collected from parents, diaries and study paperwork are reviewed and arrangements are made to retrieve cord blood, if available. The Human Research Ethics Committees of the Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service, the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital and The University of Queensland approved the study.
