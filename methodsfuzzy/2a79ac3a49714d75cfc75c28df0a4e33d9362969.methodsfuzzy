NPA specimens, in 1 ml viral transport medium (VTM, prepared in-house), were transported daily to the SMRU microbiology laboratory, which is located in the town of Mae Sot, approximately 50 km from Maela. Specimens were placed into an insulated cool box immediately after collection and were transported back to the Mae Sot laboratory within eight hours of collection, where they were stored at−80°C until analysis. Viral nucleic acid was extracted from thawed NPA-VTM specimens using commercial kits, following the manufacturer's instructions (QIAamp Viral RNA minikit [Qiagen, Hilden, Germany], April 2009 until September 2010; viral nucleic acid extraction protocol of the MagCore HF16 automated extractor [RBC Bioscience, Taiwan], October 2010 until September 2011). Extracts were analysed by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) for adenoviruses, hMPV, influenza viruses (A and B, with typing of influenza A viruses to detect seasonal H1/H3 and pandemic H1 strains), and RSV as described elsewhere [14, 18, 19 ]. An internal control human RNaseP PCR was included to confirm the specimen adequacy and to identify PCR inhibition [20] . Specimens were considered positive if a virus PCR cT value was < 40 with appropriate run control results. To ensure the reproducibility of results approaching the assay limits of detection (approximately 100 copies per reaction for each target; SMRU internal QC data), specimens with low positive PCR results (cT values of [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] were repeated and only if the cT was < 40 in both runs was the virus PCR considered positive.
