Investigators have taken multiple approaches to understand the impact of sex differences and sex hormone receptor signa ling on immunity. Diverse approaches in different experimental models have often led to conflicting results. Age should be carefully considered when studying sex differences in immune cell numbers or functional responses in humans and rodents since sex hormone levels vary over the lifespan (2) . Littermate or colony matching will reduce variables such as diet and microbiome and help to identify sex differences. Studies of sex differences in human immunity would be improved by direct measurements of hormone levels in each individual (particularly in women) because age alone does not predict hormone levels modulated by oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. A common approach is to gonadectomize young mice and replace estrogens or androgens by implantation of time release pellets. While this strategy has led to many answers, the absence of sex hormones in young gonadectomized mice may alter immune cell deve lopment and numbers prior to infection. In addition, replacement of hormones to a constant level does not mimic the cyclic variation that occurs particularly in females. Similarly, it is difficult to recapitulate accurate in vivo exposures of sex hormones in cell culture models. Another approach is to impose male levels of DHT in a female mouse (or female levels of estradiol in a male mouse) to help elucidate sex hormone interactions and their effects independent of chromosomal sex and developmental programming. Mice lacking sex hormone receptors also have informed our understanding of sex differences in immunity. However, global deletion of sex hormone receptors can lead to abnormal levels of estrogens and androgens; for example, global Esr1 deficiency leads to high levels of circulating testosterone (59) (60) (61) . Furthermore, global loss of receptor signaling may alter the function of non-immune cell types in ways that impact immune responses. To circumvent this issue, investigators are beginning to study mice bearing conditional deletion of Esr1 or Ar along with lineage-restricted Cre drivers to understand the effects of sex hormone receptor deficiency on numbers and function of specific cell types. This approach will help to identify direct effects of sex hormone receptor signaling in immune cells. Use of emerging technologies such as single cell RNA-sequencing, assay of transposase-accessible chromatin-sequencing, multiplex mass cytometry, or chip cytometry (62) (63) (64) to monitor the transcriptome, epigenome, or proteome at the single cell level will help us to understand sex differences in immune function and how sex hormone receptors regulate immune cells in homeostasis and during viral infection. These approaches will be especially valuable to dissect the diversity of responses of rare immune cell types in peripheral tissues such as the lung. More precise methods and attention to age and hormonal cycles and levels will help to clarify the roles of sex hormones and receptors in immune responses.
