This study was conducted in a patient test room on the fifth floor of a decommissioned and unoccupied 8-story hospital. The fifth floor consisted of a North and South hallway, each with 16 patient rooms. In between the North and South hallway there was a core area consisting of a Nurses Station and various support rooms. The total floor area of the fifth floor was 1520 m 2 . Each floor of the hospital had a separate constant-volume ventilation system that provided 100% outdoor air (OA) at a volumetric flow rate of 160 m 3 / min. Filtration was achieved using minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) 8 panel filters, followed by MERV 14 bag filters [2] . During the tests on the fifth floor, the ventilation systems serving the other floors were not operational. Air in the patient test room (Fig. 1) was exhausted through the bathroom ceiling. A fan coil unit above the suspended ceiling provided temperature control. A duct connected the return air of the fan coil to the fifth floor ventilation system. There was one ceiling supply diffuser and one ceiling return air inlet by the hallway door with a connection directly to the fan coil unit. The fan coils had MERV 8 panel filters. Tests were conducted under two ventilation system operating modes: baseline and modified. The modified mode, in which negative pressure was achieved for the entire 5th floor, was accomplished by reducing the constant-volume OA flow rate to the 5th floor by 52% while maintaining the same exhaust airflow rate. Unfortunately the testing contractor's air pressure instrumentation was not capable of measuring differential air pressures less than 5 Pa, and the air pressures measured between the patient room and the hallway were less than À5 Pa with the ventilation system in the modified negative pressure mode. The baseline ventilation airflow rates in the patient test room were 2.7 air changes per hour (ach) for supply OA, 2.7 ach for exhaust air (EA), and 8.4 ach for total air (TA). When the ventilation system was modified the room airflow rates changed to 2.0 ach for supply OA, 2.5 ach for EA, and 8.1 for TA. These airflow rates were measured with an airflow capture hood. The total supply airflow rates were measured at the single ceiling supply diffuser and represents the combination of the return air entering the fan coil from the patient room and the outdoor air supplied by the fifth floor 100% outdoor air ventilation system to the patient room fan coil return. The outdoor airflow rates were measured as the difference of supply and return airflow rates. The airflow rates for both ventilation system operation modes met or exceeded the recommended 2.0 ach for outdoor air and 4.0 ach for total air [3] . During the study a tracer aerosol (polyalphaolefin, PAO) was released into the air at bed height in the patient room for a 2.5-hr period to simulate constant generation of airborne particles. Aerosol was produced with a NUCON SN-10 pneumatic aerosol generator. The generation rate was constant for each test, but we are uncertain of the testing contractor's generation rates between the different tests. Optical particle counters (Lighthouse Handheld 3016 sixchannel laser particle counters) were used to measure number concentrations of particles in six diameter ranges: 0.3e0.5, 0.5e1.0, 1.0e2.5, 2.5e5.0, 5e10.0 and > 10.0 mm. One particle counter was placed on the sink in the bathroom, which represented the average concentration in the patient room since all the air was exhausted from the bathroom. Another particle counter was located in the hallway at the top of the door to the patient room. We note that the aerosol concentration was also measured in the patient room at multiple locations and height with a Solaire 3100, which is a laser particle counter that measures the number concentrations in eight diameter ranges. Unfortunately, the aerosol concentrations exceeded the measurement capability of the Solaire 3100, which is designed to accurately measure only low aerosol concentrations (e.g. clean rooms) and not high aerosol concentrations such as those in the patient room for these tests. The high aerosol concentrations resulted in "coincidence" measurement error, where more than one particle is in the laser view area, resulting in an under-counting the true aerosol concentration. The coincidence errors associated with the Solaire 3100 are estimated to undercount the true concentrations by 30e90%, as well as shift the particle size distribution towards larger particles. For the Handheld 3016 instrument data, which we used in our analyses in this paper, the instrument is capable of measuring much higher concentrations with minimal (i.e. < 10%) coincidence error. During the aerosol release the bathroom door remained open and the hallway door remained closed except for during four staged 2-s entry and exits into and out of the patient room. The hallway Protection Efficiency (PE, %) was calculated using Equation (1): C hall ¼ concentration in the hallway adjacent to the room with the aerosol release and C room ¼ concentration in the room with the aerosol release. During each test there were a total of four staged entry/exits into/out of the patient room. Each entry/exit represented two 4-s door openings over a 3-min period. The impact of these door openings can be seen in the momentary sharp increase in hallway aerosol concentrations in Fig. 2 . In addition, when the hallway door to the patient room was opened at the end of the test, Fig. 2 shows the rapid spillage of aerosol out of the patient room into the adjacent hallway, resulting in a reduction of the aerosol concentration in the patient room and a concurrent increase of the aerosol concentration in the hallway. A significant drift in the background hallway concentration of particles was observed in the 0.5e1.0 mm size range during both the baseline and in the modified mode tests (Fig. 2) . Since the 100% outdoor air ventilation system utilized MERV 14 filters with an approximate 83% efficiency for 0.5-mm diameter particles, as compared to 95% for 1.0 mm particles and greater than 99% for 2.5 mm particles [2] , changes in the outdoor particle concentration of 0.5e1.0 mm particles are expected to have some impact on the indoor concentrations.
