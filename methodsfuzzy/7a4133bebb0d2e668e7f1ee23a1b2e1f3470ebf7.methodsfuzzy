After informed consent was obtained from the parents, a questionnaire-styled interview was carried out to solicit clinical symptoms and previous contact history with ill household members or with ill people from outside of the household. The illness included sore throat, rash, fever, conjunctivitis, cough, rhinorrhea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Clinical laboratory data and coronary arterial lesions were collected from the participants, and all received intravenous immunoglobulin 2 g per Kg plus low-dose aspirin (3e5 mg per Kg). If fever persisted for 2 days after use of intravenous immunoglobulin, retreatment with intravenous immunoglobulin was administered. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed in all patients during hospitalization and was repeated at convalescence, 2 weeks, and 8 weeks after discharge. Coronary arterial lesions were defined as coronary arterial dilatation/ectasia, aneurysm, and increased echogenecity, irregularity of vascular wall, or coronary artery aneurysm. A coronary artery aneurysm was defined as having a lumen diameter (inner border to inner border) of !3 mm in KD cases less than 5 years old and !4 mm in cases less than 5 years old, and giant aneurysm was defined as a lumen diameter of !8 mm for any one echocardiography. We took nasopharyngeal swabs and throat swabs from KD cases on the 1st day of hospitalization. These swabs were processed for both viral isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for various viruses.
