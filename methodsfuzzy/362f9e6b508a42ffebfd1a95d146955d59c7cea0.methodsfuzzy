We compared the performance of SVRMHC to that of existing prediction tools for MHC-peptide binding: the additive method, SYFPEITHI [5] , BIMAS [6] , RANKPEP [7] , and SVMHC [12] . At first, we attempted a strategy described in [16, 17] : trying to find recent literature reports of new peptide binding experiments for the three mouse class I MHC molecules. The hope was that predictions could be made for these binding experiments using both the SVRMHC model and the other methods, and a concomitant comparison in prediction accuracy could be made. However, this strategy was not successful, because in most recently-published binding experiments prescreening with prediction tools was used. This was most often SYFPEITHI and sometimes BIMAS [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Only the peptides predicted to be strong binders were tested experimentally, and peptides not predicted to be strong binders were disregarded. Moreover, false predictions (peptides predicted by SYFPEITHI or BIMAS to be strong binders but which were determined experimentally to be weak binders or non-binders) were sometimes not reported [24, 26, 27] . It is not surprising that prediction tools used in pre-screening (SYFPEITHI or BIMAS) always performed better in identifying good binders in these published studies (results not shown). Thus, we applied another scheme for making comparisons between the SVRMHC method and other prediction methods -by using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis [30, 31] . The prediction performance of any classification-type model can be assessed using the combination of two properties -specificity and sensitivity. Predictions were made for each peptide sequence using the corresponding SVRMHC model, the corresponding additive model, as well as the four online predicting tools SYFPEITHI, BIMAS, RANKPEP and SVMHC, and the scores were used to make the ROC plots ( Figure 2 ). The SVRMHC models for the H2-Kb and H2-Db molecules rendered A ROC of 0.738 and 0.834, respectively, higher than the A ROC of any of the other predicting methods, indicating that, in this test, the SVRMHC models performed best compared to the other four prediction methods in identifying strong binding peptides for the mouse class I MHC molecules.
