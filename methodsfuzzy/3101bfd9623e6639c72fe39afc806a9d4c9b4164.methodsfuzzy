This was a quality improvement project conducted to evaluate the impact of inhalational device selection for hospitalized children on the utilization of hospital resources (treatment preparation and delivery time, need for respiratory therapy assistance, and cost). The project was conducted in a tertiary pediatric ward (King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre) during AprileMay 2013. The ultimate goal of this study was to come up with an evidence-based practice policy for inhalational therapy that minimizes unnecessary waste of hospital resources without any negative impact on patient care. The study is not intended to compare the pharmacological efficacy of new interventions (both nebulizers and MDI-spacers are licensed for use in children). The study was reviewed and registered as a quality improvement project under the organization quality improvement board. Inclusion Criteria: Hospitalized children requiring BDs and/or ICSs, age <14 years, and presence of caregiver. Exclusion Criteria: Uncooperative patients, sick patients requiring shift to intensive care unit, or unavailable caregiver. The project was conducted over a period of 6 weeks. In the first 2 weeks, data were gathered from all hospitalized children receiving BDs and/or ICSs by nebulizers. This was followed by a 2-week washout period during which training of healthcare providers and operational changes were implemented to enhance the conversion to MDI-spacer. In the last 2 weeks, data were gathered from hospitalized children after conversion to MDI-spacer. Primary outcomes included the mean time (in minutes) of medication preparation and delivery. Secondary outcomes included need for respiratory therapy assistance, estimated cost of treatment sessions, and patient/caregiver satisfaction. Device instruction was provided for caregivers involved in patient care. The following data were collected during every treatment session: preparation time, delivery time, medication name, dosage, mode of delivery and oxygen flow rate during nebulization therapy. An assessment sheet was used to determine the minimum number of sessions supervised by respiratory therapist required to ensure caregiver competency in the use of MDI-spacer. A patient/caregiver satisfaction survey was performed as part of the quality assurance measurement that is routinely collected by respiratory therapists in our hospital. Medication and device cost were estimated based on the information provided by hospital pharmacy and respiratory therapy department, respectively. The medications that were observed include bronchodilators (albuterol and ipratropium bromide), inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone and budesonide) or a combination of long-acting bronchodilator and ICS (fluticasone/salmeterol). MDI-equivalent dosages of BDs and ICSs solutions were developed (see Table 1 ). Our target was to collect data from more than 100 treatment sessions in each part of the two project phases (nebulizer phase and MDI-spacer phase) for a minimum of 200 observational events. In addition to descriptive data analysis, the Student t-test was used to compare the means of preparation and delivery time between the two groups. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
