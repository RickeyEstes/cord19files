For the purpose of this review, we divided the article into sections and diseasespecific subsections, focusing on specific diseases, one at a time. To access relevant and related publications, we carried out a search on pubmed.gov for armed forces deployment information, using AND as the link word, as the case may be. For others, we searched journal specific or government websites (http://www.health.mil), in addition to websites of international organizations such as the World Health Organization (https://www.who.int/tdr/en/) and the Centers for Disease Control (http://www.cdc.gov), to retrieve articles focused on parasitic diseases in specific endemic locations. Subject directed keywords or terms utilized in our search include armed forces, deployment, malaria, leishmaniasis, epidemiology, military-related autochthonous parasitic diseases, prevention and treatment. References include articles directly relating to research data, relevant case reports or clinical presentations in the United States, Canada, or Europe from deployed service men and women. Of additional interest in our search were articles relating to zoonotic (canine) leishmaniasis among military dogs deployed overseas alongside their handlers and potential for disease transmission on return to the United States.
