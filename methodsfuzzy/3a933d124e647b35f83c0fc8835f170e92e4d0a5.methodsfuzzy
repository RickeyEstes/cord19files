Analysis of data was performed using a computerized statistical analysis program (Abstat; Anderson-Bell). Correlation between viable cell counts and ribavirin concentration was made by multiple linear regression analysis of loglo corrected mean cell values. Statistical tests of differences in mean FIPV titer reductions between combination drugs (YAB) and ribavirin alone and between YAB and Yc (for synergistic interactions) were performed using the Student's t-test on paired samples (1-tailed). The Student's t-test also was used to compare mean cell numbers of untreated vs. drug-treated or ribavirin-treated vs. combination drug-treated cultures.
