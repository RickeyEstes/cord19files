Ethics statement. Venous blood from anonymous healthy human volunteers was obtained from the Blood Transfusion Centre (Etablissement Francais du Sang, Lyon, France) in accordance with its guidelines, with informed written consent from each volunteer. All animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practices as defined by the French National Charter on the ethics of animals experiments, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Animal work was approved by the regional ethical committee CECCAPP (P4_2010_008), and experiments were performed in the INSERM Jean Mérieux BSL4 laboratory in Lyon, France (French Animal regulation commitee number A69 387 05 02). Cell culture. The CHO cell line K1 and CHO pgsA-745 cells stably transfected with human ephrin-B2 and -B3, (pgsA-EFNB2 and pgsA-EFNB3; all generously provided by B. Lee [UCLA, United States] [7] ) were maintained in F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . Vero E6, HS-deficient CHO-K1 cells CHO pgsA-745, CHO pgsB-619, and CHO pgsD-677 cells (15) , HeLa cells, and stable transfected HeLa cells with phCMV-Nipah-G-Neo and phCMV-Nipah-F-Neo, expressing NiV-G and -F proteins, respectively (HeLa-G and HeLa-F), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented as described above. Human peripheral blood was obtained from 20 different healthy donors from the Blood Transfusion Centre (Lyon, France). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by density Ficoll/Hypaque gradient centrifugation and then centrifuged through a 50% Percoll gradient (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals) for 20 min at 400 ϫ g. PBLs were recovered from the high-density fraction. For SPR analysis, cells were detached by Versene treatment and washed twice with HBS-P buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4). Virus infection and titration. Nipah virus (isolate UMMC1; Gen-Bank accession number AY029767) (42), recombinant NiV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (45) , and Hendra virus (Australia/ horse/1994) obtained from Porton Down Laboratory, United Kingdom, were prepared on Vero-E6 cells as described previously (46) , and infection virus was used in the INSERM Jean Mérieux BSL4 laboratory in Lyon, France. All cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, for 1 h at 37°C, washed twice, and observed by inverted and/or fluorescence microscopy daily or harvested for RNA isolation or for use in transinfection assays. At the indicated times postinfection, 150 l of cell culture supernatant was collected and frozen prior to viral titration. Viral titration was performed by plaque assay as detailed elsewhere (47) . The viral infection level in cocultures of leukocytes and CHO cells with Vero cells was determined using a previously described infectious center assay in 6-well plates (48) , after 20 min of formaldehyde fixation and crystal violet staining. Alternatively, in heparin-mediated inhibition assays, titrations were directly performed by plaque assay, using Vero cells or CHO-pgsA745-EFN-B2 or -B3 cell monolayers. Pseudotyped viral particles, containing either NiV-G and/or -F or control VSV-G were produced using Friend's murine leukemia virus (MLV) particles and 293T cells, as described previously (8) . Treatment of cells with sodium chlorate. Vero cell monolayers were grown to confluence and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and sodium chlorate (NaClO 3 ; 25, 50 and 75 mM) for 48 h to inhibit HS sulfation in cells, as rapid turnover of proteoglycans in the cells (47) required prolonged incubation with NaClO 3 . Cells were then detached by using trypsin-0.05% EDTA, distributed into new 6-well tissue culture plates, and grown to confluence in the presence of the same range of concentrations of NaClO 3 and infected with either NiV or HeV (50 or 100 PFU/well). Following 72 h of incubation in CMC/DMEM supplemented with 3% FCS and NaClO 3 , virus was titrated by using crystal violet staining. trans-infection assay. Cells were put in contact with virus (MOI, 1) for 1 h at 37°C, 5% CO 2 . After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were cultured at 37°C for 24 h and then collected and washed, and 10-fold serial dilutions were added to cell monolayers of Vero cells for determination of cell-associated infectious NiV in a infectious center assay, as described previously (8) . In some experiments, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 10 U/ml of heparinase 3 (Sigma) and washed 3 times before contact with NiV. Treatment with heparin (porcine intestinal mucosa; Sigma) of either cells or virus and pseudotyped viral particles was performed for 30 min at 37°C. In heparin pretreatment experiments, after incubation with heparin, cells were thoroughly washed before adding the virus. In heparin posttreatment experiments, NiV-resistant cells were initially put in contact with either NiV or HeV for 1 h and incubated with heparin afterward, for 30 min at 37°C, washed, and analyzed in a transinfection assay as described above. SPR-based binding assays. SPR experiments were performed on a BIAcore X apparatus (for analysis of cells and pseudotyped viral particles) or a Biacore 3000 apparatus (for pseudotyped viral particles and recombinant ephrin-B3), using CM4 (for pseudotyped virus and recombinant EFN-B3) and CM5 (for cells) sensor chips and HBS-P buffer. HS (Celsus, Cincinnati, OH, United States), HP (Sigma), and DS (Sigma) were biotinylated and immobilized on Biacore sensor chips, as described before (49) . Briefly, two flow cells were activated with a mix of 0.2 M N-ethyl-N=-(diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) and 0.05 M N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Then, streptavidin (50 g/ml in 10 mM acetate buffer [pH 4.5]) was injected over the activated flow cells, to obtain an immobilization level of~2,500 response units (RU). One of these flow cells served as a negative control, while biotinylated HP, HS, and DS were injected on the other flow cells, to obtain suitable immobilization levels (50 to 70 RU for recombinant human ephrin-B3 Fc and pseudotyped viral particles analysis; 200 RU for cells). Interaction assays were performed at a flow rate of 5 l/min and involved 5-to 10-min injections of sample over the HP and negative-control surfaces, followed by a 5-min washing step with HBS-P buffer to allow dissociation of the complexes formed. At the end of each cycle, GAG surfaces were regenerated by sequential injections of 0.05% SDS (1 min) and 2 M NaCl (2.5 min). Typical sample concentrations used were 10 g/ml for recombinant human ephrin-B3 Fc (R&D Systems), 1 ϫ 10 7 to 2.4 ϫ 10 7 particles/ml for pseudotyped viral particles and 0.5 ϫ 10 6 to 0.7 ϫ 10 6 cells/ml for CHO-pgsA-745 and HeLa cell transfectants. The sensorgrams shown correspond to on-line subtraction of the negative-control signal from the GAG surface signal. Competition assays were performed by preincubating NiV pseudoparticles with GAGs (1 to 10 g/ml, final concentration) for 15 min prior to injection. RNA isolation and RT-qPCR. RNA was isolated from cells and plasma by using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) in RLT buffer, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription (RT) was performed on 0.5 g of total RNA by using oligo(dT) and random hexamer oligonucleotide primers (iScript cDNA synthesis kit; Bio-Rad) and run in a Biometra T-Gradient PCR device, and cDNAs were diluted 1/10. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed with cDNA samples by using Platinum SYBR green qPCR SuperMix-UDG with a ROX kit (Invitrogen). qPCR was run on the StepOne Plus PCR system (Applied Biosystems) as follows: 95°C for 5 min and 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min, followed by a melting curve of up to 95°C at 0.8°C intervals. All samples were run in duplicate, and the results were analyzed using StepOne software v2.1. The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was used as a housekeeping gene to normalize the samples. GAPDH and standard references for the corresponding genes were included in each run to check for RNA integrity, RNA load, and inter-PCR variation. After normalization, the results were expressed as the number of mRNA copies of the gene of interest per microgram of analyzed RNA. All calculations were done using the ⌬⌬CT model (50) , and experiments were performed according to the MIQE guideline (51) . Primer used included the following: NiV N forward, GGCAGGATTCTTCGCAACCATC, and reverse, GGCTCTTG GGCCAATTTCTCTG; murine GAPDH forward, GCATGGCCTTCCGT GTCC, and reverse, TGTCATCATACTTGGCAGGTTTCT; EFN-B2 forward, CAAGTTCTGCTGGATCAA, and reverse, GATGTTGTTCCCCG AATG, EFN-B3 forward, ATGGAAAGAGACCGAGGG, and reverse, GA GGTTGCATTGCTGGTG. Production of heparin devoid of anticoagulant activity (POheparin). To eliminate its anticoagulant properties, heparin was treated with periodate, as previously described (52) . Briefly, 100 mg of heparin from porcine intestine (185.8 USP units/mg; Sigma) was dissolved in 900 l of 0.1 M NaIO 4 in 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5) and stirred at 4°C for 3 days. The unreacted NaIO 4 was then neutralized by addition of glycerol (25 l), dialyzed against H 2 O, and lyophilized. The sample was resuspended in 800 l of 0.2 M NaBH 4 in 0.25 M ammonium bicarbonate and incubated for a further 3 h at 4°C. After acidification with glacial acetic acid (to eliminate any remaining NaBH 4 ), the reaction mixture was neutralized by addition of NaOH (1 M), dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. Infection of hamsters. Eight-week-old golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus; Janvier, France) were anesthetized and infected intraperitoneally with 0.4 ml containing NiV (500 50% lethal doses [LD 50 s] preincubated with heparin [0.5 mg/ml; 30 min at 37°C]). Groups of 5 animals were treated daily subcutaneously with the PO-heparin (10 mg/kg of body weight) for 12 days, starting from the day of infection. Animals were followed daily for 3 weeks. Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as means Ϯ SD or as the percentage of survival. Statistical analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney U test, one-sample t test, and Mantel-Cox test within Graph-Pad's Prism4 software.
