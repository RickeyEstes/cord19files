PubMed, the World-wide Web, web sites of educational institutions, and other relevant sources were searched for papers, articles, chapters, documents, flowcharts, maps, and schematics in the form of published works and field research in limitedresource and other settings. Searches using IEEE Xplore did not yield additional relevant articles. In the interests of brevity, the reader can find detailed discussions of geospatial theory, software apps, and analytical techniques in Ferguson et al. (28) (29) (30) . Visual logistics illustrate several key concepts. EndNote X9.1 (Clarivate Analytics, https://clarivate.com/) was used to consolidate over 500 entries retrieved as abstracts, ULRs, and Point-of-care cardiac biomarker testing is warranted in rural SWNs to guide early therapy and to educate young physicians in the management of acute coronary syndromes. Handheld and small benchtop instruments can be implemented effectively in SWNs not just for faster rescue, triage, transport, and treatment of critically ill patients with acute myocardial infarction, but also for improved medical and economic outcomes. The research in this pivotal paper led to implementation of POC cardiac biomarker testing throughout Thailand in over 500 sites with over 700 instruments.
