This study is exploratory in nature, and it investigated the perception of Chinese travelers on their preferred attributes when selecting restaurants. Primary data were collected through a questionnaire which was developed on the basis of prior studies on restaurant selection criteria as discussed in Section 2. In addition to the qualifying question of whether the respondent is a Chinese traveler, the first part of the questionnaire requested respondents to indicate their trip profile, in particular on the type of visa that they had for the trip, which was then used to determine if the traveler was an IVS or packaged traveler. The second part of the questionnaire comprised 18 attributes (variables) which were adapted from Auty (1992) and Heung (2002) and fell into five dimensions of food and beverage, service, price, environment, and attraction. As pointed out in Section 2, these dimensions were identified as the most essential factors on restaurants selection. A seven-point Likert scale was used for each of these attributes which ranged from 7 (strongly agree) to 1 (strongly disagree), and respondents were requested to rate the importance for each of these attributes. The third part of the questionnaire asked for demographic information of the respondents, including gender, age group, education level, marital status, and family income. These are the most commonly used demographic variables in hospitality and tourism research (Chen and Gursoy, 2000; Dossa and Williams, 2001; Weber, 2005) . Lew and McKercher (2002) further showed the appropriateness of using these variables in tourism research. There was also an open-ended question at the end of the questionnaire to allow the respondents to provide additional comments that are related to the five dimensions. The original questionnaire was developed in English, which was then translated to Chinese, and finally to English using a blind-translation-back-translation technique (Hsu et al., 2006) . Such a method ensures the accuracy of a translation. Using a convenience sampling technique, the Chinese questionnaire was pilot-tested by 30 Chinese travelers (including 17 IVS and 13 packaged travelers) in early 2005 at the Avenue of Stars-one of Hong Kong's most popular tourist spots. To ensure the content validity of the questionnaire, the travelers were requested to evaluate the appropriateness and comprehensiveness of all statements. No problem was found in the pilot test, and the large-scale survey was conducted in mid-2005 for 2 months at the Avenue of Stars due to its easy accessibility and the mass gathering of Chinese travelers. During that time, two interviewers were recruited to approach Chinese travelers for completing questionnaires during day time on weekdays. Among 239 completed questionnaires received, nine were discarded due to the numerous missing values, leaving 230 usable questionnaires for analysis. Table 1 shows the demographic profile of the 230 respondents, of which 127 were IVS travelers and the rest were packaged travelers. Among these travelers, 56% were male. Most of the IVS travelers were in the age groups of 16-35 years (70%), and the majority of packaged travelers were in the age groups of 26-45 years (67%). A chi-square test indicated a significant difference between the ages of IVS and packaged travelers. Apparently, IVS travelers were younger than their packaged counterparts. This difference is probably due to the fact that young travelers like to freely plan for their own trips instead of to join wellplanned excursions lead by tour guides. Excursions, however, provided more confidence and assurance, which are normally welcomed by more mature travelers. Dotson and Clark (2004) pointed out that the risk in decisionmaking for packaged tourists is always lower than individual travelers. In addition, packaged tourists had a lower demand for special or new experiences which differ from others. In contrast, young tourists might not like to be restricted by routine schedules. Table 1 also reveals that about 46% of the IVS travelers and 38% of the packaged travelers were single and no significant difference was found on marital status between the two groups of travelers. However, significant differences were found between the two groups of travelers in education level and average family income. The percentage distributions of IVS and packaged travelers who had completed secondary school or bachelor degree were about the same, but there was a disproportionate discrepancy in the number of travelers with post-graduate degrees between these two groups. Apparently, IVS travelers were better educated than packaged travelers. Similarly, the percentages of IVS travelers and packaged travelers with a family income of RMB 1001-4000 (US $1 Â¼ RMB 7.8) were comparable but relatively there were significantly more IVS travelers with a family income of higher than RMB 4000. Such an observation implies that IVS travelers were from wealthier families. Since education level and income are positively correlated, the better-educated IVS travelers were more likely to spend more during their travel. Since packaged tours are generally of a lower quality in products and service (Dotson and Clark, 2004) , they are less attractive to highly educated travelers. Despite the lower price, the packaged tours do not appear to be as appealing to the financially stronger travelers such as the IVS travelers.
