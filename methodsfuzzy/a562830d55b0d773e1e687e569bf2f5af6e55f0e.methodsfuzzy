Real-time PCR was performed to confirm positive results from the BP-MS method. For S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, M. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa, multiplex real-time PCR was used (Gadsby et al., 2015) . For N. meningitidis, L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae, and B. pertussis, singleplex real-time PCR was used according to previously published methods (Corless et al., 2001; Welti et al., 2003; Tatti et al., 2011) . Each sample was tested in duplicate and regarded as positive if both cycle threshold (CT) values were <40. Nested PCR methods were used to resolve disagreements between results of the BP-MS and realtime PCR methods. The nested PCR was designed in-house for this study and was based on published conventional PCR assays. The primers and probes used in the confirmatory tests described above are listed in Tables S2, S3 in the Supplementary Material. In this study, we developed a 12-plex method to simultaneously detect 11 key bacterial pathogens associated with pneumonia and meningitis, using HBB as a nucleic acid extraction control. On the basis of previously published studies, we chose well-characterized and highly sensitive and specific genes as targets. In silico analysis showed that the BP-MS method can be used to specifically detect target pathogens, including most strains within a species. The final target genes and assays are listed in Table S1 in the Supplementary Material. A total of 204 nasal and throat swabs were collected to evaluate the performance of the BP-MS method. Each of the 11 target pathogens was detected, with an overall detection rate of 81.9% (167/204). Among all the 167 pathogen-positive samples, the rate of infection with multiple pathogens was 55.7% (93/167). Two and three pathogens were detected in 47 and 29 samples, respectively, whereas four or five pathogens were detected in 17 samples. Samples determined pathogen-positive by the BP-MS method were re-tested first by real-time PCR. Using a combination of multiplex and singleplex real-time PCRs, 46.1% (77/167) of the positive samples showed results concordant with Table 3 . Thirty-one BP-MS-positive samples were not verified by either real-time PCR or nested PCR. Of these, 14 were single-infection samples and 17 were multiple-infection samples. All single-infection samples tested negative by both confirmatory tests, and, for 13 of 17 multiple-infection samples, one of the targets was not confirmed. For single-infection samples, S. pneumoniae was the pathogen most commonly unconfirmed (n = 9) whereas for multiple-infection samples, K. pneumoniae was the pathogen most commonly unconfirmed (n = 7). Details of the 31 discordant samples are shown in Table 4 .
