Wastewater treatment processes are categorized as source treatment, pretreatment, primary treatment, secondary treatment, and tertiary or advanced wastewater treatment. Source treatment is used to remove toxics and/or other undesirable contaminants to prevent intermingling with other waste streams. This approach offers opportunities for reuse of these constituents such as metals, etc. Conventional treatment includes preand primary treatment followed by secondary-treatment processes. When necessary tertiary treatment processes are included in the treatment sequence to remove specific constituents to very low residue levels. Pretreatment is employed to render the raw wastewater compatible and/or amenable for subsequent treatment processes. Consideration is given to those constituents that pass through, interfere with, or accumulate in the sludge or are otherwise incompatible with following treatment processes. Equalization, spill retention, neutralization for pH adjustment, nutrient addition, toxics or inhibitory substance removal, oil and grease removal, and solids removal by flotation, sedimentation, or filtration are typical pretreatment processes. Primary treatment is a subset of pretreatment methods and involves physical separation by screening, grit removal, and sedimentation. Depending on the amount of organics contained in the solid material, primary treatment may remove a significant portion of the oxygen-demanding substances (BOD). A well-designed and operated primary plant may remove as much as 35-40% of the BOD and as much as 60-65% of the settleable solids for municipal wastewaters. Secondary treatment adds a biological process after primary treatment, which is commonly either activated sludge or trickling filtration for municipal wastewaters. Typically activated sludge or a modification of suspended growth treatment systems is used for industrial wastewater to achieve a high-quality effluent. These biochemical processes are typically aerobic and are the same as previously described as occurring in a river where organics are oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. A well-operated and designed secondary treatment plant can be expected to remove 85-95% of both BOD and suspended solids. Under existing regulations in the United States, all discharges must be subjected to at least secondary treatment. Conventional treatment is described by Best Conventional Treatment Technology (BCT) and is designed to remove conventional pollutants such as BOD, TSS, etc. common to municipal wastewaters. However, BCT does not effectively remove many constituents of present-day concern, especially those of industrial wastewater origin. These include many VOCs, toxics, non-biodegradable organics, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), nutrients and emerging contaminants such as EDCs and PPCPs. Hence, additional treatment technology is required. Tertiary treatment may be defined as treatment in addition to primary and secondary processes. It may include precipitation, filtration, coagulation and flocculation, air stripping, ion exchange, adsorption, membrane processes, nitrification, and/or denitrification, and other processes. Those processes may be integrated into the secondary treatment plant or added onto the secondary effluent. Tertiary or advanced wastewater treatment can attain virtually any removal efficiency desired. However, as previously noted, as the percentage of contaminant removal increases, so does the cost of attaining it. These technologies are often referred to as Best Available Technology Economically Achievable (BTEA) and are applied to meet stream standards or to comply with TMDL requirements. Tertiary treatment is employed to remove toxics, persistent organics, nonconventional pollutants, nutrients, etc. and is typically considered as BATEA. Tertiary treatment systems following secondary treatment, however, may not be efficient at industrial facilities because of the need for treatment of a large volume of flow with low contaminant concentrations. Many tertiary processes also may not be pollutant-specific. Generally, the most cost-effective approach is to address the problem at the source where flows are low and specific pollutants are present at high concentrations. Applicable technologies for source treatment will depend on the constituents in the process wastewater targeted for removal. For example, if VOCs and ammonia are to be removed, then air or steam stripping should be evaluated. If heavy metals are of concern, then oxidation/reduction, precipitation, filtration, ion exchange, and membrane processes may be investigated. Organic chemicals may require chemical oxidation, wet air oxidation, anaerobic treatment, granular activated carbon (GAC), polymeric resins, or reverse osmosis for effective removal. Special mention should be made of the solid material removed in any of these processes since residuals disposal is a major problem in wastewater treatment. Sludges are particularly troublesome because of their high water content, concomitant large volumes, and concentration of heavy metals, viruses, protozoa, and other constituents capable of causing environmental and public health harm. Costs of treatment may be one-half or more of that of the aqueous waste stream. Many of the processes mentioned in the preceding paragraphs produce solids. Solids from primary and secondary clarifiers must be effectively managed. Residual solids usually undergo a series of treatment steps involving thickening, dewatering, and final disposition or reuse. Organic sludge may also require stabilization prior to final disposal. Stabilization may be achieved by digestion [aerobic or anaerobic (no oxygen present)], lime stabilization, or by other means. Sludge thickening is typically accomplished by gravity, flotation, or centrifugation methods. Centrifuges, belt filters, and filter presses are dewatering options. The selection of unit processes and their sequence will depend primarily on the characteristics and volume of the sludge and on the final disposition or reuse option selected. Ultimate disposal choices include incineration, landfill, land disposal (lagooning or application to land for reuse) or other reuse alternatives. Since this material is a resource, it is important that opportunities for reuse be fully considered. It is the ultimate disposal method selected that may significantly influence the unit operations selected for treatment.
