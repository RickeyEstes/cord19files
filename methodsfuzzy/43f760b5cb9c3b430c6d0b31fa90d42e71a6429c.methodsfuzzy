Using the daily curve of reported cases in Iran, we estimate the reproduction number of this purpose, we first characterize the daily reported incidence using the generalized growth model (GGM) 20 (1). This model characterizes the growth profile via two parameters: the growth rate parameter ( ) and the 21 scaling of the growth rate parameter ( ). The model captures diverse epidemic profiles ranging from 22 constant incidence ( = 0), sub-exponential or polynomial growth (0 < < 1), and exponential growth 23 ( = 1) (1). The serial interval is assumed to follow a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.41 days and a 24 standard deviation of 3.17 days based on recent reports (2, 3). 25 Next, to estimate the most recent estimate of Rt, we simulate the progression of incident reported cases from 26 the calibrated GGM, and apply the discretized probability distribution ( ) of the serial interval using the 27 renewal equation (4-6) given by 28 . 29 In the renewal equation we denote the total incidence at calendar time by . Here, the denominator 30 represents the total number of cases that contribute to the incidence cases at time . Next, we estimate 31 from 300 simulated curves assuming a Poisson error structure to derive the uncertainty bounds around 32 our estimate of the reproduction number (7). 33 We ran simulation to generate 10,000 sets of estimates of epidemic doubling times for a given time series 35 of cumulative number of reported cases, and to compute the arithmetic mean of each set. Then, the harmonic 36 mean of these estimates was calculated across 10,000 sets of simulations and was reported as our estimated 37 epidemic doubling time, with 95% confidence interval (Table S2) . 38 Next, we drew 10,000 random values for the serial interval from a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.41 39 .

We generate 10,000 values for the reproduction number 40 by calculating the reproduction number for each pair of values (arithmetic mean of epidemic doubling time 41 and serial interval respectively) following the equation as in Vynnycky and White (8), Table 4 .1, Equation 42 4.14: 43 Reproduction number = 1 + growth rate Ã— serial interval 44 We reported the mean and 95% of the 10,000 estimated values of the reproduction number (Table S2) . 45
