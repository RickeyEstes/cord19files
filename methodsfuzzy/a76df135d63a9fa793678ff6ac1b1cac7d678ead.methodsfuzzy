Vaccination by Injection. Hypodermic injection with a needle and syringe dates back to the mid-19th century and is such a predominant vaccine administration method that "shots" or "jabs" are often considered synonymous with vaccinations. Mass production of needles and syringes results in extremely low costs for these devices. Injection breaches the skin's stratum corneum, the protective layers of dead keratinized epithelial cells, to deposit vaccine in direct contact with the underlying dermal, SC, or muscle tissues. IM and SC delivery of vaccines by needle and syringe provides highly consistent dosing. For ID injection, because the dermal layer is so thin, precise targeted deposition is more difficult, so ID needle injection may provide less consistent delivery to the targeted tissues. Overall, needle and syringe vaccination produces excellent immune responses and is extremely safe when proper procedures are followed by trained vaccinators. However, significant logistical limitations are inherent in needle and syringe injection. The high level of skill required for safe injections limits the availability of vaccinators. Reuse of contaminated syringes and needles is common in some developing countries and can lead to transmission of bloodborne diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Inexpensive autodisabling syringes and needles can prevent reuse and mitigate this problem. However, while autodisabling devices are used in many developing countries, risk of needlestick injuries to healthcare workers remains a concern and increases healthcare costs. 23, 24 Safety syringes which include needlestick protection features, described later in this chapter, can reduce the risk of needlestick injuries. Finally, the cost and complexity of safe disposal of sharps in the medical waste stream represent major logistical challenges. To overcome many of the difficulties of needle and syringe injection, multiuse nozzle jet injectors (MUNJIs) were commonly used in the past for IM and SC injection. However, repeated use of the jet injection nozzles without cleaning between patients was shown to have a risk of transmission of bloodborne pathogens, and use of these devices was discontinued. 25 Disposable syringe jet injectors (DSJIs) eliminated this contamination problem and are discussed in detail later in this chapter. Mucosal Vaccination. In addition to vaccination by injection, current macrodelivery methods include mucosal vaccination via oral ingestion or nasal spray delivery. Both methods share the advantages of being needle free and present the possibility for simple administration methods. Mucosal vaccination mimics the route of entry, through portals to mucosal tissues, of many infectious agents and typically provides syringe injection. Needle-free vaccines that could be administered by minimally trained staff or volunteers, or that could be self-administered, would significantly increase vaccine delivery capacity. The third important logistics factor for immunizations in LMICs is sharps safety. Needlestick injuries are common; however, unlike in high-income countries, needlestick protection devices and prophylaxis to prevent bloodborne disease transmission following these injuries are often not available in low-resource settings because of cost. Safe disposal of used needles requires an expensive biowaste disposal infrastructure that is not always present. In some countries, used needles are harvested from the common waste stream and repackaged to the unsuspecting for reuse, presenting a high risk for transmission of bloodborne pathogens. In the long run, thermostable needle-free vaccines could significantly reduce these logistical hurdles to vaccine delivery in developing countries and extend the benefits of immunization to all people. In the short term, intermediate technologies that are in development can improve cold chain shipping and storage and provide needlestick injury protection. During the more than 200 years of cutaneous vaccination against smallpox (see Chapter 54), a variety of sharp Glide Pharma (United Kingdom) has also developed a solid-dose injector. It uses a spring-loaded device to quickly push into SC tissue a sharp, biodegradable implant the size of a grain of rice (see Fig. 68 .4G). The solid-dose injector has been tested with influenza, diphtheria, and H. influenzae vaccines and is in development with an anthrax vaccine. 282 Potential benefits of this technology class include dryformat unit-dose administration; increased thermostability of the solid vaccine formulation in comparison to a liquid formulation; reduced cold chain footprint because of the small dose and package size; avoidance of needles and syringes with reduced risk of needlestick injury and reuse; and potential for reduced number of booster doses if slow release is successfully demonstrated to provide improved immunogenicity. Challenges to development include demonstrating the feasibility of the formulation and manufacture of solid vaccine implants, acceptability, and the complexity and costliness of the administration device.
