We implemented an NGS data analysis pipeline to identify unknown pathogens, assemble whole genomes, and investigate viral diversity from mixed/single clinical samples. Fig 1A  shows the flowchart of the overall methodology. In brief, the overall methodology included the following steps: 1) NGS was performed using the Illumina system for collected clinical samples, 2) NGS reads were preprocessed using bioinformatics tools, and sequence homologs of assembled contigs were searched for BLASTN, 3) NGS diagnoses were validated using PCR or ELISA, 4) NGS analysis was performed on single isolate, if no virus was detected in PCR or ELISA confirmation, 5) an iterative mapping was implemented to obtain viral genome, if no genome was provided, 6) reference mapping was performed to identify genetic variants, and 7) genetic diversity was investigated using phylogenetic and recombination analyses. This platform is detailed in the following sections.
