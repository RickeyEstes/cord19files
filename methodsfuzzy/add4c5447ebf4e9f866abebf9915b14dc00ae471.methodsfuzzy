Focusing on the data in Table 1 we used two other methods to estimate R h . The first was to estimate R h based on the observed probability of extinction, assuming that the dispersion parameter of the offspring distribution is known. Among 19 samples in Table 1 , only one major epidemic was reported, and thus, the probability of extinction was 18/19. Using this, we estimated R h from the relationship p¼18/19. It should be emphasized that this method required us to adopt an unrealistic assumption that the data in Table 1 fully represented the total occurrences of pneumonic plague outbreaks (including immediate extinctions and thus the final size distribution is not truncated). Second, we estimated R h from the major epidemic data. Fig. 2 shows an epidemic curve in Manchuria, 1911. We estimated the intrinsic growth rate r, which is also referred to as the Malthusian growth rate. Assuming that generation time follows a gamma distribution with mean m¼5.66 days and coefficient of variation v ¼0.644 (where the standard deviation s satisfies s¼mv¼3.65 days), the reproduction number was calculated using the following estimator derived from the Euler-Lotka equation (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007) : This argument permits us to replace r by the right-hand side of We estimated R h (or r) based on a pure birth process. Given observations of the cumulative number of cases on day 0, 1, y, t, C(0), C(1), yC(t), we have which can be used to construct a likelihood function for r: Detailed derivation of the likelihood is given elsewhere (Bailey, 1964; Nishiura et al., 2009) . The likelihood function (27) was used for estimating R h . Profile likelihood was used to derive 95% confidence intervals. Since the generation time of pneumonic plague has yet to be fully quantified (Nishiura, 2010; Klinkenberg and Nishiura, 2011) , we investigated the sensitivity of R h to different m ranging from 3.66 to 7.66 days, corresponding to empirically observed quartiles of 3-7 days (Nishiura, 2006) .
