To a mixture of ethyl diethylphosphonoacetate (11f) (0.3 ml, 1.50 mmol) and NaH (60% in oil, 0.076 g, 1.90 mmol) in anhydrous THF (2.0 ml) with stirring was added dropwise a solution of (Z)-5a (0.5 g, 1.27 mmol) in anhydrous THF (90 ml) at 3°C under a N 2 atmosphere. The mixture was stirred at 27°C for 2 h. The mixture was quenched with H 2 O and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was added to a saturated NH 4 Cl solution and extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed with brine and dried. The solvent was evaporated off to give a residue which was recrystallized from ethyl acetatehexane (5:1) to give 12f 1 (0.42 g, 71%) as red needles. Physical and spectral data of 12bÀ12e, 12gÀ12j, 12oÀ12x are shown in Supplementary data. To a yellow suspension of TiCl 4 (0.11 ml, 1.00 mmol) in carbon tetrachloride (10 ml) was added dropwise a mixture of (Z)-5a (0.2 g, 0.51 mmol) and 11b (0.12 g, 0.45 mmol) in anhydrous THF (40 ml) at À10 to À4°C, and the mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 0.5 h. N-Methylmorpholine (0.45 ml, 4.09 mmol) was added to the solution at À7 to À4°C. The mixture was stirred at À10°C for 2 h and 25°C for 12 h and poured into water. A chloroform extraction was washed with brine and dried over MgSO 4 . The solvent was evaporated off to give a residue which was purified with silica gel column chromatography [CHCl 3 -ethyl acetate (20:1)] and recrystallized from hexane-ethyl acetate (5:1) to give 12k (0.07 g, 22%) as red needles. Physical and spectral data of 12kÀn, 12y, 12z, 12aa, 12ab, 12ac are shown in Supplementary data.
