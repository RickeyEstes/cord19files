From November 2002 to April 2003, the virology laboratory (University Hospital, Caen, France) received 1,427 respiratory samples (nasal aspirates and swabs) from patients <20 years of age. All specimens were tested for influenza virus A and B; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, and 4; and adenovirus by direct or indirect immunofluorescence or virus isolation. Samples were also tested for human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus, enterovirus, and HCoV 229E and OC43 by virus isolation and RT-PCR. A total of 556 samples (39%) were positive for any of these viruses. Symptoms indicated viral infection, as judged by the clinical department; therefore, samples were not tested for bacterial pathogens. Of the 556 positive samples, the following respiratory viruses were detected: RSV (37%, n = 205), rhinovirus (18%, n = 101), influenza virus A and B (15%, n = 86), HMPV (9.7%, n = 54), and HCoV-OC43 (1.2%, n = 7); no HCoV-229E were detected. Of the 871 negative samples, 300 (50 per month) were tested for HCoV-NL63. These 300 samples represented 191 patients <2 years of age (64%), 46 patients 2-5 years of age (15%), and 63 patients 6-20 years of age (21%). All patients were hospitalized with acute respiratory tract illness. Data for 18 patients with recorded HCoV-NL63 infection were available and were examined retrospectively for specific respiratory symptoms. All patients consented to having their samples tested for respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses.
