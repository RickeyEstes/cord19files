MHV-4 (wt) was originally obtained from L. P. Weiner (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) and has been maintained in this laboratory by several passages in SAC-cells. The isolation and characterization of the V5A13. I variant from MHV-4 (wt) has been described previously (Dalziel et al., 1986) . The variant used in the experiments described here is the original V5A13.1 (86) antibody-resistant variant derived in 1986. V5A13.1 (86) has been maintained in the laboratory by passage in SAC-cells. The stock of virus used in the present study is one passage in SAC cells from a stock used for RNA sequencing of the S gene (Parker et al, , I 989) . Sequencing of this new stock detected no changes from the published sequence. Infection of mice BALB/c Byj and BALB/Wehi n&u mice from the Scripps Clinic breeding facility were infected intracerebrally with virus at 6 to 8 weeks of age. Animals were anesthetized and virus inoculated intracerebrally, 100 PFU in 0.05 ml of sterile saline. Brains were removed at various times postinfection and divided sagittally. Onehalf was frozen for virus titration. The other half of the brain was placed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin and after 1 to 2 days processed by routine techniques and embedded in paraffin. Sagittal sections 5-pm thick were cut and mounted in triplicate on poly-L-lysine coated slides. Three brains on each of Days 1 to 4 and at least six sections from each were processed for in situ hybridization.
