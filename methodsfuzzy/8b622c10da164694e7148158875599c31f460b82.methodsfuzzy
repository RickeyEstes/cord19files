Drug discovery is an interdisciplinary, complex, time consuming and expensive process. It is widely admitted that the pharmaceutical industry now spends far more on research and development but produces fewer new molecules than 20 years ago. The PriceWaterhouseCoopers Pharma report for 2005 stressed that the pharmaceutical industry needs to find means to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of drug discovery and development. It projected that in silico methods will become a dominant tool to address this issue, from drug discovery to marketing. Recently, advances in computational techniques and hardware have enabled in silico methods to speed up lead identification and optimization. Up till now, these techniques have contributed to the design of about 50 compounds that entered clinical trials, some of which are now FDA approved [1] . As of today, in silico drug design should not be seen as a 'voilà' technique able to suggest directly a small number of compounds with a high affinity and selectivity for the targeted macromolecule, along with favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and using only the three dimensional (3D) structure of the target as a starting point. It rather consists of a systematic use of a wide range of different computational tools aiming, for instance, at improving the knowledge about the target-ligand interactions (molecular docking), increasing the yield of molecules screening by focusing the search on compounds more likely to bind the target (virtual high-throughput screening [vHTS] ) or even suggesting new potential lead compounds (fragment-fragment-based ligand design [FBD] ) [1] . Those methods are detailed below. The properties of 40 fragment hits identified experimentally against several targets indicated that they show, on average, properties consistent with a 'rule of three' [69] , i.e. molecular weight Ͻ 300 g/mol, number of hydrogen-bond donors Յ 3, number of hydrogen-bond acceptors Յ 3, calculated LogP Յ 3. In addition, it was found that the number of rotatable bonds and the polar surface area were usually lower or equal to 3 and 60 Å 2 , respectively. Fragments are usually obtained using a chemoinformatics approach by breaking down biologically active compounds into a limited number of fragments. Depending on the definition of molecular fragments that is used, the chemical space of drug-like molecules reduces to some hundreds [70, 71] to thousands of fragments [72] . Several approaches are available to automatically decompose molecules into rigid fragments [73, 74] . Several methods have been developed for in silico FBD (see Table 2 ), which differ in the building blocks used to construct the ligands (atoms or fragments), the target constraints applied (ligandor receptor-based), the strategy used to sample the chemical space (depth first [59] , breadth first [59] , MC, EA), the structural sampling (mainly growing, linking and random structure mutations) and the scoring function used to rank the putative ligands. Among the most representative methods, one can find LUDI [75] , Multicopy Simultaneous Search (MCSS) [76] /HOOK [77] , PRO_LIGAND [78] , Small Molecule Growth (SMOG) (DeWitte and Shakhnovich), LigBuilder [79] , LeapFrog (Tripos Inc., Tripos, St. Louis, MO, USA), CCLD [80] and Genetic Algorithm-based de Novo Design of Inhibitors (GANDI) [81] . In ligand-based FBD, new molecules are designed based on existing ligands. From the latter, different constraints and scoring functions can be derived, like pharmacophore models, molecular similarity or Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) scoring functions. On the contrary, receptor-based FBD uses the 3D structure of the protein binding site to design molecules that are expected to optimize ligand-protein interactions. Several scoring functions, called the primary constraints, can be used to rank the suggested molecules and drive the search in the chemical space. They correspond mainly to those used by docking programs, i.e. force field-based, empirical and knowledge-based scoring functions. In addition, several other physicochemical parameters related to the drug-likeness of the compounds, as well as terms accounting for molecular and spatial similarity to known ligands, can be used as filters or added to the scoring functions [81, 82] . The latter are called the secondary constraints. The linking approach (Fig. 2B) starts with the placement of building blocks at key interaction sites of the receptor. This can be done by the fragment-based design software itself, or using a dedicated software like MCSS [76] , Solvation Energy for Exhaustive Docking (SEED) [83] or EADock [2] . The latter is particularly suited for the fragment-based approach since, thanks to its cluster-based sampling algorithm and its universally applicable scoring function, it is able to both map fragments favourable positions and dock complete molecules [2] . The positioned fragments are then automatically connected to each other using linkers, resulting in several complete molecules that satisfy all key interaction sites. On the contrary, the growing procedure (Fig. 2C) starts from a single fragment located at one of the key interaction site of the target. This fragment can be chosen by the user or by the program. The structure is then grown from this first fragment iteratively, piece-by-piece. Each addition is made so as to yield favourable interactions between the target and the new fragments, while keeping those already shown by the starting molecule. Connection rules are derived from the existence of certain bonds in organic compounds, or from organic synthesis reactions. Both growing and linking strategies have strengths and weaknesses [59] . Growing might run into difficulties if the active site contains several distinct pockets separated by a large gap in which the interactions between a ligand and the protein are limited. When using a linking approach, slightly misplaced fragments or fragments with loosely defined spatial orientation (like a phenyl ring with no preferred orientation in a large lipophilic binding pocket) can lead to the construction of a suboptimal molecule. We should not expect ab initio FBD to yield nanomolar compounds in the first instance. Rather, the methods will probably design new perspective lead compounds of medium affinity, which will be the starting point of further optimization [59] . However, FBD techniques already contributed to generate an impressive number of high affinity ligands [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] and drug leads for clinical trials, although they were only recently adopted in the drug discovery pipeline. FBD represents a very promising technique to address tomorrow's challenges of drug discovery. The results of this search will provide commercially available molecules, thus for which the synthesis has likely been described and optimized. It is also possible to assess the synthetic accessibility of the candidate compounds by an additional software attempting to define synthetic routes and select potential precursors from databases of available compounds [89, 92] . Similarly, scoring functions have been established recently that try to mimic the intuition of the organic chemist and estimate the synthetic feasibility of molecules by examining their chemical structures, without suggesting any retro-synthesis [93] .
