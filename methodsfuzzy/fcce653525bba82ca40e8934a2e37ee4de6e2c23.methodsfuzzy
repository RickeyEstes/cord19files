The study setting and procedures have been previously described. 11 Between May 2014 and May 2015, we enrolled participants from consecutive cohorts of recruits undertaking basic military training at two Royal Thai Army (RTA) barracks in Bangkok. Trainees entered the camps at the start of May and November each year and remained in the camps for 10 weeks. The camps consist of large, common sleeping quarters with beds arranged foot-to-foot in long rows. Trainees share meals in a common canteen and train in a large field in the center of the barracks and a number of ancillary buildings. Each camp has its own medical unit. Individuals were eligible for enrollment if they were aged ³ 18 years and were entering one of the two army barracks involved in the study. Suspected tuberculosis cases or individuals with immune deficiencies, such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome, leukemia, or lymphoma, were excluded. Individuals providing informed consent were enrolled in the study and a demographic and clinical questionnaire was administered. Participants were then followed up for symptoms of respiratory illness until the end of the 10-week training period. At one camp, nasal and throat swabs were obtained at the time of enrolment and at the end of the follow-up period (10 weeks later) from consenting participants. Participants experiencing respiratory symptoms were asked to consult the medical unit, where medical staff took a history, conducted a medical examination, and recorded symptoms of upper respiratory illness (URI) or influenza-like illness (ILI). Upper respiratory illness was defined as an illness with at least two of the following: 1) runny nose or sneezing; 2) nasal congestion; 3) sore throat, hoarseness, or difficulty swallowing; 4) cough; 5) swollen or tender glands in the neck; and 6) fever (oral temperature > 38°C) at the time of presentation. Influenza-like illness was defined as a respiratory illness with acute onset presenting with fever and cough or sore throat. All ILI cases also met the case definition for URI. Non-ILI cases were defined as URI cases not meeting the case definition for ILI. Additional nasal and throat swabs were requested from participants presenting with acute ILI or URI. Laboratory investigations. Nasal and throat swabs were placed in viral transport media and stored at −20°C until transfer to the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences for further testing. We tested acute swabs for influenza virus using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) following the U.S. Centers for Disease Control protocol. 12, 13 We also tested acute samples (from both camps) and the routine enrolment and follow-up specimens (from one camp) using a multiplex real-time PCR assay comprising 33 bacterial, viral, and fungal targets (FTD33 kit; Fast Track Diagnostics, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg). A cycle threshold value of < 33 was considered a positive result. Previous studies have shown high agreement between FTD33 and other commercial multiplex assays with specificities > 95% for most viral targets. 14,15 Sensitivity for influenza A and B, and human coronaviruses is high (> 90%), but is lower and more variable for other viral targets, including human bocavirus (80-92%), rhinovirus (61-75%), respiratory syncytial virus (50-72%), and human metapneumovirus (74-100%). 14, 15 In a subset of recruits, we measured influenza antibody titers in paired sera taken at enrollment and at the end of followup using a hemagglutinin inhibition assay. Seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold rise in influenza subtype-specific antibody titers. Statistical analysis. Rates of illness. Individuals were considered at risk from the date they entered the camp for a period of 10 weeks. We computed the rates of URI and ILI as the number of cases of each outcome divided by the total person-time at risk, using robust standard errors in the calculation of 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to allow for clustering of illness episodes by camp and cohort. Disease etiology. We determined the percentage of URI and ILI cases positive for each target pathogen, the percentage positive for more than one pathogen, and the percentage with no pathogen identified. Influenza seroconversion. We calculated the percentage of recruits who seroconverted, overall and by influenza subtype, based on a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between baseline and end of follow-up samples. Bacterial colonization. We determined the percentage of recruits with a positive identification of a bacterial pathogen at recruitment, the overall change in colonization prevalence between baseline and end of follow-up for each bacterial species, and the risk of acquisition of bacterial pathogens over the follow-up period among those initially negative. Antibiotic use. We calculated the percentage of URI and ILI cases that were prescribed antibiotics and investigated clinical signs and symptoms associated with antibiotic prescription using logistic regression. Among those prescribed antibiotics, we determined the fraction of cases with a likely viral etiology based on the available Fast Track multiplex PCR results. Analyses were conducted using Stata 11 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) and R 3.2.2. Ethical approval. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the RTA in Bangkok, Thailand, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. All participants provided written informed consent.
