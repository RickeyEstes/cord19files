The subjects were 154 men and 266 women volunteers 18 to 54 years old. All reported no chronic or acute illness or regular medication regimen and were judged in good health following examination. During their first two days in the clinical unit, they were given a thorough medical examina tion, completed psychological stress, personality, and health practice ques tionnaires and had blood drawn for immune and cotinine assessments. Subsequently, volunteers were exposed via nasal drops to a low infectious dose of one of five respiratory viruses: rhinovirus types 2 (n = 86), 9 (n = 122), 14 (n = 92), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 40), and corona virus type 229E (n = 54). An additional 26 volunteers received saline. For 2 days before and 7 days after viral challenge, volunteers were quarantined in large apartments (alone or with one or two others). Starting 2 days before viral challenge and continuing through 6 days postchallenge, each volunteer was examined daily by a clinician using a standard respiratory sign-symptom protocol. Examples of items on the protocol include sneezing, watering of eyes, nasal stuffiness, sore throat, hoarseness, and cough. The protocol also included an objective count of the number of tissues used daily by a volun teer and body temperature (oral) assessed twice each day. Samples of nasal secretions were also collected daily to assess whether volunteers were infec ted by the experimental virus. Approximately 28 days after challenge a second serum sample was collected to assess changes in viral-specific anti body. All investigators were blind to volunteers' psychological status and to whether they received virus or saline.
