The sampling design used to collect data for the National Swine Survey involved multiple frames (areas and lists) and was multistaged (herds, farrowing buildings within herd, and rooms within buildings) with selection of monitored farrowing units with known probability. The scheme is described in detail elsewhere (USDA:APHIS: VS, 1992; Tubbs et al.. 1993 ).
