Research. The relationship between disease and syndrome is thought to be one of the most significant problems in TCM clinical and basic practice. As a new mode for syndrome research, disease-syndrome combination mainly refers to absorbing the idea and theory of disease differentiation in western medicine (WM) as 2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine well as syndrome differentiation in TCM. The mode, which originates from the medical practice since more than half a century ago, has realized mutual compensation of advantages of TCM and WM [1, 2] . Combining whole thinking, imagery thinking, and dialectical thinking in TCM with materialism of modern medical sciences, the mode can be regarded as a good cut-in point and successful control pattern for integrative medicine [3] . It has complementary advantages of WM and TCM and marks a new era created by integrative medicine in clinical researches. Seminar on the academician Chen Keji's academic thinking about "the new mode of disease-syndrome combination and its application in clinical practice" was held in Beijing on May 23, 2011. Professor Chen and his students discussed the scientific connotation of this new mode and its application in diagnosis, treatment, and scientific research together. China news of traditional Chinese medicine, a famous domestic media, made followup report on the symposium, which had evoked large repercussions. Academician Chen Keji pointed out that modern view of disease-syndrome combination includes six aspects: (a) mode of disease differentiation by WM combined with syndrome differentiation by TCM; (b) mode of syndrome differentiation and treatment combined with specific prescription for certain illness; (c) mode of treating according to disease staging; (d) mode of differentiation of the basic pathogenesis combined with syndrome differentiation and treatment in TCM; (e) mode of treating according to syndrome differentiation rather than disease differentiation when there's no disease can be diagnosed in WM; (f) mode of treating according to disease differentiation rather than syndrome differentiation when there's no syndrome can be diagnosed in TCM [4] . The emphasis of the mode could be played on either syndrome or disease. As the connotation of syndrome in TCM is significantly different from disease in WM, laying special emphasis on syndrome means that syndrome is just the basis of therapeutic scheme. On the contrary, effective therapeutic plans should be formulated according to disease differentiation when special emphasis is laid on disease. This new mode is beneficial to the original innovation in diagnosis and treatment. The advantages of the mode include four aspects as follows. (a) Definitely diagnosing. As the disease diagnosis in TCM is vague and extensive, it is entirely necessary and possible to absorb some relevant achievements of disease diagnosis in WM for definitely diagnosing. (b) Targeted treating. As the new mode pays more attention to the therapeutic evaluation of disease, it could achieve more definite therapeutic targets and stable curative effect compared with syndrome differentiation mode alone. (c) Accurately prognosing. Summarization of clinical phenomena is the principal judgment basis for prognosis in TCM, therefore, the prognosis judgment is always not very accurate. However, the new mode has vital guidance value for treatment and prognosis judgment. (d) Deepening classics. Due to the succinctness and conciseness of TCM classics, the essential features of the disease and syndrome could be rerecognized and deepened through combining with the modern cognition of pathology, diagnostics and pharmacology study in WM. Syndrome is not only the core of TCM basic theory and syndrome differentiation, but also the bridge to associate disease and formula. Different from diagnosis based on pathological mechanism, syndrome is a classification according to subjective symptom and objective sign collected by physical examination [5] [6] [7] . Premise studies on diseasesyndrome combination lies in syndrome diagnostic criteria and therapeutic evaluation system. Researches on syndrome diagnostic criteria aim at establishing the scientific and normative diagnosis system, while researches on therapeutic evaluation aim at constructing an objective evaluation system. Under the leadership of academician Chen Keji, we are the first to study and report on blood stasis syndrome in coronary heart disease based on the new mode. Contributed to the diagnosis of blood stasis syndrome in coronary heart disease, 19 items such as precordial pain, dark purple tongue color, and erythrocyte deformability were selected based on the calculation analysis of 48 kinds of examination items in 92 cases patients with coronary heart disease. And the clinical diagnosis accordance rate was 89%. 6 items giving the greatest contribution to diagnosis such as blood viscosity and total cholesterol (TC) were confirmed by a stepwise regression analysis for 21 items such as hemorheology and blood lipid [8] . Correlation analysis of blood stasis syndrome and pathological changes shown in coronary angiography with coronary heart disease showed that the blood stasis syndrome score was significantly correlated to the maximal stenosis degree and coronary lesion score demonstrated by coronary angiography before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and the correlation was increased along with the increasing of the patients' age and the course of the disease. Conclusions were also verified in our related researches [9] [10] [11] . Through mathematical statistics method and computational intelligence approach, it was found out that the major syndrome factors of coronary heart disease are blood stasis, qi deficiency, turbid phlegm, qi stagnation, heat deposition, yang deficiency, yin deficiency, and cold coagulation based on calculation analysis of 5099 cases patients reported on literatures and 1069 cases patients with coronary heart disease validated by coronary angiographic. We also constructed the diagnosis scales of blood stasis syndrome and its accompanied syndromes in coronary heart disease, such as qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome and qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome [12] [13] [14] . In the study of therapeutic evaluation system, taking coronary heart disease as example, important indexes such as syndrome evaluation scale, clinical critical events, and quality of life were selected on the basis of completely evaluating the present indexes through application of clinical epidemiology-/evidencebased medicine method. Meanwhile, high validity and reliability of therapeutic evaluation system of coronary heart disease was constructed through comprehensive analysis of various index by the hall for workshop of metasynthetic engineering. Clinical efficacy scale of TCM syndrome and the primitive entry pool of scale for patient-reported outcomes of coronary heart disease were established by our team [15] .
