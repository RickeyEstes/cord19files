Cell lines and cysteine-reactive reagents. Human 293 cells were obtained from the ATCC. Avian DF-1 cells that produce a replication-competent ALV-A encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (RCASBP(A)-EGFP, DF-1-ALV-A), a 293-derived cell line that expresses Tva (293-Tva or 2.1), and a 293-derived cell line that expresses mCAT-1 (293-mCAT) have been previously described [15] . These cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mM L-glutamine, 100 U of penicillin/ml, and 100 lg of streptomycin/ml at 37 8C in 5% CO 2 . The growth medium of 293-Tva cells was supplemented with 1 lg/ml puromycin. N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) was obtained from Sigma. PEOmaleimide biotin (PMB) and Sulfo-NHS-biotin (SNB) were obtained from Pierce. Antibodies. Affinity purified, polyclonal rabbit antisera against the C-terminus of TM (TM-1) has been described previously [15] . Goat antisera against Tween/ether disrupted Rous sarcoma virus Prague C (74S-389) was originally made at the NCI and distributed through Viromed. The anti-SU mAB mc8C5 was obtained from the hybridoma facility at the University of Alabama at Birmingham [37] . Virus and sTva production. DF-1-ALV-A cells were grown in roller bottles with extended surface area in 50 mls of medium. Supernatants were harvested twice a day, and individual collections were pooled until 1 L of supernatant accumulated. Supernatants were pre-cleared by low speed centrifugation and filtered through 0.45-lm filters to remove cells and cell debris. Aliquots were frozen for later use. Virus was purified and concentrated by pelleting through a sucrose cushion (15% sucrose in 10 mM HEPES, 130 mM NaCl [pH 8.0]) for 1 hour at 4 8C at 113,000 x g (max) in a SW28 swinging bucket rotor (Beckman). The virus pellet was re-suspended in HN buffer (10 mM HEPES, 130 mM NaCl [pH 8.0]) for 1 hour at 4 8C before use. Plasmids encoding Friend MLV Env, MLV gag-pol, and MLV LTR-EGFP have been described [15] . To generate MLV virions, equal amounts of these plasmids were transfected into 293 cells using Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate chimeric virions with ALV-A Env on MLV cores, a previously described plasmid encoding ALV-A Env (pAB6-Env A) was substituted for the MLV Env-encoding plasmid in the transfection [15] . sTva was purified from E. coli as previously described [6] . Inhibition of infection by PMB. Virus was concentrated from supernatants by two cycles of ultracentrifugation through a 15% sucrose cushion in HN buffer, resuspended in a small volume of HN for 1 h at 4 8C, and incubated with 10 lM sTva to allow binding. PMB was dissolved in HN buffer and diluted into the virus/sTva samples to the indicated final concentrations. The pH of the concentrated solutions (pH 8.0) was verified prior to addition to the virus. Samples were incubated at 37 8C for 30 min, cooled on ice, serially diluted in growth medium supplemented with 40 mM HEPES, and added on ice to 12-well plates of 293-mCAT (for MLV infection) or 293-Tva cells (for ALV-A and chimeric ALV/MLV infections) that were pre-chilled to 4 8C. Plates were centrifuged for 2 hours at 1640 x g in an Allegra 6R centrifuge (Beckman) at 4 8C and then centrifuged for an additional 30 minutes while the temperature was gradually raised to 35 8C as previously described. Plates were then transferred to a 37 8C incubator and cultured for 36-48 hours before being fixed in paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry for EGFP expression. TM trimer formation assay and liposome preparation. Pelleted virus was resuspended in a small volume of HN buffer supplemented with 1 mM CaCl 2 (HNC) and incubated for 20 minutes on ice with the indicated concentration of sTva to allow binding, for 30 min at 37 8C at pH 8.0, and then for 30 min at 37 8C at pH 5.0 or 8.0 in predetermined volumes of 100 mM Tris-acetate or Tris-HCl. Where indicated, 1 mM PMB was added to the samples after the 20 min incubation with sTva on ice. The samples were then neutralized with 1 M HEPES, pH 8.0, lysed with 1% SDS, and incubated for 10 minutes at 37 8C. Samples were reduced with 100 mM DTT and analyzed by immunoblot after SDS-PAGE on 13% polyacrylamide gels with an antibody against the carboxyl-terminus of TM as described previously [6] . To study the effects of the R99 peptide inhibitor of ALV-A infection on trimer formation, R99 (FNLSDHSESIQKKFQLM-KEHVNKIG) and R992XP (FNLSDHSESPQKKPQLMKEHVNKIG) were synthesized to .95% purity by Research Genetics (Invitrogen) with N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amidation. Liposomes were created from a mixture of a 1:1:1:1.5 molar ratio of phoshatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol. Lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), mixed in chloroform, dried under argon, and lyophilized in glass tubes. The mixture was then rehydrated with HN buffer by shaking for 1 hour, sonicated in a water bath sonicator for 10 min, and extruded 25 times with an Avanti mini-extruder using a 100 nm pore size filter. Virus was mixed with liposomes with or without 100 nM sTva on ice. The R99 and R992XP peptides were dissolved in HN buffer, added to the virus/liposome/sTva mixtures to a final concentration of 100 lM, and incubated at pH 8 for 20 min at 37 8C. Samples were then adjusted to the indicated pH and incubated for 30 min at 378C prior to neutralization and analysis as described above. To study the integrity of the SU-TM disulfide bond, samples were incubated with or with 100 nM sTva at pH 8.0 for 20 min on ice and then for 30 min at 37 8C at pH 5.0 or pH 7.4. Samples were neutralized, exposed to 100 mM DTT or buffer, and incubated at RT or 100 8C for 5 min prior to SDS-PAGE and analysis by immunoblot for TM. Immunoblots were then stripped with SDS/DTT and probed for SU using the mc8C5 mAb. To study the formation of the TM trimer induced by PMB, virus was incubated with or without the indicated concentrations of sTva for 20 min on ice at pH 8.0. Samples were then exposed to 1 mM PMB or buffer at the indicated pH for 30 min at 37 8C. Samples were neutralized and analyzed by immunoblot for TM as above. Modification of SU by PMB. Virus was concentrated from super-natants by two cycles of ultracentrifugation through a 15% sucrose cushion in HN buffer, resuspended in a small volume of HN for 1 h at 4 8C, and incubated with 1.5 lM sTva to allow binding. PMB or SNB were dissolved in HN buffer and diluted into the virus/Tva samples to a final concentration of 1 mM. After incubation for 30 min at 37 8C, samples were quenched with a molar excess of cysteine-HCl (PMB) or glycine (SNB). Samples were lysed with NP-40 and immunoprecipitated with the antibody against the C-terminus of TM using Protein A beads (Pierce). Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in gel loading dye containing DTT, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed for biotin with streptavidin-HRP. Mass spectrometry analysis of SU. Concentrated ALV-A was thawed on ice, and sTva was added to 5 lM. After incubation for 20 min on ice, NEM was added to 10 mM and incubated for 1 h at 37 8C. The sample was then concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and washed twice with cold acetone. The pellet was dried, re-suspended in SDS-PAGE loading dye with DTT, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF. The PVDF fragment containing the glycosylated SU was excised from the membrane, dried, and then boiled for 10 min in denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS with 1% bmercaptoethanol). PNGase F (New England Biolabs) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 8C. The deglycosylated sample was resolved by a second round of SDS-PAGE, quantified by SYPRO Ruby (Invitrogen) stain against a standard curve, excised from the gel, and submitted for analysis. The SU sample was reduced, alkylated, and digested with protease at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. Samples were analyzed by microcapillary reverse-phase HPLC nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Thermo Finnigan LCQ DECA XP Plus quadropole ion trap mass spectrometer. Mutagenesis and production of stable cell lines. Amino acid substitutions in ALV-A Env were generated by PCR mutagenesis using overlapping primers. For each amino acid substitution, at least two base pairs of the codon were changed to minimize the chance of reversion. Initial PCR products were subcloned into a shuttle vector comprised of a Kpn I/Sal I restriction fragment of RCASBP(A)-EGFP in the pAB6-Env A vector, and mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing. This restriction fragment comprises the entire Env ORF including some 59 UTR sequence. A Kpn I/Stu I restriction fragment from the shuttle vector was then cloned into the RCASBP(A)-EGFP plasmid, and the presence of the mutation was again confirmed by sequencing. Mutant RCASBP(A)-EGFP plasmids were transfected into DF-1 cells with Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions to generate virus. Transfection was confirmed by EGFP expression. Replication-competent viruses were identified by monitoring the spread of acquired EGFP expression in the transfected cultures. Single cell clones of cells expressing noninfectious virus were produced by co-transfecting the RCASBP(A)-EGFP plasmid bearing the mutation with pBABE-puro, a puromycin expression plasmid. Cells were selected in puromycin (1 lg/ml), and colonies expressing EGFP were isolated and expanded. EGFP-positive clones were periodically tested to confirm the noninfectious phenotype by co-culture with uninfected DF-1 cells or by analyzing DF-1 cells exposed to filtered supernatant for acquired EGFP expression. The presence of the mutation was again confirmed by PCR and sequencing of the provirus in the transfected cells. For replicationcompetent mutant viruses, the mutation was confirmed in cells infected with filtered virus from the initially transfected cells to verify that the mutation could be stably transmitted. Virus titers in the supernatant of cells producing mutant viruses were determined by endpoint dilution on DF-1 cells. Env incorporation of mutant virus purified from supernatant by centrifugation (as above) was determined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using the antibody against the carboxyl-terminus of TM. SU-A IgG binding assay. The SU-A IgG expression construct was a gift from J. A. T. Young (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) [38] . The Cys38Ser mutation was engineered in this vector by PCR mutagenesis using overlapping primers and verified by sequencing. 293 cells were transfected with the SU-A IgG and Cys38Ser SU-A IgG constructs using Polyfect (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, and the media was replaced with media that had been pre-cleared of IgG by two rounds of affinity purification using an immobilized protein A column (Pierce). Media was collected after 24 hrs, filtered through a 0.45 lm filter, and frozen. To isolate SU-A IgG, filtered supernatants were thawed and applied to an immobilized protein A column (Pierce). The column was washed with 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 and eluted with 0.1 M citric acid pH 3.0. Fractions were immediately neutralized with 1.5 M Tris pH 8.8. Peak fractions were identified by immunoblot, pooled, dialyzed against PBS, and concentrated using a Microcon device according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amicon). Purified, concentrated protein was quantified by SYPRO Ruby stain against a standard curve. To determine the binding of SU-A IgG to Tva, 293 (negative control) or 293-Tva cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of SU-A IgG or Cys38Ser SU-A IgG for 1 hour on ice in PBS/ 1% FBS. Cells were washed twice with PBS/1% FBS and incubated with an Oregon green 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) for 1 hr on ice. Cells were washed twice and analyzed by flow cytometry. Liposome association assay. Liposomes were created as described above. Pelleted virus was mixed with liposomes with or without 100 nM sTva and incubated for 45 min on ice. The R99 peptide was dissolved in HN buffer, added to the virus/liposome/sTva mixtures to a final concentration of 100 lM, and incubated at pH 8 for 30 min at 37 8C. Samples were then adjusted to the indicated pH, incubated for 30 min at 37 8C, and neutralized with 1 M Hepes. Neutralized samples were mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in HNC, transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube (170 ll sample volume), and overlaid with 30% sucrose (340 ll) and 15% sucrose (100 ll) in HNC. Samples were centrifuged at 48C for 1 hr at 179,000 x g (ave) using a TLA 100.1 rotor (Beckman Coulter). Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblot using antisera against Rous sarcoma virus Prague C. Syncytia formation assay. Cultured monolayers of DF-1 or 293-Tva cells were stained with 0.8 lg/ml R18 in growth media for 1 hr at 37 8C. Labeled cells were washed with PBS, and DF-1 cells expressing Cys38Ser Env or wild type RCASBP(A)-EGFP were harvested with versene, co-plated with the R18 labeled cells, and incubated for 2 h at 37 8C to form monolayers. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and then incubated with PBS at the indicated pH values for 15 min at 37 8C. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and returned to normal growth media. After an additional 30 min to 1 h incubation at 37 8C, images were taken, and syncytia were identified as large, multinucleated cells with diffuse EGFP fluorescence and R18 positive membranes. Parallel samples were harvested with versene and analyzed by flow cytometry for EGFP and R18.
