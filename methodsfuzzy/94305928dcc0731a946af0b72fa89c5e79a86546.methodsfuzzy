We comprehensively reviewed the research status of medication for LRTIs in the elderly and antibiotics, which are currently in advanced stages of development (phase 3 trial and beyond). After systematically retrieving the following sources including Pubmed, MEDLINE (OvidSP), and EMBASE (OvidSP) from October 2010 to July 2018, we have collected 87 clinical trials and manual screened out 58 trials (thirty-seven Phases 1 and 2 trials, eighteen Phase 3 trials, three Phase 4 trials, respectively), and finally elaborated the advantages and limitations of the application of novel antibiotics in clinical practice based on these trials. All the random control trials (RCTs) included in our study share the following characteristics: trials included patients over 65 years of age who met at least three symptoms: cough, purulent sputum, dyspnea or pleurisy; if they had at least two abnormal vital signs, had at least one laboratory test result or clinical sign associated with LRTIs, and had radiologically confirmed pneumonia, these trials were classified as the risk classes in Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), ranging from II to V. All of the trials we included were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov to assess the efficacy and safety of certain antibiotics. Population analysis, end points, and assessments were considered. Analysis populations including the intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all subjects who underwent randomization. The clinically evaluable (CE) population was defined as subjects who survive with resolution or improvement in symptoms and infections that further antibacterial therapy was not required. The microbiologic intention-to-treat (mITT) population was defined as all subjects in the ITT population who had a causative pathogen or pathogens identified at baseline by the culture of blood or respiratory specimens or using a culture-independent method. The clinical per-protocol population was defined as subjects in the ITT population who had a qualifying infection as defined by the trial entry criteria, had received a trial agent, had not received any antibacterial agent that was not as signed within the trial that could confound interpretation of the trial results, and had undergone an assessment of results during the protocol defined window. The microbiologic per-protocol population included the patients in both the clinical per-protocol population and the mITT population. Regarding end points, firstly the primary efficacy end point was evaluated as early clinical response (ECR), which was defined as survival with improvement of one or more levels relative to baseline in two or more symptoms of pneumonia and no worsening of one or more levels in other symptoms of pneumonia, without receipt of rescue antibacterial therapy. Generally, ECR was assessed 24-72 h after the first dose of trial drug in the ITT population. The secondary end point was investigator-assessed clinical response at a post-treatment evaluation 5 to 10 days after the last dose, with clinical response defined as resolution or improvement in signs or symptoms to the extent that further antibacterial therapy was unnecessary. At the same time, we also evaluated the adverse reactions of antibiotics, including mild adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs) defined as adverse events emerged after treatment initiation, and treatment discontinuation. The mortality in both arms was also analyzed for the safety of certain agents.
