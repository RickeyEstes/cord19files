Isolation of Monocytes. Human PBMCs, obtained by leukapheresis of healthy volunteers (Dept. of Transfusion Medicine, NIH), were diluted in endotoxin-free PBS without Ca 2 ϩ and Mg 2 ϩ for density sedimentation. Monocytes and T cells were purified by elutriation (2, 3) . Monocytes were cultured in DMEM (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 2 mM l -glutamine and 10 g/ml gentamicin. For monocyte-derived macrophages, monocytes were adhered and cultured in supplemented DMEM and 10% FBS for 7-10 d. The human myelomonocytic U937 cell line (American Type Culture Collection) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mM l -glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 g/ml streptomycin, and 10% FBS at 37 Њ C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . Biotinylation of Recombinant Human SLPI (rhSLPI). rhSLPI (R&D Systems) was biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LCbiotin (Pierce Chemical Co.). rhSLPI and NHS-LC-biotin were diluted in PBS on ice and incubated for 2 h. To remove unreacted biotin, the mixture was centrifuged using centricon filters (YM-3; Millipore). After centrifugation, the sample was diluted in PBS, centrifuged twice, and the biotinylated protein concentration was determined (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Flow Cytometry. Cells were incubated with 10 g/ml rhSLPI for 60 min in DMEM at 37 Њ C, washed, and stained using 1 g/ ml of goat polyclonal anti-SLPI (R&D Systems) for 30 min at 4 Њ C. Antibody-treated cells were rinsed, incubated with FITCconjugated secondary antibody (donkey anti-goat; Jackson Im-munoResearch Laboratories), washed, and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) before analysis on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using CELL-Quest software (21, 22) . Additionally, cells were incubated with 1 g/ml of biotinylated rhSLPI for indicated intervals, washed, and then treated with streptavidin-FITC (Pierce Chemical Co.) in staining buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.01% sodium azide). For additional staining, elutriated T cells, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages detached from plastic with cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen) were suspended in PBS with 2% FBS and stained with 10 g/ml of polyclonal goat annexin II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and a secondary antibody (donkey anti-goat FITC; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Single and double labeling with PE-CD14, FITC-CCR5, PE-CD11c, or PE-CD4 (BD Biosciences) confirmed cell specificity in flow cytometry analysis. Fluorescence Microscopy. 10 6 cells cultured in four-chamber glass slides (Nunc) were incubated with biotinylated rhSLPI from 5 s to 60 min at 37 Њ C, washed, and neutravidin-FITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in PBS was added for 30 min at 4 Њ C. Slides were rinsed, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, incubated with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min, rinsed, and mounted with SlowFade (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) for fluorescence microscopy. In additional experiments, monocytes were plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates (2 ϫ 10 6 per well) and cultured as described above for 7-10 d. Before staining, coverslips were washed in PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and then incubated in 100 mM glycine in PBS at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were rinsed in PBS, methanol permeabilized at Ϫ 20 Њ C for 5 min, and then blocked in 10% donkey serum for 30 min. 2 g/ml of primary antibody (mouse anti-annexin II; Transduction Labs) was added in 2% donkey serum in PBS, washed, and incubated for 1 h in 20 g/ml Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Molecular Probes). Cells were washed twice in PBS, twice in dH 2 O, mounted using Fluormount G (Electron Microscopy Services), and visualized using the PerkinElmer UltraView LCI confocal system with a Nikon Eclipse microscope. For phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, Jurkat cells (200,000/ml) were treated with 0.2 M staurosporine at 37 Њ C for 7 h, washed, stained with 1 M carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 20 min, and washed before being added (4 ϫ 10 6 ) to macrophages on coverslips. After 10 min at 37 Њ C, the coverslips were vigorously washed, fixed, and stained for annexin II as described above. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot. 200-300 ϫ 10 6 monocytes in suspension or 7-10-d adhered macrophages were washed with PBS. Cell pellets were collected and incubated in sucrose lysis buffer (250 mM sucrose with complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail; Roche Applied Science) on ice, and then sonicated. The nuclear fractions were discarded after centrifugation (2,000 rpm at 4 Њ C) and the membrane fraction was resuspended in PBS with protease inhibitors, centrifuged (14,000 rpm for 30 min), and then the cytosol fraction was discarded. Membrane protein fractions were sonicated and proteins were quantitated (Bio-Rad Laboratories) before being precleared with normal IgG and UltraLink immobilized protein A/G beads (Pierce Chemical Co.) with rotation (30 min at 4 Њ C). The beads were pelleted (2,500 rpm) for 5 min at 4 Њ C. The supernatant was incubated with rhSLPI for 5-10 min on ice and rotated for 1-2 h at 4 Њ C with polyclonal goat anti-rhSLPI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse monoclonal anti-annexin II (IgG1; BD Biosciences), or anti-actin (IgG1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). UltraLink beads were added to this mixture and rotated overnight at 4 Њ C. The immunoprecipitates were boiled in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer after PBS wash and subjected to SDS-PAGE in Tris-glycine gels. For Western blot, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with 1 g/ml of polyclonal anti-SLPI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-annexin II, anti-actin, or anti-␣ -tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Chemiluminescent signal was detected using the Supersignal West Pico system (Pierce Chemical Co.). Whole cell lysates from A431 or Jurkat cell lines were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. Nano-Capillary HPLC Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Membrane protein fractions from monocyte (2-10 ϫ 10 9 ) or macrophage (2-10 ϫ 10 9 ) coimmunoprecipitations were pooled and separated on SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with colloidal blue, destained, photographed, and the desired protein band(s) was marked before storage at 4 Њ C. The gels were analyzed with LC-MS/MS of in-gel tryptic digests for subsequent protein identification by database searching (Wistar Institute). The output from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and nonredundant database search using SEQUEST consists of peptide sequences matched to protein(s) in the database searched by correlated predicted and observed peptide fragmentation patterns. RT-PCR. Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy minikit (QIAGEN). 2 g RNA was reverse transcribed by oligodeoxythymidylic acid primer (Promega) and the resulting 1 l cDNA was amplified by PCR. The primer sets for annexin II were ATGTCTACTGTTCACGAAATC (sense) and AAT-GAGAGAGTCCTCGTCGG (antisense). For normalization, GAPDH primer sets were GTGAAGGTCGGGAGTCAACG-GATTT (sense) and CACAGTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGTGAT (antisense). PCR was performed using 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 200 M deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 10 pmol of each primer, and 1 U Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). cDNA was amplified for 25 cycles with the following settings: 94 Њ C for 30 s, 55 Њ C for 30 s, and 68 Њ C for 30 s. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Inhibition of Annexin II. Annexin II siRNA 1 and 2 were synthesized based on the sequence r(GCACUGAAGUCAGCCUUAUUU)/r(AUAAGGCUG -ACUUCAGUGCUG) and r(CGGUGAUUUUGGGCCUAU-UUU)/r(AAUAGGCCCAAAAUCACCGUC; QIAGEN). An unrelated control siRNA was also purchased from QIAGEN. SiRNA was transfected into monocytes using the Amaxa Human Dendritic Cell Nucleofector kit following the protocol for nucleofection of suspension cells. The cells were incubated 6 d before analysis of annexin protein by Western blot and infection with HIV-1. HIV-1 Infection. Adherent macrophages were infected with R5 HIV-1 BAL grown in primary human macrophage cultures (50 l TCID 50 ϭ 10 4 /ml; Advanced Biotechnologies Inc.) for 2 h at 37 Њ C, unbound virus was washed away, and the cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS at 37 Њ C for 1-14 d (2, 3). One half of the supernatant was collected every 2-3 d and replaced with fresh medium. Supernatants were tested for HIV-1 p24 antigen by ELISA (PerkinElmer). For preparation of additional isolates, 60 ϫ 10 6 PHA-activated PBMCs were pelleted for 10 min at 1,500 rpm in a 15-ml conical tube, the supernatant was removed, and 1 ml of virus seed stock (HIV-1 JRCSF, ADA, and primary isolate Clade B 92US712; NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) was added to the target cells with gentle mixing. After 1-2 h of incubation, the cell/virus mixture was diluted to 30 ml with complete media (RPMI 1640, 10% FCS, 1% gentamycin, and 5% IL-2) and transferred to a T-25 tissue culture flask. On days 2, 4, 6, and 8 after infection, the cells were pelleted, the media was replaced, and day 6 and 8 culture supernatants were tested for p24 and RT activity, filtered through a 0.45-mm filter, vialed as 1.0-ml aliquots, and stored at Ϫ 70 Њ C before infection of macrophages. In indicated experiments, macrophages were pretreated for 1 h with 25 g/ml rabbit anti-annexin II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), 25 g/ml rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), or 10 g/ml SLPI before the addition of virus. Alternatively, the HIV-1 was preincubated with 10 g/ml annexin II tetramer (US Biological) for 1 h before being added to the macrophages. After HIV-1 coculture for 2 h, virus and/or added reagents were removed by washing cells with DMEM and fresh complete medium was added. For cell-binding experiments, macrophages were treated with anti-annexin II, control antibody, or SLPI for 30 min, washed, and virus was added for 30 min at 37 Њ C. The cells were washed extensively, lysed (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS), and p24 bound to the cells quantitated by ELISA. For infection of elutriated T cells, PHA-blasted T cells were infected with HIV-1 IIIB (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc.) for 2 h, washed, cultured for 2-8 d, and supernatants were collected every 2-3 d for p24 ELISA. In some experiments, T cells were pretreated with rabbit anti-annexin II or rabbit IgG before infection. Cell-free Binding Assay. 96-well plates (Nunc immunoplates with maxiSorp surface; Nunc) were coated with 60 g/ml BSA (Sigma-Aldrich), annexin II tetramer, IgG, or gp120 (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) overnight at 4 Њ C, washed with PBS, and blocked or not with 1% BSA for 1-2 h. After two PBS washes, 100 l HIV-1 BaL (10 4 /ml) was added for 1 h at 4 Њ C (3). After multiple washes with PBS, 100 l of lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100) was added. Virus was quantified by p24 ELISA. PCR for Viral DNA. For a PCR-based assay for newly synthesized viral DNA (3), 200 l of DNase-treated HIV-1 BaL (10 4 / ml) was added to macrophages preincubated with anti-annexin II or control antibody for 30-60 min at 37 Њ C. After 2 h of coculture, the cells were washed three times with PBS, treated with trypsin-EDTA (0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mmol/l EDTA for 5 min at 24 Њ C) to remove noninternalized virus particles, washed twice with DMEM and 10% FCS, and incubated for 18-36 h. Cells were then washed, harvested in lysis buffer (100 mmol/l KCl, 10 mmol/l Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mmol/l MgCl 2 , 0.5% Tween 20, and 0.5% NP-40), and 1 g of DNA was subjected to nested primer PCR amplification (25 l total volume). The first 35cycle round of amplification used primers corresponding to the env gene (nucleotide 8838 to 8358, HIV-1HXB2 sequence) and the U3 region of the 3 Ј long terminal repeat (nucleotide 9533 to 9558). Each cycle consisted of denaturation for 1 min at 94 Њ C, annealing for 1 min at 55 Њ C, and elongation for 1 min at 72 Њ C. PCR reactions (2.5 l each) from the first amplification were then subjected to a second 30-cycle amplification round using primers (5 Ј primer, nucleotide 8754 to 8782; 3 Ј primer, nucleotide 9436 to 9457) located within the nef gene. PCR products ( ‫ف‬ 730 bp) from the second amplification were visualized by ethidium bromide staining after agarose gel electrophoresis.
