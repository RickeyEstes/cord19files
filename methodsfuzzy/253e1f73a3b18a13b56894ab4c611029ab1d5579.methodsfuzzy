The diagnosis of any infectious disease requires active communication between clinicians and clinical laboratory personnel, usually in the form of "consultations" from clinicians to the laboratory director "on call" or directly with the laboratory technologists. Arriving at a correct diagnosis in a timely fashion begins with the acquisition of an adequate clinical specimen (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, respiratory secretions, bronchoalveolar lavage, feces, etc.) and its transportation to the laboratory in an appropriate container. Specimens for molecular diagnostic tests sometimes require different methods of transportation/ preservation from those of regular specimens so as to ensure that the techniques, used efficiently, will detect the suspected infectious agent. The classic diagnostic principles in clinical medicine still apply when using molecular methods of diagnosis. Patients and populations are evaluated clinically and epidemiologically, and case definitions are created so that test parameters, such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values, can be defined. Likewise, understanding the concept of screening versus confirmatory testing is also important. The three major steps performed in molecular assays are specimen processing, nucleic acid amplification or hybridization, and product detection (Nolte and Caliendo, 2007; Persing et al., 2004) . Processing of the specimen is one of the most important steps for the successful detection of nucleic acids. Protocols vary, depending on the specimen received, and the specimen "matrix" plays an important role in nucleic acid extraction, owing to the presence of extraneous material in some matrices, that could potentially interfere with the molecular assays being performed. The most widely known example of such interference is the presence of Taq polymerase inhibitors in nucleic acid extracts, leading to false-negative results. Nucleic acid extraction protocols are usually cumbersome, and automation has been relatively challenging. However, several instruments have been designed for the clinical laboratory in which automated extraction protocols have been incorporated. Automation has also been incorporated for nucleic acid amplification methods, including conventional and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), branched DNA, and isothermal technologies that obviate the usual thermal cycling and potentially speed up the time required for amplification. Automated platforms, however, have decreased the cycling time by changing more quickly the temperatures required for different PCR cycles. Real-time PCR systems are usually coupled with automated detection systems that also vary in complexity. A few instruments are also capable of complete automation, including extraction, nucleic acid amplification, and detection systems. Tables 7.1 and 7.2 present a summary of the techniques available for the detection of nucleic acids from infectious agents.
