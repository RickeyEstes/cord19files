A 15-20% suspension of faeces was prepared in PBS by shaking for 2-3 min in a Griffin flask shaker at maximum speed. An aliquot of the mixture was allowed to stand for 20 min at 4Â°C to permit the gross debris to sediment. A drop of the mixture was placed on Fomavar-carbon-coated grid, and after 2-3 min the surplus fluid was withdrawn off with a filter paper and the grids negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (PTA, pH 6.6). The faecal homogenates from method 1 were diluted to a 2-5% suspension and centrifuged at 750 X g for 10 min in an MSE (Measuring and Scientific Equipment Ltd., Sussex, England) bench centrifuge to remove the debris. The supernatant fluid was collected for the preparation of grids as described previously (Narang and Codd, 1979) . Briefly, Fomavar-carbon-coated grids were placed at the bottom of flat bottom plastic tubes containing 200 ~1 of distilled water. Five to seven ~1 of the supernatant fluid were expelled into each tube. These tubes were then spun horizontally for 30 min at a speed of 3700 rpm (2100 x g) in an MSE bench centrifuge. After the run the grids were removed, dried and negatively stained with PTA. Method 3 Five ml of the faecal suspension were spun at 3000 rpm for 30 min in the MSE bench centrifuge and after the run the supernatant fluid was ultracentrifuged (30,000 x g) for 2 h and the deposits were used to prepare grids. Method 4 About 1 ml of the faecal supernatant fluid spun at 750 rpm was taken in a 60x7 mm Dreyer's tube and four drops of calcium phosphate, well mixed before use, were added to each tube. The mixture was left in the tube for 10 min for adsorption, with gentle mixing about ever 3 min. After the end of the adsorption time the calcium phosphate was allowed to settle to the bottom of the tube (about 5 min) and the fluid decanted and discarded. The calcium phosphate was washed three times by filling the tube with PBS and then allowing the calcium phosphate to settle and the supernatant fluid decanted. Finally, 100 t~,l of saturated versene (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt, 9.8 g/100 ml, pH 7.2) were added to each tube to dissolve the calcium phosphate. The mixtures were used to prepare grids by a low-speed centrifugation technique (Narang and Codd, 1980) . Five to seven ~1 of the dissolved calcium phosphate mixture were used to prepare the grids by low-speed centrifugation as described in method 2. The grids were stained with PTA and examined with an AEI electron microscope at a standard magnification of x25.000.
