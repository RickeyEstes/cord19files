To identify nucleic acid-protein interactions, genomic SELEX has been developed. Unlike randomized-sequence nucleic acids in conventional SELEX process, the starting libraries in genomic SELEX are derived from the genome of the organism of interest. Wholecell SELEX is a method developed and modified for creating aptamers binding to live cells including bacteria. Because the targets in whole-cell SELEX are live tumor cells or pathogenic bacteria, aptamers can find and more effectively bind to the surface molecules of target cells (than those in conventional SELEX approaches) and should have little cross-reactivity with the nontargets. Aptasensors are biosensors in which the biological recognition elements are DNA or RNA aptamers. 159 In recent years, more and more aptasensors have been designed for possible diagnostic applications. Major detection methods include (a) optical transduction, (b) electrochemical detection and (c) mass sensitive detection. In the following subsection, the basic principles of aptasensor-based detection are briefly discussed.
