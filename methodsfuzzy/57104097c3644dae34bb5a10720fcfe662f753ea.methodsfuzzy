Proton ( 1 H) and carbon 13 C{ 1 H} NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker AV 400 (400/100 MHz), AMX 500 (500/125 MHz), Jeol JNM-ECA 600 (600/150 MHz) or Bruker AVANCE III 800 (800/200 MHz) spectrometer. The 1 H NMR data were reported as peak multiplicities: s for singlet; d for doublet; dd for doublet of doublets; t for triplet; td for triplet of doublet; q for quartet; quin for quintet; bs for broad singlet and m for multiplet. Coupling constants were reported in Hertz. The chemical shifts were reported as ppm (d) relative to the solvent peak. All reactions were routinely carried out under an inert atmosphere of dry nitrogen. IKA RCT basic type heating mantle was used to provide a constant heat source. Microwave-assisted reactions were carried out in sealed vessels using a Biotage Initiatorþ US/JPN (part no. 356007) microwave reactor and the reaction temperatures were monitored by an external surface IR sensor. High resolution mass spectra were measured with electrospray-ionization quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-Q-TOF) techniques. Melting points were recorded on Barnstead electrothermal 9100 instrument and are uncorrected. Reactions were checked by thin layer chromatography (Kieselgel 60 F254, Merck). Spots were detected by viewing under a UV light, and by colorizing with charring after dipping in a p-anisaldehyde solution. The crude compounds were purified by column chromatography on a silica gel (Kieselgel 60, 70e230 mesh, Merck). All the anhydrous solvents were redistilled over CaH 2 , or P 2 O 5 , or sodium/ benzophenone prior to the reaction. To a stirred solution of 6 [17] (6.4 g, 14. 5 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (105 mL) at À78 C, under nitrogen atmosphere were added chlorotrietylsilane (9.73 mL, 58.0 mmol) and lithium bis (trimethylsilyl)amide (1.0 M solution in tetrahydrofuran, 29.0 mL, 29.0 mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred at À78 C for 1 h, warmed to 0 C and quenched using saturated aqueous NH 4 Cl (30 mL). The solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 Â 100 mL). The organic layer was dried using anhydrous MgSO 4 and concentrated in vacuo to give the crude silyl enol ether, which was used immediately for the next step without further purification. To a stirred solution of the crude silyl enol ether in anhydrous acetonitrile (120 mL) was added Selectfluor® (7.7 g, 21.8 mmol) at 0 C and the reaction mixture was stirred for 16 h at 0 C, diluted with brine (50 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 Â 100). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO 4 , filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexanes:ethyl acetate ¼ 5.6:1) to give 14 [17] (3.7 g, 84%) as colorless oil, which was equilibrated to the 6fluorogeminal diol. To a stirred solution of 14 (4.06 g, 8.89 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (120 mL) was slowly added sodium borohydride (0.5 mg, 13.34 mmol) at À40 C and the reaction mixture was stirred at À40 C for 1 h and then at 0 C for 3 h. The mixture was diluted with water (50 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 Â 100 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO 4 , filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexanes:ethyl acetate ¼ 11.5:1) to give 16a as colorless oil (  To a stirred solution of 14 [17] (5.7 g, 10.03 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (100 mL) at 0 C, under N 2 atmosphere were added triethylamine (7.0 mL, 50.15 mmol), chlorotriethylsilane (8.4 mL, 50.15 mmol) and lithium bis trimethylsilyl amide (1.0 M solution in tetrahydrofuran, 25.1 mL, 25.1 mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h, warmed to 0 C and quenched using saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution. The solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 Â 100 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO 4 and concentrated in vacuo to give the crude silyl enol ether, which was used immediately for the next step without further purification. To a stirred solution of the crude silyl enol ether in anhydrous acetonitrile (100 mL) was added a solution of Selectfluor® (7.11 g, 20.06 mmol) in acetonitrile (85 mL) at 0 C.
