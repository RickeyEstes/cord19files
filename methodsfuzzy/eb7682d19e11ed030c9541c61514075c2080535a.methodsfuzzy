Design of amplicon panel primers. We designed and evaluated 198 primers (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) divided into two primer pools that target most of the common bovine and small-ruminant bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic pathogens (43 pathogens) ( Table 1 ). These primers were designed using the Ion Ampliseq Designer (Ion Torrent; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), a primer design tool to create custom panels for targeted sequencing, and changes were made to the design with the assistance of the White Glove Team (Ion Torrent; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Because variations in targeted organisms could cause individual primers to fail, we designed multiple primers for most of the targeted organisms to provide redundancy. We initially evaluated the panel by sequencing reference strains and known isolates of bacteria, parasites, fungi, and viruses to determine the specificity of the method and to identify targets with poor or no sequencing coverage. The primer pools were redesigned to contain alternate primer sets for poorly sequencing targets, and the primer pools were then reevaluated. Nucleic acid extraction. Total nucleic acid was isolated using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), which has been shown to extract both DNA and RNA. A modification of the animal tissue protocol was employed, adding the following step: following mechanical disruption of the tissue, the sample supernatant was transferred to a bead tube (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and vortexed for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at Ն6,000 ϫ g (8,000 rpm) for 1 to 2 min. Then, the manufacturer's protocol was followed for purification of the nucleic acid through the column. For fecal/enteric clinical samples, an additional step was added: following resuspension of the fecal sample in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) or mechanical disruption of the tissue (intestine), the sample supernatant was exposed to two freeze/thaw cycles (Ϫ80°C followed by heating at 70°C). Then, the sample supernatant was transferred to a bead tube, and the extraction process was continued as described above. For milk, a pellet was obtained from at least 5 ml of milk samples from individual animals or 30 ml from a bulk tank. Then, the cell pellet was suspended in 500 l PBS and transferred to a bead tube, and the extraction process was continued. Library preparation and next-generation sequencing. The sample DNA/RNA concentration was measured using a Tapestation 4200 in combination with the Agilent high-sensitivity D1000 screen tape assay kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Automated library preparation, template preparation, and chip loading were performed using the Ion Chef instrument. Automated preparation minimizes sample handling and lowers the chance of contamination, as well as providing reproducible chip loading. For library construction, up to 70 ng of DNA/RNA was amplified using the designed panel (Ampliseq; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Ion Ampliseq kit for Chef DL8, according to the manufacturer's protocol, with less than 15 min hands-on time. The kit allowed the preparation of 8 barcoded Ion Ampliseq libraries per Ion Chef run (8 different clinical cases) in about 7 h, depending on the number of cycles used for target amplification (21 cycles were used). Then, 50 pM of the 8 mixed libraries was templated and loaded on an Ion 314 chip using the Ion Chef instrument with the Ion PGM Hi-Q Chef kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer's instructions, in about 12 h (overnight). Briefly, the prepared library was clonally amplified on the Ion Chef system by emulsion PCR of library molecules captured on A negative extraction control (NEC) was used to detect any contamination that might occur during the extraction and/or the library preparation process. This automated workflow generated the results in 2 to 3 days from sample receipt. Data analysis. A reference file containing the sequences of the targeted pathogens and a bed file based on the locations of the designed primers were constructed and uploaded to the Ion Torrent suite software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The files were used for initial data analysis with the Torrent suite software. The Torrent suite software provides the tools that convert raw sequence data to informative results, including optimized signal processing, base calling, and sequence alignment in Bam file format. The generated Bam files were downloaded and evaluated with Geneious software (version 9.1.2; Biomatters). Finally, pathogen identifications were confirmed with NCBI BLAST. BLAST (E) values of less than 1 were considered acceptable. Assay analytical performance. Both analytical sensitivity (LOD) and specificity were determined to test the analytical performance of the assay. The relative analytical sensitivity was determined by testing relatively known quantities (based on qPCR/qRT-PCR results and C T values) of DNA from representatives of the viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogen groups, as well as viral RNA. Real-time PCR/RT-PCR assays were performed at the Tifton Veterinary Diagnostic and Investigational Laboratory (TVDIL), the Athens Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (AVDL), and the University of Tennessee Veterinary Medical Center Clinical Virology and Immunology Laboratories, with laboratory-validated procedures. Typically, for real-time PCR testing, higher C T values (above 35) are considered suspect, as they may represent only amplification/fluorescence artifacts or cross contamination (29) . Analytical specificity testing was performed to determine the ability of the assay to detect the intended targets without being affected by specimen-related conditions or cross-reactivity/interference of the host nucleic acid. The assay was evaluated by testing validated isolates/reference strains of all the pathogens (bacteria, parasites, fungi, and viruses) that can be detected using the panel (Table 1) . To better mimic clinical samples, a sample known to contain one pathogen based on previous testing was spiked with equal amounts of three or more of the tested isolates. Assay clinical evaluation and statistical analysis. Determination of the clinical sensitivity (PPA) and specificity (NPA) of an assay requires the evaluation of every detected pathogen in every clinical case and comparing the sensitivity/specificity with those of reference standards. Given the number of pathogens that the bovine-targeted NGS assay can detect, determining the exact PPA and NPA for all the individual targets is cost prohibitive for any veterinary diagnostic laboratory. To overcome this challenge, 60 different clinical cases (57 bovine and 3 caprine) that were submitted to TVDIL and AVDL, University of Georgia, for diagnostic testing from 2015 to 2017 were included in a comparative study. The samples tested were feces (enteritis cases), milk (mastitis cases), and pooled tissue (a portion of the affected tissue was usually used, for example, lung or trachea for respiratory cases; the affected section of the intestine for enteric cases; and placenta, fetal lung, liver, kidney, brain, or stomach contents in cases of abortion). Each case was tested using the designed targeted NGS assay, along with routine laboratory diagnostic methods (reference methods). The routine diagnostic tests included bacterial cultures, DFAT, enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), PCR, qRT-PCR, and qPCR. When there was a discordant result between the targeted NGS and one of the routine diagnostic assays, the sample was examined by another, more sensitive/specific (generally PCR) diagnostic assay. The clinical cases included 16 mastitis cases, 15 respiratory cases, 20 enteric cases (2 caprine and 18 bovine), and 9 reproductive/abortion cases (1 caprine and 8 bovine). The relative PPA and NPA were assessed with respect to conventional/reference methods as a group (17) . Also, the overall agreement and Cohen's kappa (the standard agreement coefficient) were assessed by looking across all the pathogens that can be detected by the new assay relative to conventional/reference methods as a group. Relative PPA and NPA calculations were performed for a few individual organisms within the syndromes tested, and those results are also included. antibody test (DFAT). Examination of these 4 cases by a commercial rotavirus quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR (LSI VetMax Triplex; Thermo Fisher Scientific) confirmed the detection of rotavirus in only 1 case, with a C T value of 31 (Table 3 ). In one of the additional enteric cases, rotavirus was not detected by DFAT, while the targeted NGS assay and qRT-PCR were able to detect the rotavirus (C T ϭ 23). In 2 out of 9 reproductive cases, the targeted NGS assay was able to detect Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum, which were missed by DFAT (Table 3 ). In one of the reproductive cases, the targeted NGS assay was not able to detect Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus, which was detected in moderate numbers using a Campylobacterspecific culture technique, but interestingly, this sample also tested negative for the bacterium by quantitative PCR (qPCR) ( Table 3) . Among the 15 respiratory cases included in the comparative study, multiple pathogens were detected in each case by both targeted NGS and bacterial culture ( Table 3 ). The targeted NGS assay was able to detect bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus vaccine strains in two respiratory cases. It was also able to detect respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 2 respiratory cases in which it was missed by DFAT but confirmed by RT-PCR. The targeted NGS assay was not able to detect bovine herpesvirus 4 (BHV-4) in two respiratory cases in which it was detected by DFAT. However, the DFAT results were shown to be false positive, based on negative results obtained for the samples when tested by a herpesvirus consensus PCR (14) . Based on the results of the comparison between NGS and the reference diagnostic tests, the positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) of the designed targeted NGS assay were 86% and 81%, respectively. The overall agreement between the new assay and the routine methods used in this comparison was 85%, with kappa (K) equal to 0.64, i.e., substantial agreement (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42 to 0.85), as shown in Table 4 . Within the mastitis group, the PPA for Staphylococcus uberis was 100% and the NPA was 92%. In the enteritis group, the PPA for Cryptosporidium was 100% and the NPA was 88%. Within the enteric and respiratory syndromes, for cases of E. coli infection, the PPA was 70% and the NPA was 100%, and for C. perfringens, the PPA was 56% and the NPA was 100%. For respiratory cases, the PPA for Mannheimia haemolytica was 78% and the NPA was 67%, and for Pasteurella multocida, the PPA was 71% and the NPA was 63%. The PPA for Histophilus somni was 100% and the NPA was 70%, and the PPA and NPA for Mycoplasma bovis were both 100%.
