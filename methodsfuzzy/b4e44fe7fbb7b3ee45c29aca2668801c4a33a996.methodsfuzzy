The 35th Multicenter Airway Research Collaboration (MARC-35) is a multicenter prospective cohort study of infants younger than 1 year enrolled during an episode of severe bronchiolitis from 2011 to 2014. Severe bronchiolitis was defined by the need for hospitalization. The study was conducted at 17 sites in the United States using a standardized protocol, details of which have been previously published. E1 Children who met the end point of recurrent wheeze before study entry were excluded. We enrolled 1016 children in the study, of which 921 children were followed in the longitudinal cohort. The analytic cohort for the present analysis was defined as the 900 (98%) participants in the longitudinal cohort with complete exposure and outcome data. At the time of enrollment, a parent participated in a detailed in-person interview to capture demographic, parental health, perinatal, and child health information. The subject's parent subsequently underwent structured telephone interview by trained study staff every 6 months. Blood samples were obtained from all participants at enrollment. Serum was analyzed for multiple parameters including total IgE level. Allergen testing was performed by Phadia Immunology Reference Laboratory (Portage, Mich). This analysis was a predetermined secondary analysis. The study was approved by the institutional review board at each participating site and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice Standards. Written informed consent was obtained from the parent or guardian of each study subject.
