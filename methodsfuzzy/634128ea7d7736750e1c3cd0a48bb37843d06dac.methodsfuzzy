Samples and PCR screening. Samples (n ϭ 1,897) were collected from apparently healthy P. giganteus bats throughout Bangladesh between 2006 and 2010, as described previously (48) . This included urine (n ϭ 926), throat swabs (n ϭ 806), feces (n ϭ 78), and roost urine (n ϭ 97). All samples were collected by trained veterinarians, and all animals were released unharmed. Samples were collected directly into lysis buffer (bio-Mérieux, Inc.) and stored at Ϫ80°C until transfer to the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University. Roost urine samples were also obtained by suspending 3-by 2-m polyethylene sheets underneath roosting colonies, which collected urine (with possible fecal contamination) from the bats roosting above. Total nucleic acid was extracted from all samples using the EasyMag (bioMérieux, Inc.) platform, and cDNA synthesis performed using SuperScript III first-strand synthesis supermix (Invitrogen), all according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viral discovery was performed using broadly reactive consensus PCR assays targeting coronaviruses (49) , paramyxoviruses (50) , astroviruses (51), influenza A viruses (38) , adenoviruses (52) , polyomaviruses (53), bocaviruses (54) , and herpesviruses (55) . Consensus primers for hantaviruses were modified from an existing protocol (56) in order to increase the degeneracy of the assay, and the assay validated for its ability to detect diverse hantaviruses, including Andes, Puumala, Sin Nombre, Prospect Hill, Seoul, and Thottapalayam hantaviruses. The modified primer sequences were UHantaF1 (GWGGVCARACWGCHGAYT) and UHantaR1 (CCW GGTGTDADYTCHTCWGC) (expected amplicon, 250 bp), and the annealing temperature was 52°C. All PCR products of the expected size were cloned into Strataclone PCR cloning vector, and 12 white colonies sequenced using standard M13R primers. Trace sequences were analyzed and edited using Geneious (version 6.0.3). Sequences were aligned with ClustalW and MUSCLE, and phylogenetic trees constructed with neighbor-joining (p-distance, pairwise deletion, 1,000 bootstraps), maximum-likelihood (1,000 bootstraps), and Bayesian (Mr Bayes) algorithms. Models of evolution were selected using ModelTest, and a tree representing a consensus of the different methods is presented. Sequence identity (p-distance, pairwise deletion) was calculated in Mega 5. Virus classification. For the purposes of this study, we avoided the use of taxonomic concepts such as species or genotype because of the variable criteria used for such distinctions (9) and because the degree of sequence conservation used to establish such distinctions can vary across the genome and may be affected by the relatively short sequence fragments generated in this study. We focused instead on collections of viral sequences that form distinct monophyletic clades within a particular family, and we considered a virus novel if the sequence identity to its closest relative is less than or equal to the identity between the two closest species for a given viral family. Due to the very large number of herpesvirus sequences identified in this study (n ϭ 650), we used hierarchical clustering to segregate sequences for this particular family. To do this, we first extracted 598 polymerase sequences from published complete genomes (downloaded from NCBI on 14 September 2012) and combined them with the sequences generated in this study (total of 1,248 sequences). Coding sequences were translated and aligned using MUSCLE (version 3.8.31) (57) with the default settings. The nucleotide alignment was constructed by replacing each amino acid with the codon that gave rise to it. Columns containing gaps in more than 1,000 of the 1,248 sequences were removed. The genetic distance between HV species was subsequently established using the published sequences in the alignment only, as de-scribed previously (58) , and a Ͼ7% nucleotide difference (Hamming distance) was used to define HV clusters. PgHV sequences were then segregated using hierarchical clustering, as implemented in the SciPy package (59) using average linkage clustering. Virus richness and sample estimation. We implemented models from the biodiversity literature that utilize incidence distributions to estimate virus richness (number of unique viruses) and, hence, to estimate the number of undetected viruses in the assemblage (60, 61) . Incidence data result where each virus detected in the assemblage is noted in each sample as either present (verified detection) or absent (not detected, which could result due to the virus being absent or being present but not detected by the test, i.e., false absence). From our samples, we first constructed virus accumulation and rarefaction curves for visualization. The asymptote of the rarefaction curve provides the estimate of the number of viruses that characterizes the assemblage. However, sampling to reach this asymptote is impractical, as the number of samples required may be prohibitively large (61) . We thus used statistical methods to estimate the asymptote from the data at hand. We used the nonparametric asymptotic estimator, Chao2 (15, 10) , and also calculated ICE and Jackknife statistics for comparison. Unlike conventional curve-fitting procedures, the nonparametric estimators make no assumptions of an underlying abundance distribution, do not require ad hoc or a priori model fitting, are relatively robust to spatial autocorrelation and scale, and frequently outperform other methods of richness estimation (61) . They rely on the principle that the frequencies of the rarest species in a set of samples can be used to estimate the frequencies of undetected species and provide a minimum richness estimate. All analyses were conducted with the fossil package (62) implemented in R (63). We followed Chao et al. (10) to calculate how many additional samples would be required to detect any proportion (including 100%) of the asymptotic virus richness. All statistics were incorporated into a single plot. Cooccurrence. Patterns of association/disassociation were explored with the Fortran software program PAIRS (11) , utilizing the C score statistic as our measure of species cooccurrence. PAIRS implements a Bayesian approach (Bayes M criterion) to detect nonrandom associations between pairs of species (12) . Assumptions and caveats We considered the detection and discovery of viruses akin to the problem of detection and discovery of biodiversity, as is frequently the goal of ecological studies. The basic mechanism of species detection occurs from drawing samples by collection from some larger assemblage (61) . In this context, our samples are as described above, urine, throat, fecal, or roost urine taken from an individual bat or bat roost, which represent the biomes for our assemblage of interest. These methods require the assemblage of viruses under sampling to be closed for valid inference, that is, that the assemblage size and composition remained stable throughout the course of the study, an assumption we felt was justified. Although each of these sample types targets a unique biome of potential viral habitat from the host species, each with potentially differing efficacy for detecting any given virus, for the purposes of our analyses, we considered each sample a random and equivalent draw from the assemblage of viruses associated with this host species. We also assumed sample independence, even though multiple samples (e.g., urine and throat) were often drawn from the same individual host and sampled bat populations are likely to be geographically nonrandom. The consequence of this sampling strategy is that our analysis is blind to this additional source of geographical variation and occasional pseudoreplication, which means our virus accumulation results are specific to our sampling methodology and our extrapolations assume ongoing sampling with a similar average composition of samples. The results of additional analyses in which we isolated sample types and individuals and considered geographic variation are not presented herein. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The GenBank accession numbers for viruses discovered in this study are KC692400 to KC692452.
