Quantum chemical calculations in this work were carried out using Gaussian 09 W software package [23] . Employing the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr functional (B3LYP) method [24] with 6-311++G(d,p) basis set, the structure of PIDAA was optimized using density functional theory (DFT) . For all of the spectroscopic, molecular docking and physicochemical calculations, such as frontier molecular orbitals, molecular electrostatic potential map (MEP), thermodynamic and nonlinear optical properties in this study the optimized structural parameters were used. The harmonic vibrational frequencies obtained calculations were scaled by 0.96 above 3000 cm −1 and 0.961 below 3000 cm −1 ranges, respectively. Using VEDA 4 program [25] the theoretical vibrational assignments was allotted by means of PEDs. The chemical bonding between the atoms of PIDAA was studied in terms of ELF and LOL [26] . The electronic absorption spectrum was calculated using the timedependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) in DMSO solution. The orbital contribution was analyzed using GaussSum software [27] and the optimized structure was docked using AutoDock Tools (ADT) Version 1.5.6 [28] . Schrödinger Materials Science Suite 2018-1 has been applied as well, for the computational study of title molecule. Particularly, Jaguar [29] [30] [31] , Desmond [32] [33] [34] [35] and Maestro [36] programs preparation and visualization of results of the studied molecule. Same as in the case of Gaussian 09 W, a B3LYP exchange-correlation functional [37] has been used, together with 6-311++G(d,p) basis set for calculations of molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) and average local ionization energy (ALIE) surfaces. For calculations of bond dissociation energies for hydrogen abstraction (H-BDE), a 6-311G(d,p) basis set was used. MD simulations have been performed by using the OPLS3 force field [32, [38] [39] [40] . Simulation time was set to 10 ns, temperature to 300 K, the pressure to 1.0325 bar and cut-off radius to 12 Å. The modeling of MD systems was performed by placing the one molecule of PIDAA to the simulation box with around 3000 water molecules. The system was considered as isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble, while the simple point charge (SPC) model [35] was used for the treatment of solvent. Maestro program was used for calculations of drug likeness parameters. Drug likeness parameters have been calculated for PIDAA, in order to evaluate its pharmaceutical potential. Frequently used drug likeness parameters in this study encompassed: number of rotatable bonds, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors (HBD and HBA, respectively), AlogP, polar surface area (PSA) and molar refractivity.
