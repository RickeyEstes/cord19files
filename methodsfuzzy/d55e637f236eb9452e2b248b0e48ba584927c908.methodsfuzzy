The publication of the X-ray structure of SARS M Pro cyteine proteinase in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Database (access code 1WOF) [19, 32] permitted that our studies were initiated. Three different models were constructed using the atomic coordinate from 1WOF, which they were systematically increased. In the first model, only the ligand (N1) was fully optimized with tight self-consistent field (scf) routine implemented in Gaussian 03 software [33] . Becke's three-parameter hybrid functional [34] , along with the nonlocal correlation functional of Lee, Yang and Parr (B3LYP-DFT) [35, 36] with 3-21G, 6-31G, 6-31G(d), 6-31G(d,p) and 6-31+G(d,p) basis set [37] and semiempirical Parametric Method 3 with MM correction for peptide bond (PM3MM) [38] methods were used in this study. Afterward, two models with two-layer hybrid were created by ONIOM approach [39, 40] . The first one, B3LYP/basis set and PM3MM were defined as higher and lower layer respectively. Similarly, the second ONIOM model was constructed using PM3MM and the universal force field (UFF) [41] as higher and lower respectively. The higher layer was defined by the double bond and ester group present in trans-a,bunsaturated system, and whole ligand was defined as lower layer (Fig. 1A) . The main goal is observe the effect in Mulliken net atomic charges and geometry in our ONIOM models. In this step, a validation between classical QM and ONIOM was performed. For this purpose, the tight keyword was used to ensure adequate convergence. Of course, the computational cost was increased. The orbital of N1, N3 and AG7088 ( Fig. 1) were carried out using PM3MM and B3LYP/6-31G(d) as well. Afterward the validation result, another model was designed to study the additions reaction between N1 and the active site of SARS-CoV. The model was constructed through cartesian coordi- nates of N1 and the active site (including oxyanion pocket) obtained from protomer A of 1WOF, which was previously prepared by AMBER8 [42] . Different models were constructed with ONIOM in two and three-layers. However, only a small model with N1, His41, Cys145, Gly143, and three water molecules using B3LYP/6-31G(d,p):PM3MM approach was successfully minimized. In other words, this model considered the trans-a,b-unsaturated moiety, catalytic system, and oxyanion hole in higher layer with 32 atoms, and others parts of ligand, amino acids, and two water molecules in lower layer with 133 atoms. As the amino acids were dissected from protomer A, hydrogen atoms were added to occupy the free valence. The cartesian coordinate of a-carbons and hydrogens added were keep fix during the geometry optimization. Neutral charge was assumed for the whole model, but thiolateimidazolium ion pair was considered in started geometry (Fig. 2 ). The first model of this set was called Reagent, the second of Inter1, which the C 1 -S distance was fixed by 2.720 Ã… , and the last one was called by Hprod, which consists of an alkylated model. These structures described the nucleophilic attack from thiolate to transa,b-unsaturated moiety of N1. Mulliken net atomic charges, geometrical parameters and relative energies were evaluated in detail for this Michael reaction. A third model was created, which consists in the whole protein. This model was constructed to demonstrate the influence of longrange electrostatic interactions in Michael adduct reactions, including all atoms of protein. Initially, the geometry of protomer A was obtained from PDB, as describe previously. This structure was prepared following the recommendation by AMBER software, and the three waters molecules were added using the coordinates of PDB file. The S-C 1 bond was broken, and a geometry optimization was carried out by classical force field UFF using Gaussian (default routines). After, ONIOM approaches was carried to build a model with two-layer (PM3MM:UFF and B3LYP/6-31G(d,p):UFF). The ligand, water molecules, His41, Gly143 and Cys145 were definite in higher layer and the others atoms were definite in lower layer, similar to previous model, but Cb and respective hydrogens of His41 were included in QM part. The same ONIOM model was used to study the complexation between N3 and M Pro as well. A validation of stereochemical quality of optimized structures was performed by Ramachandran plot [43] using PROCKECK software [44] . All calculations were performed using the Redwood machine present in Mississippi Center for Supercomputing Research-MCSR.
