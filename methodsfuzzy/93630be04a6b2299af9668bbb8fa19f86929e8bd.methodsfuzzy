Between February 1 and July 31, 2003, all pregnant women in Hong Kong whose disease met the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition of May 1, 2003 , of SARS were included. 5 These patients were jointly managed by the infectious disease specialists, intensive care physicians, respiratory physicians, obstetricians, and midwives. The (medical) clinical course and demographic data were abstracted from the records. Pregnancies in the first trimester were identified by pregnancy tests offered to all female SARS patients suspected to be pregnant. Ultrasound examination was performed as soon after admission as practical. All pregnant women at more than 24 weeks of gestation, once classified as probable cases of SARS, were transferred to Princess Margaret Hospital, which is a designated hospital for infection control in Hong Kong, for further management. Medical treatment was offered to the patients while maternal and fetal conditions were closely monitored. Indications for early delivery included maternal deterioration, failure to maintain adequate oxygenation or difficulty with mechanical ventilation because of the gravid uterus, fetal compromise or other obstetric indications. Daily cardiotocography (CTG) was performed for pregnancies after 28 weeks of gestation. Fetal growth was assessed by serial ultrasound scans every 2 weeks. Liquor volume measurement and umbilical Doppler artery blood flow studies were performed on a weekly basis. The obstetric and neonatal outcomes were collected. Major medical complications were identified. Evidence of perinatal transmission of virus was assessed by the SARS-associated coronavirus reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (SARS-CoV RT-PCR) and viral culture on cord blood, placenta tissue, and amniotic fluid at or after delivery as appropriate. Maternal blood was removed before the cord blood was collected with a sterile syringe. A 1-cm cubic of fresh placenta tissue was removed after it had been thoroughly rinsed with sterile saline solution and dissected from the chorionic plate. The remaining placenta tissue was sent for histopathology and/or electron microscopy, particularly searching for viral inclusion bodies or particles. The newborn infants were followed-up with SARS-CoV antibody titers for evidence of SARS infection.
