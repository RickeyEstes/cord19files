Evaluations of PR methods need to be performed early in product and process development. Models for in vitro testing of viruses, bacteria, and parasites also need to develop in a timely fashion. Ideally, at least a 6-10 log 10 reduction in pathogen load is suggested to be an acceptable level of efficacy for the methodology. Peak viral load in the window period, however can be as high as 10 8 -10 14 units per milliliter. These high viral loads might prevent reduction of pathogen load to a level that does not transmit infection. 2 Phase III trials demonstrating clinical efficiency can be clinically difficult. Many factors decrease phase III trial assessment feasibility: First, too large a study population might be necessary to see a statistical or clinical difference. Since the initiation of NAT assays, even larger cohorts are required to find additional benefits of PR above those achieved with testing alone because the risks of contamination with the current methods of testing are so small. Second, PR techniques are not applied to all blood products (i.e. cryoprecipitate) given to patients. Third, and epidemiologically, multiple transmission routes/vectors are present by which patients acquire infections making it difficult to prove the infection came from blood; therefore, reliance on phase IV or surveillance of use is required to evaluate for subtle risks and marginal benefits. 2 Elimination of compounds that clearly damage labile blood components is necessary when evaluating PR procedures. Gross hemolysis (O1%), platelet dysfunction, and a O 30% reduction in coagulation factor activity are problems to be avoided. Subtle damage is more difficult to assess. Radiolabeling cells for autologous transfusions and monitoring survival or recovery can be used to evaluate clinical efficacy. Clinically, bleeding time is inadequate to assess platelet function, and delivery of oxygen to tissues is inadequate to assess red cell function after treatments with this technique. 2 The FDA currently favors a clinical assessment of bleeding using the WHO criteria. The challenge of PR technologies is to continue or increase benefit as threat levels decrease. As techniques in donor selection, collection processes, screening test methodologies, and detection limits are improved, additional benefit from the use of PR techniques decreases. The risks to the recipients decrease as pathogen reduction increases, with development of less toxic and more efficient techniques. More benefit is apparent when new transfusion-transmissible pathogens emerge (SARS, Ebola virus). As PR technologies are developed, however, the likelihood of replacing pathogenscreening tests is not expected nor anticipated. Rather, such technologies should complement existing protocols. 2 Numerous methods have been cultivated and are in various stages of development and use. Solvent detergent pathogen reduction of plasma is the most widely studied methodology and is currently in use across Europe. Other methods include photosensitizing chemicals that interact with pathogen DNA and/or RNA and crosslink following exposure to UVA or visible light, thus inactivating the nucleic acids. Alkylating agents and ethyleneimines are PR technologies that also cross-link nucleic acids but do not require light for activation. 19 An interesting side benefit of these technologies is that white cells are also inactivated, thus potentially eliminating the risk of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). This chapter will discuss the more recent developments and address those technologies either in use or likely to be used in the near future.
