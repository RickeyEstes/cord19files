Microarray data. The gene expression data set GSE10474, generated by Howrylak et al (9) were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/geo/). These data were obtained from whole blood of 34 patients, including 13 with ALI and sepsis (6 males and 7 females; mean age, 54.2 years) and 21 patients with sepsis alone (10 males and 11 females; mean age, 60.1 years) within 48 h of admission. All patients were recruited from the Medical Intensive Care Unit of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) between February 2005 and June 2007. Data processing and normalization. Raw array data were preprocessed using the R Bioconductor package 'affy' (version 1.30.0; Affymetrix; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) as previously described (10) using the following three steps: Background-adjustment, quantile normalization and log 2 transformation. Multiple probe sets were mapped to a single transcript and the mean expression value of all probe sets was then calculated. Differential expression analysis. The differential expression of genes between patients with ALI and sepsis, and those with sepsis alone, were detected using the limma package (version 3.14.0) (11) from R/Bioconductor. If the difference in expression between genes in the two groups of patients was P<0.05, they were classed as DEGs. Principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is a procedure used to emphasize principal components (uncorrelated variables) in a multivariate dataset. Raw data with k-dimension subspace were mapped to n dimensions space (k<n) using SIMCA version P10.0 (Umetrics; Satorius Stedim, Umea, Sweden) for DEGs. Functional enrichment analysis. Clue gene ontology (GO) (http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cluego) (12) and CluePedia (http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cluepedia) (13) are two plug-in portions of Cytoscape (14) , Clue GO was used for GO term and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs. CluePedia was used to explore the functional network. Terms with P<0.05 and a κ score of 0.4 were regarded as significantly enriched terms. Differential co-expression analysis. Co-expression networks (CEN) are typically constructed based on co-expression between gene pairs. Modules obtained from gene differential co-expression analysis were assessed using GO biological process (BP) using the Biological Networks Gene Ontology tool (psb.ugent.be/cbd/papers/BiNGO/; version 2.3) (15). P<0.05 was defined as the threshold for a differentially expressed gene. The differential co-expression network (DCEN) was constructed with the absolute value of correlation coefficient ≥0.9. Correlation analysis between genes was measured using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Gene and drug interaction analysis. The drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb; dgidb.org) is a web resource that integrates disparate data sources to help researchers to search for drug-gene interactions (16) . The present study analyzed drugs targeted by genes using this database with default parameter values.
