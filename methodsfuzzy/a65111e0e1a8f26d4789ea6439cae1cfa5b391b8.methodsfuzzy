The genome sequence information of 17 strains of ZIKV (including "Brazil ZKIV-2015" which was recently implicated in causing microcephaly in Brazilian fetuses; Calvet et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016) , and many other viruses were retrieved from the NCBI/GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) ( Table 1) and screened for the presence of RARE consensus sequence (5 ′ -AGGTCA-3 ′ ). Among the viruses other than ZIKV, selection was made under four groups viz: (1) Members of the flaviviridae family other than ZIKV (to check if RARE consensus sequence repeats were essentially present in the family) (2) Viruses showing maternal-fetal/perinatal transmission and causing congenital brain malformations (3) Viruses showing neurotropism but not known to cause fetal brain defects (4) Viruses chosen randomly from the RNA/DNA viruses not fitting in any of the above three groups (to account for the selection bias and to establish coherence and validity of the screening process). To identify the enrichment of RARE sequence (5 ′ -AGGTCA-3 ′ ) repeats present in the viruses, a Perl script was written and executed. In order to find and count the RARE sequences from the ZIKA virus genome, a PERL script was generated entitled "RARE_Seq_finder.pl." The PERL script was based on the window shift algorithm. Genome sequence information of ZIKA virus isolates was downloaded from various genome databases. As input, the PERL Script requires only the list file carrying names of the genome sequence files. It searches the RARE sequences globally in the genome, and lists all genome file names along with number of RARE sequences present in the genome. A complete flow-chart with all the steps involved in the counting the RARE sequences is shown in Figure 2 . The complete PERL script for this study is available as Supplementary Material.
