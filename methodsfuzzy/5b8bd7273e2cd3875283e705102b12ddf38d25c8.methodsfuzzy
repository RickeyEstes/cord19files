Using data collected by Clinidata as part of the Ontario Telehealth program since December 2001, the effectiveness of Telehealth as a real-time surveillance system will be investigated. As no research has been done in this area in Canada, and international research to date is very limited, the development of this translational tool is innovative and will add significantly to the limited state of knowledge on syndromic surveillance. This project will have both a retrospective and a prospective component. In the first stage, our research will be retrospective in nature. Using data collected retrospectively by Clinidata, we will link all "reasons for call" ("chief complaint") and assigned algorithms to one of the following syndromes: gastrointestinal, constitutional, respiratory, rash, hemorrhagic, botulinic, neurological, and other (Table 1) . These syndromes are identical to those currently used by the Ontario Syndromic Surveillance Pilot Project (also known as QUESST). This will be done in conjunction with QUESST, using their recent expertise in the mapping of health algorithms and chief complaint to these syndromes. Following this step, analyses will be carried out to determine normal thresholds for the different syndromes. There are many different methods documented in the literature, including, but not limited to, cumulative sums [36, 37] , control charts [38] , recursive least squares [39, 40] , and upper confidence limits, the latter which are the preferred method for NHS Direct research [18] . Using knowledge of past outbreak activity such as SARS and Norwalk-type outbreaks, the validity and reliability of the data, as well as, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values of these different methods will be evaluated in order to ascertain which statistical method best applies to these data. Once thresholds have been established and evaluated, the prospective monitoring of syndromic activity will take place. This will be done both temporally and spatially. The decision to pursue both types of analyses is due to Ontario's large geographic size, combined with the uneven distribution of population. Temporal trends, usually measured through one-dimensional scan statistics [36, 41, 42] are of interest to monitor general patterns of symptoms. This is of particular interest for unusual events where a few cases would result in a likely alert (e.g. anthrax). Spatial clustering analysis, using spatial scan statistics, have been adapted for infectious disease surveillance [36, 43, 44] . This statistical method will be used to ascertain unusual activity in specific geographic areas. For example, this will allow for the monitoring of underserviced areas such as northern Ontario where infectious disease surveillance is limited and where, coincidentally, use of Telehealth is proportionally high. This statistical method relies on a geographic region's expected counts rather than on its population distribution. It is critical that new and emerging surveillance systems implement process evaluation targets within its logic model to monitor its effectiveness and progress. In order to meet this need, we plan on implementing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention "Framework for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems for Early Detection of Outbreaks," [45] . As part of the routine evaluation of this surveillance system, it is our intention to compare syndromic surveillance activity monitored by the Telehealth Project (both retrospectively and prospectively) with emergency department syndromic surveillance activity. At present, the Ontario Emergency Department Syndromic Surveillance System only monitors hospitals located in Kingston, Ontario. Consequently, this portion of our evaluation is only planned for Telehealth calls made in the Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox and Addington catchment area. As other hospitals are added to the ED Syndromic Surveillance Project, they will be included in the comparative evaluation of Ontario Telehealth and Emergency Department Syndromic Surveillance. The last step of the evaluation of Telehealth as an early warning system will be an economic analysis that will attempt to ascertain whether Telehealth provides medical and non-medical cost savings, both in terms of monitoring, and public health surge capacity planning.
