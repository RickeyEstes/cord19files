Animal tissue samples. Animals tested in this study are listed in Table 1 . Tissues collected at necropsy were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin and were then trimmed and blocked for paraffin embedding. Chicken eggs were harvested at 10 days postfertilization for embryonic tissue and chorioallantoic membranes (CAM). The mice were of the C57BL/6 strain, and tissues were either frozen Expression and isolation of HE-Fc viral SGRPs. The sequences for expressing the ectodomains of the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) of three nidoviruses (MHV-S, PToV-P4, and BCoV-Mebus) (14, 86) were synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ), with various degrees of insect codon optimization. To generate probe molecules, esterase domains were inactivated by changing the active site Ser residue to Ala by Q5 site-directed mutagenesis (New England Biolabs). The HE proteins were linked to the baculovirus gp64 signal sequence peptide at their N termini, and the C terminus was fused to a linker containing a thrombin cleavage sequence, the Fc domain of human IgG1, and a 6-His sequence. Constructs were cloned into pFastBac-1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were then used to generate recombinant bacmids in DH10Bac following the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant baculoviruses were recovered by transfection of the bacmids into Sf-9 insect cells using Cellfectin II (Life Technologies, Inc.). Viruses were then used to infect a suspension of High Five cells and supernatants harvested 2 to 3 days postinfection. Proteins were purified from the infected cell culture supernatants by binding to a HiTrap protein G HP column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) and eluted with 0.1 M citrate (pH 3.0; pH neutralization to pH 7.8 with 1 M Tris, pH 9.0) using an Äkta fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The HE-Fc-containing fractions were dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and concentrated using 30-kDa Amicon Ultra-15 filters (EMD Millipore). Purified protein was observed by SDS gel migration as well as anti-human IgG Fc probing by Western blotting. Migration was retarded by the presence of glycosylation and confirmed by the use of various glycosidases (EndoH, PNGase, and O-glycosidase; New England Biolabs). Protein concentrations were determined from A 280 readings, and proteins were stored at Ϫ80°C in aliquots or at Ϫ20°C in 50% (vol/vol) glycerol. Solid-phase SGRP binding assay. ELISA-grade 96-well plates were coated with Sia-containing samples diluted in PBS (pH 6.5; 100 l/well) for 16 h at 4°C. Wells were washed between steps with washing buffer (PBS [pH 6.5], 0.05% Tween 20). Wells were blocked in CarboFree (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h at 37°C. HE-Fc SGRPs were precomplexed (10:1 molar ratio) with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated goat anti-human Fc ␥-specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and were applied to wells in 2-fold serial dilutions (starting at 50 g/l HE-Fc) in blocking buffer (50 l/well). Bound HE-Fc was detected with ABTS [2,2=-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid)] substrate (Sigma). Optical densities were read at 405 nm. Samples depleted of specific O-Ac Sias were prepared by exposure to the respective active esterase HE-Fc forms at 20 g/l during blocking. Glycan microarray binding studies. Glycan microarrays were fabricated using epoxide-derivatized slides as previously described (87) . Printed glycan microarray slides were blocked by ethanolamine, washed, and dried. Slides were then fitted in a multiwell microarray hybridization cassette (AHC4X8S; ArrayIt, Sunnyvale, CA) to divide them into 8 subarrays. The subarrays were blocked with ovalbumin (1% [wt/vol])-PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature (RT), with gentle shaking. Subsequently, the blocking solution was removed and diluted protein samples with various concentrations were added to each subarray. After incubation of the samples for 2 h at RT with gentle shaking, the slides were washed. Diluted Cy3 AffiniPure goat anti-human IgG (HϩL) antibody (purchased from Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories)-PBS was added to the subarrays, incubated for 1 h at RT, washed, and dried. The microarray slides were scanned by the use of a Genepix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Data analysis was performed using Genepix Pro 7.0 analysis software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Cell culture and staining of cultured cells. All mammalian cells were grown at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . The cells tested included human HEK293T, human A549, canine MDCK, and equine NBL-6 cells. The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Insect cells (Sf-9 and High Five) were grown in Grace's insect media supplemented with 10% FBS at 23°C. Cells were probed for O-acetyl Sias by the use of virolectin probes and visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked with CarboFree (Vector Laboratories). Esterase-active treatment controls were performed by addition of active HE-Fc (at 20 g/ml) during blocking at 37°C. Cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100. Cells were probed with HE-Fc SGRPs (at 20 g/ml) in complex with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-human Fc ␥-specific antibody (10:1 molar ratio) for 45 min at RT. Colocalization to the secretory cis-Golgi network was determined by utilization of an anti-GM130 antibody (Sigma). Coverslips were mounted and visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon E3000 microscope. Histochemical staining of tissues. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections on coated slides were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated. Frozen sections of mouse tissues were placed directly on slides and then fixed with 10% buffered formalin. All subsequent washes were done with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Sections were first blocked in CarboFree (10% normal goat serum for SGRP probing) for 1 h at 37°C. Esterase treatment control slides were exposed to active esterase HE-Fc forms (20 g/l) during serum blocking. Sections were further blocked with avidin/biotin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and quenched of active peroxidase activity by the use of Bloxall (Vector Laboratories). Sections were probed with HE-Fc SGRPs (at 20 g/ml) in complex with biotinylated goat anti-human Fc ␥-specific antibody (10:1 molar ratio) overnight at 4°C. Sections were probed with biotinylated plant lectins SNA (Vector Laboratories) and MAH (MAA-II, Vector Laboratories) at 10 g/ml and 20 g/ml, respectively, for 3 h at
