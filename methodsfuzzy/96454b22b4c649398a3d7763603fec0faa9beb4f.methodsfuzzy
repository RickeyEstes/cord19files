Cells and virus. The Purdue-116 and Miller strains of TGEV were obtained from E. Bohl, Ohio State University. Purdue-116 virus was plaque-purified from infectious genomic RNA, grown on swine testicle (ST) cells in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals), and used within eight passages of plaque purification (Brian et al., 1980; Kapke and Brian, 1986) . Miller virus was similarly grown but was plaque-purified twice from infectious virus on ST cells and used within 10 passages of plaque purification. Northern analysis of TGEV mRNAs. Northern analyses were performed as described (Sethna et al., 1989) and quantitation was done with the AMBIS Photoanalytic Imaging System (AMBIS, San Diego, CA). Cells were infected with TGEV at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 and total RNA was extracted at 6 and 9 h postinfection (hpi). Blots were probed with radiolabeled synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide specific for the leader (oligonucleotide L3ϩ, 5ЈCGGGATCCTCGGGTTTAGTTCGAGTTGGTG-TCCGAAGACAAAATCTAGCACAAGGCTAGTTAAAGT-AAAAGAAGAGATAT3Ј), gene 3a (oligonucleotide 7.7, 5ЈGTTCGTCAAGTACAGCATCTACGG3Ј), or gene 3b (oligonucleotide 4, 5ЈCTTCTCATAAACGGTGCAGCTCT-GCC3Ј). Probes were radiolabeled to a specific activity of 1.5 to 3.5 ϫ 10 6 cpm/pmol by the forward reaction. Construction of plasmids. TGEV Purdue sequences used in this study have been published (Kapke, et al., 1988a; Sethna et al., 1991) . The construction of pORF3b-4 ( Fig. 1C) , formerly called pORF2, has been described (O'Connor and Brian, 1999) . pORF3b-4 carries genes 3b and 4 and 308 nt of gene 5 in vector pGEM-4Z (Promega Biotech) (a sequence obtained from cDNA clone pFT44 [ Fig. 1A] ). pORF4 (Fig. 1C) was made from pORF3b-4 by first removing the 291-nt M-containing SphI fragment, religating, and then removing the 716-nt HindIII-BbsI fragment and religating after blunt-ending with mung bean nuclease. pORF3a-3b-4 (Fig. 1C) , which carries genes 3a, 3b, and 4 downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter in pGEM-3Z (Promega Biotech), was made in three steps. First, pSP6ORF3a, from which gene 3a and 591 nt of gene 3b can be transcribed with RNA polymerase SP6, was created by ligating the 1111 bp NsiI-PstI fragment from clone pFT39 (a clone containing nucleotides 3968 to 5449 from the genome 3Ј end [ Fig. 1A ; Tung et al., 1992] , prepared as described in Kapke et al., 1988a,b) into the PstI site of pGEM-3Z. Second, pSP6ORF3a-3b-4 was created by ligating the 925-bp BsrGI-EcoRI fragment from pORF3b-4 into the 4048-nt vector-containing EcoRI-BsrGI-linearized fragment of pSP6ORF3a. Third, the entire 1340-nt SphI-HinfI insert from pSP6ORF3a-3b-4, after blunt-ending with T4 DNA polymerase, was ligated in the reverse orientation into similarly blunt-ended EcoRI-SacI-linearized pGEM-3Z. To place the viral leader upstream of ORF 3a, pLORF3a-3b-4 ( Fig. 1C ) was constructed by a previously published procedure (Sethna et al., 1991; Hofmann et al., 1993) . Briefly, cDNA was made from the 5Ј end of mRNA 3 with a primer specific to gene 3b (oligo 4(ϩ) [5ЈCTTCT-CATAAACGGTGCAGCTCTGCC3Ј]), and amplified by PCR using oligo 4(ϩ) and oligo leaderGAC(Ϫ) (5ЈGCGGGC-CCGGGACTTTTAAAGTAAAG3, which binds to the minus-strand of the leader), to create a leader-containing fragment. The product was digested with SmaI and BsrGI, and the large fragment was ligated in a three-way ligation reaction with the 590-nt BsrGI-SphI fragment of pORF3a-3b, and with pGEM-4Z that had been linearized with HindIII, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and digested with SphI. To create a strong Kozak context for the 3a start codon, thus creating pORF3a(K)-3b-4, an overlap PCR mutagenesis procedure (Horton et al., 1990) was used. For this, complementary mutagenesis primers 7.7Kozak(ϩ) (5ЈCAA-TGTCAATGGTGGCCCTGTAATGAC3Ј) and 7.7Kozak(Ϫ) (5ЈGTCATTACAGGGCCACCATGGACATTG3Ј), and primers oligo 5(ϩ) (5ЈTGCCACCATACAATGTGACA3Ј, which binds to bases 465-484 within ORF 3b) and pGEM3Zf(Ϫ)NdeI(Ϫ) (5ЈGAGAGTGCACCATATGCGGTGT3Ј, which binds to bases 2498-2519 within pGEM-3Z), were used together in the overlap procedure to amplify a 1066-nt product from pORF3a-3b-4 DNA. After digestion with restriction enzymes NarI and BsrGI, the 932-nt product was cloned into NarI-BsrGI-linearized pORF3a-3b-4. To create pCATORF3a-3b-4 (Fig. 1C) , the ORF3a-3b-4containing 1534-nt SphI fragment from pORF3a-3b-4 was placed into the SphI site of pCAT (Fig. 1C) , which was made by cloning the BamHI fragment from pCM4 (Pharmacia) into the BamHI site of pGEM-3Z. For better size resolution of the large proteins, the CAT gene in pCATORF3a-3b-4 was truncated by 91 nt on its 3Ј end by digestions with NcoI and nuclease Bal 31, thus forming psCATORF3a-3b-4 (Fig. 1C) . This, along with a frameshift, resulted in a total shortening of the CAT protein (now called sCAT) by 46 aa. The junctions of all constructs were confirmed by sequencing plasmid DNA. Preparation of nested deletions within gene 3a, the postulated internal ribosomal entry region. To obtain deletions within gene 3a, psCATORF3a-3b-4 DNA was linearized at base 7 of ORF 3a with Tth111 I, treated with Bal 31 and mung bean nucleases, purified by electrophoresis, and religated. Transformants were screened for deletions by PCR and the sequenced constructs were named for the number of bases deleted downstream of the gene 3a start site (the total number of deleted bases is also noted). In vitro translation and analysis of products. In vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase was carried out on linearized plasmid DNAs as recommended (Promega Biotech). pORF3b-4 was linearized with EcoRI, pORF3a-3b-4 with ScaI or BamHI, as indicated, and psCATORF3a-3b-4 with AseI. The 1274-nt DNA fragment from ScaIlinearized pORF3a-3b-4 was purified by affinity chromatography (Geneclean; Bio 101) to ensure transcription of only ORF 3a. For preparation of capped RNA transcripts, 0.5 mM m7G(5Ј)ppp(5Ј)G and 0.25 mM GTP replaced 2.5 mM GTP in the transcription mix (Promega Biotech). Each preparation of RNA was purified by Biospin column chromatography (Bio-Rad), quantitated by spectrophotometry, and monitored for degradation by agarose gel electrophoresis. In vitro translation was carried out in methionine-depleted wheat germ extracts or rabbit reticulocyte lysates as recommended by the manufacturers (Promega Biotech and Ambion, Inc.). In some preparations, translation products were treated with RNase A before electrophoresis as recommended by Ambion, Inc., to remove a 27-kDa endogenous band caused by the binding of charged tRNA to proteins. Fifty-microliter reaction volumes contained 50 Ci 35 S-methionine (1000 Ci/mmol; ICN) and 1.0 g of RNA transcript. To test for inhibition of translation by exogenous methylated cap analog, m7G(5Ј)ppp(5Ј)G (New England Biolabs) was added to the translation mix to final concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mM. Radioactivity in the separated products was quantitated by scanning dried gels with the AMBIS Photoanalytic Imaging System (San Diego, CA) or by scanning autoradiograms of the gels with the Bio-Rad Imaging Spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). Each experiment depicted was done minimally on three separate preparations of transcript RNA. Standard deviation measurements were made from the results of three separate experiments.
