The following method was used to obtain secondary data from existing peer-reviewed journal articles and reports of government agencies and related health organisations: (1) systematic search of the published literature, using defined keywords; (1) studies that highlighted the UAE in the abstract but subsequently pooled data to produce estimates for the Gulf Region or the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states (i.e. Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and UAE); (2) articles that were not available in English; and (3) duplicate publications or sub-studies of included articles. The systematic literature search yielded a total of 185 citations and 179 abstracts. Table 1 summarises the findings from the literature retrieval.
