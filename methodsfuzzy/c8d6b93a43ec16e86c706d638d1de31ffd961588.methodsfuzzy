A population-based case-control study was conducted in the entire Danish population (approximately 5.6 million inhabitants). 22 The Danish National Health Service provides universal, tax-supported healthcare. The Danish National Registry of Patients (DNRP) holds information on all non-psychiatric hospital admissions since 1977 and hospital clinic outpatient visits since 1995. Each hospital contact is accompanied by up to 20 discharge diagnoses coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) since 1994. Accurate linkage of all databases is possible by means of a unique 10-digit personal number assigned to each Danish citizen and included in all medical and public registries. selection of population controls The Danish Civil Registry System was used to randomly select 10 population control subjects for each case on the date of first ON diagnosis (index date for controls). All control subjects were matched by age, sex, ethnicity (native vs immigrants) and residency (same county). To be eligible for this study, subjects in the control group were not allowed to have a hospitalisation with an ON diagnosis before the admission date for the corresponding ON case.
