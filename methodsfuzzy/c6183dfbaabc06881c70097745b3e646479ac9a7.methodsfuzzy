In this update we focused on reviewing publications since the HSA that were concerned directly with the potential health impacts of climate variability and change in the United States, along with publications that provided information on implemented adaptation measures. We generally focused on publications that specifically addressed the health outcomes of interest in the United States to limit sources of uncertainty that would need to be accounted for in drawing conclusions (e.g., relevance of results from Europe to the United States). Exceptions were made if no comparable U.S. study was identified for a health outcome of interest. We identified relevant reports and publications from electronic reference databases using combinations of key words developed from the health outcome categories, limited by date. The following databases were searched: Medline (www.nlm.nih.gov), Biosis (www.biosis.org), Social Sciences Index (scientific.thomson.com/products/ssci), Enviroline (library.diolog.com/bluesheets/ html/b10040.html), and Meteorological and Geoastrophysical Abstracts (www2.lib.udel. edu/database/mga.html). We filtered the results of individual searches using a series of Boolean pairings to identify, for example, heat mortality studies published since 1998. The search terms and pairing strategies used to identify the initial pool of literature are summarized in Table 1 . The initial searches, in most cases, returned hundreds of publications for each health outcome area, even after searches were refined to eliminate categories that were clearly outside the project scope. For example, thousands of publications were initially identified using the key words "temperature" and "food-borne illnesses," but most of these publications focused on risks and strategies for safe food preparation instead of the potential impacts of climate variability and change. Publications that we ultimately reviewed were identified through multiple levels of screening. In the first screening, potential references were reviewed based on the title, listed key words, and whether the publication was in English. From this screening, we obtained the abstracts for potentially relevant publications and screened them to identify publications that appeared to provide information on the impacts of climate variability and change on one or more of the health outcomes categories of interest, or the implementation of adaptation measures. If the abstract suggested that a publication might provide useful information, or the title or key words supported such a conclusion when an abstract was not available, the publication was obtained and reviewed. A note on definitions used: "climate" is the average state of the atmosphere and the underlying land or water in a particular region over a particular time scale. "Climate variability" is the variation around the mean climate and includes seasonal variations and irregular events such as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. "Climate change" operates over decades or longer and occurs as a result of both internal variability within the climate systems and external factors (both natural and anthropogenic). "Adaptation" encompasses the strategies, policies, and measures undertaken now and in the future to reduce potential adverse health effects. "Adaptive capacity" refers to the general ability of institutions, systems, and individuals to adjust to potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, and to cope with the consequences. The primary goal of building adaptive capacity is to reduce future vulnerability to climate variability and change. Current health status and trends in the United States. The HSA (Patz et al. 2000) noted a number of population subgroups that are likely to be more vulnerable to the adverse impacts of a changing climate, including the very young (i.e., < 1 year of age), older adults (i.e., those ≥ 65 years of age), and immunocompromised individuals. These groups are often at the greatest risk for climatesensitive health outcomes because they are more sensitive to vector-, food-, and water-borne diseases, have limited capacity to acclimatize to thermal extremes, and have reduced ability to undertake appropriate behavioral changes when exposed to thermal extremes and extreme weather events. Therefore, we reviewed U.S. population projections and public health sector trends to evaluate the potential future changes in the vulnerability of susceptible groups to the health impacts of climate change. Table 2 summarizes U.S. population estimates for various age groups from 2000 to 2100 (U.S. Census Bureau 2002) . Most notable is the anticipated increase in the size and proportion of the total population accounted for by older adults. By 2100, projections suggest that there will be approximately 100 million more citizens ≥ 65 years of age than in 2000. The combined share of the population that will be composed of the very young and older adults is projected to increase from about 15% to > 25%. The anticipated increase in these age groups suggests, all else equal, that the U.S. population will become increasingly vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change. Poverty, which was identified as a risk factor but not defined in the HSA, is generally determined at the family level by comparing estimates of income with thresholds that vary according to family size and composition. Poverty increases vulnerability to climate-sensitive health outcomes directly by reducing the capacity to adapt to changing conditions and is often positively correlated with increasing susceptibility to climate-sensitive health outcomes. Because the conditions associated with being poor may change over time, the future risk associated with being poor also may change. For example, if the future incomes of the poorest Americans rise sufficiently such that air conditioning becomes a standard feature in their homes, this group could have increased resilience to heat events. As a result, the degree of risk associated with being poor Hurricanes or tornadoes or floods or heat waves or precipitation or rainfall or snowfall Set 4 Human health or public health or morbidity or mortality or (sensitive or vulnerable) populations or hospitalizations or diseases or vulnerability Set 5 Mental health or psychological or emotional or posttraumatic stress Set 6 Publication year = 1999:2004 Set 7 (Set 1 or set 2 or set 3) and (set 4 or set 5) and set 6 Set 8 (Food-borne or water-borne or insect-or rodent-or mosquito-borne) diseases Set 9 Dengue or malaria or encephalitis or West Nile or plague or Giardia or hantavirus or leptospirosis or cryptosporidiosis Set 10 Set 1 and set 4 and (set 8 or set 9) and set 6 Set 11 Water pollution or water quality or toxic algae or marine diseases Set 12 Set 1 and set 4 and set 11 and set 6 Adaptation options for addressing health effects, effectiveness of implemented health adaptations Set 1 Adaptation or preparedness or emergency planning or management or mitigation or prediction Set 2 (Climate or global) and (change or variability) Set 3 Weather or (extreme or severe) events Set 4 Hurricanes or tornadoes or floods or heat waves or precipitation or rainfall or snowfall Set 5 Public health or human health Set 6 Publication year = 1999:2004 Set 7 Set 1 and (set 2 or set 3 or set 4) and set 5 and set 6 will reflect not only a changing climate but also changes in the number of people living in poverty and their associated standard of living, both of which are uncertain. Another group the HSA identified as being more vulnerable to climate-sensitive health outcomes is individuals who are immunocompromised. This group includes persons with weakened immunity as a result of chronic diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS, certain cancers) or drug treatment (e.g., transplant patients). The roughly 344,000 people living with HIV/AIDS as of December 2001 provides a lower bound estimate of the current immunocompromised U.S. population (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2001). Projecting future trends in the immunocompromised population is difficult because of the need to account for the cumulative impacts of changes in population, behavior, and medical technology. For example, future medical advances could increase or decrease the size of this population; it would decrease if cures are found for diseases such as HIV/AIDS and would increase if treatments keep more individuals alive for longer. There has been no substantial change in overall mortality trends since the HSA. Heart disease, malignant neoplasms, cerebrovascular diseases, and chronic lower respiratory disease continue to be the top four causes of death, accounting for between 63 and 66% of all deaths over the period 1998-2002 (National Center for Health Statistics 2004). However, these trends may change with the growing obesity epidemic. In 1991, the highest prevalence of obesity on a statewide level was 15-19%; only four states reported a prevalence rate in this range, and no state reported a rate of ≥ 20% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2004). By 2002, 18 states reported obesity rates of 15-19%, 29 states reported rates from 20-24%, and 3 states had rates > 25%. Although this trend is not related to changes in climate, it is noteworthy because the obese may be at increased risk of some climate-sensitive health outcomes (e.g., temperature-attributable morbidity and mortality). The ability of the U.S. health care system to respond to an increase in the burden of climatesensitive outcomes will play a critical role in determining the net health impact of climate change. In this regard, there have been at least two significant developments since the release of the U.S. National Assessment. First, the recognition of the critical role played by the public health system in protecting the nation's health has increased, which has led to a significant increase in the commitment of resources to the public health sector, particularly public health surveillance and training (Staiti et al. 2003) . This shift is the product of many factors, including the terrorist attacks of September 11, the anthrax attacks in 2001, the fear of bioterrorist attacks (Staiti et al. 2003) , and the continued spread of introduced illnesses such as West Nile virus. In addition, the 2003 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak highlighted how quickly diseases can spread from one region to another, the importance of improving public health systems in many developing countries, and the importance of timely and comprehensive public health surveillance systems (Levine et al. 2003) . The second development is that Medicare coverage is now being offered for prescription medications. Given Medicare's focus on the elderly, this change may improve the health status of the elderly and increase the financial resources available to this segment of the population, improving their adaptive capacity. To the extent that public health programs and preventive medicine receive additional funding, there is the potential that the general health status of the U.S. population could improve, which would, in general, reduce vulnerability to climate change.
