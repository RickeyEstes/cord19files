Viruses can be manipulated to alter their virulence, either deliberately or inadvertently. Classically, this was accomplished by growing a virus in either animals or cell culture (Table 2) . With the advent of molecular genetics, it has become possible to introduce mutations that change virulence. These studies are most informative when the phenotypes differ as much as possible.
