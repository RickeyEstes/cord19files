Both persistently and transiently infected bulls excrete BVD virus in their semen [28, 29] . BVD virus transmission via embryo transfer has been documented, but precautions can be taken to avoid such spread [30] . Transmission between small ruminants and cattle, both ways, has been demonstrated [31] [32] [33] [34] . Surveys from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have recorded individual animal prevalence to Border disease (ovine pestivirus) of 5.3% and 5.6%, respectively [35, 36] . Flock-level prevalences of 30.4% and 46%, respectively, were reported in the same studies. Natural transmission of pestivirus from cattle to sheep and vice versa has been documented. However, the pressure of infection is likely to be from cattle to sheep due to the higher herd prevalence of BVD (> 85%), as compared to 30% flock prevalence of pestivirus [35] . Further it was found that the BVD virus was the predominant pestivirus affecting sheep in Northern Ireland [35] . BVDV is the most common contaminant of bovine foetal serum due to the capacity of the virus to spread transplacentally and subsequently establish a persistent infection in the immunologically immature foetus [19] .
