Our analysis rests on secondary data concerning the number of confirmed cases and deaths of MERS in the Republic of Korea. 10 Confirmed diagnosis was made based on laboratory diagnosis by detecting viral nucleic acid or serological test, regardless of the presence of clinical signs and symptoms. For the estimation of the CFR in real time, we employed an integral equation model, the mathematical details of which were described elsewhere. 14, 15 To adjust the right censoring, the time of illness onset to death was assumed to follow a gamma distribution, f s , with the median of 11 days, and the coefficient of variation was assumed at 50.0%. 16 Maximum likelihood estimate of the CFR was obtained by adjusting the time delay from illness onset to death, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed by using the profile likelihood. To test the difference between the estimate in the Republic of Korea against published two estimates, i.e., p ref =0.20 and 0.40, a two-sided binomial test was employed. The level of statistical significance was set to be a=0.05.
