FHMNV infection and disease can be diagnosed tentatively by behavioral changes and characteristic gross signs. Development of cytopathic effects in EPC and other fish cell lines that include syncytia formation can also assist diagnosis of FHMNV and WBV, with detection of rod-shaped virions by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) providing additional diagnostic confidence. Opportunities exist to develop specific and sensitive diagnostic reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests because complete genome sequences are available for FHMNV (Batts et al., 2012) and WBV (Schütze et al., 2006) . For FHMNV, PCR tests have been described that amplify either a relatively conserved region in the ORF1b gene helicase motif or an ORF2 gene sequence (Batts et al., 2012) . Sequence analysis of the ORF2 gene region amplified by PCR has provided a means of differentiating FHMNV strains isolated in cell culture from FHMs being reared in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois as well as present in jack pike (Esox masquinongy) fed live FHMs in Nebraska and a batch of creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) (Batts et al., 2012; McCann, 2012) . A constant-temperature RT loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) test with a sensitivity of ~5 RNA copies has also been developed for FHMNV diagnosis and surveillance (Zhang et al., 2014) . While no molecular tests have been reported specifically for WBV diagnosis, immunoblotting using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum to a fusion protein to the pp1a main proteinase (Mpro) motif expressed in bacteria has been used to detect predicted Mpro cleavage products of pp1a and pp1ab in WBVinfected fish cells (Ulferts et al., 2011) . Opportunities thus exist to employ this or other WBV protein-specific antibodies in diagnostic immunotests. To diagnose YHV infection unequivocally, various molecular methods have been developed to detect either viral proteins or viral RNA. Methods to detect YHV proteins have employed polyclonal antiserum prepared to purified whole virus (Lu et al., 1996; Munro and Owens, 2007a) , monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) generated to purified whole virus and selected for specificity to the gp116 and gp64 envelope glycoproteins or the p20 nucleoprotein (Sithigorngul et al., 2000 Munro and Owens, 2007a; Sittidilokratna et al., 2006) , monospecific antiserum prepared to a p20 peptide sequence or to a p20-fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli (Cowley et al., 2004a) and a recombinant single-chain variable fragment antibody to gp116 expressed in E. coli and constructed by PCR from a hybridoma clone generated to purified YHV particles (Intorasoot et al., 2007) . The range of antibody-based methods described for detecting YHV or GAV proteins includes dot-blot nitrocellulose enzyme immunoassays (DB-NC-EIA) (Intorasoot et al., 2007; Lu et al., 1996; Loh et al., 1998; Nadala and Loh, 2000; Sithigorngul et al., 2000) and Western blots (Cowley et al., 2004a; Intorasoot et al., 2007; Nadala et al., 1997a; Sithigorngul et al., 2000; Soowannayan et al., 2003; OIE, 2014) , a solid-phase noncompetitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Intorasoot et al., 2007) , as well as a sandwich ELISA employing polyclonal chicken antibodies raised against GAV proteins for protein capture and a p20 nucleoprotein-specified MAb for GAV protein detection Owens, 2006, 2007a) , immunohistochemistry (IHC) for detecting infected cells and tissues in histological sections (Sithigorngul et al., 2000; Soowannayan et al., 2003) and immunoelectron microscopy for detecting viral nucleocapsids and virions in ultrathin tissue sections or protein components of purified and negatively stained virions (Cowley et al., 2004a; Soowannayan et al., 2003) . Of these methods, the DB-NC-EIA protocol, using gill tissue homogenates, provides a rapid and simple potential method to diagnose YHV infection (Nadala and Loh, 2000) . However, an even more simple-to-implement lateral-flow immunochromatographic test strip (ICTS) method has been developed for the pond-side diagnosis that employs either shrimp hemolymph or gill/appendage tissue extracts as a protein source, a polyclonal rabbit antiserum prepared to a recombinant YHV p20 protein to capture this viral protein and a p20-specific MAb (Y19) conjugated to colloidal gold as a detector antibody (Sithigorngul et al., 2007; Chaivisuthangkura et al., 2014 ). An ICTS method to co-detect YHV and WSSV in the same strip has also been described (Sithigorngul et al., 2011, Fig. 32.8) . Antibody-based diagnostic methods can offer advantages in speed, simplicity and cost in detecting GAV/YHV compared with molecular methods to detect viral RNA such as PCR (Munro and Owens, 2006; Sithigorngul et al., 2007) . However, their analytical sensitivity is generally lower. For example, the lateral-flow ICTS developed to detect YHV is approximately 500-fold less sensitive in detecting YHV p20 protein compared with a one-step PCR test designed to detect YHV RNA (Wongteerasupaya et al., 1997; Sithigorngul et al., 2007) . YHV detection sensitivity was reduced further in an ICTS designed to co-detect YHV and WSSV (Sithigorngul et al., 2011) . Antibody specificity also needs to be considered. For example, while polyclonal antiserum to recombinant GAV p20 protein cross-detects the YHV p20 protein (Cowley et al., 2004a) and MAbs to the YHV p20 nucleoprotein (Y19) and gp64 glycoprotein (Y18) cross-detect the cognate GAV proteins, MAb V-3-2B specific to the YHV gp116 glycoprotein does not detect gp116 of GAV (Sithigorngul et al., 2000 (Sithigorngul et al., , 2007 Soowannayan et al., 2003) . Despite these limitations, protein-based virus detection methods provide practical and relatively cheap diagnostic options for managing YHV infection and disease risks at shrimp hatcheries and farms. Molecular methods designed to detect YHV RNA generally provide the highest analytical sensitivity. ISH using digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled DNA or RNA probes is useful, like the IHC method, in associating YHV with specific tissue types and histopathology and thus in diagnosing infection as well as assessing disease severity (Spann et al., 2003; Tang and Lightner, 1999; Tang et al., 2002; OIE, 2014) . However, due to its complexity, ISH has been used primarily as a research tool to investigate YHV infection processes and disease progression. Numerous PCR tests have been reported for either YHV and GAV diagnosis or research (Cowley et al., 2000b (Cowley et al., , 2004b Wongteerasupaya et al., 1997; Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008b Wijegoonawardane et al., , 2010 Dhar et al., 2002; Mouillesseaux et al., 2003; de la Vega et al., 2004; Tang and Lightner, 1999; Aranguren et al., 2012; de la Rosa-Vélez et al., 2006) . Of these, the one-step RT-PCR first reported for YHV (Wongteerasupaya et al., 1997) , a two-step multiplexed nPCR utilizing PCR primers to amplify both YHV and GAV and multiplexed virus-specific nPCR primers to amplify and differentiate YHV from GAV based on amplicon size (Cowley et al., 2004b ) and a two-step multiplexed PCR test utilizing combined degenerate primers designed to have broad specificity for YHV genotypes 1-6 and to assist in detecting other genotypic variants that might exist (Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008b) are endorsed for infection/disease diagnosis in the Yellowhead Disease chapter of the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals 2014 (OIE, 2014) . Each of these tests targets regions in the okavirus ORF1b gene, and are likely to now require revision or caveats to their applicability as new YHV genotypes are discovered such as YHV7 (Mohr et al., 2015) and YHV 8 (Liu et al., 2014) because they were designed to sequences of YHV genotypes known at the time. The inclusion of a nPCR step can improve YHV/GAV RNA detection efficiency up to 100-fold or more compared with one-step PCR (Cowley et al., 2000b (Cowley et al., , 2004b . Various real-time RT-PCR tests that provide viral RNA detection sensitivities further improved compared with nPCR as well as improved throughput capacity and linear dynamic range over which viral RNA loads and thus infection severity can be quantified accurately, have been described for detecting YHV, GAV or YHV genotypes 1-6 that utilize either SYBR-Green chemistry (Dhar et al., 2002; Mouillesseaux et al., 2003) or a TaqMan probe to generate fluorescence (de la Vega et al., 2004; Aranguren et al., 2012; Panichareon et al., 2011; Wijegoonawardane et al., 2010) . The detection limits of these real-time PCR tests can approach a single RNA copy. A modified version of the nPCR designed to differentiate YHV from GAV (Cowley et al., 2004b) is also available commercially (IQ2000 YHV/GAV PCR test) together with commercial real-time SYBR-Green PCR and RT-LAMP tests for YHV (GeneReach Biotechnology Corp.) . In addition to the PCR designed to detect YHV and/or GAV (Cowley et al., 2004b) , a test employing multiplexed PCR primer sets to detect any of six different shrimp viruses and a TaqMan real-time PCR employing multiplexed PCR primers and probes labeled with different fluorophores to co-detect and quantify YHV and Taura syndrome virus (TSV) have been described (Khawsak et al., 2008; Aranguren et al., 2012) . As an alternative to gel electrophoresis to detect and confirm the expected size of PCR amplicons, hybridization to biotin-labeled virus-specific oligonucleotides followed by avidin capture and detection using anti-DIG-peroxidase has been used for ELISA-based visualization of DNA amplified in the presence of DIG-dUTP (Khawsak et al., 2008) . Hemolymph spotted onto specialized filter papers such as IsoCode (Schleicher and Schuell Inc.) has proved useful for field collection and preservation of YHV RNA for subsequent RT-PCR analysis (Kiatpathomchai et al., 2004) . The method avoids the complexities of tissue dissection and collection into liquidbased preservatives, and/or the need to refrigerate or freeze tissues, and can maintain RNA integrity in samples stored for periods of up to 9 months at ambient temperature (Kiatpathomchai et al., 2004) . Hemolymph stored as a liquid at either 4°C of 25°C for up to 5 days has also been found show little sensitivity drop-off in real-time PCR detection of YHV RNA (Ma et al., 2008) . While RNA detection by PCR methods can provide exquisite sensitivity, most tests employ primers designed to genome sequences determined for a single strain/genotype and with no regard for them targeting gene regions constrained by their requirement to encode more highly conserved functional domains within YHV proteins. Based on these shortcomings in combination with YHCVs existing as a complex of genotypes that appear to have evolved in geographically isolated populations of P. monodon Soowannayan et al., 2003; Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008a) , extreme care is needed in interpreting data generated by any one particular PCR test. For example, the original RT-PCR test described to detect YHV (Wongteerasupaya et al., 1997) has retained good specificity for the YHV1 genotype due to the 3′-terminus of 10R PCR primer serendipitously targeting a sequence that has diverged in other identified genotypes (Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008b) . However, other tests, including the RT-nPCR designed to differentiate YHV1 from GAV (Cowley et al., 2004b) and the TaqMan real-time PCR to detect GAV (de la Vega et al., 2004) , have been identified to cross-detect other genotypes at variable efficiency depending on their sequence relatedness to GAV in the genome regions targeted by the PCR primers (Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008b; J.A. Cowley et al., unpublished) . To detect YHV genotypes 1-6 as well as other genotypes that might exist, consensus RT-nPCR and TaqMan real-time RT-PCR tests have been described that use degenerate PCR primers designed to accommodate genotype sequence variations identified in an ORF1b gene region (Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008a (Wijegoonawardane et al., ,b, 2010 . Phylogenetic analyses of sequences amplified from this and another ORF1b gene region have proved useful in assigning YHV genotypes and in identifying new genotypes such as YHV7 found recently in P. monodon originating from the previously unstudied Joseph Bonaparte Gulf region of northern Australia (Mohr et al., 2015) . While phylogenetic comparisons of ORF1b gene sequences have proved useful in classifying YHV genotypes, PCR tests designed to amplify sequences within the ORF2/ORF3 genes encoding the virus structural proteins have proved useful in identifying YHV1 subtypes YHV1a and YHV1b Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008a) as well as viruses representing recombinants Gangnonngiw et al., 2009) . Based on the high frequency at which recombinants comprising various permutations of the 5′-ORF1a/1b and the ORF2-3 3′-genome regions of parental YHV genotype 2, 3 and 5 viruses have been detected in P. monodon collected from various countries in southeast Asia , genotype assignments based on ORF1a/1b gene sequences alone need to be viewed with caution, particularly in regions where hatcheries are densely colocated and/or commonly source wild broodstock from diverse locations. In cases when a YHV genotype needs to be defined definitively, it is recommended that regions in both the ORF1a/1b and ORF2/ORF3 genes be amplified, sequenced and compared, as was done to identify the nature of a YHV genotype when first detected in shrimp farmed in Mexico (de la Rosa-Vélez et al., 2006) . As an alternative to PCR, RT-LAMP methods have been described to detect YHV (Mekata et al., 2006 (Mekata et al., , 2009 Jaroenram et al., 2012; Khunthong et al., 2013) . A standard RT-LAMP test employing agarose gel electrophoresis to detect the amplified DNA ladder was found to be about 10-fold less sensitive than a commercial IQ2000 YHV/GAV nPCR test (Mekata et al., 2006) . In contrast, a real-time RT-LAMP test employing a photometer to quantify turbidity increases in the magnesium pyrophosphate by-product of DNA amplification was found to be about 10-fold more sensitive than the same commercial nPCR test (Mekata et al., 2009) . To avoid the need for either gel analysis or a photometer to detect amplified DNA, a RT-LAMP method modified to amplify biotin-labeled DNA ladder products has also been developed to detect YHV (Khunthong et al., 2013) . By hybridizing amplified DNA products to a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled DNA oligonucleotide, a simple lateral-flow dip (LFD) stick system was employed to trap and visualize the DNA duplexes as a dark-colored band (Khunthong et al., 2013) . A similarly simple tube-based colorimetric method has been described that utilizes gold nanoparticles (AuNP) to bind and detect YHV DNA ladder products amplified by RT-LAMP (Jaroenram et al., 2012) . These rapid, specific and highly sensitive methods that only require a constant temperature apparatus and simple LFD stick or tube-based colorimetric detection systems, such as LAMP, offer substantial potential for field diagnosis of YHV. However, due to the complexity of primers required for LAMP, the specificity they provide is likely to limit the applicability of any test to a single genotype.
