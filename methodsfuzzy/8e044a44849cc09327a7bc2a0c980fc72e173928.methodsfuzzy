Recombinant SARS-CoV spike proteins. Plasmid encoding S protein S1 domain (residues 12-672) tagged with C9 at the C-terminus (designated as S1-C9) and plasmid encoding a 193-amino acid fragment of RBD (residues 318-510) linked to the Fc domain of human IgG1 (designated as RBD-Fc) were kindly provided by Dr. M. Farzan at the Harvard Medical School [15, 21] . RBD-Fc and S1-C9 proteins were expressed in 293T cells transfected with the plasmids using Fugene 6 reagents (Boehringer-Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturerÕs protocol. Supernatants were harvested 72 h post-transfection. S1-C9 was purified by affinity chromatography with anti-C9 mAb 1D4 (National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN), and RBD-Fc was purified by protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). A full-length S protein expressed in expresSF + insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus D3252 was purchased from the Protein Sciences (Bridgeport, CT). Preparation of inactivated SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV strain BJ01 (GenBank Accession No. AY278488) was propagated in Vero E6 cells as described previously [24, 26] . The infected cells were harvested and completely lysed by three cycles of freeze-thaw. b-Propiolactone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was then added to the lysates at 1:2000 ratio and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The inactivated virus was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. After removal of cell debris, the supernatants were desalted with Sephadex G-50, concentrated with PEG-8000, and filtered with Sepharose-CL 2B, sequentially. The inactivated SARS-CoV in the final preparation, with >95% purity as analyzed by HPLC, was confirmed by observing the coronavirus-like particles under an electron microscope and by determining the reactivity with convalescent sera from SARS patients in Western blots. Immunizations of mice and rabbits. Four Balb/C mice and four NZW rabbits were primarily immunized intradermally with 10 and 30 lg of purified viral particles inactivated by b-propiolactone, respectively, as immunogen in the presence of FreundÕs complete adjuvant (FCA), and boosted twice with the same amount freshly prepared emulsion of immunogen and FreundÕs incomplete adjuvant (FIA) at 2-week intervals. Pre-immune sera (preimmune) were collected before starting immunization and antisera were collected 5 days after the second boost. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mouse and rabbit sera were tested against the recombinant S proteins (S protein, S1-C9 or RBD-Fc) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, 1 lg/ ml of each recombinant protein was coated to 96-well microtiter plates (Corning Costar, Acton, MA) in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4°C overnight. After blocking with 2% non-fat milk, serially diluted mouse or rabbit sera were added and incubated at 37°C for 1 h, followed by three washes with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Bound antibodies were detected with HRP-conjugated goat antimouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed, South San Francisco, CA) at 37°C for 1 h, followed by washes. The reaction was visualized by addition of the substrate 3,3 0 ,5,5 0 -tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured by an ELISA plate reader (Tecan US, Research Triangle Park, NC). Mouse and rabbit sera reactivities with SARS-CoV were tested by ELISA with commercially available diagnostic kits using the mixture of proteins purified from viral lysates as coating antigens (Beijing Genomics Institute, Beijing, China). Receptor-binding assay. Inhibitory effects of the mouse or rabbit antisera on RBD-Fc binding to receptor ACE2 were tested using an ELISA-based assay. Briefly, recombinant soluble ACE2 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) was coated at 2 lg/ml to 96-well ELISA plates (Corning Costar) in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4°C overnight. After blocking with 2% non-fat milk, 0.5 lg/ml of RBD-Fc was added to the wells in the presence or absence of serially diluted mouse or rabbit sera. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, the HRPconjugated goat anti-human IgG (Zymed) and the substrate TMB were used for detection. Single-cycle SARS pseudovirus infection assay. SARS pseudovirus bearing SARS-CoV S protein and a defective HIV-1 genome expressing luciferase as reporter was prepared as previously described [21, 27, 28] . In brief, 293T cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding codon-optimized SARS-CoV S protein and a plasmid encoding Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) using Fugene 6 reagents (Boehringer-Mannheim). Supernatants containing SARS pseudovirus were harvested 48 h posttransfection and used for single-cycle infection. Briefly, ACE2transfected 293T (293T/ACE2) cells were plated at 10 4 cells/well in 96-well tissue-culture plates and grown overnight. The supernatants containing pseudovirus were preincubated with 2-fold serially diluted mouse or rabbit sera at 37°C for 1 h before addition to cells. The culture was re-fed with fresh medium 24 h later and incubated for an additional 48 h. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed using lysis reagent included in a luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Aliquots of cell lysates were transferred to 96-well Costar flat-bottomed luminometer plates (Corning Costar, Corning, NY), followed by addition of luciferase substrate (Promega). Relative light units (RLU) were determined immediately in the Ultra 384 luminometer (Tecan US).
