We used a sampler (Bio-culture sampler, Buck bio-culture, Model B30120, A.P. Buck, Inc., Orlando, Florida, US) for capturing fungal and bacterial bioaerosols. This sampler is an impactor type sampler with a flow rate of 100 l/min. The air containing fungal and bacterial particles was accelerated through 400 nozzles of the sampler and the potential fungal and bacterial particles were deposited onto the agar plate of the sampler. The potential fungal particles were deposited onto the agar which contained MEA (maltose 12.75%, dextrin 2.75%, glycerol 2.35% peptone 0.75% and agar 15%). The deposited fungal particles and normal particles were incubated at 25 1C for 48 h. The potential bacterial particles were deposited onto the agar which contained nutrient agar (beef extract 3%, peptone 5%, and agar 15%). The deposited bacterial particles and normal particles were incubated at 37 1C for 24 h. We enumerated the number of colonies and calculated the concentration of culturable fungal and bacterial bioaerosols in the air environment with the unit of CFU/m 3 . Figure 1 shows the locations where measurements were conducted. The measurement campaigns were conducted at Konkuk University which was located in the west side of Seoul, Republic of Korea. The measurement area around Konkuk University was a highly crowded area in Seoul (hundreds of thousands of pedestrians every day). We measured the number of concentrations of total culturable fungal and bacterial bioaerosols in three outdoor air environmentsin a forest, by a lake, and near a buildingand one indoor environment. One indoor measuring location was inside a six-story building that was not air-conditioned. We sampled bioaerosols at 40 cm above the ground surface with at least three replications. We measured the outdoor fungal and bacterial bioaerosol concentrations for the summer season in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Especially, we measured the concentrations from July 1, 2013 to July 26, 2013, which was in the middle of the monsoon season of Korean peninsula. We chose this season because we wanted to compare fungal and bacterial bioaerosol concentrations on rainy days with the concentration on days without rain. We sampled bioaerosols during lunch time (around 12:30) when many people usually go outside for taking a walk.
