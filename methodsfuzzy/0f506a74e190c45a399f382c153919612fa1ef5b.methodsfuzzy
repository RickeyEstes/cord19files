Enrichment of DCs from Mouse Spleen-Mouse spleens and LN were digested with 400 U/mL Collagenase D (Millipore Sigma) and 50 μg/mL DNase I (Millipore Sigma) for 30 minutes at 37°C. 10 mM EDTA (Corning) was added for the last 5 minutes of culture. For splenocytes, red blood cells were then lysed with ACK Lysis buffer (Lonza). Both spleen and LN cell suspension were filtered through a 70 mm strainer. For CyTOF analysis, cell suspensions were stained directly or enriched using a Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA, Millipore Sigma) gradient. In brief, splenocytes were re-suspended in 3 mL of 30% BSA, and 1 mL of PBS was overlaid, then centrifuged at 1055 g for 30 minutes. For cell sorting of all DC subsets, whole spleen cell suspensions were incubated with anti-CD3 (KT3) and anti-CD19 (1D6) followed by negative selection with anti-rat Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were sorted using a FACSAria II or FACSAria Fusion (BD Biosciences) at the Stanford Shared FACS Facility. All DC populations were first gated on live cells, singlets, lineage negative (CD3 − CD19 − CD20 − TCRβ − ), and CD11c + . cDC1s were sorted as CD11c high Xcr1 + . cDC2s were sorted as Xcr1 − CD11c high CD11b + . For functional assays, the sorting strategy for pDCs and tDCs avoided the use of antibodies with potential inhibitory capacity. pDCs were sorted asXcr1 − CD11b − Cx3cr1 − B220 + Ly6C + . tDCs were sorted as Xcr1 − CD11b − Cx3cr1 + and separated based on CD11c low Ly6C high and CD11c high Ly6C low . For RNA and DNA extraction, SiglecH was included in the sorting strategy. Lung, Skin, and Bone Marrow Preparation-Perfused lungs were digested with 0.13 U/mL Liberase TM (Millipore Sigma) and 50 μg/mL DNase I for 25 minutes at 37°C and filtered using a 70 μm strainer. Skin from both ears was split in dorsal and ventral halves and incubated dermis down with 1.3 U/mL Liberase TL (Millipore Sigma) and 50 μg/mL DNase I for 45 minutes. Ears were minced with scissors, incubated for additional 45 minutes and filtered through 70 μm strainer. For bone marrow analysis, femurs and tibias were obtained and flushed using RPMI. The epiphysis was minced with scissors and washed thoroughly with RPMI. Cell suspensions were filtered through a 70 μm strainer.
