For the determination of analytical sensitivity of the real-time PRA assay by the molecular DNA standard, a semi-log regression was calculated using Prism software 5.0 (Graphpad Software Inc., SanDiego, CA). For exact determination, a probit regression was performed using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The evaluation of exo RPA with clinical samples data is presented as R 2 value.
