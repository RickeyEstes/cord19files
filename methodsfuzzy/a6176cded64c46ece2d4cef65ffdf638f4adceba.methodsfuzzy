Tissue culture, animal inoculation, and other virological methods were all applied unsuccessfully in early attempts to identify HBV (Blumberg, 1977) . Blumberg et al. (1965) performed a systematic study of the sera collected from leukemia and hemophilia patients who had experienced frequent blood transfusions in order to detect precipitating iso-antibodies against unknown antigens found in donor serum. The ' Australia antigen' was identified in the serum of an Australian Aborigine as being a target of precipitating antibodies generated in the serum of transfusion patients (Blumberg et al., 1965) . It was found to be rare in normal Americans, but was common in normal people from Africa, Asia, and Oceania. These data led some to hypothesize a relationship between leukemia, the unknown agent, and genetic polymorphism(s) in Australia. Subsequently, the Australian antigen was revealed to be an antigen shared by multiple hepatitis patients (Blumberg et al., 1967; Prince, 1968) . Virus-like particles containing ' Australian antigen' on their surface were eventually found by electronic microscopy in the blood of three patients with 'serum hepatitis' (Dane et al., 1970; Jokelainen et al., 1970) . These findings were the first indication that the disease now known as hepatitis B is caused by a virus (HBV). The discovery of HCV was an extraordinary achievement, because isolation of the viral genome did not rely on previously visualized viral particles, growth of the virus in vitro, or development of an immunological assay. Patients who had transfusion-associated hepatitis were described, despite being negative for hepatitis A and B antigens, which suggested the existence of another, unidentified infectious agent (Feinstone et al., 1975) . Although several immunologic and serologic assays were developed, none was a specific, reliable serologic marker for this unknown hepatitis antigen. However, administration of the putative infectious reagent induced non-A, non-B hepatitis in chimpanzees, which confirmed that an infectious agent was likely responsible for the disease (Tabor et al., 1978) . A decade after the development of the chimpanzee disease model, Alter and Houghton (2000) , utilizing novel methodologies in molecular biology, conducted a blind immunoscreen using a recombinant phage expression library. In searching for an unknown virus in these non-A, non-B hepatitis patients, a randomly primed cDNA library was constructed from the plasma of chimpanzees that had been injected with serum from non-A, non-B hepatitis patients. cDNA was inserted into the bacteriophage Î»gt11 and expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed proteins were then screened against serum from an infected non-A, non-B hepatitis patient. Among millions of the clones screened, one clone encoded an antigen that showed specific seroreactivity in non-A, non-B hepatitis patients. The putative virus was shown to contain a positive-strand RNA molecule of about 10,000 nucleotides that belongs to the Flaviviridae family (Choo et al., 1989) . Novel virus discovery by screening recombinant expression libraries from infected tissues against patient sera represented a significant breakthrough. However, library screenings are also laborious, as hundreds of millions of bacterial cDNA clones had to be screened (Alter and Houghton, 2000) .
