In this open-label, randomized phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (1:1) patients aged 18 years and older with HAP and HCAP to receive cefoperazone/sulbactam or cefepime. The primary endpoint was to compare the clinical response to cefoperazone/sulbactam with cefepime at the test of cure (TOC) visit evaluated within 7-21 days after last dose. Secondary endpoints were overall survival and objective response in all patients assessed by intention-to-treat (ITT). During the study period, all subjects who received at least one dose of study drugs were included in the safety population and monitored for safety issues. Results: From Sep. 22, 2009 to Aug 06, 2012, a total of 174 subjects in 12 hospitals were screened, A total of 147 subjects were included in the evaluable population. The clinical response rate at TOC visit was 81.8% (54/66) in the cefoperazone/sulbactam group, while it was 79.0% (64/81) in the cefepime group. In the ITT population, the clinical response rates were 82.1% (55/67) in the cefoperazone/sulbactam group, and 79.0% (64/81) in the cefepime group. Non-inferiority of cefoperazone/sulbactam to cefepime was demonstrated in both populations with a noninferiority margin at 20% ( p-value <0.001). Thirty-five adverse events were judged as related to study medications. No statistically significant difference regarding adverse events was observed between the two groups. Conclusion: This study indicated that the combination of cefoperazone/sulbactam was not inferior to cefepime when used to treat patients with HAP/HCAP. All the reported serious adverse events were not related to study drugs, and the incidences of adverse drug reactions were low. Therefore, cefoperazone/sulbactam (2g/2g every 12 hours) was tolerable and effective to treat patients with HAP/HCAP. The patient was a 41-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis, Child C. She presented a painful, anterior chest wall swelling for one month. The patient denied any cardiac surgery, trauma or acupuncture history. She began with a fever, and had progressive dyspnea 2 days prior. The patient was sent to the emergency room of another hospital, and had a debridement of the chest wall abscess than admitted to the intensive care unit. Pus and blood cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, and cefoperazone/sulbactam was administered. Liver abscess was considered as a possible source, but not confirmed. She was then transferred to our hospital. Results: On physical examination, there was a 7 cm long, 4 cm wide, and 3 cm deep open, clean surgical wound with some cauterized granulation tissue. White blood count was 11,400/uL. Wound culture grew oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA), and sputum culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefoperazone/ sulbactam was switched to pipercillin/tazobactam and tigecycline. The patient had a second debridement on hospital day 14. Whole body inflammation scan and chest computed tomography ( Figure. ) showed sternal osteomyelitis, mediastinitis and pericarditis. Tigecycline was switched to daptomycin for coverage of ORSA. She had sternectomy on day 47, and wound culture grew K. pneumoniae. Pipercillin/tazobactam was switched to cefmetazole. However, the infection wasn't well controlled. She had an altered consciousness and died on hospital day 90. Conclusion: Due to rare clinical experiences, we have no standard approach for PSO. However, the presentation of PSO is insidious, and a diagnosis can often be delayed. PSO should be borne in mind when a patient presents with an anterior wall abscess. We conducted a single-arm, multicenter (5 institutions), prospective study in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential administration of L-AmB after micafungin (MF) as an empirical antifungal therapy for antibiotics-refractory febrile neutropenia in patients with hematologic malignancies who received cytotoxic chemotherapy. Results: A total of 18 adult patients were enrolled, and 12 patients who fulfilled the protocol defined criteria were evaluated. Underlying diseases consisted of acute leukemia (n = 10), malignant lymphoma (n = 1), and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1). Prior antifungal prophylaxis was given in 9 patients. Treatment success was achieved in 8 patients (66.7%). None of the patients showed pulmonary lesions in the radiological imaging or developed breakthrough infections. Serum galactomannan antigen increased in one patient, and plasma (1-3)-β-D glucan test was positive in 2 patients, but these tests improved in any of these cases. Treatment failure was observed in 4 patients. Among them, 3 patients discontinued the study drug due to adverse events. These events were drug-related toxicities such as hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, hypokalemia, skin eruption, and muscle stiffness, but all of them were below grade 2 toxicity, and were reversible after finishing the drug. One patient revealed a persistent fever probably due to cytomegalovirus infection, which subsided by ganciclovir administration. Conclusion: Although the number of patients studied was limited, sequential therapy with MF and L-AmB seems to be an encouraging antifungal treatment strategy for those with hematologic malignancies who experience antibiotics-refractory neutropenia after cytotoxic chemotherapy. Further investigation in large-scale studies are needed. A 73 year-old male farmer referred for altered consciousness, sepsis related multi-organ failure, GI bleeding and pneumonia. He was admitted to intensive care unit once arrived at the Emergency Department. Blood culture showed S. sanguis bacteremia but the patient did not respond to empirical antibiotics with Tapimycin and his multi-organ failure got worse. On examination, the patient still had fevers, low blood pressure (100/ 60 mm Hg) with tachycardia (120/min), and presented more symptoms such as yellowish skin color, diffused petechiae of body surface, and oliguria (0.7 mL/kg/day). Troponin I was 2.42 ug/ L, but ECG revealed no ST elevation, consistent with NSTEMI. Echocardiogram did not reveal vegetations. Gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed bleeding gastric ulcer. Laboratory studies revealed platelet count of 9,000/uL, elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen, which could not explain DIC as the cause of bleeding diathesis. He also had liver dysfunction, jaundice, high blood level of ammonia (130 umol/L), A/G reverse and acute kidney injury with hyperkalemia (5.5 mmol/L). Abdomen sonography revealed ascites, splenomegaly and cirrhosis of the liver. Picture above showed multiple petechiea found on gastric wall during panedoscope on 6/29. Methods: Female BALB/c mice (7 weeks old) were infected with approximately 1 × 10 9 CFU of MRSA strain MW2, intraperitoneally. Subsequently, mAbs, vancomycin hydrochloride (VCM) and daptomycin (DAP) were injected intraperitoneally (alone or in combinations). The animals were monitored and their mortality recorded. Statistical analysis was done using the log-rank test to determine differences between treatment groups. Results: There is a significant difference ( p < 0.05) in treatment groups (single and combination therapies) with the most effective lifesaving activities exhibited by the 3H + DAP combination at 65%. A 75 year-old female has been past histories of type II diabetes mellitus poor controlled and recent HbA1c revealed 9.9%. She was complained of left lower quadrant pain, sleepy and septic shock was also noted. The abdomen computed tomography revealed right perirenal abscess, that pigtail drainage catheter was inserted. The blood culture and pig tail drainage abscess culture showed KP, emperical antibiotic of flomoxef use. However, she started to have redness of left eye within 24 hr then she had sudden pain, eyelid swelling and conjunctival chemosis was found and endogenous KP endophthalmitis was suspected. A orbital computed tomography revealed left orbital intraconal/extraconal space and left periorbital abscess and postseptal cellulitis, consistent with left endophthalmitis. Results: Thus, the ophthalmology was given intravitreal injection of antibiotic of ceftazidime 2 mg/0.1 cc and eye drops use. Visual acuity in the left eye deteriorated to no light perception over a 48-hour period, the intraocular pressure was 47-49 mmHg. We adjusted antibiotic to meropenem and prescuded mannitol to reduced intraocular pressure. The left eye received intravitreal injection one dose, mannitol intravenous injection three dose and meropenem for two weeks therapy. Although, the left eye no bacteria could be cultured and blindness, but stable hemodynamic status and transferred to ordinary ward. Conclusion: Acute endophthalmitis is a medical emergency. Endophthalmitis is a clinical diagnosis that is confirmed by positive aqueous or vitreous culture. However, a negative culture does not exclude the diagnosis. The primary part of the specimen culture and blood culture has a high diagnostic value, but because the eye is not easy to obtain a large number of specimens. Eye culture of the positive rate is low, even less than 30%, so usually as long as the clinical symptoms can be diagnosed. Decrease in ambulatory consumption of cephalexin and cotrimoxasole in the period of five years (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) was observed, followed by significant decline in antimicrobial resistance of E. coli to these two drugs (to 10.2% and 23.3% in 2010, and to 6.7% and 24.5% in 2015, respectively), especially in females aged <65 years ( p < 0,01). The highest resistance rates for any isolate-antimicrobial combination ( particularly to fluoroquinolones) were detected in older males. The total proportion of ESBL producing E. coli strains rose from 1.6% in 2005 to 4.0% in 2010, and to 5% in 2015, with especially high resistance rate in older age groups ( p < 0.001). Conclusion: Decrease in consumption of certain antibiotics in the community leads to improvement in bacterial susceptibility. Due to the updates in Croatian guidelines on empirical treatment of CA-UTIs, changes in ambulatory use of antibiotics occurred. Withdrawal of amoxicillin, cephalexin and co-trimoxasole from the list of first line agents for empirical treatment of uncomplicated cystitis, elicited significant improvement in susceptibility of uropathogenic E. coli to these antibiotics. Since no obvious rise in fluoroquinolones use occurred, the increasing trend in resistance which might be caused by the spread of highly epidemic fluoroquinolone-resistant uropathogenic E. coli clonal groups, particularly in older men, requires further investigation. 1. Investigation of 4 drug-resistant bacteria with clinical significance to healthcare-associated infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycinresistant Enterococcus (VRE), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and carbapenem-resistant Enterobactoriaceae (CRE). 2. By using the Whonet system and working with our IT (Information Technology) department, a statistical report format was constructed. We could analyze the isolation rates and trend of drug-resistant pattern of the above bacteria from January, 2015 to February, 2017. 3. The analyzed results were reported and tracked in group meetings regularly held by our infection control committee to provide timely and effective clinical information to our infection control practitioners and physicians. Results: The isolation rates of 4 multi-drug resistant bacteria are as follows respectively: MRSA, between 27.7% and 55.3% (means: 47.4%); CRAB, reduced from 71.8% to 33.3% (means: 44.0%). Both the annual isolation rates of MRSA and CRAB declined significantly. The isolation rates of CRE dropped from 5.4% to 3.3% (means: 4.0%), with flat trend. However, VRE increased from 1.9% to 23.9% (means: 13.0%), which showed an upward trend. Conclusion: The trend analysis of MRSA, CRAB and CRE indicated successful infection control. However, the increased isolation rate of VRE highlighted the need to reinforce further monitoring of VRE infection, which is the key point of infection control in our hospital. Epidemiological analysis of multi-drug resistant pathogens could assist clinicians in choosing the appropriate antibiotics. By this analysis, a decrease of multi-drug resistant microorganisms, improved patient survival, a better quality of care, as well as the reduction of medical expense would all be expected.
