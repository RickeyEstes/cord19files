The main goal of infectious clone assembly is the construction of plasmid vectors that harbour a faithful copy of virus genomes, which in appropriate conditions can launch a plant infection that mimic natural ones. Detailed step-by-step protocols have been described elsewhere (Nagata and Inoue-Nagata, 2015; Peremyslov and Dolja, 2007) , and a workflow summary is shown in Figure 2 . Here, we review recent improvements that have allowed one-step, streamlined assembly of binary infectious clones with no intermediate subcloning steps. For decades, the most common approaches to assembly of DNA constructs and infectious clones have taken advantage of restriction endonuclease specificities to create compatible ends that were joined using DNA ligases. The presence or lack of restriction sites in vector backbone and viral sequences were major constraints to the assembly of large and multiple inserts (Nakahara et al., 2015) . Cloning methods have been developed to overcome these limitations, thus allowing high-throughput assembly of DNA constructs (reviewed in (Chao et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2013) ). Recombinase-based technologies, such as Gateway, Creator and Echo cloning and SIRA, are widely adopted for building of gene constructs due to their high efficiency, flexibility and comprehensive plasmid collections (Karimi et al., 2007) . Current recombinase-based technologies are not scar-free, as recombination sequences are retained in final assemblies. Cloning scars might alter virus viability and infectivity, especially when multiple fragments are joined to span the entire virus genome sequence. Not surprisingly, in recent years, plant virologists have increasingly adopted seamless cloning strategies (Table 1) . These include type IIS restriction endonuclease-and overlap-based methods, which have the ability to join 2-10 fragments in a predetermined order to yield final constructs lacking assembly scars, that is, seamless. Type IIS restriction enzymes cut DNA outside their recognition site and produce an overhang of 1-5 nucleotides, which can be chosen to generate a ligation product free of unwanted sequences. In Golden Gate cloning, a one-pot mix of type IIS endonucleases (i.e. Bsal or BsmBl) and a DNA ligase, allows simultaneous digestion and assembly of multiple fragments (Engler et al., 2008) . Despite its advantages, use of Golden Gate has not been yet reported for construction of infectious clones. As traditional restriction enzyme-based methods, fragments with internal instances of the type IIS endonuclease recognition site are not suitable for Golden Gate, which complicates assembly of large virus genomes. Compared to BsaI or BsmBI, use of 7-nt type IIS cutters such as SapI and AarI cope better with large assemblies (Andreou and Nakayama, 2018) , and could be a better choice for standardized high-throughput assemblies of infection clones. Overlap-based methods are very versatile, extremely flexible and, by solving major constraints of restriction enzyme use, they are revolutionizing the construction of virus infectious clones. The GeneArt seamless cloning kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) contains a proprietary enzyme mix with exonuclease activity that allows one-step assembly of fragments with 15-bp homology; it has been used to build agroinfectious clones of genera Torradovirus (Wieczorek et al., 2015) and View, CA) relies on the vaccinia virus DNA polymerase, which attacks linear DNA to expose 5 0 ends and promote annealing of fragments with 15-bp sequence overlap (Irwin et al., 2012) . Molecules assembled by In-Fusion are not covalently joined and are sealed in vivo. A potyvirus infectious clone for in vitro transcription (Tuo et al., 2015) and a binary vector for agroinoculation of a trichovirus have been generated by this method (Zhang and Jelkmann, 2017) . In-Fusion was also used to engineer the first binary vector for plant delivery of a negative-stranded RNA virus (Wang et al., 2015) . Notwithstanding, the one-pot, one-step isothermal assembly method described by Gibson et al. (2009) is by far the most popular. During Gibson assembly (SGI-DNA, La Jolla, CA), an exonuclease exposes 3 0 ends of linear DNA; then, fragments that share terminal overlapping homologies anneal and prime a DNA polymerase which fills overhang gaps; finally, a DNA ligase seals the nicks. In contrast to In-Fusion, Gibson assembly yields closed circular DNA molecules.

Virus taxonomy information (MSL #32; March 12, 2018), sequence accession numbers (VMR 290118) and unassigned satellite species were obtained from the ICTV database (Lefkowitz et al., 2018 (Pasin et al., 2017 (Pasin et al., , 2018 . As an alternative to in vitro assembly methods, circular plasmids can be produced in vivo by the cell endogenous homologous recombination machinery. Homologous recombination occurs naturally in yeast with high efficiency and fidelity, and has been used for decades to construct plasmids from DNA fragments containing homologous regions. More recently, cotransformation of yeast cells with 25 different overlapping fragments allowed correct assembly of a 590-kb molecule (Gibson et al., 2008) . This finding highlights the extreme potential of in vivo yeast assembly, which has been used for target mutagenesis of a polerovirus clone (Liang et al., 2004) , and later to assemble binary infectious clones of members of genera Trichovirus, Potyvirus and Mandarivirus (Cui et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2017; Youssef et al., 2011) . Bacteria provide high transformation efficiency, plasmid yields and rapid growth rates, but homologous recombination efficiencies reported in E. coli are orders of magnitude lower than those of yeast. Unsatisfactory results of bacterial homologous recombination prompted the design of new in vivo assembly strategies. Expression of RecET proteins from the Rac prophage or the Redabc from lambda phage greatly improves homologous recombination in E. coli (Murphy, 1998; Zhang et al., 1998) . These in vivo recombination systems, known as recombineering, are frequently used to engineer bacteriophage genomes (Lemire et al., 2018) . Highly efficient homologous recombination between linear DNA molecules was obtained by direct transformation of E. coli strains expressing the RecET proteins (Fu et al., 2012) . Although it has yet to be reported, use of recombineering and enhanced RecETexpressing bacteria are promising approaches for assembly of plant virus infectious clones in binary vectors. Improving clone stability. . . Plant viruses are often recalcitrant to molecular cloning. Sequence alterations, such as point mutations and deletions, might arise during clone assembly and propagation in bacteria (Bedoya and Dar os, 2010; Satyanarayana et al., 2003) . Spontaneous acquisitions of DNA inserts and transposons that disrupt viral genes have also been reported (Donson et al., 1993; Gonz alez et al., 2002; Tran et al., 2019; Yount et al., 2000) . These have been linked to toxicity of unwanted viral expression products in bacterial hosts, and several approaches were therefore designed to tackle instability issues. Although inconvenient for routine cloning procedures, assembly chassis that better tolerate toxic, difficult constructs, such as yeast and Agrobacterium, have been used for binary clone assembly (Sun et al., 2017; Tuo et al., 2017; Youssef et al., 2011) . Better choices for repeated plasmid manipulations are E. coli strains suitable for cloning unstable DNA, that is, Stbl2 and Stbl4 (ThermoFisher), and SURE2 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Reduction in E. coli incubation temperatures (e.g. from 37°C to 25-30°C) slows bacterial growth rates and improves maintenance and propagation of problematic constructs. These approaches nonetheless palliate rather than solve plasmid instability. A popular strategy used to obtain stable infectious clones involves interruption of viral genes with eukaryotic introns that contain multiple stop codons; these avoid accumulation of undesired viral proteins and the consequent toxicity in bacteria (Johansen and Lund, 2008) . After plant inoculation, introns are removed by splicing, viral sequences are reconstituted in vivo and infections initiate. Introns were successfully used to stabilize infectious clones of diverse viruses including large positive-strand RNA viruses from the Potyviridae, Closteroviridae and Coronaviridae families (Ambr os et al., 2011; Gonz alez et al., 2002; Johansen, 1996; L opez-Moya and Garc ıa, 2000) . Insertion of multiple introns may be required to disrupt putatively toxic genes and stabilize clones (Bukovinszki et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2012) . For the same purpose, targeted introduction of mutations that change translation frame or remove cryptic bacterial promoters and ribosomal binding sites from viral sequences has also been applied to improve clone stability (Chikh Ali et al., 2011; Pu et al., 2011; Satyanarayana et al., 2003) . Although powerful, these strategies might require intermediate subcloning steps that complicate assembly designs. In many cases, rational choice of vector backbones, regulatory elements and component layout is a sufficient and key factor in the assembly of stable infectious clones with intron-free, unmodified copies of full-length virus genome sequences (Bedoya and Dar os, 2010) . Use of binary vector backbones with reduced copy number origins lessens foreign DNA loads and potential bacterial toxicity of the viral sequences. Binary vectors with single-, low-or medium-copy origins are available (Hamilton et al., 1996; Pasin et al., 2017; Xiang et al., 1999) and have been used to generate infectious clones of members of families with large genomes, such as Potyviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Closteroviridae (Ambr os et al., (2015) NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly Proprietary Pasin et al. (2017) In vivo yeast assembly Plasmid vectors with yeast origin Youssef et al. (2011) In vivo bacterial assembly ( Lellis et al., 2002; Pasin et al., 2017 Pasin et al., , 2018 Prokhnevsky et al., 2002; Shi et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2015) . Choice of binary vector origin was also shown to affect Agrobacterium transformation efficiency in both stable transformation and transient expression assays (Pasin et al., 2017; Zhi et al., 2015) . Cloning cassettes often include reporter genes under strong bacterial promoters (e.g. lacZa for white/blue screens). Improper removal of reporter genes and their regulatory elements could lead to the inadvisable result that the entire virus genome is constitutively expressed in the bacterial host. Insertion of virus genome cassettes in reverse orientation to genes needed for plasmid maintenance (i.e. resistance markers, replication proteins) helps prevent viral gene transcription, translation and consequent toxicity in bacteria (Bedoya and Dar os, 2010) . Flanking inserts with bacterial terminators avoids transcriptional read-through from adjacent sequences and increases plasmid stability. Binary vectors with strong synthetic bacterial terminators up-and downstream of the T-DNA cassette have been described, and used for assembly of clones with intron-free copies of virus genomes (Pasin et al., 2017 (Pasin et al., , 2018 . A stable full-length cDNA clone of Zika virus was recently assembled into the linear vector pJAZZ (Annamalai et al., 2017; Godiska et al., 2010) . Although not reported to date, linear plasmids may also be used to generate stable infectious clones of plant viruses. Finally, basic microbiology skills are helpful for obtaining fulllength infectious clones. A mixture of small and large colonies can appear during agar plate selection of transformed bacteria. As large colonies often contain partial or rearranged plasmids, small colonies should be selected for subsequent analysis (Gonz alez et al., 2002) . Bacteria with correct plasmids can have slow growth rates due to the burden associated with propagation of large inserts and/or with leaky expression and toxicity of viral genes (Satyanarayana et al., 2003) . Long incubation times allow slow-growing colonies to appear and increase the chance of obtaining positive clones. For the assembly of novel infectious clones and as a rule of thumb, we thus recommend incubating E. coli plates at 30°C (see above) for 36-72 h and that picking large colonies should be avoided. Long incubation times might also be required during E. coli growth in liquid cultures and infectious clone propagation in Agrobacterium.
