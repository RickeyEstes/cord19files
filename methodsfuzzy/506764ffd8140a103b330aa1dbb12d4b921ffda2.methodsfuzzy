The xMAP assays were carried out in 96-well polystyrene microplates using Luminex 200 detection system (Luminex, USA). Relevant positive and negative sera have been prepared for the establishment of the singleplex xMAP assay to detect ILTV antibody or IBV antibody in the serum. ILTV gD protein at the following concentrations (2.5 μg, 5 μg, 10 μg, 20 μg, 40 μg, and 80 μg) and IBV N protein at the following concentrations (3 μg, 6 μg, 12 μg, 24 μg, 48 μg, and 96 μg) were coupled with 5 × 10 5 magbeads to determine the optimum antigen concentration for singleplex xMAP assay. A serious dilution of sera at the range from 1:25 to 1:200 have been made to determine the optimal sample dilution. Cross-reactivity or specificity was evaluated by making the assay with sera from chicken infected with AIV, ALV, NDV, and MDV. Then, a duplex xMAP assay was established based on the result of two separated singleplex xMAP assay. In briefly, a 50 μL aliquot of the simplex beads (50 beads/μL) or the duplex beads (100 beads/μL, 50 beads/μL each kind) was transferred into the wells, added in 50 μL of diluted sera. Incubation was conducted on a plate shaker (800 rpm) at RT for 60 min. The centrifugation was conducted in the magnetic separator for 60 s. The supernatant was removed from each well. Beads were washed 5 times in 100 μL PBS. Each well was added with 100 μL of a biotinylated secondary antibody (goat anti-chicken IgY, Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology, China) at 2 μg/mL. The plate was shaken (800 rpm) for 30 min at RT and washed as described above. Finally, 2 μg/mL of streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SAPE, Life Technologies GmbH) was added to each well at 100 μL/well. The plate was shaken and the supernatant was removed. Finally, 100 μL of assay buffer was added to each well. The plate was shaken for approximately 15 s and analyzed according to the manufacturer's protocol. All samples were conducted in triplicates in each assay.
