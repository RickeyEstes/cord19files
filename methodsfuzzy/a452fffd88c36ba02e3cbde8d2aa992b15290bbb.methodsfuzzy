For naked eye to observe change of colors [13] , one can use SYBR Green I, hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) or propidium iodide. It also can be detected by color change caused by gold nanoparticles (AuNP) probes, which will be introduced in the Section 3. SYBR Green I solution turns from orange to green [19] ; HNB solution is blue for positive reactions and purple for negative reactions [14] ; and propidium iodide turns pink in positive reactions or orange in negative reactions [14, 23] . Other methods that can produce color changes for eye inspection include colorimetric dot-blot hybridization [43] , lateral flow [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] , electrochemical DNA chip functionalized with oligo-DNA probes [49] , cationic polymer-mediated precipitation of fluorochrome-labeled oligo-DNA probe [50] , alternatively binding quenching probe competition assay [51] , polyacrylamide gelbased microchamber [52] , and fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) [53] .
