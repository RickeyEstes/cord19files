2.1. Vaccine Construction. DNA encoding ( Figure 1 ) 10 tandem copies (10xM2e) of M2e (SLLTEVETLTRNGWECKCS-DSSD) was prepared commercially (Blue Heron Biotechnology) using codons preferred by L. lactis. BspE1 restriction sites were included at each end for cloning. 10xM2e was cloned into the lactococcal expression vector pP16pip as described [8] using standard methods, creating pBG-10xM2e, and transformed [33] into the plasmid-free strain L. lactis LM2301 [34] .
