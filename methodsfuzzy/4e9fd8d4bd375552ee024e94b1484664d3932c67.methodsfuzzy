The study was approved by the ethical review board of National Taiwan University. The registry file of the TDA provided the basic demographic information of the study cohort, which was initiated in January 1985 and terminated at the end of December 2009. Information included the name, date and place of birth, gender, personal identification (ID) number, enrollment, education, medical specialties, location of practice, vital status, date of death, and date of termination of membership or retirement of each individual. The termination of practice was defined as the end of the study, date of death, or termination of membership. There were 410 participants for whom we were unable to find the date of license acquisition, which were assumed to be July 1 of the year the dentist turned 24 years of age. The causes of death were obtained from the National Mortality Registry (NMR) at the Department of Health, Taiwan through the ID number of each deceased individual. Twenty-six of the 289 deceased dentists had an unknown cause of death. The all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates of the dentists were compared with those of the reference groups. Person-years and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using the Life Table Analysis System (LTAS.NET), which was first developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and SMRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the mortality rates of the 119 underlying causes of death of the general population and internists of Taiwan as the reference group, respectively. In this study, we set the significance level to p < 0.05. While the mortality rates of the general population can be directly retrieved from the vital statistics tables of Taiwan, we recruited similar data on all practicing internists in the TMA. These individuals were followed from 1990e2006 to serve as an alternative reference group. 14 Cox proportional hazard analysis was conducted to determine the hazard ratios and 95% CIs for the following risk factors: age, gender, specialty, geographic region of practice, age at the beginning of practice, year practice was begun (before or after 1995 when the NHI system was established), and physician-to-population ratio. The physician-to-population ratios were categorized into four levels: > 1:500, between 1:500 and 1:700, between 1:700 and 1:900, and < 1:900 (Table 1) . We applied a stepwise strategy for variable selection using a significance level for entry and significance level to stay that were both set to 0.15. Regression diagnostics were also run, including examination of the proportional hazard assumption, residual analysis, and detection of influential cases, and we also checked for multicollinearity to assure good quality analysis and goodness of fit of the model.
