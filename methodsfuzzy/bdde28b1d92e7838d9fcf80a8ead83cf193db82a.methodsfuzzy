Cells. Cultures of dissociated CNS cells were obtained from spinal cord dissected from 12-to 13-day-old C57B1/6 mouse embryos as described before (Faulkner et al., 1979; Hooghe-Peters et al., 1979) . C57B1/6 mice are permissive for the JHM strains. Cells were grown on 12-mm glass coverslips or 35-mm petri dishes coated with collagen and supplemented with medium as described (Faulkner et al., 1979; Hooghe-Peters et al., 1979) . Fibroblast growth was inhibited by a 2-day antimitotic treatment with a mixture of FudR and uridine after 1 week in vitro. Cultures were used after 2 to 3 weeks of in vitro maturation when neurons and astrocytes had acquired their mature stage (Figs. la and b). Three cell types were identified in these cultures. The neurons represent 5 to 10% of the cells; they are either isolated or in clusters and show a characteristic morphology with long processes as seen by phase microscopy ( Fig. la) (Faulkner et al., 1979; Hooghe-Peters et al., 1979) . The nonneuronal (NN) cells are comprised of at least two cell types as judged on the basis of positive or negative immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a specific protein of astrocytes (Bignami et al., 1980) . GFAP+ cells represent 50 to 70% of the NN cells; these astrocytes have a pleiomorphic shape, contain radiating fibrils, and form groups under the neurons. GFAP-cells probably represent primary fibroblastic cells of CNS origin (meningeal or perivascular). Oligodendrocytes were not detected in these cultures. VimLses. The A59 virus, a hepatotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus, was used as described before (Sturman and Takemoto, 1972; Sturman and Holmes, 1977; Sturman et al., 1980) . The origin and propagation of the wt and ts8 strains of JHM have been published (Haspel et al., 1978) . The multiplicity of infection of 10 plaqueforming units (PFU)/cell was used with A59, whereas a multiplicity of infection of 0.3 to 1 PFU/cell was used with both JHM strains (the JHM stock viruses had much lower titers). Viral adsorption was carried out for 1 hr at 37" as previously described (Knobler et al., 1981a) . Cultures were incubated at 37", although in a few experiments paired cultures were also incubated at 34". The cultures were observed daily with a Zeiss inverted phase scope. Viral infectivity of supernatant fluids was determined by plaque assay in L2 or 17CL 1 cells as described (Sturman and Takemoto, 1972) . Antiserum and immunolubeling. Four different rabbit antisera were used. Rabbit antiserum against GFAP was kindly provided by Dr. Rebecca Pruss; the rabbit had been injected with a suspension of human spinal cord. When reacted with cord proteins separated by agar gel electrophoresis, immune reactivity of this serum was found to be restricted to GFAP. Preparation and characterization of monospecific polyclonal rabbit antisera to the isolated El and Ez glycoproteins of A59 virion envelope has been previously described (Sturman et al., 1980) . Rabbit antisera directed against gradient-puri-fied NP40-disrupted A59 virions were also prepared. This hyperimmune serum immunoprecipitated the three major structural polypeptides of both A59 and JHM from radiolabeled infected cells. For fluorescent antibody (FA) staining, dissociated CNS cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in a mixture of 5% acetic acid and 95% ethyl alcohol at -20" (for GFAP staining) or in acetone (for El or Ez staining) before being incubated for 1 hr in various dilutions of antisera. In some instances, living cells were incubated with antiviral sera at 4' or room temperature in order to detect only antigens on the cell surface. The second reagent used to detect bound antibodies was either protein Afluorescein (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N. J.) or goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to fluorescein. This conjugate was absorbed with liver powder or 17CL 1 cells. For immunoperoxidase labeling, staining was performed as described before (Knobler et al., 1981a) . Briefly, the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde with 0.3 to 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 20 min, frozen and thawed in a sucrose-glycerol mixture in order to render the cell membrane permeable to antibody molecules. The cells were then allowed to react with antibody to the virion or to glycoprotein El or Ez. Protein A-peroxidase was used as a second layer and cells were further incubated in the peroxide-diaminobenzidine substrate. Immediate observations by light microscopy were done on a Zeiss photomicroscope III using a water immersion phase contrast (40X) objective for immunoperoxidase or an oil immersion (40x) objective for fluorescence. When double labeling with antisera to both GFAP and viral antigens was performed, glass coverslip cultures of CNS cells were fixed with acid-alcohol at -20". After washing with serum containing medium, the coverslips were incubated successively in: (1) rabbit antiserum to GFAP, (Faulkner et al., 1979) , glass coverslips covered with cells were used for scanning electron microscopy @EM), whereas 35mm petri dishes were used for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. Cells were usually fixed with Karnovsky fixative consisting of a mixture of 1.25% glutaraldehyde and 1% formaldehyde in 0.06 M cacodylate buffer at pH 7.2. For SEM studies, cells were then postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 2 hr, and dehydrated in methanol, critical point dried in COz in a Balzer apparatus, coated under high vacuum with gold-palladium alloy, and observed in an ETEC Autoscan at 20 kV and a tilt angle of 45'. For TEM studies, monolayers in petri dishes that had been labeled by the immunoperoxidase method (as described above) or fixed in situ with the Karnovsky fixative, were postfixed with osmium tetroxyde 1% in cacodylate buffer for 30 min, stained with uranyl acetate at pH 5, progressively dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in Epon 812. The technique for circling and drilling out immunolabeled cells or syncytia from the embedded monolayer has been published in detail (Knobler et al., 1981a) . Sections were cut with a diamond knife and examined in Philips 201 or Philips 400-T electron microscopes. Thin sections were usually counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead salts, and examined at 80 kV. proteins between 16 and 18 hr. Titers of JHM was examined successively in inreleased virus were always lower than ti-fected neurons and NN cells. Infected neuters of CNS cells infected with A59 strain rons showed diffuse immunofluorescent (Table 1) PI, the organization of the cytoplasm of infected neurons was not altered since they had an extensive rough ER system and a normal distribution of other organelles. Budding and free virions with electron-lucent centers were detected in cisternae of smooth membranes closely associated with the Golgi apparatus (Figs.  2a, b) . Virus was also found occasionally in small vacuoles within dendrites (Fig.  2~ ) as seen in infected mouse spinal cord in tivo (Knobler et al., 1981a) . At 48 hr PI, the cytoplasm of infected neurons showed disorganization of RER membranes and vacuolization.
