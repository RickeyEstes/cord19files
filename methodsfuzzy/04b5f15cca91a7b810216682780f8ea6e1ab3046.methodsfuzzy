Camel samples and nucleic acid extraction NP swab samples were collected from 376 apparently healthy camels as part of a MERS-CoV surveillance study carried out at a live animal market in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Collection of samples from camels performed in this study was approved by the CDC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number 2702HALMULX). The age, sex, origin, pen number and the initial MERS-CoV qPCR result of the 108 MERS-CoV-positive camels that were further analyzed at CDC are shown in S1 Table. Total ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted and purified using the EZ1 Virus Mini Kit 2.0 (QIAGEN) and stored at -80ËšC.
