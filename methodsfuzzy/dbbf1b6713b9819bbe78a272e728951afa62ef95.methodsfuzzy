With the exception of MTB, the extraction of the bacterial and viral NAs at the PATH laboratory was performed using Qiagen NA extraction kits (Hilden, Germany) as described below. All NA eluates derived from extractions were stored at -80˚C until use. Viral RNA from spiked sputum and blood panel members was extracted using 140 μL aliquots of each specimen, processed with the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit following the manufacturer's protocol. All RNAs were eluted in a final volume of 60 μL. For viral RNA from spiked stool panel members, a pre-RNA extraction clean-up step was done as follows. Briefly, 200 mg amounts of stool were homogenized in 800 μL PBS via vortexing and then clarified by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 4,000 X g. The supernatant was filtered using a 0.22 μm filter (EMD Millipore), and 140 μL aliquots of filtrate were then processed with the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit. Bacterial DNA from blood was extracted using 200 μL processed with the QIAamp DNA blood mini kit and eluted in a final volume of 200 μL. Bacterial DNA from stool was extracted from 200 mg using the QIAamp DNA Stool mini kit and eluted in 200 μL volumes. MTB DNA was extracted from sputum using a previous methodology [31] . Briefly, 500 μL sample volumes were liquefied using an equal volume of 2% N-acetyl-L-cysteine and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. PBS was added to a final volume of 50 mLs, the cells pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 μL Tris EDTA buffer (pH8.0) containing acid-washed glass beads and disrupted for 2 min (Cell Disruptor Genie, Scientific Industries, Bohemia, NY, USA). The cell lysates were centrifuged and clarified supernatants transferred to sterile microtubes. Spiked target levels (described below) for the microbes in each panel were independently confirmed at the CDC laboratory as follows. Briefly, all spiked samples were extracted using the MagNA Pure Compact instrument with the Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I external lysis protocol (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and eluted in a final volume of 100 μL for all extracts. Prior to NA extraction, the different specimen types were processed via alternative methods. For sputum, 300 μL of each sample was first incubated with 300 μL dithiothreitol solution (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at room temperature for 1 hour prior to extraction. For blood samples, 400 μL of blood was first mixed with 400 μL bacterial lysis buffer (Roche), 400 μL pH neutral buffer, and 40 μL proteinase K (25 mg/mL) with subsequent incubation at ambient temperature for 15 minutes. Glass beads (800 mg, 0.5 mm) were added and the cells were disrupted twice for one minute at 5000 rpm. The solution was then centrifuged at 10 000 × g for one minute and 700 μL of the supernatant used for extraction. For stool, 200 mg were mixed with 2 mL PBS and then briefly centrifuged to pellet particulates. Four hundred μL of the supernatant was combined with 400 μL bacterial lysis buffer (Roche), 400 μL pH neutral buffer, and 40 μL proteinase K (25 mg/mL) and incubated at ambient temperature for 15 minutes. Glass beads (800 mg, 0.5mm) were added and cells disrupted twice for one minute at 5000 rpm. The solution was centrifuged at 10 000 × g for one minute, and 700 μL of supernatant was used for extraction. All NA eluates were stored at -80˚C until use. The PATH and the CDC laboratories both used the CDC-validated real-time RT-PCR assays specific for each target microbe in this study. Oligonucleotide primers and probes were procured from IDT (Coralville, IA, USA). Real time PCR has previously been described as an effective method by which to assess the performance of extraction methods in that it is highly specific, it can detect very low levels of target and can indirectly inform on the purity of extracted samples [17] [18] [19] . The core amplification reagent used in all real time RT-PCR assays was qScript XLT 1-Step RT-qPCR ToughMix (Quanta Bio, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). All reactions were conducted in 20 μL volumes into which 5 μL of NA extract was added to create a final reaction volume of 25 μL. All reactions were processed under the same thermal cycling protocol, irrespective of the RT-PCR instrument used or the target microbe and the specimen matrix, and included use of a reverse transcription step. Cycling conditions were as follows: 45˚C for 10 min, 95˚C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 95˚C for 30 sec and 60˚C for 1 min. Fluorescence in the FAM channel was measured in real time during the 60˚C stage. Real-time RT-PCR was performed on an Agilent Mx3005P qPCR system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at the PATH laboratory and the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast system (Ther-moFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at the CDC laboratory. Construction of DNA-and RNA-spiked blinded panels. Each pooled specimen panel was comprised of ten sample members, with most spiked with a bacterial pathogen and/or an RNA-based virus to assess NA extraction efficiencies from the three specimen matrices (Table 1) . Each panel was comprised of seven spiked (positive) and three unspiked (negative) samples. These were labelled SP1-10 (SPutum), BL1-10 (BLood), and ST1-10 (STool). Sputum was spiked with MTB and/or influenza A virus; whole blood was spiked with S. pneumoniae and/or MS2 bacteriophage; and stool was spiked with S. Typhimurium LT2 and/or MS2 phage. The input amount of each test microbe used for spiking was semi-quantitatively determined via PCR Crossing threshold (C t ) values derived from the NA extracts of the various agents. The intent was to spike samples with sufficient NA to represent high (C t 18 ± 1.5), medium (C t 26 ± 1.5) and low (C t 35 ± 1.5) amounts of test microbe NA in each specimen panel, with corresponding levels of one microbe and/or the other [19] . The sputum (SP) panel was prepared by pooling 210 mLs of raw human sputum and blending to create a homogenous mixture. The homogenate was then split into ten 20 mL aliquots. Eight aliquots were spiked with MTB cells and/or influenza A virions, again corresponding to high, medium, and low C t levels, and subsequently mixed to create a uniform distribution of MTB cells and influenza A virions in the respective test panel samples. The SP panel samples were dispensed into 0.5 mL aliquots for later use. Whole blood (BL) was split into ten 36 mL aliquots. Eight aliquots were spiked with varying concentrations of S. pneumoniae and MS2 phage corresponding to high, medium, or low C t levels. The spiked blood panels were then mixed to ensure an even distribution of spiking agents. The ten BL panels were then aliquoted in 1 mL volumes. For the construction of the stool (ST) panel, a 40% (w/v) stool homogenate in PBS was prepared in a blender and aliquoted into ten 40 mL volumes. Eight samples were spiked with S. Typhimurium and/or MS2 stocks corresponding to high, medium, or low C t levels and distributed into 1 mL aliquots. After each sample set was prepared, the tubes were frozen using a dry ice/ethanol bath and then stored at -80˚C until shipping or further use. To ensure the C t value from each spiked sample was within the expected range, the DNA and RNA were extracted from representative aliquots in each panel following their construction. The NA extracts were then analyzed by real time RT-PCR assays specific to each spiked microbe. Low-spiked samples representing each target microbe were also processed after a freeze and thaw cycle to ensure sample integrity. NA extracts from the three specimen panels were then independently tested by RT-PCR at the CDC to confirm the original test data derived at the PATH laboratory. While the C t values were typically in close agreement to the PATH NA extracts, trace amounts of MTB DNA were consistently detected in Sample SP6, a Table 1 . Target-spike levels used in the construction of each specimen panel. The format of each panel was the same. Samples were spiked with different microbes to represent varying levels of DNA and RNA for subsequent NA extraction: +++ high spike (C t 18 ± 1.5); ++ medium spike (C t 26 ± 1.5); + low spike (C t 35 ± 1.5);-no spike.
