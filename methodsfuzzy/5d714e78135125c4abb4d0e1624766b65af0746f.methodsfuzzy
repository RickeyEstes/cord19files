Freshly diagnosed cases of CNS glioma, multiple sclerosis, primary generalised epilepsy, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Down's syndrome, AIDS dementia with neuropsychiatric features, syndrome-X with multiple lacunar state were included in the study. Fifteen cases were included in each group and selected randomly from the patients attending the Department of Medicine, Medical College Hospital, Trivandrum. The freshly diagnosed cases were selected for the study before treatment protocols were initiated. Fifteen members of the indexed family were also included in the study. Each patient had an age and sex matched healthy control. Fifteen cases of healthy right-handed/left hemispheric dominant and left-handed/right hemispheric dominant individuals between the ages of 20 and 30 years were also chosen for the study. The hemispheric dominance was verified by the dichotic listening test. These normal individuals were free from all the systemic diseases and were selected randomly from general population of Trivandrum city. None of the patients/normal individuals studied were smokers (active or passive). None of the subjects studied were under medication at the time of removal of blood. Fasting blood was removed in citrate tubes from each of the number of patients mentioned above. RBCs were separated with in 1 h of collection of blood for the estimation of membrane Na þ -K þ ATPase. Plasma was used for the analysis of various parameters. The methodology used in the study was as follows: All biochemicals used in this study were obtained from M/s. Sigma Chemicals, USA. Activity of HMG CoA reductase of the plasma that was determined by the method of Rao and Ramakrishnan by determining the ratio of HMG CoA to mevalonate (16) . For the determination of the RBC Na þ -K þ ATPase activity of the erythrocyte membrane, the procedure described by Wallach and Kamat was used (17) . Digoxin in the plasma was determined by the procedure described by Arun et al. (18) was used. For estimation of ubiquinone and dolichol in the plasma, procedure described by Palmer et al. (19) was used. Magnesium in the plasma was estimated by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (20) . Tryptophan was estimated by the method of David and William and tyrosine by the method of Wong et al. (21, 22) . Serotonin was estimated by the method of Curzon et al. and catecholamines by the method of Well-Malherbe et al. (23, 24) . Quinolinic acid content of plasma was estimated by HPLC (C18 column micro Bondapake 4.6 c 140 mm), solvent system 0.01 M acetate buffer (pH 3.0) and methanol (6:4), flow rate 1.0 ml/min and detection UV 250 mm). Morphine, strychnine and nicotine were esti-mated by the method described by Arun et al. (13) . Details of the procedures used for the estimation of total and individual GAG, carbohydrate components of glycoproteins, activity of enzymes involved in the degradation of GAG (b-glucuronidase, b-N-acetyl hexosaminadase, hyaluronidase and cathepsin D), activity of glycohydrolases (b-galactosidase, b-fucosidase and b-glucosidase) are described before (25) . Serum glycolipids (gangliosides, glycosyl diglycerides, cerebrosides and sulphatides) were estimated as described in Methods in Enzymology (26) . Cholesterol was estimated by using commercial kits supplied by Sigma Chemicals, USA. SOD was assayed by the method of Nishikini et al. as modified by Kakkar et al. (27) . Catalase activity was estimated by the method of Maehly and Chance, glutathione peroxidase by the method of Paglia and Valentine as modified by Lawrence and Burk and glutathione reductase by the method of Horn and Burns (28) (29) (30) . MDA was estimated by the method of Wills et al. and conjugated dienes and hydroperoxides by the procedure of Brien et al. (31, 32) . Reduced glutathione was estimated by the method of Beutler et al. (33) . Nitric oxide was estimated in the plasma by the method of Gabor and Allon (34) . Statistical analysis was done by Student's 't' test with modified degree of freedom and the Bonferroni correction was applied. In all cases the degree of freedom is 28 only. The degree of freedom is calculated by using the formula N 1 þ N 2 À 2 (here 15 þ 15 À 2).
