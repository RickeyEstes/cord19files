A recrudescence event was defined as the reappearance of at least one confirmed case of EVD in a country where the end of EVD had been declared in advance. The term 'recrudescence' is used, because the reappearance of EVD in West Africa has been associated with persistent activity of infection arising from already infected humans. WHO reports and other sources were reviewed in an analysis of all known recrudescence events occurring from 2014 to 2016 (World Health Organization, 2016; Sheri, 2015; Farge and Giahyue, 2015; Dahl et al., 2016; Dakaractu, 2016; Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, 2016) . In the statistical analysis, the background mechanisms of erroneous declarations of the end of an EVD outbreak in West Africa during 2014-2016 were investigated. A survey of the demographic variables of recrudescent cases was performed (i.e., age and sex), and the most likely source of infection and the dates of illness onset and confirmation were also obtained. By examining the date of confirmation of the purported last case (i.e., the case before the recrudescent case) and the date on which the outbreak was declared to have ended, the following were calculated: (1) the time interval between successive confirmations, (2) the number of days from burial or the second negative testing result of the last case, and (3) the number of days in heightened surveillance.
