Several alternative approaches for discovery of new motifs have been advanced. Edwards and Palopoli [40] review the alternatives in depth, discussing their merits and drawbacks. Briefly, they can be divided into alignment-based and alignment-free methods. An alignment-based approach looks for conserved sites among homologous sequences, but can be misled by high sequence conservation in globular domains. A program called SLiMPrints works around this with a specialized approach to model substitutions [42] . SLiMPrints uses a statistical model of relative local conservation, which looks for clusters of overly constrained sites in a window of about 30 AAs, using IUPred scores (intrinsically unordered prediction; see later) to weigh sites in intrinsically disordered protein regions more heavily than sites in globular (ordered) regimes [42] . In contrast, alignment-free methods look for enrichment of amino acid patterns in proteins that are expected by other means to perform similar motif-related roles, for example, by GO category annotations or protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, that is, via databases that capture experimental evidence for protein colocalization and functional interactions. An important caveat is that to assume such sequences are independent could yield spurious enrichment of shared patterns, so alignment-free methods need to compensate for evolutionary constraints at the domain level, rather than for full-length homologous proteins. The development of such corrections and their relative advantages are detailed in [40] . Some programs (e.g., SLiMDisc [43] , SLiMFinder [44, 45] , and DILIMOT [46, 47] ) produce regular expressions that compensate for phylogenetic relatedness, while others (MEME suite, GLAM2 [48] , and NestedMICA [49, 50] ) produce probabilistic profiles. For more discussion of these and issues of concern for computational motif discovery, see [40] .
