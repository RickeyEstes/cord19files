Preparation of soil minerals and soils. Montmorillonite (SWy-2) and kaolinite (KGa-1b) clays, obtained from the Clay Minerals Society Source Clays Repository (West Lafayette, Indiana, United States), were size-fractionated by wet sedimentation to obtain particles with d h ¼ 0.5-2 lm and saturated with sodium. These reference clay samples were extensively characterized previously [23, 41] . Fine quartz sand (d h ¼ 125-250 lm) and SiO 2 microparticles (d h ¼ 1-5 lm; 99% purity) were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, Missouri, United States). The fine quartz sand was soaked for 24 h in 12 N HCl to remove impurities. X-ray diffraction analysis and infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy indicated that the SiO 2 microparticles were composed of quartz. We examined PrP Sc sorption to four soils (Table S2 ). The Elliot soil was a silty clay loam purchased from the International Humic Substances Society (St. Paul, Minnesota, United States). Organically amended Dodge soil (sandy clay loam) was obtained from a glaciated upland area in Madison, Wisconsin. The Bluestem soil was a sandy clay loam collected from a fluvial deposit in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The Boardman soil was a silt loam taken from an eolian deposit in Boardman, Oregon. Characteristics of these soils are presented in Table S2 . Source of PrP Sc . Syrian hamsters (cared for according to all institutional animal care and handling protocols of the University of Wisconsin, Madison) were experimentally infected with the Hyper strain of hamster-adapted transmissible mink encephalopathy agent. PrP Sc was purified to a P 4 pellet from brains of infected hamsters by a modification of the procedure described by Bolton et al. [42, 43] . The P 4 pellet prepared from four brains was resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4) with 130 mM NaCl. For experiments employing PKtreated PrP Sc , 20% brain homogenate was treated with 50 lg ml À1 of proteinase K for 30 min at 37 8C. After blocking PK activity with 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, purification was performed as above. Batch sorption experiments. Larger prion aggregates were removed from purified PrP Sc by collecting supernatants from two sequential 5-min centrifugations at 800 g (clarification step). Clarified PrP Sc (;0.2 lg) was added to 500 lg of Mte or fine quartz sand, 1,500 lg of Kte, or 3.2 mg of quartz microparticles in 10 mM NaCl buffered to pH 7.0 with 10 mM 3-N-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) (500 ll final volume). In some cases, Mte experiments were conducted in unbuffered 10 mM NaCl. Sorption experiments with Mte performed in buffered and unbuffered 10 mM NaCl yielded comparable results. Experiments with Mte, Kte, and quartz microparticles each employed equivalent (external) mineral surface areas. In sorption experiments with whole soil samples, ;2 lg of clarified PrP Sc was added to 5-ml suspensions of each soil (5 mg) in 5 mM CaCl 2 . Samples were rotated at ambient temperature for 2 h or an indicated time period. Sorption appeared complete within 2 h, as longer incubation times did not result in changes in levels of bound protein. Each PrP Sc -mineral suspension and a 500-ll aliquot of each PrP Scsoil suspension was placed over a 750 mM sucrose cushion prepared in a solution of the same composition as the background solution in the sorption experiment, and centrifuged at 800 g for 7 min to sediment mineral or soil particles and adsorbed PrP Sc . A sucrose cushion was found necessary to prevent a fraction of unbound PrP Sc from sedimenting during centrifugation. Clarified PrP Sc did not sediment through the sucrose cushion ( Figure S1 ). Unbound PrP Sc remaining in the supernatant was precipitated with four volumes of cold methanol and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 10% SDS, 7.5 mM EDTA, 100 mM dithiothreitol, and 30% glycerol). PrP Sc was extracted from pelleted mineral particles with SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 100 8C for 10 min. The same procedure was followed for PrP Sc -soil suspensions. To determine mineral adsorption capacities for prion protein, varying volumes of clarified PrP Sc preparation were added to a 1:100 dilution of each mineral suspension. All adsorption experiments were repeated at least three times. For BH sorption experiments, 10% BH was clarified by collecting supernatants from two sequential 5-min centrifugations at 800 g. Aliquots (10 or 30 ll) of clarified BH were rotated with Mte in 10 mM NaCl at ambient temperature for 2 h; complexes of Mte and BH constituents were then sedimented through a sucrose cushion and processed as described in the preceding paragraphs. All samples prepared for SDS-PAGE were separated on 4%À20% precast gels (BioRad, Hercules, California, United States) under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to polyvinyl difluoride membranes and immunoblotted with mAb 3F4 (1:40,000 dilution), R20 N-terminal pAb (1:10,000 dilution), Rab 9 pool 2 full-length PrP pAb (1:10,000 dilution), or anti-20S proteosome subunit C2 pAb (1 lg ml À1 ; A.G. Scientific, San Diego, California, United States). Detection was achieved with an HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) (BioRad) for mAb 3F4 and an HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (BioRad) for all pAbs. X-ray diffraction analysis. PrP Sc preparation (10 lg) was added to 50 lg of Mte in 10 mM NaCl (final volume of 0.5 ml). Samples were rotated at ambient temperature for 2 h and centrifuged at 16,100 g for 7 min. After centrifugation, the bulk of the supernatant was removed, leaving a small amount of solution above the clay pellet. The clay was resuspended in the remaining supernatant, and the slurry was placed on silica wafer slides and stored in a desiccator for over 12 h. The basal d 001 spacings of near homoionic Na þ -SWy-2 before and after adsorption of PrP Sc were determined by X-ray diffraction on a Scintag PAD V diffractometer (Cupertino, California, United States) using CuKa radiation and continuous scanning from 38 to 158 2h with a step size of 0.028 and a dwell time of 2 s. Extraction experiments. PrP Sc adsorbed to Mte was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 8 M urea or 8 M guanidine HCl (50 ll per pellet), 0.1 or 1 M NaCl (25 ll per pellet), or 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 2.5 or 11.5; 25 ll per pellet). Primary extractions with these solutions were followed by secondary extractions with SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 100 8C to assess the efficacy of the primary extraction. Urea and guanidine primary extracts were dialyzed against double distilled water for 2 h (nominal molecular weight cutoff, 12-14 kDa; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States) prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. Infectivity bioassay. PrP Sc -Mte pellets prepared as above were resuspended in pH 7.4 PBS (50 ll per pellet) and intracerebrally inoculated into male, weanling Syrian hamsters (Harlan, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States). Equivalent amounts of PrP Sc starting material or Mte without PrP Sc were inoculated into control animals. Hamsters were monitored every 3 d for the onset of clinical symptoms [32, 44] . Brains from clinically positive hamsters and uninfected controls were analyzed for protease-resistant PrP by immunoblotting. Figure S1 . Sucrose Cushion Prevented Sedimentation of Unbound PrP Sc under Conditions Necessary to Pellet Soil Minerals A substantial amount of unbound PrP Sc pelleted when centrifuged under conditions required to remove Na þ -Mte from suspension, but was prevented from sedimenting by a sucrose cushion. Sucrose cushions were therefore employed in batch sorption experiments to prevent sedimentation of unbound PrP Sc . Results from representative mock adsorption experiments are shown. PrP Sc was rotated in a solution of 10 mM NaCl in the absence of soil minerals for 2 h and was either placed above a 750 mM sucrose cushion and centrifuged (two right lanes), or centrifuged without a sucrose cushion (two left lanes). Supernatants (Sup) and pellets (Pel) were analyzed by immunoblotting with mAb 3F4. Found at DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.0020032.sg001 (17 KB PDF).
