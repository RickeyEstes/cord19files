Sampling. Samples were collected from broiler flocks in different regions of Bushehr province as mentioned in Table 1 during 2014-2015. These flocks showed respiratory problems such as gasping, sneezing and bronchial rales. A number of 135 tracheal swabs were taken from fifteen flocks (nine swabs per flock). Each three swabs collected from each flock were pooled in one tube and submitted to Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (Tehran, Iran). RNA extraction Viral RNA was extracted from the directly pooled tracheal swabs in RLT buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and 10 μL 2-mercaptoethanol (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) per 1 mL buffer using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription The reverse transcriptation (RT) reaction was performed using ReverAid™ first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific, Burlington, Canada), according to the product manual. The resultant cDNA was immediately used in a PCR or stored at -20 ˚C for later use. Amplification of the spike gene Nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using spike gene primers as described previously to amplify 392 bp fragment of the spike gene. 30 The first round of amplification (495 bp) was performed using SX1 (5ʹ-CACCTAGAGGTTTGT/CTA/TGCAT-´3) and SX2 (5ʹ-TCCACCTCTATAAACACCC/TTT-´3) primers. The PCR reaction was performed in 25 μL reaction mixture containing 1 μL dNTP (10 mM), 0.50 μL of each primer (25 pmol μL -1 ), 1 μL MgCl2 (50 mM), 2.50 μL 10X PCR buffer, 0.20 μL Taq DNA Polymerase, 2.50 μL cDNA and 16.80 μL dH2O (all from SinaClon, Tehran, Iran). The amplification was performed using 35 thermal cycles including 94 ˚C for 30 sec, 58 ˚C for 30 sec, and 72 ˚C for 30 sec. The PCR product was used as template for the second round of amplification in which SX3 (5´-TAATACTGGC/TAATTT TTCAGA-´3), and SX4 (5ʹ´AATACAGATTGCT TACAACCACC-3) primers were used. The PCR reaction was carried out under the above condition. Agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel and visualized by staining with 0.50 μg mL -1 ethidium bromide by UV transilluminator (M-15; UVP, Upland, USA). PCR product purification. The PCR products were purified using PCR purification Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to kit's manufacture instructions. Nucleotide sequencing, deduced amino acid analysis and phylogenetic tree. Purified RT-PCR products were sequenced by ABI Prism BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) in a forward direction using primer SX3 and in a reverse direction using primer RX4. Nucleotide sequence of the PCR product (392 bp), which was submitted to NCBI, were compared with the IBV sequences in GenBank database and sequence similarities were analyzed by BLAST. Multiple sequence alignments were carried out with Clustal W and phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA software (version 5; Biodesign Institute, Tempe, USA) using the Neighbor-joining tree method with 1000 bootstrap. 31 GenBank accession number of IBV sequence. The partial S1 gene sequences of IBVs were submitted to the GenBank database under accession numbers KX578825-KX578834.
