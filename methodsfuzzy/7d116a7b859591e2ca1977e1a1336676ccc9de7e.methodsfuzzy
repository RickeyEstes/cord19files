Mice. Female C57BL/6 mice (7-8 weeks) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (L'Arbresle, France). All experiments were performed in accordance with the Swiss Veterinary Office for animal experimentation. Patients. Serum samples were collected from 14 patients with sHLH (age at onset, 8.6 years; interquartile range [IQR], 4.1-12.9 years; and female 36%), seen at the Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Ges u, Italy. All patients met the 2004-HLH diagnostic guidelines: 7 patients met 5 and 7 patients met 4 criteria. It should be noted that levels of sCD25 in U/mL were not available as the test is not performed routinely in the institution where these patients were recruited. Primary HLH was excluded based on the absence of family history, absence of mutations in the genes known to cause HLH, and presence of normal functional studies (including NK activity, perforin expression, and CD107 degranulation assay). An underlying infection was demonstrated in 7 patients (Ebstein-Barr virus in 2, cytomegalovirus in 1, rotavirus in 1, human herpes virus 6 in 1, propionibacteria sepsis in 1, and morganella morganii osteomyelitis in 1). Serum samples were obtained during active disease at presentation (n 5 11) and after were injected with 50 mg of CpG-ODN at days 0, 2, 4, 7, and 9 (gray filled triangles). Body and spleen weights were monitored, and blood parameters including lymphocyte, platelet, and red blood cell counts were measured using a hemavet analyzer. Ferritin serum concentrations were measured by ELISA. On days when CpG-ODN was administered, samples were collected 6 hours after injection. Values are the mean 6 standard error of the mean. Data are representative of 2 experiments. Statistics were performed between the indicated time point and the baseline (ie, at day 21) values. *P , 0.05, **P , 0.01, and ***P , 0.001 were obtained using the 1-tailed nonparametric Mann-Whitney U t test. sHLH, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. (11 patients) . Multiple samples were available from most patients and were used for the analysis of correlations. Laboratory features, including neutrophil and platelet blood count, levels of ferritin, alanine transaminase, and lactate dehydrogenase at time of sampling were collected in a database. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from parents or patients as appropriate. TLR9-mediated sHLH in mice. sHLH was induced as previously described. 16 In brief, C57BL/6 female mice were injected intraperitoneally on days 0, 2, 4, 7, and 9 with 50 mg of CpG-ODN 1826 (Invivogen). At each indicated time point, mice were euthanized by CO 2 inhalation. Body and spleen weights were recorded. Peripheral blood was collected in Microtainer BD tubes containing EDTA anticoagulant (Becton Dickinson). A complete blood count was performed on a Hemavet analyzer (Hematology Analyzer [950FS], Drew Scientific). Antibodies for in vivo use. Anti-mouse IFNg (mIFNg) neutralizing mAb (XMG1.2) and rat IgG1 isotypematched control mAb (mAb35) were produced and purified at NovImmune from hybridoma culture supernatants or were purchased from BioXCell. Antibodies were injected intravenously at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Measurement of serum cytokines, chemokines, and ferritin levels. Mouse and human cytokine and chemokine levels were determined using MILLIPLEX MAP multiplex immunodetection kits (Millipore) and analyzed on the Luminex instrument. Ferritin concentrations were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (ALPCO Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of total mIFNg. An ELISA-based assay was developed and adapted from the method described by Finkelman and Morris, 32 to allow for the quantification of total IFNg (free and bound to XMG1.2). Differing XMG1.2:IFNg ratios present in the serum samples (found at various time points) significantly affected assay performance. Thus, a procedural modification was required to compensate for this variability, which included the addition of an excess of XMG1.2 (100 mg/mL) to the samples ex vivo. This step ensured the stability of the mAbcytokine complex allowing for a more precise quantification of the total IFNg. Briefly, MaxiSorp 96well plates (Nunc) were coated with an anti-mIFNg mAb (1 mg/mL, AN-18, BD Biosciences). Serum samples were added to each well. mIFNg was then detected using biotin-conjugated anti-mIFNg mAb (8 ng/mL, R4-6A2, BD Biosciences), Peroxidase-Streptavidin (JacksonImmunoResearch), and Tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sigma-Aldrich). Optical density was read at 450 nm using Epoch microplate reader (BioTek), and data were analyzed with Gen5 software. Gene expression. Total RNA from spleen and liver was extracted with the RNeasy mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed by using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed in triplicates using SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences were generated using Primer Express software version 3.0 (Applied Biosystems). Sequences primers are: b-actin, forward: AGCCTTCCTTCTTGGGTATGG and reverse: CAA CGTCACACTTCATGATG GAAT; IFNg, forward: CAACAGCAAGGCGAA AAA GG and reverse: CCTGTGGGTTGTTGA CCTCAA; CXCL9, forward: TGCACGATGCTCCTGCA and reverse: AGGTCT TTGAGGGATTT GTAGTGG; CXCL10, forward: GACGGTCCGCTGCAACTG and reverse: GCTT CCCTATGG CCCTCATT; MHCII transactivator (CIITA) form pIV, forward: CATGCAGGCAGCACT CAGAA and reverse: ATCCAT GGTGGCACACA GACT; IL-6: forward, TCGGAGGCTTAATTACAC ATGTTC and reverse: TGCCATTGCACAACTC TTTTCT; and TNFa, forward: GCCACCACG CTCTTCTGTCT and reverse: GGTCTGGGCCATA GAACTGATG. The relative expression levels were calculated as 2^( Ct gene2Ct b-actin) with b-actin RNA as the endogenous control. line), on days 1, 3, and 6 (black filled triangles). Livers were obtained to evaluate CIITA pIV mRNA, an IFNginducible gene, by qPCR (B) IL-6 and TNFa serum concentrations were quantified in a multiplex assay using the Luminex technology (C). Quantification of tissue-derived cytokine mRNA was evaluated by qPCR from the liver (D) and the spleen (E). The samples from day 0 were collected before the CpG-ODN injection, whereas samples from day 4 and day 7 were collected 6 hours after CpG-ODN injection. Samples from the day of a mAb administration were collected before the injection. Values are the mean 6 SEM. Data are representative of 2 experiments. Statistics were performed to compare the values at each time point between isotype control and XMG1.2 treated groups. *P , 0.05, **P , 0.01, and ***P , 0.001 were obtained using the 1-tailed nonparametric Mann-Whitney U t test. IFNg, interferon g; IL-6, interleukin 6; TNFa, tumor necrosis factor a; mRNA, messenger RNA; qPCR, quantitative PCR. Histology. Livers were fixed overnight in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich), rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin (Leica Microsystems). Sections were stained with hemalun and eosin (VWR) and analyzed for cell infiltration by calculating the area that contained foci of leucocytes infiltration using ImageJ software (NIH). Statistical analysis. GraphPad Prism 6 was used for all statistical analysis. The 1-tailed nonparametric Mann-Whitney U t test was used for statistical comparisons between 2 groups. Data are expressed as mean 6 standard error of the mean. All statistical tests have been indicated in the figure legends. P values of #0.05 were considered significant. When indicated, statistical analysis was performed using the Spearman test.
