We We collected data regarding patient gas exchanges by performing several blood gas analysis during the different steps of WLL. We expressed data as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Results Figure 95 shows the mean values of PaO 2 during the different phases of WLL. During bipulmonary ventilation gas exchanges improved in response to FiO 2 1 and PEEP. Monopulmonary ventilation, instead, induced a clear reduction of PaO 2 , which increased in lateral position and during liquid tidal ventilation, with a substantial effect of elevated hydrostatic lavage pressures. The wide SD indicates an uneven response of gas exchanges in the studied population. Comparative, cross-sectional study. A convenience sample of ICU registered nurses (RN) and nurse aides (NA) from a teaching hospital in Santiago, Chile was obtained. Three questionnaires were used for data collection: i.) A sociodemographic questionnaire, ii.) Spanish short version of Effort-Reward Imbalance questionnaire by Siegrist, an ERI > 1 indicated an imbalance between efforts and rewards , and iii.) Maslach Burnout Inventory, including their 3 subscales: emotional exhaustion (EE), personal accomplishment (PA) and depersonalization (DP). A p-value < 0.1 was considered. We analyzed data from our prospective registry of OHCA patients admitted between January 2000 and December 2014. Initial diagnostic strategy included coronary angiography, brain and chest CT scan. This was completed by an extensive diagnostic strategy, encompassing biological and toxicological tests, repeated electrocardiograms and echocardiography, MRI, Holter monitoring and endocavitary explorations. Two independent investigators reviewed each final diagnosis. Baseline characteristics were compared between subgroups of patients with chi-square test and Mann-Whitney test, as appropriate. One-year mortality was compared between subgroups using univariate Kaplan-Meier curves. It was a prospective, observation al study at the teaching department of emergency and intensive care in the regional hospital of Zaghouan, including patients with severe dyspnea over six months. All patients underwent physical examination, 12-lead ECG, RX Thorax, NT-ProBNP essay and echocardiography by an attending cardiologist on admission. Note: This abstract has been previously published and is available at [1] . It is included here as a complete record of the abstracts from the conference. The study has summarized all the patients that have been treated with the oxygen therapy treatment between May 2013-October 2015. The reviewed data has been: SOFA, APACHE II, SAPS II, tabulated diagnosis, etiology of the respiratory failure, length of stay, use of high flow before or after the intubation, evaluate if the intubation has been avoided, mortality and mortality in 30 days. Applying non parametrical test the group of patients that needs mechanical ventilation has a higher mortality (p < 0, 0001) Conclusions The use of high flow therapy has changed the attitude towards the patients with insufficiency respiratory diseases avoiding in many cases the use of mechanical ventilation. More controlled studies are needed showing which other patients can be beneficed by the high flow therapy to prevent the delays in the start of mechanical ventilation. Introduction Complex factors in ICU survivors such as health literacy, socioeconomic status and social environment may be predictive of adverse outcomes following hospital discharge but are not well studied. Objectives We hypothesized that Medicaid Insurance, a proxy for individual low socioeconomic status, would be associated with increased hospital readmission rates following hospital discharge. Introduction Prolonged hospital stay prior to admission to the intensive care unit has been shown to be independently associated with poorer outcome (1, 2) . Even a few hour delay in transfer from emergency department to intensive care worsens outcome (3). This may relate to an ongoing deterioration of physiological function while in hospital, potentially influenced by the process or disease state that culminates in admission to critical care. We investigated whether common illness severity scores e.g. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) or Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC), are significantly different in patients admitted after a prolonged ward stay. We describe mortality and ICU / hospital length of stay in said patients, in an order to elucidate predictors for outcome. Objectives Show higher length of stay before ICU admission as an independent predictor of outcome · Identify whether ICU scoring systems predict outcome in our population · Identify whether serum albumin or other surrogate marker of frailty (e.g. Creatinine) can help predict outcome? Methods Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of all admissions in ICNARC database to 44 bed adult critical care unit in University Associated London Major Trauma Centre over two-year period (1 st January 2013 -31 st December 2014). Demographic data, APACHE II, ICNARC score, ICU mortality, and length of stay on ward preceding ICU, within ICU and overall hospital length of stay were collected. Data was analyzed using ANOVA tests, according to preceding ward length of stay. RESULTS. n = 4340 Mean APACHE 2 score for all admissions was 14.88 (sd 7.0) P < 0.01 ANOVA comparing Length of ICU stay between 0-7 and >28 days. P < 0.01 ANOVA comparing APACHE2 across all ward LOS groups. P < 0.01 ANOVA comparing serum albumin across ward LOS 0-7 days vs >28 days, and non significant across other groups. Conclusions Prolonged pre-ICU hospital admission is associated with longer ICU and hospital admission and generally higher ICU mortality. APACHE2 scoring and serum albumin predict outcome. were not significantly different between in-house and retrieved cases. Predicted hospital survival for SAVE score risk class IV (score -9 to -5) and class III (score -4 to 0) were 30 % and 18 % respectively. For in-house ECMO patients, higher proportions of non-infective aetiologies for VV-ECMO (RESP score) and post-MI cariogenic shock for VA-ECMO were observed. These conditions have poorer prognosis and lower reversibility, which may account for the poorer RESP/SAVE scores (though statistically insignificant) and higher predicted and observed mortality. Conclusions Our findings did not show a statistically significant difference in ICU mortality rate between in-house and retrieval ECMO groups. Inter-hospital ECMO retrieval is feasible for further development. The RESP score and SAVE score systems provides a tool for monitoring of our centre´s performance in comparison to ECMO centres worldwide. Introduction The outcome in critically ill patients regarded with prognosis has many background effects of risk factors. An aging population and chronic diseases may also result in an increased number of patients in intensive care unit (ICU). Clinical results have revealed the need for outcome examination and guidance on the effective use of ICU. Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate mortality among patients in Turkish ICUs. Regarding this, the present study analyzed APACHE II databases in critically ill patients at secondary and tertiary referral hospital ICUs in Turkey. Methods During the study period, clinical data that were collected concurrently for each patient contained demographic details, diagnostic category leading to ICU admission and APACHE II scores following ICU admission. Patients were followed up during ICU stay. The equation coefficients for APACHE II were supplied by APACHE Medical Systems. The mortality in intensive care units was analyzed according to APACHE II scores. The other attempts performed during ICU stay were also recorded. Results 13.313 patients were enrolled in this study. The 69.9 % of patients were > 60 years old and 53.8 % of them were male. The mean APACHE II score was 21.49. The ICU's mortality rate was 44.5 %. The mechanical ventilation was determined as the most performed attempt in ICU's with a ratio of 55.9 %. The ratio of central venous catheterization was found 53.5 %. The ratios of systemic infection and antibiotic administration were 63.6 % and 80.7 %, respectively. Conclusion In the present study, the patients hospitalized in ICU's of ministry, university, and private hospitals were analyzed all over Turkey. Early identification of patients at risk, both before admission and after discharge from ICU, may allow to prevent some of the physiologic abnormalities contributing to the APACHE II score. There was a wide difference in outcome for patients admitted to different ICU's by using risk adjustment methods. Introduction Growing interest in the long-term effects after critical care has formed investigator-led clinical research groups around the world. Work aiming at standardizing core outcome measures and instruments for randomized clinical trials is ongoing. Whether these outcome measures reflect the domains most valued by patients or if important issues are missing from the existing scales is unclear. Commonly used tools like SF-36 and EQ-5D are too unspecific. Objectives To develop and validate a questionnaire for patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) after critical care. Methods During a 24-months qualitative phase, 35 former ICU-patients were interviewed in a semi-structured way, providing detailed information on symptoms and difficulties in all areas of everyday life. Patients were recruited from the post-ICU clinic at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, covering both urban and rural areas. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and issues were categorized into 13 hypothesized domains: cognitive, executive/fatigue, physical health, pain, mental health, daily activities, sleep, food/drink/smoking, sexuality, hearing/visual/dysphagia, intestinal and urinary problems, and return to work/financial situation. After searching the literature and commonly used assessment tools, additional issues were included. All issues were then rephrased into questions, with care taken to maintain only one conceptual entity per question, and with the recall period usually being the last month. Adequate scales for frequency, intensity and duration were used. All questions were validated face-to-face with another set of former ICUpatients and with non-ICU-treated controls to make sure the wording was easily understood and neither confusing nor upsetting.
