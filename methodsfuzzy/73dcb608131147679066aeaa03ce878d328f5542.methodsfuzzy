Viruses and mice MHV3 cultivated and titled by plaque assay on L929 cells at 37 8C were cloned by limiting dilution. One plaque was selected and amplified on L929 cells to serve as the inoculum for future stock (Martin et al., 1988) , in order to limit spontaneous mutations. Aliquots containing 2 Â 10 5 PFU/ml were stored at À 80 o C and used in the experiments. MHV4 and MHVA59 strains were also cultivated and titled by plaque assay on L929 cells and stored in aliquots with 1 to 5 Â 10 5 PFU/ml at À 80 o C. Short-wave ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was used to inactivate the previously titled MHV3 stocks (uvMHV3), and was accomplished by exposing a thin layer of virus in a glass Petri dish within an ice bath to a GTE 30W germicidal lamp, at a distance of 15 cm for 10 minutes (Hanson, 1983) . Each virus preparation submitted to inactivation was assayed by intraperitoneal (ip) inoculation in susceptible BALB/c mice, which were observed daily for mortality. High and low antibody responder mice of both sexes from Selection III (H III and L III ), obtained by selective breeding based on responsiveness to flagellar antigen of Salmonellae (Siqueira et al., 1976) , were used at ages ranging from 8 to 12 weeks. Reciprocal interline crosses of (H III Â L III ) F 1 hybrids, F 2 segregants and backcrosses (BcH III and BcL III ) were bred in the animal unit of the Laborato ¬ rio de Imunogene ¬tica, Instituto Butantan. Animals were periodically sacrificed and peritoneal exudate, serum and liver tissue samples obtained. No animal was found to have MHV in the liver or in the peritoneal exudate. However, all the animals had antibodies against MHV. The antibodies against MHV were shown to express neutralizing activity as measured by the in vitro MHV3 neutralization assay (Vassa ƒ o et al., 1994b) . The laboratories involved in the work have ethical approval for animal experimentation.
