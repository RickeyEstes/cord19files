Using different test gases and a multiple breath approach (i.e. steady state method), the rebreathing system permitted the simultaneous measurement of two additional pulmonary function variables. The functional residual capacity (FRC) of the lungs was measured by the helium (He) dilution technique (washin). The transfer factor of the lungs for carbon monoxide (TL CO) was determined in order to evaluate the transfer of oxygen from the lungs into the blood. For assessing both FRC and TL CO, each pig inhaled the test gas mixture (9% He, 0.25% CO in synthetic air) from a reservoir bag. Since animals were growing, the volume filled in the reservoir bag was 4 L in the pre-challenge period and was adjusted for the increasing lung volume with growth to 5 L from 2 to 18 dpi. The time to perform this test (i.e. rebreathing time) increased from 91 ± 17 s (mean ± SD) 1 week before challenge (body weight of 17 ± 1 kg, mean ± SD) to 116 ± 16 s at 18 dpi (body weight of 32 ± 2 kg) due to a significant correlation with increasing body weight (r = 0.25; R 2 = 6.28%; P = 0.003) or increasing FRC (r = 0.29; R 2 = 8.26%; P = 0.0005), respectively. FRC was calculated per kg body weight (FRC/kg) to avoid body weight being a confounding factor. Data for TL CO were corrected for the individual concentration of haemoglobin in the blood (TL CO Hb ), as determined before each PFT using a haemoxymeter that allows species-specific analysis of haemoglobin fractions for pigs (OSM3, Radiometer). To correct for body weight and metabolism, TL CO Hb was calculated per kg body weight (TL CO Hb /kg), as well as per kg metabolic body weight (TL CO Hb /kg 0.75 ).
