Literature addressing the chosen research method for this study included participatory observation and action research. These approaches were adopted by social scientists and practitioners to link research with actual practice (Poole and Van De Ven, 2004) . Researchers and practitioner's partner to collect data about what was happening in the organization system, diagnose the situation and take action and evaluate the results (Argyris et al., 1990) . The primary target of change was focused on changing individuals or groups at the exclusion of whole systems. Interventions focused on team building, and personal development. And then in the 1980s the pace of change accelerated and global competition, turbulent markets and technological advancements caused organizations to make radical changes to their business models and strategies (Poole and Van De Ven, 2004) . Large-scale interventions, with a focus on creating a preferred future, enable change practitioners to bring together the stakeholders of a system to join around important organizational challenges (Coghlan and Brannick, 2002) . Large-scale change interventions are powerful because they are effective in aligning large groups in a common direction and they reduce the amount of time needed for change. Dannemiller and Jacobs (Dannemiller and Jacobs, 1992) furthered work in the area of large-scale change to addressing the influence of the growth of technology in business. French and Bell's (1978) definition of organizational change focused on the target of the change and specific intervention. Their focus was on strategic issues and the way in which the conceptual, strategic and practical levels of the organization system fit together. Porras and Robertson (1987) developed an organizational development theory that helped explain the ongoing tension between the theory of change and the practice of changing. Their contribution of implementation theory focuses on the intervention activities needed to execute effective planned change. In summary, early change interventions focused on helping organizations get better through people; approaches evolved and focused attention on transformational change to explore how external events, trends and developments drive the need for new strategies, structures, and norms. While more recent organizational change approaches focus on transformational change, they are based on the assumption that the past has value (Gareis, 2009) . Organizational change and change management initiatives have revealed in more recent times a move from problem-centered, discrete interventions (Oswick et al., 2005) to a focus on continuous improvements, such as organizational learning and knowledge management (Gareis, 2009) .
