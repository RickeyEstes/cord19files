We studied 51 CCHF patients who were admitted to Ankara Numune Education and Research Hospital (ANERH) during the spring and summer of 2006. Suspected patients for CCHF were defined as the cases with clinical symptoms and signs of CCHF such as fever, myalgia, malaise, and bleeding, and also the history of tick bite or inhabit (or travel to) endemic region. Diagnosis of all patients in the study group was confirmed with elevated IgM antibodies and/or viral RNA by RT-PCR. Blood samples of suspected cases were collected on admission to hospital for IgM antibodies and RT-PCR test of CCHF virus. The IgM antibodies were detected by using ELISA at Refik Saydam Hygiene Center of Ankara, Turkey. TaqMan-based one-step RT-PCR assay was used for detection of CCHF virus RNA. 14 The assay was performed in a PerkineElmer 7700 Sequence Detection System by using the combination of reverse-transcriptase (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) and hot start Taq DNA polymerase (Birion GmBH, Munchen, Germany) enzymes. All of the manipulations were performed in a biosafety class II cabinet. Age, sex, duration of symptoms, presence of fever, myalgia, bleeding, tick bite, platelet count, WBC, ALT, AST, LDH, CK levels, aPTT and international normalized ratio (INR) on the first day of hospitalization were recorded for all patients. Sera collected on the first day and last day (exitus day for fatal CCHF or discharge day for nonfatal CCHF) of hospitalization for each patient were analyzed in the study. All sera were collected in tubes covered with tin foil. Then they were stored at Ã€80 C until analysis. Serum neopterin concentration was measured with a high-performance liquid chromatography device (HewlettePackard 1050, USA) using a fluorometry detector, as defined by Alrashed et al. 15 The results were calculated as nmol/L. The serum levels of neopterin on the first day of hospitalization in CCHF patients were compared with the serum levels of neopterin of healthy controls (n Z 30). We also compared serum neopterin levels and other clinicale laboratory parameters for two groups (patients with fatal and nonfatal CCHF).
