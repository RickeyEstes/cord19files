Construct, expression, and purification of PLPs for the ISG15 protease activity assay and ITC MHV PLP2 was expressed and purified as previously described [10, 24] . SARS-CoV PLpro in expression vector pET21a and MERS-CoV PLpro in pET15b were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) competent cells (New England Biolabs) Fig. 9 . (a) SARS-CoV PLpro (reddish orange) from the ChISG15-bound structure with full-length human (green, PDB entry: 1Z2M) overlaid with full-length human based off of a secondary alignment using Ub (light gray, PDB entry: 4MM3). The distance between the two overlaid, full-length human structures is measured in Å and is indicated by a blue dashed line. For all figures, the highlighted yellow portion demonstrates the secondary binding site ridgeline. (b) SARS-CoV PLpro (gold) from the CmISG15-bound structure with full-length human (green, PDB entry: 1Z2M) based off of a secondary structure alignment using ChISG15. (c) Closeup overlay of the secondary binding site helix from SARS-CoV PLpro (gold) from the CmISG15-bound structure, SARS-CoV PLpro (reddish orange) from the ChISG15-bound structure, and SARS-CoV PLpro (dark gray, PDB entry: 5E6J) from the K48 di-Ub-bound structure. The distance between the helix from SARS-CoV PLpro (gold) from the CmISG15-bound structure and the helix from SARS-CoV PLpro (reddish orange) from the ChISG15-bound structure is measured in Å and is indicated by a blue dashed line. (d) SARS-CoV PLpro (reddish orange) from the ChISG15-bound structure with full-length human (green, PDB entry: 1Z2M) overlayed with K48 di-Ub (dark brown, PDB entry: 5E6J) both based off of a secondary alignment using ChISG15. (e) SARS-CoV PLpro (gold) from the CmISG15-bound structure with full-length mouse overlaid with full-length human (green, PDB entry: 1Z2M) both based off a secondary structure alignment using CmISG15. by heat shock. Cells were grown at 37°C in LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/mL of ampicillin to OD 600 of 0.6-0.8, and expression was induced with 0.8 mM IPTG at 25°C overnight for SARS-CoV PLpro and 1 mM IPTG at 18°C overnight for MERS-CoV PLpro. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000g for 10 min and stored at − 80°C. Cells were lysed in Buffer A [20 mM Tris (pH 7.5 for SARS-CoV PLpro and pH 7.0 for MERS-CoV PLpro), 500 mM NaCl, and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol (BME)] supplemented with lysozyme for 30 min at 4°C, followed by sonication on ice at 50% power with a 50% duty cycle for a total of 6 min. Insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation at 70,600g for 30 min and the supernatant filtered through a 0.8-μm filter. The clarified supernatant was flowed over high density nickel agarose beads (Gold Biotechnology, Olivette, MO) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer A supplemented with 30 mM imidazole, and the protein was eluted with 10 column volumes of Buffer A supplemented with 300 mM imidazole. The PLpro was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) pre-equilibrated with 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM Hepes (pH 7.5 for SARS-CoV PLpro and pH 7.0 for MERS-CoV PLpro), and 2 mM DTT.
