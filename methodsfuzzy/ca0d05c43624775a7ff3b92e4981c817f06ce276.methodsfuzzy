Owing to the complexity involved in adopting esignature, an expert panel was formed to guide the research process. The expert panel includes two medical informatics consultants and two experts with experience in the field. The medical informatics consultants have extensive consulting experience and background with esignature and are professors in the medical informatics department of a national university in Taiwan. The other two experts played major roles in the government esignature planning and promoting project, and consequently they have accumulated comprehensive experience in this subject area. The expert panel helps us determine the appropriateness of the research framework, check the completeness and suitability of the questionnaire, and offer guidance for the research progress whenever there is a need. Questionnaires were mailed out to the executives and directors of the information departments of 86 hospitals to collect the needed information. Finally, a discriminant analysis was conducted to distinguish between those hospitals that adopted e-signature and those that did not.
