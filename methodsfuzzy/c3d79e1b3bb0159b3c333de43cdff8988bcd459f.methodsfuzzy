As there were large differences in the ability of each method to infer cross-type edges, we next compared how much edge overlap there was between methods. Using networks of 5000 edges from each method we determined the overlap of identical edges between networks. Networks were compared using the Jaccard similarity of edges (the ratio of intersection of edges/union of edges). Fig 3 shows the similarity of all network pairs of the 10 inference methods we tested, with green representing higher Jaccard similarity and red lower similarity. The composition of the GENIE3 network was closest to networks made using CLR from the MINET package and the original CLR algorithm using resampling (Methods). The Jaccard similarity of edges with several different methods and edge cutoffs were chosen so that all networks of a particular letter are the same size across inference methods. The number of Cross-type edges for each network is shown on the y-axis and the methods on the x-axis. CLR_O_RS indicates the original CLR algorithm with resampling to distinguish it from the version of CLR used in the MINET package. The ARACNE method removes edges of low association as part of its methodology and thus only smaller networks containing high scoring edges are retained with ARACNE. (B) The fold increase in Cross-type edges inferred by the GENIE3 method compared to the MINET method (the next best method at creating Cross-type edges) is shown. For networks F and G MINET did not draw any Cross-type edges and so these ratios are not displayed. Integrated multi-omic networks comparing GENIE3 to these methods was 0.174 and 0.184 respectively. When examining the pattern of overlap between other algorithm pairs, two additional clusters emerge. The MRNET, MINET, and ARACNE methods from the MINET package cluster together showing Jaccard similarity of approximately 0.42. Clustering with PCC is the Spearman correlation coefficient and two other methods from the MINET package, MIM and MRNETB, the average Jaccard similarity between these methods being 0.612. There are several clusters of methods that produce similar networks, but GENIE3 produces networks that have more unique edges distinct from networks produced by the other methods. Therefore, GENIE3 is able to detect cross-platform relationships that are not detected by other methods. The above data shows that GENIE3 is the best method for creating integrated networks when using data from in vitro cell culture infections. We next wanted to see if this advantage held with other datasets drawn from different experimental setups and with other kinds of-omics data, namely lipidomics. To do so we tested other datasets with GENIE3 as well as MINET and CLR. We first tested another experiment looking at a different strain of Dengue virus (DENV1) infecting the same cell type (U937). This experiment not only included transcriptomic data and proteomic data, as the DENV4 experiment used above did, but also lipidomic data. When looking at edges linking transcripts and proteins in this new dataset GENIE3 was again the highest performer, identifying 81 and 177 cross-type edges in 2500 edge and 5000 edge transcript-protein networks respectively compared to only 1 and 8 edges for CLR and only 1 edge in each network for MINET (S5 Fig). As this data included lipidomic data we next looked at cross-type edges in a network comprised of transcripts and lipids, here GENIE3 again performed the best, identifying 15 and 34 cross-type edges in 2500 edge and 5000 edge transcript-lipid networks respectively compared to only 1 and 13 for CLR and 3 and 14 for MINET (S5 Fig). Finally, we also looked at a network comprised of proteins and lipids. Here, the advantages of GENIE3 are not as apparent, MINET performs slightly better, though both are better than CLR. GENIE was able to infer 53 and 166 edges compared to 62 and 188 edges for MINET (CLR inferred 2 and 28 edges) (S5 Fig). We next examined other datasets that were different from infection of cells with a virus in vitro. We examined two datasets looking at in vivo infection of mice with influenza virus. With both of these datasets GENIE3 was again, by far, the best method for inferring cross type edges (S6 Fig). In addition, we examined both of these datasets specifically looking at the functional edge overlap of cross-type edges. We found, similar to our analysis of Dengue data (Fig 5B) , that the functional edge overlap of cross-type edges from networks of this influenza data are significantly higher than that seen in a randomized network (S7 Fig). The fact that we see this across multiple datasets from very different experiments (human vs. mouse, in vitro vs. in vivo, various pathogens, etc.) indicates cross-type edges contain biologically relevant data and that this is true across multiple disparate datasets. We also examined another mouse dataset looking at in vivo infection with West Nile Virus (WNV). Again, with this dataset GENIE3 was the best at inferring cross-type edges (S6 Fig). Finally, we also examined a dataset comprised of transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of ovarian cancer tumors [22] . Here, each tumor represented a unique condition and we chose the 2000 random proteins with the highest variability across tumor samples based on standard deviation. We then combined this dataset with the cognate transcripts matching these proteins for which we had data (a total of 1641 transcripts). With this dataset we found that, across network sizes, there was no significant advantage in using GENIE3, CLR, or MINET regarding crosstype edges. With very large networks (200000 edges) GENIE3 was very similar to MINET and both were slightly superior to CLR. With the smallest network examined (2500 edges) CLR and MINET were slightly superior to GENIE3 with MINET and CLR each inferring about~500 cross-type edges for this network compared to 347 for GENIE3 (S6 Fig). There were also far more cross-type edges inferred with this data set with~22% of edges linking a protein and a transcript when examining large networks (200000 edges) and~7% when examining small (5000-2500 edges) networks. While this may have been affected by including a large number of protein-transcript cognate pairs from the same gene, a similar analysis using 2000 random proteins and 2000 random transcripts also found a higher number of cross-type edges,~20%. This is in contrast to networks examining Dengue infection where only~3% of the edges were crosstype in a large network inferred with GENIE3 and~5% were cross-type in a small network.
