Ethics statement. In Sample collection. In the Sichuan province of China in 2016, 26 nursery piglets aged 1 to 2 months were collected from 11 intensive commercial farms where acute respiratory disease had broken out. Animals that exhibited the clinical signs of acute respiratory disease (i.e., fever, rhinorrhoea, cough, laboured breathing, depression and ocular discharge) were considered to be PRDC cases after assessment by a veterinarian. The piglets were adequately sedated with azaperone (Melone Biotechnology, Dalian, China) to avoid distress. The pathological alterations observed during necropsy in the lungs included diffuse bleeding, cyanotic appearance, interstitial thickening, swelling, and hyperemia. Prior to testing, the nasal swab samples from the piglets were placed into viral transport medium (VTM) at −80 °C. Serum and lung samples were stored at −80 °C before they were tested.
