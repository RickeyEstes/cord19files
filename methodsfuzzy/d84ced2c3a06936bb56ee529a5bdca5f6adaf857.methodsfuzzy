Animals and grouping. A total of 44 healthy Chinese adult rabbits (age, 3.5±0.4 months; 2.5±0.5 kg; half male and half female; provided by Animal Center of Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, China) were bred in individual cages (20-30˚C; 30-70% humidity, 12 h: 12-h light-dark cycle; free access to feed and water). The present study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The animal use protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Soochow University (Suzhou, China). Rabbits were randomly divided into three groups. Group A (n=15), the model group, was injected with 10 µg/kg LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4; 10 mg; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) through the ear vein, and 20 mg/kg MPS (500 mg/bottle; H20060052; Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY, USA) into the right gluteus 24 h later, for a total of three times with a 24-h interval between injections. Group B (n=15), the treatment group, was prepared using the same protocol as the model group, followed by oral administration of LEV (0.4 g/kg/day; Shanghai Fuda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) immediately after modeling. Group C (n=14), the control group, was injected with the same volume of normal saline in the same manner and at the same time points as the above two groups. During the experiment, all rabbits were injected with penicillin (800,000 U/per rabbit, twice per week; Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Harbin, China) in order to prevent infection. Following imaging observation, seven rabbits from each group were sacrificed via air embolism at the 6th-and 8th-week of the experiment for subsequent analysis. Imaging observation. Prior to sacrifice, 10% chloral hydrate (volume fraction) anesthesia was intraperitoneally injected into the rabbits, and dual-hip X-ray (V-5000; Phillips Healthcare, DA Best, The Netherlands) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (0.2T E-Scan; Esaote Europe BV, Cambridge, UK) were performed to observe whether there patchy density-reduced shadows were present in the X-ray images of the rabbit femoral head area. During MRI examination, rabbits were placed in the supine position, with their lower leg flexed and fixed with tape. Using a knee coil, conventional SE sequence T1-weighted imaging was performed [repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)=490/14 msec], in addition to T2-weighted imaging (TR/TE=2632/96 msec), with no interval and the following parameters: Matrix, 128x256; vision, 14x14 cm; thickness, 3 mm. T1-weighted images demonstrated spotty, thin-thread and patchy low signals, and T2-weighted images showed spotty, thin-thread or patchy low or high signals, which were considered to indicate femoral head necrosis. Histopathologic examination. Six or eight weeks later, the rabbits of the three groups were sacrificed via air embolism, then their bilateral femoral heads were harvested, split in half along the central coronal plane, placed in 10% neutral formalin solution for 24-h fixation and decalcified in 5% dilute nitric acid for one week. Following dehydration in an alcohol series the femoral heads were embedded in paraffin, cut into 4-µm-thick slices, dewaxed and hydrated prior to staining with hematoxylin for 5 min. Following staining, the slices were hydrated for 10 min, eosin-stained for 2 min, dehydrated, hyalinized and turpentine-mounted before the bone trabecular structure and changes in the bone cells and bone marrow fats were observed under a light microscope. Femoral head necrosis was determined according to the pathological features of empty bone lacuna numbers and surrounding necrotic bone marrow tissues. Any region in the slice that was found to exhibit one sign of osteonecrosis was considered to be positive for SANFH. Pathological changes in bone cellular necrosis were expressed as the percentage of empty bone lacunae. At x100 magnification in 10 randomly selected high-power fields, the number of empty bone lacunae out of 50 bone lacunae in each field were counted to calculate the percentage of empty bone lacunae. Detection of cellular apoptosis. Paraffinized sections of the femoral head were used to study cellular apoptosis using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) kit (KGA703; KGI Biological Technology Development Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China), with 3,3'-daminobenzidine staining. Observed under the microscope, the nucleus was stained as tan or brown and set as the positive result. Five fields were randomly selected under x400 magnification for observation, the proportion of apoptotic cells in 50% of the vision field were counted and indicated as the apoptosis index (AI). Detection of serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Prior to sacrificing the rabbits at the 8th week, 2 ml of blood was harvested from the central ear artery of each rabbit in each group between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. Blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 4˚C (3,600 r/min; 20 min) to isolate the serum and were stored at -20˚C. The serum IGF-1 level was determined by radioimmunoassay using IGF-1 RIA kits (Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology And Service Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) according to manufacturer's instructions. Statistical analysis. Data were processed using SPSS 13.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and expressed as mean ± standard deviation (x ± s). Analysis of variance was performed, as was Pearson's correlation analysis and linear regression. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
