Cells and viruses. 293T cell line was used in this study and maintained in DMEM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) foetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco). The plasmid rSARS-CoV-DE encodes an infectious attenuated virus derived from SARS-CoV Urbani strain (GenBank Accession No. AY278741) [25] and was kindly provided by Dr. Luis Enjuanes (CNB, CSIC, Madrid). PCR amplification of eGFP gene and modification of pBlueScriptII. Primers eGFPf 5 0 -ACTAGTATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGA-3 0 and eGFPr 5 0 -ACTAGTCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATG-3 0 (SpeI site is underlined) were used to amplify the eGFP gene from a vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). The PCR products were purified from agarose gels and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) for sequencing. Authentic clone with no mutation was used for subsequent cloning. The plasmid pBlueScriptII (Clontech) was modified by inserting a 35 bp sequence (5 0 -TATGGTACCGTTTAAACGACGGATCCTCTAGAC TG-3 0 ) containing polycloning sites using the vector sites KpnI and XbaI (underlined), which resulted in the introduction of the PmeI (GTTTAAAC) site and the deletion of the SpeI from the original vector. Construction of replicon pBAC-SARS-CoV-DEDS/eGFP. The previously constructed infectious cDNA clone (plasmid rSARS-CoV-DE) [25] was digested with PmeI and BamHI producing a 7.5 kb fragment containing 3 0 end of pp1b, S and 3a gene. This fragment was subcloned into a modified pBlueScriptII vector (described above), generating the plasmid pBS-SARS-CoV1b-3a. The eGFP gene was then inserted to replace S gene with single enzyme SpeI, generating pBS-SARS-CoV1b-3aDS/eGFP. This GFP containing fragment was cloned back into pBAC-SARS-CoV-DE digested by PmeI and BamHI, generating pBAC-SARS-CoV-DEDS/eGFP (Fig. 1) . In-frame deletion of nsp coding regions. To delete the junction region of nsp1-nsp2 which contains the C-terminus of nsp1 (139 aa) and the N-terminus of nsp2 (107 aa), pBAC-SARS-CoV-DEDS/eGFP was digested by PmlI and self-ligated to generate pBAC-SARS-CoV-DEDSDnsp1-2J/eGFP. To delete the N-terminus of nsp2, firstly, primer pair nsp2F 5 0 -GCAGTCGATCATCAGCATACCTA-3 0 (212-234 nt, forward) and nsp2R 5 0 -CAGGACATGGCATTTTCACTACAG-3 0 (1355-1378 nt, reverse) were used to amplify a fragment containing partial nsp1 and nsp2 sequences. The amplified product was cloned into pGEM-Teasy to generate clone pGT-nsp1-2. Then, the N-terminus of nsp2 (107 aa) was further deleted by the following primers: Dnsp2F 5 0 -TGCGGATCCCCACGTGTTGAAAAGA A-3 0 (1120-1136 nt) and Dnsp2R 5 0 -ATAGGATCCACCTCCATTGAG CTCAC-3 0 (788-804 nt) (BamHI site is underlined). The amplified fragment was ligated through BamHI site to generate a clone pGT-Dnsp2. Last, the plasmid pGT-Dnsp2 was digested with PmlI and cloned back into the plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-DEDS/eGFP. Using the similar deletion strategy for nsp2, based on the plasmid pBS-SARS-CoV1b-3aDS/eGFP, core sequence of nsp16 (from 20,631 to 21,422) was deleted by PCR amplification with primers Dnsp16F 5 0 -GTGGTCGACAGGCTTATCATTAGAGAAAAC-3 0 (21,423-21,443 nt) and Dnsp16R 5 0 -AGAGTCGACCAAGTTAGGCATCGCAACACC-3 0 (20,610-20,630 nt) (SalI site is underlined), with a new SalI site as a genetic marker. The amplified fragment was ligated through the SalI site to generate a clone pBS-SARS-CoV1b-3aDnsp16/eGFP. The generated plasmid was cloned back into the plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-DEDS/eGFP between PmeI and BamHI sites to generate pBAC-SARS-CoV-DEDSDnsp16/eGFP. Plasmid purification and transfection. The above constructed plasmids were purified with the Qiagen Large-Construct Kit (QIA-GEN) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection was performed when 293T cells were grown to 85% confluence with Fu-Gene6 transfection reagent (Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 for 12 h and then cultured with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS at 37°C with 5% CO 2 either until the observation at 72 h.p.t. or used for antiviral drug test with 0.4 mg/ml ribavirin (Sigma) or 0.4 mg/ml E-64D (Sigma). Western blot analysis. Cell lysates were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P Transfer membranes (Milipore) by semi-dry electrophoresis transfer (Bio-Rad). The membrane were blocked overnight in TBS (0.2 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) with 3% (w/v) BSA (BIOSHARP) and then probed with rabbit polyclonal antiserum against SARS-CoV N protein (produced at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory) or GFP (Beyotime, China) diluted 1:2000 in Immunoreaction Enhancer Solution I (Toyobo) for 1 h at 37°C, followed by washing in TBS-T (0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline) for three times. After incubation with the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (diluted 1:2000 in Immunoreaction Enhancer Solution II (Toyobo) for 1 h at 37°C, the signal was developed a BCIP/NBT substrate mix (Sino-American). Quantitative real-time PCR analyses. Total cellular RNAs from transfected 293T cells were extracted with RNAprep Cell Kit (Tian-Gen) at 72 hpt. RQ1 RNase free DNase (promega) was used to digest DNA at 37°C for 30 min followed by incubating at 65°C for 10 min. Reverse transcription was performed in a 25-ll volume was conducted at 42°C for 60 min, followed by heating to 70°C for 5 min. Primers used for RT and quantitative PCR were as follows: qSARS-N-f: 5 0 -TACCGAAGAGCTACCCGACGAGTT-3 0 ; qSARS-N-r: 5 0 -GCACGGTGGCAGCATTGTTATTAG-3 0 (for N gene detection); qbactin-f: 5 0 -CAACTGGGACGACATGGAGAAAAT-3 0 ; qb-actin-r: 5 0 -CC AGAGGCGTACAGGGATAGCAC-3 0 (for b-actin detection). Real-time quantitative PCR assays were conducted in a DNAEngine OPTICON machine (MJ). SYBR Green Real-time PCR Master Mix (Toyobo) was mixed with forward and reverse primers (0.4 lM each) in a final PCR mixture of 25 ll. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 95°C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 55°C for 20 s, 72°C for 20 s, 80°C for 3 s. Fluorescence was measured after each cycle. A melting curve was generated after the last extension step from 55°C to 95°C. The experiment was repeated three times and the data represent the means of triplicates.
