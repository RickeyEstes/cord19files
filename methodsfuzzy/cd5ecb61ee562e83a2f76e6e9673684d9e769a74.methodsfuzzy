The assessment of HSR on the air service is implemented using a panel regression analysis. The modeling framework is based on Albalate et al. (2015) and built and extended with considerations of the demand for air service as well as a richer data range. The unit of observation is air service route-year for each city pair, in other words, an observation represents a specific OD city pair's air service in a given year. The primary data such as enplanement, flight frequencies and seat capacities are collected from the annual statistics of aviation publication From a Statistical Look at the Civil Aviation for the period 2001-2014. The raw data contains 792 domestic airline routes with a total number of 6263 observations. However, the dataset is unbalanced as quite a few air routes only have data statistics in one or two years. Hence, to achieve a consistent panel assessment, a data filtering process is implemented to exclude those air service routes with observations of less than a decade. The cleaned data after this filtering includes 3834 observations with 295 OD city pairs. The level of competition between HSR and air is measured by the estimated elasticity of demand and supply changes in air transportation after the operation of HSR through the following equations:  where the dependent variables are number of enplanement (Passenger), number of flight (Frequency) and number of seats (Seat) offered by airlines serving route i in year t. Note that since all variables except the dummies are measured in logarithmical forms, the Î² estimate is interpreted as elasticity. The demand side impact of HSR on air transport is measured through Eq. (1), whereas the supply side impact is measured through Eqs. (2) and (3). The following explanatory variables are adopted following Albalate et al. (2015) and Wan et al. (2016) : Weighted population (WPOP): The variable is introduced to control for the demographic characteristic of a specific OD route that involves both origin and destination cities. Previous research suggests that the higher the weighted population of an air route, the larger both the demand and supply its air service. Weighted GDP per capita (WGDPPC): Similarly, this variable is introduced to control for the regional economic characteristic at both the origin and destination of a certain route. The measurement is the annual real GDP of each city with an air transport service. It is expected that a higher GDP per capita weighted by population implies a stronger regional economic performance and household income, which is associated with a higher level of the demand and supply of air service. Both the population and GDP per capita data are collected from the National Statistics Bureau of China. Distance: the variable reflects the Euclidean distance of an air route between origin and destination, which does not vary by time. As discussed earlier the expected influence of distance on air service supply in the face of HSR competition is imprecise varying in different studies and by type of air service. Based on Wan et al. (2016) 's finding, we tend to hypothesize that distance will have a negative statistical association with the demand and supply of air transport in China. Hub: this is a dummy variable created to measure whether an air service either starts or ends at one of the four major air hub cities which are Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu. The air route that involves at least one hub city is expected to have a relative higher demand and supply of air service than other routes, ceteris paribus. The four cities are selected as major air hubs in China based on a judgement given the following two considerations. First, the four cities were considered as major air hubs in previous studies, such as Zhang (1998) and Lin and Chen (2003) . This is because each city serves as a major base for one particular airline (e.g. Beijing for Air China, Shanghai for China Eastern, Guangzhou for China Southern, and Chengdu for Sichuan Airline), which influences the number of connecting flights. Second, the role of a city as a hub in China is also strongly influenced by public policy directed at encouraging regional development. For instance, Chengdu's hub status relates to the strong government support implied in the implementation of the national strategy of the "One Belt, One Road" where Chengdu's location and function will be important (Yu and Chao, 2016) . It is possible that the hub variable could play a part in sensitivity analysis in future research where the effect of changing the definition of an air hub (e.g. as a result of the new patterns in the air hub-and-spoke network system) on HSR demand could be investigated. HSR: this is a dummy variable in which one represents air route with a parallel HSR service between a city pair. To achieve a robust estimation, the HSR variable incorporates the following considerations: First, only direct HSR services connecting the origin and destination cities of an air route are considered. Second, given a realistic consideration of the competition between HSR and airline, we define an "effective" entry year of HSR as one year after the actual operation of the service began, counted after July 1 in each year (in other words, in the second half of a year). Third, the HSR variable is coded manually based on its opening dates (illustrated in Table 2 ) and the related service route information is obtained from the official ticket reservation website of the Chinese Railway Corporation (www.12306.cn). As illustrated in Table 3 , compared with the classical DID approach, the improved approach has a salient advantage of integrating the effects of different HSR routes, which helps capture the compound effects of HSRs, even if the services cover different cities and with different start dates. The treated group and the control group are also effectively separated with the considerations of spatial and temporal evolution of various HSR services. Year 2003 and Year 2008: both are dummy variables created to capture major events that may affect air transportation demand and supply. Specifically, Year 2003 is introduced to control for the breakout of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is expected to have had a dampening effect on the domestic air service. Conversely, Year 2008 is introduced to capture the effect of the Beijing Olympic Games, which is expected to have a positive effect on the air service demand. Trend: the variable is introduced to capture the overall growth of the demand and supply of domestic air services explained by time (everything not observable but that is likely to be increasing or decreasing with time). The characteristics of data used for HSR impact estimation are summarized in Table 4 . Table 5 shows the panel regression results of the impact of HSR on the demand for domestic air service, measured by number of passengers after controlling for other factors using both fixed effect and random effect estimators. Because the dataset is an unbalanced panel, the Hausman test is generally ineffective to determine which estimator is more preferred due to the violation of asymptotic assumptions. Instead, the Sargen-Hansen test using the Stata command xtoverid is adopted. The test is known as a generalized test for over-identifying restrictions between fixed and random effects of a panel data model. A significant test value suggests that the extra restrictions imposed by the random effect model are rejected, hence a fixed effect estimator is preferred, otherwise, a random effect is preferred. Overall, the results across different models suggest that fixed effect estimators are generally more robust.
