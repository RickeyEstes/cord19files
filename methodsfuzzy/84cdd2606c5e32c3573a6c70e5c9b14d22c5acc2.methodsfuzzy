Source of data. Ministry of Health, Singapore, actively monitors and publishes the incidence of HFMD, which was made a notifiable disease in the year 2000. 27 Two sets of data on HFMD were extracted from the Ministry's records for this study. The first dataset contains aggregate reported HFMD cases from 2003 to 2012, with the number of daily cases with onset of symptoms, stratified by age. The second dataset contains information on all HFMD outbreaks in childcare centers and kindergartens in Singapore, during the period 2011-2016. This provides the cumulative number of cases per day in each preschool with an outbreak, together with the school type (childcare centers or kindergarten), enrollment size, whether the schools were closed because of the outbreak, and, if so, dates of closure and reopening. Data were retained at a daily resolution for two analyses but aggregated to weekly for the analysis of vacations. Data were collected under Singapore's Infectious Disease Act, and because aggregate non-identifiable data were used, institutional review board approval was not deemed necessary for this study. Statistical analysis. Separate statistical analyses were performed to investigate the 1) public holiday effect, 2) school vacation effect, and 3) school closure effect on HFMD transmission, as described in the following paragraphs. Public holiday effect. There are typically 11 public holidays in Singapore each year, as detailed in Supplemental Table 1 ; these are a mix of secular and religious holidays, some of which rotate around the year following the lunar calendar. If a public holiday falls on Sunday, the following Monday will be a public holiday. We derived the dates of all public holidays from 2003 to 2012 from the official listing of the Ministry of Manpower. The effect of public holiday on HFMD transmission was measured by quantifying the reduction attributable to the public holiday. Because time points not immediately preceding or following a public holiday contribute little information to the effect of the public holiday, rather than considering a time series model, we developed a Bayesian model of the time points surrounding public holidays. The number of cases in the week before the holiday i is modeled as x i ∼ Poissonðα i × 7μÞ, and the number the week after as y i ∼ Poissonðα i × ½6μ + θμÞ, or y i ∼ Poissonðα i × ½5μ + 2θμÞ for two-day-long holidays. Here, μ represents the average number of cases on a typical day; estimates of θ and a 95% credible interval provide a measure of the public holiday effect (i.e., 1 À θ is the reduction in the number of infections on a public holiday compared with that on a normal day); and α i ∼ Γða,aÞ is an individual week effect which has an expected value of 1 and allows for autocorrelation in the time series. The window length of 1 week was selected to ensure balance in the number of weekdays in each window and to correspond roughly to the assumed incubation period of HFMD of around 3-7 days. 2 This model assumes that the difference between the number of cases prior or after the public holidays is purely because of the difference in the number of infections happening on the public holiday, which is unobservable but indirectly represented by the change in the number of symptomatic cases in the following weeks. To assess whether there was any longer term impact, we repeated the analysis comparing incidence in the second week (days [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] following the holiday with the week before it, as well as in the third week (days [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . The main analysis does not treat public holidays that were less than 7 days apart specially. In sensitivity analysis, we removed data corresponding to both holidays from the fitting procedure if they were less than 7 days apart. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted by applying different forms of the non-informative prior distributions for the parameters to test the robustness of the inference. School vacation effect. In Singapore, kindergartens, primary schools, and secondary schools have school vacations in March for 1 week, in June for 4 weeks, in September for 1 week, and in November and December for 5-6 weeks. To measure the effect of school vacations on HFMD transmission, we built time series models, fit Bayesianly, for the weekly number of children with HFMD aged 12 years and younger. This has some similarities with an autoregressive time series, but the Bayesian approach afforded greater flexibility in the model specification. We assumed a negative binomial distribution for the number of HFMD cases, Y t , observed in week t, with mean and shape parameter p, where H t = 1 if week t is a school holiday and 0 otherwise, and a, b, d, p, are model parameters that needed to be estimated: b accounts for autocorrelation, whereas d determines the effect of school vacation. A negative binomial distribution is used to allow more flexibility to capture the observed variability in the data than that obtained using the Poisson model originally considered. A constant b that does not vary with time was used because Singapore has very little seasonality that would add forcing to the timing of epidemics of HFMD, 28 and because it would hamper identifiability of the vacation effect. The adequacy of using a constant b was assessed and confirmed by examining the distribution of the residual of 1-week-ahead model forecasts. The model was fit using Bayesian methods (Markov chain Monte Carlo) with non-informative prior distributions, as described in the Supplemental File. For each draw from the posterior distribution, we iteratively derived the median number of cases for the following week based on the number of cases in the current week using the formula in the aforementioned model. The number of cases in the first week of the simulations was taken to be the observed average weekly number of cases across the time horizon. This was done for 104 weeks (2 years) and only the latter 52 weeks were kept as the number of weekly cases for a typical year. For each set of posterior values, 1,000 such simulations were performed. Based on these 1,000 simulations of a typical year scenario using each of the 10,000 sets of posterior values, 95% prediction and credible intervals were derived for each of the 52 time points. Median values for all 1,000 simulated numbers for each set of posterior values (10,000 median values in total) were calculated. School closure during outbreaks effect. For each preschool that had an outbreak during the time horizon 2011-2016, a period of 50 days from the first day of case onset was considered; this was enough to span the duration of most outbreaks. The number of incident cases on day j in outbreak i, x i,j , was modeled by where c i,j is the cumulative number of cases within 1 week before day j in outbreak i, s i,j is the number of children not yet symptomatically infected during the current outbreak by day j of outbreak i, and w i,j is the indicator for school closure on day j in outbreak i (w i,j = 1 if the school was closed on day j in outbreak i, and 0 otherwise). We smoothed the effect λ k of the current outbreak size k using the formula The posterior samples were used to project the number of cases that were avoided by forcing schools to close when they hit the trigger. For each draw from the posterior, 100 simulations were performed to each of the schools with closures in our study period. In each simulation, the number of new incident cases on each day after the closure day was calculated using the model formulation and w i,j was set to be 0. The total number of cases was then compared with the observed number of cases when schools close and the total number of additional cases due to not closing schools for each simulation/set of posterior values was recorded. Median values for all 100 simulated numbers for each set of posterior values (10,000 median values in total) were calculated. We use Bayesian methods to fit the models as the Bayesian paradigm was considered more flexible than its frequentist analog. Throughout, non-informative prior distributions were selected (detailed in Supplemental File 1) and models were fit, using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms with burn-in periods of 1,000 and 10,000 iterations, in the R statistical environment. 29 The posterior samples were then used to obtain posterior distributions of derived quantities. Throughout, equal-tailed 95% credible intervals are used. Model convergence was evaluated by using the Gelman diagnostic tests 30 and model validity assessed by comparing posterior predictions or simulations with the actual observed data.
