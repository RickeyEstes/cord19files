The use of purified and well-characterized proteins to assemble the microarray will insure the highest quality and most reproducible results. However, the high level of quality control required to sequence, purify, and characterize elements of a proteome microarray in the examples we described may not be as important for provisional screening purposes. A coupled transcription/translation reaction was previously reported as a rapid method to develop protein microarrays against a number of infectious organisms [43, 44] , bypassing sequencing and purification steps. In this technique, both transcription and translation occur simultaneously to synthesize proteins in parallel from PCR products, directly on the chip. Presumably, results obtained by these methods will require follow-up studies with more rigorous controls for confirmation. The protein in situ array (PISA) developed by He and Taussig [45] first produces DNA constructs from a PCR of the protein of interest and a T7 promoter for translational initiation followed by immobilization using a N or C terminal tag sequence. Another approach [25, 46] called nucleic acid programmable protein array (NAPPA) included slides coated with avidin to capture biotinylated plasmid DNA for synthesizing proteins. Proteins with fused tags were synthesized and immobilized on the chips coated with molecules to bind the tags [25] . He et al. [47] described a technique called DNA array to protein array (DAPA) where they utilized a single DNA array to make multiple copies of the same protein array. In one example, a self-assembled NAPPA-based on a cell-free expression system was used for constructing a protein microarray of all 69 proteins produced by varicella zoster virus (VZV), the cause of chickenpox [48] . Three sets of antigens in the VZV proteome were identified from human sera that may be useful in defining the clinical status of the infection and diagnostics. Another VZV protein array produced from an E. coli expression system was later used to detect antibodies in human sera reactive to VZV viral proteins [49] . The ORF68 (gE) antigen identified in the study showed high-confidence for determination of the serological response to VZV. Although these alternative in situ synthesis methods are rapid, they are not without significant shortcomings. It is difficult to characterize proteins expressed on the chip in contrast to direct spotting of purified proteins. Two studies investigated the antibody response to VZV by protein arrays made from either NAPPA cell-free expression system [48] or E. coli expression system [49] . Antibodies from the sera of patients recognized three microarrayed VZV proteins produced recombinantly with E. coli, whereas these identical proteins were not recognized on a NAPPA protein expression-based protein microarray. Interestingly, these proteins were abundantly expressed in the NAPPA protein microarrays, suggesting that they did not fold correctly to expose their linear epitopes for binding. Despite these limitations, microarrays based on in situ synthesis offer simplicity, efficiency, and highthroughput capabilities. The relatively small proteomes of most viruses increase in diversity by considering variations in clinical isolates. For example, while human papilloma virus produces only a few proteins, sequences for these may diverge in the more than 100 strains of the virus. A protein microarray developed with 13 human papilloma virus types [50] was used to examine patient sera compared to asymptomatic subjects. The study identified E7 proteins as the most reactive antigens in the patient group. However, the E7 proteins were not useful as a diagnostic biomarker because the differences between patients and asymptomatic subjects were not significant. In another report, a bead suspension multiplex array (Luminex xMAP) was used to study serological responses to 27 antigens of human papilloma virus [51] . The data correlated well with ELISA results and in addition the bead array was able to measure weak antibody responses. A protein array constructed from six coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was used for screening serum samples for virus-specific antibodies [52] . The microarray data predicted SARS infection in 90% of the patients correctly with a specificity of 93%.
