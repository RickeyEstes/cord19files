Generation of Transgenic Mice. The LCMV Armstrong NP cDNA was prepared by BamHI digestion from plasmid pARMNP, which contains the entire coding sequence of the NP. The full-length cDNA of the LCMV Armstrong GP was obtained by RT-PCR amplification of viral RNA. Total RNA was purified from the brain of a mouse that had been persistently infected with LCMV Armstrong since birth. cDNA was made using random hexamer primers and murine Maloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase as described (17) . PCR amplification of the viral GP was done using primers that hybridize to the 5 Ј and 3 Ј ends of the GP sequence: primer 1, which hybridizes to bp 1-26, 5 Ј -CCGGGGATC-CTAGGCTTTTTGGATTG-3 Ј ; and primer 2, which hybridizes to bp 1553-1585, 5 Ј -GGGGATCCTGTTCTTCAGCGT-CTTTTCCAGAC-3 Ј . PCR was done using Taq Polymerase (Perkin Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT) following reaction conditions indicated by the manufacturer and performing 35 cycles at 95 Њ C for 1 min, 60 Њ C for 1 min, 72 Њ C for 3 min. The 1575-bp product was cloned into the TA vector system (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and then digested with BamHI. The NP and GP cDNAs were cloned into the BamHI site of pMBP001, which contains sequences from Ϫ 1907 to ϩ 36 of the MBP promoter, followed by a polylinker region linked to a portion of the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene as described (18) . The PLP sequences provided splice and polyadenylation signals and included PLP exon 6, intron 6, and exon 7. Linear DNA fragments containing the regulatory regions plus NP or GP sequences were obtained by NotI digestion. The DNA was microinjected in The Scripps Research Institute Transgenic Facility into BALB/cByJ ϫ C57BL/6J fertilized eggs. LCMV-NP transgenic mice were bred to BALB/ cByJ (H-2 d ) mice, and the LCMV-GP transgenic mice were bred to C57BL/6J (H-2 b ) mice. MBP-␤ -galactosidase ( ␤ gal) transgenic mice (18) were bred to BALB/cByJ and C57BL/6J mice. All nontransgenic breeder mice were obtained from the breeding colony at The Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, CA). DNA and RNA Analyses. Transgenic founders were identified by hybridization of NP-or GP-specific 32 P-labeled DNA probes (19) to slot-blots containing samples of DNA extracted from tail biopsies. Relative transgene copy numbers were determined by slot-blot hybridization as compared with known standards of gene copy number. Mice were characterized for RNA expression by RT-PCR on total RNA isolated as described (17) , using primers that hybridize within the transgene and a primer that hybridizes within PLP exon 7. RT-PCR products corresponding to correctly spliced NP transgenes were 510 bp (NP) and 780 bp (GP). RNase protection assays for cytokine mRNA expression were done on 2-4 mice using 15 g of purified total brain RNA or 1 g of poly-(A) ϩ mRNA as described (20, 21) . The relative amounts of cytokine RNA were quantitated by using the Series 400 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Imager units (PI units) were normalized to equivalence based on values for rpL32 transcripts, which encode the L32 ribosomal protein (20, 22) . Virus Stocks and Infections of Mice. LCMV Armstrong 53b, which is a triple plaque-purified isolate of ARM CA 1371 (23) , was used. The AN3739 strain of Pichinde virus (24) was used. LCMV and Pichinde viruses were passaged in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. Recombinant vaccinia viruses made from strain WR containing either no LCMV products, or the LCMV NP gene (VV-NP), were generated and passaged as described (25) . Transgenic positive and negative mice were infected at 6-10 wk of age i.p. with 0.5-2 ϫ 10 6 PFU of LCMV. In double infection experiments, 6-10 wk after primary infection, mice were injected i.p. with 2 ϫ 10 6 PFU LCMV, 2 ϫ 10 6 PFU Pichinde virus, 3.5 ϫ 10 6 PFU VV-NP, or 3.5 ϫ 10 6 PFU vaccinia virus (VV). Immunohistochemical Staining of CNS Tissues. Mice were anesthetized and perfused with 40 ml saline. Brains and spinal cord were removed, covered with Tissue-Tec OCT (Miles Diagnostics Division, Elkhart, IN), snap-frozen at Ϫ 80 Њ C in isopentane, and then stored at Ϫ 20 Њ C. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 10-12-m cryostat sections that were fixed in 100% ethanol for 15 min at 4 Њ C and blocked with avidin and biotin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Staining was done with the following primary antibodies: anti-CD8 (anti-Ly-2 and Ly-3, Phar-Mingen, San Diego, CA), anti-CD4 (anti L3T4; PharMingen), anti-H-2 monotypic antigen (MHC class I), anti-Ia antigen (MHC class II), anti-B220 (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN), and anti-F4/80 (Serotec, Oxford, England). The second antibody was a biotinylated anti-mouse IgG and was used in conjunction with the Vectastain Elite ABC (peroxidase) kit (Vector Laboratories). Staining was detected using diaminobenzidine as a chromagen. Sections were counterstained in Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and mounted in Aqua-Mount (Lerner Laboratories, Pittsburgh, PA). Immunofluorescence staining for confocal microscopy was performed on similarly prepared, cut, and fixed cryostat brain sections. Sections were blocked with Superblock (ScyTek, Logan, UT) and stained with primary antibodies; rat anti-mouse CD8, rat anti-mouse F4/80, and mouse anti-rat myelin basic protein (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN). Secondary fluorescent antibodies used were Texas red-labeled horse anti-mouse IgG and FITC-labeled rabbit anti-rat IgG (Vector Laboratories) and the slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Double-immunolabeled sections were examined with a BioRad (MRC 600) laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with an argon/krypton mixed gas laser. Chromium Release CTL Assays. 51 Cr-release CTL assays were performed as described (25) . In brief, primary LCMV-specific CTL were generated by i.p. inoculation of 5 ϫ 10 5 PFU of LCMV. Secondary viral CTL assays were done by infecting LCMV-immune mice with viruses as indicated. 7 d later the animals were killed and single cell suspensions were prepared from each of the spleens. Target cells were BALB clone 7 (H-2 d ) and MC57 (H-2 b ) fibroblasts cell lines that were either uninfected or infected 48 h before the assay with LCMV or 12 h before with VV recombinants. The effector cells were plated with the target cells at E/T ratios of 50:1 and 25:1 and incubated at 37 Њ C for 5 h. Effectors were always tested on both MHC-matched and MHCmismatched targets. The supernatants were harvested, and released 51 Cr was measured in a ␥ -counter. The specific 51 Cr release was calculated by the following formula: ([experimental release Ϫ spontaneous release] / [maximum release Ϫ spontaneous release]) ϫ 100. Each variable was tested in triplicate wells, and the variance among triplicates was within 10%. Clinical Observations. Mice were observed for signs such as weight loss, ruffled fur, and ability to walk on a narrow stick (1 cm diam). Mice were tested for balancing and motor coordination on a rotating rod apparatus (rotorod) (26, 27) . Age-matched LCMVinfected transgenic positive and negative mice were placed onto three separated compartments on the rod, which was then rotated at a constant speed of 36 rpm. The length of time the mice remained on the rod was recorded, with the test ending at a 3-min maximum time on the rod. Each mouse was tested in three trials separated by 1-min rest intervals.
