The adverse outcome group and the uncomplicated group were compared in terms of age, sex, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes by univariate analysis. The corticosteroid therapy group was compared with the non-corticosteroid therapy group in terms of their demographic characteristics, presence of comorbidities, peak LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) levels and adverse clinical outcomes by univariate analysis. Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-Square test and Fisher-Exact test were used as appropriate. The established adverse prognostic factors for SARS mortality including old age, presence of comorbidities and high LDH levels 1,3,6,8,9 were used as covariates in multiple logistic regressions to adjust for their confounding effect on adverse outcomes. All tests were two-tailed. p values less than 0.05 were taken as significant.
