Obtaining precise quantitative data on the distances that bats migrate and their migratory pathways has been technologically challenging. From the 1930s until recently, placing numbered aluminum bands on bats was the predominant method used to study bat (and bird) migration. This method involves banding bats at one roost (either a summer or winter roost), and then attempting to recapture banded bats (or recover their bands) somewhere else. This method is very labor intensive and inefficient because only a tiny fraction (¼1%) of banded bats are usually ever recovered away from their original banding sites. For example, over 400 000 T. brasiliensis were banded in winter roosts in Mexico and summer roosts in the southern United States in the 1950s and 1960s, and only a handful were ever recovered away from their banding sites. In addition to banding, methods that are currently being used to study bat migration include analyses involving DNA and stable isotopes and tracking studies using radio or satellite transmitters. Control region mitochondrial DNA is potentially very informative about genetic connections among distant roosts from which migratory connections can be inferred. A study of L. curasoae using this technique, for example, was able to identify two pathways along which females moved from south-central Mexico into the Sonoran Desert and southeastern Arizona, respectively, using data from only 49 individuals captured at a total of 13 roosts. Since this species is federally endangered in the United States and Mexico, large-scale banding operations were not feasible and other methods were needed to determine the scale of its migratory movements. Genetic analysis proved to be a very efficient method to obtain this information and to identify roosts in Mexico of special conservation concern (e.g., mating roosts). Other species whose migratory behavior has been studied using genetic techniques include Miniopterus schreibersii, N. noctula, and T. brasiliensis. Another analytical technique that has provided important new insights into the migratory behavior of hard-tostudy bats is stable isotope analysis. Stable isotopes of carbon and hydrogen are especially useful for this. The 13 C stable isotope of carbon allows one to determine whether herbivorous animals are feeding on plants that use the CAM, C4, or C3 photosynthetic pathway. The first two pathways are used by succulent plants (e.g., cacti and agaves) or tropical grasses (e.g., corn), respectively, and are enriched in 13 C compared with the more common C3 plants. By analyzing carbon stable isotopes in muscle tissue taken from museum specimens collected throughout its geographic range in Mexico and the southwestern United States, Fleming and colleagues found that individuals of L. curasoae use CAM plants (primarily columnar cacti in the spring and agaves in the fall) as food sources during migration and C3 plants during the winter. Knowing that columnar cacti occur in the Pacific coastal lowlands of Mexico and that agaves occur in upland portions of the Sierra Madre, they were able to identify the likely 'nectar corridors' along which these bats fly during migration. Deuterium (D), the stable isotope of hydrogen, is useful for determining the migration distances of solitary roosting insectivores such as L. cinereus and L. noctivagans. Values of D vary inversely with latitude, elevation, and distance from coasts and can indicate approximately where bats were living when new tissue such as hair was produced. Since the aforementioned bats tend to molt before migrating in the fall, an analysis of hair samples from bats caught during migration or in their winter locations can be used to determine how far they migrated after molting. This technique has been used to determine migration distances of 1800-2600 km for both males and females of L. cinereus in North America. Some bats molting during the summer in Canada were captured in Mexico in the winter. The researchers concluded that this technique holds considerable promise for studying long-distance migration in bats. Radiotagging and satellite tracking are two methods for directly studying the migratory behavior of bats. Radio transmitters weighing <1 g are readily available and have been used to study the foraging and roosting behavior of many species of bats, including species weighing <10 g. Except for the Australian Pteropus poliocephalis, which can carry transmitters with large batteries because of their large size, they have not yet been used to study bat migration for at least two reasons: (i) the battery life of these transmitters is short (about 2 weeks) and limits the amount of data that can be gathered from individual bats; (ii) since they migrate at night and sometimes at substantial altitudes (up to 2400 m), following radiotagged bats during migration involves potentially dangerous night time airplane flights over unknown terrain. Less dangerous but more costly in terms of transmitters (which currently cost US$1-3K) and daily or weekly downloads, satellite transmitters offer great potential for studying migration in bats, as it does for birds. Solar-powered satellite transmitters now weigh 12 g and have been used to study foraging and migration movements of one species of pteropodid bat that roosts in tree canopies (rather than in caves) during the day. Richter and Cumming studied the movements of four individuals of the 300 g frugivore Eidolon helvum that they tagged in central Zambia, Africa. These bats foraged up to 59 km from their day roost and traveled 878-1975 km over a period of two or more weeks when flying north to the Democratic Republic of Congo. During the return trips, these bats averaged 90 km per night. Satellite transmitters equipped with conventional batteries (total package weight ¼ 33-40 g) have been placed on two young males of Pteropus poliocephalus weighing 790 and 857 g in south-eastern Australia. Over the course of about a year, these bats made round trips of >2000 km spanning over 4 latitude as they moved up to 400 km among roosts in response to changes in the local availability of eucalypt blossoms.
