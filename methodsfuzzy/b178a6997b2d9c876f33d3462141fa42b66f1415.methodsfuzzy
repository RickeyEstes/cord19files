The modeling method of this study is CFD simulation. This has already been used not only as an environmental research tool, but also as a design tool for urban planners and designers [29] . ANSYS Fluent CFD Software Package (version 14.0) was used for this study. This study used the Eulerian method to investigate the efficiency of different design strategies on air pollutant dispersion. The Eulerian and the Lagrangian methods are widely used to model air pollutant dispersion [15, 30, 31] . Compared with the Lagrangian method, which considers the species as a discrete phase, the Eulerian method considers species as a continuous phase and is solved based on a control volume, which is similar in form to that for the fluid phase [30, 31] . Therefore, the Eulerian method is more convenient for calculating the air pollutant concentration, which was the index this study used to evaluate air pollutant dispersion. Another reason for choosing the Eulerian method was that it has lower computational demands than the Lagrangian method, which needs to track more than several million particles in the large computational domain for outdoor environment simulation. The Eulerian method has been validated by researchers comparing the simulated data with wind tunnel experiment results [15, 30] . In this study, ANSYS Fluent was used to solve the unsteady convection-diffusion equation to predict the mass fraction of species Y i [32] : Where S i is the rate of the user-defined source term, i is the number of species, r is the air density, v . is the overall velocity vector, t is time, and J i . is the mass diffusion in turbulent flows. Inlet diffusion is enabled to include the diffusion flux of species at the emission inlet. Because the simulation excludes chemical reaction, the rate of the product from chemical reaction (R i ) is set to zero. J i . in the turbulence is estimated as [32] : Where D i,m and D T,i are the mass diffusion coefficient for species i and the thermal diffusion coefficient, respectively, sc t is the turbulent Schmidt number (the default value 0.7 is used in this study), and m t is the turbulent viscosity.
