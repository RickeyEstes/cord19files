The goat farm, located in Deux-Sevres (western France), comprised an Alpine herd of 100 milking does raised indoors using a zero-grazing system. The kids were immediately separated from their dams at birth and received two feedings during the first 12 h of life, each consisting of 150 ml of pooled goat colostrum. This was followed by milk replacer feed containing 50% skimmed milk powder distributed from a multiteat outlet container. In February 1994, two groups of male kids were selected. In each group, the animals were reared in the same pen on deep litter straw bedding. The first group consisted of 18 kids; of these, nine had been born on 9 February and had been treated with paromomycin; the other nine, born 2 days later were untreated controls. The second group (II = 12), born the same day 1 week later, was divided into treated (n = 7) and control (n = 5) kids using a random numbers generator. The treatment was conducted by the farmer with paromomycin sulfate (HUMfiEL enfants, Parke-Davis, France) at a total daily dose rate of 100 mg kg-' body weight (SW) for 11 consecutive days beginning at 2 days of age (Fayer and Ellis, 1993) . The powdered drug was dispensed into water and given orally with a syringe in two daily dosages. Feces samples were individually taken with rectal curettes every 3 or 4 days from days 4-5 to days 15-19. Demonstration of oocysts was made by staining fecal smears with Ziehl fuchsin and observing at X 100 magnification under a phase-contrast microscope according to Heine ( 1982) . Oocyst numbers were scored semi-quantitatively on a scale from 0 to 5: 0, no oocyst; 1, less than one oocyst per field; 2, I-10 oocysts; 3, 1 l-20 oocysts; 4, 21-30 oocysts; 5, more than 30 oocysts. The presence or absence of diarrhea was recorded blind by the farmer's wife on a daily basis. Kids were weighed at the age of 2, 6 and 10 days with a stand-on scale ( +50 g). Comparisons of the weights and mean daily weight gains between groups were made by one-tailed Mann-Whitney test at the 0.05 level of confidence on each set of kids.
