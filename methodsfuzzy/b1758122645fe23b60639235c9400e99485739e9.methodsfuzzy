The theoretical study of electricity market started in the middle of the 20th century with the development of computer science. However, progress in theory and practice was slow during the initial period. It was not until the 1980s that the theoretical study of medium-to-long-term electricity demand forecasting began. A series of forecasting methods, such as top-down econometric modeling and bottom-up end-use accounting modeling, was successively developed and widely accepted in the electricity demand forecasting of power systems [7] . Having reviewed the literature of energy modeling, Lin made an analysis of energy demand forecasting for China by using an econometric model. The article states that econometric models using GDP and electricity tariff as main driving variables may have at least one disadvantage. Since the economic variables employed in the econometric model are likely to be endogenous, estimating electricity demand by a single equation may produce simultaneous bias and lead to unreliable forecasts. There could be many other factors that require proper attention in determining electricity demand in China's rural area. An important one, for example, is the climate. Dry climate in a year means that more electricity is needed for irrigation. Cold or gloomy days mean that more electricity will be generally used for heating and lighting. Electricity demand also varies according to the time of day. Therefore, the demand for electricity in rural areas depends on climate changes and peak demands during cold and hot seasons. However, it is difficult to incorporate such climate change factors in an econometric model. For our research, we used SEDA 2 V2, a well-developed mathematical computer model for sectorial energy demand analysis. We developed the first version to analyze the strategies of 10 Asian oil importing countries and economies during 1992-1996 [8] . In the current study, to describe energy consumption in rural households and capture the variable of ''population'', we updated the model with a special module. In this section, we present part of the mathematical equations of SEDA 2 V2. The total electricity demand (ED) in the rural electricity market is the sum of electricity demand for all sectors in a rural area. Mathematically, it can be expressed as follows: where ED t is the total electricity demand, ED it is the electricity demand in sectors not including rural households , ED Ht is the electricity demand in rural households in period t. Eq. (1) can be further formulated as follows: where VA it is the value added by sector i (i ¼ 1, 2,. . .n) at period t (t ¼ 1, 2, 3,. . .m) (billion 1999 Yuan); EI it is the electricity intensity in sector i (i ¼ 1, 2,. . .n) at period t (t ¼ 1, 2, 3,. . .m) (GW h/million Yuan); S it is the economic shares of the rural economy in sector i at period t (%); GDP t is the gross domestic product of rural economy at period t (billion 1999 Yuan). Since rural GDP is not available, we use rural economic output in this study; NH t is the number of households at period t (t ¼ 1, 2, 3,. . .m); EIH t is the electricity intensity in rural household at period t (kWh/per household); INH t is the inverse of the number of people per household at period t (household/number of people); POP t is the rural population at period t (million persons). By differentiating Eq. (2), we derived where dEC t is the electricity demand change in period t in rural market, P n i¼1 ½EI it Â GDP t Â dS it is the electricity demand change in rural market in period t due to structural effect, P n i¼1 ½S it Â GDP t Â dEI it is the electricity demand change in rural market in period t due to sectoral effect, P n i¼1 ½EI it Â S it Â dGDP t is the electricity demand change in rural market in period t due to activity effect, EIH t Â INH t Â dPOP t is the electricity demand change in rural households in period t due to population change in rural area, EIH t Â POP t Â dINH t is the electricity demand change in rural households in period t due to the change of number of people per household, IN H t Â POP t Â dEIH t is the electricity demand change in rural households in period t due to the change of electricity intensity per household. On the basis of historical data and scenarios, we used the above model to analyze the rural electricity market year by year from 2001 to 2010. In determining the changes of the parameters (dS it , dEI it , etc.), we analyzed the historical values of the variables and used scenario analysis on the basis of China's 10th Five-Year Economic and Social Development Plan, and interviewed with Chinese government officers on social and economic development policies. In the next section, we will discuss the data, variables, and their processes for fitting the model.
