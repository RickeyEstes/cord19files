Microscopy in cell culture: Cell culture means growing living cells outside of living organisms in controlled conditions [25] . In order to produce a cell culture the most significant thing is doing all the work under sterile conditions [14] . First step of producing a cell culture is removing and mincing the required tissue. After that, different enzymes such as collagenase are applied to the tissue for degradation of extracellular matrix and releasing cells. Then centrifugation step is applied. Later, cells and growth media are combined with culture dishes and contained in an incubator with humidity, 37 C temperature and 5% CO 2 . Lastly, cells grow and divide by linking to the dish [14] . Cell culture-based virus isolation has been accepted as a "gold standard" in the detection and identification of viruses and is the technique by which all other test methods have been compared [35] . Immunofluorescence assay (IFA): IFA is a diagnostic technique that uses the interaction between viruses and specific antibodies [14, 25] . IFA can be considered a relatively quick method, and it is easy to apply without special technicians, it provides the certain identification of the virus [25] . It is one of the commonly used techniques for the rapid detection of virus infections by identifying virus antigens. IFA staining usually gives very rapid, sensitive, and specific virus identification in about 1Ã€2 hours. Unfortunately, the IFA technique may not be able to verify the identity of all virus strains and may be quite expensive due to the cost of the antibodies used [36] . Before the availability of ELISA tests, IFA was used for diagnostics, but now it is only used for research studies [27] .
