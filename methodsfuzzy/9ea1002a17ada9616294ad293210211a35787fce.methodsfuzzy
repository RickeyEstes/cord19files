Chimpanzees Chimpanzee A0A006 has already been described. 13 The animal was handled according to humane use and care guidelines specified by Animal Research Committees at the National Institutes of Health, The Scripps Research Institute, and Bioqual Laboratories. The chimpanzee was individually housed at Bioqual Laboratories (Rockville, MD), an American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited institution under contract to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Chimpanzee A0A006 was inoculated with 10 10 genome equivalents of HBV obtained from an HBV-positive serum of chimpanzee 5835 that was previously inoculated with a monoclonal HBV isolate (genotype D, ayw subtype; GenBank accession no. V01460) 25 contained in HBV transgenic mouse serum, 14 as described. Blood was obtained by venipuncture and analyzed for serum IL-10 (see below). Mice C57BL/6, CD45.1 (inbred C57BL/6), and Balb/c mice were purchased from Charles River. IL-10 À/À mice (B6.129P2-Il10 tm1Cgn /J) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. HBV replication-competent transgenic mice (lineage 1.3.32, inbred C57BL/6, H-2 b ), that express all of the HBV antigens and replicate HBV in the liver at high levels without any evidence of cytopathology, were previously described. 13, 14 In indicated experiments, these mice were used as C57BL/6 x Balb/c H-2 bxd F1 hybrids. HBV nucleocapsid (Cor)-specific (referred to as Cor93 cells) T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice (lineage BC10.3, inbred CD45.1), in which >98% of the splenic CD8 + T cells recognize a K b -restricted epitope located between residues 93-100 in the HBV Core protein (MGLKFRQL), were previously described. 17 Env28 (envelope) TCR transgenic mice (lineage 6C2.36, inbred Balb/ c), in which $83% of the splenic CD8 + T cells recognize a L d -restricted epitope located between residues 28-39 of HBsAg (IPQSLDSWWTSL), were previously described. 17 In indicated experiments, lineage BC10.3 or lineage 1.3.32 were crossed with IL-10 À/À mice. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions and used at 8-10 weeks of age. In all experiments, mice were matched for age, sex and (for the 1.3.32 animals) serum HBeAg levels before experimental manipulations. All experimental animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Committee of San Raffaele Scientific Institute.
