Heating carbon black and graphites in a controlled flame environment has been successfully utilized for the preparation of CNTs for the last two decades (Iijima, 1991) . However, nanotubes synthesized by this method are irregular in size, shape, mechanical strength, quality, and purity owing to their uncontrollable natural environment. Of late, a number of artificially developed methods have been extensively utilized for their synthesis, including catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electric arc discharge, and laser ablation (Awasthi et al., 2005) as depicted in Figures 15.2Ã€15.4 respectively, and Table 15 .1. Additionally, several newer techniques, plasma-enhanced CVD, thermal CVD, laser-assisted CVD, high-pressure CVD, cobalt-molybdenum catalytic (CoMoCat) process, and high-pressure carbon monoxide (HiPCO) disproportionation process have been developed for high-quality CNT production (Beg et al., 2011) . Different methods of preparation produce CNTs with different physical and mechanical properties. The types of methods usually differ from one another in terms of the type of CNTs produced, solubility, mechanical properties, quality, purity, and yield.
