Data were collected from different conference papers published in the IEEE. From these papers, different methods of analyzing the user behavior [10] was assessed. This report is based on a review of the published articles and analyzes the methods they have used. The data are given in a tabular form. Data collection techniques and behavior analysis methods used by different studies are shown in Table 4 . The behavior of users can be analyzed using different methods as shown in Table 5 . Fig. 3 is based on the classification of papers based on the different methods used and it is clear that the researchers have used analysis techniques more than others and they have rarely used coding rules.
