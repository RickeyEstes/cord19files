The study has been conducted on 240 6-8-week-old outbred white male mice from the laboratory animal nursery of FBRI SRC VB Vector. Animals were housed in standard conditions with free access to food and water. Period of animal adaptation to housing conditions before the experiment was two weeks. The investigation was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki international principles. The mice were taken out of the experiment through the dislocation of the cervical spine vertebrae under ether narcosis. A/goose/Krasnoozerskoye/627/05 (H5N1) influenza virus (hereinafter referred to as A/H5N1 virus), isolated from the lung of a goose which died in September 2005 during avian influenza epizootic in Krasnoozerskoe village, Novosibirsk Region, Russia, was used as infectious agent. Mice were intranasally infected with 10 MLD 50 of A/H5N1. Experimental works with studied HPAI H5N1 virus strain have been performed in accordance with sanitary regulations on safe work with microorganisms of III-IV pathogenicity group and helminthes. The study has been conducted in three experiments on 80 mice in eachfirst group (control) consisted of intact animals (20 mice) and the second group consisted of 60 mice infected with A/goose/Krasnoozerskoye/627/05 (H5N1) influenza virus. Samples of liver of animals infected with A/H5N1 were obtained 1, 3, 6, and 10 days after infection, 10 animals in each experimental period. Control animals were withdrawn from the experiment on the 1st and 10th day. Specimens were fixed in 10% formalin, dehydrated in alcohols of increasing concentrations, and embedded in paraffin pouring mixture "HISTAMIX" ("BioVitrum, " Russia). Sections of 3 micron thickness were prepared on a rotary microtome HM355S ("Microm, " Germany) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin by standard procedure and by immunohistochemical (IHC) method. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed by using indirect streptavidin-peroxidase method with specific primary antibodies against influenza A antigen (Inf A/FITC ("Abcam")), TNF-("DBS"), and IL-6 ("Novocastra") and lysosomal enzymes (Cathepsin D ("DBS"), Myeloperoxidase ("DBS"), and Lysozyme ("DBS")). For IHC studies sections were dewaxed and rehydrated. After antigen unmasking in a microwave oven at 700 W power for 20-25 minutes and washing with distilled water, phosphate buffer, endogenous peroxidase was blocked within 5 minutes. Exposure time to the primary antibodies was 30-45 minutes at 37 ∘ C. Sections were incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase complex, DABsubstrate and further counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. To visualize the antibodies "NovoLink" detection system ("Novocastra") was used. Morphometric study of tissue structural elements was conducted using closed test system consisting of 100 points, square 3.64 × 10 5 m 2 . There were registered volume density ( V ) of destructive changes (as the sum of dystrophy and necrosis) and inflammatory infiltrates in the liver and the numerical density ( ai ) of cells expressing studied IHC markers [20] . Statistical analysis of the results was performed using the statistical analysis package Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and standard software package STATISTICA v.6. The arithmetic mean value ( ) and standard error of the mean ( ) were determined. To identify the probability of significance of differences of compared average values we used Student's -test. Differences were considered statistically significant at the 5% significance level ( < 0.05).
