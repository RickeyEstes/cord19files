Mice, virus infection, and tamoxifen administration. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Aicda CreERT2 mice and Rosa26 loxp-tdTomato mice [B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze /J; Ai14] were generously provided by Claude-Agnes Reynaud and Dimitrios Davalos, respectively, and have been previously described (4) . Progeny of the cross between AID CreERT2 and Rosa26 loxp-tdTomato mice were termed AID Cre -Rosa26 tdTomato mice. Mice were housed at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute under pathogen-free conditions. All animal procedures were executed in accordance with approved guidelines by the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male and female mice of 6 to 8 weeks of age were infected by intracranial (i.c.) injection with 2,000 PFU of hepato-and neurotropic MHV-A59, kindly provided by Volker Thiel (University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland) (43) . Infected animals were evaluated daily for clinical signs utilizing the following scale: 0, healthy; 1, hunched back and ruffled fur; 2, inability to correct to upright position or partial hind limb paralysis; 3, complete hind limb paralysis and wasting; 4, moribund or deceased. To induce tdTomato expression, mice were administered 3 mg of tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in corn oil (20 mg/ml) via oral gavage every other day. Treatment was initiated at day 0 p.i. unless otherwise stated. Mononuclear cell isolation and flow cytometric analysis. Cells were isolated from the CNS as described previously (13, 44) . Briefly, brains or spinal cords harvested from phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-perfused mice were mechanically homogenized in Dulbecco's PBS using ice-cold Tenbroeck grinders. The resulting suspensions were centrifuged at 450 ϫ g for 7 min at 4°C, supernatants stored at Ϫ80°C for subsequent analysis, and cells resuspended in RPMI medium. Cells were adjusted to 30% Percoll (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ), underlaid with 1 ml 70% Percoll, and collected from the 30%-70% Percoll interface following centrifugation at 850 ϫ g for 30 min at 4°C. After washing, cells were resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin [BSA] in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] containing a 10% serum mixture comprised of mouse, goat, and horse serum [1:1:1] and rat anti-mouse Fc␥III/II monoclonal Ab [MAb] [2.4G2; BD Bioscience, San Diego, CA]) for 20 min on ice. Cells were then stained with MAb specific for cell surface markers CD45 (30-F11), CD19 (1D3), CD138 (281-2), T cell and B cell activation antigen (GL7) (all from BD Pharmingen), and IgD (11-26c; Affymetrix, Inc., San Diego, CA). Cells were then washed with FACS buffer, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed on a BD LSR II or FACSAria III flow cytometer. The resulting data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR). ELISPOT. ASC were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISPOT) as described previously (1, 13, 14) . Briefly, sterile white 96-well filter plates with 0.45-m-pore-size hydrophobic polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA) were stripped with 70%
