2.1. Construction of plasmids containing genes encoding PEDV-S, PEDV-S1 or SwIL-18 The plasmid EasyT-S containing the full-length S gene of PEDV strain CV777 was constructed in our laboratory by common cloning techniques and used as a template for PCR amplification. A sense primer P1 (5 -GGGGGGATCCATGAGGTCTTTAATTTAC), and two antisense primers P2 (CCCCGAATTCTTAAATACTCATACTAAA) and P3 (5 -CCCCGAATTCTCATCTCTGCACGTGGAC) which contain BamHI (P1) and EcoRI (P2 and P3) restriction enzyme sites (underlined), were used for PCR. The amplification profile for the full length S gene (primers P1/P2) was as follows: 95 • C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 • C for 2.5 min, 56.8 • C for 2.5 min, and 72 • C for 5 min. A final extension of 72 • C for 10 min was performed at the end of the cycling period. The amplification profile for PEDV-S1 gene (primers P1/P3) was the same as for the PEDV-S gene except that the annealing temperature was raised to 54.8 • C. Plasmid pUC18-(IL-18) containing the full-length swine interleukin 18 gene was used as template for PCR. The sense and antisense primers P4 (5 -GGGGGGATCCATGTACTTTGGCAAGCTT) and P5 (5 -CCCCGAATTCCTAGTTCTTGTTTTGAACA) included BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzyme sites (underlined), respectively. The PCR profiles included 95 • C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 • C for 0.5 min, 56.5 • C for 0.5 min, and 72 • C for 1 min followed by a final extension of 72 • C for 10 min. All PCR products were purified, restriction enzyme digested and ligated into the similarly digested eukaryotic expression vector, pVAX1 (Invitrogen, USA). After transformation, clones were picked and validated by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were designated pVAX1-(PEDV-S), pVAX1-(PEDV-S1) and pVAX1-(IL-18), respectively.
