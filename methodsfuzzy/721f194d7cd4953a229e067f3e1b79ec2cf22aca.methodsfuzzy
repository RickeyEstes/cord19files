The term ''focused ethnography'' describes a qualitative research approach employed when what is sought is an explication of behaviour or beliefs pertaining to a specific area so that their meaning among a defined group of individuals might be understood [23] . In focused ethnography, research is not directed towards a culture but rather a particular subculture or group of participants that share some feature or features [23] . This method is used when research questions are best responded to through descriptive analysis and interpretation [23] .
