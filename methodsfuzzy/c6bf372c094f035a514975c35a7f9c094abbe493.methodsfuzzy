The following experiments were conducted to confirm this principle. First, we investigated the effect of the added amount of PEI on this precipitation titration ( Figure 3A ). Oligo DNA probes for lambda DNA were captured in the precipitate when 0.2 to 1 µmol of PEI was added to 25 µL of LAMP reaction solution for lambda DNA. If the amount of PEI added is too high or too low relative to the optimal range, the PEI-DNA complex precipitate is not formed, resulting in oligo DNA probes remaining in the solution. This phenomenon is characteristic in ionic interaction between cationic polymers and anionic polymers [14] . Namely, when the amount of the cationic polymer PEI is too low, the PEI-DNA complex becomes anionic. In contrast, when the amount of PEI is too high, the PEI-DNA complex becomes cationic. In both cases, the PEI-DNA complex is solubilized as a result. This characteristic, which is shown in Figure 3A , indicates that this precipitation titration is based on neutralization of the negative electric charge of the DNA by the cationic polymer PEI. In the case of LAMP negative, a small amount of free probe was deposited under certain conditions when 0.4 µmol to 0.8 µmol of PEI was added as a monomer (< 20%). However, the amount of precipitate in this case was so small that it was impossible to confirm it visually. On the other hand, when LAMP products (PSA) unrelated to the probe sequence were present, no free probe at all was deposited. This is because almost all of the PEI molecules added were consumed in the precipitation of unrelated LAMP products, an excess of which was present relative to the amount of probe. In other words, more reliable detection is achieved by first confirming whether the LAMP reaction has occurred by checking whether white DNA-PEI complex precipitate is generated as a result of addition of PEI and then determining for which nucleic acid template the LAMP reaction occurred based on the fluorescent color of the precipitate. Because of the above results, the amount of PEI added was fixed at 0.2 µmol for the following experiments in order to avoid generation of free probe precipitate as much as possible. We investigated the effect of the Mw of PEI on this detection system ( Figure 3B ). When PEI with different Mw was added to the LAMP solution so that the amount per monomer of each was the same, we found that sufficient BF separation occurred if LAMP amplicons were present, even if the Mw of PEI increased up to 10,000. That is, the fluorescence intensity of the supernatant of LAMP solution with specific amplification (lambda DNA) is lower than that with unrelated amplification (PSA). As the Mw of PEI increased, however, almost all probes in LAMP reaction negative solution formed an insoluble PEI-oligo DNA complex. This result means that the LAMP reaction negative solution cannot be distinguished from the LAMP reaction positive solution, which successfully amplifies the targeting sequence if PEI with a high molecular weight is used. As was also observed in Figure 3A , when LAMP amplicons are present, almost all of the added PEI reacts with LAMP amplicons, so there is little opportunity for interaction with free oligo DNA probes, but when LAMP amplicons are not present, all of the added PEI interacts with oligo DNA probes. Under conditions where a large amount of PEI with a high molecular weight can strongly interact with oligo DNA, an undesirable insoluble PEIoligo DNA probe complex forms because the molecular weight of PEI is high. Therefore, the average molecular weight of PEI in this detection system should be about 600. We conducted a similar experiment using spermine, which is a polyamine with a lower molecular weight. In that experiment, an adequate amount of insoluble complex was not generated compared with PEI of an average molecular weight of 600 under conditions used for the present research (data not shown). It is well known that spermine can also make DNA insoluble, as indicated in many other reports [10] . Therefore, optimal conditions in the case of spermine as a precipitant might exist, but since further investigation would have gone beyond the scope of this paper, no further investigation was carried out. Insolubilization of LAMP products by PEI was inhibited by addition of an excessive amount of KCl to the LAMP reaction solution after amplification ( Figure 3C ). This was because excessive amounts of potassium ions and chloride ions inhibited the electrostatic interaction between DNA and PEI. This finding is further indication that this detection method is based on neutralization of the negative electric charge of DNA by the positive electric charge of PEI. The effect of ionic strength on the LAMP reaction has been investigated and found that the presence of 200 mM or more of KCl markedly delayed the LAMP reaction (data not shown). Therefore, it can be said that this detection method will function without trouble if the solution used has a composition that is optimized for the LAMP reaction. We investigated the sensitivity of this detection method ( Figure 3D ). Almost all probes were taken up by the precipitate in the case of up to 1 µg of LAMP product. Moreover, we were able to visualize the fluorescence in the precipitate even if the specific LAMP product was 0.2 µg. We found that this detection system was sensitive enough as a detection system for visual assessment to be used in simple g-POCT devices. We can see from the results shown in Figure 3C that all of the 1 pmol of probe added hybridized to 1 µg (= 3 nmol nucleotide) of LAMP product. In other words, one molecule of probe bound to every 1,500 base pairs of LAMP products. The LAMP product is a mixture of products of several different sizes, with an average molecular size of 2 kbp [1]. This finding that one molecule of probe binds to every 1,500 base pairs reflects well the fundamental characteristic of this LAMP reaction.
