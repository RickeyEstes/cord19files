The risk posed to susceptible animals following parturition or abortion of infected cattle depends on three factors: • Number of organisms excreted • Survival of these organisms under the existing environmental conditions • Probability of susceptible animals being exposed to enough organisms to establish infection The organism achieves its greatest numbers in the contents of the pregnant uterus, the fetus, and the fetal membranes, all of which must be considered as major sources of infection. The numbers of organisms in the tissues of two naturally infected cows and their fetuses were as follows: umbilicus 2.4 × 10 8 − 4.3 × 10 9 /g − 1.4 × 10 13 /g. This illustrates the potentially large numbers of organisms that can be shed and to which other animals and humans are potentially exposed. However, the numbers of organisms decrease when uterine discharges are cultured at sequential parturitions, and a substantial number of uterine samples from infected cows are culture negative at the second and third parturition following challenge. Virus is produced rapidly after infection, probably within 12 hours. The virus was shown to evolve continuously in infected pigs with different genes of the viral genome undergoing various degrees of change. There are unlikely to be any wildlife reservoirs (except for feral and wild pigs), although infected mallard can still excrete the virus 39 days later. Most pigs clear PRRSV within 3 to 4 months but some may remain persistently infected for several months. The antibody response does not reflect the carrier status. It is possible that cytokines can switch the balance from a subclinical infection to disease manifestation. There is no evidence that PRRSV is found in the tonsils as a representative tissue. The virus spreads rapidly within herds when infected pigs are housed in confinement. Up to 90% of sows may seroconvert within 3 months of the virus being introduced into a closed breeding herd. The mode of spread is presumed to be by direct contact, probably nose to nose. The virus generally requires close pig-to-pig contact to achieve an exposure dose. There are two routes of infection of cattle. The dog is the definitive host of N. caninum. Infection of cattle can occur via the ingestion of oocytes from dog feces contaminating feed or water. However, vertical (i.e., congenital) transmission occurs in both cattle and dogs, and vertical transmission appears the major route for infection in most cattle. 1-3 Live-born calves from congenitally infected cows are themselves congenitally infected; the infection is thought to be persistent and lifelong. A study conducted on two dairies found 81% of seropositive cows gave birth to congenitally infected calves. 1 Seroprevalence did not increase with cow age and was stable through the study period. The probability of a calf being congenitally infected was not associated with dam age, dam lactation number, dam history of abortion, calf gender, or length of gestation. Other studies have shown that this route of transmission is highly efficient, resulting in infection of 50% to 95% of the progeny of seropositive dams. Congenital infection can result in abortion or the birth of a "normal, " infected calf, and an infected cow can give birth to a clinically normal, infected calf at one pregnancy and abort in the subsequent pregnancy. 2, 3 The occurrence of infection in some herds can be associated with specific family lines. Although vertical transmission is the major route of infection that leads to sporadic abortions in cattle associated with N. caninum, epidemiologic evidence suggests that postnatal (point) infection is often the cause of outbreaks of abortion. Where dog feces are the source of infection, many cattle are often exposed, and this point source of infection commonly results in outbreaks of abortion. Farm dogs have been shown to have a higher seroprevalence to N. caninum than urban dogs, suggesting that neosporosis cycles between cattle and dogs in rural environments. 4 The importance of postnatal infection versus vertical infection in the genesis of abortion may vary among countries, and be associated with differences in farm management systems. 4 Natural transmission occurs only by coitus, but infection can also be acquired through intact oral, nasal, and conjunctival mucosae in foals at birth. The source of infection may be an infected stallion or mare actively discharging trypanosomes from the urethra or vagina, or an uninfected male acting as a physical carrier after serving an infected mare. The trypanosomes inhabit the urethra and vagina but disappear periodically so that only a proportion of potentially infective matings result in infection. Invasion occurs through intact mucosa, and no abrasion is necessary.
