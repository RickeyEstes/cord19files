Although bulky and often cumbersome, negative-pressure ventilators such as the so-called iron lung are still used in some countries. 89 Non-invasive ventilation nowadays almost always consists of positive pressure delivered to the upper airway via a mask or other interface, and uses diff erent physiological principles, dependent on the mode of delivery. During CPAP, a constant positive pressure is applied to raise functional residual capacity and open fl ooded alveoli in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. CPAP can lessen left ventricular transmural pressure, reducing afterload and increasing cardiac output, providing an additional rationale for use in the treatment of such patients. 30, 31 CPAP can also be given via a helmet, which can cause diffi culties with synchrony between the patient and ventilator when used with forms of positive-pressure ventilation that need triggering by the patient. 90
