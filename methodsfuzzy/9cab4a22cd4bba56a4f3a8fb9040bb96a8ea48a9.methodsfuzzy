Cell culture and cells. The murine OP9 stromal cell line (CRL-2749) and the human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line RS4;11 (CRL-1873) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Human pre-B ALLs in this study including TXL2, US7, US7R, LAX56, LAX57, ICN3, ICN12, and ICN13 have been previously described (US7, US7R, TXL2 51-54 ; LAX56, LAX57 55 , ICN3, ICN13 52 ). Leukemia cells were co-cultured with irradiated, mitotically inactivated OP9 cells in MEM-Î± medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). All human specimen collection protocols were reviewed and approved by the Children's Hospital Los Angeles Institution Review Board (IRB) [Committee on Clinical Investigations] (CCI). Samples were collected after obtaining a written informed consent and/or as leftover specimens that were initially collected for clinical diagnostic purposes and were discarded as medical waste when no longer needed for clinical purposes. All specimens were de-identified/anonymized before acquisition for research. Collections and experiments were performed in accordance with IRB guidelines, regulations, and approvals. After red blood cell lysis, mononuclear cells were collected by Ficoll centrifugation and immediately analyzed, or viably frozen. For isolation of normal human CD19 + CD10+ pre-B precursors, viably frozen CD34-depleted CD19+ enriched normal human bone marrow samples were thawed and processed with a Release Human CD19 Positive Selection Kit and Human CD10 Positive Selection Kit (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada).
