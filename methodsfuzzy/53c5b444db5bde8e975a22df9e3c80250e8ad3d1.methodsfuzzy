The admission rectal temperature, heart and respiratory rates, mucous membrane color, capillary refill time, and fecal consistency were recorded. Mucous membrane color was considered abnormal if the medical record indicated the presence of a toxic line, hyperemia, or purple or pale mucous membranes; pink was considered normal. The capillary refill time was considered abnormal if >2 seconds. Fecal character was considered abnormal if the medical record described the feces as soft, cow-pie, loose, or diarrhea. The hematocrit, total white blood cell count, fibrinogen concentration, platelet count, and, where available, results of a manual differential cell count were collected and laboratory reference ranges used for data analysis. The serum total protein, albumin and globulin concentrations, gamma-glutamyl transferase activity, and bilirubin, creatinine, sodium, and potassium concentrations were recorded and laboratory reference ranges used for data analysis. On the occasion that fecal diagnostic testing occurred during hospitalization for an unrelated event, laboratory analysis and physical examination variables were included from the event that prompted fecal diagnostic testing according to the infectious disease policy or discretion of the attending clinician. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism v7.0c (La Jolla, California). Data were assessed for normality using the D'Agostino-Pearson Omnibus test. For normally distributed data, a 1-way analysis of variance was used to determine differences among groups and a post hoc Tukey's test was used for multiple comparisons. For nonnormally distributed data, a Kruskal-Wallis test with a post hoc Dunn's test for multiple comparisons was used to determine differences among groups. A chi-square test was used to determine seasonal distribution of cases. Fisher's exact test was used to establish likelihood of an abnormal test result, and odds ratios were calculated using the Baptista-Pike method. For all tests, significance was set at P < .05.
