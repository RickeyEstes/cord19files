All specimens, including nasal and throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, and sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, were examined by real-time PCR at the Melbourne Health Shared Pathology Service according to previously published protocols [10, 11] . RVs included in the multiplex PCR panel were RSV, influenza type A and B, and rhinovirus. The testing of copathogens was not part of routine assessment and was performed at the discretion of treating physician. These tests included conventional culture for bacteria and fungi; PCR for Legionella, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and Aspergillus [12] ; viral PCR for herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, HSV-2, CMV, varicella zoster virus, human herpesvirus (HHV)-6, HHV-8, hMPV, and adenovirus; and bacterial PCR for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Chlamydia psittaci. The risk of vRTI was calculated as the number of patients testing positive for any RV among all allo-HSCT recipients. Patients' baseline characteristics were compared by vRTI status using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the Student t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. Only the first episode of vRTI was considered for risk factor analysis. Univariable and multivariable analyses of risk factors for vRTI were performed using logistic regression models. Variables with a P value <.1 were included in the multivariable testing, along with variables previously identified as important risk factors for vRTI, including lymphopenia, GVHD, and donor relation [8, 16, 17] . Patients with vRTI had their records reviewed for 100 days following infection. In patients without vRTI, the review was censored to the date of death/ICU admission or 100 days following transplantation, whichever was sooner. Survival (to death or ICU admission) within 100 days following transplantation was assessed using Kaplan-Meier plots, stratified by vRTI status. The log-rank test was used to assess differences in survival among groups. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.3.1, with statistical significance defined at Î± = .05.
