Several steps are needed to accomplish the above-suggested approach: • The VOCs that can be used for early diagnosis of a viral infection need to be identified. A very sensitive diagnosis is a first requirement for global screening as the goal is to isolate a small potion of the population while maintaining a very high negative predictive value. • An appropriate array of sensors needs to be assembled. These arrays need to contain several sensors that are designed to react selectively with the previously identified VOCs and a wide variety of general, semi-selective (cross-reactive) sensors (Konvalina and Haick, 2013) . The former are used for specific identification of a viral infection but are prone to changes in virus induced exhaled breath profile that may occur over time, due to viral mutations or phenotypic changes. The latter allows for plasticity of the diagnostic algorithm by reacting with unselected VOCs. • An online centralized database, were to breath-prints are uploaded, instantly should be created.
