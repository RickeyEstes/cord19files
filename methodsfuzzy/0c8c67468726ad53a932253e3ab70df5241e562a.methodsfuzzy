The MFSMXA method [40] consists of four steps. Consider two time series {X(i)} and {Y(i)} of the same length N, where i = 1, 2, . . . , N. Step 1: Divide each series into N s = int(N/s) non-overlapping segments of equal length s. For a given segment size s, the elements in the vth segment can be described as: where v = 1, 2, . . . , N s and i = 1, 2, . . . , s. Step 2: For each segment, we define a quantity u as follows, where [(v − 1)s + 1, vs] is the vth segment. The measure μ in each segment is constructed as follows, Step 3: Calculate the statistical moments function F XY (q, s) Step 4: Determine scaling behavior of cross statistical moment functions by analyzing log-log plots of F XY (q, s) versus s for each value of q. We expect it to scale as where the exponent τ XY (q) is a scaling exponent function, regarded as a characteristic function of the fractal behavior. Note that τ XY (0) = −1. For q = 2, the method is used to detect the long-range cross-correlations between series, which we call it cross-correlation analysis based on statistical moments (SMXA). When {X(i)} = {Y (i)}, the above method reduces to the multifractal analysis for separate series (MFSMA) [36] [37] [38] [39] . In light of the relationship of two sets of multifractal scaling exponents, there is an analytic form between τ XY (q) and the generalized bivariate Hurst exponent h XY (q): where D f is the fractal dimension of the geometric support of the multifractal measure and D f = 1 for time series analysis [1] . If q dependence of the scaling exponent τ (q) is nonlinear, there is multifractality in the signal. The singularity strength λ and its spectrum f(λ) related to τ (q) through a Legendre transform [56] can be defined as, If the singularity width λ = λ max − λ min gets close to zero, the series has practically no multifractality. Otherwise, there is a multifratcal nature in the series. According to Ref. [18] , for time series in a standard way, and Further, the left part of Eq. (9) can be rewritten through the definition of covariance: and combining Eqs. (6) and (8), the first part of the right side of Eq. (10) implies i.e, Now consider a new scaling exponent η(q) and relationship holds, which is identical with α(q) = h XX (q)+h YY (q) 2 in Ref. [18] . Otherwise, it does not establish unless covariances do not scale with s. Thus, the importance of long-range cross-correlations and multifractality resides in the scaling of covariances between |μ X (v, s)| q/2 and |μ Y (v, s)| q/2 regarding varying s and q. As a consequence, there are two types of cross-multifractality: (i) crossmultifractality caused by multifractality of the separate series, and (ii) cross-multifractality by scaling of covariances between |μ X (v, s)| q/2 and |μ Y (v, s)| q/2 . It can be noted that in the MFSMXA, the product μ X μ Y of each segment in both sequences contributes to the final function F XY (q, s) equally, but it is rational to make F XY (q, s) be proportional to μ X μ Y in a simplest view. And to a certain extent, the measure μ is kind of frequency or probability. To improve that, we propose a modification of current MFSMXA, called weighted MFSMXA method based on Shannon entropy (W-MFSMXA), to take into account that not all measurements contribute equally when constructing the statistical moments function and to save as much information as possible carried by the series. Specifically, the motivation behind this is to weight proportionally segments with distinct measurements μ but the same final F XY (q, s). [57] to be the weight factor makes sure that μ with higher value is assigned more weights. Furthermore, Shannon entropy as a complexity (or regularity or orderliness) measure quantifies the information richness of μ in series and this novel information-based approach has been successfully employed in literary authorship disputes [50] , SARS coronavirus [51] , biologic signals [52] and financial time series analysis [53] . Therefore, we replace the statistical moments function in step 3 in MFSMXA method with a weighted statistical moments function, which is calculated as follows: where the weighting function ω(v, s) is selected to be the sum of Shannon entropy for the vth segment of series {x(i)} and {y(i)} [50] [51] [52] [53] : and Z is a normalization factor such that Ns Then, same as MFSMXA in the step 4, we expect F It reduces to the long-range cross-correlation analysis in a weighted way for q = 2 (W-SMXA) and the multifractal analysis for individual series when {X(i)}={Y(i)} (W-MFSMA). Note that τ (ω) XY (0) = 0.
