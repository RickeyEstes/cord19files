One of the goals of our experiment was to find a more discriminative and smaller feature set for specific function prediction, based solely on sequence-based features. Therefore, we initially gathered numerous features solely from the protein sequence. The features that were redundant or irrelevant were then removed by feature selection. After feature selection, the remaining number of features was small, while the accuracy of function classification was greater than that of the full-feature set. The selected features and the selection rates for the traditional features and our new features are listed in Tables 3 and 4 . A summary of the performance of the four methods in classifying the 11 protein classes is provided in Table 5 and Figure 1 . Among all the methods, SVM without feature selection (SVM_FF) required more model-building time and had the lowest performance. However, this method did obtain the highest accuracy in two of the blind tests, for translation and fibre proteins (2 of the 11 protein classes). SVM with feature selection (SVM_CFS) slightly outperformed the random forest method with and without feature selection (RF_CFS and RF_FF, respectively) and significantly outperformed SVM_FF. Given that more than one method had equal accuracy for some classes, the SVM_CFS method had the highest accuracy for classifying transcription, acetylcholine receptor inhibitor, G-protein coupled receptor, guanine nucleotide-releasing factor, fibre, and transmembrane proteins (6 of the 11 protein classes). The random forest method without feature selection (RF_FF) had the highest accuracy for the following blind test sets: amino acid biosynthesis, acetylcholine receptor inhibitor, guanine nucleotide-releasing factor, fibre, and transmembrane proteins (5 of the 11 protein classes). The random forest method with feature selection (RF_CFS) had the highest accuracy for classifying trans- port, gluconate utilisation, amino acid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and acetylcholine receptor inhibitor proteins (5 of the 11 protein classes). Although both the RF_FF and RF_CFS methods had the highest accuracy for five protein classes, the performance of the RF_CFS method was better than that of the RF_FF method in terms of cost-effectiveness because a reduced-dimensional model was produced. After careful analysis of the selected feature subsets and their performance in these experiments, the use of feature selection was found to improve classifier performance, as indicated in Table 5 and Figure 1 . Although the accuracy of the random forest method was not significantly improved by feature selection, the AUC value for RF_CFS was slightly higher than that for RF_FF, except for the amino acid biosynthesis, acetylcholine receptor inhibitor, and G-protein coupled receptor classes. The larger the AUC, the better is the performance of the model. By comparing the AUCs averaged over all 11 protein classes, the RF_CFS method was found to outperform the other methods (i.e. 0.995). Therefore, applying CFS to the dataset yielded improved performance and a more compact set of features. For a more detailed evaluation of all the methods, several performance measures were applied. Detailed results for each method are presented in Tables 6, 7, 8, and 9 , with a focus on sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, and MCC. The consistent performance of each method for predicting the protein functions of the 11 protein classes in both the 10fold cross-validation test and the blind test demonstrates Area under the ROC curves for the four methods for each protein class Figure 1 Area under the ROC curves for the four methods for each protein class. the validity of our methods: SVM_FF, ± 3.0; SVM_CFS, ± 2.1; RF_FF ± 1.8; and RF_CFS, ± 1.2 (± refers to the difference in accuracy between the training step and the blind test step). These results indicate that our models have good predictive power in discriminative testing processes. Although good performance with the proposed new features was obtained using feature selection, we performed an additional experiment to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed features in a clear and simple way, without relying on feature selection. The additional experiments were carried out using the 451 traditional features versus the 33 proposed features under the same conditions as the above experiments, and the performance of classification was compared (Tables 10 and 11 ). In the performance comparison with SVM, classification using only the 33 proposed features outperformed the 451 traditional features for 5 of the 11 protein classes (transport, amino acid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, G-protein coupled receptor, and transmembrane). In the performance comparison with the random forest method, classification using only the 33 proposed features was superior or equal to use of the 451 traditional features for 4 of the 11 protein classes (translation, gluconate utilisation, fatty acid metabolism, and acetylcholine receptor inhibitor).
