Analytical solutions of nanomechanical sensing are available for a simple cantilever model. For example, the deflection of the freeend of a cantilever ( z) induced by isotropic internal strain in a receptor layer (ε f ) is given by the following equation (Yoshikawa, 2011) : where l is the length of a cantilever, and E f (E c ), ν f (ν c ), and t f (t c ) are the Young's modulus, the Poisson's ratio, and the thickness of a receptor layer (a cantilever), and w c and w f are the width of a cantilever and a receptor layer, respectively. If a cantilever is covered with a very thin receptor layer (t c ≫ t f and w c = w f ), Equation (1) reduces to the following equation, which is known as the Stoney's equation (Stoney, 1909) : where σ surf is the surface stress defined as σ surf = σ f · t f , and σ f = ε f · E f / 1 − ν f . However, the application of these models is limited to analytically simple problems. To investigate more complex systems, FEA is an effective option, providing numerical solutions. Since the adsorption of particles on a solid receptor layer with three dimensional stress distribution is too complicated to be analytically modeled, we employed FEA in the present study. FEA simulations were performed in COMSOL Multiphysics 5.1 R with the Structural Mechanics module. Each structure was meshed with 20,000∼60,000 elements, which give sufficient resolution for the present simulations. We investigated the deflection of a silicon cantilever with dimensions 500 × 100 × 1 µm as shown in Figure 1A . A fixed constraint was applied on one end (fixed-end). The receptor layer with a thickness of t µm is coated on the cantilever. A particle with a radius of 0.1 µm is embedded in the receptor layer with a depth of h µm, applying a constant pressure p Pa at the interface ( Figure 1B) . To simulate such a situation, we set a dent on the receptor layer with a boundary load of p Pa at the surface. The dent is located at l µm from the fixed-end. We investigated the deflection; the displacement of the free-end of the cantilever ( Figure 1C ). In the case of MSS, the diameter and the thickness of the membrane are set at 500 and 2.5 µm, respectively, with a t-µmthick receptor layer on it (Figure 2A) . The dent is also placed on the receptor layer (default position is set at the center) to simulate the adsorption of a particle. We investigated the change in the relative resistance ( R tot /R tot ) of a full Wheatstone bridge in an MSS composed of four resistors embedded in the sensing beams, R 1 -R 4 ( Figure 2B ). The sensing signal, V out is approximately described as: where V B is the bridge voltage, and R i is the change in the resistance of R i . A fixed constraint was applied on the end of each beam.
