Sequence, database and structure analysis. The lambda Lc constant domain (Cλ) sequence from a selected in-house human lambda IgG1 (hereafter referred to as λ) antibody was used in a BLAST database search. 51 PDB ID:1AQK, PDB ID:2G75 and Accession ID:AAA02915 sequences containing hIgG1λ have been selected. 31, 32 Representative kappa Lc constant domain (Cκ) sequences from PDB ID:1Y0L and PDB ID:3QOS were chosen directly from PDB database. 29, 33, 52 These sequences were aligned and compared using Clustal W server. 53 disulfide bond, the dS mutation was incorporated into another hIgG1λ antibody of distinctive VL, VH and Cλ domains. Preliminary data from tests of stability to both temperature and pH demonstrate clearly similar improvement in the dS molecules relative to the native IgG1λ (unpublished data). These data from the additional hIgG1λ suggest that the enhanced stability of Lc-Hc disulfide bond, through the deletion of the trailing serine residue in hIgG1λ, might be generalizable. Moreover, although the differences in stability between λ and κ antibodies in this report could originate from the sequence differences in these VL-VH pairs, our recent data using two hIgG1s with variation only in the Cλ and Cκ region, confirm that variation in Cλ is sufficient to induce a less stable Lc-Hc disulfide bond at high pH (unpublished data). This further validates that the negative effect of the terminal serine on the stability of the disulfide bond in Cλ is conserved with little to no influence from the variable regions. The observed enhancement in the transient expression yield of λdS that resulted from the serine deletion may be the outcome of more efficient secretion of the whole IgG. It is known that the Lc has to displace the chaperone BiP, which associates with the Hc in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), to form the final LHHL complex that allows for the secretion of intact antibody. 45 Since the native λ Lc has a weaker disulfide bond interaction between the Lc and the Hc, compared with the λ Lc with the serine deletion, more unassembled native λ Lc can be retained in the ER by forming covalent complexes with microsomal proteins. 46 For the dS mutant, we hypothesize based on our study that better association between Lc and Hc through improved disulfide bond interaction during the assembly process in the ER may lead to more properly assembled LHHL IgG1 complex and a higher secretion level. One initial consideration for a noted increase in ADCC activity observed with the dS mutant is an increase in antibody binding to FcγR. From a recent report, an H229Y mutation in the upper hinge of the Hc from a human IgG1 antibody improved both the stability and the ADCC function (by 3-fold) by preventing cleavage of the Hc-Hc disulfide bond through radical-induced degradation. 28 The enhancement of ADCC activity by the H229Y is correlated with a higher affinity for FcγR. 28 Unlike the H229Y mutant, λdS did not show improved binding to FcγRIIIa V158, FcγRIIIa F158 or FcγRIa by ELISA compared with the native IgG (data not shown). Nevertheless, the serine deletion mutant demonstrated enhanced ADCC activity. The improvement in ADCC activity resulting from the deletion of the terminal serine was interesting and unexpected. This suggests that the increase in ADCC activity resulting from the serine deletion in the λ Lc is operating through mechanisms different from the mutation in the upper hinge region of the Hc. The discrepancy between the results from binding and ADCC assays in our study might be due to differences in the assay formats. It is hypothesized that a conformational change in the hinge region induced by the deletion of serine could affect the FcγR binding site only upon binding to both cell surface antigen and cell surface FcγR, which occur only in the ADCC assay, but not in the ELISA binding assay. This hypothesis was partially corroborated by our effector cell activation data where λdS induced a greater increase in DNA/fectin complex, and incubated at 37°C for 6 d. Antibody expression levels in culture supernatant were determined using the Octet protein A biosensor (Pall, Octet). Harvested cell culture supernatant containing recombinant λ IgG or λdS IgG was loaded onto MabSelect SuRe protein A (GE Health Care, 17-5474-01), pre-equilibrated with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen) at pH 7.2. The column bed volume was 1.0 ml and operated under gravity flow. The antibody was eluted using 100 mM citrate buffer, pH 2.9 or pH 3.1. The protein A elution pool was held at room temperature for one hour. Finally, the elution pool was neutralized to pH 7.0 with 2 M Tris base solution. Antibody concentrations in partially purified solutions were determined by the absorbance at 280 nm, using the Nanodrop system (Thermo Scientific). Thermal challenge assay. Fifteen μg of each λ, λdS, λA211G and λP210R was prepared with PBS and NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen, NP0007) in a total volume of 20 ul. The mixtures were then incubated for 15 min at different temperatures: 25°C (room temperature, RT), 40°C, 50°C, 60°C, 70°C, 80°C and 90°C using a thermocycler (Eppendorf). The treated samples were loaded onto 4-12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen, NP0321Box) and subjected to electrophoresis at 140 V for 1 h. The gels were then stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen, LC6060) and scanned using an Alpha Imager (ProteinSimple). To estimate the intact IgG ratios for native λ, λ P210R, λ A211G and λdS under different temperatures, densitometric analysis was performed for all bands and the band representing the fully assembled IgG (LHHL) was quantified after subtraction of the background density for each lane using Photoshop (Adobe). The intact IgG ratio = Intensity (LHHL)/Intensity (all bands) was then calculated and plotted vs. temperature. A higher intact IgG ratio at the same temperature corresponded to increased thermal stability of the inter-chain disulfide bond in the specific mutant. pH stability assay. The antibody samples (1 mg/ml) were prepared by mixing 20 μl of each antibody, λ (human IgG1λ), λdS or a human IgG1κ antibody, at 1.25 mg/ml with 5 μl of 5 × sample buffer containing 500 mM buffer solution, such as sodium acetate (pH 3.0), sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) or sodium phosphate (pH 10.0), 10% SDS and 500 mM iodoacetamide (IAM) (acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, HCl and IAM, all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich). Antibody samples were incubated at 70°C for 30 min in varying pHs and then held at 25°C for 30 min. The treated samples were separated on 4-12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen, NP0321Box). The gels were stained by SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen, LC6060) and scanned with an Alpha Imager (ProteinSimple). ADCC assays. Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Roche, 11644793001) was used to characterize the ADCC activity. The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity from the lysed targeted cells (A431 transfected with receptor target X, A431x) was monitored in the presence freshly isolated normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC, AllCells, PB002) upon the treatment with λ or λdS antibody. 2 × 10 4 cells were seeded in each well of 96-well round-bottom plates in 50 μl of assay medium, containing RPMI 1640 with 1% BSA and 100 units/ml A database search was performed to obtain a complete list of ordered Lc-Hc disulfide bond structural parameters of human IgG1 X-ray crystal structures from the Disulfide Bond Analysis database, 34 which curates detailed structural information of disulfide bonds from all protein structures in PDB. To generate a restricted Lc-Hc disulfide bond subset of the database for human IgG1, the following criteria were applied to the Disulfide Bond Analysis database: (1) Restrict the selection to "Immune System" for header column; (2) Limit the resolution to better than 3 Å; (3) Remove the entries that contain Lc dimers; (4) Select the disulfide bond with the residue number of cysteine between 200-250. The advantage of subsetting the original Disulfide Bond Analysis database is that all the PDB entries selected have a complete Lc-Hc disulfide bond already, in comparison to a search directly against PDB. The final hIgG1 Lc-Hc disulfide bond database contains 1 hIgG1λ Fab sequence and 12 hIgG1κ Fab sequences. Disulfide bond strain energy and bond distance were obtained directly from the Disulfide Bond Analysis database. 34 The average B factor per residue for cysteines (equivalent to C215 in PDB 1AQK) and glutamic acids (equivalent to E214 in 1AQK) for these 13 CLs were calculated for comparison. The Chi1 torsion angle for every Cλ or Cκ cysteine involved in interchain disulfide bond was calculated using program Coot. 37 The deviation (ΔChi1) of each cysteine Chi1 from the closest Chi1 reported from a rotamer database from Coot was also calculated and compared. The crystal structures of PDB ID:1AQK Cλ was selected as a representative structure for our in-house λ antibody given the high sequence identity in Cλ. PDB ID:1Y0L Cκ was selected only as a reference molecule for comparison. The selected entries were superimposed within their CH1 domains using DaliLite, 54 and illustrated in cartoon and stick representation using program Pymol. 38 Site-directed mutagenesis and ELISA. λdS, λ A211G and λ P210R were generated with the QuickChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, 210518) following the manufacturer's manual, using the hIgG1λ construct as the template. ELISA plates (Immulon 2HB Thermoscientific, 3455) were coated with recombinant soluble antigen X in PBS at 1 μg/ml 4°C overnight and then blocked in PBST (0.2% Tween20 in PBS) buffer with 3% non-fat milk at room temperature for 1 h. Plates were then washed three times with PBST and 100 μl of serially diluted antibody in PBS added to blocked ELISA plates and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, followed by three washes in PBST. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 100 μl of the blocking buffer containing goat anti-human F(ab') 2 IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 109-035-006). After the wash, the plates were developed using TMB peroxidase substrate (KPL, 50-76-02), and read at the absorbance of 450 nm. Analysis of expression and purification. Human embryonic kidney 293-Freestyle (HEK 293F) cells (Invitrogen) were cultivated and transfected according to manufacturer's instruction in suspension shake flask cultures. Briefly, uncut plasmid DNA harboring λ IgG and λdS IgG expression constructs were mixed with 293 fectin and allowed to complex for 25 min. HEK 293F cells were re-suspended in fresh medium, combined with cell activation = maximal RLU/background RLU. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). In vivo PK study. Female CD-1 mice, aged 7-8 weeks, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions in microisolator cages with laboratory chow and water available ad libitum. All animal research methods were approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in accordance with the United States Department of Agriculture and the National Institute of Health policies regarding the humane care and use of laboratory animals. After one week of acclimatization, the mice were randomized, grouped and injected with 20 mg/kg of transiently expressed, purified λ IgG and λdS IgG intraperitoneally (IP). Three mice were bled prior to dosing to establish t = 0 plasma levels. Three mice per time-point were bled for plasma at t = 6 h, and on 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 d after dosing for each λ or λdS group. EDTA plasma samples were collected and stored at -80°C until the concentrations were evaluated with a standard anti-human Fc binding ELISA. Briefly, the Immunlon plates (VWR, 62402-972) were coated with goat anti-human Fc IgG (Sigma, I2136). Serial diluted IgG standards and plasma samples were incubated with the coated plates followed by the detection with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti human Fc IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 109-035-098). PK parameters were calculated utilizing noncompartmental analysis with WinNonLin software (Pharsight). PK parameters were calculated based on 24-672 h time points for all groups.
