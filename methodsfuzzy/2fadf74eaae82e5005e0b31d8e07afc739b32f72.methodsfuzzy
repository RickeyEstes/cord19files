Three kinds of SARS CoV strains: HKU39849 [1] , TW-1 and FFM-1 [2] and their cDNAs were used. S, M, N or E cDNA was transferred into pcDNA 3.1(+) vector [4] . PBL from healthy human volunteers were administered i.p. into IL-2 receptor ␥-chain disrupted NOD SCID mice [IL-2R(−/−) NOD-SCID], and SCID-PBL/hu mice were constructed [4] . pcDNA 3.1(+) vector, 50 g each, containing SARS S, M, N, or E DNA was injected i.m. into SCID-PBL/hu three times, at an interval of 7 days. Neutralizing antibodies against SARS CoV in the serum from the mice were assayed by use of Vero-E6 cell. CTL activity against SARS CoV was studied using human cells, expressing SARS antigens. CTL activity of human CD8-positive lymphocytes in the spleen from SCID-PBL/hu was assessed using 51Cr-release assay [5, 6] . Human monoclonal antibodies were produced from B cell hybridoma using P3U1 myeloma cell and spleen cells from human immunoglobulin transchromosomic mice (KM mice) [7] .
