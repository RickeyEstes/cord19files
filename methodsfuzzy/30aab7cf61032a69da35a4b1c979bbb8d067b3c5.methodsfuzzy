A schematic diagram of the experimental system is shown in Fig. 1 . The viral aerosol was generated by nebulizing the virus suspension at a flow rate of 6 LPM using a six-jet Collison nebulizer (Model CN25, BGI Inc., Waltham, MA). The aerosol flow was mixed with dry air in a dilution drier to remove the moisture, and entered either the cBAU or mBAU for particle amplification. In the cBAU, the aerosol flow rate was 12.5 LPM and the temperatures of aerosol flow at the heating and cooling tubes were maintained at 35 and 20 1C, respectively. The RH of the aerosol flow at the exit of the heating tube was monitored by an RH sensor (Model HX94C, OMEGA Engineering Inc., Stamford, CT) and maintained above 90%. In the mBAU, the aerosol and the saturated air flow rates were 8.5 and 4 LPM, respectively, and the temperature of the saturated air varied from 55 to 75 1C. Amplified viral aerosol from the BAU was collected by an SKC Biosampler at a total flow rate of 12.5 L/min. DI water (15 mL) was used as the collection medium, and the sampling period was set at 15 min to minimize the effect of reaerosolization in the sampler (Riemenschneider et al., 2009) . A plaque assay technique (Adams, 1959) was used to measure virus concentrations in the collection medium, using Escherichia coli as the host bacterium. Details of the MS2 culture method have been reported by Lee et al. (2009) . To evaluate efficacy of the BAU, changes in viral collection efficiency of the Biosampler were determined as a factor multiplying collection efficiency (FCE) by comparing PFUs in the collection media with and without the BAU operation: The BAU-off conditions were accomplished by maintaining flows but turning off heat pumps and the hot water reservoir heater. Also, growth of particles was determined by comparing particle size distributions (PSDs) before and after the BAU using an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS, Model 3321, TSI, Inc., St. Paul, MN). In addition, changes in PSD going through the BAU were measured for particle-free air and for aerosols generated by nebulizing DI water and polystyrene latex (PSL) particle suspension. A 100-ppm suspension of 30-nm PSL particles (3030A, Duke Scientific, Palo Alto, CA) was used for the PSL aerosol generation. This set of experiments was conducted to obtain confirmatory evidence of particle growth in the BAU.
