We have outlined an approach to forecasting seasonal influenza that relies on modern ensemble data assimilation methods for updating a prior distribution of a disease transmission model. The method used a dynamic compartmental model of influenza spread that has been used in previous research [51, 52, 54] but is applicable to any compartmental model of disease with a regularly updated public health data source. Though the flu forecasting system we have presented here is not ready to entirely base public health policy on, the methods provide a valuable framework. In particular, this framework provides real-time model testing, model dependent prior estimation, evaluation of probabilistic disease forecasting, and transitioning from a deterministic model to a probabilistic forecast. Moreover, if prior to the peak our model predicts an unexpected change in the future number of cases, then this is an indication to public health decision makers that the model may be picking up on hidden events and trends that are being missed by more traditional statistical prediction methods. In this regard, the model forecast is similar to having another expert viewpoint available during the decision process that can identify trends that might have otherwise been missed. We evaluated the accuracy of our forecast using the M-distance, based on the Gaussian likelihood of observations, and the deviation of time series of quantiles for a set of quantities of interest arising from flu dynamics. Both of these methods were used on our data assimilation Forecasts for the size of the ILI peak were widely varying in the 90% credible interval. This could possibly be reduced by the elimination of high peak outliers such as the 2009 H1N1 emergence and through adjustment of low forecasts in our prior. However, even with these draw backs the 50% credible region has a width of only 1%-2%. approach and on a much simpler forecast using estimated normal distributions. The application of these measures of accuracy, combined with our specific approach to data assimilation with a dynamic model of the influenza dynamics allowed us to highlight model inaccuracies that can then be improved in the future. Though a statistically simple tool, the inclusion of a straw man forecast as a baseline to evaluate our data assimilation scheme's usefulness is indispensable when evaluating measures of accuracy. Especially for some measures, such as the M-distance, it is difficult to tell whether or not a value implies the forecast performed well without a baseline. We hope that the approach of measuring a forecast against a baseline becomes established practice in future developments of epidemic forecasting. The differential equation representation of influenza dynamics, modeled proportions of the population as susceptible, exposed/non-infectious, symptomatic/infectious, and recovered/immune/removed. The model did not allow for any re-infection of influenza, which is thought to be biologically accurate for at least a single strain of flu in a single season [56] . We also modeled the effect of heterogeneity in the influenza contact network and seasonal variation in the transmissibility of flu. Our method of data assimilation adjusted the allowable parameterizations and initializations of this model as ILI data became available. The forecast was made up of actual realizations of our S Î½ EIR model used. This has the arguable advantage of highlighting observed sections of the ILI data stream that differ drastically from the model's assumptions. However, since the model state is not adjusted at each ILI data point directly, the forecast with an incorrect model eventually diverges from the data. To iteratively update the prior distributions of parameterizations and initializations, we used an ensemble Kalman smoother. This was observed to significantly pull the model toward a subset of parameterizations and initializations that agreed well with the data. Since the model seemed to be reasonably adjusted toward observations and retained a significant amount of ensemble variation in the forecast, there is strong evidence that the assimilation scheme works well. The challenge now is to arrive at a model that more accurately represents influenza dynamics perhaps by including considerations made in [53, [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . Our quantitative measure of forecast accuracy is motivated by the Gaussian likelihood function and has been used, in many instances, to assign a value to the distance from some predicted distribution with a fixed mean and covariance. This is exactly the setting we are in, when we make the Gaussian assumptions inherent in the Kalman filter methods. The application of the M-distance in this instance showed that our model performed better than the simple straw man forecast in the beginning of the season but then systematically diverged from the late season ILI data. Besides demonstrating the accuracy of our forecast at capturing overall dynamics, we also quantified our forecating method's ability to accurately estimate quantities of interest relating to the impact of a given influenza season. We showed how the time series of forecast median and posterior credible intervals for the season's start week, peak week, duration, and peak level changed over time. This measure in particular demonstrated the advantages of having an underlying mechanistic model as compared to the purely statistical normal approximation forecast as used in the straw man forecast.
