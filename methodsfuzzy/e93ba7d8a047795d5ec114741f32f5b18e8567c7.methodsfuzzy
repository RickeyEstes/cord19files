Specifically, we transform titers based on the formula y=log2(x/5) where x is the measured titer, which results in a 0 for undetectable titers and a 1 unit rise in titer for each 2-fold increase (so 10=1, 20=2, 40=3, etc.). In figures, measures are transformed back to the arithmetic scale for clarity; but all statistics are presented on this scale. Geometric mean titer (GMT) was calculated as the mean of log-titer and transformed back to the .

Age at baseline sampling is defined as the time difference between the year of baseline and the year of birth; age at isolation is calculated as the year when the tested strain was isolated minus the year of birth of the participant.
