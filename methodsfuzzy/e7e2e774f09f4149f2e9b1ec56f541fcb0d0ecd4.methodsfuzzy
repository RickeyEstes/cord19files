Plasmid construction, protein transient expression and purification. Genes encoding a 193-amino acid (residues 318-510) RBD of SARS-CoV S protein were amplified by PCR using the plasmid containing the codon-optimized full-length S protein as the template [12, 13] , followed by insertion into the GS gene expression vector PEE14.1. The recombinant RBD plasmid was transiently transfected using fection, and culture supernatant was collected 72 h later, followed by purifying recombinant proteins using His columns (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purified protein was designated as RBD193-CHO. Establishment of stable cell lines expressing RBD193-CHO protein. The recombinant RBD plasmid was transfected into CHO-K1 cells as above. Twenty-four hours later, culture medium was changed into fresh glutamine-free DMEM (SAFC Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) containing 10% dialyzed FBS (dFBS, Invitrogen), 1Â glutamine synthetase (GS) supplement (SAFC Biosciences) and 25 lM L-methionine sulfoximine (MSX) selective agent (Chemicon, Billerica, MA). Fresh selective medium was replaced every 3-4 days thereafter until the appearance of resistant colonies, which were then picked and expanded to culture for protein expression detection by Western blot and ELISA. The established CHO-K1 stable cell line expressing RBD193-CHO protein was adapted to EX-CELL302 CHO serum-free medium according to the manufacturer's protocol (SAFC Biosciences) to facilitate large-scale recombinant protein expression. Further purification of the RBD protein was performed using the conditioned suspension culture medium. Western blot. The purified RBD193-CHO protein was tested for expression by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot according to the protocol previously described [14] . The blots were detected by a panel of RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated in our laboratory [7] at the final concentration of 0.5 lg/ml. Mouse vaccination and sample collection. Each of five female BALB/c mice was subcutaneously (s.c.) vaccinated with RBD193-CHO protein according to the protocol previously described [15] , with 20 lg/mouse of purified protein containing Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA, Sigma) for the prime and 10 lg/mouse of immunogen containing Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA, Sigma) for two subsequent boosts at 3-week intervals. PBS was used as the negative control. Ten days post-last vaccination, mouse sera were collected and assayed to detect specific IgG and neutralizing antibody responses, while splenocytes were assayed to determine cellular responses. Ten days post-last vaccination, mice were also challenged with live SARS-CoV, and at 5 days post-challenge, detection for viral replication was performed. ELISA. A previously described ELISA protocol [15] was used for the selection of CHO-K1 cells stably expressing RBD193-CHO protein and for the detection of RBD-specific IgG antibody in protein-vaccinated mouse sera. For protein expression detection, 96well microtiter plates were pre-coated with CHO-K1 cell culture supernatant, and SARS-CoV RBD-specific mAb 33G4 (1:2000 dilution) [7] was added after washing with PBST. For sera IgG antibody detection, plates were first coated with expressed RBD193-CHO protein, followed by addition of a serial dilution of mouse sera after washes; then, detection was conducted as before [15] . Neutralization assay. The neutralization assay against SARS pseudovirus infection was performed according to the method established in our laboratory, i.e., using HEK293T cells expressing the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2/293T) [7] . The neutralization of SARS pseudovirus was calculated as before [16] and indicated as 50% neutralizing antibody titer (NT 50 ). The neutralization assay against live SARS-CoV (GZ50 strain; GenBank Accession No. AY304495) infection was performed as previously described [17, 18] , and neutralizing titers that completely prevented cytopathic effect (CPE) in 50% of the wells (NT 50 ) were calculated by the Reed-Muench method. ELISPOT assay. The assay was performed using an ELISPOT mouse kit (Mabtech, Mariemont, OH) according to the manufacturer's protocol and our previously described method [17, 18] . Ninety-six-well ELISPOT plates were coated with anti-IFN-c, -IL-2, -IL-4 and -IL-10 mAbs. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 24 h in the presence of an identified MHC-H-2 d restricted SARS-CoV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) peptide (N50: S365-374, KCYGVSATKL) or Th peptide (N60: S435-444, NYNYKYRYLR) [19] . Plates were incubated with biotinylated labeled anti-mouse IFNc, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 mAbs at 1:1000 dilution. Spots of cytokineproducing T cells were counted and expressed as the number of spot-forming cells (SFC) per 10 6 input cells. SARS-CoV challenge. RBD193-CHO protein-vaccinated mice were intranasally challenged with SARS-CoV (GZ50 strain, 100 TCID 50 ) as previously described [17, 18] . The challenged mice were sacrificed 5 days post-challenge, and the lungs were collected for further virological tests. Viral load and viral replication detection. The viral load (RNA copies) in the challenged mouse lung tissues was determined by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) according to our previously described protocols [15] . The SARS-CoV replication was measured by using cytopathic effect (CPE)-based assay in order to determine the titration of the virus in the lung tissues of the SARS-CoV challenged mice. The viral titers were calculated as described before [15] .
