The use of nucleic acid probes in the analysis of food and water has provided an alternative to conventional biochemical identification of pathogens and indicator organisms. Nucleic acid probes are more specific, can detect pathogenic members of a population, and results are generally obtained faster than when using standard identification methods. When testing food and water, pathogen-specific probes have been typically used in modifications of the colony hybridization procedure of Grunstein and Hogness (1975) . Colony hybridization has been used to detect virulent , 1987 Dimitrov et al., 1985 Yersinia enterocolitica (Hill et al., 1983b; Jagow and Hill, 1986) and toxigenic E. coli (Hill et al., 1983a) in artifically contamined food, and toxigenic E. coli (Echeverria et al., 1982; Moseley et al., 1982) and Vibrio cholerae (Kaper et al., 1981 (Kaper et al., , 1982 in water.
