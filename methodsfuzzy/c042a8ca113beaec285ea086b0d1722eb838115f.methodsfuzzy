This study included 16 patients. The patients were selected from the outpatient clinic of Benha University Hospital, Al-Haud Al-Marsoud and The National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt. The patients included 4 (25%) females and 12 (75%) males, and their ages ranged from 21 to 62 years with a mean of 40.87 ±13.17 years. They had different clinical subtypes of psoriasis and exhibited various degrees of severity. History of present illness included the onset, course, duration, previous treatment and date of last topical application or systemic therapy. Inclusion criteria: those included in the study were adult psoriatic patients ≥ 18 years who should not have received a topical therapeutic modality apart from petrolatum for the last four weeks or systemic therapy for the last eight weeks. Presence or absence of any coexisting noncutaneous conditions was established. Three patients were hypertensive, three had psoriatic arthropathy, one had hepatitis C virus (HCV) with anaemia of chronic disorder type and one had diabetes mellitus with hypertension. A positive family history was encountered only in one case. Two patients had upper respiratory tract infections; cold exposure worsened five patients' clinical presentation; sweating aggravated one patient's condition; three patients had psychogenic factors precipitating their cases. Only five of the studied patients were not affected by predisposing factors (31.3%). The psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score sheet was adopted according to Fredriksson and Pettersson and Marks et al. [15, 16] for all patients as an indication of degree of severity. In mild cases, the extent of the disease does not exceed 10, while in severe cases, the extent of the disease is more than 30 based on the PASI score [17] . Informed consent was obtained after complete description of the study from each participant, according to the guidelines of the local ethical committee of the National Research Center. Two biopsies were taken from each patient in the first set. The first biopsy was taken from the lesional psoriatic skin and the second from nonlesional skin. All patients were subjected to continuous treatment (in the form of topical steroids and oral systemic methotrexate) and followed up for 2 months. Six patients with moderate to severe degrees of psoriasis and two with palmoplantar subtype of psoriasis (who did not respond to topical steroids) received oral systemic methotrexate. The dosage used was: 15 mg per week in three divided doses taken at 12-hour intervals during a 24-hour period with folate supplementation. Patients receiving systemic methotrexate were subjected to monitoring liver blood tests monthly. Eight patients with mild to moderate degrees of psoriasis were maintained on topical steroid creams and ointments in the form of betamethasone dipropionate, twice daily. At the end of the course of two months, a third psoriatic lesional skin biopsy was taken from all patients.
