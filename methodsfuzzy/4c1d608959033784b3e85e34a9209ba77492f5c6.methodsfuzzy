This retrospective study was conducted in January and February 2020, and the ethics committee of our hospital waived written informed consent because of its retrospective and emergent nature and evaluation of only the imaging and clinical data of the patients, involving no potential risk. Inclusion criteria were patients infected with 2019-nCoV, positive nucleic acid of the virus and CT scanning of the lung. When patients were admitted, CT pulmonary scanning was performed for all patients with the high-resolution LightSpeed VCT CT64 scanner (GE MEDICAL SYSTEMS, China Branch, Beijing, China). The patient was in the supine position and scanned with breath holding at the end of inhaling. The scanning range was from the thoracic entrance to the level of posterior costophrenic anglem with the scanning parameters of tube voltage 120 kV, with the automatic milliampere technology (40-250 mA), noise index (NI) 25, pitch 0.984:1, matrix 512 Ã— 512, slice thickness 5 mm, window width/level 20 0 0/-60 0 HU for the lung window, 350/40 HU for mediastinal window, and slice thickness 0.625 mm for reconstruction of the lung window in the axial position. Imaging analysis was performed by three experienced radiologists with over 10-year experience, and in case of disagreement, they would consult to reach an agreement. The CT imaging was analyzed according to the following parameters: lesion distribution: left lung (upper or lower lobe), right lung (upp, middle or lower lob) and single or multiple lesions within each lobe; lesion location: peripheral, central or involving both peripheral and central locations; lesion density: ground glass opacity, consolidation and mixed type of ground glass opacity and consolidation; thickness of interlobular and intralobular septa, enlarged lymph nodes within the mediastinum and pleural effusion. Based on the fifth edition of the China Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection by the National Health Commission (Trial Version 5), 6 the NCP was classified into four types: mild with slight clinical symptoms but no imaging presentations of pneumonia; common with fever, respiratory symptoms and imaging presentations of pneumonia; severe type with any of the following: respiratory distress with RR > 30 times/minutes, oxygen saturation at rest < 93%, or PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa); critically severe type with any of the following: respiratory failure needing mechanical ventilation, shock, or combination with other organ failure needing ICU intensive care.
