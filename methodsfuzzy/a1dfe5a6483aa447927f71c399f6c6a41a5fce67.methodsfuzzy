On-site semi-structured interviews were conducted with local hotel managers and the KOC. The sampling frame of hotels was obtained with the assistance of the Kaohsiung City government, providing a list of 27 contracted hotels that offered accommodation services to the WG athletes, staff, VIPs, and media. These 27 hotels were selected as our samples because they cooperated closely with the city government and their business was greatly affected by the staging of this event. In addition, these providers were the key stakeholders in the region for room capacity. The Kaohsiung City government assisted with data collection by issuing an official letter to the hotels 1 month after the WG to request these businesses to participate in the interview. Individual companies were later contacted by phone to inform them of the study purposes, inquire as to their willingness to participate, and to set up the appointment. Twenty hotels, including 5 tourism hotels and 15 general hotels, agreed to be interviewed during October and November 2009. The face-to-face interview adopted the semi-structured format and two main questions were raised: "Is the hosting of the World Games beneficial to the hotel business?" and "What is the importance of the World Games on future tourism development in Kaohsiung City?". The interviewee in this study was either the marketing department director or room division manager, and had the knowledge and seniority to answer the interview questions regarding the hotel's operation before, during, and shortly after the WG. The interviews averaged approximately 1.5 h each and were summarized using field notes. 5 The second stage of this study was to arrange a personal interview with the KOC/Kaohsiung Tourism Bureau. The timing was arranged after the hotel interviews were completed to communicate the problems that were raised by the private sector to the governing authorities. After each interview, interview scripts were coded and then categorized into main themes, such as the contract issue and the turn away of group visitors. Texts under the same theme were merged together across 20 interviewed hotels to support each other's opinions. We further summarize these common themes into five major factors. During the interview process, some hotel managers supplied their occupancy rates and room revenue to support their opinions, which were later cross-checked against the data provided by the KOC. In addition, secondary data from governmental statistics, newspapers, and other study reports were studied and are cited in this paper to further validate stakeholders' opinions and draw out content and meaning. Based on the observation of the researchers, the interview results reflect a high level of credibility based on the cooperative and candid attitude of the managers and the consistency of their descriptions of business with secondary data.
