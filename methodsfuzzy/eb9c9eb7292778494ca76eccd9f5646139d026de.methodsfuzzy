Most of the solvents and reagents used in the experiment were bought from Xinyue Chemical and Glass Co. (Weihai, China) without further purification. The OA and GA were bought from Tianjin Heowns Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd (Tianjin, China) without further purification. All the cell lines were bought from Shanghai Institute of Cellular Biology of Chinese Academy of Sciences. 13 C-and 1 H-NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker-400 instrument (400 MHz) by using CDCl 3 as the solvent. High-resolution-electrospray ionization-mass spectra (HR-ESI-MS) were recorded with LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer. SGW X-4 micro-melting point apparatus was used to measure melting points (mp). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography were performed on silica gel plates and silica gel. synthesis of compounds general experimental method for the synthesis of 2a,b 1a or 1b (1 mmol) and anhydrous potassium carbonate (500 mg, 3.62 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 10 mL) were stirred at 25°C for 30 min. Then, 0.18 mL of benzyl bromide (1.5 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at 25°C for 8 h. When the reaction was over, first, saturated sodium chloride (10 mL) was added. Then, extraction was carried out with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, followed by suction filtration and concentration to obtain the target compound 2a or 2b. general experimental method for the synthesis of 3a-e, 3h-l, 5a,b, 6a,b and 7a,b One millimole of R 1 OH (or R 2 OH) and 1-ethyl- ( 154.1, 143.7, 136.5, 131.1, 131.1, 128.6, 128.4, 128.4, 128.3 general experimental way for the synthesis of 3f,g and 3m,n DMF (50 μL) was added to a solution of nicotinic acid or isonicotinic acid (1.5 mol) in SOCl 2 (10 mL) at 0°C for 10 min. The mixture was slowly heated to 78°C, stirred and refluxed for 3 h, and the excess SOCl 2 was distilled off under reduced pressure to obtain a white acid chloride product. Then, an anhydrous dichloromethane solution (20 mL) of Drug Design, Development and Therapy 2018:12 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress Dovepress 1327 cytotoxic properties of Oa and ga derivatives 2a or 2b (1 mmol) was mixed with the white acid chloride product as well as Et 3 N at 0°C. The mixture was stirred at room temperature, and TLC was used to monitor the reaction progress. After the reaction was over, the mixture was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and saturated sodium chloride solution. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 and filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to get a yellow solid. The target product was purified by column chromatography (ethyl acetate/petroleum=1/4) to obtain 3f,g and 3m,n as white solids. another experimental way for the synthesis of 5a,b Compound 2a or 2b (1 mmol) was dissolved in pyridine (5 mL); then, anhydrous acetic anhydride (10 mL) was added, which was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. 37, 38 After the reaction was completed, the mixture was poured into ice-cold dilute hydrochloric acid and kept overnight. Afterward, the mixture was filtered and washed with 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid to remove the pyridine; this was washed with water to neutralize and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The organic layer was filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to get a yellow solid. The latter was purified by column chromatography (ethyl acetate/petroleum=1/4) to give a white solid. The spectroscopic results are consistent with those of 5a,b. Hep-G2 cells were seeded into six-well plates, cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 for 24 h. The medium was replaced with a medium containing different concentrations of compound 5b (0, 4 and 8 μM) for 48 h. The medium was removed, washed with cold PBS and fixed with formalin (4%, w/v). Cell nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 at a concentration of 10 μg/mL in PBS for 10 min in the dark. Finally, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and examined under a fluorescence microscope.
