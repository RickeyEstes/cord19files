About 500 faecal samples or swabs supplied by veterinarians or from our own studies were suspended in either phosphate buffered saline or distilled water and clarified by low particle (arrow ). Bar= 100 nm speed centrifugation. A drop of sample was applied to a Formvar-coated copper electronmicroscope grid which was then inverted onto 2% ( w/v ) Noble Agar. After the grid had settled onto the agar. it was picked up then floated on 3% ( w/v) ammonium molybdate for thirty seconds at room temperature. The grid was picked up and excess stain removed with filter paper. Three grids were prepared from each sample. The grids were examined with a Philips EM301 electron microscope, at an instrumental magnification of 50 000 X All virus or "virus-like" particles that were observed were photographed.
