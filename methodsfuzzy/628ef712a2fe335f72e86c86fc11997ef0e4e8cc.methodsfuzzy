A large number of immunostains are available that can be helpful in the identification of microorganisms (Table 2-7) . 13 Many of these are commercially available and currently enjoy wide popularity in diagnostic pathology laboratories. Others are available reliably only at highly specialized centers such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Development of new immunohistochemical techniques can be a worthwhile but labor-intensive task. Because there is wide cross-reactivity among fungal species and among bacteria, it is critical to establish the potential crossreactivity of any new antibody and its relative specificity. 14 Nevertheless, it may at times be possible to limit the use of a reagent to a narrow range of differential diagnostic possibilities Recently, a novel chemical variant of DNA called peptide nucleic acids (PNA), consisting of nucleoside bases joined by a peptide backbone rather than a sugar backbone, has been used to detect microbial genetic material. PNA probes offer the advantage of chemical stability and higher sensitivity and specificity. These properties offer the opportunity of developing probes that can differentiate species in situ. Such probes have proved successful in differentiating tuberculous from nontuberculous mycobacterial infections by targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA; others have detected Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida species. [16] [17] [18] [19] Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR amplification to detect infectious agents in surgical pathology specimens is now so common that a basic description of the technique is unnecessary. 20,21 PCR is without a doubt the most sensitive detection method available, and because if can be performed on archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, important diagnoses can be rendered even if cultures were not obtained from tissue biopsies at the time of processing (e.g., lung wedge resections for tumor that later reveal necrotizing granulomas). Common applications of PCR to surgical samples are listed in Table 2-8. Central to PCR, however, is the requirement the exact RNA or DNA sequences to be amplified must be known. Abundant DNA sequences complementary to the target genetic elements and allow for specific localization of microbes in tissue or within cells. Depending on the sequence, some ISH probes can also bind specifically to nucleic acids from individual species, allowing for differentiation of organisms with variable virulence. Although there is great specificity with many ISH probes, immunohistochemistry is preferred, if possible, because of ease of incorporation into the modern automated pathology laboratory. Most critical to the surgical pathologist is the identification of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in cervical cancer screening, and this is most often accomplished with the use of PCR or similar techniques from liquid Pap smear specimens. ISH can also be very effective for definitive detection of high-risk HPV subtypes in cervical biopsy analysis for dysplasia and in defining HPV status of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. 15 Immunohistochemistry for HPV antigens has not proved sensitive enough (although p16 positivity is a reasonable surrogate marker of HPV infection). The HPV genome is present as episomes in low-grade lesions, so ISH reveals diffuse and intense staining ( Fig. 2-22) . In high-grade lesions and invasive carcinomas, the HPV genome integrates into the host genome, and ISH reveals a punctate nuclear signal. ISH is also useful in the detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in lymphocytes, including in lymphoproliferative disorders, because the EBV-encoded RNAs (EBER1 and EBER2) are expressed at very high levels. Commercial EBER ISH assays have been developed and are automatable.
