Materials. Recombinant human IL-6, IL-1b, and TNFa were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), Roche (Basel, Switzerland), and R&D SYSTEMS (Minneapolis, MN, USA), respectively. A human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2, was obtained from Human Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). Male ICR mice (10 week old) were obtained from Tokyo Laboratory Animals Science (Tokyo, Japan). LPS ( Escherichia coli endotoxin 0111:B4, L2630) was purchased from Sigma. Cell culture and cytokine stimulation. HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal-bovine serum and 50 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were seeded at 5 Â 10 5 cells/well in 48-well plates and stimulated with various combinations of cytokines for 72 h afterward under subconfluent conditions. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells or the pieces of liver by means of QuickGene RNA cultured cell kit S (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) or RNeasy mini Kit (QIAGEN, Venlo, Netherlands). cDNA was synthesized with ExScript RT reagent kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a Thermal Cycler Dice (Takara) using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primer sets used for mouse GAPDH, LRG, SAA, and SAP, and human GAP-DH, LRG, SAA, and type II PLA 2 are listed in Table S1 . Gene expression levels were normalized according to the level of GAPDH expression. Production of recombinant human LRG and generation of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human LRG. Human LRG cDNA was isolated by PCR cloning from the cDNA prepared from HepG2 cells. An NdeI restriction site and a BamH1 site were introduced to the LRG cDNA by PCR using the primers shown in Table S2 . The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamH1 and inserted between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET16b (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The resulting expression plasmids containing the LRG cDNA were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLys (Invitrogen). After the induction by 1 mM IPTG for 4 h at 37°C, E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), and the suspension was sonicated. The cell extract was centrifuged, and the resulting inclusion bodies were collected and washed with the same buffer containing 4% Triton X-100 followed by pure water. Since the protein in the pellet gave a single band corresponding to the recombinant LRG protein on SDS-PAGE, this pellet was used as the antigen to obtain anti-LRG antibody. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human LRG were raised against the recombinant LRG protein by subcutaneously immunization of rabbits with the protein (100 lg), which had been emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Nacarai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). The polyclonal IgG was purified from the immunized rabbit serum by affinity chromatography using a protein G (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) column. Immunodetection. Proteins secreted into the culture media were concentrated by using Microcon Ultracel YM-3 (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred electrophoretically onto a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked in Blocking One solution (Nacarai Tesque), and then probed with the rabbit anti-LRG polyclonal antibody, prepared as described above. After washing, the proteins on the blot were detected by using the anti-rabbit IgG donkey antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase with ECL plus detection reagents (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). In vivo studies. To induce acute inflammation, ICR mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.05-2.0 mg/kg LPS (E. coli endotoxin 0111:B4, L2630, Sigma) dissolved in 50 ll PBS. Liver samples were obtained at 6 h after LPS injection and preserved in RNA later solution (QIAGEN) at À80°C. Statistical analysis. Statistical significance was determined with GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
