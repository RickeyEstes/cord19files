Sequence data. The complete genomic nucleotide sequences of 91 MERS-CoVs and two SARS-CoVs were downloaded from NCBI nucleotide database. Among 91 MERS-CoV genomic sequences, 68 of them are from human, 18 of them are from dromedary came, two of them from two bat species Neoromicia capensis and Vespertilio superans, and 3 of them are from European hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus. Two SARS-CoV genomic sequences are from human and bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, respectively. We used sequences 453061240 as reference to extract open reading frames from each MERS-CoV genome in this study. Genomic sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. Total 93 collected genomic sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE software with default parameters 33 . ClustalW and MAFFT used to validate the MUSCLE result 34, 35 . Alignments were refined manually in Bioedit (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/ BioEdit.html). Only unambiguously aligned positions were used for subsequent phylogenetic analyses (supplementary files). We used the JmodelTest 3.1 to estimate the best nucleotide substitution model for our alignment 36 , which is GTR+ I+ G. We used the PHYML 3.1 to perform the phylogenetic analysis for 93 collected genomic sequences based on their genomic sequence alignment 37 . The branch support values were calculated with Shimodaira-Hasegawa test integrated in PHYML.
