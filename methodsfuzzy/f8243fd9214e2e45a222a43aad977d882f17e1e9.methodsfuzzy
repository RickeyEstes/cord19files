In the Nandy 2D graphical representation method [23] a nucleotide sequence is plotted on a 2D Cartesian axes system as follows: Move one step in the negative xdirection for an adenine (a) in the sequence, one step in the positive y-direction for a cytosine (c), one step in the positive x-direction for a guanine (g) or one step in the negative y-direction for a thymine (t) to plot a point. Start from this point and do the same exercise for the next base in the sequence and so on, which ultimately generates a graph of the sequence as a series of points on the plot essentially representing the composition and distribution of bases in the sequence. To make quantitative comparisons between different sequences plotted in this system, we follow the method given in Raychaudhry and Nandy [41] . The weighted centre of mass of each graph is calculated by summing the co-ordinate values of each point and then a graph radius, g R , is computed. The g R represents the Base Distribution index or numerical descriptor for nucleic acids. The g R is a very sensitive measure of the sequence composition and distribution [41, 49] , the values depending on the type of mutations and where in the sequence they occur. g R is especially useful in comparing equal length sequences [50] . To predict RNA secondary structure from the conserved 3'-terminal RNA sequence we have used the mfold RNA secondary structure prediction server (version 3.2) [51] of Zuker and Turner [52, 53] (Figure 1 ). To determine the relative degree of variability of this Cterminal 16 aa stretch, we subjected the entire body region to a scan of 16 aa stretches by sliding a 16 aa wide window residue by residue on the 20D graph and calculating the protein descriptor p R at each point for all 514 H5N1 protein sequences. From this dataset we determined how many p R 's were different; the lower the number the lower the variability of the stretch. We also determined the solvent accessibility at each point by using the SABLE solvent accessibility prediction server on the Internet [54] . The results of this Graphical Sliding Window Method (GSWM) were then compared ( Figure 2 ) with the 16-residue moving average solvent accessibility data to determine correlations, if any, and conserved regions with considerable solvent accessibility. The choice of the 16 aa block of residues for this exercise was dictated by, initially, the observation of the 50-base conserved nucleotide stretch at the C-terminal end of the gene sequence, and further supported by the following: (a) We started with a 8-residue block since this is the consensus minimum number for identifying a protein from a single block and performed a GSWM analysis. This was then extended to 12-residue, 16-residue and 24-residue blocks, based on which the 16-residue block was found to yield optimum results. (b) A second consideration was that while a short aa segment may show a high probability of being solvent exposed, a comparatively large segment will have considerable portions embedded in the protein. (c) A large segment will have considerable variability in the amino acid composition. Indeed, based on these considerations, the GSWM identified the 16 aa segment as the optimum and this can be seen in the figures (Figure 3 ) and the accompanying animated sequence [Additional file 1] where it will be observed that all but one of the six 16-aa blocks show only portions as surface exposed.
