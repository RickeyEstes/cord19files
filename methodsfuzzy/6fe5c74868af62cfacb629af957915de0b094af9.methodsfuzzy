Chemical Inhibitors and RNA Ligands. ISRIB (SML0843) and puromycin (P9620) were purchased at Sigma-Aldrich and used at 200 nM and 20 μg/mL, respectively, unless indicated otherwise. Poly(I:C) was purchased at GE Healthcare. Sodium arsenite was purchased at Riedel-de-Haën. (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer's instructions. For each transfection, the indicated amounts of poly(I:C) were combined with total cellular RNA from resting HeLa-R19 to a constant 100 ng per well. ATF4 Reporter Assay. HEK293T cells carrying an ATF4 luciferase reporter (19) were plated on polylysine-coated 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) at 25,000 cells per well. Cells were simultaneously treated with or without 200 nM ISRIB, and with sodium arsenite at increasing concentrations. Luminescence was measured using One Glo (Promega) as specified by the manufacturer. Ribopuromycilation Assay. Cells in 10-cm dishes were either mock treated, treated with 50 μM arsenite, or infected with EMCV-L Zn [multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 20] in the presence or absence of 200 nM ISRIB. After the indicated incubation time, puromycin (20 μg/mL) was added to the medium and incubated for another 15 min. Cells were collected and used for Western blot analysis. The 35 S Pulse Labeling of Active Translation. Semiconfluent cell monolayers were first starved in medium lacking methionine and cysteine for 30 min and then treated with the indicated arsenite concentrations for 30 min with or without ISRIB. Subsequently, newly synthesized proteins were labeled with 50 μCi/mL 35 S Met/Cys (Perkin-Elmer) for another 90 min. Cells were then lysed, and proteins were separated using SDS/PAGE. Subsequently, gels were dried on Whatman paper and analyzed using a phosphor imager. Immunofluorescence Assay. Immunofluorescence assays were performed as described previously (46), using primary antibody mouse-α-G3BP1 (611126, 1:1,000; BD Biosciences), and secondary antibody donkey-α-mouse-Alexa488 (A-21202, 1:200; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Western Blot Analysis. Western blot assays were performed as described previously (46) , using primary antibodies rabbit-α-puromycin (MABE343, 1:1,000; Merck Millipore), rabbit-α-eIF2α (9722, 1:2,000; Cell Signaling), rabbit-α-eIF2α-P (ab32157, 1:1,000; Abcam), or mouse-α-tubulin (T9026, 1:5,000; Sigma-Aldrich), and secondary antibodies goat-α-mouse-IRDye680 (1:15,000; LI-COR) or goat-α-rabbit-IRDye800 (1:15,000; LI-COR). Flow Cytometry Analysis of eIF2α Phosphorylation. Cells were released using trypsin and fixed with paraformaldehyde (2% in PBS) for 20 min. Cells were washed once with FACS buffer (PBS + 1% BSA) and incubated in ice-cold methanol for 10 min. Cells were washed once with FACS buffer and incubated for 45 min with primary rabbit-α-eIF2α-P (ab32157, 1:100; Abcam) and then for 45 min with donkey-α-rabbit-Alexa647 (A-31573, 1:200; Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted in FACS buffer at room temperature. In between and after the incubations, the cells were washed, twice each time, with FACS buffer. Finally, the cells were suspended in PBS + 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed on the FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences). Purification of eIF2α and Phosphorylated eIF2α. Human eIF2, codon optimized for Escherichia coli, was cloned into a pET28a expression vector. This plasmid was cotransformed with the chaperone plasmid pG-Tf2 (Takara Bio) and, for phosphorylated eIF2, an additional plasmid expressing PERK kinase domain. eIF2α was purified by sequential nickel-affinity, cation-exchange, and sizeexclusion chromatography.
