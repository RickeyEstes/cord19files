Each well is screened for fluorescence every 7 s and signals were regarded as positive if the fluorescence intensity exceeded 10 Â the standard deviation of the baseline fluorescence (threshold cycle, C T ). Among the two methods for quantitation of gene transcription (absolut quantitation by the standard curve method and relative quantitation by the comparative C T method), the latter was selected due to its ease and speed for setup and analysis. For relative quantitation by the comparative C T method, values are expressed relative to a reference sample, called the calibrator (unstimulated PBMC sample). First, the C T for the target amplicon and the C T for the internal control were determined for each sample. Differences in the C T for the target and the C T for the internal control, called ÁC T , were calculated to normalize for the differences in the amount of total nucleic acid added to each reaction and the efficiency of the RT step. The ÁC T for each experimental sample was subtracted from the ÁC T of the calibrator. This difference is called the ÁÁC T value. Finally, the amount of target, normalized to an internal control and relative to the calibrator, was calculated by 2 ÀDDC T . Thus, all the experimental samples are expressed as an n-fold difference relative to the calibrator. ÁC T values can also be used to calculate an estimated copy number for every cytokine by using the GAPDH standard curve. 2 DC T would give a predicted copy number difference between GAPDH and a given cytokine mRNA. As the copy number of GAPDH mRNA is known from the standard curve a predicted copy number for the cytokine mRNA can be calculated.
