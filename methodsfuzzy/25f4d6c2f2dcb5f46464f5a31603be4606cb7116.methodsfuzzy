We identified all patients presenting with fractures to two adult and one paediatric accident and emergency departments and a minor injuries unit covering a combined population of 778,367 9 in Edinburgh (United Kingdom) over a 2-month winter period. Data for two consecutive years were collected from electronic case notes completed by the responsible clinician at the time of treatment (December 2008-January 2009, and December 2009-January 2010). We obtained the number of emergency operations performed for fractures and the number of operating theatres utilised at all sites from theatre records. The number of elective procedures cancelled was obtained from data collected prospectively by hospital management.
