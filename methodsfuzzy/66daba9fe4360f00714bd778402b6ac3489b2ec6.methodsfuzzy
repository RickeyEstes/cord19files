Frameshift construct and oligonucleotides Ã€1 FS was monitored by the pSF208 construct described earlier (29) . Sets of complementary oligonucleotides (Sigma-Aldrich) were annealed, followed by ligation into SpeI and NcoI digested pSF208. To monitor +1 FS and stop codon readthrough (RT), pSF208 was digested by BglI/NcoI, followed by insertion of annealed synthetic dsDNA fragments. A list of oligonucleotides is available on request. All constructs were verified by automated dideoxy sequencing using chain terminator dyes (LGTC, Leiden).
