Library TG1 bacterial stock was inoculated into 2.5 L of 2YT media containing 2% glucose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and cultured at 37 • C with shaking (250 rpm). When the cells reached mid-log phase (OD 600 between 0.4-0.8), super-infection was performed by adding helper phage M13KO7 at 5 × 10 9 pfu/ml. After 1 h of continued growth, the TG1 cells were pelleted and resuspended in 2.5 L of 2YT media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and incubated at 25 • C overnight. After the cells were centrifuged and filtered with a 0.22 μm membrane, the supernatant was stored at 4 • C for panning. The phage panning protocol has been described previously [44, 45] . Briefly, a 96 well Maxisorp ELISA plate (Nunc/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rochester, NY) was used to capture various antigens (100 μg/ml) in PBS buffer at 4 • C overnight. After the coating buffer was decanted, the plate was treated with blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin in PBS) at room temperature for 1 h. Then 30 μl pre-blocked phage supernatant (typically contained 10 10 -10 11 cfu) in 30 μl blocking buffer was added per well for 1 h at room temperature to allow binding. After four washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, bound phages were eluted with 100 mM triethylamine. After four rounds of panning, single colonies were picked and identified by using phage ELISA.
