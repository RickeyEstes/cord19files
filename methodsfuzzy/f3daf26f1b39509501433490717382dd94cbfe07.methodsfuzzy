Culture and media conditions. M13 phage display (PhD) library and Escherichia coli ER2738, used as the host organism, were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Ipswich, MA, USA). E. coli was grown in LB medium (Merck KgaA, Darmstadt, Germany) To determine the number of the phage titers, different dilutions of phage clones were mixed with top agar (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl, 1 g MgCl 2 6H 2 O, and 7 g agarose in 1 l DI water) and were spreaded on to LB/IPTG/X-Gal agar. Monoclonal M13 antibody (GE Healthcare, UK) labeled with HRP (horseradish peroxidase) and polyclonal SEB antibody were obtained from Abcam plc. Phage display protocol. A commercial M13 phage display (PhD) library containing 1.5 Â 10 13 pfu ml À1 and has 2.7 Â 10 9 transformants was used to screen against SEB. Target molecule SEB was prepared in ELISA plates for screening. The plates were prepared by incubating 150 lg ml À1 SEB. After an overnight incubation unbound and weakly bound SEB molecules were removed from the ELISA plate well surface by discarding the solution in the wells. Ten microliters of aliquots from PhD library was added on immobilized SEB molecules. After 1 h incubation unbound and weakly bound phages were removed by washing with TBST (0.1% Tween 20) buffer. Bound phages were eluted from the SEB surface by using glycine-HCl solution (pH 2.2). To neutralize the well content 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.1) was used. Eluted phage clones were amplified by infecting liquid E. coli culture. The amplified phage clones were separated by centrifugation at (10,000 rpm, 4°C, for 10 min). Separated phage clones were purified and concentrated with PEG/NaCl. After incubation the phage clones were pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 4°C, for 15 min). The phage pellet was dissolved in 0.02% NaN 3 in TBS buffer. Stock solutions of the phage clones were prepared in 50% glycerol. Phage-ELISA protocol. Phage clones from the screening were quantitatively tested for their binding affinity using phage-ELISA. Phage clones were incubated in SEB coated ELISA plates for 1.5 h. Unbound and weakly bound phages were removed by washing with TBST (0.5% Tween 20) buffer. HRP-conjugated M13 antibody was brought in contact with phage-SEB complex and then the antibody was incubated for 1.5 h. Following the incubation none specifically bound antibody conjugates were removed by washing six times with TBST. Later 21 ml ABST stock solution was mixed with 36 ll H 2 O 2 (30% v/v). Two hundred microliters of this substrate solution was distributed to each well and the enzymatic reaction took place for 60 min. The green color was measured at 405 nm by BIO-TEK EL 808 microplate reader (Biotek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). Cross-specificity experiments. In order to check the specificity of the SEB-binding peptides, BSA, b-glycosidase, whey, and hemoglobin were tested as target molecules for selected phage clones. For screening the affinity of clones, ELISA plate wells were coated with these target molecules (150 lg ml À1 ) and incubated for over night. Phage clones were added to target molecules and incubated for 1.5 h. Unbound clones were removed by washing six times with TBST (0.5% Tween 20) buffer. Phage-ELISA protocol described above was followed to quantify the binding affinity of SEB-binding peptides towards different proteins. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor measurements. The affinity of selected phage clones to SEB was further analyzed by SPR sensor. Spreeta TM sensors (Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX) were used for SPR experiments. Spreeta TM sensors are capable of monitoring RI changes between 1.320 and 1.368 refractive index units (RI) and the resolution of the system is approximately 5 Â 10 À6 RI. The SPR system is comprised of a SPR sensor, a 3-channel flow cell and 12-bit DSP electronic control box. Goldman syringe pump (Biasis Ltd. Sti., Ankara, Turkey) controls the flow of reagents into the flow cell at a rate of 50 ll min À1 . The changes in response unit (RU) (1 RU = 10 À6 RI) with respect to time are plotted in the form of sensorgrams. First, a baseline was established by injecting PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4) to the sensor surface. Following the PBS injection, 650 ll of SEB (0.1 mg ml À1 ) in PBS was injected to the flow cell and its adsorption onto the gold surface was monitored. The un-bound SEB was washed off by injecting PBS and non-specific sites on the sensor surface were blocked with 600 ll cystine (2 mM) in PBS. The samples of 650 ll containing selected phage clones (10 10 pfu ml À1 ) suspended in PBS were injected to the two sensing flow cells and PBS was injected to the control flow cell. The unbound phage clones were washed with PBS and the adsorption of the phage clones to the SEB immobilized sensor surface was monitored. Binding of phage clones to the sensor surface was marked by the corresponding RU changes. The net response was calculated by subtracting signals of sensing and control channels. DNA sequencing. Phage particles purification, concentration and DNA isolation were carried out according to Sambrook et al. [23] . Sequencing analysis were done using by Beckmann Coulter CEQ TM 8000 cycle sequencer with À96 sequencing primer (New England BioLab, 5 0 -GCCCTCATAGTTAGCGTAACG-3 0 ) and 5 0 -CAGGGATAG CAAGCCCAATA-3 0 . Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements. After DNA sequencing, the peptide of phage clone number 24 was synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis (GenScript Corp., Piscataway, NJ, USA). ITC was used to determine the thermodynamic properties of peptide-SEB interaction. ITC experiments were performed at 25°C using a TAM III microcalorimeter (TA Instruments, New Castle, Delaware, USA). Before analysis, the ITC calibration was performed [24] by diluting aqueous sucrose solution (Sigma Co., St. Louis, MO). The DH of dilution determined was within the acceptable limits, confirming that the instrument was functioning properly. Peptide and SEB were suspended in PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4) and the reference ampoule was filled with PBS solution. Peptide solution (0.35 mM) was placed in 250 ll syringe and 800 ll of SEB solution (0.035 mM) was placed in the sample ampoule. The peptide solution was injected into the stirred sample ampoule containing SEB solution in 25 injections (7 ll/injection) by a computer-controlled pump. Heat released with each injection was measured by the calorimeter in dynamic correction mode. Blank experiments were performed by titrating peptide solution into PBS and PBS into SEB solution. In order to determine the thermodynamic constants of antibody-SEB interaction, SEB solution (0.0175 mM) was placed in syringe and 800 ll of anti-SEB solution (0.0014 mM) was placed in the sample ampoule. The SEB solution was injected into the sample ampoule in 25 injections (7 ll/injection). Binding constants (k), the change in enthalpy (DH), the change in free energy (DG) and the change in entropy (DS) were determined by using the software package of TAM Assistant supplied by TA Instruments. Binding stoichiometry was estimated as 1:1 for both two interactions.
