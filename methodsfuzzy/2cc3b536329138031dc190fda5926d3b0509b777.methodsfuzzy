PCR or RT-PCR are the most commonly used nucleic acid amplification methods for detecting respiratory viruses; many of these employ primers to a single target. Design of multiplex assays requires good primer design and extensive validation to document lack of interference. There are reports of in-house developed multiplex assays and commercially available products. The implementation of touchdown amplification protocols that involve a stepped reduction in the annealing temperature, which introduces an advantage for specific binding, allows for multiplexing and a common amplification protocol. 56 Isothermal amplification procedures such as NASBA 16, 40 and LAMP 57 also have been used for detecting respiratory viruses.
