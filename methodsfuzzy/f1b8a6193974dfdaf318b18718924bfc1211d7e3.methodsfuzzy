Phylogeny reconstruction. Nidovirus phylogeny was reconstructed based on an MSA of the conserved core of the RdRp which was generated using the Viralis platform (Gorbalenya et al., 2010) . Representatives of 67 species, 67 out of 88 delineated by DEmARC and recognized now by ICTV (Siddell et al., 2019; Adams et al., 2016; de Groot et al., 2013) , were included in this analysis (Supplementary Table 1 ). IQ Tree 1.5.5 (Nguyen et al., 2015) with automatically selected LG + F + R7 evolutionary model was used. To estimate branch support, the Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test (SH-aLRT) with 1000 replicates was conducted (Guindon et al., 2010) . Structure-based multiple sequence alignment. The structurebased MSA of coronavirus and CavV 3CL pro s was built using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, version 2.2.3 (Schrödinger, LLC), command "extra_fit", alignment method "cealign", with only alpha carbon atoms considered. The TGEV 3CL pro structure (PDB entry 1LVO, chain A) served as a reference to which other structures ( Supplementary   Fig. 7 . Surface representation of mesonivirus and coronavirus 3CL pro substratebinding sites using (a) the structure of the CavV 3CL pro /inhibitor complex (PDB ID: 5LAK; pink) and (b) the structure of TGEV 3CL pro in a complex with a peptidic inhibitor (PDB ID: 1P9U; light blue). Ligands are represented as sticks and color-coded by atom types. Amino acids involved in substrate binding are shown as lines and color-coded by atom types. Catalytic residues and the conserved His residue in the S1 subsite are indicated (see text for details). (Gorbalenya et al., 2010) . The two MSAs were aligned by MUSCLE v3.8.31 in the profile mode (Edgar, 2004) . The resulting MSA was manually adjusted to improve regional sequence and structure similarity, mostly in the C-terminal domain. This refinement took into account another structure-based alignment of the same enzymes which was generated using the protein structure comparison service PDBeFold at the European Bioinformatics Institute (Krissinel and Henrick, 2004) which superimposes multiple structures simultaneously (Krissinel et al., 2005) . Secondary structures were retrieved from the DSSP database (Hekkelman and Vriend, 2005; Touw et al., 2015) . The resulting alignment was visualized by ESPript 2.1 (Gouet et al., 2003; Robert and Gouet, 2014) . Production and purification of wild-type CavV 3CL pro . Wild type CavV 3CL pro was produced as described before (Blanck and Ziebuhr, 2016) using a slightly modified purification protocol. Briefly, a fusion protein, in which the maltose-binding protein (MBP) sequence was fused to the complete 3CL pro coding sequence (corresponding to the CavV pp1a/pp1ab residues 1387 to 1700, GenBank NC_015668), was produced in E. coli and purified by amylose affinity chromatography. Following cleavage with factor Xa, MBP and 3CL pro (the latter containing no extra residues) were separated by anion-exchange chromatography. Pooled peak fractions containing CavV 3CL pro were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography in buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT and using an ÄktaPURIFIER 10 chromatography system equipped with a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). CavV 3CL pro eluted as a single peak after 60 mL. Following adjustment of the protein concentration to 7 mg/mL using Amicon ® Ultra Filters (10 kDa NMWL), the protein was immediately used for crystallization experiments. Production and purification of SeMet-CavV 3CL pro . The MBP-pp1a-1387-1700 coding sequence (Blanck et al., 2014) was subcloned into pET11d (Novagen) and selenomethionine-labeled MBP-3CL pro fusion protein was produced using the methionine auxotroph E. coli strain B834(DE3). Freshly transformed cells were grown in SM medium (2x M9 salts, 0.4% glucose, amino acids except methionine [each at 40 μg/ mL], vitamins [1 μg/mL], adenine, thymine, uracil, guanine [each at 200 μg/mL] and trace elements) containing carbenicillin (75 μg/mL) and methionine (40 μg/mL). At an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6, the cells were harvested by low-speed centrifugation, resuspended in prewarmed SM medium without methionine and incubated for another 4 h at 37°C. Then, seleno-L-methionine (40 μg/mL) was added to the medium and the culture was incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Next, protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and the culture was incubated overnight at 16°C under vigorous shaking (225 rpm). SeMet-CavV 3CL pro was purified as described above, concentrated to 7 mg/mL and used in crystallization trials. Crystallization. Crystallization screens (1152 different conditions) were performed at the MarXtal laboratory (Philipps University Marburg) using CavV 3CL pro (7 mg/mL) or a mixture of CavV 3CL pro and N-benzoyl peptide (Bz-YYNQ-H; ThinkPeptides, Oxford, UK). The sequence of the peptide was derived from the CavV 3CL pro C-terminus and represents the P4-P3-P2-P1 residues of the C-terminal 3CL pro autoprocessing site. For crystallization of the enzyme/inhibitor complex, the protein solution (7 mg/mL) was pre-incubated with the peptide (1.5 mM) for 2 h to facilitate the formation of the thiohemiacetal with the sulfhydryl group of the catalytic Cys153. For the free enzyme, crystals suitable for diffraction experiments were obtained using 0.2 M lithium acetate, 24% polyethylene glycol (PEG3350). Crystals grew overnight using a mixture of 0.5 μL reservoir solution and 1 μL protein solution in a 15-well hanging-drop plate (Qiagen). Before flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen, crystals were incubated for 10-15 s in reservoir solution containing 20% glycerol. SeMet-CavV 3CL pro was crystallized using identical conditions. First crystals of the 3CL pro /inhibitor complex were observed after 6 days at 18°C. The best crystals that were used for subsequent diffraction experiments were obtained by using 0.1 M bicine (pH 8.5) with 20% PEG6000 as the reservoir. Before flash-cooling, the crystals were incubated for 10-15 s in reservoir solution containing 20% PEG400. X-ray diffraction. Preliminary diffraction experiments were carried out using a CuKɑ-X-ray source from Incoatec IμS with a Mar345dtb image plate detector, which rendered diffraction up to 2.8 Å for the CavV 3CL pro , the CavV 3CL pro /inhibitor complex, and the SeMet-CavV 3CL pro crystals. High resolution data sets for the CavV 3CL pro and SeMet-labeled CavV 3CL pro crystals, respectively, were collected at the MX beam line 14.2 at BESSY II (Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung, Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Energie und Materialien, Berlin, Germany) (Mueller et al., 2015) . Measurements were carried out at 100 K and a wavelength of 0.91841 Å. Data were processed using XDSAPP (Krug et al., 2012) resulting in a CavV 3CL pro SeMet dataset diffracting up to a resolution of 1.89 Å (see Table 1 ). In order to obtain phase information, a MAD experiment using crystals of SeMet-CavV 3CL pro , belonging to the space group P2 1 2 1 2 (unit cell dimensions: a = 94.2 Å, b = 111.4 Å, c = 58.2 Å) with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, was carried out. Data were collected at the peak wavelength (0.97971 Å) with a significant anomalous signal up to 2.27 Å (d''/sig(d'') = 1.083-4.647), at the inflection point (λ = 0.97990 Å; 2.77 Å; d''/sig(d'') = 1.015-2.574), and at a high energy remote wavelength (λ = 0.91841 Å) with a resolution up to 1.89 Å. The anomalous signal allowed us to unambiguously determine 12 out of 14 possible SeMet sites using SHELXD (CC max = 58.2) (Schneider and Sheldrick, 2002) , followed by phasing performed with SHELXE (Sheldrick, 2002) , all implemented in HKL2MAP (Pape and Schneider, 2004 ). An initial electron density map was calculated and a model (581 amino acids; 10 chains; 208 amino acids in the longest chain; score 0.960) was built by ARP/wARP (Langer et al., 2008) . This model was further modified using COOT (Emsley et al., 2010) and refined using PHENIX (Adams et al., 2010) . A dataset for the co-crystallized CavV 3CL pro /inhibitor complex was collected at beam line BM30-A at the ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France). Measurements were carried out at 100 K at a wavelength of 0.979742 Å. The dataset was processed to a resolution of 2.3 Å using XDS (Kabsch, 2010) . The crystals belong to space group P2 1 with cell dimensions a = 72.1 Å, b = 110.0 Å, c = 98.4 Å and β = 105.9°, featuring four molecules in the asymmetric unit. Structure determination, model building, and refinement. Due to its higher resolution and superior data quality, the SeMet-CavV 3CL pro dataset was used for further model building and refinement. The refinement of the SeMet-CavV 3CL pro structure was carried out in PHENIX using xyz refinement, TLS refinement (from the TLSMD-Server; 12 groups), individual atomic displacement parameters (ADPs; isotropic), occupancy refinement, and finally NCS refinement (torsion angles). Water molecules were added in the automatic model building of ARP/wARP. For molecular replacement and first refinement cycles of the 3CL pro /inhibitor complex structure, an automated refinement script based on PHENIX was used (Schiebel et al., 2016) . The structure of the SeMet-CavV 3CL pro was used as search model. For the refinement process in PHENIX, xyz refinement, TLS refinement (from the TLSMD-Server; 22 groups), grouped B-factors, occupancy refinement, and NCS refinement (torsion angles) were carried out. For R-free calculations, a 5% data fraction was used. COOT was used to add water molecules and for the fitting of amino acid side chains using σ-weighted 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc difference electron density maps. Restraints for ligands were obtained by using the Grade Web Server (http://grade.globalphasing. org/cgi-bin/grade/server.cgi). Average B-values were calculated using M. Kanitz, et al. Virology 533 (2019) 21-33 MOLEMAN (Kleywegt et al., 2006) and Ramachandran plot statistics were analyzed with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993 ) (see Table 2 ).
