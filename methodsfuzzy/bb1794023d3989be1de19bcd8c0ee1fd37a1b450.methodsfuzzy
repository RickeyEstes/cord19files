The methods developed for this manuscript were built within the Rosetta protein structure modelling package, using a previously developed glycan-modelling framework (Labonte et al., 2017) . This previous glycan-modeling framework is well suited for de novo glycan modeling where ideal glycan geometries are built and refined, but was poorly suited at refinement problems where one wishes to refine externally generated (and possibly high-energy) glycan conformers. To develop the general-purpose refinement tools outlined in this manuscript, several problems in this framework needed to be addressed. The inability to read and write glycans in a standard format (disallowing interoperability with other software packages), limited the applicability of the approach. Furthermore, the glycan score function was unsuited to refining glycans with non-ideal bond-lengths or bond angles. In particular, the inability to energetically assess ring conformations with non-ideal bond lengths and bond angles and the inability to resolve discrepancies between the geometry and the anomeric name assignments limited the applicability of the approach. Finally, specific refinement protocols for cryoEM and crystallographic refinement needed to be developed. The remainder of this section details each of these changes.
