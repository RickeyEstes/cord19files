Swine anti-NiV sera with known serum neutralizing test (SNT) and inactivated NiV from infected cell culture medium were generous gifts from the Veterinary Research Institute (VRI), Ipoh, Malaysia. A vol-ume of 250 l of NiV-infected cell culture medium was used to extract total vRNA using the TRIZOL LS reagent (Life Technologies, USA), as recommended by the manufacturer. Extracted vRNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis using the Superscript II RNaseH (−) reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, USA), which was subsequently used in a PCR amplification using the Platinum TM high fidelity Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, USA). Two synthetic oligonucleotides, TGNiV forward (5 -GGGGGATCC-ATGGACAATCAGGCCGTGATC-3 ) and TGNiV reverse primers (5 -GGGGGGAAGCTTCTCAACCA-ATGATATGCACCA-3 ) were used to amplify the coding sequence of the NiV G gene between nucleotides 231 and 1737. The underlined nucleotides represent BamHI and HindIII cutting sites, respectively. These two primers were designed to eliminate the transmembrane and signal regions of the G protein of NiV. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into the pRSET plasmid (Life Technologies, USA) that had been digested with the same restriction endonucleases. The resulting construction was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 SI (Life Technologies, USA). The expression was confirmed with SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis before subjecting to purification and further analysis. Broad range protein markers (Gibco, BRL) were used in SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Swine anti-NiV polyclonal antibodies (1/500 dilution) were used as the primary antibody. Appropriate species-specific immunoglobulin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1/5000 dilution) was used as the secondary antibody. The recombinant protein was extracted from bacterial cells using the Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent (B-PER) (Pierce, USA), as recommended by the manufacturer with some modifications. Briefly, bacterial cells from 250 ml culture were centrifuged at 3440 × g for 10 min and the pellet was washed with PBS (10 mM sodium phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.5) and centrifuged as above. The cells were resuspended in 20 ml of B-PER reagent and the mixture was gently shaken at RT for 2 h before centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min to separate inclusion bodies from soluble proteins. After repeating the above extraction for two times, the inclusion bodies were resuspended in 10 ml of B-PER reagent containing 200 g/ml lysozyme (Sigma, USA), and the mixture was incubated at RT for 20 min before adding 100 ml PBS. The inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of B-PER reagent in PBS (1:10 dilution) and centrifuged as above. The extracted inclusion bodies were dissolved in 5 ml of denaturing buffer (6 M guanidine HCl; 20 mM NaPO 4 , pH 7.8; 500 mM NaCl) and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated column packed with 5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose (Life Technologies, USA). The protein-bound Ni-NTA resin was first washed with 10 ml of denaturing binding buffer (8 M urea; 20 mM NaPO 4 , pH 7.8; 500 mM NaCl) followed by washing with 20 ml of denaturing wash buffer (8 M urea; 20 mM NaPO 4 , pH 6.0; 500 mM NaCl). The column was washed with another 20 ml of the above washing buffer at pH 5. The bound recombinant protein was finally eluted with 10 ml denaturing elution buffer (8 M urea; 20 mM NaPO 4 , pH 4.0; 500 mM NaCl) and the sample fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The fractions containing the purified recombinant protein were pooled and first dialyzed against 6 M urea for 6 h. The dialysis was continued by the addition of 250 ml of 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) every 12 h for three times and finally the dialysis solution was replaced with 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5 mM ␤mercaptoethanol, and dialyzed for another 12 h. The purity of the sample was studied with a dynamic light scattering (DLS) instrument (DynaPro-MS/X, Proterion Inc., UK) at 20 • C, and at least 20 measurements were taken at each experiment. All DLS measurements were performed at 824.8 nm wavelength laser at 90 • angle. The titers of the anti-G antibodies in swine sera were determined using ELISA. All washing steps were carried out three times with TTB [0.05% Tween-20 in TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl; pH 7.5)]. All antigen and antibody dilutions were done in TBS. Flat-bottom polystyrene microtiter plates were used as solid-phase adsorbents (TPP Immunomax high binding flat-bottomed ELISA plate, USA). The plates were first coated with anti-swine IgG (1/3000) (KPL, USA) for overnight at RT. After washing, the plates were blocked with 200 l of SEA BLOCK blocking buffer (Pierce, USA) for 1 h at RT. Subsequently, the plates were washed and incubated for 2 h at RT with appropriate dilution (1/100) of the swine sera from infected and noninfected animals. Following another round of wash-ing, 100 l of optimum concentration (100 ng/well) of the recombinant G protein in TBS was added in the wells and the plates were incubated at RT for further 1 h. After washing with TTB, the appropriate dilution (1/3000) of mouse anti-His (Amersham Biosciences, UK) was added. Following 1 h of incubation at RT, the plates were washed and 100 l of the anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase (KPL, USA) was added and the microtiter plates were incubated further for 1 h at RT. Subsequently, the enzyme-substrate solution, containing 1 mg/ml PNPP (p-Nitrophenyl phosphate, Sigma, USA) in 0.1 M diethanolamine (Sigma, USA), pH 10.3 was added. The reaction was stopped after 30 min at RT by the addition of 50 l of 1N NaOH to each well and the A 405 values were measured with a microtiter plate reader (Bio Rad, USA).
