A scale reliability analysis was used to measure the internal consistency of each construct and the Cronbach's alpha was set at 0.70 (Robinson et al., 1991) . The respondents' opinions about the outsourcing project implemented in their hotels were analysed based on frequency tabulations. Although frequency analysis cannot be generalized to a large population, it does provide some basic information and some directions for further analysis (Lewis, 1984) . A One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and an Independent-samples T-test were used to assess for significant differences in the seven outsourcing adoption factors among types of hotel ownership and demographic variables. Duncan's Multiple-Range (Hair et al., 1998) test was used to uncover outstanding groups for the nature of each hotel type and demographic item. A principal component analysis with VARIMAX rotation was used to extract factors that attempted to reduce the number of original variables to a smaller set of uncorrelated variables for subsequent analysis. The VARIMAX proved to be very successful as an analytical approach to obtaining an orthogonal rotation of factors (Hair et al., 1998) . Factor loadings greater than 0.50 were considered significant in the study. A series of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted to investigate the statistical significance of differences between the extracted factors related to outsourcing and types of hotel ownership and the respondents' demographic characteristics. The significant correlation was set at a plevel less than 0.05 (Hair et al., 1998) .
