Traditional epidemiological methods measure the distribution of viral infections, diseases, and associated risk factors in populations in terms of person, place, and time using standard measures of disease frequency, study designs, and approaches to causal inference. Populations are often defined in terms of target and study populations, and individuals within study populations in terms of exposure and outcome status. The purpose of much traditional epidemiological research is to quantify the strength of association between exposures and outcomes by comparing characteristics of groups of individuals. Exposures or risk factors include demographic, social, genetic, and environmental factors, and outcomes include infection or disease. In viral epidemiology, infection status is determined using diagnostic methods to detect viral proteins or nucleic acids, and serologic assays to measure immunologic markers of exposure to viral antigens. Infection status can be defined as acute, chronic, or latent. Standard measures of disease frequency include incidence, the number of new cases per period of observation (e.g., 1000 person-years), and prevalence, the number of all cases in a defined population and time period. Prevalence is a function of both incidence and duration of infection and can increase despite declining incidence, as observed with the introduction of antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the United States. Although the number of new cases of HIV infection declined, the prevalence of HIV infection increased as treated individuals survived longer. Commonly used study designs include, l cross-sectional studies in which individuals are sampled or surveyed for exposure and disease status within a narrow time frame, l cohort studies in which exposed and unexposed individuals are observed over time for the onset of specified outcomes, l case-control studies in which those with and without the outcome (infection or disease) are compared on exposure status, and l clinical trials in which individuals are randomized to an exposure such as a vaccine or drug and observed for the onset of specified outcomes Appropriate study design, rigorous adherence to study protocols, and statistical methods are used to address threats to causal inference (i.e., whether observed associations between exposure and outcome are causal), such as bias and confounding. Much can be learned about the epidemiology of viral infections using such traditional methods and many examples could be cited to establish the importance of these approaches, including demonstration of the mode of transmission of viruses by mosquitoes (e.g., yellow fever and West Nile viruses), the causal relationship between maternal viral infection and fetal abnormalities (e.g., rubella virus and cytomegalovirus), and the role of viruses in the etiology of cancer (e.g., Epstein-Barr and human papilloma viruses). The epidemiology of communicable infectious diseases is distinguishable from the epidemiology of noncommunicable diseases in that the former must account for "dependent happenings." This term was introduced by Ronald Ross to capture the fact that infectious agents are transmitted between individuals or from a common source. Traditional epidemiological and statistical methods often assume disease events in a population are independent of one another. In infectious disease epidemiology, individuals are defined in terms of susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered or immune. Key characteristics of viral infections that determine the frequency and timing of transmission, and thus the epidemiology, include the mode of transmission (e.g., respiratory, gastrointestinal, sexual, bloodborne, and vector-borne), whether infection is transient or persistent, and whether immunity is short or long lasting. Temporal changes in the transmission dynamics of viral infection can be displayed with epidemic curves, by plotting the number or incidence of new infections over time to demonstrate outbreaks, seasonality, and the response to interventions. Key metrics in infectious disease epidemiology that capture the dependent nature of communicable diseases include: (1) the latent period, the average time from infection to the onset of infectiousness; (2) the infectious period, the average duration of infectiousness; (3) the generation time, the average period between infection in one individual and transmission to another; and (4) the basic reproductive number (R 0 ), the average number of new infections initiated by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population over the course of that individual's infectious period. If R 0 is larger than one, the number of infected individuals and hence the size of the outbreak will increase. If R 0 is smaller than one, each infectious individual infects on average less than one other individual and the number of infected individuals will decrease and the outbreak ceases. The reproductive number (R) is a function not only of characteristics of the viral pathogen (e.g., mode of transmission), but also the social contact network within which it is transmitted and changes over time in response to a decreasing number of susceptible individuals and control interventions. An important concept related to the interdependence of transmission events is herd immunity, the protection of susceptible individuals against infection in populations with a high proportion of immune individuals because of the low probability of an infectious individual coming in contact with a susceptible individual. The concepts and methods of infectious disease epidemiology provide the tools to understand changes in temporal and spatial patterns of viral infections and the impact of interventions. Traditional epidemiological methods provide powerful analytical approaches to measure associations between exposures (risk factors) and outcomes (infection or disease). Recent technological advances enhance these methods and permit novel approaches to investigate the emergence, epidemiology, and transmission dynamics of viruses and associated diseases.
