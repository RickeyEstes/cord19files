Validation of the HPLC method was carried out to determine the withinday and between-day accuracies and precisions. The standard stock solution was prepared by dissolving 1 mg of lycorine in 10 mL of methanol to produce a concentration of 100 g/mL. Series of working solutions were prepared by diluting the stock solution with methanol to give concentrations of 0.20, The Scientific World Journal 3 0.78, 3.13, 12.50, and 50.00 g/mL. These working solutions were used to determine the within-day and between-day accuracies and precisions. The between-day analyses were carried out by injecting the standard working solutions once per day for five consecutive days while the withinday analyses were done by injecting the standard working solutions five times on the same day. A separate standard curve was constructed on each day of the validation study. To date, there is very little information available on the phytochemical analysis or standardization of H. littoralis extract, and to our best knowledge there is no HPLC method reported for the analysis of phytochemicals in H. littoralis. Therefore, an HPLC-UV method was developed and validated for quantification of lycorine in various H. littoralis extracts. Lycorine absorbed maximum UV wavelength at 325 nm, which was selected as detection wavelength. The wavelength selected differs from previous reports which ranged between 287 and 292 nm [2, 7, 14] . Lycorine was eluted in the present HPLC method within 5 min and the total run time was 10 min. In search of optimal chromatographic conditions, different mobile phase compositions were investigated. The mobile phases were acetonitrile-deionised distilled water (ddH 2 O) at ratios of 40 : 60 v/v, 35 : 75 v/v, 30 : 70 v/v, 25 : 75 v/v, 20 : 80 v/v, and 15 : 85 v/v, each at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. All these mobile phases resulted in peak splitting and tailing. The retention time was longer than 5 min. This phenomenon may be due to the ionization of the compound in the column. Taking this into consideration, acetic acid or formic acid was added into the mobile phase to suppress the ionization of the compounds. Different concentrations of acetic acid ranging from 0.25 to 1% and formic acid ranging from 0.25 to 0.5% were added into the mobile phase. In addition, the aqueous phase was replaced with 10 mM of phosphate buffer or 1% ammonium acetate buffer. It was found that 1% ammonium acetate buffer without any addition of acetic acid or formic acid was the optimum mobile phase for separation of lycorine. Therefore, the mobile phase chosen for the subsequent analysis was acetonitrile-1% ammonium acetate (15 : 85 v/v). The HPLC chromatogram of marker compound, lycorine, is shown in Figure 1(a) . The calibration curve of lycorine obtained with the developed HPLC method was linear over the range of concentration from 0.20 to 50 g/mL with a mean slope of 1493, mean intercept value of 177.8, and correlation coefficient of greater than 0.999. The within-day and between-day precisions and accuracies for the analysis of lycorine are shown in Table 1 . The accuracy values, expressed as percentage of true value, were between 95.38% and 104.75%, while the corresponding precision values expressed as correlation of variation (CV) were between 0.73% and 8.15% for both within-day and between-day analysis, thus indicating that the present HPLC-UV method was reliable and repeatable. The present HPLC-UV method had a lower LOQ compared to previous methods reported on analysis of lycorine, which were in the range of 1-34 g/mL [2, 7, 14] . The lower sensitivity of the present method permits the quantification of minute amount of lycorine present in the ex vivo plant tissues as well as the callus culture samples.
