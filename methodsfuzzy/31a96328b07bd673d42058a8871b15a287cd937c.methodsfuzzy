A 10% stool suspension in PBS was homogenized for 1 min using a Teflon tissue grinder. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 5 rain at 4 C and the supernatant was subjected to the LA test. Ten/zl of the stool specimen was mixed with an equal volume of PBS on a glass slide. For the inhibition test, i0 ,ul of the same stool specimen was preincubated with 10 ltl of anti-OSU (immune adherence hemagglutination titer (IAHA: 1 : 160 ) for 6 rain at room temperature. Then 20/tl of LA-antiOSU was added to each specimen. After shaking for 2 min, the agglutination patterns were examined macroscopically. Specimens developing agglutination in the LA test but not in the inhibition test were regarded as positive.
