A retrospective chart review was used to evaluate all patients who attended the RRRP at the Toronto Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre between January 1 and May 31, 2002, and the same time period in 2003. Patients referred to the RRRP include patients with painful bony metastases, brain or lung metastases, bleeding, or painful masses. Ethics approval was obtained and data were reviewed from paper and electronic records. Patients , to represent the period of increased infectious disease precautions to encompass the peak incidence of reported SARS cases. This period of peak incidence was then compared with the same period in the preceding year. January 1 to March 19, 2002, and the same period in 2003 were evaluated to control for interannual variation. The visit type was defined as new patient, followup, or "special," which refers to patients seen previously at the cancer center but new to the RRRP. Dates of referral, consultation, and first treatment were retrospectively evaluated for each patient if applicable. The site of primary tumor, reasons for RT consultation, and fractionation schedule were retrieved from the RRRP database and treatment records. Fractionation schedules were grouped into short (1-3 fractions), intermediate (4-9 fractions), and long courses (â‰¥ 10 fractions) to evaluate whether prescription practices favored shorter treatment regimens during the SARS epidemic.
