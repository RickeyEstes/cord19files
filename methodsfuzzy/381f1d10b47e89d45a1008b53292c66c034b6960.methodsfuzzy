We measured rate of inter-regional spread and timing of influenza in the United States for nine seasons, from 1996 to 2005 using weekly influenza and pneumonia mortality from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Seasonality was characterized by band-pass filtering. We found that domestic airline travel volume in November (mostly surrounding the Thanksgiving holiday) predicts the rate of influenza spread (r 2 ¼ 0.60; p ¼ 0.014). We also found that international airline travel influences the timing of influenza mortality (r 2 ¼ 0.59; p ¼ 0.016). The flight ban in the US after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001 , and the subsequent depression of the air travel market, provided a natural experiment for the evaluation of flight restrictions; the decrease in air travel was associated with a delayed and prolonged influenza season.
