Nucleic acid was extracted from 200 µL of the virus transport medium using QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 µL of the nucleic acids were tested using xTAG® RVP FAST assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Abbott Molecular Inc., USA) and analyzed on Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., USA). The RVP Fast assay simultaneously detects the following viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); influenza(IFV) A (H1, H3, and H5) and B viruses; parainfluenza viruse (PIV) 1, 2, 3, and 4; human metapneumovirus (hMPV); adenovirus(ADV); piconavirus(PIC) which includes enterovirus (EV) and rhinovirus (RV); human coronaviruse(HCoV) NL63, HKU1, 229E, and OC43; and human bocavirus(BoCA). The assay also includes an internal positive control added to each specimen at the extraction stage (Escherichia coli phage MS2 RNA) and a positive run control that is added to each run (bacteriophage lambda DNA).
