Necropsy can be an important diagnostic tool, but too often the wrong calves are selected to provide accurate diagnostic and therapeutic information. Performing necropsies on animals that are chronic poor doers or animals that would be classified as treatment failures should be avoided. Necropsies on such animals may result in the isolation of resistant strains of bacteria that may not truly represent the bacterial ecology of the initial pathogens. A more appropriate approach to using necropsy examinations would be to sacrifice acutely-affected animals. However, this should not be construed as a suggestion that necropsy examinations should not be completed if acutely-affected animals are not available for necropsy. Results of these examinations can provide critical information to determine deficiencies in management, such as nutritional insufficiency, and can be an important tool in client education. Necropsy examinations are essential for the diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, which may be common in herds that are incorrectly using esophageal feeders to deliver colostrum, milk, or oral electrolytes. Alternative methods to isolate the agents responsible for acute cases of ECP would be to use deep pharyngeal swabs, transtracheal wash (TTW), or BAL. Six acutelyaffected animals should be selected for sampling based on physical examinations or the use of another screening method, such as the UW Calf Respiratory Scoring Chart. Deep pharyngeal swabs can be done rapidly and are less invasive than TTW or BAL. Two or three individual swabs should be collected from each calf as described by McGuirk. 59 The number of swabs that should be collected per calf depends on type of diagnostic tests that will be performed; bacterial culture and sensitivity, mycoplasma culture, or viral detection. Presence of bacterial pathogens in high numbers, significant viral agents, or 2 or more swabs from the group of 6 testing positive for Mycoplasma spp is considered significant and can be used to direct treatment and management decisions. Comparative analysis between nasopharyngeal swabs and postmortem lung lavage has been used to validate the use of nasopharyngeal swabs in this manner. Positive predictive value for M haemolytica and M bovis was determined to be 100%. The negative predictive values were determined to be 67% and 33% for M hemolytica and M bovis, respectively. Genotypic analysis of matched isolates from nasopharyngeal swabs and lung lavage shows high degrees of similarity, demonstrating that the presence of bacteria on nasopharyngeal swabs is highly representative of lung etiology. 68 These results were obtained on clinical animals selected as described, and similar results would likely not be seen without appropriate case selection. BAL or TTW can also be used to collect samples for culture, sensitivity, and viral detection, and can provide samples for cytologic evaluation of respiratory secretions. Bacterial isolation of a homogeneous bacterial growth in excess of 10 6 CFU/mL or a positive M bovis culture is considered significant. Determination of leukocyte population by cytologic evaluation showing a decreased proportion of macrophages (<61%) or increased proportion of neutrophils (>39%) is considered indicative of an inflammatory response in the lung, even with a negative culture result. 59
