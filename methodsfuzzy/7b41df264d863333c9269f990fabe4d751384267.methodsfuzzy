Before RNA extraction the stool samples were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) creating 10% stool suspension. Viral RNA was extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Extracted RNA was stored at −70 • C until used. Reverse transcription was done using random primers as previously described by Pang et al. (2005) 35 except that reaction contained 1× First Strand Buffer (Invitrogen, USA) and the final concentration of dNTPs (Promega, USA) was 375 nM per each nucleotide. The produced cDNA was stored at −20 • C. We used a two-step nested PCR which was set up and optimized in our laboratory. Primers targeted to polymerase gene region were chosen because of regions conserved nature. HCoV strains TC-adapted OC43 (VR-1558) and 229E (VR-740) were purchased from ATCC (USA), and propagated in HCT-8 and MRC-5 cells, respectively. In addition, positive HKU1 and NL63 samples were provided by Professor Tobias Allander (Karolinska University, Sweden) and Professor Lia van der Hoek (University of Amsterdam, Netherlands). The specificity of PCR was confirmed by testing 35 different respiratory or enteric viruses and bacteria, with negative results. PCR-products were separated and recognized by gel electrophoresis, and all positive PCR products were confirmed to be coronaviruses and the specific type defined by sequencing. ABI PRISM TM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA) was used in sequencing. Sequences were aligned and confirmed by using Sequencher TM 4.8 program (Gene Codes Corporation, USA) and confirmed sequences were compared to reference strains by NCBI Blast ® -program.
