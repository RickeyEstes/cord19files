Nasal washes were obtained for viral analyses from each child while they were breath holding in a sitting position. By using a Mucosal Atomizing Device (Wolfe Tory Medical, Inc, Salt Lake City, Utah), 1.5 mL of PBS was instilled into each nostril. Each nostril was washed separately. Wash fluid and secretions were aspirated immediately by using a BBG Nasal Aspirator (Codan US Corp, Santa Ana, Calif) into a sterile mucus trap attached to wall suction. One milliliter of PBS containing 0.25% gelatin for stabilization of protein in the wash fluid was aspirated through the suction device to rinse any residual secretions into the trap. The combined washes from both nostrils resulted in volumes of 2.5 to 3 mL of wash fluid and nasal secretions. A plastic transfer pipette was used to mix secretions with wash fluid, and 1-mL aliquots were frozen at 2808C for subsequent analyses. NA, Not applicable. Symbols marking significant differences between groups within each enrollment period include the following: wheezing children versus nonasthmatic control subjects (*P < .05, P < .01, and àP < .001); wheezing children versus children with stable asthma ( §P < .05, kP < .01, and {P < .001); and children with stable asthma versus nonasthmatic control subjects (#P < .05, **P < .01, and P < .001). Significant differences between the February and October enrollments for each group are indicated as follows: ààP < .05, § §P < .01, and kkP < .001. {{Percentage of children requiring treatment in the ED or hospitalization for asthma during the last 12 months. ## Percentage of children using medications (bronchodilator, controller, or both) for asthma during the timeframe indicated. ***Percentage of children using inhaled corticosteroids, nasal steroids, or montelukast daily. Percentage of children who missed more than 10 days of school for asthma during the previous year. àààPercentage of children with dog or cat exposure in the home. § § §Percentage of parents reporting that their child's asthma was worse during the rainy or dry season or that their asthma symptoms were not seasonal. Both wheezing children and those with stable asthma enrolled in February and October experienced more asthma symptoms during the rainy compared with the dry season (P < .001). kkkPercentage of children exposed to at least 1 person at home who smoked 5 or more cigarettes a day. {{{Percentage of children whose mother or father smoked 5 or more cigarettes a day. Titers of specific and total serum IgE antibodies are in international units per milliliter. Specific IgE antibody titers in boldface are considered positive, and those in italics are considered high titer (> _17.5 IU/mL). *One control subject did not have serum IgE data but had positive results for enterovirus by using real-time PCR on nasal secretions. This subject with current wheeze was coinfected with enterovirus and RSV. àThis subject with current wheeze was coinfected with RSV and human rhinovirus group C.
