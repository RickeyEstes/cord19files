Random assignment of individuals to quarantine is not ethical; and in some jurisdictions, comprehensive quarantine procedures may eliminate any control arm [4] . In North America and Europe, voluntary quarantine practices are favoured and some degree of non-adherence is inevitable [6, 22] , so both non-quarantined and quarantined groups will be observed. However, selection bias related to health status, employment, family structure and other factors may confound the association between quarantine status and observed transmissions. The best possible observational design would permit evaluation of the decision made by public health officials to place individuals under quarantine and apply analyses based on both the intention to treat approach and taking compliance into account. Retrospectively, we explored the possibility of identifying all individuals screened by public health staff for potential quarantine and contact tracing, regardless of final disposition. This was not feasible. Practices varied with respect to when a record was initiated (i.e., in one health unit a file might have been opened even with an unfounded inquiry, elsewhere a record was generated only with a confirmed contact link and symptoms). Within Public Health records, we were able to confirm 140 quarantined false positive "cases". These cases were quarantined contacts who became ill with possible SARS symptoms but were subsequently excluded as SARS cases, and they had at least one identified community contact. Future cost-benefit studies should include information on such groups (e.g., [36] ). Legitimate costs are incurred for and by these false positive cases and their contacts which should be taken into account. Because people without the disease can't spread it, uneven distribution of such individuals across infection control conditions being compared could bias estimates of impact. As we found, the rate of false positive cases (resulting in no transmission) may have a large influence on the apparent benefit. Several case-reports discussed problems with prospective record-keeping, in terms of detailed contact tracing and the implications of time-lags in serological testing (including those never tested), as challenges to both outbreak management and research [4, 35, 41] . Measurement error is also likely with other important information, such as documenting level of contact and therefore numbers of individuals at risk by contact level. With delayed contact tracing, assignment of contact level may even be done after secondary infection (unblinded) and so could be biased toward closer contact where trans-mission already happen, and toward less close contact where the contact remained well. Papers on the SARS experience have spoken about the importance of data management resources and described core data to be tracked during an outbreak (e.g., [55] ). None made explicit recommendations for statistical evaluation of control measures. Planning to report statistics familiar to other areas of health care evaluation may improve the quality and comparability of data collected. Our approach demonstrates that existing outbreak data may yield more information to evaluate outbreak control measures than has been reported. Further research, presenting quantitative differences in outcomes attributable to measures such as quarantine, would be useful in many ways. First, this would add to evidence on cost-effectiveness. Second, it would facilitate further methodological development in this field. Pooled re-analysis of existing outbreak data across several settings, would ameliorate statistical power problems, and increase the scientific contribution from these important databases.
