Autopsies were performed on 18 patients who were suspected to have died of SARS infections; 15 died between June and August 2003 (7 confirmed as SARS) and 3 died in April 2004 (one confirmed as SARS). The World Health Organization's diagnostic criteria for SARS (25) were used for clinical diagnoses. These included SARS contact history, sudden onset of high fever, respiratory symptoms, chest X-ray findings, and unresponsiveness to antibiotic therapy. The clinical data on the 18 autopsied cases is presented in Table IV . Retrospective analysis of suspected SARS cases provided a comparison between true and misdiagnosed SARS cases. The confirmation of SARS infection was made by real-time RT-PCR demonstration of the SARS virus-specific sequence in blood or tissue samples or SARS antibody positivity in the sera of the patients. Cases were considered to represent a misdiagnosis when repeated testing for SARS-specific antibody was negative (each case tested at least twice, with tests 2 wk apart). The misdiagnosis rate in one of our hospitals was ‫.%53ف‬ These patients were admitted to the hospital because of SARS-like symptoms, and in the initial period of the SARS epidemic, specific antibody tests and SARS genomic sequence detection were not available for confirmation. Misdiagnosed cases were treated similarly to confirmed cases of SARS. Autopsy tissue samples from 6 age-matched and otherwise healthy subjects who died of head trauma served as controls. Procedures for histopathologic investigation of the autopsies for LM and EM were those performed routinely in laboratories as described previously (26, 27) . The technique of in situ hybridization was based on Zhang et al. (28) . In brief, a sequence of 154 bp was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the SARS coronavirus genome sequence. These sequence data are available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. AY274119. The RNA probe was prepared by in vitro transcription in the presence of digoxigenin-UTP. The in situ hybridization reaction was performed on formalinfixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections with the SARS probe at 50 g/ ml. The hybridization cocktail was incubated at 55ЊC for 16 h. The alkaline phosphatase-labeled antidigoxigenin antibody (1:500) was incubated for 60 min, and colorization was achieved with nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and counterstained with methyl-green. Immunoelectron microscopy was based on the technique of Goldsmith et al. (29) . The EM in situ hybridization technique was based on Vandell et al. (26) . In brief, the in situ hybridization reaction was performed on the tissue grids in a procedure similar to that for the LM. The labeled probe was detected with colloidal gold (10 nm)-labeled antibody to digoxigenin. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a range of monoclonal antibodies to identify the different cell types that were infected or affected by the virus (Table I) . Immunohistochemistry was performed as described by Lin et al. (30) , and antigen retrieval technique was performed as described previously (31, 32) . Real time RT-PCR was performed with the technique of Wu et al. (33) . In brief, total RNA was extracted from clinical samples using Trizol reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 g of total RNA was transcribed into cDNA with the superscript first-strand cDNA synthesis system. Taqman real-time quantitative PCR was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Three pairs of primers were designed and constructed (Genbank G130027616 [15121-15661]). The designs of the primers and the probes that were used for real-time PCR and in situ hybridization were those described previously (33) . They were 5Ј-GCGCAAG-TATTAAGTGAGATG-3Ј and 5Ј-GAAGTGCATTTACATTGGCTA-3Ј as the innermost pair; 5Ј-ACACTTGCTGTAACTTATCAC-3Ј and 5Ј-TCATAGAGCCTGTGTGTGAGG-3Ј as the outer pair; and 5Ј-CTAA-CATGCTTAGGATAATGG-3Ј and 5Ј-CAGGTAAGCGTAACTTAT-CAC-3Ј as the outermost pair. The molecular beacon technique was used (33) . The sensitivity and specificity of this standardized real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of SARS-CoV in postmortem lung tissues were established previously (34) . To identify the cell types that were infected by the virus, double labeling was performed by combining in situ hybridization for SARS viral genomic sequences and immunohistochemistry for one of the cell-associated markers. The in situ hybridization signal was visualized with alkaline phosphatase, which results in a dark blue color, whereas positive immunostaining signal was visualized with diamenobenzodin, which gives a reddishbrown color. When the two signals are present in the same cell, the staining changes to a purplish color, which is easily distinguishable from either of the primary colors. In addition, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were performed separately on consecutive sections to analyze the relationship between in situ hybridization signals and immunostaining signals to ascertain the cell types that were infected by the virus. Seven cell marker antigens were examined to identify epithelial cells, macrophages, T cells, B cells, and splenic dendritic cells. The specificities and the sources of these antibodies are shown in Table III . Controls for immunohistochemistry included the omission of the primary antibody or using normal mouse serum in place of the primary antibody. Controls for in situ hybridization included the application of an unrelated probe and a probe that is identical, instead of complementary, to the sequence of the SARS genomic target. Aside from the controls that were described above for the two techniques, additional controls were performed for the double staining, including in situ hybridization and immunostaining
