High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on a Hewlett Packard series 1100 HPLC with a reverse-phase Supelco RP-18 column (4.6 · 250 mm). Mass spectra were obtained on an LC MS Hewlett Packard series 1100 MSD with API-ES detector or on an AMD 604/402. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on Merck 60 F 254 TLC plates with the mixture 1-propanol/ aqueous ammonia/water ¼ 55:35:10 (v/v/v).
