Male and female C57BL/6 mice (some of which were deficient in estrogen receptors) were challenged with anti-glomerular serum plus LPS, and monitored for evidence of renal disease. In addition, some mice were subcutaneously implanted with 40-day release estradiol pellets (0.5mg), and then subjected to the nephrotoxic insult. Results: LPS and anti-glomerular antibody challenged female C57BL/6 mice exhibited significantly worse proteinuria (10.9 vs. 4.9 mg/24h at peak of disease, P b 0.007) and blood urea nitrogen (120.3 vs. 55.8 mg/dL at peak of disease, P b 0.029, N = 5 mice per group), compared to age-matched C57BL/6 male mice. Moreover estradiol-treated C57BL/6 males exhibited significantly worse proteinuria as early as D8 (16.7 vs. 11.8 mg/24h, P b 0.0005, N = 5-6 mice per group), compared to placebo-treated C57BL/6 males. Importantly, estradiol-treated C57BL/6 males that were deficient in ESR1 estrogen receptors exhibited significantly lower proteinuria (5.7 mg/24h), compared to estradiol treated C57BL/6 males (13.3 mg/24h, P b 0.004, N = 3-12 per group). Conclusion: It is clear that gender can profoundly influence immune-mediated nephritis, through the action of estrogens. Studies are in progress to determine the cellular and molecular bases for the differences. Objective. The pathogeny of primary SjfgrenTs syndrome (pSS) is still poorly understood. Since pSS is a multifactorial disease, an approach focused on a single gene or gene product could be too restrictive. No comprehensive, systematic study of genes expressed or repressed in salivary gland, one of the main target-organ of patients with pSS, has ever been reported. We aimed to compare the gene-expression profiling in salivary glands of patients with pSS with that of subjects without any auto-immune features. Patients and Methods. Patients with pSS according to European-American consensus group criteria were included in the study, as well as patients withSS and rheumatoid arthritis and subjects without any feature of autoimmunity (no autoantibody, focus score b 1). Total RNA was isolated from labial salivary glands and RNA levels, quality and purity were assessed with the use of the RNA 6000 Nano assay on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA was amplified (one-round amplification, Ampliamp, Ambion, UK), controlled on the BioAnalyzer, and c-DNA fluorescent probes were prepared from 250 ng of amplified RNA. CDNA fluorescent probes were hybridized to custom chips, containing 11000 cDNA spots (manufactured by the Commissariat à lTEnergie Atomique, CEA, France). RNA from a pool of 4 normal parotid samples was amplified and used as a common reference. Each sample was hybridized twice, with a dye-swap. All intensity values were normalized using LOWESS. The whole procedure of geneexpression profiling fulfilled the MIAME standards for microarray data. P values were corrected for multiple comparisons according to Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate procedure. Results. Thirty-two microarrays were hybridized, using salivary glands of 7 patients with pSS, 7 subjects without any feature of autoimmunity and 2 patients with SS and rheumatoid arthritis. Taking into account features present in all microarrays, 169 genes (93 genes up-regulated, 76 genes downregulated) were differentially expressed between patients with pSS and subjects without any feature of autoimmunity. 612 genes were differentially expressed between these 2 groups after algorithmic evaluation of missing values. Hierarchical clustering showed that 6/7 patients with pSS clustered tightly together, as well as 6/7 subjects without any feature of autoimmunity. The 169 genes mainly belonged to the cell-cycle, oxidative burst, apoptosis, protein metabolism and chemokine families. Validation of these results using quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry are currently under way. Conclusion. This gene-expression profiling study in the target organ of pSS, which fulfilled the best standards for microarray data, demonstrates that the transcriptomic approach could be very helpful to unravel new pathogenic pathways in autoimmunity.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent antigen presenting cells that play important roles in the induction of immune responses against microorganisms and tumors and are also vital players in the induction of tolerance and autoimmunity. Due to these unique features, DCs are very promising therapeutic tools being used to manipulate the immune system and form the basis of a number of ongoing clinical trials as biological adjuvants and modulators in cancer, infectious disease and autoimmunity. In order to further study the biology of these relatively rare DCs, as well as evaluate their efficacy in the various clinical trials, the easy identification and enumeration of these cells in whole blood, preferably in an automated and standardized format is pivotal. The current study was designed to develop an automated and standardized methodology for the phenotypic identification and enumeration of DCs in whole blood. The Beckman Coulter, Inc. 3color DC phenotyping reagents were used in conjunction with the COULTERR PrepPlus 2 automated pipetting instrument, the TQ-Prep automated lysing and fixing instrument, the CellPrep automated non-centrifugal washing instrument, and the Cytomics FC500 flow cytometer with totally automated instrument setup, data acquisition, and data analysis. Normal and abnormal whole blood samples were evaluated for identification and enumeration of DCs and results compared to the recommended validated manual techniques. The automated methodology enabled a more precise, and standardized bhands offQ identification and enumeration of DCs in whole blood. Signal to noise ratios were improved while maintaining similar cell recoveries compared to the manual methods in both normal and abnormal blood specimens. Therefore, the use of validated reagents, precise pipetting, automated preparation, automated cytometer setup, defined gating strategies, and automated data analysis and data reduction techniques enables a standardized phenotypic evaluation and enumeration of rare dendritic cell events in whole blood. A 96% pure construct of MLIF and the human cell line MRC-5 were employed. The cell line MRC-5 was expanded in MEM containing 10% bovine fetal serum until reaching the adequate cell count. Cells were adjusted at 5Â10 6 cells/5 ml and were placed in 6-well plates, incubating them for 24h at 378C with 5% CO 2 in: PMA-Ionomicine (10ng/10 6 cells/ml, 0.5Ag/10 6 cells/ml), or PMA-Ionomicine+MLIF (10ng/10 6 cells/ml, 0.5Ag/10 6 cells/ml, 50Ag/ 10 6 cells/ml). Controls consisted of cells incubated without any stimulus or cells exposed to 50Ag/10 6 cells/ml MLIF alone. Cells were treated and lysed in 1ml of TRIZOLR. Total RNA was isolated following the manufactureŕs instructions and DNA was removed with DNAase I. RNA integrity was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The synthesis of labelled cDNA with 33 P was started from total RNA (Human Cytokine Labelling PrimersR) and purified in Sephadex G-25R columns. The cDNA was hybridized in gene microarray membranes (Panorama Human Cytokine Gene ArraysR) Membrane were exposed using BioMax MR X-ray filmR. Spots were quantified by digital analysis. Average values of housekeeping genes and negative controls were used to adjust values of the genes in the membrane. We used 0.999 % confiability and a Z value of 3.090. bInvariantQ TCR-a+, non-invariant diverse ah+, and gy+ CD1d-restricted T cells are subsets of dNKTT cells with distinct locations and functions. CD1d-restricted T cells can rapidly produce large amounts of anti-&/or pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines depending on microenvironment and stimulus. Systemic stimulation of invariant NKT cells leads to transient protection against numerous diseases through indirect activation of various antigen presenting cells (APC), B and T cells, all of which can express CD1d, as well as NK cells. CD1d-restricted T cell activation can rapidly stimulate APC pro-inflammatory IL-12 production. This was modeled by direct ligation of human APC CD1d in vitro. In vivo, both invariant NKT cell activation and CD1d ligation could protect against acute picornavirus infection, suggesting re-examination of results involving CD1d bblocking.Q CD1d-restricted T cells are also essential for optimal physiological response against picornavirus through augmentation of IL-12 production and NK cell activation. A case report further supports an antiviral role for human invariant NKT cells. However, excessive activation of local CD1d-restricted T cells can lead (directly and indirectly) to tissue damage. High levels of IFN-g producing Th1 resident hepatic CD1d-restricted T cells may protect against acute infection, yet contribute to pathology during chronic infections such as hepatitis C through amplified and modified Th1/ Th2 responses to tissue CD1d. Analogous results were found in model viral myocarditis. Invariant NKT cells are also essential for optimal model anti-tumor responses against spontaneous cancer, metastases, and tumor vaccines. Cancer progression correlates with failure of patient invariant NKT cells to activate protective antitumor responses. This defective response can be corrected in vitro and a phase 1 trial has been designed. Finally, the presence of NK cell markers is not essential for function. Therefore, CD1drestricted T cells are diverse multi-functional cells at the innateadaptive immune response interface. Therapeutic approaches exploiting distinct CD1d-restricted T cell populations are being explored, for example in graft-versus-tumor responses and graftversus-host disease suppression. Our aim was to characterize different lymphocyte subsets in cancer-associated dermatomyositis patients compared with healthy controls and patients who had primary dermatomyositis. Fifteen patients with cancer-associated dermatomyositis and 44 primary dermatomyositis patients were included in this study. Different lymphocyte subpopulations were measured by phenotypical characterization with monoclonal antibodies. Intracellular cytokine expression of peripheral T lymphocytes was assessed after an in vitro incubation with an activating cocktail. The cells were labeled with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 antibodies and intracellular accumulation of IL-4 or IFN-g was detected. The frequency of different Tcell subsets was measured within the T lymphocyte population by flow cytometry. A. L. Asare, 1 S. A. Kolchinsky, 1 P. Wood, 2 V. L. Seyfert-Margolis. 1 1 Immune Tolerance Network, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA; 2 Center for Human Genetics and Integrated Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Objective: Commercially available blood collection tubes for gene expression studies lyse red blood cells and stabilize RNA to ensure detected transcript profiles reflect the physiological state of the subject. We assessed two such systems for their ability to detect and quantify differential expression of cytokine and chemokine genes. Method: Peripheral blood samples from 8 healthy volunteers were collected in both Tempus Tubek blood collection tubes (Applied Biosystems (ABI), Foster City, CA) and PAXgenekBlood RNA Tubes (PreAnalytiX, Valencia, CA). All samples were isolated according to the manufacturersT instructions. RNA purity and yield were assessed prior to analysis. Samples were preprocessed as follows: 1) Blood was drawn directly into Tempus k and PAXgenek tubes or 2) Samples were drawn in LI Heparin tubes, stimulated with PHA, and then transferred into the two RNA collection tube types. We analyzed both: 1) Transcript detection at single time-points and 2) Differential expression between baseline samples and samples stimulated with 25 Ag/ml PHA after 3 hrs. Affymetrix HG-U133 2.0 GeneChipn with 47K transcripts and quantitative RT-PCR for 184 cytokine and chemokine transcripts (probe primers from ABI) were run. Results: Initial analysis of 2 out of 8 participants generated a GeneChipn analysis set of 1,245 reliably detected transcripts. Clustering using standard correlation generated the following differential expression profiles: Set A (370 transcripts) showing up regulation using both tubes; Set B (336 transcripts) showing down regulation using both tubes; Set C (180 transcripts) showing no change, but having elevated baseline values in Tempusk but not PAXgenek; Set D (249 transcripts) showing no change, but having elevated baseline values in PAXgenek but not in Tempusk. Transcripts in Set C and D were not cytokine/ chemokine related. Transcripts in Set A with greater than 10 log scale expression include chemokine (c motif) ligand 1, class 1 MHC-restricted T cell associated molecule, chemokine (C-X-C motif). Quantifying differential expression by RT-PCR showed high similarity between the tubes for all cytokine/chemokine transcripts. Some allergy relevant cytokines, such as IL-5, were not detectable at high levels in the GeneChipn assay, but were detected at high levels using RT-PCR. Conclusion: Different kinetics for each tube during the lysing process may account for detection level differences at single time-points for non-cytokine/ chemokine related transcripts found using GeneChipsn. These time-point differences could not be confirmed using RT-PCR since cytokine/chemokine RT-PCR probes were used. This demonstrates that the selection of a particular tube for RNA studies may depend heavily upon the transcripts of interest. For cytokine/chemokine transcripts, both tube types provide essentially equivalent expression profiles. Cytokine networks play a crucial role in the disease progression of both multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The study of these networks is necessary for understanding the disease and for developing treatments. However, cytokines are multifaceted and may fulfill contradictory roles depending upon a variety of factors, e.g. stage of disease. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important cytokine in both EAE and MS. Mice that lack TNF receptor type 1 (TNFR1 KO) develop mild EAE but express high levels of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in the spinal cord. IFN-gamma is a pro-inflammatory cytokine traditionally considered detrimental in MS, but which has been shown to be protective in EAE. The present study examines the mechanism by which lack of TNFR1 results in increased IFN-gamma production using an in vitro coculture approach. Wild type (WT) or TNFR1 KO mice were immunized with MOG35-55 peptide in complete FreundTs adjuvant. Seven to ten days later, lymph node T cells were isolated by MACS using negative selection. Splenic antigen presenting cells (APCs) from unimmunized mice were also obtained by MACS using negative selection. WT or TNFR1 KO T cells were co-cultured with WT or TNFR1 KO APCs in the presence of MOG35-55 peptide, and cytokine expression was analyzed at various time points by ELISA or real-time PCR. Both WT and TNFR1 KO T cells produced significantly more IFNgamma when co-cultured with TNFR1 KO APCs compared with WT APCs. This observation was not altered by the addition of neutralizing anti-TNF antibody, demonstrating that the enhanced IFN-gamma secretion was not due to TNF actions through TNFR2. Furthermore, these data demonstrated that TNFR1 signaling on the APC is critical in regulating IFN-gamma production. APCs can regulate T cell IFN-gamma production by secretion of IFN-gamma-inducing factors, such as IL-12. Preliminary results show that mRNA expression of the p40 subunit of IL-12 was higher in co-cultures containing TNFR1 KO APCs compared to WT APCs. This suggests that the absence of TNFR1 on APCs leads to higher levels of IL-12, which results in higher IFN-gamma secretion by T cells. The p40 subunit is a component of IL-23 as well as IL-12. IL-12 promotes IFN-gamma-secreting T cells, whereas IL-23 promotes IL-17-secreting T cells that have recently been shown to be critical for EAE pathology. Protein array analysis revealed high levels of IL-17 in our co-cultures, and future work will further investigate the role of IL-17 in our coculture system. In conclusion, this study shows that lack of TNFR1 on APCs leads to greater IFN-gamma production by T cells, potentially due to a change in p40 expression. These data further extend our understanding of the cytokine networks underlying CNS inflammation. This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada. Heparinized blood samples were collected from CVID patients at least 21 days following the last infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or from newly diagnosed naive CVID patients prior to IVIg therapy. As control, blood samples were obtained from patients with selective antibody deficiencies who received IVIg similar to CVID patients, and healthy controls. Monocyte-derived DC from patientsT blood and from control groups were generated after differentiation for six days in the presence of GM-CSF, IL-4 and10% autologous plasma. For allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction, DCs from CVID patients and healthy donors were exposed to CD4 + T-cells of thirdparty healthy donors.The CD4 + T cells were isolated by magnetic cell sorter (MACS) cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Cytokines were quantified by Quantikine ELISA kit (Immunotech, Marseilles, France). Results: Dendritic cells (DC) from CVID patients have severely perturbed diiferentiation and maturation. Although the total number of DC appears normal as determined by CD11c expression, they express only nominal levels of CD1a, a hallmark of LangerhanTs cells, and completely fail to up-regulate CD83, typically expressed on fully mature DC. Moreover, patientsT DC express markedly reduced levels of the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 that are critical for T-cell stimulation; and HLA class II, the antigen presenting molecule. In turn, patientsT DC induced weak proliferation of allogeneic T cells and produced significantly low amounts of interleukin-12 (IL-12) upon CD40 signaling. In our study 75 children with otitis media and 75 healthy children under age of 6 year were evaluated. Serum gamma globulins were determined with serum electrophoresis. IgM, IgG, IgA, C3,C4 in serum were determined with single radial immunodiffusion.Level of IgG 2 in serum was determined with Sandwich ELISA through our Homemade ELISA. Result: Show that otitis media occurred in male 1.3 times more than female. The level of gammaglobulins,IgM,IgA have increase in patient group versus health group in 1-2 year age group (P b 0.05), but no meaningful increase in 3-4 and 5-6 years age group was noted (P N 0/05). No statically difference was noted in the level of IgG,C 3 and C 4 between patient and health groups in all age groups (P b 0.05). IgG 2 has decreased in group versus health group in 3-4 year age group (P b 0.05) but no statistical difference was noted in 1-2 year and 5-6 year age groups (P N 0.05). Su2.28. New Composition Immunotherapy in Treatment of Secondary Immunodeficiency Accompanied by Viral Infectious Syndrome. Among different clinical syndromes accompanied the secondary damage of immune system-the viral syndrome is leading one. Our studies last years had demonstrated facts: persons having few recurrent episodes, from 4 till 24, of acute viral respiratory infections (RAVRI) by the year may have also persisting viral infections such as CMV, VEB, HSV (I, II types), VHG-6. Often their clinical manifestations are similar bsyndrome of chronic fatigue. We had studied 325 patients with RAVRI (75M, 50 F) in age from 20 till 72 years. All of them had clinical markers of secondary immunodeficiency accompanied by viral infection syndrome. We detected: the system of IFN (plasmaTs IFN, IFNa, IFNg); immune system (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD16+, CD19+, RBTL, IgG, IgA, IgM, neutrophylic phagocyts); herpes viral infection (HSV I/II types, CMV, VEB, VHG-6) by means of PCR and there were tested specific antibodies-IgG and IgM classes against HSV I/II types, CMV, VEB. 100% patients had have combine defects of IFNTs system, different deficiencies of T-cellTs immunity, NK cells, phagocytes. More than 90,0% patients had have suggesting herpesviral infections. All of this patients were treated following complex immunotherapy in different combination: 1) local and systemic IFN therapy (recombinant IFNa-viferon-1, -2, -3, -4, viferon oil), using high-, middle-and low-dose therapy during 2,5-3,5 month-base therapy; 2) specific and non specific passive intravenous immunoglobulins (cytotect, pentaglobin, intraglobin, octagam) only if it was necessary; 3) immunomodulation therapy thymusTs factors (tactivin, tymogen, imunofan) was directed to restoration of T-cellTs immunity; 4) synthetic preparation with polyvalent effects as polyoxidonium and licopidum (reconstruction of NK and neutrophylic leucocyts). At present itTs possible to combine immunotherapy and therapy with synthetic antiviral drugs. This kind of immunoreconstruction may be accompanied by bsupport therapyQ. Using new kinds of complex immunotherapy in treatment of secondary immunodeficiency accompanied viral syndrome we had obtain positive clinical and immunological effects. Those effects had shown decreasing frequency of acute episodes of recurrent viral infections from 4-24 till 1-2 per year, elimination of viral pathogens (81,5% patients), reconstruction of destroy different immune mechanisms (88,8%).
