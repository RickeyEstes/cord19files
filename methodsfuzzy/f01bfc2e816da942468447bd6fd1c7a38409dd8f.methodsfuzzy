As discussed earlier, there are three major tax-filing methods in Taiwan: manual filing, 2D bar code filing, and the Internet tax filing. The later two are usually considered electronic tax filing. For manual filing, taxpayers fill out a standard printed form, usually by hand. Complex calculations are performed using either pencil and paper or calculator. The tax agencies use either manual data entry or image processing to input taxpayers' data into their computers. This traditional filing method consumes large amounts of time and effort of both taxpayers and the tax agencies. The 2D bar code filing was used around the same time as the Internet filing. These two electronic filing methods provide the taxpayer an opportunity to use software to run tax return preparation with a CD-ROM or through an Internet download. With tax-filing software, the data entry errors and calculation errors can be automatically detected, and the best tax return option is provided for the taxpayer. Using 2D bar code filing, the taxpayers need to print out two to three pages of a paper form with a 2D bar code, which encodes all data (nearly 1000 bytes) within the form. The tax agencies receive the paper form by mail and then scan the 2D bar code to input taxpayers' data into their computer system for further operation. While in Internet filing, the taxpayers file directly online, and data are transferred into the agencies' computer system automatically. Hwang 1 adapted the Haines and Petit instrument 22 to conduct an experiment and survey to evaluate the above three tax-filing methods. The results show that the user satisfaction is greater in 2D filing than in Internet and manual filing. The survey indicates that the major users of electronic filing are males who have a college education, who have more than three years of computer experience, and one to three years of Internet experience. Wang 14 added a new construct, bperceived credibility,Q and critical individual difference variables to extend the TAM study in the context of electronic tax-filing systems. Based on a sample of 260 users, obtained through telephone interviews, Wang's study results show strong support of the extended TAM.
