We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Academic Search Elite using two search frameworks. The first framework was broadly focused on how social media and other forms of internet-based technology were used for health surveillance, which also included some broader epidemiologic research. The second framework focused on the use of social media for child maltreatment research. For each framework, one author reviewed the title and, if available, the abstract of all articles found through the search framework. Articles were considered possibly relevant if social media or internet-based approaches to health research or surveillance were discussed in the abstract. Articles with possibly relevant content were downloaded and the full text of the article was reviewed. For this review, social media was conceptualized using the Bright, Margetts, Hale, and Yasseri (2014) definition as "a means of communication, based around a website or internet service, where the content being communicated is produced by the people using the service." The search terms for the general health framework included, "social media" OR "social media surveillance" OR crowdsourcing OR crowdsource OR "internet surveillance" OR "online surveillance" OR Facebook OR Twitter OR Google OR Tumblr OR YikYak OR Instagram OR Youtube OR apps OR "mobile app" AND "public health surveillance" OR "bio-surveillance" OR "health surveillance". Articles were included in this portion of the review if data collection was conducted using social media or an internet-based technology and the study focused on a health-related issue. Commentaries on the use of social media, articles in languages other than English, articles without relevance to human disease or disability (i.e., plant/animal disease), and technical reports without application to human research were excluded. In total, 2134 possibly relevant articles were identified through this process (Fig. 1 ). Of these, 147 relevant articles were included in this review. Articles were most commonly excluded because they were commentaries or they focused on the computer science aspects of technology. The search terms for the child maltreatment portion of the search included all the technology search terms, but included "child abuse OR "child neglect" OR "child maltreatment", instead of the surveillance search terms. Articles were included in this portion of the review if data collection was conducted using social media or an internet-based technology and the study focused on a child maltreatment-related issue. As with the first review, commentaries, articles without human relevance, and technical reports were excluded. A total of 740 articles were considered for this review (Fig. 1 ). Of these, 12 articles were found to be related to social media or internet-based surveillance or research. Articles were commonly excluded because they were not directly relevant to child maltreatment (i.e., internet-based pedophilia; peer-to-peer harassment) or did not use social media and/or internet-based approaches for data collection purposes (i.e., only online dissemination of findings; participant self-reported use of social media). The initial searches for this review were completed in March of 2016. The child maltreatment-related search was repeated in August of 2017 with no additional articles found. The general health research search was not repeated because the March 2016 search results provided a comprehensive overview of methods for conducting this type of research and it was unlikely there were significant advances in these methods. Active data collection methods include direct interaction with research participants. Although contact with participants is facilitated through the internet, the process of designing the measurement tool, collecting data through interaction with participants, and analyzing the data are similar to traditional data collection methods. Crowdsourcing is the process of obtaining services, ideas, or content from a large, undefined group of volunteers or part-time workers through a flexible open call. The volunteers and part-time workers have varying degrees of experience, knowledge, and skills. Most often, researchers use crowdsourcing to complete large, monotonous tasks or recruit large numbers of survey participants. Amazon Mechanical Turk, Google Consumer Surveys, and proprietary systems or websites are the most common methods of crowdsourcing. Amazon Mechanical Turk is an online multi-use crowdsourcing platform hosted through Amazon where users are recruited to answer surveys or complete repetitious tasks for a small amount of money. Google Consumer Surveys is another crowdsourcing platform used to recruit a large number of participants for short surveys (< 10 questions) (Sell, Goldberg, & Conron, 2015) . Samples may be constructed to be nationally-representative based on age, gender, and geographic distribution of respondents. However, participants tend to be younger and more technologically savvy than the general population. Participants who complete surveys receive micropayments ($1 or less) in the form of Google Play Store credit. Crowdsourcing tends to be cost-effective, facilitate easy recruitment, and allow for access to a geographically diverse sample. However, there may be bias in the results of studies using Amazon Mechanical Turk and Google Consumer Surveys related to varying access to the internet within a population so older adults, individuals with lower socioeconomic status, and others may be underrepresented (Bethlehem, 2010) . Crowdsourcing has been used to collect information on a range of physical health issues (Adler, Eames, Funk, & Edmunds, 2014; Alqahtani et al., 2014; Camacho, Eames, Adler, Funk, & Edmunds, 2013; Candido Dos Reis et al., 2015; Chunara, Chhaya et al., 2012; Harber & Leroy, 2015; Ilakkuvan et al., 2014; Kim, Lieberman, & Dench, 2015; Lwin et al., 2015; Mandl et al., 2014; Norr, Albanese, Oglesby, Allan, & Schmidt, 2015; Nyman & Biener, 2016; Paolotti et al., 2014; Smolinski et al., 2015; Zhang, Ho, Fang, Lu, & Ho, 2014) . Crowd sourcing has also been used to study several health beahviors, including pedestrian behavior (Hipp, Adlakha, Eyler, Chang, & Pless, 2013) ; public awareness and knowledge about ovarian cancer (Carter, DiFeo, Bogie, Zhang, & Sun, 2014) ; and the cost of diverted prescription opioid analgesics (Dasgupta et al., 2013) . Passive data collection methods are more similar to secondary data analysis methods than to traditional data collection. In these methods, data are created for purposes other than research. Through a variety of methods, researchers gather the existing data, manipulate it into analyzable form, and analyze it. As these data may include millions of records, novel analytic techniques and software programs, often known as big data analytics, have been developed to handle these large sets. Several other possible passive data collection methods have been examined in the literature, including internet death notices as a source of mortality surveillance data (Boak, M'Ikanatha, Day, & Harrison, 2008) , forum postings (Kate, Negi, & Kalagnanam, 2014; Weitzman, Adida, Kelemen, & Mandl, 2011) and restaurant reviews and reservations (Harrison et al., 2014; Nsoesie, Kluberg, & Brownstein, 2014; Nsoesie, Buckeridge, & Brownstein, 2014) 3.3. Active or passive data collection methods Several data collection methods may be used for active, passive, or combined types of data collection.
