Method 1 for the library preparation was based on the Ion Total RNA-Seq kit v2 (Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the extracted viral RNA was quantified, and then digested using RNase III. The fragmented RNA was ligated with random adaptors, and this was followed by reverse transcription. The cDNA was amplified through PCR, and the amplicons around 450 bp were collected with the E-Gel ® SizeSelect™ Agarose Gel (Life Technologies, USA). Method 2 for the library preparation was based on a procedure developed by ourselves. The details of the method development will be published elsewhere. It began with random RT reaction: 8 μL viral RNA, 1 μL 100 μM primer A 15 N 6 (Table 1), and 2 μL nuclease-free water were mixed and incubated at 72°C for 5 min. Then the RNA/primer mixture was placed on ice for at least 3 min. Then the mixture was added with 4 μL 5 × first-strand buffer, 1 μL dNTP (100 μM), 2 μL DTT (0.1 M), 1 μL RNaseOUT™ Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor (40 U/μL) and 1 μL SuperScript ® III Reverse Transcriptase (200 U/μl) (Invitrogen, USA), and incubated at 25°C for 15 min and 42°C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated at 70°C for 15 min. Then the reaction system was added with 1 μL RNase H (TaKaRa, Japan) and further incubated at 37°C for 20 min. After purification using DynaMag™-2 Magnet and Agencourt ® AMPure ® XP Reagent (Beckman Coulter, USA), the purified first-strand cDNA was used for the synthesis of the second-strand cDNA with primer B 15 N 6 (Table 1) at 70°C for 5 min. Then the mixture was added with 1 μL Klenow fragment (5 U) (NEB, USA), 5 μL 10 × NEBuffer 2, 2 μL dNTP (100 μM) and 1 μL DTT (0.1 M), and then incubated at 37°C for 30 min. This was followed by PCR amplification using a system containing the double-stranded cDNA template, 1 × Phusion High-Fidelity Buffer, 10 μM primers A 30 and B 30 (Table 1) , 0.5 U Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB, USA). The PCR was performed as follows: 2 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s, followed by 14 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 65°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The library amplicons around 450 bp were collected with the E-Gel ® SizeSelect™ Agarose Gel. Method 3 for the library preparation was modified from a procedure reported previously as sequence independent single primer amplification (SISPA) (Allander et al., 2001; Cheng et al., 2010; Djikeng et al., 2008; Palacios et al., 2007) (Fig. 1) . Briefly, the extracted viral RNA was reversely transcribed using the random primer SPN 8 (Table 1) , and then the RT system was denaturated at 94°C for 5 min and on ice for 3 min. The second-strand cDNA synthesis was modified using the denaturated RT system which was added with 1 μL Klenow fragment (5 U) (NEB, USA) and 2.33 μL 10 × NEBuffer, and the synthesis was performed at 37°C for 60 min and 75°C for 20 min. This was followed with PCR using the primer SP (Table 1 ). The PCR amplicons were sheared and then ligated with sequencing adaptors. After that, the ligation products around 450 bp were collected and amplified.
