NPAs were collected as previously described and stored at Ã€80 C [21] . Total viral nucleic acids were extracted with QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (QIAGEN, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol with 200 mL of NPA eluted into 50 mL of extract. Real-time PCR assays for detection of HRV (including species A, B, and C), hCoV (OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63), influenza A and B, and RSV were performed on an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) [22] , and both plasmids and viral RNA were used as positive controls.
