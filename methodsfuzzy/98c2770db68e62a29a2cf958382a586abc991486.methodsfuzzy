Different types of assays, including cell-cell fusion assays, cell-virus fusion assays with pseudotyped viral particles, and in vitro biochemical assays have been developed to screen inhibitors of viral entry. In enveloped viruses, entry is initiated by fusion of the viral envelope with the target cellular membrane. The entry mechanism has been well-described for HIV-1, in which it is mediated by Env glycoprotein, consisting of transmembrane gp41 and surface gp120 subunits. Binding of gp120 to its cellular receptor, CD4, and to one of two co-receptors, CXCR4 or CCR5, triggers a refolding of gp41 that promotes fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The refolding involves oligomerization of the extracellular N-and C-terminal heptad repeat (HR) domains of gp41, which leads to the formation of a 6-helical bundle [reviewed in (Melikyan, 2008) ]. Jiang et al. established an in vitro system to quantify formation of the HIV-1 gp41 6-helical bundle (Jiang et al., 1999 ). In their system, the bundle is formed by mixing equimolar concentrations of peptides derived from the N-and C-HR regions of gp41. ELISA using the monoclonal antibody NC-1, which specifically recognizes and binds an epitope formed on the gp41 6-helix bundle but not the individual peptides, enables screening for compounds that prevent formation of fusion-active gp41. For HTS of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors, this method was modified to use a fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay (FLISA), in which the C-HR peptide was replaced with FITC-conjugated C-HR peptide (Boyer-Chatenet et al., 2003) . Cell-based assays are routinely used to screen viral entry inhibitors. High throughput formats have been developed for screening of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors. Cell-cell fusion assays involve two types of cells: effector cells that stably (Bradley et al., 2004) or inducibly (Herschhorn et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2006) express HIV-Env glycoprotein and target cells that express CD4 and either CXCR4 or CCR5. Co-cultivation of these cells leads to HIV-1 Env-mediated cell membrane fusion, resulting in formation of multinucleated syncytia. Membrane fusion induces expression of a reporter protein such as luciferase (Herschhorn et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2006) or β-galactosidase (Bradley et al., 2004) . One such assay enables determination of both the efficiency and specificity of fusion inhibitors (Herschhorn et al., 2011) . This approach uses effector cells that express both HIV-1 Env and the Renilla luciferase (R-Luc) reporter protein using inducible tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) and target cells that express the HIV-1 receptor (CD4) and coreceptor (CCR5) and contain the firefly luciferase (F-Luc) reporter gene under the control of a tTA-responsive promoter. Upon fusion of the effector and target cells, tTA enters the target cells and activates the expression of the F-Luc reporter. The inhibition of fusion of cellular membranes is determined as a decrease in F-Luc luminescence, and the inhibitor specificity is measured as the R-Luc activity (Herschhorn et al., 2011) . Based on an HIV-1 cell-cell fusion method that uses a computercontrolled digital image analysis system for automatic quantitation , a modified method was developed to screen inhibitors targeting MERS-CoV S protein (Lu et al., 2014) . To test potential fusion inhibitors, effector cells stably expressing the MERS-CoV spike protein S2S and EGFP were used to mediate fusion with target cells expressing the DPP4 receptor (Lu et al., 2014) . Virion-based fusion assays are another category of cell-based fusion assays. One such approach is based on production of chimeric HIV-1 virions carrying β-lactamase-Vpr chimeric protein (BlaM-Vpr). Chimeric HIV released into the cell culture media is isolated by ultracentrifugation and used to infect target cells. Entry of the virions into the cytoplasm is detected by cleavage of a fluorescent substrate by βlactamase. The fluorescence shift corresponds to the fusion efficacy and is measurable by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, or fluorometric plate reader (Cavrois et al., 2002; Cavrois et al., 2004 Cavrois et al., , 2014 . Modification of this assay by constructing pseudotyped HIV-1 virions in which HIV-1 Env was replaced with Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) has also been described (Yonezawa et al., 2005) . Tscherne et al. developed an approach to monitor viral entry using the BlaM reporter (Tscherne et al., 2010) . Their assay uses influenza virus-like particles (VLPs) bearing the influenza membrane proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. BlaM tagged with influenza matrix protein (M1) is incorporated into the VLPs and delivered into target cells. Upon release, BlaM can be detected by flow cytometry, microscopically, or fluorometrically. A rapid cell-based HTS method was developed to assess SARS-CoV entry inhibitors (Zhou et al., 2011) . This Dual Envelope Pseudovirion (DEP) assay employs two HIV pseudoviruses: one encodes an envelope protein from the target virus and firefly luciferase and the second encodes a control, unrelated viral envelope protein and Renilla luciferase. Reporter expression is determined with the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Inclusion of the unrelated envelope protein greatly reduced false positive hits (Zhou et al., 2011) . The method was further used to screen compounds that inhibit entry of filoviruses, including Ebola virus . A similar approach employing four pseudotyped HIV viruses, carrying Marburg virus glycoprotein, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase isolated from A/Goose/Qinghai/59/05 (H5N1) influenza virus, Ebolavirus Zaire envelope glycoprotein, and Lassa virus envelope glycoprotein, has been used for entry inhibitor screening . This screening identified multiple compounds with potent inhibitory activity against entry of both Marburg and Ebola viruses in human cancer cell lines, and confirmed their anti-Ebola activity in human primary cells . Other pseudotyped viral assays have been used to screen entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV, Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah viruses. To establish infection, the glycoproteins of these viruses must be processed by the host intracellular lysosomal protease cathepsin L (CatL). HTS resulted in identification of several inhibitors that block the cleavage of viral glycoprotein but not CatL itself (Elshabrawy et al., 2014) . Until recently, the development of anti-HBV therapeutics had been limited by the lack of an in vitro infection system. Several aspects of the HBV life cycle have been elucidated using in vitro production of HBV particles after transfection of human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2) with recombinant HBV DNA and by establishment of hepatoma cell lines with the entire HBV genome integrated, such as the HepG2.2.15 cell line (Ladner et al., 1997; Sells et al., 1987; Sureau et al., 1986) . In addition to differentiated human (PHHs) (Gripon et al., 1988) and Tupaia belangeri (Glebe et al., 2003) hepatocytes, the HepaRG cell line, which exhibits hepatocyte-like characteristics, also supports HBV replication (Gripon et al., 2002) . The identification of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) as an HBV receptor by Yan et al. opened possibilities to use NTCP-complemented HepG2 cells not only for studies of HBV replication mechanisms but also for HTS of inhibitors (Yan et al., 2012) . In an infection competition assay, HBV particles were isolated and used to infect HepaRG and PHHs cells that had been pre-incubated with HBV envelope protein-derived peptides to test their potential activity to block HBV infection. Twelve days after infection, viral RNAs were quantified by Northern blot (Gripon et al., 2002 (Gripon et al., , 2005 . Using this assay, researchers identified a peptide that specifically prevents HBV and HDV entry into HepaRG and PHHs cell lines (Gripon et al., 2005) , primary cultures of tupaia hepatocytes (Glebe et al., 2005) , and cells in vivo (Lütgehetmann et al., 2012; Petersen et al., 2008; Volz et al., 2013) . Recently, a Phase IIa clinical trial of a first-in-class entry inhibitor (myrcludex-B) that functions as an NTCP inhibitor was promisingly completed (Bogomolov et al., 2016) . Development of cell culture systems producing HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp) and infectious HCV particles (HCVcc) has shed light on HCV interactions and enabled discovery of antiviral drugs and vaccines (Colpitts et al., 2016) . HCVpp consist of HCV E1 and E2 glycoproteins enveloping a retroviral particle that packages GFP mRNA during assembly (Bartosch et al., 2003) . The entry efficiency of HCVpp can be quantified by FACS analysis as the number of GFP-positive cells. Use of this screening system led to discovery of a triazine derivative that blocks the entry of HCV (Baldick et al., 2010) . Production of HCVcc is a robust system to generate infectious HCV in naïve cells (Kato et al., 2006; Zhong et al., 2005) . The anti-HCV activity of hundreds of compounds approved for a wide variety of indications was determined immunochemically with anti-HCV E2 antibody in 96-well plate format. Over thirty compounds displayed anti-HCV activities, most of which were directed against HCV entry (Gastaminza et al., 2010) . The majority of viruses enter cells by endocytosis. Unfortunately, there are no suitable experimental techniques for endosome handling, making it difficult to study early steps in the viral life cycle such as uncoating and capsid disassembly. Viruses that enter cells by direct membrane fusion, such as HIV-1, are an exception. There are several methods available to monitor and quantify HIV uncoating. As some of these were reviewed recently by Campbell and Hope (Campbell and Hope, 2015) , we will discuss them very briefly. Two main techniques are used in these assays: ultracentrifugation or utilization of HIV-1 specific cellular restriction factors. The "in vitro core-stability assay" is based on ultracentrifugation of released HIV-1 virions through a detergent layer, where the viral membrane dissolves, into a sucrose gradient, where the viral cores are concentrated (Shah and Aiken, 2011) . The "fate of capsid" assay uses ultracentrifugation through a sucrose cushion to separate the HIV-1 core from a whole cell lysate prepared shortly after infection (Stremlau et al., 2006) . The "CsA-washout assay" involves specific cellular factors (TRIM-cyclophilin) that restrict HIV-1 infection by binding to the capsid core and cyclosporine A (CsA), which can effectively turn off restriction (Hulme et al., 2011) . Recently, a novel entry/uncoating assay (EURT), an alternative to BlaM-Vpr (described in Section 3.1), was reported (Da Silva Santos et al., 2016). It quantifies the protein product of a virion-packaged mRNA reporter upon uncoating. A method to monitor the uncoating/disassembly of the capsid of influenza A virus, which enters the cell by endocytosis, also is based on ultracentrifugation (Stauffer et al., 2016) . Purified virions are separated using velocity gradient centrifugation through a two-layer glycerol gradient. Similar to the "in vitro core stability" assay for HIV, the sedimenting viruses migrate through the detergent-containing layer of the gradient, which dissolves the membrane to release the viral core. Moreover, modification of the detergent-containing glycerol layer-for example, by lowering pH, changing ionic strength, or adding putative viral uncoating factors-enables study of the factors or compounds that affect viral uncoating in vitro. The HBV capsid protein is the building block of the viral core, surrounding the viral nucleic acid (pre-genomic RNA, pgRNA) and reverse transcriptase. The HBV core is icosahedral, formed by 240 copies of capsid protein dimers. In vitro HTS of HBV core assembly inhibitors using a modified HBV capsid protein has been described (Stray et al., 2006) . The capsid protein was modified by deleting the nucleic acid binding domain, which is dispensable for capsid assembly, and the Nterminal assembly domain alone was used in the assay. To fluorescently label the HBV capsid protein, all cysteine residues dispensable for assembly were replaced with alanines. A unique cysteine residue (C150) was C-terminally joined to the assembly domain and labeled with fluorescent BODIPY-FL dye (C150BO). During assembly, capsid proteins dimerize, bringing C150BO residues close together and resulting in C150BO fluorescence self-quenching. Following incubation of the labeled HBV protein with inhibitors, fluorescence was measured in black 96-well microtiter plates. Development of in vitro assembly systems has contributed greatly to current understanding of the structure of retroviral particles and mechanisms of virion formation. These systems also became the base for several high throughput assays for screening assembly inhibitors. During the last 20 years, a number of in vitro assembly assays have been established, mainly for HIV-1 (Campbell et al., 2001; Campbell and Rein, 1999; Ehrlich et al., 1992; Gross et al., 2000; Lanman et al., 2002) , Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (Bohmova et al., 2010; Klikova et al., 1995; Rumlova-Klikova et al., 2000; Rumlova-Klikova et al., 1999; Ulbrich et al., 2006) , Rous sarcoma virus Vogt, 1995, 1997; Purdy et al., 2008 Purdy et al., , 2009 , and murine leukemia virus (Dolezal et al., 2016; Hadravova et al., 2012; Cheslock et al., 2003) . HTS assays for inhibitors of HIV-1 assembly include several methods using purified HIV-1 CA or CA-NC proteins. One of them, the turbidimetric assay, is based on the observation that direct dilution of the HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) into a high-salt solution (1.6-2.2 M NaCl) leads to the formation of tubular structures. As the tube formation is accompanied by an increase in light scattering, assembly can be detected as an increase in turbidity, and the rate of turbidity change is proportional to the rate of the assembly (Lanman et al., 2002) . Other method published by Lemke et al., exploits the affinity of nucleocapsid (NC) to a short TG-rich deoxyribooligonucleotide, d(TG25), which is used as a scaffold (Lemke et al., 2012) . This arrangement enables CA to assemble at much lower protein and salt concentrations than in the turbidimetric assay (Lanman et al., 2002) . Biotin-labeled d(TG25) bound on the surface of neutravidin-coated microtiter well plates nucleates assembly of complexes of CA-NC and soluble fluorescein-labeled d(TG25). Fluorescence is measured after washing to remove the unbound and unassembled material from the captured assembly products (Lemke et al., 2012) . Similarly, the FAITH assay uses a dually labeled oligonucleotide (tqON). However, in this case, the ssDNA oligonucleotide tqON is labeled with the reporter dye fluorescein (FAM) as well as Black Hole Quencher (BHQ); thus, it does not emit any fluorescence. The assembly reaction is triggered by mixing HIV-1 CA-NC or a Gagtruncated assembly-competent version with tqON. Following incubation, during which tqON is incorporated into the particles, exonuclease is added to degrade unbound tqON, while co-assembled tqON is protected from cleavage. Degradation of free unbound tqON with ExoI results in separation of FAM from its quencher, and the emitted fluorescence is measured (Hadravova et al., 2015) . Phage display has been employed to screen peptide inhibitors of HIV-1 assembly (Sticht et al., 2005) . A commercial library of M13-derived phages presenting random 12-amino-acid peptides was analyzed for specific binding to purified CA or CA-NC proteins. The specifically bound phages were sequenced, and corresponding peptides were chemically synthesized and re-tested in an in vitro assembly assay (Gross et al., 2000) . Late in the retroviral life cycle, gRNA is incorporated into the nascent particle during assembly at the plasma membrane. NC contains two zinc-finger domains that are responsible for specific binding of gRNA. To screen for compounds that would prevent NC-RNA/DNA interactions, a HTS system consisting of two sequential screens was developed (Breuer et al., 2012) . The primary screen uses fluorescence polarization (FP), while the secondary one uses differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). The combination and order of these two techniques were selected to first identify compounds that disrupt interactions between DNA and NC, and then identify the compounds binding to NC during the secondary screen. A rapid and simple turbidimetric method was developed to screen inhibitors of assembly of HCV core protein (Fromentin et al., 2007) . For the in vitro assembly reaction, two components, an N-terminal part of the HCV core protein corresponding to the minimal assembly competent domain and RNA corresponding to the full-length 5′UTR of HCV, were used. Assembly of HCV nucleocapsid-like particles was initiated by mixing the purified protein and nucleic acid, and the assembly process was monitored by measuring turbidity at 350 nm. Numerous viruses, including picornaviruses, retroviruses, alphaviruses, and flaviviruses, encode proteases that are essential for their virulence. The majority of viral proteases specifically cleave viral polyprotein precursors to liberate the functional proteins of the virion. Some viral proteases, such as the papain-like proteases of coronaviruses, also reprogram cellular signaling pathways, including ubiquitination mechanisms and interferon controlled responses, to prevent degradation of viral components (Clementz et al., 2010; Frieman et al., 2009; Randow and Lehner, 2009; Xing et al., 2013) . Numerous viruses, including papillomaviruses (Bronnimann et al., 2016; Buck et al., 2005) and retroviruses (Hallenberger et al., 1992) , use also host cell proteases, mainly furin, to trim their envelope and surface proteins. This triggers conformational changes required for interaction with cellular receptors and membrane fusion in enveloped viruses. Some viruses use proteases other than furin to modulate their infectivity, as shown for viruses entering airway epithelial cells [reviewed in (Laporte and Naesens, 2017) ] such as influenza virus (Böttcher-Friebertshäuser et al., 2010; Kühn et al., 2016) , Newcastle disease virus (Gotoh et al., 1992) , and respiratory syncytial virus (Sugrue et al., 2001) . Extensive research efforts have yielded detailed information about HIV-1 protease and its inhibitors [reviewed in (De Clercq, 2004; Konvalinka et al., 2015; Midde et al., 2016) ]. Large amounts of data also are available for HCV (Foote et al., 2011; Pawlotsky et al., 2007; Razonable, 2011) and SARS-CoV 3CL protease inhibitors (Pillaiyar et al., 2016) , although there is not yet an inhibitor of the latter target approved for clinical use. Numerous approved drugs are synthetic peptides derived from the natural proteolytic substrates of target viruses modified to improve the in vivo effects related to bioavailability, stability, and so on. Numerous in vitro assays to monitor the activity of proteases and their inhibitors, including commercial kits, have been developed. Classical methods use synthetic peptides that mimic the target sites of the protease. Although some of the methods described here were not originally designed to screen the activity of viral proteases in the presence of inhibitors, they can be adapted for this purpose by simply changing the peptide sequence to the target site of the protease of interest. The cleavage yield is usually monitored either colorimetrically (Ding and Yang, 2015; Zhou et al., 2014) or as a change in fluorescence triggered by the release of fluorescent labels such as 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) or rhodamine (Grant et al., 2002) . Fluorogenic substrates have been used to determine the activity of coronavirus proteases and screen inhibitors (Kuo et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2014; Park et al., 2017; Song et al., 2014; Tomar et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2008) . Some recently described arrangements employ nanoparticles (Feltrup and Singh, 2012; Khalilzadeh et al., 2016; Udukala et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 2015) or quantum dot bioconjugates (Lee and Kim, 2015; Li et al., 2014; Medintz et al., 2006) with immobilized fluorescently or luminescently labeled peptide substrates. Alternatively, cleavage products may be monitored by analysis of proteolytic products by mass spectrometric methods (Hu et al., 2015; Joshi et al., 2017; Lathia et al., 2011; Rumlová et al., 2003) , analytical HPLC (Teruya et al., 2016) , or electrochemical methods based on the difference in penetration of substrate and cleavage products through the membrane of a polyionselective sensor (Gemene and Meyerhoff, 2011; Han et al., 1996) . To study the specificity of inhibitor binding and to extend the research to rational design of inhibitors, X-ray or NMR structures of proteases in complex with the inhibitor may be determined, as reported in numerous cases for the proteases of HIV-1 [reviewed in (Ghosh et al., 2016) ], HCV (Yilmaz et al., 2016) , and MERS . Cell-based assays can provide additional information, including the capability of the inhibitor to pass through the cell membrane and its stability in the cytoplasm. A general determination of infectivity, such as a plaque cytotoxicity assay in the presence of protease inhibitor, may be used for confirmation. One elegant example exploits the cytotoxicity of HIV protease. Cells are transfected with a protease precursor fused to GFP. In the absence of inhibitor, HIV-1 protease is autocatalytically activated and cleaves a broad variety of cellular proteins, resulting in activation of apoptosis and cell death (Cummins and Badley, 2010; Rumlova et al., 2014) . This toxic effect, when suppressed by active inhibitors, results in production of a GFP signal in surviving cells (Lindsten et al., 2001) . Another elegant approach for HIV and coxsackievirus B3 proteases, which both undergo autocatalytic cleavage, employs constructs in which the protease gene is inserted between sequences encoding the DNA-binding domain and the domain that activates transcription of the GAL1-lacZ reporter gene (Dasmahapatra et al., 1992; Murray et al., 1993) . The protease-mediated cleavage separates the DNA-binding domain from the trans-activating domain and results in failure of reporter gene transcription. This approach has also been modified with GFP as a reporter gene (Hilton and Wolkowicz, 2010) . Co-expression of cleavage-activated luciferase substrate and MERS-CoV protease permits both live-cell imaging and quantification of the enzyme activity (Kilianski et al., 2013) .
