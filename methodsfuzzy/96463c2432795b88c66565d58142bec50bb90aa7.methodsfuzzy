Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from a total of 243 backyard flocks (2317 birds) from 237 backyard farms within all regions and governorates of Oman (Fig. 1) , from June to September 2012. More than one flock was sampled if the farm had more than one species of bird. The samples were collected during a study on the prevalence of respiratory viruses, such as avian influenza (AI), Newcastle disease (ND), IB and aMPV. The number and location of sampled farms was determined based on the estimated prevalence of Avian Influenza (AI) and Newcastle Disease (ND) in Oman backyard poultry. Sampling criteria were calculated based on an estimated prevalence of AI of 30% and between-cluster variance of 0.7. The number of flocks to be sampled was stratified by region according to the number of poultry farms, total number of poultry, number of people and number of backyard poultry present in each region. A confidence level of 95% was utilised along with a twostage cluster sampling method (Thrusfield, 1986) . The total backyard poultry population in Oman was estimated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Department of Rural Women Development to be approximately 10,000 poultry flocks (Table 1 ) with a median size of 50 birds per flock. The vast majority of the sampled farms raised local village chickens; however turkeys, guinea fowl, duck and geese were also present. Local veterinarians and animal health engineers from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in each state aided with the selection of farms at different locations. Inclusion criteria involved a minimum distance between two farms (>1 km) and <3 farms from each village. If only one flock was present at a farm, 10 healthy adult (>3 months) birds were selected randomly and sampled. If more than one species of bird was present in the farm, then two flocks would be randomly chosen and 10 birds sampled from each flock. If there were fewer than 10 birds within a chosen flock, then all were sampled. For detection of respiratory viruses, oropharyngeal swabs were collected from each flock and pooled into 1.5 ml distilled water in a sterile 5 ml plastic bijou container. All samples were kept cool in crushed ice within a thermal-box and brought to the nearby Veterinary Research Centre. The bijou was vortexed and 100 μl was inoculated into the centre of a Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) card (Sigma Aldrich, Dorset, UK) using a sterile pipette and tips. Cards were left to dry for 1 hour at room temperature (22°C), away from direct light sources, then stored at 4°C in air-tight plastic bags. Samples were transported to the University of Liverpool, UK, for processing and analysis. Data such as sampling date, farm location (village, state, and region), species of birds, flock size, species of sampled birds, housing conditions, and water sources were recorded for each farm. Spatial coordinates of the location were recorded using GPS (Garmin GPS MAP 62s, USA).
