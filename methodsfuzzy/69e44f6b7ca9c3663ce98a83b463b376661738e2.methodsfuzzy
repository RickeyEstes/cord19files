We retrieved the coordinates data of SARS-CoV spike RBD complexed with human ACE2 peptidase domain (F. Li et al., 2005) (PDB code: 2AJF) from the protein data bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000) . There are two complexes in the asymmetric unit of crystal (F. Li et al., 2005) . The structural differences between the two complexes are mainly due to the conformational changes of cellular receptors rather than those of viral RBDs. As a membrane-associated vasopeptidase, ACE2 had a shell-like catalytic extracellular domain (Towler et al., 2004) , and its active site is deeply buried in a long cleft whose two sides are just the two lobes of the shell. After the engagement of substrate or inhibitor, the two lobes will exhibit a large hingebending movement toward each other to put relevant residues into right positions for catalysis. In the coordinates file, one ACE2-RBD complex (the complex AE with the chain A for ACE2 and the chain E for RBD) contains a fully open receptor while the other (the complex BF with the chain B for ACE2 and the chain F for RBD) has a slightly closed counterpart. Thus, as revealed in previous studies (F. Li et al., 2005; Towler et al., 2004) , the former enzyme was in a free form whereas the latter in an inhibitor-bound state. However, both biochemical and structural researches (F. Li et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005b; Wong et al., 2004) indicated that the human receptor-binding activity of RBD is independent of this open-to-closed conformational transition. Hence, the two complex structures are respectively subject to structural bioinformatics analyses for further comparison. The in silicon analyses included three steps. Firstly, the contact map analysis (CMA) (Sobolev et al., 2005) was employed to define the contacting residues across the complex interfaces. Here, we focused on the two RBD residues (ASN479 and THR487) because their importance in the adaptation of SARS-CoV spike protein to human ACE2 has been biochemically and structurally clarified (F. Li et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005b) . Additionally, those spike or ACE2 residues forming side chain contacts with the two focused positions are also under study due to their potential roles involved in the geometric and chemical complementarity of binding surface. After the definition of contacting residues, the RosettaDesign web server (Liu and Kuhlman, 2006) is consulted to redesign the interactions between RBD and receptor. In this step, the RBD positions 479 and 487 plus their contacting sites on the two binding partners are virtually mutated to mimic the contacts between the RBDs of three representative viral isolates and the ACE2 of four host species (F. Li et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005b) . The three viral strains includes TOR2 (GenBank Accession No.: AY274119), GD (GenBank Accession No.: AY525636) and SZ3 (GenBank Accession No.: AY304486) which are isolated from the human patient during the serious pandemic in late 2003 (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) , from the human patient of the mild infection case in the reemergence of 2004 (Consortium, 2004) , and from the civet cat Table 1 Redesigned residues of three representative viral isolates spike receptor-binding domain 479 487 Li et al., 2005; Li et al., , 2005b . As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the RBD positions 479 and 487 plus their contacting ACE2 sites of species-specific residue are redesigned according to the sequence content variations of viral isolates and host receptors identified as crucial determinants for receptor recognition (F. Li et al., 2005; Li et al., 2006 Li et al., , 2005b . Those residues, within RBD or ACE2, forming side chain contacts with the redesigned residues, are also repacked to accommodate the structural variations. Except the two categories of residues to be redesigned or repacked, all the others remained untouched in the complex structure. These computational simulations could serve as a reliable indicator for the validation of our structural bioinformatics approaches in this case, depending on its reproduction of receptor-binding pattern generated in the experimental investigations. Finally, the redesigned ACE2-RBD complex structure models are submitted to the FOLDX web server (Schymkowitz et al., 2005) , an online empirical force field, to assess the effect of mutations on the binding free energy of complex and to measure the differences in the association energy between the wild type and the mutants. In principle, the lower the binding free energy, the higher the binding affinity.
