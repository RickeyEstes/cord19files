Variations in quality between hospitals might provide a public health opportunity iftransfers are being used effectively, but are they? As a starting point, we examine transfers of critically ill patients in the state of Connecticut. Data Sources: Data on hospitals come from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey. Critical care transfers are identified in the fee-for-service Medicare claims, using the 2005 MedPAR file. We included medical, surgical, cardiac, and bum units but excluded stepdown unitS. 32 We defined a critical care transfer as occurring between two hospitals (A and B) when a patient was observed to be in hospital A until a certain day, and then in hospital B beginning on the same day or the next day, and the patient used critical care in both hospitals. Network Visualization: Hospitals are represented as nodes, and transfers form connections between the nodes that may be analyzed. 33 These transfers can be plotted, with nodes at their relative latitude and longitude. The network can also be visualized using algorithms that move hospitals close together if they exchange more patients.P' Finally, the networks can also be represented in a sociomatrix, a numeric table that facilitates statistical analyses (Fig 1, bottom  right, F, and supplementary table) .
