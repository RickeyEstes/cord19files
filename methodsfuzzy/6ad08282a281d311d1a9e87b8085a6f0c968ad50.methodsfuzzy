Biological Samples and viral Metagenomics 51 fecal specimens were collected from feral pigeons (Columba livia) in Hong Kong (N = 50) in August 2011 and in Pécs, Hungary (N = 1) in April 2011, then stored at 280uC. Droppings were collected without any physical contact with wild urban pigeons. Procedure therefore did not require animal committee ethical review. The field studies did not involve endangered or protected species. Fresh and well-separated droppings were sampled using sterile swabs which were stored in two ml of viral transport media as described [46] . The fecal sample from Pécs, Hungary was collected from a nesting 5-8 days old, clinically healthy pigeon into Hanks' buffered saline solution (Gibco BRL). Prior to the shipment on dry ice, samples were heat treated at 74uC for 50 minutes to inactivate viruses. The suspensions were vigorously vortexed and clarified by 15,000 6g centrifugation for 10 minutes. 200 ml of the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-mm filter (Millipore) to remove bacterium-sized particles. The filtrate was then treated with a mixture of DNases (Turbo DNase from Ambion, Baseline-ZERO from Epicentre, and Benzonase from Novagen) and RNase (Fermentas) to digest unprotected nucleic acids [47] . Viral nucleic acids protected from digestion within viral capsids and other small particles were then extracted using a QIAamp spin-column technique according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). For the single fecal specimen from Hungary, non-specific RNA and DNA amplification was then performed by random RT-PCR using a primer with randomized 39 ends [47] . Amplicons were then pooled, 454 libraries generated according to the manufacturer's protocol (GS FLX Titanium General Library Preparation Kit, Roche) and pyrosequenced using the 454 Titanium FLX+ sequencer. For the 50 fecal specimens from Hong Kong, pools of nucleic acids from five fecal specimens were generated resulting in ten separate pools. A library was then constructed using ScriptSeq TM v2 RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (Epicentre) and then sequenced using the Miseq Illumina platform with 250 bases paired ends with a distinct molecular tag for each pool. Because fecal specimens were analyzed in pools of five, the viruses identified are reported per specimen pool rather than for individual specimens. The 454 and Illumina singleton reads and assembled contigs greater than 100-bp were compared to the GenBank protein databases using BLASTx. An E value of 10 25 was used as the cutoff value for significant hits. The sequence data from the MiSeq run is in the short read archive at GenBank accession number SRX263026.
