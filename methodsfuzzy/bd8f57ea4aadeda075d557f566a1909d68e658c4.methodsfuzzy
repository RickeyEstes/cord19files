To further expand the iLACO detection capability, we also checked the UV or Blue light stimulated fluorescence signal. We added SYBR green dye into the reaction mix prior to adding the sample. After 20 minutes incubation in 65 degree, the signal was observed with Gel imaging system (Fig. 4A ). SYBR green in positive reactions was observed clearly in positive reaction. We also chose a new type of nucleic acid dye GeneFinder TM , which has enhanced fluorescent signal and sensitivity. By exposing under Blue light, green fluorescence was observed clearly with naked eye in the positive reaction, whereas it remained original pink in the negative control (Fig. 4B) . author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
