Monitoring methods used for LAMP are commonly adopted procedures developed earlier for PCR and other bio-molecular techniques. Their utilization for LAMP has been extensively studied and was summarized [63] . Mainstream detection methods of LAMP results often rely on naked-eye monitoring to observe precipitates [22] , DNA-binding dyes [64] , and colorimetric indicators [65] . Off-chip end-point detections are commonly conducted by performing gel electrophoresis [66] . There are also real-time monitoring optical methods, such as turbidity measurement monitoring optical attenuation of the fluid [67] and fluorescence with a suitable dye [68] . Electrochemical methods can also be either real-time or endpoint detected, and they are also commonly used for LAMP monitoring, either in form of a sensor [69] or biosensor [70] . Finally, there are antibody-based methods such as immunochromatic technique (lateral flow dipstick) [71] and the gold standard for protein detection such as antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [72] . Besides these major techniques, researchers have also tested numerous other methods based on a nano-Au probe [73] , field effect transistors [74] , surface plasmon resonance [75] , bioluminescence [76, 77] , or the giant magnetoresistive effect [78] . Nevertheless, compared with mainstream detection methods, these techniques are not commonly used as they require chemical preparation or additional instruments to perform product detection.
