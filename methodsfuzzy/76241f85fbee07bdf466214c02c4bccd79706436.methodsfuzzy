Sample Processing and Genome Discovery CRESS-DNA viruses were investigated in a variety of marine invertebrate species that were collected as samples of opportunity ( Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 ). Specimens were identified with the highest degree of taxonomic resolution possible based on morphology. Whole organisms or tissue sections were serially rinsed three times using sterile SM Buffer [0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgSO 4 ]. Viral particles were partially purified from each specimen prior to DNA extraction. For this purpose, samples were homogenized in one of two ways depending on the size of the specimen. Smaller organisms or dissected tissues that could be placed in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube were homogenized in 1 ml of sterile SM Buffer through bead-beating using 1.0 mm sterile glass beads in a bead beater (Biospec Products). Homogenates were then centrifuged at 6000 × g for 6 min. Larger organisms or tissues of dissected organisms, such as muscle or gonads, were placed in a gentleMACS TM M tube (Miltenyl Biotec) containing 3 ml of sterile SM buffer. Samples were then homogenized using a gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyl Biotec) followed by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 9 min. The supernatant from both homogenization methods was filtered through a 0.45 µm Sterivex filter (Millipore) and nucleic acids were extracted from 200 µl of filtrate using the QIAmp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen). DNA extracts were amplified through RCA using the illustra TempliPhi Amplification kit (GE Healthcare) to enrich for small circular templates (Kim et al., 2008; Kim and Bae, 2011) . RCA-amplified DNA was digested with a suite of FastDigest restriction enzymes (Life Technologies; BamHI, EcoRV, PdmI, HindIII, KpnI, PstI, XhoI, SmaI, BgiII, EcoRI, XbaI, and NcoI) following manufacturer's instructions in separate reactions to obtain complete, unit-length genomes for downstream cloning and sequencing. Restriction enzyme digested products were resolved on an agarose gel and bands ranging in size from 1000 to 4000 bp were excised and cleaned using the Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research). Products resulting from blunt-cutting enzyme digestions were cloned using the CloneJET PCR Cloning kit (Life Technologies), whereas products containing sticky ends were cloned using pGEM-3Zf(+) vectors (Promega) pre-digested with the appropriate enzyme. All clones were commercially Sanger sequenced using vector primers and genomes exhibiting significant similarities to eukaryotic CRESS-DNA viruses were completed through primer walking.
