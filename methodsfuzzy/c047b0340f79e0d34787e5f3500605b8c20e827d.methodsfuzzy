Primer design. All RSV sequences available (August 2012) with lengths of Ͼ14,000 nt were collected and sorted by group, yielding 138 RSVA and 38 RSVB genomes. The sequences for each group were pooled and sliced into 33-nt strings with a 1-nt step size. The 33-mers were filtered to remove sequences with ambiguous nucleotides, and the frequency of each sequence within the set was determined. The 33-nt sequences were then trimmed to a calculated melting temperature (T m ) of 58°C, discarding sequences mapping to human rRNA, with GC contents of Ͻ30% or Ͼ65%, or with a single nucleotide frequency of Ͼ60%. The RSV genome was divided into six 3-kb segments overlapping by 300 nt. All sequences were mapped to an RSVA or RSVB reference strain, and the two most frequent primers mapping within 300 nt of the end of each amplicon were selected. The reverse complement of the downstream sequences was prepared. To ensure amplification of the far ends of the genomes, two additional primers were included from the 5=-and 3=-terminal genomic regions. A summary of the primer sequences and their predicted target sequences across all known RSV genomes is presented in Table 1 . Clinical samples. Viral nucleic acid for sequencing was extracted from RSV-positive clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS] or washes) collected from children under 5 years old admitted to the Kilifi District Hospital (KDH) with severe or very severe pneumonia between 2002 and 2012. RSV infection was diagnosed with an indirect immunofluorescence antibody technique (IFAT; Light Diagnostics). Details of the study that provided the samples sequenced in this study have been previously provided (28) . Informed consent was obtained from a parent or guardian on behalf of each child before specimen collection, and the KEMRI Ethics Review Committee approved all protocols. Additional details on the samples are provided in Table 2. RNA extraction, RT, and PCR. Viral RNA was extracted with the QIAmp extraction kit (Qiagen, United Kingdom) from a starting NPS specimen volume of 140 l and final elution volume of 60 l. Reverse transcription (RT) of RNA molecules was performed with the forward primers for each of the six amplicons. A separate RT reaction was performed for each amplicon. Typically, the 20-l reaction mixture contained 2 l of sample RNA. A 5-l aliquot of the resulting cDNA was used in each 25-l PCR mixture. The PCR mixture was incubated at 98°C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 53°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 3.0 min and a final extension of 72°C for 10.0 min. Following PCR, aliquots of the products were run on a 0.6% agarose gel to monitor amplification success, and the products from the 6 reactions for each sample were pooled for Illumina library preparation. Deep sequencing. Sequencing of the pooled amplicons was performed with Illumina MiSeq. Samples were multiplexed at 15 to 20 per MiSeq run and processed as paired-end reads (2 ϫ 149 nt), generating approximately 1.5 million reads per sample. Raw sequence data were pro-cessed with QUASR (29) to remove low-quality (Ͻ median Phred 35) and adapter-containing reads, and de novo assembly with SPAdes (30) was performed. RSV contigs were identified by BLASTN analysis, and lowcoverage contigs were excluded. Where necessary, partial but overlapping genome contigs were combined using Sequencher (v5.2.4). All final viral genomes were examined for appropriate assembly based on length and the presence of the expected intact RSV open reading frames. Protein changes. After sorting by virus group (RSV group A or B), the genomic region under investigation was translated, the protein sequence was aligned using MAFFT (31) , and protein differences from the consensus sequence of the group were visualized and quantitated using Python scripts. Reference data set. A comprehensive RSV genome data set was generated from the GenBank database using as a starting set all reported RSV genomes. The search was conducted on 28 September 2014 using the search term "txid11250 [Organism]) AND 13500[SLEN]: 17000 [SLEN] ." Genomes with multiple ambiguous bases, lacking country of detection or date of collection (year), or from patent depositions were excluded. The newly sequenced Kilifi RSV genomes for each group were combined with those from GenBank in the subsequent analysis. Thinned representative reference sets were prepared by using the usearch algorithm (32) . Phylogenetic analyses. Phylogenetic trees of the genome sequences and selected genomic regions were constructed using the Bayesian methods in MrBayes program v3.2.1 (http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/index .php) under the general time reversible model of evolution. RSVA and RSVB were analyzed separately using both the total data set and the thinned data sets. The viruses within the groups were assigned to genotypes based on the clustering pattern of the G ORF portion sequences with reference sequences representative of the previously described RSV genotypes: for RSVA, strains representing GA1-7, SAA1, and ON1, and for RSVB, strains representing GA1-4, SAB1-SAB4, and BA (11, (33) (34) (35) . Phylogenetic trees were visualized in FigTree v1.4.2. Evolutionary analyses. Nucleotide substitution rates and estimates for time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) were obtained from the usearch-thinned data sets, using uclust to remove genomes closer than ID 0.99 (32) . The rates and tMRCA estimates were calculated in BEAST v1.7.5 (36) both for full genomes and for the individual ORFs. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The final set of RSV sequences was deposited in GenBank with the following accession numbers: KP317916 to KP317956.
