Bresusch-Pagan tests indicate that ordinary least squares (OLS) are inefficient due to heteroskedasticity and therefore, we have used three variance components models for the analysis. The first one is used for the balanced panel data analysis, the second for the unbalanced panel data analysis and the third for subgroups of unbalanced panel data according to flight distance. The first model is a balanced panel data set taking into account 138 city pairs 2 still with HSR-air intermodal competition after the entry of HSR services and 132 city pairs without the entry of HSR services between 2007 and 2013. 3 Our initial set of independent variables is a mix of geo-economic and general HSR variables as well as air transportation variables introduced in model 1 in Table 1 . The aim of this balanced model is to isolate the general impacts of the entry of HSR services and the influence of the duration of operating HSR services after HSR entry on the overall air passengers in China without taking into account specific transportation variables of HSR, such as travel time, frequency and ticket fare. The first balanced panel data model is formulated as follows: where i and t represent entity i and year t, respectively. Y it is the dependent variable, being the number of air passengers on city pair i in year t. X it and β denote the vector of independent time-variant variables and corresponding coefficients. Z i and δ denote the vector of independent time-invariant variables and corresponding coefficients. U i is the specific intercept for each entity and represents all unobservable time-invariant characteristics of entity i that influence the dependent variable. φ it is the random error term. The coefficients for the timeinvariant variables will be omitted within the fixed effect (FE) estimator. With the second model, we analyze impacts of variations in specific HSR transportation variables on air passengers from the temporal and spatial dimensions, rather than estimate the impact of the entry of HSR services on overall air passengers. In this analysis, we replace the two Gfare ( (Bell, Johnston, & Jones, 2015; Nieuwenhuis et al., 2016) to separate the variations of independent variables into two levels. It can be written as: where β 1 is the within effect and β 3 is the between effect of a series of time-variant variables x it . Rather than assuming heterogeneity away with the FE, the BW method estimates how the effects of within and between city pair variations in independent variables vary over time and space on the dependent variable. Any timeinvariant characteristics (both observed and unobserved) are automatically controlled for, as the sum of their change will always be zero. Therefore, the estimations for time-varying variables in BW models are identical to the estimations in FE models. Additionally, a BW model includes random effects and allows for the inclusion of time-invariant variables β 2 , providing additional information on differences between city pairs that could not be estimated using a fixed effects model (for a more detailed description of the method, see . The third model is an extension of the BW model by distinguishing between various distance categories. In Fig. 3 , it is found that in the travel distance less than 600 km, the number of traveling HSR passengers is much larger than that of air passengers and the market share is dominant by HSR travel, whereas in the distance longer than 1100 km, the number of air passengers is much larger than that of HSR passengers and the market share is dominant by air travel. Therefore, we aim to delve into how the elasticity of temporal and spatial transportation variables differs in the two thresholds (600 and 1100 km) for three competitive distance categories (dominant by HSR, shared between HSR and air, dominated by airlines) to shed light on operational and planning strategies for companies. Table 3 shows the results for the balanced panel model. After the Hausman test, we reject the null hypothesis at the p = 0.05 significance level that the coefficients estimated by the efficient random effects model are the same as the coefficients of the FE model; thus, the FE model is more appropriate here for the analysis. From the FE model, the presence of HSR services has a negative relationship with the air passenger flows. The entry of HSR services will lead to a 27% (100 * (EXP (−0.3284)−1)) decrease in the air travel passengers. Furthermore, the duration of operating HSR services since the moment of HSR entry reflects a lag effect of HSR services on airline passenger flows. The negative coefficients of the duration variables are significant except for the duration variable of one year's operation of HSR services, which means that after two year's operation of HSR services, the airline passenger flows start to decrease more due to the substitution effect from HSR. This is because at the initial stage of HSR development, HSR networks had not yet been formed and travelers' awareness of the HSR alternative was not so high that the substitution between HSR and air was still limited. However, with the gradual and fast extension of HSR networks in China, its substitution effect on air travel demand has been increasing. Moreover, the long-term impact of operating HSR services on air travel is not linear, especially after 6 year's operation of HSR services there is an inversed growth trend compared to the previous years. This indicates that in the long run, the air companies try to adapt Standard errors in parentheses * p < .1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.
