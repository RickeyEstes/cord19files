The mass accuracy of the experimentally acquired monoisotopic peak was calculated for each potential metabolite, and is included along with the 13 C isotopic cluster for each peptide with their corresponding chromatogram. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ healthy volunteers (3 male and 3 female, mean age 43.8 ± 6.9, with body mass index within the normal range of 23.0 ± 1.0) were recruited for infusion. Volunteers were fasted and were lying supine with their heads supported in a quiet, temperature controlled (23-25 °C) room for the duration of the study. Following a period of acclimatisation, the first sample of venous blood was obtained from the arm contralateral to the arm used for infusion of apelin. Vials containing [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 were allowed to warm to room temperature and diluted with physiological saline to produce stock solutions, that were then filtered using a 0.2 µm Portex flat filter (Portex, UK) before undergoing serial dilutions with 0.9% sterile saline. There was no loss of apelin following this filtration procedure. Volunteers were infused with a concentration of 135 nmol/min of [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13, at a rate of 1 ml/min for 120 minutes, using a syringe pump, equipped with a 50 ml syringe and 16 gauge catheter. The second venous sample was obtained immediately after the end of the infusion. Blood samples were collected into 2.6 ml EDTA tubes, immediately put on wet ice and centrifuged for 7 minutes at ~4 °C, 4000 rpm and stored a −70 °C, prior to analysis. A previous study had used a concentration of up to 100 nmol/min for systemic infusion, where they obtained a therapeutic response in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and the highest dose was well tolerated 15 . The dose chosen of 135 nmol/min of [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13, was slightly higher in order to identify possible metabolites. Additional control samples were obtained from 6 donors (3 male and 3 female) within a similar age group who did not receive the apelin infusion for comparison. A full scan analysis of the peptide showed that the [M + 4 H] 4+ charge state was the predominant ion in the spectrum as previously described by Mesmin et al. 31 in their LC-MS/MS analysis of [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13. Therefore this was selected for fragmentation. A product ion spectrum was collected over a range of 100 to 1600 m/z and two ions were selected for SRM optimisation (m/z 424.6 and 408.55). The 424.6 ion corresponded to the b11 fragment and the 408.55 ion was derived from the loss of a methyl-sulphide group from the methionine on the b11 ion, as previously described by Mesmin et al. 31 26 . Peptide peak areas were integrated using the TargetLynx program associated with Masslynx V 4.2 (Waters), and peak area ratios were generated against the corresponding stable isotope-labelled internal standard peptide peak. extraction of [pyr 1 ]apelin-13 from human plasma. Plasma samples were thawed on ice and 50 µl transferred into protein LoBind Eppendorf tubes containing 25 µl GuHCl (6 M). A 300 µl aliquot of 80% ACN in water (containing 25 ng/ml internal standard) was added to all plasma samples and vortexed before centrifuging at 12000 x g for 5 minutes to precipitate plasma proteins. The supernatant was transferred to a 1 ml protein LoBind 96-well plate and evaporated. Samples were reconstituted in 500 μl 0.1% FA (v/v) and loaded onto an Oasis HLB Prime µ-elution 96-well plate (Waters, Wilmslow, UK) and slowly extracted on a positive pressure manifold (Waters). The columns were washed with 200 µl of 5% methanol in water with 1% acetic acid (v/v) and eluted from the cartridge using 2 × 50 µl of 60% methanol in water with 10% acetic acid (v/v). The eluate was evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in 150 µl 0.1% FA (v/v) in water and 10 µl was injected onto the LC-MS/MS system. precision and accuracy of the extraction method. Blank plasma was pre-incubated at 37 °C for at least 2 hours, to degrade any endogenous [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 and used to generate an eight point calibration line of custom synthesised [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 over a range of 1-1000 ng/ml. A 50 µl aliquot of each calibration standard (1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 900, and 1000 ng/ml) was extracted using the SPE method described above. Four levels of QC were also generated (1, 3, 100 and 800 ng/ml) and extracted six times in order to assess the precision and accuracy of the method. Calibration line followed a linear fit, and 1/x 2 weighting was applied. Recovery of the [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 from plasma was assessed by analysing spiked solution before and after extraction at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. Plasma samples from six individuals were also extracted to assess the selectivity of the LC-MS/MS method. Peptide Identification using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Samples were reanalysed on a high resolution mass spectrometer to identify potential metabolites from the administered [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 peptide. A full scan analysis was performed using a ThermoScientific Ultimate 3000 LC system connected to a ThermoScientific Orbitrap Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer. Solvents used for the separation were A: 0.1% FA in water (v/v) and B: 0.1% FA in ACN (v/v). A volume of 30 μl of extract was injected onto a HSS T3 UPLC ™ column (2.1 × 50 mm; Waters, Elstree, UK) held at 60 °C and with a flow rate of 300 µL/min. A starting condition of 1% B was used to capture the more hydrophilic peptide metabolites, and these were eluted using a linear gradient up to 30% B over 16 minutes. The column was washed for 2 minutes at 90% B and returned to starting conditions for 2 minutes, totalling a run time of 20 minutes. Mass spectrometry was performed using positive electrospray mode with a needle voltage of 3 kV, gas settings of 55 and 10 for sheath gas and aux gas flow rates. The temperature of the gas was set at 350 °C and the transfer capillary at 350 °C and a s-lens value of 70 V. Full scan data were acquired over an m/z range of 250-1000, using a resolution of 70,000 and a maximum fill time www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ of 100 ms. Acquired LC-MS data were interrogated for potential [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 metabolites by searching for all potential cleavage products from the parent peptide in the RAW data files using the Qualbrowser software package (Thermofisher). The m/z values for these peptides at multiple charge states are displayed in Supplementary  Table 1 . The potential [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 metabolites that were manually identified were subsequently characterised, where 30 μl of sample was reinjected using a targeted MS/MS analysis. The potential [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) and [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) peptides were targeted using precursor ion m/z values of 370.214 (collision energy of 30) and 290.417 (collision energy of 22) respectively. The MS/MS analysis involved the same LC separation, but MS/ MS data were acquired at 17,500 resolution with an AGC of 1e6 ions, lowest m/z value of 100 and a max fill time of 200 ms.
