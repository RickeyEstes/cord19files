Mice. MBP TCR1 transgenic mice (B10.PL-H2 u -H2-T18 a [73NS]/Sn-TgN [TCR ␣ ]/BlJg and B10.PL-H2 u -H2-T18 a [73NS]/Sn-TgN [TCR ␤ ]/C14Jg [11] ) and MBP TCR2 transgenic mice (12) were backcrossed onto B10.PL (73 NS)/Sn for at least 11 generations. B10.PL (73 NS)/Sn, C57Bl/6J, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) TCR transgenic mice (B6, D2-TgN (TCR LCMV) 327Sdz [15] ) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Ovalbumin (Ova) TCR transgenic mice (C57BL/6-TgN [TCR Ova] 1100Mjb [16] ) and E ␣ 52-68:I-A b (TEa) TCR transgenic mice (17) were provided by Dr. Michael Bevan (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) and Dr. Alexander Rudensky (University of Washington, Seattle, WA), respectively. DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice were provided by Dr. Anne O'Garra (DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA). Mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free facility. The Animal Care Committee of the University of Washington approved all procedures used in this report. Antibodies. The following monoclonal antibodies were used for flow cytometry: PE-conjugated anti-TCR ␤ (clone H57-597), hamster anti-IgG (clone Ha4/8), rat anti-IgG (clone R35-95), anti-CD3 (clone 17A2), anti-V ␤ 8.1,8.2 (clone MR5-2), and anti-V ␣ 2 (clone B20.1); FITC-conjugated anti-CD44 (clone IM7), anti-IgG (clone R35-95), anti-CD3 (clone 500-A2), anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5), anti-CD8 (clone 53-6.7), anti-TCR ␤ (clone H57.597), and anti-CD45RB (clone 16A); biotin-conjugated anti-TCR ␤ (clone H57.597), anti-CD49d (clone R1-2), anti-IgG (clone R35-95), anti-V ␤ 8 (clone MR 5-2), anti-CD45R (clone RA3-6B2), anti-CD8 (clone 53-6.7), anti-V ␣ 2 (clone B20.1), anti-CD4 (clone RM 4-5), anti-CD45RB (clone 16A), and anti-CD62L (clone MEL-14); and purified anti-CD16/CD32 (Fc ␥ III/II receptor, clone 2.4 G2). All monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD PharMingen except anti-CD3, which was purchased from Caltag. Biotin-conjugated primary monoclonal antibodies were detected by streptavidin-conjugated Tricolor from Caltag. Flow Cytometry. Single-cell suspensions (10 6 ) of splenocytes, LN cells, or CNS cells (10 5 ) were resuspended in 10 l of whole mouse serum and anti-CD16/CD32 (0.05 g/ml) for 15 min at room temperature (RT). Samples were then incubated for 30 min at RT in the dark with primary antibodies diluted in 50 l of FACS ® staining buffer (FSB [0.05% sodium azide and 5% FCS; Atlanta Biologicals] in PBS). Cells were washed, resuspended in 50 l of secondary antibody diluted in FSB, and incubated for 20 min at RT. Cells were washed and resuspended in either 300 l of FSB or fixed in FSB with 0.37% formaldehyde. Cells (at least 3 ϫ 10 5 per sample) were analyzed with a FACScan™ flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Fluorescence is plotted on a log scale. Lymphocyte Isolation. Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of xylazine (7 mg/kg), ketamine (100 mg/kg), and pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) diluted in saline and administered by intraperitoneal injection. Deeply anesthetized mice were perfused with 50 ml of heparinized PBS via the left ventricle of the heart. The spinal cords were removed via insufflation and the brain was dissected. Both tissues were minced, dissociated with a 5-ml syringe plunger, and strained through wire mesh (Small Parts). After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 37% Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), centrifuged at 2,118 g for 15 min, washed, and counted. To prepare cells for proliferation experiments, pooled CNS samples were washed twice with 37% Percoll, resuspended in 30% Percoll, and layered over 70% Percoll. Cells harvested from the gradient interface were washed and resuspended in complete media (DMEM; GIBCO BRL) supplemented with essential amino acids (Irving Scientific), 9.5% FCS, 1.9 mM l -glutamine, 0.95 mM sodium pyruvate, 43 M ␤ -mercaptoethanol, 95 U/ml penicillin G, 95 g/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids. The amount of contamination of the CNS mononuclear cell preparation with peripheral cells was assessed using proflavin staining. Proflavin is a nuclear dye that crosses the endothelium of most blood vessels easily but does not cross the blood-brain barrier (18, 19) . In two separate staining experiments in which proflavin hydrochloride (20 g/ml) was administered intravenously, Ͼ 80% of the CNS mononuclear cells did not stain positively for proflavin (data not shown). Splenocytes were purified over a lympholyte M gradient (Cedarlane) and RBCs were lysed before staining. LNs (cervical, inguinal, brachial, and axillary) were teased with tweezers and filtered through wire mesh (Small Parts) to create a single-cell suspension. In some experiments, cervical and inguinal LNs were harvested separately. T Cell Stimulation Assay. Single-cell suspensions of LN or CNS mononuclear cells were plated at 1.5 ϫ 10 4 V ␣ 2 ϩ T cells/ well (MBP TCR1, TEa TCR) or 2 ϫ 10 4 TCR ϩ T cells/well (MBP TCR2, D011.10, and nontransgenic) in 96-well plates in complete media. APCs (10 6 /well) consisted of splenocytes from the appropriate wild-type mouse depleted of TCR ϩ cells by panning with anti-Thy 1.2 (clone 30-H12; BD PharMingen)-coated plates (20) , or by magnetic bead depletion using biotinylated anti-TCR and streptavidin-coated Dynabeads (Dynal). MBP TCR1 and MBP TCR2 T cells were stimulated in the presence or absence of 30 M MBP Ac1-11 peptide (Research Genetics) and T cell-depleted APCs. TEa T cells were stimulated in the presence or absence of 5 g/ml E ␣ 52-68 peptide (a gift from Dr. Alexander Rudensky) and T cell-depleted APCs. D011.10 T cells were stimulated in the presence or absence of 1 M Ova 323-339 peptide (a gift from Dr. Craig Beeson, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) and T cell-depleted APCs. 5-Bromo-2 Јdeoxyuridine (BrdU; 25 g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was added after 48 h of culture and cells were harvested 12-16 h later. Proliferation was assessed by staining the cultured cells with PE-labeled anti-V ␣ 2 (for MBP TCR1 and TEa transgenic mice) or anti-TCR monoclonal antibody (for MBP TCR2 and DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice), cell permeabilization, and staining with FITC-labeled anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (clone 3D4; BD PharMingen) as described previously (21, 22) . For assessment of anergy in CNS T cells, stimulations were performed as described above except in the presence or absence of 50 U IL-2/ml (23) . Statistics. The Student's t test was used for a comparison of the means between sample groups. Error bars represent one SD.
