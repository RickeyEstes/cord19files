Descriptive analyses were conducted to determine the change in number of cases performed, IHM, and LOS over time. Random effects logistic regression was used for the analysis of IHM, and random effects linear regression was used for the log-transformed LOS analysis. Unadjusted regression was performed to examine trends in outcomes over time. The effect of an-nual hospital lobectomy volumes on outcomes was examined by modeling yearly hospital volume by IHM and LOS, adjusting for calendar year, gender, age, Charlson comorbidity index (each score analyzed separately), province of care (using Ontario as the reference province), and the average volume per hospital over the study period. An institutional increase in volume of 20 cases per year was considered clinically relevant. We then examined the effect of changing lobectomy volumes within an individual hospital. Both absolute yearly differences from the overall mean per hospital and relative yearly differences from the overall mean per hospital were examined in multivariate models and yielded similar results. We present the results from the analysis using absolute differences in yearly hospital volumes. An institutional increase in volume of 20 cases per year was considered clinically relevant. In the multivariate model, volume was analyzed as a continuous variable. To present groupings of hospitals into low, medium, and high volume, the number of cases performed over time was examined using different thresholds for ''high volume,'' ranging from 50 to 100 cases per year, and ''medium volume'' as 10 cases per year up to the threshold of ''high volume.'' After plotting the results graphically, a threshold of 60 cases per year (or $1 per week) was determined to be clinically relevant as the cutoff for ''high volume'' because our data supported changes in time in institutional numbers at this value. Low volume was defined as fewer than 10 cases per year or approximately 1 per month.
