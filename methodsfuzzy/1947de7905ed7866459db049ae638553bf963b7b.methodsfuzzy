Mouse anti-HA (F-7), rabbit anti-HA (Y-11), and rabbit anti-caveolin-1 (N-20) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, goat anti-ACE2 (AF933) antibody was purchased from R&D systems, mouse anti-CD71 antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse and anti-goat antibodies, swine anti-rabbit antibody were purchased from DakoCytomation. Cell cultures. Vero E6 and 293T cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% new born calf serum and 50 lg/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco). Sf9 cells were maintained in Sf-900 II SFM (Gibco). Expression and purification of SARS-CoV S protein ectodomain. The nucleotide fragment corresponding to 1-1188 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV S protein were amplified with a HA tag at the C-terminus (S1188HA). Primers used were A (5 0 -AGTCGAATTCCGAAC ATGTTT ATTTTCTTA-3 0 ) and B (5 0 -GCCCTCTAGATTAAGCGTAATCTGGA ACATCGTA TGGGTACATCTCGAGATATTTTCCCAATTCTT-3 0 ). The fragment was inserted into the transfer vector pVL1392 (BD Bioscience Pharmingen). The resulted plasmid was co-transfected with linearized baculovirus DNA (BD Biosciences) into Sf9 cells. Successful recombinant baculoviruses were selected and amplified. Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 3-10. At 4 days post-infection, cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% Nonidet P40; complete protease inhibitor cocktail). The protein was purified using the anti-HA affinity column (Roche applied Science). Preparation of pseudotyped SARS-CoV. The pseudovirus was generated by co-transfection of pNL4-3Luc + Env À Vpr À and pcDNA3.1-OPT9-S or pVPack-VSV-G (Stratagene) into 293T cells using calcium phosphate transfection method. The culture supernatant containing virus was collected on day 2 and 3 after transfection and clarified by filtering it through a 0.45 lm-pore-size filter and concentrated. The virus titer was determined by the reverse transcriptase (RT) activity assay using EnzChek Ò reverse transcriptase assay kit (Molecular Probes). Single-cycle infectivity assay. Vero E6 cells (30,000 cells/well) were seeded in 48-well plates and cultured at 37°C 5% CO 2 overnight. On the following day, Vero E6 cells (untreated or treated with 10 mM MbCD) were incubated with standardized amounts of pseudoviruses (0.5 U of RT/ well) for 1 h and washed. After 48 h of infection, the cells were lysed in 100 ll lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined using luciferase assay kit (Promega). The resultant scintillation was counted for 15 s using a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Tuner Designs). Cholesterol depletion. The cells were washed twice with DMEM and then incubated with 10 mM MbCD in DMEM-0.1% BSA for 30 min at 37°C. Under these conditions, cell viability was not significantly affected, as determined by trypan blue exclusion. As controls, the cells were exposed to medium alone at 37°C. After incubation, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold DMEM-0.1% BSA before being used. Membrane flotation analysis. Cells (5 Â 10 7 ) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice for 30 min in 1 ml TNE buffer (25 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, complete protease inhibitor cocktail) with 1% Triton X-100. The cell lysates were homogenized by a Dounce homogenizer, and then centrifuged for 5 min, 720g at 4°C to remove insoluble materials and nuclei. The supernatant was mixed with 1 ml 80% sucrose in TNE buffer, placed at the bottoms of ultracentrifuge tubes, overlaid with 6 ml 30% and 3 ml 5% sucrose in TNE buffer. The cell lysates were ultracentrifuged at 4°C for 18 h at 38,000 rpm in a SW41 rotor (Beckman). After centrifugation, eleven 1-ml fractions were collected from the top to the bottom and analyzed immediately by Western blot or stored at À80°C. To investigate the presence of S protein ectodomain in lipid rafts after binding to its receptor, Vero E6 cells were incubated with S1188HA (10 lg/ml) for 30 min at 4°C, after extensive washing with PBS, the cells were lysed and lipid rafts were isolated. About 20 ll of individual sucrose gradient fractions were resolved by 8% or 15% SDS-PAGE gels. The proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and probed with primary antibody: rabbit anti-caveolin-1, mouse anti-CD71 and goat anti-ACE2 or rabbit anti-HA antibodies, then following with secondary antibody: HRP-conjugated swine anti-rabbit, rabbit anti-mouse and rabbit anti-goat antibodies as described previously. Bound antibodies were detected with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Flow cytometry. Expression of ACE2 on the surface of Vero E6 cells and the binding of S1188HA to Vero E6 cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. Untreated or MbCD-treated cells were collected and incubated for 30 min at 4°C with or without S1188HA (10 lg/ml), after washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with goat anti-ACE2 antibody or rabbit anti-HA antibody. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat or donkey anti-rabbit antibody for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, samples were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur within 2 h of immunofluorescence staining. Raft aggregation and confocal microscopy. To investigate the presence of ACE2 in lipid rafts, Vero E6 cells were first incubated with Alexa 594conjugated CT-B (10 lg/ml) and goat anti-ACE2 antibodies at 4°C for 30 min in PBS with 0.1% BSA, followed by extensive washing with ice-cold PBS. To investigate the presence of S protein ectodomain in lipid rafts after binding to its receptor, Vero E6 cells were incubated with S1188HA (10 lg/ml) at 4°C for 30 min, then the cells were labeled with Alexa 594conjugated CT-B and mouse anti-HA antibodies. Lipid rafts aggregation was initiated by incubation with rabbit anti-CT-B in the presence of Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody or Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody at 4°C for 30 min. After washing twice with ice-cold PBS, the cells were fixed at 4°C for 15 min with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde. In addition, lipid rafts ganglioside GM1 was identified by incubation with Alexa 594-conjugated CT-B alone. The cells were washed, fixed, and mounted with a ProLong antifade kit. Labeled cells were analyzed by a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope using 100Â objective lenses. The images were processed by LSM 510 META software.
