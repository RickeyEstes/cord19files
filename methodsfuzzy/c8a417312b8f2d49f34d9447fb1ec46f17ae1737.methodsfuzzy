The method of feeding colostrum is worth considering because this can influence the time to first feeding, the volume consumed, and the efficiency of Ig absorption. High rates of FPT have been reported in calves left to suckle the dam [57, 64] . This finding may be attributable to failure of the calf to voluntarily consume a sufficient volume of colostrum and delays in suckling. Edwards and Broom [65] reported that 46% of calves born to second parity and older cows had failed to suckle within 6 hours after birth. By comparison, 11% of calves born to first-calf heifers had failed to suckle within 6 hours after birth. These delays could be caused by numerous factors, including weak or injured cow or calf, mastitis or other illness in the cow, low pendulous udders or large teats, or poor mothering ability. It is for this reason that it is currently recommended that the calf be removed from the dam within 1 to 2 hours of birth, and that the calf then be hand-fed a known volume of colostrum using either a nipple bottle or esophageal feeder [6] . In national surveys, 68.1%, 70.5%, and 76.2% of calves were reportedly fed using a nipple bottle or esophageal tube in 1992, 1996, and 2002, respectively [2, 4, 11] , indicating that progressively fewer producers are relying on suckling the dam for colostrum delivery. Producers may have a personal preference for using either a nipple bottle or esophageal feeder for the first colostrum feeding. Although the esophageal feeder method is quicker, it is known that when fluid is given with an esophageal feeder, the esophageal groove reflex is not triggered, resulting in fluid being deposited into the forestomachs. This limitation is not significant, however, because outflow of colostrum from the forestomachs to the abomasum and small intestine occurs for the most part within 3 hours [66] . Adams and colleagues [67] reported that calves fed colostrum using a bottle had only slightly higher serum IgG concentrations versus calves fed with an esophageal feeder, but that these differences were numerically small and statistically insignificant. It is generally accepted that either method of feeding achieves acceptable rates of passive transfer provided a sufficient volume of colostrum is consumed [67, 68] . Veterinarians should train interested producers on how to properly use and clean esophageal feeders.
