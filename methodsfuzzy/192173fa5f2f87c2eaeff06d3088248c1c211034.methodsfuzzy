Study RNA Helicase 3.1. RNA-affinity chromatography for cofactor identification RNA-affinity chromatography coupled with proteomic analysis is a powerful tool to identify host factors that specifically interact with the subject RNA bait. The differential between functional and nonfunctional RNAs has robustly identified host RNA helicase as a necessary effector protein of proto-oncogene junD PCE and retroviral PCE (spleen necrosis virus, human T-cell leukemia type 1 virus, HIV-1). The proteomic analysis was followed by RNA-protein coimmunoprecipitation that demonstrated selective interaction of RHA with structural features of PCE. RHA coprecipitate with HIV-1 RU5 more abundantly when compared to equimolar amounts of HIV-1 R or U5 RNA alone. The combination of RNA-affinity chromatography, RHA immunoblot analysis, and PCE activity assays determined HIV-1 R and U5 RNA elements interact synergistically with RHA to facilitate efficient gag mRNA translation (Bolinger et al., 2010) . 3.1.1. Biotinylation of RNA 1. Generate DNA templates for in vitro transcription by standard PCR with primers containing T7 promoter sequence. 2. Generate biotinylated in vitro transcripts using the MEGAshortscript TM Kit (Ambion) in the presence of 15 mM biotinylated UTP or CTP (ENZO) and 135 mM UTP (Promega), using T7 RNA polymerase. 3. Treat biotinylated transcripts with 1 unit DNase (Promega) at 37 C for 30 min. Stop the reaction by bringing up the volume to 500 ml with DEPC-treated water and then add 500 ml of acid phenol. Shake and spin at 12,000 rpm for 2-3 min. 4. Take upper layer carefully into a new tube and add equal volume of chloroform. Shake and then vortex at 12,000 rpm for 2-3 min. Take upper layer into a new tube and add 1 ml glycogen, 2½ times the volume ice-cold ethanol and 10% 3 M NaOAc. Shake and keep at À80 C for at least 15 min. 5. Centrifuge 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Wash pellet with 500 ml of 70% ethanol. Spin at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Dry pellet for 2 min and resuspend in 30 ml DEPC-treated water. 6. Separate 1 ml RNA on a 2% agarose gel and stain with ethidium bromide to verify the presence of the expected transcription product. Subject the RNA to the Quick Spin Sephadex G25 exclusion column (Roche) to remove nonincorporated dNTPs using the manufacturer protocol. 3.1.2. Isolation of cofactors associated with biotinylated RNA 1. Mix the slurry of streptavidin-coated beads by inverting several times. The 100 ml aliquot of beads is suitable for analysis of a candidate protein by immunoblot. The 200 ml aliquot of beads is suitable for reactions to identify RNA-interactive proteins by mass spectrometry. 2. Supplement the beads with 5 volumes of binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 40 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 1% NP40, 2 mM DTT). Gently mix by inverting 3-5 times. Centrifuge at 1200 Â g for 1 min. Repeat these washes twice. 3. Supplement the reaction with biotinylated RNA. For candidate analysis by immunoblot, use 15 mM of RNA. For detection of RNAinteractive proteins by mass spectrometry use $8 mg. 4. Incubate for 1 h at 4 C with gentle rocking. Do not vortex. Centrifuge at 1200 Â g for 1 min and discard supernatant. 5. Add 1 ml of 2 mM Biotin blocking solution. Invert to mix, incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Centrifuge at 1200 Â g for 1 min and discard supernatant. Add 1 ml binding buffer, spin, and discard. Repeat this blocking step once more. 6. Add HeLa nuclear or total cellular extract. Use 100-500 mg for the small-scale candidate analysis, and $3 mg for the larger scale mass spectrometry-based screen. Supplement with 200 ml of binding buffer and incubate for 2 h at 4 C with gentle rocking. Do not vortex. Incubation with lysate may be repeated to enrich isolation of lowabundance proteins. 7. Centrifuge at 1200 Â g for 1 min and discard supernatant. 8. Add 1 ml of binding buffer, mix well by inverting, and incubate at room temperature for 1 min. Centrifuge at 1200 Â g for 1 min and discard supernatant. Repeat washing for three additional times. 9. Wash four times with 200 ml elution buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.2% glycerol, 2 mM DTT) with 40 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM, and 2 M KCl, respectively. Mix well by inverting; incubate at room temperature for 5 min, centrifuge at 1200 Â g for 1 min and save supernatants in separate prechilled tubes. 10. Dialyze the 2 M KCl elutants against binding buffer overnight at 4 C. Concentrate on Millipore concentrator columns or by SpeedVac; Analyze by SDS-PAGE. Downstream processing analyses are: staining with Coomassie or silver stain; in-gel trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry; or immunoblotting with antisera against candidate proteins. If cellular helicases are identified to interact with a specific RNA bait, additional experiments are warranted to confirm specificity of interaction. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and RNA-immunoprecipitation assays can be used to examine the specificity of interaction of the identified helicase with the RNA. The RNA-protein complexes isolated by RNA-affinity chromatography will be selectively competed by excess RNA in an RNA EMSA. A specificity control is necessary for RNA-affinity chromatography and typical controls are c-myc, gapdh, and nonfunctional mutant RNAs. An additional control of streptavidin beads without RNA bait is required to measure nonspecific enrichment of protein of interest. The RNA-affinity chromatography with total, nuclear, and/or cytoplasmic extracts provides interference to the subcellular compartment of an RNA-host protein interaction. 1. Synthetic RNA oligonucleotides labeled at the 5 0 -nucleotide with fluorescein (Dharmacon) are resuspended in DEPC-treated water (20 mM RNA). 2. Treat RNA at 80 C for 2 min and then 60 C for 2 min to facilitate native conformation. Incubate 3 ml of 20 mM RNA in 5.25 ml of DEPCtreated water, 3.75 ml of 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 1. 8. Plot anisotropy as a function of increasing protein concentration. Obtain the equilibrium dissociation constants (K d ) by fitting the binding curves to a single-binding site model on KaleidaGraph as described (Stewart-Maynard et al., 2008) . Calculate weighted averages and SD as described (Taylor, 1997) . Equilibrium binding conditions should be determined by varying the incubation temperature and time. For RHA and SNV or junD PCE RNA, incubation for 30 or 60 min produces similar binding patterns indicating equilibrium binding by 30 min. Binding temperature and time should be empirically established for each helicase and its corresponding nucleic acid. In both EMSA-and FA-based approaches, control dsRNAs should be used to compare RNA binding and establish a baseline for RNA-binding activity. Nonfunctional SNV-PCE dsRNA stem loops (termed mutAC which is a structural mutant of SNV PCE AC ), which lacks translation activity and does not coprecipitate RHA in cells, was used as control to establish a baseline of RHA-binding affinity. The minihelix Lys 35-nt RNA derived from the acceptor-TCC stem of human tRNA 3 Lys and the human 7SL 27-nt hairpin RNA further provided generic dsRNA controls that lack RHA translation activity. In order to generate maximum power for statistical analysis for binding affinities, we recommend that EMSAs and FA measurements should be repeated with at least three independent preparations of protein and RNA. RNA Helicase in Cultured Mammalian Cells HIV-1 virions 1. Incubate 1 Â 10 6 HEK293 cells/100-mm dish and culture overnight. 2. Treat with 20 mM RHA siRNAs or nonsilencing Sc RNAs as described in Section 2.1.1. 3. After second siRNA treatment, transfect cells with 10 mg pNL4-3 HIV-1 provirus in 1:3 DNA to FuGene6 (Roche) ratio. For rescue experiments, cotransfect 5 mg of siRNA-resistant pcDNA-FLAG-RHA or pcDNA-FLAG with 10 mg HIV-1 provirus. 4. Harvest cells from plate in 1 ml of 1 Â PBS and lyse in 250-500 ml of RIPA cell lysis buffer. Perform immunoblotting to verify downregulation of RHA from siRNA treatment. 5. Collect the virus-containing tissue culture supernatant in a Falcon tube. Pellet the debris and broken cells by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. Collect the supernatant and pass it through 0.45 mm filter. 6. Quantify the HIV-1 Gag p24 units in the supernatant. Use 25 ml of supernatant to perform Gag p24 ELISA (Zeptometrix) with appropriate range of standard curve (7.8-125 pg/ml p24). Determination of Host RNA Helicases Activity in Viral Replication 7. Incubate 2 Â 10 5 HeLa TZM-bl cells per well in a 6-well plate and culture overnight. 8. Infect HeLa TZM-bl cells with 0.2, 2, and 20 ng HIV-1 p24 respectively in 6-well plates by spinoculation at 1500 Â g for 1 h at 32 C. Adjust the volumes of HIV-1 containing supernatant to 500 ml with complete DMEM media. 9. Harvest the HeLa TZM-bl cultures 48 h postinfection and extract in 75 ml NP40 lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCL, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, and 2 mM PMSF). 10. Perform Luciferase assay (Promega) on 10 mg cell lysate (determined in DCA Bradford assay). The mock-infected cell lysate is a requisite control for background luminescence, and is subtracted from the sample wells. In order to further characterize the role of cell-associated RHA in promoting or restricting viral infectivity in target cells, equivalent amounts of RHA-deficient virions and virions containing RHA is used to infect target cells (like TZM-bl, MAGI, and PBMCs) that have experienced either control or RHA siRNA treatment. If cell-intrinsic RHA acts as an antiviral factor, then an increase in viral infectivity will be observed when RHA is downregulated in target cells. On the contrary, a reduction in viral infectivity is expected if cell-intrinsic RHA acts to promote viral infection in target cells. For reporter assays, including the TZM-bl infectivity assay, the linear range of detectable infection is determined in advance. This parameter addresses pitfalls of infections with high virus input that results in cell killing. We recommend titration of the infection parameters using range of 0.2-20 ng HIV-1 Gag p24 ELISA units. Alternatively, the virus multiplicity of infection is utilized in the range of 0.1-10. Infection or transduction via spinoculation at 1500 Â g for 1 h at 32 C results in uniform infection outcome. A further alternative to spinoculation is infection at 37 C for 2 h in the presence of 8 mg/ml polybrene or 40 mg/ml DEAE-dextran.
