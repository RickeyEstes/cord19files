Cell Culture and Metabolic Labeling PC12 cells were grown as previously described (lboze and Hutmer, 1990) . lb label granins present in the RER, PC12 cells were preincubated for 30 min in tyrosine-free DMEM (DMEM without tyrosine and with 10% of the normal concentration of phenylalanine) and then pulse labeled for 5 min with fresh tyrosine-free DMEM containing 100 14Ci/ml L-[2,3,5,6-3H]- The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 115, 1991 tyrosine (Amersham Buchler, Amersham, UK) . lb label granins present in the TGN, PC12 cells were preincubated for 30 min with sulfitte-free DMEM (DMEM containing MgC12 instead of MgSO4 and 10% of the normal concentration of methionine and cysteine) and then pulse labeled for 5 min with fresh sulfate-free DMEM containing 1 mCi/ml carrier-free [ 35 S]sulfate (Amensham Buchler) . To induce the synthesis of free GAG chains, PC12 cells were heated with the xylose analogue 4methylumbelliferyl S-D-xyloside (xyloside) . Xyloside, dissolved in DMSO at 500 mM, was routinely used at a final concentration of 1 mM . PC12 cells were preincubated for 1 .5 h in growth medium, for 0.5 h in sulfate-free DMEM and then pulse labeled for 5 min with fresh sulfate-free DMEM containing 1 mCi/ml [ 35 S]sulfate, all in the presence of 1 mM xyloside . In pulse-chase experiments, pulse labeling was followed by incubation in DMEM containing 1 mM xyloside and twice the normal concentration of unlabeled sulfate. [35S]sulfate incorporation into glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains continued to occur during the first 30 min of chase (see Fig . 4 B) , which probably reflected a relatively slow loss of radioactivity from the PAPS pool . In other experiments, the preincubation in sulfate-free medium, pulse labeling, and chase were performed in air at 20°C instead of 37°C, using DMEM containing 20 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, instead of bicarbonate. GH4C1 cells, obtained from L . Roman (University of Texas, Dallas, TX), were grown in a 1:1 (vol/vol) mixture of DMEM and Ham's F10 medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated (1 h at 55°C) horse serum, at 37°C in 5 % C02 in air. Cells were routinely passaged once a week and received fresh medium 3 and 5 d after plating. lb stimulate the accumulation of secretory granules, GH4C1 cells received 10 nM epidermal growth factor (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA), 1 nM 170-estradiol (Sigma Chemical Co ., St . Louis, MO) and 300 nM insulin (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 48 h before radiolabeling or immunofluorescence analysis which was performed on day 7 after plating . lb analyze the effect of these hormones on the rate of synthesis of Sgll and prolactin, control and hormone-treated cells were preincubated for 30 min in methionine-free DMEM/Ham's F10 and then labeled for 30 min with fresh methionine-free medium containing 100 14Ci/ml [35 S]methionine . After three washes with calcium-and magnesium-free PBS, GH4C1 cells were solubilized in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 1% (wt/vol) Triton X-100, 1% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge . Aliquots of the supernatant were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. To selectively label the granins present in the TUN, control and hormone-treated cells were preincubated for 30 min with sulfate-free DMEM/Hams F10 and then pulse labeled for 4 min with fresh sulfate-free medium containing 1 mCi/ml [35 S]sulfate in the absence and presence of the hormone cocktail, respectively. Analysis ofGranin Aggregates in the TGN ofPC12 Cells (Standard Procedure) Preparation of ?GN Vesicles. PC12 cells pulse labeled for 5 min with [35 S]sulfate were placed on ice to stop intracellular transport . All subsequent steps were performed at 0-4°C. Cells (two 15-cm dishes of subconfluent cells) were homogenized and a postnuclear supernatant (N1 .2 ml) was subjected to velocity sucrose gradient centrifugation as previously described (lboze and Huttner, 1990) . After velocity centrifugation, fractions (1 ml) were collected from the top of the gradient . In some experiments, 100-141 aliquots of these fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Fractions 8-10, which contained the peak of ["S]sulfatelabeled granins and which have been shown to contain [35 S]sulfate-labeled TGN vesicles (Tooze and Hutmer, 1990) , were pooled, slowly diluted with an equal volume of 10 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, and divided into aliquots (three per gradient) . [35S]sulfate-labeled TGN vesicles were then concentrated by centrifugation at either 23,000 g for 30 min or 110,000 g for 15 min . Membrane Fermeabilizadon . The pellet containing [35S] sulfate-labeled TGN vesicles (-I 141 packed volume) was resuspended in 100141 of buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml saponin and either 10 mM MES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 30 mM KC1, 1 .2 mM leupeptin (nonaggregative milieu) or 10 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.4, 10 mM CaC12, 1 .2 mM leupeptin (aggregative milieu) . After -15 min incubation at 0°C, samples were subjected to centrifugation (23,000 g for 30 min or 110,000 g for 15 min), and the entire pellet and supernatant were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. In some experiments, the standard procedure was modified in that various concentrations of saponin were used ; 1% (wt/vol) of Triton X-100 was used instead of saponin, or the pH and calcium concentration was varied (see text and figure legends) . In the latter case, the ionic strength was kept constant using KC1 . In other experiments, 05S]sulfate-labeled TGN vesicles were resuspended in 100 Al of buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml saponin and 2 mM MES, pH 7.4, incubated for 15 min at 0°C, centrifuged (110,000 g for 15 min), and the supernatant containing released CgB and SgII was supplemented with 10 pl of 10-fold concentrated aggregative milieu .
