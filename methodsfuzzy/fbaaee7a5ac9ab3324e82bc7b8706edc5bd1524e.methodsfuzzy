Cells, plasmids, and viruses. RS cells were a gift from E. Wagner and were propagated in minimal essential medium with Eagle's salts (MEM) (Life Technologies/Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA), 292 mg/ml L-glutamine, 250 U/ml of penicillin, and 250 g/ml of streptomycin (Life Technologies). Vero cells (procured from the American Type Culture Collection [ATCC]) and Vero cell-derived E5 cells (53) (obtained from N. DeLuca) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 250 U/ml of penicillin, and 250 g/ml of streptomycin. HSV-1 strain 17synϩ and ICP4 deletion strain KD6 (37) were obtained from J. Stevens. Stocks of KD6, HSV-GS3, and HSV-GS7 were propagated on E5 cells. For HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7, the medium was supplemented with 10 nM mifepristone, and infected cultures were subjected to daily heat treatment at 43.5°C for 30 min for three successive days. EIV Prague/56 was a gift from T. Lengsfeld and was propagated on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC) in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum as previously described (54) . Stocks of EIV were titrated using 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) assays in MDCK cells. All the cells were cultured at 37°C under 5% CO 2 . Chemical reagents. Mifepristone was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and ulipristal acetate was from D-Innovation Pharmaceutical Inc., Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China. Both compounds were USP grade. Construction of viruses. All the viruses were constructed using wild-type HSV-1 strain 17synϩ as the backbone. Viral recombinants were generated by homologous recombination of engineered plasmids, along with purified virion DNA, in RS cells transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, as previously described (41) . Plasmids used to engineer the insertions of the transactivator cassette or the GAL4-responsive promoters comprised HSV-1 sequences cloned from strain 17synϩ. HSV-GS3 (Fig. 1B ) was constructed as previously described (3, 35) . HSV-GS7 was derived from the intermediate vector HSV-17GS43 (35) , which contains an insertion between the UL43 and UL44 genes of a transactivator cassette containing a GLP65 gene under the control of a promoter cassette that combined a human HSP70B promoter and a GAL4-responsive promoter (31) . To place the UL38/VP19c gene under the regulation of a GAL4-responsive promoter, plasmid pBS-KS:GAL4-UL38 was constructed. The plasmid contains a GAL4 promoter inserted between the HSV-1 UL38 recombination arms of the plasmid pBS-KS:UL38Δpromoter. A GAL4-responsive promoter comprising six copies of the yeast GAL4 upstream activating sequence (UAS), the adenovirus E1b TATA sequence, and the synthetic intron Ivs8 was excised from the plasmid pGene/V5-His A (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) with AatII and HindIII, and the resulting 473-bp fragment was gel purified. For the vector, pBS-KS:UL38Δpromoter was digested with AatII and HindIII, and the resulting 4,285-bp fragment was gel purified and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. Ligation of the last two fragments placed the GAL4 promoter in front of the UL38 transcriptional start site. To produce recombinant HSV-GS7, RS cells were cotransfected with the plasmid pBS-KS:GAL4-UL38 and purified HSV-17GS43 virion DNA. Subsequent to the addition of mifepristone to the medium, the cotransfected cells were exposed to 43.5°C for 30 min and then incubated at 37°C. Subsequently, on days 2 and 3, the cells were again incubated at 43.5°C for 30 min and then returned to 37°C. Picking and amplification of plaques, screening, and plaque purification were performed essentially as described for HSV-GS3 (3, 35) . The resulting plaque-purified HSV-GS7 was verified by Southern blotting, as well as by PCR and DNA sequence analysis of the recombination junctions. Plasmid pBS-KS:UL38Δpromoter was constructed by deletion of the region from Ϫ1 to Ϫ47 of the UL38 promoter, i.e., by synthesizing two PCR fragments (one 437 bp and the other 550 bp) on either side of the deletion and cloning them into pBS KSϩ. HSV-GS11 was derived from the vector HSV-GS3 (35) and contains an insertion between the UL37 and UL38 genes of a gene cassette expressing the EIV Prague/56 HA gene driven by the CMV IE promoter. A recombination plasmid was constructed by the following sequential steps. First, an 814-bp fragment containing the region spanning the HSV-1 UL37/UL38 intergenic region from nucleotides (nt) 83603 to 84417 from plasmid NK470 was subcloned into pBS that had had the multiple-cloning site (MCS) removed (by digestion with KpnI/SacI) to yield pBS:UL37/38. A cassette containing a synthetic CMV IE promoter flanked by the pBS-SKϩ MCS was ligated into pBS:UL37/38 digested with BspE1/AflII, which cut between the UL37 and UL38 genes, to yield the plasmid pIN:UL37/38. The EIV Prague/56 HA gene was PCR cloned from cDNA prepared from EIV Prague/56. Briefly, RNA was prepared by TRIzol extraction of a stock of EIV Prague 56 and was reverse transcribed using Omni-Script reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNAs were cloned into pBS, and the clone containing the HA gene (pBS-EIVPrague56/HA) was confirmed by sequence analysis. The Prague/56 HA gene was subcloned from this plasmid and inserted behind the CMV promoter in the plasmid pIN:UL37/38 to yield plasmid pIN:37/38-Prague56/HA. To produce recombinant HSV-GS11, RS cells were cotransfected with plasmid pIN:37/38-Prague56/HA and purified HSV-GS3 virion DNA. Subsequent to the addition of mifepristone to the medium, the cotransfected cells were exposed to 43.5°C for 30 min and then incubated at 37°C. Subsequently, on days 2 and 3, the cells were again incubated at 43.5°C for 30 min and then returned to 37°C. Picking and amplification of plaques, screening, and plaque purification were performed essentially as described for HSV-GS3 (3, 35) . The resulting plaque-purified HSV-GS11 was verified by Southern blotting, as well as by PCR and DNA sequence analysis of the recombination junctions. Construction of expression plasmid pVP19c. Plasmid pVP19c was constructed by PCR cloning of the promoter and coding sequence of the HSV-1 VP19c gene into pBS KSϩ using HSV-1 strain 17synϩ virion DNA as the PCR target. Single-step growth analysis. Confluent monolayers of Vero cells were infected with HSV-GS7 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3. Virus was allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 37°C; then, the inoculum was removed, and the cells were overlaid with complete medium. Ulipristal treatment (10 nM) was initiated at the time of the initial infection. Heat treatment was performed either immediately after infection or 4 h later by floating the sealed dishes in a 43.5°C water bath for 30 min. The dishes were then incubated for 72 h at 37°C. At 0, 4 or 8, 12 or 16, and 24 or 28 h postinfection, two dishes were removed, and the cells were scraped into medium for harvesting and subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles. Infectious virus was then determined by titrating the lysate of each dish in triplicate on 24-well plates of confluent E5 cells transfected 24 h prior to infection with the expression vector pVP19c using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). Plaques were visualized 2 days after infection using an antibody plaque assay, essentially as previously described (35) . and the EIVPrague56/HA protein was expressed in Escherichia coli in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. After induction and growth, the bacteria were lysed, proteins were isolated in the presence of protease inhibitors, and the proteins were used to coat a 96-well ELISA plate, which was allowed to air dry. Dilutions (1:10 to 1:200) of murine serum were applied to the wells, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The serum was removed, and the wells were washed 2 times with PBS. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibody was added to the wells, the plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the wells were washed 2 times with PBS. 3,3=,5,5=-Tetramethylbenzidine was added to the wells, and the plate was incubated for 10 min and then read with a spectrophotometer plate reader. The results were evaluated based on the sample mean/negativecontrol mean (S/N) ratio. Statistical analyses. Data sets were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (no repeated measures [RM]). Unless otherwise stated in the figure legends, data are presented as mean values with standard deviations. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed for significance using the log rank test. No data sets that were analyzed for statistical significance varied in sample size by more than 3-fold. Ethics statement. The animal studies were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and were performed in accordance with the approved protocol (protocol 0541). All experiments were carried out in adherence to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and the American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines on Euthanasia.
