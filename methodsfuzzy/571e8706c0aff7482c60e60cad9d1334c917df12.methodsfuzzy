Sample collection and processing. At necropsy, portions of tissues were fixed in formalin or frozen at Ϫ80°C until further processing. For histopathological analysis, tissue samples were preserved in 10% neutral buff- For RNA extraction, 100-mg tissue pieces were added to 1 ml of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and a ball bearing in a centrifuge tube. Tissue was disrupted using the TissueLyzer (Qiagen) for 2 min at 30 Hz. Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ϫ g for 2 min, and then 200 l chloroform was added. Samples were mixed, incubated for 2 min at room temperature, and then centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 ϫ g at 4°C. The RNA in the aqueous phase was further purified using an RNA Clean and Concentrator column (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's protocol, including the optional on-column DNase digestion to remove residual DNA. RNA quantity and quality were determined by spectroscopy. Library preparation and sequencing. Sequencing libraries were prepared essentially as previously described (60) . Two hundred fifty nanograms of RNA was added to 10 l reverse transcription (RT) reaction mixtures containing 50 pmol oligonucleotide MDS-187, 1ϫ reaction buffer, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1.25 mM (each) deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and 100 U Superscript III (Invitrogen). The sequences of all oligonucleotides are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 42°C and then 15 min at 70°C. Then, 10 U APE1 and 1 U UDG (NEB) diluted in 5 l 1ϫ Sequenase buffer (Affymetrix) were added to reaction mixtures to remove the oligo(dU/dT) RT primer. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37°C and then 94°C for 2 min. To generate end-tagged molecules, primer MDS-4 and 2 U of Sequenase DNA polymerase (Affymetrix) in 5 l of 1ϫ buffer were added to samples, which were ramped from 10°C to 37°C over 8 min and then incubated at 37°C for 8 min. These primer extension reactions were performed twice to generate doubly end-tagged molecules, which were subsequently amplified by PCR. PCR mixtures contained 1ϫ reaction buffer, 2 M primer MDS-189, 0.25 mM dNTPs, 2 U KlenTaq DNA polymerase (Sigma), and 2 l library template. Thermocycling conditions were 95°C for 2 min; 2 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 40°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min; and then 15 cycles with a 55°C annealing temperature. PCR mixtures were cleaned using the Ampure XP reagent (Agencourt) according to the manufacturer's protocol but using a 1.4:1 ratio of beads to sample. Ten nanograms of library template was then added to PCR mixtures containing 1ϫ reaction buffer, 0.25 mM dNTPs, 0.01 M (each) primers MDS-9 and MDS-10 (bar code), and 12.5 U KlenTaq DNA polymerase. Thermocycling conditions were 95°C for 2 min and 2 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 40°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min. Then, primers MDS-200 and -201 were added to reaction mixtures to a final concentration of 0.2 M, and 6 more cycles with a 58°C annealing temperature were performed. Reaction mixtures were cleaned again with Ampure XP reagent, and their relative concentrations were quantified in qPCR mixtures containing 1ϫ LC480 Sybr Green master mix (Roche) and 0. Sequence analysis. In addition to the default Illumina quality filtering, low-quality sequences containing any N's were removed from further analysis. Low-complexity sequences with an LZW ratio less than 0.45 (the ratio of the length of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch compressed sequence to the uncompressed length) were additionally removed (60, 61) . The first 6 bases of each sequence, corresponding to the random hexamer used to tag library molecules, were trimmed from sequences. Snake sequences were then filtered using the BLASTN alignment tool (version 2.2.21 [17] ) to query a database composed of a draft (assembly 1) of the boa constrictor genome (16) . Sequences aligning with an expect value of less than 10 Ϫ8 were filtered. Similarly, sequences that aligned with the Illumina adapter sequences (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) or to X174 control sequence were removed. This filtering removed between 90 and 97% of sequences. The remaining sequences were searched against databases of viral protein sequences using the BLASTX algorithm, and sequences matching any viral protein sequence with an expect value of less than 2 were further examined. False positives were eliminated by using BLAST to align putative viral sequences to the NCBI nonredundant nucleotide (nt) and protein (nr) databases. Only sequences whose best hit and whose pair's best hit were to viral sequences were further considered. The PRICE de novo targeted genome assembler was used to generate initial contiguous virus sequences (G. Ruby; freely available at: http://derisilab.ucsf.edu /software/price/index.html). For coverage information, reads were aligned to Sanger validated assemblies using the Bowtie2 alignment software, version 2.0.0 (62) . Sanger sequencing and RACE. Virus genome sequences assembled from deep sequencing reads were validated using Sanger sequencing and RACE. Primer sequences are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. PCR mixtures contained 1ϫ reaction buffer, 0.25 M primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 2 U Taq DNA polymerase, and 0.25 l cDNA. Thermocycling consisted of 95°C for 2 min and then 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min. Amplicons were purified from agarose gels using the PureLink gel extraction kit (Invitrogen) and cloned into the pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cloned amplicons were Sanger sequenced (Quintara Biosciences). Because the viral genome segments are predicted to exist in genomic and antigenomic forms, 5= RACE was used to obtain both end sequences, essentially as described elsewhere (63), with primers listed in Table S1 . Multiple RACE amplicons were cloned and sequenced as described above. In cases where RACE amplicons did not extend to the end of the deep sequencing assemblies, the deep sequence coverage was sufficient to determine the terminal sequences. The complete genome sequences of CASV and GGV have been deposited with the NCBI under accession numbers JQ717261 to JQ717264. Antibody production. A peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 14 amino acids (SGGKKTKDPTPATI) of the nucleoprotein of GGV was synthesized and injected into rabbits for polyclonal antibody production (Pacific Immunology). Quantitative PCR. Quantitative PCRs to monitor viral RNA levels in tissues and in culture replication experiments were performed on an LC480 instrument (Roche). RNA was extracted from tissue as described above or from tissue culture supernatant using the ZR viral RNA kit (Zymo Research). Reverse transcription reactions were performed as described for library preparation but used random hexamer priming. qPCR mixtures contained 1ϫ LC480 Sybr Green master mix (Roche), 0.1 M (each) primer (listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material), and 5 l of 1:20-diluted cDNA. Phylogenetic analysis. The BLASTP alignment tool was used to query the NCBI nr database for sequences similar to predicted viral protein sequences, and sequences producing alignments with an expect value of less than 10 Ϫ6 were downloaded. The CD-HIT software version 4.0 (64) was used to collapse sequences with greater than 90% pairwise amino acid identity. Multiple-sequence alignments were created using Clustal (version 2.1) using default parameters (65) . Maximum likelihood phylogenies were created using PhyML (PhyML plugin for Geneious version 2.0.12) using the LG model of amino acid substitutions, 100 bootstrap replicates, and otherwise default parameters (66) . Western blotting. Tissues and cells were homogenized in ice-cold buffer containing 40 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 120 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.3% SDS, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche). Samples were rotated for 30 min and then clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 ϫ g at 4°C. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagent (Pierce). Five micrograms (cells) or 25 g (tissues) of total protein was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with anti-NP polyclonal antiserum, which was detected with a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. The blot was scanned on an Odyssey scanner (LiCor). Tissue culture. VH-2 and IGH-2 cells were obtained from the ATCC and were grown at 30°C in Eagle's minimum essential medium with Hanks' balanced salt solution (University of California San Francisco [UCSF] cell culture facility) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 g/ml streptomycin, and 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) (cMEM). Vero cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 g/ml streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . To generate a continuous boa constrictor cell line (JK), tissues from a boa constrictor that had died of lymphoma were collected at necropsy and stored on ice until processing. Tissue was minced with scalpels, incubated overnight in 0.25% trypsin and 1 mM EDTA in saline A at 4°C, and then plated into culture dishes in cMEM and incubated at 30°C. Culture medium was replaced every 5 days. After 5 weeks, proliferation of adherent cells in a kidney-derived culture was evident and these cells were subsequently passaged weekly. For inoculation experiments, 500-mg portions of frozen viruspositive and -negative kidneys and livers were finely minced with scalpels, resuspended in serum-free MEM containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ϫ g for 2 min and filtered through an 0.45-m filter. Filtrates were diluted between 1:10 and 1:40 and used to inoculate cell cultures. Immunofluorescence. Infected or uninfected cells were plated in collagen-coated glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek) in cMEM. After 1 day of culture, cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, and then washed 3 times for 3 min in PBS. Cell membranes were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, washed, and then blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h. Cells were incubated with anti-NP antiserum diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h and then washed 6 times for 4 min in PBS. Cells were then incubated in Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Life Technologies), diluted in blocking buffer for 30 min, and then washed again. The penultimate wash contained 0.5 g/ml Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies) to stain DNA. Cells were mounted in Vectashield medium (Vector Labs) and imaged. Images were analyzed using ImageJ version 1.43 software (National Institutes of Health). In cases where brightness and contrast were adjusted, this was done so linearly and equally to all images in a set. Immunohistochemistry. Tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS and then embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and mounted on slides. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in graded alcohol, incubated in 1 mM EDTA at 99°C for 20 min, and then rinsed in water. Sections were washed 2 times in TBST (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.025% Tween 20), then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and washed 3 times in TBST, and then blocked in Trisbuffered saline (TBS) plus 1% BSA plus 5% donkey serum (Sigma). Sections were then incubated for 30 min in anti-NP antiserum diluted in TBS plus 1% BSA, washed in TBST, and then incubated for 30 min in Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody diluted in TBS plus 1% BSA and washed again. The penultimate wash contained 2 g/ml Hoechst 33342. The sections were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs), coverslipped, and imaged as described above. Sections were subsequently stained with hematoxylin and eosin and reimaged. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The complete data set for all samples is available from the NCBI Short Read Archive (accession no. SRA053624). The complete genome sequences of CASV and GGV have been deposited with the NCBI under accession numbers JQ717261 to JQ717264.
