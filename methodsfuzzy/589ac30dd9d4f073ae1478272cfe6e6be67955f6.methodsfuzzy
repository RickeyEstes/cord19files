This paper is based on secondary research, where findings from selected research within the scope of this study are reviewed and discussed. In order to address the focus question and cover relevant publications, the authors conducted a literature review on central topics including RFID technology, RFID adoption, and RFID applications within the context of healthcare. Literature reviews represent a well-established method for accumulating existing knowledge within a domain of interest. In this article we have applied a systematic review approach (13) . This approach is characterized by adopting explicit procedures and conditions, which can potentially minimize bias (13) . The research articles selected have been collected through literature searches using Business Source Premier and Google Scholar between the years 2006-2018. At first, the authors decided to include only relevant papers that have at least five citations, which lead to a low number of papers. In addition, most of these papers were prior to the year 2014. So, the authors decided to remove this constraint in order to enable the inclusion of more recent publications in this review. For the literature search, the keywords "RFID" and "healthcare" were used in different forms, in combination with the keywords "adoption", "patient safety", "drug compliance", "patient tracking", "patient monitoring", "patient identification", and "patient management". After the literature has been identified, the authors then skimmed through the abstracts to check the relevance of the papers to this study. After the identification of the selected potential papers, the authors then read the papers independently in order to identify the reoccurring main themes discussed in the existing body of knowledge. In total, 49 papers are included in this review. The following table provides an overview of the themes that are commonly discussed in literature, based on the scope of this study. Some papers fall under more than one theme or topic based on their scope and focus.
