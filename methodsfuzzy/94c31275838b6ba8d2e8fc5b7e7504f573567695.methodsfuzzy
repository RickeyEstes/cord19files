Prediction and gene construction. The HR1 and HR2 regions of BIV and FIV Env protein (GenBank Accession Nos. NP_040566 and AAB25466) were predicted by LearnCoil-VMF program (http:// nightingale.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/vmf) and the Coils program (http:// www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html) [12] . The codon usage was optimized according to Escherichia coli expression preferences. To get the DNA fragments which encode the 2-Helix peptide containing the linker SGGRGG, a group of overlapping synthesized primers according to the published sequences was designed following the method we described previously [13] . Then the DNAs of HR1 and HR2 were amplified by standard PCR method utilizing the DNA of 2-Helix as template. The genes of 2-Helix, HR1, HR2 with BamHI/XhoI sites at the ends were inserted into the BamHI-XhoI restriction sites of the GST fusion expression vector pGEX-6p-1 (Pharmacia). The positive plasmids were verified by direct DNA sequencing. The recombinant plasmids were named BIV-2-Helix, BIV-HR1, BIV-HR2, FIV-2-Helix, FIV-HR1, and FIV-HR2, respectively. Protein expression and purification. Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) transformed with the recombinant pGEX-6p-1 plasmid was grown at 37°C in 2· YT medium to an optical density of 0.8-1.0 (OD 590 nm ) before induction with 1 mM IPTG for 4 h. Bacterial cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3; 150 mM NaCl). Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 1%, and the lysates were incubated for 30 min at 0°C and subsequently clarified by centrifu-gation at 12,000g for 30 min at 4°C. The clarified supernatants were passed over glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Pharmacia) that was equalized with PBS. The GST fusion protein-bound column was washed by PBS over 10 column volumes and eluted with reduced glutathione (10 mM) for three column volumes. The GST fusion proteins were then cleaved by GST-fusion rhinovirus 3C protease (or called GST-3C, kindly provided by Drs. K. Hudson and J. Heath) at 5°C for 16 h in the cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM DTT; and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). GST-3C protease recognizes the same cleavage site for the GST fusion protein as that of the commercial PreScissionTM (Pharmacia). The free GST, or non-cleaved GST-2-Helix and GST-3C were removed by passing over the glutathione-Sepharose 4B column again. The resultant proteins were dialyzed against PBS before being concentrated to a proper concentration by ultrafiltration, and stored at À70°C for further analysis. Proteins were analyzed on Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and the protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce Biochemicals). Mass spectrometry. The purified protein in buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 was analyzed by using Bruker Daltonics Biflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Gel-filtration analysis. The GST-removed purified 2-Helix protein was loaded on the Hiload Superdex TM G75 (Amersham-Pharmacia) column with Akta Explorer FPLC system (Amersham-Pharmacia). The fractions of the peak were collected and run on Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. The peak molecular weight was estimated by comparison with the protein standards run on the same column. Chemical cross-linking. The purified 2-Helix protein was dialyzed against cross-linking buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 8.3; 100 mM NaCl) and concentrated to about 2 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (10 kDa cut-off). Proteins were cross-linked with ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS) (ICN). The reactions were incubated for 1 h on ice at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 mM EGS, respectively, and stopped by the addition of 50 mM glycine amide. Cross-linked products were analyzed under reducing conditions on 14% SDS-PAGE. CD spectroscopic analysis. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectrophotometer with proteins in PBS buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3; 150 mM NaCl) at 200-250 nm. Wavelength spectra were recorded at 25°C using a 0.2-cm pathlength cuvette. Each spectrum was obtained by averaging five scans at a scan speed of 200 nm/min with a step resolution of 0.5 nm. Thermodynamic stability spectrum was recorded from 25 to 80°C at five points (25, 0, 70, 80, and 85°C). Cell fusion assay. Fetal bovine lung (FBL) cells were used to propagate the BIV strain R29 in these experiments. The FBL cells were plated in a 24-well tissue culture plate at a density of 5 · 10 4 cells per well in DMEM. The following day, monolayers of FBL cells with or without a series of protein preparations were infected with 1:5 dilution of BIV R29 strain (cocultured with FBL cells at a density of 1 · 10 4 cells) for 3 h at 37°C. Then the inoculun was removed and DMEM (2% FCS, 0.1% P/S) was added to the cells. The cells were monitored daily for syncytium formation and the syncytia were observed at 200· magnification after 48 h incubation at 37°C in 5% CO 2 incubator. At least four random different fields of inverted microscope were counted and recorded at the percentage of nuclei numbers in polykaryons to numbers of total nuclei. Cell fusion assay was performed with high-purified GST, GST-2-Helix, and GST-HR2.
