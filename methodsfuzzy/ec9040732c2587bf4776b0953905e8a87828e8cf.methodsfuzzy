The quality of the data in the outbreak reports 29, 30 was poor and based primarily on a case series with historical controls. Neither study outlined when the control measures were initiated in relation to the progression of the outbreak. Bunning 29 presented the number of human and swine cases of Nipah virus infection (an epidemic curve) over the period that the interventions were initiated but do not provide a denominator for this data. The studies by Ozawa et al., Muniandy et al., Mohd Nor et al. and Arshad et al. 26, 36, 37, 40 describe the National Sero-surveillance program initiated post-outbreak to detect any remaining infected pig farms and abattoirs not already depopulated. The number of abattoirs and farms tested and proportion positive for Nipah virus is presented. All studies discuss the sampling strategy of the program, the results of the laboratory testing and subsequent control measures taken. To summarise the general level of evidence for each type of intervention:  Surveillance -medium quality (generally appropriate study design (cross sectional studies) and analysis but do not control for confounding factors such as epidemic pattern of disease, changes in population structure , changes in patterns of urbanisation and concurrent disease control initiatives)  Environmental control -medium quality (small sample size, insufficient follow up periods, inappropriate or no control groups, do not control for confounding factors such as seasonality and epidemic pattern of disease, focus on vector rather than disease outcomes)  Biological control -high quality (adequate sample size, control for seasonality, appropriate control groups, full description of intervention , full description of baseline characteristics of intervention and control groups, report vector and disease outcomes)  Chemical control-medium quality for national studies (sample size and follow up periods adequate, do not control for confounding factors such as seasonality), low quality for local level studies (small sample size, no or inappropriate control groups, report vector and disease outcomes)  Educational interventionslow quality (small sample size, insufficient follow up periods, inappropriate or no control groups, do not control for confounding factors including seasonality and concurrent disease surveillance and control activities, focus on process outcomes) A major limitation of the body of evidence evaluating prevention and control activities is the reliance on entomological indices to evaluate program effectiveness, as the correlation of these indicators with clinical indicators is relatively weak. 84 Of these studies, eighteen 47, 49, 52, 56-59, 61, 62, 64-66, 70-72, 74, 76, 77 use larval indices as a main outcome measure, and ten 47, 48, 53, 55, 57, 58, 61, 62, 65, 77 report adult mosquito indices as a primary outcome. Fourteen studies 38, 44, 49, 55-57, 61, 64, 66, 69, 71, 72 used numbers of dengue cases or dengue incidence as an outcome. Two studies 53, 58 reported that clinical indicators of dengue could not be used as no cases of dengue were reported from either the intervention or control site but were able to report outcomes in terms of number of positive dengue serology results. Five studies 45, 56, 57, 61, 74 reported data on knowledge, attitude and practice indicators, five 53, 56, 71, 76, 79 presented data on the uptake or acceptability of the intervention and four 57, 69, 76, 79 presented measures of cost or sustainability of the program. Seven studies had a follow up of 6 months or less, 44, 49, 59, 64, 70, 76, 77 four of less than one year, 38, 48, 53, 65 and eight had a follow up of less than two years 45, 47, 52, 58, 71, 72, 74, 79 . These studies are unable to All five studies were of low quality and did not control for confounding in their assessment of the effectiveness of the interventions studied. The study evaluating workplace-based surveillance for febrile disease was conducted over too short a timeframe to capture seasonal fluctuation in the incidence of this illness and no data is given on the sensitivity and time-sensitivity of the system. 34 The results from the study are also unlikely to be generalisable to a wide range of workplaces as the study was conducted in a tertiary hospital setting where there were well-established reporting hierarchies and electronic documentation of staff sick leave. The evidence for prevention and control interventions is derived from descriptive studies based on outbreak data from the 2003 global outbreak. 51, 63, 73, 75 Given the high profile of this outbreak and the laboratory resources available in Singapore and Viet Nam, the datasets used are likely to be comprehensive and capture all symptomatic infections, giving an accurate picture of the epidemic and any impact of prevention and control interventions. However, this type of data also presents major limitations. Firstly, it reduces the ability to determine the impact of these individual interventions from amongst the range of community-based and government strategies that were implemented at that time. Secondly, it is unclear whether any impact is generalisable to future outbreaks, as the studies are unable to control for features unique to the 2003 outbreak. These include epidemiological features of SARS (such as the fact individuals were symptomatic whilst infectious and the relatively low risk of transmission compared to an infectious organism such as measles). Thirdly, they are based on retrospective data and are unable to obtain data on confounders or contextual factors if these were not collected at the time. Of the nine included studies, five evaluated an existing or newly established surveillance system, 27, 33, 35, 42, 43 four studies evaluated prevention and control interventions in the form of education, 46, 60, 78, 80 which was combined, in one study, with behaviour modelling. 80 The surveillance program conducted in Indonesia also incorporated a prevention and control component. With the exception of the evaluation carried out by Perry et al. 42 all studies were of poor quality, with the most common limitation in most studies being inadequate evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the intervention, or if the assessment was carried out, the authors failed to present the results of the evaluation. In the study by Bhandari et al., 100 farmers participated in an educational intervention about proper biosecurity measures for the prevention and control of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). 46 However, no information is provided about the knowledge of the participants on this subject matter prior to the intervention, and it is difficult to attribute the results to the intervention. The study by Desvaux et al. conducted poultry market monitoring, surveillance of broilers and hens and surveillance of sentinel villages for the presence of HPAI. 33 The authors admit several constraints identified during the implementation of the program impacted on the quality of the study: insufficient training of field staff (collecting the wrong swabs), biased selection of market places and small sample sizes resulting in the study not being representative. Evaluation of the performance of the system was also needed. The study by Manabe et al. looked at how educational interventions in an intervention and control village influenced awareness relating to H5N1 and the accessibility of healthcare. 60 There were some differences in the intervention and control groups (the control group reported a higher proportion of farmers) and also differences in participants pre-and post-intervention in the intervention commune (greater proportion of participants reported a higher economic level post-intervention). The educational intervention was evaluated by a qualitative survey using face-to-face interviews with a relatively small sample of only 16 participants from the intervention commune. In an educational intervention in Cambodia, the study by Van Kerkhove et al. looked at training programs for village animal health workers following domestic poultry outbreaks in the area. 78 The study evaluated changes in poultry handling behaviours before and after educational campaigns. The study had some limitations. There were differences in sampling methods in the 2006 survey (preintervention) compared to the 2007 survey (post-intervention). There were also some demographic differences between the two study populations, and poultry handling behaviours were self-reported, not observed independently. Educational initiatives were also run in three countries in the Mekong region (Viet Nam, Cambodia and Lao PDR). 80 KAP surveys were conducted pre-and post-intervention. Unfortunately, other than one pre-and post-intervention score on the effectiveness of the intervention in Viet Nam, no other assessment was carried out (or presented) for the Cambodian and Laotian studies, so there is no data presented on disease outcomes. The study by Samaan et al. evaluated a rumour surveillance system based on information from internet news and public health mailing lists and chat rooms. 43 The study covered all countries covered by the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO), which includes several countries outside the scope of this review; however, the findings were heterogeneous across country settings. 42 The study is limited by changes in the form of data collection used during the period of evaluation, but aside from this the evaluation is wide-ranging and includes an assessment of the role of all stakeholders involved in the surveillance and prevention components of the program, the quality, clarity and adequacy of the program design, the quality of the data, program outputs and sustainability of the program. (16, 973) apparently free of infection. The authors comment that the surveillance system enhanced existing passive surveillance systems and addressed a gap in surveillance.
