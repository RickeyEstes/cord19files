2.1. Identity, properties and manufacturing 2.1.1. Identity Nephure™ is a highly soluble (>212 g/L) manganese-containing trimeric oxalate decarboxylase (OxDC) enzyme with a single subunit molecular weight of 40.4 kDa as determined by Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS). The enzyme demonstrates absolute specificity for oxalate as demonstrated from an absence of activity with other carboxylic acids of similar structure (oxamic, phthalic, furmaric, glutaric, 2-ketoglutaric, formic, acetic oxaloacetic, malic, citric, glycolic, succinic malonic and pyruvic acid). Furthermore, the enzyme has a high melting point, 65 C, and is active over a wide pH range (1.5e6.0). Optimal activity at pH 2.0 and 37 C is 90 mmol/min/mg. Using CLUSTAL 2.1 software, multiple sequence alignment comparisons of the wild-type OxDC gene from Synechoccus elongates (PCC6301) with the gene expressed in Escherichia coli BW25113 were conducted (Larkin et al., 2007) . Although the codon usage was optimized for gene expression in E. coli, the amino acid sequences of both encoded proteins were identical. 2.1.2. Method of manufacture 2.1.2.1. Raw materials. The raw materials used in the fermentation and recovery process included de-mineralized water, yeast extract, peptones, minerals including manganese chloride, pH regulators, kanamycin, sugar-based carbon sources and anti-foaming aids; all standard ingredients used in the enzyme industry. Anti-foaming additives were used in accordance with the Enzyme Technical Association submission to FDA on antifoams and flocculants dated April 10, 1998. The maximum use level of the antifoams if used in the product was less than 1%. 2.1.2.2. Cell line. The OxDC gene was synthesized using DNA sequence information from the gene encoding OxDC from Synechoccus elongates (PCC6301) available from NCBI Genebank: BAD79907.1 (native, full length). The gene was codon-optimized for E. coli expression. The codon-optimized gene was inserted into an expression plasmid, which was transformed into E. coli BW25113 (K-12 origin). The source organism (E. coli K12) is a non-pathogenic strain with a long history of safe use (OECD, 1986; EPA, 1997) , and the source of the OxDC gene template (Synechococcus elongates PCC 6301) is categorized as a Biosafety Level 1 organism (Joint Genome Institute, 2015) ; such organisms are recognized as not causing disease in adult humans. Since the Nephure™ gene is produced synthetically there is no risk of transferring unknown pathogenic or toxicogenic determinants from Synechococcus elongates to humans. 2.1.2.3. Fermentation, purification and drying. The production of Nephure™ originates from a pure culture submerged fed-batch fermentation of a non-pathogenic E. coli carrying an expression plasmid. Manganese chloride is added in the process to ensure expression of an active enzyme. All equipment is carefully designed, constructed, operated, cleaned and maintained as to prevent contamination by foreign microorganisms. During all steps of fermentation, physical and chemical control measures are taken to ensure absence of foreign microorganisms and to confirm strain identity. The recovery process is a multi-step operation designed to separate the desired enzyme from the microbial biomass and partially purify, concentrate, and stabilize the enzyme. Following fermentation, the enzyme is first liberated from the production strain by cell disruption. The homogenized biomass is then treated with buffered solutions, and residual solids are removed by a series of sedimentation and filtration processes designed to remove debris greater than the molecular weight of Nephure™. Nuclease is added to remove the remaining remnants of plasmid DNA. The resulting filtrate is then concentrated using ultra-filtration and diafiltration. Finally, the retentate is filtered through a 0.22 mm filter to sterilize. This resulting enzyme concentrate was the test article used in the studies found herein.
