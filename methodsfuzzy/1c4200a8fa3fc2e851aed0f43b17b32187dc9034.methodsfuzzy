Seven SARS cases were identified among autopsy specimens from the Department of Pathology, Peking University Health Science Center. All of these cases met the diagnostic criteria for SARS as defined by the World Health Organization. Clinical information for each of these patients is presented in Table 1 . Specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. All lung tissue sections were of 5-m thickness, and consecutive sections were prepared. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain was performed on these tissue sections. Lung tissues from three noninfectious pa-tients and four SARS-negative patients with pulmonary infectious diseases served as negative controls.
