Sample collection. Fecal samples were collected from healthy wild Tasmanian devils between September 2016 and June 2017 from four locations in Tasmania (Fig. 1 )-Stony Head (SH), Buckbys Road (BR), Maria Island (MI), and wukalina/Mt William National Park (wMW)-and from captive devils at two Australian mainland zoos in June and July 2017 (zoo A and zoo B). Devils were trapped overnight during routine monitoring by Save the Tasmanian Devil Program staff (47) . Fresh fecal samples were collected directly from either the animal or the traps or restraint bags during processing of animals. All samples were stored in liquid nitrogen or a portable Ϫ80°C freezer (Stirling Ultracold, Global Cooling Inc.) immediately after collection. After arriving at the laboratory, samples were separated into two aliquots to be used in the extraction of total RNA for metatranscriptomics and enrichment of virions for virion-enriched metagenomics. Metatranscriptomics: total RNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing. Samples were disrupted and homogenized in 600 l of lysis buffer with 1.44-mm ceramic beads using a Bead Ruptor homogenizer (Omni International) at 5 m·s Ϫ1 for 5 min. Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus minikit following the manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNAs were pooled based on their source locations at equal mass amounts, with each pool containing 6 to 10 samples. Prior to library preparation, RNA pools were depleted of host and bacteria rRNA using a Ribo-Zero-Gold (epidemiology) kit (Illumina). Use of rRNA depletion instead of poly(A) enrichment ensures the retention of RNA with and without poly(A) tails. Sequencing libraries were constructed using a TruSeq total RNA library preparation kit (Illumina), and paired-end (75 bp) sequencing of each library was performed on a NextSeq500 HO platform (Illumina) at the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics (Sydney, Australia). Virion-enriched metagenomics. (i) Virion enrichment and nucleic acid extraction. A second aliquot from each fecal sample was processed for the virion-enriched metagenomics approach, as described previously, with minor modifications (17) . Fecal suspensions (10%) were homogenized for 1 min using the Bead Ruptor homogenizer (Omni International) at 5 m·s Ϫ1 and centrifuged at 15,000 ϫ g for 3 min (Hitachi centrifuge, type CT15E; T15A62 fixed-angle rotor). Resulting supernatants were filtered through 0.45-m membrane filters (Corning), and filtrates were treated with a cocktail of nucleases at 37°C for 2 h. Viral DNA and RNA were then simultaneously extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) (17) . (ii) Random amplification. Extracted viral nucleic acids were pooled as for the total RNA preparations for metatranscriptomics described above. Pooled extractions were subjected to first-and secondstrand synthesis and random PCR amplification for 22 cycles using a complete whole-transcriptome amplification (WTA2) kit (Sigma-Aldrich) (17) . WTA2 PCR products were then purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) prior to library preparation and sequencing. (iii) Library preparation and Illumina sequencing. Sequencing libraries were constructed using the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with modifications as described in reference 17. Paired-end (100 bp) sequencing of each library was performed on a Hiseq2500 platform (Illumina) at the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics. Assembly and annotation. Sequencing reads were demultiplexed and quality trimmed with Trimmomatic (48) and assembled de novo using Trinity (49) . Resulting contigs were compared against the nonredundant nucleotide and protein databases on GenBank using BLASTN and BLASTX, respectively, with an E value cutoff at 1EϪ5. BLASTX searching was also conducted against a bespoke database containing all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein reference sequences downloaded from GenBank. Taxonomic information at the domain level (i.e., Eukarya, Bacteria, or Archaea), as well as for viruses, was assigned based first on the BLASTN results and then on the BLASTX results. Potential virus-related sequences were further categorized into families and orders based on their genetic similarity to their closest relatives and/or their phylogenetic positions. Similarly, assignment of viruses to the broader groups of their hosts (i.e., Eukarya, Bacteria, or Archaea) was based on their phylogenetic relationship to viruses with reliable host information obtained either using experimental or phylogenetic approaches. The genetic identity cutoff for host assignment was 40% based on the most conserved proteins, such as RdRp or DNA polymerases (50) . The threshold was set based on the intrafamily diversity of most vertebrate-specific virus families/genera (13) . The assignment of vertebrate host was based on phylogenetic analyses, in which a potential devil-associated virus is expected to either cluster within, or form a sister group to, an existing mammalian virus group. To compare the abundances of transcripts/contigs, we calculated the percentage of total reads in each library. The abundance of host transcripts/contigs was estimated by mapping reads against the Tasmanian devil genome using Bowtie2 (51) , whereas those of other organisms, namely, viruses, bacteria, archaea, and nonhost eukaryotes, were estimated using the RSEM approach (52) implemented in Trinity. For each virus, the genome sequence was further extended by merging related contigs from the same or different pools. Gaps in the genome were filled either by aligning reads to contigs using Bowtie2 (51) or by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Putative ORFs in viral genomes were predicted by the Geneious 8.1 software (53) and annotated based on similarity to previous published virus genomes. Phylogenetic analysis. Nucleotide sequences of complete or partial genomes and amino acid sequences from the conserved domain (e.g., RdRp) of the newly characterized viral sequences were aligned with those of reference viruses representative of the diversity of the corresponding virus family or species. Alignment was performed using the E-INS-I algorithm implemented in MAFFT (version 7) (54). The quality of the alignments was subsequently assessed, and all ambiguously aligned regions were removed using TrimAl (version 1.2) (55). Phylogenetic trees of aligned amino acid (all data sets with the exception of RHDV) or nucleotide (RHDV) sequences were then inferred using the maximum likelihood method implemented in PhyML (version 3.0) (56), utilizing the best-fit substitution model and the Subtree Pruning and Regrafting (SPR) branch-swapping algorithm. Analyses of virome ecology. Viral-abundance tables (Table S2 and Table S3 ) were generated based on complete or near-complete viral contigs and the percentage of reads mapped to them using Bowtie 2 (51) in each library. QIIME (version 1.9) (57) was used to perform ecological and statistical analysis to compare viromes of different populations. Within-library virotype richness (alpha diversity measured using the Chao1 metric) and dissimilarity between libraries (beta diversity measured using the Euclidean metric) for both virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were calculated based on levels of viral abundance. Statistical significance of differences in alpha diversity was evaluated by the Monte Carlo method (999 permutations), with a null hypothesis that diversity is equal in all libraries with a significance threshold of ␣ ϭ 0.05. Levels of viral abundance were also used to produce heatmaps and dendrograms from hierarchical clustering. Principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed on the Euclidean distance matrix as calculated in QIIME, and additional cluster analysis was conducted using K-Means clustering in R (58) . PCR confirmation and Sanger sequencing of RHDV. Contigs with high similarity (Ͼ97%) to RHDV were detected in one of the metatranscriptomics libraries. To confirm the detection of RHDV, RT-PCR was performed on individual fecal RNA extractions using the Qiagen OneStep Ahead RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and primers from a previously validated Australian RHDV strain-specific PCR (59) as well as two additional primer sets manually designed based on the current metatranscriptomics assembled contigs (Table 2) . PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories) in 1ϫ Tris-acetate EDTA and visualized using the SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Life Technologies). Sanger sequencing of positive PCR products was performed at the Australian Genome Research Facility (Sydney, Australia). In addition, DNA was extracted from fecal samples using the Isolate fecal DNA kit (Bioline, London, UK), and the presence of rabbit DNA was tested using primers targeting a 110-bp region of the Oryctolagus cuniculus 12S mitochondrial rRNA gene (60) . Rabbit DNA extracted from rabbit liver using the Bioline Isolate II genomic DNA kit (Bioline) was used as a positive control. Cleanup, primer trimming, and sequence analysis of Sanger data were performed using Geneious (53
