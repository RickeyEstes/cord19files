All 107 complete hexon sequences were downloaded from GenBank and aligned using CLUSTALO [23] against 25 sequences provided in this study. The evolutionary history of these sequences was inferred using the maximum likelihood method based on the HasegawaeKishinoeYano model [24] . Evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA7 [25] and evaluated using 1000 bootstrap replicates.
