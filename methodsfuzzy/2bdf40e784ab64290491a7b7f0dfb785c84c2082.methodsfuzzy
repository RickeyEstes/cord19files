In this study following good clinical practice guidelines nineteen study volunteers were recruited to wear one of two different types of randomly allocated PPE suits using the webbased randomizer software (www.randomizer.at) by the Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documentation of the Medical University Graz (IMI). The software's GCP-compliance (Good Clinical Practice) has been confirmed by the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety. Subjects had to perform four different tasks six times at 22˚C on one day and four times at 28˚C on another day in the local core facility clinical research center. Recruitment and data collection was done between May and July 2011. The study was registered at Clinical-Trials.gov (NCT03004690, "Testing of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)) after its completion since the aim was not to provide data for a certification or approval process for medical products or devices.
