In order to allow comparison of the effects of different inactivation processes, samples of different influenza virus strains (PR8, NC, H3, H5 and H7) were purified and diluted so that all the batches had the same virus concentration. Since the amount of contaminating ovalbumin might differ among different virus preparations, phospholipid content was chosen over protein content for quantification of virus particles. Each of the virus preparations at the desired concentration (0.5 nmol phospholipid/ml) was then divided in 10 independent batches: 3 of them were inactivated with BPL (BPL), 3 were inactivated with formaldehyde with 2 days incubation period (FA-2) and 3 others were also inactivated with formaldehyde, but with 4 days incubation period (FA-4). The last batch was kept untreated as a control. TCID 50 assays on MDCK cells were performed in order to determine the number of infectious particles in the virus samples before and after inactivation. The initial infectivity of the virus strains differed substantially: PR8 showed particularly high infectivity resulting in a particle/TCID 50 ratio of about 3, while infectivity of H5 was low (particle/TCID 50 ratio: 2 Â 10 6 ). Infectivity of the other strains was rather similar (particle/TCID 50 ratios: between 1 Â 10 4 and 6 Â 10 4 ). After the inactivation process we observed that all treatments had reduced the virus titers by at least 5 logs. In case of BPL treated virus, PR8, H3 and H7 were found to have no residual particles in any of the 3 independently treated batches while one batch of NC and all 3 batches of H5 showed some (though very low) residual infectious particles (20-50 TCID 50 /ml). FA, irrespective of the incubation period, was unable to completely inactivate the virus samples. Residual titers varied from 40 to 900 TCID 50 /ml with NC showing the lowest and H7 showing the highest titers. In the case of PR8 and H5, we observed slightly improved reduction in the residual infectivity after longer incubation periods with FA, yet this effect was not observed for the other strains.
