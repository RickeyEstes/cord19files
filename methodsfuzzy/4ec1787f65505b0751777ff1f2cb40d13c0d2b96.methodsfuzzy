Soon after the discovery of programmed ribosomal frameshifting, it was proposed that frameshifting may be a common mechanism for dual decoding of genetic information (Dinman, 2012a) . The existence of an alternative genome has been postulated, but it has remained difficult to identify. Most methods aim to identify frameshifting events, but very few can determine which produce functional out-of-frame gene products. A summary of methods to identify frameshifting events in mRNAs and out-of-frame products is schematically shown in Figure 3 . Computational prediction has proven very useful. First, one has to identify in mRNAs the requirements for a productive frameshift peptide: One might argue that a slippery sequence and a pseudoknot are a good predictor of frameshifting events, but-as pointed out above-there are alternative mechanisms that result in frameshifting (see also Figure 2 ). For identification of the frameshifted products, I propose three hallmarks: first, the presence of an initiation triplet (AUG or CUG) and a stop codon in +1 or −1 frame; second, a stable peptide that follows the 50-nt rule (Nagy and Maquat, 1998; Hillman et al., 2004) ; and third, the validation that the peptide is endogenously expressed. Validation can be done by low-throughput experimental methods, either using antibodies raised against the frameshifted protein or using genetic manipulations that ablate the frameshift protein without disrupting the zero frame protein, if possible. To identify frameshifting on a genome-wide scale, higher throughput approaches can be applied, such as genomic, phenotypic, or proteomic screening. Experimental methods include generation of frameshift-specific antibodies, reporter constructs, biophysical methods, and single molecule measurements. The most commonly used frameshift reporter is a tandem luciferase construct where the two luciferases with different substrate specificities are separated by a stretch of nucleotides of a length that shifts the downstream luciferase either one nucleotide up or down (Grentzmann et al., 1998) . The downstream luciferase will be expressed only if the nucleotide stretch can mediate frameshifting, while the upstream luciferase serves as an expression control. Alternative reporter genes include the use of fluorescent proteins (Cardno et al., 2009) , although the dynamic range of luciferases is generally much higher. This reporter can be used experimentally to confirm predicted frameshift events. One hypothesis is that the −1 frameshifting efficiency correlates with the mechanical force required for pulling the RNA pseudoknot apart. With biophysical single-molecule methods that measure these forces using optical tweezers, Hansen et al. have confirmed that unfolding of a IBV-based pseudoknot required ∼500 kJ/mol, compared to the theoretically determined 292 kJ/mol (Hansen et al., 2007) . Chen et al. have determined that a 100% confidence in −1 frameshifting is reached by an unfolding force of ∼57 pN (Chen et al., 2009) . Such single-molecule biophysical approaches may help to identify potential frameshift sequences, but as they require immobilization of the RNA, they will be technically challenging to implement on a genome-wide scale. An alternative is the use of single molecule Foerster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) (Aitken and Puglisi, 2010) . FRET is a useful technique to measure proximity of biomolecules. A donor fluorophore attached to a molecule can transfer photons to an acceptor fluorophore on a different molecule when both molecules are close together (generally less than 10 nm). Aitken and Puglisi have used this technique to label individual tRNA molecules with donor and acceptor dyes that result in energy transfer when in close proximity and correct orientation. This technique enables to monitor relative tRNA positions and movement of tRNAs on ribosomes at a millisecond scale. It has been used to identify ribosomal translocation events on fluorescent ribosomes on immobilized RNA sequences and predicted the slipperiness of various RNA sequences. Again, this will be technically difficult to implement on a genome-wide scale. All of the above methods will record mostly frameshifting events, but they will not validate the expression of an out-offrame protein. It is worth noting that frameshifting will most likely result in chimeric sequences composed of a stretch of zero frame peptides linked to out-of-frame peptides, which can be a small or large part of the overall protein, depending on where the frameshift site is. Alternatively, frameshifting could lead to truncation of the original protein, where a very small fractionif any-of the overall protein is out-of-frame (Figure 4) . Those proteins that have a sufficient predicted length could then be validated by raising specific antibodies against that sequence. In order to raise an antibody, one has to know the precise FIGURE 4 | Protein composition as a consequence of frameshifting. The original zero frame is shown in gray, whereas out-of-frame sequences are shown in red or blue colour. A frameshifting event is marked by the arrow. Frameshifting can result in chimeric peptides composed of the original frame and out-of-frame sequences that can form a small or larger part of the overall protein, depending on where the frameshift event takes place. It is also possible that more than one frameshifting event takes place within the same mRNA, thus resulting in mosaic hybrid peptide sequences. (A, Original frame; B, early frameshift with extended ORF; C, early frameshift with truncation; D, late frameshift with extended ORF; E, two frameshift events that switch back to the zero frame; and F, two frameshift events that produce a chimeric sequence of three different frames.) sequence of the frameshifted protein. Therefore, this approach is useful for confirming a known out-of-frame protein, but it is not amenable to large-scale genome-wide screening. In addition, the detection of an endogenously expressed out-of-frame protein does not necessarily indicate a functional relevance for this protein. In order to validate a physiological role for the frameshifted gene product, the best method is to genetically ablate the expression of the frameshifted protein while preserving the in-frame sequence. This can be accomplished by gene targeting with a gene sequence that harbours multiple wobble base pair mutations or mutating the frameshift motif, thus altering the RNA sequence but not the in-frame protein sequence. This is technically challenging and may not always be feasible. For instance, an OAZ3 knockout mouse model has been generated, where both the zero frame and the +1 frame has been deleted (Tokuhiro et al., 2009) . To my knowledge, no specific gene targeting of a frameshift protein has been done so far. Genomic methods such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) have emerged as powerful tools to profile RNA content in cells. RNA-seq is based on high-throughput sequencing of a cDNA library generated from cellular RNA. In its standard form, RNAseq enables the identification of indels, but will fail to identify post-transcriptional phenotypes and will therefore fail to identify programmed ribosomal frameshifting or dual coded genes. Nevertheless, ribosome profiling methods such as Ribo-seq have been developed that allow the identification of active translation, based on sequencing of cDNA libraries generated from ribosomeprotected fragments (Ingolia et al., 2009) . In this case, mRNA bound to ribosomes is first cross-linked and then isolated using, e.g., sucrose gradient density centrifugation. Next, a nuclease digestion step results in removal of mRNA sequence that is not bound ("protected") to ribosomes. The protected RNA bound to ribosomes is then reverse transcribed into cDNA and sequenced. Therefore, the precise position of a ribosome can be matched to the site of active translation. An adaptation of this method using the drug harringtonine to cause ribosome accumulation at initiation codons has allowed the identification of translation start sites and confirmed that many proteins are initiated at non-AUG or alternative AUG sites (Ingolia et al., 2011) . In this study, 44% of detected AUG start sites were unannotated, and a large fraction of these encoded out-of-frame peptides. Further uses of ribosome profiling have confirmed that the identification of frameshifts is possible using genomic technologies (Michel et al., 2012) . Although this approach is unbiased in the sense that it does not pre-filter genetic regions, one problem is the nonuniformity of ribosome-protected fragment reads. For instance, the preparation of cDNA libraries generated from ribosomeprotected fragments can result in over-or under-representation of sequence reads. This can be overcome by a computational approach that measures the cumulative subcodon proportion difference of ribosome-protected fragments relative to local subcodon positions. The authors have therefore combined experimental data from Ribo-Seq with a computational approach in order to identify novel frameshifted protein sequences. Using this approach, several new frameshifted protein sequences were identified, most of which were dual-encoded. The authors estimate that more than 1% of the genome may consist of dualcoding regions, and this is likely an underestimation. Further improvements to the method, including deeper sequencing to get better coverage of ribosome-protected fragments, will help to identify these genes.
