Participants were selected by purposive sampling. Purposive sampling is a non-probability sampling method where participants are deliberately chosen by the researcher according to the study requirement (Polit and Beck, 2008) . In selecting participants, representative and productive individuals were invited to enhance the diversity and richness of captured information (Polit and Beck, 2010) . Thus, participants with different characteristics such as age and work experience are chosen by the researcher to establish a wide range of information. Semi-structured, face-to-face individual interviews were conducted by the researcher. A semi-structured interview guide ( Fig. 1 ) was designed to elicit perceptions from the participants about their experiences working during the pandemic. The use of semi-structured interviews allows an in-depth exploration of participants' perspectives (Parahoo, 2006) . Participants were invited to freely verbalize their experiences and perceptions regarding their professional duties during the HSI pandemic. Field notes ( Fig. 2) were recorded during and after the interviews about significant observations from informants' physical expressions and gestures to enhance exploration of the participants' verbal and non-verbal information (Robson, 2002) . A tape recorder was also used to audiotape the interviews to help the researcher obtain accurate conversational data with complete wordings from informants (Polit and Beck, 2008) . Flowchart of recruitment and data collection procedure is shown in Fig. 3 .
