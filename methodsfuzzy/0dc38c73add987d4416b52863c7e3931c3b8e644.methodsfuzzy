Pigs. Piglets from eight litters of York breed were used in this study. They were left with the sow until age 17 to 20 days when they were placed in holding pens and fed canned whole evaporated cow's milk (Farmer's Wife Brand, Cow & Gate Ltd., Brockville, Ontario, Canada). Virus. The Purdue strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus was used. It had been pig passaged six times, and the inoculum was prepared as described, r Experimental plan. We used a total of 49 piglets. Of these, 31 were inoculated orally with transmissible gastroenteritis virus at 23 to 26 days of age. Control piglets were matched-fed litter mates (each fed the mean volume of the intake of the infected pigs in their own litter). Piglets were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups: acute, convalescent, or recovered. Piglets were killed by electrocution as follows: acute, 42 hours post inoculation; convalescent, 1 week post inoculation; and recovered, 2 weeks post inoculation. During the 24 hour period before the pigs were killed we collected stool and urine from male pigs in each litter using metabolic cages constructed of Plexiglas, which we could adjust to the size of the piglet. We sampled blood from the anterior vena cava immediately prior to killing the pigs. Piglets did not receive intravenous therapy. Of the total number of pigs inoculated, five died and two failed to develop symptoms of the disease. Tissue preparation for enzymes. We elec= trocuted the pigs and immediately dissected out the entire gastrointestinal tract and placed it on ice. Sections of gut 20 cm. in length were removed from proximal jejunum (beginning 6 cm. below the pylorus), midjejunum (midpoint of small intestine), distal ileum (20 crn. proximal to cecum), proximal colon (beginning 10 cm. below cecum), and distal colon (ending 20 cm. proximal to the anus). A 1 cm. piece from both ends of each section was taken for histologic study. The remainder was flushed with iced saline, slit open, and the mueosa was scraped off with a glass slide and homog6nized (100 rag. per milliliter of 2.5 mM. EDTA adjusted to pH 7.5 with TRIS) in a power-driven tissue grinder (Arthur Thomas Company, Philadelphia, Pa.) for 20 strokes at 1,500 r.p.m. This homogenate was aliquoted into five vials and, after quick freezing in acetone and Dry Ice, was stored at -30 ~ C. until enzyme activity was determined. We used a new vial for each assay, no vial was frozen more than once. Preparation of tissue for hlstologie study. Tissues for light microscopy were stapled onto paraffin blocks for identification, fixed in Suza's fixative for 24 hours, and then transferred to 95 per cent aIcohol and processed routinely for staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Each section was examined by one investigator who did not know whether it was from a control or infected pig. Villous height and crypt depth were measured with a standard micrometer eyepiece, previously calibrated, and epithelial cell damage and round cell infiltration of the lamina propria were rated. Enzyme assays. We designed an assay for Na-K-ATPase based on its biochemical characteristics in whole homogenates of intestinal mucosa from normal pigs. Thawed homogenates were rehomogenized with an equal volume of 0.1 per cent sodium deoxycholate in 2.5 raM. of EDTA and 20 >1 of this preparation was added to a total volume of 1.0 ml. of either an incubation medium made up of 5 mlVf. of MgATP (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.), 120 mM. of NaC1, and 20 mlVI. of KC1 in 50 mM. of TRIS buffer, or a second medium containing in addition 0.2 raM. of ouabain (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.). The pH of both solutions was 7.2 at 37 ~ C. We performed reactions in' duplicate in both solutions at 37 ~ C. stopping them after 15 minutes by plunging the tubes into an ice-water bath and adding 0.5 ml. of cold 8 per cent perchloric acid. Tubes were kept on ice until inorganic phosphate was measured in a Technicon autoanalyzer by the method of Gomori) Since ouabain selectively' inhibits the ATPase activity stimulated by sodium and potassium, the difference in inorganic phosphate produced without Volume 80 Transmissible gastroenteritis 9 2 7 Number 6 and with ouabain represents Na-K-ATPase activity and was expressed as micromoles of pi produced per hour, per milligram of protein as determined by the method of Lowry and associates ~~ modified by Eggstein arid Kreutz ~ using bovine albumin as standard. Mg-ATPase was determined from pi liberated from the medium containing ouabain and was expressed similarly. Sucrase and lactase were measured by the method of Dahlqvist ~2 at a substrate concentration of 0.11 mM. and alkaline phosphatase by the method of Kelly and Hamilton. 13 Disaccharidase units were micromoles of glucose produced per minute; alkaline phosphatase units were millimoles of p-nitrophenol produced per hour. Statistical analyses were based on distribution of enzyme activity following a lognormal skew. All data were converted to logarithms before analyses. The mean was plotted as the antilogarithm and scatter expressed as the antilogarithm of one standard error above and below the mean. Stool determinations. Stools were homogenized in a Sorvall "OmniMixer" (Ivan Sorvall, Inc., Norwalk, Conn.), using a minimum volume of deionized water. To determine chloride a 1 Gin. aliquot was mixed in a total volume of 4 inl. of chilled 10 per cent nitric acid. After incubating the mixture for 10 minutes at room temperature, the supernate from a 10 minute low-speed centrifugation was analyzed? 4 Recover ranged from 89 to 92 per cent. For sodium and potassium determinations stool homogenates were wet ashed by incubating 1 Gm. of homogenate in 10 ml. of concentrated nitric acid overnight in a 100 ml. evaporating dish; the contents were then boiled gently with several aliquots of concentrated nitric acid and finally with 10 ml. of deionized water, always with a small volume (about 4 ml.) of liquid remaining in the dish. This mixture and rinsings from the dish were made up to a volume of 10 ml. in a volumetric flask. A flame spectrophotometer was used to determine sodium and potassium on diluted aliquots of the supernate from a 10 minute centrifugation at low speed. Ninety-two to 100 per cent of sodium and 93 to 104 per cent of potassium was recovered. The pH was determined on fresh stool using pH paper. The stool was hydrolyzed by boiling for one minute with 1.0N HCI and neutralized; it was then assayed for reducing substances? ~ Serum determinations. Standard methods were used for the following determinations: pH, 18 venous carbon dioxide tension, 17 magnesium, ~s calcium, ~9 chloride, 1~ and total proteins. 2~ Serum sodium and potassium were determined using a flame spectrophotometer, protein by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate , and osmolality by freezing-point depression.
