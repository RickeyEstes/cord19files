This was a prospective study at the Royal Melbourne Hospital (RMH, Parkville, Australia) comparing clinical, hospital and laboratory parameters for 6 weeks before (2 July-30 August 2016) and after (21 September-20 October 2016) implementation of the Biofire FilmArray Respiratory Panel (Biomerieux, France) for diagnosis of respiratory pathogens. The Biofire FilmArray Respiratory panel is a cartridge-based multiplex molecular assay capable of detecting 20 targets including influenza A (H1, H1-2009 and H3 strains), influenza B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4, adenovirus, coronavirus (HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43), human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumonia and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. There have been several studies demonstrating high clinical and analytical sensitivity and specificity compared to standard diagnostic testing algorithms. 1, 15 Prior to the introduction of the FilmArray panel, a National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) approved in-house real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detecting influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus was in routine use for detection of respiratory viruses. Primers and probes for influenza A were supplied by Biosearch Technologies (USA). RNA was extracted using a commercial kit (EZ1 Advanced XL BioRobot; Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and run on the ABI7500 (Applied Biosystems, USA). Up to eight samples can be processed in a single run. Following implementation of the FilmArray, both assays were run on each sample in order to facilitate a direct comparison between the assays for verification purposes. RMH is a 350-bed major tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Australia, with a busy (>60,000 admissions/year) Emergency Department (ED) serving the Melbourne metropolitan area. The microbiology laboratory predominantly serves RMH (approximately 80% of workload) and operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. After hours, there is only one scientist available in the laboratory and work is prioritised according to clinical urgency. For this study, nasopharyngeal swabs were tested from patients admitted to RMH for <48 h with a request for 'respiratory PCR'. Patients from the Haematology, Bone Marrow Transplant and Medical Oncology units were excluded as they are often treated via febrile neutropenia guidelines and other protocols, which are likely to affect hospital stay. Clinical and demographic data were recorded on a standardised case report form (CRF), including admission and discharge date and time, use of respiratory isolation rooms, time of specimen receipt in laboratory, processing start and finish time, time of result release and time that the respiratory PCR results were viewed by a clinician in the hospital's electronic pathology record. A time and motion study was done to record hands-on laboratory work time, with timing of each step of both assays recorded on a standardised CRF. For the time and motion study, laboratory staff members used a timer or stopwatch to record the time in minutes and seconds for each step. For the in-house PCR this included recording the total time for accession, setting up specimens for extraction, preparing samples for amplification, reading and reporting results. Since the in-house PCR assay was batched, the total time for each individual specimen in the study was calculated by dividing the overall time for the entire batch by the number of samples in the batch. For the FilmArray assay, the time taken for accession and set up and loading of the test and reporting of results was recorded individually for each specimen. In the pre-implementation phase, nasopharyngeal specimens were batched for accession, extraction and amplification stages, which were all performed by dedicated molecular scientists. The in-house assay was run once per weekday with the results released in the late afternoon. In the postimplementation phase, the specimen was split with the in-house PCR assay performed as above and the FilmArray processed as soon as practicable (24 h per day by any available microbiologist). All results from both preimplementation and post-implementation periods were reported directly to the hospital's electronic pathology record and notified to the hospital's Infection Prevention team by fax and pager within 15 min. Discrepant results from the two assays were sent for testing at an external laboratory. Outcome measures including laboratory TAT (time from arrival of specimen in the laboratory to release of electronic result to clinician), staff handson time, time to result being checked by treating clinician, hospital LOS and isolation bed LOS were calculated and were compared between the preimplementation and post-implementation groups. The study was powered to detect a difference in laboratory TAT of at least 7 h and differences in hospital LOS and isolation bed LOS of at least 10 h with 80% power and 95% confidence based on previous estimates of these parameters. Due to the non-parametric distribution of the continuous outcome measures collected, median values were calculated and Wilcoxon-rank sum tests used to determine clinically significant differences. For categorical variables, chi-squared tests were used. Visual tests for linearity were performed with removal of data outliers before running univariate linear regression models for factors predicting both hospital LOS and isolation bed LOS. All factors with p < 0.2 along with clinically relevant factors determined a priori were incorporated into a final multivariate model. All statistical calculations were done in STATA 12 (Statacorp, USA). The study was approved by the RMH Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC approval number 2016.011).
