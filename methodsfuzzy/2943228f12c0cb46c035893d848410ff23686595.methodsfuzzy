Virus construction. Recombinant DENV1 West Pac '74 infectious clone (rDENV1ic) was constructed using a four-cDNA cloning strategy as previously described (19, 32, 38) . Briefly, the DENV1 genome was divided into four fragments and subcloned into separate cDNA plasmids with unique type IIS restriction endonuclease cleavage sites at the 5= and 3= ends of each fragment. A PflMI site was removed using standard molecular techniques. A T7 promoter was introduced into the 5= end of the plasmid A fragment, and plasmid DNA was grown in Escherichia coli cells. Purified plasmid DNA was enzyme digested, purified, and ligated together with T4 DNA ligase. Infectious genome-length capped viral RNA transcripts were generated with T7 polymerase. RNA was electroporated into C6/36 cells and incubated 4 to 6 days. Cell culture supernatant containing virus was harvested, centrifuged at maximum speed to remove cellular debris, and passaged onto C6/36 cells to generate a passage one virus stock. rDENV1ic-EDI mutant construction. For mutant virus generation, 12 predicted contact residues of 5H2 (24, 25) were identified that differ between DENV1 and DENV4 (Table 1 ). rDENV1ic plasmid A fragment was redesigned to encode these 12-amino-acid changes in the envelope protein to create rDENV1ic-EDI. The new plasmid A was digested and ligated with WT rDENV1ic plasmids B, C, and D as described above to generate the rDENV1ic-EDI mutant virus. Cells. Cells were cultured as previously described by our group (19, 32) . C6/36 cells were grown in Gibco minimal essential medium (MEM) at 32°C. DC-SIGN-expressing U937 cells (U937ϩDC-SIGN) were maintained in RPMI 1640 at 37°C. Media were supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) (5% for C6/36 and U937ϩDC-SIGN cells) which was lowered to 2% after infection. C6/36 and U937ϩDC-SIGN media were supplemented with nonessential amino acids, and U937ϩDC-SIGN medium were also supplemented with L-glutamine and 2-mercaptoethanol. All media were additionally supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 g/ml amphotericin B. All cells were incubated in 5% CO 2 . Virus titration and immunostaining. Cell culture plates (24-well plates) were seeded with C6/36 cells to be confluent at the time of infection. The cell growth media were removed, and virus stocks were serially diluted 10-fold and then added to cells for 1 h at 32°C (C6/36) with gentle rocking. After incubation, cells were overlaid with 1% methylcellulose in Opti-MEM I (Gibco) supplemented with 2% FBS, nonessential amino acids, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 g/ml amphotericin B and incubated at 32°C. After 4 to 6 days of incubation, the overlay was removed, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 80% methanol. The cells were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS (blocking buffer) and then incubated for 1 h at 37°C with anti-prM MAb 2H2 and anti-E MAbs 4G2 and DV1-E103 diluted in blocking buffer. The cells were washed two times with PBS and then incubated for 1 h at 37°C with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) diluted in blocking buffer. The plates were washed two times with PBS, and foci were developed using TrueBlue HRP substrate (KPL). Infectious center assay. C6/36 cells electroporated with rDENV1ic RNA were diluted in Opti-MEM I (Gibco), added to a confluent monolayer of C6/36 cells, overlaid with 1% methylcellulose, and incubated for 4 days. After incubation, cells were fixed and stained as described above. The percentage of electroporated cells capable of making viable infectious virus was calculated as follows: (number of foci/number of electroporated cells plated) ϫ 100. Growth curves. To determine the amount of virus cells can produce, C6/36 cells were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Every 24 h, all cell culture supernatant was harvested (volume was replaced with fresh medium) and frozen at Ϫ80°C. The titers of the virus samples were determined as described above. To determine the kinetics at which cells become infected, C6/36 cells were inoculated at an MOI of 0.01. Every 12 h, cell culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS, fixed, permeabilized, and probed with anti-prM MAb 2H2 conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488. Infected cells were quantified using a Guava flow cytometer (Millipore). U937ϩDC-SIGN cells were infected at an initial infection of 2%, and every 12 h, a sample of cells were harvested, fixed, and stained as described for C6/36 cells. Binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The plates were coated with either 100 ng/well each mouse MAb 4G2 and 2H2 or 200 ng/well human MAb 1C19 overnight at 4°C. The plates were washed with Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween (TBST) and blocked in 3% nonfat dried milk in TBST (blocking buffer), and equal quantities of virus (as previously titrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) were added and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The plates were washed, and primary human MAbs were diluted fourfold in blocking buffer and added to the plates for 1 h. The plates were washed, and alkaline phosphate (AP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were added for 1 h at 37°C. The plates were washed and developed using p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate, and color changes were quantified by spectrophotometry as previously described (19, 32) . Neutralization assays. For the focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT), 24-well cell culture plates were seeded with C6/36 cells to be confluent at time of infection. MAbs were diluted fourfold, mixed with 45 focus-forming units (FFU) of virus, and incubated for 1 h at 32°C. After incubation, the virus-MAb mixture was added to C6/36 cells for 1 h at 32°C with gentle rocking. The overlay was added, and the cells were incubated for 4 to 6 days. The cells were fixed and stained as described above. For the flow-based neutralization assay, MAbs were diluted fourfold, mixed with virus (previously titrated to equal~15% infection with no MAb present), and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After incubation, the virus-MAb mixture was added to 5 ϫ 10 4 U937ϩDC-SIGN cells for 2 h at 37°C. The cells were then pelleted, washed two times with fresh medium, and then incubated for 24 h. After incubation, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained as described above for U937ϩDC-SIGN growth curves. Accession number(s). Wild-type DENV1 and DENV4 sequences were derived from GenBank accession numbers U88535. 1
