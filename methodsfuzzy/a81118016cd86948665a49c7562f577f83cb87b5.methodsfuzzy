Test methods and experimental design have been previously described (Buhr et al. 2012b ) and are summarized here. Test methods were developed to contain spores or spore-inoculated substrates within filter-capped 50 ml conical tubes. The 0.2 μM filters permitted hot, humid air to pass through the filter cap and the filter containing spores. This method was critical for proof-of-principle testing with virulent B. anthracis Ames spores since a fan circulated hot, humid air during testing. This method also permitted spore extraction in the test tube without extra handling steps of the spore-inoculated substrate. For each test run, spores (≥7 logs of spores) from each of ten independent spore preparations (five spore preparations for B. anthracis ΔSterne spores and another five spore preparations for B. thuringiensis Al Hakam) were inoculated on the test substrates and the control substrates. Spore survival was quantified for 70 tests and 70 room temperature controls for each test run with a total of 19 independent test runs. For each test run, there were ten substrates for each of the six materials plus the wet control (7 total) for test samples, and the six materials plus the wet control (7 total) for the room temperature control samples. There were a total of 1,330 independent tests and 1,330 independent room temperature controls for the entire study. Response surface methodology is a statistical procedure used to understand, improve, and optimize a process. The objective is to model a response variable in terms of one or more independent predictor variables. Second order polynomial models (Equation 1) are most commonly used in RSM because they are flexible in describing data in which there is curvature. They also make for straightforward locating of optima. RSM is typically used sequentially. An experiment is first done to screen potential predictor variables. If it is determined that the current settings of the predictors are near an optimum, supplementary runs are done to fit a second order model. If the experimental region is not near an optimum, the method of steepest ascent can be used to find the optimum or arrive at a region of operability should an optimum be unattainable. In other situations, the region of operability is the entire experimental region. Such was the case for this study. The experiment used in this situation was the face-centered cube design (FCD) (Myers and Montgomery 2002) . The final design in terms of coded and original predictor variables is given in Table 1 . As Table 1 shows, there were three predictors, temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and days (D). These were transformed to the coded variables, x 1 , x 2 , and x 3 in order to better determine the relative size of their effects. The codes were The measured response, p(x1, x2, x3), was the proportion of spores inactivated divided by the average number of spores tested. Since the response was a proportion, the proper link function is the logit (or log odds) (Agresti 1996 (Agresti , 2002 Hosmer and Lemeshow 2000) ; i.e., y ¼ log p 1−p Table 1 Face-centered cube design matrix with coded and original units where p is shorthand for p(x1, x2, x3) and log denotes the natural logarithm function. If a particular material had complete spore inactivation on one or two observations, p was conservatively imputed as the minimum detection level, 0:1 avg: no: spores tested , to bound the logit away from infinity. In some cases, however, too many coupons had complete inactivation and could not be modeled using Equation 1. An attempt to fit a second order model was made for each strain on each material. ANOVA tables for the sequential sum of squares were used to determine which group of terms contributed significantly to the models. The groups were first-order terms (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ), pure quadratic terms (x 2 1 , x 2 2 , x 2 3 ), and interaction terms (x 1 x 2 , x 1 x 3 , x 2 x 3 ). If a group of terms was deemed significant, all terms from that group were kept in the model (Lenth 2009 ). A blocking variable, b, was included in each model since the observations were gathered in two phases, one phase for the factorial and center points, the second phase for the face-centered points. Information concerning individual parameter estimates, standard error and statistical significance is provided in separate ANOVA tables. Each model was subjected to diagnostic measures consisting of the F-test for lack of fit, examination of raw residuals and jackknifed residuals vs. fitted values, and examination of normal plots based on both raw residuals and jackknifed residuals (Venables and Ripley 1999) . These diagnostics were crucial for outlier detection and in determining for which cases a model could not be fit. Analysis was performed using R along with the rsm package (Lenth 2009 ).
