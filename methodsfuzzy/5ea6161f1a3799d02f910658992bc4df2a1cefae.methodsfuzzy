The retrospective and cross-sectional study was performed at Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), the only tertiary and academic medical center in the State of Qatar. The study included infants and young children aged 0-24 months who were admitted to the pediatric ward with diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis during the period of January 2010 till December 2012. The identification of the patient population was obtained from an advanced search in the HMC medical records database. The search comprised diagnosis of bronchiolitis (primary diagnosis) in patients 24 months of age and under. The diagnosis of bronchiolitis was based on the definition suggested by the American Academy of Pediatrics, subcommittee on diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis. 1 Our young patients met the criteria of bronchiolitis as documented in the patients' files. We excluded children who did not have virology testing from their nasopharyngeal secretions, and those whose primary diagnosis was a disease other than bronchiolitis. Approval for the study was obtained from the HMC Ethics Committee (Ref # 13139/13). The committee waived the need to obtain informed consent for retrospective studies, and so only deidentified information was collected. The following details were collected: gestational age, gender, respiratory virus real-time polymerase chain reaction (RVRT-PCR) conducted on nasopharyngeal secretions, and hospital length of stay (LOS). The laboratory in our institution performs an identification panel for every requested nasopharyngeal secretion sample for the following organisms: pandemic influenza A H1N1, influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1-4, coronavirus, novel coronavirus, rhinovirus, bocavirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus. For the aim of data analysis, we divided the patient population into three groups: group A, which comprised children hospitalized with clinical bronchiolitis and RVRT-PCR was positive for RSV; group B comprised children hospitalized with clinical bronchiolitis caused by an unidentified agent where RVRT-PCR was negative; and group C contained children hospitalized with clinical bronchiolitis due to a respiratory virus other than RSV such as rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza 1-3, coronavirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, etc.
