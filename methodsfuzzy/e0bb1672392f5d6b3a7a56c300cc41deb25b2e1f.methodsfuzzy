The study was conducted from September 2013 to February 2015. Thirty zoological parks were contacted through a partnership with two French animal histopathology laboratories (ONIRIS in Nantes, VetDiagnostic in Lyon) and the French Association of Zoological Park Veterinarians (AFVPZ). Data collection consisted of (1) consultation of veterinarian archives in the zoological parks and (2) analysis of centralized data by veterinarian histopathology laboratories. As accurate cancer diagnosis relies on histopathological examination of samples from biopsies, resection, or autopsy/necropsy (Martineau et al., 2002) , we therefore only entered tumor type (benign or malignant) into our database when they had been confirmed by histological analyses. We also recorded the organs affected, and, if any, the presence and the location of metastases. In order to facilitate data presentation, we classified the tumors into 12 anatomical systems.
