Data were first summarized as descriptive statistics, such as medians and percentages. To understand variability of the networks (the 35 randomly selected shifts), network characteristics were summarized and the distribution of these summary statistics reported. We typically report median values as they are robust to extreme values. In doing so we use the language of "on average" in the sense of a typical value (Stevenson, 2010) rather than the arithmetic mean. To evaluate whether temporal and environmental characteristics were associated with node-and network-level metrics, a series of multivariable models were analyzed. Models of node level outcomes used a mixed models approach to account for the clustering of observations within each shift using SAS's PROC MIXED (SI Inc., 2008a) or PROC GLIMMIX (SI Inc., 2008b) with a random statement for shifts. Most staff members had observations in multiple shifts, another source of clustering, but addition of this random effect was found to be unnecessary to the models. Normal linear regression was used except for the following dependent variables: for number of weak components, Poisson regression was used; for indicators of radius >2 or not and diameter >5 or not, logistic regression was used. Regression diagnostic techniques confirmed linearity and lack of multicollinearity. Problematic residual distributions led to the use of bootstrapping (Carroll and Ruppert, 1988) to quantify sampling error, with 95% confidence intervals calculated utilizing 1000 bootstrapped estimates (based on bootstrapped samples of shifts). Before bootstrapping we screened for inclusion of 2-way interaction terms as appropriate: patient arrival mode with patient acuity, ED crowding during individual observation period, and chief complaint; patient acuity with percent population with high acuity, ED crowding during individual observation period, chief complaint, and day/night; day/night with percent population with high acuity and ED crowding during individual observation period; and patient age with chief complaint. Criterion for including interaction terms in a final model was alpha = 0.001. Node-level outcomes degree, weighted degree, and relative degree were modeled for four subsets determined by type of contact edge and participant type (patient or staff): (1) patient with other patient (PP), (2) among patients only, patient with staff person (PS), (3) among staff only, a staff person with a patient (SP), and (4) staff person with another staff person (SS). This permitted some clarity about the quite different contact experiences of these subsets. It allowed patient characteristics to be examined as predictors in patient-centered models, and staff member's role (provider, nurse, other) to be included in staff-centered models, in addition to the temporal and environmental characteristics and control variables included in all models. For the PP outcomes the models took the following form: X kij for i = 1,. . .n j , j = 1, . . ., 35, where m ij is one of the three measures considered (degree, weighted degree, relative degree) for patient i in shift j; n j is the number of patients observed in shift j; X 1ij = age of patient i in shift j; X 2ij = 1 if subject i in shift j is female, 0 otherwise; X 3ij = 1 if patient i in shift j is non-black, 0 otherwise; X 4ij = 1 if patient i in shift j arrived by emergency medical services (EMS) ambulance; X 5ij = patient census if patient i in shift j arrived by EMS, 0 otherwise; X 6ij = 1 if patient i in shift j had acuity of stable or non-urgent, 0 otherwise; X 7ij = 1 if patient i in shift j had acuity of urgent, 0 otherwise; X 8ij = 1 if patient i in shift j had gastrointestinal (GI) chief complaint, 0 otherwise; X 9ij = 1 if patient i in shift j had respiratory chief complaint, 0 otherwise; X 10ij = 1 if patient i in shift j had neurological chief complaint, 0 otherwise; X 11ij = 1 if patient i in shift j had chest pain chief complaint, 0 otherwise; X 12ij = 1 if patient i in shift j had other chief complaint, 0 otherwise; X 13ij = 1 if the visit for patient i started before and ended during shift j, 0 otherwise; X 14ij = 1 if the visit for patient i started during and ended after shift j; X 15ij = 1 if the visit for patient i started before and ended shift j; X 16ij = 1 if shift j was a day shift (7 am-7 pm), 0 otherwise; X 17ij = 1 if shift j was a weekend shift, 0 otherwise; X 18ij = 1 if shift j occurred in July, August, or September of 2009, and 0 if it occurred in October-December of 2009; X 19ij = maximum census of the ED during shift j; X 20ij = median age (years) of patients seen during shift j; X 21ij = percent of patients seen during shift j that were female; X 22ij = percent of patients seen during shift j that arrived by EMS; X 23ij = percent of patients seen during shift j with urgent acuity class; X 24ij = percent of patients seen during shift j that had respiratory chief complaint; X 25ij = percent of patients seen during shift j that had musculoskeletal chief complaint; X 26ij = length of shift j (hours); X 27ij = duration of observation; and X 28ij = number of patients in the ED during shift j. For the PS outcomes the models took the following form: X kij for i = 1,. . .n j , j = 1, . . ., 35, where m ij is one of the three measures considered (degree, weighted degree, relative degree) for patient i in shift j; n j is the number of patients observed in shift j; X 1ij , . . ., X 28ij are as defined above, and X 29ij = number of staff working in the ED during shift j. For the SP outcomes the model took the following form: where m ij is one of the three measures considered (degree, weighted degree, relative degree) for staff i in shift j; n j is the number of staff observed in shift j; Z 1ij = 1 if staff i in shift j is a provider, 0 otherwise; Z 2ij = 1 if staff i in shift j is a nurse, 0 otherwise; Z 3ij = the census for shift j if staff i is a provider; Z 4ij = the census for shift j if staff i is a nurse; Z 5ij = 1 if shift j is a day shift, 0 otherwise; Z 6ij = 1 if shift j is a weekend shift, 0 otherwise; Z 7ij = 1 if shift j occurred in July-September of 2009, 0 if it occurred during October-December of 2009; Z 8ij = maximum census of the ED during shift j; Z 9ij = median age (years) of patients seen during shift j; Z 10ij = percent of patients seen during shift j that were female; Z 11ij = percent of patients seen during shift j that arrived by EMS; Z 12ij = percent of patients seen during shift j with urgent acuity class; Z 13ij = percent of patients seen during shift j that had respiratory chief complaint; Z 14ij = percent of patients seen during shift j that had musculoskeletal chief complaint; Z 15ij = length of shift j (hours); Z 16ij = duration observed; Z 17ij = number of staff working in the ED during shift j; Z 18ij = number of patients in the ED during shift j. For the SS outcomes the model took the following form: Z kij for i = 1,. . .n j , j = 1, . . ., 35, where m ij is one of the three measures considered (degree, weighted degree, relative degree) for staff i in shift j; n j is the number of staff observed in shift j; Z 1ij . . ., Z 18ij are as defined above; the two interaction terms were not significant and the number of patients was not relevant. For eigenvector and closeness centrality measures, the models took the form where m ij is one of the two measures considered for participant i in shift j; n j is the number of participants observed in shift j; U 1ij = 1 if participant i in shift j is a provider, 0 otherwise; U 2ij = 1 if participant i in shift j is a nurse, 0 otherwise; U 3ij = 1 if participant i in shift j is administrative staff, 0 otherwise; U 4ij = census maximum in shift j; U 5ij = census maximum if participant i in shift j is a provider, 0 otherwise; U 6ij = census maximum if participant i in shift j is a nurse; U 7ij = census maximum if participant i in shift j is administrative staff, 0 otherwise; U 8ij = 1 if shift j was a day shift (7 am to 7 pm), 0 otherwise; U 9ij = 1 if shift j was a weekend shift, 0 otherwise; U 10ij = 1 if shift j was occurred in July, August, or September of 2009, and 0 if it occurred in October-December of 2009; U 11ij = median age (years) of all patients seen during shift j; U 12ij = percent of patients seen during shift j that were female; U 13ij = percent of patients seen during shift j that arrived by EMS; U 14ij = percent of patients seen during shift j with urgent acuity class; U 15ij = percent of patients seen during shift j that had respiratory chief complaint; U 16ij = percent of patients seen during shift j that had musculoskeletal chief complaint; U 17ij = length of shift j (hours); U 18ij = duration of observation (hours); U 19ij = number of staff working in the ED during shift j; U 20ij = number of patients in the ED during shift j. For the network-level outcomes, separate models for each temporal and environmental predictor were run, with shift length and network size included as control variables. Since there were only 35 network-level observations, we did not perform extensive multivariable analysis beyond these models. Regression diagnostics confirmed linearity, residual assumptions, and lack of multicollinearity. For these measures the models took the form Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for participant, temporal, and environmental characteristics. There were, on average, 36 staff and 68 patient participants observed per shift. Staff were observed for 575 min per shift while patients were observed for 192 min. Although the goal was to measure 12-h shifts, at least 25% of shifts were observed for 11 or fewer hours. The majority (74%) of shifts were on weekdays, and 57% were day shifts. Shifts split fairly evenly between summer months (July-September) and autumn months (October-December), with 46% of shifts being measured in summer months. The median of shift-level environmental characteristics are as follows: median age of 44 years, 57% female, 29% arrived by EMS, 28% were of high acuity, 12% presented with respiratory syndrome, and 12% presented with musculoskeletal syndrome.
