Medical records of cats, with neurological signs localising to the spinal cord, referred to the Animal Health Trust (1999e2004), were reviewed retrospectively. Inclusion in this study required documentation of a complete neurological examination on presentation and an MRI series of the suspected affected area being available for reassessment. Data on signalment, speed of onset, duration and severity of clinical signs, presence of spinal pain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, corticosteroid administration prior to referral and patient outcome were recorded. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) status were also recorded where known. Speed of onset of clinical signs was defined as peracute (when clinical signs developed in less than 12 h), acute (12e48 h) or chronic (>48 h). Duration of clinical signs was recorded as the number of days between the start of clinical signs noted by the owner and the MRI investigation. For severity of clinical signs, a neurological score was developed using a six-point scale ( Table 1 ). The results of the CSF analysis were recorded as normal or abnormal when increased protein concentration alone (albuminocytological dissociation) or pleocytosis was noted, with the latter classified according to the actual cell count (Table 1) . A 1.5-T GE Signa scanner (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with a human extremity coil was used to image all the cats. Dorsal and sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and T1-weighted post-contrast (gadobenate dimeglumine 0.05 mmol/ kg) sequences were obtained; transverse images were obtained where considered appropriate by the operating radiologist. A board-certified veterinary radiologist reviewed all the images, recording the following MRI characteristics: spinal cord segment(s) affected, lesion characteristics, effects of the lesion on the cord and presence of osteolysis. The lesions identified on MRI were described according to their location relative to the spine and spinal cord parenchyma (paraspinal, extradural, intradural extramedullary or intramedullary) and to its effects on the spinal cord (compression, swelling and MRI signal alteration). According to the MRI findings, the spinal cord was subdivided into five vertebral segments for neurolocalisation: C1eC5, C6eT2, T3eL3, L4eL6 and L7eS3. The MRI findings together with the history, clinical signs, neurological evaluation and results from other diagnostic tests (CSF analysis, radiography, serology, cytology, histopathology, electrodiagnostic studies, surgical findings and post-mortem examination), generated a presumptive diagnosis. In view of these diagnoses, each case was Logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between MRI findings and potential explanatory variables (age, gender, breed, duration of clinical signs, speed of onset of disease, severity of clinical signs, presence of spinal pain on presentation, cranial nerve involvement, CSF analysis, corticosteroid administration prior to referral and whether clinical signs progressed prior to MRI). Variables with P < 0.30 in the univariable analysis were considered for inclusion in multivariable logistic regression. Variables were selected for inclusion in the final model if they significantly improved the fit (likelihood ratio c 2 statistic P < 0.05). Cross-tabulation and a Fisher's exact test were used to examine the association between presence of osteolysis on MRI and the diagnosis of neoplastic disease. Results of logistic regression and cross-tabulation are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). KaplaneMeier survival analysis was performed to estimate median survival time (MST) with 95% CIs. Survival was determined from the date of diagnosis to the censor date of 15 November 2006. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to evaluate the effects of potential explanatory variables on survival. Variables with P < 0.30 in the univariable analysis were considered for inclusion in multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Variables were selected for inclusion in the final model if they significantly improved the fit (likelihood ratio c 2 statistic P < 0.05). Results are presented as hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs. Significance was set at P < 0.05 for all final models. The proportionality assumption was checked for the Cox model and the residuals were examined as an assessment of the fit of the final models to the data.
