All animal procedures performed in this study were conducted under experimental licence from the health products regulation authority (HPRA), Dublin, Ireland (individual authorisation number, AE 19132/I073; project licence number, AE 19132/P006) and the United Kingdom (UK) Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Dairy calves were sourced from the Agri-Food and Bioscience Institute (AFBI) research dairy farm in Hillsborough, located in Co. Down, Northern Ireland (latitude 52°27′, longitude 6°4′) and beef calves were sourced from the beef suckler herd, at Teagasc Grange, located in Co. Meath, Ireland (latitude 53.52187, longitude −6.65247). Animal model. The animal model was designed to fully elucidate the development of immunocompetence in i) Holstein dairy calves (artificially fed colostrum at a level of 5% total body weight (BW) at birth) and ii), beef suckler calves, which were the progenies of Limousin × Friesian and Charolais × Limousin cows. The cows were bred using Aberdeen Angus (AA) and Charolais (CH) sires (natural mating) (LF calf progenies 3 AA and 4 CH; CL calf progenies 3 AA and 4 CH). The birth of each dairy calf was vigilantly observed and calves were separated from their dam approximately 15 to 20 min post-birth to prevent suckling occurring. Calves were weighed and placed in a straw-bedded pen where they were blood sampled and received their first feed of colostrum, fresh from their own dam, (at a concentration of 5% total body weight (BW)) via oesophageal tube within 2.5 h post birth. 12 h later, calves were fed 5% body weight, second milk colostrum, via a teat feeder. Calves were fed 12.5% of their BW of colostrum from their own dam for the first 4 days of life. Calves were weighed at birth and 70 d using a calibrated weigh scale (Tru-Test Eziweigh 5, Auckland, New Zealand). Calves were individually penned for the first 4 days of life, and on day 5 were placed in a group pen where they were fed a skim based calf milk replacer (protein and oil content of 23% Table 1 ) and offered ad libitum concentrate and clean water from an automatic milk feeder (Forster Technik vario, Germany). Once calves were introduced to the automatic feeder on d 5, their weights were recorded on a daily basis using an automated weigh scale until d 63 (Forster Technique, body scale, Germany). Two beef cow breeds were included: Limousin × Friesian (LF) (n = 7) and Charolais × Limousin (CL) (n = 7). Mean parity (SD) for LF and CL beef suckler cows was 5.5 (0.94) and 5.3 (1.03), respectively. The mean calving date was 28 th February 2015 (26 th January to 27 th April). All calves involved in the study were single birth calves and had a mean calving difficulty score of 2.1, ranging from 1 (unobserved/ unassisted) to 3 (assisted with calving aid). Births were supervised by farm personnel to ensure that calves did not suckle the cow prior to implementing the experimental protocol for collection of the first blood sample from the calf. All calves were closely observed to ensure suckling of the dam and any calf not suckling within 1 h of birth or showing signs of weakness was assisted to suckle the cow. After parturition, beef calves remained with their dams and had free access to their dams for suckling until weaning after 7 months of age. Calf live weights were recorded at birth, and every four weeks thereafter throughout the experimental period. Mean (SD) calf birth weight was similar (P > 0.05) for the progeny of CL (46.4 (4.74) kg) and LF (46.6 (6.27) kg) cows. The live weight gain of calf progenies from LF cows was greater from birth to weaning (P < 0.05) compared to the calves from CL cows. Cow vaccinations. All beef and dairy cows were immunised against the inactivated antigen strain of BoHV-1 (gE-) with a primary vaccine and a secondary booster vaccine at day (d)-84 and d-56 relative to the expected calving date (d 0), with 2 ml (S/C) of a commercial vaccine, Bovilis IBR marker inactivated (MSD Animal Health, Buckinghamshire, UK). All cows received a combined rotavirus, coronavirus and E. coli F5 (K99) vaccine (inactivated) (Rotavec Corona) by intra-muscular injection between 4 and 12 weeks prior to calving date. Colostrum milk collection and sampling. One 50 mL sample of colostrum was taken at calving, prior to the initial feed. Samples were collected from the left quarter of the dams' udders. All quarters of the udder were cleaned before sample collection with dry paper towel, to avoid any debris entering the sample. Colostrum samples were analysed for total IgG. The 50 mL colostrum samples were centrifuged at 2000 × g at 7 °C for 10 minutes. Following centrifugation, the fat-layer was removed with a sterile spatula. The supernatant (fat-free) was frozen at −20 °C for IgG analysis 32-34 . Blood collection. Blood samples were collected from the calf via the jugular vein using an 8.5 ml BD vacutainer (SST tube) (BD, Oxford, UK), at 0, 48, 72, and 168 hour (h) post birth. All blood samples were stored at room temperature for a minimum of 1 h to allow clotting to occur. Samples were then centrifuged at 1764 g for 15 min, the serum was collected and subsequently stored at −20 °C for IgG analysis. Bloods for RNA extraction were collected via jugular venipuncture from all calves at 0 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 168 h post birth. The blood (3 mL) was collected using tempus blood RNA tubes (Life technologies, Paisley, Scotland). Immediately after blood collection, the tubes were shaken vigorously for 10 s, followed by storage at −80 °C until RNA isolation. Colostrum and serum IgG analysis. Colostrum (fat free) and serum (calf) samples were thawed at 4 °C overnight. IgG concentration was then determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for bovine IgG from Bio-X Diagnostics (Jemelle, Belgium) 32, 33 . All components of the kit were brought to room temperature (21 °C) before use. The wash buffer was diluted 20 fold with distilled water. A calibration curve was constructed and all samples were diluted at 1:225 in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), as per manufacturer's instructions. All samples (100 µl) were added to the test plate and tested in duplicate, along with standards using a 96-well dilution plate. Equal volumes of horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate was added to each well of the dilution plate and then 100 µL of this was transferred to the test plate. Each test plate was incubated at room temperature (21 °C) for 1 hour. The plate was washed three times using wash solution. Chromogen solution (tetramethylbenzidine) was added to each well (100 µl/well) and the plate was protected from light and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Stop solution was added to each well (50 µl/well) and the absorbance (optical densities) of the samples was read at a wavelength of 450 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Tecan Magellan, Männedorf, Switzerland). Negative controls were included on the test plate. An inter-assay CV of <0.15 was observed. These concentrations of IgG in the samples were averaged and then subtracted from the known concentrations of IgG in the reference standard absorbance values provided in the test kit. A standard curve was produced using the average values from duplicate standard wells. This curve illustrated the relationship between absorbance and IgG concentration. The coefficient of determination value for each assay had to exceed 0.9 on the standard curve for inclusion within these results [32] [33] [34] . RNA Isolation and Purification. RNA was isolated from whole blood collected from dairy and beef calves using the tempus spin RNA isolation reagent kit following manufacturer's guidelines (Applied Biosystems, USA). The quantity of the RNA isolated was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer ND-1000 (Nanodrop Technologies, DE, USA). RNA quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 using the RNA 6000 Nano Lab Chip kit (Agilent Technologies Ireland Ltd., Dublin, Ireland). RNA samples with 28S/18S ratios ranging from 1.8 to 2.0 and RNA integrity number (RIN) values of between 8 and 10 were deemed to be of high quality. RNA was stored at −80 °C until subsequent cDNA library preparation. cDNA library preparation and sequencing. cDNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA sample prep kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). For each sample, 0.7 μg of RNA was used for cDNA library preparation. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA and then fragmented. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems Ltd., Life Technologies) subsequently synthesising the second strand using components of the Illumina TruSeq RNA sample prep kit. Adaptors were ligated to the cDNA which was then enriched by PCR. Final individual cDNA libraries were validated on the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 using the DNA 1000 Nano Lab Chip kit (Agilent Technologies Ireland Ltd., Dublin, Ireland), ensuring that library fragment size was ~100 base pairs (bp) and library concentration was >30 ng/μl. Subsequently, individual RNAseq libraries were pooled based on their respective sample-specific-6 bp adaptors and sequenced at 100 bp/sequence single-end read using an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer (Macrogen Europe, The Netherlands). Approximately 38.4 million sequences per sample (Mean ± SD = 38,432,764 ± 7,169,473) were generated, with each calf representing an individual sample. RNAseq data analysis. Reads were quality-filtered and adapter-trimmed using cutadapt, trimming the first 13 bp standard Illumina adapter, retaining reads with minimum base quality 30, minimum read length 20. Quality assessment of the filtered data was performed by FastQC. Both cutadapt and FastQC were called using the wrapper script TrimGalore! Using this information, samples with fewer than 10 7 reads were rejected from further analysis. Reads were mapped against the UMD3.1 Bos taurus genome from Ensembl 87. Read alignment was performed using STAR. Gene level read-counts were quantified using STAR's '-quantMode GeneCounts' parameter. Analysis of the count data was performed using R's Bioconductor package DESeq2. Raw count data was supplied to DESeq2, with no prior normalisation/transformation steps applied, as per DESeq2 guidelines. A DESeq2 internal analysis pipeline (DESeq) was then applied to the raw data, which estimates size factors, dispersion, performs negative binomial GLM fitting and calculates Wald statistics. Separately, read counts were transformed using DESeq2's varianceStabilizingTransformation function for visualisation purposes. Hierarchical Clustering (HC) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) were used in initial, unsupervised analysis of the transformed data to provide information regarding trends and potential outliers. HC analysis was applied using average linkage and Pearson correlation as a distance metric. DESeq2 was used to perform differential expression analysis on the output of the DESeq pipeline. The Benjamini and Hochberg adjusted p-value threshold to denote statistical significance of changes in a given gene's expression levels was set to 0.05, with a fold change ±1.5 considered as a significantly altered level of transcript abundance. Genes above these requirement thresholds were referred to as differentially expressed genes (DEG) throughout.
