Since the existing standard bactericidal test methods (JIS R 1702 and ISO 27447) were specifically established for twodimensional photocatalytic surfaces, an appropriate bactericidal test method is needed for three-dimensional porous structures, such as TiO 2 /cordierite foam. The method should be based on three considerations: (1) in line with the standard methods, the initial concentration of the bacterial cells attached to the photocatalytic surface of the samples should be no less than 10 5 -10 6 CFU, which can trace 5-6 log units of decrease in bacterial cells; (2) the coated foam should be able to be used in air cleaner filters whose operational status is different from water treatment usage; (3) the obtained experimental data should be as reliable and stable as possible. Although these criteria can be satisfied easily with twodimensional flat samples, it is difficult to fulfill them in the case of the random three-dimensional porous structures seen in ceramic foams. For consideration (1), a very simple operation is used to flat samples in accordance with standard methods: pipette 100 l of the bacterial suspension (approximately 10 5 CFUs) onto the samples surface, and cover an adhesive film on the dripped suspension to spread it to attach the bacteria to the photocatalytic coating. However, this manner is impossible for porous foams. In order to ensure a high initial concentration of bacterial cells, we soaked the foam samples in the E. coli suspensions at a cell concentration of 10 7 CFU ml −1 for various periods of time. We then centrifuged the drenched foam to remove the residual bacterial suspensions filling the holes in the foam in order to ensure that the photocatalytic surface was accessible to the bacterial cells being tested. Here, we investigated the optimum conditions, including the soaking time for adsorption equilibrium, the centrifugation speed and the time required to obtain "semi-dry" ceramic foam loaded with a sufficient number of evenly absorbed bacterial cells. Fig. 4(A) shows that, when the centrifugation was performed for only 5 s at 3000 rpm, the number of bacterial cells loaded on the coated and bare foams did not meet the requirements of the standard methods. However, at 500 rpm, the residual bacterial suspensions filling the pores of the foam were completely removed; meanwhile, the number of adsorbed bacterial cells reached 10 5 CFU. Fig. 4(B) shows that when the centrifugation speed was set at 500 rpm, centrifugation times in the range of 5-60 s did not significantly affect the number of viable bacterial cells adsorbed. Foam samples soaked in E. coli suspensions for 20 min were used in this investigation to enable adequate bacterial attachment to the foam. We explain these data as follows: because the isoelectric point of TiO 2 is 6.1, its surface picks up tens of millivolts of negative charge when it is placed in deionized water at pH 7.0. This characteristic does not fundamentally change in a 1/500 NB solution which contains a small amount of organic matter and NaCl. In 1999, Janusz et al. reported a surface measurement of about −11 mV for TiO 2 in a very low-concentration NaCl solution [27] . Meanwhile, bacterial cells also have a negative surface potential in conditions with a pH value over 4. Therefore, it can be inferred that bacterial cells may not be strongly adsorbed onto a TiO 2 thin film covering a cordierite foam frame in a neutral pH environment without UV-A irradiation. The thus adsorbed bacteria actually consist of microorganisms contained in a physically adsorbed 1/500 NB aqueous film. We estimated that the amount of adsorbed E. coli on the surface of the "semi-dry" foam depends on the thickness of the liquid film covering the foam frame. This phenomenon is similar to the film formation achieved with the spin coating method described by Brinker et al. in 1990 [28] : that is, the thickness of the liquid film is determined mainly by centrifugation speed, centrifugation time and the viscosity of the liquid while the initial liquid amount remains constant. The description is defined with the following well-known equation: where "h" is the liquid thickness; "h 0 " is the initial liquid thickness (amount); " " is the density of liquid; "ω" is the revolution speed; "t" is time and "Á" is dynamic viscosity. However, when the liquid density and viscosity, as well as the centrifugation time are extremely small, such as a 1/500 NB solution and 60 s, the centrifugation speed plays a decisive role. Obviously, the complete removal of the residual bacterial suspensions filling the holes of the foam and the loading of a sufficient amount of bacterial cells with high reproducibility onto the foam frame are the most important points for the effectiveness of the antimicrobial testing by the methods developed here. The liquid film covering the foam frame is equivalent to the bacterial suspension layer on flat samples prepared in accordance with the standard methods (JIS R 1702 and ISO 27447). In order to obtain reproducible data, we established 500 rpm and 30 s as the optimum centrifugal conditions in all the formal bactericidal tests described in this paper. After the appropriate centrifugation conditions were established, the soaking time required to achieve adsorption equilibrium of E. coli suspensions onto the foam was examined in the range of 2-30 min. As shown in Fig. 4 (C), after only 2 min of soaking, the bacterial cells were rapidly adsorbed onto the coated and bare foam, and reached ∼2 × 10 5 CFU. Additionally, no obvious difference in the numbers of adsorbed E. coli cells was observed with soaking in the range of 2-30 min. The results revealed that TiO 2 /cordierite foam possesses a high hydrophilicity, leading to almost immediate adsorption equilibrium. The results also demonstrated that the number of adsorbed E. coli cells was dependent on the thickness of the liquid covering the coated foam frame as described above. To ensure the stability of E. coli adsorption, we set the optimum soaking time at 10 min for all of the bactericidal performance evaluations described below. Also, the washing time for collecting the bacterial cells adsorbed on the foam was examined in order to obtain stable and convincing experimental data. Because a PBS buffer with 0.7, w/v (%) of Tween-20 added was used as the washing solution, the collection rate of the adsorbed bacterial cells exceeded 90% after only 1 min of intense vortex. To stabilize the collection rate of E. coli, we set the optimum washing time at 2 min in all future bactericidal tests. In order to confirm the applicability of the coated foam for air cleaner filters, we examined its photocatalytic bactericidal effects by temporal evolution for viable bacterial cells during UV irradiation; this required the irradiation of the "semi-dry" foam under a blacklight blue lamp in an "air environment" as shown in Fig. 1 , and separate samples were taken at each sampling time point. To examine the temporal evolution precisely, the photocatalytic sam-ples must be as identical as possible to each other, and also the number of viable cells loaded onto the samples should be almost the same for all samples. All of the data presented here indicate that the method we developed can load a sufficient number of bacterial cells, with high reproducibility and only a ±10% margin of error, thus enabling an effective examination of the photocatalytic bactericidal effects of TiO 2 -coated cordierite foam. The remarkable difference between the standard methods and the newly developed method is the way of loading bacterial cells onto the TiO 2 coating. It is also a key point for obtaining accurate and reproducible experimental data. The high bactericidal activity of the TiO 2 /cordierite foam was confirmed for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, L. pneumophila, K. pneumoniae and MRSA, because these are the major pathogens associated with nosocomial infections. Fig. 5 shows the time-dependent decrease in the survival rate of the bacteria tested. With 0.25 mW cm −2 intensity of UV-A irradiation for 24 h, the bactericidal rate of the TiO 2 /cordierite foam exceeded 99.9% for all of the bacterial strains tested. No significant antibacterial effect was obtained when these bacterial strains were tested in the dark. Based on the above explanation of the adsorbed bacterial cells, the photocatalytic eradication of the bacterial cells contained in the liquid films covering the foam frame can be attributed to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by photocatalysis. While the water on the foam surface deriving from water vapor via physisorption in an air environment is estimated to be lower than in artificial liquid films, there is no doubt that the bactericidal action of the TiO 2 /cordierite foam can be mainly attributed to the reduction/oxidation of the adsorbed reactants directly by electrons/holes in the foam. It can be seen in Fig. 5 that the survival of each strain of bacteria tested declined slightly on bare cordierite foam under UV-A irradiation. As is well known, UV-A wavelengths are less effective in inducing DNA damage related to bacterial death, because they are not absorbed by native DNA; however, they can still produce secondary photoreactions with existing DNA photoproducts or damage DNA via indirect photosensitizing reactions. In fact, photons from UV-A radiation and visible light up to 670 nm are also able to generate singlet oxygen through type-II photosensitization reactions [29, 30] . However, this decrease in survival cannot be identified as efficacious bactericidal action by JIS or ISO standards. In addition, it also has been noted that damaged DNA can be repaired by some bacteria (e.g. E. coli) in both light and dark environments, by mechanisms commonly referred to as photoreactivation and dark repair [31] [32] [33] . Photocatalysis has been demonstrated to inhibit the repairs attributed to the loss of cell membrane integrity caused by the electrons/holes or by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the leakage of cell contents [12, 34] , highlighting the advantage of the application of TiO 2 /cordierite foam in air disinfection. Because the colony-forming method has a limitation in terms of detection, we immersed the foam loaded with E. coli cells and exposed to UV-A for 24 or 48 h in NB liquids in order to check whether or not bacteria adsorbed on the TiO 2 /cordierite foam could be completely killed by UV-A irradiation. We then incubated them at 37 • C for 24 h. During the incubation, we traced the OD (600) value to observe the growth of the surviving bacteria cells. According to the results shown in Table 1 , the adsorbed bacteria cells were completely inactivated after 48 h of UV-A irradiation, even though the foam was 10 mm thick. This phenomenon can be attributed to the random refraction of UV-A by the TiO 2 /cordierite foam. Fig. 6 shows the results of the bactericidal tests when the same sample was used three times. As is seen from the data, the bactericidal activity decreased slightly with the second and third use. However, this reduction was only observed with 4 or 8 h of UV-A illumination. After 24 h of UV-A illumination, the bactericidal rates were maintained at 99.99% for the second and third use. This indicates that the TiO 2 /cordierite foam possesses a long-term bactericidal action and reusability. In an aqueous phase, dead or damaged bacterial cells can be washed off the active photocatalytic surface. However, in an air-phase system, the dead cells may have the potential to accumulate and block the photoactive surface. Jacoby et al. observed the mineralization of E. coli cell masses on a TiO 2 surface in air with long-term (75 h) UV-A illumination [35] . Therefore, the long-term bactericidal action and reusability of TiO 2 coated foam are beneficial in reducing active surface blocking.
