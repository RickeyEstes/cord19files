The conceptual model, made up of concepts, is an abstraction of things in the real world. It can be used to facilitate the understanding of a complex system. Because of the elements (concepts and relations) of the conceptual model, this model can be easily switched to the OWL, which is constructed by classes and properties. Generally, the concept model can be constructed through two methodologies: induction and deduction. Induction means that the whole research process goes from the particular to the general theories. Namely, the conceptual model for planning system will be constructed through an observation of a series of plans from local to central governments, known as a "bottom-up" method. However, in fact the emergency planning system of China is not perfectly complete even now (Liu, 2011; Zhang, 2013) . Even some local plans are almost the same as their superior departments. In addition, some important information for emergency response cannot be found in some plans, leading to an inappropriateness study when the conceptual model is analyzed through induction. In contrast, deduction is a "up-bottom" method, which means the whole constructing starts from a basic premise. The premise leads to conclusions which will become new premises. So the process of deduction is linking premises with conclusions repeatedly. With this method, the conceptual model is suitable not only for China but for other countries. As such, the conceptual model will be constructed by the deduction. The result will be verified by factual contingency planning system of China. In the field of information and knowledge science, there are a The key features of Chinese planning system, which is from general to specific, can be revealed by our conceptual model. At the same time, administrative structures can be attached to this corresponding relations.
