Prediction of the heptad-repeat regions and construction of the TGEV fusion core. The porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) spiker gene used in this work was cloned from the Chinese isolate TH-98 (GenBank Accession No. AF494337). As shown in Fig. 1 , the TGEV S protein is a typical type I membrane protein. The HR1 and HR2 regions were predicted by using the computer software of LearnCoil-VMF, freely available from the website (http://night-ingale.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/ vmf) [19] . The predicted HR1 region covers amino acids 1045-1184, whereas the relevant HR2 includes the amino acids 1339-1378 ( Fig. 1) . Considering the feasibility of the soluble expression of the fusion core generated in this experiment, the HR1 and HR2 regions of TGEV were adequately truncated and extended, respectively, on the basis of the multiple alignment of TGEV with the other coronaviruses in the conserved regions. Finally, the TGEV fusion core (2-Helix construct) was made by linking the modified HR1 (1057-1119) and HR2 (1326-1383) with a flexible linker (SGGRGG, single amino acid abbreviation used here), and then was inserted directionally into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6P-1(Pharmacia) via the restriction sites BamHI and XhoI (introduced by PCR primers). The acquired recombinant expression plasmid, which harbored the interested DNA fragment of the TGEV fusion core was verified by direct DNA sequencing. Protein expression and purification. The candidate positive recombinant clones were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) competent cells and the single colony was inoculated into Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 50 mg/L ampicillin (Sigma, USA) at 37°C for overnight. Following, the overnight culture was transferred into the fresh LB medium for large-scale protein production at 37°C. When the culture density (OD 600 ) added up to 0.6-0.8, the culture was induced with 0.15 mM isopropyl-b-Dthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Sigma, USA) and grown for another $12 h at 16°C until the bacterial cells were harvested. The harvested culture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 12 min at 4°C, and the bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in the iced PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 1.8 mM KH 2 PO 4 ) and homogenized by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 18,600 rpm for 20 min at 4°C and subsequently filtered through 0.22 lm membrane for clarification. Then the supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Pharmacia). When the protein-loaded column was then washed with six times of column volume of PBS, the GST-fusion protein was eluted by 20 mM reduced glutathione (Pharmacia). To obtain the GST-removed protein, the GST-3C rhinovirus protease (kindly provided by Drs. J. Heath and K. Hudson) was added into the resin and then the mixture was incubated with gentle agitation for about 10 h at 4°C. The target protein was eluted with 10 ml PBS. Gel-filtration analysis. The target protein (2-Helix) loaded on a Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia) with an Akta Purifier System (Pharmacia) after it was concentrated by ultra-filtration (10 kDa cut-off) and exchanged from PBS buffer into the exclusion buffer. The fraction of the peak was collected and analyzed by a 17% SDS-PAGE, and the molecular weight of the interested peak was estimated by comparison with the GST protein run on the same gel. Circular dichroism spectroscopic analysis. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were performed on a Jasco J-715 spectrophotometer in PBS. Wavelength spectra were recorded at 25°C using a 0.1 cm path-length cuvette. Thermodynamic stability was measured at 222 nm by recording the CD signals at the temperature which varied from 25 to 90°C with a scan rate of 5°C/min. Chemical cross-linking of the fusion core. The purified 2-Helix protein after the gel-filtration was dialyzed against cross-linking buffer (50 mM Herpes, pH 8.3; 100 mM NaCl) and concentrated to approximately 5 mg/L by ultra-filtration (10 kDa cut-off). The resultant proteins were subjected to chemical cross-linking reaction with ethylene glycol bissuccinimidylsuccinate (EGS) (Pierce). The reactions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature at different concentrations of EGS, respectively (0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mM EGS), and quenched with 50 mM glycine. Eventually, the cross-linked samples were analyzed by 17% SDS-PAGE. 3D structural model building of the fusion core. The deduced amino acid sequence of the TGEV fusion core was sent into the CPHmodels 2.0 Server [23] and then was processed. Finally, the acquired coordinates were used to generate the 3D structure of the TGEV fusion core with the aid of the program of DeepView/SwissPdb-Viewer 3.7 (SPS).
