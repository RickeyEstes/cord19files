Between June 2015 and December 2016 all patients who attended Adnan Menderes University Hospital Child Emergency, Child Immunology and Allergic Diseases and General Pediatric Polyclinics with wheezing attacks, at the ages of 12---60 months with a history of three or more wheezing attacks in the last year were included. Patients with congenital structural anomalies in their lungs, cardiac and other systemic diseases, primary immun-odeficiency, growth retardation and neurological disorders causing coordination disorder were not included in the study. In the control group, 54 healthy children with similar age and gender who attended Child Health and Diseases Polyclinics whose families agreed to participate in the study were included. Sociodemographic information, environmental conditions, wheezing attack severity, treatments given during the wheezing attack of the patient group; sociodemographic information and environmental conditions of the control group were also recorded after signing the written consent form for the guardians of all participants. Physical examination of all cases was performed. The wheezing attack severity of the patient group was performed according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) criteria. 15 In both patient and control groups two milliliter blood samples were acquired for biochemical analysis. The spectrophotometric method was used for determinations of serum calcium (Ca), phosphor (P), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (ARCHITECT c8000, Abbott, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA). Serum 25(OH)D3 and parathormone (PTH) levels were analyzed with chemiluminescentmicroparticle immunoassay (CMIA) (ARCHITECT c8000, Abbott, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA). A serum 25(OH)D3 level of >20 ng/mL is indicative of vitamin D sufficiency, a level of 15---20 ng/mL as vitamin D insufficiency, a level of <15 ng/mL as vitamin D deficiency, and a level of ≤5 ng/mL as severe deficiency for children. 16 The detection of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal swab samples from patients was performed by FTD respiratory pathogens 21 kit (Fast-track Diagnostics Ltd., Malta) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each sample was simultaneously tested for human adenovirus (HAdV), influenza viruses A, B and H1N1 (FluA, FluB, H1N1), human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3 and HPIV-4), human respiratory sinsitial virus (HRSV A/B), human enterovirus (HEV) and rhinovirus (RV). The isolation of nucleic acid from nasopharyngeal swabs was performed using an EZ1 virus mini-kit V2.0 (Qiagen, Germany) in the Molecular Microbiology Laboratory. Fast-track Respiratory Pathogens 21 kit detects respiratory tract pathogens in the RotorGene Q platform (Qiagen ® , Germany). The thermal profile of multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) for the FTD kit was as follows: 15 min at 50 • C, 10 min at 95 • C and 40 cycles of 8 s at 95 • C and 34 s at 60 • C. The study was supported by Adnan Menderes University Faculty of Medicine ADUBAPTPF-14007 numbered project and approved by Non-interventional Clinical Research Ethics Committee (Protocol number: 2014/405). Written informed consent was obtained from all parents. The Kolmogorov---Smirnov test was used to assess the normality of numerical variables. For the numerical variables that were normally distributed, comparison between two groups was made by independent sample t test and descriptive statistics were presented as mean ± standard deviation. For the numerical variables that were not normally distributed, comparison between two groups was made by Mann---Whitney U test and descriptive statistics were presented as median (25---75 percentiles). To analyze the categorical data, a chi-square test was used and descriptive statistics were presented as frequency (%). The Spearman's rho correlation analysis was used to determine the correlation between the numerical variable. Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis was used for predicting risk factors for wheezing. The p values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
