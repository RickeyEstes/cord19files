Reagents and solvents were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Ind., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), and Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc. (Milwaukee, WI) and were used without further purification. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Merck Silica Gel 60F 254 pre-coated plates. Preparative HPLC was performed using a C18 reverse-phase column (19 Â 100 mm; Sun-Fire Prep C18 OBD™, 5 lm) with a binary solvent system: a linear gradient of CH 3 CN in 0.1% aqueous TFA at a flow rate of 6 mL/min, detected at UV 254 and 222 nm. All solvents used for HPLC were HPLC-grade. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or better. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were obtained using a JEOL 400 MHz spectrometer, a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer (300 MHz) or a BRU-KER AV600 spectrometer (600 MHz) with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. High-resolution mass spectra (ESI or EI) were recorded on a micromass Q-Tof Ultima API or a JEOL JMS-GCmate BU-20 spectrometer. Mass spectra (ESI) were recorded on LCMS-2010EV (SHIMADZU). 6.2. General solid-phase synthetic procedure for the preparation of the dipeptides (9) To the Wang resin (1.0 mmol) in DMF (5 mL) was added Fmocamino acid (3 equiv), DIC (3 equiv) and DMAP (0.25 equiv), and the mixture was stirred for 3 h. The resin was filtered, washed with DMF and CH 2 Cl 2 and dried under vacuum to yield 6. After removal of the Fmoc-group using 20% piperidine in DMF over 20 min, the next appropriate amino acid was coupled to the resin using the coupling agents DIC (3 equiv) and HOBt (3 equiv) by solid-phase synthesis techniques. The resulting intermediate 7 was then treated with 20% piperidine in DMF for 20 min to remove the Fmocgroup and subsequently reacted with the corresponding carboxylic acid (3 equiv) by the DIC-HOBt method or acid chloride (3 equiv) in the presence of Et 3 N to produce 8. Finally, the resin was treated with TFA/H 2 O (10:1, 2 mL), and the mixture was filtered after 1 h. The filtrate was removed under high vacuum to give the desired dipeptides 9, which were used directly in the next step without further purification or analysis. 25 Compound 11 was prepared through sequential reactions from the well-known intermediate 10, as reported previously. 27 To a solution of the acid 11 (5.0 g, 12.0 mmol in DMF, 80 mL) was added EDCÁHCl (1.85 g, 13.44 mmol), HOBt (1.56 g, 13.44 mmol) and N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine (1.31 g, 13.44 mol) at ambient temperature. The solution was cooled to 0°C and TEA (1.87 mL, 13.44 mmol) was added slowly. After 2 h, the DMF was evaporated and the resulting residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (100 mL). The organic phase was subsequently washed with 5% citric acid (50 mL), 5% NaHCO 3 (50 mL) and brine (50 mL). This organic layer was then dried over Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield the Weinreb amide derivative 12, which was purified by column chromatography (EtOAc/MeOH = 9.5:0.5). To a solution of thiazole (1.373 g, 10.0 mmol) in THF at À78°C was added n-BuLi (2.0 mol in THF, 1.67 mL) dropwise over 15 min. After 1 h stirring, the Weinreb amide 12 (0.640 g, 2.0 mmol) in THF was slowly added dropwise over 20 min and the solution was stirred for 3 h. The reaction was quenched with sat. NH 4 Cl and allowed to stir at 0°C for 20 min. The mixture was evaporated and dissolved in ethyl acetate. This solution was washed with water and brine, and then dried over Na 2 SO 4 . The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was subjected to flash chromatography (EtOAc/ MeOH = 9:1) to obtain the pure compound 13a. The data for the compound 12 & 13a has been reported in a previous article. 25 Compounds 13b-d were prepared from 12 according to the procedure described for the synthesis of 13a.
