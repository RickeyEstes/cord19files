Gram stain, fungal stain and acid-fast bacilli stain were routinely performed. Cytology examination (BAL fluid cytospins) was performed systematically in patients attended at HCU, and nonroutinely at HLF. In all, BAL fluid cytospin data were available from 83 patients. In addition, BAL fluid specimens were examined for the presence of respiratory viruses (RVs) using either the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Austin, TX,USA) at HCU, which allows detection of 19 RVs, or the CLART® PneumoVir assay (Genomica, Coslada, Spain)-at both centers-that makes it possible to detect simultaneously 17 RVs, as previously reported. 25 Quantitative cultures of BAL specimens for bacterial isolation were performed on conventional media as recommended 26 ; bacterial loads > 10 4 CFU/mL were deemed to be clinically relevant. 26 BAL specimens were cultured on BCYE-alpha agar, BD (becston Dickinson) MGIT® (Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube)/Lowenstein-Jensen agar slants and Sabouraud agar for recovery of Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium spp., and fungal organisms, respectively. The Platelia TM Aspergillus Ag Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used for quantitation of Aspergillus spp. galactomannan in BAL fluid and serum specimens. Calcofluor white, blue toluidine or direct immunofluorescence staining procedures were used for detection of Pneumocystis jiroveci. 26 Lung biopsy tissue specimens were not obtained. Likewise, neither shell vial and conventional viral cultures for CMV detection or recovery nor direct fluorescent antibody testing for CMV detection were performed. [39] .
