Flavonols were extracted from plasma as described by Egert et al. (2008) and concentrations of quercetin aglycone and its methylated (isorhamnetin, tamarixetin) and dehydroxylated (kaempferol) derivatives were analyzed by HPLC with fluorescence detection as previously described (Ader et al., 2000; Berger et al., 2012; Gohlke et al., 2013) . Briefly, plasma samples were thawed in a 40°C water bath. Then 980 μL of plasma was acidified with 130 μL of acetic acid (0.583 mol/L), spiked with 20 μL of methanolic rhamnetin solution (internal standard, 1 mg/20 mL in methanol; Rotichrom HPLC, Carl Roth GmbH), and treated with a mixture of β-glucuronidase and sulfatase (from Helix pomatia Type H-1, with final activities of 7,300 and 130 U/mL for glucuronidase and sulfatase, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Dreieich, Germany) to cleave the ester bonds of glucuronides and sulfates. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, 3 mL of acetone was added and the samples were centrifuged at 3,700 × g for 45 min at 4°C. The supernatant was evaporated until dry. Residues were resolved in 200 μL of methanol, and after 15 min in an ultrasonic bath 77.5 μL of nanopure water and 22.5 μL of hydrochloric acid (10 mol/L) were added. For flavonol analyses by HPLC, 30 μL of the final solution was injected by a cooled (4°C) autosampler (AS-2057 Plus, Jasco Deutschland GmbH, Groß-Umstadt, Germany) onto a C-18 Kromasil 100 column (250 × 4 mm, particle size = 5 μm, Jasco Deutschland GmbH) guarded by a precolumn (C-18 Inertsil ODS-2, 10 × 4 mm, particle size = 5 μm, Jasco Deutschland GmbH). The eluent (flow rate: 1 mL/min) was composed of 0.025 mol/L of sodium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 2.4), acetonitrile, and methanol (68:27:5 vol/vol/vol). In a postcolumn reactor, the effluent was mixed with aluminum nitrate [flow rate = 0.4 mL/min, 1 mmol/L in methanol containing 7.5% (vol/vol) acetic acid] for derivatization, and fluorescence of the flavonolaluminum complex was measured using a fluorescence detector (excitation wavelength = 422 nm, emission wavelength = 485 nm; FP920, Jasco Deutschland GmbH). Identification of peaks obtained was performed using the retention times of the standards, which were prepared with pure flavonols and treated in the same way as samples. The detection limit of flavonols was ≤10 nmol/L and the recovery rate was 92 ± 2% (mean ± SE). Inter-and intraassay variances for quercetin were 7.2 and 0.5%. The sum of plasma concentrations of quercetin and its metabolites in plasma is referred to as total flavonols. Plasma metabolites were analyzed spectrophotometrically (ABX Penta 400; Horiba ABX SAS, Montpellier Cedex, France) by the Clinic for Cattle (University of Veterinary Medicine, Foundation, Hannover, Germany) using the respective kits: albumin (no. A11A01664) and lactate (no. A11A01721; Horiba Europe GmbH, Hannover, Germany), NEFA (no. 434-91795; Wako Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany), glucose (no. 553-230) and total protein (no. 553-412; MTI Diagnostics GmbH, Idstein, Germany), and urea (no. LT-UR 0050; Labor + Technik E. Lehmann GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Plasma insulin concentrations were determined using an RIA as previously described (Vicari et al., 2008) . Plasma cortisol concentrations were analyzed using a commercial ELISA kit validated for bovine plasma (EIA-1887; DRG Instruments GmbH, Marburg, Germany; Weber et al., 2013) . Cross reactivities of the monoclonal antibody against corticosterone and progesterone were 45 and 9%, respectively, and to any further plasma steroids lower than 2%. Test sensitivity was 3.4 ng/mL; inter-and intraassay variations were 5.3 and 12.1%, respectively. Colostrum was analyzed for DM, CP, crude fat, and ash content (Qualitätsprüfungs-und Dienstleistungsgesellschaft Mecklenburg-Vorpommern mbH, Güstrow, Germany) according to the Weender standard procedure (Naumann and Bassler, 2004) , as shown in Table  1 . Chemical composition of milk replacer and concentrates were according to the manufacturers' declarations (Table 1) .
