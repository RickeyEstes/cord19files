Cells. The human cell lines 293T and HeLa were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heated-inactivated fetal calf serum (Gibco, USA or Sijiqi, China). HeLa cell lines that stably expressing human ACE2 protein have been described in a previous report [6] . Preparation of pseudoviruses. The construction of a codon-optimized full-length S gene of SARS-CoV BJ01, bat SL-CoV Rp3, and chimeric S gene (designated CS 310-518 ), which has the Rp3-S gene containing aa 310-518 of BJ01 S in replacement of its corresponding region, has been described previously [3] . Briefly, 12 lg each of pHIV-Luc (pNL.4.3.Luc.E À R À ) and plasmid pcDNA3.1 containing various S genes (or empty vector control) were co-transfected into 2 Â 10 6 293T cells in 10 cm dishes by standard calcium phosphate method [6] . The pseudoviruses were purified by ultracentrifugation from cell culture supernatant through a 20% sucrose cushion (10 mL) at 55,000g for 60 min using a Ty70 rotor (Beckman). The pelleted pseudoviruses were dissolved in 100 lL of PBS and stored at À80°C in aliquots until further use. Antisera. Six field bat sera showing positive (5 of 6) or negative (1 of 6) cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV [1] were used in this study. Hyperimmune mouse sera were generated by DNA immunizations with plasmids pcDNA 3.1(+) containing the codon-optimized fulllength S gene of SARS-CoV BJ01, SL-CoV Rp3, and two chimeric plasmids CS 310-518 and CS 259-518 (see Fig. 1 for diagrams). The pcDNA 3.1(+) vector was used as a negative control. Five groups (five mice per group) of 6-8 week old female BALB/c mice were immunized with 30 lg of plasmid DNA in 30 lL PBS by in vivo electroporation according to the published method [7] . Mice were immunized three times at weeks 0, 3 and 5. Sera were collected at week 8. After injection into the right quadriceps muscle, a pair of electrode needles with 5 mm apart was inserted into the muscle to cover the DNA injection sites and electric pulses were delivered using an electric pulse generator (Electro Square Porator T830 M; BTX, San Diego, CA). Three pulses of 100 V each, followed by three pulses of the opposite polarity, were delivered to each injection site at a rate of one pulse per second. Each pulse lasted for 50 ms. ELISA. All ELISAs were performed under stringent conditions to avoid nonspecific reactions. Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates were coated in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) over night at 4°C with purified pseudoviruses (50-200 ng/well). The plates were washed and blocked with 5% BSA in PBS-0.1% Tween 20, and then incubated with bat or mouse sera for 1 h at 37°C. Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (LingFei Tech.) or goat anti-bat IgG (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.) (Dilution at 1:4000). Color development was conducted using 3,3,5,5,tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and the absorbance at 450 nm was determined after the reaction was stopped with 2 M H 2 SO 4 . All washes were carried out using PBS-0.1% Tween for 5 washes (2 min/wash), and all antibodies were diluted using 0.5% BSA in PBS-0.1% Tween. Appropriate negative controls were included in every step. Neutralization assays. A pseudovirus-based neutralization assay was used to determine the neutralization ability of immunized sera to pseudovirus HIV/BJ01-S, and HIV/CS 318-510 . The neutralizing activity of heat-inactivated sera (56°C, 30 min) was determined by mixing 10 ng of pseudovirus (in 30 lL) with diluted antisera (in 30 lL) at 37°C for 1 h. Sera-pseudovirus complexes were then mixed with 16 ng polybrene (in 40 lL medium) before they were added to human ACE2 expressing HeLa cells. The infected cells were washed with PBS and lysed (Cell Culture Lysis Reagent; Promega) at 48 h post infection. The neutralization activity of each antiserum was monitored by measurement of luciferase activity.
