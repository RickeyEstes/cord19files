In a preliminary set of assays, 25 faecal samples previously found to be rotavirus-positive by ELISA, PAGE and EM were tested using differ-ent methods of RNA extraction in order to determine the most reliable and efficient procedure. The results of these assays are shown in table I. Phenol-chloroform extraction followed by binding of RNA to CFl 1 cellulose in ST"&ethanol and elution with STE, as described by Wilde et al. (1990) , was an efficient method to recover rotaviral RNA from stool samples free of inhibitory activity. All 25 samples analysed by RT/FCR were positive when phenol-extracted and purified by CFl 1 cellulose, whereas only 11 (44%) were positive when purification with CFll was omitted. Equally effective appeared to be the RNAID method, which also allowed the detection of viral RNA in all 25 samples tested. However, the GeneReleaser method was, in our experience, inefficient in purifying rotaviral RNA or removing inhibitors from the faecal samples. Having established the efficacy of both CFll cellulose purification and the RNAlD method in extracting viral RNA and/or removing inhibitory substances from faecal samples, we used the RNAID me&d with all the specimens tested. Sensitivity of the RT/PCR assay The limit of detection of the RWPCR using an SAl 1 rotavirus suspension serially diluted in a 10% faecal extract was 5 x lo3 PFU/ml ( fig. 1 ). In comparison, the ELISA test used in this study could detect 5 x lo5 PFU/ml. The results obtained from analyses by electron microscopy, ELISA, PAGE and RT/PCR are presented in table II. Sixty-eight samples (30.9%) were found to be positive by one or more of the techniques applied. In two specimens, the result of RT/PCR was negative, whereas the ELISA test showed positive results. These were considered to be false-negative PCR results. Conversely, four samples were positive by RT/l?CR but negative by ELISA. Rotavirus particles were detected by EM in 56 specimens (25.4%). Other viruses were also detected among the 220 faecal samples studied, mainly adenovirus (8.1%), astrovirus (2.2 %), calicivirus (1.8%) and coronavirus-like particles (1.3%). PAGE analysis was positive with 59 faecal samples (26.8 %). Most rotavirus strains showed "long" electrophoresis pattern, with the exception of 5 strains (8.4%) which were found to have "short" electrophoretypes. Ten different electrophoretypes were detected during the course of this study (results not shown). PCR amplification products were easily detected by agarose gel electrophoresis (figs. 2 and 3). A clear and distinctive fragment of about are RT/PCR products from faecal samples extracted with phenol-chloroform and purified using CFll cellulose. Lanes 3 and 4 are from faecal samples extracted with the RNAID method as described in "Materials and Methods". Lanes 5 and 6 are positive (RNA from simian rotavirus SAll) and negative controls, respectively. K = 1-kb DNA ladder. The oligonucleotide primers used are specific for the viral gene encoding VP7 from any group A rotavirus strain. 1 kb was consi&mxl to he the product of a specific anplikdon of the rotavirus gene 9 (or gene 8).
