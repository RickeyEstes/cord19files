Preparation of cationic nanoliposomes. Cationic nanoliposomes were prepared using the lipid-film hydration method as previously described. 32 Chol was purchased from the Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO), and the lipids EDOPC, DOTAP, DOTMA, DC-Chol, and DOPE were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL, USA). These lipids, dissolved in chloroform, were mixed at different compositions and evaporated using a rotary evaporator to eliminate the organic solvent. For nanoliposome preparation, EDOPC, Chol, and DOPE (15 μmol total lipids) were mixed at a molar ratio of 8:5:2 ( Table 1 ). In other nanoliposome formulations, DOTAP or DOTMA were used instead of EDOPC, and DC-Chol was used in place of Chol. Thin lipid films were hydrated with 1 ml of 20 mmol/l HEPES (pH 7.4), and the resulting nanoliposomes were extruded three times through 0.2 μm polycarbonate membrane filters (Isopore; Millipore, Billerica, MA) using an Extruder (Northern Lipids, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). After complexation of various cationic nanoliposomes with siRNA, the sizes and zeta potentials of nanolipoplexes were determined using an ELS-8000 instrument (Photal, Osaka, Japan). Cell culture and siRNA uptake. The murine melanoma cell line B16F10 and murine LLC cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Both cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere. All media were enriched with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 1% of each penicillin and streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cellular uptake of siRNA was determined in B16F10 cells seeded onto 24-well plates 1 day before treatment. After replacing medium with fresh (300 μl/ well), fluorescently labeled dsRNA (Block-iT; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at a concentration of 50 nmol/l was mixed with nanoliposomes at an N/P ratio of 20:1, or with Lipofectamine 2000 (L2K; Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting nanolipoplexes were added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. Cells were harvested, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and evaluated by flow cytometry using a BD FACSCalibur system and Cell Quest Pro analysis software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Cytotoxicity assay. The cytotoxicity of cationic nanoliposomes was monitored using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. B16F10 cells were seeded onto 48-well plates at a density of 1 × 10 4 cells/well and allowed to attach for 1 day, after which the medium was replaced with 200 μl of fresh culture medium. Luciferasespecific GL2 siRNA (siGL2; ST Pharm., Seoul, Korea), which is nonfunctional in mammals, was complexed with various cationic nanoliposomes at an N/P ratio of 20:1, or with L2K according to the manufacturer's instruction. siGL2-containing nanolipoplexes were added to cells at an siGL2 concentration of 50 nmol/l. After incubation for various time periods, cells were treated with 20 μl of a 5 mg/ml MTT solution for 2 hours. Untreated cells were used as a control. The culture medium was then removed, and 200 μl of a 0.04 N HCl/isopropanol solution was added. The viability of cells was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm using a microplate reader (Sunrise; TECAN, Männedorf, Switzerland). The viability of cells in each group was expressed relative to that of untreated cells as a percentage.
