Details of the applied costs and their source are provided in Table 1 . Resource use and unit costs were in 2010 Australian dollars. Cost estimates were also converted into Euro (€), US dollar (US$) and British pound (£) in the Results section using the 2010 exchange rate [the purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor was taken into account]. 13 For the PPP values, we chose International Monetary Fund as the source data set; accordingly, in 2010, AU$1Á00 was equal to €0Á56, US$0Á66 and £0Á44, respectively. The reported hourly wage rate was used to calculate the costs of recreation time lost among the household members where income information was collected. In those whose income information was not collected, the costs of recreation time lost were calculated using the mean income of an Australian male and female in 2010. 14 As the costs incurred in this study were within a short follow-up period (4 months), a discount rate was not applied (study period <12 months).
