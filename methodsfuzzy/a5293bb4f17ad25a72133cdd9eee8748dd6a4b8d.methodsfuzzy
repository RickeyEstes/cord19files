In this case-control study 206 children referred to the pediatric clinic of Kashan Beheshti hospital in the second half of 1388 were evaluated. Spirometery or peak flow metery was used for the diagnosis of ADHD. Using the SPSS software version 19, chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. Result It was found that the prevalence of ADHD in children with asthma is significant higher than control group and increases the risk about five fold more. It was also found that having ADHD does not have a significant correlation with the severity of asthma. Conclusion It was found that asthma is one of the risk factors for developing ADHD, but ADHD is not related to the severity of asthma morbidity. Keywords: Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder, Asthma Case report: A 7 years-old boy with main complaint of blistering all over his body, fever and weak condition. His lips were ulcerated, erythematous, swollen covered with pseudomembran and hemorrhagic crust. There were pruritic hyperpigmented plaques with papilovesicular eruptions at their center (bullous target lesions) covered almost of his whole body. There were also macula erythematous with vesicle and ulceration in his external genital and scrotum. He suffered from blistering since 3 days before admission. The lesion appeared first in the face and mouth, then spreads to the whole body. After that his mucosa of mouth and lips were ulcerated and he had difficulty in swallowing. He had been on medical treatment to a doctor before, but on the 4 th day of illness there were red blotches and vesicles appeared on his body, sore throat and oral thrush. So he admitted in hospital for 3 days, but his condition was getting worse and came to our hospital. The O widal test result was 1/320. The assessment were SJS and suspected Typhoid fever. Treatment were supportive, ceftriaxone and corticosteroid. This patient discharged in a good condition. Summary: Thypoid is one of SJS bacterial etiologies in children. Diagnosis established after clinical examination, serological, epidemiologicallyprevalent and probable infections in country area. Antibiotic is required for SJS caused by infections. with female, unemployment but not associated with lung function in asthmatics. Conclusion: The present study showed that depression was an important risk factor of the prevalence of asthma in Korean adult. These results warrant future studies to explore the mechanisms responsible for the association between depression and asthma. We explored medline and a Japanese database seeking literature written English or Japanese for anaphylactic cases by ants in Japan and investigated its nature. We aimed to compare anxiety and depression levels of the patients with severe asthma before and after the omalizumab treatment. Patients' anxiety levels were measured with state trait anxiety inventory (STAI) and depression levels were measured with beck depression scale. Findings Five male (%25), fifteen female (%25) patients enrolled in study. The average age of the patients were 50,25. The average score of beck depression scale of patients was 25,35 and 8,55 before and after treatment, relatively. The score was higher before treatment, it was statically meaningful when it compared with after treatment scores (p<0.001). The STAI average score was 52,05 before treatment and 42.95 after it. There was a statistically meaningful difference between the anxiety score average before and after the treatment (p<0.0001). The anxiety score was higher before the treatment. Failure in symptom controlling in asthma can lead to depression. We think that these patients should be examined for psychological disor-Introduction & Objectives: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common debilitating problem worldwide. Despite its prevalence in the Middle East, very little data is available on the economic impact of CSU on the public health system. This study evaluates the direct medical costs of treating refractory CSU patients in Kuwait. It also evaluates the budget impact of omalizumab (monoclonal anti-IgE antibody) use in these patients. Methods: Prevalence of CSU was estimated through the Delphi method. Data regarding drug utilization and health care system utilization was collected retrospectively from charts of refractory CSU patients who were followed at the Al-Rashed Allergy center in Kuwait. Costs were calculated from a health system perspective. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted on the price and utilization of each cost component. Results: Before omalizumab use, the total direct costs of treating 1,293 refractory CSU patients was estimated to be 1, 072, 837 KD (US$ 3, 570, 185) per year, corresponding to around 829.7 KD per patient per annum (US$ 2,761). The total cost was principally generated by outpatient visits 1,072,837 KD; which corresponds to 82.45% of the total cost). After omalizumab use, the cost was estimated to be 4,654,800 KD (US$ 15,490,234) per year, corresponding to around 3,600 KD per patient per annum (US$ 11, 980) . The total cost was principally generated by omalizumab costs 4,762,895 KD; which corresponds to 97% of the total cost. All other direct costs of treating CSU patients were decreased after the use of omalizumab. Conventional medication costs and hospitalization costs were reduced by 90% and ER costs were reduced by 97%. Cost estimates were most sensitive to variations in the price and utilization of outpatient visits and the price of omalizumab. Conclusion: The economic burden of refractory CSU in Kuwait is high. The introduction of omalizumab on the health care system is costly because of its high price; however, omalizumab has proven to be effective and is driving all other direct costs down. Thirty-five patients who visited Hiroshima University Dermatology clinic from January 2009 to April 2015 for the treatment of DU were studied retrospectively. C) Results DU in 27 patients were refractory to standard doses of antihistamines. However, all or most symptoms disappeared in 7 out of 27 patients who increased the dose of an antihistamine up to twice. Ten out of 21 patients who were treated with both an antihistamine and montelukast cleared the symptoms. Other 10 patients whose symptoms had not subsided by high doses of antihistamines and montelukast additionally took cyclosporine. In six of them, most symptoms diminished, but two of them did not show any change. The other two patients dropped out because of side effects. A total of 206 patients who were diagnosed with asthma in Asan Medical Center asthma cohort from June 2005 to Mar 2013 were subject to analysis, after sorting out patients whose BMI were â‰¥25. We divided these patients into two groups, MHO asthmatics (n=106) and MUO asthmatics (n=100), referring to the NCEP ATP III identification of the metabolic syndrome. Then we compared asthma-related clinical characteristics between these two groups. To investigate the prevalence of atopic eczema (L20), we did analyze the nationwide database (National Health Insurance Corporation) which included the health-care records of 48.1 million individuals between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2014 Objective: Recurrent wheeze is one of the predictive markers of asthma in preschool children. The aims of this study were to investigate airway inflammation, lung function, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and the prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) and atopic dermatitis (AD) in preschool children according to recurrent wheeze. Methods: We performed a population-based, crosssectional study with 933 children aged 4-6 years. A total of 900 children completed a modified International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire and eligible for the study. We measured exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), spirometry, methacholine bronchial provocation, and impulse oscillometry. Recurrent wheeze was defined as having a lifetime wheeze more than 3 times. Results: The prevalence of recurrent wheeze was 13.4%. Children with recurrent wheeze showed higher prevalence of lifetime and current AR and lifetime AD, not current AD. Recurrent wheeze was associated with lifetime emergency room visit more than 1 time and history of more than one admission within 12 months due to wheezing episode. High eNO, post-bronchodilator change of R 5 Hz, and blood eosinophils as well as low FEF 25-75% were associated with recurrent wheeze. However, dose response slope by methacholine test, prevalence of atopy or AHR, and serum IgE levels showed no significant differences between two groups. Conclusions: Recurrent wheeze in preschool children may be associated with lower lung function and airway inflammation, not with AHR or atopy. Backround. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a protein, which contains lectin and collagen domains, synthesized in the liver. MBL binds to N acetylglucosamine and mannan structures on the surface of bacteria, fungi, viruses and protozoa, leading to opsonization, phagocytosis and activation of complement system through lectin pathway, independent of an antibody. MBL is a vital protein of innate immune system and has two critical functions: complement activation through the lectin pathway and opsonization. Low level of serum MBL is associated with increased susceptibility to infections and high risk of some allergic and autoimmune diseases. Purpose. The purpose of our study was to determine the profile of MBL serum level in Mongolian healthy population the first time. Method. We were collected 112 serum of Mongolian healthy adult blood donors: 58 males and 54 females in 4 different age groups (20-30, 31-40, 41-50 and 51-60 Background: Many sufferers of Bronchial Asthma and COPD need nebuliser therapy in acute conditions.The rotahaler wih rotacaps delivers only 15 to 20% of the drug. Quite a few subjects do not use rotahalers properly inspite of adequate training. In acute exacerbations, their plight is worse. Hence for proper drug delivery in acute conditions, rotacap with rotahaler may not be adequate. Hence an attempt is made for effective delivery of the entire 200mcg salbutamol through a mechanical nebuliser. In the market only electronically operated nebulisers are available.The cost is still prohibitive .Most of the urban and rural areas do not have regular power supply. Even in the hospitals, the nebulisers are far from few. Conamination is a distinct possibility in the wards and ICU settings. There is also lot of wastage in the side stream of electronic nebuliser. It takes atleast 15 to 20 mins for the entire medicine to be nebulised. Hence an Air Pump driven mechanical nebuliser is developed. Material and Methods: An Air Pump made up of PVC weighing 600gms is fabricated for this device.This has a cylindrical chamber sliding on a steel rod. This has inbuilt posterior and anterior apertures to draw and propel the air out under pressure. There is a pedal mounted on the chamber.The whole unit rests on a metal frame. There is nylon lining for sliding of the cylinder on the inner axial rod. There is no grease applied for the cylindrical chamber to slide over the axial rod. The anterior end is attached to the nebulising unit, which is availabe in the market. The rotacap containing 200mcg of salbutamol is opened .The nebulising chamber is charged with the salbutamol rotacap powder, dissolving in one to two ml of normal saline. The user connects the mask to face and the other end to the the anterior end of the air pump, which has a nozzle. On pedalling the pump, the mist is released. There is no side stream, avoiding wastage.Thus its a self operating one. If required a helper may pedal the pump. Results: One hundred adult patients suffering from bronchial asthma were treated with this device, using salbutamol rotacap powder with normal saline as solvent. Apart from subjective assesment , the improvement was measured with Mini Wright Peak Flow Meter(PEFR). Averge PEFR was 200 lits per min before and 350 lits per min after rota nebulisation. Twenty five subjects with similar complaints were taken as control.They were assesed with salbutamol inhaler attached to spacer. The revesibility of the airways obstruction is better with this device as the entire 200mcg salbutamol is delivered properly. In contrast the drug delivery with the inhaler attached to the spacer is supposed to be only 40%. Over and above the users preferred this device as there is no inspiratory effort. To explore the level of serum Interleukin13(IL-13) and Interleukin 17A (IL-17A) in children with asthma. Methods A case-control study was performed.88 asthmatic children in asthma clinic and 28 children hospitalized in surgical for noninfectious elective surgery who came to Affiliated Children's Hospital of Capital Institute of Pediatrics in March to December 2014 were enrolled in the study. Boys 78 and girls 38, aged 5 to 14 years old, the mean age is 7 years 5 month. The level of serum IL-13 and IL-17A were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. The material of history, blood test, lung function test, the concentrations of fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), vitro allergern test of asthmatic children were reserved. Over a 28-days period 51 children patient underwent the long term stay with the medical treatment in medical institute in Metylovice. In total 31 girls and 20 boys in the same age with bronchial asthma fulfilled the inclusion criterion (GINA 2014) and were included in the study. In all patients, atopic status was evaluated by skin prick testing using common allergen extracts (grass and tree pollen, house dust mite, moulds, cat/dog extracts). Patients blood eosinophils leukocyte count, levels of total sesrum imunoglobulin E, serum eosinophil cationic protein and exhaled nitric oxide levels were determined.Daily the patients received 1500 IU of Vitamin D3 orally. We assessed EASI score as an objective disease severity, VAS of pruritus and LOS (0-10 point) as a severity of pruritus and sleep disturbance in 1877 AD patients at our dermatology clinic from 2007 to 2013. We also measured Eosinophilic count, total IgE and specific IgE in peripheral blood. Correlation of pruriruts and sleep disturbance with disease severity and laboratory parameters were determined by Pearson's correleation analysis using SPSS version 21.0. Results: The mean VAS of pruritus and LOS were 5.93Â±2.53 (Mean Â± SD) and 4.67Â±3.00. The mean EASI score was 14.0Â±12.1. Our study revealed that the EASI score showed weak statistical significance with VAS of pruritus and LOS. (EASI vs VAS of pruritus; r = 0.31, EASI vs VAS of LOS; r = 0.36) The eosinophil count revealed weak statistical significance with VAS of pruritus and LOS. (VAS of pruritus; r = 0.10, VAS of LOS; r = 0.23) The total IgE level showed no statistical significance with VAS of pruritus and LOS. Specific IgE titer to Dermatophagoides farinae (D2) showed weak statistical significance with VAS of pruritus and LOS. (VAS of pruritus; r = 0.10, VAS of LOS; r = 0.14). Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that EASI score weakly reflect the subjective severity (pruritus and LOS). Since severe pruritus and LOS can affect the quality of life of atopic dermtaittis patients and they are not strongly correlated with disease severity measured by dermatologists, dermatologists should aware the subjective symptoms from patients and consider to manage the subjective symptoms together with objective symptoms. Background: Hereditary factors of atopic dermatitis(AD) have been emphasized recently. AD-related gene mutations vary significantly across ethnicities. We tried to find mutations in FLG, SPINK5 and KLK7 genes from Korean AD patients and we aimed to develop a reverse blot hybridization assay(REBA) to apply to AD-related genes for the first time. Methods: We divided the AD subjects into moderate to severe AD and mild AD groups and also divided them into extrinsic and intrinsic AD groups. We checked on gene mutations using the REBA in AD and non-atopy control subjects. Results: The mutant type(MT) of KLK7 was significantly more frequent in AD subjects than in control and higher in the moderate to severe group compared to the mild group. The MT frequency was not different between the intrinsic and extrinsic AD groups. In the SPINK5mutation, AD subjects more frequently had the mixed type of 603-49A>T(Glu335Val), the MT of 1188T>C(His396His) and 2475G>T(Glu825Asp) compared to control, but there was no difference between intrinsic and extrinsic AD. Among AD subjects, the moderate to severe AD group had more gene mutations compared to the mild group. Conclusion: We found a correlation between the KLK7 mutation, the mutations in 1188T>C and 2475G>T, and 603-49A>T of SPINK5and AD which have not been reported in Asians including Koreans. Above all things, we verified that the REBA can be applied to detect multiple barrier-related gene mutations in AD easily, simply, and accurately. Background: Diagnostic work-up in patients suffering life-threatening drug anaphylaxis is difficult in clinical practice owing to the low sensitivity of the laboratory tests and the risk of anaphylaxis using in vivo tests. Flow cytometry-assisted basophil activation test (BAT) is suggested a safe diagnostic method, although it is more expensive and technically challenging compared to conventional in vitro or in vivo tests. We sought to evaluate the diagnostic utility of this testing in clinical practice. Method: Nineteen patients with a drug-induced anaphylaxis were recruited. Basophil activation test, skin tests, and measurement of commercially available specific IgE to drugs were performed for diagnostic evaluation. A stimulation indexâ‰¥2 and an absolute activated basophil percentageâ‰¥5 were considered positive response to BAT. Results: All patients met the FAAN/NIAID criteria for anaphylaxis. Causality assessment using the WHO-UMC classified them into the categories 'certain' or 'probable'. Male to female ratio was 1:1.1 and the mean age was 46.0 Â± 12.0 yrs. Five patients presented severe anaphyalxis such as hypotension, hypoxia or loss of consciousness, and the others were moderate severity. The involved drugs were cephalosporin antibiotics in 9 patients, eperisone 2, ranitidine 3, and aminoglycoside, glimepiride, humalog insulin, paclitaxel, tradamol, propofol in one patient each. BAT using CD 63 marker was positive in 12 (63.2%), and negative in 7 patients, whereas BAT using CD203c was positive in 9 (47.4%) and negative in 10 patients. When both markers applied, 14 patients (70.0%) showed positive to BAT. Skin test was positive in 8 (47.0%), negative in 9, and nonapplicable in two patients. Conclusion: The BAT proves to be a useful diagnostic tool for druginduced anaphyalxis. In addition, this test can identify the causative drug in patients with negative skin test or unavailable to sIgE measurement. Background: Bacterial colonization of the infant gut begins at birth and the gut microbiota in infant was unstable. The initial gut microbiota plays an important role in the development of immnue system. Disruption of the gut microbiota has been linked to the development of allergic diseases. Especially, feeding method has a significant impact on allergic diseases. Objective: We investigated the composition of gut microbiota according to feeding method and the association with serum IgE in infants. Materials and methods: Fecal samples were collected at 6 month from 47 infants in the COCOA birth cohort. Microbiota characterization was performed by using 16S rRNA shotgun sequencing. Results: The species richness (alpha-diversity) was not different according to feeding method. The significant higher level of Firmicutes and lower level of Actinobacteria detected in mixed milk (breast and formula milk) feeding infants than breast milk feeding infants at phylum level. The proportion of Bifidobacterium was significantly reduced, while Clostridium_g4, Clostridium, and Clostridium_g6 were highly enriched in mixed milk feeding infant than breast milk feeding infant at genus level. And the level of Escherichiapositively correlated with the total serum IgE at age 1 year in mixed milk feeding infant, but not in breast milk feeding infant. Conclusion: Feeding method is not affect to the diversity of gut microbiota. However it shapes the composition of specific bacteria and Escherichiaaffect to the development of atopy. Background: Transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²) plays crucial regulatory roles in T cell-mediated contact hypersensitivity (CHS). Canonical TGF-Î² signaling pathway is mediated through TGF-Î²specific receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) and the common Smad, Smad4. However, precise signaling mechanisms whereby TGF-Î² regulates T cells in CHS are not fully understood. Objectives: We sought to determine the mechanisms how TGF-Î² signaling through Smad4 regulates the pathogenic effector T cell subsets in CHS. Methods: We used Cd4Cre-loxp system to delete Smad4 in T cellspecific manner (Cd4Cre;Smad4 fl/fl,+/+ ). Cd4Cre;Smad4 fl/fl,+/+ mice were immunized and sensitized by 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNFB). Results: We found that T cell-specific deletion of Smad4 exacerbated DNFB-induced CHS with significant expansion and infiltration of CD8 + T cells in the draining lymph nodes and the skin lesions. Smad4 deficient CD8 + T cells upregulated Th2 differentiation, regardless of Smad4 genotypes of CD4 + T cells. Smad4 in combination with Smad3 suppressed the expression of a T-box transcription factor, Eomesodermin (Eomes) in CD8 + T cells. Expression of Eomes and the cytotoxic molecules in CD8 + T cells at the early phase of sensitization was significantly upregulated in Cd4Cre;Smad4 fl/fl mice compared with control Cd4Cre;Smad4 +/+ mice. Cytolytic molecules in CD8 + T cells upregulated by Smad4 deletion induced Th1 cell apoptosis, which resulted in increased Th2. Conclusions: These data highlight CD8 + T cell-intrinsic Smad4 as the crucial regulator of effector CD4 + T cell subsets in CHS. Folliculin levels in serum were measured by ELISA in asthma patients (n=405) who visited the asthma center in a tertiary referral hospital from May 2005 to December 2014, and healthy controls (n=94) who visited the Health Examination Center in the same hospital. Folliculin levels were compared in two groups and we investigated if the level of folliculin is correlated with lung function and other clinical variables within the group of asthma. Patients whose folliculin level over 148pg/ml were defined as "high follicullin group" and we sought to find out clinical characteristics of the 'high folliculin' phenotype. The personal particle sampler is a wearable device sampling ambient air and guiding the air to an adhesive stripe, where particles deposit. The stripe is contained in an exchangeable cartridge. After exposure, the stripe can be removed and analyzed microscopically or biochemically. Two properties of the personal particle sampler were examined: The correlation of sampled HDM allergen to concentration of allergen in the ambient air, and the maximum particle size of HDM material, which could be sampled. To analyze the correlation, several particle samplers were placed in an exposure chamber, which is able to generate a definable and constant HDM particle concentration over a dedicated period of time using grinded HDM material (less than 5um). The sampled material was then analyzed using a standard antigen test (Der p1 and Der f1). To analyze the maximum detectable particle size, different grain sizes where used in trickle tests, using full HDM bodies as the reasonable limit. The particles adhering to the stripe were verified microscopically.
