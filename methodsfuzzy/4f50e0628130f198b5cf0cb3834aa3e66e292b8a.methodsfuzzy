The tracer gas method has been widely used to determine the air exchange rates in buildings [37, 38] . Assuming a steady flow and well-mixed tracer gas, the calculation of the ventilation rate of the source room based on the principle of mass conservation can be achieved by the following equation:  where C in is the indoor CO 2 concentration (ppm), C out is the CO 2 concentration in ambient fresh air (ppm), V is the volume of the room (m 3 ), Q is the flow rate of the air (m 3 =s), and S is the emission rate of the tracer gas source (m 3 =s). The ventilation rate can be converted to air exchange per hour (ACH), based on equation (1), as , the ventilation rate of a room can be expressed as where C in;ti and C in;tiþ1 represent the tracer gas concentration of the room at times t i and t iþ1 , respectively. The reentry ratio is another indicator that was used to assess tracer gas transportation between the source and other rooms. In this study, the reentry ratio was defined as the fraction of the tracer gas from the source room that reenters another room during each time interval. This can be calculated by where C i;ti is the measured concentration of the tracer gas in the reentered room at time t i ,C j;ti s the concentration of the source room at time t i , S is the concentration of the source tracer gas, Δt is the time interval, and V i and V j are the volumes of the source and reentered rooms, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the incoming wind during two test days, monitored by the 10-m wind mast. Noted that, the data from 10 : 43 : 58 to 10 : 49 : 56 on June 9 are missing because of an equipment malfunction. The wind velocities are presented as vector components in which Uþ is the southern direction, Vþ is the eastern direction, and Wþ is the downward direction, a coordinate system is shown in Fig. 3 . Compared to the data from June 8, on June 9, the vector component U stayed positive for a majority of the test time, which indicates that the incoming wind was very stable and barely flowed in the reverse direction. Therefore, for convenience in the analysis, the test cases from June 9, 2019, are adopted for most of the following discussion.
