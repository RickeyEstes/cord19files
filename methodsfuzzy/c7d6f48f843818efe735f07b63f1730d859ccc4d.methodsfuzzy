The catalytically active chain A of the SARS 3CLpro X-ray crystal structure (PDB ID: 1UK4) without the bound CMK peptide and water molecules was used in the study from the PDB structure. The resultant structure was energy minimized using the DISCOVER module of Insight II (Accelrys) and used as the initial structure. A database of more than 15,000 compounds comprising of protease inhibitors (aspartyl, cysteine, serine, and metallo-proteases), HETATM records extracted from PDB (http://www.rcsb.org/) [30] , HIV inhibitors (polymerase, integrase, and reverse transcriptase), and a set of thiol reactive compounds filtered from Maybridge (http://www.maybridge.com), Leadquest (http://www.leadquest.com/), ACD laboratories (http:// www.acdlabschem.com), and NCI small-molecule databases (http:// dtp.nci.nih.gov) was used in the study. Virtual screening of the small molecule inhibitors against SARS 3Clpro was performed using the FlexX module in SYBYL6.9 (Tripos) set at default parameters unless otherwise indicated in the text. We utilized multiple well-known scoring functions: a GOLD-like function [16] , a DOCK-like function [17] , ChemScore [18] , a PMF function [19] , and FlexX [20] to rank order the complexes resulting from virtual screening. A list of top 200 compounds was selected from each scoring function, generated and purged into a dataset of 760 unique compounds. These compounds were subjected to physicochemical filters and merged into single database of 330 compounds. Identified lead molecules were in silico derivatized with suitable thiol reactive warheads. The resultant complexes were subjected to Molecular Dynamics simulations and energy minimization using DISCOVER module of Insight II. Molecular dynamics simulations consisted of an initial equilibration of 5 pico seconds (ps) and followed by 100 ps dynamics at 300 K. The final complex structure at the end of the MD simulation was subjected to 5000 steps of steepest descent energy minimization followed by conjugate gradient energy minimization. For all the above calculations, a distance-dependent dielectric constant and non-bonded distance cutoff of 20 Ã… were used. Molecular graphics images were produced using SYBYL6.9 and the UCSF Chimera package from the Computer Graphics Laboratory, University of California, San Francisco (http:// www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera; [21] ). Inhibitor-protease interactions were analyzed using occluded surface (OS) [22, 23] .
