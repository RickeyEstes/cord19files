A questionnaire was developed and sent electronically to the EISS collaborating networks (18 countries, 21 networks) in June 2002. Questions on the following topics were included in the questionnaire: specimen collection, representativity, laboratory diagnosis of influenza, reporting of variants, testing for other respiratory infections, serological testing, near-patients tests and preparedness for a pandemic. All of the networks responded. The results on two topics will be presented and discussed in this paper: methods used for typing and subtyping of influenza and testing for other respiratory infections. For the analysis of the methods, the networks were divided into two groups: (1) western Europe (Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Northern Ireland, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Wales), and (2) eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Poland and Romania). The methods used routinely for the typing of influenza (Fig. 1) are polymerase chain reaction (PCR), haemagglutination inhibition (HAI), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence (IF) and immunoperoxidase staining (IPT). The bar chart reveals a clear difference between the two groups: PCR is used most often (60%; Fig. 1 . Methods used for typing of influenza by the EISS networks (sentinel specimens, total percentage > 100 when more than one method is used for typing of influenza). West (n = 15): Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Switzerland and Wales. East (n = 5): Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Poland and Romania. n = 15) by the western countries, while HAI (60%) and ELISA (60%) are used most often by the eastern countries. It is important to note that eight networks used more than one technique for the typing of influenza (four west; four east). The methods routinely used for subtyping of influenza (Fig. 2) are HAI, PCR, IF and neuraminidase inhibition (NI). All eastern countries use HAI for the subtyping of influenza, while most (77%) of the western countries use PCR. Seven networks do more than one test for the subtyping of influenza (six west; one east).
