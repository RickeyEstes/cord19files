After an overnight fasting blood samples were collected from eight healthy adult individuals. This study was performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Institution. Written consent was obtained from each volunteer. Compounds. 1--D-ribofuranosyl-1, 2, 4-triazole-3 carboxamide (ribavirin) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, USA. Cell culture. PBMC were isolated from heparinized blood obtained from the healthy volunteers by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation. After washing, PBMC were seeded into round-bottom 96 well cultures at 1-2x 10 5 cell per well in a final volume of 180 μL RPMI's medium supplemented with antibiotics (penicillin, 100 U/mL and streptomycin, 100 (μgmL), 10% autologous serum, 2mM L-glutamine, 10 -5 M 2-mercaptoethanol. PBMC were separately challenged with phytohemaglutinin (PHA) (10 (μgmL) and tetanus toxoid (TT) (5 μg/mL) as a recall antigen in absence or presence of ribavirin at different concentrations (1, 10 and 100 M). Parallel sets of wells containing PBMC exposed to medium alone were used as negative controls. Ribavirin in different concentrations, and together with all recall antigens was screened for cytotoxic activity by trypan blue exclusion test. The cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere supplemented with 5% CO 2 . At day 3 and 6 after initiation of the cultures, aliquots (25 μL/well) of supernatant were collected and frozen at -20°C until being assayed for interferon-(IFN-), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-(TNF-) content receptively. After completion of different culture periods (3 days for PHA and 6 days for recall antigens-stimulated PBMC), cells were harvested. Results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Student's or Wilcoxon's matched paired tests were used to compare continuous variables. A p-value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
