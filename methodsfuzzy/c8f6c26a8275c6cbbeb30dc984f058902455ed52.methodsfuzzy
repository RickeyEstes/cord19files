Animals. Four-to-6-week-old female BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice and 3-to 6-week-old male and female Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice were used in the study. The Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice (breeding pairs) on the C57BL/6 background were originally purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and were maintained for selfbreeding in our animal facilities. The animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (53) . The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the New York Blood Center (permit numbers 344.00 and 345.01).
