2.1. Origin and isolation of QX-like strain ck/ZA/3665/11 Twenty-eight-day old chickens in a commercial broiler operation presented with acute lethargy, reduced feed consumption and mortality. Tracheitis and swollen kidneys were noted on post mortem, as well as a secondary Escherichia coli infection. The worst affected houses had mortality rates of 19.8%, 11.9% and 10.2%. IBV was isolated in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) as described in Knoetze et al. (2014) . After an initial two passages in ECE, the virus was passaged twice further at the University of Pretoria.
