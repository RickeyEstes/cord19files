2.1. Cell culture, antibodies and chemicals A31 cells (a clone derived from mouse Balb/c 3T3), BSC-40, BHK-21 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from WT and double knockout (KO) JNK1/2 À/À cells , were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), (% v/v), as follows: BSC-40 (6%); BHK-21 (10%) and JNK (5%), and antibiotics in 5% CO 2 at 37°C. FBS was purchased from Cultilab, Campinas, SP, Brazil. A31 cells were kindly provided by Sogayar (Department of Biochemistry, University of São Paulo, Brazil). Davis (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA) gently provided us with WT and JNK1/2 KO cells. The following rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (São Paulo, Brazil): anti b-Tubulin or Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA): anti-phospho JNK1/2 (Thr183/Tyr185), anti-c-JUN (Ser73), anti-total ERK1/2, as were the horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Both SP600125 [anthra(1, 9cd) pyrazol-6(2H)-one 1,9-pyrazoloanthrone] (structural formula below) and the JNK Inhibitor VIII (JNKi VIII) -(N-(4-amino-5-cyano-6-ethoxypyridin-2-yl)-2-(2,5-dimethoxyphenylacetamide), were purchased from Calbiochem (São Paulo, Brazil); inhibitors were diluted in DMSO to a final concentration of 25 mM (SP600125) and 4 mM (JNKi VIII) and stored at À20°C.
