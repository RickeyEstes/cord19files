This study was a retrospective review of medical records; institutional review board approval was obtained We reviewed the medical records of the patients to identify those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a nosocomial infection and who met the criteria for ARDS using the Berlin definition [13] . The incubation period is estimated to be 4 to 6 days [14] . Nosocomial infection was defined as an infection that occurred up to 5 days after discharge or more than 5 days in admission. Death information of patients was confirmed using hospital medical record and obliterated information of national health insurance service which means death. Clinically relevant parameters were identified on the day of execution of mRT-PCR and admission to the ICU or ward; these included temperature, respiratory rate, applied fraction of inspired oxygen, partial pressure of arterial oxygen, white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine, total bilirubin, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and procalcitonin level. The patients were divided into non-ARDS and ARDS groups, and the risk factors and laboratory values for ARDS were assessed.
