Inhibition assay of live SARS-CoV infection. Thirteen protease inhibitors, including Ben-HCl, 6-aminohexanoic acid, antipain, aprotinin, bestatin, chymostatin, E-64, EDTA disodium salt, N-ethylmaleimide, leupeptin, pepstatin, phosphoramidon, and trypsin inhibitor (Novagen, USA and Sigma, USA), were selected for testing the potential inhibition of SARS-CoV infection in cell cultures by plaque reduction assay [12] using SARS-CoV strain GZ50 (GenBank Accession No. AY304495). Construction and preparation of pseudotyped SARS-CoV/HIV. Pseudotyped SARS-CoV/HIV (pseudovirus) bearing the codon-optimized full-length S protein of SARS-CoV and a defective HIV-1 genome expressing luciferase as reporter (pNL4-3.luc.RE) was prepared as previously described [13] . The produced pseudovirus was quantified by measuring p24 protein level using a Vironostika HIV-1 antigen MicroELISA kit (Biomerieux bv Boxtel, Netherlands). Inhibition assay of pseudovirus infection. To assess inhibitory effect of Ben-HCl on the infection of pseudovirus, 293T cells expressing ACE2 (293T/ACE2) were pre-incubated with Ben-HCl at different concentrations for 30 min at 37°C, followed by infection with varying concentrations of pseudovirus. The medium was replaced after overnight incubation or at indicated time points, and cells were continually incubated for an additional 48 h. The infectivity of the pseudovirus was determined by measuring relative luciferase activities (RLU) using a luciferase kit (Promega, USA) in a Wallac Microbeta 1420 counter (Perkin-Elmer, USA) according to the manufacture's instruction. Cleavage and inhibition assay of the S protein. The cleavage and inhibition assay of the full-length recombinant SARS-CoV S protein (Protein Sciences Corporation, USA) was performed using protease Factor Xa and its inhibitor Ben-HCl (Novagen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. In brief, the S protein was incubated with Factor Xa in the presence or absence of Ben-HCl for 6 h at room temperature. In the cleavage and inhibition assay of the pseudoviral S protein, pseudovirus was incubated with different concentrations of Factor Xa in the presence or absence of Ben-HCl at room temperature for 2 and 6 h, respectively. Pseudovirus was also added to 293T/ACE2 cells with or without preincubation with Ben-HCl at 37°C for 30 min. The culture supernatant was collected at indicated time points. SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The cleavage and inhibition of the fulllength and pseudoviral S protein were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot according to the protocol described previously [14] . The cleaved S1 and S2 bands were confirmed using specific primary antibodies against SARS-CoV S1 (S1-121B8) and S2 (S2-102D7 or -119F6) subunits [15] and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (DAKO, Denmark). Detection of Factor Xa transcription. Transcription of Factor Xa in 293T/ACE2 cells was tested by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Total cellular RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, USA), and cDNA was subsequently synthesized using random primers and SuperScript II RT kit (Invitrogen, USA). Three pairs of primers for amplifying three fragments of the coding region of Factor Xa were: the forward primers 5 0 -GACACAGTACTCGGCCACACCAT GG-3 0 , 5 0 -AATGAACGCAGGAAGAGGTCAGTG-3 0 , 5 0 -AGATTCA AGGTGAGGGTAGGGGACC-3 0 , respectively, and the reverse primers 5 0 -CGTCGTCTTGTCGCTGTCCTCAAAG-3 0 , 5 0 -TACCCTCACCTTG AATCTCTTGGCT-3 0 , 5 0 -GAGTGGGATCTCACTTTAATGGAGA-3 0 , respectively. As the internal control, b-Actin was amplified with a forward primer 5 0 -GCACACTTAGCCGTGTTCTTTGCACTTTCT-3 0 and a reverse primer 5 0 -AGGCGTACAGGGATAGCACAGCCTGGATAG-3 0 . PCR for amplifying specific gene fragments was performed with 40 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 10 min in the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, USA). Detection of Factor Xa protein expression. Expression of Factor Xa in 293T/ACE2 cells at the protein level was detected by immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western blot. b-Actin was included as a house-keeping protein control. IP was done using EZview Red Protein A Affinity Gel kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction (Sigma, USA). Precipitated proteins (30 lg) were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot as described above. The primary antibodies for IP and Western blot were anti-Factor Xa (R&D Systems, USA) and anti-b-actin (Abcam, USA).
