Study Design This is a prospective study of individuals residing within the Seattle Metropolitan area with ARI symptoms. The study is nested within the Seattle Flu Study, a multi-armed influenza surveillance mechanism described, the protocol of which is described elsewhere [14] . Descriptive statistics of frequency/percentage and mean/standard deviation will be performed for categorical and continuous covariates, respectively. Bivariate analyses will be conducted using parametric and nonparametric tests as appropriate, with statistical significance defined as p<0.05. Respiratory pathogen prevalence is defined as the total number of cases of a pathogen detected out of the total number of tested samples. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated using negative binomial or Poisson regressions with robust standard errors. Additional analyses will occur, as described elsewhere in the Seattle Flu Study protocol [14] .
