This was prepared as previously described (Narita et al., 1982) . Briefly, a faecal suspension was prepared as a bacteria-free 20 per cent intestinal contents filtrate after one gnotobiotic piglet passage. No virus other than rotavirus was detected in the suspension by electron microscopic examination. Piglets were inoculated orally with 2 ml of the faecal filtrate. .4nimals Five P-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were used. They were kept at 26 "C in individual metal cages with positive pressure ventilation. Each was given 2 ml of the rotavirus suspension and they were killed at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 48 h after inoculation.
