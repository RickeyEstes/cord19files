An explanatory serum PFOA concentration of 30 ng/mL was chosen as reference, corresponding to a 7% increase in total cholesterol and a consequent increase in cardiovascular risk in adults over 40 years (EFSA December 2018 Scientific Opinion:BMDL5: 9.4 ng/mL). A baseline serum PFOA concentration of 46 ng/mL was considered (taking the median value measured among the participants to the Regional Health Surveillance Plan) to describe the substance clearance in response to different realistic scenarios of contamination of drinking water and raw food. A simplified one-compartment pharmacokinetic model, was used (half-life 2.3 years, distribution volume 0.17 ml/kg body weight, lactating women), according to USEPA 2016. The survey was piloted on a sample of 73 public health professionals belonging to the Italian Society of Hygiene (SItI). The on-line questionnaire consists of five sections: socio-demographic information; political and health system attitudes; personal and professional experience with vaccinations; attitudes and beliefs towards mandatory vaccination; perception of the epidemiologic, social and economic impact of mandatory vaccination. During February-April of 6 consecutive years (2014-2019), and in November 2016, we conducted 7 PPS adopting the "Point prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals" protocol by European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, , at the 1300 acute-care beds San Martino Policlinic Hospital, a teaching hospital located in Genoa, North-West Italy. Chi square for linear trend was used to describe the prevalence trends and multivariate linear regression was used to assess risk of factor for HAI insurgence. A systematic review of full economic evaluations comparing RAS testing vs. no-testing was performed for articles published in English between 2000 and 2018. Study quality was assessed using the QHES scale and the BMJ checklist. Risk of bias in individual studies was evaluated with the Philips checklist for economic modelling studies. We performed a systematic PubMed search and we included in our assessment only studies reporting demographic and disease-related characteristics, as well as trace element levels in different specimens (whole blood, serum/plasma and CSF). We then performed a meta-analysis of mean differences of trace element levels between cases and controls, using a random-effect model computing the weighted mean differences (WMD) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) to assess the association between serum/plasma, whole blood, CSF and selenium, copper, iron and zinc with Parkinson's disease. This cross-sectional analysis included 841 women, aged 25-64 years, with no history of severe diseases. Adherence to MD was assessed by Food Frequency Questionnaire and the Mediterranean Diet score (MDS) based on 9 components. Associations of social (i.e. educational level, employment and marital status, and parity) and behavioral (i.e. smoking habit, physical activity, and BMI) determinants with adherence to MD and its components were tested by multivariable logistic regression analysis and expressed as Odds ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). The Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† -ISS) and Ministry of Health (MoH) are promoting a national program on HL, by participating to the WHO action network on measuring population and organizational health literacy (M-POHL). Main objective of ISS and MoH engagement is the proposal of policies that could enable all citizens to share the benefits of improved HL. A national population survey, coordinated at European level and carried out by each participating country, is planned for next Autumn. Two series of batch experiments were conducted with fresh mixed liquor (ML) from aeration basins sampled from a local wastewater plant. In the batch test, 2 L glass beakers with 1 L of mixed liquor were run for 24 h following both biodegradation and adsorption of BIT and MIT. During the first experimental run, both biodegradation and adsorption were allowed to occur, while during the second run biodegradation was inhibited by NaN 3 . BIT and MIT toxicity was assessed considering i) bioassays with Raphidocelis subcapitata (ISO 8692:2012) and Aliivibrio fischeri (ISO 11348:2007) ; ii) respirometric tests associated to bacteria and protozoa count. Experiments were conducted artificially contaminating aliquots of digestate with increasing concentrations of Salmonella sp. and Escherichia coli. Microbiological analyses were performed on the samples and the potential reduction of fecal bacterial indicators was investigated. Moreover, hypothesizing the synergic effect of digestate biomass in the reduction of pathogenic flora, we carried out the preliminary characterization of the microbial community during mesophilic fermentation of sewage sludge. The study area was monitored sampling water, sediment and benthic organisms along some transects nearby the discharge and from an uncontaminated area having similar characteristics. Samples were assessed under a chemical and ecotoxicological viewpoints. Toxicity tests were performed considering whole sediment and elutriates (solid to liquid ratio of 1:4) including Alivibrio fischeri (ISO 11348-3:2007) and Phaeodactylum tricornutum (ISO 10253: 2016). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa; ATCC 9027) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strain isolated from ocular swab were tested. Quantification of biofilm was done using microtiter plate assay. One multipurpose CL-care solutions was examined for its ability to remove and inhibit biofilm. Also two natural extracts having antibacterial activity and are safe on eye were tested for their anti-biofilm activity. Determination of fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated. The study group comprised 551 births of both born alive and nonalive children from pregnancies of mothers residing in the extra-urbanexposed area, conceived during a 40-week period during which the highest peak of the fire might has influenced a pregnancy. We compared birth outcomes (gestational age < 37 and < 32 weeks, low birth weight, very low birth weight and small for gestational age) of the study group with those of a reference group of women residing in areas of Sicily with similarly low population density and industrial development. We conducted a review of the current literature by an initial database research of papers published since 1990. Three independent reviewers selected relevant articles, initially based on title and abstract analysis, then by full text in order to make a final determination. After the final selection, a total of 38 articles were reviewed. The Community of Sant'Egidio together with the UOSD "Migrant Health Unit "of ASL Roma1, since 2016, has established a program aimed to improve health outcomes in HTR urban population We retrospectively enrolled patients admitted to our hospital between January 2012 and December 2018, with a microbiologically proven diagnosis of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease, and whose biological specimen had been processed in the Laboratory of Microbiology and Virology of Foundation. We used data from 69 Italian women with a history of stage I-III breast cancer diagnosis who underwent surgery. The recruitment was supported by A.N.D.O.S. Onlus. Adherence to Mediterranean diet (MD) was evaluated by the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Assessment Tool. QoL was assessed using the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Quality of Life Questionnaire Breast Cancer Module 23 (QLQ-BR23). Next, a literature search was conducted in the PubMed-Medline and Web of Science databases using the following terms: "Breast Cancer" AND "Quality of Life" AND "Diet". We used data prospectively collected from patients who underwent kidney transplantation from 2000 to 2012. All transplantation procedures were performed by the same surgical team using a standard technique. For each patient we collected the following characteristics: age, gender, cause of ESRD, neoplasia, date and cause of death and postoperative complications (i.e. cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, infectious and metabolic). The Chi-squared test was performed to compare categorical variables using SPSS software. A systematic review of the literature was carried out in MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and CINHAL including RCTs, before-after and quasi-experimental studies. We used PICO strategy and PRISMA statement. Methodological quality of the studies was assessed using Cochrane tools.
