MuLV proviral clone. The full-length MuLV Moloney strain proviral clone pNCA (31) (GenBank accession number AF033811.1) was a kind gift of S. P. Goff, Columbia University. Plasmids. Site-directed mutagenesis of the MuLV readthrough signal was carried out in plasmid pING14.2/XhoI, a variant of pING14.2 (32) containing a unique XhoI site in the polylinker region. A 2,709-bp XhoI/ SalI fragment from pNCA, encompassing the MuLV gag-pol overlap region (genomic coordinates 2009 to 4718), was cloned into SalI-and XhoI-digested pING14.2/XhoI and subjected to PCR mutagenesis. Subsequently, 1,121-bp BclI/XhoI fragments from this plasmid were inserted into BclI/XhoI-digested pNCA to generate the pNCA series of virus mutants. The same strategy was used to generate a virus lacking protease activity (substitution of Asp for Asn at the PR active site) and truncated in Pol (introduction of an optimal premature stop codon, UAAA [underlined] ). This virus (PrϪ TAAA) expresses an unprocessed Gag-Pol polyprotein of 90 kDa. For assessment of readthrough efficiencies in transfected tissue culture cells, the dual-luciferase readthrough reporter vector pDluc was employed (a kind gift of M. Howard, University of Utah) (33) . DNA fragments of 100 bp spanning the MuLV readthrough region and flanked by XhoI and BglII restriction sites were derived by PCR amplification and ligated into appropriately cleaved pDluc vector. All sequences were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Readthrough assays in tissue culture cells. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum (DMEM-FCS). Cells were seeded in dishes of a 24-well plate and grown for 16 h until 80% confluence was reached. Plasmids were transfected using a commercial liposome method (TransIT-LT1; Mirus). Transfection mixtures (containing plasmid DNA, serum-free medium [Opti-MEM; Gibco-BRL], and liposomes) were set up as recommended by the manufacturer and added dropwise to the tissue culture cell growth medium. The cells were harvested at 24 h posttransfection (hpt), and reporter gene expression was determined using a dual-luciferase assay system kit (Promega). Values for readthrough efficiency were calculated by dividing the expression ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase (Fluc/Rluc) of the samples by the Fluc/Rluc ratio of the in-frame control. Statistical analysis was performed using methods described by Jacobs and Dinman (34) . Virus assays. MuLV replication was assessed by transfection of proviral clone constructs and subsequent infection of Rat2 cells with virions released from transfected cells. 293T monolayers at 40% confluence were prepared in six-well plates and transfected with pNCA or a mutant derivative. To assess virus production efficiency, cells were harvested at 72 hpt and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for viral proteins. A cellular protein (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH]) was used as a loading control. Tissue culture supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-m-pore-size filter prior to infection of fresh monolayers or biochemical analysis. Filtered supernatant (500 l) from transfected cells was added directly to six-well plates of Rat2 monolayers at 10% confluence and incubated for 1 h at 37°C, and the volume was adjusted to 3 ml with fresh medium (DMEM with 2% FCS) in the presence of 30 g/l of DEAE-dextran hydrochloride (Sigma). Cells were incubated at 37°C and 10% CO 2 for 4 days. Cells were harvested directly in Laemmli's sample buffer, and proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Viral supernatant was sterile filtered and used for protein and RNA analysis. Immunoblotting. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. These were blocked for 30 to 60 min with 5% powdered milk (Marvel) in PBST (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1.5 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 6.7, and 0.1% Tween 20) and probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-MuLV p30 (ab130757; Abcam) (1:2,000 in Marvel-PBST) and monoclonal mouse anti-GAPDH (G8795; Sigma-Aldrich) (1:20,000 in Marvel-PBST). Membranes were incubated in the dark with an IRDye-conjugated secondary antibody in PBST (IRDye 800CW donkey anti-rabbit IgG HϩL and IRDye 680RD goat antimouse IgM [ chain specific]). Blots were scanned, and bands were quantified using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor) . Dot blot assays. Filtered supernatants from transfections were serially diluted 2-fold and applied to a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-washed nitrocellulose filter in duplicate using a Minifold Micro-Sample Filtration Manifold (Schleicher & Schuell). Samples were allowed to bind; they were washed twice with PBST and blocked, probed, and quantified as described above. Reverse transcriptase assays. Filtered supernatants from transfections were serially diluted 2-fold in DMEM containing 10% FCS. Supernatant (5 l) was mixed with 20 l of gammaretroviral RT assay buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 8.3), 0.6 mM MnCl 2 , 60 mM NaCl, 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.05% (vol/vol) NP-40, 10 g/ml poly(A), 5 g/ml oligo(dT), 10 M dTTP, 8 Ci of [␣-32 P]dTTP] and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Reaction mixture aliquots (5 l, in triplicate) were pipetted onto DE81 paper in grid formation and allowed to dry. The DE81 paper was washed in 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer (four times for 5 min each), water (two times for 1 min each) and 100% ethanol (1 min) and allowed to dry completely before exposure to X-ray film. Incorporation of [␣-32 P]dTTP was quantified by phosphorimaging. TCID 50 assays. Virus replication was assessed using a 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) assay. One day prior to infection, Rat2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 4 ϫ 10 3 cells/well in a final volume of 100 l/well. Sterile-filtered supernatant was harvested at 72 hpt from a sixwell plate transfected with a pNCA derivative plasmid, and the supernatant was serially diluted 10-fold in DMEM (supplemented with 2% FCS and 30 g/ml DEAE-dextran hydrochloride). An aliquot of each diluted sample (100 l/well) was added to each of five wells of a 96-well plate containing Rat2 cells seeded as above. At 3 days postinfection (dpi), the culture medium was replaced with 100 l of Opti-MEM, and the cells were stained 12 h later. For staining, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed/permeabilized in methanol-acetone (1:1) for 30 min. After two further washes with PBS, nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST for 30 min. Cells were probed with anti-MuLV p30 antibody (1:2,000 in BSA-PBST; 50 l for 1 h at room temperature), washed, and incubated with a fluorescent secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG [A-11011; Invitrogen]; 1:1,000 in PBST, 1 h at room temperature). Staining was visualized using an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope. Wells containing any brightly staining cells were scored as infected. Experiments were conducted using duplicate biological repeats, each diluted in parallel and used to infect five rows of wells. For each biological repeat, the 50% endpoint titer was calculated according to the method of Reed and Muench (35) . Generation of silenced Rat2 cells. eRF1 and eRF3 short hairpin (sh) oligonucleotides with 19-nucleotide-long targeting sequences were cloned in pRETRO-SUPER (Netherlands Cancer Institute/Antonie van Leeuwenhoek Hospital), previously digested with BglII and HindIII, to yield pRETRO-SUPER-eRF1 and pRETRO-SUPER-eRF3. These plasmids, and an empty plasmid as a control, were transfected using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus) into packaging cell line 293T, with pCLanfo as a helper plasmid. pRETRO-SUPER expresses a transcript containing the viral packaging signal, the H1-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) cassette, and the puromycin resistance gene. At 48 h posttransfection, supernatant was collected, filtered (0.45-m pore size), and used to infect Rat2 cells three times over a 24-h period, with addition of Polybrene (at 4 g/ml). Transduced cells were selected and cultured in the presence of puromycin (at 2 g/ml). Isolation and sequence of RNA from released virions. Culture medium (1 ml) was sterile filtered and incubated for 30 min at 37°C with 5 l of Turbo DNase I (Ambion), followed by the inactivation of the enzyme by the addition of 15 mM EDTA. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 154,000 ϫ g for 1 h at 4°C, and the pellet was gently resuspended in 100 l of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, and 100 g of proteinase K and incubated for 30 min at 37°C, followed by phenolchloroform extraction. Ten microliters of sample was reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus RT (Promega); the resulting cDNA was PCR amplified and cloned into the pGEM-T-Easy Vector (Promega) before individual clones were selected for sequencing.
