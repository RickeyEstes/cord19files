Unadjusted analyses for categorical data were done using Pearson c 2 test, and for continuous data using Kruskal-Wallis test. Multivariable analyses were done using binary logistic and Cox regression and the results were presented as odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs), respectively, with 95% confidence intervals. The potential confounding factors were first tested in unadjusted analyses. The nonviral factors were then selected by the backwards stepwise method, and variables with P less than .05 were included in the final adjusted models. The tested variables were age at index hospitalization (<12 vs !12 months), sex, parental history of asthma, gestational weeks at birth (<37 vs !37 weeks), comorbid medical disorders, history of wheezing, history of atopic dermatitis, siblings, exposure to smoking during pregnancy or early childhood, breastfeeding, length of index hospitalization greater than or equal to 3 days, use of systemic corticosteroids during index hospitalization (yes vs no), and study center (Turku, Tampere vs Kuopio). Analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 24.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY).
