There are multiple methods for delivering course content. This section examines specific instructional methods and strategies that may have an impact on course outcomes. Short video/computer self-instruction (with minimal or no instructor coaching) that includes synchronous hands-on practice in BLS can be considered as an effective alternative to instructor-led courses. AED use should not be restricted to trained personnel. Allowing the use of AEDs by persons without prior formal training can be beneficial and may be lifesaving. Because even brief training improves performance (e.g., speed of use, correct pad placement), it is recommended that training in the use of AEDs be provided. Laypersons can serve as AED instructors. Short video/computer self-instruction (with minimal or no instructor coaching) that includes synchronous hands-on practice in AED use may be considered as an effective alternative to instructor-led AED courses. CPR prompt/feedback devices may be considered during CPR training for laypersons and healthcare providers. CPR prompt/feedback devices may be considered for clinical use as part of an overall strategy to improve the quality of CPR. Instructors and rescuers should be made aware that a compressible support surface (e.g., mattress) may cause a feedback device to overestimate depth of compression. Specific teamwork training, including leadership skills, should be included in ALS courses. There is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific training intervention, compared with traditional lecture/practice sessions, to improve learning, retention, and use of ALS skills. There is insufficient evidence to recommend teaching a specific technique to optimise complete chest recoil during actual CPR. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of more realistic techniques (e.g., high-fidelity manikins, in situ training) to improve outcomes (e.g., skills performance on a manikin, skills performance in a real arrest, willingness to perform) when compared with standard training (e.g., low-fidelity manikins, education center) in BLS and ALS courses.
