Identification of new reference genes using RT-qPCR methodology for gene normalisation was not successful at identifying new reference genes with increased stability. NCK2 was determined to be the least stably expressed gene in synovium and fat pad, and one of the four least stably expressed genes in cruciate ligament and cartilage. TRAPPC2L was not identified as being stably expressed in any tissue using the geNorm algorithm, and was not ranked higher than the 8 th most stably expressed gene in any tissue using the NormFinder algorithm.
