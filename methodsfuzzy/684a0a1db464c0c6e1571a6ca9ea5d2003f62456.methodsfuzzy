Patient samples. In total, five patients diagnosed with CTEPH (male, 2; female, 3; mean age, 38.2 years; age range, 17-52 years) who had been referred to Beijing Chaoyang Hospital (Capital Medical University, Beijing, China) were recruited to the study. The study was approved by the relevant ethics committee of Beijing Chaoyang University. All the patients provided informed written consent prior to participation in the study. Pulmonary angiography and right heart catheterization were used in the diagnosis of CTEPH and determination of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics (16) . Mean pulmonary artery pressure >25 mmHg at rest or >30 mmHg during exercise was considered to indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and the six-minute walk test (6-MWT) were hemodynamic variables applied to assess the cardiopulmonary function and prognosis of the CTEPH patients. At inclusion, all the patients received oral anticoagulants for a minimum of 6 months and underwent PEA in accordance with the guidelines of the Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital (Beijing, China). In addition, healthy control samples were obtained from five lung transplant donors. The control subjects and patients were matched according to age and gender. Written informed consent was obtained from the healthy controls or their families.
