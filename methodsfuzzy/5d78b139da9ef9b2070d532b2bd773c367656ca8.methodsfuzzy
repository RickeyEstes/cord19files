Cell lines and viruses. LLC-MK2 rhesus monkey kidney epithelial cells (ATCC catalog no.CCL-7), A549 human type II alveolar cells (ATCC catalog no. CCL-185), and wild-type, Ddx58 Ϫ/Ϫ (RIG-I Ϫ/Ϫ ) and Mavs Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs (kindly provided by J. Kagan and J. Chen) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, and 50 mg/ml gentamicin or penicillin and streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). TC-1 mouse lung epithelial cells (ATCC catalog no.CRL-2785) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 2 mM nonessential amino acids, 10 mM HEPES, and 50 mg/ml gentamicin or penicillin and streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). All cell lines were treated with mycoplasma removal agent (MP Biomedicals) before use. SeV Cantell HD and LD (SeV HD, high DVG particle content; SeV LD and 52, low DVG particle content) were prepared in embryonated chicken eggs as described previously (25) . Influenza A/PR8/34 virus (IAV) was grown in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (Specific-Pathogen-Free Avian Supplies, Charles River Laboratories) for 40 h at 37°C. Plasmids and constructs. A plasmid expressing DVG-546 flanked at the 3= end by the SpeI-T7 promoter sequence and at the 5= end by the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and the T7 polymerase terminator sequence was prepared as described previously (26) . To generate mutant DVGs, restriction enzyme sites were introduced into the construct with the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). Specifically, DVG-268 was generated by the introduction of 6 nt to generate a KpnI site at position 163 of the DVG-546 sequence. A second KpnI site at position 448 of the wild-type DVG internal sequence allowed the deletion of a 228-nt-long fragment of DVG. DVG-324 and DVG-354 were generated as previously described (26) . DVG-324NC was generated by the introduction of a second KpnI site at position 330 of the DVG-324 sequence, allowing the deletion of a 100-nt-long fragment between positions 230 and 330 of the DVG-324 sequence. Motif DVG 70-114 and DVG 5-51 deletions, single-nucleotide swaps (T106G, A89U, C97G), and nucleotides additions (motif1ϩ) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II XL; Agilent Technologies). For nucleotide swaps, primers introduced a T/G mutation at position 89, 97, or 106 of the DVG-268 sequence. Motif1ϩ includes an A insertion after position 78 and a T insertion after position 104 of the DVG-324NC sequence. For the sequences of all of the mutagenesis primers used, see Table S1 in the supplemental material. Poly(U/UC) and X region plasmids were kindly provided by M. Gale, Jr. (University of Washington). HCV PAMP preparation and manipulation. DNA sequences bearing poly(U/UC) or the X region were amplified by PCR (for the sequences of the primers used, see Table S1 in the supplemental material) with a highfidelity polymerase (Invitrogen). X region mutants bearing DVG motifs were constructed by adding DVG motifs at the 3= end of the molecule by PCR with the primers shown in Table S1 . The resulting PCR products were gel purified (Qiagen) and subjected to in vitro transcription as described below. ivtDVG preparation. DVG-expressing plasmids were linearized and in vitro transcribed with the MEGAscript T7 kit (Ambion) in the presence of RNase inhibitor (Fermentas). RNA products were treated with DNase and then precipitated with LiCl. The optical density at 260 nm (OD 260 )/ OD 280 ratios of all ivtDVGs were between 2.00 and 2.25, and the OD 260 / OD 230 ratios were between 2.20 and 2.60. Purified PCR products were used for in vitro transcription of poly(U/UC) or X region RNA with the MEGAscript T7 kit (Ambion) in the presence of RNase inhibitor (Fermentas). RNA treatments and transfection. To remove 5=-triphosphates, 1 g of ivtDVG RNA was incubated with 10 U of alkaline phosphatase (AP; Thermo Scientific) for 60 min at 37°C. To cleave ssRNA, 1 g of RNA was incubated with 1 ng of RNase A (Ambion) for 15 min at room temperature. To cleave dsRNA, it was incubated with 0.1 U of RNase V1 (Ambion) for 15 min at room temperature. After treatment, the RNA was purified with TRIzol or precipitation/inactivation buffer according to the manufacturer's specifications. AP and RNase dual treatment was accomplished by incubating AP-treated ivtDVG with RNases by using the protocol described above. Prior to transfection, RNAs were heated at 65°C for 5 min, cooled to room temperature for 5 min, and then chilled on ice to promote proper folding of the molecules before transfection into cells. A 4.15-pmol portion of the structured RNA was transfected into 2.5 ϫ 10 5 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). As controls, cells were transfected with an equally molarity of high-molecular-weight poly (I:C) (InvivoGen). Rescue of recombinant virus. BSR-T7 cells were infected with partially inactivated SeV 52 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of approximately 60 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID 50 )/cell for 1 h. Infected cells were transfected with 3 g of a plasmid encoding DVG with the XtremeGENE transfection reagent (Roche). Cells and supernatant were harvested after 48 h, and 200 l of the suspension was inoculated into the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. After 40 h, allantoic fluid was harvested and egg inoculation was repeated for up to three consecutive passages. The presence of defective viral genome rDVG-324 and rDVG-354 in recombinant virus stock was verified by PCR with a primer specific for each mutant DVG. The relative copy number of DVG RNA presented in each mutant virus upon infection was determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) with DVG Comp primer (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). In silico secondary structure prediction. DVG RNA folding was predicted by the RNAfold server from the ViennaRNA package v.2.1.8 (University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/ RNAfold.cgi) (46) . For analysis, default parameters were applied for minimum free energy (MFE) and partition functions fold algorithms (Turner 2004 model). The optimal secondary structure with MFE of the thermodynamic ensemble is shown for each DVG RNA prediction. RT-qPCR. Reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR was performed as previously described (24) . Briefly, 1 g of RNA was reverse transcribed with the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems). qPCRs were performed with SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) in an Applied Biosystems ViiA 7 Real-time PCR System. For the primers used, see Table S2 in the supplemental material. RNA FISH and IFA. Probes complementary to the positive-sense strand of the SeV genome were designed against the full-length genome (from position 1 to position 11630), excluding the 5= end that encompasses the DVG sequence. A pool of 32 oligonucleotides targeting the positive-sense SeV genome was designed as previously described (47) . These probes recognize the positive-sense viral genome, as well as all virus-encoded mRNAs. For probes identifying DVGs, a pool of 15 singlestranded, 20-nt-long oligonucleotides specific for the 3= end of the positive-sense SeV genome (from position 14965 to position 15416) which covers the DVG sequences was designed by the same methods. These probes bind to DVGs, viral L protein mRNA, and the positive-sense SeV genome. In both pools, oligonucleotides were complementary to a different region of the target RNA, with no fewer than two bases separating any two oligonucleotides. SeV genome probes were labeled with Quasar 570, and DVG probes were labeled with Quasar 670 (Biosearch Technologies). Since L protein mRNA and the positive-sense SeV genome are recognized by both set of probes, pixels containing both colors were considered a SeV genome/protein representation. Pixels stained only with Quasar 670 (pseudocolored green) represent positive-sense DVGs. For combined FISH and immunofluorescence assay (IFA), cells were plated onto plain glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific) at a density of 1 ϫ 10 6 cells/ well and grown overnight at 37°C. RNA FISH was performed according to published protocols, with minor modifications (48) . At different times after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were then permeabilized with 70% ethanol for 1 h at room temperature. Permeabilized cells were incubated with anti-human IRF3 antibody (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz), followed by Alexa Fluor 594labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500 dilution; Invitrogen) diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in the presence of 40 U/ml RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen). Stained cells were incubated in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min prior to FISH, washed with PBS, and then equilibrated in wash buffer containing 10% formamide and 2ϫ saline sodium citrate (SSC [1ϫ SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate]). FISH was performed by hybridizing fixed cells with 10 nM probes diluted in hybridization buffer consisting of 10% formamide, 2ϫ SSC, and 10% (wt/vol) dextran sulfate. Hybridization was performed overnight in a humidified chamber at 37°C. Imaging acquisition was performed with a Nikon E600 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 100ϫ, 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective (Zeiss) and a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera. FISH-IFA image quantification. Imaging quantification was performed with the Volocity Quantitation module (PerkinElmer) (49) . Exposure time, gain, and offset were held constant for all images. The fluo-rescent signal from the nuclei of cells was selected by drawing a region of interest (ROI) around each nucleus. The fluorescent signal of the positivesense DVG was determined by drawing an ROI around the entire cell and using the procedure described above. The average ROI intensity of IRF3 and positive-sense DVG signals in mock-infected cells was measured and used as a reference to set the threshold for defining nuclear IRF3 and positive-sense DVG-positive cells. Nuclear IRF3-positive cells among positive-sense DVG-positive populations were identified by performing "intersect module," while the nuclear IRF3-positive cells among positivesense DVG-negative populations were identified by using the "exclude touching" module. For the analysis, at least 250 cells were quantified in each experimental group through three independent experiments. EMSA. The RIG-I deltaCARD and MDA5 deltaCARD proteins (RIG-I or MDA5 without the two N-terminal CARDs) were kindly provided by Sun Hur (Harvard, Boston, MA) and were prepared as described elsewhere (35) . EMSA was performed by incubating ivtDVG RNA with 1 g or the indicated amount of RIG-I deltaCARD or MDA5 deltaCARD protein in buffer A (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM dithiothreitol) for 15 min at 37°C, and the complexes were resolved by 4 to 12% Bis-Tris NativePAGE (Bio-Rad). Gels were stained with SYBR gold (Life Technologies), and fluorescent gel images were recorded and analyzed with the Gel Doc XRϩ imaging system (Bio-Rad). ELISA. IFN-␤ in the supernatant of ivtDVG RNA-transfected TC-1 cells was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (PBL Assay Science). Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A statistically significant difference was defined as a P value of Ͻ0.05 by either one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Student's t test with or without a post hoc test, as indicated in each figure legend, on the basis of the specific data set.
