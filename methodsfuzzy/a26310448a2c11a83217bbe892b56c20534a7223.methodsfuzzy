Study population. This study was reviewed and approved by Ethics Committees in Ministry of Health of Vietnam as well as International Medical Center of Japan. Out of 62 cases fulfilling the World Health Organization case definition of probable SARS [18] , five cases died, three were not Vietnamese, such that they were excluded from this study. In the remaining 54, written informed consent was obtained from 44 individuals, who were enrolled in this study as cases. Furthermore, 103 staff members who came in contact with SARS patients in the hospital A without development of SARS, and 50 individuals reflecting general Vietnamese population who had no contact history participated in this study. Peripheral blood sample of all the subjects was taken, blood cells were separated from plasma by centrifuge method, and genomic DNA was subsequently extracted by a method described elsewhere [19] . Genotyping of ACE I/D polymorphism. ACE I/D genotype was determined by three-primer polymerase chain reaction amplification method that was described previously [20] . Briefly, primers ACE1 and ACE3 were chosen outside the insertion sequence and another primer ACE2 was placed on the insertion sequence. Reactions were performed with 25 pmol of each primer ACE1 and ACE3, and with 7.5 pmol of primer ACE2 in a final volume of 25 ll, containing 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.001% (W/V) of gelatin, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, and 1 U Taq polymerase (AmpriTaq Gold DNA polymerase, Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide sequences of primers were as follows: ACE1: 5 0 -CATC CTTTCTCCCATTTCTC-3 0 , ACE2: 5 0 -TGGGATTACAGGCGTGA TACAG-3 0 , and ACE3: 5 0 -ATTTCAGAGCTGGAATAAAATT-3 0 . After the initial denaturation at 94°C for 10 min, the reaction mixture was subjected to 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min and 55°C for 1 min. This method yields amplification products of 84 bp for the D allele and 65 bp for the I allele, and products were electrophoresed and visualized on 4% agarose gels with ethidium bromide. Clinical profiles and backgrounds of the subjects. Clinical profiles and backgrounds of all subjects were extracted from medical records and questionnaires taken by trained interviewers. Information about age, sex, degree of contacts with SARS patients, and requirement of supplementary oxygen was obtained. Chest radiographs of SARS cases on the acute phase were also available. Entire lung field on the chest Xray films was divided into six zones, which were right upper, middle, and lower zones and left upper, middle, and lower zones. The number of affected zones on the film where the lung is most severely inflamed during the clinical course was counted in each case. Two different chest physicians judged the number of involved zones in the entire lung field independently. Statistical analysis. Disease associations were assessed by the v 2 test. Inter-observer variability for the number of involved zones in the lung was assessed with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of hypoxemia or progression of SARS. The p values less than 0.05 were considered significant in all the tests and data analysis was carried out using the SAS system for Windows version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
