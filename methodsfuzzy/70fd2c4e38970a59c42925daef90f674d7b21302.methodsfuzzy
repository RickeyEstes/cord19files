We conducted a systematic literature review, using Embase, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed, supplemented by Thomson-Reuters ''Web of Science''Ã” (all databases), to identify peer-reviewed published articles on MERS-CoV available by July 14, 2017. All searches were for articles published from 2012 onward, since MERS was first identified in 2012. The following search terms were used in all the databases for matches in title only (Google Scholar), title or abstract (Embase and MEDLINE/PubMed), or topic (''Web of Science''): ''novel coronavirus,'' ''novel coronavirus EMC,'' ''novel coronavirus Erasmus,'' ''hCoV-EMC,'' ''MERS-CoV'' (a PubMed ''MeSH'' term) , ''MERS coronavirus,'' ''Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,'' and ''Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus'' (a PubMed MeSH term) . We reviewed the titles and abstracts of all resulting citations to identify relevant articles for this systematic review, following PRISMA guidelines (Fig. 2) (Moher et al. 2009 ). For all nonduplicate articles, excluding opinion and editorial pieces, on MERS-CoV or a related topic, we retrieved the full-text version and indexed the citation. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed primary research articles about MERS-CoV published between 2012 and mid-July 2017 (inclusive, with periodic updates to 2018) and adding unique information about MERS-CoV to the knowledge base within at least one of the four key themes: (1) virology; (2) clinical characteristics, outcomes, and therapeutic and preventive options; (3) epidemiology and transmission; and (4) animal interface and search for natural hosts of MERS-CoV. Only English language publications (or with an Englishlanguage abstract available) were included. Of the 3364 titles retrieved, 407 were unique (nonduplicate), scientific research works relevant to MERS-CoV, and of these, 208 were originally included in the review based on the inclusion criteria (some interim updates have been made during article preparation).
