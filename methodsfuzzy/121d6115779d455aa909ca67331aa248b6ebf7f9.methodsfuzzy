RNAs that were selected by oligo (dT)-cellulose column Viruses and cells chromatography were used (Makino et al., 1984) . The nylon filter was soaked in a prehybridization buffer, and The plaque-cloned A59 strain of MHV (MHV-A59) (Lai et al., 1981) was used as a helper virus. Mouse DBT Northern blot hybridization was performed (Jeong and Makino, 1992) . The 32 P-labeled probes were prepared by cells (Hirano et al., 1974) were used for growth of viruses. a random-priming procedure (Sambrook et al., 1989) . For the densitometric analysis, autoradiograms were scanned using a scanner (RELI 4816 scanner, Relysis) and the intensity of each band was quantitated using Scan Analysis program (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).
