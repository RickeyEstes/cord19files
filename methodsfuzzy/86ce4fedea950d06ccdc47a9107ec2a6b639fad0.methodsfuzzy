For centuries humans have attempted to control the spread of airborne infectious disease by suppressing bioaerosol mobility (Figure 3 ). During The Great Plague outbreak in medieval Italy, forced quarantine involved sequestering every family containing a diseaseinfected individual outside the city walls (http://msnbc.msn.com/ id/3076745). During the influenza pandemic of 1918, gauze masks became required in some places and not wearing one was a fineable offense [30] . Perhaps the most concrete evidence demonstrating the relevance of expired bioaerosols as a source of transmission of infectious disease lies in the success of infection-control strategies that target airborne particles, such as ventilation, filtration and particulate respirators, or strategies that target the airborne pathogens within the particles, such as air disinfection and UV irradiation. These strategies have had varying degrees of success. To be effective, the infection control methods previously discussed require costly mechanical equipment (i.e. ventilation and disinfection strategies) or properly fitted respirators for each individual who might be exposed. All of these methods need routine maintenance and, thus, knowledgeable personnel to be available. These factors make the current control methods too costly or impractical to be implemented effectively; this is especially true in developing countries where resources are scarce. In addition, these strategies rely on trapping airborne pathogenic bioaerosols before they can enter a new host, relying on the expectation that pathogens will be in the environment for some time. Therefore, the possibility of preventing pathogen output at the source with an inexpensive, easy-to-administer aerosol would be an appealing solution.
