Cell cultures. --BEK-1 cells were grown as described previously (lnaba et al., 1976) . The growth medium used was Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB), 10% calf serum and antibiotics~ and the maintenance medium was MEM containing 10% TPB, 0.05% yeast extract, 0.5% sodium glutamate, 0.7t% glucose and antibiotics. Viruses. --The calf diarrhea coronavirus , passaged in cultures of bovine embryonic kidney cells, was kindly supplied by Dr C.A. Mebus, University of Nebraska. The virus was passaged twice in calf kidney cell cultures and five times in BEK-1 cell cultures in our laboratory (Inaba et al., 1976) before use in the present study. Strain BF!I of bovine enterovirus (BE virus) (Inaba et al., 1962) and st, rain Los Angeles of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus were also used for comparison. All these viruses were grown in BEK-1 cell cultures and the supematant fluid o~ infected cul. tures was used as seed virus in the present study. Infectivity assay. --Serial dilutions of the viral mate]Sal were made with maintenance medium and each dilution was inoculated in 0.1-ml amounts into three tubes of BEK-1 cell culture. After virus adsorption at 37 Â° C for I h, the inoculated cultures had 0.5-ml amounts of malntec~ance medium added and were then incubated at 34*C in a roller drum for ~i days. The titer was expressed in 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCIDs0) per 0.1 ml. Hemagglutination (HA). --HA titer was measured by the method described previously (Sato et al., 1977) and was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest antigen dilution which showed complete hem~,~glutination.
