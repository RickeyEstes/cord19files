Rats. Lewis female (RT') rats, which were corona virus free and 1, 3, or 6 mo of age, or neonatally thymectomized Lewis female rats, were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories, (Wilmington, MA) and kept in sterile microisolator cages. TotalBody Irradiation. Lewis rats were irradiated on day -1 with 1,050 rads at 108 rads/min from a dual source is7Cs small animal irradiator (Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., Kanata, Ontario, Canada). Bone Marrow Transplantation. Donor viral-free Lewis rats were killed by C02 asphyxiation . Marrow was collected from the femurs, tibia, and humeri in RPMI 1640. The marrow cells were adjusted to a concentration of 6 x 10' nucleated cells/ml, and were infused into recipient animals by intravenous injection into the dorsal tail vein on day 0. The total volume injected was 1 ml . Antibiotics. Rats received medicated drinking water supplemented with bactrim, neomycin, and polymyxin B, as previously described (6) . CsA. CsA was the generous gift of Sandoz Ltd., Basel, Switzerland. The powdered CsA was dissolved in 95% ethanol and added to a 5% Emulphor solution in deionized Ha0. Rats were weighed daily and received 1 ml/100 g subcutaneously from the day of marrow infusion for 30 consecutive days. The total dose of CsA per day per rat was either 15, 10, 5, or 1 mg/kg. Control animals received the identical quantities of the drug diluent (ethanol, 5% emulphor, HZO) without CsA. Assessment of SGVHD Rats were examined daily for signs of clinical GVHD . Ear biopsies were taken at frequent intervals. Initial onset of SGVHD occurred within 7-14 d after discontinuation of CsA therapy and was presented as an acute GVHD with erythema and dermatitis (9) . Within 2 wk after onset, the disease progressed to a more chronic type of GVHD with alopecia and fibrosis (9) . Animals were followed 6-8 wk after discontinuation of CsA therapy to assess either a delayed appearance of disease, resolution of disease, or progression and development of extensive disease. Upon the development of chronic disease, the animals were killed. Previously described criteria were used for histologic documentation of GVHD (15) . Acute SGVHD was defined by the presence of dyskeratotic cells and vacuolar degeneration lymphocytic exocytosis, epidermal destruction with vascular changes of the basal layer, dyskeratotic cells, and lymphocytec dermal, and/or epidermal infiltration . Animals with extensive disease were killed and autopsies were performed. The skin, tongue, liver, intestine, and spleen were histologically examined for the presence of GVHD . Histological examination and diagnosis of SGVHD were performed by an observer blinded to experimental protocol . Cell Separation. Counterflow centrifugation elutriation was used to separate bone marrow cells on the basis of cell size and density. As previously described (16), this technique allows the separation 86 of relatively distinct cell populations and enriches for the lymphocytes contained in marrow. Briefly, 0.4-1 x 10' bone marrow cells suspended in 5-10 ml of elutriation medium (0 .9% saline, 0.5% BSA, 0.3 mM EDTA, pH 7.20) were injected into the inlet stream leading into theJ6M centrifuge equipped with a JE-6B elutriator rotor and standard chamber (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). The cells were loaded into the chamber at a flow rate of 15 ml/min, a rotor speed of 3,000 RPM (900 g), and a temperature of 18°C. Rotor speed was held constant and the cells were eluted by changing the flow rate. In the case of rat bone marrow (17), lymphocytes were purged at a flow rate of 25 ml/min (400-ml collection), and intermediate sized cells at 29 ml/min (200 ml). Cells still remaining in the elutriator chamber were collected by continuing medium flow after stopping the rotor, and were designated the rotor-off (R/0) fraction . The cells were then washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 . mAh Murine antibodies directed against rat lymphocyte determinants were purchased from Serotec Bioproducts for Science, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). The specific mAb from ascites fluid used in our studies consisted of OX19 (panspecific for rat T lymphocytes), W3/25 (specific for rat Th cells), OX8 (identifies the rat nonTh cell subset), OX7, (detects the Thy-1.1 antigen), andOX33 (specific for the K L chain) . Immunomagnetic Separation. Bone marrow cells from normal animals were first separated by counterflow centrifugation elutriation (CCE) and then depleted of specific subsets by immunologic separation using immunomagnetic beads coated commercially with covalently bound, affinity-purified (Fc-specific) sheep polyclonal Ig against mouse IgG1 subclass (Dynabeads; Dynal Inc., Great Neck, NY) as previously described (12) . Briefly, 5 x 10' cells were incubated with saturating concentrations of primary antibody for 30 min at 4°C. At the end of the incubation, the supernatant was removed and the cells were thoroughly washed with PBS and 0.5% BSA three times. The cells were then incubated with the microspheres (one cell/five beads) for 30 min at 4°C on a hematology mixer. To remove the unbound cells from the suspension, the tube was held near a magnetic particle concentrator (P & S Biochemical, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for a few minutes, and then the nonadherent population was removed with a Pasteur pipet. The positively selected cells were complexed to the microspheres localized by the magnetic fluid. Flow MicroJiuorimetry Analysis. After each type of cell separation listed above, the depleted populations were stained with an FITC conjugate o£ the primary antibody used for depletion, an FITC conjugate of the mAb to the reciprocal subset, or an isotypespecific FITC sheep anti-mouse IgG to detect residual cells coated with the primary antibody used in selection. The single immunofluorescence was analyzed on a FACScan analytical scanner (Hewlett-Packard Co., No Alto, CA). The negatively selected populations were less than 5% contaminated by the depleted cell subset on average. StatisticalAnalysis. Results were analyzed by multivariate analysis or by the Xa test .
