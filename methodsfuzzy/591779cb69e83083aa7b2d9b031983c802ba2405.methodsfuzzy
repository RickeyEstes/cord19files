From October 2010 to June 2011, 69 patients in the acute phase of KD were admitted to the Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. We collected nasopharyngeal swab samples from 55 of these patients. Parents of the remaining 14 patients refused participation. Among 55 subjects, 48 (87.3%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for KD 6) , and 7 (12.7%) were diagnosed with incomplete KD. Diagnostic criteria of KD were fever, defined as body temperature above than 38°C persisting ≥5 days, and a presence of ≥4 principal featureschanges in extremities, polymorphous exanthema, bilateral bulbar conjunctival injection without exudates, changes in lips and oral cavity, and cervical lymphadenopathy (≥1.5 cm diameter) 6) . Fever duration of 3 or 4 days was permitted on establishing a diagnosis. An incomplete KD was diagnosed in a case with persisting fever and 2 or 3 principal features but without alternative diagnosis. Refractory cases are those in which fever persisted or recurred after 36 hours of initial infusion of immunoglobulin. We recruited 3 age-matched healthy control subjects from a day nursery and a kindergarten for every 2 children with KD within 1 month of the recruitment of patients. Children who have had a fever with respiratory symptoms within the previous month were excluded from the control group. A presentation of significant symptom usually from the respiratory tract infection-rhinorrhea, cough, or sputum was defined as respiratory symptom. Nine of the children with KD were matched with only one control subject due to failure of recruitment (in 7 cases) and loss of samples during processing (in 2 cases). A final group of 78 control subjects were recruited, and samples of nasopharyngeal swab were collected from them. The patients were subdivided into RT-PCR positive and negative groups. Clinical and echocardiographic data during the acute phase of illness were surveyed by review of the medical records. Coronary artery dilatation was defined according to the recommendation by Japanese Ministry of Health 7) . We obtained informed consent from the parents of all 133 subjects, and the Institutional Review Board of the Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, approved this study (2010-0467). Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken by flocked swab and were submitted in Universal Transport Medium (COPAN, Brescia, Italy). Viral RNA was extracted from the swabs with NucliSENS easyMAG (Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). cDNA was synthesized using a Revert Aid First Standard cDNA Synthesis kit (Fermentas, York, UK), and each cDNA preparation was subjected to three sets of multiplex PCR with an RV15 ACE Detection kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). The RV15 ACE Detection kit targets 15 respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, influenza viruses A and B, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, corona viruses OC43/229E and NL63, and enterovirus. This set of 15 respiratory viruses corresponds exactly to the set of viruses causing respiratory infections in Korea that is monitored weekly by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 8) . Diameters of coronary arteries were converted to Z scores by using previously published regression equations 9) . All statistical analyses were performed using SAS ver. 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), and P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. The median value with interquartile range was used to summarize data. Numerical variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables.
