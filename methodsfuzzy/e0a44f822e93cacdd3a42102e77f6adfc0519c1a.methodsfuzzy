Both unbiased NGS, and, to a lesser extent, pan-microbial microarrays are affected by the level of host background, limiting sensitivity for detection of pathogen-derived sequences. In a study using NGS to investigate occult bacterial infection in tissues, microbial sequences were only detected in 0.00067% of NGS reads, corresponding to fewer than 10 per million [80] . Pathogen enrichment or host depletion before microarray and deep sequencing analyses hence becomes critical to maximize sensitivity for identification of novel agents in clinical samples (Figure 1 ). For viruses, capsid purification procedures involving repeated freeze/thaw cycles, filtration, ultracentrifugation, and prenuclease digestion have been developed to enrich host tissues or body fluids for infectious particles [78, 81] . Strategies to deplete the sample of background host DNA can also be implemented, including the use of methylation-specific DNAse to selectively degrade host genomes [82] , removal of host ribosomal RNA [83] , and/or removal of the most abundant host sequences by duplexspecific nuclease (DSN) normalization [84] . Another complementary approach is to perform target enrichment using biotinylated probes to enrich NGS libraries for sequences corresponding to pathogens, akin to now well-established techniques that have been developed in the cancer field [85] . This strategy can also potentially harness prior experience with microarrays for pathogen discovery by the use of previously validated microarray probes to enrich NGS libraries for microbial sequences. The choice of NGS platforms on the market today for pathogen discovery is driven by two main parameters: read length and read depth. NGS reads must be long enough (typically at least 100-300 nt) to unambiguously identify the presence of a novel pathogen, and to discriminate reads from host or background flora. There must also be sufficient read depth, or number of sequence reads generated per run, to detect novel agents with a high degree of sensitivity. For pathogen discovery, the Roche 454 GS-FLX+pyrosequencing ™ platform has been widely applied given the long reads (currently up to 1 million single or paired-end reads with average read lengths of 400-500 nt with the GS-FLX+ Titanium ™ platform) and high accuracy. More recently, Illumina NGS sequencing platforms (GAIIx ™ , HiSeq ™ , and MiSeq ™ ) have been used for pathogen discovery given the ~10-1000× improved read depth relative to 454, resulting in much greater sensitivity for the detection of viruses [86] , and gradually improving read lengths (currently up to 150 nt paired-end reads for the HiSeq and 250 nt paired-end reads for the MiSeq). In fact, previous studies suggest that the limits of detection of viruses in clinical samples by NGS with Illumina sequencing are comparable to specific PCR [51, 86] . The use of paired-end sequencing, or sequencing from each end of the DNA fragment in NGS libraries, can be particularly useful for pathogen discovery given that the forward and reverse reads can facilitate the design of PCR primers to confirm potential sequence 'hits' to novel microbes and de novo genome assembly [87] . Other NGS technologies, such as platforms by Ion Torrent (very fast run times of under three hours) and Pacific Biosciences (very long reads of up to 7 kb; average read lengths 3-4 kb) [88] , have yet to be used widely for pathogen discovery, although one application may be rapid genome sequencing of emerging pathogens such as Escherichia coli O104:H4, associated with a recent foodborne outbreak of hemolytic-uremic syndrome in Germany [89, 90] . One particular concern for all unbiased NGS technologies is the high potential for reagent and laboratory contamination, especially with the use of universal amplification methods [51, 86, 91] .
