Descriptive statistics and calculation of true population prevalence using confidence intervals were used. To measure the association between county prevalence and the pig density by county, we used simple linear regression or scatter plot analysis performed in Stata10. In study 2, a total of 2349 blood samples from 112 nucleus and multiplier herds were tested for antibodies against influenza A virus. Testing of the nucleus herds was completed by the 18th of December 2009, and the multiplier herds were finished on the 31st of January 2010. The surveillance shows that 27.1% of the nucleus herds and 34.4% of the multiplier herds were seropositive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Between six and 12 months after a herd was seropositive for antibodies against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, blood samples were collected from slaughtered pigs born at least two months after the initial detection (study 3). In total, 1127 pigs from 38 herds were tested. Three of the 38 herds tested positive for antibodies against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. The seropositive herds were multiplier herds located in the South West region where pig farming density is highest (Figure 1 ). Pigs from all the 13 previously positive nucleus herds selected for the study were found negative at this time. However, the intensified surveillance is still ongoing in the nucleus herds. By the end of July 2011, nine of the 13 nucleus herds were tested again. Pigs from five of these herds were positive for antibodies against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, between 12 to 20 months of time after the primary infection in the herds.
