A substantial body of literature notes the sensitivity of VSL estimates based on CV methods to the nature of the risks considered, the way in which risks are presented, the size of the risk change and many other factors. 5 In low income rural communities these factors are likely to be even more significant. Particular concerns with survey approaches to health risk are limitations on the ability of individuals to understand the evaluation tasks that they are presented with, and to interpret the risk information that is provided (Viscusi, 1993) . In this study risks were not presented in terms of annual probabilities of death or injury, but in terms of the frequency of occurrence of an event, for example, a change in the risk of death from 4 per year in a population of 10,000 to 2 per year. 6 In an attempt to further simplify the statement of risk, respondents were asked to consider 10 villages each with a 1,000 inhabitants and a particular number of deaths or injuries across the villages each year. Showcards were also used to explain and compare risks. While cost of living differences can be used to represent the money component of risk-money tradeoffs (e.g., Viscusi et al., 1991) , these can be hard to explain in low income rural communities where subsistence agriculture provides a substantial proportion of income and where there is no housing market. Instead, in this survey cash income and the change in cash income between areas was used to represent the money component of risk-money tradeoffs. To help respondents think about their current income levels they were asked about their family's cash expenses during the last month. To check comprehension the respondents were initially asked for their preference between alternatives in which one area was dominant, since it had a higher cash income level and lower probability of death, or lower probabilities of both death THE VALUE OF STATISTICAL LIFE AND THE ECONOMICS OF LANDMINE CLEARANCE 515 and injury in risk-risk comparisons. If a respondent failed to select the dominant area the nature of the risk and the selection task was explained again. The interview was terminated if the respondent failed on a second attempt. (c) Risk-money tradeoffs The first set of questions in the core of the survey was designed to determine for each respondent the value of income that would make Area A and Area B indifferent given a specified difference in the risk of death from a landmine accident. This then enables the VSL to be calculated. Following Viscusi et al. (1991) , assume that risk preferences can be represented by the utility function U ðH ; Y Þ if the individual is healthy or U ðD; Y Þ if death occurs from a landmine accident, where Y is total income. Let I a and I b be the cash income levels in areas A and B and W be the common value of income from other sources (in our case this would include income from subsistence sources). The probabilities of death in areas A and B are X a and X b , respectively. Indifference between the two areas implies that Again, following Viscusi et al. (1991) , assume that the utility function is additively separable in health status and income, and the marginal utility of income is constant and equal to 1 for the range of income changes considered. 7 Therefore, where and u(.) is the utility function for health status. 8 For example, if I a ¼ B20; 000, I b ¼ B18; 400, X a ¼ 0:0004 and X b ¼ 0:0002, then L ¼ B8; 000; 000 or uðH Þ ¼ uðDÞ þ B8; 000; 000. 9 In order to determine the income difference that would make Area A indifferent to Area B for a given change in the risk of death, a respondent was presented with an initial alter-native that was then adjusted given the area that was preferred. 10 For example, in Questionnaire One the initial alternatives were Area A Area B Cash income of B20,000 per year Cash income of B18,400 per year Risk of death per year of 4/10,000 Risk of death per year of 2/10,000 These starting values were chosen to be easily understandable to the respondents, given the average income levels actually prevailing in the area and the desire to express magnitudes of risk that were comprehensible. 11 If Area B was selected as the preferred area, the cash income in Area B was revised down by B400 and the respondent was asked to reconsider the alternatives. This process continued through a series of up to four iterations until preference switched to Area A or the income in Area A reached B 16,800. The questionnaire contained a flowchart that directed interviewers through the iterations (see Appendix 1 for an English version of the Thai flowchart used in data collection). Any switch in preference provides a range within which the income level that would make the areas indifferent should lie. The respondent was then asked what level of income in Area B would make the areas equally desirable. If this value was inconsistent with the range of incomes implied by the preference switch, this survey response was disregarded. This process provided an additional consistency check. If Area A was selected given the initial alternatives, the cash income in Area B was revised upward by B400 through a series of up to four iterations until Area B was selected or the level of income had reached B20,000. 12 Again, the respondent was asked for the value of income in Area B that would make the areas equally desirable. Questionnaire One is said to have a ''willingness to pay'' format since the income that was revised was in the area with the lower risk of death. Questionnaire Two followed a similar procedure to establish indifference. For this questionnaire the initial alternatives were With this questionnaire, the income in Area B was adjusted to achieve indifference. This is said to have a ''willingness to accept'' format since the income that was adjusted was for the area with the higher risk of death. The two questionnaires were allocated randomly to the respondents. (d) Risk-risk tradeoffs The second set of questions was designed to determine the willingness of respondents to tradeoff the risk of injury from a landmine accident for increases in the risk of death from a landmine accident, or for a given population the tradeoff between injury and death. While landmine accidents cause a variety of injuries of different severity, including loss of legs, feet, arms, hands, and sight, the particular injury considered was the loss of a leg below the knee. 13 This was established by showing respondents a picture of a mine accident victim whose leg had been amputated below the knee. Given two alternative areas A and B, the questions sought to find the risk combination that would make Area A indifferent to Area B, assuming that all other aspects of the areas are identical. Following Viscusi et al. (1991) , consider a state-dependent utility model where uðDÞ is the utility associated with death from a landmine accident, uðJ Þ the utility of living with an injury, and uðH Þ the utility associated with full health. 14 Let X a and Y a be the annual probabilities of death and injury in Area A and X b and Y b be the corresponding probabilities in Area B. Given indifference between Area A and Area B It follows that The tradeoff between injury and death is defined as t. For example, if for Area A Y a ¼ 0:002 and X a ¼ 0:0002, while for Area B Y b ¼ 0:0012 and X b ¼ 0:0004, then indifference between the areas would imply an injury-death tradeoff of 4.0. The procedure used to determine the riskrisk alternatives that made Area A and Area B indifferent for the respondent was based on the same procedure as used for risk-money choices. The initial alternatives used were Area A Area B Risk of injury per year of 20/10,000 Risk of injury per year of 12/10,000 Risk of death per year of 2/10,000 Risk of death per year of 4/10,000 If Area A was chosen the number of injuries per 10,000 in Area B was revised down until preference switched or there were zero injuries. 15 A similar flowchart to that used for risk-money tradeoffs was employed (see Appendix 1). The respondent was then asked what number of injuries per 10,000 would make the areas indifferent. As above, this provided a consistency check. If Area B was chosen the number of injuries per 10,000 in Area B was revised up in a similar way until preference switched or the number of injuries reached 20 per 10,000. (e) Implicit value of statistical injury The estimates obtained for the value of statistical life, L, and the injury risk-death risk tradeoff enable the implicit value of a statistical injury to be calculated. From (2) and (5) it follows that uðH Þ À L ¼ tuðJ Þ þ ð1 À tÞuðH Þ; or (f) Sample characteristics Respondents for the survey were identified by stratified sampling. Three villages were randomly selected in each of the 10 sub-districts in Ban Phai district and each of the 12 sub-districts in Phon district in southern Khon Kaen province. A random sample of 10 households was drawn in each village, giving an overall sample of 660 households in 66 villages. The CV survey was conducted on a sub-sample drawn from 180 households in 18 of these villages. Respondents were 18 years of age or older, with one randomly selected male respondent and one randomly selected female respondent in each household interviewed. Each respondent answered the questionnaire independently, and should not have overheard responses being given by others. Approximately 16% of responses failed the consistency checks with the willingness to pay (WTP) format, compared with 7% for the willingness to accept (WTA) format (Table 2) . This difference was especially apparent in the reporting of a zero VSL, which can be considered as failing a dominance criterion given that the two areas would have had the same cash income, but different risks of death. This difference should not reflect sample differences because questionnaires One and Two were allocated randomly between respondents. Indeed, there is no evidence of significant differences between the two sub-samples in terms of their age, gender, education, income, or personal knowledge of landmine victims.
