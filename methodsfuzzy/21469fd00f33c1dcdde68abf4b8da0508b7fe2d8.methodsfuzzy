Cell culture and viruses PPRV vaccine strain (Nig75/1) was obtained from the China Institute of Veterinary Drug Control, Beijing, China. Vero cells (The American Type Culture Collection, ATCC: CCL-81, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) at 37uC with 5% CO 2 , and were used for PPRV propagation and titration. Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 insect cells were maintained in Sf-900II insect serum-free medium (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) as monolayer cultures or in suspension cultures maintained on temperate orbital shakers (120rpm) at 28uC. Cloning of M, H, and F genes and construction of bacmid transfer plasmids PPRV RNA was extracted using Trizol LS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Reverse transcription(RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed on extracted viral RNA with gene-specific oligonucleotide primers( Table 1 ) that had been designed according to the sequence of the PPRV Nig75/1 strain (GenBank accession no. X74443.2).Following RT-PCR, the cDNA fragments containing the PPRV M, H, and F genes were cloned into the pMD18-T vector (Takara, Dalian, China). The integrity of the nucleotide sequences of the M, H, and F genes was verified by DNA sequencing. The transfer plasmids were generated using the pFastBac Dual vector (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA), which contains two promoters. The M gene was cloned, as a1-kbXhoI-KpnIDNA fragment, downstream of the p10 promoter within the pFastBac-Dual bacmid transfer vector that had been digested with XhoI and KpnI. The resulting baculovirus transfer plasmid containing the PPRV M gene was designated p-M. A bacmid transfer vector expressing both the M and H genes was prepared by cloning the H gene, as a 1.8-kb BamHI-HindIII DNA fragment, into the BamHI/HindIII sites downstream of the Autographacalifornica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) polyhedron(P H ) promoter in p-M. The resulting plasmid, p-MH, encoded the M and H genes downstream from the p10 and P H promoters, respectively. Similarly, a bacmid transfer vector,p-MF, which permitted expression of both the M and F genes, was prepared by cloning the F gene, as a 1.6-kb BamHI-XbaI DNA fragment, downstream of the P H promoter, into p-M (Fig.1 ).
