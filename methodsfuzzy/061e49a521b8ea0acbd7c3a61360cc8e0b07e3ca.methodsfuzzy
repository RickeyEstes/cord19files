Clinical specimens and patient data. The clinical specimens and patient data used for mNGS analysis were derived from an etiological study of CA sepsis conducted at multiple hospitals across Indonesia (n ϭ 3), Thailand (n ϭ 4), and Vietnam (n ϭ 6) between 2013 and 2015 (3) . Hospitalized patients with suspected or documented CA infections, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for sepsis of the 2012 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (adults) (15) or the definitions of the Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (16) , were enrolled within 24 h of admission (3) . A total of 1,582 patients were enrolled (750 each from Vietnam and Thailand; 82 from Indonesia) (Fig. 1) . Per the study protocol, serum samples were collected from all patients; additional samples, including pooled nasal and throat swabs, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and stools, were collected when clinically indicated. After collection, all clinical samples were stored at -80°C. Additionally, information about the demographics, clinical entities, and outcomes of the patients was retrieved from a publicly available data set of the original study that was deposited at https://figshare.com/articles/Data_set_-_Causes_and_outcomes_of_sepsis_in_southeast_Asia_a_ multinational_multicentre_cross-sectional_study_NCT02157259_/3486866/1. Of 749 patients from Vietnam, 402 (54%) had no etiology identified via extensive clinical and reference laboratory workups in the original study ( Fig. 1 ; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material); of these, 386 (96%) had clinical materials available for additional etiological investigation and were thus included for viral metagenomic analysis in this study ( Fig. 1) (3). In total, 492 samples (6 CSF samples, 92 pooled nasal and throat swabs, 384 serum samples, and 10 stool samples) from these 386 patients with sepsis of unknown etiology were included in the analysis. Due to the availability of the materials, most samples were analyzed individually (n ϭ 458) or in pools of multiple samples (n ϭ 8) (Fig. 2) . Sample pretreatments and NA isolation. Prior to nucleic acid (NA) isolation, 100 l of clinical sample was treated with 2 U/l of Turbo DNase (Ambion, Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 0.4 U/l RNase I (Ambion) at 37°C for 30 min. Viral NA was then isolated from nuclease-treated materials using a QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and was recovered in 50 l of elution buffer. dsDNA synthesis and sequencing. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was synthesized from isolated viral NA using a set of 96 nonribosomal random primers (17) , amplified by PCR, and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) as described previously (18, 19) . In brief, 10 l of extracted viral NA was converted to dsDNA using FR26RV-Endoh primers (19) , SuperScript III enzyme (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), exo-Klenow fragment (Ambion, Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and RNase H (Ambion). Subsequently, the synthesized dsDNA was randomly amplified using the FR20RV primer (5=-GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATC-3=). The random PCR product obtained was then purified with the use of Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and was quantified with a Qubit dsDNA HS (high-sensitivity) kit (Invitrogen). Finally, 1 ng of purified product was subjected to library preparation using a Nextera XT sample preparation kit (Illumina) and was sequenced using a MiSeq reagent kit, v3 (600 cycles) (Illumina), on a MiSeq platform (Illumina). mNGS data analysis. The mNGS data were analyzed using an in-house viral metagenomic pipeline running on a 36-node Linux cluster to identify the presence of viral sequences in the tested specimens as described previously (20) . In brief, after duplicate reads and reads belonging to human or bacterial genomes were filtered out, the remaining reads were assembled de novo. The resulting contigs and singlet reads were then aligned against a customized viral proteome database using a BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool)-based approach. Next, the candidate viral reads were aligned against a nonre-dundant nonvirus protein database to remove any false-positive reads (i.e., reads with expected [E] values higher than those against viral protein databases). Any virus-like sequence with an E value of Յ10 Ϫ5 was considered a significant hit. Finally, a reference-based mapping approach was employed to assess the levels of identity and genome coverages of the corresponding viruses. PCR confirmation of viral reads. Because of the focus of the present study, specific PCRs were used to confirm the mNGS hits for viral species that are known to be infectious to humans and for recently discovered viruses that have been reported in human tissues previously but remain of uncertain tropism. Depending on the availability of the clinical materials, virus-specific PCRs were carried out either on leftover NA after mNGS experiments or on newly extracted NA. An mNGS result was considered positive only if it was subsequently confirmed by a corresponding viral PCR analysis of original NA materials derived from the corresponding individual samples. All PCR primers and probes used were either derived from previous publications or newly designed based on the sequences generated by mNGS (see Table  S2 in the supplemental material). Phylogenetic analysis. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree reconstructions of the sequences obtained were carried out using ClustalW alignment and maximum likelihood methods available within Geneious 8.1.5 (Biomatters) and IQ-TREE (21), respectively. Ethical statement. The study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of collaborating hospitals in Vietnam and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC), University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.
