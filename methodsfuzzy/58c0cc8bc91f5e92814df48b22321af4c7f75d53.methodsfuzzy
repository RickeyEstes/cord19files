Swine fecal samples (N = 120) were collected in 3 sets from 10 farms in Canada farms. In September and October 2005, 4 composite samples were collected from each farm: 3 of fresh pen manure and 1 of stored pit manure. This sampling program was repeated in November and December of 2005 and again in April and May 2006. The fecal samples were placed into sterile containers, shipped overnight on ice, and stored frozen. Bovine fecal samples (N = 179) were collected from May to October 2006 from 45 different dairy farms in Canada. In this sampling program, farms were sampled only once each; 4 composite samples were taken at each farm, 1 each from calf pens (fresh), milking cow pens (fresh), heifer pens (fresh), and storage pits (stored). The dairy cattle samples were also placed into sterile containers, shipped overnight on ice, and stored frozen. A total of 156 retail meat samples were purchased, 15 at a time, during January-March 2006, and 6 at a time during July-November 2006. The last purchase consisted of only 4 samples. Each purchase was equally divided between samples of raw chicken, beef, and pork, except for the last, which had 1 extra chicken sample. Fecal samples were suspended in 0.9% NaCl (5% wt/ vol), vortexed briefl y, and clarifi ed through a combination glass fi ber/PVDF 0.22-μm fi lter (Millipore, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). RNA was extracted from a 140-μL sample of the resulting fi ltrate by using the QIAamp viral RNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (QIAGEN, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Total RNA was extracted from 25-g meat samples by using Tri reagent (Sigma, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) and Dynabeads coated with oligo-dT (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) as described (23) . The RNA was used as a template for 1-step reversetranscription-PCR (RT-PCR) using Monroe region B primers (24) or Ando region A primers (25) and the OneStep RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN). Amplicons of 213 bp and 123 bp were considered to be presumptively positive for region B and region A, respectively. They were gel purifi ed by using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIA-GEN) and sequenced on both strands by DNA Landmarks [14, 15] ) using ClustalW (26) . The alignments were subjected to phylogenetic analysis with 2,000 replicates for bootstrapping by using the Seqboot, Dnadist (F84), Neighbor, and Consense programs, as implemented in the PHYLIP package (27) . Phylogenetic trees were generated by using TreeView software (28) .
