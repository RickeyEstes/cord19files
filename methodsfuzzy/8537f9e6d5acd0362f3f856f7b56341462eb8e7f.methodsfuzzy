Mice, macrophages and virus BALB/c and A/J mice were obtained from the mouse colonies of the Instituto Butantan, Instituto de Cieˆncias Biome´dicas of the University of Sa˜o Paulo or Max-Planck Institute for Immunobiology, Freiburg, Germany. They were kept under conventional conditions and used when 4-8 weeks old. Care of animals followed the appropriate guidelines. BMMF of mice were obtained from bone marrow cells collected from femurs by flushing of cavities with Dulbecco's modified MEM (DMEM) (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 100 U/ml of penicillin (Sigma) and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO). As clearly described in another publication (Munder et al., 2001) these BMMF population are homogeneously F4/80+, MAC-1+, I-A+, B7.1+, CD16/32+ with no detectable cells expressing T, B or NK cell markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD5, B220, DX5, NK1.1). Cells were cultured in non-toxic Teflon bags (fluorinated ethylene propylene, Biofolie 25; Heraeus GmbH, Hanau, Germany) as described (Munder et al., 1998a) . The Teflon foils were folded and sealed with a diathermal sealing apparatus (Polystar 100 B and Polystar 401 M-RPA; Rische+Herfurth GmBH, Hamburg, Germany) to give rectangular bags, and subjected to gas sterilization. Cells (5 Â 10 4 /ml) in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biochrom AG), 5% horse serum (Invitrogen-Gibco Co., Carlsbad, CA), 15% L929 supernatant as a source of colony-stimulating factor, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 1% sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen-Gibco) and 0.5% 2-mercaptothanol (Sigma) were incubated for 12 days at 37 1C in the presence of 10% CO 2 . Cells were detached by repeated careful stretching of the medium, transferred to 96-well microplates at a concentration of 2 Â 10 5 cells/100 ml and used in the experiments. Peritoneal macrophages (PMF) were prepared from peritoneal exudate cells collected by peritoneal lavage with DMEM containing 10% FBS and cultured in 96-well microplates at a concentration of 2 Â 10 5 cells/ 100ml. The cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 1C in 5% CO 2 , washed three times with DMEM after vigorous shaking to remove non adherent cells and used in the experiments. Although carefully treated, the PMF population may contain a few other cells. MHV3, originally obtained by the Institute of Virology, University Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg from Dr. J.L. Virelizier, Institut Pasteur, Paris, was cloned by limiting dilution; one plaque was selected and amplified on L929 cells to serve as the inoculum for future stocks to limit spontaneous mutations. Samples were then transferred to the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology, Freiburg and to the Laboratory of Virus Immunology, Institute Butantan, Sa˜o Paulo. Aliquots containing 2 Â 10 5 plaque-forming units per milliliter (PFU/ml) were stored at À80 1C and used in all experiments. The stocks as well as experimental samples were always titrated by plaque assay on L929 cells as previously described (Vassa˜o et al., 2000) .
