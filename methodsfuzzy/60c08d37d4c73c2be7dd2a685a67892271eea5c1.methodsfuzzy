Materials. Human thrombin was purchased from Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan) and human fibrinogen was purchased from Wako Chemicals and Sigma (Missouri, USA). Dimethyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol were purchased from TOKYO KASEI KOGYO (Tokyo, Japan), ethidium bromide was purchased form Sigma, and tRNA from baker's yeast was purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland). All oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen (California, USA). The other reagents were of analytical grade. Design of AESs. The DNA sequences used in this study are shown in Table 1 . We used a 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer as the enzymeinhibiting aptamer. The stem-and-loop structure bearing the probe DNA sequence was inserted into the 3 0 -end T-T loop of the G-quartet structure of the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer. For AES 1 and 2, we used the DNA sequence of the molecular beacons as the stem-and-loop structure, which has 5-bp-stem and 15mer-loop oligonucleotides [1] . For the series of SARS AESs, the loop sequences were designed to contain a sequence complementary to a portion of the genome sequence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (nucleotide positions 15581-15595 for AES SARS 1 and 15572-15596 for AES SARS 2, 3, and 4). These genome sequences were amplified using a pair of primers whose sequences have been published by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the stem sites were redesigned using the mfold program [26] . We also inserted two additional T bases between the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer and the stem-and-loop structure in all AESs except AES 1, since the diameter of the DNA double helix is different from the distance between two Gs of the G-quartet structure (approximately 17 and 20 Å , respectively). The putative secondary structure of the AES SARS 1 is shown in Fig. 2 . For the native PAGE experiment with AES SARS 1, AES SARS 1 was modified with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) at its 5 0 -end. For the measurement of the CD spectra of AES SARS 1, a stem-and-loop structure to be inserted into the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer on AES SARS 1 was synthesized. For the DMS footprinting of AES SARS 1, AES SARS 1, and the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer were modified with FITC at their 5 0 -end. Measurement of the inhibitory effect of the AESs on thrombin. Fifty microliters of folding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM KCl, pH 8.0) containing 4 lM AES and 4 lM target DNA or control DNA (final concentration: 1lM) was heat-denatured at 95°C for 3 min and cooled to 25°C over a period of 30 min. Following the heat treatment, the AES solution was mixed with 50 ll of the measurement buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM KCl, and 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) containing thrombin (final concentration: 54 nM), and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at 37°C. After 5 min, 100 ll of the AES solution containing thrombin was added to 100 ll of the measurement buffer containing Fig. 1 . Schematic of the DNA sensing system, in which a thrombin-inhibiting aptamer is fused with a stem-and-loop structure. The thrombin-inhibiting aptamer into which a stem-and-loop structure is inserted forms a G-quartet structure, since the stem site is formed by the annealing of both of its sides. When the target DNA hybridizes with the loop site of the stem-and-loop structure, the stem site is dehybridized, which leads to the disruption of the G-quartet structure of the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer site, thus reducing its thrombin-inhibiting activity. fibrinogen (final concentration: 1 mg/ml). The clotting time was measured using an automated fibrometer (Amelung KC-4 A Micro Coagulation Analyzer) at 37°C. In the experiment on the influence of the target DNA concentrations on AES SARS 1, we used 50 nM AES SARS 1, 5.4 nM thrombin, and 1 mg/ml fibrinogen, which was purchased from Sigma. Native PAGE of the oligonucleotides. FITC-labeled 15-mer SARS DNA (8.3 lM) and AES SARS 1 (8.3 lM) were mixed with the folding buffer, and the mixture was heat-treated as described above. Following the heat treatment, 6 ll of the mixture was electrophoresed on 11% polyacrylamide gel in 1· TBE buffer (89 mM Tris, 89 mM H 3 BO 3 , and 2 mM EDTA) at room temperature. Fluorescence imaging of FITC was carried out on a Typhoon 8600 (Amersham Biosciences, New Jersey, USA), and the oligonucleotides were also stained with ethidium bromide. CD spectrum measurement of AES SARS 1. The CD spectra of the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, AES SARS 1, AES SARS 1 hybridized with the 15-mer SARS DNA, the stem-and-loop structure, and the stem-and-loop structure hybridized with the 15-mer SARS DNA were measured. All oligonucleotides, at a final concentration of 25 lM, were heat-treated in the folding buffer as described above, and then 100 ll of the AES solution was added to 300 ll of the measurement buffer. The CD spectra were measured with a J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) at 200-320 nm using a 0.1-cm path-length cuvette at 25°C. DMS footprinting. FITC-labeled AES SARS 1 (10 lM) was heattreated as described above in the presence or absence of 10 lM 15-mer SARS DNA or 15-mer control DNA. Dimethyl sulfate (DMS) was added to give a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v) in a total volume of 100 ll, and the solutions were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The methylation reaction was halted by adding 5 ll of the stop solution (1.5 M sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 1 M 2-mercaptoethanol, and 100 lg/ml tRNA). The reactants were precipitated using ethanol, dissolved in 100 ll of 10% piperidine, and incubated at 90°C for 30 min. After the piperidine cleavage, the sample solution was lyophilized and separated on 7-M urea-20% polyacrylamide gel, and FITC fluorescence imaging was carried out on a Typhoon 8600 (Amersham Biosciences, New Jersey, USA). Table 1 The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in this study 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer Stem and loop SARS 1 The stem-and-loop sequence inserted into the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer is underlined. The 15-mer target DNA, the 15-mer SARS, and the 25-mer SARS are complementary strands of the loop sequence of AES 1, 2, and AES SARS 1 and AES SARS 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
