N-protected-amino acid-OH or N-protected-peptide-OH (1 equiv) was dissolved in THF and cooled to Ã€15 C. To the stirred solution, N-methylmorpholine (NMM) (1 equiv) and isobutylchloroformate (1 equiv) were added consecutively. After precipitation of N-methylmorpholine hydrochloride, the amine (1 equiv) was added and the mixture was allowed to warm to 25 C within 30 min. It was stirred for additional 90 min, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in EtOAc and the solution was washed with H 2 O, saturated NaHCO 3 , 5% citric acid and brine. The solvent was dried (MgSO 4 ) and evaporated. The crude residue was purified by flash column chromatography to give the product.
