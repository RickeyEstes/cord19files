This study was performed as a case-control study, where the calf was the study unit and the dependent variable was disease status, classified as case (calves diagnosed with diarrhea; CD+) or control (calf diagnosed not to have diarrhea; CD-). Unconditional associations between the dependent variable and each of the independent variables were first screened using Fisher's exact test and univariable logistic regression analysis. Variables with a P-value ≤ 0.20, provided that there was no co linearity (r < 0.70) between variables, were then considered for further analysis. Collinearity between variables was assessed pair-wise by calculation of Spearman rank correlations. Moreover, associations between antimicrobial resistance and presence of virulence genes in isolates of E. coli were investigated using the same analyses as in the case-control part of the study. Continuous variables, not linearly related to the outcome, were categorized using the quartiles as cut-points, or by using biologically important, or recommended cut-points. Categories of categorical variables with too few observations were amalgamated when biological, or logical, new categories were possible to make. In other cases such categorical variables were not used in the analysis. Variables with many missing values (> 20% missing observations) were not used in the multivariable analysis. A multivariable model was constructed using manual stepwise backward logistic-regression analysis, where variables not significant in the model were re-entered whenever a new variable became significant, or a variable was removed. Potential confounders and intervening factors were considered in every model. A variable was considered as a confounder if the point estimates of the coefficients in a model changed > 20% with the potential confounder present. In the final model a variable with a P-value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant and retained in the model. Biologically plausible interactions between the main effects were tested in the final model. Herd was not included as a random factor due to too few observations per herd. However, the "cluster" command in Stata was used making the standard errors allow for intragroup correlation. The fit of the models was evaluated with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test with the data partitioned into 10 deciles. The statistical analyses were done using Stata Software (StataCorp., 2010; Stata Statistical Software: Release 11.0; College Station, TX, USA: StataCorp LP.).
