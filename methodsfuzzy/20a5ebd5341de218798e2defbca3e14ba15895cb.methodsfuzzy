The study was approved by the Review Board and Ethics Committee of Riyadh Elm University. A total of 400 questionnaires were distributed among clinical students and interns at Riyadh Elm University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire was designed to cover different aspects of infection control practices in dental clinics including: 1. aseptic techniques, 2. patient screening and evaluation, 3. personal protection, 4. instrument sterilization, 5. immunization against hepatitis B virus, 6. surface disinfection, and 7. equipment asepsis. An informed consent was included in the questionnaire design and required to be signed by every participant. The questionnaire comprised 32 items assessing infection control practices among undergraduate dental students and interns at Riyadh Elm University. Out of 400 questionnaires sent, 309 forms were filled out and returned. Fortytwo of the respondents were interns (21 female and 21 male), while 267 forms were received from both male and female clinical students (96 4 th -year students, 85 5 th -year students, 86 6 th -year students). The results obtained from respondents were tabulated and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 24 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL USA). Results 309 questionnaires were answered by clinical dental students and interns from Riyadh Elm University. The distribution of respondents from male and female 4 th -, 5 th -, and 6 th -year students and interns is shown in Table 1 . The level of implementation of basic applied infection control measures was found to be good to excellent, except for HBV vaccine coverage and wearing protective eyewear. The results showed that only 76% of males and 83% of females had HBV vaccination, and only 30% of males and 26% of females always wore protective eyewear (Table 2 and Table 3) . A majority of dental students and interns complied well with different infection control measures during the treatment of patients and between patients, but there is still a need to raise their awareness and improve their attitude regarding infection control practices. The infection control practices followed by dental students and interns during the treatment of patients and between patients are shown in Table 4. 2/6 GMS Hygiene and Infection Control 2019, Vol. 14, ISSN 2196-5226 Table 1 : Distribution of respondents in the college to 4 th -, 5 th -, and 6 th -year students and interns both male and female Table 2 : Level of implementation of basic infection control measures at the university dental school Table 3 : Level of implementation of basic infection control measures at the university dental school
