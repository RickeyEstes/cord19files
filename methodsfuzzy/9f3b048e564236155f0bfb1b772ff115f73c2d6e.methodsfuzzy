The amphiphilic properties of integral membrane proteins are the principal reason why methodologies to purify hydrophilic proteins are not applicable to their purification. As was shown in the preceding paragraph, detergent extraction can be used as a (pre) purification step to remove the integral membrane proteins from the (sub) cellular membranes of cells. Any further chromatographic purification steps will require the presence of a detergent to keep the protein in solution. Further prepurification can be obtained by creating a phase separation in the solution containing detergent. Bordier [ 291 extracted proteins from a lipid bilayer by creating a two-phase system with Triton X-114 . This detergent separates into an aqueous phase and a detergent phase at 30` C, and integral membrane proteins were preferentially found in the detergent phase while hydrophilic proteins showed up in the aqueous phase . This procedure was successfully applied to a number of proteins : El glycoprotein of a corona virus [30] ; E2 protein of Semliki Forest virus [31] ; G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus [32] ; rat intestinal brush border membrane proteins [33] ; major surface protein of Leishmania [34] . However, two well characterized integral membrane proteins, the acetylcholine receptor [35] and the T8 antigen of human T lymphocytes [36] , failed to partition into the detergent phase . Parish et al . [ 37 ] recently developed a more versatile version of this prepurification technique . They used ammonium sulphate to facilitate entry of integral membrane proteins into the detergent phase . Since addition of ammonium sulphate lowers the cloud point to physiologically acceptable temperatures, this also had the advantage that the procedure could be extended to several other detergents, including the more commonly used Triton X-100 . Six murine lymphocyte surface molecules partitioned into the Triton X-100 phase from 33-50% ammonium sulphate saturation . Organic solvents can also be used to extract integral membrane proteins from the lipid bilayer . A two-phase system can be created, and membrane proteins soluble in the organic phase can be separated from proteins in the aqueous phase [3] .
